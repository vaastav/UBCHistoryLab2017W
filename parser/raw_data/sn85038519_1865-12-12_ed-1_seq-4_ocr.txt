the view to commemorate the viitue and
patriotism of those great and good men,
George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
FIINSION TO MRS. LINCOLN.
Mr. Wcnthwortb, (Kep., 111..) introduced
n bill for tho relief of Mr. Lincoln. It
provides that full payment be made of the
salary of her late husband, considering f lie
circumstances under which he came to his
death. Mr. Wcnthwortb. said that Mrs.
Lincoln was ono of his constituent"'. He
iiad just consulted with his Illinois col
leagues and the ndminUtrator of the estate,
and the necessities of the case rendered such
a bill proper.
The bill was referred to the select com
mittee npointcd to take action, with a view
to pome suitable token of the estimation in
which the late President is held.

"Antelope" contributes the following,
over his own signature, from " Kye," to the
Hume Wcclly, Philadelphia, It will no
doubt interest all of our agricultural read
ers :
ABOUT CHANGING SEED.
Itii suqirising to mchow nny man can
advocate or even countenance the planting or
sowing of the same seed year after year, yet
such a course ha found supporters in the
iforne II Vri-ty, and perhaps their peculiar
theories have found believers green ones, I
should say.
I flatter myself that I have done some
farming, and watched its progress in all its
various branches with great interest, but I
must confess that a use of the samo seed,
whether of tho potato, wheat, rye, com, oats,
etc elc for a period of over three years, is
just about the met backward style of farm
ing mat l can conceive oi.
W here I could get the other seoit l woutu
not use what 1 had for more than two years ;
in other words, 1 would change potatoes anil
all rrains cverv two vears, satisfied that by
so doitiK 1 would have an increased yield
of from thirty to ntty per cent, in ine pro
duction. The planting of the same potatoyear after
vcar cannot be continued without a final giv
ing out of the crop altogether (unless it be a
crop of marbles.) and tho repeated sowing
of wheat and other grain will invariably be
followed bv a like result. It is so in the an
imal kingdom, and why not in tho vegetable
as well? What sane man that wished to
improve the breed, size and health of his
farm stock would think of breeding in and
iniwrevmr? Some, manv I fear, do it.
but they should hide their heads for very
shame.
To obtain a succession of fine potatoes, I
, ft Ml .
get new seed as oiion aapossuuc; 10 secure
large corn, I select the biggest ears and shell
off (by hand) only the largest kernals, avoid
ing ilTw nt loth ends: to have heavv wheat
or rye, I not only get new seed, but 1 tuft it
by hand, removing all the foul sulistanccj,
small and broken grains, and leaving onlv
large and plump seed, the weight of which
usually to several pounds over thcsUindard;
to secure handsome, thriving poultry, I get
fresh strong roosters, and set only the largest
eggs I can find ; to keep my sheep vigorous
and healthy,.a new and improved buck is
introduced to their acquaintance every sec
ond or third vcar, and so on, I might go all
through tho catalogue of farm life.
Such is inr man, as tlic President would
say ; if any object and prefer to breed in. or
plant and sow over and over all their life
time, thev are icrfeetlv welcome to do SO.
onlv I hope they will never have the as
surance to claim that they aro "Progressive

31 r. ScwanVn Account of tlic Attack
Ifjpon 211m.
The American correspondent of the Lon
don Spectator, contains the following account
of a conversation with Secretary Seward,
and Mr. Frederick Seward, giving a des
cription of their sensations at the time of the
attempted assassination:
" Mr. Frederick Seward said, that on step
ping from his bedroom into the plssage, and
seeing the assassin, he merely wondered what
he was doing there, and called him to ac
count. On his resisting the fellow's endeavor
to press into Mr. Seward's room, the assas
sin drew a revolver, which he presented at
Mr. Frederick Seward's head. What fol
lowed, it must be remembered, took placo in
a few seconds. Mr. Frederick Seward's first
thought was, 'That's a navy revolver.'
The man nulled the trigger, but it only
snapped, anct his intended victim thought,
' That cap missed fire.'
"His next sensation was that of confusion,
and being upon the floor, resting upon his
arm, which, like his father's jaw, was barely
recovered from a bad fracture the assassin
had felled him to the floor with the but of
the pistol he put his hand to his head, and
finding a hole there, he thought, 'That cap
did not miss fire after all.
"Then he became icscnsible,and remained
so for two days or more, nis first indica
tion of returning consciousness was the ques
tion, "Have you not got the ball out?"
after which he fell ofi'again into a comatose
condition, which was of long continuance.
On the very aficrnoon of the day when
Mr. Lincoln was assassinated, Mr. Frederick
Seward, who was Arshtant Secretary of
State, had asked his father what prepara
tion should le made for the presentation of
Sir Frederick Rruce, which wa3 to take
place the next day. Mr. Seward gave him
the points of a reply to be made to Sir Fred
erick, and he laid the outline of the speech
upon the President's table, and, as I have
previously informed my readers, Mr. Lincoln
that afternoon wrote out the reply, adopting
Mr. Seward's suggestion", and thus preparing
the reception of the Itritish Minister by
President Johnson, which was regarded at
the time by the people to whose representa
tive it was addressed as so friendly and fair,
and dignified.
"Mr. Frederick Seward's first inquiry after
he came fully to his senses, which w.n a long
time after the assassination, was: 'Has Sir
Frederick Rruce been presented?" He
thought that only one night had passed since
he knew not what had happened to him, and
his mind took up matters just where it had
left them.
" Mr. Seward's mental experience during
his supposed assassination was in its nature
so like that of his son, that it raises the
question whether this absence of consterna
tion and observation of minute particulars
is not common in circumstances of unex
pected and not fullyapprchended peril. Mr.
Seward was lying upon his side, close to the
edge of his bed, with his head resting in a
frame, which had been made to give him
ca'c and protect his broken jaw from pres
sure. "He was trying to keep awake, having
been seized upon by a sick man's fancy it
was that if he slept he would -wake up with
lockjaw. He was brought to full conscious
ness by the scufllc in the passage way, fol
lowed by the entrance of the assassin, and
the crv of Miss Seward, 'Oh I he will kill
my father.' Hut he saw nothing of his as
sailant until a hand appeared above his face,
and then his thought was, 'What handsome
cloth that overcoat is made of.' The assas
sin's face then appeared, and the helpless
statesman only thought, 'What a handsome
man 1' (Payne wa3 a fine looking fellow.)
"Then came a sensation as of rain strik
ing him smartly upon one side of his face
and neck, then quickly the same upon the
other side, but he felt no severe pain. This
was the assassin's knife. The blood spouted,
be thought 'My time has come,' and falling
from the bed to the floor, fainted. His first
sensation of returning consciousness was that
he was drinking tea, and 'that it tasted good.'
Mrs. Seward was giving him tea with a
spoon. He heard low voices around him,
asking and replying as to whether it would
be possible for him to recover. He could
not speak, but his eves showed his conscious
ness, and that lie desired to speak. They
brought him a porcelain tablet, on which he
managed to write, "Give me some more tea.
I shall get well.' And from that moment he
has slowly but steadily recovered health and
strength."
Freak of Fortune. A lady of this city,
of the highest respectability and afilucucc
before the war, by one of the vicissitudes of
Dame Fortune became separated from her
husband during the early days of the Con
federacy. For years she had heard nothing
of him, and at lat the melancholy conclu
sion was accepted that he was dead. In the
meantime she became reduced in circum
stances, and at the time when the Federal
troops occupied the city she was compelled
to dispose of her costly and elegant furni
ture. This she did, piece by piece, until the
last object which served to" bind her to her
former independence had been sent, and she
began to despair. Only a few days ago she
received a letter from a gentleman residing
in Mississippi, in which she was informed
that her husband had lately died, leaving a
fortune of over sixty thousand dollars, of
which she was the only heir. A check for
one thousand dollars accompanied the letter
for her immediate wants, and she immedi
ately took her departure for the place where
her unexpected fortune awaited her. It ap
pears that her husband, having enlisted in
the army was discharged on account of ill
ness, and owing to the unscitlcd state of the
country, preferred to remain in the extreme
South until the close of the war. While
there he became engaged in various specula
tions, and made large amounts of money, in
tending to rejoin his family as soon as peace
was declared. He invested his funds in cot
ton, and had just disposed of it when death
closed his career. He had written many let
ters to his wife, but, strange to say, none of
them reached her ; the above letter being the
first information she had been able to obtain
as to his fate. Fiehmond Time.
