Perhaps the rather remarkably
peaceful opening of congress Is merely
in the nature of the calm that, comes
toefore a storm.

given credit for one thing. It . is per
fectly grand for cooking and heating
purposes during the months of July

Innovation of the near future with ' a

result in the creation of another band

Here's some additional evidence, if
any were needed, of the fact that To
peka Is experiencing a healthy growth.
The public school population is hun

Because Wall street has taken kind
ly to President Taft's message, a few
people will rise up and shout that
the document is defective In all details
and nothing like a presidential message
should be In this day of grace.
Under a recent court decision ex
press companies are liable for the full
value of whatever packages they lose.
And so the folks who pay the freight
have finally won a Httle victory. That's
an unusual thing to happen.
There can be little doubt that the
manager of the local gas company Is
speaking well within the truth when he
etates that Topeka is - a, ''dead end"
town as far as Its supplyof natural gas
to concerned, especially when the gas
Is most needed.

fine record will be made. And again,

Drill be made.
When an individual lives to an un
gual age he generally has an equally
unusual and often ridiculous reason
tor his longevity. The latest In this
Hne comes from the Washingtonian of
103 year who atttributes his long Hfe
to the constant eating of peppermint
candy.
That was quite a good . sized and
equally delicious "pie" which was cut
the other day by President Taft when
be sent the appointments of 1,200 men
to various governmental offices to the
senate for confirmation. It was also
a bitter one for those who were passed
by to the distribution of the pieces.
President Taft's special messages to
congress will be a trifle different from
those which helped to make his pre
decessor famous. Mr. Taft win discuss
tr. them hnjport&nt matter which he did
not touch in his regular annual mes
sage. Colonel Roosevelt'a special mes
sages to congress, or most of them,
were pointed lectures to congressmen
because they had failed to consider mat
ters he urged In his regular messages.
"What Is whisky?." This is the ques
tion that President Taft is reported to
be struggling with these days. The
point for him to decide is Whether or
not whisky, artificially aged and high
er rectified, is whisky or Imitation
whisky. Inasmuch as the president is
on the water wagon it is difficult to
figure out how he will be able to ren
der a decision in the premises. It
takes a. real connoisseur to determine
when whisky is whisky and when it
Un't.
Senator Bristow called on the presi
dent the other day. Anybody who ex
pected little or much blood to be spill
ed when such an event took place was
treated to a disappointment. It is even
related that a few of "insurgent" rep
resentatives have shaken hands with
"Uncle Joe." Evidently "inurging" on
the Chautauqua circuit and doing the
same thing in Washington are different
propositions. From the way some of
the "insurgents" conducted themselves
during the summer months it , was ex
pected that if they got close to "Uncle
Joe" or President Taft when they ar
rived In Washington they, would try to
bite off a few ears or anything they
could get their teeth on. . .-
COAL in KAXSAS.
That not the least valuable of the
many resources of Kansas Is coal Is
made clear in a report on the coal yield
of the nation for the year 1908 which
has lust been compiled and made public
by the United States geological survey.
Although the matter discussed is a
year old, it should be interesting to
many.Kansans who probably have not
much of an idea of the coal mining in
dustry in the state and the extent .of
the coal deposits here.
During the year mentioned the pro
ductlon of coal in this state was 6,245,
508 short tons of a spot value of $9,292,-
222. Compared with the production of
the year before this is a decrease of
1,076,941 tons and a decrease in value
of $1,867,476. This decrease is . due in
the main to the fact that many
of the cities in state which here'
tofore used large quantities of Kan
sas coal are now using natural
gas quite extensively when they can
get it. Attention is called to this
fact in the geological survey's' report,
and it might be remarked, parenthet
ically, that in this report is a list of
names of the cities hereabouts getting
a natural gas supply and Topeka's is
not among them. Whether this omis
sion Is due to accident or design every
body in town will be forced to admit
that it is quite appropriate, at least, as
far as the wintry season is concerned.
: Perhaps the most interesting feature
of this report is the important fact
that although the Kansas coal fields
have been worked pretty Industriously
during the past decade or more, the
actual coal supply in the state has
scarcely been scratched. According to
tfie estimates of the experts of . the
geological survey, the total area in
Kansas known to contain workable
coal beds Is 3,100 square miles, while the
area of which little is known, but which
may contain workable coal, is estimated
at 15,780 square miles. The original coal
supply of the state is estimated to have
been 7,022,000,000 short tons, from which
there has been mined, to the close of
1908, 97,421,712 short tons. 1 This repre
sents an exhaustion, including the loss
of mining, of about 146,000,000 short
tons. It would thus appear that only
about 2.1 per cent of the coal supply of
the state has been exhausted. In other
words, Kansas has a large amount of
available coal which will stand ner in
good score for years and years to come.
SUGAR TRUST INQUIRY.
A variety of plans have been sug
gested in congress already for an in
vestigation of the scandalous opera
tions of the sugar trust by a con
gressional committee. If action Is
taken along any one of these, lines It
will be in direct opposition to the
ideas of President Taft in the
premises, and his position in this re
spect appears to be a most tenable
one.
In his .recent message he devoted
special attention to the sugar trust
frauds and pointed out that in its
monetary settlement with the govern
ment for tha custom duties which It
had fraudulently evaded, there was
an express reservation In the conlract
of settlement by which the settlement
should not interfere with, or prevent
the criminal prosecution of everyone
who was found to be subject to the
same. The president called attention
to the fact that some such prosecu
tions were now under way and that
the treasury department and thj de
partment of Justice were "exerting
every effort to discover all the wrong
doers, including the officers and em
ployes of the companies who may
have been privy to the fraud."
"It would seem to me," added Mr.
Taft, "that an investigation of the
frauds by congress at present, pend
ing the probing by the treasury de
partment and the department of Jus
tice, as proposed, might by giving
immunity and otherwise prove an em
barrassment in securing conviction of
the guilty parties." '
That Is exactly the way, in all
probability, that a congressional in
quiry Into this subject would work cut
at the present time. It -would seem
that the governmental propee-ilugs
already under way in this particular
are resulting satisfactorily. It is evi
dent from that part of the president's
statement, last quoted, that the de
partments of the treasury and justice
have a line on some of the "officers"
of the sugar companies who may be
criminally liable for the actual fraud
ulent acts of their employes. It Is to
be presumed that among the first
persons a congressional investigation
committee would call would be the
officers of the sugar company. Testi
mony might be secured from them
which would render them Immune
from criminal prosecution, and thus
the efforts now under way to bring
them to justice might be foiled. A
congressional Inquiry into this affair
may be desirable, but it ought to be
postponed, at least, until the treasury
department and the department of
Justice have concluded the investiga
tions they are now conducting. . It
would be ridiculous to let any of the
robber cats, especially big ones, which
may be caught, escape from the bag
through any over-zealous meddling on
the part of congress.
NO MONOPOLY ON SAINTS.
"A curious error exists .n the minds
of many people roughly stated -that
all saints are the creation and the ex
clusive possession of . the Roman Cath
olic church, and that they are only
rightly called saints if they have re
ceived the papal stamp of approval
through canonization," writes Elnora
Kinnicutt In the December Scribner.
"This Is incorrect. For proof, . we
need only go back to the Psalms of
David, 'Sing ' unto the lord. O ye
saints of his,' 'To the saints that are
on the earth, and to the excellent in
whom is all my delight.' 'O, love the
Lord, all ye his saints." These words
were written a thousand- years before
the birth of the Church of Rome.
The Psalms further help to point out
to us that the early saints were se
lected and elected, not through a pro
cedure in ecclesiastical courts, but by
the voice of trie multitude.--- Again and
again it has happened- that a people
has insisted upon the recognition of
one of its own-made saints, local or
national. But history, civil as well as
ecclesiastical, owes a great debt; to
the Roman Catholic church for hav
ing from the very beginning framed
and hung in the lone gallery of time
deserve to be honored. Always keen
to respond to the elemental needs of
human nature, the church early ap
preciated that 'there Is no more root
ed instinct In men than to admire
what is better and more beautiful
than themselves.' and that 'an ex
ample is always better than a precept'
Memorials of courage .: and service
help to fortify men's faith in eternal
truths,' to increase the value' of life
through expectancy, and to prevent
minds from becoming blunted to the
great ends of living.'
"The only real democracy that the
world has ever known is the demo
cracy of sainthood, as founded by the
early Christians. Apocryphal writings
and ecclesiastical art have pictured to
us the company of - the" blessed: "a
great multitude, which no man could
number, of all nations, kindred and
people and tongues." If we examine
religious paintings, we find the king
and the beggar, the queen and the
peasant, the prelate, and the friar in
the same group. And in earthly re
lationships the same is true."

Friendships are usually about as
ncKie as anytning well could be.
Conversations which start with: "It
goes without saying" are unnecessary.

Nothing is more desirable' than a
clear conscience and few things are
rarer.
If most people only worked when
they felt like it, there wouldn't be so
very much accomplished in this world.

JAYHAWKER JOTS
Exceedingly remarkable and mys
terious is an accident which was de
tailed recently by Charles H. Browne In
his Horton Headlight as follows: "A
Brown county school, teacher three
years ago made the mistake of
pinning her belt with a needle instead
of a pin, and the needle couldn't be
found. Just the other day it was dis
covered coming out of the arm of one
of the local school officers who had
been keeping company with her at the
time of the accident. We don't know
how the needle was recognized as the
same one, unless by the expression of
the eye. How it got from the young
woman's waist Into the young man's
arm is a secret that baffles science."
Idle hours, loafing and cheap amuse
ments never made a big man and never
will. If you are looking to advance
ment, there is only one sure way of
getting it and that is by working for
it. If you want to loaf and squander
your time don't complain that you nev
er naa a chance. What win be your
program? Younjr man, what is your
program for the winter? - Your even
ings are at your command, are you
going to squander them in loafing and
cheap amusement or are you going to
make them count in improvement?
There are boundless opportunities for
the young man or today. Books with
out numbers are at his command at a
uominal cost. Correspondence schools
of hleh order are offering courses of
dudy preparatory for almost any walk

it on at home. Many of the great men

Not so lone ago a young Concordian

man says, he answered the note and re
ceived a reply of which the following Is

THE MEDIUM'SOPPORTUNITY. .
" A party of distinguished men and wo
men met in New York city one night
this week and saw a spiritualist medium
do a lot of things commonly called
wonderful. They pronounced the seance
& "great success." They could not un
derstand the marvels which Eusapia
Paladino. the Italian medium perform
ed before their very eyes. . The wonders
consisted of makine a table tremble,
then walk, on two welks and lastly rise
from the floor and remain in the air
without visible support for a few sec
onds. A stool that had had Ihe ap
pearance of being only an innocent
bystander took a notion suddenly that
it was too good for a seat on the
floor. It Jumped from the floor to the
middle of .the table. , These were the
wonders at which . the party of dis
tinguished persons' was amazed. Why
did the medium waste euch wonderful
power on demonstrations not only
without value but decidedly silly. Why
not put the hidden power to some
good work. This idea carried out would
bring great-fame to the medium doing
It for no other has ever thought of it

be able to make a table wobble is not
accomplishing anything worth while.

IS COST OF LIVING HIGHER?
A profound reason why the cost of
living is high, yet a reason that is
usually disregarded, is that we live
high. People who enjoy every mod
ern convenience In fare, clothing and
household appointments are apt to
complain because they have little left
as a margin at the ena or wie rnonui
or year, and compare their situation
with some former , time when they
lived much more simply. '
An lnterestine- contribution to xnis
subject has been developed at Sacra
mento, as the flesult or discussions ana
a conference between newspaper pub
lishers and their employes. Such a
demonstration for California does not
prove anything, of course, for the rest
of the country, yet offers many in
teresting suggestions. In general, the
report made by . the committee of
publishers snows tnat rne genera.!
conviction as to - increased cost of
living is based, not on an actual In
crease in the nrice of items, properly
entering into the cost of living, but on
the fact that the average family is
spending more money and saving less
than it used to. It is shown that flour
is about the only item of living ex
pense In Sacramento in which there
has been a material increase since
1904, and as the flour bill in the aver
age family of four and seven-tenths
persons is only one-nun or. ine roiai

No TresDass in Air.
Whether drivers of airships and fly
ing machines are to enjoy absolute
freedom of the air In the future or be
liable to punishment for tresnas:
whether the air above a man's land
belongs to him or to the public is
question that lawyers on both sides of
tne ocean are discussing with very
keen interest.
In a recent lecture before the Aero
Club of America Mr. Lyttleton Fox
neia to tne opinion that the state must
condemn the air as a public highway
tnrough eminent domain proceedings,
taking title to it subject to the right
of the property- owner to build as high
as ne desired.
Mr. R. Floyd Clarke, a lawyer of
si wail street,, who 'has given much
study to the new aerial Jurisprudence,
declares the air will be regarded as
free as the ocean and that present
laws for navigation of the ocean and
the navigable streams will be applied
to the navigation or the air.
In the first place, said Mr. Clarke,
the suggestion of Mr. Fox would be
very difficult and expensive to carry
out In practice, embodying the descrlp
tion In a petition of condemnation of
all parcels of real estate throughout
the state and notice to an owners,
mortgagees, etc. a stupendous and
almost impossible undertaking.
There now seems little aouDt tnat
extensive travel through the air will
soorTTeja. fact, and the question or
right of way will soon have to be set
tled. In mv Judgment it will be eas
ily done, for the common law has
within its bosom the elasticity needed
to meet the new conditions. Under
well recognized fundamental principles
it requires only a judge or tne caimer
of a Mansfield, a Marshall, or a Taney
to fit an - old rule to new fact? and
evolve complete justice without fur
ther legislation.
"The waters or tne oceans ana riv
ers mav be looked upon as a Horizon
tal plane over which man exercises his
activities, lust as the air, in view of
the new activities, may be looked up
on as a series of perpendicular planes
in which he exercises nis activities,
Had the old judges had presented to
them in cases Involving tne lana own
ers' title to the air above his lands the
same facts of practical navigability of
the air by the public as tney naa ex
isting before them in the case of nav
igable waters they undoubtedly would
have followed the same rule as to the
rights of the public and the rights of
the private owner." new.igri ner

rThestntit Tree Deceived.
A horse chestnut tree In Clinton
avenue, opposite Quitman street, is in
bloom for the secona time inis year.
There are small clusters of blossoms,
buds, and voune green leaves all over
tViA lower nart of the three. The top
foliage consists almost entirely or
hrnwn leaves. A leading botanist as
serts the old tree looks foolish. -
Members of the shade tree commis-
oinn 'nn erudite body, say the tree
was fooled by the recent long dry
spell, which put it to sleep. Usually
trees sleep in the winter, after having
developed their Duas ana tucKea mem
away in embryo shape, all ready for
the following spring. The horse chest

one of these occasions Wynne was

"You have the address, No. 660

Wynne had heard of the Bostwlcks
as some newly-rich people who had
recently moved to the city.
"I have engaged a chauffeur," said
Bostwlck, "but he can't come until
Friday and my wife has" some guests

Do you know where I could get one

"We are not very busy Just now.
We can spare you a man. Wynne,
you may taKe the car to Mr. . Bost
wick's house tomorrow and run it for
him."
There was malice aforethought in
this selection by the sales manger
who sought to humiliate the young
workman, but Wynne was delighted
at the prospect of viewing the city
once more by daylight.
On the next morning, Wynne did
not don his working clothes He
dressed as any gentleman would dress
ror the occasion, and then slipped on
a- long dust-colored coat, cap and
goggles.
He drove the big car up In front
of the Bostwlck mansion and pres
ently Mr. Bostwick came out with
three women, one of whom Wynne
recognized as Mrs. Bostwlck. and
from the conversation he learned that
her two companions were her guests.
While they were all inspecting and
praising the car, the door opened
again, and a picture-book girl In
fetching automobile costume, came
down the steps.
Let's be off," she said gallv in a
voice that was music in Wynne's
ears.
Mr. Bostwick helped them in, seat
ing the girl whom he called Lenore
up beside Wynne.

he asked of his temporary chauffeur.
"Perfectly." he replied.
"Then drive through the parks and

they had reached nome, -ana we

Thank you," said Wynne, toucn-
Ing his hat. "Shall I leave the car
here?" " - -
Yes; I shall send a maid to snow
you to the servants- quarters,-- sne
said loftily.
So Wynne wasnea nis race ana
hands in the lavatory for the servants
and sat down to luncheon with them.
Before he had donned his coat, cap
and goggles, Lenore came Into the
servants dining room. - She looked at
him In surprise and flushed a uttie
as she noted his faultless attire and
hl refined features. A glance at his
rough, red hands, however, reassured
her.
"We are ready to start - when you
are. Mr. wynne.
When they were well out of the
city and his attention was no longer

noticed that Lenore was quieter than
she had been in the morning and
seemed to be troubled about some

She seemed relieved upon hearing
this Information.
Are you well paid? she asked.

plied proudly. "I started in at
$1.75."
Wouldn t you ratner De cnaurreur

"I would like to be your cnaurreur

was dancing In the water. There wa

Wynne's orders and who showed him

Lenore. She was very ouiet during
the return home.
"I must have the mater call " re
flected Wynne, "and I'll ask Thorn
to take me there some evening. He
always knows the newcomers."
When Saturday with its beloved
half holiday came, Wynne again
sought Shell beach and his yacht. As
he Was on his way to the pier he came
face to face with Lenore.
"Mr. Phelps," she said with flushed
face and embarrassed air. "I am so
sorry about the mistake."
"There was no mistake. Miss Bost

lovely day and I hope you did also.
Please tell me how you learned my
