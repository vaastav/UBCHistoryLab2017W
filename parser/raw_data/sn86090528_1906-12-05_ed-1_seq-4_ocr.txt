What a gTtat preacher the world
ised when Theodore Roosevelt
EH
became a statesman:
THE MESSAGE
When Secretary Taf t was asked
a few days ago what Congress
would do about tbe d:srbarge of
the negro soldiers, be replied, "I
don't konw, but I know one thing
it can do, it can invest igate." And
the very first day Senator Penrose
called for an investigation.
It is more ol a message to tne
nation than to Congress. The Prts
Jdent bas taken the pporunity to
speak to the people on the political,
social and moral questions that are
uppermost In his thought.
It is defensive ot the President's
attitude and a reply to bis critics
in many portions, notably in his
dealing with the question of . criti
cism of courts.
Oa the subjects treated it is clea t ,
outspoken and bold. In advocating
the doctrine of employer's liability
for death or injury due to una void
able accident and in his recom
mendation for a national law for'
the control of . marriage and
divorce, the President has taken an
advanced stand.
There is nothing remarkable in
the treatment of the sublet of
corporations, railroads, capital and
labor and related topics. It is such
as we have beeu accustomed to hear
from Mr. Roosevelt. He is willing
to wait to see how existing laws
are gting to work before adopting
more drastic measures.
The declaration for an income
and inheiitauce tax had already
been foreshadowed in previous
pub'ic utterances of the President.
He is doubtless going against the
sentiment of bis party on . these
questions.
In his treatment of the injunction
proposition.the President has shown
do disposition to heed public clamor
and his utterance must be admired
for their boldness and directness
even through we may not agre
with him. , ,
The incident of the Japanese
school children in San Francisco is
bandied without gloves. Able auth
orities will question the soundness
of the President's position 04 the
question.
Noticeably missing is any re;
fererence to the tariff qnestion. If
the President has any of the revis
ion leanings that have been at
tributed to him, he has carefully
guarel then. It may be that he
is waitingfor his party to formulate
a policy upon which all will agree.
Certainly in view of the battle for
tariif revision that has been waged
by certain leaders of his party and
In advocating freedom cf speech
in the criticism of judicial decisions
the President is evidently defend
ing himself but there's good sens
in his opinions. Why should judges
be elevated above public criticism?
On the whole, it must be pro
nounced a very "decent" message
for the President's favorite adjec
tive is lib.rally sprinkled through
it.
- The stand-patters are satisfied.
Unc'.e Joe Cannon might have writ-
i '
tin the 4tari2 clause. Revisionists
search in rain'fci the word "tariff"
in the message.
It's a Rooseveltian
which is enough said.

THE PRISID1NTS MISSIGE.
(tyith apologies to Mr. Dooley)
"Have ye read the Prisidint's mis
sige, Finnegan," says Mr.Hooligao,
"No,"says Finngan, "Iteada pri
sidint's missige wanst end since then
I don't. I like the wurruks cf
Misther Josaphns betther." "But
shure," says Mr. Hooligan, ' "ye
should read our own Tiddy '3 mis
sige to the min.wimmin and child
em of Ameriky.the Japs, theRoos
bans, the Republicans, the ' Poorto
Racans, the Filipinos, the Cubans,
uur sisther Staats of South Ameri
ky, Hawit. San Franciso and
Congress. It's a thruty ramarkable
addriss and I'd as soon do without
me brakefast food as not to rade it.
A wonderful documiri, Finnegan,
a ginral cyclopadia of useful infer
mation and stch a sermon as Henry
Word Baacber in his foinest days
couldn't have praached. Ye should
rade it Fiunigan or ye' 11 be ignrant
to tbe last day ye live, iv be great
plitical and moral , questions that
confront our great nation and iv the
latest styles in spellin,"
"An what is it, Hooligan that so
atthracts you about this missige?"
It's tbe foine morral tone of it,"
says Mr. Hooligan. "Tiddy can
give em all cards and spades on
morality, Finnegan, and bate era.
Me old friend. Moses, who wrote
the dialog (I balave they call it)
didn't lay down the law of vartu
with baf the courage and simplicity.
rile says, says he, 'Ye must be good,
iBechildern; if ye don't, I have
big piach three limb behind the
clock and that's the wurrud with
the bark on it?
"He says toRockyfeller'ye musfn't
appress poor O'Brien who wurruks
tor ye and you must quit takin ra
bates.it s wicked an no dacent man
will do it? Capital and labor, he
says, says he, must wurruk togeth
er, not like a young mule and a
steer that's niver been brok. They
must quit their balkin and kickin
over the thraces and stip livily when
they see me big stick.'
"An there'3 been intoirely too
much disturbance in this coouthry
he says.says he, raised by the dimi
ggs and other peeple who disagree
with me. They must quit it, he
says, they're bad citizens.heed tbem
not. This coonthry isn't going to
the ditnnition bow-wows, be says,
an there's no use in Misther Bry
an sayin so. The poor folks should
wurruk and eat their vitt'esand he
happy and continted. Aa there's
too many naygurs being lynched,
he says, fays iheyjs jRVqiaitU.
Ii's wrong to tang1 iiaygt-?" with-

bastely crime, but bans, em by

Aa the thrusts are uJt a bJ,
says he.tbere's good thrusts aa bad
thrusts, good ox,rport'oas and bad
corporations. Ye must separate
tbe shape from tbe goats, he says,
says he, and ye must keep your
goats ir. the lot with a high fence,
so they can't butt into your cab
bage patches aa kitchens an ate np
your tin cans. It's ragilation we
need, gentlemen, he says.
"Education is a foine thing, says
Tid y, but there's intoirely too
much of it going into tbe heads of
the risin ginration where it will lay
round in corners and rust. What
we need, he says, says be, is to
tbrain tbe childtrn to dhraw watter
an milk tbe cows, and turn the
grind stone and make bricka brack.
An tbe farmer is foine gintlemen.
says he. His is a mosth honorable
profession and he deserves more
credit than mosth any cne excipt
the man who wurruks. Our Ameri
can farmer is a good man for he
pays the tariff and gets good crops
in rayturn. He Ioikes to help build
up our great an growin infant in
dustries. If he wants to know
iny thing about hisbizness heshould
addhress Misther James Wilson,'
me sicritary of agriculthure,
which is tbe same as farmin, an
enclose a self-addhressed. stamped
envelope, and Misther Wilson will
till niia how Kj raise pratees, an
kill bugs an kepe his cow from
jumpin the fince.
"Another thin.he says Finneg
an.there's too much rayspktfortbe
judges in this coonthry for the well
bein of society at large. If a judge
is coutimptible, ye should tell him
so, so he'll mend his ways. Atsd
this thing of race suicide must be
stopped instintly. I'm raylibly in ,
formed that there's a family down
in Chickasha, Oklahoma, that has
only ten childern and I'm told that
they're about to put a provision in
n their constitoosion limiting fami
lies to twenty-five childern. If
they do, I won't give 'em statehood.
"An the nations must be good.

throy each other with, but to kape
ye from nghtin. We must thrain
our childern so shoot, says he, so
iverybody will be afraid of us and
we won't have to scrao.
Wan of the things that disthurbs
me peace of mind, says he,- is the
bad manners shown by the paople of
San Fraucisco in not admitting the
little brown boys to their schools,
says he. It's naughty an may of-
find me good frind, the Micaydo
and plunge us into a dhreadful war.
I'm a man of pace an righteous

me. It would pain me fatherly
breast to chastise me childern in
San Francisco, but if they don't

"No"says Misther Hooligan, ye'U
have to take a waak off and rade it
fof yourself if ye want to know all
about thrusts and combinations, the

branches of human knowlege. Or
betther still, ye might save time by
just radin the congressional record
