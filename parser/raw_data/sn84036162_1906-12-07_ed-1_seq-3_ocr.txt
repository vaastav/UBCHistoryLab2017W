Ariz., came down the San Francisco
river and Chase creek at night. The

was almost completely ruined. From
seven to twenty persons is the report
of the loss of life. The name of only
one victim, however, has been ob
tained, Mrs. Joseph Thron, who, with
her husband and children, was caught
in a falling building and killed.
The other members of the family
had narrow escapes. One of the sa
loons which was washed away carried
several men into the torrent and they
are believed to have been drowned.
A number of small frame buildings
in which people were known to be liv
ing were destroyed and it is feared
