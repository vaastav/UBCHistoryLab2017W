The Starved Union Prisoners.
The statements of the Union surgeons
just released from Libby Pi Gun give a sad
picture of the barbarities of the rebel au
thorities at Richmond, and of the dreadful
mortality among the Union prisoners in
their hands.
The prevailing diseases among them arc
diarrhoea, and typhoid pneumonia. The
average mortality in the three hospitals and
in the tobacco factories, and upon the island
arc about fifty per day or fifteen hundred
monthly. A thousand are under treatment
in the three hospitals, and the rebel sur
geons say the number of patients are only
limited by the small accommodations. And
all this large amount of sick, to say noth
ing of the well, are receiving only corn bread
and siceet potatoes. Meat is only furnished
to a few officers in Libby hospital.
The first demand of the poor creatures from
the island was always for something to eat.
Self-respect gone, hope and ambition gone,
half clad and covered with vermin and filth,
many of them are too often beyond all reach
of medical skill. In one instance the am
bulances brought sixteen to the hospital, and
during the night seven of these died. Again,
eighteen were brought, and eleven of them
died in twenty-four hours. At .another time
fourteen were admitted, and in a single day
ten of them died. Judging from what we
have ourselves seen and do know, we do not
hesitate to say that, under a treatment of
aystematic abuse, neglect and semi-starva
tion, the numbers who are becoming per
manently broken down in their constitu
must be reckoned by thousands.
• The rebel daily papers in general terms j
acknowledge the truth of all we have affirm
ed, but usually dose their abusive editorials
by declaring that even such treatment is
better than the invading Yankees justly de
serve.
The Examiner recently closed one of its
articles about the prisoners b} T eulogizing
this system of semi-starvation and exposure
well calculated to dispose of these poor
creatures.
Recently several hundred prisoners per
day were removed to Danville. In two in
stances we were standing in view of them
as tlu ir ranks filed past. It was a sad sight
to sec the attenuated features and pallid
faces of men a fe w months since robust and
in vigorous health. Numbers were without
shoes, nearly all without blankets or over
coats. and not a man did we see who was
well and fully clad.
To the honor of the brave sufferers be it
said, with heroic fortitude under all their
sufferings, they spurn the idea that the
government has forgotten them, but hold
fast their confidence in the final and speedy
success of our cause.
“Man * inhumanity to man makes countless thousands
mourn."
But there is a Judge, seated on a great
and mighty throne, who will judge the do
ings of men in his own good time.
CM late an organized system of relief has
been brought about, by which clothing, pro
visions, etc., are sent to them on the truce
boats from Fort Monroe, the rebels agreeing
to deliver them to specified agent prisoners*
and by them distributed to those in need.
Proclamation by the President.
In view of the recent victories at Chatta
nooga by Gen. Grant, and the defeat of Long
street at Knoxville, the President has issued
the following Proclamation, which we con
sider very apportune :
Executive Mansion, Washington, I). C., Dec. 7.
Reliable information having been received
that the insura nts’ force is retreating from
East Tern .under circumstances ren
dering it \ ..able that the Union forces can
not be hereafter dislodged from that import
ant position, and esteeming this to be of
high National consequence, 1 recommend
that all loyal people do, on receipt of this
information, assemble at their places of wor
ship, and render special homage and grati
tude to Almighty God for this great advance
of the National cause.
(Signed) Aeraham Lincoln.
The New Speaker,
Hon ix-Jii VLEB Colfax, of Indiana, was el
ected Speak >r of the House on the first bal
lot by nine majority. No better choice
could have been made. Though compara
tively a young man, he has been for many
years in Congress. To fins large experience
in legislation, he unites the quickness of ap
prehension and the urbanity of manners
which peculiarly tit iui for the difficult
and important position to which he has been
chosen.
Mr. Colfax is an editor by profession,
snd publishes the South Bend JiegUttr.
A Good Joce.—At the late draft at Prai
rie du Cbien a copper-headed individual
present set up a howl of unfairness, saying
the draft officers had it all fixed to take the
Democrats and let the Abolitionists go free.
He was then called up, blind-folded and told
to do the drawing himself. The first name
drawn by him was h e J*',! He badnoth
'cf more to say.
Late NeWs.
The news from Grant is all contraband,
which shows that he is not idle.
Longs tree t in his assault upon Fort San
ders, 'at Knoxville, Tern, lost about a thou
sand men, and then had to raise the siege
and beat a hasty retreat towards Virginia,
closely followed by Gen. Sherman.
Meade has recrossed the Rapielan back,
and reports says has gone into winter quar
ters. Re this as it may, one thing is pretty
certain, he will keep Lee busy watching
Richmond while the gallant Grant will con
tinue to drive the rebels in the West nearef
the “last ditch.”
Gilmore’s “Swamp Angel," is again send
ing its compliments to the Charlestonians
at the rate of about twenty-five “cards” per
day, each weighing from 250 to 500 pounds.
Old Ben. Butler is again at work organ
izing black cavalry regiments in the Caro
linas. One peculiarity of Butler is, he al
ways makes his rear matters pay their own
way.

Amusing Letter From Col. Callis.
The Grant County Ileiald prints the
following amusing and singular letter
from one of the brave men of that
County now in hospital, suffering from
a gun-shot wound. The Col. appears
to he grit to the hack-bone —determin-
ed never to say die. But here is the
letter, short and to the point :
U. S A. oor oral Hospital,)

Friend Cover.—You told me when
I left that I was going too soon. I did
not think so but now I know It ; I
started sooner than I should, from the
fact that I knew existing orders made

subject to an honorable discharge, even
without their approval. I wish I was
at home instead of this place. I have
been suffering intense pain since I esme
here ; until within a short time I have

feel so much pain since. I expect to
raise my loots yet !
The Medical Director has taken the
piece of shirt and is going to send it to

try and mine for the ball, but this I
can’t stand. I told him if he attempt

The Close of the War.
Many of the leading presses are predict
ing a speed}' close of the Rebellion, affirm
ing that the spring will probably open upon
a restored Union. We wish it might be so,
but we see no good reason to expect it.
And we advise our readers not to prepare
themselves for disappointment by looking
for a sudden and speedy end of the war.
Those who look merely to outward appear
ances, and whose judgments are based on
their hopes and on the results of a decisive
battle or two, rat nor than on fundamental
are liable to be deceived ; but
those who believe this conflict is governed
by immutable laws, and regard the princi
ples which underlie and control the opera
tions of Governments and people, are best
qualified to judge respecting the termina
tion of this strife. The prime obstacle to
the speedy suppression of the Rebellion from
the beginning, has been, a divided North.
There were men in high places all over the
North, in league with the Southern conspi
rators before the first gun was fired at Sum
ter. And the number of traitors at the
North during the whole course of the war
has been very large —far larger than many
supposed. In many localities they greatly
exceeded in numbers the loyal population.
And those localities were uniformly those
in which the pro-slavery Dtmocvacy had I
complete sway. The disloyal people of the
North may be regarded under three classes;
1. The Irish Catholics, the great body of
whom are intensely pro-slavery.
3. The German catholics and German
Democrats, less virulently pro-slavery, and
therefore less tinctured with disloyalty than
the Irish.
3. The thoroughly pro-slavery, including
the demagogues among the native born pop
ulation in the Democratic barty.
All those classes are opposed to the Ad
ministration and to its war measures to sup
press the rebellion, and especially to the
Emancipation Proclamation, and thus give
aid and comfort to the rebels. Practically,
as far as they can do it without overt acts
of treason, they oppose the Government,
and sympathize with and aid the rebellion.
Had the North, from the first, been a unit
for liberty as the South is for slavery, and
upheld the Government with the earnest
ness and energy with which the South has
sought to overthrow it, the war might long
ago have been ended.
The pro-slavery spirit of the North, too,
prevented the Government for a long time
from emancipating the slaves of rebels and
invoking their aid in this contest, and m
this way has proved the most formidable
obstacle to the suppression of the rebellion.
Many of the soldiers and officers who had
volunteered, with expectations of honor and
profit, under the belief that it would he a
brilliant war, when the question of calling
in the help of the slaves was first sincerely
proposed, scouted the idea of fighting side
by side with black men, the officers declar
ing they would sooner resign and go home.
And though there has been a marked im
provement in the army, and the number of
disloyal men at the North has greatly dimin
ished, yet the number of this class is still
large enough to hinder the progress of the
war and embarrass the Government.
This conflict will continue till the disloyal
and pro-slavery spirit of the North is over
come—till slavery is put down at the South
and the manhood and rights of the slaves
are recognized and protected throughout
the Union. When the North becomes a
unit for liberty, justice and free government,
foreign nations will renounce forever all in
tention of interference, and the South will
give up all hope of success.
This war is not the result of an accident,
or of a political blunder, nor the product
of political ambition. It is the natural and
inevitable result of the conflict of opposing
principles—the legitimate issue of the vain
attempt to harmonize liberty and slavery
under one Government—to make slave la
bor and free labor equally prosperous under
the same laws and conditions. It is the
just penalty enforced against wrong-doers
for persistent violations of the laws of na
ture and of God. And this conflict will
continue till liberty or slavery triumph.
And every movement to preserve slavery is
in effect a movement to prolong the war.
Tell us when the North is ready to blot out
slavery, and lift up the slave to the plane of
human rights, to the common level of hu
manity, and we will tell you when it is ready
to put an end to this Rebellion, AVe shall
have peace just as soon as the nation is pre
pared for it by repentance and reformation.
To those who do not believe in an over
ruling Providence our position may seem
untenable. We cannot stop to argue with
such. There is no such thing as cheating
Eternal Justice or evading the eternal laws.
And this is the hour of the nation’s judg
ment. Neither Presidents, nor Congresses,
nor people can turn it aside. AVe are now
drinking the cup of trembling. AVe may
harden our hearts, as Pharaoh, till the land
is filled with mourning, till our loins are
covered with sackloth, and not one house is
left in which there is not one dead. But
when the nation is prepared to let the op
pressed go free, the dreadful scourge of war
will be lifted from us. And if, like Pha
raoh, the nation seeks again to oppress the
bond-men after they are once let go, it may
expect a return of calamities.
The lesson taught by this war is, that no
nation can practice injustice with impunity
—that the Most High ruleth over the na
tions, and executeth judgment in the earth
—that what we sow we must reap. The
indications now arc that the South, when
this war has done its work, is more ready
for emancipation than the North. Mary
land and Missouri have got far in advance
of the Lincoln Administration, and we have
had the strange spectacle of representative
delegates embodying the loyal sentiment of
the Northern Slave States beseeching the
Administration to favor liberty and not
! slavery, in its appointments and policy.
I AVe look with great anxiety and hope for
| the President’s message. If he should rec
ommend the entire abolition of slavery
throughout the Union, the beginning of
the end of the war and .of the rebellion will
have been reached, and the foundation of
a reign of perpetual peace hav£ been laid.

Seward’s Speech at Gettysburg.
In response to a serenade at Gettysburg
on the occasion of the National Ceme
tery meeting, Mr. Seward appeared on
the balcony of his hotel and spoke as
follows.
Fellow Citizens : I am now sixty
years old and upward ; I have been in
public life practically forty years of that
time, and yet this is the first time that
ever any people or community so near
to the border of Maryland v.as found
willing to listen to my voice ; and the
reason was, I said forty years ago that
slavery was opening before this people
a graveyard that was to be filled with
brothers falling in mutual political com
bat. I knew that the cause that was
hurrying the Union into this dreadful
strife was slavery and when I did elevate
my voice it was to warn the people to
remove that cause when they could by
constitutional means, and so avert the
catastrophe of civil war that now unhap
pily has fallen upon the nation, delug
ing it in blood. That crisis came, and
we see the result.
I am thankful that you arc willing to
hear me at last. I thank my God that
I believe this strife is going to end in
the removal of that evil which ought to
have been removed by peaceful means
and deliberate councils. [Good.] I
thank ray God for the hope that this is
the last fratricidal war which will fall
upon the country, a country vouchsafed
by Heaven, the richest, the broadest,
most beautiful, most magnificent and
Capacious ever yet bestowed upnoa peo
pie, that has ever been given to any part
of the human race. [Applause.] And
I thank God for the hope that when the
cause is removed, simply the operation
of abolishing it, as the origin of the
(jreat treason that is without justification
and without parallel , we shall thence
forth he united, he only one country , hav
ing only one• hope , one ambition and one
destiny. [Applause.] Then we shall
know that wc are not enemies, but that
we are friends and brothers ; that this
Union is a reality ; and wc shall mourn
together for the evil wrought by this re
bellion.
AVe are now near the graves of the
misguided, whom we have consigned to
their last resting-place \vith pity for
their errors, and with hearts full of grief
with which we mourn over the brother
by whose hand, raised in defense of his
G overnment, that misguided brother per
ished. When we part to-morrow night,
let us remember that wc owe it to our
country and to mankind that this war
shall have for its conclusion the estab
lishing of the principle of democratic
government —the simple principle that,
whatever party, whatever portion of the
Union prevails by consitutional suffrage
in an election, that party is to be res
pected and maintained in power until H
shall give place on another trial and an
other verdict, to a different portion of
the people. (Good.) If you do not do
that, you are drifting at once and irre
sistibly to the very verge of the destruc
tion of your government. But with
that principle this government of ours
—the freest, the best, the wisest, and the
happiest in the world —must be, and, so
far as we are concerned, practically will
be, immortal (Applause.)
U. S. 5-20’S.
The Secretary of the Treasury has not yet given
notice of any intention to withdraw this popular Loan
from Sale at Par, and until ten days notice is given'
the undersigned, as “General Subscription Agent,”
will continue to supply the public.
The whole amount of the Loan authorized is Five
Hundred Millions of Dollars. Nearly Four Hun
dred Millions have rf.f.n already subscribed for
and paid into THE Treasury, mostly within iho last
seven months. The largo demand from abroad, and
the rapidly increasing home demand fur use as the
basis for circulation by National Ranking Associations
now organizing in all parts of the country, will, in a
very short period, absorb the balance. Sales have
lately ranged from tea to fifteen millions weekly, fre
quently exceeding three millions daily, and as it is
well known that the Secretary of the Treasury has am
ple and unfailing resources in the Duties on Imports
and Interna I Revenues, and in the Issue of the Interest
bearing Legal Tender Treasury Notes, it is almost a
certainty that he will not find it necessary, for a long
time to come, to seek a market for any other long or
permanent Loans, THE INTEREST AND PRINCI
PAL OF WHICH ARE PAYABLE IN GOLD.
Prudence and self interest must force tlie minds of
those contemplating the formation of National Rank
ing Associations, as well as the minds of all who have
idle money on their hands, to the prompt conclusion
that they should lose no time in subscribing to this
most popular Loan. It will soon be beyond their reach
and advance to a handsome premium, as was the re
sult with the “F ren Thirty” Loan, when it was all
sold and could r. longer be subscribed for at par.
It is a Six per Ce. t Loan, the Interest and Prin
cipal payable in Coin, thus yielding ovpu Nine per
Cent, per Annum at the present rate of premium on
coin.
The Government requires all duties on imports to be
paid in Coin ; these duties have for a long time past
amounted to over a Quarter of a Million of Dollar
daily, a sum nearly throe times greater than ihat re
quired in the payment of the interest qp all of the o-20s
and other permanent Loans, bo that it is hoped that
the surplus Coin in the Treasury, at no distant day, will
enable the Uc’ted States to resume specie payments
upon all ’..abilities.
The Loan is called 5-2 C from the fact that whilst the
Loaus may ro.i for 20 years yet the Government hag
a right to pay them off iu Goldat par, at any time after
5 years.
The Interest is paid half-teaeit, viz : on the first
days of November am! May.
Subscribers can have Coupon Bonds, which are pay
able to bearer, and are SSO SI 00 SSOO and SIOOO ; or
.Registered Bonds of the same denominations, and in
addition, $5,000 and SIO,OOO. For Banking purposes
and for investements of Trust-monies the Registered
Bonds are preferable
These 5-20’s cannot be taxed by States, cities, towns
or counties, and the Government Uix on them is only
one and a huif per oent. on the amount of income,
when the income of the holder exceeds Six Hundred
dollars per annum ; all otbef investment**, such as in
come from Mortgages, Railroad Slock and Bonds, etc.
must pay from thre eto five per cent tax on the in
ccrne.
Banks and Bankers throughout the country will
continue Indispose of the Bonds ; and all orders by
mail, or otherwise promptly attended to.
The inconvenience of a f-w days’ delay in the delive
ry of the bonds is unavoidable, the demand being so
great : but as interest commences from the day of sub
scription. no loss is occasskned. and every effort i*
beina made to diminish the delay.
