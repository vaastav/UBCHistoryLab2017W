The i u)?jiri.?? I.taared.
The ivf?-ivnee to Cuou is one of the string
points of ?h? President's message. It is
brief. but suftUi- ntly explicit. and it is ad
mirably phrased. It comes as no surprise.
b- ause ir t<?inports *ntir -ly with the Presi
dent's character as a man, and with his
previous deliverances on the same subject.
Th? ? i. rif lit of cunning or bad faith does
not ? nt'-r into the Pr* sident's composition.
There has never been a day since he ap
pr?? v. 1 of the resolution of Congress guar
anteeing to the Cubans an opportunity to
organize an independent government of
th? ir own when he couM have been induced
to depart from that position.
P s a good thing at this time, however,
for th? President to renew as he does his
phage t.i the Cubans. Spanish sovereignty
In the island is about at an end. and Ameri
an ? Ofltrol Is to follow. The Cobsn^ nat
urally. are full of curiosity as to the future.
Sons. T.- very apprehensive. And the fears
af the-*"* are being played upon by the selfish
arid the unscrupulous. It is broadly hinted
: hat American control will become perma
?:?>t through annexation of the island
wh. 11.? r the people favor it or not.
The President's word is sufficient in this
?.iness. Th?- Cubans may rest assured
t ha* in the President they have at once
ste j-ir'?si friend and a wise counsellor, and
they . ould not do a better thing than to
g'.ide r|os- ly by the lines of his declaration
Hut if he assures them, he at the same
time warns them. The length of the Stay
of th? Americans in the island will de
pend upon the- t'ubans themselves. That is
the meaning ol" his words. A stable govern
ment is required, founded upon humane and
progressive principles. No revenges. N?
Efov? rnment by faction for faction. All th<
people of the island are to be considered
Hi) i protected. In other words, what is to
ake Spain's place in Cuba as a permanency
xus? be the very opposite of that whicn
^pain provided and supported while she was
n control.
The task should not be a difficult one for
he Cuban people after they have enjoyed a
?reathing spell. Among their leaders arr
liany wist and capable and patriotic men,
who. taking their cue from the President,
leill loubtlesw exert themselves now to
r?'de t heir countrymen in the right way.
\ tiertuau I.anient.
\ ). oiing tJfrman newspaper is of opinion
that a big auction is in progress at Paris
id ih.it s-'tne very valuable Spanish pos
#es>io?is are going at a very low figure. It
regrets that Germany is not a bidder, and
de. laiv- that had she interfered at the
prop*-! tim. between the I'nited States and
5pain she might aw acquired some choice
rsland properties.
She might and she might not. It all de
pends upon the point of view. The opinion
prevails in the I'nited States that there
never was a proper time for interference
!?. Germany in the quarrel between the
i'nited States and Spain; that it never was
possible for Germany to acquire islands in
thai way. A tar likelier acquisition would
have been a row of first-class proportions,
into whit h Germany would have been none
;?k? well prepared to enter, arid from which
she might nave emerged shorn of some of
t>*?r own possessions. The German opinion
which controverts this is not understood in
rhn* country.
There is no auction it Paris. The 5"nit d
State.* is not bidding for anything Spain
tins What it will acquire as the result of
thos* negotiations it virtually already con
trols. its terms for a peace treaty are
generous, as they should he. but they are
no* open to revision or objection by any
eat side power. The I'nited States will pay
Hpain twenty million dollars for better
ments in the Philippines, but that is no
bid Pads for tne Archipelago have at no
tim* been in order. Germany could not
hav. obtained the property had she raised
that ligure fifty-fold.
A more important and interesting ques
tion than this relates to Spain's probable
our>. r? spec ting the island possessions she
will retain after her commissioners have
Signed away those now demanded by the
I rated States. An auction is suggested

"i'h siirgeon general of the army will

Investigate "the Pritish methoil of taring
for trooj?s in tropica I climates. The infor
mation is to be applied in <*uba and Porto
Rico. This is a timely ami most intelligent
l?roceedii;g, and the good to follow will
probably be very great.
W~ i?hall gain by realizing antl confessing
at the \ery outset that we stand in need
??.' a ?t?o<l deal of information on this suh
J-ct. The held is a new one for us. and we
must enter it at once. We have the facili
?i?!? for applying al! useful knowledge of
-hh? kind. No government cares for its sol
?iiers more generously than ours. No sol
Uers are worthier of such care. The men
?feo will garrison '*t:ba and Porto Rico
have a difficult tank to perform, and
?houid be the objects of the best attentions
it may be In the power ?>f this government
to bestow.
The Knglish have solved the problem
?iMKtfMfuby than any other people.
Their achievements In the tropics have
been as notal?le as elsewhere, anil thcv
I have conquered the climate there to a de
gree almost equal to the dominion they
have established over the soil. The cost
ha? lieen considerable, but they have paid
it like men. They have demonstrated that
th?j white man may make his home in t]ie
tropics and have health there, and their
record with regard to caring for troops un
der a hot sun shines almost like the sun
Itself.
It is most fortunate for us that this rec
ord exists, and that we may hope to inspect
it In all of its leading details in the fash
ioning of our own program. The English
will be as glad to teach us as we should
be to learn of them. They are glad to have
us for near neighbors, and will be at pains
to hc-lp the new settlers with kindly ?u^
g est ions. And if we are wise we shall fol
low pretty closely in the path which they
as pioneers in these mailers have opened.
Our Philippine problem is one upon which
they may throw a good deal of light also.
They have done wonders in India, where ,
the natives opposed as difficult a question
as the climate. While we hold the archi

them on all matters relating to their inter
ests and our own.
M'iren find ConduitM.
In the course of an interview printed iv
yesterday's Star Commissioner Wight, dis
cussing the question of overhead wires in
Washington, expressed the hope that, this
paper would "redouble its efforts for a com
plete system of underground wires." The 1
Star has always been ready to voice the i
protest of th" citizens against a continuance
of the antiquated and dangerous system of j
overhead electrical conductors, and it is
gratified now that there is a prospect that
Congress may be brought to realize the vast
importance to the city of this subject. The
assurance that the Commissioners will press
the matter to the attention of the commit
tees of Congress at this session is gratify
ing. and The Star will most assuredly con
tinue to present the conduit system's many
advantages and the overhead system's many
disadvantages as occasion may offer. The
fight for conduit railways has been won,
as The Star was recently glad to note in
connection with the new work on the Eck
ington line. But there still remains a large
problem t?? be solved, the solution of which
is nevertheless comparatively easy If Con
gress will but assume that the interests tirst
to b' considered in the premises are those of j
the people and not those of the corporations
whose wires now encumber the air and
threaten the public.
Senators and representatives should take
note of the occasional demonstrations of j
danger which the overhead wires present.
Saturday brought forth two such. An elec
tric lighting wire in some way grounded
against a tin roof on an F street building
and burned a hole in the metal covering and
set lire to the rafters beneath. A telephone
wire in Eckinglon sagged in the storm
until it crossed a tire-alarm wire and shut
out of service the boxes nearest the disas
trous conflagration at the car barns, caus
ing much costly delay and handicapping
the tire service in its efforts to cope with
the flames. In each case the existence of a
conduit system would have avoided the evil.
\o "Al^erimn" in the Menage.
The New i??rk Herald today expresses its
regret that the President in his annual
message did noi specifically refer to what
ir is pleased to term "Algorism." It doubt
less means thereby to suggest that the
President was remiss in his public duty
when he failed to devote part of his mes
sage t?? a discussion of the sorrows of the
soldiers incidental to their life in camp and
at the front This term "Algerism" Is in
some quarters regarded as broadly descrip
tive of a certain system or perhaps lack of
system which has been charged with the
responsibility for the sufferings of the sol
diers. The Herald seems to think that be
cause the President is siic-nt on the subject
he is disposed to cover up the record. This
appears to bt an unjust suspicion. The
President has taken steps to ascertain tlie
reasons why the soldiers sickened and died
ir. the camps and in the hospitals, why
they did not have sufficient food and cloth
ing. why they were at times without medi
cal supplies, and why a good many un
pleasant things happened which some peo
ple believe to have been avoidable. He lias
assembled a commission composed of intel
ligent and a presumably capable investiga
tors. who have been diligently at work for
several weeks inquiring into every phase
of the case which lies within their reach.
Th' only question now to be met is whether
the President, in his annual message to
Congress, should have mentioned this un
finished investigation. The Star does not
think that he was called upon by any con
sideration to advance the subject in this
connection. To suggest that Congress
might investigate the conduct of the war
would be to discredit his own agency for
barning the facts. To present an incom
plete reference to the subject would doubt
less lead to acrimonious and uninformed
deb-11? . while the inquiry continued in pro
gress. demoralizing to the army and doubt
less as well to the commission and discred
iting us unnecessarily abroad. Judging the
future by the past. It Is safe to anticipate
that when the commission has presented its
report the President will be heard from in
terms as clear and suggestive as those
with which, in yesterday's message, he to d
Congress the story of the war with Spain.

Tlie i oiidiiil Sj?teni an Snow Time.
Paring the recent heavy snow storm in
New > ork city the transportation lines
w?re badly blockaded, especially thos^
which aTe operated by electricity. Ina<
much a?1 th city of New York has always
rigorously excluded the overhead trolley
from its predrcts the underground electric
roads are r.ow coming in for a certain
share of criticism for their supposed in
ability to opt rat? in a heavy snow fall.
Thi< Is essentially unfair, for a reason
which U easily made plain. When snow
falls in a certain temperature, such as that
which prevailed in New York th;? other
day. it has a tendency to ni' lt Immediately
upon touching the Iron rails of the car
tracks, only to frcoxe almost as qnickly.
thus producing a thin coating cf ice on the
rails which forms a practical insulator.
The New York electric-roads, and doubtless
most of thorn- now in use in this country,
are run upon the single cable system, send
ing the current back to the generating sta
tion by means of the rails. When the rails
are coated with ice this return Is impossi
ble, the current l? checked and the cat
stops. The same thing happens to the
overhead trolley roads. In fact to any road
which runs by electricity and Completes the
circuit by means of the rails and the earth.
So I ha*. lh? ?topp*f? of conduit roads
by the snow In no wise bear.-* upon the ef
ficiency of the system, which, under dif
f< rent circumstances, has been found to
cope effectually with the elements, eve;,
under severe handicaps. The real lesson of
the snow storm in New York and the con
sequent blockade of the electric lines is
that the roads should be equipped with the
double conductor system, abandoning the
old-fashioned and dangerous method of re
lying upon the rails for the return of the
current. It is the latter plan which causes
the electrolysis in the cities, destroying wa
ter and gas mains, killing trees, softening
asphalt and even threatening the integrity
of the sky-scrapers and bridges. If in ad
dition to these items of destruction it ie*
now found that the transportation system
is in danger of being checked on this ac
count whenever the snow falls doubtless
the railway companies will be willing to
adopt the costly but more reliable process
of double conductors.
Several gentlemen who have made it their
ambition to subjugate Mr. Reed will be

'mm the Philadelphia Inquirer.
Of the minor recommendations made by
['resident McKinley In his message to Con
gress none is at once mor? time y and more
mportant than his suggestion that the cen
ennial of the founding of tin* city of Wash
ngton shall b?- made a notable event. Only
x little more than a year remains in which
o accomplish that result, and comrnemora
ions of a national character cannot be ar
ranged in a day. The President recom
iiends that a eonimittee to undertake the;
management of the project be appointed
ind mat Congress make an appropriation
'or the purpose. As the head of a nation
hat is soon to celebrate so important an
?vent he could do nothing less.
The President says but little on the sub
ject. but it is obvious that he feels deeply.
W ashington is today a beautifu. city, but
t does not yet begin to do justice to the
:reat people who own it as their seat of
government. It is his idea that there
should be some lasting memorial of the
>ccasion, something which will teach com
ng generations that the people of this age
vere not without artistic aspirations and
latriotistn. Had he argued for two or three
such memorials he would not have gone
.00 far. As he says, the people of the
?ountry are justly proud of their capital
?ity. and they have a right to be. Hut the
vork of making that city beautiful has
>nly begun. If an arch of any character be
irected there, it should be one of Importance
md of artistic merit. Those who would
>rotest against such an outlay are of so
;ma?l a proportion of the population that
heir voices would scarcely be heard, and
?ven if heard, would be of no consequence
?onipared with the overwhelming jentimenr
n its favor.
I^et us face this subject in a patriotic
spirit. The erection of triumphal or histor
cai arches should not end the work here
?ecommended. Paris is today the most
>eautiful city in the world, because the
>eople of France have spent millions of
lollars year after year in adorning its
Greets with just such memories as the
^resident has in mind. With its enormous
?esourees this nation should equal the re
su ts achieved in the French capital. The
loblest statues of our heroes should adorn
nore of its prominent streets. Its rivers
should be soanned by the most beautiful
>ridges. Its streets should be further im
iroved. if that is possible. A thousand rea
sons for such a policy come easily to mind.
S'o foreigner visits this country without
visiting the capital and without returning
.0 his own country to tell what he saw.
S'o native citizen goes thither without hav
ng his patriotism stirred and feeling more
md more Inclined to light more determin
edly for his country. These are the great
?easons for carrying out the presidential
?ecommeiidation. It need not be feared
hat there will not be any adequate return
or the amounts expended. The cost to so
Treat a people would not be felt, and every
where the effect would be to enhance the
>restige of the whole people among the na
ions of the world.
It is hazarding little to predict that the
committee for which the President has
ssk.-'i will be named and that an gppropria
ion will be made, but there should be no
naif-way business in the orcmises. The
'omrm morition should be a notable one and
?should carry the fame of the Cnit^d States
o the farthest corners of the earth.

That Boylog of the Eflsemraan Silks
Has Set Us on the Throne!
We're the kings of the silk land this week! And the realm that's
ours spreads all over the universe. Eiseman Bros. were the biggest
handlers of the fabric in the United States. Their ware houses at Grand
and Wooster streets held more stock than any one place in creation.
And WE picked over all that monster assemblage of silken beauty and
culled its supremest prizes and picked out all the rare colorings?the
shades that everybody wants?the patterns that were full of taste and
elegance?the exquisite qualities. Had our choice before all the firms
in the broad Americas.
This coup would stamp us as illustrious merchandisers had our past
tareer been without a single spark of enterprise. And the crowds of yes
terday and those this morning have been pushing and thronging about
the silk counters all dav. Lunch hour doesn't seem to lessen the jam.
W omen of Washington want Eiseman silks, and they'll get thousands
01 yards before the week's through. Get the best silks that can be
loomed, get the daintiest conceits that can be created. Get the most as
t<funding values?if prices are a gauge?that were ever showered.
