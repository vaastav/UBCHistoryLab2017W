The Plan Brings Out Many Expressions of
Satisfaction and Clears Up u Situation
Which Wus Becoming Alarming Meet
ing of the Banking and Currency Com
intttoo of the Ilouse Tomorron,
"Washington, Dec. 14. Secretary
Gage will appear before the housa com
mittee on hanking and currency on
Thursday and submit to it in tho form
of a general bill his recommendations
recently made to congress. This deter
mination on the part of the secretary
to submit one generarfinancial bill in
stead of a number of separate bifls has
brought out many expressions of satis
faction. It cleared up a situation which
was becoming alarming. It is under
stood that he was advised by Mr. Ding
ley and others that it would be desira
ble to send in one general bill. Later
it was made known that Mr. Gage pre
ferred to let the subject go over until
after the holiday recess.
The committee urged, however, that
it desired to take the Gage bill and also
that submitted by the monetary con
ference under consideration during the
holidays in order to be in a position to
report progress when the house recon
vened. It was decided therefore that
Mr. Gage should submit his measure on
Thursday and explain and argue its
merits and answer questions from the
. committee. It was also made clear
that the secretary would cover all his
proposals in one general bill. The
members of the committee then can
vassed the course they would take as
to making an Immediate report to the
house on currency Questions. It was
decided that the first thing to be done
was to report a bill embodying the
three features recommended by the
president, viz., a reduction of tax on
circulation to one-half per cent.; the
issuance of circulation up to the par
value of bonds deposited and the estab
lishment of small banks in rural com
munities. While these will be embodied in the
Gage plan, yet as they were especially
advised in the president's message it
was felt to be advisable to give the
house the opportunity of acting on
them at once without waiting for the
report on the Gage bill. For these
reasons the full committee will be asked
to report on the president's plans at
once. The draft of a bill has been pre
pared by Mr. Brosius of Pennsylvania,
arid this was given to the solicitor of
the treasury, .who is to return it in
time for action by the committee, with
such suggestions as the treasury au
thorities may wish to make. The com
prehensive Gage bill and the monetary
conference bill will be gone over with
care during the holidays and members
of the banking and currency committee
say there is no doubt that action will
be reported to the house soon after the
holidays.

Proposed Additions to the Prerogatives of
. the Minority.
Washington. Dec. 14. A new code of
rules for the house of representatives
will be presented by Speaker Reed and
his associates on the committee on
rules after the holiday recess. At pres
ent the house is proceeding under the
rules of two years ago, these having
been adopted pending the framing of
new rules. The present purpose is to
readopt the old rules without important
changes. ''
Representative Barrett, rep., of Mas
sachusetts, is to be given a hearing at
an early day on two amendments which
he proposes. One of these seeks to give
the minority larger rights than it en-
lioys at present in presenting amend
tnents and substitutes, and in securing
time during debate. Although not a
member of the democratic minority, Mr.
Barrett says that, as a matter of lair
ness, the rules should be changed so
as to give the minority' art" opportunity
to be heard, and have its propositions
voted upon, during the consideration of
every question. He is also urging a
change by which an amendment to an
appropriation bill will be in order when
the subject has been acted on favor
ably in either house or has been recom
mended by the head of a department.
At present the rules are very strict
against amendments of this character.
LOWELL DEPOT GUTTED.
The rlace Where Iate General Butler's
Body Laid in State.
Lowell, Mass., Dec. 14. The Merri
mack street depot of the Boston and
Maine, In the upper stories of which
are Huntington and Jackson halls, was
gutted by fire to-night. The blaze
started in the rear of the building and
spread rapidly, illuminating the entire
business district of the city. The fire
men managed to check the fire, al
though only a shell was left. The rail
road people saved their property In the
station and the Adams Express com
pany rescued all of their packages.
The building was constructed in 1853
and has been to Lowell what Faneiul
hall Is to Boston. It was here that
the body of the late General B. F. But
ler was laid In state and here many
historic gatherings occurred. It Is im
possible to estimate the loss at present.
The city owned the building.

NATIONAL ROAM) Oi' TRADE. I
Executive Cnmmittco's Keport on Cur.
roucy Questiun Civil Service.
Washington, Dec. 14. The national
board of trade met here to-day for its
twenty-eighth annual session, ex-Governor
Stannard of St. Louis presiding in
the absence of Mr. Frederick Farley of
Philadelphia, who has been president
of the board since Ub organization in
1888.. The executive committee made its
annual report, which was adopted with
out a dissenting vote. On the subject
of the currency, the report says:
Probably there is no subject which is
still of such importance as that of tho
currency. While the great uprising in
favor of sound money in 1806 was not
without its good effect, there Is still
much to be desired in the way of a per
manent prosperity, which condition is
mainly due to the fact that the future
of our monetary system is still largely
in doubt. To some the free silver or
fiat money question is paramount and
all considerations of currency reform
will be made subservient thereto. The
only way to meet this is by persistent
education."
One of the most important reports
presented and adopted was that of
Jonathan A. Lane of Boston on tho
reform of the consular service. The
report advocated the extension of the
civil service rules to cover the consular
service to the end of securing practical
business men in the service rather than
purely political appointees.

tion of resolutions defining the party
policy on the questions of Cuba, finance
and bankruptcy. The caucus was
largely attended, 101 of the 125 demo
cratic members being present. Repre
sentative Richardson of Tennessee act
ed as chairman and Representatives
Cummlngs of New York and Cowherd

tend the privilege of national banks or
to reduce the taxes which they now
pay.

condition of war exists in the island of
Cuba between the government of Spain
and the Cuban people.

The resolutions on finance and Cuba
were considered separately, the discus
sion being vigorous and unanimously
favorable. Mr. Bailey made the main
speech, urging that democratio memT
bers should take their position promptly
against those financial movements now
assuming formidable dimensions owing
to the recommendations given to them
by the president and secretary of the
treasury. lie also spoke for a clear cut
position in favor of the recognition of
Cnban belligerency and embodied in

Charged With Murder.
New York, Dec. 14. Charles Zanoli,

n.urder of Jennie Suhmer, his fourth
and last wife, by the use of poison or
some other means. The charge was
made as the result of the preliminary
examination upon the body of Jennie
Suhmer, which was exhumed yesterday.
The death certificate of that woman

death. The aliidavit, charging Zanoli
with homicide, asked that Zanoli might
be held for sufficient time to enable
the prosecution to produce proper evi
dence. The crime is stated to have tak
en placo on August 9 last.

Memorial Building.
Washington, Dec. 14. A meeting of

discussed plans for a George Washing
ton memorial building in connection
with the proposed national university
building in this city. It is proposed to

university. One of the several plana
suggested was that $25,000 should be
raised in time to lay the corner stone of
the building in December, 1899. It was
also suggested that February 22, Wash
ington's birthday, be made a day of na
tional offering to the fund and that the
children of the public schools through
out the country be invited to contribute
one cent each, to tho fund.
Among those present were the chair

Mrs. Clara R. Anthony, Massachusetts;
Miss Charlotte Bailey, Rhode Island;

Will Not Stand a Constant Reduction ISO
Men Out.
Haverhill, Mass., Dec. 14. The first
strike of shoeworkers against a con
stant reduction occurred this afternoon'
in the factory of Thayer, McGuire &
Field on River street, and at labor
headquarters to-night it was said that
about 150 workmen will remain away
from the shop to-morrow, closing all
departments except the tipping and
cutting rooms. The reduction was or
dered last week in certain departments,
the cut varying from 15 to 30 per cent.,
according to the workmen's statements.
Several attempts at a compromise have

Washington, Dec. 14. The house com

of the late John Roach, the Chester,
Pa., shipbuilder, appropriating $330,151
for labor, material, dockage, detention
and occupation of yards and shops for

of the plant ns to make the continuance
and completion of the three cruisers
named impossible.

Health Ofllcer Wright's Keport Othor
DEatters Considered
At the meeting of the board of health,
yesterday afternoon, Attorney J. P.
Goodhart, counsel for Mrs. Vaughan,
the location of whose maternity hospital
on Prospect Place is objected to by near
by residents, appeared and asked that
Mrs. Vaughan be given leave to with
draw temporarily her application for a
transfer of her license for a maternity
hospital from No. 45 Stevens street to
No. 8 Prospect Place. Mr. Goodhart
represented to the board that Mrs.
Vaughan had applied for the transfer
without advice of counsel and said that
he held that the license granted her to
do business on Stevens street gave her
an equal right to conduct the hospital
on Prospect Place, the person and not
the place being involved in the license.
He stated that the question was before
the court for decision and pending the
action of the court he desired the appll-
ation withdrawn.
Attorney C. S. Morehouse appeared to
present the parties who protest
against Mrs. Vaughan's conducting the
hospital on Prospect Place and gave
notice that he would later ask for a
revocation of Mrs. Vaughan's license.
The board of health later voted to give
Mrs. Vaughan leave to withdraw, tem
porarily her application for a. transfer
of her license.
Health Officer Wright submitted to
the board his report for the month of
November. He reported 31 cases of
diphtheria with seven deaths resulting,
tl cases of scarlet fever, no deaths;
seven cases of typhoid fever, three of
hich were in the First ward, three
eaths resulting. One hundred and
thirty deaths were reported for the
month against 163 for tho corresponding
month last year. Twenty-nine of the
eaths last month were of children un
er five years of age; thirty-four were
of persons over sixty years of age. The
ealth officer also reported fifty-one
uisances abated last month and forty-
five houses disinfected for contagious
iseases. Dr. Wright called attention
to the fact that while for the past ten
ears there has been an arrangement
between the board of health and the
selectmen regarding the care of patients
at the pest house, it wns now necessary
to enter into an arrangement with the
board of charities and correction, the
old town government having been done
away with. He recommended that a
committee be appointed to confer with
the charities board in regard to the
matter. His report was accepted, the
recommendation adopted and he was
appointed a committee of one to see the
charities board. The old arrangement
wherebv the board of health furnished
physicians and nurses for the pest
house patients while the town furnished
the house, food, attendants, will prob
ably be continued.
The board voted to Insist upon the re
moval of a vault at No. 53 Whalley
avenue on property owned by L. H
Johnson, who appeared to protest
against the order. An invitation was
e ceived from the secretary of the Mich
gan state board of health for the presl-
dent of the New Haven board to attend
the celebration of the quarterly cenlcti
nial of the establishment of the Michl
gan state board of health, O be held in
Detroit in July, 1S9S.
L. F. Grady, a plumber, was before
the board on the charge of not having
complied with the ordinance in placing
the ventilating pipes in a new house at
Henry street. It is required that
ventilating pipes over twenty feet In
length shall be one and one-half Inch
pipes and tho inspector has reported
that Mr. Grady placed at No. 53 Henry
street a ventilation pipe seventy feet in
length and only one and one-half inch
pipe. In executive session the inspector
was directed to state in writing to Mr.
Grady the cause of complaint, and it
was voted that Mr. Grady should be
required to properly fix the piping with
in seven days after receiving such no
tice.

Speaks on "Censorship of Press as Factor
in Modern Political Life."
Buffalo, N. Y., Dec. 14. Charle9 Em
ory Smith, editor of the Philadelphia
Press, wtis the guest of the Independent
club at a dinner this eveing. President
Hotchkiss presided. At the table with
the distinguished visitors were Mayor
elect Diehl, George E. Matthews,
Judge Robert M. Titus and others. Mr.
Smith spoke on "The Censorship of the
Press aB a Faotor in Modern Political
Life," and among other things said:
The intense rivalry of American
newspapers has bred serious faults as
well as magnificent achievements. In
the race for popular favor, mark you,
it is an effort to catch the people and
to meet a popular want there is an
orerstrainIng for effect. There are
glarish and startling head-lines; there
Is too often a sensational presentation;
there is sometimes an oversteeping of
legitimate bounds; there is not merely
a harmless and Interesting personalism,
but occasionally an unjustifiable inva
sion of private sanctity. I have no
sympathy with the freak journalism
which ministers to morbid tastes.
Within the past few years we have
witnessed some striking and splendid
illustrations of the higher standard of
political journalism. When the late
president of the United States summon
ed congress in extra session In 189d to
rescue the country from the false policy
of the continued purchase of depreciat
ed silver which imperiled the public
credit, republican papers forgot their
partisanship and stood shoulder to
shoulder with democratic journals In
his support. When in the presidential
election of last year this momentous
issue came on trial again in a still
more dangerous form and the defense
of the standard of publio' honor and
honesty fell to the other party, demo
cratio papers openly and boldly labor
ed for republican success.
As the one great medium of pub
licity, which is itself the universal
solvent , the press is already the chief
factor in our political life. But as its
higher development ,goes on its influ
ence will advance In every direction.

"ALONE ON A WIDE SEA"
PRESIDENT ULL3IAN OF THE BOARD
OF POLICE COMMISSIONERS.
Waited In Vain for Other Mombers of the
Commission to Appear Last Night A
Pergonal Note From the Mayor Wanted
Opinions of Several Commissioners on
the Situation.
Last night was the night for the reg
ular meeting of the board of pollca
commissioners, but the board did not
meet. Commissioner Ullman, the pres
ident of the board, met however. He'
met with the mayor, and the meeting
lasted about fifteen minutes, at the end
of which time the mayor having
Important matters of state to consider,'
repaired to his office, ,the private sanc
tum in the city hall, leaving an order
at the office of the police commissioners
to call him by telephone In case enough
members of the police board to make
uorum showed up. It was about 8:20
wh
hen his honor tore himself arway from
the police commissioners' room and,
Commissioner Ullman. The latter, how- ,
ever, remained in the office until 9:15,
hoping, vainly hoping that the commis
sioners would show up. When at that
time not one of the other commissioners
appeared, Mr. Ullman left the police ,
board's room, and as he emerged from
the portals of the police building he was
asked as to why he thought the other
commissioners had not shown up. Ha
replied: "I don't know, I am sure. You
know it is a. very stormy night." Ask
ed if he thought that the Inclement
weather kept the members away, he
said: "Well, It Is very probable that
they did not get out on account of the
storm."
The city hall was locked up, but Mr.
Ullman desiring to confer with the
mayor, who was in his office In' the
council house, after going to the big
front doors and finding them' locked.
slipped around to the side entrance,
through the fire commissioners' office,
and went through the fire door up to
the head man's tepee, where he remain
ed in conference until nearly 11 o'clock..
One of the commissioners seen last
evening while the mayor and Mr. Ull
man were closeted together, was asked
why the members of the commission
did not attend the meeting. He. said:
'How do I know whether or not I am
, commissioner? I have sent in my :
resignation and have received from tho
mayor no notice as to whether he will
accept my resignation or desires me to
recall it. I -received from Mr. Ullman,
president of the board, a notice to the
effect that the mayor would meet with
the board to-night. Now I think that 1
Mayor Farnsworth wanted to confer
with the commissioners he should have
sent notes to us signed by himself so
stating. As matters stand, I don't
know whether he has accepted my res
ignation or not. I do not know that I
am a police commissioner any longer."
When asked if the other commissioners
were waiting for a note from the may
or asking them to confer with him or
to withdraw their resignations before
attending the board meeting, the com- ,
missioner said: "I cannot speak for
the other members of the board. I have
not seen all the commissioners togeth
er since the resignations were sent in
to the mayor, but I can say that in
private conferences of an informal na
ture held by various members of the
board, it was settled that we would:
not attend the meeting to-night, un
less some communication was received!
direct from the mayor asking a recon
sideration of the resignations or asking
us to attend a conference with him."
Another commissioner who like the
one previously quoted requested that
his name be not used, said: "I don't
know that Mr. Ullman has any more
authority to send notes to us asking
us to attend a meeting of the board
at which the mayor would be present
than has any other commissioner. We
elected him president of our board, but
we did not elect him to dictate to the
rest of us. He is simply a commissioner
and has no more authority or powers
than the rest of the commissioners
have. If we had received a request
from the mayor himself to meet with
him to-night I think that all the com
missioners would have been present."
A third commissioner speaking of the
difficulty that has arisen between the
mayor and the members of the police
commission, said: "Well, I hardly knowi
what to say in answer to your question
as to why I did not attend the meeting.
One thing I will say, though. I will
not be Fred Farns worth's little yellow
dog. Farnsworth and I are good friends
personally, but I told him shortly after
I sent in my resignation that if he had
accused me in private life of things
which he charged In the letter he sent
to me as a police commissioner, I would
have nothing more to do with him. I
would speak to him. I had made up ,
my mind as had, I think, the other
commissioners, that on one condition
only would I attend the meeting. What
that was I will not say. But the mayor
has received my resignation and I have
heard nothing from him about It,
whether he accepts it or not."
At the close of his conference In his
private office with Commissioner Ull
man, Mayor Farnsworth disappeared
from city hall, and all attempts to find
him were unavailing. No one answered
his door bell and a telephone call at
his house received no response. He evi
dently desired to get "Far from the
madding crowd," to lose himself for
the time being, and he did.
