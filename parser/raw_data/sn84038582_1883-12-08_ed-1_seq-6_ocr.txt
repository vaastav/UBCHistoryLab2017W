tho least they can be made lor at.Ioliel is
$:W. In England the present price is $28

ton on steel rails ol course the price in
this country Is in no way affected by for.
tign competition. It is Bimply because
during tho high prices of the past few
years the business of making steel rails
was enormously overdone, and under our

the Speakership at Washington was settled
last Saturday evening with much inure
ease and expedition than a few b.'tirs

ballot to be ho overwhelming that his op
poncnU were annihilated. Tne vote stood
104 for Carlisle. 52 for Randall and 3! for
Cox. The voto explodes the nonsensical

la regard to the remaining officers ot
the house, the business was disposed of
with equal rapidity and ;ood feeling. The
contest for tire clerkship was between Gen. J
Clark, of Mo., aud Geu. Atkins, ot Tenn.
The vote was a tie on two ballots and then
decided in favor Clark by two majority.
The other nominations, mailt' in each case
on the llrst ballot, were James A. Winter

CARLISLE FOR SPAKEK,
The nomination of Carlisle for Speaker
by the Democratic caucus at Washington
on Saturday evening, by tho decisive vote
on the first ballot of 101 against X.l tor all
others, was not a personal triumph, lor per
sonally either Itundall or Cox is more pop
ular than the high strung Keutuckian, but
it was the triumph of a principle. It means
that the democratic sentiment of th s coun
try, as voiced by its representatives in con
gress, is sincere and honest in its demand
for tariff and revenue reform. While it
would not perhaps bo fair to say that Han-
tl all is not also in accord with the general
sentiment of his parly on the same subject,
it is undeniable that the state he haiU Ircin
and the centrolling influences of both par
ties In that state, are such that the mission
of the democratic party, to curb monopo
lies and give the country an honest, consti
tutional tariff, could not be consistently en
rusted to his leadership. This was the
more evident when it was 1 ound, from the
very bcginningof this contest for thespeali
ership, tnat not only the tarill" lobby, but
the renrescntativcs or every manner oi suu
sidy and all sorts of steals, were in Wash
ington in lull furec working for the elec
Hon ol Randal!. Rife defeat, as the Chicago
Trihiur very justly points out in an arti
cle too long to copy, upsets the plans of
the dozen of corporations in this country
who own about $100,000,000 a;rcs of pub
lie lands on which they reluse to pay taxes ;
the plans ot the whisky men, who want an
indefinite extension of the time to pay
their taxes; tho plans of tho California
millionaires, who want to grab 15,000,000
acres more of the public domain: of the
American Tin Plata Association, who want
to double the cost of tin cans, i in cups and
cofTco pots to line their own pocket, and
so on, and so on.
At the same time, however, that the elec
tion of Carli6lo fills the whole monopoly
and grab mongenng horde with dismay, it
is not a committal of the democratic party
to the doctrine of Free Trade, in the sense
in which republicans always use that term.
Mr. Carlisle, in his speech on taking the
chair, defined his position unmistakably on
that head in tho following pregnant tonus:
Sudden and radical c'langes in the laws
and regulations affecting the commercial
and industrial interests of the people shell J
never bo made, uules-s imperatively de
manded by tome great public emergency,
and, in my opinion, under existing cir
cuni.jtiinces such action would not be fav
orably received by any considerable hum
ijer ()t lhoHl) imvc given any attention
to the subject. 7'Wt; irho fear that tiny
rutnyt'M that ihuu m uwlertaken mil be m-
1'irtoun t ait' iut' rent or em u aiiord mis-
'liable ran? for elanwr (till be 'really (Us-
So the Republicans, bo far as the election
ol Mr. Carlisle is ceucerned, may hang up
their bugaboo of Free Trade in tho Mu
seum of Antiquities by the side of the
Bloody Shirt. While the country is under
an nnavoldablo necessity ot raising a reve
nue of some 200,000,01.10 by tarill' imposi
tion, tho democratic parly is not insane
enough to commit itsell to the ignis fituan
of absolute free trade. But in tho adjust
ment of these absolutely unavoidable taritf
exactions the democrats can aud will be
guided dy the, simple proposition tha': there
aro other interests than those of the Penn
sylvania iron and New England cotton
lords to be looked alter, and that one class
of citizens nhall not be favored to the ex
clusion of all other classe.v In their opin
ion tut) producing classes and tne consum
ing classes have as largo a claim upon the
recognition of ttie government as the mnn-
utact'iring classes, and subsidies and boun
ties, m often miscalled protection, do not,
as n matter of fact, in the long rim benefit
the manufacturer no more than tin y do the
consumer. "In the existing tariff," as a
very able cotcmporiiry puts if, "there are
boundless inequality and false pretence.
They may not, indeed, be able to reform
its anuses, but they can expose them and
lay down n line of reform which they
pledge themselves to carry out If intrusted
with power. To this reform they will at
ence I'ddrc-a tbemselvcs carefully, patient-
ly, and thoughtfully. In this work of ex
position they will show the country that
they are tho friends of the people at the
same time that they are agents of honest
and enlightened government."
THE JUA.INE PROJECT.
Tho project of Mr. Blame, in divide the
whisky tax among tho states according to
population, is variously commented upon
bv the press, though upon the whole
greeted with more opposition than favor.
Tho New York Sua thinks .Mr. Blame can
hardly be In oarucst, and that his object is
merely l remind his fellow citizens of his
continued existence, which they were In
danger of forgetting. Aside from that, the
project us coming from the state of Maiue,
is chiefly notable for its chcekiness, con
sidering that the state in question baa for
32 years past utterly forbidden and made a
crime tho traffic from which the revenue in
question is derived.
Tho Chicago Tribune thinks the six mil
lions a year the plan would give to Illinois
would be a good thing to use io making
,te icncepi0 4 the Illinois ship canal.
our state taxes otherwise being so light that
their continuance at the samo time would
bo no burden. Tho Tribune indorsement
ol the Blaine project, however, is very
guarded and upon the whole, rather Pick
wickian in its tone.
Tho papers, however, that take a serious
view of the matter, are all agreed that the
one fatal objection to tho project Is that It
is unconstitutional. Congress has power
to "levy and collect taxes, duties, imposts
and excises" only for national objects
"to pay the debts and proviJe for the com
mon defense and general wellare" uot of
ttie states, but "of the I'nihi States."
Judge Story says that "this pover to levy
taxes for Ibo common defense aad general
welfare of the United States is no; a general
power. It is muled to those objects. The
federal government cannot transcend them.
If the defense proposed by a tat e not the
common defense of the United States, 51
the wellare be not general, but tpecial or
local, as contradistinguished ;rom national,
it is not irithiit the trope of theUonstitn
ti'jrt. If the tax be not proposd for the
common defense or the general welfare,
but lor other objects wholly extrincous, it
would be indctensitile upon consti
tutional principles."
So Mr. Blaines proposition, a-well as
John Logan's quixotic tcnenio tt convert
the whisky tax into a grand elucntion
fund, falls dead at the feet ol the constitu
tion.
IHE MES8AGE.
As usual, wo give place to ths full text
of the President's annual message on the
re assembling of Congress. The document
always contains such a comprehensive
survey of the condition of tbecouury, both
in its foreign aud domestic reluliois, as to
alloid interesting reading to mostpeople,
while It does away largely with thcnccessi
ty of reading the voluminous repots of the
departments, of which it is a sorto rename.
The message read to congress in Tues
day, as a conventional documeit ot the
kind referred to, is a model in its way. It
is not unreasonably long, it overs the
whole ground, it gives all tho luormution
tho people expect to find in it, aid careful

l'ded to give offense to any part; or faction.
The President no doubt wil' be heartilj
endorsed by the down east fsl.crmen fori
the stand he takes in favor if protecting
their rights; there will bo 10 dissent to
his views in regard to pauer immigra
tion; nor to his suggestion liateomeihiug
should be done to prevent the wholesale
evasion which is now systematically prac
ticed of tho laws against Ciincsu immigra
tion. In his agreement with Secretary
Folger that tho present ejecssive taxaticn
and redundant revenue arc to be deprecat
ed, yet that it "would not be wise at this
session of congress to adopt measures for a
largo diminution of the revenue," ho is evi
dently mir.oi'ul that a presidential election
is impending and assumes the role of the
wily politician rather th:;n of the honest
and courageous statesman. Another deba
table agreement ot the President with his
finance Secretary is that in favor of allow
ing tho Natioual Banks to Issue currency
within ten per cent, of the market valuo of
their bonds on deposit with the povcni
mcnt instead ot tne lace value, ni now.
Such regulation would be the organisation
of a perpetual picnic for the bulla and

President is unable to bring himself ip to
the point of recommending the estabish-
ment of a postal telegraph system, thaigh
he has nothing to say against it. On the
Mormon question, however, he has 'cry
positive, ideas. Ho would treat the uccr
heroically, by abolishing the tecto
rial government entirely and goverfing
Utah by a board of commissioners, nsthc

ing 10 laws and regulations lirnl Jowl by

The message h notable for some cubpi-
cuous omissions, among which are naaed
tho uecessity lor a bankrupt law, for rliof
to the Supreme Court, for authorizing be al
taxation of railroad lunds, for sumiiary
rejection of preposterous land claims aud
for immediate correction ot the nmsej
practised by railroads built with mblit
monevs and directly subject to congjesno
nal regulation.
liut what Illinois has peculiar reasons to
complain of is that the President has who),
ly ignored the earnest appeal made to hlia
by Gov. Hamilton for a simple reference, if
but ty a line, to the actioii of thi s.ta'.e of
jfering to transfer the Illinois caaal to the
general government on certain conditioi.s.

CONGRESS.
There was a full attendance in both
houses i, f congress when the gavii rapped
to order at 12 o'c'ork on Monday, but the
proceedings iu both were very short. The
senate did no more than administer the
oaiu to nine newly elected members and
tl.tn adjourned to await the organization
of the bouse. In ihc latter body consider
able lime was spent iu calling the roll and
witling the members In their seala, after
w hich the ballot for speaker was taken, re
sulting in 191 voles for Carlisle, 113 for
K'eifcr, 1 for Robinson, 1 for Wise of Vs.,
I lor Wadswortu of N. Y., and 1 for
Lacy ot Michigan. The scattering votes
were mostly republicans who couldn't
stomach Keifer.
Mr. Carlisle was escorted to the chair by
Randall, Cox and Keifer, and the oath ad
ministered to him by Kelly, or Pa., the
oldest member or the house. Mr. Carlisle
then made the customary speech or a new
speaker on taking the chair, after which
the house adjourned. '
On Tuesday, in the senate, besides read-
ing the president's message, about a dozen
of bills were Introduced, including one by
Edmonds for the establishment of a postal
telegraph system, and one by Heck to aiitbo
rizetho purchase of foreign built ships by
citizens ot the United States.
Tho house completed its organization
by electing the nominees of tho democratic
caucus for clerk, doorkeeper, &,c. The
members spent boiuo time in the usual
drawing for Beats, after which the Presi
dent's Message was received and read, and
the usual motion adopted to refer it to the
committee of the whole and order it to be
printed.

Among the bills introduced was one by
our senator Cullom to re organize the
legislature of Utah, und one by Logan to
give each soldier and sailor of ths late war
a quarter section of public land.
In tho liou90 the death of Thomas II
Herndcn, a member elect from Alabama,
was announced, and the customary reso
lutions were passed, upon which an ad
journment was taken to next Monday.
O'DONNELE CONVICTED.
Tbcy make short work of such matters
in England. A trial like that of O'Don
nell for the murder of the renegade Carey,
in this country, would have occupied a
month. In England it was dispatched in
two days. The trial of O'Don nell com
menced on Friday and ended on Satur
day. Not over halt a dozen witnesses
were examined. Russell was allowed to
make a four hours speech in bis defence.
and the attorney general replied inaspeech
of an hour and a half. The Judge made
a brief charge, mainly unfavorable to the
accused, and then in fifteen minutes came
tho verdict of guilty, and close upon that
the sentence of death. The usual ques
tion whether tho prisoner had anything to
say why sentence of death thould not be
passed upon him was asKed in so low a
l ine that O'Donnell did not hear it. Alter
tke seLtcnco of death was pronounced he
disired 10 speak but was forbidden. Then
as the JuJe ordered lnm removed and the
officers sezed him, O'Donnell held up hi?

Building Committee.
The committee also submitted all their
books and DSDers. and returned their
thanks for the kind treatment by and
hearty co-operation of the Board in aU
their acts.
On motion of Switt a vote of thanks was
tendered tho committee tor the able and
efficient manner in which they had per
formed their work. The vote was a rising
one and was unanimous.
A long discussion then arose on the
question raised by Lane to have a full and
complete exhibit of the cost of the build
ing printed in English and German, :n
pamphlet form, for distribution to the tax
payers of the county. The subject was
finally handed over to a committee com
posed of O'Laughlin, Gunn and W. Iloge.
Wilson presented a petitiou from Fall
River asking for aid in building a bridge
over Gentleman's Kavlne, on the mnin
road to Ottawa. The cost is estimated to
boat least $1400 abutment, $700: uperj
structure, $003; approaches, $95. Tho
town can raise at limit of taxation only
about $11100 and needs a large part of that
for ordinary road purposes. Referred to
road and bridge committee.
Griffin of Utica presented a petition from
Utica and Deer Park commissioners for
$3,700. Referred. Grifiln also asked the
committee to bo allowed to go to Utica to
examine the bridge, that town agreeing to
pay tho expense. The proposition for
some reason didn't seem agreeable and it
was by a bare majority of two that the
Board consented! in spite of tho absurdity
ot saying, as tho Board nearly did, that a
committee shall not investigate subject
matter given into their charge.
Thursday morning was consumed in the
liscussion of the famous Utica bridge case,
ntrodueed by a report from the bridge
committee, who stated that they had ex -aunned
the structure and found it a reason
ably good bridge, and recommend the
county appropriate $8,700 to buy it, the
towns having entered Into contract to keep
it in repair forever, and the bridge com
pany to stop nil legal proceedings now in
progress lor damages lor use and deteriora
tion, tho towns to pay accumulated costs.
Lewis presented Deer Park's side of the
ca.se, that the town always opposed the
bridge, never asked aid tor it or counten
anced its erection, which position has been
sustained by every state court before whom
the cause appeared. To have done so
would have laid on the town a tax of
about $19,000on 20,000 acres of land,
10,000 of which is unimproved.
Miller thought DcerTark had cut rather
a poor figure in the whole proccediug.
M. Gunn 6aid Ihe last suit had bet:;
clearly against Deer Park; and that town
could not logically now ask aid seeing that
really no legal obligation as yet rested on
the county to giant aid.
The question then discussed was one of
expediency whether it is cheaper lor trie
county to buy this bridge or wait uniii
.March, when the towns could legally corr,
pel the county to pay haif the cost ot a
ic.v one. If tuts ono is bought the com
pany agree to wait for their money (with
out interest) until the conn!? has the nioL-
ey in the treasury, f i matter was post
poned until 2 p. m.
Perkins then submitted a petition lror.
ihe city of Ottawa, asking for aid in build
ing a bridge over the Illinois river. The
original toll bridge was purchased by the
commissioners of highways of the town of
Ottawa and South Oitawa, (aud the coun
ty) at a cost of $19,840. and maintained
by the commissioners until thi summer,
when they repudiated possession and re
fused to make the necessary repairs. It
being in a dangerous condition tho city ci
Ottawa made repairs to render it safe for
crossing, la addition the city has two
bridges to maintain over the Fox river,
live irou aud two wooden canal bridges,
three over the feeder and nearly a dozen
culverts and other small wooden bridges,
the repairs and maintenance ot which is
an unreasonable burden on the town and
city. The estimated cost of u bridge over
tho" Illinois river to replace the old one, is
placed at $10,000, one-half of which the
county is a-ked to contribute. Referred.
Ma.k Dally, engineer at tho boiler
house, asked increase of pay from 1200 to
$1H)0. He is required to have assisiams
live months In the year and 1 nine months,
the pay of whom comes out of his salary.
At $1800, paying his own assistants, he
thinks he would have a tair compensation
for his own services. Referred .

Dunavan offered a lesolution to the ef
fect that interest on ail interest bearing
county orders used iu payment u iuts,
cense when the orders come into the pos
session ol the collectors. This opened up
a big question, the settlement of which
whs rtferred to the finance committee.
After dinner the sheritl asked that the
Roaid adopt a resolution designating what
parts of the building should be thrown
open to public meetings. As he under
stoal his duties the supervisors' room only
was to be used for that purpose, the court
rooms being closed. The matter was re
ferred to the committee on public build
ings. Armstrong presented a bill of J. II. Stree.
tr for some $300 for repairs on jail after
escape of prisoner.. He was telegraphed
ror and agreed to do the work Tor half
price, but on consultation with his lawyer
concluded he-wouldn't do it. and again re
pented. The bill belnu in total and not by
items, was referred to th March sessionfor
disposition. '
