Wo leant that half of the city of Charleston is
totroyed by fire. It is attributed to a slave in
surrection. A great battle has been fought in
Western Virginia between Geo. Milroy, in com
aad of tha Government forces, and Gen. John
loo of Georgia, ia which the Union troops were
victorious, killing 200 of the rebels, and wound
ing Gen. Johnson, with a loss of only SO on our
aide. This battlo has driven the last of the reb
el foreet from Western Virginia.
Tbe reception of the nwsof the capture of
Ifssoa and SlideU, has created great excitement
ia England, and nearly ah the English papers
coodoma tht action of oar government. Some
ol then believe war to be inevitable. The
Trench papers look at the affair with English
eyes. Active preparations are going on at the
English dock-yards. The Timet tavs that
these things will follow an outbreak, the destruc
tion of the Southera Blockade, complete block
ade of the Northern porta, and the recognition
of tha 8otbeni Confederacy by Franco and En
gland. The Paris PafriV, argues that France
will aide with England ia case of war, and recog
nise tbe Southern Confederacy. It is asserted
J the press, that England will demand the sur
render of Mason and SUdelL If this demand is
saade, it will never be consented to by the gov
ernment, and the result will be war. In that
ease Michigan will be peculiarly exposed, and it
becomes the State administration at onae to take
; taeasuraa, to place our frontier ia a position for
necassful defence, against any attack froa oar
Canadian neighbors. Indications are unfavora
ble foe peace, and iu time of peace we should
prepare for war. .

At Sea, November 16, 1861. J
Tbe Governments of Great Britian, France,
and Spain, having issued proclamations that tbe
Confederate States were viewed, considered, and
treated as belligerents, I felt no hesitation in
boarding and searching ail vessels, of whatever
nation I fell iu with, and I have done so. Tbe
question arose in my mind whether I had the
right to capture the persons of the Commission
i wnether they were amenable to capture,
There was no doubt that I had the right to cap
ture vessels with written dispatches. They are
expresely referred to, iu all authorities subject
ing the vessel to seizure, and condemnation of
the Captain of the vessiel, had he knowledge of
their being on board. But these gentlemen were
not dispatches of tbe literal sense, and no where
could I find a case in point. They had been
presented to tbe Captain General of Cuba by Her
British Majesty s Consul, but the Captain-Gene
ral told me he had not received them in that
capacity, but as distinguished gentlemen and
strangers. I then considered them as the em
bodinient of dispatches, and it therefore became
my duty to arrest their progress and capture
them if they had no pasporta or papers from the
Federal Government, as provided for under the
law of nations, namely, that Foreign Ministers of
belligerent to pass free, as respects the vessel in
which they embarked. Tbe agent of the vessel
the son of the British Consul at Havana
was well aware of the character of these persons,
They went on the steamer with the knowledge
and consent of the Captain who endeavored af
terwards to conceal them by refusing to exhibit
the passenger list and tbe papers ot the vessel,
There can be no doubt he knew they were car
rying highly important dispatches, aud were en
dowed with instructions inimical to the United
States. This rendered his vessel, though a neu
tral, a good prize. I determined to take posses
ion of the vessel, and, a I mentioned in my re
port, send her to Key West tor sdjudication.
forebore to seize her, however, in consequence
of my being so reduced in officers and crew, and
the derangement it would cause innocent persons,
there being a large number of passengers who
would have been put to great loss and inconven
ience, as well as disappointment, from tbe inter
ruption it would have caused them in not being
hie to join the steamer from St Thomas for
Europe. I therefore concluded to sacrifice the
interest of my officers and crew in the prize, and
suffer the steamer to proceed, after tbe neces
sary detention to effect the transfer of these
Commissioners, considering I had attained the
mportant end I bad ia view.

Mr. Pomeroy, from Mr. Seward's county, de

The following letter from Dr. Sbank, Surgeon
of the 6th Regiment, will interest all our rea
ders :
Hiltox nxAi, S. C, Nov. 29
Johs A. Kerr Dear Sir: When I last
wrote you, I knew but little of this place, and
consequently said but little, but since be com in
more familliar with it from observation and in
quiry, I am disposed to regard it as one of the
tine.n countries to live in on the continent.
Since we took possession of this Island, there
has been but two or three days that I felt like
wearing an overcoat, even in the night time, an
thus far. there has been but two frosts, and they
so light ?hat vegitation remains as green as it
was iu September. To-day you can pick a bo-
quet of be: utiful flowers, even tbe roses aie bud
ding and llosouting, apparently unconscious
that winter '. just upon them.
It is now 9 o'clock in the evening, and yet
set in my tent sweating just as I used to do in
my office last August. Of course I have no fire
nor have I enjoyed the luxury of a fire 6ince
have been on the Island.
I would like to send you a few specimens picked
up on this Island, and may do so before long.
I bave for instance a pipe that I have made from
the sweet-briar root, with a bamboo stem, both
got from the battle field ; also a piece of shell
that I picked up close by a devl " secesh," that
had passed through his thorax, and so interfered
with bis locomotion, that be laid quite stiil till
our folks buried him, and I also send you a leaf
from the day-book of a brother chip, that Bill
handed me, (they call him here Bill ShatA), just
to show you bow prices range in tte practice of
medicine here ; also find tbe report of the Guard
dated Oct. 1 0th, that was found after we landed,
showing that they left in somewhat of a hurry
and considered such papers of less account than
their skins. I send it, as in all probability it is
the last rebel Guard Report that will ever be
made here, as we have made arrangements to do
all that kind of business ourselves in the future
Our troops are throwing np fortifications and
in a few days will be as safe as a mouse in a milL

The following placard was posted around on
Change :
" Outrage on tbe British flag. Southern com
misaioners loicibly removed from a British mail
steamer. A public meeting will be held in Cot
tou salesroom at three o'clock."
The room was crowded to excess. The chair
was occupied by James Spcuce, who read the
to lowing leMuutious :
JU tolveJ, That this meeting, having beard
with Indiana ion that an American rederal ship
of-war has forcibly takeu from a British mad
steamer, ceitain passengers, peaceably under tbe
shelter of our Hag, from one neutral port to anoth
er, do earnestly call upou tbe government to as
Bert the dignity of tbe British flag, by requiring
prompt reparation lor this outrage.
This resolution was received with general en
thusiasm. Tne resolution was advocated by the chairman,
who considered he was expressing the feeling of
the people, when he said it was the duty of the
people to press on the government the impera
tive necessity ot vindicating the honor aud dig
nitv ol the Biiiish name and nag.
.Mr. John Campbell considered there was reas
on to doubt whether tbe facts related and acted
on by this meeting were in reality a breach of
;nt n ational law, and refeired to tbe opiuious ot
the law ollicers ot the Crowu as being in some
meui-ure inclined to show that such a step, as
taken with respect to Southern Commissioners,
was justibitble under tbe existing state of inter
national law, and urged tbe propriety of postpo
ning the consideration of the subject t.ll io-aior
row.
Mr. Low sustained Mr. Campbell's views.
The Chairman suggested that to meet the ob
jeciiou ot Mr. Campbell, to strike out tbe words
' by requiring prompt reparation for this out
rage," and thus amended, tbe resolution passed
almost unanimously.
Several merchants expressed their views a'ter
the adjournment, that tbe meeting and its action
was picinature.

of patent claims, important statistics, practical

and bimself, by which the former agreed letlka

negotiated with tbe banks on the 10th of kV

bearing 7 per cent, interest. Thusgteaajag
was coupled with no arrangement for re-ctabsnn.
ment and entailed no expense, except tht ara.
paring and issuing tbe bonds. This was ahs
complied with. The option to the banks is, that
on or after tbe 1st of January, a fourth adraaj.
ot fifty millions should be made, on the ataw
terms as the first or second, if required. 1
addition to these loans, $21,145,220, ap to Set

and twenties, payable on demand; S.S&SiO)
remaining in tbe Treasury. This aawant nay

The revenue receipts have not fulfilled his cx
pectatioos. He says an act modifying the reus
of duties differed from the measure be subnuv
ted to Congress in most of these particulars, es
pecially in diminished duties on tea, coffee and
sugar, and exempting goods in warehouse sad
on shipboard. Tho difference was disadvanta
geous ; while a potential cause of reduced re
ceipts may be found in the changed circaeietaa
ces of the country, proving unfavorable to for
eign commerce. These circumstances compel
him to reduce his estimates fcr 1S62, froa ths
revenue, from fifty seven millions dollars teS2,
1 7,602. The estimates from receipts Irom
lands aud miscellaneous sources, be reduces
from three millions to 2,304,062. The only
other source of revenue is a direct tax, author,
zed by Congress, which, if increased to the liaiit
proposed by tbe Secretary aud assumed by the
States, the further sum of 120,000,000 may be
expected. The aggregate of revenue may be
thus estimated at 154,652,660, which is f25,
447,334 less than tbe estimate of July.
The Secretary states that tbe estimates for
July were based ou the raising of 250,000 vol
unteers aud au increase of the regular army by
eleven regiments; but alter that report bad
been closed. Congress authorized tbe acceptance
by the President of 6K,0MI men, besides add,
tiooal companies aud officer a This large increase
has and must necessarily augment tbe expendi
tures far beyond the limit iudicated by the ori
ginal estimate, which will bo still further exten
ded by the increase of tbe navy ; and additional
appropriations are asked tor. Ot these additional
appropriations, $l7,vt)5,566 were authorised by
acta of the last session, and 143, 130,927 are
now asked for, making au aggregate, incladiof
122,7 b7 ,VS3 for iudehnite sproputlions, of
21 3,904,427. To provide these large sasat,
retrenchment and reform are indispensable.
Contracts should be subjected to strict M perfus
ion, and contractors to a vigorous responsi
bility. All unnecessary offices should be abol
ished, and salaries and pay materially reduced.
While thus recommending retrenchment, ke
feels himself constrained to renew suggeatioos
heretofore submitted by bim, tbst the property
of rebels should be made te pay, in part at least,
the cost of the rebellion. Property of great
value in loyal States is held by proprietors vir
tually engaged in a guilty attempt to break ap
the Union, which is justly forfeited to tbe peo
ple, and which should be subjected to seques
tration or confiscation, aud tbe proceeds applied
to the satisfaction ot claims arising from tbe war.
Tbe property of rebels in rebellious Slats
should be treated in the same manner. Their
rights to "services," under State laws, most of
necessity form an exception to any rule of cos
fiscatiou. Persons held br rebels sudersaca
laws to service as slaves, may, however, bo
justly liberated from their constraint and Beads
more valuable in various .employments through
voluntary and compensated service, than if coo
fiscated as subjects of property.
The Secretary says the most sacred doty of
the American people now requires tbe consecra
tion of all their energies aud resources to ths
establishment of the Cnion, and sound psbcy
would seem to suggest no extension of forcift
trade, but more absolute reliance on Ajncricas
labor, American skill, and American sod. Bo
recommends that the duty on tea, coffee ssi
sugar be increased to 2 1-2 per cents per Ik;
on brown, and on clayed sugar 3 cents; to 20
cents on green tea ; to 6 cents on coffee ; sod
that no further alterations of the tariff be mad
unless further experience shall demonstrate ths
necessity. He deems it necessary to wcresss
the direct tax so as to so ss to produce froa
loyal States a revenue of vtleast $20,000,0X),u
mating such duties on stills, distilled liquet,
tobacco, bank notes, carriages, legacies, on pa
per, evidences of debt, and conveyances of
property, and other like property, as will pro
duce an equal additional sum. Tbe wcosas tat
will probably produce 1 10,000,000 more, soaking
an aggregate of $50,0o0,000. The Secretary at
aware that tbe sum ia large, bat Sesing no prob
ability of tbe revenue exceeding $4O,OO',0O0
during the current year, be feels that no malt
t ot shrink from a plain statement Two-fifUiS
of one per cenL on tbe real and personal prop
erty of loyal States will produce $44,000,000,
the proposed income adding $10,000,000 Basra.
The Secretary recommends a plan for s na
tional circulation of notes, tbe features of tuck
are a circulation of notes bearing a common is
pression, and authenticated by common aether
ity ; tbe redemption of those notes by aatociaiws
and institutions to which tbey may be delivered
for issue, aud tbe security of that redesnpUOB
by pledge of United States stocks, and ss ade
quate provision of specie. Au important ad
vantage to tbe people by this plan, would be is
tbe iucreased security of the Union, eprhigiaf
from common interests Iu its preservation, cres
ted by a distribution of its stocks to associations
throughout the country as the basis of I heir cir
cu la tion, and be entertains tbe opinion if a credit
circulation be desirable, it is most desirable is
this form. He states it is most earnestly hoped,
and not without sufficient grounds, that ths
present war be brought to an auspicious ter
mination before midsummer, and that in that
event the provision of revenue by tatatioa
recommended will amply suffice for all fioaociBi
exigencies, without additional loans, ana euaow
the Government at once to begin a reduciioa of
tbe existing debt. If tbe war continues to Jar
1st, lt62. tbe public debt will be $517,322 802;
if till July 1st, 163, it will be ia round sea
bero, $900,000,fXK).
The prohibition of trade with the rebel otaus
has been full v enforced. Resulations bave beea
established by which, rice, cotton, and other
property in tbe insurrectionary districts oocopied
bv our troona. will ha co!litrd aiid scut bv SOS
to New York. All sales wi.l be for account ef
the Government, and the proceeds paid into the
National Treasury. Asa general rule, commerce
should follow tbe flag, and when tbe authority
of the Union ia fully restored in States, ports
should be opened wiihout restriction, sud sB
commerce freely permitted.
Tb Secretary closes by saying it baa bees
bis endeavor to infuse into his Department the
greatest possible sctivity and vigor, and be hopes
that continued endeavor, with larger experience,
will make it what it ought to be.
