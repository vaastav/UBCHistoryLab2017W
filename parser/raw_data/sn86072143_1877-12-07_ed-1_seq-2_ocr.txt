The President's Message.
Wc surrender the greater portion of our
space, to-day, to tbe President's Message.
Tbc position or the great iolitical iarties
is so critical and the issues of the day
arc o momentous that few presidential
message, of late years, have been so anxious
ly waited for; and the document will un
doubtedly tc read with eager interest. The
Southern quotum is dicucd. the President
gives the reason why he felt impelled to
pursue the course he took at tho -tart, ays
that he felt it wi-e then, and still believes it
wic and sound. Ho argues strongly for re
sumption, and tale- ground for the
rcmonetization of silver, but opposes
any such legal tender quality a will
Tiolate the understanding on which our
bonds were i-sueJ. He abo opio-cs the
extreme position taken by the great silver
producers, and doe not favor placing silver
on an equality with gold at the mint. In
the matter of civil service reform. President
Hayes stands upon the ideas set forth in his
letter of acceptance and in his inaugural,
and recommend- the renewal of the commis
sion appointed by President Grant and
beaded by George William Curtis. The
Mexican border troubles and the Indian
question are dwelt upon at length.
These are the -salient points ol the Message.
For the minor suggestions and recommenda
tions we must refer oar readers to the docu
ment it-elf, which deserves and doubtless
will receive careful and candid perusal.
The Senate die well in passing the Paris j
Exposition bill as it can. o from the House.
It appropriates $150,000 for the American
department ol the exhibition.
Lohd Debet, bead of the Foreign Dcpart
mnt cf the British Govercncnt, has
spoken on the Eastern question, to dcf.ne tbc
attitude of England. He is clear that there is
no MceVity for a departure from the
neutrality which has hitherto been maintain
ed ; and he does not regard either Con
fctantinople or the Sum canal as in danger.
The inference Ls tolerably dl-tinct that if
either were in danger, England would have
a band in the fight.
At Pari", Friday night, a farewell ban
quet was piven to Gen. Grant by M. Ilarje,
the eminent banker. Gen. Grant vi-its
Lyons and Marseilles and embarks at Nice
December ICth to visit Gibraltar, Algiers,
Constantinople, Athens, Alexandria and
Cairo. He intends to make excursions
op the Nile, and returning to Alexandria
will po un to Malta and Palermo, and
expects to arrive in Naples at the end of
January. He will remain in Naples a week
and roceed thence to Rome, where he will
staj a month.
The tendency toward biennial, instead of
annual, sessions of legislatures has been
gaining strength all over the country of late
year, and no less than twenty-four of the
thirty-eight such bodies in tbc Union now
meet only once in two years. The Southern
States all hold to this rnle except South
Carolina, Alabama and Louisiana ; Vermont
and New Hampshire have adopted it in New
England, several of the Western States have
followed it for years, and now Minnesota, by
a constitutional amendment approved at the
recent election, talis into line.
It has been jrctty clear, from the moment
that the defection ol Conover and Patterson
became apparent, that it would lc iru-
TKwahle to treventthe eventual seating of
Butler. The main question has been
whether it should 1 done in such an order
of events as to secure ths rtjection of Kellogg
by Butler's vote. This outrage the rejec
tion of a man who wa lawfully elected, by
the vote of a man who was not elected
was, by good management on the part of
the Republicans, and by Conover s relusal to
be used for the utter overthrow ol nis party
in the Senate, averted. The seating of Kel
logg and Butler leaves parties as they were
with only the discovery that the Republi
can party has two petty shaky supiorts in
me en&iu.
Tue decision of the Supreme Court, as
delivered by Chief Justice Taney, to which
Judge Peck refers, is in the words: "By
this act of 1705 the power of decidine
whether the exigency had arisen upon which
the government of the United Statis is bound
to interfere, is eiven to the President. He

titled to it. If there is any armed conflict
like the one of which we arc shaking, it is
a case ol domestic violence, and one of the
partie mut be in insurrection against the
lawful cortrnmcnt. And the President
must, of necessity, decide, which is the gov
eromcot and which party Ls unlawfully
arrayed against it, Icfure he can perform the
duty inipostd ujon him by the act of Con-gru-s
" It will be seen from this that l',c
Prcfidmt is not required to volunteer to
decide between rival governments, ine lan
guage of Judge Taney is that "uponappliea-
tion he niu-t determine, eic, ituimn

Nut mi. The language .f J udge Taney is
that the Ptoidiut is to act ujon the ap
Tilication. etc. anJ consequently he mvt
determine. This is not quite the same thin;
as saving that hcaiiM determine only upon
Bptlication. Anil it wuuld not I difficult,
if it were worth while, to make a pretty fair
argument in support of the position that in
the particular can; in question that ol
Louisiana the President m required to
decide. Of course doirg what the tun-tit u
lion rfquire-w Mm tu do, is not volunteer
ing" to do a thing.
Patterson and Conovcr docrve all that has
ever licen -aid ot tht m by lioth Democrats and
now bv Republicans, hut they have given
some reasons lor their course which might
have been rod ones if riven by honest men
A ercat many Vermont Republicans who
were outraetd at Edmunds's course in tli
Pjncbback cae in voting against the admis
sion of a Republican whom they considered
elected, will lc curious to n-ad hi- explana
tion of bow his and Conover s theories differ.
For ourselves, we are clad Patter-on am
Conovcr are gone , they belonged to a dirty
sot that ton many Republicans in the North
have bad faith in, and in upholding wnom me
party has come to its prc-ent estate. Mint
pclier rrctman
We are not glad that this festive pair have
gone" lor two reasons. In the lir-t place
they have not gone. Conover still votes Re
publican on important questions ; and
long as Patterson in every si-trrh priM-laim-
himself a Republican, the party can hardly
be said to be rid of him. In the next place
when they arc gone, both f them, lnk an
line, the Rcpiblican majority in the Stoat
eoes with them. That swum to us worth
keeping.
1 bear oq every hand the opinion ex
pressed that if Mr Blaine or Mr. Conkling
bad been in the presidential chair, the Sen
ate would have escaped its present excite
ments and dangers, and I Hupjiosc it is true.
Mr. Blaine would have known how to put -a
hook into tho no-e of snrh fellows as Patter
son and Conov er, and lie would have coaxed
the Senate let Soring, at the executive es
cton. to have let in Kelloirg an j Corbin and
perhaps Pinchhaek. A good many Reptil-
licans in the Senato are now sorry that Kel
logg, at least, whs not admitted Iat Spring

Manlngton -Notes.
Tho Senate Committee on Privileges and
Election have decided to report lor adop
tion by tho Senate a resolution declaring
Mr. Eustis entitled to a seat as Senator
from LouMana. Mesrs. Wadlcigh, Mitchell,
Hoar, Saulsbury, Mcrrimon and Hill voted
(or the resolution and Messrs. Cameron
(WL.), McMillan and Ingalls against it.
On Saturday a bill to grant general am
nesty was presented for passage in the House.
Tim included Jefl Davis and everybody cb-e,
and did not require that application for
amne-ty bo made. Mr. Garfield ini-ted
that a condition should be inserted that ap
plication in writing to the Attorney-General
should first be made lor amnesty and the bill
was finally o modified. The vote stood W
to 50, and the bill therefore failed, less than
two-thirds voting in tbc affirmative. Messr-.
Hcndcc and Joyce voted against it.
On the question ol Kcllogg's admission
Conovcr and Patterson voted aye, Davis
voted no, and so Kellogg was admitted by a
vote of SO ayes against 3 nays. On the ad
mission of Butler, Conover anJ Patter-on
voted aye. Mr. Davis did not vote, and the
ballot stood ?J against 3. Air. Sharon
could have saved a Senator for the Republi
cans had he been pTcent. Rutler was led
to tbc desk to be sworn in by Patterson and
took the modified oath.
The President's annual message will 1
cnt to Congress to-day, after the usual joint
Committee has notified him that the two
Hou-es are organized and rcaJj to receive"
any communication from him. A Washing
ton special says that it is a very long docu
ment, and will be deeply interesting. cpee

adoption ol what is known as the Southern
policy, the rcmonetization of silver, the In

Mr. RaiTERbON Attacks the Prfsiiiets
pAiirv. IVfore 1 conclude I desire to say a
word more as to the Southern policy, so
called, inaugurated by the President of the
United Mates in iarcn iass,anu muwi'iw
cuted by him with most singular ardor, and
with an effect most c'aniaging to the cause of
true Republicanism in the bouthern States,
r i,.ii nlr with ln-commff rorect of tbc
President, but 1 must bear in mind that he
owes his exalted position to tnc votes oi re
publicans South as well as North. As I un
,ir,hr,l tt.it i-.tirv in its final analysis and
its sure eoniquencc, it means me uiHuuim
mcnt of olitieal friends to conciliate polit

assuming that it is the Democratic South
that mu-t t conciiiatco, wucrca it "
mighty Kepuhlican North that should be
conciliated This chcmc or policy of con
ciliation involve-, I am informed, tbc rehab
ilitation or revival of the old Whig party as a
necessary agent to secure it rmanent suc
cess. If the Prc-ident can effect this if he
can go down into the political valley of dry
Iwnes and infuse life and motion once more
into the scattered elements ot the old W ni
rurtT. he will stand confecd as the cham
pion re-urrectionist of the age. No. sir, it
Mnnotledunc: as well may some deluded
architect attempt to erect the thousand pal
aces of a great city out of the broken and
moldenng tombstones oi an nncicni vniage

Uut it is now an open nxn-i ma me
Pre-idcnt says that he intends to rcinforco
or supplement the resurrected Whig party
with the merchants and religious clement in
the South, and then incorporate this iu
litLMl trinity thus formed into the national
Kepuhlican "party. 1 am not aware that
there arc any live uirrchints in the Nmth
a ho are without pre-ent party ties or jIit
ical identity. If thete are any such, then
they arc not properly represented by the
ew uricans, luuue, viianc-io'i unu
van mill chaiaU-rs of -ummercc, and as for
the religious clement of the South,
they wor-hip I1 and Iemcracy,
and will not bow dkiwn to this graven
imazc called "Hayes's Southern policy,"
which Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up.
Uut, whatever this iolicy is in theory, wc
know what it is not in ractiec. It certain
ly is not protection of Kcpublieans in the
Southern Mates in the free exercise of all
their rights as AmericanMtizcnsand a just
recognition of their great and timely jwliti
cdl services. Wc know that it is rebuilt on
a broken tolitical tru-t, and its corner-stone
is laid in black ingratitude and cemented
by the blood of llravcd political friends.
Sir, the Kcpublieans of the South are not
dead, nor are they sleeping. The Athenians
erected a monument to Time and inscribed
it To him whoavenscs. Time, sir, will
surely avenge this great wrong, and in tho
not far distant future the now down-trodden
Kcpublieans of the South will remeintcr
both those who Ifricnded them aud tho-c
w ho betrayed them in the day of their need.
Doubtless, the Jiepuoiicans ot wc roum
have Wen ctiilty of many errors, and arc
tc-ionsihlc lor much of the maladministra
tion of the Southern Slate governments dur
ing the past eight years but, whatever their
wrirvtMis faults, betraying their friends was
not one of them.
I have said that, whatever protection the
republicans enjoy in the South, o l.ir as
their pcrons and profrty are guarded
niain-t actual viokrwT, they owe to the
clemency of thevietor. This is emphatic
ally true. In South Carolina, m Ut as tin

T1IK COIR5E TO I1E IT RUED,
which, iu my judgment, seemed wite-t in
the pre-tneo of this emergency was plainly
indicated in my inaugural address. It
pointed to the time, which all our peopb
de-ire to see, when a genuine love of our
whole country at.d of all that concerns its
true welfare shall supplant tbo destructive
forces of mutual animo-itv ot races and of
sectional hostility. Opinions have differed
widely as tu the mca-urcs hist calculated to
c.-nro thw wtt md. This was to be ex
pected The measures adopted by the Ad
ministration have been subjected to severe
and vamd criticism. Any course, wnai
ever, which might have been entered upon
would ctrtiinly have encountered di-tru-t
and strone opposition. These mcaurts
urorn in mv Mid.Mnpnt such as w ere most in

OlR 1I.NA.NCKS.
Tho annual report ol tho Secretary of the
'I rrnunrv nn tho statA of the finances pre
ents important questions lor the action ot
Congre, upon moio ot which I bavo al-
rridv remarked. The revenues ol the gov-
nmrntdurmir tne u-eai year enuingduue
fhiriirih. IhT7. were"f.l.0(U.G8ti.W The
total rxnenditures tor the same period were
!3S.WiiittHire 93, leaving ft surplus revenue
of s30.310.a77.t Ibis has substantially
uooiied tne rciuirements oi ino sins in
fund lor that vear. Tbeostimated revenues
ol the current fiscal year aro fr-'tiS.&m.tKRt,
and tbe estimated expenditures for tne amo
period are $32, 130.143 7-' It these est i
matrs irove to becorrcct.therewill be aur
plus revenue ot fc"J"i,i)bj,jj an amoun
nearly sulli:ient tor tho sinking Iund toi
that year. The estimated revenues tor the
next ti-eal year are $'2o1J,"50,ihh). It appears
from the report that during tho last fiscal
vear the revenues of the rovcrnment com
pared with the previous year have largely
decreased, mis uecreae, amounting iu m
sum ot Sis. IS 1.450 51. -was mainly in cu-
toms duties, caused partly by a large fall
ing otl'ol the amount of imported dntiablo
goods and pirtly by tho general fall ol
prices in the markrNol production of such
articles as pay ad valorum taxes. While this is
felt injuriously in the diminution of tho
revenue, it has been accorapsnicd with a
very large increase ol exportations. The
total exports during the last fiscal year, in
cluding coin, have been $ti5S ,637,157. and
and the imports have heen $4,(197,510,
leaving a balance or trade in favor ol the
United Mate, amounting to the sam of
$1C0,53!.,JI7; tho beneficial effects of wbich
extend to all branches ot business. Tho
estimated revenue for the next fi-cil year
will tmposo upon Congress the duty of
strictly fimitlog appropriations, including
the retiui-ite sum lor the maintenance of the
sinling fund, within the aggregate esti
mate ot receipt". While tho aggregato ol
taxes should not bo increased, amendments
might bo made to tbo revenue laws that
woiild, without diminishing tbe revenue,
relieve the peoplo from unnecessary burden-.
A tax on tea and coffee is shown by
the experience not only ot our own country
but of other countries to be easily collected,
without loss by undcr-valualion or IraniL
and largely borne iu the country ofprotrW
tion. A tai ot ten cents a pound on teaand
two cents a pound on eefleo would produco
a revenue exceeding $12,0'Hi,lHH, and thus
enable Congress to repeal a multitude olan
noying taxes yielding a revenuo not exceed
ing that sum.
THE INTFRNAL REVENUE SVSTIU
grew out of the necessities ol tho war, and
most of tho legislation imposing taxes upon
domestic products under this system has
been repealed by t'io substitution of a tax on
tea and coffee. All forms of internal taxa
tion may be repealed, except that on whis
key, spirits, tobacco and beer.
THE I'ROTKCTION 01" TUE REVEME.
Attention is also called to the necessity ol
enacting more vigorous laws for the protec
tion of tho revenue and for the punishment
ol frauds and j-tnuggling. This can best ho
dono by judicious provisions that will in
duce the disclo-Jura of attempted fraud by
undcr-valuation and smuggling. All revo
nuo laws should be simple in their provis
ions and easily understood Sj bir as prac
ticable, tho rates of taxation should he in
tho form of speeifia duties and not ad va
lorum. requiring th judgmont of experi
enced men io ascertain values, and exposing
tho revenue to tcmptatiun ol fraud.
KEVEM E ALL'dEH.
My attention has been cillej during the
rocess ol Congress to tho abuses existing
in the 4'ollection of custOTis, and strenuous
efforts have been made lor their correction
by executive order--. Tho recommendations
submitted to tbe secretatyof the treasury
by a commission appointed to examine into
tho collection of customs duties at tho port
of New York 4'ontain many suggestions for
the modification ol tho customs law, to
which tho attention of Congress ii invited.
THE 11 IIUC CRFPIT.
It is a matter of congratulation that,
nutw ithstanding tho severe burdens caused
by the war, tho public faith with all credi
tors has been preserved and that as tho
result of this policy the public credit has
continuously advanced, and our public
securities' are regarded with the highest
favor in the markets ol the world. I trust
that no act of the government will casta
hadow upon its eredit. The progress ol
refueling the public debt has been rapid
and stitislactory, under tho contract exist
ing when I entered upon the di-chirge of
tho duties of my office. Honds bearing
interest at the rato of 41 per cent wero being
rapidly sold, and within three months tho
aggregate sales of theso bonds had reached
the sum of $0lH,0lHi.tHH. With my sanc
tion, tne secretary ol the treasury entered
into a now contract lor tho sale ol lour per
cent bonds and within thirty day- alter the
popular subscription lor such bonds was
opened subscriptions wero had amounting
to $75, lUfi.550, which were paid lor within
!M days alter the date ol subscription. Hy
this proeens within hut littlo more than ono
year tht annual interest on tho public debt
was reduced in the sum of $3,775.iHH. I
recommend that suitable provision bo made
to enable tho peoplo to oa-uly convert
their savings into government securities,
as the best mode in winch small
-avings may ho well secured and icld mod
orato interest. It is an oljcvt of public
policy to retain among our own peoplo tho
securities of the United Mutes In this way
our country is guar Jed against their udJen

war or other disturbances beyond our limits,

'I ho commerce of tho I nited Mates with
foreign nations and especially the export

largely increased, hut tho greater propor
tiou ot this tradj is conducted in foreign

speedy interchange with countries un this

is a matter ol great moment ttiit our own

not able and are not cipfcied to do. To

which uro in a ereat measure planned and
executed tor the convenience of the novern

an evident injustice. Special attention is

The case of Fstx.-immons, Democrat and
ex-rebel, who was appointed United States
Marshal of (Icorgia, upon the recommenda
tion of Alexander II. Stephens, has excited
no little attention. The nomination came
up for confirmation in tho Lxecutivc session
ot the Senate, on Saturday ; and the pro
ceedings appear, from what has leaked out
concerning them, to have len ol consider
able interest. According, to the Tribune
rcportSenatorticrdonfirstspokeon the fpies
tion of the confirmation. He said he knew
ihe nominee, and could vouch tor his stand
ing amoDg his people , he was not a Kepuh
lican, but he was a good man, and would
make a good officer. There were few lle
publicans in (jcorgia, and be thought in this
free Government an officer should represent
tho people. Mr. Fitzsimmoa-, he said,
would certainly be satisfactory to the people
of Georgia. Senator Conkling followed. He
repelled the idea of Senator Gordon that a
Republican President could not find in a
State that gave him 80,000 Republican votes
one man among thee &0,0(HJ fit to hold tho
office of Marshal. "Where," he asked, "is
Joshua Hill, who once had a eat in this
chamber? Where is Amos T. Akerman,
once AttorncyGencral of the Lnttcd States?
Where is James A. Longstreet, the bravest
of Confederate Generals, who", at the close
of the war, joined the Republican party, as
the party ofloyalty and honesty ' He said
that Senators on the other side of
the chamber might pretend to the President
and to the Senate that such appointments as
that of Mr. Fittsimmons were for the good
of the country, and they might delude the
President into such belief ; but Republicans
out not to be deceived , uch appointments
were not for the good of the country, but for
the gool of the Democratic party. Senator
Edmunds followed Mr. Conkling in much
the same strain. Mr. Hoar said he approved
Mr. Hayes's Southern policy, but in tho
present ca.se he doubted the wisdom of the
President, and should vote against the con
firmation ot Mr. Fitzsimmons. He thought
the President should have appointed Mr.
Huff, who was recommended in tho strong
est terms by both parties. The dl-cussioa
lasted neariy three hours. Senators OorJon
and Hill were the only Democrats who
spoke. The vote on the confirmation was
22 for and 17 against. Many Senators were
paired and many were absent. Judge Davis
voted with the Democrats. Only three Re
publicans yoted In favor of the confirmation,
Matthew!i, Patterson and Conovcr.

Postal Notice. -The Postmaster-Goncral
has addressed tbo following letter to pot
masters throughout tbe country
Postmasters aro required to keep a com
plaint book in which all letters reported to
them as lost are to be entered , md after
making examination in their offices, they
are required to report tho loss at once. Tho
public are also invited to report promptly
all loses or irregularitfes to thechicf pecial
agent, pototGce department, Wahington,
D. C, and investigation will follow It all
losses should be promptly reported it will
be the means ot correcting the irregular

will be enhanced in a mo-t important de

address of letters is one ot the great causes
of delay and niissending.
