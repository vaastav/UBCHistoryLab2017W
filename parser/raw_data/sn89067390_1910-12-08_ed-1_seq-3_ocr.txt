PRESIDENT POINTS OUT NECES
SITY OF CURTAILING EXPEN
SES TO LAWMAKERS. .
ANNUAL DOCUMENT IS READ
Conservation, Ship Subsidy and For
tification of Panama Canal Lead
ing Topics Discussed Has
Little to Say About Tariff.
Washington, Dec. 6 Economy in
government affairs is the keynote of
President Taffs annual message read
before both houses of congress today.
The message approximates 40,000
words and is one of the longest ever
submitted by a president.
Conservation of the public domain,
ship subsidy, fortification of the Pana
ma canal and the continuation of the
present tariff board are the leading
subjects touched upon. He also re
views the work of the various gov
ernment departments and concurs in
recommendation, tending toward the
bettering of the service, made by sev
eral of the members of his cabinet.
Economy Is Urged.
In dwelling on the urgent need for
economy in government expenditures, the
president says: "Every effort has been
made by oach department chief to reduce
the estimated cost of his department for
the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30,
1912. I say this in order that congress
may understand that these estimates thus
made present the smallest sum which will
maintain the departments, bureaus and
offices of the government and meet its
other obligations under existing law. and
that a cut of these estimates would re
sult In embarrassing the executive branch
of the government in the performance of
Its duties. This remark does not apply
to the river and harbor estimates, except
to those for expenses of maintenance and
the meeting of obligations under author
ized contracts, nor does it apply to the
public building bill nor to the navy build
ing program. Of course, as to these con
gress could withhold any part or all of
the estimates for them without interfer
ing with the discharge of the ordinary ob
ligations of these functions of its depart
ments, bureaus and offices.
"Against the estimates of expenditures
$U0,4!M,013.12, we have estimated receipts
for next year $S0.(KtO,0OO, making a proba
ble surplus of ordinary receipts over or
dinary expenditures of about $T0,000.000, or
taking into account the estimates for the
Panama canal, which are $TG.920,S47.69, and
which will ultimately be paid in bonds,
it will leave a deficit for the next year of
about $7,000,000, if congress shall conclude
to fortify the canal."
Wants Forest Limitation Removed.
On the subject of conservation he de
votes considerable space to forest, coal,
oil and gas, phosphate lands and water
power sites. As to the reservation of
forest lands he says: "The law now pro
hibits the reservation of any more forest
lands in Oregon, "Washington, Idaho,
Montana, Colorado and Wyoming, except
by act of congress. I am informed by the
department of agriculture that the gov
ernment owns other tracts of timber land
in these states which should be Included
In the forest reserves. I recommend to
congress that the limitation herein im
posed be repealed.
"Congress ought to trust the executive
to use the power of reservation only with
respect to land most valuable for forest
purposes. During the present administra
tion, W.250,000 acres of land largely non
timbered have been excluded from forest
reserves, and 3,500,000 acres of land prin
cipally valuable for forest purposes have
been Included in forest reserves, making
a reduction in forest reserves of non
timbered land amounting to 2,730,000
acres."
Wants Canal Fortified.
, Regarding the Panama canal, the presi
dent asserts that unless unexpected ob
stacles arise the waterway will be com
pleted well within time limit of Janu
ary 1. 1915, and within estimate of cost.
$375,000,000. Suggestions for levying of
tolls and management are made, and re
garding fortification of the canal, he
Bays:
"Among questions arising for present
solution is the decision whether the canal
shall be fortified. I- have already stated
to the congress that I strongly favor for
tification and I now reiterate this opin
ion and ask your consideration of the
subject in the light of the report already
before you made by a competent board.
"Failure to fortify the canal would
leave the attainment of both these alms
in the position of rights and obligations
which we should be powerless to enforce
and which could never in any way be ab
solutely safeguarded against a desperate
and Irresponsible, enemy."
Ship Subsidy.
The president urges such action as he
believes will increase American trade
abroad, and says::
"Another Instrumentality indispensable
to the unhampered and natural develop
ment of American commerce is merchant
marine. All maritime and commercial na
tions recognize the Importance of this
factor. The greatest commercial nations
our competitors, jealously foster their
merchant marine. Perhaps nowhere Is
the need for rapid and direct mail, pas
senger and freight communication quite
so urgent as between the United States
and Latin America. We can-secure in no
other quarter of the world such imme
diate benefits in friendship and com
merce as would flow from the establish
ment of direct lines of communication
with the countries of Iatin America ade
quate to meet the requirements of a rap
idly Increasing appreciation of the reci
procal dependence of the countries of the
western hemisphere upon e.rch other's
products, sympathies and assistance.
"I alluded to this most Important sub
ject In my last annual message; it has
often been before you and I need not re
capitulate the reasons for its recommen
dation. Unless prompt action be taken

"I wonder why there are so many

"Probably because so many people

His Selection.
"I am afraid to go near Sharp's
house or to meet him; he has such a

"But you must remember that
Sharp considers himself such a cynic

Department of the Interior.
Seymour Did you visit the depart
ment of the Interior while you were
tlon unable to avail In International mari
time business of this great contribution to
the means of the world's commercial in
tercourse." Criticism of the Tariff.
In the space devoted to the tariff the
president says:
"The schedules of the rates of duty In
the Payne tariff act have been subjected
to a great deal of criticism, some of it
just, more of it unfounded, and too much
misrepresentation. The act was adopted
tn pursuance of a declaration by the par
ty which is responsible for it that cus
toms bill should be a tariff for the pro
tection of home industries, the measure
of the protection to be the difference be
tween the cost of producing the imported
article abroad and the cost of producing
It at home, together with sich addition to
that difference as might give a reasonable
profit to the home producer. The basis
for the criticism of this tariff is that in
respect to a number of the schedules tha
declared measure was not followed, but a
higher difference retained or inserted by
way of undue discrimination in favor of
certain industries and manufactures. Lit
tle, if any, of the criticism of the tariff
has been directed against the protective
principle above stated; but the main body
of the criticism has been based on the at
tempt to conform to the measure of pro
tection was not honestly and sincerely
adhered to."
The president also refers to the appoint
ment of a board of experts to investigate
the cost of production of various articles
included in the schedules of the tariff,
and concludes:
"Whether or not the protective policy Is
to be continued, and the degree of protec
tion to be accorded to our home Indus
tries, are questions which the people must
decide through their chosen representa
tives. But whatever policy Is adopted. It
Is clear that the necessary legislation
should be based on an impartial, thor
ough and continuous study of the facts."
Recommends Parcels Post.
The adoption of the parcels post Is
again adopted. On this subject President
Taft says: "With respect to the parcels
post, I respectfully recommend Its adop
tion on all rural delivery routes, and that
11 pounds the International limit be
made the limit of carriage in such post.
The same argument is made against the
parcels post that was made against the
postal savings bank that it Is Introduc
ing the government into a business which
should be conducted by private persons
anil is paternalism. The postoffice depart
ment has a great plant and a great or
ganization, reaching into the most remot.
hamlet of the United States, and with
this machinery it Is able to do a great
many things economically that If a .new
organization were necessary It would be
Impossible to do without extravagant ex
penditures." Department of Justice.
Discussing the affairs of the department
of justice, the president says:
"I invite especial attention to the prose
cutions under the federal law of the so
called 'bucket shops,' and of those
schemes to defraud in which the use of
the mall is an essential part of the
fraudulent conspiracy, prosecutions whlclv
have saved Ignorant and weak members
of the public and are saving them hun
dreds of millions of dollars. The viola
tions of the anti-trust law present per
haps the most important litigation before
the department, and the number of cases
filed shows the activity of the govern
ment in enforcing that statute.
"In a special message last year I
brought to the attention of congress the
propriety and wisdom of enacting a gen
eral law providing for the incorporation
of industrial and other companies engaged
in Interstate commerce, and I renew my
recommendation In that behalf."
The crying need in the United States
of cheapening the cost of litigation by
simplifying judicial procedure and ex
pediting final judgment is pointed out and
action looking to correction of these evils
is urged.
The president recommends an increase
in the salaries of federal judges. '
Postal Affairs.
Tn regard to postal matters the presi
dent points with pride to its present effi
cient management and the recent reduc
tion In the deficit. The present unre
stricted franking privilege comes In for
comment with a suggestion for the adop
tion of better methods for Its regulation.
Abolish Navy Yards.
The president calls attention to certain
reforms urged by the secretary of the
navy which he recommends for adoption,
and continues:
"The secretary of the navy has given
personal examination to every navy yard,
and "has studied the uses of the navy
yards with reference to the necessities
of our fleet. With a fleet considerably
less than half the size of that of the
British navy, we have shipyards more
than double the number, and there are
several of these shipyards expensively
equipped with modern mchinery. which,
after investigation the secretary of the
navy believes to be entirely useless fcrr
naval purposes. He asks authority to
abandon certain of them and to move
their machinery to other places, where it
can be made of use."
Speaking of our foreign relations the
president says: "During the past year
the foreign relations of the United States
have continued upon a basis of friendship
and good understanding.
"The year has been notable as witness
ing the pacific settlement ot two Impor
tant international controversies before the
permanent court of The Hague.
"The arbitration of the fisheries dispute
between the United States and Great
Britain, which has been the source of
nearly continuous diplomatic correspond
ence since the fisheries convention of 1S18,
has given an award which is satisfactory
to both parties. This arbitration is par
ticularly noteworthy nt only because of
the eminently just results secured, but
also because it is the first arbitration held
under the general arbitration treaty of
April 4, 1908, between the United States
and Great Britain, and disposes of a'con
troversy the settlement of which has re
sisted every other resource of diplomacy
and which for nearly ninety years has
been the cause of friction between two
countries whose common interest lies in
maintaining the most friendly and cordial
relations with each other.
President Taft makes a few recommen
dations for changes in the interstate com
merce law and says:
"Except as above, I do not recommend
any amendment to the Interstate com
merce law as it stands. I do not now
recommend any amendment to the anti
trust law. In other words, it seems to
me that the existing legislation with
reference to the regulation of corpora
tions and the restraint of their business
has reached a point where we can stop
for a while and witness the effect of the
vigorous execution of the laws of the
statute books in restraining the abuses
which certainly did exist and which
roused the public to demand reform "

NEW ERA III FINANCE
ACCURACY AND PUBLICITY
PROVES TO BE A POPULAR
'MOTTO.
(fi
Prompt Response to "Bold Move .of
President Vail. "Accuracy" Reduc
ed Western Union'slrSurplus $13,-0O0,0OO--"Publiclty"
Restored Con
fidence and Its Stock Went Up.
Are the great financiers of the
country beginning to see a new light?
Time was, until recently in fact, when
the men at the head of the big cor
porations "kept their business to
themselves," as far as the law would
allow. Capable men at the head of the
big concerns, long realized the weak
ness of their position, but what was
needed obviously, as in all great re
forms, was an unmistakable occasion
and a courageous man. The occasion
arose in the purchase of the Western
Union Telegraph company by the
American Telephone and Telegraph
company, and the man appeared rn
Theodore N. Vail, President of the
purchasing corporation.
It was last December when public
announcement was made that the
Gould holdings of Western Union had
been taken over by the Telephone
company.
On account of the high esteem in
which the management of the tele
phone company is so generally held,
great things were predicted as a re
sult of the absorption of Western
Union. By the press of the country
the "deal" was most favorably com
mented on, it being widely pointed
out that .under the direction of such
men as Theodore N. Vail and his as
sociates, the telegraph company was
bound soon td work Itself into a po
sition where It could offer the public
far more efficient service than It had
ever before been able to offer.
But a very few months had elapsed
when it became apparent to the new
management that a modern and up-to-date
appraisal of the company's
assets wrould make possible a far
greater degree of efficiency of oper
ation. "Here," they said to them
selves, "we've bought control of this
property and we know it's immensely
valuable, but we don't know just
how valuable. These appraisals of
real estate and securities owned were
made a long time ago. If we have
a complete inventory made of every
thing we've got we can announce the
facts to the public, start a new set of
books, and begin our responsibility
to stockholders right there."
How Inventory Was Taken.
The most expert accountants and
appraisers to be had were put at the
task. Their labors lasted over eight
months. Their report and its publi
cation by the company marks an ep
och In finance.
It began by recommending an ad
justment of the difference between
the' appraised and book values by a
charge of $5,595,09 against sur
plus. Book values of securities held
were reduced to market values, bad
and doubtful accouitif were "charg
ed off," an allowance of $2,000,000
was made for "depreciation," another
of $500,000 for "reserve," and so on,
until the old surplus of $18,867,000
came down to $5,136,000.
It required courage, the publication
of this statement to stockholders, say
ing in effect: "The property of
your company has been reval
ued: the surplus isn't nineteen mill
Ions, as you have been led Jto be
lieve, but five millions," but it was
the truth, and President Vail did not
flinch. "Accuracy aha publicity," he
declared, was essential. "The stock
holder has a right to know. The
shares of this company are scatter
ed from one end of the Union to the
other. This is more than a private
corporation. It is a great national
enterprise. The public is entitled to
the facts.'
The report was ordered published
forthwith. Financiers of the old
school and speculators generally were
aghast. What would happen? Would
the bottom drop out of Western
Union when the shareholders realiz
ed that their propetry was worth
$13,000,000 less than they had sup
posed? But the amazing thing
happened. The stock went up and
stayed up. The public had respond
ed to this remarkable display of
frankness and confidence: to the new
motto, "Accuracy and Publicity."
The full significance of the action
of the new board is stated concisely
by Harper's Weekly' in these words:
"Is this policy of publicity and of
open-handed dealing with sharehold
ers and public the forerunner of a
similar movement on the part of oth
er big corporations? Certainly It is
to be hopedthat it is. In the case
of these big companies, dependent
upon public patronage and doing busi
ness under public franchise, can
there be any question of the right of
the people to know? .
"That right Is being recognized.
It is recognized now in this epochal
act on the part of the telephone and
telegraph interests. ' It is the dawn
of a new era In corporation finance."
Timeliness.
All measures of reformation are ef
fective in exact proportion to their
timeliness; partial decay may be cut
away and cleansed ; incipient error
corrected; ,but there is a point at
which corruption can no more be
stayed, nor wandering recalled. It
has been the manner of modern phil
anthropy to remain passive until that
precise period, and to leave the sick
to perish, and the foolish to stray,
while it spent itself In frantic exer
tions to raise the dead, and reform the
dust. Rnskln.
