The tariff conference of la* summer bat already
born fruit in two note worthy utterance* by men
holding distinguished positions in public life. Mr.
Carlisle's speech in accepting his election to
tbe s;ieakershlp was m plain statement that tbe
business before tbe House i his session was to revise
tbe tax laws and to prevent tbe further accumu
lation of a dangerous surplus In tlie Treasury.
Yasterday congress received from the President
hi* aanuil message, which la devoted almost ex
r.isaively to a discussion of the tax question. This
Indicate* that the President and the speaker are
in aconl on this subject, and fully aroused to the
necessity of prompt and vigorous action on the
part <c congress to relieve the threatened strin
gency in th? money market.
The Speaker, by a pleasant Act ion. Is supposed to
require time enough, after his election, to get per
sonally acquainted with tbe Kcpresentatlvee be
tore apportioning them among tbe committees:
but, of course, Mr. CarUlse knew that he was going
to be the Speaker of the present Mouse long before
he was called to the chair, and tbe leading mem
ber* of the several cuiauiiiu-es are always se
lected from the older representatives, with
wboti: the Speaker Is already acquainted
while the newer ones are used merely to
pad oat the lists, llence it Is probable that
with one or two exceptions, Mr. Carlisle
ha* already settled In his mind, pretty definitely,
the committee status of each of his associates In
the House. There is no reaaon why the committee
appointments should not be published early m the
session and tbe House enabled to get well to work
before the holiday s. At all events, even If nothing
more were done for the present, the same plan
mlgh: be pursued this year aa was followed at the
beginning of the Forty-ninth Congress, when tbe
committee on rules was named at the outset, and
the time occupied by the debate on Its report was
used with good effect by the Speaker In making
out the composition of the other committees. The
rule which It Is proposed to revive could be re
ported by the committee and got out of the way,
and the path would then be clear for the Introduc
tion of b usines* legislation, which the country so
much needs.
The Mew Tort .Vun enters a very proper protest
again* changing the color of the two cent pontage
stamps f-om brown to green, and takes tbe ground
that neither Mr. Dickinson nor any other man
ahouM be confirmed as Postmaster General with
out first pledging himself to abolish the green and
restore the old color. The Sun is undoubtedly
correct as to tbe matter of taste Involved; bat It
dor* not go far enough. The (act la, the power to
change at will the design and color of the postage
stamps should be wholly taken away from tbe
post office department. Congress ought to ap
point a permanent art commission to whom should
be committed tbe duty of fixing the design and
color not of postage stamps alone, but of all
1'hlted states currency notes, bonds and securi
ties of every character, and also the size, device,
etc., of its coins, ot whatever value. At present
the appearance of government Issues ot all kinds
seems to be at the mercy of lmresponstble subor
dinates In official power, for the time being, who
as a rule hare no qualifications whatever for that
duty. The result Is not only confusing, on ac
count of th? great variety In form, size, color Ac.,
put positively discreditable to the country In an
esthetic point of view. They manage these things
better, not only In France, but in nearly every civ
ilized Country In the world.
The plumbers who questioned the power Of the
commissioners to make and enforce the new plumb
ing regulations. requiring with other things the
prellmlaary examination and licensing of plumbers
wishing to ply their trade in the District, and oft.
ject?-l u> certain parts of the regulations as op
pressive, have come out ahead In the legal contest.
It to dedded that present provisions of law do not
authorize the commissioners to provide such safe
guard* for the public. As the exclusive power la
in con grew to furnish to the people of Washington
that full protection against the evils of defective
plumbing which modern investigation shows to be
a necessity. It is hoped that our legislative body
wtll Interest Itself In the matter. While the public
Is not disposed to inflict petty annoyances and re
strictions upon our plum ben, it is in the highest
degree desirable that every reasonable precaution
be taken to avoid the recognized das.'ers from de
fective material and Incompetent workmen. The
very nature of the plumbers' work furnishes the
opportunity and excuse for public supervision, and
In the interest of the District the opportunity of
fer*) in the present case should not be neglected
by congress.
Considerable excitement was caused In New
Tort yesterday by the circulation of a report that
Katie Metz, the servant whose testimony played
so important a part in the prosecution of the
Doodle aldermen by showing who were admitted
to attend tbe meetings of the "combine," had been
Induced to go to Kurope and keep out of the way
of subpoenas for a while. The story Is set at rest,
however, as far as the woman's present where
abouts are concerned, by a statement ot a reporter
of the World that he saw and talked with her last
evening, since the defeat of DeLancey Nleoll, tbe
offer of tbe Assistant District,Attorneyship to one
ot Jacob Sharp's leading counsel, and the decision
of the court or appeals in the Sharp case Itself, it
Is doubtful whether the untried boodlers still re
mainlcg in New York would be in a hurry to pay
the expenses of a tour abroad for any witness
however dangerous to their cause under tbe old
conditions. There are other and easier ways of
getting out of trouble, and the increase ot expen
ses would be money thrown away.
Tbe character of the President's message sug
gests the strong probability that there will be a live
aad recognized issue between the political parties
la tbe next presidential campaign. A square fight
over an important qu stion or political economy,
which will set tie something when ended, is much
to be <1e*ir?d. The movement of a part of the
conservatives in England towards protection
promises a lively political contest across the
water, and the democratic movement away from
protection in this country will lead to aa even
more netting aad Interesting contest.
These is occasionally a consoling feature to be
found in the business barriers which have grown
up between Canada and the I nlted States since
Mr John Macdoaald's tariff went into operation.
The panic which has threatened tbe Dominion
?lace the failure of tbe Central Bank of Toronto
has not mad* itself felt to say extent on this side
of tbe border exi-ept among the direct correspon
dents of the suspended bank. Had the commer
cial relations between the two countries been more
intimate and tbe balance of trade as largely In our
favor, aa It would naturally bare been without
the tariff, we ot tbe United States could hardly
nave escaped a shock.
The appointment, by tbe United states Marshal
at Trenton, 9.J., of his daughter to serve as bis
deputy aad sign all papers in his name. Is treated
by the newagatberen as a remarkable thing?not
because the Marshal placed bis appointment
within tbe circle of his own family, but because
the person chosen to be thus honored was a wo
rn in. Those who marvel at this incident fall to
recall the case of ptuebe couzena, who was gal
lantly appointed to the full om -e of marshal by
one of the Justices of the Supreme court, but
removed by President Cleveland to make room lor
a big. bold man.
The northwest grows so fast that the coal sup
ply to that section cannot keep pace with its
growth. Heme tbe coal famine. And when the
osal arrives with the increased price at the mines
aad extortionate freight charges added, many
cannot buy. it is a cold season tor the booming
sorts west. "Oh: the dreary, chilling winter,"
sighs Dakota, "with no coal and no statehood:"
