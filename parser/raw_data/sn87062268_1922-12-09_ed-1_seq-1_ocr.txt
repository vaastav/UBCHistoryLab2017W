FIRST ARTICLE TOMORROW. HIS ANSWER TO CLEMENCEAU
.jd (ieorge will write exclusively during the
p,; ;.n twelve months for The Pensacola Journal
ruU, ot newspapers in this country, and the London
(hnnicio and representative continental papers
abroad. The first article of a series of thirty articles
which appear at weekly intervals at first, then at
intervals of a fortnight will appear in The Pensacola
Journal tomorrow, December 9, and will constitute
Lloyd-George's reply to the charges of Clemenceau,
made during his present American tour. In subse
quent articles the war premier of Great Britain will
discuss the British to the United States, treaty, repara
tions, the Irish question, the socialist menace, prohibi
tion, relations between Great Britain and the United
States, and the Turkish treaty.
World rights to the publication of the scries,
which will unquestionably form the most momentous
piece of writing to reach print in that time, are owned,
with the exception of Great Britain and Ireland, by the
United States Syndicate, for whom Lloyd-George will
write exclusively during the year 1923.
The Lloyd-George articles will appear in Pensa
cola only in The Pensacola Journal and deal with pres
ent day problems, as they arise from week to week.

Corry Favors North
Shore Route for
Proposed Ferry
Pass Highway
Accompanied by the entire board
of county commissioners and County
Engineer "VC. E. "Wheat, Hon. William
M. Corry, West Florida's member of
the tat - road department, gave the
Escambia county road situation the
once-over yesterday. The party spent
practically the entire day riding over
the various highways now under con
struction and the routes of those- un
der contemplation.
They also were treated by the naval
air station officials with a boat trip
across to 'the gulf in one of the gov
ernment speed boats. Mr. Corry was
much impressed, he said, with the
trip.
"The north shore drive,' Mr. Corry
told members of his party, "if select
ed as the route for the pi-oposed high
way to Ferry Pass, and built along
the shores of Escambia bay as far
and near as practicable, will be one
of Pensacola and Escambia county's
best assets."
Mr. Corry openly expressed his
preference for this route, which leads
from the Bayou Texar bridge nearly
to Gull Point and then across to the
present Ferry Pass road, over the
route suggested out Davis street to
Ferry Pass bridge site.
The East Pensacola route, the pro
posed North Shore drive. Mr. Corry
declared, would give Escambia a
highway along the banks of one of
the most beautiful stretches of water
to be found anywhere, while the high
elevation overlooking the bay, per
mitting cooling breezes at all times,
also came in as a strong point in
favor of that route.
Mr. Corry during nls visit was
thoroughly impressed with the neces
sity of the proposed Ferry Pass
bridge, which would complete the
bridging of every stream of any size
between Pensacola and Jacksonville.
This bridge is now a certainty, it is
said. Only formal approval of the
Washington authorities is needed be
fore bids can be advertised for and
the actual work of building the struc
ture something tne peopie 01 emue
West Florida have longed for and
worked for will begin.
Mr. and Mrs. Corry and their
daughter, Mrs. Willhoit, who attended
the dedication of Corry Field named
in honor of their son, the late Liieu-tenant-Commander
William Corry,
Thursday, -left for their home at
Quincy on the 6:55 train last night.

attended the celebration Thursday,

Clemenceau Sees An
"Overture" In Pass
age of President's
Message
(By Associated Press)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. Georges
Clemenceau, closing his visit to Wash
ington this afternoon with a "formal"
address, expressed the hope that dU
plomacy would find the wayto bring
America back to European affairs
through what he Interpreted as an
"overture," by President Harding in
the annual message the executive had
read to congress a few hours earlier.
"I was greatly comforted," said the
war-time premier of France, "when I
read in the message of your president
the following lines. They are not very
long, but they are very suggestive.
"The four-power yact, which aboli
ishes every probability of war on the
Pacific, has brought a new confidence
in maintained peace, and I can well
believe it might be made a model for
like assurances where ever in the
world any common interests are con
cerned." "So you see," conttnued the Tiger,
"that even those who are supposed to
disagree, really agree at the very bot
tom of their feeling and reasoning
power. That is what I ask, and I hope
this is something like an overture, that
some light will be coming, and I will
be very glad if it comes from Amer
ica, and I hope that diplomacy will
have something to say about it, and
talks may be engaged in, which, I am
sure, can bring nothing but good for
us all."
When Clemenceau's reference to the
president's message was called to the
attention of the White -House, it was
said there was no comment to be made
and that there was no intention of
elaborating on the president's state
ment to congress.
Clemencau's address, delivered be
fore an audience which included many
diplomats, government officials and
members of both houses of congress,
was in its essence the "peace mes
sage" he first delivered in Chicago.
But. apparently sensing that official
Washington would judge of him and
his mission by his speech, he spoke
dcliberately.and choose his words with
great precision.

DOINGS OF THE DUFFS" WHAT ARE THEY? SH-H-H! MYSTERY!
And now mystery breaks into the
everyday life of the Duff family. Tom
Duff, usually to be found at home in
the evening, has started stepping out
for just a short time. Where does
he go? That's what Helen Duff
would like to know.
And then comes another angle
Helen Duff refuses to let Tom enter
a certain room in the Duff home.
She holds the key and keeps the
door locked.- What's in this room?
That's what Tom would like to know.
So would Danny and Olivia ! . .
Perhaps you can solve, in your
own mind, what the answer to the
Duff double mystery is. Every day it
seems to get farther away from so
lution. Watch the "Doings of the
