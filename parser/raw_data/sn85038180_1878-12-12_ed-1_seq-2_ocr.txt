THE STANDARD.
r. MACKLEY, Editor.
fHCBSDAT, - - - DEC. 5. 1878.
The New York Times, the leading Re
publican paper in the United States,
scores the limber-backed President for
his weak and meaningless message.
The Ilamden Leader is dead. The ed
itor says the principal cause of its death
was "non-support." We think that was
a sufficient reason, without going farther.
A drunkard in Cincinnati, named Bob
Barr, died in a warehouse, and when his
body was found tho flesh was all eaten
from the bones by rats.

tion's back bone see Message." N. Y.
Tribune.
Well, we have seen the Message, but
we fail to see any traces of back-bone.
The notorious John O'Connor, late of
tho Penitentiary, and later Democratic
member of the Ohio Legislature, was
tried last week in the U. S. Court at Cin
cinnati, and found guilty of forging pen
eion papers.
About one o'clock last Thursday a boil
er in the Hayden rolling mill, at Colum
bus, exploded, instantly killing two young
men, named Richard Berry and Richard
Freeland, and wounding five or six others,
some of whom will probably die.
The Springfield Republic thinks that
there are not over 250 prostitutes in
Springfield, although the preachers have
been estimating tho number at 1000.
Perhaps they know best.
On last Thursday night George M.
Schaeffer was shot and killed by George
Leighty at Germantown, Ohio. Schaeffer
was drunk, and attacked Leighty with a
chair, when Leighty shot him in the
forehead.
Katy Flannigan, aged 14 years, resid
ing two and a half miles from Zaleski,
Vinton county, was kicked by a horse a
week ago last Sunday, and died an hour
afterwards. She had led the horse to the
well, to give it water, and she was hold
ing it by the halter, when it turned and
kicked her in the side.
"Every sixty days James Emmitt pays
the Government ninety-five thousand,
five hundred and sevety-four thousand
dollars in the way of taxes on whisky.
Mr. Emmitt is one of the main supporters
of our Government." Waverly Watch
man. Somehowt we do- not understand the
above. Will the Watchman try again?
The Cincinnati Times of Saturday even
ing, received here on Monday morning,
contained two news items for which
thanksgiving should be rendered. A
German doggery keeper at Hamilton, O.,
named John A. Weigel, shot and killed
himself, and a doggery keeper at Chica
go, named John McMahon, was shot and
killed by a medical student named J. C.
Hayward. Weigel shot his wife through
the heart before he shot himself.
Last week we stated, on what we had
seen in the Cincinnati papers, that there
was a strike, and considerable trouble,
over about Bainbridge and Greenfield, on'
the Narrow Gauge road. The Springfield
Republic says these reports were greatly
exaggerated, and that the strikers were
tramps, working temporarily, and that
they have been paid and discharged.

We dp not blame you, or any other
Democrat, for taking vengeance upon old

do to you that you should desire to send
such a calamity upon them ?
Another "nigger" has been lynched.
This time at Franklin, Louisiana. He
was taken from jail, and his body has
not been found, but blood was discover
ed, and it is feared that the chivalry cut
his throat, and thus denied themselves
the exquisite pleasure of witnessing his
tortures while burning at the stake. He
was accused of attempting to outrage a
woman and a little girl too. There must
always be a small girl in these cases.
Now let us raise a few more pennies
from S. S. children to send the gospel to
the heathens in Africa.
"In the case of Justice Pinckney shock
ing evidence was taken yesterday. New
York haB had many drunkards for Civil
and Police Justices, but they have usually
kept nearly if not qnite sober while on
the bench. P.inckney, according to the
testimony of his chief clerk, had bottles
of liquor on a shelf behind his judicial
seat, and tooks drinks openly while trials
were going on. It was frequently neces
sary, owing to his drunken incoherency,
to adjourn the court. Here is, indeed,
an example for temperance speakers to
point to." N. Y. Sun.
If the Sun had had the experience with
drunken Judges that the people of South
ern Ohio have had, it would not be so
shocked at the conduct of Justice Pinck
ney.
Settled on Charley.
Findlay Jeffersonian, Nov. 29. J
A number of Republicans have been
named in connection with the office of
Governor of Ohio, but politicians may as
well quit it. The people have settled on
Charley Foster as the man, ; .d they
mean to control that matter themseves.
We find the above in the Fostoria Re
view, and the Springfield Republic is
still mouthing about this man Foster.
We intend to publish, soon, the testimo
ny of Mr. Roberts and Maj. Burke, touch
ing Foster's part in turning the solid
South over to the rebels, and will ask
these three papers to publish it. No one
has ever questioned the truthfulness of
these witnesses.
A GLORIOUS GOVERNNENT.
Read the letter of Hon. John Sherman,
Secretary of the Treasury, published on
the outside of the Standard this week,
and then read the following, from the
official report of Attorney Gen. Devens :
'A frequent outrage upon the purity
of the ballot was in what is familiarly
known as 'ballot-box stuffing,' and con
sisted in preparing the boxes by deposit
ing therein before the voting commenced,
or after it was concluded, large numbers
of fraudulent ballots, and also by folding
smaller ballots within largo ones in such
a way that they could be shaken out by
the voter as he deposited his ballot, or
afterward by those who had the custody
of the box. This fraud was accomplished
by the use of small ballots printed upon
tissue-paper, and was perpetrated in so
many different places, and with tickets
so carefully prepared, and of such simi
arity, that it cannot be doubted that it
was tho result of an organized conspiracy
of some central directing agency to de
feat the will of the people, and falsify the
true result of the election. The canvass
and election were accompanied in the
State of Louisiana by a series of cowardly
and cruel murders, the only apparent
motive for which was to prevent the col
ored people from exercising their right
of suffrage. These murders occurred in
Caddo, Tensas, Natchitoches, and other
paiishes. It has been my duty to advise
the proper subordinate officers of the de
partment in such manner as seemed best
calculated to secure the ends of justice,
to promptly assert and enforce the au
thority of the laws of the United Statos
in order to bring to justice those who
have violated them. 1 have seen no rea
son to believe that any arrests which
they have caused to be made have not
been fully justified, or that they have act
ed otherwise than as their duty, plainly
demanded. Tho attempt to bring to
justice the violators of the law has, how
ever, been followed by a system of perse
cution of United States officers, and of
witnesses who have been called to testify
in regard to the transactions complained
of, which cannot be too severely con
demned. The resistance to the laws of
the United States has in some instances
taken tho form of brutal violence, but
more generally that of complaints and
prosecutions under the State laws for
alleged offenses. In such proceedings
bail has sometimes been refused, or fixed
at amounts so exorbitant that the accus
ed coulel not be expected to be able to
obtain it. The character of theso prose
cutions may perhaps be better under
stood when it i3 observed that large num
bers of them are for alleged perjuries
committed before United States Commis
sioners or the courts of the United States,
offenses of which it is entirely clear that
the States have no jurisdiction. It will
be my effort fairly but decidedly to do
all in my power to execute the laws of
the United States, regarding the purity
of elections in the Bame way as all its
other laws, and to bring to justice those
who have violated them. Some addition
to the anticipated expenses of this de
partment for the current year may be
occasioned by doing this thoroughly, and
the means for meeting these should be
provided by Congress. I respectfully
submit to the consideration of Congress
whether additional provisions may not be
made more effectively to protect officers
of the United States and witnesses sum
moned on its behalf against causeless
prosecutions, and to enable them to trans
fer the examination of them to the courts
of the United States."
The N. Y. Times is severe upon the
imbecility of the President's message,
and the Cincinnati Gazette, in the course
of a weak defense, says :
"We have not failed to lament the
crushing out of Republicanism at the
South, not so much on political grounds
as because it was done at the cost of the
Constitution and law, and over the pros
trate rights of citizens; but if the New
York Times, or any other complaining
journal, has pointed out the way through
which the President could have brought
a different result, we have failed to see it.
For ourselves, anxious as we are to see
the Constitution and the laws enforced at
the South as they are at the North, we
have been unable to suggest any policy
different from that which was per
suaded." That is substantially what old Buchan
an said about secession and war, in his
last annual message to Congress, in De
cember, 1860. It is the same old copper
head cry that was heard from 1860 to
1865 "No coercion." If our Govern
ment is such a miserable affair as is
claimed by the Gazetfe, and if there is no
remedy for the condition of the country,
as represented by these Cabinet officers,
let the miserable thing be destroyed at
once. A monarchy, a despotism any
thing but anarchy, ought to be tried and
tested. There is no Government now
existing upon the face of the earth so
powerless, inefficient, and utterly con
temptible, as is ours, under Hayos and
his gang.
RAILROAD MEETING.
Posters had been out several days,
calling a meeting of the stockholders of
the S., J. & P. R. R., to be held at the
Court House on Monday night. The
meeting was well attended. On motion
of I. T. Monahan, D. Macklsy was called
to the chair. The chairman asked for
the object of the meeting, when Hon.
Jame3 Emmitt stated that the Officers
and Directors had failed to make tho
necessary reports, and the stockholders
desired to know all about the affairs of
the road. Ho had a large amount inves
ted in the road, more than any other ten
men among the stockholders. Mr. Em
mitt then passed up a Waverly paper,
and had read a series of resolutions pass
ed by a meeting of stockholders at Wa
verly. A motion was made to adopt
these resolutions, which led to extended
debate, participated in by Mr. Emmitt,
Mr. Chapman, I. T. Monahan, Moses
Sternberger, Levi Dungan, Thomas M.
Jones, and others. Mr. Sternberger said
that we had been told at the beginning,
that $6000 per mile would finish and
stock the road, but now it had cost more
than double that amount, and there
must be something "rotten in Denmark."
Mr. Chapman stated that the road had
cost, up to this time, about $1,350,000;
tho indebtedness is about $793,000 ; the
earnings of the road have rapidly in
creased, -being about $15,000 for the
month of November, one half of that
being net earnings. No Officer or Direc
tor received any pay, except himself. He
had been promised $150 per month, for
devoting his entire time to the interests
of the road. The Secretary got $1000
per year, and the Clerk $65 per month.
He said a full and complete report would
be published soon, giving in detail, not
only what the present management had
been doing, but what had been done
during Mr. Emmitt's administration.
There were some sharp words between
Mr. Chapman and Mr. Emmitt, showing
that their love for each other does not
surpass the love existing between David
and Jonathan.
Irvine Dungan offered a substitute for
the resolutions, as follows :
Substitute for the resolutions offered
by Mr. Emmitt :
"Whereas, We have learned that the
officers of the S., J. & P. R. R. Co. have
individually advanced a large amount of
money for the use of the road, therefore
"Resolved, By the stockholders of Jack
son and vicinity, that we ask of the offi
cers of said road to make a complete
statement of the condition of the road ;
its cost, the amount of indebtedness and
how secured ; al60 the amount of bonds
issued, how disposed; how many sold
and at what figures ; also the earnings of
tho road, and the receipts and disburse
ments; and we ask that this report be
made so that the stockholders may have
such information before the coming an
nual meeting to bo held in Springfield,
January 8, 1S79.
Resolved, That we hereby request that
a separate statement be made of the con
dition, receipts, expenditures and indebt
edness or the road during tho year W.
N. Whiteley was President, and the years
James Emmitt was President.
Resolved, That we have entire CONFI
DENCE IN THE IKKSEXT MANAGEMENT OI TUB
Road, and only r.sk for this statement for
our information and satisfaction.
"Resolved, That it is the sense of this
meeting that the stockholders of Waver
ly, Bainbridge, and such other points as
the amount of stock and the interests of
the road require, should have a member
of the Board of Directors at the ensuing
election."
Dr. I. T. Monahan moved to strike out
inai part 01 tne substitute, expressing
confidence in the present management of
the road, and demanding a rising vote.
James Erumitt, I. T. Monahan, Moses
Sternberger and G. David voted to strike
out, and all the others present, repre
senting a large majority of the stock
holders of Jackson county, voted against
