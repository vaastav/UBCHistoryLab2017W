laden with cargoes of probably still
greater value What Is mre important

Bureau of Animal Inilwntry
The appropriation to the animal bu
reau was S5QfiOG and the expenditures
for the year were only 540542924 thus
jfesrinc unexpended S35475056 The in
gpection of beef animals for export and
Interstate trade has been continued
and 12944056 head were Inspected dur
ing the year at a cost of 1 cents per
head against 4i cents for 1893 The
amount OJ poU microsooplvauy exam
ined was 35437937 pounds against 20
677410 pounds in tHe preceding year
The cost of this inspection has been
diminished from 6 cent per head In
1S93 to 6 Â½ cents in 1894 The expense of
Inspecting the pork sold in 1894 to Ger
many and France by the United States
was JSS92210 The quantity inspected
was greater by 15000000 pounds than
during the preceding year when the
cost of such Inspection was 172307058
The secretary of agriculture recom
nv rs that the law Iroviding for the
microscopic inspection of export and
inti rotate meat be so amended as to
compel owners of the meat inspected
to pay the cost of such inspection and
I call attention to the arguments prl
rented in his report In support of this
recommendation
The live beef cattle exported and
tagged during the year numbered 362
623 This is an increase of 69533 head
over the previous year The sanitary
in < pection of cattle shipped to Europe
has cost an average of 10i cents for
each animal and the cost of inspecting
sjuthern cattle and the disinfection of
cars and stockyards average 27 cents
per animal The scientific inquiries of
the bureau of animal Industry have
rmgressed steadily during the year
Mu > h tuberculin and malleln have been
furnished to state authorities for use
In the agricultural colleges and cxper
iment stations for the
l 1mlnt statons treatment of
tuberculosis and glanders And recent
Iv this department has published its
inwtlgatlons of bovine tubercolosis
r1 Its researches will be vigorously
ninued Certain herds in the Dis
trjt of Columbia will be thoroughly In
spe tfd and will probably supply ade
quate scope for the department to In
telligently prosecute its scientific work
and furnish
sufficient material for
sufcIent pur
poses of illustration description and
derpton nnl
definition The sterilization of milk
suspected of containing the baccilli of
tubercolosis has
been during the year
very thoroughly explained in a leaflet
by Dr D E Salmon the chief of the
bureau and given general circulation
nroughout the country circulaton
The oflice of experiment station
which is a part of the United States
Unied
department of agriculture has during
the past year engaged itself
I p er enggd Itelf almost
wholly in preparing for publication
V works based upon the reprt pub1rton ag
mcultural
rculurl experiment stations and the
1e
Institutions for agricultural inquiry
in the United States and foreign couri
ties The Secretary in his report cu for
3S93 called attention to the fact that
the appropriations made for the sup
port of the experiment stations through
out the Union r the only moneys
taken out of the national treasury toy
an act of Congress forwhich no account
jn to federal authorities was required acoun
Jsponding to this suggestion the
thlr Congress In making its ap
11 ation for the department for the
jesent fiscal year provided that the
f f retary of agriculture shall prescribe
precrbe
1 t1lL form of annual financial statement
required by section 9 of said act of
March 7 18b7 and shall ascertain
whether the expenditures under the
hchlr epndltur ap
propriation hereby made are in accord
ant with the provisions of said act
and shall make a report thereon to I
on S The best source of the stat
istician of the department of
teortment agricul
ture is the ascertainment by dligence
and Ie of the actual and real condi
tions fivorable or unfavorable of the
farmers anti farms of the country and to
f1 causes which produce the condi
tions to the end that the facts ascer
tained may guide their Intelligent
treatment In obedience to this law
the department of agriculture Immediately
lately sent out blank forms of expense
t > ivn > nts to each station and proposes
in addition to make through trusted
exports systematic examination of the
several stations during the year for
the purpose of acquinin by personal
investigation the detailed information
reneigton I enable the secretary of
agriculture to make as the statute
i provides a satisfactory report to Con
i gross The boards of management of
> J the several stations with great alacrity
and cordiality have approved the
amendment to the law providing for
the supervision of their expenditures
anticipating that it will Increase the
pfTlenoy of the stations and protect
their directors and managers from
Irxve charges concerning their use of
public funds besides bringing the de
partment of agriculture Into closer
and more confidential relations with
the experimental stations and rough
their work and service largely Increas
ing their usefulness to the agriculture
of the country
K To Investigate Food
r Acting upon a recommendation con
tained in the report of 1893 Congress
appropriated 110000 to enable the sec
retary of agriculture to investigate and
af pairt upon the nutritive value of var
ious articles and commodities used for
human food with special Sg eton of
full wholesome and edible rations less
wasteful and more economical than
those In common use Under this ap
propriation the department has prepared
pared and now has nearly ready for
dlstri Ion an elementary discussIon
of the nutritive value and pecuniary
economy of food When wo consider
that fully onehalf of all the money
earned by the wageearners of the clv
lized world is expended by them for
food the importance and utility of such
an investigation is apparent
The department expended In the fis
cal year of 1892 2354S095G and out
of that sum the total amount expended
In scientific research was 4G per cent
But In the ear ending June SO 1S94
cut of I total expenditure of S194S
SSS3S the department applied 51S percent
cent of that sum to scientific work
N and investigation I IF therefore very
A plainly observable that the economics
j which have been practiced in the ad
X ministration of the department have
rot each been at the expense of scientific
The recommendation contained inthe
report of the secretary of 1S93 that the
vlnouB system of promiscuous free dis
tribution of its departmental docu
ments be abandoned Is again urged
Thee publications may well ba fur
nished without cost t public libraries
educational institutions and the officers
and libraries of s te and of the fed
Otli government but from all individ
t
itas 1 applying fo them a price cover
Ing the cost of the document asked for
should te required Thus the publica
tions and documents would be secured
by those who really desire them for
proper purposes Half a million of
copies of the report of the secretary of
agriculture are printed for attribution
ngcltT tjbuton
at an annual cost of about 300000
Icrge numbers of them are cumbdring
store rooms at the capitol and the
shelves of the secondhand bookstores
throughout the country Al this labor
and waste might toe avoided if the
recommendations < rt the secretary were
adopted
Free Distribution of Seeds
77 The secretary also again recommends
that the gratuitous ulsirSbutlon of
seeds cease and that no money b ap
propriated for that purpose except to
experiment stations He reiterates the
asons given to Ws report for 1893 for
on
r
discontinuing this unjustifiable grat
I i utty and I fully concur in the compulsions

sions which he ha
I A further important utility in agricultural
cultural statistics is found in the elu
cidation of the relation of the supply
of farm products to the demand for
them In the markets of the United
States and of < the world I is deemed
possible that an agricultural census
may be taken each year through the
agents of the statistical division of the
deJ3let Such a course 1s com
mended for trial by the chief of that

the quantity cotton and tobacco re
maining in the hands of planters either

time The cost of the work is esti
mated at 5500000
tnnlificntioiit oC Statisticians
Owing to the peculiar quality of the
tatisticinns work and the natural and
acquired fitness necessary to its suc
cefjtful prosecution the secretary of ag
riculture expresses the opinion that
every person emplovd In gathering
eveI
statistics under the chief of that division
sttstcs
sion should be admitted to that service
only after a thorough exhaustive and
successful examination at the hands of
the United States civil service commis
sion This has led him to call for such
examination of candidates for the po I
sition of assistant statisticians and also I
of candidates for chiefs for sections in
that division I
The we I done by the department of
agriculture is very superciivusly dealt I
with in this communication and I com
mend the report of the secretary and
the important Intel ests with which it
d als to the careful attention of the
CongressChI1
Chon Service Reform
The advantages to the public service
by an adherence to the principles of the
civil service reform are constantly I
more apparent and nothing Is so en
couraging to those in official life who I
honestly desire good government as I
the increasing appreciation by our peo I
ple of these advantages A vast ma
jority of the voters of the land are
ready to insist that the time and at i
tention of those they select to per I
form for them important public duties i
should not be distracted by dealing out
minor offices and they are growing to i
be unanimous in regarding party or I
ganizations as something that should i I I
be used in establishing party principles j i I
instead of dictating the distribution of j i I
public places as the reward of partisan I
activity Numerous additional offices t
and places have lately been brought
within the civil service rules and regu
lations and somj others will probably I I
soon be included The report of the j i
commissioners will be submitted to the
i I I
Congress and I invite careful atten
tion to the recommendations it conj I i I
tains I
tainsA National llonr of Stealth
I am entirely convinced that we ought I
I not to be longer without a national
board of health or national health of I I
fleer charged with no other duties
than such as pertain to the protection
of our country from the invasion of
pestilence and disease This would In I
volve the establishment by such board

I counsel to local authorities on the suhI

to secure their enforcement There i
seems to be at this time a decided incli
nation to discuss measures of protec

adopting means of mutual assistance I
I The creation of such a national health
establishment would greatly aid
establshment geat our
I standing in such conferences and im

commend the inauguration of a nation i

instrumentality believing the same to I
be a needed precaution against con
tagious diseases and in the interest of
the safety and health of our people
The Labor Commission
By virtue of a statute of the United
States passed in 1S33 I appointed in
I July last Hon John D Korean of the I
I state of New York and Hon Nicholas
R Worthington of the state of Illinois
to form with Hon Carroll D Wright
I
commissionerer of labor who was des I
ignated by said statute a commission I
for the purpose of making careful in
I quiry into the causes of the contro
versies between Certain railroads and
their empoyees which had resulted in
an extensive and destructive strike ac
companied by much violence and dan
gerous disturbances with considerable I
loss of life and great destruction of
property The report of the commis
sioners has been submitted to me and
will be transmitted to the Congress
with the evidence taken upon their in
vestigation Their work has been well
wel
done and their standing and intelli
gence give assurance that the report
and suggestions they make are worthy
of careful consideration
The Tariff Act
c
The tariff act passed at the last ses
sion of the Congress needs important
amendments if i is to be executed ef
fectively and with certainly In addi
tion to a jqh necessary amendments as
will not change rat of duty I
am still very decidedly in favor of
putting on and iron upon the free
list So far as the sugar schedule is
concerned I would be glad under exist
ing aggravations to see every particle
of dIfferential duty in favor of refined
sugar stricken out of
susr < our tariff law
If with all the favor now accorded the
sugar refining interest in our tariff
laws It still languishes to the extent
of closing refineries and thousands of
discharged workmen it would seem to
present a hopeless case for reasonable
legislative aid Whatever < is done
or omitted I earnestly repeat here my
recommendation I have made in an
other portion of this communication
ommuncaton
that the additional duty of onetenth
of a cent per pound laid upon sugar
imported from countries paying suga a
bounty on its export be abrogated I
seems to me that exceedingly Import
ant considerations point to the pro
priety of this amendment
American Itcxltitry of ForeifmDulU
Ships
With the advent of a new tariff pol
icy not only calculated to relieve the
consumers of our land in the cost of
their daily life but invite a better de
velopment of American thrift and
create for us closer and more profitable
commercial relations with the rest of
the world It follows as a logical and
a1
imperative necessity that we should at
once remove the chief if not the only
obstacle which has so long prevented
our participation in the foreign carry
ins trade of the age A tariff built up
on the theory that It is well to check
imports nd that a horn e market
should bound the Industry and effort
of American produces was fitly sup
plemented b a refusal to allow Ameri
can registry to vessels built abroad
though owned and navigated by our
people thus exhibiting a willingness to
abandon all contest for the advantages
of American transcontinental I
Aericn tsontnentl car
riage Ournext tariff policy built
tarlf p1cy up
on the theory that It is well to en
courage such Importations as our peo
ple need and that our product and
manufactures should find markets in
every part of the labltable Kldbfc is i
consistently supplemented by the
>
greatest possible Jiberty t our citi
zens in the ownership aad navigation
of ships in whlcli ur products and
manufactures may be transported The
millions now paid to foreigners for
carrying American passengers and pro
ducts across the sea should tife turned
into American hands Shipbuilding
which has been protected to strangula
tion should be revived by the prospect
of profitable employment for ships
when built and the American sailor
should be resurrected and agul take
his place a sturdy and industrious citizen
izen in time of peace and a patriotic
and safe defender of American inter
ests in the day of conflict The ancient
provision of our law denying Ameri
can registry to ships built abroad and
owned by Americans appears in the
light of present conditions not only to
be a failure for good at every point
but to be nearer a relic of barbarism
than anything that exists under the
permission of a statute of the United
States I earnestly recommend Its
prompt repeal
Tlc TJonO Issuc
During the last month the gold re
serve in the treasury for the purpose
I of redeeming the notes of the govern
ment circulation as money in the hands
lof the people became so reduced and
its further depletion in the near fu
ture seemed so certain that in the ex
ercise of proper care for the public
welfare i became necessary to replen
ish the reserve and thus maintain pop
pp
ular faith in the ability and determina
tion of the government to meet as
agreed its pecuniary obligations I
would have been well If in this emer
gency the authority had existed to is
sue the bonds of the government bear
ing a low rate of interest and not
maturing within a short period But
the Congress having failed to confer
such authority resort was necessarily
had to the resumption act of 1875
and pursuant to its provisions bonds
were issued drawing interest at the
rate of 5 per cent per annum and ma
turing ten years after their issue that
being the shortest time authorised by
the act I am glad to say however
that on the sale of these bonds the
premium received operated to reduce
II the rate of interest to be paid by the
government to less than 3 per cent
I Nothing could be worse or further
removed from sensible finance than
the relations existing between the
currency the government has issued
the gold held for its radempSon and
the means which must be resorted to
for the purpose of replenishing such
redemption fund len Impaired
Even if the claims upon this fund were
confined to the obligations originally
intended and if the redemption of
I those obligations meant their cancel
lation the fund would be very sal
But t ese obligations when received
and redeemed in gold are not can I
celled but are reissued and may do
duty many times by way of drawing
gold from the treasury Thus we have
an endless chain in operation con
stantly depleting the treasurys gold
ani never nearing a final ret As if
this was not bad enough we have by
I a statutory declaration that it is the
policy of the government to maintain
live parity between gold an silver
I aided the force and momentum of this
exhausting process and ado large
ly to the currency obligations claim i
ing this peculiar gold redemption
i Our small gold reserve is thus sub
ject to drain from every side the de
I mans that increase cur danger also
Increase the necessity of protecting
this reserve against depletion and it
is most unsatisfactory to know ta
I the protection afforded is only a tem i
porary palliation It is perfectly and
palpably plain that the only way un
del present conditions by which this i
reserve when dangerously depleted J
jean be replenished is through the issue I
and sale of the bonds of the govern I
meat for gold and yet Congress ha I
not only thus far declined to author
ize t2ie issue of the bonds best suited
to such a purpose but there seems n
disposition in some qifcarters to deny
both the necessity and power for the
issue of bonds at all I cannot for a
moment believe that any of our citi
zen are deliberately willing that
their government should default in its
pecuniary obligations or that its finan
cial operations should be reduced t
a silver basis At any rt ru should
not feel that my duty was done if I
omitted any effort I could make to
avert such a calamity As long there
fore as no provision is made for Ihe
final redemption or the putting aside
of the currency Oblgtons now used I
to repeatedly and conStant draw
from the government its gold and as I
long a no batter authority for bond
issues is allowed than at present ex I
ist such authority will be utilized
whenever and as often as it becomes
necessary to maintain a sufficient gold
reserve and abundant time to serve
the credit of our country and make
good the financial declarations of
fnancal delartons ot our
government S
Cloaks and Currency
Questions relating < to our banks and
currency are closely connected With
the subject just referred to and they
also present some unsatisfactory fea
tures Prominent among them are the
lack of elasticity in our currency cir
culation and its frequent con ntr
tion in financial centers when it is
most needed in other pat of the
country The absolute divorcement of
the government from the business of
banking is the ideal relationship of
the government to the circulation of
the currency of the country This
condition cunnot be immediately
reached but as a step in that direction
nail as as means of securing a more
elastic currency and obviating other
objections to the present arrangement
of bank circulation the secretary of
the treasury presents in his report a
scheme rectifying the present banking
laws and providing for the issue of
circulating notes by state banks free
from taxation under certain limita
tions The secretary explains his
plan so plainly and its advantages a
developed oy him with such remark
able clearness that any effort on any
part ito present argument in its support
port would be superfluous I shall
therefore content myself with an un
qualified indorsement of the Sere
tarys proposed changes in the law and
a brief and Imperfect statement of
their prominent features
CziillsJes Currency Finn
It is proposed to repel all laws pro
viding for the deposit of Unred States
bonds as security fo cbu ton to
permit national banks to issue circu
lating note not exceeding in amount 75
per cent of their paid up and unim
paired capital provided they deposit
with the government as a guarantee
fund in United States iegal tender
notes including treasury notes of 1890
a sum of equal amount to CO per cent
of the notes they desire to issue this
deposit to be maintained at all l times
but whenever any bank retires any
part of its circulation a proportionate
part of its guarantee fund shall be re
turned to i to permit the secretary of
the treasury to prepare and keep on
hand ready for issue in case a in
crease in circulation is desired I blank
national bank notes for each bank
having a circulation and to repeal the
provisions of the present law Imposing
limitations and restrictions upon banks
desiring to reduce 01 increase their
circulation thus permitting such increase
crease o reduction within the limit of
the 75 per cent of capital to be quickly
made as emergencies arise In addi
tion to the guarantee und required It
is proposed to provide a safety fund
for the immediate redemption of the
circulating notes of failed banks by
imposing a small annual tax say onl
half of 1 per cent upon the average
circulation of each bank until the fund
amount t C per cent of the total cir
culation outstanding When a bank
fails its guarantee fund 1 to be paid
into this safety fund and its notes are
to be redeemed in the first instance
from snesafety Cund thus augument
eJ any impairment of such fund
caused thereby to be made good from
the immediately avaHabl cash assets
of said bank and if these should be In
sufficient such impairment to JIB made

the expenses of Â° printing notes

other like charges there shall bo

provided that there shall be no national
bank notes issued of less denomination

cept in case of a failed bank shall re
deem or retire its notes hi the first
Instance at Its own office a t agencies
to be designated by it and no fixed re
serve may be maintained account of
deposits Another very important fea
ture of this plan is the exemption of
state banks from taxation by the
I United States in cases where it is shown
to satisfaction of the secretary of
the treasury and comptroller of the
currency by banks claiming such ex
emption that they have not had out
standing their circulating notes exceed
ing 75 per cent of their paid up and
unimpaired capital that their stock
holders are individually liable for the
redemption of their circulating note to
the full extent of their ownership of
stock that the liability of banks upon
their circulating notes constitutes under
their state law a first lien upon their
assets that such banks have kept and
maintained a guarantee fund in United
States legal tender notes Including
treasury notes of 1S90 equal to 30 per
cent of their outstanding circulating
notes and such banks have promptly
redeemed their circulating notes when
presented at their principal or branch
offices It is quite likely that this
schemq may be usefully amended in
some of its details but I am satisfied It
furnishes a basis for very great Im
provement in our present banking and
currency system t
I conclude this communication fully
appreciating that the responsibility for
all legislation affecting the people of
the United States rests upon their
representatives in the Congress and as
suring them that whether in accordance
with the recommendations I have made
or not I shall be glad to cooperate in

Chicago Dec 3Dhe Herald Dem
will say The annual message of
Cleveland is very much In earnest
throughout and those portions which
express his personal views on Public
pollcyahdr The principles of the gov
ernment have his usual force and di
rectnss On the whole It Is a sails
fatory document Which clears up the
situation amazinely which will excite
but little hostile criticism and which
is a creditable American state paper
Chicago TJnics
The Times will say Undaunted by
what the Republican organs are
pleased to call tire verdict against
free trade Mr Cleveland demands
free coal free iron ere and free > ships
He even suggests tttsat if revenue
considtfrations would permit lie
would be glad under existing
aggravations to see every particle
of differential duty strielcwi out of our
tariff Jaw an expression which a vast
body of the people of the United States
victims of the trusts festered by these
duties will heartily echo
Chicago Tribune
I Tie Tribune will say With the ex
ception of the brief tariff statement
ard the Somewhat longer financial
statement the message is purely cleri
cal and reflects the routine work of the
departments Summed up it is a long
business message without partisan ex
altaijion on the one hand or useless I
mourning over recent catastrophes on
the other and with evident suggestions
of gout

Cleveland 0 Dec 3The Plaindeal
eri The present president is nothing
if npt tenacious in his opinions He
still clings to the theory tSiat coal and i
ironi should be placed on the free list
but he gives no reason for it The
president rightfully endorses the re
organization of the Pacific railway
companies so as to take it out of the

The message as a whole is a dlsap

slightest ecogntlon of the causes of

with which the message concludes

Ihzas City Dec < 3The Journal
Rep1 says the presidents message is
a document which will attract atten
tion only because of Its length and not
because of the handling of subjects in
which the American people are intense
ly interested
Like all his official acts during the
present term the document Is a dis
appointment to the people and must
be a humiliation to his remaining ad
herents

I
Kui tnt City rimes
The Times Den The striking
feature of President Clevelands an
nual message is Its lucidity and com
prejiensiveness The surprising feature
of the document is the absence of
any recommendations that would in
vite contention The message is writ
ten in the vigorous style and rugged
periods which mark all the state papers
of Mr Cleveland It is likely to make
a profound impression on Congress and
the country and may stimulate such a
measure of energy on the part of the
senators and representatives during
the short session as will secure some
of the Important reforms recom
mended

The Courier wocriinl
Louisville Ky Dec 3The Courier
Journal The presidents annual mes
sage committed to Congress yester
day is unusually long and is almost
as uninteresting as it is long Aside
from the indorsement and synopsis of
Secretary Carlisles plan for currency
reform with one or two other recom
mendations the mesrage has but little
other significance than attaches to a
clocklike condensation of the various
departmental reports In this respect
It is very different from some of the
preceding messages of Mr Cleveland

Thc president in his message fav
ors rhe abolition of every particle of
differential duty in favor of refined >
sugar and the abolition of the re
taliatory duty on refined Imported
from countries that pay export boun
ties If he had taken hIs stand at
the close of the last session instead
of permuting Mr Carlisle to identify
the administration with the Sugar
Trust some things might have turned
I out differently It is to be regretted
that the president could not Ciavo
found room in his brief statement to
say something about our policy to
ward the Nicaragua canal There is
little to say about the message as a
Whole because it is not a whole but
an aggregation of unrelated parts It
makes some good recommendations
but as a whole It is noncommittal to
a degree < that might suggest timidity if
a more pnJbible explanation were not

Sau Francisco Chronicle
I
San Francisco Dec 3 The
Chronicle will say editorially
I Perhaps the most remarkable fea
ture of the message is the manner in
which the president disposes of the
tariff question He gives it only one
brief paragraph showing none w the
fir which characterized the Catchings I
letter As a tariff reformer ho shows
the dispiriting defeat of November 6
The message takes up the subject of
currency reform with considerable I
earnestness and vigor but everything
the president says is from tone stand
point of the banking interest and
Wall Street demands The president
has not one word to say about the
question of silver coinage He shows
however by his silence and by this full
endorsement of the Wall street scheme
that he Is hand in glove with the gold
monometallists as ire always has been
The message foils to discuss the mont

Villnsc
Athens Dec 3 Copyrighted 1894
by the Associated PreseThe Asso
ciated Press exclusively has been able
to give to the world the facts of the
terrible atrocities perpetrated upon
Armenian Christians in Asia Minor
and today a representative of the As
sociated Press succeeded jn securing
additional information confirming the
previous statements made The repre
sentative today met twenty Armenian
refugees who arrived here from Ar
menia after tu journey full of hard
ships and suffering Securing the ser
vice of a firstclass interpreter he
gathered the Armenians together at a
convenient place and having relieved
their pressing necessities the inter
preter questioned the refugees con
cerning the terrible events of which
they had in a number of cages been
eye witnesses This party of Armen
ians is the first that has escaped from
th districts where the massacres oc
curred and it is believed > that even the
worst remains to be told as the hor
rors described are understood to have
lasted for a long time after this party
left Most of the persons who told
their stories today escaped from
Moosh Bitlla and Sassoun taking with
them what little they could carry and
making their way with the greatest
difficulty to the RussoTurkish fron
tier and1 going to Erivan and JBtch
mladzin
Brutality to Women
Several Armenian women escipcd in
the villages with this party but when
near Brzeroura they died from the ef
fects of sabre wounds inflicted upon
them before heir escape For about
eighteen mouths the Armenians say
the province or Sassoun has been snr
reunited by Turkish troops and nobody
has been allowed tS enter it or leave
About four months ago the Turkish
authorities learned that the inhabitants
of Vartemis a village outside the fron
tier of Sascoun were sending for the
necessaries of life to tins village of
3alvorig Such communication be
ween the two villages being prohibited
the Turks massacred nearJy all the
Inhabitants of Vartemis This was the
second massacre to occur The first
took place about a year ago
One of the refugees a man flamed
Khodjlk states that Ms uncle asd
aunt were both killed the hitter beW
violated previous to being put ito death
An Armenian priest named Kevont
was killed for refusing to celebrate
Turkish rites in his church at Varte
iiiis The village contained 323 Ar
menian houses before the Turks at
tacked it but when the fugitives left
only twenrtjfive houses regained
standing Dalvortg It appears fe the
largest village In the province Jf Sas
soon and its inhabitants whefa they
learned of the horrors perpetrAted by
the Turks at Varteasls attacked the
Turks on the frontier The Turkish
commander eventually sera tweve
soldiers into Dalvorig to learn what
had occurred The Armenian filled
with indignation nt the atrocities com
mitted by the Turks at Vartemis at
tacked this detachment of Turkish sol
diers anl put them all to death
Ills niootly Vtnseanoe
When the Turkish commander
heard of the death of his soldiers he
determined on a vengeance in the
most bloody manner possible A
strong force of Turkish troops was
sent to the village with artillery and
the massacre began Guns kept up a
continuous fire upon Dalvorig until
practically not one stone was lft
standing upon another I
Solo the Bey of Inltzoun a Kurd
with a detachment of Kurdish cavalry
went with thd Turkish soldiers to the
village of Semal and forcibly took the
Armenian priest from his church at
tar disgustingly defiling the sacred ves
sels and the priests hands Then they
bound him on a donkey which they
drove a distance of a few yards The
soldiers then fired at the priest and
killed him and the beast he was bound
to In the same village the soldiers en
tered an Armenian house and violated
a woman and her daughter the latter
being 14 years of age From this vil
lage Sale forcibly took eight Armenian
girls and sent them to his harem at
Initzoun
Further atrocities were committed
by the Turks at the village of Hello
huesen Before dawn its place was
surrounded by soldiers and while the
inhabitants were still asleep it was set
on fire The brutal soldiers entered
the residence of a man named Arakel
who was asleep with hio wife and
tortured them both internally in a ter
rible manner with red hot irons
Unrucd to bestir
At Keliehusen the soldiers killed the
Armenian priest Margos with twenty
other inmates of a house Thy were
burned to death the soldiers prevent
ing anybody from escaping from the
burning dwelling The chief of the
village of Cheneg was captured by tim
soldiers and bound to his two daught
ers All three were then scalded to
death with boiling water
A detachment of twentyfive regul
ars of the Turkish cavalry after com
mitting inexpressible horrors at the
village of Sebghank went TO the vil
lage school and ravlslied the girls
found there The cavalrymen then
devastated the building
Ibo Boy the notorious Kurd brig
antI of the village of Jjibran and > a
colonel in the regular army went with
a detachment of Turkish troops to
tire Armenian villages of Bahlou
Hatezgant and Honk and each place
commttted every crime there is to
commit
After driving out the men they col
lected the female children of Bahlou
together about 200 in all and after
ravishing them they kilted them all
with guns and swords After this
massacre the Turkish soldiers regalefl
themselves with wine and whatever
else they could find in the village
The Kurdish regular troop from
Klzan and Bahran entered the Ar
menian villages of Allanozlpr anti
Aghleg killed the inhabitants and
wrecked their houses The number ot
villages devastated in this manner is
said to be over thirtytwo
The Armenians fled in every direc
tion but many of them wore captured
by the Turkish troops before they
could get away and were taken to
prison
Kfcadjlk who was the principal
spokesman of the Armenian refugees
told the whole story in a most con
vincing manner
Letter Ironi Armenia 3
Dr G Thoumain a wellknown Ar
menian has just received a letter writ
ten on Seplemb r3 ftretn Toaorian a
village near SrserwttHt The writer
saysHow f
How can Iiwte such horrors of our
life for the days since the lUv Mount

Armenian inhabitants Over 200 shots
were fired at the house of the Rev
Mr Zookis pastor oC the Protestant
community who was absent In Erse
mourn Three balls struck the pastora
wife in the lace She subsequently died
from the results of her wounds
Some poor people from Khoos who
were living Jn the basement of the pas
tors house hurried up stairs when the
firing was going on and all of them
were wounded Mr Richardson an
American missionary came from Erse

robbers committed murder at Andas
and carried off cattle At Body they
broke into houses and plundered them
of their contents
Dr Thoumain was formerly a pro
Lessor at the Armenian college at Mar
sovan and has himself been the victim
of cruel persecution at the hands ot
the Turks in 1S93 when serious dis
turbances occurred in various parts of
Armenia and scores of Innocent Chris
tians were thrown Into prison and the
Christian college burned
On representations made to the Turk
ish government by the department of
