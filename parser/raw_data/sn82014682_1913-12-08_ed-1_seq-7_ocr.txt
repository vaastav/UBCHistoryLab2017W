can be handled promptly and without
serious controversy 'of any kind. 1

nees for the presidency: of the United

not-misinterpret thv wishes or the
expectations of the "country when 1
urge, the prompt enactment of legis '
la tlon, which will provide for primary
elections throughout .the '.country at
woica toe roiers oi uie several "parties
may choose their nominees for the
presidency without the Intervention
of nominating conventions. I venture
the suggestion that this legislation
should provide for the retention of
party -conventions, but only ?f or the
purpose of declaring and accepting the
verdict of the primaries and formulat
ing the. platforms of the parties; and
suggest ' that these t vcoa ventlons
should consist not of delegates chosen
for this single purpose. , but - of the
nominees for Congress, the nominees
for vacant seats in the senate of the
United States, the . senators whose
terms bave not yet closed, the . na
