Special to Tin : HKI : . I The sllonco which
the French bishops bavo maintained since
tno question of the soparntlon of church und
state In Franco was raised has caused much
omn/omont In political circles , and greatly
dlsror.certod the radicals. H was ex
pected that ' the recent prosecu
tion of the nrchbisnop of Alx would
have lea the clergy to take some rash and
foolish step , but they seem to have discounted
nvonts nnd nro acting with remarkable cool
ness. This Is of course largely due to the
circular which the pope has addressed to the
French prelates , enjoining them to refrain
from comment on the action of the govern
ment und censuring antl-mlalsterlal utter
ances.
In this letter Leo XIII has given ono moro
proof of his deep political sagacity nnd shown
his fidelity to the traditions of the Catholic
church , which has always loved to be on the
side of the strongest.
The members of the triple alllatico have
been considerably surprised by the firmness
of the position adopted by the Vatican. It
was supposed that the pope would have
take up an attitude distinctly hostile to
France.

France that a journalist named Chadonlno.
wlio was recently expelled froi'i iho

French ctinri-'O d'affalrs , M. Lanot , in a note
to the Bulgarian government , protested
against the expulsion of the journalist ns a
flagrant ami premeditated violation of the
treaties existing between Franco and
Bulgaria. In reply the Bulgarian
government sent n note saying
that Chadonlno had bcon systematically
sending the French press lyiug nnd caluiu-
Inous stories about Bulgaria , and that the
Bulgarian government was unable to rescind
the order of expulsion , but hoped that the
incident would not disturb the good relations
existing between Bulgaria and Franco. The
French CDVornment then ordered M. Lutiot
1o sever diplomatic relations with Bulgaria.

President Harrison is about to take a most
important stop in the commercial dealings of
this country with others and the first public
announcement of the stop will bo made in
this dispatch , It is nothing short of a proc
lamation being prepared , practically placing
nn embargo against all coutitrlcM which have
not made reciprocity treaties with the tfiiltcd
States under the provisions of the Melvinloy
act. The proclamation will bo issued on
January 1 next. It will attach retaliatory
duties upon sugar , molasses , coffee and ton
imported by these countries which bavo
failed to take advantage of the reciprocity
clause of the act.
This proclamatioa will hoof moro import
ance in its commercial effect than iho nego
tlatton of n dozen treaties for It affects many
countries and practically closes our customs
houses against the chief articles of export of
several nations. The reciprocity section
which empowers the president to maUo this
proclamation Is as follows :
With n view to securing reciprocal trade
with countries producing the following
articles , anil forthls purpose , on and after the
1st day of January , IS'JJ , whenever and so
often as the president shall bo satisfied that
the government of any country producing
and cxpottluL' sugars molasses.colTco , tea and
hides , raw and unciircd , or any of such arti
cles , Imposes duties or other exactions upm
Iho agricultural or other products of the
United Slates which , In view of the free Intro
duction of sugar , molasses , eolTee , tea and
hides Into the United States , bo may deem to
bo reciprocally unequal and unreasonable , ho
shall have the power and It shall bo
his duty to suspend by proclamation ,
to that ell'oct , the provisions of this act
relating to the free Introduction of sugar ,
mohikbcs , tea and hides , the production of
snub country , for such tlmo as ho shall deem
just , and In such case and during such sus
pension , duties shall bo levied and collected
nnd paid upon sugar , molasses. cofTcc , tea and
hides , the product of or exported from sucb
designated country as follows.
Thu act then specifies the discriminatory
cititles which may bo Imposed. These are
seven-tenths of 1 eent per pound on sugars
not above No. 1 ! ! , Dutch standard , nnd ! ?
cents per pound on sugars above No. Ill ,
Dutch standard- colTco the discriminatory
duty Is I ! cents per pound , on tea 10 cents per
pound and on all kinds ol hides I5i cents per
pound.
KfTcct of the Proclamation.
The proclamation will bi mainly Important
in its cfl'ect on the grodi tea Imports of China
and Japan , the enormous hide products of
the Argentine Republic ana the sugar and
coffee products of Uruguay , Paraguay and
several minor southern countries. China
and Japan might have secured u remission of
this 10 cents per pound on tea , but they have
failed to take nduantago of the reciprocity
clause nnd the proclamation will bo
specially desired against them. The
Argentine Hopublio Is the great im
porter of hides to this country.
The average value of importations is seldom
short of $1.000,000. O her countries which will
suffer by-the proclamation nroTIiiyti ond'tho
Hawaiian islands , witn their great sugar
products , and the Danish , Dutch and French
colonies to the south of this coun
try. The proclamation will nlso bo
Important in securing to the countries which
have embraced reciprocity the full advantage
of the United States markets in sugar , tea ,
coffee and hides.
The countries which have thus faracceptod
reciprocity or are now negotiating treaties to
that end are : Brazil , San Domingo , Costa
Hica , British Columbia , Porto Hlco , British
Guinea. Citiatoma'a , Colombia , British Hon
duras , Venezuela , Kcuador , Peru , Mexico ,
British West Indies und Nicaragua. Aside
from iho commercial Importance of this proc
lamation , it will peculiarly bo adopted
as offsetting the recent criticism di
rected at the president's message because
it wholly failed to mention reciprocity. This
has been widely construed as an effort on the
nart of Mr. Harrison to ignore Secretary
Blaino's reciprocity plan. It appears , how
ever , that the president fullv agrees with
Mr. Blaiuo on the Importance of n reciprocity
program , so much so that ho desired to treat
It specially in ttio proclamation of January 1
rather than cover it up In a general mossago.
Appointments Will lie Alado Soonr
President Harrison will bo enabled to send
in his nominations after tomorrow morning
unless the senate strikes a sung in con firm
ing tlio rearrangement of committees. Tlio
reason there has boon nd new nominations
sent to tno Donate during the present session
is thai thu committees have cot been organ
ized. Several of them , notably the commit
tee on judiciary , which have no head are to
receive the greatest number of nominations.
There have bcon n lot of nominations duvlng
the recess of congress sent to the senate , but
they do not require immediate action ,
for the ofllcers are all discharging
their duties. An ofllcor nominated while the
Rcnuto is in session must wait until hU nomi
nation is confirmed before ho can have his
commission or ho can't take his place.
This morning In caucus the republican sen
ators agreed ou the reorganization of all com
mittees , tunning chairmen for a number of
the most important ones , and ns soon as the
democratic senators report the minority mem
bers the rearrangement will bo formally an
nounced und confirmed In iho open senate.
That will bo done among the vor.v first things
attended to tomorrow when the sonata con
venes. A largo number of appointments will
then bo made.-

bo seen there is n slight decrease of imports.
This decrcaso has bson about $1,000,000 in
imports of animals free of duty , and about
? 0,000,000 In manufactures of cotton , and
S'J,000OUO in manufactures of flax , hemp and
jute ; also n decrease In the manufactures of

1891. was about $102,000,000 as against
{ 97,000,000 in tha same month of
1S90. During the ton moaths ending with
Octobcrlll , IbOl , the value of our exports
was $ r2'.r)55ri4l ' ) as against $ CfiOS20,0'J ! ) ' for
the corresponding ten months of Ib90. There
Is an increase in our exports since January 1
of tuls year of $09,000,000 in round numbers.
Of these total exports during ten months the
agricultural products were of the value of
M3S,4UM : t'J as compared with M81SS3S5i : fjr
the ton months of last year. The value
of the manufactured products was $111,070-
9.V.3 as against fia3-i03,7Ul ( for the ton months
of last year.
It will bo observed there has boon nn in
crease of over $47,000,000 In agricultural
products , and over $11,000,000 In the exports
"
of manufactured products , It shows a "very
gratifying condition In our foreign trade.
During the ton inortlhs mentioned the ex
cess of our exports over our imports , or bal
ance of trade in our favor , was $ Ui,570S50. !
The Increase in oup exports has been In
hrcadstulfs over S'3J,000,000 , in cotton about
$20,000.000 , manufacture * of cotton about
$ . ' 1,000,000 , in manufactures of iron nnd steel
over $3,000,000 , in leather and manufactures
of about $1,500,000.
At the same tlmo there has bcon a decrease
In the exports of mii.cral oils of something
over $4OOD,000 , of $10,000,000 In the exports
of provisions and ? ' .1.VIO,000 in the exports of
wood nnd manufactures. At the snmo tlmo
the condition of our foreign trade in the way
of exports Is very encouraging , ns the Indica
tions now are that the exports during the
month of November will bu largely- bxcoss
of what they wore in October , nnd this largo
excess Is mninlv of agricultural products , all
of which is conducive of good markets and
bettor prices for the farmer.

The name of Senator ICvlo does not appear
upon the list , altiiougli Saiiator Polfer. hi *
Dlllnnro colleague , is glvon four commltteo
nsHlgnments. It is learned that Senator
ICylo was approachcf ( with a view to ascer
taining his preferences , but that hla
response was non-commit tnl and ho vairuoly
hinted that thu nillanco senators .should re-
colvo pommlttcoasslginnonta from both the
republican nnd democratic caucuses. Doubt
has nlso boon cast upon his soundness in re
publican principles , so that up to this tlmo
the republican caucus has boon unable to
piaco nun , aiiiiougn it may do so tomorrow.
An important chance in the committco Is
the elevation of the committco on irrigation
and arid lands from n select to a standing
committco. Senator Wnrron of Wyoming ,
'
although a now senator , has bjcn p'laced at
Its head by reason of his familiarity with
this subject.

Crisp spent the day at the capitol soolng the
members of congress find others and attend
ing to his correspondence , lie has ascer
tained the wishes of a great number of the
members of the houso. The speaker said
this afternoon that ro conclusion had yet
been roachcd as to the coinmlttoos , nor had
any of this chairmanships at his disposal bcou
tendered to any parsons. The character-of
the committco on rule.i has not yet
been decided upon , nnd Iho propo
sition to tnaio It up without
reference to the chairmanship ? of the wavs
nnd moans ami appropriations Is still under
discussion , and there .seems to bo a strong
probability that that plan will prevail , thera
bolnga prejudice among the nvorngo run of
members against placing all tlio powers of
the house In the hands of the chairmen of the
two leading committees.
The greatest trouble will bo to got the
rtaht men to servo on the rules committco.
As un Independent committee this will bo
morodifllcult of oiganlzatlon than any other.
There uro hut two democratic rnoirbars of
this committed besides the speaker , and two
republicans. There may bo a proposition
inado to the house to increase the number by
adding o'io moro member to the majority.

Telegram to Tin : BKK. 1 The committee on

amendment regarding admission to the lloor ,
whieli was drafted by Suuator M indorsou
during the summer recess. It excludes from
tlio privileges 01 the lloor of tlio sonata nil
persons who nro not on the pay rolls of the
secretary of the senate , and restricts clerks ot
committees from admission oxcont upon such
occasions as when they uro devoting themselves -
selves to ouslnoas uonucctod with the com
mittees. This rule WIM romlorod necessary
by thu abuse of the privileges hcrotoforo
grunted to senators. permitting pnvato
secretaries and clerics of committees
to enter the lloorvhon the senate
was In session. Ttio result has been
that day by day the sofas of the senate havu
boon lined with uewspapsr men whose only
connection with senators wai a word to tha
serKcant-at-arins stating that they were
their private secretaries , and who took this
advantage of their associates to seen ro prefer
ence aim opportunity to visit senators and
collect news upon the lloor.
In consequence of this various unnntors
have complained from tlmo to tlmo that
private conversations between themselves
and colleagues appeared in print In the piess
of the country the next day and thov attribute
this publicity to tlio laxity of the senate rules.
After this all newspaper inon who are not

It lias leaked out that n quiet but determined -
mined effort will bo niado this winter by
diplomatic representatives of Germany null
Franco tu secure the repeal of the bounty
upon boot sucar , granted by the last con
gress. Both of these countries , which are
largo exporters of this product , producing
each year more thoti suflleient to supply the
needs of their people , have boon seriously
hurt by the prospect that within a few years
the United States will produce from tho" boot
an amount not only sulllclent for domestio
consumption but sufficient to enter Into com
petition witli them In the markets of the
world. Under the piovlsions of the Me-
Kinloy bill the president has been
able , under the throat of excluding beet
sugar , to secure reciprocal trade relations
with Germany and a partial removal of the
restrictions upon the entrance of our meat
products Into Franco. Tlio object of both of
those notions Is to now use the feeling against
bounties so ns to sectro the withdrawal of
the club which is now over their heads , and It
will not bosurprlsinglf In a very short time a
vigorous and determined attack Is undo by
the democratic congress upon the sugar
bounty clause of the MelCinloy bill.
A senate caucus committed on assignment
of senators to committees reported
tins morning to tlio republican cau

There i not much probability of changes in

"senators interested' hnvo been frequently

and the result as made out lias been drafted
after nearly n week's hard work by the com

There was n vigorous struggle for tlio
vacancy on the commlttoo on appropriations ,
the Pacific coast especially demanding that
one of its senatow should receive recognition
for tlio coast in this respect. Senator
Cullqtn of Illinois , however , demanded ,
on behalf of Chicago and the state
of Illinois , the place formerly occu
pied by his colleague , Sonnlor Fnrwcll.
In this dilemma it was decided to Increase
iho coinmittcu by ono and Senator Stewart of
Nevada was linnlly selected as the Incumbent
on account of his long service In the senate
and because his cholca would roidlly roliuvu
the committee from embarrassment resulting
from the importunities of other western
senators , in exchange , Senator Stewart
agreed to relinquish his position on tlio com
mittee on military nlTntra and make way foe
cx-Stcrotary of'ar Proctor. Senator Pad-
doclc of Nebraska still retains his chairman

pensions , Indian depredation cluims and
contingent uxponscs of the semite , while
ho is L'ivon , in addition , a position on
the committee to provide additional accom
modations for the library. Senator Mandor-
son remains as chairman of the committco
on printing , and member nf the committees on
military affairs , on rules and on Indian
a Hull's.
Senator Dubois , of Idaho , Is inado u mom-
l > or of the committee on Irrigation , immigra
tion , enrolled bills , manufactures and ex
penditures of the executive department of
the sonato. Senator Teller of Colorado ex
changes tlio chairmanship of the committco
on patents for the much more important com
mittee ou privileges and elections. It can bo
said that tlio result of the dotermincd struggle
glo on the part of the western senators
for recognition on the sonata committees
lias been welt mot bv the caucus
committees and that the Fifty-second congress -
gross will see an importance given in tlio
formulation of a resolution to the western
senators which has never buforo been
equaled in the bi.story ot thai body. Sena
tor Warren of Wyoming was given thn chair
manship of the commlltco on Irrigation ,
which has been onlargoO from seven to nine
members ami inado n standing instead of it
special committee. The republican members
of the committco nro Warren of Wyo
ming , Stewart of Nevada , Casey of North
D.ucotn , Sanders ol Montana and Dubols ot
Idaho , all from states most Keenly interested
in irrigation.
It Is expected that the democrats will name
men for the minority from Irrigation states
so that the committco will bo nn active ono
