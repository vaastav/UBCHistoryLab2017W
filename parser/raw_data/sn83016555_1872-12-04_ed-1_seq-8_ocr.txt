Floating Elevators Needed.
W r e copy the following from the St. Louis
Times:
The season for the closing of the upper
Mississippi is fast approaching, and mer
chants—unless this proves an unusually
mild winter—will have to rely mainly upon
railroads for their transportation South, as
well as to the East. The Mississippi, as is
well known, is closed for all practical pur
poses from hero out to Cairo, two to tkreo
months every winter, thus placing an em
bargo upon our Southern trade in grain and
produce, the very season when extra freight
facilities aro most needed.
The grain trade, it maybe said, is espe
cially affected by this annua! blockade, and
froni December i to February 1 all trade in
cereals languishes, and these accumulate
here simply for the want of liberal trans
portation facilities hence to the seaboard.
Now, if floating grain elevators be es
tablished to run between East St. Louis
aud the Iron Mountain railroad, and
at Belmont, from which barges could be
loaded without trouble throughout the
winter, this difficulty would be partially
removed. If also, one of these elevators be
established at Cairo in connection with the
Cairo Short Line, thus enabling that road
to ship bulk grain from here through to
New Orleans by connection with boats at
Cairo, another difficulty would be over
come. The Iron Mountain and Cairo Short
Line should also increase their number of
bulk gfaiu cars, and with these facilities a
heavy grain trade might be done through
this channel, not only with New Orleans,
but with the leading Eastern and European
markets.
Would it not be well for the proprietors
ol our elevators to look into this matter f
We are told bv knowing ones that tioatirig
elevators could lie built at a moderate cost,
say $10,000, and in a very short time. But
if they are not willing to make this outlay,
there "is but little doubt that arrange
ments could be made with Messrs.
J L. Higby 8c Co., of New Orleans, who
wo learn have several of these elevators.
At all events some effort should be made
to create u:i outlet for our grain from here
to New Orleans. There are now forty
ocean steamers plying between that poiut
and European ports, which, in connection
with the cheap water transportation thence
to New York and New England points, the
" Crescent City " should be made a large
grain market.
Order of Congressional Business.
A Washington special to the St. Louis
Republican says :
The calendar of the order of business of
tho House was furnished to-day, and will be
ready for. Congress on Monday next, which
will be the first day of the session. There
are thirteen reports of committees—that is
bills reported by committees undisposed of
—wliirii include the bill of Mr. Monroe, of
Ohio, to provide for the retirement ot worn
and mutilated national bank notes, and the
bill of Mr. Hawley of Illinois to secure the
public lands to actual settlers.
On this bill there was quite a contest. The
bill reached a decisive vote, but before it
was taken the motion was reconsidered. It
will be the first business before the House.
The bill of Scofield, of Pennsylvania,
chairman of the Naval Committee, to au
thorize the construction of ten or more
steam vessels of war, will be among the
first considered.
There are eighteen bills on the Speaker's
table, which have been passed by the Sen
ate and reported favorably by the proper
committee of the House. Tbe first ot these
is an act to prevent cruelty to animals
while in transit by railroad or other means
of transportation within tbe United States.
Sevoral others are what are termed private
bills.
The fifth on the list is an act authorizing
mail steamship service in the Gulf of Mex
ico from Now Orleans. There are two bills
to amend the enforcement act. wliieh will
cot be pressed, since they were intended
for effect dilring the presidential election,
and several relating to homesteads. The
seventeenth on the Speaker's table is an act
to authorize inquiries into tbe cause of steam
boiler explosions, and the last is to encour
age tiie growth, of timber on Western
prairies. This is au unusually small num
ber of bills on tbe Speaker's table for tbe
closing session of a Congress. Two years
ago there were seventy, among which there
were so many jobs and schemes for plunder
ing the treasury in steamship subsidies,
etc., that the House refused to go to work
on tbe Speaker's table until nearly the close
of the session, when a single objection un
der a special rule carried the Dills over.
Among the present bills there is but one
subsidy job— that of the new ocean steam
ship.
A Washington dispatch of Thursday says:
A Pennsylvania Democrat yesterday
visited the White House and was intro
duced to the President by a prominent
Pennsylvania Republican. During the in
terview the Democrat told the President
that, curious as it might seem, he voted for
him iu preference to Greeley. He also re
miuded the President that he had voted
for Buchanan. Tbe President said, drily,
"It was true he did vote for Buchanan, with
a protest. Thinking ho saw the rebellion
looming up in the future, he voted for Bu
chanan against Fremont, whom lie regard
ed as untiled for the emergency.''
This is a sporting item from the More
house Conservative:
On da.v lasf week, near the Bingham
place, on Oak Ridge, Dick Wright, while
riding along the road under the induence
of whisky, met a party of colored men and
concluded to make a display of his skill at
shooting. So he presented his pistol at the
erowd and fired. The shot took effect upon
Nathan McWoodson, killing him instantly.
The accused was arrested and brought be
fore the parish judge and conjmitted to jail.

Tvksdat Etznims, December 3, 1372. S
The money market shows a tendency to a
shade more stiingency, mainly attributed
to the drain of currency from the banks to
send into the country, which, within a
week, has covered fully $800,(WO. che
banks have consequently been less liberal
to their customers, aud more paper has
been pressed upon the street, where it aas
been readily taken at the subjoined figures^
We also noticed considerable applications at

The market opened with a fair inquiry
but. moderate supply, and more stringent
pretensions on the part of factors, who en
deavored to establish an advance of %e in
agreement with the improvement at New
Y'ork, but with indications of renewed
stringency in tbe money market, ami buy
ers being unwilling to pay any advance,
they were subsequently compelled to meet
the "demand more freely. The price s paid,
nevertheless, indicated increased strength,
audit was no longer practicable to buy
even average low middling at yesterday s

rather fuller rates for middling, the closing

the holes of any r.zed stove or range, and will do
as much work with one quart of fuel—charcoal,

done on any stove with one-half bushel. It will
boil, broil, roast, toast, bake ar.d_ stew. It is the
