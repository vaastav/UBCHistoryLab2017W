TARS ON A RAMPAGE.
■Germans Seize Deserter in Brazilian
Village Without a War
rant.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 9.—The
Brazilian embassy in this city has re
ceived a telegram from Baron de Rio
Branco, the minister of foreign affairs,
stating that several of the officers of the
German gunboat Panther went ashore
In civilian dress and visited a small fish
ing toAvu, Itajahy, in Santa Catalina,
and there without process seized a man
named Stoiuhoff, who had left his na
tive country, Germany, as a deserter
from the army and took him a prisoner
to the Panther.
Brazil’s Cruisers on Watch.
Thereupon the gunboat left Itajahy
and AA’ent to another port in the state of
Rio Grande Do Sul. The three Brazil
ian cruisers, Almirante Barraro, Benja
min Constant and Tamandare were sent
to watch the Panther and see that no
similar occurrence should again happen,
while the Brazilian government made an
official protest against the action of those
officers to the German government.
Sylvino Garget Do Amaral, first sec
retary of the Brazilian embassy, de
clared today that the . relations betAveen
Germany and Brazil have of late been
very cordial. It was therefore thought
that Germany will give prompt end full
redress to Avliat at first report appears
to be a severe breach of international
laAv. It is not known Hinder avlioso or
ders the officers of the Panther acted, if
any. Itajahy is a small fishing village
with perhaps a policeman or tAAo and
without any poAver to prevent the cap
ture of the German who Avas Hound in
a hotel.
Confer with estate Department.
Senhor Nabuco, the Brazilian ambas
sador. had an intervieAV with Acting
Secretary Bacon today in the absence of
Secretary Root. It is understood, the
ambassador communicated to Mr. Bacon
as a matter of information the cable
advices he had received from his own
government, but made no effort at this
stage to interest the department.
The opinion prevails in naval circles
here that if the facts are as represent
ed. the German government will prompt
ly disaA'OAv the action of the officers of
the Panther.
PERIL LIVES FOR FUN.
Bad Boys Hurl Stones Through Passen
ger Train Windows—lnspired
by Mischief.
CHICAGO. HI.. Dec. Railway offi
cials, who for years have tried to sup
press the small boy who throws stones at
passing trains, are saying “I told you
o!” This because investigation in
Philadelphia has shown that the lead
weight which crashed through a window
of President Roosevelt's train last Sat
urday was thrown, not by an anarchist,
but by. a boy.
No Man Threw the Weight.
“Why,”, declared R. C. Richards, gen
eral claim agent for the Chicago
North-Western railroad, “it is nonsense
to believe a man threw that lead weight.
It was only some mischievous boy who
’ may net have known the United States
has a President, and who, anyhow, had
no idea that he was on that train.”
Passengers, especially on suburban
trains, complain that frequently stones
are thrown through car windows. Nar
row escapes from injury from the flying
missile or fragments of glass are fre
aueut.

Inquiry among the railroad offices es

the ■ conviction that such a cabinet will
inspire confidence both at home and

Sir Edward Grey, and Richard Burton
Haldane alone, it is held, will give great
Aveight to the ministry and insure that
there avi 11 be no reviA r al of Gladstonian
home rule, despite the fact that the cabi
net contains a preponderance of those
favorable to borne rule.
The conservatiA'e organs point out that,
the most enthusiastic home ruler, John 1
Morley, has been sent to the India office,
where he will have little influence on in
ternal polities.
The omission of Lord Rosebery is nat
urally the subject of much comment and
there is considerable curiosity as to Avhat

Will Use Oppression to Settle
Civil Strife.
ST, PETERSBURG, Dee. 11.—(7:30
p. m-t —The telegraph lines with Mos
cow, Reval, Kieff, NoA*gorod, Archangle
and Narva are working today. It is be
lieved that the strike is collapsing. The
mails have not arrived from the south
owing to the raihvay strike.
WARSAW, Dec. 11.—The central
committee of the union of railroad men
now in session at Moscoav will probably
order a general railroad strike to begin at
midnight in consequence of the arrest of
M. Krustaleff, president of the executive
committee of the Avorkmeu’s council at
St. Petersburg. The local committee of
the railroad union has received a notifi
cation from the committee at St. Peters
burg to that effect.
Witte’s Turn, the Challenge.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 10.—(De
layed.)—There AA'as every indication this
morning that the government’s challenge
AA'ill be accepted and that Avithin forty
eight hours a general strike throughout
Russia AA'ill be ordered.
Count Witte has gone OA'er to the camp
•of the enemy, it is said, and is now an
uncompromising repressionist. He has
become convinced that it is impossible
to satisfy the people without completely
overturning the Russian kingdom. Con
sequently he has consented to the use of
force in putting doAvu all uprisings
against the Czar. This is called the goA*-
ernment’s challenge.
A terrible storm has been raised by the
arrest of M. Krnstaloff, president of the
executive committee of the Avorkmen’s
council, Avhich Avas followed during the
night by the imprisonment of the mem
bers of the Avorkmen’s council and a
number of Socialistic leaders.
Reaction Plas New Come.
“The reaction has come,” Avere the
words on every lip, and in the liberal ex
tremist camp there was only one opinion,
namely, that it must be resisted to the
bitter end. At ail the meetings last
night, some of Avhich lasted until morn
ing, the opinion was unanimous that the
government had forced the hands of the
proletariat, and the supreme Aveapon, a
general strike, must be imoked.
Newspapers Confiscated.
The newspaper editors at yesterday
evening's meeting decided that the
temporary press Hav for bidding the dis
cussion of vital questions affecting the
welfare of the nation violated the prin
ciples of freedom of speech and of the
press guaranteed by the imperial mani
festo and that it must be defied. The
result Avas that the editions of the Russ,
and half a dozen more Radical papers
Avere confiscated.
The employes of the Riga-Orcl rail
road have declared a strike on account
of the declaration of martial law in
Livoui and have sent an appeal to the
other roads to join. Last night the rail
road men of the Baltic lines decided to
follow the example of the Riga-Orel
men.
Anarchy in Livonia.
The situation in Livonia is frightful..
Absolute anarchy pre\ T ails.
A messenger who arrived here this
morning declared that the streets of
Riga were flowing AA'ith b'ood. After a
meeting the railroad men of Riga were
moAved down by the fire of machine
guns and artillery. The railroad men of
St. Petersburg at a meeting yesterday
evening resolved that inasmuch “as the
reaction is gaining force and the govern
ment is seeking to refract what Avas won
by the first Pan-Russian strike,” the
railroad men stand ready to obey the
signal for a general strike, but advise
their fellow AAorkers to await the AA'ord
from the central committee at Moscoav,
as a failure must not be risked.
Telegraphers Are Arrested.
Simultaneously AA'ith the arrests here
M. Droushilny and all the members
of the union, of the employes of the
posts and telegraph operators of Mos
coAA r . AA'ith M. Kokohanowski at their
head, were arrested at Moscow.
Czar Greets the Cossacks.

today, thanking all the Cossack troops
for their “self-sacrificing, untiring and
loyal services to the throne and father
land both at the seat of war and in the
preservation of order within the empire.”

curred in and Messrs. Smelker, Bletcher
and Crowley, appointed for the Assembly.
Recess was then taken.
The Assembly met on the sth to hear
the governor’s message and announcement
of acceptance of the United States Senator
ship.
Three petitions came into the Assembly
from Waupaca county on the 6th object
ing to the law providing for fishways In
dams and asking relief. Resolutions pre
sented and adopted wore: Mr. Smelker,
that each member be given a copy of the
laws of 1898, to be returned at the close
of the session, also copies journals of
last session; Mr. Potts, that no new bills
be introduced after December 7 except In
committees. Three lulls came in, two by
Mr. Polts for the repeal of the fishway
law and the pocket ballot law passed at
the last session. He asked that the bills
be put through under suspension, but with
drew his request on objections. Mr. Dahl
wanted the committee to consider the fish
way bill and not. have voting in the dark.
Mr. Beedlc objected to the pocket ballot
bill of Mr. Potts. Mr. Hageman introduced
a bill enlarging the powers of the railway
rate commission.
The Assembly had a sensation at the very
start of its session on the 7th, when As
semblyman Miller of Green Lake county
presented a resolution asking Gov. La Fol
lette to resign either the governorship or
the senatorshlp at once. Mr. Andrews
moved that the resolution be laid on the
liable. Mr Miller asked for a roll call, but
was not oustuined by a sufficient number,
and amid some hilarity the Andrews motion
prevailed. The measure providing for the
new $2,500,000 capltol building, which has
passed the Senate, was favorably reported
in the Assembly. The pocket ballot bill
was reported for death. It is altogether
probable that the Assembly will hold a
mock primary election in a day or two for
the purpose of testing the new law. Mr.
Schaut introduced a resolution to that ef
fect. On motion of Mr. Hube it was laid
over.
A joint resolution was introduced in the
Assembly on the Bth to provide for a
thorough Investigation into all of the af
fairs of the state university. Mr. Potter
presented a resolution for the appointment
of an index clerk for the Assembly. It was
adopted. The committee on new bills, priv
ilege and elections, presented two new bills,
one providing for an amendment to the
primary election law and one changing the
form of the official ballot. The bill amend
ing the railroad rate law was favorably re
ported. On a rising vote, the Schauer reso
lution providing for a mock primary elec
tion by the Assembly to test the operation
of the proposed primary law was adopted.
The speaker announced that he would fix
a date for the election as soon as bill should
be printed. The new capitol bill was on the
calendar for advancement and under sus
pension was taken up for passage. Mi.
Brockhausen’s amendment limiting work on
the new building to eight hours a day came
up. Mr. Andrew said that was a proposition
of great importance and wanted the bill
and amendment rereferred, which prevailed.
Another amendment to the primary election
law has been Introduced by Mr. Thomas
to provide that no candidate can secure the
names of more than 10 per cent, of the
voters of any district in which he is run
ning for office for his nomination papers.
The law provides that he must secure at
least 2 per cent, of the electors to sign his
nomination papers, but in some counties the
candidate first In the field lias secured the
signatures of proctically all the voters in
the district. Assemblyman Brockhausen,
Social Democrat, submitted an amendment
to the new capitol bill providing that the
eight-hour day shall apply in all work on
the new structure.

was adopted by the Senate. All business is
to close on Wednesday, December 13, ex

MAKING DREAMS USEFUL.
Daily Life the Main Factor in Causing
Our Night Time Visions,
A. E. Gibson presents an exhaustive
analysis of the physical and psychical
basis of dreams. He sums up his views
in part as follows: To sum up the ar
gument. dream and waking differ in de
cree and form of manifestation only, not
m principle and essence. Like waking
consciousness, dream reveals, but does
not create. The same world that sur
rounds the waking individual surrounds
the dreaming, only the viewpoints and
media of observation are changed.
As che life experience of an individual
in his waking consciousness receives its
character and value by and through his
power of response to environment, so in
a similar way the value of a dream de
pends upon the power of the Ego to re
spond to consciousness in its various
forms of emotions, ideas and feelings
which constitute the environments of the
subjective or dream plate. Waking or
dreaming, the individual is, or becomes,
what he choses to be at any given mo
ment of his existence.
The background .for ordinary dreams
consists of undigested remnants of wak
ing life. Hence, ordinary dreams are
merely undigested life, being made up by
longings, desires, anticipations, idle hopes
and miscarried realizations, which, occu
pying the mind during the day, ar over
taken by sleep before having reached
their fruition. Hence the mixture, in
most dreams, of the sane and the insane,
of truth and delusion.
On the other hand, the life lived out
and assimilated in a purposeful existence
becomes absorbed in the formation of
character and leaves no residue to form
the bizarre staging for the confused
dream. And to such an individual the
intuitions of dream life, with their daz->
zling imaginary, will introduce symbols
which, properly interpreted, may carry
the significance of prevision or prophecy-
Therefore, to turn dreams into useful, in
telligent and intelligible factors, we must
fill our waking life with deeds and
thoughts of universal usefulness, and
freight the train of events with an un
flinching devotion to duty and virtue.—

Tennessee Praise.
Dayton, Tenn., Dec. 11.—(Special.)
Among many prominent residents to
praise Dodd’s Kidney Pills is Mr. N.
R. Roberts of this place. He tells of
"What they have done for him, and his
words will go deep into the hearts of
all who are suffering in the same way.
He says:
“I was a martyr to Kidney Trouble,
but Dodd’s Kidney Pills completely
cured me. I shall always keep them
on hand In ease there should be any re
turn of the old trouble, but I am thank
ful to say they did their work so well
there has not been the slightest sign
of my old complaint coming back. The
pain in my back used to be terrible.
If I got down I bad a bard job to get
straight again. But my back is like a
new one now and I cau stoop as much
as I please. I don’t believe there ever
was any medicine half so good as
Dodd’s Kidney Pills.”
Concerning Dice Shaking.
A traveling man stepped up to the
cigar stand in a Kansas City hotel the
other day and offered to shake “Indian
dice” for the cigars. The clerk procured
the dice box and was about to throw
first, when the man across the case,
stopped him.
“If you don’t mind. I’d like to shakd
first.” said the traveling man.
The clerk handed over the dice box,
and the other man shook and won.
“Now I’ll tell you something,” said;
the traveling man when he had received 1
bis free cigar. “The man who shakos
first when Indian dice is the game has
an advantage over his opponent. He
throw his three dashes. The other fel
low has only as many throws as the
first shaker chooses to take. In throw
ing for the three horses the first shaker
dictates the number of shakes twice.’
It has been figured out that the advan
tage amounts to about 17 per cent. 1
don’t know that it is that much, but
think it over and you’ll see that the
advantage is there.” —Kansas City
Times.
With a Reformer.

iron master and owner of race horses,
once decided to run for Parliament. Ho
stood as candidate for Glasgow. He

his meetings where the heckling of can
didates was the feature, as in all Scot
tish elections, he was asked, after lie had
disposed summarily of the crown, the
House of Lords and most of the British
constitution, whether he would abolish
the decalogue. “Certainly,” cried the
valiant Merry. Then, turning to his
nearest neighbor on the platform, he
asked in an audible whisper. “Jack, what
in thunder’s the decalogue?”—Cleveland

Good One on Mr. Undunr
Apropo ; of the movement for munici
pal ownership in a certain large city not
a thousand miles from Chicago, an ex
ceedingly laughable and amusing story
is related, says the New York Mail.
It seems that some friends of a certain
high official in that city, whom wo will
call M r Unduun, were in Washing
ton the other day. While there they
met an acquaintance, who said to them:
“Well, boys, I understand the great
cause of immediate municipal ownership
in your city is on its last legs.”
“Perhaps it is,” they answered with
spirit, “but M r Undunn is still kick
ing for it with all his might!”
—ln Scotland the subject of a practic
al joke on the list of April is called a
“gowk,” while in Franco he is termed
“poisson d’April,” or “April fish.”
A BRAIN WORKER
Must Have the Kind of Food <bal
Xonriahes Brain.
“I am a literary man whose nervous
energy is a great part of my stock in
trade, and ordinarily I have little pa
tience with breakfast foods and the
extravagant claims made of them. But
I cannot withhold my acknowledg
ment of the debt that I owe to Grape-
Nuts food.
“I discovered long ago that the very
bulkiness of the ordinary diet was not
calculated to give one a clear head, the
power of sustained, accurate thinking.
I always felt heavy and sluggish in
mind as well as body after eating the
ordinary meal, which diverted the
blood from the brain to the digestive
apparatus.
*T tried foods easy of digestion, but
found them usually deficient in nutri
ment. I experimented with many
breakfast foods and they, too, proved
unsatisfactory, till I reached Grape-
Nuts. And then the problem was
solved.
"Grape-Nuts agreed with me perfect
ly from the beginning, satisfying my
hunger and supplying the nutriment
that so many other prepared foods:
lack.
“I had not been using it very long
before T found, that I was turning out!
an unusual quantity and quality of
work. Continued use has demonstra-|
ted to my entire satisfaction that
Grape-Nuts fqod contains all the ele
ments needed by the brain and ner
vous of the hard working pub
lic writer.” Name given by Postum
