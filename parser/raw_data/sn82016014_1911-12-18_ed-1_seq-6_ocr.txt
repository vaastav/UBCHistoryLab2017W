Kaws Do Not Kxpect to Use Him
Next Year.
"Rabbit" Powell. Witb Sprained
Ankle, Fears for Future.
Kansas City Star: Joe' Crisp, a Kan
sas City boy who tried, out with the
St. Louis Browns last spring and af
terwards played with Topeka in the
Western league, says that his injured
knee has rounded into fine condition
and will not trouble him next season.
'risp first broke into fast company as
a catcher with Monte Cross's Blues
several years ago. He was sold to
Newark in the Kastern league, now
the International. and made good
right off the reel. Ilo was sold to the
Browns, but met with an accident late
in the season that put him out of the
game and left him with a knee that
prevented him from showing his best
form in St. Iwuiis the following spring.
Joe says the old injury's mended now
and he hopes to be back in faster
company next spring.
The Topeka management expects to
dispose of Crisp and is not counting
him among their catchers.
Lincoln Star: The announcement
from Sioux City that Tom Fairweather
intends to purchase an interest in an
other Western league club points di
rectly at the portly Packer magnate
becoming interested in the Lincoln
franchise. There is plenty of local
capital which would be invested in
the Antelopes, but the aforesaid
plutes have no special knowledge of
the baseball business themselves, and
desire to place a man at the head of
the club who can take care of their in
terests for them. If they have inter
ested Fairweather they have done
well. The big boss of the Packers is
ft) two fisted, square footed. husky i
proposition, with a mind and ideas of j
his own. yet, withal, affable and well
liked all over the circuit by those who
have met him. Tom Fairweather as i
president of the Lincoln club would
appeal to a good many bugs. "Portly
Tom" has annexed one pennant for
his burg.
St. Joseph Gazette: "Rabbit"
Powell. St. Joseph's speedy outfielder,
who was sold to the Chicago White
Sox last fall for $5,000, has sprained
his ankle and may be laid up at his
home in Adair. Ok., the rest of the
winter. Alexander Zwilling, one of
Powell's teammates, who is wintering
here, received a postal card from
Powell yesterday, telling him of the
accident. Powell did not say how he
sustained the injury. He simply said
he had sprained his ankle and did not
know when he could play ball again.
Owner Jack Holland of the Drum
mers, when seen last night, stated that
he did not think Powell's injury was
serious. He believes he will be able i
to play all right in the spring.
St. Joseph Gazette: Letters received by
"Tex" Jones, who played with the Drum
mers during the seasons of 1910 and 1911
from M. Em Cantillon, president of the
.wnneapons American association club,
Indicate that he will become a member of 1
the Minneapolis club. If he falls to make I
good with the Chicago White Sox in the
1912 spring practice.
Cantillon has written Jones, asking him
how he would like to play with the
Millers. Jones replied that it would suit
him if he could get the money, so it is
not at all unlikely that the big Drummer
will go to the association team, especially
as Charles A. Comiskey, owner of the
Chicago White Sox, to whom Jones was
sold this season, has a habit of placing
many of his players with Cantillon's team.
Jones was sold to Chicago on a partial
payment plan, whereby he is to be re
turned here if e fails to make good, but
Comiskey could get around this clause in
the contract by completing his payments
for the local player. Then Jones would
become Comiskey's property, outright,
and the latter could dispose of him as he
pleased subject to waivers.
WICHITA DREAMS OF BASEBALL.
Pueblo or Des Moines Team Wanted
in Kansas Town.
AVichita, Kan.. Dec. 18. It is an
nounced here that a AVestern league
team may be brought to this city in
the spring if an uptown park can be
built to be leased to the management
of the club at a reasonable figure.
Trouble with street car service has
been one of the great drawbacks to
good attendance at ball games in
Wichita and a park within walking
distance of the city would probably
be a big thing in making a team a
paying proposition here.
As yet it has not been announced
here definitely just what team is in
prospect, but there Is no denial that
It Is the Pueblo team that is being
seriously considered. There is a pos
sibility that another team might be
secured, but probably not as good a
team nor one that would be as popu
lar here, the Pueblo bunch all being
known in this city.
Tt is understood that a move to
bring the team from Pueblo will
meet with a storm of protest from
that city. There is much talk that
Comiskey would give the management
of the Des Moines team to Isbell if he
could dispose of his present bunch
and be free to take it. Isbell is re
ported to have said that he will not
attempt to appear in uniform at any
games next season, letting "Shoddy"
Shaw take charge if he keeps his
present team.
Michigan and Oklahoma universities
and possibly with Kansas, Nebraska,
Wisconsin. Ames and Iowa universi
ties, with which negotiations are pending.
HE WANTS LIBEL SUIT.
Johnson Hopes Brush will Go on
With Libel Action.
Chicago. Dec. IS. President B. B.
Johnson of the American league said
last night that he would welcome a
libel suit such as that threatened by
the New York National club. The
I threatened suit grows out of charges
brought by the head of the juror or
l ganization regarding ticket scalping
I at the recent world's series in New
j York.
"I hope the New York club carries
out the threat," said Johnson, "for it
would give me the needed opportunity
to get the guilty individuals into court.
I do not anticipate any action by the
Gotham club, however."
After discussing the ticket scandal
Johnson announced that the spring
schedule meetings of the American
league would continue as in former
years. Recently the league chief fa
favored a proposition to abandon this
feature on the ground of it being un
necessary.
GIVE BATTER CHANCE
gast said. "I intend to come back
then to Los Angeles and begin prepar
ing for my right with Freddie Welsh,
which will take place about July 4,
at Vernon.
"I am in fine shape now and feel
strong enough to leave the hospital
and hope to be outside in another
week.
MYSTERIOUS BILLY WILL DIE.
Ward Would Call Only One Foul
Strike.
AT)1!E AS IS AFTER PFAAAX'
New York. Dec. 18. If John M.
Ward. chairman of the national
league's rules committee has his way
the foul strike rule will be modified so
that the first foul only will be called
a strike instead of the first two as
at present.
"The present foul strike rule," he
explains, "is too great a handicap for
the batsman to overcome and gives
the pitcher an immense advantage.
Perhaps It might be better to call the
strikes on fouls that drop within a
certain radius of home. It is possible
that I shall advocate the leveling of
the pitcher's box."
New Soo Manager Seeks Strong Pitch
ing Staff.
Sioux City. Ia., Dec. 18. Sioux
City's new manager, George Andreas,
Is to have free rein in the matter of
getting together an aggregation which
will capture the Western league rag j
in 1912.
E. J. Hanlon. F. 1 Hutchins and D.
E. Kerby. the three business men
who recently purchased the franchise,!
have great confidence in the former
captain's ability and have left things j
entirely with him. He will go east j
the last of this week to look over a j
number of possibilities. He is very j
optimistic about it, too, and says that
with an even break of luck Sioux City
will land on top next fall.
The sale of the franchise has served
to greatly increase the interest here
and local fans think that Sootown is
going to recover from last season's
slump without any difficulty.
Andnas says he's going to get to
gether a pitching staff that will lead
the league and then build a strong
supporting aggregation around it.

Topeka, Karros,
Some of His Players Have Loos: Since
Been Dead.
Chicago, Dec. IS. Jake Stahl. new
ly chosen manager of the Boston
American league team, found several
surprises last night while making an
examination of his roster of players.
One surprise was the purchase and
sale of a player of the name of Lock
wood, wh'o is dead. Lockwood was
purchased from the Vancouver, B. C,
club, and later let go to Sacramento.
He also found that he had one pitcher
less than he thought. Fournier, also
purchased from Vancouver and
thought by Stahl to be a pitcher, turn
ed out to be a catcher.
The new manager said he had made
formal application to the commission
for reinstatement. He expects to be
placed in good standing as soon as the
members can take a mail vote. His
refusal to report to Boston last year
caused the black mark against his
name. He expects to be ready to go
with his players on March 1 0 to Hot
Springs to begin training.

FOOLER AND CLARKE WIN.
lx-ad Other Six Day Racers by Lap at
( lose of Race.
New York, Dec. 18. Joe Kogler of
Brooklyn, and "Jackie" Clarke of Mel
bourne. Australia, won the six day
bicycle race which ended at 10 o'clock
Saturday night in Madison Square
garden. The Fogler-Clarke team
finished one lap ahead of six other
teams bunched in a tie for second
place.
The finish lacked the excitement of
the windup of six day races in recent
years. Fogler and Clarke practically
won the race at an early hour in the
morning when a series of sensational
sprints resulted in their gaining a lap
on the field. The advantage thus
gained was held to the finish.
Fogler and Clarke won by pedalling
?.71S miles and n laps in 142 hours r
the contest. To the six teams imme
diately following 7,718 miles and 8
laps were credited. The winners were
IS miles 2 laps behind the record of
2.737 miles and 1 lan, made by Mc
Farland and Moran in 1908.
GOTO! WILL MEET WIXSER.
Fatally Shot by Man Who Married His
Former Wile.
Portland, Ore., Dec. 18. "Mysterious
Billy" (Amos) Smith, at one time a
well known welterweight prize fighter,
was fatally shot here by Captain A.
B. Loomis, of the river steamer "We
Own."
The shooting is said to be the out
come of a series of quarrels in which
the two men had engaged at various
times since last August, when Smith's
wife secured a divorce. Later Loomis
married the woman.
As Mrs. Loomis was walking along
the street. Smith approached and ad
dressed her. Suddenly Loomis, whom
Smith had not seen, stepped forward
and shot Smith in the abdomen. Smith
fell to the sidewalk and Loomis fired
two more shots into his body. Smith
fired several shots at Loomis, but his
bullets went wild.
Mrs. Loomis was arrested and is held
under $1,00(1 bonds.
Smith came here from Portland, Me.,
about 15 years ago. His ring career
dates from 3S97 to 1903. Though never
a claimant of the championship, he is
said to have been one of the best wel
terweight fighters in the country. His
five fights with Joe Walcott, the fam
ous negro boxer, did much toward build
ing up Smith's reputation as a fighter.
Smith had been in trouble with the
ponce on several occasions.
