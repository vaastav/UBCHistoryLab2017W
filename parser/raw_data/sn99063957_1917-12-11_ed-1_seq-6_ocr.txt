PRESIDENT HAY TAKE
OVER ALL RAILROADS
Members of Cabinet Are Try
ing Him Strongly to Take
Such Action
Washington, Dec. 11. Members of
President Wileon'a cabinet today were
bringing pressure to bear on him to
take over the railroads and run them
for the period of the war.
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo,
it was learned today on unquestionable
authority, is the leading advocate of
government control. He urged the pres
ident to cut the eordian knot of the
whole transportation problem by seiz
ins the country 's . railroads and doing
anything necessary to insure their ef
ficient operation to win the war.
McAdoo and other cabinet members
pressed their views at this afternoon's
, ; . if
caoinet meeting, ine saints ujgu u
thority stated that the president will
undoubtedly go before congress with a
railroad mossage. This message is to
be written after today's cabinet meeting-
'
It was learned that it wili include
proposals which tho railroads regard
as "strong measures in view or tne
railroad executives' program as out
lined to the president yesterday.
The president is declared to nave
flatly rejected the railroad terms of
higher rates, dratt exemption ior rau-i
way employes and government aid in
obtaining financial credits.
As the result the railroads war Doard
sought an appointment with the pres
ident to make a last stand. Ho will re
ceive them tomorrow afternoon at the
white house.
'Our consistent effort has been to
be of servico to the nation, in time of
war," said Chairman Fairfax .Harri
son of the board today.
'We hope that we may be able to
be of assistance to the president in
respect of any action he may contemplate."
Henry Ford's Views '
New York, Dec. 11. Lighter rail
road equipment and a unified trans
portation system will solve America's
railroad nroblem, Henry Ford declared
today in a statement to the New York
Evening Mail.
Ford asserted that steel of great
strength but much less weight could
'be used by the roads to reduce operat
ing costs.
''The freight car weighs as much as
the load it carries," said Ford. "Gen
erally, it travels two thirds full and
comes back empty. Passenger trains
weigh fifty to one hundred aud.tnty
times as much, as the passengers in
them."
Ford deqjared the banking interests
that control railroads are so busy t'g
uring on profits that they don't know
what ails their own transportation sys
tems. "Kailroad management requires
technically trained men who know how
to run engines, machines, dig tunnels
and design better equipment," he said
"The railroad situation is like a
man who has been so busily engaged
for thirty years in working on the mod
el of a new invention that ho does not
tee what is going on. Now he looks up,
only to find that his model is out of
Uato and not good enough.
'Tho United States needs one uni
fied railway system, tying together all
parts of the country.
"Through tho proxy sysiem, control
of our railroads has passed largely to
bankers living in New York ami other
large cities-
Ford said that lour filths or. a rail
road's work today is hauling the dead
weight of its own equipment and that
frequent rate increases to protect
stocks and bonds would not relieve tne
situation. He declared that concrete
highwavs should be built so trucks and.
automobiles can -take over tne snort
haul work which now congests rail
wavs, that superfluous rail lines be
eliminated, all parts of the country
tapped by railroads and both pnsen-
ger and lreignt rates reuucea-
"America is a land or great dis
tances and cheap, easy traveling and
eificieut, inexpensive ireiglit service
are necessities," ho said.
Alley steels of high tensile strengtB
can be made to reduce railroad weights
Ford said.
BRITISH AND
TROOPS DIC TRETtCHES
Defense Lines of Western
Front Being Duplicated to
- HoM Teutons
By Henry Wood
With The French Armies in Italy,
Dec. 11. British and French troops to
day are duplicating on the Italian
front the impregnable Jbritisn and
French treneh lines on the west front,
while Germany and Austria prepare
their greatest of all assaults to break
through.
The geographic advantages are with
the enemy. The Austro-Germans now oc
cupy the crest and the southern slopes
of the Alps. Their positions completely
dominate the entire Venetian and Lom
bardy plains. Every movement of the
Italian, French and British armies on
the flat ground is plainly visible to the
enemy.
The Brent a, Piave,-Adige and other
valleys traverse the. Alps and furnish
doorways for an invasion which are
exceedingly difficult of defense.
Behind the enemy 's lines the Alps are
traversed east and west by roadways
nermittinir rapid transfer of troops and
materials for sudden, changing attacks.
They furnish great arteries of commun
ication from east to west of the Piave
or even from west of Lake Garda.
Any success to an attack like the
present one on the Asiago plateau would
force immediate abandonment of the
Piave' line. It would mean a retreat by
the Italians either to the Adage or the
Po lines.
Not only does the actual tattle, line
contour thus favor the enemy, but Ger
many and Austria both have access to
the easiest and most direct Alpine pass
es for the line of communications back ,They had it that Tcner is through un-
home. One of these is the historic Jiren- loss he can have his own way complete

HERMAN AND TENER
WILL FIGHT IT OUT
Battle For Control of National
League May Be Decided
Today
. By H. C. Hamilton
(United Press staff correspondent)
New York, Dec. 11 Who's who in
the National league probably will be
docided today. At least some progress
in that direction will bo made when .'
Garry Herrmann, chairman of the na
tional commission, and John K. Tfner,
'president of the National league, be
gin exchanging glares across the gheen
table in the stateroom at the Waldoff.
Garry is merely a club owner so far
las his connection -with the National
league is concerned.
Herrmann had what some folks have
called bad taste enough to call a joint
"meeting of the American and National
'club owners, to follow the annual meet
ings of tho big leagues. Tener feels
'that the president of .the league should
nave something to say about it.
There have been rumors that Tener
would declare to the world his inten
tion of leaving baseball unless Garry
withdraws his summons to a joint talk
ing contest. If he does that, it is Be
lieved Herrmann will back down and
take next best. Tener has shown sim
(self to bo a most powerful figure in
baseball. He said last summer he would
not. be a candidate for re-election, but
to. short time later the league magnates
unanimously requested him to again ac
taept the presidency and Tener said he
would. So far as is known, that still is
his intontion.
It has been an accepted fact that
the procedure would be only a matter
V)f form, with congratulations already
prepared for Tener. However, disquiet
ing rumors were bandying aDout ifau.y
It was over this way that the German
armies crossed and invaded the Vene
tian plains during the middle ages con
flicts between Germany and the Papacy.
The French and British veterans have
taken over vulnerable sectors of the
Italian line. They have already made
themselves almost at home. Their
trenches and dugouts are modeled exact
ly along the lines of those from which
French and British held tne lierman in
vasion into Belgium and France to a
standstill.
General Pepino Garibaldi, who, fol
lowing the American-Mexican war
fought in the French foreign legion, is
now fighting alongside French soldiers
again. He remained in the foreign le
gion, until Italy came into the war and
then loined ner rorces. rue general nau
two brothers killed in the foreign legion.
The International league will be in
simultaneous session wjth its big broth
er today, the session of the big minor
'having been adjourned to await the
'arrival of a pair of delayed club own-tors-
Jack Hendricks, manager of the In
dianapolis club, is expected to . reach
Ithe city today for a conference t:$
IBranck Rickey, president of the Car
dinals, over Hendricks' signing a con
tract to manage the tarainais.

WHEN housewives first adopted Mazola they found the deep
frying, sauteing and shortening medium which they have
been seeking for years. -
Mazola browns food quickly, preventing any penetration of oil
and gives crisp, delicious dishes free from sogginess, easy to digest.
The results are so much better than with lard or compounds that
Mazola is used in thousands of American homes.
And now when Food Administrator Hoover asks us to save butter,
lard and suet, the housewife knows that she has a really good vegetable oil.
With Mazola she can help save the country's resources and at
the same time give her family the best of food at a notable saving
in cost.
Unlike other mediums Mazola does not transmit taste or odor
from one food to another can be used over and over again a
great factor in economy.
And when you want an especially delicious salad dressing,
use Mazola. There is no need to give up salads because of
the uncertain supply or high prices of olive oil.
Mazola can be had from vourerocer in pint, quart, half-
gallon and gallon tins. Ask him for the free Mazola Book
