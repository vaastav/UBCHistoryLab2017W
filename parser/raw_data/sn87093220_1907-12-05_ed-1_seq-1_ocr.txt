THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
President Roosevelt Officially Addresses the
Sixtieth Congress.
Would Have Railroads Under National Charter.
Currency Legislation. Abuse of Injunction
Power. Tariff Revision Must Wait. Ad
vocates Postal Savings Banks. Pay
Campaign Expenses Out of
Public Treasury.
The president in his message to con
gress says:
No nation has greater resources than
ours, and I think It can be truthfully
said that the citizens of no nation pos
sess greater energy and industrial abil
ity. In no nation are the fundamental
business conditions sounder than In
ours at this very moment, and it Is
foolish when such Is the case for peo
ple to hoard money Instead of keeping
It In sound banks, for It Is such hoard
ing that is the immediate occasion of
money stringency. Moreover, as a
rule, the business of our people Is con
ducted with honesty and probity, and
this applies alike to farms and fac
tories, to railroads and banks, to all
our legitimate commercial enterprises.
In any large body of men, however,
there are certain to be some who are
dishonest, and If the conditions are
such that these men prosper or commit
their misdeeds with Impunity their
example is a very evil thing for the
community." Where .these men are
business men of great sagacity and of
temperament both unscrupulous and
reckless, and where the conditions are
such that they act without supervision
or control and at first without effective
check from public opinion, they delude
many Innocent people Into making in
vestments or embarking In kinds of
business that are really unsound. When
the misdeeds of these successfully dis
honest men are discovered, suffering
comes not only upon them, but upon
the Innocent whom they have misled.
It Is a painful awakening, whenever it
occurs, and naturally when it does oc
cur those who suffer are apt to forget
that the longer it was deferred the
more painful it would be. In the effort
to punish the guilty It Is both wise and
proper to endeavor so far as possible
to minimize the distress of those who
have been misled by the guilty. Yet It
Is not possible to refrain because of
such distress from striving to put an
end to the misdeeds that are the ulti
mate causes of the suffering and, as a
i \eans to this end, where possible to
punish those responsible for them.
There may be honest differences of |
opinion as to many governmental poli
cies, but surely there can be no such
differences as to tho need of unflinch
ing perseverance in the war against
successful dishonesty.
Interstate Commerce.
No small part of the trouble that w«
have comes from carrying to an ex
treme the national virtue of self reli
ance, of Independence in initiative
and action. It is wise to conserve this
virtue and to provide for Its fullest
exercise compatible with seeing that
liberty does not become a liberty to
wrong others. Unfortunately this Is
the kind of liberty that the lack of all
effective regulation Inevitably breeds.
The founders of the constitution pro
vided that the national government
s!i(v:!.l have complete and sole control
of interstate commerce. There was
then practically no interstate business
are . ;-li was conducted by water,
ami t'iis tin? national government at
once pr >cee 'e ,1 to regulate In thorough
going and effective fashion. Conditions
have no-.v so wholly changed that the
Interstate commerce by water Is lnslg
uiiicnnt compared with the amount
that goes by land, and almost all big
business concerns are now engaged in
Interstate commerce. As a result it can
be but partially and Imperfectly con
trolled or regulated by the action of
any one of the several states, such ac
tion inevitably tending to be either
too drastic or else too lax and in either
case ineffective for purposes of justice.
Only the uational government con in
thoroughgoing fashion exercise the
needed control. Tills does not mean
that there should be any extension of
federal authority, for such authority
already exists under the constitution
In amplest and most far reaching form,
but It does mean that there should be
an extension of federal activity. This
Is not advocating centralization. It is
merely looking facts In the face and
realizing that centralization in business
has already come and cannot be avoid
ed or undone and that the public at
large can only protect Itself from cer
tain evil effects of this business cen
tralization by providing better methods
for the exercise of control through the
authority already centralized In the
national government by the conatttu

ABERDEEN,, WASHINGTON, THURSDAY. DECEMBER 5 1907
TODD MURDER CASE
GARRULITY NOW INSTEAD OF
FORMER SILENCE.
Officials and Mrs. Todd Talk as fast
as Anybody. Steele's Bloody
Clothing Pound Three Weeks Ago.
Mrs. Todd Denies the Statemenf
of Attorney Abel.
Marshal McKinney, of Hoqniam, and
Mrs. Todd are now inclined to be as
garrulous as they have heretofore been
reticent. On Tuesday, McKinney gave
out to his private press bureau the fact
that three weeks before he had found the
bloody clothes worn by Steele on the
night of the murder. The clothes had
been hidden under a Hoqniam dock,
where they were found by the marshal a
few days before the last arrest of Steele.
Just what end of justice has been served
by concealing this information from the
public since the death of the murderer
does not appear, and, taken in connec
tion with the other amateurish conceal
ments in the case, will be attributed to
the marshal's having considered the in
formation his own private property.
The discovery of the blood stained
clothes will tend to disprove the state
ment of Steele to Attorney Abel, in
which he charged Mrs. Todd with having
struck the fatal blows. Such blows
would have caused the one delivering
them to be sprinkled with the blood of
the victim, and doubt is expressed of the
strength of Mrs. Todd to strike such
blows.
The revelation of the clothes was sent
to the daily papeis Tuesday, in a story
that more than hints of a political play
by Marshal McKinney to land the office
of sheriff next year. Whether there iB
anything in this or not, the manner in
which almost all of the information of
this case is given to the public is a dis
grace to the community. The average
reader would be led to believo that Frank
Todd was murdered for the purpose of
allowing a couple of alleged daily papers
to exploit themselves. To now inject
politics into it, on top of this teapot tem
pest among the dailies, is exceeding bad
taste, to say the least.
The editor of the Washingtonian inter
viewed Mrs. Todd Tuesday, and found
the lady quite willing to talk, instead of
being in her former attitude of "there is,
nothing to say." The interview resulted
in nothing new regarding the case, fur
ther than Mrs. Todd deried having offered
to pay money to Attorney Abel for the
defease of Steele. She said that she
met Abel at his request in an Aberdeen
law office; that he wanted to see her
alone, but her sister insisted upon being
present, and that Abel apparently want-
Ed to know if she would pay him for
Steele's defense, but was prevented from
touching the subject by reason of her
sister's presence.
This denial of Abel's statement will be
taken for what it is worth. , Without at
tempting to defend the veracity of Abel,
it ia submitted that so far as can be seen
he had absolutely no motive in stating a
falsehood. While, if the statement be
true, it places Mrs. Todd in a very bad
light, go that she would have a strong
reason for the denial. The question of
veracity between the lawyer and the lady
is left to the reader.
NEW ELECTRIC PUNT
G. H. Railway & Liglit
Co'sUew Power House
is Completed and
Ready For
Machinery.
The new power house at Electric park
for the Grays Harbor Kail way A Light
Co., is now completed, and workmen are
busy Betting the boilers and machinery.
The building is composed of brick and
cement and is of the most substantial
character. It is 100 feet square, the side
walls being 40 feet high. The division
wall which separates the boiler room
from the machinery, runs the full length
of the building, and is 50 feet high,
making the machinery and boiler rooms
each 50x100 feet each
With the exception of the window and
door frames, there is no wood in the
structure, the ladders being iron, the
floors of concrete, the balance being en
tirely of brick, cement and iron, making
the building as near fireproof as possible.
The north half is entirely used hs a
boiler and fire room, the battery being
composed of three sets, known as the
Babcock & Wilcox safety boilers. The
peculiarity of this boiler is that the tubes
contain the water and they stand per
pendicularly, being attached to a steam
drum twenty feet above the furnace, the
steam generated passing into the drums
and from thein into a coil of pipe ex
posed to the heat from the furnace, the
coil being known as a superheater, and
from this the steam passes to the engine.
The main tubes instead of being encased
with iron as in the ordinary boiler, are
entirely exposed to the beat, the sur
rounding brick walls concealing them
from view. A dutch oven will take the
place o( the ordinary furnace, the fuel
being chopped or hogged before being
fed to the farnaces. The smoke is carried
by jackets to a brick smoke stack, 100
feet high, on the extreme end of the
building.
The south half of the building is divid-
Ed into two stories, the lower one being
12 feet in the clear, and will contain the
condensing plant, the steam pumps, the
centrifugal circulating steam pumps and
other minor machinrey. The uppor
floor contains the large Westinghouse &
Parsons turbine engine and dynamo,
which generates 1,500 horse power or
1,000 kilowats of electricity.
No electric power plant in the North
west is as up-to-date in every particulnr
as ttiis will be when completed, every
thing used in the way of machinery,
power, or other appliances being of the
very best material and latest pattern.
To meet the demands of the contem
plated improvements, which includes,
the extension to the Lytle mill up the ■
Hoquiam river, the extension up Broad
way and along Sixth street in this city,
it will be necessary to still maintain the
small power houses In Hoquiam and
Aberdeen, the advantage especially be
ing the fact of always having a relay
power in ccse of a break down in any one
of the plants.
It is estimated bv the engineer who is
setting the new machinery, that the new
plant will be all ready to operate by the
middle of next February, giving to Grays
Harbor the best power house of its size
in the Northwest.

Neville of Tacoma Married, f, mi
Tacoma, Dec. 3.—Dr. E. L. Woodruff,
an oßteopath of Montesano, and Miss
Marie Gorman Neville, a young music
teacher of Tacoma, were united in mar
riage Sunday evening, at the home
of Justice John W. Linck. Miss Neville
lives at 714 South Alder street and it a
well known young woman, while the
groom is a prominent Montesano young
man. The young people have known
each other for three years, and the event
of Sunday night, even if it did bring
Justice Linck from his evening worship
and County Auditor W. A. Stewart from
his bearthside, had been planned some
time ago by the mother and friends of
the interested parties. A marriage li
cense was secured in Montesano, but was
lest, and being unable to find it Sunday,
it was neressary to make an automobile
trip to the deputy county auditor's home
and then to the courthouse to secure a
new one. Harry M. Owens, a local at
torney, performed the duties of best man,
while Mrs. Owens was bridesmaid.
