.'Sury rIaoriic,si Cousin.
"Mary, I am astonished!''
Of course the grave elder sister "was
astonished. In truth, and in lact, 'she
lied in a chronic state of amazement ; for
Mary Thorne was always doing something
to astonish her friends and relatives. Miss
Kuth could hardly credit the evidence of
her own senses, in the harry glow of the
August morning, when she came out of
the clematis shadows of the little south
porch and discovered that yonder moving
object, half way up among the umbrageous
branches of iho huge, old pear tree, was
not a spray cf leaves, nor. a russet-plumed
robin, nor yet a cluster of sun-cheeked
pears swinging in the blue empyrean, but j
Miss Marv Theme, comfortably perched
in the crook of the gnarled tree, her curbs
all flecked with the sifted rain of sunshine
that came down through the shifting can
op v of leaves, and a book in her lap.
"I don't care." said the little damsel.
laughing sauey defiance. "It's the nicest,
place iu the world up here; I feel just like
a bird, with the leaves fluttering against
my face, and the wind blowing so softly
and I intend to stay here! ' Wouldn't you
like to come up here, lluthy ':' It's easily

ltuth, who was thirty, and weighed a

with amazemen:.

"Wed, tntii, have it joaruffn way,
you incorrigible romp ! I wish you
weren't too big to be shut up a dark
eloset, or have your ears well boxed V
"It is a pity, isn't, it ?" said Mary de
murely. "Of course it is, Mary. If cousin Tom
Bradley comes this morning, be sure and
explain to him why we are absent, and
behave like a young lady, mind !"
"Alt right," said Marv, dauutlesaly.
"I always likrd Tom ; we mod to have

She sat there in the old pear tree,

might have haunted the mossy old vete

with huashine and carmine, her dimpled

uoW breaking into a soft little warble of
iong that made evcu the robins them-
selves rut their bead to one side to listen.
Ihe carriage had driven away long since
she bad watched it beyond the curve
of the winding road ; the dark mautle of
si;ailow was shiwlv ftillowin"- the creetifi-
sun glow across the velvet lawn be.ow,
iwd the old church spire among the far
-j ..--0 --!-
ii' woods had chimed eleven. And still
Mary lhorne sat there : in the forked
branches of the giant pear tree 1
Suddenly there floated up iuto the
leafy Sanctuary, a pungent, aromatic odor,
which made her lean curiously forward,
shading her c'3'es with one hand, the better
to , penetrate the green foliage below.
Not the late monthly roses, not the ame
thyst borders of heliotrope, nor the spicy
geraniums: none ut these blossoms dis
tilled that peculiar smell ! -
"My patience," said little Mary, "it's a
cigar 1".
A cigar it was, and the owner thereof
-she could just see a white linen coat
and a tail head covered with black. wavy
curls stood; on the porch steps, quietly
smoking a. .d indulging iu a lengthened
view of the garden slopes.
"That's Tom Bradley," raid M:i

v?ry accent of imperative summons, aud
theu burst into merry laughter, at the
evident amazement with which the stran
ger gazed round him, vainly trying to
conjecture whence the call had proceeded.
"1'ou dear, stupid Cousin Tom," she
ejaculated "'don't stare oil toward the
cabbage beds ! Look straight up here :
you may come up if you please. There's
plenty of room for both, l'ou are Cousin
Tom, aren't you?" she continued, as a
sudden misgiving crossed her mind.
"Of course I am and you are Mary, I
suppose."
"Mary herself! Up with you, Tom

"Well, i couldn't help it and besides

above iUary.
"Why, Tom, how you have changed!"

the curls with one hand, that she might

Mary turned away, with eriiubou indigna

"I am sorry

"Xever mind, now, so you are safely

"Iluth, my oe ii Mary let me introduce

Mary had dropped his r.rui, and stood

highly exciting gubernatorial canvass, had
inllueuccd him to prepare his criticism on
my conduct, it is not for me to determine.
At what period did Gen. cott obtain
the - six hundred recruits to which he re
fers in his rejoinder ' This was certainly
after the date of his "views," cn the f-Oth
October, lSGO ; because in thci c he states
emphatically that the forcer, then at his i
co 'Julian d we-e iu all five comna.nies only
"dthhi reach to garrison or reinforce the
nine forts' mentioned in the "views."
Diu he obtain these recruits in Novem
ber ? If so, had he visited Washington
or written and explained to me in what
manner this military operation could be
accomplished by the. four hundred men in
the five companies and the six hundred
recruits, I should have given hi.j repre
sentations all the consideration cniiucutly
due his high military reputation.
Iiiit he informs us he did not arrive in
Washington until the 1'Jth of December.
His second recommendation to garrison
these forts must consequently have been
made, according to his own statement, ou
the lth, 15th, 28th, or aOth of Decem
ber, cr on mote than one of these das.
! At this period the- aspect of publis affairs
had greatly changed from what it was iu
October. Congress was iiow in session,
and our relations with the Seceding Cot
ton States had been placed before them
by the President's message. Proceedings
had ben instituted by that body with a
view to a compromise cf the dangerous
questions between the North and the
South; a:?d the highest hopes and' warm
est aspirations were theu entertained for
their success. Under these circumstances
it was the President's duty to take a broad

and commercial, as well as military, giv

But it seeUiS from the rejoinder that
Secretary l'loyd.at 1 iehmond, had claimed
the honor of d.dcating General Scott's
plans and solicitations respecting the
forts, "it being there," says the Genera',
"universally admitted that but for that
victory over me there could have been no
rebellion. " This is, in plain English,
that the secessionists of the cotton States
who have since brought into the field
hundreds cd thouands of undoubtedly
brave oMiers, would have abandoned in
tenor their unlawftd and rebellious de
signs, had Gen. Scott distributed among
their numerous forts four hundred and
eighty men in October, or one thousand
men in December! This requires uu
comment. I have never been aide to ob
tain a copy of the speech cf 31 r. Floyd, at
Richmond, to which I presume Gen. Scott
refers ; but I learned, both at the time and

the second volume of the ileports. of Com- w
mittecs of the l!oue for the sfs ion of.
1SG0-1. This rep)zt aud ih testimony ,
before the committee establish : '
1. That the tioulhern States received- -in
LG0 less instead of more th iu the quo- ,
ta of arms to which they wen. entitled by
law: and that three of them Xorth Car
olina, Mississippi and Kentucky received .
no arms whatever, an A this simply because
they did not ask for them. Well-may
Mr. Stanton have said in the House "that.
there are a good deal of rumors and spec-
illations and 'misapprehensions as to 'tha."1"
true state ot facts in regard to this matter." -
2. Secretary Floj-d, under suspicious cir. 'J
cumstaue.es, du the '111 December, 1800, " i
and but a few days before he hft the De
partment, had without tho knowledge of,
the President, ordered one hundred and.
thirteen (llo) columbiads and eleven (11")
thirty-two poundeis to b(? transported from,
Pittsburg to Ship Island and Galveston," ,
in M ississippi anil Texas. This fact was
brought to the knowledge of the President . '
by a communication fion Pitt-burg; and f
secretary lioic lmmeaiateiy thereafter
countermanded the order ot his predeces-
sor, and the cannon were never sent. Tha
promptitude with which wo acted dieted,
a vote of thanks, dated on the 4 th of Jan-,
uary, 1831, from the Select and Common
Councils of that city "to the President, tho
Attorney General, and the acting Secreta
ry of War," (Mr-Holt ) -
After this fctatcmeut how shall tte ac--
count for the explicit declaration of Gen
eral Scott that accidentally hearing early
in March that under this posthumous
order (that of Mr. Floyd of the ".I'd De
cember) the shipment of these guns had
commenced, I comminreated the fact ta
Secretary Holt, (acting for Secretary ,
Cameron) just"in time to defeat the rob-
bery '! And this is the same Secretary
Jloit who hud countermanded tho "post- .
huniis order" in the previous December.
And, strange to say, these guns, but for tha -alleged
interposition of Gen Scott, were .
about to be sent so late as March Irani tho
Loyal States into those over which Jeffer
son Davis had theu for soma time pre
sided !
. Had Gen. Scott reHectel for a moment
he could not have fallen into this blunder.
It s quite manifest he was without a
printed document and my (his) own oSi-
cial papers. .
o. The Government had on hand in tha
year 1850 about 500,000 old muskets,
which were condemned as unsuitable for
public service, under the act of b!d of March,
lSl!5. They were., of such a character
that, although olL-red both at public and
private Mile for $2,50 each, purchasers
could not be obtained af that rate, except
for a comparatively small number. On
the OOtli of Xovcu.bcr, 18 .", Secretary
Floyd ordered about one-fifth of the wholo
number (105,(.".'0) to be tent fVcm tha
Springfield armory, where they had accu
mulated, to five Southern arsenals, "in
proportion to their respective means of
proper storage."
This order was. carried into effect by
the Ordnance Bureau in the usual courso
of administration and without refjiunco
to the President. It is but justice to say
that from the testimony before the com
mittee there is no reason to suspect that
Secretary Floyd issued this order from any
sinister motive. Its date v:3 months be
fore Mr. Lincoln's nc;-jiuatiou for tho
Presidency, and nearly a year before his
electiou, aud w hilst the Secretary was still
uu avowed opponent of secession. Indeed
the testimony of Colonel Craig and .Capt.
Maynadier, vt the Ordnance, before tha
committee is wholly lneonsiSterH wita any
evil intention on l is part.
. And yet these 'condemned muskets,"
with a few thousand ancient rides of a
calibre then no longer used, are transfor-
