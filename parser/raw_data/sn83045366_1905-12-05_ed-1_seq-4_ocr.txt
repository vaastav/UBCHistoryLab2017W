The President's Message.
The president's message, which will
he read to congress today, is the longest
Mr. Roosevelt as written, yet it is an
interesting document thruout. The
president has not been satisfied to make
It a depository of dry facts or per
functory recommendations, but has
fcreathed into it the philosophy of life
a nd living which are so much a part of
Iris public side. The first column of the
president's message, for example, is
%aken up with a discussion of the condi
tions of prosperity, which goes far
afield and comes back with the conclu
sion that the square-dealing man must
be afforded a square deal. If the cor
porations will not give it to their cus
tomers and their rivals voluntarily, then
the government by regulation must help
them.
There is little new in the president's
talk on he rate question except th at
he emphasizes something which has not
been generally discussed, and that is
the great preponderance of negation in
our supervisory statutes with reference
to corporations. They are full of "Thou
shalt nots" which have fallen far short
of accomplishing what .they are in
tended to bring about because when the
corporations, which did not want to be
fair, found themselves stopped from do
ing a wrong one way, they simply went
another way about it. The proposal to
give the interstate commission the
power to fix a rate and put it in force
is the first affirmative step in support
of the sovereignty of the state over the
giant corporations which the govern
ment as attempted to take. In this
way it differs radically from what has
been attempted in the past. The presi
dent recognizes this fact, and while he
justifies the step, declares that it is not
taken in heat against corporations, but
in the interest of the fair-dealing rail
road, which is now the vict im of he
crooked organization, and of the hon
est shipper, who is ow at the mercy of
the fellow with the rebate in his pocket.
The president's discussion of the San
^Domingo treaty is the clearest and most
instructive statement of the reasons
governing that important action, which
has yet appeared. I should go a great
,way toward removing misunderstanding
jand securing the confirmation of the
treaty. Conditions in San Domingo,
ifche president says, had gone from ad
to worse until the dissolution of society
iwas threatened. In this situation the
government of the island appealed to
this government. arrangement
ifche island government appointed
[Americans to preside over he
fcuetom houses. These Americans have
given such a good account of their
trusteeship that the island government
las realized more revenue out of he 45
[per cent awarded it than it formerly got
out of 100 per cent, and 55 per cent is
deposited ready to apply on the debts
as soon as the treaty is confirmed. The
Elresident
plainly says that if the treaty
rejected ehao3 will come in the island
and that we may have to intervene at
too distant day in a more disagreeable
snanner th an at present.
Under he course taken peace and
prosperity have returned to the island,
foreign intervention has been suspended
a nd the benefits of stable government
have been enjoyed. The course of the
president was about the only one open
to an executive charged by implication
with the enforcement of the Monroe
doctrine, for it must not be forgotten
that while the Monroe doctrine is not on
a statute book, it rises up before the
II president of the United Stat es all the
time. Cleveland met it in Venezuela,
Harrison in Hawaii, Roosevelt in San
Domingo. I any one of them had
failed to prevent foroigto territorial ag
gression, he would have been more se
verely condemned than if he had broken
a domestic law. The president's re
marks on San Domingo will repay peru
sal on tho part of any fellow citizen
who thinks the president has been doing
fmything
ra
I tjyT
or strenuous in the island.
I.^ President Roosevelt is faithful to his
stick philosophy. The failure to
"keep the navy up to standard he would
look upon as unworthy the American
nation. A battleship a year to take the
place of a retired unit he believes to
"fce about right. Then there must be
additions from ti me tp time of fleet
co\itBhips, torpedo boats a nd subma-
lines. The president, however, lays hia
emphasis upon battleships, and battle
ships, it is evident, are going to be
built greater and greater, until some
authority declares the limit has been
reached. But the president's program
of simply replacing the units of he
present navy with effective and up-to
date bits of naval strength is reason
able and moderate.
The president has treated he immi
gration question in a manner which can
not but appeal to he Chinese govern
ment as bei ng fair and impartial. The
exclusion of Chinese laborers is insisted
upon, but this is not the point of com
plaint with China, and he president's
fairness and his determination to treat
he Chinese with equity is so evident
that he Chinese government cannot
but be impressed with he fact that here
is one foreign ruler who is on the
square.
So far as immigration is concerned
he president makes two or three sug
gestions, one of whi ch is that of an in
ternational conference upon the subject.
is clear that the country still has
room for immigrants of the good kind,
but ow to get them is a difficult prob
lem, tho not so difficult as the problem
how to shut out the undesirable immi
grant.
The president makes an earnest plea
for a delegate in congress from Alaska.
The interests of the country demand im
peratively that some one conversant
with the needs of the territory should
be at hand to inform congress on what
it is necessary to do. I would seem as
tho it would be a difficult thing at the
present time to elect a delegate from
Alaska, but the president does not insist
upon this, all he insists upon is that
there shall be a mail' at the elbow of
congress who knows he situation in
Alaska. This seems nothing but reason
able and fair.
A a remedy for the evil of conflict
ing, ineffective yet burdensome regu
lation, the president says that there
has been for some yea rs a demand for
federal supervision of insurance. This
may be doubted. The question is hard
as old as the president believes, and
it has not become an acute question
nationally yet. While it is true that
the state department has for a good
many years carried on negotiations
with foreign countries with reference
to the rights of certain American in
surance companies doing business
abroad, the intervention of he state
department was not a claim or admis
sion of the national character of the
business. It was very much such nego
tiation as the department might and
would undertake for an individual. I
fact, the insurance companies were of
ten in the case of Miss Ellen Stone,
they were kidnapped and had to be
ransomed. Federal regulation of insur
ance may come, but it does not appeal
to he people at present as a business
proposition to throw away all that has
been built up in the way of state super
vision and take on a new form of reg
ulation.
The message is eminently one for
calm consideration by oongress. I con
tains the best thought and reflection
of the president, and his advisers no
doubt, on a large number of state
questions. There are so many touched
upon th at their enumeration even is
forbidden. The main topics are the
railroads and foreign problems, but the
president has also offered some sugges
tions in other lines. His report on the
state of the civil service is especially
interesting his advice to congress with
regard to economy should result in con
gress going on a hunt for unnecessary
offices. The president has discovered
where the country is paying a quarter
of a million a year for he purely orna
mental place of landoffice receiver.
Perhaps congress can find "more of he
same kind.
Judge Hamilton, the confidential leg
islative representative of the insurance
companies at Albany, jauntily sends?
word from Paris th at his health is
more important to. im than the insur
ance scandal, and that it will be in
convenient for him just ow to come
over to New York. Not only ineon
venient, but very annoying. Andrew's
first care should be his health. Wh at
if it should suffer?
In Place of the Saloon.
C. M. Stocking, superintendent of the
Union Mission got together last even
ing 150 in eft1
who live in lodginghouses,
nearly ^all of them unmarried and all of
them frequenters of the saloons to a
greater or less extent. asked them
to come into his rooms to talk about a'
substitute for the saloon.
A report of their answers to his ques
tions is given in the local columns and
read in cold type would indicate that
from their sta'n'dpoint there is no sub
stitute for a saloon except another sa
loon. That is to say, nothing furnish
ing the accommodations and comforts
and attractions of the saloon with in
toxicating drinks left out would be of
any special interest to them.
W are satisfied, however, that this is
not a fair interpretation of the senti
ment of he company nor was he com
pany fairly representative of the class
for whom a substitute for the saloon is
proposed. These 150 men were mostly
transients. They belong to what may
be described as our "floati ng popula-
tion." They are not representative
of the men who work in shops and fac
tories, who have regular employment
on the railroads or who constitute the
greater part of the men who frequent
saloons because they enjoy the attrac
tions which it furnishes. There are
thousands of young men employed in
the mills and factories and shops and
on the railroads and in other ways who
live here permanently, who have no
homes, but are he occupants of board
inghouses and the cheaper grade of
hotels which furnish them no place of
rendezvous, no opportunity for social
enjoyment whatever. They are hon
est, intelligent, reliable and useful cit
izens who are permanently identified
with the welfare of the city and ye t,
owing to their circumstances in life,
very ma ny of them do not have access
to or cannot' afford "the social environ-
ment whi ch their nature craves outside
of the always-open door of he saloon.
I is the meeds of this element to
whi ch the substitute for the saloon must
be expected to minister most profitably
and this is not he class which Mr.
Stocking has interrogated. The ques
tion is a large one, one upon which there
is not very much experience to guide,
and it would seem to be the part of wis
dom for those in sympathy with he
idea of providing a substitute, to get
together in some way a nd study the
problem so that ate intelligent and suc
cessful effort may result
Some people are already speculating
on whether Senator Burton, in case he
high court shall affirm his conviction,
will be sufficiently punished by an im
prisonment of six months. I is not

The French government has been ex

ment of troops off the field. The tests
of the machine as to armor resistance
were satisfactory and the offensive op
erations apparently were irresistible.
The British made use of bomb
proof cars in the South African war
but they were of course subiect to the
disadvantage of being confined to a
track. Yet they were of considerable
assistance in getting the infantry with
in striking distance of the enemy. The
military automobile is expected to
sweep into the range of a regiment of
infantry or ev en of cavalry and work
havoc and get out again in an iucredi
blv short time.
The French government is so im
pressed with this new war machine that
it has ordered twenty of them, of thir
horsepower each. There seems to be
no reason why the automobile should
not be as deadly in war as it has
proved itself in peace.

Mr. Bowies' Insurance Experi
ence.
Some facts have recently be en made
public whi ch go to show that he trus
tees of the Mutual did well to get rid
of McCurdy. The late president of he
Mutual has evidently known what he
was doing for several yeais and has
kno wn that what he was doing was not
straight insurance business.
I 1902 Thomas H. Bowles, one of his
own agents, at McCurdy's request made
a report upon some flaws in the man
agement. evidently found some, for
between he interview, when he read
his report to McCurdy, and the next
day, the agent received his discharge
handed him by a bellboy of the hotel
in which he was stopping. Ever since
this agent has be en tryi ng to unhorse
McCurdy.
The testimony of this man shows th at
all the familiar methods of bluff were
used upon him. was first treated
with courtesy and encouraged to be
lieve th at he might do something for
the company. When it was discovered
th at he was on he trail of some facts

was discharged, he was. denied access
to McCurdy's office, he was turned
away from the doors of he trustees,
he was attacked in the subservient in
surance press with intimations of
blackmail. was privately offered
a "settlement of his claim" against
the company. Thru it all Mr. Bowles
kept his head and fell into none of the
traps set for him. But it cannot be
said th at he got very far with his in
vestigation. One man fighting so much
money cuts a sorry figure.
he discredited agent, however, has
the satisfaction that upon he third
anniversary of the date of his first
charge McCurdy retired from he presi
dency of the Mutual, very weary and
considerably depressed.
Speaking of W Douglas and Sam

"Both of these men are good men,

whether their virtues are of he ag

manding just now."
I is true that aggressive men seem
to be the idols of the day but do we

left for modesty.

monument, because its" erection would

W think Mr. Henry C. Lea is mis
taken. What Pennsylvania needs above
everything else is a statue of Quay on

get, lest we forget."
Pennsylvania has done very well in
throwing off the "yoke of Quayism,
but it should allow no opportunity for
it to refasten itself upon the necks of
the people. The monument to Quay
would serve to keep ever fresh in the
minds of the voters the great disaster
from whi ch they were rescued. Put

Metropolitan"The Yankee Consul."
'The contrast between Anglo-American
and Latin-American ways furnishes the
basis for most of the fun in "The
yankee Consul," which is now on Its
second visit here. Santo Domingo is the
scene, but there isn't a negro in sight
at any time and the action might just
as well take place anywhere south of
New Orleans. The Yankee, who has been
banished to a consular position with a
remittance as long as he stays at his
idle post, is the central figure and the
action revolves about his wooing of a
large senora with half a million and no
husband, who thus offers escape from
manana land. There is, of course, a revo
lution rumbling beneath the surface of
things, just to give the true Latin
American atmosphere. The action, such
as there is, drags along in true Spanish
fashion, thus lending more verisimilitude
if less interest te the picture. The lines,
however, are original and funny. The
humor is of the. quiet, Intellectual kind,
with few uproarious moments.
It was Raymond Hitchcock with his
inimitable Yankee drawl who first illu
mined the role of the consul, which is
now in the hands of Harry Short. The
new comedian, of course, suffers from Che
memory of Hitchcock's Impersonation,
which in a way fixed the standard of the
character. But he has,' nevertheless,
worked out his own ideal of the exiled
inebriate, and one is bound to admit that
it is a consistent, well-sustained piece
of work infused with rare humor. L. B.
Jefferson furnishes a vapid and colorless
brand of Teutonic comedy as secretary
to the governor, who Is impersonated in
blustering fashion by George Shields.
Joseph M. Ratlin* is the revolutionary
leader with an excellent military swagger
and a fine, strong barytone voice. Hairy
Davies furnishes the inevitable American
naval officer with a pretty tenor voice
and an Impassioned style of love-making.
Alice Hosmer plays the large, wealthy
widow with infectious relish. There is an
inexhaustible fund of fun in the passe
but flirtatious widow and Miss Hosmer
draws upon it constantly. Mae Botlt, a
dainty mite of a girl, plays the widow's
Bella Trenchar is the coquettish daughter
of the Widow, somewhat lacking in allure
ment.
The numerous tuneful ditties with
which the libretto is decked out are sung
in good style by the principals and the
small but select chorus. Of these, "My
San Domingo Maid," "In the Days of
Old" and "Ain't It Funny What a Dif
ference Just a Few Hours Make" called
for the largest share of applause. The
last-named musical homil was well sung
by Mr. Short, in spite of the difficulty
he experiences in keeping the key.

LyceumVaudeville.
An Interesting shooting novelty, by
McCrea and Poole, expert rifle shots, is
the Lyceum's headhner this week. Ordi
nary shooters "pale their ineffectual
fires" when compared with these marvels
who defy death every second of their
act. Breaking eleven balls within a half
inch of each others' heads in six seconds
is one of the stunts of these performers.
The boys shoot in military togs,' and
their act Is sensational and picturesque.
Charles and Katherine Gibson present a
brilliant sketch which touches the heart
strings. "The Burglar's Kit" is their
vehicle, a virile little play which teaches
a wholesome lesson. Rhoda Bernard, a
talented Jewess, sings three songs with
good effect Her Hebrew imitations are
true to life and won great favor because
of their' charming fidelity. Walsh and
Ligon, in a comical musical act, show
themselves capable musicians on a dozen
trick instruments. Their act represents
the acme of novelty in odd devices for
making music. The woman, however,
should leave off her facial contortions
after the first minute or two, as they are
not funny thereafter. Clifford and Orth
presented a singing and dancing turn
which is well received, as is Charles S.
Laird in new illustrated songs and bal
lads. The moving pictures illustrating the
touching composition "Everybody Works
but Father," are passing rich
UniqueVaudeville.
There is a lively and interesting vaude
ville bill at the Unique theater this week
which Is seldom equaled at that house,
but its success Is slightly hampered by
the failure of the leading attraction to
make good.
Fontinelle, said to be the greatest me
chanical invention of the age, a walking
dummy run by electricity, fails to arouse
more than ordinary curiosity. If Fonti
nelle is a mechanical device there is
nothing wonderful about It, for thc%tore
windows have shown better ones. If
human, the man has excellent muscular
control, and that is all. Fontinelle is sup
posed to be a mystery, and is, but the
audience doe* not spend nearly so much
time wondering whether it is human or
wax, as in wondering why the thing
doesn't do something. It raises its hands
in a jerky fashion and walks with stiff,
legs when held by the operator. That's
all there is to Fontinelle. The figure
writes the name on the blackboard, but
that part, if mechanical, Is not so diffi
cult to accomplish.
There are many excellent attractions
in the bill, the Two James taking the
lead with their refined musical act Both
are good musicians and show good taste
in their selections. Byron and Blanche

in Sympathy with CryMay Bevive
Season-Ticket System.
Football gam es will not be as expen
sive for student rooters* in he future
as they have been in the past if under-
Se
aduate sentiment and the opinion of
undergraduate members of the
board of athletic control at the univers
ity of Minnesota are any indication of
the action whi ch will be taken by the
athletic board.
A the last meeting of the big nine
conference a motion, was passed unani
mously expressing the opinion of the
members of the conference that the
Erice
for admission to collegiate foot
all games should be reduced. Fifty
cents, according to the athletic repre
sentatives of the big western colleges,
should be sufficient. N definite rule
was established and the motion was
merely in the form of a recommenda
tion to the different colleges, but judg
ing from campus sentiment at the uni
versity, the suggestion will be adopted
at Minnesota.
Cheap Seats for Few.
Any reduction in the prices of tick
ets to the games on Northrop field
would be hailed with delight by many
students who are prevented from seeing
the games on account of the high price
of admission. Any student desiring a
seat in the best sections of the stands
has been compelled to take his chance
with the general public and pay he
regular admission ee at the same ti me
The only privilege granted the un
dergraduates has been the right to pur
chase rooter seats in the four corner
sections of the grand stands. These
have been sold at the general admis
sion price, but at the big games of
the year the supply of rooter seats as
never be en sufficient for the demand
and the students have either been com
pelled to stand at the ends of the field
or pay the regular $2 reserved-seat
price.
Want First Choice.
The students argue that the alumni
faculty members and students should
be given first choice of seats, as is 1hc
custom in many of the .institutions of
the country, and that any reduction in
the price of seats should be made pri
marily for the benefit of the universary
undergraduates.
A a result of the agitation for a re
duction in he admission price to foot
ball games, it is possible that the sea
son-ticket system will again be in
stalled at the university. Tickets are
issued admitting to all the home games
of the year and are sold to the Btudents
at reduced rate. This plan was tried
four years ago at the university, but
was abandoned on the plea that not
enough tickets were sold to make the
scheme a success.
JEROME AND LOOIIS
MAKE HEARERS LAUGH
Jerome K. Jerome and Charles, Bat
tell Loomis afforded a pleasant evening
to a good-sized audience at the Unita
rian church last night. The elrtertain
nient took on an informal air, which was
pleasing to both readers and listeners.
This footing of familiarity was estab
lished at the opening of the program
when both of tke gentlemen who had
been selected to introduce the speakers
failed to put in' an appearance. Cer
tainly, the two humorists needed no
more introduction other than the witty
words each spoke in behalf of his asso
ciate and which at once put everybody
at ease, relieving what might otherwise
have proved a very unfortunate situa
tion.
Each reader impressed the audience
as being typical of his country and left
the characteristic stamp of his oWn' na
tionality in tho minds of the hearers.
The humor of both is the gentle good
nature of every-day people and similar
to that entertaining wi t, with occasional
eloquent pathos, which has made the
writings of each so popular.
Mr. Jerome is intensely English. Mr.
Loomis is just as truly American. Each
gave readings relative to his owto peo
ple, the comparison being favorable to
both, and giving a delightful variety to
the program for the audience.
Among Mr. Jerome's selections were
the picture hanging scene from "Three
Men in a Boat," and the tenderly
humorous chapter "Their First Play,''
from "Paul Kerver." Mr. Loomis
read a little Irish sketch with excellent
brogue and gave several other entertain
ing selections.

A novel directory of Commercial club
members has been established by Secre
tary E J. Westlake at the entrance to
the club rooms in the Andrus building.
I is designed as a labor saving device
to assist members to find each other
with ease. A each member enters he
club a peg is placed opposite his name
on a directory board similar to those
used for office buildings. When the
member departs- the peg is removed.
The club ow numbers the limit of
1,100 resident members and the device
will prove a great assistance in finding
whether some member of the club is in
the rooms, without the necessity of
sending a page thru the etetire club, and
a final possibility of missing him. The

TALKS WITH TRAVELERS
"Baltimore's business district has
arisen from its ninety blocks of ashes
more substantial and prosperous than
ever," said A. Mendels at the West
hotel today. Mr. Mendels is the senior
partner of Mendels Brothers of Balti
more, a concern which owns seven fac
tories for he manufacture of ladies'
clothing. The Baltimore factory of the
firm was destroyed in the fire. "Our
factory which burned." continued Mr.
Mendels. "was a building six stories
high, 160 by 40 feet. The factory we
have rebuilt is also six stories, but
each floor considerably larger, 270 by 40
feet. This is but typical of the rebuild
ing of other burned structures. They
are larger, more substantial than be
fore, and strictly modern in every way.
All the burned district, with the ex
ception of a few lots, is now covered
with buildings which are estimated to
have cost $65,000,000, which is, of
course, exclusive of the stocks they
contain.''
Mr. Mendels is a great admirer of
Minneapolis. I don't know of any
city twice the size of Minneapolis
which, in my mind, has made sueh
strides along all lines as it has," said
Mr. Mendels, "and I visit nearly all
the large cities of the country. Our
firm always does a good business here.
All the business houses seem prosperous
and sell a large amount of goods."
Mr. Mendels regretted that perhaps
this would be he last year for some
seasons that he would visit Minneap
olis. Mr. Mendels says, with a happy
smile, that there are prospects of his
breaking the ranks of bachelorhood and
going over to the benedicts before long,
and that thereafter he shall send an
other man out on the annual northwest
trips and himself remain in Baltimore
and enjoy home life he year around.
E* *IL Griggs of Montclalr, N Jf^ a
guest at he Nicollet hotel, says he is
hearing great things in "letters from
home" about the revival meetings
which the Chapman evangelists are
holding in the cities thruout New Jer
sey.
I guess they ure even more success
ful than were he Minneapolis meet
ings, from such information as I re
ceive," he said today. I have not
been able to ascertain this from per
sonal investigation, because I have
been away from home since the New
Jersey campaign by Dr. Chapman and
his associates opened. But there is no
mistaking the news in my letters of the
great revival which is going on. I un
derstand a torchlight procession held
one evening in the streets of Paterson
was a wonderful affair, participated in
by several thousand enthusiasts in sym
pathy with the revival movement. I
will *be home in a few days and shall
take much interest in looking into the
movement.''
A young man at one of he local ho
tels tells a good story on himself and# a
companion, of how, after waiting thir
teen hours for a train at Maple Lake,
Minn., they missed it "bv a drink."
Because of the young man's frankness
in telling the story on himself, his
name is withheld.
"The train should have been at th*
Maple Lake depot at 4:15 p.m.,'" he
said. "At that time I was on han'l
with my friend. W waited and wait
ed. he sun set, the evening advanced
and still no train in sight or word
of it. The long weary hours of tho
night we sat in the depot, getting what
little sleep we could in uncomfortable
seats. Dawn came and still no rnmblov
of wheels in he distance. About 7
o'clock my friend suggested we go
get a drink at he nearest saloon to
warm us up, for we were both coll
and hungry^ I agreed. W got our
drink, and just as we were leaving
the saloon, around the curve came our^
train. W ran, but were not able to get*
on board. W missed our train by a
drink, and ad another long wait be
fore the next one arrived."
DEFENDS UNIVERSITY
President Northrop Deprecates Dickson
Charges of Ungodliness in Institution.
A the "Fellowship" services in the
new Trinity Baptist church last even
lrg, Dr. Cyrus Northrup, president of
the state university, took occasion to de
precate the Dickson charges that he
University of Minnesota is "godless."
Dr. Northrop admitted that it was im
possible to arrange religious services as
a part of the curriculum, but declared
that religious work was denied no pupil
and that, on the contrary, the ministers
of the city held out excellent opportuni
ties for religious work.
"As long as I stand at the head of
the university," said Dr. Northrop in
conclusion, I shall uphold the standard
of Christianity as tho religion th at is to
save the world."
A address "The Church and the*
Neighborhood was delivered by Rev.
Henry Holmes, pastor of the Lowry Hill
Congregational church. Dr. George H.
Bridgman, president of Hamline
university and Dr. C. Hubbard, pas
tor of Andrew Presbyterian church,
were the other speakers.
