j Patrick McCarren of Brooklyn. who

yesterday conversing with the elect, t
I Finally Representative Fighting Fitz j
j Fitzgerald, who Speaker Cannon affec!
tionately calls "the craziest Irishman
j in America," took Pat l?y the arm and
led hiin into l.'nele Joe's cigar-scented
sanctum, where these two astute gentlemen
clutched hands and passed the
time of day. The senator said he felt
like a member of the real Congress,
for lie was down in Washington doing
some department chores for his constituents.

There must have been some telepathic
suggestion to reach the public committee
room where several idle members
were chatting, for suddenly one of

the inner chamber, yanked it open and
yelled in to the executive session
grouch party, "Tiee. I hope the lions
ketch him."
"What did the bunch do?" laughed a
colleague, when the facetious member
had returned to his seat.
"Nothing." lie replied; "they just

Ralph Cameron, who. as a result "f the
recent elections, will succeed Mark Smith
as delegate in the House from Arizona
after the 1th of March, has come to town
| to stay. Yesterday he was around the
I Capitol getting acquainted. Mr. Cameron .
! is rather small and has red cheeks, merry
: blue eyes and a happy smile. Yet he used
; to be sheriff of the most scandalous section 1
I of Arizona, and although that was years
ago. they do say as how mothers scare
bad little children into lieing good just
by saying that Ralph'll git 'em if they 1
don'i watch out. They say that when lie 1
i mice got on the. trail be never quit until
ho had the pursuee. alive or dead. So 1
he is expected to help a lot on th etrall of '

j "I.OST. STRAYED OR STOI.KX-ONK
I'nited States senator, somewhere between
<'olumbia. S. C., and Washington,
L?. C."
<
Such an advertisement would express
liir curiosity that has been manifested '
around the Capitol this week as to the
whereabouts of Senator Tillman. Somei
how or other the Senate doesn't seem
lik?- the same place without Soutli Carolina's
pitchfork and tire-eating statesman i
In his accustomed seat on the center
aisle.
The reason of all this curiosity is that
the newspapers in Columbia announced :
last Monday that lie had left for Washington
to be present at the opening of :
Congress. This report readied his friends
hen-, but thus fur there has been no '
SenaXor Tillman anywhere around 'he
Capitol. Matters reached such a pass
yesterday tna.t people were asking each
other if he hud Ireen taken ill again and
gone to some hospital en route.
Assistant Senate librarian Baker, how- !
ever, was abb* to solve the mystery late
in the afternoon. He got a telegram
from the senator, sent from Fort Hill,
8. ('. Mr. Tillman said ho had just
stopped off to attend a meeting of the
board of directors of the agricultural :
college at that place.
Now, if there is one thing that the
noted South Carolinian is interested in
more than anything else, barring the
official and private arts of President ,
Roosevelt and the rare question, it Is ,
agriculture. So his friends are no longer ; j
anxious. They say if he shows up some
time next month he'll he going some. (
Incidenta'lv It is reported among Mr.
Tillman's friends here that lie has re- ]
gained practically all of the strength he
lust during his severe illness last spring
and will be ready to make some of his j
old-time speeches again this winter.
* | ,
A man walked up most respectfully to j I
the doorkeeper at the entrance to the sen- J
titer's private lobby yesterday and handed . !
' (
in his neatly engraved card, asking that it j
be laketi to Senator So-and-so. i
"Hush!"' whispered the official, dramat- '
icaliy.
"What's the matter?" asked the 1
stranger, with the proper show of excite- '
ment. <
"They're reading the President's message."
1 ;
"Oh." said the stranger in a most sol-'
emu tone.
"You see." vouchsafed the official. "The
senators arc always so deeply interested >
in the communications front the White1
House that they have made it a rule for
years never to allow a card to bo sent in !
to them. It might distract tlfir attenlion
for a moment."
"How appropriate!" whispered the <
stranger aim tiptoe away in the gallery i
j to hear the message for himself. (
As lie entered the ga'lerv he could
scarcely believe his eyes. lie looked all I
around the chamber and there were hardly j ;
more than a dozen senators in their seat.*. \
Half of these were reading the printed j
copies of the message that had been fttr- ' ,
nished th.etn hy the government printing'
office. The other halt were talking and '
laugiiing. Over on the sofas in the cor- i
tiers there were groups of them, and they ' ,
were chatting In a most unconcerned man
nrr. Through the cloakroom doors cnrne
visions of open tiros and b^g ' hairs pulled ;
up in front, and now and tin n a sugges- ' '
tton of mirth. I '
The cle.'k was droning something, the
s'rnnctr couldn't make out just what. ;
There surely must he sonte mistake, he j '
thought, and hastened hack downstairs j
to the doorkeeper. ' '
"It's finished." he w oispered?"the IIP s- :
sage. 1 mean. Will you take my card in .
now?" |j
"Oh. ro." announced the official, "it j'
vti'l !a*' for .Mother hour yet. Yo:i'U

t co loud. You 'night disturb them in
