The lireHtnt JiHUfe.
On Monday laat the Forty-first Con
gress of the United States assembled at
Washington, and on the game, day the
annual message of our Chief Magistrate,
together with the accompanying reports
of the various Departments, wa3 laid be
for that body.
Thejgreat interest that always attaches
to tbese'documcnts, explanatory as they
are of the past, and foreshadowing aa
they do, the future policy of.tlicGovern
ment, has rendered.their publication in
full, a necessity. For this reason we
have devoted so large a portion of our
epace to the message and the synopses of
the Treasurer's and Secretary of War's re
ports s to crowd out a large amount of
the usual reading matter on this page.
We feel certain, however, that this will,
lu view of the Interesting nature of the
communications, meet the wishes and
approbation of our readers, especially as
the Journai. Is the only paper in tins
section which, In addition tothefull text
of the message, presentstbe other reports.
The same lackof space which prevents
the customary comprehensive resume of
the doings of the world as given In
"News of the week," also precludes any
comments upon the many matters con
tained lu these State papers. In many
respects able and satisfactory, in some
slightly vague and meagre, tliey will
nevertheless be read with interest by all.
In our next Issue we shall endeavor to
briDg up in full the news that lias nec
essarily been crowded out of this num
ber. President's Message.
To the Senate and Souse ot Representa
tives :
In addressing my third annual mes
sage to the law making branch of the
(Government, it is gratifying to be able
to state that during the past year suc
cess has generally attended the effort to
execute all the laws found upon the
statute books. The policy has been not
to enquire into the wisdom of the laws
already enacted, but to learn their spirit
and intent aud to enforce them accord
ingly.
THE CAlAMATn OP THE PAST TEA.
The paRt year has, under a wise Prov
dence, been one of general prosperity to
the nation. It has however been atten
ded with more than usual chastisements
in the loss of life and property by storm
and fire. These disasters have served to
call forth the best elements of human
nature in our country and to develop a
friendship for us on the part of foreign
nations, which goes far towards allevia
ting the distresses occasioned by these
calamities. The benevolent who have
ao far generously shared their means
with the victims of the3a misfortunes
will reap the!.- reward in the conscious
ness of having performed a noble act,
and in receiving the grateful thanks of
tnen, women and children, whose suffer
ings they have relieved.
OUR RELATION WITH FOREIGN POWERS.
The relations of the United Statea with
foreign powers continues to be friendly.
The year has been an eventful one in
witnessing two great nations speaking
our language and having one lineage,
settling, by peaceful arbitration, dis
putes of long standing, and liable at any
time to bring those nations into bloody
and hostile conflicts. Au example has
thus been set, which if successful in its
final issue, may be followed by other
civilized nations and be the final means
of returning to productive industry
millions of men now maintained to set
tle the disputes of nations by the bayo
net and the broadsword.
THE TREATY WITH ENGLAND.
I transmit herewith a copy of the trea
ty alluded to, which has been concluded
since the adjournment of Congress with
Her Brltanio Majesty, and a copy of the
l'rotocols of the conferences of the com
missioners by whom it was negotiated.
'1 his treaty provides methods for adjust
ing the questions pending between the
two nations. Various questions are to
bs adjusted by arbitration. I recora
nieiid Congress at an early dny to make
the necessary provision for the tribunal
at Geneva, and for the several Commis
sions on the part of the United States
called for by the treaty. His Majesty,
the King of Italy, the President of Swiss
Confederation, and His Majesty, the
Emperor of Brazil, have each consented
on the joint request of the two powers to
name an arbitrator, for the tribunal at
Geneva, and I have caused my thanks to
te suitable expressed for the readiness
with which the joint request has been
complied by the appointment of gentle
men of experience and learning to
these important positions. His majesty,
the Emperor of Germany, has been
pleased to comply with the joint wish of
th two Governments, and has consent
ed to act as the arbitrator of the dispu
ted water boundary between the United
Sti.tes and Great Britain.
The contracting parties in the Treaty
have undertaken to regard as between
themselves certain principles of public
law for which tiio United States have
contended from the commencement of
their history.. They have also agreed to
bring these principles to the knowledge
of the other maratime powers, and to in
vite them to accede to them. Negotia
tions are going on as to the form of the
note by which the invitation is to be ex
tended to the powers. I recommend the
legislation necessary on the part of the
United States to bring into operation the
articles of the treatv relating to the Fish
cries and to the other matters touching
the relations of tho United States to
wards the British Xorth American pos
sessions, to become operative as soon as
tne proper legislation shall be had on
ti:e part of Great Britain and its posses
. e ions. It is much to be desired that this
, legislation may become co-operative be
fore the fishermen of the United States
bagiu to make their arrangements for
the coming season.
THE NA VIGATION OF THE CANALS.
I have addressed a communication, at
which a copy is transmitted herewith, to
ihe Governors of Xcw York, Pennsyl
vania. Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois
aud Wisconsin, urging upon the govern
ments of those States respectively the
necessary action on their part to cai ry
into effect the object of the nrticle of the
Treaty which contemplates the use of the
canals ou either side, connected with the
navigation of the lakes and rivers, form
ing the boundary iu terms of equity by
the inhabitants of both countries. It Is
hoped that the importance of the object,
.and the benefits to flow therefrom, will
secure tho speedy approval and legisla
tive sanction of the States concerned.
THE FORT y-NIXTIX PARALLEL.
1 renew the recommendation for an
appropriation for dAermiuinz the true
position of the forty-ninth parallel of lat
itude, w here it forms the boundary be
tween the united states ami the British
Xorth American possessions, between
the Lake of the Woods and the summit
of the Kocky Mountains. "The early ac
tion of Congress on this recommenda
tion named would pntjt in power of the
War Department to place a force in the
field during the next summer.
FRAKCK AND GERMANY.
The resumption of diplomatic rela
tions between France and Germany have
enabled mo to give alrecuons tor the
withdrawal of the protection extended
to Germans iu France, by the diplomatic
and consular representatives of the Uni
ted States lu that country. It is just to
add that the delicate duty of this protec
tion has been pcrtormcd by the Minister
and the Consul General at Paris and the
various Consuls in France under tho su
pervisions of the latter with great kind
ness as well as with prudeime and tact.
Their course has received the commen
dation of the German government and
has wounded no susceptibility of the
French. Tho government of the Em
peror of Germany continues to manifest
u friendly feeling .toward the United
Stales and a desire to harmonize with the
moderate ard just policy which this gov
ernment maintains In its relations with
the Asiatic powers, as well as with South
American Republics. I have given as
surance that tho friendly feellnes of that
government are fully shared by the
United Safes,

TEEATY WITH ITAI.T. j
The ratifications of the new Treaty of

RELATIONS WITH SPATS.

ty of the United States to preside over a
conference at Washington between the
Plenipotentiaries of Spain end the allied
South' American Republic, which lias
resulted in an armistice, with the reas
onable assurance of a permanent peace.
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA.
The intimate friendly relations which
have so long existed between the United
Suites and Iiussia continue undisturbed.
The visit of the third son of the Emper
or is a proof that there is no desire on
the part of Ids Government to diminish
the cordiality of those relations. The
hospitable reception which has been giv
en to the Grand Duke is a proof that on
our side we share the wi3he3 of that
Government.
catacazy.
The inexcusable course of the Rusian
minister at Washington rendered it nec
essary to ask his recall, and to decline to
longer receive that functionary as a di
plomatic representative. It was impos
sible with self respect or with a just re
gard to the dignity of the country to per
mit Mr. Catacazy to continue to hold in-
terconse with this government after his
abuse at government officials, and dur
ing his persistent interference through
various means witn tne relations De
tween the United States and other pow
ers. In accordance with my wishes this
government has been relieved of further
intercourse with Mr. Catacazy, and the
management of the affairs of the Imper
ial Eeaation has passed into the hands
of a gentleman entirely unobjectionable.
v JAPAN.
With Japan we continue to maintain
intimate relations. The Cabinet of Mi
kado ha3, since the close of last session
of Congress, selected citizens of the Uni
ted States to serve in offices of import
ance in the several departments of Gov
ernment. I have reason to think that
tins selection is due to an appreciation of
the disinterestedness of the policy which
the United States have preserved to
wards Japan. It is our desire to contin
ue to maintain this disinterestedness and
just policy with China as well as Japan.
The correspondence transmitted here
with shows that there is no disposition
on the part of this Government to"swerve
from its established course.
TTIE TROUBLE WITH THE COREAN8.
Prompted by a desire to put an end to
the barbarous treatment of our ship
wrecked sailors at the Corean coast, I in
structed our Minister at Pekin to endeav
or to conclude a convention with Corea
for securing the safety and humane
treatment of such mariners. Admiral
Rogers was instructed to accompany
him with a sufficient force to protect hith
in case of need.
A small surveying party sent out, on
reaching the coast, was treacherously at
tacked at a disadvantage. Ample oppor
tunity was given for explanation and
apology for the insult. Neither came.
A force was then landed. After an ar
duous march over a rugged and diffi
cult country, the forts from - which ihe
outrages had been committed were gal
lantly assaulted and were destroyed.
Having thus punished the criminals and
having vindicated the honor of the flag,
the expedition returned, finding it im
practicable under the circumstances to
conclude tho desired Convention. I re
spectfully refer to the correspondence
relating thereto herewith submitted, and
leave the subject for such action as Con
gress may see fit to take.
RELATIONS WITH MEXICO.
The Republic of Mexico has not yet
repealed the very objectionable laws es
tablishing what "is known as the "Free
Zone" on the frontier of the United
States. It is hoped that this may yet be
done and also that more stringent meas
ures may be taken by that Republic for
the restraining of lawless persons on its
frontiers. I hope that Mexico, by its
own action, will soon relieve this govern
ment of the difficulties experienced from
these causes.
RELATIONS WITH CENTRAL AND SOUTH
AMERICA.
Our relations with the various Repub
lics of Central and South America con
tinue, with one exception, to be cordial
and friendly. I recommend some action
by Congress regarding the overdue in
stallments under the award of the Venez
uela claims commission of 1896. The in
ternal discussions of this government
present no justification for the absence of
effort to meet their solemn treaty obliga
lions. The ratification of an extradition
reaty with Nicaragua has been exchang
ed. SLA VERT IN BRAZIL AND SPANISH AMERICA.
It is a subject for congratulation that
the great Empire of Brazil has taken the
initiatory steps toward the abolition of
slavery. Our relations with the tmpire,
always cordial, will naturally be made so
by this act. It is not too much to hope
that the government of Brazil may here
after find it for its interest as well as in
trinsically right to advance toward en
tire emancipation more rapidly than the
present act contemplates. The true pros
perity and greatness of a nation is to be
tound in the elevation and education of
its laborers. It is a subject for regret
that the reforms in this direction which
were voluntarily promised by the states
men of Spain have not been carried out
in its West Indian colonies. The laws
and regulations for the apparent abolition
of slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico leave
most of the laborers in bondage with no
hope of release until their lives become
a burden to their employers. I desire to di
rect your attention to the fact that the cit
izens of the United States are large hold
ers In foreign lands of this species of
property lorblduen by the fundamental
law ot tneir alleged country, l recom
mend to Congress to provide by stringent
legislation a suitable remedy against the
holding, owning, or dealing in slaves or
being interested in slave properity in
foreign lands, either aB owners, hirers.
or mortgages by persons of the United
States.
CUBA.
It is to be regretted that the disturbed
condition of the Island of Cuba contin
ues to be a souroe of annoyance and an
xiety. The existance of a protracted
struggle iu such clcse proximity to our
own territory, without apparent prospect
of an early termination, cannot be
other than an object of concern to a peo
ple who, while abstaining from interfer
ence in the affairs of other powers, na
turally desire to see every country in the
undisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty,
and the blessings of free institutions.
Our naval commanders in Cuban waters
have been Instructed, in case it should
become necessary, to spare no effort to
protect the lives and property of bona
tide American citizens and to maintain
the dignity of the flag. It is hoped that
all pending questions with Spain, grow
ing out of the affairs in Cuba, may be
adjusted in the spirit of peace and con
ciliation which has hitherto guided the
two powers in their treatment of such
questions.
DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES TO CHINA
AND JAPAN.
To give Importance and to add to the
efficiency of our diplomatic relations with
Japan and China, and to assist in retain
ing the good opinion of those peoples
and to secure to the United States its
share of the commerce destined to flow
between those nations and the balance
of the commercial .world, I earnestly
recommend that an appropriation be
made to support at least four American
youths in each of these countries to serve
as a part of the official family of our
Ministers there. Our representatives
would not even then be placed upon an
equality with the representatives of Great
Uritian or some of her powers. As now

NATIONAL. DEBT.
j
The National Debt has been reduced to
the extent of eighty-six millions, flfty
seven thousand one hundred and twenty
six dollars and eighty jceuts. during the
year, aud by the negotiation of National
bonds at a lower rate of interest, the in
terest on the I'uhlic Debt lias been so
far diminished that now the sum to be
raised for the interest aceouat U nearly

BtBixTIOX OF TAXti
It a hignly desirable that this rapid
diniiou -Ujuia Uto place both to

utiilirr in meet eve rv- dollar of llubilitv
without bankruntiu;' them, but in view
of the accomplishment of these desirable
ends, of the rapid development of the
resources ot the country, its increajnK
ability to meet large demands, and the
auiountalready paid, it is not desirable
that the present resources 01 tne country
should continue to be taxed in order to
continue this rapid payment. 1 there
fore recommend a mouincation t coin
tne tarifi aud internal tax laws. I rec
ommciid that all taxes from internal
sources be abolished, except those on
spiritous, vinous and maltliquore,and to
bacco in its various forms from stamps. I a
readjusting the tariff, I suggest that a
careful estimate shall be made of the
amount ol surplus revenue collected un
der the present laws, after providingthc
current expenses of the Governineiu,the
interest account and a sinking fund, and
that this surplus be reduced in such man
ner as to afford the greatest relief to the
exeatest number. There are many arti
cles not produced at home, such as medi
cines compounded, Ac, from which very
little revenue i3 derived, but which enter
into general use. All such articles I rec
ommend to be placed ou the free list.
Should a further reduction prove advis
able I would then recommend that it be
made up on those articles which can bear
it without disturbing home production
or reducing the wagesof American labor.
I have not entered into figures, lsecause,
to do so would be to repeat all that was
laid before you in the report of the Sec
retary of the Treasury.
COLLECTION OF REVENCES
The present laws for collecting reven
ues pay collectors of customs small sal
aries, but provide for shares in all seiz
ures, which, at principal ports of entry
particularly, raise the compensation of
these officers to a large sum. It has al
ways seemed to me as if this system must
at times work perniciously. It holds out
an inducement to dishonest men, should
such get possession of those offices, to be
lax in their scrutiny of goods entered, to
enable them finally to make large seiz
ures. Your attention is respectfully in
vited to this subject.
THE CURRENCY QUESTION. 1
Continued fluctuations in the value
of Gold, as compared with the National
Currency, has a most damaging effect
upon the increase and development of
the country, in keeping up prices of all
articles necessary in every day life, and
it fosters a spirit of grumbling, prejudi
cial alike to national morals and the na
tional finances. If the question can be
met as to how to get a fixed value to onr
currency, that value constantly and nni
formly approaching par with specie, a
very desirable object will be gained.
THE ARMY. -
For the operations of the army iu the
past year, the expense of maintaining it,
the estimates for the ensuing year, and
for continuing seacoast and other im
provements conducted under the super
vision of the War Department, I refer
yon to the accompanying report of the
Secretary or war. l call your attention
to the provision, of the act of Congress
approved March 3d 1860, which discon
tinues promotions in the staff corps of
the army, until provided for bylaw. I
recommend that the number of officers
in each grade be fixed, and that when
ever the number in any one grade falls
below the number so fixed, that the va
cancy may be filled by promotion from
the grade below. I also recommend that
when the olhce ol chiet ot a corps De-
comes vacant, the place may be filled by
selection from the corps in which the va
cancy exists.
THE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Na
vy shows an improvement in' the num
ber and efficiency of the naval force,
without material increase in the expense
of supporting it, This i3 due to the poli
cy which has been adopted, and is being
extended as fast as our material will ad
mit, of using smaller vessels as cruisers
on the 6cveral stations. Bv these means
we have been enabled to occupy at once
a larger extent of cruising ground, to
visit more frequently tne posts wnere tne
presence of our flag is desirable and gen
erally to discharge more efficiently the
appropriate duties of the Navy in" time
of peace, without exceeding the number
of men or the expenditure authorized by
law. During the past year the Navy hat ,
in addition to its regular service, sup
plied the men and officers for tho vessels
of the Coast Survey, and has completed
the surveys authorized by congress of the
Isthmus of Darian and Tehauhtepcc.snd,
under like authority, has sent out an ex
pedition completely furnished aud equip
ped to explore the unknown ocean of the
North. The suggestions of the report
as to the necessity for increasing and im
proving the material of the Navy and
the plan recommended for reducing the
personal of the service to a peace stand
ard, by the gradual abolition of others,
and the employment of some in the ser- i
vice of the Commercial Marine are well
considered and diaere the thoughtful at- j
tention of Congress. I also recommend i
that all promotions in the Navy above '
the rank of Captain be by selection, in
stead of by seniority. This course will
secure in the higher grades greater effi
ciency and hold out an incentive to
young officers to improve themselves 1n
the knowledge of their profession. - The
present cost of maintaining the Navy,
its cost compared wjtb that of the pre
ceding year and the estimates for the
ensuing year are contained in the accom
panying report of the. Secretary of the
Navy.
THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The enlarged receipts of the Post
Office Department, ks shown by the ac
companying report of the Post Master
General, exhibits a gratifying increase
in that branch of the public service. It
is the index of the growth of educat ion
and the prosperity of the people, two
elements highly conductive to the vigor
and stability of republics. - With a vast
territory like ours, much of it sparsely
populated, and all requiring the service
of the mail, it is not at present to be
expected that tins department can lp
made self-sustaining, but a gradual ap
proach to this end from year to year- is
confidently relied upon, and the day is
not far distant when the Post Office De
partment of the Government will prove
a.Tiuch greater blessing to the whole
people than it is now. The suggestions
of the Post Master General for improve
ments in the department presided over
by him are earnestly recommended to
your special nttention, especially docu
ments favorable to the consideration of
the plan for uniting thetelegrnph system
of the United States with the postal sys
tem. It is believed that by such a course
the cost of telegraphing would be much
reduced, and the service as well, if not
better rendered. It would secure a
further advantage by extending the tele
graph through portions of the country
where private enterprise will not con
struct it. Commerce, trade, and above
all, the efforts to bring a people widely
separated into a community of interests,
are always benefited by a rapid inter
communication. Education, the ground
work of republican institutions, is en
couraged by increasing the facilities to
gather speedy news from all parts of the
country. The desire to reap the benefit
of such improvements will stimulate
education. I refer you to the report of
the Post Master General for full details
of the operations of last year, and for
comparative statements of "results with
formor years. "
THE KU KLUX LAW.

cutive branch of the Government the

of the citizens to control the local author

Amonf their operations -were frequently
acourings of the country and occasional

at night, by disguised persons, the vic
tims, i-n almost all cases, being citizens
of different political sentiment" trom
their own. or free persons who have
shown a disposition to claim equal-rights
with other citizens. Thousands of inof
fensive and well disposed citizens were
the sufferers by this lawless violence.
Thereupon, jon the 13th of October 1-S71,
a proclamation was issued, Hn the terms
of the law, calling upon the members of
the combination to disperse within five
days, and to deliver to the Marshal or
military officers of th United States all
arms, ammunition, disguises and other
means 3iid implements used by them for
carrying out their unlawful purposes,
his warning ot having been heeded,
ou the 17th of Oct. another proclamation
was issued suspending the privilege of
thowrit of habeas corpus m the counties
of that State. Direction was given that
within these counties designated, per
sons supposed, upon creditable infor-
niation, to be members of such unlawful
combinations, should be arrested by the
military force of the United States, and
delivered to the Marshal to be dealt with
according to law. In two of said coun
ties, York and Spartanberg, many ar
rests have been made. At the last ac
count the numlier of persons arrested
was ono hundred and sixty-eight.
Several hundred, whose criminality was
ascertained to be of an inferion degree,
were released tor the present, l nese
have generally made confessions of their
guilt. Great caution has been exercised
in making test arrests, and notwith
standing the large number, it is beli'jved
that no innocent person is novv in cus
tody. The prisoners will be held for
regular trial in the judicial tribunals of
the United States.. As soon as it appear
ed that, the authorities of the United
States were; about to' trdte vigorous
measures to enforce the law, many per
sons absconded and there is good ground
for supposing that all tof such persons
have violated the law. a. run report ot
what has been done under this law will
be submitted to Congress by the Attorney-General.
MATTERS TN UTAH.
In Utah there still remains a remnant
ofbarbarism repugnant to civilization,
to decency and to the laws of the United
States. ' "Territorial officers, however,
have been found who are willing to per
form their duty in a spirit of equity ; and
with a due sense of responsibility iu
maintaining the majesty of the "law.
Neither polygamy, nor any violation of
any of the existing statutes, will be per
mitted within the territory of the Uni
ted States. It is not with the religion of
the self styled saints that we are now
dealing, but their practices. They will
be protected in the worship of God ac
cording to the dictates of their consci
ences, but they will not be permitted to
violate the laws under the cloak of re
ligion. It may be advisable for Congress
to consider what, in the execution of
laws against pologamy, is to be status of
the plural wives and their offsprings.
The propriety of Congress passing an
enabling act authorizing the territorial
legislation of Utah to legitimize all born
prior to a time fixed in the act might be
justified by its humanity to these inno
cent children, This is a suggestion only
and not a recommendation.
TriETJSPIAN POLICY.
The policy pursued towards the Indians
has resulted favorably, so far as can be
judged from the limited timp during
which it has been in operation. -Thro'
the exertions of the various societies of
Christains, to whom have been intrusted
the execution of this policy, and the
Board of 'Commissioners authorized by
the law of April 18th, 18C9, many tribe's
of Indians have been induced to settle
upon reservations, to cultivate the soil
and perform productive labor of various
kinds,and to partially accept civilization.
They are being eared for in such way,
it is hoped, asjto induce those still pursu
ing their- old habits of life to embrace
the only opportunity which is left them
te avoid extermination. I recommend
liberal appropriations to carry on the
Indian peace policy, not only because it
is humane, christian-like, and economi
cal, but because It is right. I recommend
to your favorable consileration also, the
policy of granting a territorial govern
ment to Indians in Indian Territory
west of Arkansas and Missouri and south
of Kansas. In doing so every right
fuaranteed to Indians by treaty should
e secured. Such a course might in
time be th means of collecting most of
the Indians now between the Missouri
and the Pacific and south ol the British
possessions, into one territory or one
state. The Secretary of the Interior has
treated upon this subject at length and I
recommend to you his suggestions. .-
THE PUBLIC LANDS.
I reuew my recommendations that the
Public Lands be regarded as a heritage
to our children to be dispostd of only as
required for occupation and to actual
settlers. Those already granted have
Deen in great part disposed ot in such a
way as to secure access to the balance
by "the hardy settlers who may avail
himself of them. But caution should be
exercised even in attaining so desirable
an object. Educational interest may
well be served by the grant of the pro
ceeds of the sale of public lands to set
tlers. I do not wish to be understood as
recommending in the least degree a cur
tailment of what is being done by the
general government for the encourage
ment of education. The report of the
Secrelary of the Interior, submitted with
this, will give you information collected
and prepared for publication in regard
to the census taken during the yt ar 1S70,
the operations of the Bureau 6f Educa
tion for the year, of the office, the
pension office, the laud office and the
Indian Bureau.
THE AGRICULTURAL BEPARTMEST.
The report of the Commisskner of
Agriculture gives the operations oi his
Department for tiie year. As agrii ultui
is the ground work of our prosperity, too
much i in poit nice cannot be attached to
the labors of this Department. It is in
the hands of an able head, with able as
sistants, all zealously devoted to intro
ducing into the agricultural productions
of the nation all useful products adapted
to any of the various climates and soils
of our vast territory and to gi-e all use
ful information as to the method of cul
tivating tho plants and sereals and other
products, adapted to particular localities.
Quietly, but. surely the Agricultural Bu
reau is working a" great national good,
and if liberally supported the more wide
ly its influence will be extended and the
less dependent we shall be upon the pro
ducts of foreign countries.
INCHEASED PAY TO OFFICIALS.
The subject of eompensation (to the
heads of bureaus, and to the officials
holding positions of responsibility and
requiring ability and character "to lit
them properly, is one to which your at
tention is invited. But few of the offi
cials receive a compensation equal to the
respectable support of a family, while
their dnties arc such as to involve mil
lions of dollars of interest. In private
life services demand compensation equal
tothe services rendered, and a wise econ
omy would dictate thc;samerule in the
Government service.

the

CONDITIO OF SOUTHEBX STATES.
The condition of the Southern Slates is
unhappily iiot such as all true patriotic
citizens would like to see. Social os:ra-
eisui for opinions sake, personal violence
or threats towards persons entertaining
political views opposed to those enter
tained by the majority of the old citizens
prevents immigration, and the flow of
much needed capital into the Suites late
ly in rebellion. It will be a happy con
dition of the country when the old citi
zens of these States will take an interest
in public atj'airs, promulgate an idea
honestly entertained, vote for men rep
resenting their views aud permit the
same freedom of expression aud ballot
in those entertaining different political
convictions.
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Under the provisions of the act of Con
gress approved February twenty-first
1871, a territorial government was or
ganized in the District of Columbia. Its
results have thus far lully realized tne
expectations of its advocates. Under the
direction of the territorial officers a sys
tem of improvements has been inangu-;
rated by means of which Washington is
rapidly Tiei-oniing a city worthy of the
Nation's capital. The citizens of the
District having voluntarily taxed them
selves to a large amount, for the purpose
of contributing to the adornment of the
seat of government, I recommend lib
eral appropriation on the part of Con
gress in order that the Government may
bear its just share of the expense of car
rying out a judicious system of improve
ments. PUBLIC BUILDINGS IK CHICAGO.
By the great fire in Chicago the most
important of the Government buildings
in that city were consumed. Those
burned had already become inadequate
to the wants of the. Government iu that
growing city and looking to tiie near
future were totally inadequate. I rec
ommend, therefore, that an appropria
tion be made immediately to purchase the
remainder of the square ou which the
burned buildings stand, provided it can
be purchased at a fair valuation, and pro
vided the legislature of Illinois will pas3
a law authorizing its condemnation for
the Government purpose, andalso an ap
propriation of as much money as can
properly be expended toward the erec
tion of new buildings during this fiscal
year.
IMMIGRATION MATTERS.
The number of immigrants ignorant
of our laws and habits and coming into
our country annually has become so great
and the impositions practiced upon them
so numerous and flagrant that 1 suggest
Congressional action for their protection.
It seems to me a fair subject of legislation
ty Congress, i cannot now state as 1 uliy
as I desire the nature of complaints made
by immigrants of the treatment they re
ceive, but will endeavor to do so during
the session of Congress, particularly if
the subject should receive your attention.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
It has been the aim of the administra
tion to enforce honesty aud efficiency in
all public offices. Every public servant
who has violated the trust placed in him
has been proceeded against with all the
vigor of the law. If bad men have se
cured places it has been the fault of the
system established by law and custom
for making appointments, or the fault of
those who recommend for goverment
positions persons that are not sufficiently
well known to them personally, or who
give letters endorsing the character of
office seekers without proper sense of the
grave responsibility which such a course
devolves tin them. A civil service reform
which can correct this abuse is much de
sired. In mercantile pursuits the busi
ness men who give a letter of recommen
dation to a friend to enable him to obtain
credit from a stranger is regarded a3
morally responsible for the integrity of
his friend, and his ability to meet Ui3 obli
gations. A reformatory law which
would enforce this principle against all
endorsers of .persons for public place,
would insure great caution in making
recommendations. A salutary lesson
has been taught the careless and dishon
est servants in the great number of pros
ecutions and convictions of the last two
years. It is gratifying to notice the fa
vorable change which is taking place
throughout the country in briuging to
punishment those who have proved re
crant to the trust confided to them, and
in elevating to public office none but
those who possess the confidence of the
honest aud virtuous, who, it will always
he found comprise the majority ot the
community in which they live. In my
message to Congress one "year ago I ur
gently recommended a reform in the
Civil Service of the country. In con
formity with that recommendation, Con
gress, "in the ninth section of an act
making au appropriation for sundry civil
expenses of the Government, and for
other purposes, approved March the 3rd,
1871, gave the necessary authority to the
Executive to inaugurate a civil service
reform, and placed upon him the re
sponsibility of doing so. Under authority
of said act I convened a board of gentle
men eminently qualified for the work, to
devise rules and regulations to effect the
needed reform. Their labors are not yet
completed, but it is believed that they
will succeed in devising a plan which can
be adopted to the great relief of the Ex
ecutive, the heads of departments and
members of Congress, and which will
redound tothe true interest of the public
service. At all events the experiment
shall have a fair trial.
CONCLUSION.
I have Urns hastily summed up thcop
erationsof the Government during the
last year, and made such suggestions as
occur to hie to be proper for your consid
eration. I submit them with a con
fidence that your combined action will
bo wise statesmanlike, and lu the best
interest of the whole country.

Synopsis of the Treasur
ers Report.
The Kcport of tle .Secretary of the
Treasury is a voluminous documents
whose length renders its insertion en
tire, impossible. The following, howev
er, embraces all the principle points of
interest contained in it:
The country has been prosperous du
ring the year how closing and the public
finances have shared in the general pros
perity during tho fiscal year ending
June 30, 1S71. The reduction of the
public debt was $94,327,764.8!. The to
tal decrease in the public debt from
March 1, 1S09, to December 1, 1S71, was
$.277,211,892.10, and during the same
period the interest has been reduced
$10,741,430.01. Tho revenue for the year
1871 and the reccips since the first of July
laet shows that Ihe time has arrived
when a considerable reduction iu taxes
can be made and yet leave the govern
ment in a position to pay fifty millions
of dollars annually of the principal of
the debt, including the amount pledged
through the sinking fund. Iu Ids annu
al report to Congress for 1870, Ihe Secre
tary expressed the opinion that the set
tled policy of the country should contcm-
l plate revenue sufficient to meet the
ordinary expenses of the government,
pay the interest on the public debt, and
from twenty-five to fifty millions of dol
lars of the principal annually. To that
opinion he still adheres and even a
stronger conviction. The payment an

it is yet more desirable to maintain the

A comparison oi tne nrsc six moiuns
of the calendar of the year 1871 with the
first six mouths of the calendar of the
year 1870, shows an increase of fifty-five
per cent, in the quantity of tea imported ;
twenty per cent, in the" quantity of cof
fee ; lii ty-three per cent, in the quantity
of brown sugar ; one hundred and twen
ty per cent, in the quantity of pig iron ;
one hundred and eighty-six per cent, iu
the quantity of medals : one hundred and
thirty-nine percent, in the quantity of
spices; aud a large increase in uia-iy
other article. The probabilities are
that the customs revenues for the current
year will exceed that for the year 1S71-2
The receipts for internal revenue were
$143,098,153,63, being $4,048,984.29 less
than the estimates presented to Congress
in December lat for the fiscal year" end
ing June 30, 1S71. The estimates for the
current fiscal year were $120,418,000, and
it is probable "that the receipts will be
equal to the estimates.

9S4,220.01 in all.
In the estimates for the next fiscal
year I have not included in the receipts
the premium on gold which may be sold,
nor in the expenditure the premium
w-hich may be paid on bonds to be pur
chased in currency.
In view of the continued prosperity of
the nation the Secretary also advises the
reduction of duties upon salt to the ex
tent of fifty per cent; the duty upon
bituminous coal to fifty cents per ton ;the
reduction of the duty on raw hides and
skins, and the removal of all duties from
a large class of articles produced in
other countries which enter into the arts
and manufactures of this country, and
which are now produced in the United
States, and the revenue trom which is
inconsiderable. Such a list, with the
revenue deri veil from each article, is in
course, of preparation and will be sub
mitted to Congress.
The average premium of gold"for the
year ISC8 was 39.54 per cent; for the
year lt?!S9 it was 32.56 percent premium ;
for the year 1S79 itwasl4.S3 per cents,
and for the first eleven mouths of the
year 1S71 it was 12.1 per cent premium.
The value of the paper currency of the
country during the years 1809 and 1870
was apparently appreciated by the in
creased use of "paper money in the South,
but chiefly by the establishment of the
credit of the United States upon a firm
basis. The dill'erenee between the value
of paper money at tho present moment
and its value ou the first of December,
1870, may bo attributed to the latter
cause, and furnishes the best mean which
the country has yet had for ascertaining
the quantity of paper currency which
can be used, and its value kept at par
with gold. The result of this test con
curs with what seems to mo to be the
best opinion unoii the subject; that the
amount of paper money in circulation is
still so great that it cannot be maintain
ed in value at par with coin. There are
two modes of relief; one is to reduce tiie
volumn of currency, as was recommend
ed by tne in my annual report submitted
to Congress, December, 1809; the other
mode is to await the growth of the
eountry and the increasing demands of
business, which in time will produce the
dc.dred result.
The Secretary also calls the attention
of Congress to "the importance of abol
ishing the system of shares in molieties,
as far as the benefits to revenue officers
and other persons officially connected
with tho Government, ar concerned.
The Government ought to pay fair sala
ries and rely upon the good faith of its
officers for" tho performance of their
duty. One of the difficulties which the

Under an act ' of Congress approved
July 30th, 1870, Dr. John M. Wo3dworth
lias been appointed Supervising Surgeon
of the Marine Hospital Service.! His ad
ministration is satisfactory to the depart
ment. The average number of hospital
patients for the fiscal year ending Juue
30th, 1870, was 1,016, and for the year
ending Juue 30th, 1871,1,138. The to
tal cost of the service for the first named
ye:ir was $405,024, being an average for
each patient of $1,09 per day, and for the
latter year $453,082 42, or an average of
$1,04 per day. In the first named year
the hospital tax was $168,193, 70, and in
the latter year it amounted to $293,502 14.
The Revenue Marine seiv.ee employs
twenty-five steam vessels and eight sail
ing vessels. In addition to these there
are two large steamers upon the lakes
notiu commission, and two schooners
upon the coast condemned as not lit for
duty. Ot the six large steamers upon
the lakes four only are in commission.
D uring, the last vear four iron steamers
have been built, three of 250 and one of
350 tons burden. Under the existing ap
propriation of $200,000, the Department
is about to issue proposals for four small
iron propellers, two for the Pacific, aud
two tor the Atlantic ocean. The expenses
of the revenue marine service for the
year ending June 30, 1871, were $1,251,
984,52, against $1,133,393,31 for the pre
ceding vear. ihe itrst quarter ot the
present fiscal year shews a reduction in
expenses of $23,201,42, as compared with
the corresponding period ol tne proceed
ing year.
On the 28th of February last, public
notice was given that on the 6th of 'the
following mouth, books would be opened
in this country and in Europe for snb-;
scriptious to the national loan under the
act approved July 14, 1870, and the con
ditions on which the subscriptions would
be received were also made known. -A
large number of bankers, both iu this
country and in Europe,' were authorized
to receive subscriptions. Tho first pre
ference was given to subscribers to the
five per cent, bonds within the limits of
$200,000,000. On the first of August the
subscriptions amounted to $65,775,550,
chiefly by the national banks. Under
date of July 14, 1871, a dispatch was re
ceived from Hon. William A.. Richard
son, assistant Secretary of the Treasury,
then in London, stating that certain
bankers in Europe proposed to take the
remainder of the $200,000,000 of five per
cent, upon certain conditions. This pro
position was considered and modified, and
early in August an agreement made with
Jay Cooke & Co., representing bankers
in Europe and the United States By the
terms of the agreement the parties repre
sented by Messrs. Jay Cooke & Co.. had
the right to subscribe for the remainder
of the $200,000,000 of the paid bonds by
giving notice thereof at any time pre
vious to the first of April next, by sub
scribing for $10,000,000 at once, aud for
an average of at least $5,000,000 of bonds
per month during the intervening time,
subject to the right of National Banks to
subscribe for $50,000,000 within sixty
days from tiie 25th day of August. - It
was also agreed that the - subscriptions
should all be made through -National
Banks, and certificates of deposit . be
therefore issued by said banks to the .Sec
retary of the Treasury; the bouds to- be
lodged with the Treasurer of the Com
pany for the amount of the deposit, i By
a printed circular issued on the lOtU of
August, 1871, it was announced that Na
tional Banks making or obtaining sub
scriptions payable in coin would be de
signated by the Secretary of the Treas
ury as depositories of public money on
the usual conditions of placing in the
hands of the Treasurer of the Uunted
States bonds of the United States for se
curity of such deposits, and that at the
commencement of each month notice be
given of the redemption of an amount
of bonds equal to the amount of subscrip
tions in coin tor the preceeding month,
interest to cease in ninety days from the
date of such notice.: It was" also stated
in the circular that as the bonds called
should mature the deposits 'would be
drawn from the several banks proportion
ately. It was further agreed that sub
scribers to the loan should receive as
commissions whatever might remain of
one half of one per cent, allowed by law
upon the $200,000,000, after paying the
cost of paper for the honds, for engrav
ing, printing, advertising, , delivery and
all other expenses of the same. ' Under
this agreement the books were opened
in this country and Europe, and by the
last of August subscriptions were ob
tained for the entire amount offered. On
the first of September public notice was
given that certain five-twenty bonds to
the amount of $100,000,000 of the issue
of 1862, specified by number as far as
practicable, according to the provisions
of the act of Juiy 14. 1870, would be paid
on tha first of December,- and that the
interest would cease 'at that date. Of
the bonds so called more than $80,000,000
are now in possession of the Department,
of w hich smouut $17,000,000 have been
paid in coin, and the remainder have
been received or deposited in exchange
for the five per cent, bonds. Prior to
September 6 per -cent bonds to the
amount of $02,139,550 had been issued,
and payment made therefor, The work
of delivering the bonds subscribed for at
that date is now going on, and under
such circumstances as to leave no doubt
that the whole business will be continued
in a brief period of time.
Returns for the fiscal years of- 1870-71
show that the Ocean commerce of the
Unitee States is passing rapidly into the
hands of foreign merchants "and . ship
builders. In the year 1860 nearly seventy-one
per cent, of the foreign commerce
of this country was in American ships.
In 1864 it had fallen to forty per cent., in
1808 to fort j'-four percent., and iu 1871
it is reported at less than thirty-eight
per cent. The loss of the shipping' of
the United States is due chiefly to two
causes, first, the destruction of Ameri
can vessels bv rebel cruisers during the
war, and, secondly, the substitution of
iron steamers for tiie transportation of
ireight aud passengers upon the Ocean. in
place of sailing vessels and steamships
built of wood. - When tho war opened
English builders of steamships had ac
quired considerable proficiency, has been
carried to higher perfection. iu Great
Britain than in any other part of the
world. It is stated that the superiority
of British machinery, and knowledge of
the busiucss of British mechanics, give
an advantage over American ship build
ers equal at least to ten per cent, upon
the cost of construction. Tney possess
additional advantages in the cost of la
bor, the cost of iron, coal and other ma
terials, aud in the rate of interest upon
the capital employed, equal to aliout
twenty per cent, more, so that the differ
ence iu favor of Britain ship builders is
at least thirty per cent., lu considering
the means for the restoration of Ocean
commerce, two facts must bo accepted :
First that it is useless to attempt to re
vive it with wooden ships. Second
That iron ships moved by sails cannot
compete with iron ships profiled by
steam. Hence the only practical ques
tions for consideration are these; can
the construction of iron steamships be
established in this country? If so by
what means? The trans-ocean commerce
of the United States would empoly about
six millions of tons of shipping, if each
vessel made but one round voyage in a
year. The value of our exports aud im
ports has already reached the sum of
nearly $l,100,000",00o, and during the
present decade it will exceed $1,500,000,
000 annually. The annual returns for
freight aud passengers are about $100,
000,000. After careful consideration of
the w hole subject, the Secretary says he
is prepared to advise the passage or. a i
law uuruiiie-eni; iu wi-mmis vt uu may
employ in the foreign trade American
built first class steamships, f not less
than two thousand tons burden each, an
annual payment, for the period of five
ynui'g, ef lli sum of tblrtetut dollars per

Synopsis of the War. De
partment Report.
The following summary give the most
important and interesting tacts contain
ed in the report, by the War Depart
ment, of its operations during the past
year. First iu interest, this- year, is the
essentially new work of the Signal
Corps, better known and appreciated
popularly ,iriiw,....cauier ..Bureau.
Ibis latter work, however, grew
the militarv scaling, to which, duriu
., tha kI r, i..
I and since the-war, the Government has
wisely 'given great attention; and it is
for this reason that it is under the cus
tom of the AVar Office.
- Great progress has been made by the
Signal Office - in the development of the
army signal service, lor which a train
ing-school is liv operation at tort Whip
ple, Va, and it is recommended that the
study be made at West Point, one which
shall enter into the decision of standing.
But the great advance has Deen In the
weather .' reports, 'the transmission
(from 24 stations) and publication of
which was first put in practice Nov. 1,
1870. The issue of synopses and proba
bilities three times a day has been con
tinued since February 20, and, through
tne press. 16,000,000 copies have been laid
before the public. Of the probabilities 69
per cent, have been verified by the result,
and 21 per cent, in addition partially
verified, strikingly showing the useful
ness oi tne work. But for the haste nec
essitated, the percentage of verifications
tnignc nave oeen tar greater, out reports
uiKeu at an stations at 11 :3o p. m. are
telegraphed to Washington, collated,
and the deductions made are furnished
the press at 1 a. iu. '
. Danger signals are now displayed
from 20 ports on the Atlantic, Gulf and
Lakes. The rise and fall of Western
rivers is also to be reported . hereafter,
and there are 60 stations throughout the
country to extend the 'benefits of this
system to the agricultural community
Doubtless, enough property has been
saved this year by this means to more
than pay the total expenditure for - the
weather service. : ;
The ; quarter-master General reports
that $13,40,025 have been appropriated
ana utsDurseuv uuring tne year, wnile

Bau. ' uuring tne past year the graves
of 2,295 not before reported . have been
discovered,; and the remains . have been

-The Commissary-General's report is
about the same as last year. Purchases
of beef were made in 41 different States
and Territories..; The lowest average
was in lexas, 4j cents per pound, and
the highest : in uemware, lo cents per
pound. Xbe average contract price per
pound or the whole country was 11.09
cents. -The average cost price of rations
for the whole country was 1956-100
cents, each, -being a decrease from, last
year of 1 97-100 cents. . These figures arc
valuable in connection with the gener
al cost ot living,
The Paymaster-General has disbursed
$15,830,901.43 to the array (including
West Point), and $2,683,173.44 to volun
teers for back pay and . bounties. . The

good as last year, the death-rate.- being
17 per 1,000; the proportion of deaths
iroin an causes to cases treated, was one
death to 122 cases ; 8,918 persons have
been, furnished with artificial limbs, or
paid commutations therefor, under Acts
or June 17 and 30, 1870, and 7,887 under
previous acts. The surgical records in
clude 235,398 cases, and the Medical
Museum numbers now 15,018 specimens
Part 1, of the "Medical and Surgical
History ox the war" is near completion
and will be laid before Corigress during
its coming session., there are now 4
vacancies in the medical service, and it
is recommended for the good of the ser
