An a lmtii.n we mill continue to enjoy
a literally unprecedented prosperity;
and it In probable that only reckless
speculation anil disregard of' legitimate
business methods on the part of the
business world can materially mar this
prosperity.

more good work of Importance than the

and checks In payment of them drawn

of the law, la my opinion. In Ha essen
tial nature, is a very much more hein
ous net than the ordinary common, vul
gar crimes which come before criminal
courts constantly for punishment and
whlchi arise from sudden passion or
temptation. This crime in this case Was!
committed by men of education and of
large business experience, whoso stand- 1

LYNCHING.
In connection with the delays of the
law. I call your attention and the atten
tion of the nation to the prevalence of
crime among us. and above all to the
epidemic of lynching and mop violence
that spring up. now In one part of our
country, now In another. Kuch section,
north, south, east, or west, bus Its own
faults; no section can with wisdom
spend Its time jeering at the faults of
another section; It should lie busy try
ing to amend its own shortcomings. To
riiiil with the crime of corruption It Is
necessary to have an awakened public
ronscience. and to supplement this by
whatever legislation will add speed and
certainty In the execution of the law.
When we deal with lynching even more
Is necessary. A great many white men
are lynched, but the crime Is peculiarly
frequent In rcsnect to black men. The

the congress u bo "unconstitutional.'' I
ami then to deny to the government the
right to have the supreme court deii
nitely decide the question.
It is well to recollect that the real ef.
Ililcncy of the law often depends not
upon the passage of acts as to which
there is great public excitement, but
Ui, m tne passage ot acts tit this nature necessary
aa to which there is not much public
excitement, Im-cuuho there Is little public
understanding of their Importance,
while the interested parties are keenly
alive to the desirability of defeating
them. The importance of enacting Into
law the particular bill in question is
further increased by the fact that the
government bus now definitely begun a
pulley of resorting to the criminal law
in those trust and Interstate commerce
cases where such a course offer a reas
onable chance of success. At first, as
was proper, every ePort was made to
enforce these laws by civil proceedings;
but it bus become increasingly evident
that the action of the government in fin

take criminal proceedings was Justifi

spicuous failures In these cams, we have
that etli-ct w Ul lie entered In this case.
SETTING ASIDE OF JUDGMENTS
AND GRANTING OF NEW TRIALS
Tu connection with this matter. I
would like to cull attention to the very
unsatisfactory state of our criminal law.
resulting in large part from the habit
of setting asifle the Judgments- of infer
ior courts on technicalities absolutely
unconnected with the merits of the
case, and where there is no' attempt to
show that there has been any failure of
substantial Justice. It would be well to
enact a law providing something to the
effect that:
No Judgment shall lie set ssiiie r new
trial granted In uny cause, civil or crim
inal, on the ground of misdirection of
the jury or the Improper admission or
rejection of evidence, or for error as to

regard public sentiment when it is
wrong, who brushes sslde tne pica of
any special interest when the pleading
is not founded on righteousness., per
forms the highest service to the coun
try. Such a Judge is deserving of all
honor; and all honor can not lie paid to
this wise and fearless judge If we per
mit tlie growth of an absurd convention
which would forbid uny criticism ot the

injustice, or who In his capacity us a
