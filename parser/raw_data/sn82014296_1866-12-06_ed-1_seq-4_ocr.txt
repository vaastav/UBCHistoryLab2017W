Mr.' Johnson's last communication
to Congress demonstrates not only
that we have a, Bdurbonanxongst us,
but ,.by a..: strange.', turn',; of fortune,
he, occupies ( the : Presided tiai," chair.
The. whole document shows that he
has' learned nothing and forgotten
ribthing. ,We are,' again . nauseated
with hia, stale, and , unprovable italkri
about my "restoration - policy," nof
withstanding the people have " said
very; emphatically, that . they fdid'nt
like it,nd would have Jnone 'ibf it.

what he had done for the restoration

says; the President, "vthe ; J3 ecutive
next found that it had 'aocomplished,
nearly -all that was ;. within the scope ;
.ijf'Jjtt 'constitutional authority.!!.! A
large majority of the "people have been:
unable to ' leat-n , where -the - Presi
dent ;' found-' ' " conis'titutioqaLi ! au:
thority " for what he did do. Where
does the' Constitution authorize, the
appointment of Provisional Govern
orsr .j In j what - article -.: and., section
does it' convey power to' the Execu
tive to. dictate; to State Cohyentipns
and Legislatures the kind of action
they must take upon disputed qucsv
tions?. . Itis very certain the Presi
dent had exhausted his constitution
al authority long before the assem
bling of the Thirty-Ninth Congress,
and had it been in hia power he would
have gone' farther. Fortunately for
the country, another power had ' con
stitutional authority," at this jun6-.
ture, and rebels are not legislating for.
loyal men this winter, ", ; ' , ' , .''.
The President deems it "a subject
of profound regret that Congress has
thus far failed, to admit to fieats the
loyal . Senatort I and . Representatives
from the other Slates, whose inhabit
ants,, with those of Tennessee, had
engaged in; rebellion."; sThat they
have not been admitted is the fault of
' the other States." Tennessee accept
ed the Constitutional Amendment and
was, at once admitted." i The,,. other
States', partly; at '''the'.' instigation of
the President himself, rejected the
Amendment and are still out in the
cold. They may. thank Mri JOHNSON
for it. The language of the Presi
dent indicates that he regards all the
Representatives and Senators elect
from the late rebellious States as loyal'.
The people differ with him materially
on that point.1 The acceptance of the
Constitutional Amendment by those
States will necessitate an entire new
election' ' of ''Congressmen, ' for that
Amendmentj disfranchises nine-tenths
of those bow clamorous for. .'admis

We shall not criticise the Presi
dent's revision of his old argument
in defense of ' my policy." We
heard many better during the cam
