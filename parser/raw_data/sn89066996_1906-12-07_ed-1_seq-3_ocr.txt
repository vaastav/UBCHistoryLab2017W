Many other sul'Jwrts common to ms

prohibiting porpnratloim from ronirlbut-

which would k'v the KOVemment the

this he says;
"Another bill which ban Just pnat ono

Kontly npceysary should be enacted Into

and two defendants sentem-cd to linpri
nnment. Tin- two cas-s referred to may
nut be In real conflict with each other,
but it Is unfortunate That tiu-rc should
fii be an upparent con flirt. At pres
ent then is no way by which the gov
ernment ran cause such a conilut, when
It occurs, to be. solved by alt appi-al to
higher court; and the wheels of justice
nro blocked without any real decision of
the nientlon. I can not lo. strongly
Urge the parage of the bill In question,
A failure to pass will result in vriminly
hampering the government In Us effort
to old ai ii Justice, especjfiUy against
wealthy Individuals nr roi -pom (Ions who
do wrong; and may also prevent t he
jtovernment from obtaining Justin for
wagcwnrlfr who are not lhciri ei
ible effectively to roiitest a rase whero
the Judgment of an Inferior court has
been against them. I have, specifically
In view a remit decision by a district
Judge leaving railway employees with
out remedy lor violation of a certain so
called labor statute. U seems an absurd
ity to permit a single district Judge,
against what may bu the Judgment of
tho Immense majority or his colleagues
on the bench, to declare a law solemnly
mar ted by the congress to be "uncon
stitutional," and t hen to deny to tho
government the right to have tho su
preme court deil u ivly decide the ques
tion." Injunctions.
On the subject of the abolition of In
junctions to labor disputes, he mivs:
"In my last message 1 suggested the en
actment of a law in connection with the
Issuance of Injunctions, at lent tun hav
ing been sharply drawn to the matter 1
by the demand that thn right of applv ,
ttig injunction In labor eax-s should he :
wholly abolished. It l at least douhtrul I
-whether a law abolishing altogether the i
use of Injunctions In mull ruse would
stand the test of the courts; in which
case or course the legislation would he
Ineffective. Moreover, 1 believe It would
be wrong altogether to prohibit the use.
of Injunctions. It is criminal to nermit
nympathy with criminals to weaken mir
bands in upholding the law: and If men
eek to destroy lite nr proerty by mot)
violence there shouni i.e no impairment
of the power of the courts to deal with
them In the most summary and effective
way possible. Hut so fur as possible the
abuse of the power should be provided
against by suine ruch law as 1 advocated
last year.
The Negro Problem.
The negro problem is given considera
ble attention, after calling attention to
the fact that no section of the country
Is frea from faults, and that no section
has occasion to Jeer at the shortcomings
nf any other section, he turns to the sub
ject of lynch logs, and especially as ap
plied to the negro of the south. He says
the greatest existing cause for mob law
Is the perpetration by the blacks of the
crime of rape, a crime which be terms
wven worse than murder. He quotes the
admonitions to the while people spoken
by Gov. Candler, of tieorgiu. some years
ago, and by inv. Jelks, of Alabama, re
cently, and then says:
"Kvery colored man should realize
that the worst enemy of bis race la the
negro criminal, nnd above all the ne-
fro criminal who commits thn drvad
ul crime of rape; nnd It should be felt
a In the highest degree an offense
ngalnst the whole country, nnd against
the colored race In particular, for a
colored man to fall to help the nfllcers
of the law In bunting down with all
possible earnestness and seal t-vcry
mih Infamous offender. Moreover, tn
my Judgment, the crime of rape should
Always be punished with death, an Is
the ease with murder; assault with In
tent to commit rape should be made a
capital crime, at least In the discretion
of the court: and provision should be
made by which t he punishment may
follow Immediately upon the heels of
t lie nffenirc: while the trial should be
ii conducted that the victim need nut
he wantonly shumed white giving; tes
timony, and that the least pons I bio
publicity shall be given to the details.
The members of t he white race on
the other hand should understand that
very lynching represents by just so
much a loosening of the hands of civ
ilization; that the spirit nf lynching
Inevitably throws Into prominence, in
the community all the foul and evil
creatures who dwell therein. No man
i'Hn take part In the torture of a hu
man btdng without having his own
moral nature permanently lowered.
Kvery lynching means Just so much
moral deterioration In all the children
who have any knowledge of It. nnd
therefore just ao much additional
trouble for the next generation of
Americans.
"Lot Justice e both sure and swift;
but let It be justice under the law.
and not the wild und crooked savagery
of a mob.
Capital and Labor.
On the subject of capital and labor
the president takes the agitators of class
hatred to task and says "to preach
hatred to the rich man, as such, . . .
to seek to mislead nnd Inflame to mad- :
ness honest men whose lives are hard '
and who havu not the Kind nf mental I
training which will jermlt them to ap
preciate the danger In the doctrines
preached Is to commit a crime against
the body politic and to be false to every
worthy principle and trnlltlon of Amer
ican nations! life." Continuing on this
subject he says:
"The plain people who think the
luetibanl". Iaro.tr. merchant. wurU-
er with head or nnnfl, the men to
wnom American Traditions are dear,
who love their country nnd try to act
decently by their neighbors, owe It to
themsfdves to remember that tho most
damaging blow that can be given pop
ular government Is to elect an un
worthy and sinister agitator on a
platform of violence nnd hypocrisy,
whenever such n Issue Is raised in
this country nothing can be gained by
flinching from It, for In such case dem
ocracy Is Itself on trial, popular self
Kovernhient under republican forms la
Itself on trial. The triumph of the
mob Is Just as evil a thing; as the tri
umph of the plutocracy, nnd to have
escaped one danger avails nothing;
whatever If we sucuumb to tho other.
In the end the honest man. whether rich
or poor, who earns his own living and
tries to deal Justly by his fellows, has
as much tn fear from the Insincere
and unworthy demagog, promising
much nnd performing nothing, or else
performing nothing but evil, who
would set on the mob to plunder the
rich, as from the crafty corruptionlst.
who, for his own ends, would permit
the common people to he exploited by
the very wealthy. If we ever let this
government fall Into the hands of men
of either of these two clnsses. we shall
show ourselves false to America's past.
Moreover, the demagog and corrup
tionlst often work hand In hand. There
are at this moment wealthy reaction
aries of such obtuse morality that they
regard the public servant who prose
cutes them when they violate the law.
or who seeks to make them bear their
firoper share of the public burdens, as
lelng even more objectionable than
tha violent agitator who hounds on
the mob to plunder the rich. Thuro Is
nothing to chooso between such a re
actionary and such an agitator; funda
mentally they are alike In their hIMni
disregard of the rights of others; and
It Is naturnl that they should join In
opposition to any movement of which
the aim In fearlessly to do exact and
even Justice to nil."
Railroad Employees Hours.
He asks for the passing of the Mil lim
iting the number of hours of
employment of railroad employes, nnd
classes the measure as a very moderate
one. He says the aim of all should t.n
to steadily reduce the number of hours
of labor, with us a goal the general in
troduction of an eight-hour flay, but In
sists that on the Isthmus of Tannum the
conditions nre so different from what
they are here that the Introduction nf an
right-hour day on the canal would be
absurd, and continues, "Just about as ab
surd as It Is. so far as the isthmus is
concerned, where white labor mot be
employed, to bother as to wh't'i.-r t he
work Is done by alien black men or alien
yellow men."
He urges the enact tnent of a drastic
child labor law for the IXstrb't of Co
lumbia and the territories, and a federal
investigation of the subject of child and
female labor throughout the country.
He reviews the work of the commlsNiun
nppolnted to Investigate labor conditions
In the coal fields of l'ennsvlvania In IV".'.
ami refers to the wish of the commission
that ttie state und federal irovcrnment
should provide thu machinery for what
may in called the compulsory Investiga
tion of controversies between eimdoiers
and employes when they urlse."
Control of Corporations.
A ronshb ruble portion of the message
Is devoted to the subject of federal con
trol of corporations In what he refers to
the. passage at the Inst session of the
rate, meat Inspection and food laws, and
says that all of thee have ulrcadv Justi
fied their en. u linen t, but recommends
the amend men i of tho meat n t ion
law o as to put dales on the lai-ls of
meat produ ts. und also to Place the
cost of Inspection on the packers rather
than or. the government. Continuing on
this subject nf tin control of corporations
by the tedcral government he says:
"It cannot too often be repeated t hat ex
perience has conclusively shown the im
possibility of securing by the actions of
nearly half a bundled different state
legislatures unvthing but ineffective
chaos In the way of dealing with the
great corporations which do not operate
I'.islvely within the limits of auv one
state, in some method, whether by a
mttlonnl license law nr in other faslilon.
we must exercise, and that at an early
date, a far moro complete control than
at presunt over these great corpora-
tlons -a control that will among other
things prevent the e Us of exresive
overcapiiulUation, and that will compel
tho disclosures by each big corpnnit ion
of Its stockholders and nf Its properties
and business, whether owned directly or
thru subsiiliarv or nftlltated corporations.
This will lend tit put a slop to the secur
ing of inordinate profits by favored
Individual at t he expeiisn whether of
the general public, the stock In -Idem, or
the wage workers. Our effort should 1m
not so much to prevent consolidation as
such, hut so to nutter vine ami control It
as to see that It results In no harm to I
tho people. 1 he reactionary or ultracon
servative apologists for the misuse of
wealth assail the effort to secure such
control as a step toward socialism. As a
matter of fact It Is these reactionaries
and Ultracouservatlves who art them
selves most potent In increasing socialis
tic i ecu rig. ( me oi fie mom emcient
methods nf averting the Consequences of
a dangerous agitation, which Is M per
cent, wrong, Is to remedy the 20 per cent,
of evil as to which the agitation Is well
founded. The bent way to avert the very
undesirable move for the governmental
ownership of railways Is to secure by
the government on behalf of the people
as a whole such adequate control and
regulation of the groat interstate com
mon carriers as will do aw ay with the
evils v. hlch give rise, to the agitation
ii i. -i t hem. Ho the pro;Mr antidote
lo the dangerous and wicked agitation
against the men of wealth as such Is to
secure by proper legislation and execu
tive action the atmlitlon of the grave
abuses which actually do obtain In con
nection with the business use of wealth
under our present systemor rather no
system of failure to exercise any ade
quate control at all. Home persona speak
as If the exercise of such governmental
control would do away with lh freedom
of Individual Initiative and dwarf Indi
vidual effort. This Is not a fact. It
would be a veritable calamity to fall to
fut a premium upon Individual Initiative,
ndlvldual capacity and effort; upon the
energy, character and foresight which
It Is so Important to encourage In the
Individual. Hut as a matter of fact the
deadening nnd degrading effect of pure
socialism, nnd especially of Its extreme
form communism, and thn destruction of
Individual character which tncy would
bring about, are in part achieved by the
wholly unregulated com ieti lion which
reMilts In a single Individual or corpor
ation rising at the expense of all others
until bis or Its rise effectually checks all
competition and reduces former competi
tor! to a position of utter Inferiority und
subordination.
Inheritance and Income Tax.
It was expected that tho president
would refer In some way to his belief
In the necessity for the curbing of enor
mous fortunes, nnd he has done so by
recommending legislation for both In
come and an Inheritance tax. He be
lieves the government should Impose a
graduated Inheritance tax, and. If possi
ble, a graduated Income tax. He says:
"I am well aware that such a subject
as this needs long and careful study In
order that the people may become famil
iar with what Is proposed to bo done,
may clearly see, tho necessity of proceed
ing with wisdom and self-restraint, and
may make up their minds Just how far
they are willing to go tn the matter:
while only trained legislators can work
out tho project In necessary detail. Hut
I feel that In the near future our nation
al legislators should enact a law provid
ing for a graduated Inheritance tax by
which a steadily Increasing rate of duty
should be put -upon all moneys or other
valuables corning by gift, bequest, or
devise to any Individual or corporation.
It may be well to make the lax heavy
In proportion as the Individual benefited
Is remote of kin. In any event. In my
Judgment the pro rata of the tax should
increase very heavily with the lnt-rHfl
of the amount b-ft to any one Individual
after a certain point has been reached.
It is most desirable to encourage thrift
and ambition, and a potent source of
thrift and ambition Is the desire, on the
imrt of the breadwinner to leave his chil
dren well off. .This object can be attained
by making the tax very small on moder
ate amounts nf property loft; becausa
the nrlme oh feet should bo to put a con
stantly Increasing burden on the Inher
itance of those swollen fortunes which
it Is certainly of no benefit to title coun
try to perpetuate.
There can be ro question of the eth
Ical propriety of the government thus de
termining the conditions upon which any
gift or inherltarttf should be recelv.).
Kxartly how far the Inheritance tax
wuM, as an Incident, aae the uffeel s
limiting the trnnsmlssinn by devise or
girt of the enormous fortunes In question
It Is not neeeksarv at present to discuss.
It ts wise that progress In this direction
should be gradual. At llrst a permanent
national Inheritance t.ix. while It might
In more substantial than any such lax
nas mtncrio neen, necit not approximate
either In amount or In the extent of the
increase by graduation, to whut such
tax should ultimately be.
Agricultural Interests.
He appeals for every encouragement
that the congress can givo to tho ugrl
cultural Interests of the country. Ho
points to the good that Is being done by
the various forms of grange organiza
tions, and says:
"Several factors must cooperate In the
improvement or the runner s condition.
He must have the chance to be educated
In the widest possible sense in the sense
which keeps over In vlw the Intimate
relationship net ween trio tneory of adu
cation and the facts of life, in all
education we should widen our alms. It
Is a good thing to produce a certain pum
per or traineu scholars and students
but the education superintended by the
state must seek rather to produce a nun-
oreu goon citizens than merely one
scholar, and It must lo turned now ami
then from the class book lo tho study
of the great book at nature Itself, This
Is especially truo of the farmer, as has
been pointed out again and again by alt
observers most competent to pass prac
tical Judgment on the problems of our
country life. All students now realizu
that education must seek to train the
executive powers of young people and to
confer more real significance upon the
phrase 'dignity of labor," and to pre
pare the Pupils so that In addition to
each developing In the highest degrea
his individual capacity for work, they
may together help create a right public
opinion, and show In many ways social
and cooperative spirit. Organization has
become necessary In the business world;
nnd It has accomplished much for good
In the w.rld of lalor. It Is no lesi peee
sary for farmers. Huch a movement as
the grange movement Is guod in Itself
and Is capable of a well-ntgh Infinite fur
ther extension for good so long as It Is
kept to its own legitimate business. Tlw
benefits to be derived by the association
of fanners for mutual advantage nr
partly economic and partly sochilou'ul.
Currency Reform.
Amendments to the present currency
laws nre ak(d for, and after nl.ovMng
that present laws are inadequate because
of the wide fluctualion of Interest
charges, be savs:
"Tho ni'-re statement nf theso firts

Cuban Intervention.
The rebellion In Cuba and the Inci
dents leading up to the establishment of
the provisional government Is reviewed,
and the president says:
- "When the election has been held anl
the new government Inaugurated In
peaceful and orderly fashion of the provi
sional government will come to an end,
I tak this opportunity of expressing
upon behalf of the American people,
with all possible solemnity, our most
earnest hope that the people of Cuba
will realize the Imperative need 0f pre
serving Justice and keeping order In the
Island. The l ulled States wishes noth
ing of Cuba except that It shall prosper
morally and materially, and wishes noth
ing of the Cubans save that thev shall
l)e abio to preserve order among them
selves and thereforo to preserve their
inueiendence. If the elect bins become -l
farce, and If the Insurrectionary habit
heroines confirmed to the Island. It Is nb.
solutely out nf ihe question that tho
island should continue Independent , and
the Cnlted States, which lias assumed
the sporsorship before tho civilized world
for Cuba's career as a nutlon, would
again have to intervene and to see that
the government was managed In surh
orderly fashion as to securu the safety
or 111 j and property. The path to bo

is always hard, und wo should
have every charity and patience with the
Cubans as they tread this difficult parth
1 have tho utmost sympathy with, and
regard for, them; but 1 most earnest iy
adjure them solemnly to weigh their re
