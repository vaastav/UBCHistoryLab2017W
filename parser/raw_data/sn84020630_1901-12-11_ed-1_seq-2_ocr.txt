New Mexico Demands Slate
btol of llie 57tli Congress.
Of Right ami i Justice Sicw
iUcxico Should I5o a Stale.
The people of New Mexico are very
desirous of running their own govern
ment. They want statehood, are enti
tled to it and ought to have it.
The year 1901 has been very prosper
ous for the territory. In every direc
tion there is growth and advancement.
The prospects for the year 1903 are also
very bright.
This thing of accumulating lots of
money in a bank for tellers and cash
iers to steal is not what it is cracked
up to be for depositors and stockhold
ers, but it happens all the same.
The people of this district desire the
reappointment of Judge John R. Mc
Fie as an associate justice of the terri
torial supreme court. ' There is every
reason why he should be so reappoin-
ted'
Nicaragua has agreed to lease to the
United States for perpetuity a strip
six miles wide for the Nicaragua canal.
This clears another obstacle out of the
way of the building of the interoceanic
canal.
Las Vegas has a poet and his daily
effusions published in the daily papers
of that city are high above the average
even of magazine poetry, and New
Mexico may some day be proud of a
man named Henry C. Warnack.
The tiff between Senators McLaurln
and Tillman of South Carolina, in con
gress this week, adds to the gaiety of
the nation, although it also throws a
peculiar side light upon the factional
differences within the Democratic
ranks even in the solid south.
Most people are of the opinion that
President Roosevelt's recent message
was a, very business-like document.
This, however, does not affect Colonel
Bryan, who is still discovering flaws in
every line of it. The colonel must have
something to talk about in his paper
else he is not happy.
Senator Hoar's plan to buy some
ocean island and to it transport all an
archists is quite a feasible one and
would at the same time offer an op
portunity for an interesting sociologi
cal experiment. The anarchists could
there work out their theory of govern
ment, or rather, non-government and
the United States would at the same
time be rid of their pernicious activity.
In his annual report on the opera
tion of the army in the Philippine Isl
ands, General Chaffee says that brig
andage there would soon be checked if
the matters were entirely in the hands
of the military government. There is
no doubt, but that General Chaffee is
correct in this statement. The average
Filipino certainly, at present, does not
deserve a liberal civil government.
Lordsburg has just dedicated a new
$5,000 school house. There are evi
dences of other nature that Lordsburg
is pushing ahead to be one of the most
progressive and leading towns of south
western New Mexico. The fact that its
people, as soon as they found that the
town was growing, decided to build a
modern school house, shows that they
are aware of the fact that no town ever
prospers unless it provides good school
houses and good school facilities.
The Danish government desires the
United States to purchase what is
known as the Danish West India isl
ands. What the United States will do
with them after it has purchased them
is not exactly clear. The islands are
not a source of profit to the Danish
government, hence it desires to get rid
of them. The only good reason for
their purchase by the United States
would be to keep European nations
from owning them.
Andrew Carnegie will give $10,000,000
toward a great national university at
Washington and with this crowning
trift hcrnmea the foremost American
philanthropist of the present and past
rtnvs. At the same time comes the
news that Mrs. Leland Stanford has
o-rnnted another $28,000,000 to Leland
Stanford University in California, it
great fortunes were always expended
thus there would be but few sincere
critics of great wealth honestly accum
ulated. , The Amalgamated copper interests
and the Rothschild interests which lat
ter control the Rio Tinto copper mines
In Spain, have made a truce and may
agree upon a minimum price for which
copper is to be sold. This would make
the copper trust international in its
scope and would put it In position to
control not only the output but also the
price of copper throughout the world.
This combination was brought about
In a natural way, like all trusts. Com
petition which is said to be the life of
trade though It is also the ruin of
many a businessman, is also the father
of trusts and as long as there is com
petition so long wise men -will seek to
overcome it by pooling their interests.
That is the secret of all trust.
The recent term of district court in
Taos county in which Judge John 11,
McFie presided was most successful. A
full week's session was had and every
case that could be tried was tried and
thus taken off the docket. ' The crimi
nal cases were disposed of and the
grand jury was in session during the
entire week. About $1,100 were spent
for the session and about $1,700 still re
main In the court fund for the coming
year.. During the year 1901 two ses
sions of court were held in Taos county
which has not been the case for many
years. Nearly all civil cases tried were
so tried before the court, Juries being
waived.
News from Washington is to the ef
fect that Oklahoma stands but poor
chances of obtaining statehood during
the present congress. That, however,
should not be discouraging to New
Mexico. One of the questions that
must be settled before Oklahoma can
be admitted as a state, is the disposi
tion of Indian Territory. In New Mex
ico's case there is no hindrance what
ever. It has the population, the wealth,
the intelligence and the ' knowledge to
conduct a strong and able state gov
ernment. It is certain that President
Roosevelt will sign a bill for an ena
bling act for New Mexico, if such a
one reaches him.
The people of Roswell and vicinity
have experienced that artesian water
is even a greater blessing than a great
irrigation system with an abundant
Supply of perennial water. They are
therefore constantly expending means
and labor to extend the artesian belt
around Roswell and are drilling for
water on the higher mesas farther
away from the city. A city in the arid
west that is surrounded by a ocuntry
well supplied with water need not fear
the future for it will always be certain
of prosperity. Panics and other vicis
situdes to which industrial and com
mercial cities are often subject cannot
touch the town that has surrounding it
a rich agricultural district.
The people of this territory, as a
whole, have not in degree, changerl
their minds since last summer when
they were nearly unanimous in asking
the reappointment of Governor Otero.
Nothing has occurred since last June
why they should change their minds;
quite the reverse. The" territorial ad
ministration has been going on honest
ly, fairly, economically and in strict
accordance with the law and for the
best interest of the people at large.
None of the very many and strong in
dorsements asking for Governor Otero's
reappointment have been withdrawn.
They are on file in Washington and
unequivocally, show the desire of the
people of New Mexico. The president
should reappoint the governor and he
would thereby greatly please nine out
of every ten citizens of the territory.
During the past three years, on ac
count of the absence of a modern steam
flour mill, the Taos county farmers
have neglected sowing wheat, as there
was no market for the surplus they
raised. A fine, extensive and modern
flour mill has been constructed recent
ly in the town of Taos and is now in
successfu)f operation. The New Mexi
can's Taos correspondent informs this
paper that owing to this fact it is ex
pected that the acreage of wheat to be
sowed the coming spring will be great
ly increased and that enough wheat
will be sown to keep the mill running
every day in the year. This is good
news 9s Taos county wheat is the sup
erior of any raised on the Globe and
the flour from it is of a correspondingly
high grade. Indeed the Taos valley can
raise enough wheat not only for the
consumption in the county, but also
supply other portions of the territory
with wheat flour.
If America's destiny has caned for
the acquisition of new territory, the
seeking of new trade markets, it cer
tainly demands the reclamation of the
arid region. Surely, there is land and
opportunity for a great empire west of
the Missouri. Thus far not one of the
large states or territories west of the
Missouri has the population of one of
the great cities of the east and yet
there is ample room in that territory
for all of the population of the United
States without crowding it in the least;
for towns and markets as great as any
of the Orient; for wealth which by
comparison pales that of the Indies.
All that is needed to create markets at
the very doors of eastern manufactur
ing centers, such as are vainly sought
in Asia, Africa, " and Australia, is to
build storage reservoirs and irrigation
works throughout the great arid west
T.id the miracle will have been per
formed. The west possesses all other
material riches to even greater extent
than the east and the middle west and
all it lacks is the abundance of water
with which the east is blessed and
sometimes cursed.
Education In New Mexico.
In Socorro county, Florenclo Cordova
was arrested for not sending his chil
dren to school. Socorro county seems
to. be taking the lead in enforcing the
compulsory school law. There are
some parts of New Mexico, and not far
from its capital city either, where only
one out of every four children of school
age attends the public schools. New
Mexico's future depends upon long
school terms, good school teachers, up-
to-date school houses and compulsory
attendance of every child at a public or
a private school for as many months
during the year as school is provided
for. Owing to poverty and sparse pop-
ulation and in some instances neglect,
the majority of school districts In New
Mexico cannot keep school longer than
three or four months a year and It is
the more the pity that so many chil-
dren do not even receive the limited
education that so short a school term
can give them. There is no doubt about
it that in many New Mexico counties
there is room for great improvement in
the public schools and Socorro county
authorities are doing the proper thing
by attempting to compel the attendance
at school of all -children of school age.

THE SWIFT SPECIFIC CO., ATLANTA, CA.
DELIMQDEMTS MUST PAY.
Back Taxes Must Be Paid by Socorro Coun
ty Citizens. '
Socorro County Chieftain.
Colonel George W. Prichard has
heretofore shown a commendable zeal
in the performance of his duties as dis
trict attorney. This zeal has been such
as to call forth the hearty approbation
of those in favor of prompt and im
partial enforcement of the law and to
command the wholesome respect of
those to whom all law is irksome. Col
onel Prichard has now expressed the
opinion, shared by all .who are familiar
with the facts in the case, that Socorro
county's delinquent tax list is several
times as large as it should be. He
has also expressed in forcible terms a
determination to reduce that list to
reasonable proportions. It is there
fore safe to assume that every resource
of the law will be exhausted to collect
the county's delinquent taxes and that
the most economical thing that those
who are delinquent can do is to pay
promptly and avoid costs.
"One-Horse Ringsters."
Las Vegas Record.
In referring to the unscrupulous
gang of soreheads, who are waging
such a villainous warfare on Governor
Otero and his administration, the Eliz-
abethtown Jtfiner as this to say:
"The faction at Santa Fe which
fought the reappointment of M. A.
Otero as governor of New Mexico at
the hands of the late president William
McKinley now proposes to resurrect its
charges and bring the matter up before
President Roosevelt. The respectable
people of the territory, regardless of
political affiliations, disapprove and de
nounce any such action and the kickers
at the territorial capital will find out
that they have not only barked up the
wrong tree, but the people of the terri
tory have become disgusted and sick of
such unscrupulous methods as employ
ed by that disgruntled clique. The fact
of the matter is that a few one-horse
political ringsters want to oust the
present incumbent to put in some man
of their particular stripe. The presi
dent is not a Missourian but he will
have to be 'showed' why there should
be any change.;'
A Democratic View.
Springer Stockman.
While all must admit that a hard,
stiff fight is being made on the confir
mation of Governor Otero, yet on the
other hand a great many of them can
but admit that the chances are two to
one (or somewhere In that ratio) that
his appointment by the late president
will be confirmed by the senate. It Is
hardly probable that President Roose
velt will thus early take steps contrary
to the expressed wishes of his mar
tyred predecessor. While Mr. Roose
velt may have someone else in view for
governor of New Mexico, he could poitjt
to the action of the late president as
an excuse for not stirring up any polit
ical feeling, and the whole party . in
the territory would put him down as
about right.
They Are Dead to Shame.
Las Vegas Record.
' Dispatches from Washington an
nounce that President Roosevelt has
investigated the charges preferred by
the sorehead gang against G" ,-ernor
Otero and found them to be false. As
a. result the president will nominate
the governor to be his own successor.
This is the second time within a few
months that the highest official author
itv In the United States branded the
New Mexico soreheads and their yel
low sheets with willful and malicious
lying about a faithful and honored
public official. Such condemnation
would overwhelm an ordinary individ
ual, but it will not affect the sore
heads and their "red" allies, because
they are dead to shame.

Carlsbad Argus.
Delegate B. S. Rodey is now in Wash
ington, where he will carefully guard
the Interests of the territory during
the present session of congress. Mr.
Rodey will" do herculean work to the
end that New Mexico may be admitted
to statehood, and even if the boon is
ultimately denied, the people of the
territory will have a consciousness that
failure resulted from no fault upon the
part of their delegate. Mr. Rodey Is
