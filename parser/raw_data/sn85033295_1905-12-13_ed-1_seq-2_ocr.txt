CHINESE BOYCOTT
GETS INTO ’FRISCO.
Sailors on Board Celestial Liner Refuse
to Buy American Goods as Has
Been Their Custom.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 9.—The
anti-American boycott has reached this
port. It is the custom of the Pacific
Mail ompany to allow peddlers and oth
er small dealers on board their China
liners during the luncheon hour for the
convenience of the Chinese sailors, fire
men. cooks and waiters, who by reason
of the exclusion act may not do their
shopping ashore. When the Manchuria
docked on Tuesday last notices in Chi
nese were tacked up all over the ship.
These notices called the attention of the
Manchuria’s crew to the existence of a
boycott against American goods and for
bade them to buy wares offered for sale
on the liner’s desks during her stay in
this American port. Dealers have aban
doned their efforts to trade with them.
TARS ON A RAMPAGE.
Germans Seize Deserter in Brazilian
Village Without a War
rant.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 9.—The
Brazilian embassy in this city has re
ceived a telegram from Baron de Rio
Branco, the minister of foreign affairs,
stating that several of the officers of the
German gunboat Panther went ashore
in civilian dress and visited a small fish
ing town, Itajahy, in Santa Catalina,
and there without process seized a man
named Steinhoff, who had left his na
tive country, Germany, as a deserter
from the army and took him a prisoner
to the Panther.
Brazil’s C ruisers on Watch.
Thereupon the gunboat left Itajahy
and went to another port in the state of
Rio Grande Do Sul. The three Brazil
ian cruisers. Almirante Barraro, Benja
min Constant and Tamandare were sent
to watch the Panther and see that no
similar occurrence should again happen,
while the Brazilian government made an
official protest against the action of those
officers to the German government.
Sylvino Gurget Do Amaral, first sec
retary of the Brazilian embassy, de
clared today that the relations between
Germany and Brazil have of late been
very cordial. It was therefore thought
that Germany will give prompt and full
redress to what at first report appears
to be a severe breach of international
law. It is not known under whose or
ders the officers of the Panther acted, if
any. Itajahy is a small fishing village
with perhaps a policeman or two and
without any power to prevent the cap
ture of the German who was found in
a hotel.
Confer with State Department.
Senhor Nabuco, the Brazilian ambas
sador. had an interview with Acting
Secretary Bacon today in the absence of
Secretary Root. It is understood the
ambassador communicated to Mr. Bacon
ns a matter of information the cable
advices ho had received from his own
government, but made no effort at this
stage to interest the department.
The opinion prevails in naval circles
here that if the facts are as represent
ed, the German government will prompt
ly disavow the action of the officers of
the Panther.
PERIL LIVES FOR FUN.
Bad Boys Hurl Stones Through Passen
ger Train Windows —Inspired
by Mischief.
CHICAGO. Hh, Dec. 9.—Railway offi
cials, who for years have tried to sup
press the small boy who throws stones at
passing trains, are saying “I told you
sol” This because investigation in
Philadelphia has shown that the lead
weight which crashed through a window
of President Roosevelt’s train last Sat
urday was thrown, not by an anarchist,
but by a boy.
No Man Threw the Weight.
“Why,” declared R. C. Richards, gen
eral claim agent for the Chicago &
North-Western railroad, “it is nonsense
to believe a man threw that lead weight.
It was only some mischievous boy who
may not have known the United States
has a President, and who, anyhow, had
no idea that he was on that train.”
Passengers, especially on suburban
trains, complain that frequently stones
are thrown through car windows. Nar
row escapes from injury from the flying
missile or fragments of glass are fre
quent.
Inspired by Mischief.
Inquiry among the railroad offices es
tablishes the fact that in 99 out of 100
cases it is the small boys between the
ages of 7 and 10 who hurl the missiles.
They do it out of sheer mischief. They
are arrested, but their parents or guar
dians come to the front, shed tears, say
tender words, make innumerable prom
ises and the court gives a warning. The
youthful prisoners are dismissed and that
is the last heard of the oases.
Sometimes the mischief results in the
filing of claims, but these are few. Gen
erally the stones do only property dam
age, and when shattered glass does
strike a passenger he realizes at once,
unless the injury is exceptionally severe,
that the railroad is in no wise to blame.
If an eye is lost or beauty marred he oc
cationally refuses to realize the non
culpability of the road and tiles a claim.
Many of the “mysterious attacks” on
trains in Wisconsin and northern Mich
igan recently are said by railroad of
ficials to be due to small boys who are
“having fun.”
Cannot Collect Money.
The "fire eater’s” big drink at the
Ovrholt distillery at Connellsville, Pa.,
will cost Uncle Sam .$891,000. On the
si 0.000 gallons of American revivifier
"lapped up” there was coming to the
government 81.10 per. It always will
be coming. There now is no way of re
covering a cent.
LIGHTSHIP MAKES A
LAST PLEA FOR HELP.
♦
Newport Boat Sends Unfinished Message
by Wireless—Gunboat to Rescue
in Heavy Sea.
NEWPORT, R. 1., Dec. 11.—A half
finished message, sent just before the
batteries are supposed to have become
exhausted came here by wireless from
the Nantucket lightship early today ask
ing for heip. The message was:
“Nantucket Shoals lightship in dis
tress. Send held from anywhere ”
Here the message broke off.
The United States gunboat Hist left
here for the lightship at 6 a. m. today.
The wind is west to northwest and mod
erate. The sea is subsiding.
Repeated calls by the wireless operator
here to the lightship were unanswered*
during the forenoon.
NEW BEDFORD, Mass., Dec. 11.—
The keeper of Dumpling light today re
ported that a passenger vessel had sig
naled him that the lighthouse tender
Azalea reached Nantucket south shoals
at 5:30 a. m. No mention was made
of the damaged lightship and the keeper
assumed from this that the vessel was
safe.
KING LIKES CABINET.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman Makes
Success for Liberals —Conserva-
tives Must Admit It.
LONDON, Dec. 11.—Sir Henry Camp
bell-Bannerman, the new premier, drove
to the palace last night and had an audi
ence with King Edward, presenting the
names of the new ministry. The King
signified his approval of the new govern
ment.
Seals Are Delivered.
The privy council met at Buckingham
palace today to enable the outgoing min
isters to deliver their seals of office.
Afterwards Sir Henry Campbell-Ban
nerman and his colleagues attended at
the palace to receive their seals from the
King. The, appointments follow:
Premier Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman
Chancellor of exchequer... .H. H. Asquith
Home secretary H. J. Gladstone
Foreign Affairs Sir Edward Grey
Colonies Lord Elgin
War R. B. Haldane
India John Morley
Admiralty Baron Tweedmouth
President board of trade...D. Lloyd George
President local government board
John Burns
Postmaster general Sydney Buxton
Secretary for Ireland James Bryce
Lord lieutenant of Ireland.. Lord Aberdeen
Other Appointments Made.
In addition to the other ministerial ap
pointments are the following:
Secretary for Scotland John Sinclair
President board of agriculture
Earl of Carrington
President of council Earl of Crewe
Lord of privy seal Marquis of Ripon
President board of education.... A. Birroll
Chancellor of Lancaster. .Sir H. H. Fowler
Commissioner of public works
L. V. Harcourt
Lord high chancellor... .Sir Robert T. Reid
The conservative morning newspapers
are compelled to admit that Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman has succeeded in
forming a much stronger administration
than had been thought possible. The
liberal papers are full of enthusiasm and
of cordial congratulations. They express
the conviction that such a cabinet will
inspire confidence both at home and
abroad.
The names of Herbert Henry Asquith,
Sir Edward Grey, and Richard Burton
Haldane alone, it is held, will give great
weight to the ministry and insure that
there will be no revival of Gladstoniau
home rule, despite the fact that the cabi
net contains a preponderance of those
favorable to home rule.
The conservative organs point out that
the most enthusiastic home ruler, John
Morley. has been sent to the India office,
where he will have little influence on in
ternal politics.
The omission of Lord Rosebery is nat
urally the subject of much comment and
there is considerable curiosity as to what
attitude he will adopt when he addresses
the liberal league today. It is noticeable
that his son-in-law, the Earl of Crewe,
is in the cabinet.

whom he acted as private secretary for a
time. He has heid under secretaryships

RAILWAY MEN TO QUIT
♦
Final Test of Power to Follow
Government’s Challenge.
♦
“REACTION HAS COME.”
Liberals Say That Witte Has Turned and
Will Use Oppression to Settle
Civil Strife.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 11.—(7:30
p. m.) —The telegraph lines with Mos
cow, Reval, Kieff, Novgorod, Archangle
and Narva are working today. It is be
lieved that the strike is collapsing. The
mails have not arrived from the south
©wing to the railway strike.
WARSAW, Dec. 11. —The central
committee of the union of railroad men
now in session at Moscow will probably
order a general railroad strike to begin at
midnight in consequence of the arrest of
M. Krustaleff, president of the executive
committee of the workmen’s council at
St. Petersburg. The local committee of
the railroad union has received a notifi
cation from the committee at St. Peters
burg to that effect.
Witte’s Turn, the Challenge.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 10.—(De
layed.)—There was every indication this
morning that the government’s challenge
will be accepted and that within forty
eight hours a general strike through© at
Russia will be ordered.
Count Witte has gone over to the camp
of the enemy, it is said, and is now an
uncompromising repressionist. He has
become convinced that it is impossible
to satisfy the people without completely
overturning the Russian kingdom. Con
sequently he has consented to the use of
force in putting down all uprisings
against the Czar. This is called the gov
ernment’s challenge.
A terrible storm has been raised by the
arrest of M. Krustaloff, president of the
executive committee of the workmen’s
council, which was followed during the
night by the imprisonment of the mem
bers of the workmen’s council and a
number of Socialistic leaders.
Reaction Has New Come.
“The reaction has come,” were the
words on every lip. and in the liberal ex
tremist camp there was only one opinion,
namely, that it must be resisted to the
bitter end. At all the meetings last
night, some of which lasted until morn
ing, the opinion was unanimous that the
government had forced the hands of the
proletariat, and the supreme weapon, a
general strike, must be invoked.
Newspapers Confiscated.
The newspaper editors at yesterday
evening’s meeting decided that the
temporary press law for bidding the dis
cussion of vital questions affecting the
welfare of the nation violated the prin
ciples of freedom of speech and of the
press guaranteed by the imperial mani
festo and that it must be defied. The
result was that the editions of the Russ,
and half a dozen more Radical papers
were confiscated.
The employes of the Riga-Orel rail
road have declared a strike on account
of the declaration of martial law in
Livoni and have sent an appeal to the
other roads to join. Last night the rail
road men of the Baltic lines decided to
follow the example of the Riga-Orel
men.
Anarchy in Livonia.
The situation in Livonia is frightful.
Absolute anarchy prevails.
A messenger who arrived here this
morning declared that the streets of
Riga were flowing with blood. After a
meeting the railroad men of Riga were
mowed down by the fire of machine
guns and artillery. The railroad men of
St. Petersburg at a meeting yesterday
evening resolved that inasmuch “as the
reaction is gaining force and the govern
ment is seeking to retract what was won
by the first Pan-Russian strike,” the
railroad men stand ready to obey the
signal for a general strike, but advise
their fellow workers to await the word
from the central committee at Moscow,
as a failure must not be risked.
Telegraphers Are Arrested,
Simultaneously with the arrests here
M, Dronshilny and all the members
of the union, of the employes of the
posts and telegraph operators of Mos
cow. with M. Kokohanowski at their
head, were arrested at Moscow.
Czar Greets the Cossacks.
Emperor Nicholas has issued an order
today, thanking all the Cossack troops
for their “self-sacrificing, untiring and
loyal services to the throne and father
land both at the seat of war and in the
preservation of order within the empire.”
INDIANA GAMBLERS CLOSE

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Dec. 11.—Ac
cording to authoritative information re
ceived by the Morning Star, the Casino

tion with violations at the city election

World’s Greatest Newspaper Readers.
The per capita value of tHe paper con
sumed in the United States yearly is the
greatest in the world, and amounted dur
ing last year to about $1.75. News
paper figured largest in the total product,
with a record for 1004 of about (350,000
tons, valued at about $23,000,000. In
1890 a total of 190,053 tons, worth $13.-
100.034. sufficed to meet the demand.
We were noted as the largest newspaper
reading people on earth in 1890, but
in 1904 we read about three times more,
or, at an}’ rate, had threee times as
much offered us to read. It is interest
ing to note that in 3890 the cost of news
paper was about double what it is at
present, namely, SO7 a ton, as compared
with about $35 now.—Technical World
Magazine.
Turbines in Germany.
The German admiralty has adopted
a curious attitude on the question of
turbine propellers. They seem to be re
garded with some favor for cruisers and
to be condemned for torpedo craft. The
new cruiser Wacht, for which provision
is made in the current budget, is, unless
the authorities should change their
minds, to be fitted with turbines. Ex
periments, however, conducted at Kiel,
have given a bad impression of turbines
iii torpedo boats, and, as at present ad
vised, the naval department will not put
any more of them in boats of this class.—

THE LEGISLATURE.
IN THE ASSEMBLY.
The Assembly met on the sth to hear
the governor’s message and announcement
of acceptance of the United States Senator
ship.
petitions came into the Assembly
from Waupaca county on the 6th object
ing to the law providing for fishways in
clams and asking relief. Resolutions pre
sented and adopted were: Mr, Smelker,
that each member be given a copy of the
laws of 1898, to be returned at the close
of the session, also copies of journals of
last session; Mr. Potts, that no new bills
be introduced after December 7 except in
committees. Three bills came in, two by
Mr. Potts for the repeal of the fishway
law and the pocket ballot law passed at
the last session. He asked that the bills
be put through under suspension, but with
drew his request on objections. Mr. Dahl
wanted the committee to consider the fish
way bill and not have voting in the dark.
Mr. Beedle objected to the pocket ballot
bill of Mr. Potts. Mr. Hageman introduced
a bill enlarging the powers of the railway
rate commission.
The Assembly had a sensation at the very
start of Its session on the 7th, when As
semblyman Miller of Green Lake county
presented a resolution asking Gov. La Fol
lette to resign either the governorship or
the seuatorshlp at once. Mr. Andrews
moved that the resolution be laid on the
table. Mr. Miller asked for a roll call, but
was not sustained by a sufficient number,
and amid some hilarity the Andrews motion
prevailed. The measure providing for the
new $2,500,000 capitol building, which has
passed the Senate, was favorably reported
In the Assembly. The pocket ballot bill
was reported for death. It is altogether
probable that the Assembly will hold a
mock primary election in a day or two for
the purpose of testing the new law. Mr.
Schaut introduced a resolution to that ef
fect. On motion of Mr. Hube It was laid
over.
A joint resolution was Introduced in the
Assembly on the Bth to provide for a
thorough investigation Into all of the af
fairs of the state university. Mr. Potter
presented a resolution for the appointment
of an Index clerk for the Assembly. It was
adopted. The committee on new bills, priv
ilege and elections, presented two new bills,
one providing for an amendment to the
primary election law and one changing the
form of the official ballot. The bill amend
ing the railroad rate law was favorably re
ported. On a rising vote, the Schauer reso
lution providing for a mock primary elec
tion by the Assembly to test the operation
of the proposed primary law was adopted.
The speaker announced that he would fix
a date for the election as soon as bill should
be printed. The new capitoj biij was on the
calendar for advancement and under sus
pension was taken up for passage. Mi.
Brockhausen’s amendment limiting work on
the new building to eight hours a day came
up. Mr. Andrew said that was a proposition
of great importance and wanted the bill
and amendment rereferred, which prevailed.
Another amendment to the primary election
law has been Introduced by Mr, Thomas
to provide that no candidate can secure the

sion with all possible dispatch to the end
that the members might clean up the busi
ness and go home without delay. Senator
Whitehead moved that a recess be taken
until 11 o'clock by which time one or two
bills would be ready, he said. He thought
the Senate should be “on call” for busi
nejs continuously. The recess was decid
ed upon. At 11 o’clock the Senate con
vened again, and the committee on roads
and bridges recommended that part of the
governor’s message referring to county aid
for bridges be re-referred to the commit
tee on judiciary, which was done. The

Three Spoons a-Spooning,
A telegraph operator employed in a

her spoon and occasionally tapping
gently with it on the side of her plate,

GIRL AND DOG CAUSE PANIC.
Ugly Canine Responsible for Big Scare
in Louisville.
An ugly bulldog and a pretty giri at
opposite ends of a silken cord caused a
panic among shoppers in the busiest part
of Market street, Louisville, in which
three omen fainted, a team ran away
and a motorman strained his neck in an
effort to stop his car in time to avoid a
fatality.
The dog refused to give his name but
he admitted, at least by implication.’ that
he belonged to Miss Marjory Weissinger.
who, in addition to being considered one
of the most beautiful women in Louis
ville, has the distinction of being the
daughter of one of that city’s wealthiest
men. Miss Weissinger and her pet were
out for their daily constitutional. All
went well until the bulldog spied an in
offensive terrier in the middle of the
street.
He was enraged that any other dog
should have the presumption to walk the
same street, and gave a frantic lunge to
get at his foe. Miss Weissinger hung
gamely to the cord, but as the two strug

alarm. h mally the bulldog got away
and started down the street after the ter
rier, yelping defiance as he went. A
team of horses ran away and collided
with a street car, but the bulldog had no
time to pay attention to such trivialities.
He caught the terrier in the middle of
the car tracks and proceeded to give him
a lesson in etiquette. A street car was

and led him struggling away.
“How terrible,” murmured a woman.

Dayton, Tenn., Dec. 11. —(Special.)
Among many prominent residents to
praise Dodd’s Kidney Pills is Mr. N.
K. Roberts of this place. He tells of
what they have done for him. and his
ords will go deep into the hearts of
all who are suffering in the same way.
He says;
“I was a martyr to Kidney Trouble,
but Dodd's Kidney Pills completely
cured me. I shall always keep them
on hand in case there should be any re
turn of the old trouble, but I am thank
ful to say they did their work so well
there has not been the slightest sign
of my old complaint coming back. The
pain in my back used to be terrible.
If I got down I had a hard job to get
straight again. But my back is like a
new one now and I can stoop as much
as I please. I don’t believe there ever
was any medicine half so good as
Dodd’s Kidney Pills.”
Rows of Corn on a Cob.
George Hanson of this city is exhibit
ing an ear of corn grown on his farm
that is attracting a great deal of atten
tion. due to the fact that the ear has
an odd number of rows of grain—twenty
three in all. Several of the oldest farm
ers in the neighborhood were skeptical
of the story until they were shown the
ear.
Rows of corn grow on the cob in even
numbers, and one with an odd number
is considered an almost unheard of freak.
The ear in question is, however, well de
veloped, and the rows are straight and
even. Mr. Hanson discovered it while
sorting corn for seed.
There is an old story to the effect that
once, in antebellum days, an old south
ern slave owner promised freedom to the
first negro who would find an ear of
corn bearing an odd number of rows.
Among the slaves was a young darky
who had a thought which he kept all to
himself, but when the corn was in the
roasting ear he went to the field and,
stripping back the husk from an ear,
he cut away one of the rows of grain
with a sharp knife. By the time the
corn had reached its maturity the wound
made by the knife had been entirely ob
literated, and the ear showed an odd
number of rows of grains. The young
slave was accordingly given his freedom,
and his cunning was not discovered un
til he had gotten safely away.—Areola

With a Reformer.
James Merry, a well known Scottish
iron master and owner of race horses,
once decided to run for Parliament. He
stood as candidate for Glasgow. He
posed as an extreme radical, and was
prepared to abolish everything in sight,
as a short way to reform. At one of
his meetings where the heckling of can
didates was the feature, as in all Scot
tish elections, he was asked, after he had
disposed summarily of the crown, the
House of Lords and most of the British
constitution, whether he would abolish
the decalogue. “Certainly,” cried the
valiant Merry. Then, turning to his
nearest neighbor on the platform, he
asked in an audible whisper, “Jack, what
in thunder’s the decalogue?”—Cleveland

A BRAIN WORKER
Must Have the Kind of Food that
Nourishes Brain.
“I am a literary man whose nervous
energy is a great part of my stock in
trade, and ordinarily I have little pa
tience with breakfast foods and the
extravagant claims made of them. But
I cannot withhold my acknowledg
ment of the debt that I owe to Grape-
Nuts food.
“I discovered long ago that the very
bulkiness of the ordinary diet was not
calculated to give one a clear head, the
power of sustained, accurate thinking.
I always felt heavy and sluggish in
mind as well as body after eating the
ordinary meal, which diverted the
blood from the brain to the digestive
apparatus.
“I tried foods easy of digestion, but
found them usually deficient in nutri
ment. I experimented with many
breakfast foods and they, too, proved
unsatisfactory, till I reached Grape-
Nuts. And then the problem was
solved,
“Grape-Nuts agreed with me perfect
ly frorj the beginning, satisfying my
hunger and supplying the nutriment
that so many other prepared foods
lack.
“I bad not been using it very long
before I found that I was turning out
an unusual quantity and quality of
work. Continued use has demonstra
ted to my entire satisfaction that
Grape-Nuts food contains all the ele
ments need°d by the brain and ner
vous system of the hard working pub
lic writer.” Name given by Postum
