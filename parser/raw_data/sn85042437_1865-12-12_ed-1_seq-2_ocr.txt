The British in Jamaica.
As daylight is let in upon the recent
events inj Jamaica, (British misrule and
barbarity tare more and" more armarent.
According to the best information that
be obtained, the British authorities

butcheries ever perpetrated tipoh ah isrno-
rant and down-trodden people. A careful
investigation of the case shows that the
rebellion pf which we have heard so
much existeaonly m the heated imagma -
tion of miiltv and eowardlv Britii.li nffi.
"
com. There is no evidehce of conspiracy
-.0 proof of any design to inaugurate
rebellion ; but, on the contrary, the out-
break at ilorant Bav. on the 11th of No-
vember seems to have orirrinated in the
hastv and cruel action of the rmmmrW
of a body of British troops, in ordering
his men to fire upon an assemblage of col
ored men, women and children, who, al
though somewhat boisterous, had not vio
lated the law or committed any absolute
offence against the peace ; that this wanton
act caused a riot, which was participated
in by some five hundred colored men,
which continued only half a day, and in
which only fifteen lives were destroyed,
and those members of the party who fired
upon the populace. The fight being over,
the rioters, for such they really were, dis
persed, with few exceptions, and the acts
of these were trivial, none of them result
ing in loss of life. For this offence, the
country was scoured and indiscriminate
arrests made, and, after arrest, all manner
of torture was applied. Many were shot
down in attempting to escape from their
bloodthirsty pursuers. Castigation was
resorted to when no proof of participation
in the outbreak could be obtained, and the
unfortunates who exhibited dissatisfaction
with the proceeding were rewarded with
death on the spot. Two thousand were
executed within a lew dins, whilst it was
estimated another thousand perished
at the hands of the military- sent
in pursuit of the unfortunate fugitives.
Still tbe hellish work of ventreance
goes on. Each steamer brings
tidings of blood ehed without the slightest
semblance of legal proceedings. All con
victions have been at the hands of drum
head courts martial. The Kingston (Ja
maica) OUaner announces, in the follow
ing extract, the fact that the wild savages
of tbe mountains, known as Maroons, a
race composed of the descendants of the
native Indians and the Africans who in
times past fled from slavery, have been
employed by the British authorities to
bunt down and kill all the fugitive Negroes
thev can find:
"This wonderful and loyal people (the
aborigines 01 Jamaica) nave, under Col.
A. G. Fyfe, who led them in !the last re
bellion, turned out for the Government to
clear the mountains of St. Thomas-in-the-
East of the rebels who seek shelter in the
natural wildnoss of their strongholds.
"Their appearance, decorated with their
well-known 'war-paint, covered with
bushes and twigs of the liirnum vita;.
struck terror into the hearts of the rebels
at Portland and St. Thomas-in-the-East.
Where they lay down, nothing was dis
cernible ot tne bodies nothing but tne
living bush that covered them, ln this
way they march without observation, and
in this way they spring like tigers upon
their prey, who, seeing nothing but a for-
est of bushes, imagine themselves secure.
" Ihey are already scounmr the country
for rebels, dragging them from their con-
PMltnpnt. anil nvlnrminntinn tkum .!
ever thnv am faua. Over one hundred
rebels are reported to have been shot by
the Maroons in this mission already. '
"At an execution of tn rebels, and
wniletbe dead bodies were banging as an
example, the Maroons (we are informed
dv loionei mint) assembled around tbe
gallows, where they had a war dance, the
savage wnaness oi wnicn was truly grand.
We see no reason why British officers in
Jamaica should employ the wild men of the
mountains to destroy the weak victims of
their wrath. The events of the last few
weeks prove that British officers are capa
of as savage deeds as even the paint
ed JIaroons of the mountains, who "spring
like titjers on their prey."

Produce Gambling.
The Chicago papers contain accounts of
numerous heavy failures among the grain
speculators of that oily. Chicago has long
prided itself ou being the great grain
market of tho "West, and its grain dealers
have made fortunes with a rapidity un
known to the staid business men of more
conservative cities. Tho recent fnilures
reveal the fact that a system of gambling,
similar to that practiced by Wall street
stock operators, is in vogue among Chica
speculators in produce. Itns stated
fully nine-tenths of the transactions
'change are purely fictitions; that th
produce is never delivered. "We presume
most of our readers are familiar with the
mode of selling for "future delivery,"
it is termed; but, for the benefit of
those who are not, we will state it briefly.
Suppose 2(0. 1 spring wheat to be worth
dollarjind twenty-five cents per bushel
believes it will be lower ten days hence.
believes otherwise. They are willing to
"back their opinions," as the phrase goes
among sporting gentry. Therefore, A
rees to deliver to B, ten days from date,
thousand bushels of that brand of
beat at one dollar and twenty-two cents.
ten days having expired, reference is
to the price current, by which the
price is found to have gone up instead of
down and the ruling quotation for that
brand of wheat is one dollar and twenty-
eight, six cents above the price named in
cen tract between A and B. ow, in
stead of A delivering the wheat, which it
never designed he should do, he pays
the difference between the price named
the contract and the price prevailing on
day stipulated for delivery. If this
transaction should find a place in the
market report, it would be stated thus :
"Sale of 10,000 pusbels Ho. I spring
wheat at $1.22, delivered in ten days."
Under this phraseology is concealed one of
vilest systems of gambling now in
practice. It is nothing less than a wager
the tendency of the market ; betting in
worst form. Ordinarily, when men lay
wager, a stipulated sum is agreed upon,
the parties know exactly how much is
risked. In produce or stock gambling
neither party knows the amount risked.
loss may be small it may be great.
the transaction be large, a fortune may
staked upon it. The man of wealth to
day may, if addicted to this system of gen
teul gambling, be a beggar to-morrow.
Parties engaged in these operations are di
vided iuto two classes, those who seek to
the price and those who desire to
lowtr it. These known in commercial
nomenclature as " bulk " and " bears "
combinations and labor withall their
power to influence the market in a manner
conduce to their peculiar interests.
These extraneous influences cause the
maket to vary to an -undue degree, often
bringing disaster upon legitimate dealers. I
do not know that there is any way to I
an entire stop to this class of transac
now prevalent to a greater or leaser
degree in ail our principal commercial
is
cities, birt-wo think it is "within the
power ot .Boards ol Iruds to ao
much toward its suppression. Let
it be adopted as one of the rules
of each Board that aucii transactions
are punishable by expulsion, and we think
the evil will be greatly diminished if not
altogether abolished, and that much good
will result therefrom.

Conviction of Col. Crane.

conclusion of the trial by court martial of I
Lieut. Col.' John C. Crane, Quartermaster,

by colluding with certain hardware deal

the use of the government. The trial re

Conviction of Col. Crane. SENTENCE.
" To be cashiered : to forfeit all pay and
allowances now due, or to become due ; to
be lined in tbe sum of live thousand dol
lars ($5,000) ; and in default of the pay
ment of the same, or any part thereof, te
be confined in such prison as the General
commanding the Military Division of the
Tennessee may direct, until such fine is
satisfied, at the rate of one day's confine
ment for each ten dollars of fine; and that
the crime, name, place of abode, and pun
ishment, be published in the newspapers of
the city of Nashville, and of the particu

or where he usually resides."
Colonel Crane has accepted the situation,
paid his fine, and is dismissed from the ser
vice.
The telegraph states that Genera! But
ler's Congressional friends are about to de
clare war upon General Grant, in retalia

statements about Butler's military career.
They will find warring upon Grant "a

The Homes of Andrew Jackson and
Daniel Webster.
" The Hermitage," or what once was
the home of President Johnson, is rapidly
going to decay. It stands without a ten
ant, and the only article of furniture it
contains is an old arm chair which, report
nas it, did once belong to Ueneral w asb
ington. Adjacent to the house, in a rudely
built log hut, lives an old negro and his
wife, formerly belonging to General Jack
son. Ihe sacred tomb of the soluicr-
statefman and his wife is in
a corner of
the garden. It is in the form of a
Temple of Liberty. One of the
larrro stones covering the remains has
sunk down, and, like the rest of
the premises, is going to ruin. The gar
den, onco so beautiful, is overgrown with
weeds and grass. Ihe fences are nearly
all down and rotten ; in fact, all is desola
tion. The property was left to an adopted
son, a nephew of General Jackson, who
sold it to the commonwealth of Tennessee,
its owner still.
"Marshfield," the borne of Webster, is
quite a watering place, , and is becoming
more so every summer. Hence the niart-
sion is much resorted to. The family

that were presented to Mr. "Wehster : to
"the chamber where the e-ood man met his
fate:" and the erounds. on the r-
ceipt of a small fee. The house is iuet
as Mr. Webster left it; a spacious one of
wood, painted white, and with green
blinds. It is quite far from the street, in
the style of an English gentlemen's home,
and has that magnificent old English elm
beside it, as formerly. None of the Web
ster name now reside at " Marshfield,"
though the widow of the late Col. Fletcher
W ebster usually spends a month or two
on tho farm each year. Tho place will
soon be owned by Ashburton Webster, a
grandson of Daniel, or as soon as he is of
nee. He is connected -with the United
States Navy, and promises to bo worthy ot
the name. Daniel Webster, who bears the
great name of his grandfather, nnd son of
Colonel Fletcher AVebstcr, is now here.
and apparently in the lust stage nf a futul
disease. As most know, none of M r. Web-
stcr's children are living; and but three
grand-children of his nm, the two al
ready mentioned, and their sister. There
aro also four grand-children by the name
of Appleton, children of his much loved
dnurjliter Julia. All his children are buried
at his side in tho family tomb.

pointment in inning to obtain a coveted
appointment, is furnished in tbe case of
Mr. Dennison, who, on Satarday last, re
signei his position as crier of the court,
under the firm conviction that he would
be chosen Doorkeeper of the House of
iiepresentatives. Ihe use ot tbe narcotic
had so affected his mind that he dreamed
of nothing but success, and when, on
Monday, he awoke to tbe reality of de
feat, the reaction toppled down his
reason, -and in Ins despair he sought the
"sleep of death." Entering .a sa
loon, he called for a glass of liquor, in
which he was in the act of inserting a
poison, when the barkeeper wrested it
from him and thus frustrated his purpose.
Soon afterwards,at the Metropolitan Hotel,
he was observed to take a paper from his
pocket and pass the contents to his mouth,
when his hand was arrested by persons
who had observed the sinculality of his
behavior, and an examination showed that
the powder was arsenic. He was then
taken in custody by the police, to whom he
declared that he was fully determined to
put an end to Ins existence; and, after
being placed in a cell, ho attempted to
hang himself fty means of a handkerchief
that he had secreted from the officers,
which fortunately breaking, caused only
temporary strangulation. He remained
but a few hours under the surveillance of
tho officers, when he was conducted to his
homo by a relative and two physicians.
and we are informed that his friends an
ticipate his speedy recovery.

A Significant Omission.
The Washington correspondent of the
New Tork Tribune says :
to
It is considered here that the most im
portant feature of the Message consists in
what it does not say. Although it con
tains full and frank exposition of the
President's views as to the theory of Re
construction, it does not urge those views
upon Congress as rules of immediate ac
tion, it does not even state the Presi
dent's opinions as to the present condi
tion of things in the Southern States an
omission the more noteworthy, as the
state of the country might have been ex
pected to form one of the most essential
parts of a Presidential Messago at this
momentous period but in recognizing
tbe power of Congress as to the comple
tion ef the work of Reconstruction, it
leaves Congress perfectly free to act upon
its own judgment. Assuming that there
a difference of opinion between the
President and the majority in Congress
upon the problem ot .Reconstruction,
there is, as the matter is put in the Mes
saere. no necessity for anv conflict between
the Executive and the Legislative powers
on that point This is the view generally
taken in leading political circles here, and
this respect the Messago was received
by the majority with unfeigned satisfac
tion. the

The pressure of .matter which has mo
nopolized our columns for some days past
has prevented an earlier publication of
any portion of the eloquent address of Gen.
A. S. Strickland, delivered before the
Twenty-Third Army Corps Association,

particularly to the Twenty-Third Corps,
which will be found of great interest :

hurried forward to the Atlanta cam-
Dai!rn
'xnis campaign must ever rank as one 01
tne granaest in History. a ow 10 low days,
weeks, nay, months of consecutive1 battle,
the most persistent that ever tried the
nerve or endurance of the' soldier; through
which were arrayed an ever receding
series of unyielding and unbroken lines of
Federal and rebel troops, continually
belching forth death-dealing missiles from
every angle of roughly improvised Works,
and at every hour of the day and night
All that a soldier could do to advance,
was done by Sherman, while every mili
tary art was exhausted by Johnson to re
tard our progress. Our determined ef
forts to advance brought daily conflicts,
and the survivors of our corps may well
be said to be the heroes of a hundred bat
tles. We retrteniber too vividly our own
struggles at Resaca,at Dallaa,at Kenesw,at
Culp's House on the right of the Twenti
eth Corps, in the flank movement causing
the evacuation of Kenesaw mountain, the
crossing of the Chatahoochie, the capture
of Decatur, and finally our fight on the
right and left of Atlanta, in every one of
which we triumphed over our veteran
foes, and won laurels which might well
have been envied by the proudest corps of
the army. But still greater were our
achievements with the Fourth Army
Corps, when at Columbia, (having been
flanked by the enemy,) you made your
celebrated march to Spring Hill, and cut
ting your way through Cheatham's rebel
corps, reached Franklin in advance of the
foe.
It will be well to glance at the views
and grand tactics of the rebels. Johnson
had declared Atlanta indefensible, and
proposed to continue his Fabian policy,
and to fall back to Augusta. To this pol
icy there was fierce opposition from high
quarters, including that of Hood and Jen".
Davis himself. After full consultation it
was resolved to place Hood in command
of Johnson's army, and relying upon tneir
vain boast that Southern troops were su
perior soldiers to the Northern, man to
man, they determined to pass Sherman
and "carry the war into Africa." ' With
this conception of their powers they more
than once vainly put it to test, and finally
ruined Hood's splondid army, and "broke
the back-bone of the rebellion " by their
mad attempts.
First, Hood charged tho Federals before
Atlanta, commanded by the lamented Mc
Fherson, and was hurled back with ruin
ous slaughter and defeat. Again, within
three days, he hurled his columns upon the
same troops, now moved to the right wing
' 'ho army, and rndor command ot tne
gallant Howard, wnera, u possiDle, ne met
with more signal di?Rster than on the left.
Then, after repeatod maneuvers and disap
pointments, he presented himself before
Franklin, and prepared to give a third and
final trial so his sanguine theory of supe
rior soldiership. Here, if ever, the enemy
might well hope to exemplify their boast
ful and sell-complacent conception, vv itn
a force fully three to our one, Hood must
either overwhelm us, or his darling theory
was reversed.
On the afternoon of the 30th day of 2fo
vember, 1864, the whole force of Hood
was burled, as never before were hurled
in battle masses oi living human beings,
rhp pmi nn. taping and courtinp. arjitn.
i th that terrific veil and imnetuositv. and
with certain confidence that with a single
rush we were to be swept from off the
battle-field, or captured crossing, as strap;
B'ers, the little Harpeth river. But when
convenient distance, an opening nre ol
shell and musketry from our lines caused
U1B reoe' noraes io nai. ouisiue toe uasuiy
thrown up intronchments, and amidst the
thickly strewn heaps of their dead and
dying, pause, before making another at
tack. In loss than half an hour, another,
and still another, to the number of eight
distinct, most vigorous and determined
assaults, were made along tbe whole line,
until at 1 1 o'clock at night the last feeble
effort had been made. The stubbornness
and tenacity with which our troops held
the line intact, gave us the welcomo as
surance, that success was in our grnsp, and
tbe enemy much farther from his purpose
tnan wtten ne commenced.
Language cannot convey to tho mind
the faintest idea of that terrible conflict,
nor c m tne mo.st imagination pic-
ture a morn terrible struggle, than occur
red during those few hours, when tbe
chivalry ot the veteran troops of the South
attempted to annihilates a command
weak in numbers but irresistiblo in
purpose. Who now alive, then a par
ticipant in the battle or JTrankhn,
with its mighty surging to nnd froof fierce
contending elements, with tho deafen
clash ot musEetry, and the still louder
roar of cannonading thunder will not re
member with what hopes and fears alter
nately, at each successive charge of the
enemy, he watched for sign of success or
defeat Yet the darkness of the night of
fered no obstacle to the continuation of
the battle. There was an incentive in the
rebel ranks to carry on the fiirht for rjosi
tion as long as there was courage to fight
and this was met on the Federal side by a
spirit of bravery, rising to inspiration, to
oppose as long as there was hope in resist
ance. In truth it may be said, that in no
battle during the late war were there
more determined and persistent charges,
such rapid succession, as were
made by the rebels on our lines
the battle of Franklin. As an evidence
that terrific conflict, the report of the
enemv shows over twelve general officers
killed, wounded or captured, and a loss of
men the most disastrous to Mood s com
mand. This was undoubtedly the greatest
and severest punishment ever received by
reoeis in a single oattie.
On this glorious field our corps achieved
immortal honor, while our gallant leaders.
Schotield, Cixand Stanly, nobly won their
knightly spurs, and added new laurels to
their already illustrious brows. The only
sorrow which can dim tho eye, in looking
back to our glorious triumphs on this and
other well fought fields, is the snd recollec
tion that thousands of our brave comrades
have rendered up their lives a sacrifice to
their devotion to our country. And while
their genial faces are now missed from
among us, their honored bones Test be
neath the green fields of Tennessee,Georgia
the Carolines, whose soil has been en
riched by their patriotic blood. On every
return of this day let us cherish their hal
memory, and send forth our warm
est sympathies everywhere to the maimed
disabled heroes who still linger in life
enjoy their well-earned laurels.

A curious illustration, of the way in
which both parties endorse the President's
message is afforded by the following para

A gentleman yesterday asked Sena

just suits me." " Soon after, the same

liked it "Romarkably well ; it's just the

Mrs. Jane G.JSwisshelve writes to the
Chicago Republican the following de
scription of the way, at Washington, in
which female clerks transact business
Some Honorable Senator or Bepresen
tative has a female friend without visible
means of support. : He sets ber a pl.ee,
and she makes her appearance, perhaps
a little piece of painted impertinence,
who might have ber n stowed away in the
catacombs, in the days of Pharaoh, lor all
anyone can tell of her age. but who
studiously assumes the airs of a miss of
sixteen. Her wrinkles are filled out witi
pipe clay, or some other kind of light-
colored mud ; her eyebrows ara made of
black lead or lampblack, or something in
that line : her hair is dyed until it is dead
enough to satisfy any respectable under
taker of the propriety of burial ; and one
wonders that she does not add a setting
of green leaves to the mngneta-colored
roses on ber thin cheeks. She comes trip
ping in on tbe toes nf her inbnitesimal
gaiters, gets off her things, and displays
head which reminds one of a drop chan
delier trimmed for a ball and unuergoin
the process of dusting, while her pins,
chains, bracelets, frills, and other fixings
would set up a tin-box pedlar in trade.
She establishes herself at her table, opens
her basket, gets out ber beads, and goes
to counting and stringing; "one, two,three,
four, and then a larger one; one, two,
three, four, and a knot j" for you see, she
is a philanthropist, add kindly instructs
the lady at the next table in the mysteries
of this becoming and lady-like employ
ment The superintendent gets fidgety,
and brings this interesting toiler in lite
workshop a piece of writing to copy. The
lady looks injured, and as the superinten
dent is, of course, a Southern gentleman.
who has been selected lor that place wit
special reference to his amiability, be feels
like "a horrid wretch." The dainty little
hands take up the pen and the dainty lit
tle brain keeps on "one, two, three, four,
and a large one -ono, two, three, four, an
a loop. "Loop. I es. ilee pardon I
said "knot," but it is "a loop" which comes
after the second four. .
The writing finished, it is sfitlt off by
messenger, and presently a clerk appears
with it in his hand. He looks weary, bas
found a mistake, and is directed to the
little bead-mongar, who drops her hands
in her lap and her Bead rm ber lett snout
dor, cocks her right eye at him like a Ca
nary making prognostications about the
weather, says something silly, and the
poor man begins to scratch his head. The
conference lasts some time. The man re
tires baffled, and swearing " not loud but
deep, the other ladies exchange glances
and smiles, or perhaps see nothing wrong,
while not one begins to comprehend the
"deep damnation" of the whole affair, or
to know that then and there every woman
in tne room " lelt flat and richly deserv
ed so to tall.
Another, pure as a New England frost,
" bright as a bntton," active as a bee, does
as much work in a month, and does it as
well as any man in the department, but
her book is wanted for reference. She
wants to surprise some friend with a pair
of socks foi- a new baby ; and while her
book is gone, whips out her knitting and
goes nimbly to work. Some clerk comes
into the room, goes out and reports that
the women in that room do nothing but
knit.
Still another comes sailing in about 91
o'clock, gets off her traps ; sinks into her
cnair witn tiie air oi a willow wand crack
ed in the middle; languidly asks some one
to call a servant ; sends said servant with
her compliments, to the head of the bureau
for the loan of his morning paper reads it
with a running comment, loud enough
to be heard all over that room and in the
one adjoining, oh the housa to rent, the
late appointments and removals ; tells
who built the house for sale on such
street and who lived in it at such a time
fives an inventory of their furniture and
istory of their family in its lateral and
collateral branches ; finds who is dead and
who married, and does as much for their
genealogical trees: begins writing at 101.
but keeps up the stream of small talk until
some other lady is through with her morn
ing paper ; when she reads that gets sev
eral new texts, and goes on with the com
mentary until 2 or 2 J o'clock, when, being
quite worn out by her day s labor, sire
gracefully retires. Ot course, she is one
of those favored mortals who can trace
some root of their family tree back to
some one of those excellent women who
came to the Old Domion, originally, as
exenange ior tobacco, and whose descend
ants wear the title of ' F. F. V. " with
such proud satisfaction. Of course, she is
one of those Government employees who
snrug .. tneir nign-snouiderca dignity,
and elevate tneir aristocratic noses
at the sight of -'Lincoln's rabble," t. e.Union
soldiers, and are shocked at the immoral
ities introduced by strangers, i. e.: North
ern people, into Washington, Which has
been so transformed by the' vandals, that
a native-born gentleman can no longer sell
his own baby, when it gets old enough, in
order to gratify his lady friend with a
drive behind a pair of fast horses. As she
is "a law unto herself," and her fine lady
airs make her monarch of all she sur
veys, is it a wonder that other women im
itate her, and that a very few such do
much to disorganize the working force of
department.
There is yet another cla.-s of appointor's
:the lady who nmr-t scb the clerk for
whom she is recording or copying, and
wuo wncn ne comes, strikes a baint Ag
nes attitude, folds her hands meekly,
draws her lips to a "prunes, prism, and
potato" pucker, turns up her eye like a
duck in a thunder storm, or a juvenile
bovine in tne act ot becoming veal, makes
pun and an impression, or several puns
and as many impressions, grows witty
tells the unfortunate man that she dream
ed last night she was married to him, is
satisfied, subsides in a simper, while there
no ono with tho ncrvo and authority to
order hcrout of tho room, nnd sco that she
ncvor returns.
Palmerston Apologizes to Butler.
The Washington Hrpubltcan says that
Uen. iSutler has a lettorof apology written
him by Lord Piilmcrston not very long
before the lattor's death. When Gen.
Butler issued his celebrated Order No. 28,
J ew Orleans, known as the " woman or
der," he was denounced by tho rebel chief
tain Beauregard as a "beast," which epi
thet was not only echoed all over the
South, but was adopted in spirit by Lord
Palmerston, late Prime Minister of En
gland. Shortly after tbe noble Lord him
self bad a personal experience of the un
pleasantness of scandal, a story of his re
lations, with a Mrs. Kane, not much to
the credit of either, having become spread
abroad. General Butler having heard of
this, wrote a letter to a distinguished gen
tlemen on -the other side of tho Atlantic,
which he alluded to the fact that Pal
merston bad repeated the dirty scandal
about his (Butler's) "woman order;" that
perhaps tbe learned Premier was not
aware that the order which, in consequence
the beastly conduct of the rebel women
New Orleans toward the Federal troops
became a military necessity, wag copied
verbatim from an order of the City Coun
of London, during a time of peace I
also remarked that probably his Lord
ship had begun to learn bow good it was
be slandered. Upon reading (jcneral
Butler s letter, which embraced all the
facts about the misconduct of women,
making Order No. 28 a necessity, Lord
Palmerston wrote a letter ot apology to
General Butler, which the latter still
holds.
We wonder whether the late "noble
Lord " would ever have written that let
of apology if he had not been slander
himself. Would it not have be en more
maganimous if his Lordship had taken
back his contemptible slanderous remark
upon General Butler tn the place where
made it on the floor of Jr arliament :
