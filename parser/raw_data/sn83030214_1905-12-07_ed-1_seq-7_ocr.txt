PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
What the Press of the Country Says
of the Document.
"THE SQUARE DEAL."
From The New-York Mail.
As a State paper it Is a graphic, highly informing
and singular appealing implication of the doctrine
of "the sauare deal." Mr. Roosevelt, at least, as
th« message again reveals him. la n standing refu
tation of tho familiar charge that the American
political genius is able to provide for the correction
of an evil, but not for its prevention. There Is
foresight as well as opportunism In his statecraft.
PATRIOTIC.
From The New-York Sun.
It might have been shorter, but it could not have
been more painstaking in exposition, more char
acteristic in phraseology or mote patriotic, both in
Intent and in tone. "
DIRECT AND FORCEFUL.
From The Newark News.
The document is marked by directness and fores,
with sufficient of that urn en and philosophic
sense- with which our President strengthens his
utterances and vindicates hi* title as political
thinker. If there is but little that is novel or
illuminating in his interpretation <.f salient needs",
it is because his convictions have been so thor
oughly embodied by himself and his accredited
mouthpieces hitherto that it leaves no room for
such treatment. Up does, however, what is need
ful, offers a vigorous summary and a convincing
rationale. <• ( •
MIGHTILY UKB ROOSEVELT.
From The Hartford Courant.
President. Roosevelt's message is probably the
longest yet written by any President. It Is, we
venture, to say. altogether unlike the message of
any of his predecessors, and mightily like Theodore
Roosevelt. There is not a line of tabulated statis
tical information: all the; deadwood of depart
mental repetition is cut out. and the whole paper
bristles with virile ideas, presented with the au
thor's characteristic vigor of statement. It ■would
be difficult to find a bettor Illustration of the
splendid sort of citizenship which Roosevelt rep
resents than this revelation lie makes of himself.
HIS INTENSE 7.8A1>.
From The Boston Advertiser.
If anybody anywhere needed proof of the intense
zeal of President Roosevelt toward reform of va
ried kinds, that proof would be found in the
message. No matter is too small to catch the
Presidents attention and to draw out bis urgent
recommendation for changed methods. No affair
is so big that ho is afraid to handle it.
CONSPICUOUSLY CONSERVATIVE.
From The Providence Journal.
This present comprehensive presentation of his
views to Congress and the country, on practically
ail the topics that could fittingly be brought within
the official field of vision of a wideawake Chief
Magistrate, is' conspicuously marked by a con
servatism of statement, a judicial breadth of out
look, a cautiousness of suggestion and a prudence
of recommendation that make it seem dull by con
trast with what we have iearned to expect from
Mr Roosevelt. This, however, casts no necessary
discredit upon him. That ther* is almost no new
idea In the message is a natural consequence of
the frequency and freedom with which he has pub
licly discussed the questions of national interest
all through the last year.
*AS TO ITS LENGTH.
From The Rochester Post-Express.
Those who are inclined to criticise the length of
the document must remember that Presidents'
messages have not grown In proportion to the
growth of the country.
ONK FIGHT AT A TIME.
From The Baltimore Kews.
Mr Roosevelt is going to make no tight on the
tariff This will doubtless excite a good deal of
sarcastic criticism In some quarters, but we have
never been able to pee upon what principle a i resi
dent was to be expected to fight two fights at once,
when one is quite big enough to engage all the
energies of the strongest ami most resolute of
men.
THE MORAL INTERESTS.
From Th° Buffalo Commercial.
One of the secrets of the President's success as .1
leader of men is his Intense interest in the causes
he espouses, hacked by an insistent temper And
the causes that interest him mosl arc moral ones.
The tone that chiefly characterizes this state paper
Is thnt of tiv teacher and preacher of civic nght
eousness.
HIS COMMANDING POSITION
From The Philadelphia Press.
Neither the national legislature nor the nation , an
forget that he occupies an international position
held by no President in our day and by but
two lti our history. He commands the confidence
and support of his lellow countrymen at home and
he enioys th» rrspect and admiration of the world
abroad." Nothing that he says on any subject— end
few are omitted from his encyclopaedic message
put has a. weight and authority with the vast mass
of the ljitifl not to Iw neglected and tv be reckoned
with by all who challenge- h!s pol
Si IME CONTRASTS.
From The Springfield Republican.
The contrasts with the conventional Presidential
message are many and sharp. «Jo back to thoso
messages nnd note the heavy dignit;- of literary
style. Mr. Roosevelt cannot be so tied down. Note
the mass of figures with which a Republican Presi
dent would .set forth th* fatness of mnterial pros
perity, and with which a Democratic President
would' demonstrate the need of economy a'i.l fiscal
reform. Mr. Roosevelt has no use for figures, and
hardly one will be found In this record breaking
long message. Individual character, honesty, jus
tice civic courage and square dealing— what are flg
ures of pounds and bushels and dollars as the
measure nn<l assurance of prosperity compared
with qualities such as those? Yep. there are many
contrasts, and some of them at least are of the
klnci to make us thankful for Roosevelt.
FOR A BUST SESSION.
From The Philadelphia Inquirer.
The President has cenninly mapped out plenty
of work for Congress, and hus given many hints ;\%
to how it should be done.
AS TO RAILWAY RATES
From The Boston Transcript.
Briefly. h« defines his proposal as not giving the
Interstate < Commerce Commission power to initiate,
or originate rates generally, but to regulate a rate
already fixed or originated by the railroads, upon
complaint and after investigation. This purpose Is
not essentially different from that which inspired
his recommendation of last year, but he advances
his ideas now much more boldly and more clearly
than he did then.
FRENCH COMMENT ON MESSAGE.
The "Temps" Expresses Surprise at Refer
ence to the Monroe Doctrine.
Paris, Dec. -The "Temps," In a leading article
this evening discussing President Roosevelt's mes
sage to Congress, says:
The Monroe Doctrine is no longer confined to
forbidding Europe to conquer or annex South
American territory, but is also extended against
the simpl° seizure of custom houses, which is tlw
sole m»ans of effective reprisal against delinquent
Southern republics. President Roosevelt did ;iot
present this objection three years ago against the
triple action of Germany, Great Britain and Italy
against Venezuela. Why has he chosen the mo
ment when France may be obliged to adopt meas
ures of the same kind against Venezuela?
The "Journal de? Debats" also comments on the
extension of the Monroe Doctrine.

SEPARATION VOTED.
French Senate Passes Bill Dividing
Church and State.
Parip. D-c. 6.— The Senate to-day, after a
long debmo. adopted the hill for the separation
of church and state by a vote of ISI to 102.
Tlie vote was announced amid enthusiastic.
scenes and cries of "Loner live the republic!"
and "Lrfjng: livo liberty!"
This Is the final parliamentary stage of the
bill, which will be promulgated in "The Official
Journal" to-morrow, when it will become Im
mediately effective. The Council of Stato will
devote three months to the framing of the ad
ministrative details.
The action of the Vatican regarding the law
has not yet been definitely announced. The
French clergy, while opposing the measure, ap
pear to be disposed to conform to the new sys
tem.
The public worship budget of I'.XtOt will be
reduced from $3,400,000 to nearly $6,800,000
consequent on the gradual diminution of the
salaries p.iid by the state to the clergy.
The fundamental principles of the bill insure
entire liberty of conscience respecting religion,
with restrictions concerning the exercise or re
ligion which are intended to preserve public
order.
In the future the state will b» entirely free
from connection with all religious sects.
FUNERAL OF LOUIS VICTOR WINTER.
The. funeral of Louis Victor Winter occurred yes
terday afternoon at No. 17 Sd-ave., New-Brighton.
Staten Island, the residence of his father. William
Winter, of The Tribune. Only a few persona were
present. The remains had been cremated. The
ashes were buried in the Silver Mount Cemetery,
Staten Island, beside the grave of Mr. Winter's
second son, Arthur. Professor Albert H. Smyth,
conducting the funeral services, spoke as follows:
The body of Louis Victor Winter, who died in
Southern California last February, was cremated at
Los Angeles, and his ashes.- brought home for
burial.— are contained in this casket, which now
we place in the grave. He died in his thirty-second
year, after a long illness and much suffering, en
dured with fortitude and patience. He. was not
known to many persons, for his disposition was
exceptionally reticent, and, for the most part, lie
dwelt alone; but he was deeply loved by those thai
knew him. and he is deeply mourned. It was nat
ural that he should be loved, for his mind was
noble, his character wag manly, his temperament
was sweet, and his manners wore gentle. He wore
with modesty the honors of scholarship: he used
with grace a line literary talent: he acted with
perfect Integrity in every relation of life: and he
maintained a Steadfast spirit In adversity and sor
row. His courage was magnificent and his sim
plicity whs beautiful. His early death blighted
much hope and extinguished much promise.
Cut Is t : i* branch that mipht have grown full straight.
An.l bum*d is Apollo's laurel bough.
Standing beside this grave, let us take courage,
remembering his example. He is at rest. Our
duties vet bind us to this world. The monition of
death is always the same— fidelity and constancy
in doing right, and readiness for the inevitable, end.
Let. us also trust the intuitions of the soul, the
analogies of nature, and the promises of religion —
looking forward to that immortality of the spiritual
life In which "there shall he no more death, neither
sorrow nor crying, neither any more pain." Earth
to earth: ashes to ashes: dust to dust.
When Joy no lotifTT soothes or cheers
And ?*ci th' h<n«» that threw
A moment's sparkle o'er our tears
[a dimm'd am! vanish' d, too,
O, who could war life's stormy d«om
Did not Thy wing of love
Come brightly waft in* through the gloom
Our p«>Bi"e- branch, from above?
Then Borrow, touch'd by 'Hire, grows bright
With more thon rapture's ray.—
As larkr\p=s shows u« worlds or light

NUISANCE NOT ENDFD.
Too Much Trouble Realhf to Refuse
S peculators' Tickets.
Thos- who fancy that the decision handed down
■i i Albany on Tuesday in the appealed case
of a speculator against the proprietors of the
Knickerbocker Theatre is going to have any visible
effect on the speculator nuisance in this city will
probably rind themselves mistaken. What the de
cision does Is to set forth in unmistakable terms
the right of the theatre to refuse tickets at the
door whicii have been purchased of speculators.
But that this will mean any general refusing of
■uch tickets st the doors in future nia> he doubted.
When a theatr>- sets out to refuse such tickets—
really sets out to -and does not merely stick tip a
board on the sidewalk threatening to -there Ifl al
ways trouble. The theatre has to employ watchers
on the sidewalk and extra men have to be at the
door. There is sure every night to be some Fort
of a fight— art least a verbal fight— either between
the speculators and th* theatre people or bet worn
pur 'ha sera to whom admission has been denied and
th managers who find a considerable expense
and a great deal of trouble, and it is quit«
as annoying to patrons as the mere presence, un
moiested, of thf speculators outside. Th" public,
so th.- managers say. rlo not take sufficient Inter
est in the cause to earn to witness battles while
they are entering (he house.
One of tlv shrewdest and oldest managers in
New-York, chaiics Burnham, said last nieht: "To
flslit the speculators means to lose trade. Wo
don't like them any better than anybody els». but
even .hough this decision (rives us the right to
refuse the seats they sHi. it won't mean that we
will refuse any more than in the past, for every
il efforts have he- n made to refuse such
tickets the public has complained of th 9 rows In
the lobby and about the door. It has hurt the bus-
Inesa of the theatre. The speculators are still li
censed !>y the city— they still have a right to s"-ll
tickets o'ltside. The only way to stop them Is to
take away their licenses. And until that is done
they will continue. That is the real root of the
matter, and if anybody really wajits to see the
speculators abolished he must work down at the
city Hall. 1 '
There has bpon some debate regarding the bear-
Ing of this decision on the Metcalf case, and the
managers who are opposed to "Life's " critic see in
it much that is favorable to their contention that
they had a right to shut out the critic. The de
cision affirms the right of the theatre to rim its
business as it sees fit. they say. On the other
hand, the decision specificially treats only of those
tickets which were sold first at the box office and
then resold in a place not sanctioned by the man
agers. Mr. Metcalf bought his tickets directly of
the hex offices. Furthermore, he is charging con
spiracy against a group of managers, and. of
course, this decision has nothing to do with a con
spiracy case.
G. F. BAEk STOPS PASSES.
Reading and Jersey Central Affected
— Movement May Spread.
Philadelphia. Dec. 6.— George F. Baer, ptesident
of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company
ami of the Central Railroad Company of New-
Jersey, announced to-night that those roads would
is^ue an anti-pass order similar to the one made
public yesterday by the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company. He further stated that he would us a
director of the Ivehlgh Valley Railroad Company
tine his Influence with the officials of that road to
follow a similar course. The order on the Reading
and Jersey Central will take effect on January 1.
Official announcement on the part of the Lehigh
Valley Railroad Is expected from President Thomas
at any time. President Baer says:
T intend that the order shall he carried out to the
very letter. Ever since I have been connected with
railroads I have been opposed to the promiscuous
giving of parses. The courtesy has been shame
fully abused ever since it has been in vogue, and
now is the time to stop it. The Pennsylvania Rail
road started the reform, and I am glad to have the
opportunity to follow. I urged this action several
ago. but none of the other companies seemed
willing to Join in the movement. In Issuing the
order there will be no distinction made, and every
person not identified with the Reading or Jersey
Central will be cut oft at the end of this year.
As the Pennsylvania is interested In the Baiti
tnoie and Ohio. < Tiesapeake and Ohio and the Nor
folk nnd Western railroads, these lines also are
.] to IssjUe anti-pass orders. The Pennsyl
vania order, it was learned to-night, will also apply
to ill Pennsylvania lines west of Pittsburg.

J. S. METCALFE NOT AFFECTED.
James W. Osborne, counsel for James S. tfet
esjfe, of "Life," said yesterday that the tlecision
of the Court ii' Appeals against the theatre ticket
speculators would In no war affect the case of
Mr. Metcalfe aga;.>st the theatre managers who
combined to shut him out of the theatres and pre
vent him from following his vocation as a the
atrical critic. Mr. Osborne added:
We admit that any theatre manager has the
right to keep any particular person out of his
theatre, hut we contend that when several theatre
managers make nn agreement to keen the same
pers">n out in order to <lej>rive him of his means
of livelihood they commit a criminal conspiracy.
Any butcher mlgh' refuse to sell meat to me. but
If all the butchers should form an agreement to
prevent me from buying meat they would be guilty
of a criminal conspiracy. I believe the courts
will take this view of the case of Mr. Metcalfe.

According- to the printed Interview, Mme. Bern*
hardt derided I'anada and Canadian.". She said
«'snada was not a nation, and was behind the
timfp in everything. Its population was a mixture
of English, Irish, Scotch, and French Canadians
and IroquoK and that many who called themselves
French Canadians had not a drop of French blond
in their veins. They were the descendants of the
Iroqijois savages. She also said that Canada had
no public men. no artists or scientists. She only
heard of Sir "Wilfred l-;mri»r yesterday, and said
Canada had made little progress in agriculture,
and that French Canadians were dominated by
their clergy. She also reflected i>n the students
of Montreal.
