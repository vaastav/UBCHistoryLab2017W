ST. CLAIRSVILLE, OHIO:
Thursday Morning, Dec. 16, 1S6.
The Democratic State Central Cork-1
mittee at their meeting at Columbus
last Thursday determined to hold their
next State Convention on tlie first of
June. The Eight of January is played
out, as a time far holding Democratic!
Conventions.
The President's message meets with
universal approval. The Republican
press regard it as a moddel of clearness
and perspicuity, and its recommenda
tions as wise and statesmanlike. The
Democratic papers of respectability and
character concede its merits and affirm
that it is a better message than they
expected to get from the President.
THE NORTHWEST RAILROAD.
We are somewhat surprised at the
general favor with which our renewal
of the question of building a Rail rood
from the river via St. Clairsville, Flifsh
iug and Freeport to Uhrichsville has
been received. From the manner in
which leading men here and at other
points along the proposed route talk(
and express a willingness to subscribe,
we are of the opinion that a well organ
ized and thoroughly pressed effort would
result in the construction of the Road.
It would certai&iy in the end make a
paying road, and would pass through
one of the richest portions of Eastern
Ohio. It Will be seen by items in our
local columns, copied from the Nolle
County Republican, than the Marietta,
Caldwell and Washington road is likely
to be pressed to a rapid completion.
That road will ultimately find a northern
and eastern connection by going down
Stillwater cieek to Uhrichsville and
tapping the Pan Handle, and the road
contemplated from Uhrichsville via New
Philadelphia to the north. If capital
enough could be raised to put the work
under contract from the mouth of Little
McMahon's Creek to Freeport in Har
rison county, a distance of about twenty
five miles, there is no doubt but the
other end of it would be completed at
a very early day. We believe this road
can be built, if the stock now owned by
the County in the Central Ohio Railroad
was transferred to it, and such a transfer
is practicable, and would prove in the
end profitable. Shall the Road be made?
Friends of improvement answer.
At a meeting of the Republican State
Central and;Excutive Committees, at
Columbus last Wednesday, resolutions
were passed congratulating t he people of
Ohio on the Republican triumph in the
State and thanking the Executive Com
mittee for their efficient service, the
following was unanimously adopted :
Resolved, That it is highly important
that county central committees be elect
ed by the several counties at the time of
holding the convention for the selection
of delegates to the State convention, and
that the State Executive Committee are
hereby instructed to issue a circular to
the several county committees, setting
forth the need for this uniform practice,
and requesting them to insert in their
call for a county convention the an
nouncement that the County Central
Committee will be selected at that time.
AS that part of the President's mes
sage referring to the modification of the
revenue laws was somewhat obscured by
errors in the telegraphic report, we re
publish the corrected copy, as follows:
"The subject of the tariff and inter
rt nal taxation will necessarily receive
your attention. The revenues of the
s country are greater than the require
Ml. - meats, and may with safety be reduced,
Mr but as the funding of the debt, in a four
or a four and a half per cent, loan would
reduce the annal current expense large
ly, thus, after funding, justifying a great
er reduction, I suggest a postponement
of the question until the next meeting of
( Congress. It may be advisable to modi
fy taxation ami tariff in instances where
unjust and burdensome discriminations
are made by the present laws, but a gen
eral revision of the laws regulating this
subject, I recommend the postponement
of for the present.
"I also suggest the renewal of the tax
on incomes, but at a reduced rate, say of
three per cent., aud this tax to expire in
three years. With the funding of the
National debt, as here suggested, I feel
safe in saying that the taxes and revenue
from imports may be reduced safely from
sixty to eight millions per annum at
once, and still further reduced from
year ta year, as the resources of the
country are developed."
Flushing Correspondence.
Having noticed in the last number of
the St. Clairsville Gazette, an article by
some fellow styling himself " Citizen, "
written in reply to our communication
in a late number of the Chronicle,
we thought it might not be amiss briefly
to refer to it at this time.
WeTire glad to see that our worthy
" Citizen " has taken some pains to give
to the people of Belmont County a more
detailed and betterauthenticated history
of the rise aud progress of the town of
Flushing jban we did, and we commend
him for it!?
It was notour business to give statis
tics and we dare nothing for his com
ments upon that part of our local; we
may say however, that his statement in
regard to buildings is false, for every
man who has lived in the town for
twenty years, knows that not more than
a dozen have been erected in that time.
It needs only a slight examination of
his criticism to show how lightly he has
touched our subject. He has endeavored
by pointing out what he considers false
hoods in our statistical history to turn
the minds of the people from our portrait
of hi friends and their dark sin which
grinds because it is truth. We have as
much respect for our honored citizen
Jesse Brandenburgh as he has. Yes,
" the old man saw his sons and grand
sons leave our town as soldiers in the
late war, " and now that his locks are
white with age and his tottering foot
steps verging toward the grave, he is
compelled to see them assailed by a
more deadly foe, and one that seeks
their eternal destruction. He will not
thank our "citizen" for sending his
name to the St. Clairsville Gazette as a
" Grogshop " advertisement.
We gave a suffiofhU list of our places of
business to show to the Editor of the
Chronicle and to the world, that we
can not only minister to the bodily com
fort of our-visitors, but that there are
those among us so vile and inhuman
that they delight in destroying their
fellow heings by administering poison.
We wonder that this modern histo
rian forgot the whisky shops, he may
however have omitted them remember
ing that we noticed them under another
name.
His interest in these establishments is
like that of a young man whom we once
met, carrying a whisky bottle, and who
told us that lie had "an interest in a
saloon in New York City," "yes"
replied a bystander "and all others
whenever you can find them."
We wonder too that our thoughtful
" citizen " does not venerate that old
dilapidated building that was once a
schoolhouse, the work of those "worthy
old veterans " and the place whie he
and his children have been taught what
little they ku w. He says it is the only
thing in town he is ashamed of; he is
not even ashamed of himself when he
occasionalhgets so blind from the ef.
fects of his coveted dram that he cannot
see Ills co.nrades who are reeling about
under the same delirium.
He wants to know what there has been
in the career of the Editor of the Gazette
"so Iniquitous and dishonorable to the
county." We would say to our vener
able citizen that he has made his paper
what we called it before "a journal of
rowdyism," an organ for the whisky ring
and not ouly the man who has been,
guilty of illegal traffic in whisky, but
every oue who wished to cover his badge j
of dishonor, naturally seeks and finds a ,
refuge uuder his protecting arm; dis-i
grace to hiscowardly name! Ve repeat
that it was not our business to give sta
liittics, but to show why it is that men
may fearlessly come into our midst and
"scatter woe where Heaven has planted
joy." That there were witnesses sum
moned before that jury whose testimony
if taken and regarded would have in
dicted parties in this town for violation
oflthe liquor law can be proven beyond
a doubt; and our adversary knows that
in these words we speak the sentiments
of our enterprising, temperate and intel
ligent citizens, aud no devices of his can
ever remove the impression from their
minds; they look with shame and con
tempt Upon the cowards whose infamous
action will make drunkards and drunk
ards grave!
And how wHl you who dare with
your poison drug, drain the life blood
from your brother ta one for this foul
crime? Wi.en ihe aged sire with one
foot standing on the other shore raised
to God his leeble voice in behalf of his
wretched son, what will you do for him
that his gray hairs may not go down
with sorrow to the grave? Can you dry
the tears of that weeping mother? or
restore to the monrning widow whatshe
has lost iu the ruin of her husband, the
father of her helpless children? Will
you feed the little ones when they cry
for bread, or raise an answer when they
call their father? And now for the vic
tim who law fouud a drunkards grave,
can you restore to him the breath of life,
or give to God a ransom for his soul?
And will you then pursue your work of
death. Oh wretched men, can facts like
thixs not, move vour hearts of stone?

California Correspondence.
SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., Dec. 4, 1869.
Dear Chronicle: From this sunset
land with all its lovely and attractive
scenery, its energetic people fair wo
men and brave men, our thoughts still
turn to the old places, and to the asso
ciations of by-gone years, and I feel an
almost irresistible desire to give you
some items from this coiHitry.
In many respects there have been
wondrous changes here siuce the well
remembered time twenty years ajro
when so many of our friends went out
from among us and set their faces toward
the setting sun the land of sunshine
and of gold. A beautiful city now stands
here, where then clustered a few U-nte
aud miserable shanties among the Sand
hills. The sails of many lands now
whiten this beautiful bay, and the finest
Steamers in the world are busy plying
between this and Asiatic Ports, empty
ing upon these shores thousands of a
heathen people. The streetsare thronged
with an active, energetic and intelligent
people, enjoying every luxury of life
which monej can buy, or taste conceive.
But unchanged are the lofty moun
tain peaks we see across the bay. The
ocean still lashes with unwearied wash
the shores of the great sea, th broad
valleys still bask in the same warm sun
shine, and the generous soil yields up
its products with the same lavish hand.
One who has never visited this coast
cannot imagine tne difference in every
respect which exists between the cli
mate here and that of home. I write
now by au open window into which the
warm sunlight floods the room as it only
does at home in June. Across the street
is a beautiful garden and lawn in which
are growing a countless variety of flow
ers in full bloom. An oleander grove
defies the climate. A hedge of lemon
geranium six feet high and so thick that
a bird could not fly through it screens
the back garden, and is covered with
flowers. A huge fuschia is trained over
the pillar of the veranda, aud its sprigs
hang thickly studded with blossoms.
Down street yonder two blocks away
is a fruit stand on the side-walk where
you can find pears, apples, grapes, straw
berries, orauges, figs and linies, fresh,
large and jucy. In the markets are new
potatoes, green peas, new radishes and
onions, lettice, and everything of early
spring. In fact it is their spring time
here. The grass is springing green
flowers enamel the meadows, the past
ure lands and the roadside, and fill the
air with richest perfume- It is hard to
realize that you are shivering over fires
at home, but when we glance at Mt.
Diavolo's lofty peak across the bay and
see it covered with snow, we read of the
coiy fireside: of home, and know that
the people of this chosen land are de
nied one precious boon the, winter fire
side. I had a call the other day from Mr.
McElroy, formerly of St. Clairs.ille,
who was a printer in the Chronicle of
fice years ago when the writer hereof
was a "toddlin wee thing" and had only
learned the pie making part of the print
ing business at the office, and the pie
eating part of the business of life at the
bouse. Many of your old subscribers
will remember McElroy who used to
carry the papers through the country
on the traditional black pony of the
office, before cross mail lines were estab
lished. He is now running to Panama
on the steam packets, and is in the Cus
toms department.
Another gentleman from St. Clairs
ville is here, Judge M. P. Deady, of
Oregon. He is holding court in this city,
and enjoys a splendid reputation on the
bench throughout all the Pacific States. 1
He still remembers his home of twenty
years ago, and talks of the old times
with great pleasure. He is favorably
mentioned for the new U. S. Circuit
Judgeship for this circuit, and I sincere
ly trust he may get it, for he is in every
way qualified for the place. Then he is
also a worthy graduate of our dear old ,
village, and toward all such my heart
goes out wherever they are scattered up
and down the world.
I would advise every body that wants '
to take a pleasure trip to come here.
Take a ride over the Pacific Railroad
see the boundless prairies it traverses, 1
and the dizzy heights it cli in lis look up
at the peaks of the snow clad mountains,
crawl along their rocky sides and look .
down into their awful gorges, rnd then ,
go to the verge and look off on the waste
of waters and see where the sun sets,
and you cannot help but go home with '
broader ideas of our great country, her
resources aud her future. Old fogies at
home hardly believe in the Pacific Rail- ,
road yet, and those who do, think it a ,
great risk of life to pass over it.
Hear my experience ! We left Omaha
at noon on Thursday, and reached here
on Sunday evening in time for supper '
76 hours. This we did without change
of cars, and it was the most comfortable
ride of my life. Our meals were served
on the train while in motion, and were
in every respect first class. In our sa- ,
loon car was every thing needed for '
comfort. We had a large rich toned
parlor organ, from which we had excel
lent music, and from the summit of the
mountains we made the startled echoes
ring to the melody of the grand old
Doxology, sung "with the spirit and
with the understanding."
There is nothing insecure, and no i
thing carelessly done on the road but
on the contrary it is the best railroad I
ever traveled over, and you know I
have traveled over many In the East
mm States.
To see California thoroughly one must
take two or three months, and even
then he will go home to learn that he ,
had left unseen many beautiful and in
teresting spots. If weather permits I '
shall try to see it in detail, and leave as
little of it unseen as possible. To do
this takes a good deal of time, and I re- 1
gard it as time well spent. In some of
these wanderings I may scribble you ;
some notes of travel.
Do not think from the gushing man
ner in which I praise the Pacifto Road
that I was a dead head over it. for I as
sure you I paid my passage to the ut
B. R. C.
The Cardiff Giant.
From the Chicago Tribune.
The Eastern States, particularly .New,
York, has been excited for a consider- t
able time over the discovery of a petri- I
tied giant in the vicinity of Syracuse. It
has been a matter of wonder, this "Car-
diff giant," as it is called, and it attract- j
ed the attention of scientific men and of i
the public generally. The Colossus of i
Rhodes, between whose legs ships of the I
largest tuuage, aud with the tallest :
masts, could sail, was nothing compared l
to this modem man of stone, or what-
ever he is made of. He was put down t
as the eighth wonder of the world a t
genuine wonder, with nothing bogus s
about it.
People enjoyed the delasion, and there
was a chance of speculators and show- t
men making a fortune out of it. for one i
of them paid $15,000 for one-sixteenth
of the delusion which would make the .
entire delusion worth $240,000. That is t
a uice cash value for a delusion: indeed, ;
so valuable is it that it is . Imost cruel to j
dispel it and prove the whole affair a j
successful hoax and a monster humbug. ,
Yet such is the fact, for, like Barnum's ,
woolly horse, this "petrified cuss," as t
he has been irreverently called was ,
made to order, and made very well, be- s
cause he was made in Chicago. We can ;
manufacture antiquities as easily almost ,
as we make pork out of hogs. If the J
East wants any goods in that line, they
can be procured in Chicago, without c
difficulty, and pretty cheap at that. '
There is very little doubt that the whole
thing is one of the hngest "sells" ever ,
perpetrated on an intelligent and dis- (
criminating public.
The following article, written to the '
Dubuque Times, by a gentleman living ,
at Fort Dodge, Iowa, throws more light ,
on the mystery than it can bear: ,
"About the 6th of June, 1868, two men
came to this place and stopped at the St. !j
Charles Hotel, registering as George
Hall, of Binghamton, New York, and
H. B. Martin, of Boston, Massachusetts. "
For a number of weeks after their ar- .
rival here, their movements seemed to
be of a very suspicious character. They J
would wander about town, apparently ,
with no definite object in view, telling ,
no one anything about their business, J
or what brought them here, and in fact,
their mission to this place seemed, to all
who saw and watched them, a mysteri
ous one. ,
"A few weeks after their appearance '
in our midst, they purchased an acre of
gypsum land of John McDermott, pay- '
irig for the same $100. They then bought 1
lumber enough at an expense of seventy- a
five dollars, to build a shanty near the a
quarry. After everything was ready, c
they employed men and went to work c
opening the gypsum quarry for the pur- f
pose, as they said, of getting out a hand- '
some piece of aypsum, to take to New '
York, to be there placed on exhibition.
After working a number of days in this 1
quarry, they discovered that they would c
be unable to get out as large and perfect 1
a block as they desired. They then 8
-.hanged their base of operations, and .',
went to work on section thirty-three, '
where they found a piece that suited
their purpose. They then, with great "
difficulty, loaded it on a wagon, and
started for the railroad with it, a dis- '
tance of forty-five miles, aud after going 9
a short distance, the wagon broke down. a
Hall and Martin then went to work and
dressed the stone down to a length of
eleven feet and three inches, and a
breadth of three feet and two inches, v
They then succeeded in getting it to the (
railroad without much further trouble i
beyond breaking down one or two t
bridges. c
"Now, these are facts that caa be a
vouched for by hundreds of our citizens, i
and the men who assisted in getting out c
the monster stone. In view of the fact r
that the so called giant which was dis- t
covered near Syracuse had been pro- t
nounced no'hing more than a gypsum t
statue and measured just ten feet two (
inches and a half from the crown of the I
baud to the hollow of the foot ; and from f
point to point of suoulder, three feet ; a
and about twenty-six inches through, o
and that this same Hall was seen near C
.Se well's, on whose larm the statue was i
found, the same day that an iron-bound t
box was seen on the way near Newell's, o
drawu by four horses, and that he was o
seen next morning about two miles from C
there, his clothe all muddy ,aud having b
to all apperance been out ail night, we (
can come to no other conclusiou than
that the Syracuse or Cardiff giant was a
manufactured out of Fort Dodge gyp- t
mm, aud that it was buried where it t
was fouud by this same Hall, who was I.
here. v
"Our theory is this : Hall and Martin b
came here and got the gypsum block 'I
out, took it to Chicago, where it was t
carved aud worked into a statue. It was
then boxed and taken to Binghamton, ii
or some other point, and, thence by wa- o
gou, to Newell's farm, where it was o
fo.ind. Hall was seen in Chicago three t
or four weeks, and still after that, by
Governor Gue' of this place,and a num- t
ber of other persons living here. We o
have a strong suspicion that Colonel c
Wood, formerly of the Chicago Museum, s
is concerned in the'sell,' else why should , ,
he happeu to be around just at the time $
when they were digging the poor 'giant'
out , and a showman was needed to ex
hibit it." j,
The man who carved the man out of r
the block of gypsum is in C iicagoto- j
day, aud nothing but his pecuniary iu- t
terest in the stone gentleman prevents ft
him from exposiug the entire joke. He tl
is a cleaver workman, and a smart fel
low generally, and withal a humorous
being. He laughs in his sleeve at the
L'ommotiou he has kicked up. He won
ders, no doubt, that men are so easily
gulled, and thinks the public has not J
cut its eye-teeth yet. By the way he l'
would like au order from the East, or ?
inywhere else foradozeu or two'giants.' !'
He will guarantee that they will be J1
"petrified human beings," and no mis- t:
take, aud wishes to inform bis costomers P
that his wholesale rates are moderate. j:'
If the savants of New York want a "
pure and unadulterated relic of a long- '
gone age. they can invest in the Whea- j"
ton mastodon, which was not made In j'
Chicago, but thousands of years ago
"growed," as Topsy said of herself. a
rhis thing of "selling the world on an
ild stone giant is played out. It is time
the truth was made known and the bub-
bie burst. A nice problem in the rule 11
if three is, if a bogus-stone giant, man- !
u fact u red iu Chicago aud transported to J
New York, is wrrth $240,000, what is 0
the value of a genuine mastodon twenty
two feet long, fifteen feer high and six n
feet broad. That Cardiff fellow is no
man at all, and never was anything but b
i stony and hardened impostor. r
How We are Reducing the Public Debt.
Democratic papers ganerally are clamor- tl
ius for au economical administration of
our public affairs. We are doing ptetty
well in that direction as the following
figures from the N. Y. Tribune demon- s;
Urate. They show not only economy
in the public service but also au honest

It is conceded on all sides that ihd :l
regular Republican ticket has succeed
ed in Texa9. An exchange says: t.
The new Governor, Gen. E. J.Davis, :
is a native Southerner of whom his ti
State and party may well be proud. "D
Wheu forced to fly from Texas, early in tl
the rebellion, for his Union sentiments, h
he went to New Orleaus and reported to t
Glen. Butler, theu in command of that
eity. Instead of seeking for safe con
luct to the North, as inauy of the ref- t
tigees did, he asked for power to go back L
ind raise a regiment. Gen. Butler com-
missioned him, aud Gen. Davis returned '
ind put himself at the head of it force
that did signal service to the country. I"
He is now the first Republican Chief e
