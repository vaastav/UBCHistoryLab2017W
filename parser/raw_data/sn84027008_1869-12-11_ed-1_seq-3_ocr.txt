ease is tho timely uso of a good remedy.
The groat Family Liniment of tho age, for in?
ternal and external use. combined in ono med?

Not since the introduction of modern Che?
mistry and analytical research into the hidden
mysteries of the vegetable kingdom, has there
been discovered a chemical product of such
extraordinary curative powers as tho "Quaker
Liniment;'' this justly celebrated medicino
was discovered aud prepared by a Quaker Doc?
tor, connected with tho naval service of the
country, his practico was confined to those so
verecases which usually result from a sea?
faring life. Rheumatisms, Acute and Chronic,
Colds, Coughs, Cramps, Chilblains, Foyers,
Neuralgia; indeed, all acute disorders requi?
ring prompt and energetic medicine Tho
treatment of these complaints with thc ordi?
nary medicine of tho dav failed to mako a euro
or reliove tho patient. Disappointed and mor?
tified at tho result, and stimulated by the
promptings of a puro humanity for tho suf?
fering, au well as a professional pride, he,
after much labor and study, compounded his
great Liniment, called tho QUAKER LINI?
MENT. This medicino is remarkable for tho
peculiar property it possesses in being an in?
ternal and external remedy at the samo timo,
and differs from all other medicines in its ac?
tion in arresting disease.
It is taken internally for Colds, Coughs,
Consumption, Cramps, Fever and Ague, Head?
ache, Asthma, Dysentery, Colic, Acid Stomach,
Cholera, Cholera Morbus, Sick Stomach, Pains
in tho Stomach, Diarrhoea.

theria, Swelling of the Glands of tho Neck,
Head-ache,Neuralgia, Face-ache, Tooth-acho,
Pains in the Back, on tho Side orin tho Heart,
Stiff Neck, Lumbago, Rheumatism, it is espe?
cially good; Fains in tho Bones, or in tho
Muscles or Joints, for Stings of Insects, Snake
Rites, Itching Humors in the Skin; for all
these, and for moro than wo can enumerate,
it is tho great remedy.
