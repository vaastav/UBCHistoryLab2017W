The President's Message.
Tho Message of tho President is the
longest document ho has ever sent to Con
gress. It is too lengthy fur our columns,
tut we give our readers an abstract of its
contents.
Considerable space is occupied iu referring
to the general prostration of business and
its causes, in which his ideas ate evidently
At variance with many of the best financiers
in tho country. After referring to these
matters and to the fact that we have great
resources in capital and labor not employed,
lie winds up this portion of bis message
with the following not very clear sugges
tion. "Therefore, with these facts in view, it
MeeniB that wtso statenianship at this ses
sion of Congress would dictato legislation
ignoring tho past, directing iu proper
chaunels these great clemonts of prosperity
to any pcoplo."
Tho President bolieves it best to return
as soon as possible to a specie currency and
says
"To the accomplishment of this, I
iuvite your special attention. I believe
firmly there can be no prosperous and per
manent revival of business and industries
until a policy is adoptod with legislation to
carry it out, looking to a return to a specie
basis. It is easy to conceive that the debtor
and speculative classes may think it of
value to them to make tho so called money
abundant until they cau throw a portion
of their burdens on each other. But eveu
tlicso I believe would be disappointed in
tho result if a course should be pursued
which will keep iu doubt the value of the
.legal tender medium of exchange,
He still further urges immediato action
.on thiB question, by saying : "Every dolay
.in preparation for final resumption partakes
.of dishonesty, and is only less iu degree us the
jhope is held out that a conveniout time will
at last arrive for the good work of rodeem
ing our pledges to commence. It will
never como, in my opinion, excep't by
positive action by Congress or by national
disasters, which will destroy, for a time at
least, the credit of the individual and State
at large. , A sound currency might be
reached by total bankruptcy and discredit
of the integrity of the nation and Individ
.ia!s. ' ,
1 believe it is the duty of Congress, at
'tuts session, to devise such legislation as
-will renew confidence, revive industries,
ist a it us on a career of prosperity to last for
many years, and to save the credit of tho
nation mid of the people. Steps toward
the return to a specie basis are great
requisites, to be devoutly sought for, and
there are others which I may touch upon
hereafter."
Upou ono point the President will find
nearly every one will agree with him, and
that is whcio he says tho burden of this
present prostration fall the most heavily
upon the working men,
The manner in which Oeuoral Grant pro
poses to get back to a specie currency is
set forth in the following clause : " But I
will venture to suggest two or three things
which seem to me as absolutely necessary
to a return to specie payments, the first
(treat requisite lu a return to prosperity,
The legal tender clause to the law author
izing the issue of currency by the national
Government should be repealed, to take
effect as to all contracts entered into after
a day fixed iu the repealing act, not to
apply, however, to the payment of salaries
by the Government or for other expendi
tures now provided by law to be paid in
currency in the interval pending between
the repeal aud final resumption. Provision
should be made by which the Seoretary
of the Treasury oan obtain gold as it may
become necessary from time time from the
date when specie redemption commences.
To this might and should be added a reve
nue auflloiently in excess of the expenses to
insure an accumulation of gold iu the
Treasury to sustain redemption." The
President favors free banking, which with
esumption, ho thinks will not only be safe
but necessary.
The message says our Foreign relations
are entirely satisfactory with few excep
tions. It suggests if possible that some laws
be enacted that will provent the im
portation of Chinese women, who are gen
erally brought hore only for immoral pur
poses.
Tho President devotes considerable space
to the condition of affairs in Louisiana, and
claims that all that was dono by the Na
tional government was the right thing to
do, and says that if Congress takes no ac
tion, he shall continue to recognize the
State government that he has heretofore
recognized.
In reforring to Kuklux outrages the
'resident says, that officers and troops have
been stationed South to prevent their re
currence, and suggests that, "Possibly
Congress may find it duo to truth and jus
tice to ascertain by means of a committee
whether the alleged wrongs to colored citi
zens for political purposes are real, or the
reports thereof were manufactured for this
occasion."
The condition of affairs in Arkansas is
rehearsed, but the President says as Con
gress is Investigating the matter he has
declined to interfere.
Ho suggests that the number of Judicial
districts in the United States be increased
to eleven, the present number being nine.
In regard to the Indian policy, the Pres
ident desires no chango and says : " The
policy adopted for the management of
Indian affairs,known as tho "peace policy"
as been adhered to with most beneficial
results. It is confidently hoped that a few
years will relieve our frontiers from clan
gors of Indian depredations. I commend
tho recommendations of the Secretary for
the extension of the homestead laws to the
Indians, and for some sort of territorial
government for the Indian Torritory."
The President vory properly suggests
that the law that cuts off pensioners of
the war of 1812 residing in the southern
states be so amended that they can take
the required oath, us thoy are all too old to
have aided the late rebellion and their ser
vices were rendered the whole country.
Ho also gives tho " Centennial" a kindly
word and recommends Congress to take
such action as will render the exposition A
success.
The President is apparently ready to
abandon the pretended enforcement of the
Civil Service Sham, and says if Congress
does nor pass some positive legislation on
the subject, ho will regard their action as a
disapproval of the system aud will thorefore
abandon it.
Taken in all, tho message though un
usually lengthy, offers but few valuable
recommendations to congress.
Wholesale Kidnapping.
Baltimore, December 2. Harry Clan-
pitt, 11 years old, whose parents reside on
George street, mot a man driving a wagon
a few miles from the city, on the Hooks-
town road, and asked bim to give him a
ride. After going some distance ho got out
of the wagon, and as Boon as be did so
three masked men seized the boy, blind
folded, bound and gagged bim and put bim
into another covered wagon.
He was by them driven to a woods where
there seemed to be a camping ground, be
then discovered another captive boy in a
wagon and three asleep. The boys were
fed on bread and water, and under heavy
threats were made to do laborious work ;
aud boys not being able to do as much work
as was demanded of them, their allowance
of bread and water was reduced as a pun
ishment . . , i ..'
Their bands were tied between their
knees. This lasted from Saturday last un
til Monday night, when one of the boys,
Harry Clampit, made his escape. After
wandering about for some time be met a
colored man on the road, who showed him
the way to Baltimore. When he reached
home bis condition was most doplorablo
bis clothes were tattered and toin and his
body covered with vermin. His parents are
resneotablo people and thoy vouch for the
truthfulness of the boy's story.
Contents of the Chicago Elevators.
Chicago, December 9. The elevators at
Chicago contain 1,240,041 bushels of wheat,
870,024 bushels of corn, 200,130 bushels of
oaU, 25,400. bushels of rye, and 105,439
bushels of bailey, making a total of 5,100",
223 bushels, against 2,229,889 bushels, at
this time last year. Business in grain shows
little change iu volume, though prices here
have been somewhat affected. Wheat Is
lower, under rather unfavorable advices and
a general disposition to sell, with but little
inclination to buy. The fact that prices
re now eight or ten cents above a shipping
figure has a depressing effect upou specu
lators and the general tone Is heavy.
More Fighting Dona South.
They are having more trouble 4n Mis
sissippi with the darkeys. A ' dispatch
from Vicksburg, dated the 7th inst., says :
Seven hundred negroes attacked this city
this morning on tho. three different roads
loading to it. They were driven back with
a loss of twenty-five killed and wounded
and forty prisoners. The whites lost one
killed two wounded. The attack was
made for the purpose of reinstating Crosby
sheriff, who was requested to resign be
cause he had not givon the required bond.
The negroes in the county are reported as
burning dwellings and giu bouses.
Later reports say that all is now quiet
and tho negroes have returned to their
homes.
Another Murder In Luzerne County.
Wilkesbarre, December 0. A farmer
named Klein was murdored and robbed on
Monday night on the turnpike road at a
point called Notch, about two miles from
Scranton. AVhile going through tho notch
of mountains six men sprang out from the
roadside and seized the farmer's horses
and pulled him from the wagon, kicked and
beat him and shot him through the heart.
He was then robbed of bis watch and
money and the murderers disappeared in
the woods. .
Violent Storm at St. Petersburg.
St. Petersburg, December 8. A violent
storm occurred her last night causing much
damage. Tho tide rose nino foot above high
water mark, partly inundating tho lower
portions of the city. A large number of
families of the poorer classes wore driven
from their houses. Over a thousand poor
homeless wore sheltered by the police and
tho public. Kitchens were opened to sup
ply the sufferers with food. Tho water is
now falling rapidly.
Vermont Mystified.
Those mysterious, stones that fell from
nobody knows where upon the premises of
Thomas Paddock at North Pownal, Vt,
are still attracting much attention. The
stones are now said to be hot when they
reach the earth. Investigation is said to
show that the stones cannot be thrown by
mischievous persons. Mr. Paddock has
offered a reward of f 1 to anybody who will
explain the mystery 1

t2TA Nevada justice, when appealed
to to issue a warrant for tho arrest of some
three-card montemen who had swindled a

offence came under the bead of "dis
pensations of Providence, and he hadn't

fZB" Petroleum springs have been disco v.
ered on the Luneburg Heaths, in northern
Germany. The petroleum Is obtained by
simple borings, and at some spots, as the
village of Wietze, the sand is saturated
with rock oil. In clearness, purity, and
specific weight, the Luneburg oil is said to
be identical with our American petroleum,
and to be, moreover, almost entirely with
out smell of any kind.
tV At Fray Bentos, on the Uruguay
river, is a great factory for the preparation
of extract of beef. The Industry is so ex
tensive that a population ot about five
thousand live by it. Droves of wild cattle
are confined in yards adjoining the slaught
erhouse, aud lassoed oue by one stabbed
with a large dirk knife, and dressed with
celerit y equal to the operations of a Chicago
Dork packing establishment. The meat is
separated from the bones and run between
grooved rollers, which tear and press It into
coarse shreds. The next operation is to
make the meat into soup by boiling it
thoroughly in shallow pans. Tho fat is
skimmed off, aud the soup, when boiled to
thick, brownish paste, is filtered and
further reduced by evaporation to a jelly.
It is then ready to be canned for exporta
tion. The apparatus for this process Is
quite elaborate, and great care and skill
are required in tho manipulation. ' The
bides of the cattle are roughly tanned and
exported. The fat is also canned and sent
abroad. The bones are ground for the
soil. Scarcoly a bit of the animal is wasted.
A CARD TO THE PUBLIC.
Short Postponement of tho Fifth
Concert.
Gift
As managers of the gift concerts given
in aid of the Publio Library of Kentucky
my position creates an important trust in
behalf of '.ho Publio Library and tho ticket
holders of tho fifth gift concei t. The Pub
lic .Library ot Kentucky and the ticket
holders are jointly interested in the amount
of tho drawing. The larger the fund to be
distributed iu gifts the greater will be the
gift awarded to each lucky ticket-bolder
and the more tho amount realized by the
Library. To have a full drawing is so
manifestly to the interest of those inter
ested that, rather than have a fractional
drawing on tho 30th inst., I deem it due to
the trust confided to mo by the ticket
holders and tho Publio Library of Kentucky
that a short postponement be made to en
able mo to dispose of the unsold tickets aud
nave a lull drawing. Though tho very
large amount now iu bank would enable us
to distribute handsome gifts, yet we should
feci disappointed in this our last concert,
should we be compelled to make a frac
tional drawing, however large.
We have received so very largo a number
ot letters lrom all parts of the country from
those most largely interested, urging a
postponement if all the tickets be not sold
by the 80th, that we feel strengthened in
our sense of duty to the ticket-holdors and
the Publio Library, to make the postpone
ment. Undor the circumstances, we have
determined, in the Interest of all parties, to
postpone the concert and drawing to Sat
urday, February 87, 1875, at which time
the drawing will positively take place, and.
as a guarantee of good faith toward ticket
holders, we pledge ourselves to refund to
any ticket-holder his monoy, upon presen
tation of his ticket, should the drawing fail
to come of at the day now fixed. The past.
we feel assured, will be sufficient guarantee
to all interested that they will be fairly and
honestly dealt with. The money paid for
tickets is sacredly preserved - against all
contingencies until after the payment of
the gifts, after which the expenses are to
be reimbursed aud the Publio Library is to
be paid its profits.
