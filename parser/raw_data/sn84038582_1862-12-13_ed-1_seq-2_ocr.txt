OTTAWA, ILL.. DECEMBER 13, 1S62.
The Disaster at HartsviU, Tenn.
Our city, and indeed the whole county,
has been in an intense state of excitement
for the last few days, on account of the
despatch from the army in Tennessee
stating that the 104 Illinois the La Salle
county regiment, along with a corps of
Ohio regiments, bad, on Sunday last been
surprised at llartsville, Tenn., by the reb-
el brigand John Morgan, and after a feeble
resistance, captured. One account says tb e
loss of the whole brigade on our side was
feat CO killed and wounded, while another
says, the loss was CO killed and some 500
wounded. All accounts, however, agree,
that the aflair wes most disgraceful to the
federal comander.
The irst reports agreed in stating that
the brigade at tho time was under com
Mruri of Col Moore, of the 104th, but a
-correspondent of the Cincinnati Commer
cial states with great positiveneps that Col.
Scott whoever that may be was in com
mand. Morgan's force consisted of 3 regi
ments of cavarly and 2 ef infantry about
2,000 te 2,500 men. .Scott's force of the
104th HI. and the lOCth and lOSth Ohio
infantry, with a squad of cavalry and a
battery, occupying a strong position.
Morgan was known to be in the neighbor
hood, and Gen. Dumont bad made such
arrangements, that if the force at Ilarts
ville had fought but a few hours, be was
sure to be bagged. Indeed the surrender,
which was almost immediate,had hardly li
ken place before our troops came up, Mor
gan making a narrow escape as it was, and
our own reinforcements burying our dead.
Such, thoroughly sifted, are about all
thee facts w have yet obtained in reference
to this disgraceful aflair. We arc happy
that yesterday's despatches went far to
remove much of the obloquy which was
rapidly fastening upon Col. Moore in refer
ence to tho matter. We think when we
obtain full particulars, it will also be found
that the 104th regiment are not to blame.
We certainly have no pleasant accounts of
the two Ohio regiments, recruited from
the purlieus of Cincinnati They are rep
resented to us as having been in a very
demoralized condition. But we suspend
further remark until we learn the facts.
The prisoners were taken with him by
Morgan across the Cumberlond.
The Industrial League.
The meeting of the La Sallo County In
dustrial League at the Court House on
Thursday, was rather thinly attended;
but the substantial position and character
of the men in attendance went far to re
deem the paucity of numbers.
Whatever may be the ultimate design
of this as well as all similar leagues now
forming throughout the northern part of
this State, there is no doubt but the im
mediate olject is to forward the great na
tional scheme of finance, the conception of
tho Hon. A. Campbell, of La Salle. With
the main features of that scheme rm- j Cufieeville, 10 miles north of Grenada,
bodied in the memorial we published a i vrhcre he had another severe skirmish
week or two ago our readers are already ! which lasted 2 hour?. Our loss here was
sufficiently acquainted. It involves, first. ; g killed and 50 wounded, among the kiil
the banishment from circulation of all ; e, bein that excellent officer, Lt. Colonel
bank paper, thus placing it out of the i
power of soulless bankers and corporations
to cause those ruinous expansions and
contractions of the currency which have
heretofore effected so much distress and
ruin in this country ; and 2d, To replace
that circulation with Treasury notes, to be
of equal volume at all times and of equal
raVue in all parts of the country.
The scheme is yet in a crude state, and
is doubtless susceptible of improvement.
. Mr. Campbell assumes that all that is ne
cessary to make Treasury notes equal to
gel-l and silver is to make them a le;;al
tender at all times and everywhere for
duties, interest on the public debt, dc , ns
well as in all business transactions. We
fear, thus stated, the lasis of the plan is
vicious. Mr. C. holds that gold and silver
are representatives of value only because
they are made so by law, and that law can
equally make paper such a representative.
He thus ignores what all political econo
mists hitherto, wo believe, have regarded
as a fundamental principle that the dif
ference between gold and paper is, that
the former is intrinsically valuable, while
the latter is not. We fear Mr. Campbell's
plan will prove lame for want of a basis,
and that a good, solid one of gold and
silver to stand upon. Yet we do not pro
poe to be financier enough to discuss the
point with him. We hope, at least, he
may succeed in getting his scheme before
Congress in such a way that it may be
thoroughly investigated.
Con gi ess.
The only action of any earthly inpor
tance in Congress during the past week,
was the passage of the bill for the admis
sion of Western Virginia into the Union as
.a state. The bill passed both houses, and
is a law. Mr. Stevens admitted that the
k was unconstitutional, but said accord
ing to bis principles, be could vcte for the
the bill on the ground that the revolu
tionary States, being belligerents, were not
entitled to the privileges of the constitu
tion. With his consent the Union could
Uterer be restored as it was.
"The bankrupt bill u made the order in
the senate next Thursday, and the Illnois
canal bill in i&e House (or the same day.
Fbaxck. The news bf the steamer in
the begining of the week, announced that
the Emperor Napoleon, notwithstanding
the rebuff he received from England and
Russia in his propostion to interv.aw in
the American war, was fixed in his pur
pose to interfere. Later arrivals, ivowever,
speak less positively of th Emperor's
purpose.
Mixkesota Ixnuss. There is intense
excitement iu Minnesota in consequence
of the President failing promptly to ap-.
prove the sentence for the execution of
about 350 Indians condemned by a recent
Military Court for complicity in the out
rages last summer. The Preaidont has
finally consented that 30 of the ringleaders
shall be executed. Ths people of Minne
sota, have entered inta combinations, and
declare that if the President will not order
She execution of the rest, they will hang
iheps nevertheless.-

. War News . of the Week.
From Gsjc. Bcrssidk's Armt.
The ball has opened at Fredericksburg
in dead earnest Gen. Burnside having
all in readiness, determined on Thursday
morning to cross the Rappahannock at
Fredericksburg, and give the enemy bat
tle. At 5 o'clock in the morning be
commenced the construction of his pon
toon bridges. The enemy, concealed in
bouses on the opposite bank, opened a
destructive infantry Cre on bis pontoiners,
so that they iff ro forced to abandon the
work. Thereupon, at 0 o'clock, Burntide
opened his batteries, on the . city, under
the Cre of which the construction of the
bridges was resumed, and by 3 o'c'ock, p.
m. they were completed and the army
commenced crossing. Franklin's division
crossed three miles below the city, with
little opposition. The city was almost to
tally destroyed. As many as 176 guns
played upon it at one time. The enemy
replied with heavy guns, but not with
great vigor. After our army crossed the
enemy fell back to their works south of
the city, which Burnside was expected to
attack yesterday, when a great battle
would be fought.
There is a rumor that Gen. Banks is at
Suffolk, and will co-operate from the South
with Burnside against Richmond.
North Carolina.
The activity of Gen. Foster and his little
army in North Carolina has so disgusted
the rebels that they have abandoned all of
the state east of the Wilmington an!
Weldon R. R. An expedition, conveying
heavy reinforcements to Gen. Foster left
Fortress Monroe last Saturday.
FiiOil TaXKESEE.
The war in Tennessee grows exciting
and complicated. Rwsecrans has boon
moving very slowly and cautiously south
ward towards Mui freefcboro, expecting to
fight a great battle there; but the move
ments within a few days indicate that the
rebels are trying to flank Nashville on the
east, and get back into Kentucky. This
explains the dash of Morgan on llartsville,
whither the whole rebel arm' now seems
tending. The probabilities are that in
stead of Murfreesboro, llartsville will be
the scene of the great battle between
Rosecrons and Bragg, if, indeed, it is not
further north still.
From Gex. Grant's Army.
The news from Mississippi during the
week has been decidedly muddled and
confused, but a careful comparison of all
the despatches, leaves the facts about as
follows :
Grant has, amid great difficulties, passed
his main army south as far as Oxford, 45
miles north of Grenada. Colonel Dickey,
with a few thousand cavalry, moving from
15 to 35 miles in front of him. Col. I.
appears to have encountered the rebel
rear at Oxford, and to have bad a pretty
sharp fight, losing 21 men, but driving the
rebels. His pursuit was kept up, with
constant skirmishing, untill he reached
McCulIough, of the 4th Cavalry. We do
not hear of Dickey beyond this point,
while Grant, at lait accounts, was awaitiug
a train from lloilys Spring at Oxford
An expedition. 7,000 strong, under Gens.
Hovey aud Washburn left Helena on the
27th and penetrated into Mississippi to
Grenada, as a diversion in favor of Grant.
They entered Grenada, but remained only
a few hours. They destroyed portions of
both Railroads north of Grenada, had two
or three severe skirmishes with the rebels,
captured about 400 negroes, 200 of whom
they found chained in a canebrake, and
returned to Helena.
A Philadelphia despatch of yesterday
siys, Grant penetratsd to 10 miles beyond
Grenada, and is brought to a stand still by
muddy roads. The renels appear to have
left Mississippi, retreating toward Alaba
ma. If so, the Mississippi river may be
regarded as open.
The Wan is Arkansas.
Wo mentioned in our last the victory of
Gen. Blunt at Cane Hill near Boonsboro,
stating that a large rebel force was still
threatening him, and that reinforcements
were on the way under Gen. Herron. Gen.
Blunt had but about 5,000 men, and with
these he encamped in a strong position at
Cine Hill, awaiting his reinforcement-!.
Gen. Herron with about 7,000 men on his
way to join Blunt, had arrived on Mon
dav at Crawford Praire, 10 miles south of
Fayetteville, when he met the rebel army
under Uindman, Parsons. Marmaduke,
&c, 24,000 strong. They had flanked
Blunts position in the night, and their evi
dent intention was, to cut up Herron and
then fall ou Blunt and destroy him. But
Herron spoiled that game by giving them
a hard fight. The action commenced at
10 o'clock in the morning, aad raged with
fierceness nnlil 4 o'clock, neither party
gaining any decided advantage, when Gen.
Blunt, who had ' smelt the battle afar off",
came up with his 5,000. The battle was
continued until dark with terrible slaugh
ter to tho enemy, when they retreated
across Boston Mountains. Our loss was
about 700, and that of tho rebels about
2.f)f0. It was one of the hardest fought
bat lea rf the war. Few prisoners were
taken on either side.
Tne " Dear" Negro. According to the
last and most authentic statements, Uncle
Sam has now on his hands, at Fort Mon
roe. Tort Royal, New Orleans, Newbern,
Cairo, and scattered through the army
generally, at least 50.000 contrabands, who
must be fed and clothed at Government
expense and earn nothing. These contra
bands cost, at the smallest figure, 5U cts
each per day, or in all $25,000 per day,
equal to $9,125,000 per annum enough
to maintain the regular army in time of
peace. But this is but a drop in the
bucket, if the President's scheme to throw
upon the hands of the government 4,000,
000 of contrabands Ly means of the pro
clamation on the 1st of January succeeds.
The questions recurs, are the eople of the
free States willing to be tared to pay
those enormous bills for supporting in
idleness these hordes of lazy negroes ?
IIarr ox tbe: Niuuer. The Medical Di
rector at Cairo makes a report that some
of the contrabands, hired out by the Mili
tary authorities at Cairo to farmers ia Illi
nois (abolitionists, of course,) are being
treated scandalously. The parties who
took them are how haying ther4 arrested
u.nder the neg,o laws of this State, fined
$S0, sold to pay the fine, and then buy
them, thus;' securing their sertices for next
to nething.
Tbe President1 Message.
Profound as was tbe conviction of the
American people that incompetency reign,
ed supreme in the Cabinet at Washington,
it remained for tbe President's message to
complete their amazement and mortifica
tion. The people are aware that the blockade
of our own ports, has resulted in distress
to foreign manufacturers, and cemplicated
our relations with England and France.
They desired to be informed what our re
lations with those, powers really were, and
they have a right to that information.
Yet all the President vouchsafed to say
was, that our foreign, relations were not so
good as they used to be, but as good as
cculd be expected.
The country is engaged in domestic
hostilities that hare called to the field
more than a million of its citizens te de
vote their lives to the maintenance of their
government The treasure of the country
without stint or limit, has been poured
out for the same purpose. It was, it is,
the right of the country to know how
these vast resources have been employed
by those whom it appointed to administer
them. Some explanation was due for the
failure of these vast means to accomplish
their just and proper results. Silence can
not be accepted as an answer. Silence is
an insult to the intelligence of the people.
The administration are in a position where
they are bound to explain, defend, or
confess. Silence may be confession it is
nothing else but is not the sort of con
fess on that the people demand. If the
administration are determined to measure
their power against that of the people, re
gardless of the warning they have already
received, they can persist in tho experiment
The country has already advanced beyond !
tho point of being injured by the struggle
tho disaster will fall on their heads
alone. Deeply as the country is mortified
by this message, it is nevertheless well
that it should bo so. It no longer remaias
doubtful a to whero the cause of our
disasters lie.
An annual raessago of the President of
the United States, delivered to the nation,
without any recognition of the fact that
we are struggling for existence ; that the
struggle is maintained by a million of men
in arms ; that they are a soldiery as brave
as any who ever faced a foe, in this or any
any other age, and of whatever cation ;
that they have won noble, perhaps useless
victories, and sustained defeats inglorious.
But not to them, without any recognition
of the relation which the resources of tbe
government bear to those of the traitors
who are seeking to subvert it, or of the
principles upon which it is proposed to
make those resources whether moral or
material, available, reveals to the under
standings of all mankind, why it is that
the government, with abundant means to
have crushed the rebellion before it
became anything but a local insurrec
tion, have not done so why the insur
gents rose to the dignity of belligerents,
and why the belligerents seem about to
exchange that etiaracter for one of recog
nized nationality. Understanding, as the
the nation now does, tho causes that have
made the post twenty months so inglo
rious, it has before it the plain duty, and
the ample means of restoring it to the re
spect of mankind. It ha commenced to
do so, and will proceed to complete its
work with all convenient speed. After
this, it is not strange, that upon inspecting
this message, it should te found to be
principally composed of an argument upon
;a question of doubtfl statesmanship, re-'
mote from the exigencies now before us,
and paradoxical in the mouth of hini'who
uttered it. Paradoxical because the Pre
sident has said that he ha the power by
his military fiat to free all the slaves in the ' thoo formerly made by the state and the
nation, and that on New Year's day he is j canal board, and expresses his anproval of
going to doit. And yet the nation are j the plan and estimates made by Mr. Good
told that it is absolutely necessary for ing, several years ago. This plan is, to
them to hire the several States where sla
very exists, to abolish it by paying so much
per head for all the slaves they had in
I860! Yes, the nation must do it, the
President reneats, in order to insure a
successful result to the war ! Where such
ideas as these pass for statesmanship, it is
not difficult to tell what road the nation
are travelling.
War can be declared by Congress alone.
Are we at war? Insurrection can be sup
pressed by ihe President without tbe ac
tion of Congress. Are the present hostili
ties war or insurrection ? The logil powers
and rights resulting from the one and the
other are different It is the right of the
people to know what the legal character
of these vast hostilities are.
The ports of the nation are blockaded.
Who authorized the blockade? Has Con
gress done so? Has any other tribunal
the powers to do so ? If the blockade has
not been established by legal authority,
and is therefore legally void, what answer
can the nation give to foreign reclamations
for confiscations of the'r vessels and car
goes in running a void blockade? The
people know, if the government clo not,
l that this is a question'that will hereafter
have to be answered and at their cost
and charges. Was the blockade necessary ?
Then why did not Congress authorize it?
Necessary or unnecessary, where is the
President's power to establish it, is a
question that will directly have to be ans
wered and our own judicial tribunals will
decide at whose cost
Upon all these weighty questions the
President is silent. But in regard to tbem
the nation will hot be silent It will make
its voice heard by those whose duty it is
to hear, and it will take eare that obe
dience shall follow hearing.
Negro CiTiZKSSHir.-Simultaneously with
the introduction of Hickman's bill ia
Congress for the organization of 100 negro
regiment, it is announced that Attorney
General Bates is occupying his leisure
honrs in preparing an elaborate opinion,
afErmiag the citizenship of negroes, or, to
use the new enphonism of the President's
"free Americans of African descent." Mr.
Bates must put a pretty high estimate on
his "opinion" if his imagines it can nullify
the Drcd Scott decision, and tbe uniform
action of this government SO years.
Nai-oleos axd Mesjco. Napoleon, not
withstanding he has largely reinforced his
army in Mexico, finds the road from Vera
Cruz to the capital a hard road to travel.
His force at Jalapa is in great distress in
coaseqaence of the Mexicans having got

and Vera Cruz, tSwis cutting off supplies.

Tbe rumors mentioned in our last,
st. if
overtures of peace having been presented
to Mr. Lincoln from high .authority in
Richmond,. haye assumed more definite
shape and form. They seem to have
come in two ways. First, a Dr. Barney, of
Baltimore, had an interview with Mr.
Benjamin, late rebel Secretary of War, arid
was entrusted by him with letters as well
to prominent democratic leaders at the
North as to the President, naming certain
terms on which the rebels would consent
to lay down their arms and return to the
Union; and secondly, a certain Mr. Green,
after au interview with Jefl Davis, was au
thorized to lay similar propositions before
President Lincoln and his. Cabinet The
story of the latter gentleman- is given in
the Chicago Times of Wednesday, and is
curious.' Mr.' J. Wesley' Green jsa 'jour
neyman japanner working at Pittsburg,
Pa., and during the Mexican war bad be
come acquainted with Jeff Da Vis. "Several
weeks ago, he was waited upen by a secret
agent deputed by Davis from Richmond,.
with an earnest request that he would re-t
pair to thatcity and see him. After much
persuasion he went;" and calling on JeffJ
Davis was entrusted by him with thecont
veyance ef a verbal message to President,
Lincoln, proposing to end' the war onVcer
tain terms, these were substantially the
same as those proposed in tbe Barney cor
respondence, and are about as follows:
1. A-general amnesty for political offen
ces; 2. The restoration of' all slaves uowi
in the possession of the government, and,"
as to all other fugitive slaves, the rigid en
forcement of the fugitive slave- law' and
3d, 1'hateach of the contending parties in
the present war shall .pay their own debt
Mr. Green says he waited on President
Lincoln and laid these propositions before
him. That he had repeated, .interviews
with the President and his Cabinet on the
subject, the main difficulty with the Cabi
net apparently being the question of his
authenticity; and was finally dismissed by
the Cabinet with direction to leave iheni-
in a position to be ablo M communicate i
with him at any future time. -.
The story of Mr. Green is told in such a
way giving dates, places, f c, so minute
ly as to enforce irresistibly the convic
tion that it is either a Roorback but of
whole cloth, or all of it substantially true.
That it is not the former is proved by tbe
fact that ' high authority' at Washington
admits that the President and his cabinet
had interviews with Mr. Green which he
names. The President in his case, how
ever, as in that of Dr. Barney, proresses to
attach no importance to the communica
tion of either, believing both to be impor
ters. This strikes us as a forced conclu
sion. No man can read the Barney cor
respondence and the- statement , of Mr.
Green and resist the conviction that they
have had some such conversation with
Davis and Benjamin as they mention
The only question is, if Davis, f-c , really
mean in good faith what they thus com -J
municate, why make it known in such a
singular way. If they want peace in
earnest, let them say so openly and man
fully, and the government or tt least, if
not the government, the people, will see

Ed Free IraJcr Perhaps a short ac
count, even at this late date, of the march
of this division from Tuscnmbia, Ala., to
Nashville, Tenn., will not be uninteresting
to a portion of your readers, as a part of
tbe command is from your town and vici

we commenced crossing, and on that and
the following day all got over safe, and
camped nrtir Florence, on the North side
of the river, where we remained until the

started for Athens, 40 miles East of Flor

with the 1st brigade, in command of Col.

that, too, with all dispatch. We er as

would certainly be cut off and "gobbled
up" before we could gt through to Nnsh -
ville, if ne undertook it But Gen. Pal-
mer. was not the man te be frightened by
rumors, and consequently, on the morn-
r f Tm 1 t.,,tl.l
journey. The fir.t twelve miles were over
lJ dJsfv road, through neaw timber.
under a scorchin - sun, and without watr.
. ' - . - .i ...
We then struck a rooh, mountainous, :
and rockey country, with p'ct? of water :
The firt water we reached was Blowing ;
springs, at the foot of a step hiil, in a ,
deep, long ravine, and ns the thirsty sol- '
diers crowded around for wa'er. the reb (
els opened fire from the hillsides upon j
them, as they were huddled around tho
Springs. The. darkies beat a retreat in j
disorder, but the boys of the ICth Illinois j
never faltered that bing the regiment ,
at the spring at the time. In less time
than it takes to write it, they were iu line,
and returned the fire, and thon charged
up the steep declivity, pullsng thennrlves j
up by tbe shrubs and roots of the trees '
When they arrived at the top, the rebels
had departed, and then we got out of that
place soon as good manners would per- .
mit. I will not attempt to lrcr:be all the
skirmishes we had in detail ; but it is suf- j
fifieut to say, that wo wore suirourded by
an unknown force of cavalry, that Set no
opportunity pass to hnrre and annoy us 1
by firing on our train, which was a long .
one, and murder every s-tragg!-r they 1
could nick up. We expected to hav
trouble at (.oluuibia, I t un , tut jf or.ee

We arrived at that chvon tha afternoon of
ed the river, and were all over but the 42 1
III , which was rear guard that day, when
they were attacked by('.l Kill'.-1's cavalrv,
front Eragg's army. We knew the 4'2l
Could take care of them well enough, and
threw up our hat for joy. Wing, an we
'considered, almost in the iaiid of Cilia.tn,
imI ! . f Tli. rear
guard soon disposed of the rebel, and ail
came over afe, with a slight los in kilh-d
aad wounded. We camped for the night
on the north side of the river, about one
mil from town, and for the rirt time
aince we left Athens, felt saf. T'p to thi
time it had been a ruaimig hht n-otn ;
Blotting. Spring.. j
We broke up camp at d.tylight on the .
10th, and asain commenced our hurried i
march. Gen. Palmer took the precaution
to order c.tpt. Houghtsiinj: to leave a
uuvitAcr nun mc iviir tiaij ujis ia . iu i
repel more effectually anv attack that j
niiiiht be made on the train, and it proved
a wise precaution ; for vhil the rear por j
lion of the kajjgage train was falling in,
tbe rebels again opened fire upon us from
Lite opposite side of the river, causing a
t ctampede of niggers and mules; but Lt.
'Van Dyke soon returned the fire and ci
lencedtheni with tbe 12 pounder howitzer,
cannister, -shells, &c, being mere than
they Counted on. Aftrr having a house
iur; wuunu ... . . er
knocked to pieces about their heads, m
which thev took refuse, and their Col.
severely wounded by a shell, they fled,
and we bid the city good bye by bending j
a slteM city-ward. It exploded high in the !
air, where all could see it and accept it a j
an omen, if they chose. This day we J
marched to within five miles of Franklin, j
and had but one skirmish that amounted j
to anything. After leaving Franklin on j
the following day we had more trouble ;
and camped that night two miles out of
Nashville Having marched 1 10 miles in
ve days under a scorching sun and over
du-ity roads, surrounded by a band of gue
rillas and cavalry numbering, as we have
since learnetl, about tw, and lost only
i about 100 men

safe. All the officers and men behaved

Cor. From the figures of 1861 and
1S62, it would appear that there was an
increase of exports of the latter over the
former year, of 13,755 bushels, from the
City of Ottawa; but, if we deduct the
amount of shipments from Utica for the
same years from the the total amount
cleared in rsch of these years respectively,
and ascertain tbe exact amount of the
shipments from Ottawa, we tind a drtrtaze
for lS62of fu4.604 bushels. A large quart
! t,tv of '.l1' crop still remains in the
i country, winch, owing to the continued
had condition of the roads, was prevented
from coming forward.
