(Sprrtnl to .lournnl-ConrleT.)
Washington, D(. : 4. Vice-President
John P. Stevens, Vice-President 1!.
i Campbell and Edward , Robbins, all cf
the New Haven road, tile latter as coun
sel, appeared hero to-day before the in
terstate commerce commission, and aski
ed that a date be set for a formal hear
ing of the charges' which have been
brought against the New Haven road In
connection' with Its conduct in. relation
to certain railroads running out of Jer
sey city. The hearing has been set for
Friday of this week at 2 l. m.
At that time the whole matter of the
cancelling of freight rates with the
New Jersey roads by the New Haven
road will be thrashed out. Both parties
to the affair will have their representa
tives vresont at the hearing. Presi
dent Mellen of the New Haven road
has sent word to Washington that he
will be there. Vice-President T. E.
Byrnes left New Haven' to-day for
Washington. .
The New Haven road has been sum
moned before the interstate commerce
commission to explain its notice to the
Central railroad of New Jersey, the Bal
tlmore & Ohio and the Philadelphia and
Reading that it would cancel all Joint
freight rates which had been In use In
connection with lines through Jersey
City. It is said that the cancellation
would mean a loss to the lrnes going
out of Jersey City of all their New
England business, or about 300 csrs a
day. The result would be that all ths
through traffle would have to be given
over to the Pennsylvania railroad.
Whether this action Is really one In re
straint of trada is one which the inter
state commerce commlsison will have to
der ide. The alternative which is offer
ed by the Now Haven road, is that all
this freight may be sent into New Eng
land by way of its bridge over the Hud
son r.lver at Poughkeepsie Instead of
through Jersey City. This would mean
that tha Central Railroad of New Jersey
would have to ship by a roundabout
route through Eaton, Penn.
ADVERSEJO FROST
Attorney-General's Finding is
Said to be Against His
Claim.
Hartford, Dec. 4. It Is understood
that the finding of Attorney General
Holcomb in the National Guard mat
ter is adverse to the contention of
brigadier General Frost. The opinion
probably will be made public to-morrow.
( The op'.nion Is of considerable
length, and it is understood goes quite
fully into the questions brought up by
legislation in 1903 and 1805. It is
thought it upholds the contention that
the continuance of the state National
Guard was provided for by the
amendments in 1903, so thitt the re
peal of certain sections in 1905 does
not affect the de jure status of the
guard while upholding the report of
the board of officers to the effect that
the brigade formation was legislated
out of existence.
It is understood that the finding of
the attorney general has been com
municated to those officers who were
interested in the proceeding's before
Mr. Holcomb.
Brigadier General Frost was sum
moned from'South Ncrwalk fcy Gover
nor Woodruff and reached, the capltol
during the afternoon.
BOYCOTT CASE

Listening to Those in
Action of Loewe vs.
Lawlor.
QUESTION INVOLVED
IN SUIT IMPORTANT
Danbury Hat Manufacturers
Claim a Violation of the
Constitution by
F. of L.
Washington, Dec. 4. The supremo
court of the Tniied States to-day
heard argument in the caso of Loewa
vs. Lawlor, involving the right of a
labor union to boycott manufactured
artic-les. I.ocwe Is a manufacturer of
hnts !n Danb-jry, Conn.,' whose pro
ducts have been boycotted by the hat
ters' union of which Lawlor Is an of-'
fir'lal and the American Federation of
Labor and he brought suit In the fed
eral circuit court of that state under
the Sherman anti-trust law, c'ahnuig
the enmnge to the extent of $0,000 had
been done to his property and asking
to recover three times thla amount, as
provided in that law.
The bill of complaint was dismissed
on a demurrer by the circuit court on
the ground that the Sherman law. was
not broad enough to cover the subject
and the case comes to . the . supreme
court on 8, certificate from the LTnited
States circuit court of appeals for ths
Fscond circuit covering that point of
lau-. The cass Is considered to bs one
of verx. general Importance as it in
volves the entire question of boycott.'
Tho complaint was founded upon the
theory that the opposition of., labor
union interferes with tha manufactur
ers constitutional rights of conducting
Interstate commerce. It is stated in
the complaint that the union hatters
have compelled seventy out of t.he
eighty-two hat manufacturers to un
ionize their concerns, and It Is claimed
that the American Federation of La
bor has 1,000 agents in the field assist
ing in such work.
The case was argued for the manu
facturers by Attorney James M. Beck
and Daniel R. Davenport, and for the
labor union by John K. Botch and
John H., Light. The Federation of La
bor ' was especially represented by
Thomas C. Spelling, who was permit
ted to present a brief in the pise. ;

Incendiarism Suspected in De
struction of North Haven
BuJMing.
Fire, believed to be of Incendiary
origin, completely destroyed the Clin
tonville schoolhouse of the First dis
trict of North Haven yesterday after
noon. Miss Jessie Wood, who teaches
the eighteen pupils who attend tho
school, left the building shortly after
4 o'clock In the pfternoon and closed
and locked the door. An hour after a
passer-by saw the door of the school
hOuse open, but thought that the
teacher had not gone home, so he
drove on. Soon after George S. Pas
sett saw a light In the schoolhouse,
which continued to grow bright, so he
gave the fire atarm.
Miss Wood says that when she left
the building the fire In the old-fnsh-ioned
box stove was practically out,
only one brand showing any signs of
life. From her and others connected
with the school it was learned last
night that It was absolutely impossible
that the building caught fire from the
stove. An Investigation into the fcaae
will be made to-day.

Evidence.

which resulted In the death of three
train men, court was adjourned for

some interesting testimony and Includ
ed that of Burton L. Elatchley of New

who had charge of the tickets on the
ill fated special train. Aside from the

discu?3 President (Roosevelt's message

enacted into a law."
On important questions Mr. Bryan's

HERZ ALSO OFF

Resignation of Another Vet
' eran Member Follows
That of George
W. Lewis.
SAID TO BALK AT
BROADENING POLICY
Did Not Favor Such Lirge la.
crease of City Expenses
Ncsbit Says He
Will Stay.
The peace whioh generally closes
long and successful "service seema
hardly probable to be present at
Mayor Studley's going out of oftioa,
for yesterday, following the resigna
tion of George W. Lewis from the
finance board, Henry Herz, another
veteran member, sent his resignation
to Mayor Studley. : ,
The resignation of Mr. Lewis was a
surprise, and the resignation of Mr.
Her?, coming so quickly after, is an
evidence that there was great opposi
tion to the action of the board in
raising so many salaries and increas
ing the expenses of the city to such an
extent. , ;
Mr. Herz last night refused to' dis
cuss his resignation from the board,
but it is said that he was , absolutely
disgusted with the action of the other
members those who favored the in
crease in expenses.
The so-called broadening policy 'of
ths city and board, which has become
apparent especially during the fall, has
met with no sympathy from either Mr.
Hers or Mr. Lewis, and, while this Jias
been generally known to tho occupants
or city hall, it was not believed either
of the members would resign because
of the action taken. . ,
In regard to a report prevalent last
night that Robert Nesbit also Intended
to resign. Mr. Nesbit stated to the
Journal-Courier that at present he
planned no euoh action. He did not
state his stand in regard to the broad
ening policy , of the board, but from
statements made at some of the meet
ings it is apparent that he is not en
tirely In sympathy with it.
Mayor Studley has nearly a month
in whioh to appoint men to fin the un
expired terms of Mr. Lewis and Mr.
Herz. It is not probable that "h will
icava ii 10 ms successor to put men
of the opposite party in office.
PINTSCH GAS MAINS AFIRE
Flame Bursts Throuah Roadbed
Planking at Station.
' Some little excitement was caused
amonor railroad employes at tho Union '
station last evening, when the mains
conveying the Plntsch gas caught Are
beneath the road bed and flamed un
through the tracks, setting fire to the
plank covering over the mains. These
tubes carry the gas from the company's
plant southeast of the ; station", to a
point just east of the bargage room
from which It Is distributed to the pas
senger car tracks.
At a poaition just outside the plat
form a sheet of flame several feet high
ourst through the planking shortly
after 9 o'clock last night,, ignited, it la
believed, by a passing looomottve. In
spite of the fear of explosion, the sta
tion men soon had the Are under con
trol without finding it neoessary to call
out the department.
The sound of escaping gas wag heard
bofore the gas ignited, an4 a search of
the yard trains was made, as it was
thought that some of the air brakes
connections had broken lowse,
