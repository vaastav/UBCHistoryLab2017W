This is a healthy, stimulating book for

held up for imitation, are Joseph, Moses,
Joshua, Samson, Samuel, Solomon, (not on
account of his thousand wires!) Elijah
and other worthies. The book is
written in a readable style, and, containing
several good illustrations, must prove an

Richard Cobde. A Biography. By John
. MoGilchrist. New York : Harper and
Brothers. 1865.
So far as has been possible, the author
states in a preface, Cobden has beesnade
in these pages to tell the story of his own
life. The biography has, therefore, a strong
autobiographical character. It is only the
political career and public serricee of this
Apostle of Free Trade, which the author has
sought to sketch. A raluable index has
been appended, in which the author has
endeavored to give a ready clew to the opin
ions of Mr. Cobden on all public questions,
and to group around him his associates. A
portrait of Cobden and a vignette represent
ing his birth-place, are given.

Nonts raon PiTMotrm Poipit. By Augusta
Moore. New York : Harper A Brothers.
1865..
This collection of memorable passages
from the discourses of Henry Ward Beecher,
have been already published and have had
very extended circulation, especially in
Great Britain Having proved themselves
useful, they have been committed to another
publisher, and the Harpers will give them
still wider currency.
Of the character of these "notes" we need
not speak. Mr. Beecher cannot open bis
mouth to speak on any subject, without edi
fication. A very readable sketch of Beecber's ap
pearance, habits and general "style" is fur
nished.

A Monti. Hotel. The McIIenry House
in Meadville has a reputation as broad as it
is excellent. IU model landlord, Mr. Tay
lor, formerly our fellow-townsman, is soon
to return to the Angier House in this city.
The Meadville Republican explains the wil
lingness and the brisk and polite manner
with which the table attendant and em
ployees at the McHenry House perform
their duties, by the fact that their employer
exhibits toward them the same traits of gen
erous liberality, which are so well known to
the public. On Thanksgiving day, about
three o'clock, P. an elegant dinner was
given by Mr. Taylor to his employees, at
which the following sentiment was proposed
and drauk wiiA ail the- honors i -
Oua Hospitable Employee and nis
akiablk Ladt : Ever ready to attend to the
comfort of their guests; always contribut
ing to the wants of the needy ; never for
getful of their employees, in sickness or in
health, but ever willing to add to their hap
piness, we, as employees, wisn tnem every
hsppiness; and will freely labor to promote
one of their greatest wishes, namely, the in.
te rests of the McHenry House.
The Republic observes! ' '
"This deserved testimony to the worthy
host of the McHenry, reflects credit upon
both par ies ; on him for so amply deserv
ing it, on them for knowing so well how
to express it"
Is Search or a Ebeabt Wife Matbiho
kial " Teavailb." We saw and heard, yer
terdsy morning, a love-husband, and father
lorn man breathe his 'plaint against an er
rant wife and mother, actual and prospect
ive, of his or some one's children, into the ear
of the attentive police.. . He is a son of toil,
resident in Newburgh,and is afflicted either
with paucity or softening of brains. Four
years ago he took unto his bosom as wife
Mary Jane Gains, of Elyria, by whose as
sistance he was rearing a hopeful family.
But a month ago she folded her tent like the
Arabs and as silently stole away with a
brother-in-law of the deserted. Sincewhich
event the husband and father has been on
his travels, in travail to find her. Having
exhausted his little pile of greenbacks, he
asked the privilege of sleeping in the city
prison Sunday night . Awaking bright yes
terday morning, ne testified his deathless
love for this missing wife, by offering the
police five dollars for her discovery and
unlivery w niiu.

Ac, Ac The standing room outside the bar
of the court room was all too small to accom

were colored people, called there by the fact,
that two or three culprits of that perauation

hanging to them, la the cat with a stone

tiary, moneyless, and given to no manifest
employment, all the circumstances of the
ease were exceedingly suspicious, and Judge
1KW accordingly "sentenced" him to thir
ty days hard service in the Work House.
" Bill " immediately arose and began
whispering and gesticulating violently to
his counsel. An oath now and then boned
over, in the effervescence of his rage, into
the general ear. He was madder than
onrod and infuriated bull of Bashan. He
protested his innocence, and every several
sorrel hair on his skull stood up in resent
ment, like quills on the fretful porcupine.
Judge Abbey has a righteous-indignation

THE CLEVELAND LEADER. A Daily, Tri-Weekly and Weekly
NEWSPAPER.
The Largest Paper in the West Outside
of Chicago, St. Louis and
Cincinnati.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1866.
The new year upon which we are about
to enter will usher in an era oi national
growth, prosperity and greatness unexam
pled in the history of the world. After
four years of desperate conflict, tbe prin
ciples which the Leadkk, in common with
the patriotic citizens and soldiers of the
country, has always announced and de
fended, have tnumpnea, ana tne war lor
the Union and rroedom Has enaea in vic
tory and peace, secession ana slavery
have both been crushed, ana our nepuDiic,
re-united and regenerated, enters upon a
new and glorious career. The future is
full of the promise of greatness to our
nation and of prosperity to its citizens.
Ana yet tne crisis oi our unuger m uui
passed. 1 he contest has only been trans
ferred from the military to the political
arena. The weapons are ballots instead
of bullets, the pen instead of the iword.
The spirit of secession is yet alive. The
great work of reconstructing the relations
of the Southern States to the Union, so
that the nation may be made secure, its
faith and honor kept inviolate, and equal
rights to all its citizens guaranteed, is yet
to be performed a work which for its
immense importance and eicantic diffi
culties is only paralleled by that which we
have just concluded. In this most cri
tical and important period in the midst
of these great evenU no man, rich or
poor, can afford to be without a news
paper. It is an article of prime necessity
in every household. "Without it a man is
half a century behind the age.
The Cleveland Lxader enters upon the
twenty-second year of its existence with
thetbrightest of prospects, and with a more
widely-extended and well-deserved popu
larity than at any previous period in its
history. Its principles and objects have
always been fearlessly avowed and boldly
advocated. They are the perpetuity of
tha Union ; the maintenanee of Freedom;
tbe establishment of Equal Rights to all
men ; and the advancement oi tne ma
terial, mental and moral condition of the
people.
Improvements.
-- vear
prosperity of tne Leader has enabled its
proprietors to introduce improvements
which render it still more worthy tho
support of its large and increasing circle
of readers.
"Within that period it has been twice
enlarged, the total increase in size being
atwrut e'dveiT columns, tbus at once accom
modating the advertising pressure upon
its columns, and giving much more space
to news and miscellaneous reading matter.
It is now as large as any paper in the
State, and larger than any outside of Cin
cinnati. On the first of October it appeared in a
new and handsome dress, greatly increas
ing its legibility and improving its ap
pearance. A new double-cylinder press has been
purchased and erected during the year,
which enables us to accommodate our
greatly increased subscription list and at
the same time to keep the paper open for
the reception of news up to the latest
moment. . -
The Leader, presents more, and more
nterestinir, reading matter to its readers
than any other paper in Northern Ohio.
Telegraphic Department.
"We receive the rceular telegraphic dis
patches to the Associated Press, obtained
at great expense. Special dispatches to
the Western Associated Press, received up
to four A. )ln and containing the latest
news, are also published in our morning
edition. These dispatches are received by
only one other paper ia the State outside
of Cincinnati. We have also able and
intelligent correspondents in "Wash
inirton. Columbus. Chicago, Oil City and
other places, who will furnish us by tele-
grnpn wun rename ana exclusive news
from those cities.

This department of the Leader is in

found battlina boldly and manfully for the
elevation of mankind and for freedom and
itico to all.

one of the mot competent and experi

'raphic markets, and financial and com
mercial summaries, are exhaustive and

market in Pittsburgh, prepared solely for
