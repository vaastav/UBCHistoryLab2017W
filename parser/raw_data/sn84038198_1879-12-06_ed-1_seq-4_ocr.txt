A J Ave 1*anther.
One night of last week, while
riding along the Kingwood and
Tunnelton piko, going home after
Court was over, and about S o'clock,
Judge Shaw of the County Court
was suddenly awakened from n
reverio by his horse wanting to
loave^the road, and go down the
steep declivity to the loft. With
considerable effort the Judge suc
ceeded ir. keeping the animal in
the way. When a few feet beyond
the spot (which is two or three
miles from Kingwood) the Judge
heard a growl, and on looking
back, lie saw crouched on a log, its
eyes glaring in the moonlight, a
live panther! It continued to growl
for some lime?the Judge hearing
it when oil* two or three hundred
vards. He rode down to Mr. Trow
bridge's who lived near, and in
formed him of his adventure; when
Mr. T. remarked that it was a pan
ther, no doubt; and that it had
frightened him a night or two be
fore by its unearthly screams while
lie was out in the woods, and, by
following him, caused him to get
home in haste, He had said noth
ing about it to any one, for fear of
being laughed at.
It was a few days ago only that
Mr. Richard Nugent, of this Dis
trict, was followed by a nanthcr,
?while going home at night. Mr.
Nugent had a lighted lantern and
eomo bo close to him that ho could
sue it by the light of his lantern.
It# screams were unearthly?Mr.
Nugent described them by saving
they were "heart rending." At last
lie throw a stone at it, and the pan
ther leaped over a fence and ran
awav. Mr. Nugent has no doubt
about it being a panther as ho saw
it plainly.
A panther roamed about in this
neighborhood for several wooks
just before the War. It was seen
by several persons, ami chas
ed a Mr. Ilartman one night as he
was going to Tunnelton. At length
it was killed up in Lyon District.
Panthers inhabit the mountain
between Uniontown and Jlruceton
in numbers and also abound in
the Canaan country up in Tuekcr
County. Following Cheat Uiver,
they "pass and re-pass from the
mountain to Canaan; and thus
their appearance in this neighbor
hood is accounted for.?King wood

can of to-morrow will print the fol
lowing us an outline of its cottents..
"It is understood in well-inform
ed circles that tlio President begins
his forthcoming annual message
by congratulating Congress aiill
the country up. ... the success
accomplishment of resumption, but
warns Congress that unless un
limited coinage of standard '
dollars is stopped the present
amount of gold' will soon heg.nl
gradually to How out of tho coun
try and that silver will take its,
J,lace. On this point lie
mends that no action he Ukui as
to lixing the rati" between 'ho si ?,
ver dollar and the gold dollar until j
the international monetary Co -
cress shall have arrived at sou Cj
conclusion regarding the legitim.to
status ofrflTt-r, but sugges s that,
the coinage of the silver do l-ir
merely suspended. It is aUo un.
derstood that he takes the ground
that as it is only in tunc o war or
other pressing emergency that he
issue of notes, the worth of which
is fixed wholly by the government,
is authorized, and that as no such
emergency now exists, the circula
ting notes, ?? '?> the greenback-,
should now he retired in some
manner wisely calculated to fore

Bent financial equilibrium. to
also argues that, as it has been the
pulicv of the government ever siiiu
the adoption of the constitution to
pav otV all the debts as soon after
thev am incurred as possible, a
sinking fun.l should now be provid
ed, or the existing laws relating to
that fund amended so as toi fix
limit specified and distinct ?>?""
which the present public debts
shall be paid. He then recom
mends that if the revenues of the,
government shall not bo s -
ficient to provide necessary funds
to meet the demand of such a pol
id a tariir should be placed on tea
and coffee, as that tax could be
conveniently levied, and would bo

have to bo admitted as a Mate.
In this connection lie roc"1'11
that the citizens of all the lerri
ritorvs wno are guilty of polygamy
shall ho debarred from the right ot
bu 11 rage, and also from the j?rivil
eges of jury duty. 1 le also
mends that a test oath shall bo im

pose of excluding polyguiuists
from the jury box.
"llo occupies considerable spate
ill the message to a discussion ot
Ihe theories of civil service reform,
and advocates the appointment o
a commission, M he endowed with
tho power to appoint officers or ot
ticials ofdifferent grades 111 the
civil service, all such appointments
to last during good behavior.
"He reports an agreeable ami
friendlv state of-affairs with tor
vigil nations and remarks m eh. et
| that nothing of importanco has oc
curred in diplomatic affairs sinco
J his last massage. He discourages
a renewal of the discussions regard
ing the transfer of the Indian bu
reau to the War Department, as
that discussion always servos to
hamper the ollicials of tho Italian
bureau in pending operations and
negotiations, and produces no cor
responding good. As a member
of tho Washington Monument com
mission ho advises the appropria
tion of a sufficient sum and the
change of existing laws to permit
the monument at an early date.
"Referring to the 'deficiency
which exists in the appropriation
for the Department of Justice, lie
points out the necessity of an im
mediate appropriation for the pay
ments of accrued dues and fees of
United States marshals arising
from the failure of Congress to pro
vide at the late extra session for
their payment under the usual pro
cess. He further points out the
necessity of similar or full appro
priations for the faithful and com
petent execution of the laws in the
future.
"In tone and spirit the en

it relates to political affairs, and in

We by no means give up the

wars and parties many a victory
has been snatched from oven great
er reverses. The work to be done
must be thorough?at once bold
and usparing. Whilo the politi
cians at Washington are wrangling
among themselves, the people at
home must organize. Needless
baggage must be left behind. Wo
can atlord to carry no dead weights.
We must move up to tho front,
pledging the country :
1. The maintenance of the public
credit inviolato, and an honest ef
fort to advance the prosperity of
the people without disturbing the
operation of the simple forces?to
which we owe the present revival
?by experiments upon our fiscal
system.
" 2. The cleansing of all the de
partments of the Government, and
the establishment of a genuine
svstem of civil-service reform in
lieu of the prevailing maladminis
tration.,
3. Tho restoration to the pcoplo
of their stolen sovereignty, accom
panied by a fair and enlightened
readjustment of our elective sys
tem, making it impossible to put
the Government on wheels and
run it into tho several States as a
machine for perpetuating the party
that happens to be in power.

I for which tfie recent arrest in Ire

I nounced the action of tho govern
l ment, which he predicted would
utterly fail in its object, for agita
| lion against landlordism would be
continued. The resolutions mov
ed by l'arnell and carried with en
thusiasm, are to the effect that the
arrests are arbitrary, unconstitu
tional ami calculated to weaken
the confidence of tho people of Ire
land in the impartiality of the law,
and that the government which
squanders the blood and treasure
of the people in unjust wars abroad
whilo misery and famine aro uu

ed in tho eyes of all right-uiiuded

There was no disturbance, as the

Some of the experiences of

Governor Mathews lias been in
vited by the Pittsburg Chamber of
Commerce to address that body
on the subject of the extension of
the Pittsburg Southern Railroad
through West Virginia, lie had
expected to be present on Tuesday
last, but a letter was rend before
the Chamber explaining that en
gagements would prevent him from
complying with their request until
after the lirst of January next.
We are glad to learn* that Gov
ernor Mathews has a full apprecia
tion of the importance of this en
terprise to the State of West Vir
ginia. regarding it as the most
material to the development of the
State of any heretofore projected,
and we have no doubt his influ
ence at Pittsburgh will keep the
boom booming at that point. We
understand that he design?: giving
a very full description of the terri
tory and wealth of resources that
woidd be opened up bv tho exten
sion of this road. A full and fair
presentation of this ought to be

Information has been received at
Washington of an official charac
ter that there will be two Territo
ries knocking at the door for ad
mission as States this winter.
These are Dakotali and Utah. It
is claimed that the population of
each is sullicient. The Dakotains
claim for their Territory a popula
tion of 120,000. In 1870 it had
1-1,000. The increase has been
tremendous, and there is now no
doubt but what there will certainly
he enough to make a State by the
end of the present year. As to tho
political complexion of these Ter
ritories, Utah is Democratic while
Dakota is Republican.
A number of medical students
in Indianapolis recently undertook
to make a victim of a professional
resurrectionist. They told him
they had secured a body, and
asked him to remove it from its
hiding place. The supposed
corpse in tho bag was a live medi
cal student. The students pointed
out where the bag was concealed,
nnd the man threw the bag over
his shoulder and set out for tho
college. The corpse, with no
knowledgo of his whereabouts,
straightened out just as bis bearer
was crossing the canal. With rare
presence of mind the intended vic
tim of tho joke heaved his burden
over tho bridge into the water.
Had not tho companions of the un
fortunate fellow rushed to the res
cue there would have been a real
eorpso as tho result of the joke.
