CODDLING THE ' REDS."
Deportation is not the final solution
of the "Red" problem, but deportation |
is by common consem the obvious, im
mediate step to take. There is grow- j
ing impatience over the apparent tim- j
idity and dolay of federal authorities j
in this respect.
Months ago there was announce- i
ment made of a general round-up
of dangerous aliens. Particular at
tention was-called to a trainload of
trouble-makers from Seattle, destin
ed for New York and thence for their j
native lands. It appears now that j
?only seven men out of that murder- j
ous cargo have actually been deport-J
.ed. According to the New York |
World three of them are still held n
custody in Xew York, and/ 22 have
been turned loose.'
' There lias been another big round
up since. . .What is to^. come of that?
How many of these violent, ene
mie?;.of Americanism have 'been de-.
? ported so far,- altogether? How
inany are held? How many have
been freed, by. legal procedure or of-j*
ficial laxitv,. to continue their 'fnenac
ihg">propaganda? When are the ex
portations going to begin in earnest?!'
fThe^public wcmld like .to know.
It is explained that'"^present laws}
are not drastic enough to confer the.)
necessary authority. ' For ?that,-. Con-)
gress is responsible. It is also charg- !
ed that prosecutors afid "federal offi- j
cials in general have not taken full j
advantage of powers already existing.j
The- people would like to see a tight-j
^ning up of la.ws and administration ;

THE SUGAR HABIT.
_" - I
Most of the other nations would be j
puzzled by what Americans have call- j
s ed a "sugar famine.' Most of them j
. would not f;nd anything very critical j
.. in the recent shortage in this coun- j
try. Italy, which uses habitually only j
"j. one-tenth as much-sugar per capita]
us the United States, would regard
\ our supply as luxurious excess. So
would France.
~ Our suagr consumption is not only
j| lavish compared with the rest of the
fe present-day world, but also compared
5 with our own past record. Even in
wjj years of war scarcity we have used
over $0 pounds of sugar per capita.
6 In 1S80 we used less than 40 pounds.
E In pioneer.days there was very little
St sugar. For thousands of vears civil
?>.. ized man got along very well with-,
fcj <?ut it. consuming no sugar except |
what he obtained naturally from j
sweet fruits and vegetables and other!
g foodstuffs.
Most people nowadays seem to
imagine that sugar is an imperative- i
ly necessary food. It is se only be-!
cause they have formed the sugari
habit: Sugar is an excellent fooLl
when not abused, and there is no prood <
..reason. generally speaking, why peo'-J
.pie should not. have all they want.;
Put they could -get along without it.]
:'if they ha.d to. jusr as their ancestors'
did for countless generations.

THE INCOMPENT TEACHER.

?K". " ? * j
sitions in the public schools of ihej
.United States are either vacant orj
? filled by teachers bolo\\- standard, and I
,-the attendance at normal schools andj
. teacher-training schools has decreas-i
' ed 20 percent in th<- l:ist three years." 1
f This quotation is from an official bul-i
.* ? j
?." letin. of the National Education As
'M sociation.
? Its estimate, based on careful in
vestigation. is that out of about
: $00.000 teaching positions in the
> prbli*- schools of ihe country, there
f ?re 3f>.<;00 vacancies and ?'.;'?,00? :-. a :.
-~?.j*rs beloTiw standard.
' That one-tenth of all tie- public
.: School teachers of* the United States
fat
\. are below standard is a pretty se
rious matter. In one way it seems'
even more serious than the .?,9,0fl0j
school rooms with no teachers at
all. If a child, particularly in a ru
ral district, has no school to go to,
at least that child can be learning use
ful things about agriculture and in
dustry by his association with th-.
indoor and outdoor work of the farm.
Later, he may go to a good school
?nd make up his lost schooling. But
if that child is in a school which pro
tends to be a school and is not, he is
not only wasting his time, but worse;
than wasting it, for he is acquiring!
bad habits of study and probably!
learning mnay things which later
must be unlearned.
The recommendations of the presi
dents of the teacher-training schools.
3Ti?'3e during the X. E. A.'s investiga- j
r$?z\, are as follows:
?1. Higher salaries for trained j
teachers.
2. Higher professional standards.;
R-SastE-wWj tp hm LSHUUR bx
excluding the incompetent and u-.i-l
prepared.
3. A more general recognition by j
*he pubhc of the importance of ther
teaching profession.
4. More liberal appropriations to j
State normal schools and teacher- j
training schools in order to pay bet- i
ter salaries in these institutions and
furnish better equipment.
5. Extending the courses and
raising the standards in the teacher
.training schools.
COMMON SENSE OR HARD TIMES, j
_ I
Every evil bears within itself the'
seeds of its own cure. It is so. un- J
doubtecHy, with the economic evils
now afflicting this country.
The United States is suffering from
speculation, extravagant spending, i
wasteful consumption and subnormal
production. These might be summed
up ir. two prevalent vices, growing Out ?
of the war?-recklessness and laziness.
Along with them, and iargely as a re-!
suit of .them, are ?high prices.
The natural remedy is hard times.
The nation is headed today straight
for that goal. The evils mentioned
lead naturaly to hard times; and
hard times in turn will cure them. ]
But do the Americaja people want j
to fall back on so drastic a remedy?
There is nothing inevitable about
it. Common sense, hard work and a j
spirit of conciliation in industry and;
politics could check the ruinous pro
gress toward disaster, and set the j
country soon on the road to solid,
lasting prosperity. \
When neople themselves have pow-:
er to changv lh<* current .O'f even:.s. j
why leave the restoration to" ihe/"-siov.\ j
mericless operation of punitive' uat-j
ural .laws?
THE QUITTING HABIT.
________ i
}
A Chicago newspaper prints an en-;
i
tertaining account of the convention !
held in that city by the new Labor;
Party. It seems to have been one :
long series of withdrawals.
When the resolutions committee;
proposed to denounce prohibition, a ;
set of dry delegates withdrew and
went home. When the majority
showed itself in favor of the nation
i
alization of land, the farmer repre-j
sentatiyes withdrew. When the sov-;
i*-t form of government was urged. ?
another set of delegates withdrew,
and when the League of Nations camej
up. still another set started for home. ?
? x i
It may sound funny, but it is trag-j
ic. because it represents a vicious!
tendency that seems epidemic in the!
f'nited States jtist now.
There was the big industrial confer-:
^nce called by President Wilson. It
seemed to be making real progress to
ward the solution of some of the big.!
labOr problems, when the labor group!
withdrew, am! so broke up the con-j
fcrer.ee.
It has been the same with attempt-j
ed settlements <.f the coal strike. Ev-i
cry time the parties coneerned get
together, one group or the other]
leaves in high dudgeon, with nothing
j
accomplished.
It was practically the same with I
j
the peace treaty in the senate.
All this withdrawing in times of
crisis is childish, and ir is mischiev
j
ous. 1; ? is simply ! "quitting"'?andj
this is no time to tolerate quitters, i
What country ^heeds today more than j
anything else is for people t<> stand
up and face the music?for quarrellir.g
factions to get together and stay to ?
gcther and light out their differences!
man to man. until by attrition ind !
concession they arrive at acceptable
compromises.
"RED*' TALK IX SCHOOLS.
_ I
Chicago is undertaking a vigorous!
campaign to eliminate "red" propa
ganda from hs schools^ Getting rid
of teachers and pupils who spread
false radicalism and un-American
doctrines is. of coarse, one way oi
keeping the public schools sane and
wholesome in ideals and attitude. l*u;
it is too negative a method to achieve
the P'-st. most lasting results.
A teacher in another big city, who
comes in contact will: pupils from
everj kind of home, and of both j
foreign and native-bovn_^?amilies. says,
that she hears every day the most
astonishing remarks from sonic ofj
them. There are bitter complaints!
against the government, threats arid i
"red* talk of the most violent typo. I
She makes ii her business to talk t.
the pupil giving utterance to such
ideas*, not to scold, but to learn whet?
he heard them in the first place,
and then to show him their folly and
to tell him simply and directly what
is wrong about ihem. Wherever-she
finds a falsehood circulating through
the school room she labels it at on< e
and tries to replace it with truth.
Class feeling, bitterness and anti
social talk *can best be checked not
by repression but by replacing it with
a knowledge of real facts and an
honest view of conditions. Every
teacher Who can convince one pupil
who has heard ? red"' talk in hi
home or on the street.f that the uest
good of any individual is dependent
upon the good of all. that the w?y to
bring about changes in government is
Vy regular process and hot by bomb
throwing, has done much to eliminate'
"red" propaganda not only from the j
school, but from the homes back of
the school, and finally from the win.lei
community. i
WILHELM S ANNOTATIONS.
The former Kaiser is undone; After
all h;s frenzied disclaime/s-of respou-j
sibility for the war. he Proves his own i
guilt. He becomes a witness against !
himself, because, along with his lr>!i:i
Of reckless speech, he had the fatal
vice of ^scribbling.
The inquiry into the causes of the
war conducted by the new German i
government has dragged to the lighi !
hundreds of secret documents. Th* re !
are bales of dispatches ami rep or t's j
that were submitted to Wilhelm, bo- (
fore and during the war. and an-1
notated by him according to his cus
tom with marginal remarks.
Typical of them all is ihe comment
he penciled on the margin of a report
concerning the assassination of the
Austrian archduke at Sarajevo, two
days after that event occurred.
Ambassador Tschirschky. at Vien- j
na. had written: "I have repeatedly j
heard here*, even.among serious" peo-,
pie. that there must some day be aj
thorough reckoning with the Serb's." |
To this Wilhelm added the words, >
- - '* 1 - ? ? j
"Now or never!
When the ambassador wrote that
he had ''"seized every occasion in or- i
der nutf-iiy. but very firmly and v- J
riously, to warn against any liasty J
sl'-ps." the, indignant aild heiliget ? ?;,! j
Kaiser added', "wlio authorized lihh-j
to dp this? This,is' very stupid, ii is;
no . busim-ss of his. if ai'iorwaccls'
things go wrong we will be told .Ger-.
many was unwilling. Tsch risky..w-iilj
please stop this nonsense. Accounts]
must be settled with Serbia, and that j
soon!"
And for five years 'Wiihelm has;
persevered in the Lie that neither h-. j
nor his government had anything to j
do with Austria's treatment of Ser-j
i
b:a. which brought oji the lug war. It]
is the same with dozens of other mat-.!
ters involving the question of war!

Those marginal notes will be heard ;
from when Wilhelm is put on CriaJji
before an allied tribunal. It shovd T*j

SAFEGUARDING THE FUTURE. |
The international labor conference j
which has been meeting at Washing- j

male or female, in any industrial con

There is also a recommendation for
maternity vacations for women?six
weeks before and s;-: weeks after
