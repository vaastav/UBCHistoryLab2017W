In the first installment we
were introduced to Sidney Page,
to Joe Orummond, her boy
sweetheart, whom she promised
to marry "after years and
years," and to K. Le Moyne, tha
new roomer taken by Sidney and
her mother in order to piece out
family finances. And in this in
stallment we see Sidney step
ping into womanhood and mak
ing important decisions right
and left.
CHAPTER
2
II.
Sidney could not remember when
her Aunt Harriet hud not sat at the
table. It was one of her earliest (lis
'.llusiouiuents to learn Unit Aunt liar
riot lived with them, not because she
wished to, but because Sidney's father
had borrowed her small patrimony and
she was "boarding It out.
Eighteen years she hud "boarded It
out." Sidney llinl been born and
grown to girlhood ; the dreamer father
bud gone to his grave, with valuable
patents lost lor luck of money to re
new them gone with his faith In him
self destroyed, but with his faith in
the world undiminished for lie left his
wife and daughter without u dollar of
life Insurance.
Harriet Kennedy bad voiced her own
view of the matter, the day after tin
funeral, to one of her neighbors:
"He left no Insurance. Why should
be bother? He left me."
To the little widow, her sister, she
had been no less bitter, and more ex
plicit. "It looks to me, Anna," she said, "us
if by borrowing everythiug I had
(icorge Inul bought me, body and soul,
for the rest of my natural life. I'll
slay now until Sidney Is able to tuke
bold. Then I'm going to live my own
life. It will be a little late, but the
Kennedy's live a long time,"
The day of Harriet's leaving bud
seemed far away to Anna I'uge. Sid
ney was still her baby. She had given
up her dolls, but she still made clothes
for them out of scraps from Harriet's
sewing room. In the parlance of (lie
SI reel, Harriet "sewed" and sewed
well.
She had taken Anna into business
with her, but the burden of the part
nership had always been on Harriet.
To give her credit, she had not com
plained. She was past forty by that
I hue, nml her youth had slipped by in
that back room with Its dingy wall
paper covered with paper patterns.
(Hi the day lifter the arrival of the
t tner. Harriet Kennedy came down
to breakfast a little late. Katie, the
general-housework girl, was serving
breakfast. Sirs. I'uge, who bud taken
advantage of HurricCs tardiness to
rend the obituary column iu the morn
ing pa per, dropped it.
Hut Harriet did not sit down.
"Sidney."
"Yes, Aunt Harriet."
"Sidney, when your father died
promised In lix.k after both you and
your unit her until you were able to
take care of yourself. That was five
years ago. (if course, even before that
I had helped to support you.'
"If you would only have your coffee,
Harriet !"
Mrs. I'uge sat with her hand on the
handle of the old silver-plated coffee
pot. Harriet ignored her.
"You arc a young woman now. You
have health and energy, and you have
youlb, which I haven't. I'm past forty
lii the next twenty years, at the out
side, I've got not only to support my
self but to save something to keep
me after that, if I live."
Sidney returned her gaze steadily.
"I see. Well, Aunt Harriet, you'ri
quite right. You've been a saint to
us, but if you want to go away
"llairlctl" wulled Mrs. Page, "you're
not thinking "
"House, mother."
Harriet's eyes softened us she looked
at the girl.
"We can manage," said Sidney qui
etly. "We'll miss you, but it's time
we learned to depend on ourselves."
After that, in a torrent, came Ilurri
et's declaration of Independence. And,
mixed with its pathetic jumble of re
crlminuuiiiis, hostility to her sister's
dead husband, nud resentment for her
lost years, came poor Harriet's hopes
and ambitious, the tragic plea of a
woman who must substltnte for the op
timism and energy of youth the grim
deieruiiiiation of middle age.
"I can do good work," she finished.
"I'm full of ideas. If I could get a
chance to work them out. But there's
no chance here. There Isn't n woman
on tiie Street who knows real clothes
w hen she sees thein."
Mrs. I'oge could not get back of
Harriet's revolt to Its cause. To her,
Harriet was not an artist pleadiug for
her art ; she was a sister and a bread
winner deserting her trust.
"I'm sure," she said stiffly, "we paid
you back every cent we borrowed. If
you stnyed here after George died, it
was because yn offered to."
Her chin worked. She fumbled for
the handkerchief at her belt. But Sid
ney went around the table and flung a
young arm over her aunt's shoulders.
"Why didn't you say all thut a year
ago? We've been selfish, but we're
not ns bad as you think. And if any
one in this world Is entitled to success,
you are. Of course we'll manage."
Harriet's iron repression almost gave
wny. She covered her emotion with
details:
"Mrs. Lnrenz is going to let me
make Christine some things, and if
they're all right, I muy make her trous
seau." "Trousseau for Christine!"
"She's not engaged, bat her mother
He was a famous man who had lost
himself through fear, but found
courage in an inspiring woman's love
Mary Roberts Rinehart
tells the story
says it's only a matter of u short time
I'm going to take two rooms In the
business part of town, and put a couch
In the buck room to sleep on."
Sidney's mind flew to Christine and
her bright future, to a trousseau
bought with the Lorenz money, to
Christine settled down, a married wom
an, wllh 1'almer Howe. She cutue back
with ii n effort. Harriet had two trian
gular red spots iu her sallow chucks.
"I can get a few good models that'i
the only wny to start. And If you care
to do handwork for me, Anna, I'll send
it to you, and pay you the regular
rates. There Isn't the cull for it there
used to be, but just u touch gives
dusli."
All of Mrs. Page's grlcvunecs had
worked their way to the surface. Sid
ney and Harriet had made her world
such us It was, and her 'world was in
revolt. She Hung out her hands.
"I suppose I must do something.
With you leaving, and Sidney renting
her room and sleeping on u folding
bed In the sewing room, everything
seems upside down. I never thought
I should live to see strange men running
In and out of this house and carry
ing latchkeys." This reference to Le
Moyne, whose tall figure hud inude u
huirjed exit some time before.
Harriet's eyes were brighter already
as she went out. Sidney, kissing lie
iu Ihe hall and wishing her luck, real
I zed suddenly what a burden she mid
her mother must have been for the last
lew years. She threw lief lieud up
proudly. They would never be u bur
den ugalii never, as long as she hud
strength and health ! '
By evening Mrs. I'nge had worked
herself Into a state bordering on hys
teria. Harriet was out most of the dny
She cutue in nt three o'clock, and Ka
tie gave her a cup of ten. At the news
of her sister's condition, she merely
shrugged her shoulders.
"She'll not die, Kutle," she said
calmly, "But see thut Miss Sidney
cuts something, and if she Is worried
tell her I said to get Doctor Ed."
Very slgniliciint of Harriet's altered
out look w as tliis casuul summoning of
the Street's family doctor. She was
already dealing In larger figures. The
recklessness of pure adventure was In
her blood. She had taken rooms nt n
renlul that she determinedly put out
of her mind, and she was on her way
to buy furniture. No plrute, fitting out
a ship for the highways of the seu
ever experienced more guilty and dn
llghtful excitement.
The iiflernoon dragged awny. Doc
tor Ed was "out on a case" and might
not be in until evening. Sidney sat in the
darkened room and waved a fan over
her mother's rigid form. At half past
live Johnny Knsenfekl, from the alley.
who worked for a florist after school,
brought a box of roses, and departed
grinning Impishly. He knew Joe, hud
seen li I til In the store. Soon Hie nlley
knew that Sidney had received a dozen
Killarncy roses ut three dollars and u
half, and was probably engaged to Joe
Drummoiid.
"Doctor Ed," said Sidney, us he fol
lowed her down the stairs, "can you
spare the lime lo talk to me a little
while?"
remaps the elder Wilson bad a
quick vision of the crowded office
waiting across the Street; but his re
ply was prompt :
"Any umount of time."
Sidney led Ihe way into the small
parlor, where Joe's roses, refused by
Ihe petulant invalid upstairs, blomni'd
alone.
"First of all," said Sidney, "did you
menu what you said upstairs?"
Doctor Ed thought quickly.
"Of course; but what?"
"You said I was a born nurse."
The Street was very fond of Doctor
Ed. It did not always approve of
him. It said which was perfectly
true that he had sacrificed himself to
Ids brother's career that for the sake
of Unit brilliant young surgeon, Doc
tor Ed hud done without wife and
children ; that to send him abroad he
hud saved and skimped ; that he still
went shabby and drove the old buggy
while Max drove about in an automo
bile coupe. Sidney, not ut all of the
stuff martyrs are made of, sat in the
scented parlor, and, remembering all
Ibis, was ashamed of her rebellion.
"I'm going into a hospital," said Sid
ney.
Doctor Ed waited. He liked to have
all the symptoms before he made a
diagnosis or ventured nu opinion. So
Sidney, trying to be cheerful, and quite
unconscious of the anxiety In her voice,
told her story.
"It's fearfully hurd work, of course,"
he commented, when she had finished.
"So Is anything worth while. Look
at the way you work !"
Doctor Ed rose and wandered around
the room.
I don't think I like tho Idea," he
said nt last "It's splendid work for
an older woman. But it's life, child
life In the raw. It seems such an un
necessary sacrifice."
"Don't you think," said Sidney brave
ly, "that you are a poor person to talk
of sacrifice? Haven't you always, all
your life "
Doctor Ed colored to the roots of
his straw-colored hair.
Certainly not," he said utmost Irri
tably. "Max had genius; I had abil
ity. That's different. One real suc
cess Is better than two halves. Not"
he smiled down at her "not that I
minimize my nsefulness. Somebody
has to do the hack-work, and, If I do
sny it myself, I'm a pretty good hack."
"Very well," said Sidney. "Then I
shall be a back, too. Of course I had
thought of other things my father
wanted me to go to college but I'm
strong and willing. And one thing I
must make up my mind to. Doctor Ed ;
I shall have to support my mother."
Harriet passed the door on her way
in to a beluted supper. The man in
the parlor hud a momentary glimpse
of her slender, sagging shoulders, her
thin face, her undisguised middle age.
"Yes," he said, when she was out of
hearing. "It's hard, but I dure say
it's right enough, too. Your aunt ought
to have her chance. Only I wisli
it didn't huve to he."
Sidney, left alone, stood In the little
parlor beside the roses. She touched
them tenderly, absently. Life, which
the day before hud called her with the
beckoning linger of dreams, now
readied out grim, insistent hands.

CHAPTER III.
K. I.e Moyne had wakened early that
lirst morning in his new quarters. Be
cause he was young nnd very strong
he wakened to n certain lightness of
spirit. But he grew depressed as he
prepared for the office. Ho told him
self savagely, as he put on his shabby
clothing, that, having sought for peace
and now found It, he was an ass for
resenting it. The trouble was, of
course, thut he cume of a lighting
stock soldiers and explorers, even a
gentleman adventurer or two, had been
his forefu tliers. He loathed peace with
a deadly loathing.
Having given up everything else, K.
Lc Moyne bud also given up the love
of woman. Tlmt, of course, Is figura
tive. He had been too busy for wom
en, and now he was too idle. A smull
part of Ills brain udded figures in the
ollieo of a gas company dully, for the
sum of two dollars und fifty cents per
eight-hour working day. But the real
K. Le Moyne, that had dreamed dreams,
had nothing to do with the figures, hut
sat somewhere in his lieud and mocked
him ns he worked ut his task.
Ho breakfasted nt Mrs. McKee's.
The food wns rather good, certainly
plentiful ; nnd even his squeamish
morning appetite could find no fault
with the self-respecting tidiness of the
place. Some of the "mealers" the
Street's name for them ventured on
various small familiarities of speech
with Tillle. K. Lc Moyne himself was
scrupulously polite but reserved. He
was determined not to let the Street
encroach on his wretchedness. Because
he hud come 'to live there was no rea
son why It sliould adopt him. But he
was very polite. When the deuf-and-
dumb book ngent wrote something on a
pencil pad and pushed it toward him,
he replied in kind.
'We nre very glad to welcome you to
the McKce family," wus what was
written on the pad.
"Very happy, Indeed, to be with you,"
wrote buck I.e Moyne nnd realized
with a sort of shock that he meant it.
The kindly greeting had touched him.
The greeting and the breakfast cheered
him also, he had evidently made some
headway with Tillie.
'Don't you want a toothpick?" she
asked, as he went out.
In K's previous walk of life there
had been no toothpicks; or, if there
were any, they were kept, along with
the family scandals, in a closet. But
nearly n year of buffeting about had
taught him many things. He took one,
and placed It nonchalantly in his waist
coat pocket, as he bad seen the others
do.
Change was in the very air of the
Street thut June morning. It was in
Harriet, asserting her right to live;
In Sidney, planning with eager eyes a
life of service which did not Include
Joe; In K. Le Moyne, who had built
up a wall between himself and the
world, and was seelug It demolished by
deaf-and-dumb book agent whose
weapon was a lead pencil pad!
And yet, for a week nothing hap
pened. Joe came In the evenings and
sat on the steps with Sidney, bis hon
est heart In his eyes. Anna, no longer
sulky, accepted with childlike faith
Sidney's statement that "they'd get
along; she had a splendid scheme,"
and took to helping Harriet in her
preparations for leaving. And K. Le
Moyne, finding his little room hot In
the evenings and not wishing to In
trude on the two on the doorstep, took
to reading bis paper in the park, and
after twilight to long, rapid walks out
Into the country. The walks satisfied,
"I Don't Think I Like the Idea," He
Said.
the craving of his active body for ex
ercise, and tired him so be could sleep.
When K. was sure that the boy bad
gone, he would turn back toward the
Street. Some of the heaviness of bis
spirit always left him at sight of the
little house. Its kindly atmosphere
seemed to reach out and envelop.
Within was order und quiet, the fresh
ness of his turned-down bed, the tidi
ness of his ordered garments.
Life, that had seemed so simple, bad
grown very complicated for Sidney.
There wus her mother to break the
news to, and Joe. Harriet would ap
prove, she felt ; but these others I To
assure Anna that she must manage
alone for three yeurs. In order to be
happy uud comfortable afterward
that was hard enough. But to tell
Joe thut she was planning a future
without him, to destroy the light in his
blue eyes that hurt.
After ull, she told K. first One Fri
day evening, coming home lute as
usual, be found her ou the doorstep,
und Joe gone. She moved over hospi
tably. The moon had waxed und waned,
und the Street wus (lurk. The colored
miiu who drove Doctor Ed In the old
buggy on his duily rounds had brought
out the hose and sprinkled the street.
Within this zone of freshness, of wet
asphalt and dripping gutters, Sidney
sut, cold and silent.
"I'lense sit down. It Is cool now.
My idea of luxury Is to have the Street
sprinkled on a hot night."
K. disposed of his long legs on the
steps. He was trying to fit his own
Ideus of luxury to a garden hose and
a city street.
"I'm afraid you're working too hard."
"I? I do a ml ii I in mi) of labor for a
minimum of wage."
"But you work at ulght, don't you?"
K. was natively honest. He hesitat
ed. Then :
"No, Miss I'age."
"But you go out every evening I"
Suddenly the truth burst on her.
"Oh, deur!" she said. "I do be
lieve why, how silly of you I"
K. wus most uncomfortable.
"Ueully, I like it," ho protested. "I
hang over u desk nil day, and In the
evening I want to walk. I ramble
around the park and see lovers on
benches it's nil her thrilling."
Quite suddenly Sidney laughed.
"How very nice you are!" she suld
"und how absurd! Don't you know
that, if you insist on wulklug the
streets nnd parks at night because Joe
Drummond is here, I shall huve to tell
him not to come?"
This did not follow, to K.'s mind.
They hud rather a heated argument
over It, and became much better ac
quainted.
"If I were engaged to him," Sidney
ended, her cheeks very pink, "I I
might understand. But, as I am not "
"Ah!" said K., a trifle u'nsteudily.
So you are not?"
What do you make of K. Le
Moyne by this time? And sup
pose your daughter, at the age
of eighteen, decided to be a
trained nurse would you let her
take up the work?

EXCELLENT TRAIT IS CAUTION
Better to Be Sure Before You Move
Than to Have Occasion for
Vain Regrets.
Caution is the parent of safety. It Is
better to use caution in time than re
grets too late. It Is better to give the
mind some exercise in consideration
before beginning a new thing, remarks
the Milwaukee Journal. It Is wise to
make friends slowly. Some people like
to boast of being "so impulsive," and
think that this should lie uu acceptable
excuse for many failings. Impulse is
often a good thing, but it needs a long
course of careful training before It
can be safely indulged. First Impres
sions nre often deceiving. One may
not nt first be attractive In appear
mice, but on further acquaintance,
prove to be admirable In character.
Those who are impulsive in mnking
professions of friendship are not en
tirely to be depended on to be perma
nent or reliable. In giving wny to a
strong liking or aversion one often
does injustice. Acquaintance Is quite
us likely to show admirable us unlik
able qualities. Often an aversion has
been changed to a deep nnd true
friendship. And, on the other hand,
some who appear admirable on first
meeting, prove otherwise. Do not
judge hastily on the impulse of a mo
ment. Acts done on the impulse of
the moment may cause repentance for
many u year.
The Source of "You All."
In a recent Sunday edition there
were citations from the Old and New
Testaments and from Shakespeare,
wherein the expression "you ull" and
similar expressions were used, quoted
in Justification thereof. Allow me to
udd a classical authority, no less than
Cicero, who repeatedly used the ex
pression "vos omnes" "you all." Just
as this Is of the Augustan age of La
Unity, its high water mark In litera
ture, so "you all" Is English of the
purest type. I once was ashamed of
the speech of our southern mountain
eers, thinking that it arose from ig
norance und lack of cultivation, bat I
have since realized that they were
speaking a purer type of English than
were our college men, believing, as I
now do, that the nearer the source the
purer the Issue therefrom. Letter to
