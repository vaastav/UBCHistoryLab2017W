How GEN. GRANT DEALS WITH RKBEL
SYMPATHIZERS.—The following order of
Gen. Grant Bhows his way of dealing with
rebel* and rebel sympathizers:
.CHATTAKOOOA, Tenn., Nov. 5,1863.
GENERAL ORDERS, NO. 4.—The habit of
raiding parties of rebel cavalry visiting
towns, villages and farms where there are
no Federal forces, and pillage Union fam
ilies, having become prevalent, depart
ment commanders will take immediate
steps to abate the evil, or make the loss
bysuph raids fall upon Secessionists and
Seoession sympathisers of the neighbor
hood where such actsjare committed. For
•very act of violence to the person of an
unarmed Union citizen a Secessionist will
be arrested and held as hostage for the de
livery of the offender. For every dollar's
wortn of property taken from such citizens
or destroyed by raiders, an assessment will
be made upon Secessionists of the neigh
borhood and collected by the nearest mili
tary forces, under the supervision of the
commander thereof, and the amount thus
collected paid over to the sufferers. When
such assessments cannot be collected in
money, property useful to the Government
may be taken at a fair valuation, and the
amount paid in money by a disbursing of
ficer of the Government, who will take
such property up on his returns. Wealthy
Secession citizens will be assessed in money
and provisions for the support of Union
refugees who have been and may be driven
rom their homes and into our lines by
the acts of those with whom such Secession
citizens are in sympathy. All collections
and payments under this order will be
through disbursing officers of the Govern
ment, whose accounts must show all money
and property received under it, and how
disposed of.
By order of Major-General TJ. S. Grant
T. S. BOWERS,
Assistant Adjutant General.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.—The plan
presented by President Lincoln in his An
nual Message for the restoration of the in
surgent States to the authority and rights
abdicated by their rebellion, will attract
the widest attention both in this country
and in Europe. Hitherto the attorneys of
treason on the stump, and in the journals
of the loyal States, have urged the useless
neas of desisting from rebellion as an ex
cuse for persistence therein. "If they
should withdraw their support from the
rebel leaders and return to loyalty and
fidelity, you will nevertheless
confiscate all
their property and divest them of ever"v
civil and political right so why should
they? What is to be their motive—their
inducement?" The President has answer
ed the question and silenced the cavil.
Every person now within the territory'of
the Rebellion, with the exception of two or
three thousand of its more conspicuous and
determined chiefs, may secure a fall par
don to-morrow, and be restored to all his
former privileges as a loyal citizen of the
United States, with his property intact
(save that which may have already been
oonfiscated arid sold,) on the easv condition
of his swearing allegiance to the United
States, and to abide by and acquiesce in
the acts of Congress and Executive Procla
mations affecting the status of slaves, "s
long and so far as not repealed, modified,
or declared void by Congress, or by a de
cision of the Supreme Court." Here is re
quired no assumption of the universal effi
ciency and irrevocable validity of those
acts and proclamations, but a simple agree
ment to respect and abide by them, and
each of them, until the same shall be inval
idated either by Congress or the Supreme
Court of the United States. How can any
who mean to be loyal at all, object to these
conditions? Ninety of every hundred of
the rebels may be restored to every right to
morrow without sacrificing or relinquish
ing any particle of their property while
ninertentns of the residue are required to
relinquish nothing but their right to op
press and sell their fellow men. We be
lieve Tennessee, Louisiana, and Arkansas
may be reorgnized and restored to the Un
ion on this basis at an early day, and that
the residue will gradually follow.
Henceforth it can neither be truthfully
nor plausibly said that those who have
onoe Deen rebels have no inducement to re
turn to loyalty, no hope but in the triumph
of Disunion. They may oome back to-inor
row and enjoy every political or social
privilege ana advantage
enjoyed or claimed
Djr any of us. We proffer them equality
with ourselves. Should not that suffice
and content them?
The country must now realize that
naught but Slavery obstructs the way to
Peaoe and Reunion. In no metaphoric or
poetic sense, the Union and Liberty, are
henceforth inseparable. They will either
rejoice in a common deliverance and tri
umph or till the same bloody grave.
Or eoune, the master-spirits of the re
volt vriU not be conciliated. They have
staked their all upon the cast, and must
stand the hazard of the die. But what pos
sible motive will a non-slaveholder have
for persisting in rebellion after receiving
due notioe of the issuing of this Proclama
tion? Merciless bands may still scour the
region cursed by the revolt, and drag every
man and youth into the rebel cainps—often
by the help of bloodhounds but to what
end shall the non-slaveholding conscripts
remain and fight? Wbat thev risk and
lose by contumacy is obvious where is the
counterbalancing gain? Depend on it, this
Proclamation, if hecpuded and sustained
in the loval States will go far to break the
baok'Off the Rebellion.
In Europe, it Will bo even more general
ly efficient, The fendish malevolence be
trayed bv the Secession oracles is rarely or
never exhibited in l^urope through quota
tions fKtn- the jwnrnhls yet npjie can fail
to realize tho regretful tenderness and
kindly charity wherewith the rebel mas
ses are contemplated by the President.—
Though his official terms of service has
been renderad &nxious and troubled by
their treason, ho has never ceased to regard
them aa deoeived sad misled, and to de
sire tbolr apoody return 1o loyalty and
eace, The more influential British and
Piench journals oonceal this, so
far as pos
sible, from their readers yet the truth
gradually makes itself known and respect
ed. But when the loyal North, through
the President, proffers amnesty and resto
ration on the single condition of acquies
cence in Universal Freedom until Oon-
§aat
rfes& or the Supreme Court shall decide
this is a condition which the President
had no right to impose, why should any
stand-out?
And how can Liberal Europe withhold
her ardent active sympathy from the cause
thafo&ks nothing of its deadly enemies but
that they' let the oppressed go free? "The
Times will misrepresent and The Saturday
Review defame us as usual the aristocracy
may still frown or sneer but the masseB of
Europe, already instinctively our friends,
wtfl be impelled by this proffer to a more
general ana hearty enthusiasm in behalf of
that Union which now represents, even
more emphatically than hitherto, the aspi
rations of bowed and struggling Labor
throughout the civilized world. Thanks,
then, to our President, for the wise human
ity and generous impulses which prompted
the issue of his Proclamation of amnesty!
It must be that in this sign we shall.con
quer.—N. Y. Tribune.
AN INDICATION
OF
MUTILATING
EABNE§TNESS.—The
hearts of loyal men everywhere were
cheered, almost beyond expression, by the
recent action of the Government in rela
tion to Smithson, the Washington banker,
arid Stetler the Philadelphia contractor.—
The former was convicted of holding trea
sonable correspondence with the rebels, the
latter of defrauding the Government in
coffee contracts for the army, and each of
the offenders is to have a five years' resi
dence in the Penitentiary at Albany, New
York. Their conviction and puisbment is
particularly agreeable because that in ad
dition to their own short-comings they
stand as representative men of two classes,
large and troublesome, who have been'of
incalculable injury to the cause of loyalty
since the war commenced. Mr. Smithson
was one of those men who, while they gave
their hearts andtth?ir sympathies to the
rebellion, lacked the courage and the man
liness to follow their sympathies in person,
aud prudently kept their bodies where nei
ther the shock of battle nor Davis' con
scription could reach them. Taking ad
vantage of the social and business posi
tions they occupied they have had rare fa
cilities for serving their Southern friends,
and all these opportunities have
been faith
fully improved. It is no wonder that the
plans, laid as it was supposed in security
and matured with care aud silence at
our national capital, should reach the re
bels even before they were sent to the
army commanders, when we remember
that Smithson and many more traitors of
the same stamp have been open-eared to
gather all such intelligence and Open
mouthed to disclose it. The arrest of
this £aiue traitorous banker or some
one of bis confreres, a year ago,
would have been a warning voice
to these secret agents, and would
have saved us many a dollar and many a
precious life. But lor reasons, prudential
or otherwise, the axe of justice nas not fall
en until now. But it has fallen neverthe
less, and it is not yet too late to expect a
wholesome and healthy influence to result
from the example. Men may as well be
gin to learn that the government that has
ever nourished and supported them can
not always be plotted against with impu
nity. It has been long suffering and patient
until patience and forbearance have ceased
to be desirable, and the hour of earnest ac
tion has come at last. Tardily but surely
the majesty of law and the power of gov
ernment are to be exemplified and vindi
cated.
The case of Mr. Stetler is none the less
instructive. Professing loyalty and busi
ness integrity, he was entrusted with con
tracts lor the army. A staple article of
every day consumption was to be furnish
ed at abundant and remunerative prices.
But the legitimate gainsof business did not
satisfy Mr. Stetler's avarice, and he sought
to enrich himself still more by deception
and fraud. He sacrificed the remains of a
blunted conscience and gave up every lin
gering feeling of self-respect, hoping thus
to increase his wealth. Good name, honor
and all were staked against the almighty
dollar, but even the almighty dollar did
not shield him from merited punishment.
He too has had his reward and the salu
tary effects of the government's action in
his case have already been seen in the re
mittances of ill-gotten gains from con
science smitten contractors. The men
who are soulless enough to coin money
from the sufferings of our brave soldiers
and who are strangers to every feeling of
honor and every sense of shame, can still
be morad by measures of severity. And
now tb*t the government has found the
lever that can move traitors and thieves
we trust the lever will be faithfully used
until traitors and thieves shall find that
loyalty and honesty are politic as well as
jjjgfc— Springfield Repub.
OUR
DJ
AD.—The Chatta­
nooga correspondent of the Cincinnati
Commercial says:
The stories so often published of the mu
tilation of our dead by the rebels have us
ually been looked upon as gross exaggera
tions, invented by correspondents for the
purpose of keeping up the hatred of the
patriotic people of the North against
our common enemy, and inspiring them
with a determination of exterminating
them. I confess that I was loath to believe
the tales of horror. But I am no longer
skeptical when I have the testimony of
the rebel journals confirming the stories
my faith is strengthened. A few weeks
ago, the Chattanooga-Marietta Rebel, refer
ring to the field of Chickamauga,.admitted
that some of the heads of our soldiers lay
grinning on stumps, severed from their
bodies, and to-day, officers, whose word
will be taken anywhere in this depart
ment, bring the news that, on visiting the
field on Saturday, a number of heads were
displayed on stumps and poles, while the
mutilated bodies lav on the ground, par
tially devoured by birds of prey, hogs and
dogs! A large proportion of our dead,left
on the field, were found unburied, and
their bones bleaching in the sun and rain.
Gen. Gross' brigade, of the 4th Army
Corps, were yesterday engaged in giving
interment to the slain. The sight is de
scribed as sickening in the extreme.—
Trunks of the slain, minus arms and legs,
naked bodies, half decayed, bones, the
flesh from which had been devoured by
hogs, (probably weeks since, turned into
commissary stores for feeding the rebel ar
my, i arms in one place, legs in another
partially devoured, lay upon the ground,
while the vultures and carrion birds held
high carnival over the feast of dead men,
and the smell was so intense that men of
the strongest nerves closed their eyes upon
the scene in disgust.
The silver product of Nevada Territory
will this year, it is estimated, amount to
815,000,000, and in two years more, it is
thought, it will be fully $30,000,000, A wri
ter in the San Francisco Bulletin, who has
studied the subject on the spot, holds that
Nevada is the "richest silver-bearing coun
try in the world. Unlike California, her
wealth'is not where you find it,' but her
'silver runs iu veins.'
Th eland Leader states that the son
of John C. ttreckenridge, who was taken
prisoner at Chattonooga, accompanied the
escort of thfc bodies of Colonel Creighton
and Crane, as far as Nashville, aud that in
conversation with Sergeant-Major Tisdel,
ho declarod himself strongly in favor of the
.Union. He said that had been forced into
the 'Confederate service by his father. The
young man thinks it would only necessary
to put down the leaders of the rebellion to
secure a profipt and honorable peace.—

cantamiaation is variously caused by mercurial
disease, low hvinp, disordered digestion from
'unhealthy foed, fro pur* air, filth and filthy
habits, the depressing vines, and, above aU, by
the venereal infection. Whatever be its origin,
it 'is hereditary in the constitution, descending
from parents to children unto the third and
fourth generation indeed, seems to be the
rod of Him who says, I will visit the iniqui-.
ties of the fathers upon their children." The
diseases which it originates take various names,
according to the organs it attacks. In tho
lungs, Scrofula produces tubercles, and finally
Consumption in the glands, swellings which
suppurate and become ulcerous sores in the
stomach and bowels, derangements which pro
ddce indigestion, dyspepsia, and lives, com
plaints on the skin, eruptive and cutaneous
affections. These all having the same origin,
require the same remedy, viz. purification and
invigoration of the blood. Purify the blood,
and these dangerous distempers leave you.
With feeble, foul, or corrupted blood, you can
not have health with that life of the flesh
healthy, you cannot have scrofulous disease.
Ayer's Sarsaparilla
is compounded from the most effectual anti
dotes that medical science has discovered for
this afflicting distemper, and for the cure of the
disorders it entails. That it is far superior to
any other remedy yet devised, is known by all
who have given it trial. That it does com.
bine virtues truly extraordinary in their effect
upa this class of complaints, is indisputably
proven by the great multitude of publicly
known and remarkable cures it has made of
the following diseases
We know the public have been deceived by
many compounds of Sarsaparilla, that promised
much and did nothing but they will neither be
deceived nor disappointed in this. Its virtues
have been proven by abundant trial, and there
remains no question of its surpassing excellence
for the cure of the afflicting diseases it is in
tended to reach. Although under the 6ame
name, it is a verv different medicine from any
other which has been before the people, and is
far more effectual than any other which has
ever been available to them.
