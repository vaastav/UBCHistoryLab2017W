Nashville, Tenn., Dec 15. At yes
terday afternoon's session of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor the Hawaiian
annexation question came tip on a re
port -from the committee on resolu
tions and produced considerable dis
cussion. The committee reported on a
resolution opposing the annexation of
Hawaii, offered by T. J. Elderkin and
presented the following substitute:
Whereas, Tfcere Is at present pending la tie
Cn-ted States senate a treaty providing for the
Annexation of the Hawaiian islands; and,
"Whereas, That annexation would be tanta
mount to the admis-ion cf a slave state, the
representatives of which would necessarily
work and vote for the enslavement cT labor in
sreneral: therefore, be it
Resolved, By the American Federation of
Labor, that we disapprove of annexation: and,
Eesolved. That we xxrse the United States
senata to reject the treaty of annexation and
to tiie such other steps as may be nncessary
to maintain amicable relations wKb. Hawaii.
George E. McNeill suggested that
the substitute be amended so as to pro
vide for the incoming executive coun
cil laying the matter before congress,
and, if necessary, before the president,
showing the opposition of the federa
tion to annexation. The substitute,
as amended, was adopted.
The resolution relative to an eight
hoar day movement was referred to a
special committee, as was the convict
labor question. A resolution was
adopted providing for the organiza
tion of all stationary engineers, pre
paratory to making the fight for an
eight-hour day on May 1, 1833.

a resolution recommending the estab
lishment of postal savings banks by
congress and advising the secretary to
issue a circular urging immediate ac
tion in the matter. A motion to have
a bill drafted by the incoming execu
tive committee, providing lor the es
tablishment of postal savings banks,
and secure its introduction in congress

GOMPtRS' ANNUAL ADDRESS.
Interesting Statistics of the Growth and
Power of the Federation or UDor.
NashYille, Tenn.. Dec 14. The Na
tional Federation of Labor began its
17th annual session in this city yester
day with an attendance of about 93
delegates. President Gompers presid
ed. Havelock, Wilson and Edward
Harford, delegates from England. were
introduced by the president. William
Aimison, of - the local Typographical
union, delivered an address of welcome.
President Gompers said, in his annual
address:
With two exceptions all our alnliated na
tional unions report a large increase cf local
onions aud membership. There is an increase
of about 34.0OJ members in the organizations
amiatei. The strikes of this year, with few
exceptions, have been for higher wages, shorter
tours and recognition of union principles. Our
;anizat ions report, with gratifying unanimi
ty, the very large number of successes secured,
the advantages gained and the growth and ex
tension of the power of organization enjoyed.
The movement to reduce the hours of labor la
always one which commands the first attention
of organized labor. We hold that no cond.tioa
is satifac:ory nor any solution complete which
tails to eliminate the curse and the degradiuj
influences of non-employment, and S3 long a
this evil shall be with us our best efforts wul
be concentrated to the reduction of the hours
of labor of all until the desired end is attained.
During the year, according to the
secretary's report, 270 strikes were offi
cially noticed, involving 105,407 work
ers. Of these 1S9 were won, SI com
promised and 33 lost. During the year
217 charters were issued to national,
state, central, local andfederal labor
unions. Two charters for state feder
ations were issued to Ohio and Mis
souri. Treasurer J. B. Lennon sub
mitted his report, showing the income
of the federation from November 1,
1S0G, to November 1, 1S07, to be $21,803
and the expenses S19.113, leaving a bal
ance of S2rC4.
ECKELS AT ST. LOUIS.
He Uives His Reasons for Believing Ameri
ca's Financial System Is Weak.
St. Louis, Dec 14. Comptroller J.
II. Eckels, who is in the city as a guest
of the Commercial club, delivered a
speech before that body last night,
taking as his subject, "A Great Na
tion's Weakness." He said in part:
This nation stands out from all its sister na
tions as having monetary and financial laws
which invite public disgrace and private disas
ter. The government now presents the
rather pitiable spectacle of a boasted
great nation resting its monetary in
tegrity upon the mere chance of
having a man of sound principles and strong
sense of right in the executive chair. If by
the accident of election a man of unsound
monetary views or weate will should be placed
in oSce the whole financial fabric would co to
pieces and the country would find itself with
out credit at home or standing abroad.
The banks of the countrv are strong enough
to undertake the issue of all the credit cur
rency that circulates. If they are too weak to
support a safely guarded bank note issue based
upon assets by which the commercial needs
of the country only can be responded
to. the movement is not less . weac
The insolveucy of the one would
mark the insolvency of the other, for
when at point is reached where the combined
assets of the country's banks will not bear the
volume of currency needed to carry on th'
country's business, the government, as well as
the individual, will be hopelessly Involved In
bankruptcy.

Remarkable Coat Life of Henry Ably, a
Sheffield (Ia.) Bosloess Mao.
Eeixe Plalne, I a., Dec 14. Justice
is likely to be frustrated in the re
markable case of Henry Ably, of Shef
field. This man, worth S50.000, who
for years has successfully played the
role of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, now
lies in the Franklin county jail
wounded unto death. He received his
injuries while perpetrating a robbery,
and his sensational career is soon to
end. He has for years plundered the
country round, has acted as a fence
for other robbers, and possessed one
of the finest kits of burglars' tools
ever turned out- His daring rec
ord has seldom been equaled in
the annals of romance. A ruthless
robber by nights, he became in the
daytime apparently an exemplary citi
zen. He took a leading part in the de
velopment of local affairs in Sheffield,
and his contributions to public enter
prises and churches enabled him for
years to conceal his true identity and
to carry on his nefarious business al
most with impunity. As the force of
habit grew upon him he became bold
er, and finally was shot in one of his
burglarious exploits. The grand jury
has returned 11 indictments against
Ably and fixed bail atS15,S0O.

hours, adjourned out ot sympatny tor

time of the session was devoted to the
consideration of the legislative, execu

was decided to postpone consiaeranuu

So absorbing is the topic that almost
the entire time, despite the fact tnat
th nniiipration of the Question had
been technically postponed, was con
sumed in the debate upon it.
Mr. Bingham, of Pennsylvania, in

said he would offer amendments

however, that the provision of the bill
relating to the civil service ana tne ue-

was agreed to, and an hour and a half
was set aside for general debate on ine

government, exclusive oi tne puouc
debt, the last eight years, exceeded
the figures of the preceding eight
years 81,000,000,000 in round numbers.
In view of this fact there were only
two ways, be said, to bring the re
ceipts and expenses together. Either
taxation must be increasea or expenses
curtailed. If the expenses were to oe
reduced, congress alone could not ac
complish much without the aid of the
executive branch of the government
Despite the president's appeal in his
message for economy, the executive
branches of the government had sub
mitted to congress estimates for appro
priations 827,000,000 in excess of the
appropriations for the current year.
At this point the committee rose, and
the house adjourned until to-day.
A petition signed by nearly 100 citi
