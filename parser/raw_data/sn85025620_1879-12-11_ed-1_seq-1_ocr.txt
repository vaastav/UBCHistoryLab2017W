E old powder magazine built by
the Union forces, which stood on Maoi
street in the edge of the old cemetery at
Va., baa been torn down. This is the
last of the works left from the war. The
fortifications which were around the
grounds now occupied by the megnifi
cent buildings ot Central University have
long since disappeared.
at deficit in the sug.r-beet crop is
reported as between 33 and 50 per cent,
less this year than last. It will have an
important bearing on the price of cane
sugar, when it is remembered that beet
sugar is identical with that of cane sug
ar, and that the beet sugar manufacture
covers about one-third of the sugar pro
duct of the world.
A PATRIARCH of tho forest has been
lately felled in California, and the great
er portion of the wood taken to San
Francisco. It was known by the epithet
of'Old Moses.' It one might infer
with accuracy its age from the numoer
ot its rings, it must have been 4,480 years
old. Its capacity is said to have been
so great that 300 persons could find room
within its trunk.
IT seems a fact that the great cattle
feeding districts of the West, and especi
ally of Illinois, raise less and less of the
cattle they fatten year by year. Tne
amount of corn raised increases steadily.
On the other hand, the breeding of swine
keeps pare more nearly with the produc
tion of fat hogs. Would it not be a good
plan to breed more and buy less, and be
more profitable in the end.
A N Eastern contemporary says. The
beet-sugar question in Maine is now ap
proaching a point when we shall proba
bly know whether it can be manufactured
and furnished at a price to compete with
the imported article. We all know that
sugar can readily bo made from beets,
sorghum, cane, etc., but we have not yet
seen that it can be made with sufficient
profit Irom beets and sorghum to bring
it into thecatalogu of national industries.
THR Pekin Gazette is nearly twenty-five

"Yes, we have several names on the list

The Titusville, Pa., Herald has pub

Tracy, the young lawyer who was hung at
Simthport, McKee county, Pa., for the murder
of his cousin, Miss Mary Reilly, in Sept
1878 The account makes four columns in
the Herald, and is written in remarkably well
chosen and chaste language, and in itself is
intcieating. It was prepared during the lal]
ter months of Tracy's incarceration at a great
expenditure of time and labor, and perhaps
few posthumous statements have ever ap
peared in mere highly attractive form Tracy
claims that the deed was not murder, but was
instigated by his lntenre love for Miss Reilly,
whom he says he could not bear to think of
marrying another Their love, it seems, was
mutual, but her objections to their marriage
was their near blood relationship. He pays a
beautiful tribute to her memory he case is
one that created the most intense interest
throughout Pennsylvania and western New

CHICAGO SPECULATION.
Wild Day OH 'Change—Bow the Market
flits Up and Down.
[Chicago Tribune of Saturday,]
At the opening of the market yesterday
morning there was a rash of orders to buy,
as usual, on account of parties outside, and
prices advanced under the competition
between purchasers. Wheat went up about
one-fourth eent, and pork about a quarter of
a dollar per barrel. But the buying orders
were not so numerous ss on previous days,
aud it soon became evident that sellers were
in the majority. The party who bought eo
muoh pork the previous day commenced to
sell, offering it in rather large blocks, and the
idea that he was unloading all that he had
previously purchased struck the provision
crowd with a general panic. Within twenty
five minntes from the first sale pork had de
clined ninety-five cents from the top figure
of the day, amid the wildest conceivable
rush on all sides to sell, and the varying wil
lingness to buy the property. After the
market had gone down about 26 cents, the
number of would-be sellers was increased by
those who were,m the language of trade being
"BQUEXUD OUT Of THB DBAI*"
that is, the price had declined so low that
they were unable to pay up the margins
which they were momentarily expecting
would be called for. As a consequence, the
transactions were unusually large. It was
impo Bible, amid the wild confusion, to
make note of all the sales that transpired,
but it is probable that the entire sales of the
day aggregated not far from 195,000 barrels
of pork alone, being a quantity but little
abort of the usual production of barreled
pork during what is known as the regular
winter season of four months.
TBSLABDKABKBT
was affected by the^deehne in pork, but not
to an equal extent It dropped about 46
cents per 100 pounds, while pork was de
clining 95 cents on the barrel. Both re
acted about 11 o'clock in the day, and by
noon the market was regarded
ss comparatively steady. It then
slowly advanced to within a small fraction
of the latest prices of Thursday afternoon,
again eased off, and closed on 'Change rather
steadily, but weakened in the afternoon,
and pork olosed at 20 oents below the latest
pnoes of Thursday, while lard olosed at 16
oants below the dosing quotations of that
day.
Although the grain markets were weaken
ed, they did not decline so muoh as provis
ions, the difference between the top and
bottom prices of the day in
WBXAT AND CORN
being about 2 per cent Wheat declined 2%
cents during tne break in pork, and corn fell
off 1)6 cents, both reacted when provisions
turned upward, and touched about the latest
prices of Thursday. The feeling in the
afternoon was a shade easier, bat olosed
to oent lower, and the latest dis
advantage in corn wss only about
eent as compared with the previous day.
There was a good deal of speculation as to
an independent cause for the decline in
grain. Some people who were watching the
market asserted stoutly that wheat wss
breaking because the party of capitalists
supposed to be led by David Dows A Co., of
New York, had been unloading quietly for
two or three days past upon the brokers of
Jim Keene, aomeving a substantial revenge
for a similar opetation performed by Keene
WBaB*
S
SJ-v
upon them last spring. This, however, wss
doubted by many, aud the doubt seemod a
reasonable one, seeing that the decline was
relatively small, and that the market reacted
the moment that the pressure in pork wss
relieved. The grain markets were really
stronger by comparison in the after part of
the fay, and the confidence of Western
trade*) seemed to be completely restored
before the dose of the day's trading.
IT IB MOTKWOBTHX
that the down turn in prices was not war
ranted by the tone of advices from the other
aide. Liverpool reported a firmer feeling in
8ndn the French markets in
wheat were stated to be tending Upward, and
the English markets for pork and lard aver
aged about 1 s. per 112 pounds higher than
the latest previous quotations, while several
export orders received here for meats during
the day showed that the quotations of an ad
vance were not fictitious. Some orders for
meats were filled mat fully previous prices
almost at the time that pork and lard were
selling at the lowest figures of the day.
TBI MOST BXABONABUt SUPPOSITIOH
that the strength of the foreign advices
wss taken as a one by holders to selL They
expected to be unable to unload with less of
a bsag£' is the markets than if the telegrams
had been of a oharaoter less favorable to
strength. If so, they miscalculated the ait
nation. Their example was followed by
soon a great number of others that the mar
ket was not only borne down much below
the point they had calculated, but the com
petition of the others was so great that they
were unable to dispose of a small proportion
of the property that they wished to unload.
Some of the conservative operators on
'Change regarded the exdtement of yester
day as a legitimate sequel to the excitements
of the previous two or three months, which
they considered to have deddedly advanced
the prices of both grain end provisions
above a point at which they could be sus
tained thus early in the winter. Most of
them seemed to think that the demand from
the old countries will be big enough before
next harvest to absorb every pound of our
surplus stuff, but that the Europeans are al
ready so well supplied that they will need to
take comparatively little at the high rates of
freight which railway rapacity imposes dur
ing the wmter months, and will be able to
hold back until the rai mg of the ice block

THE CBKDIT
for pulling down pork was generally passed
by the knowing ones to a person on the
board fondly and familiarly known as Zip
Adams, the reputed possessor of 100,000 bar
rels. The story was that be sent out a small
army of brokers yesterday morning, with in
structions to throw the fat flesh, and that
they threw it all directions. Others fol
lowed suit, and, once started, the unloading
process went on until the break naturally
came. Just as natural was the reaction
which followed later in the day, and if the
same story should be repeated to-day nobody
will be taken off his feet witn surprise. So
far as heard from, nobody was caught be
tween the upper and tbe nethev millstone
yesterday, that is, nob. dy was squeezed,
crippled, or badly pinched. The boye were,
all lucky enough to save themselves, some of
them to get frozen out, perhaps, another day.
THE LANDLORD'S STORY.
During the Yv.ntet of 187 while tiav
ehng through the ^astern part of Ontario,
a terrible snow-storm made the roads, lor
a time, impassabie, aud I was obliged to
remain for several days in K, a small
town lying on the Canada side of the
river St Lcwrence, and directly opposite
a somewhat smaller village in the State
of New York.
During this time I was the guest ot the
only hotel that the place afforded, and
was greatly pleased to find that the land
lord was an intelligent, well-informed,
jovial gentleman, thoroughly acquainted
with every incident and circumstance in
the history of that section of country cal
culated to interest a traveler who, like
myself, had several long winter evenings
to dispose of.
One of the stoiies related by my host
I recollect distinctly, and, in order that
you may hear it in nearly the same lan
guage in which it was told me at the
time, I will repeat, as nearly as my
memory serves me, the words of the land
lord.
When I built this hotel—in '55, I
think it was—my first hostler, or man-of
all-work, was a negro boy, who had ap
peared in the village a short time before.
When I first saw him, he was in a plight
pitiable indeed shoeless, footsore, hun
gry, his clothing—what there was oi it—
IQ tatters, he was a spectacle well calcu
lated to awaken the sympathies of any
one not wholly indifferent to the suffer
ings of a fellow creature. He was anx
ious to work, and was more than willing
to do all in his power, in any capacity,
in return for something to wear. As he
appeared honest, earnest and capable, I
employed him, agreeing to furnish him a
good home, provide his clothing, and
give him, in addition, such wages as he
appeared to deserve
The poor fellow was anything but
dilatory in accepting my offer, and for a
long time I had in him a faithful and
most capable servant. Honest, industri
ous and obliging, he appeared to make
friends with all who came to the hotel.
Ouests frequently expressed themselves
highly pleased with the interest he man
ifested in making everything pleasant
icr them, and often, when a party of them
required the services of one having a
thorough knowledge of the country, or
wished to bo rowed to the opposite vil
lage or down the river, Tom was the
available man.
After he had been with me three or
four years we weic visited by two men
giving their names as Thompson and
Gordon, representing themselves as com
ing from Vermont in search of timber
lands, as well as an eligible f.te upon
which to erect a large saw mill, and stat
ing their determination to explore the
country on both sides of the rivrr.
Why it was I cannot explain, but, from
the time of their coming, I had forebod
ings that all was not right. My guests
were thin, wiry, dark-faced, and did not
any respect resemble the Vermont
Yankee as I had known him. However,
there was nothing suspicious in this, I
thought, as they might have lived in Ver
mont only a short time before coming
here but, fight against it as I might, I
often found myself watching them with
more than usual attentiveness.
On the second day following their ar
rival I was approached by Gordon, who
asked the amount of their bill, after pay
ing which he said:
"We wish to cross the river this after
noon, provided we can get some one who,
for a dollar or two, will do the rowing.
There appears to be more or less floating
ice, and we do not care to try it alone."
I at onco offered to furnish a boat, and
suggested that, for the money, Tom
would willingly take them to the other
side as soon as they were ready.
Thompson, who had heard most of what
I had been saying, expressed himself well
pleased with the arrangement, and, every
thing being in readiness, dusk found
them at the water's edge ready to push
off into the stream.
I had accompanied them thus far mere
ly as an act of courtesy and to wish them
good luck, but it then occured to me that
by going over with them I could attend
to certain business in the opposite village
and save a journey at some future time
for that purpose only.
As I stepped into'the boat I noticed an
expression of surprise on the faces of my
recent guests, and in a moment, in fact
before I had taken my seat, ene of them
asked "if I intended to go, too,' and up
on my saying that I did, and giving my
reasons for having changed my calcula
tions, the other inquired, rather sharply,
"if I couldn't arrnnge my matters at
some other time."
"O," I replied, "I hardly suppose it
would make any difference to you, and
sol—''
"Yes but we have special business on
the other side," interposed Gordon.
"Then I shall not trouble you after we
leave the boat," I answered, for by that
time I was provoked, and immediately
added: "Pull away, Tom,"
Tom did as directed, and the long
strong sweep of his oars (for he had
grown to be a powerful fellow during the
time he had been with mfl) was soon
placing a goodly distance between us and
the Canada side.
Although I could see that my presence
was anything but agreeable to my late
guests, yet we were soon talking about
the probabilities of having a clear day
on the morrow, etc., and 1 would thought
no more of our little difference at the
start, had not my previonsly-awakened
suspicions caused me to notice, particu
larly, everything that was said and done
by them.
When about two-thirds across the river,
Gordon, (more to keep up the conversa
tion than any thing else, I thought) asked
if I had any tobacco, and, upon being an
swered in the negative, turned with the
same question, to Thompson, who replied
that he "had a little Kaintuck."
Hardly had the words been uttered
when a terrific yell, rivalling that of a
Comanche Indian, came from the boat,
followed by a loud splash, and—Tom was
gone.
In the growing darkness it was lmpos
sible to distinguish him from a floating
cake of ice. Whether he had struck one
and was stunned, or whether he was held
down by one, was equally uncertain, as
no answer came to my frantic and oft-re*
peated "Tom, Tom, where are you?"
My attention was now drawn to my re
maining companions. For a moment
they could not understand the turn af
fairs had taken, but when they fully real
ized the full import of what bad occured,
their rage was without limits. Language
utterly failed to express their chagrin
that Tom should have escaped when they
could have secured him so easily (tor I
now understood the true business of these
"lumber dealers from Vermont," and re
collected that, two or three months be
fore, a Southern gentleman, upon seeing
Tom, inquired particularly concerning
the circumstances under which I bad em
ployed him.)
Nothing was left for us to do but to
reach shore, which wc did after a short
pull at the oars. Alter the first burst ot
anger, my companions maintained a dog
ged silence, and as we touched the shore
were joined by two other "lumber deal
ers," who appeared to be expecting tbem.
They left me without a word, and were
soon lost to view.
As I could not think of returning at
night, alone. I went at once to the house
of a friend, to whom I related the whole
affair. After talking the matter over, we
concluded that we could render Tom no
assistance that night, and that the best
course to pursue was to keep the matter
quiet for a few days, and see if he would
not turn up on Canada side again. This
was more than likely, as he was a capital
swimmer, and as unconcerned under a
boat as in one generally.
On the following morning I
crossed the river and came directly
to the house. How to account
for my being alone was a problem
that I was called upon to solve. Tom
would be missed at once, I was confident
of that. And whether it was advisable
to tell the whole story at one?, or to ex
plain his absence in some'other way, I
could not decide. If he were still on the
New York side, he might be detained by
parties that I knew to be in sympathy
with my disappointed visitors. But once
on British soil no harm could befall him.
Guided by these reasons, I determined to
say as little as possible concerning the
manner in which he had so suddenly
disappeared.
However it was not made necessary for
me to invent any plausible explanation
in order to stifle inquiry, for I entered
the hotel only to be met and welcomed
by Tom.
Surprised beyond measure, I could on
ly grasp the honest fellow's hand and
gaze in mock astonishment into his round,
laughing face. He was the first to speak.
"Well, sah," said he," I neber suppos
ed anyting war wrong wid dem fellahs
till I jes heah dat ar one word Kaintuck,
an' then it went right through dis chiles
head to woust, an'I climb out ob dat ar
boat an' heah I is,' and the way in
which Tom danced around the room was
remarkable.
"Well, Tom,'1 I now managed to say,
"you are no more glad than I am because
ot your narrow escape, and in the future
I shall never expect you to cross the
river under any circumstances."
"Much obliged to you, sah, much
obliged to you," said Tom "but I don't
stay in dis yeah place no mo', and in
spite of all I said he collected his things
into a bundle, and thanking me with
tears in his eyes for what I had done for
Inin, shouldered his pack and started
north to seek a home anew.
"And you have never heard from him
since?" I inquired, as the landlord com
pleted hia story.
'•O, yes when the war closed he went
to Chicago, where he is doing a good
business has five or six thousand djllars
ahead and anticipates no trouble from
Vermont lumber dealers. I hear from
him occasionally. He is coming out to
see me in the spring."
The Paris Editor.
Paris editors take their professional
duties easily. Many of the most conspic
uous of them always have been active po
liticians, probably with seats in the
chamber, and with other irons in the fire.
They press their opinions in the signed
contributions which may one day be the
stepping stone to high office. As they
object to evening work for many reasons,
it is hard to get a suitable man to edit a
morning journal, and accordingly, most
ot the papers of the French capital ap
pear in the afternoon. His most inti
mate friends would mistrust their senses
if they met a London editor in a ball
room after midnight while in Paris it is
the chief part of an editor's business to
show himself every where in a ceitain
society—to attend the receptions of the
ministers or opposition leaders, as the
case may be, and to drop in, besides at
the unofficial reunions where his politi
cal friends are in the habit of rallying.

NmjBER 15.
He has probably a liking for society fo
ill own sake, and it is at once his pleas
ure and his duty to teel the pulse ot soci
ety for himself, in place of trusting, like
his English confrere, to the second-hand
reports of intimates who are mixing in
the world at any rate. Then he never
need have the sense of working at high
pressure. Far more often than not, he
writes on the domestic subjects which
are always on his mind and when he
has occasion to treat some sudden ques
tion of foreign policy, he does so deliber
ately, after ripe consideration. The mi
nor contents of his meagre sheet demand
comparatively little supervision, and that
little may be confided to intelligent su
bordinates. With the exception* of the
Tempt, there are few Parisian papers that
take any great trouble about their for
eign correspondents and tho sum total
of the mechanical labor must, of course,'
be proportionately small.
A NOVEMBER NOCTURN
The Autumn air sweeps faint and chill
Across the maple-cn sted hill,
And on my ear
Palls, tingling clear, _.
A'strange mysterious woodland thrill
From outmost twig, from searlet crown,
Untouched with yet a tint of brown,
Reluctant slow,
As slothtogo,
The loosened leaves come wavering down.
And not a hectic trembler there,
In Its decadence, doomed to share
The fate of all,
But in Its fall,
F' ngs something sob-ltke on the air
No drift or dream ef passing bell,
Dying afar in dusky doll,
Hath any heard
Whose chimes have stlried
A teader pathos of farewell
A silent shiver as of pain.
Goes quivering thro'each sapless vein.
And there are moans
Whose undertones
Are sad as autumn midnight rain
Ah, if without a dirge-like sigh
No lightest-clinging leaf can die
Let him who saith
Decay anddeath
Should bring no heart-break, tell me why
Each graveyard gives the answer There
I read resurgam eveiywhere,
So easy said
Above the dead—
So weak to anodyne despah
BEYOND KLCALL.
"I think you said you were going to
drive into Granthan, Miss Morley? May
I ask you to take the trouble to post this
letter for me! I believe it will save a
day."
"Certainly, I will do so with pleasure
but what are you going to do with your
valuable time this morning Mr Borra
daile?"
"I believe I am to help Eastwick 1o
buy a horse."
"A most absorbing occupation I
wi3h YOU cveiy access."
Miss Morley laughed, but she was dis
appointed that Mr. Borradaile bad not
offered to be her companion, and thought
the new horse quite unimportant.
4
The early post seems popular to
day," she eut on "there are several oth
er letters waiting for me on the hall ta
ble."
"I will give them to you all together,"
said Mr. Borradaile, seeing that she was
buttoning her gloves. And he followed
her through the hall and helped her into
the pony-carnage.
The ponies were in a hurrv to start
and when he handed her the* packet of
letters, she tl.rutt them hastily into an
inner pocket of her seal-skin jacket, and
drove off without looking at them.
Catherine Morley and George Borra
daile met for the first time a fortnight
before at the Eastwick's pleasant house
at Lincolnshire. Catherine coming fiom
a house where every opinion was cut and
dried, where every deviation from routine
was a crime, had been first tnghtened
and then fascinated by the width ind
freedom of opinions expressed by Mr.
Borradaile. There were no other young
people in the house, and they were nat
urally thrown much together, not with
out design on Mrs. Eastwick's part for
Catherine had a good fortune and an un
congenial home, while George Borradaile
was poor and had no home at all, and
none of his friends knew that his heart
was set on pretty penniless Lady Mary
Eldon, who was deveted to him in re
turn, and on bis account was just about
to bo taken abroad, in the hope that some
more eligible suitor might drive out her
infatuated attachment to the poor and
idle barrister.
On the morning that Catherine Morley
drove into Grantham, Mr. Borradaile had
received a passionate appeal for help from
Lady Mary. Two days hence she was to
be dragged to Italy by her parents, and
with them was to go Mr. Arthur Stubbs,
a so-called millionaire, whom she detest
ed, but whom she would be compelled to
marry if Georgo did not come to the res
cue. He was just to write and tell her
what to do, tell her how to escape at
once, or promise to follow her to Italy,
and she would implicitly follow his di
rections and George did write, arranged
a meeting, hinted at plans for the future
—such a nappy future!—and gave the
letter to Catherine to post.
"A bright, pleasant, sensible girl," he
thought her, not at all the sort of person
to pry into other people's affairs and if
she did notice the address, it was unlike
ly she would know anything of Lady
Mary, or think anything of his writing
to her if she did.
Miss Morley being a little vexed, drove
the ponies quickly into Grantham, and
came back with equal speed and it was
fortunate that she did so, for Mrs. East
wick was waiting with impatience for
her return.
"We have got to lose you, Catherine,
dear,' as her guest drove up to the door.
'Don't take the ponies out, Willis they
'will be wanted again. There is a tele
hgram, Catherine, from London, about
your uncle. They want you to go at
once."
"Is he ill?"
"Worse"'
"Dead?"
"Yes quite suddenly."
Catherine gave a gasp of natural hor
ror and astonishment—grief it was im
possible to feel for the domestic tyrant
whe had narrowed her life—and then
she looked at the matter sensibly.
"Of course I must go at once Aunt
Susan will be overwhelmed. Thank you,
dear Mrs. Eastwick if I might leave my
things here, and just take what I shall
want, it will be a great help."
"Do anything you like, dear but, first
of all, come and have some luncheon
there is plenty of time before the train
starts."
The day had changed and become
warm and fine, and Catherine was glad
of a few minutes in which to throw aside
her heavy winter clothing, to be claimed
at some future time, and hurrying
through her preparations, came down
again.
"Bay good-bye for me to Mr. Eastwick

—and Mr. Borradaile," she said turning
bock on the doorstep.
"Yes. They will be so sorry to miss
you!"
And Catherine drove away.
It was late in November, and East
wick House was full of guests. There
were hunting men and their wives,
and sportsmen, keen after pheasants,
there were one or two pretty girls, and,
last of all, there were Catherine Morley
and George Borradaile.
Catherine had been compelled'from re
spect to her aunt's wishes to spend the
six months following her uncle's death in
strict—and, to her mind, unnecessary re
tirement, and the first visit she had been
allowed to pay without querulous pro
test was to the Eastwicks'. Buried
through tbe whole summer in a dull,
country house, surrounded by a dismal
little park and neglected gardens, with no
society and few resources, Catherine had
filled up her time by indulging in a day
dream. It was not to be supposed that
a hem would be wanting to the illusion,
and, knowing nothing ot his circumstanc
es, this hero sprang into life ready-made
in the person of George Borradaile and,
as "liking msy grow in meditation," the
time came when, to Catherine's mind, he
possessed every quality she prized most
and when, alter many months, they met
at Eastwick, she unconsciously greeted
him with a warmth which took him by
surprise.
"How ill and old and altered he looks!"
thought Catherine to herself, as she dress
ed for dinner on the evening of her arriv
al. "I wonder what he has been doing
all these months when I have never even
heard his name. I womlei if he will be
friendly, as he was in May or whether
our acquaintance must begin all over
again."
Thus mused Catherine, not knowing
that her unconscious cordiality had awak
ened in Mr. Borradaile sudden interest
in her. He remembered all in a moment
hat before he had liked her, he remem
bered that the Eastwicks had spoken of
her with affection, he saw that sh» had
a pleasant face and a winning manner,
and he gave her more th jughts than he
had given any woman before—but
one.
Perhaps Mrs. Eastwick manoeuvred a
little, or perhaps the two uaturally drew
together, anyhow, as days went on, they
became inseperable. Idle George Borra
daile contrived to spend all his time at
Eastwick, Catherine quite deserted her
aunt, and no one was surprised when
called upon for congratulations on what
every one considered a most desirable en
gagement.
"Some time, Catherine, I muBt tell you
the story of my former love, which seemB
to me now as it must have been years
ago," said George, one day
"Some time, perhaps, I may wish to
hear it but not just now," answered
Catherine, jealous for her new happiness,
and the subject rested.
The wedding was to take place in May,
and, by Mrs Eastwick's desire, was
to be from her house, where Catnenne
stayed for some weeks beforehand, and
George was a welcome guest.
One warm May morning the lovers
strolled together in the garden. Cather
ine was happy, and George's mind was
full ot memories.
"Catherine," he said, presently, "this
morning I must tell you that love-story
of mine, of which you would never let
me speak. I want you to know it, and
it cannot hurt you now.'*
"No it cannot hurt me. Tell me,"
said Catherine with her hand on his arm
"Do you remember that morning, a
year ago, when you took a letter of mine
to post at Giantham? That letter was to
have altered my life. It was to ask the
only woman I ever loved—but you—to
run away from her father and mothei
and become my wife. There was urgent
need of haste, for they were taking her
abroad, and with them was going the man
they wanted her to mairy. She had writ
ten, beseeching me to help her and
planned it all, and wrote and told her. I
planned the hour and place of meeting, I
asked for a word in reply, and it never
came I went to the meeting-p'ace, and
she was not there—she was gone and from
that day to this I have never heard from
her. In September she married the man
her parents wished. My poor little Mary'
I often wonder what her life is now.
Catherine, what is the matter?" for he
felt her grasp tighten painfully on his
arm, and turning, he saw a white face
and trembling lips.
"Mary, did you say? Not Lady Mary
Eldon?'
"Yes, dear what ot it?
"George, will you forgive me! I did
not guess—I never knew it was only
when I came back here in November
that I found I had left a letter in my
pocket that day, I found it there. I
had never seen your writing then—I did
not know it was yours. I thought it was
too late to do any good by speaking of
it, and I burnt itjust as it was. It was
directed to Lady Mary Eldon."
Catherine's agonized eyes watched ev
ery lock which passed over his face—an
ger, sorrow, pity, but there was not even
a glance at her.
"George!" she cried at last, unable
any longer to bear his silence.
Then he turned and gravely kissed her.
"The passt is dead and buried, Cath
erine, and my sorrow lies with it. Dear,
do you remember that to-morrow is to be
our wedding-day?"
