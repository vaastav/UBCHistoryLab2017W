The Victory at Knoxville.
The news from East Tennessee is of the most
invigorating character, and infinitely more inj
porta nt than would have been a victory almost
anywhere else. Long.itrect'a forces made a si
multaneous attack on Burnside's Works on the
39th ult, and were repulsed at all points with
great loss estimated as high aa 300 killed and
700 wounded, while the Union loss waa but 29
In killed and wounded. Longstrcet then raised
the seige, and is in full retreat, hotly pursued
by our cavalry. Thus, East Tennessee is ours,
we trust forever. Our possession of it makes
the military subjugation of all that section of
country only a question of time. For this vie
tory, we are indebted in the main to Oen. Burs
aide, who alone planned tha defence of Knox-
illo.

The following extract from the Philadelphia

PROFITABLE INVESTMENTS.
"Though money temporarily scarce, capital
continue abundant: and the reoent tumble in tbe lock
market has brought capitalists to a realizing sense of the
rinreliable character of many of the securities dealt in.
Jt la greatly to ttie cretm oi me uoveroment that ila

most anything else. Its Five-Twenty year aiz percent,

been subscribed to, al) through the pleasure in the mou
sy market, at an average of more than two mtilionaper

lar loan, acarcely any of it ia returned to the market for
sale. It ia taken for investment, sod il held with unfal
tering confidence in lta reliability. And why should it
notber It is seen that the (Jovernment now, after two
years of the most gigantic war that the world has ever
known, experiences no dilhVulty in commanding the nec
essary muana to prosecute it, or in paying regularly the

facts which they present will prove of the most satisfac
tory mode of dispelling the numberleas gloomy annrehen.
aiona which are being continually conjured up by those
who are disposed to exagerate the extent of the calamity
occasioned by our rebellion. A reference to the state of
mostof the prosperous nationa of the old world clearly
disproves luch a position, and shows that the klgheat
eonumons oi naiiot si advancement nave not oeen mate
rially taunted by tit extended wars in which those na
tions have been Immemorially engaged, and that a heavy
national indebtedness haa not proved an unmitigated
evil. .
"for Instance, Great Britain, France and the Nether
lands will undoubtedly be conceded to represent the high
est prosperity that has bt.en attained by any of the Eu
ropean nation. And yet no nationa have been called up
on to endure Sereer or more prolonged wars.domestle and
foreign, than they. The etlect has been, unquestionably,
to incuran enormous national Indebtedness; but neither
their wars nor their Indebtedness have had the effect to
destroy their elasticity, nor to check the progress of their
general prosperity, rne result would have been dilfer
ent, probibly, il these nations had been falling into de
cay, instead of being, aa they really were, in a state of
development; ana mints respect inelr care resembles our
own with enormous advantages in our favor. These na
tions, while undergoing the trials of war, were oppressed
by the evils of an Immense exodus ef i heir people, caused
by the density of their populanion, the Impossibility to
rrovide occupation for them, the low price of labor, and
the scarcity of territory. Compaied with our own coun
try, they possessed slight room forfuture developement;
they were nettled in every part, and no vast territory lay
Invitingly open to encourage enterprise sad settlement.
Their great problem baa ever been what to do with their
nrplos population, whioh, la its turn, haa sought new
fields for adventure and self-support in countries like our
own, where an illimitable territory waits to be developed,
and where localculable resources Invite Industry sad en
ergy. The encouragement to be derived from these facts
and comparisons of circumstances is very great, and to
the mind of any dispassionate reaaoner is conclusive that
the course of this great country la onward and upward,
sad that ita credit will live unimpaired to the sod."

of the century, and during whose existence the
Rebellion which has passed itsculniination, will
beyond all question century, to our army aud

Not only will your constituents watch with
strictest scrutiny your deliberations here; but
the friends of liberty, in the most distant lands,
will be interested spectators of your acts iu this
greater than Roman forum. I invoke you to ap
proach these grave questiona with the culm
thoughtfulnessof statesmen, freeing your dis
cussions from that acerbity which mars instead
of advancing legislation, aud with unshaken re
liance on that divine power which gave victory
to those who formed this Union, and can give
even greater victory to those who are seeking to
save it from destruction, from the hand of the
parricide and traitor. I invoke you also to re
member that sacred truth which all history ver
ities, that "they who rule not in righteousness
shall perish from the earth." Thanking you
with a grateful heart for this distinguished mark
of your confidence and regard, and appealing to
you all for that support and forbearance by the
aid of which I alone can hope to succeed, I am
now ready to take the oath of office and enter

yitnl forcea In their
orous action, and
leaves the ivstem to
fall Into disorder and
docay. Tli scrofulous contamination I a
rioutljr caused hy mercurial disease, low
living, disordered digestion from unhealthy
food, impure air, filth and filthy habits,
the depressing vices, and, above all, by
tho venereal infection. Whatever be it
origin, It 1 hereditary In the constitution,
descending "from parent to children onto
the third and fourth generation ; " indeed, it
teem to be the rod of Him who says, " I will
visit the iniquities of the father upon their
children." The disease it originates tuke
various names, according to the organs it
attack. In the lungs, Scrofula produce
tubercles, and finally Consumption j in the
glands, swellings which suppurate and be
come ulcerous sores ; in the stomach and
bowels, derangements which produce indi
gestion, dyspepsia, and liver complaints ; on
the akin, eruptive and cutaneo" effect ion t.
These, all having the same origin, require the
same remedy, viz., purification and invigora
tion of the blood. Purify the blood, and
these dangerous distemper leave you. With
feeble, foul, or corrupted blood, you cannot
have health; with that "life of the flesh"
healthy, you cannot have scrofulous disease.
Ayer'a Sarsaparilla
is compounded from the most effectual anti
dote that medical acience ha discovered for
thi afflicting distemper, and for the cure of
the disorder it entail. That it is far supe
rior to any other remedy yet devised, ia
known by all who have given it a trial. That
It doc combine virtue truly extraordinary
in their effect upon this class of complaints,
i indisputably proven by the great multitude
of publicly known and remarkable cure it
ha made of the following disease t King's
Evil, or Glandular Swellings, Tumors,
Eruptions, Pimples, Blotches and Sores,
Erysipelas, Rose or St Anthony's Fire,
Salt Bheum, Scald Head, Coughs from
tuberculous deposits in the lungs, White
Swellings, Debility, Dropsy, Neuralgia,
Dyspepsia or Indigestion, Syphilis and
Syphilitic Infections, Mercurial Diseases,
Female Weaknesses, and, indeed, the whole
erie of complaint that arise from impurity
of the blood. Minute reports of individual
cases may be found in Ater's America
Almanac, which is furnished to tho druggist
for gratuitous distribution, wherein may be
learned tho direction for its use, and tome
of the remarkable cure which it has mado
when all other remedies had failed to afford
relief. Those case are purposely taken
from all sections of the country, in order
that every reader may have access to soma
one who can speak to him of its benefits from
personal experience. Scrofula depresses ths
vital energies, and thus leaves its victim far
more subject to disease and its fatal result
than are healthy constitution. Hence it
tends to shorten, and doe greatly shorten,
the average duration of human life. The
vast importance of these considerations ho
led us to spend years in perfecting a remedy
which is adequate to it cure. Thi we now
offer to the public under the name of Ayeb's
Sarsaparilla, although it is composed of
ingredients, some of which exceed the best
of Sarsaparilla in alterative power. By its
aid you may protect yourself from the suffer
ing and danger of these disorder. Purge
out the foul corruptions that rot and fester
in tho blood, purge out the causes of disease,
and vigorous health will follow. By its pecu
liar virtues this remedy stimulates the vital
functions, and thus expels the distempers
which lurk within the system or burst out
on any part of it.
We know the public have been deceived
by many compounds of. Sarsaparilla, that
promised much and did nothing; but they
will neither bo deceived nor disappointed in
this. Its virtues have been proven by abun
dant trial, and there remains no question of
its surpassing excellence for the cure of tho
afflicting diseases it is intended to reach.
Although under the same name, it is a very
different medicine from any other which has
been before the people, and is far more ef
fectual than any other which has ever been
available to them.
