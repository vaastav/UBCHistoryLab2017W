Thx opssiae or thi dkbats. yesterday, la the
Senate, justified the fears of conservative persons
? her* and elsewhere, that men well kaown tbe
country over a* extremists would at once rash forward
to five their tone of the dlsenssion. It need
hardly be remarked that if such statesmen as Senator
Hale, who discourses of tbe readinesa of tbe
North to attempt force against the South, on one
, side, and Senator Wlgfail. who avowedly regards
the Union as an accursed thing that should be destroyed
under any circumstances whatever, on the
other side, are to conduct the deliberations of the
. *
body designed to consummate measures to relieve
American Dnblie affaire of the difficulties bv
? *
which they are inrronnded, the result must be as
ur.succ?aaf il as ever brfei*.
The trouble has really grown oat of the pertinacity
with which members living, as public
men, upon tbe excitability of the country's
nerves, North and South, have used their position!
la Congress as the means of perpetuating
their own connection with public life by infla
mine the sectional nrrladlces each of his own
constituents Had the debates of Congress upon
sis very for tbe last ten yesrs been conducted with
I closed doors, or even bad tbe C?ngrtatonal Utob*
not existed In that time to spread tbe poison of
I tbelr debates broadcast throughout tbe landst tbe
cost rf the National Treasury, the North would
not at thle mo meat be aggressive upon tbe slavery
question to tbe point of driving the conservative
portion of the South out of the Confederacy ; ner
would the extreme South now entertsin the
strange hallucination that the Ualoa at best Is bnt

What txk Mbectkt" Pabtt Wut ?Tbe
following brief avowal of tbe Charleston Merturjr.
la reply to the latest suggestions of tbe
propriety of entire Southern action in tbe current
crisis, tells the tale of the apparent purposes of
those who want disunion for disunion's sake,
wore imuuij ifl&n it cm oe oiuerwise w>i<i:
"We think mmt earrespowdent f*r * above

Eastern Virginia. He will per don n?, bowrvfr,

other Stnte. We are now acting For oovselves,
and by ourselves, upon our own aoverelgnty. Oar
correspondent will also pardon ua if we doubt tbe
ability, at this time, of any border State to give
us good counsel, or to aM.st in foric<wdt%% our
action We hnve need for ne other counsel or
assistance, sad will accept of none other."
Who fell* to aee In it not only the pnrpoee of
refusing to permit tbe border |laveholding Slates
to be t>eard in Southern councils, but also the
additional of rejecting any eventual
nnlon with them by which they may not be held

DitAProiMTKB ? It is already clear that sot only
the extreme men of the Republican party la Congrtss,
bat those recogmud as being the nearest
counsellors of the President elect, are bitterly disappointed
by tbe failure of the message to intimate
tbat the present Administration designs
initiating forcible measures u> prevent secession
on the part of tbe Southern States. At strange as
It may appear, they came here belfcvlng nod
hoping that President Buchanan would essay co
j erclon, and that by ?mcb action on hii part tbe
trouble could and would be eettled brfore tbe 4th
of March next, leaving tbe path of tbe Incoming
administration cImt ef the embirrsasq>ent of the
di Acuity Few of tbew aa yethavf come tocomprebeud
that to attempt coercion, will surely be
to precipitate the whole Soatb into revelation
within thirty day* after the attemot h?

Sbhatk.?At the conclusion of the ?pccch of
Mr Bale, who waa addressing the Senate a* we
went to press yesterday?
Mr. Brown, of Miss . aald If be was to have
peace, he wanted to know It; and If war, be
wished to know that also He asked If tbe republican
party not only denied tb? South peace
i* the I nlon, but intended to refhM them tbat
poor boon o?t of It.
Mr. Hale said bis remarks were merely his own
private opinions; be did not speak for a party mad
bad held no communication, by letter er per- |

Mr Irerson, of Ga , after referring to the positions
of Mr. Hale. stated that fire States at least
woakt certainly secede, and a Confederacy, aa he
hoped and believed, be formed The North and
the South w*r* 4isll?ct peoples even now. la
this chamber there was no reciprocity of the usual
courtesies b?twe?h tu- two sides of the Senate,
and this was a type of the arctlons represented by
these sides. The North bates the Soptb, and no
lore Is lost from the South toward the North.

not, and ought not to, lire under one government,
lie did not wtab for war, but If it must corns, let
It enme. Tbe South will say to her enemies,
''We'll welcome yon with bloody hands to hospitable
craves "
Mr.Wtiftdl, of Texas, discussed at some length
tbe right of secession, quoting from tbe message
the portions be objected to, and reading from Elliott's
Debates. He maintained that a State bad
the undoubted right to secede; and aaid if South
Carolina should withdraw, and the Government
should keep Federal troops within her borders,
an attempt would be made to take the forts, and
blood would flow.
Mr Lane, of Oregon, did not understand the
President as saying be would collect the dutlea If
South Carolina seceded.
Mr. Wlgffcll said the mora he read the message
the leas he comprehended it [Laughter] For
himself, if war must come, he would say, 44 To

Mr Saniaburr, of Delaware, said his State was
the first to adopt the Constitution, and would be
tbe last to do anything looking to its deatruction.
[Applause and hisses ] It would be time enough
wheu this Union was dissolved for Delaware to
say wbat aba would do. [Applause and increaaed
