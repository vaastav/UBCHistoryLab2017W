It must be conceded that none of the

says President Cleveland The speaking
must be done very strictly surely to con

Mr Cleveland has fastened the re

THE MESSAGE
The Presidents message delivered yes
terday deals with the question of the
tariff and the revenue exclusively Noth
ing more clearly indicates the urgent
need of a reform that will prevent the
hoarding of money in the national treas
ury by methods that indicate the duality
of the tariff evil the many are forced to
contribute to the profit of the few and the
national treasury drains the country of
its circulating medium
Mr Cleveland wastes no time or words
in laying before Congress the needs of the
public but tells the representatives of the
people in the few words that he utters
that the condition of the national Treas
ury imperatively demands immediate and
careful consideration Mr Cleveland
insists upon the Democratic idea that
revenues in excess of an economical
maintenance of the government is inde
fensible extortion and a betrayal of the
popular riguts This making of the na
tional treasury a hoardingbox for
moneys collected through a robber tariff
cripples our energies suspends develop
ment prevents investments threatens
financial disturbance and invites schemes
of public plunder
The remedy proposed by the President
is plainly expressed and must prove the
THisWEELKY GAZETTE EOUT WOETH TEXAS EKIDAY DECEMBER 9
shibboleth of his party Tnat rtmtdy is
to diminish the tax on necessaries rather
than on luxuries Mr Cleveland is no
violent free trader but he says
the present tariff laws the vicious in
iquitous and illogicsl source of unneces
sary taxation ought to beat once revised
and amended
The people demand the relief the Pres
ident has recommended it as of para

THE DROUTH IN TEXAS
The CourierJournal has received from Big
Valley Mill county Texas a comma icat on
setting forth the destitution prevailing there by
reason of the drouth which has prevailed for
many months and asking that subscriptions be
forwarded
When The Gazette saw the above in
the Louisville CjutierJournal letters
were at once written to responsible par
ties at Corn Hill asking for the facts
The Gazette wrote these letters of in
quiry for the reason that the drouth Is
so long a thing of the past in Texas that
the state toaay is literally soaking in
water streams are bank full in the west
and for ten years the grain
growing section of the state has
not had such prospect for a bountiful
yield as at the present time Texas has
forgotten the drouth and citizens of
Texas are in sorry business who write
begging letters to outside newspapers of
extended circulation for aid to a suffer

this state has been apprised The follow

SECRE TARYENDIGOTTS REPOR T
The report transmitted to Congress by
Secretary Endicott shows that our coun
try is but poorly provided with defenses
in case of a foreign invasion There are
no large guns of consequence and men
of war with long range guns could bom
bard our coast cities without opposition
from the land The Secretary urges that
fortifications more or less elaborate be
inaugurated and that guns and other
munitions of war be purchased He
wants the army increased to at least 50
000 men and that officers attending
courts martial be allowed extra expenses
for such service He makes some recom
mendations of minor importance but the
report throughout betrays in bold lines
that omnipresent characteristic of the
American officeholder It is peculiarly
an American trait this longing for more
power more importance and a continued
increase and progress in anything
under control The schoolman be
lieves that schools and colleges
are the greatest institutions in
the world and if he had his way unre
stricted the country would be one vast
school room the heads of the various
departments in state or national govern
ments seem to think that their particular
departments are a little more important
than those of enybody else and that if
the government would only make a more
liberal appropriation how much wiser it
would be acting Scarcely a report is
made by any officer that does not men
tion the inadequacy of appropriations
and complain at the Injurious parsimony
of the state Money in abundance is
wanted all around No one will be sur
prised that Secretary Endicott should
follow the long line of precedents in this
respect He mingles with military men
and imbibes their ideas unconsciously
In the eyes of the soldier the civilian is a
being of no consequence save a wealth
producer and that wealth should be de
voted to supporting a noble soldiery The
more money appropriated and the larger
the army becomes the greater will the
soldier seem and the more opportunities
will be offered for his advancement The
annual spawns of military schools must
be provided for and to do this requires
the increase in the army and the building
of fortifications It is not likely that the
recommendations of the Secretary will be
followed out to any considerable extent
We are not well protected it is true but
we require no protection There is no
country on earth that would attack us
and the money spent In building fortifica
tions and manning them would be a loss
to the country quite unnecessary There
are many objections to be urged against
spending fabulous sums of money in
building fortifications The strides of
science in recent years have been such
that what would have been a defense ten
years ago would be no defense at all now
and we may well believe that what would
be called defenses now will be antiquated
ten years hence These nations that are
spending their substance in forts and war
ships may live to see such im
plements of war neutralized or
rendered valueless by some cheap and
simple contrivance of the scientist
Nor is there any necessitv for an increase
in the regular army The militia In each
state can take care of the peace of the
commonwealth and it Is better to
tae defenses In their hands A sta Hng
army is contrary to the spirit Of ogin
stitutions and the longer we ctomdo
without one the better The r ortlrof

Twentyfive years ago Mr Lamar was a

day his political disabilities having been
removed by act of Congress meantime
he is at the head of a department of the
government which has rfs ored to the
public domain over 21000000 acres of

American politics that even among the

To tho Editor of tho Gazette
In Ttxas we seldom if ever do any
thing until necessity compels us How
ever when we do wake up and become
interested in any enterprise we never do
anything by halves and we always suc
ceed in anythingwe undertake We have
jast at this time decided that we need
more people and capital in our state and
when we get a move on excuse the
slang we will surprise those people in
some of the adjoining and distant states
and those of our peope who are now pre
paring to pack up and leave Texas for
Clifornifl would do well to stop a little
and look a little out as the good ntured
and jolly German would say The would
be California boom hunter will enjoy
a sure enough boom arid one that has a
solid foundation to it if he will ja3t wait
a few days The prospects for a pros
perous season in Texis were nevf r better
than they are now With what rain has
already fallen there is a fine season in the
ground and with the same amount of
rainfall that we had last season which we
are sure to have if not more a good crop
is a certainty This with the rush of
new people and capital that our railroads
are going to bring us in the near future
will place Texas in the front rank and
no mistake and those that
leave the state now I am
afraid will sincerely regret it This thing
of hunting booms is not what it is
always represented to be The best
country is always a few mies furter
on and if you will be patient and wait a
littl while the boom will find you and
especially will this be the case if you re
main in TtxiS Why my dear sir
would you believe it toere Is many a
poor man and his family that is now in
California that would only be too glad to
gat back to good old Texas but you see
ne spent most of his little capi
tal in going there and living there is
high yes very high and now that he
wants to return he finds that it lakes
nearly if not quite double the money to
get back that it did to go and then he is
a sad but wiser man He naturally finds
that he and his family cant live on air
and pleasant climate it requires some
thing more substantial to keep the wolf
from the door The lands are out of
his reach He might get a little land if
he had the money to buy but then he
would have to buy the water to Irrigate
and he knows nothing of farming in that
way so you see be is completely at sea
without a rudder so to speak Oh
yes my dear fellow California
is all very nice to read about and may do
pretty well for gentlemen of leisure and
those who have plenty of cash but for the
man wno has a home and money to get
it is the last place on earth to go to
Texas is witnout doubt the best state in
our blessed Union for the man with lim
ited or moderate mjans If a man dont
secure for himself and family a comfort
able home in Texas he is no rustler
and could not get a home in any state orr
country It certainly is a mans own
fault if he is not a land owner or have a
place that he can call home in Texas
1 have jnst come from California
and think I know what I m talking
about and aa you well know I have been
in Texas some years and know some little
of it and while we have had our ups and
downs and all that we must bear in mind
that the state and country is yet to be
found with good crops every year and
Texas will average with most states now
in tne way of crops and when we farm as
we shouidand as one would be compelled
to in most states we will surprise the
world with our products and variety cl
crops You can go to California if you
want to old pirri but
hs for me Texas is good enough and I
will slick to the old ship yen a wnile
When I came here I had no home and I
know of any number of our old friends
who were In the same fix but now and
we have not been here but a few years
the most of us those who have made anv
effort have a good home and if we stay
with it we are all right You bet old
boy it would be a ci Id day m Jul when
we would be able to get a home in old
Kentucky our old home Where land is
so high It is clear out of the reach of the
poor man to say nothing of Call
fornla where they sell it by
the inch and water the same way
Weil Jim so long if you go I
wish you success but take my advice and
consider well before you jump so far
Thanks Tom old friend Ill go home
nd talk the matter over with the old
lady and the children and we may recon
sider and try Texas for another year If
the railroads would bring us in some
neighbors so we could get a school in the
settlement and Sallie could send the
little ones God bless them to school
she would feel more content and
satisfied We naturally tnought when
we moved out there that others
would soon follow and we have been pa
tiently waiting but no neighbors have
come and we had about made up our
minds to either go back to old Kentucky
or go to California Glad I chanced to
meet you here Tom Same to you Jim
good day and good luck be with you and
we may yet often meet in Port Worth
hope so at least
The above conversation was overheard
by Gazettk rustler at the corner of
Fourth and Main streets yesterday and
as the California craze seems to have
caught some of our people we give our
readers the benefit of the observation and
esDerience of one who has been there

THE SENATE
Washington Dec 5 The Senate
chamber wore a f esh and tasteful ap
pearance this morning The floors and
galleries were newly carpeted and the
desks glistened in their coat of varnish
the odor of which mingled faintly with
that of the bouquets and gorgeous
floral devices which enlivened the
picture The Senators began to arrive
and take their seats before 11 oclock
Senators Stewart and HIscock being the
first comers For an hour before noon
the floor was a busy scene the members
of both parties their friends and the offi
cers of the Senate taking this occasion to
exchange greetings and compare notes
Tne chief topic of conversation with the
majority was the prospect of the conflict
over the admission of certain Democratic
Senators elect and it early became known
thai the Republicans In default of any
caucus plan of action had concluded
to follow the lead of their members of
the committee on privileges and elections
There have been informal consultations
It was understood that the Republicans
had reacaed the conclusion to make no
opposition to the admission of Mr Turpie
of Indiana bat to or ject to the admission
of Mr Faulkn r of West Virginia on the
ground that there were conflicting
credentials from that state The general
opinion was that there would be no dead
lock and that the usual course of the
opening would not be broken
The galleries were early crowded to
overflowing Mrs Cleveland clad in a
costume of dark green and accompanied
by Mrs Gilder Mrs Kingtford and sev
eral other lady friends occupied seats
reserved for the family of the President
in one of the private galleries The
diplomatic gallery was filled by the mem
bers of the various legations the front
seat being occupied by the CMnese
Minister his secretaries and associates
The Mitister wore a magnificent robe of
light blue satin and his companions
were clad as ricnly though in more sub
dued colors The Droceedings of the day
were opened witn prayer by the chaplain
Rev J G Butler He asked that the
senators might be endowed with wlsdow
and strength to meet the honorable and
trying responsibilities of the day and all
duties that gathered around them The
President of the Senate Mr Inealle then
took the chair and called the Senate to
order He said he would now place be
fore the Senate the certificates of elec
tion certificates of appointment and
other papers received since adjournment
The following papers were thereupon
submitted and read Certificate cf the

in special session elected C JFaulKner as
Senator to fill a vacancy the
credentials of Willian Cnandler
as Uuited State Senator from
New Hampshire protest of Dan C Lucas
againstthe administration of the oath of
office to C J Faulkner The grounds of
the protest are
1 That the executive o the state of West
Vireioia has not certified the election of
C J Faulkner under seal of the state as
required by act f Congress
2 For reasons set out in the brief of
Dan C Lucas a copy of which accom
panied tbe protest
3 B cause C J Faulkner was at the
time and date of dls alleged election May

district hi West Virginia and therefore
ineligible to the office of senator
The protest was laid on the table and
ordered to be printed in the record Toe

office to tne newly elected Senators was
then proceeded ith such Senators being
cailed in parties of four and in alphabeti
cal order The first f ur S naors thus
called and sworn in all instances with
uplifted hands and not on the 3ible were
Aldrich Bate Biodgett and Chandler
The second four were Cockrell Daniel
Davis and Dawes The third four were
Edmunds Faulkner George and Gorman
Mr Hnr obj ct d for the time being
to administering the oath of office to Mr
Faulkner He understood that whatever
question arose about the title of that
Senator to the seat arose on the creden
tials themselves the whole proceeding ot
the Lfgislature and the history of the
case being thus disclosed and fully recited
Assuming that in accordance wilh the
usages of the Senate he would himself
be a member of the committee on priv
ileges and elections he gave assurance
that the question should be dealt with as
early as possible so that the gentleman
entitled to the seat would be able
to enter on the discharge of his
duties as Senator The oath was admin
istered to the other three Senators and
subsequently to Senators Gray Hale
Hawley Hearst Reagan Sawyer Sher
man Stewart Stockbridge and Turpie
At the suggestion of Senator Vest the
privileges of he floor were given to Mr

of a committee of two Senators to join a
like committee of the House and inform

your indulgence but I trust you win
never have cause to complain that it has
been abused There has scarcely ever

LEGISLATION IN CONGRESS
as now lor tne season that the dangers
wnich threaten the commercial and in
dustrial interest of the people are
the direct results of laws which Congress
alone can modify or repeal Neither the
executive department of the general gov
ernment nor the local authorities of the
several slates can deal effectively with
the situation which now confronts us
Whatever is done must be done here and
if nothing is done the responsibility must
rest here It must be evident to every
one who has taken even a partial survey
of public affairs that the time has now
come when the revision of our revenue
laws and reduction of taxation are nec
essary in order to prevent the large and
dangerous accumulation of money in the
treasury Wnether this ongat or ought
not to have been done heretofore is a
question which it would be useless now
to discuss It is sufficient for us to know
that the financial condition of the govern
ment and the private business of the peo
ple alike
DEMAND PROMPT CONSIDERATION
of these subjects jund the speedy enact
ment of some suostantial measures for
relief Unfortunately we ore menaced by
dangers from opposite directions While
a policy of nonaction must inevitably
result sooner or later in serious it jury to
the country we cannot be unmlnaful of
the fsct that hasty and inconsiderate
legislation on subjects more or less affect
ing large Unanclal and industrial interests
might produce temporarily at least dis
turbance and embarrassment which a
more prudent course would avoid Iq
ve tments made and labor employed in
numerous and valuable industries which
have grown up under our present system
ol taxation ought not to be rudely dis
turbed by sudden and radical changes in
tae policy to which they have acjusttd
tiemselves bu the jut demands of our
overtaxed people and tne obvious require
ments of tne flaarclal situation
CANNOT BE ENTIRELY IGNORED
without seriously imperilling much
greater and more widely txtended in
terests thsn an > that could possibly be
iojnnously affected by a moderate and
recsonable reduction of duties No part
of cur pec pie are more immediately or
vitally interested in the continuance of
our financial prosperiy than those who
labor for wages Up n them and their
families must always fall the most citia3
rous consequence of the momentary
crisis and they too are always tne last
to realize the b < jntflt of the return to
prosperous times Then wages are al
ways tne first to fall when a crisis comes
and the last to rise when it passes awy
Our tffirt should be to afford the
necessary relief to all without injury to
the interest of any aud therefore a
courso of legislation shouid oe pqrsued
which will guarantee the laboring people
sgiinst the parlj zing eft cts of a general
ana prolonged financial dtpres ion and
at the came time not interfere with their
employment or deprive them of any part
of the just rewards of their tolls
If this csn be done and I believe it can if
our deliberations are conducted with wis
com this Congress will have cause to
congratulate itself on an achievement
which promises peace and prosperity to
the country for mapy years to come
These remarks may be ccntidered some
what out of the usual course and perhaps
not entirely pertinent to the occasion
bat I believe you will excuse them gentle
men btciuse they relate to subjects
which as we assemble here to day ae up
permost in the minds of all the people
On the correct solution of the questions
waich these subjects necessarily involve
miy depend the fate not only of the po
litical parties but what is far
more Important the permanent
welfare of the greatest and
most enlightened constituencies in tbe
world Again I thank you gentlemen
for the conspicuous and honorable plac
to waich you have assigned me and with
out attempting to detain you further we
will proceed to the organization of the
House
