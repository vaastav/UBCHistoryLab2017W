Mr Tait indicated yesterday that he
has decided on the club ss tbe best
means /or dealing with Congress?in
carrying oot the policy of Mr. Roose?
velt. He announced that Le believed
and expected tbat the special session
that he will call as soon as be is inaugu?
rated will revise tbe 'ariff witb a reviiioo
that will be actual aad effective; he ex?
pected the House to frame and pass the
bill, as is iU constitutional prerogative,
nnd be expected it to reach the White
House without beiog mangled un the
maj. When the suggestion wits made
tbat the Senate would undoubtedly have
something to do wiih the tari- bill alter j
tbe House had passed it, he replied tba
there was als? some one else who a'so
would bave something to do with thc
bill, wbich, interpreted through the
medium of previona utterances, indicate*
clearly that "Mr. Taft is determined,
even to the exercise of the veto power<
to prosecute the pledges of tbe party.
It is feared tba*, an issue raised between
Mr. Taft aod Congress will prevent tbe
people at Urge from getting the benefi;
or a tarifl revision.

to prevent the democrats making the

HOU8B.
The Hoose attack oo tbe president
betan todsy wben Mr. Perkios (repu.
N. Y.) introduced bis resolution calling
for a select committee of five to consider
tbe cri iclsms of the House msde by tbe
president in his message and to report
wbat action should be taken with regard
to it.
The resolution read as f illowa:
Wheresa, there was contained in tbe sundry
civil appropriation bill, and which pa?*ed
eongresi at ita lan seaaion and became a law,
a provision in reference to the employme t
of the aecret service in the Treasury Depart?
ment and, whereas, in thc mee-sag ot the
pra-knl of the l*uited States ta the two
Houses of Congreaa, it waa stated in lefcnaM
t) tint provision: lt is not too much to aay
that thia am-ndment has been of benefit only
and it ia believed of benefit only, to the crimi?
nal claaaea only( and it waa farther aUted the
chief argument in fav?r of the provision wm
tbat the congressman dil not themselves
wi?h to be investigated by aerret eervioe men,
and it wa* further stated: But if mis is not
considered desirable, a special provision
could be made in ihe law, prohibiting ihe
use of ths ee'ret service force in investigat?
ing members of Congress It would be far
better to do thia t'.ian to do what actually
was done, snd strive to prevent, or at least to
hamper, effective ac;io i againat criminals by
the executive lirauch of the government.
Now, therefore, be it resolved, that a com?
mittee of five members of this House be ap?
pointed by the speaker to consider the state?
ments contained in the message of the pu -i
dent and report to the Hou'c what action, if
any, should be taken in reference thereto.
In presenting the resolution, Mr.
Perkins said:
"It is of importsnee to the republic
thst a'l of the co-ordir-a'e branches of
the government should possess, in a
high degree, the confidence and respect
of the people. 1 yield to no one in my
respect for the chief executive of tbe
United St-tss; and I yield to no one io
my respect for tue Congress Of tbe
United States. To the Congress is
granted great power, and upon it a-e
imposed great responsibilities. Weean
not neglect our duties, nor shirk our
responsibilities. Tbe dignity of this
body should not be punctiliously insist?
ed upon, built should be properly main?
tained.
"The statements made by the presi?
dent of tbe United Maten cannot be
I gotly disregarded. Tnese maybe so
Mustrued by the public as to lessen the
lignity and thereby impair the useful?
ness of the Congress of the United
;tates. It can be justly said, I think,
:hat these expressions were unfortucae.
Whether it is enough to say this, or
whether some more formal action should
oe taken, it will be for Congress, exer
rising a wise and discreet judgement to
lecide. I would be glad if this reso'u
ion could now be adopted without _>
>ate or dissent."
Tbere was an outbreak of appian*-1,
loth sides of tbe House j lining In hsnd

Tbe expressed wish of Mr. Perkins
hst there be no debate on the reaolu
oo waa obs'rved, aad tbe speaker put

Swan Bros.
King and Pitt Sta,,
Beg to announce their
complete readiness for the
Xmas holiday rush. The
stocks have been carefully
gathered from the best
markets and consist of the
most practical gift things
for Women, Men and
Children at exceedingly
moderate prices. We shall
make a feature to box
every present in a neat
box. We have purchased
thousands of neat, fancy
boxes at a considerable
cost specially for this pur?
pose. To avoid the usual
afternoon rush we would
suggest shopping early in
the day.
Respectfully,
SWAN BROS.
