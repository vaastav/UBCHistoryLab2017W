As representatives of the DeoDle in tbe Wia--

gambled at a time when the strength and ex
cellence of our free institutions and tbe fitness
of our citizens to enjoy popular rule bave been
again made manifest. A political contest in.
voiving momentous consequences fraught with
feverish apprehension and creatine
ness so Incense as to approach bitterness and
passion, has been waged throughout our land
and determined by the decree of free and in
dependent suffrage, without disturbance of our
tranquillity or the least sign of weakness in
uur uutioiuu structure.

In obedience to a constitutional require

The Armenian Massacres.
I At the outset of a reference to the more im
portant matters affectinir our relations with
foreign powers it would afford me suti.sfact.ton
if Icqia assure congress that thedi-turbed
conft'.tlon in Asiatic Turkey had curing ttie
Pe'at year assumed a less hideous and b.oody
Aspect, and that either as a consequence of
the awakening of ttie Turkish government to
ine acmanus or numane civilization, or as me
result of decisive action on tho part of the
great nations having the right, by treaty, to
interfere lor ine protection of tnosc exposed
to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel fanati
cism, tbe shocking features of the situation
had been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcoming a softened
disposition or positive intervention, we have
been afflicted by confirmed and not unfrequent
reports oi tne wanton destruction of Homes
and the bloody butchering of men. women ant
children, made martyrs to their profession of
vunsuan iaitn. wniie none Of our citizens In
. Turkey have thus far been killed or wounded.
though often in the midst of dreadful scenes of
danger, their safety in tho future is by no
means assured. Our government ut home ana
our minister at Constantinople have left noth
ing undone to protect our missionaries in Ot
toman territory, who constitute nearly all the
individuals residing there who have a right to
claim our protection on the score of American
citizensnip.
Several naval vessels are stationed in tbe
Mediterranean as a measure of caution and to
iurnish all possible relief and refuse iu case of
emergency.
The Cuban Insurrection.
' Tbe insurrection in Cuba still continues with
nil its perplexities. It is difficult to perceive
that any progress has thus far been made to
wards the pad lie at ion of the island or that the
situation of affairs as depicted in my last an
nual message has in the least improved. If
Spain stUI holds Havana and the seaports and
all tbe Considerable towns, the insui gents still
roam ut will over at least two-thirds of the
inland country. If the determination of .Spain
Jo put down the insurrection seems but to
fttrtngthen with the lapse of time, and is evi
denced by her unhesitating devotion of largely
increased military and naval forces to the
task, there is much reason to believe
that the insurgents have gained in
point of numbers and character and
resources, and are none the less inflexible in
their resolve not to succumb, without prac
tically securing the great objects for which they
took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established
her authority, ueither have the insur
gents yet made good their title to be regarded
as an independent state. Indeed, as the con
test goes on, the pretense that civil govern
ment exists on the island, except so far as
Spain is able to maintain it, has been practical
ly abandoned. Spain does keep on foot
such a government, more or less imperfectly,
in the large towns and their immediate sub
urbs. But, that exception .being made, the
entire country is either given over to anarchy
or Is subject to the military occupation of one
or the other party.
i It is reported, indeed, on reliable authority,
that, at the demand of the commander-in-chief
of the Insurgent army, the reputative
Cuban government has now given up all at
"tempt to exercise its functions, leaving that
government con ressedly (what there is the best
reason for supposing It always to have been in
fact) a government merely on paper.
Were the Spanish able to meet their at.tag
onists In the open, or in pitched battle, prompt
and decisive results might be looked for, and
the immense superiority of the Spanish forces
in numbers, discipline and equipment could
hardly fail to tell greatly to their advantage.
Hut they are called upon to face a toe that
shuns general engagements; that can choose,
and does choose, its own ground; that from the
nature of the country is visible or invisible at
pleasure, and that fights only from ambuscade,
and when all the advantages of position and
numbers are on Its side. In a country where
all that Is Indispensable to life in the way of
food, clothing and shelter is so easily obtain
able, especially by those born and bred on the
soil, it is obvious that there is hardly a limit to
the time during which hostilities of this sort
may be prolonged. Meanwhile, as in all cases
of protracted civil strife, the passions of the
combatants grow more and more Inflamed, and
excesses on both sides become more frequent
and more deplorable.
They also are participated in by bands of
marauders, who, now in the name of one party
and now in the name of the other, us may best
suit the occasion, harry the country at will and
plunder Its wretched inhabitants for their own
advantage. Such a condition of things would
inevitably entail immense destruction of prop
erty, even If It were the policy of both parties
to prevent it as far as practicable. Hut while
such seemed to be the original policy of the
Spanish government, it has now apparently
abandoned it, and is acting upon the same
theory as the Insurgents, mamcly, tllat the
exigencies of the contest require the wholesale
annihilation of properly, that it may not
prove of use and advantage to the enemy.
It is to tbe same end that in pursuance of
general orders, Spanish garrisons are now be
ing withdrawn from plantations and the rural
population required to concentrate itself in the
towns. The sure result wou'.d seem to be that
the industrial value of the island Is fast di
minishing and that unlesss there is a speedy
and radical change li existing conditions, it
will soon disappear altogether. That value
consists very largely, of course, in its capacity
to produce sugar a capacity already much re
duced by the interruption of tillage, which has
taken place during the last two years.
' It is reliab ly asserted that should these in
terruptions continue during the current year,
and practically extend, as is now threatened.
to the end, the sugar-producing territory of
the island, so much time and so much money
will be required to restore the land to its
normal productiveness that it is extremely
doubtful if capital can be induced to even
make the attempt. The spectacle of the utter
ruin or an adjoining country, oy nature one of
tbe aiost fertile and charming on the globe.
would engage the serious attention or trie gov
eminent and people of the United States un
der any circumstances. In point of fact they
have a concern with it which Is by no means of
a wholly sentimental or philanthropic charac
ter. It lies so near to us as to te hardly sep
arated from our territory.
Our actual pecuniary interest in it is second
only to that of the people and government of
Spain. It is reasonably estimaLed that at
least from 3.),00O.tXH) to 50,000,1 0 1 of American
capital ore invested in plantations and in rail
road, mining and other business enterprises
on the island. The volume of trade between
the United States and Cuba which, in 18s.
amounted to about (J4.000.000, rose in 18H3 to
about I103.0XIO.UX), and in M4, the year before
tbe present insurrection broke out. amounted
to nearlv 19fl.000.000. Besides this large uecu
niary stake In the fortunes of Cuba, the United
Slates finds itself Inextricably involved in the
present contest in other ways, both vexatious
ana costiy.
: Many Cubans reside in this country, and in
directly promote tho Insurrection through the
press, by public meetings, by the purchase
and shipment of arms, by theraisingof funds,
and by other means, which the spirit of our
institutions and the tenor of our laws do not
permit to be made the subject of criminal
prosecutions.
Some of them, though Cubans at heart and
in all their feelings and interests, have taken
out palters as naturalized citizens of the
United States, a proceeding resorted to with a
view to possible protection by this govern
ment, and not unnaturally regarded with much
indignation by the country of their or
igin. The Insurgents are undoubtedly
encouraged and supported by the widespread
sympathy the people of this country always
ami instinctively feel for every struggle for
better ai.d freer government, and which In
the case of the more adventurous and restless
elements of our population, leads, in only too
many instances, to active and personal partic
ipation in the contest. The result is that this
government is constantly called ucon to pro
tect American citizens, to claim damages for
injuries to persons ana property, now esti
mated at many millions of dollars, and to ask
explanations and apologies for tie acts of
Spanish officials, whose zeal for the repression
of rebellion sometimes blinds them to the lm
munit belonging to the unffenditg citiveus
of a friendly power. It follows from the same
eauses that the United States is compelled to
actively police a long line of seacoust against
unlawful expeditions, the escape of wnicn ttie
utmost vigilance will not always sunV'e to pre
vent. These Inevitable entanglement of tho

sue, The correr'myss of this forecast need be
neither effirmed nor denied. The United
States has. nevertheless, a character to main
tain as a nation, wbieh plainly dictates that
right and not might should be the ruleoflia
conduct.
Further, though' the United Slates is not a
nation to which peac is a necessity, it is In
truth the most pociuc of powers, and desires
nothing so much as to live in amity with all
the world. Its own ample and diversified do
mains satisfy all possible longings for terri
tory, preclude all dreams of conquest, and pre
vent any casting of covetous eye upon neigh
boring regions however attractive. That our
Conduct towards Spain and fc.tr dominions has
constituted no exception to this national dis
position is made manifest by the course of our
governmeht, not only thus far during the pres
ent Insurrection, but during tbe ten years that
followed tbe rising at Vara in 1866.
No other great power, it may safely be said!
under circumstances of similar perplexity,
would bave manifested the same restraint and
the same patient endurance. It may also be
said that this persistent altitude ot the United
States toward Spain in connection with Cuba
will unquestionably evince no slight respect
and regard for Spain on the part of the Amer
ican people. They, in truth, do not forget her
connection with the discovery of the western
hemisphere, nor do they underestimate the
great qualities of the Spanish people, nor fail
to fully recognise their splendid patriotism and
their chivalrous devotion to the national honor.
They view with wonder and admiration the
cheerful resolution with which vast bodies of
men are sent across thousands of miles of
ocean and an enormous debt accumulated, that
the costly possession of the Gem of the An
tilles may still hold its place in the Spanish
Crown, and yet neither the government nor the
people of the United States have shut their
eyes to the course of events in Cuba or have
failed to realize tbe existence of conceded
grievances, which have led to the present re
volt from the authority of Spain grievances
recognized by the queen regent and by
the cortes, voiced by the most patriotic and
enlightened of Spanish statesmen without
reward to party, and demonstrated by reforms
proposed by the executive and approved by the
legislative branch of the Spanish government.
It is in the assumed temoer and disposition of
tne rpanisn government to remeaytnese griev
ances, fortilled by indications of influential
public opinion in Spain, that this government
lias hoped to discover the most promising and
effective meansof composing the present strife,
with honor and advantage to Spain, with the
achievement of all the reasonable objects of
the Insurrection.
It would seem that if Spain should offer to
Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home
rnle which, while preserving the sovereignty
ot Spain, would satisfy all rational require
ments of her Spanish subjects, there should be
no just reason why the pacification of the is
land might not be effected on that basis. Such
a result would appear to be in the interest of
all concerned. It woul A at once stop the con
flict, which is now consuming the resources of
the island and making It worthless for which
ever rarty mav ultimately prevail. It
would keep intact the possessions of
Spain without touching her honor, which
will be consulted rather than Impugned by
the adequate redress of admitted grievances.
It would put the prosperity of the island and
the fortunes of its inhabitants within their
own control without severing the natural and
ancient ties wblcb bind them to the mother
country, and would yet enable them to test
their capacity for self-government under the
most favorable conditions.
It has been objected, on the one side, that
Spain should not promise autonomy until ber
Insurgent subjects lay down their arms. On
the other side, that promised autonomy, how
ever liberal, is insufficient, because without
assurance of the promise being fulfilled.
But the reosonahleness of a requirement by
Spain of unconditional surrender on the part
of tne insurgent moans neiore tneir autonomy
is conceded is not aitoiretner apparent.
it Ignores Important features or the situation
the stability two years' duration has given
to the insurrection; the feasibility of its in
definite proloncation In the nature of things,
and as shown by past experience; the utter
and imminent ruin of ihc island, unless the
present strife is speedily composed; above all,
tbe milk abuses which all parties in Spain, all
I. ranches or ber government and all ner lead
ing public men concede to exist and profess a
desire to remove.
Facing such circumstances, to withhold tbe
ptofer of needed reforms until tho parties
demanding them put themselves at mercy by
throwing down their arms, has the appearance
of neglecting the gravest of perils and invit
ing suspicion as to tne sincerity or any pro
fessed willingness to grant reforms.
The objection on behalf of the Insurgents
that promised reforms can not be relied upon
must, of course, be considered, though we
have no right to assume, and no reason for as
suming, that anything that Spain undertakes
to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done ac
cording to both the spirit and the letter of the
undertaking.
Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions and
precautious ou the part of the weaker of two
combatants are always natural ana not always
uuiustitlalilc. and being sincerely desirous in
the Interest of both as well as on its own ac
count that the Cuban problem should be solved
with the least possible deiay, it was intimated
by this (.'overnnient to the government of
Spain some months ago that, if a satisfactory
measure of home rule were tendered the Cu
ban insurgents and would be accepted ly
them upon a guaranty of its execution, the
United States would endeavor 'to find a way
not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such
guarauly.
vi one no aeunitc response to mis intimation
has yet been received from the Spanish gov
ernment, it is believed to be not altogether
welcome, while, as a treaty is suggested, no
reason is perceived why it should not be ap
uroveu nv tne insurgents, rteitner party can
fail to see the importance of early action, and
both must realize that to prolong the present
state of things for even a short period will add
enormously to the time and labor and expendi
ture necessary to bring about the industrial

that earnest efforts for healing the
breach between Spain aud the insurgent Cu

fices of the United States, either In the man
ner above outlined, or in any other way con
sistent with our constitution and laws, will al-
wavs be at the disposal of either party.

it should be added that it can not be reason

ail due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we
cannot view the pending conflict in all its
features and properly apprehend ourinevitable

friendly co-operation.
When trie inability oi Spain to oeai success- I
fully with the insurrection has become mani
fest, and it is demonstrated that ber sover
eignly is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its
rightful existence, and when a hopeless strug
gle for its re-cstablisjiment has degeuerated
into a strue wnicn means noining more man
tbe useless sacrifice of human life and the ut
ter destruction of the very subject matter of
tbe conflict, a situation will be presented in
which our obligation to the sovereignty of
Spain will be superceded by higher obligations
by which we can hardly hesitate to recognize
and discharge.
Deferring the choice of ways and methods
until the lime for action arrives, we should
make them depend upon the precise conditions
then existing; and they should not be deter
mined upon without giving careful beed to
eveiy consideration involving our honor and
interest, or the international duty we owe to
Spain. Until wc face the contingencies sug
gested or tbe situation is by other incidents
imperatively changed, we should continue In
the line of conduct heretofore pursued, thus In
ail circumstances exhibiting our obedience to
the requirements of public law and our regard
for the duty enjoined upon us by the position
we occupy in tbe family of nations.
A contemplation of emergencies that may
arise should plainly lead us to avoid their
creation, either through a careless disregard of
present duty or even an undue stimulation and
ill-timed expression of feeling. But I have
deemed it not amiss to remind tbe congress
that a time may arrive when a correct policy
and care for our interests, as well as a regard
for the Interests of ouber nations and their
citizens. Joined by considerations of humanity
and a desire to see a rich and fertilecountrv In
timately related to us saved from

our government . to such action as
will subserve the Interests than Involved, and
at the same time promise to trlta and its in

THE WAR DEPARTMENT.
Satisfactory Conditions Shown.
The report of the secretary of war exhibits
satisfactory conditions in the several branches
of the public service intrusted to his charge.
Tbe limit of our military force, as fixed "by
law, is consta: tly and readily maintained. The
present discipline and morale of our army are
excellent, and marked progress and efficiency
are apparent throughout its entire organiza
tion. With the exception of delicate duties in the
suppression of slight Indian disturbances
along our southwestern boundary. In which
he Mexican troops co-operated, end the com
pulsory but peaceful return, with the consent
of Great Britain, ot a band of Cree Indians
from Montana to the British possessions, no
active operatltns have been required of the
army during the year past.
Changes In n-ethods of administration, the
abandonment Jf unnecessary posts and conse
quent concentration of trccps, and the exer
cise of care and vigilance by tbe various offi
cers charged with tbe responsibility in the ex
penditure of the appropriatious have resulted
In reducing to 6 minimum the cost of mainte
nance of our military establishment. During
the past year the work of construction of per
manent infantry and cavalry posts has been
continued at tbe places heretofore designated.
The secretary of war repeats his recommenda

rather tUan respond to tne wishes and imptrf
tunitles of localities.
It is imperative that much of the money pro
vided for such constructions should now be
allotted to the erection of necessary quarters
for ' the garrisons assigned to the coast de
fenses, where many men will be needed to
properly care for and operate modern guns. It

The entire army has now been equipped . ft
new magazine arms, and wise policy demands
that all available public and privole resources
should be so employed as to provide, within a
reasonable time, a sufficient numoer to sum"
the state militia with these modern weapons
and provide an ample reserve for any emer
gency. The f rgHuired MIlHiR
The organized militia numbers 112,879 men.
The appropriations for its support by the sev
eral states approximate 12,800.000 annually,
and 1400,000 is contributed by the general gov
ernment. Investigation shows these troops
to be usually well drilled and Inspired with
much military Interest, but in many Instances
they are so deficient in proper arms and equip
ment that a sudden call to active duty would
find them Inadequately prepared for field
service. I therefore recommend that prompt
measures be taken to remedy this ondltion,
and that every encouragement be given to this
ceserving body of unpaid and Voluntary citi
zen soldiers, upon whose assistance we must
largely rely in time of trouble.
Our Coast Defenses,
During the past year rapid progress has been
made toward the completion of the scheme
adopted for the erection and armament of
fortiheatibnk along our sea coast, while equal
progress has been made in providing the ma
terial tor submarine defense In connection
with these works.
This improved situation is largely due to the
recent generous response of congress to the
recommendations ot the war department.
Thus we shall soon have complete about one
flfth of the comprehensive system, the first
step in which was noted in my message to the
congress of December 4. 189.1.
The experience and result of the past year
demonstrate that with a continuation ot pres
ent careful methods the cost of the remaining
work will be much less than the original esti
mate. We should always Keep in miud that of
all forms of military preparation coast de
fense alone is essentially pacific in its nature.
While it gives the sense of security due to a
consciousness of strength, it is neither the
purpose nor the effect of such permanent forti
fication to involve us in complications, but
rather to guarantee us against them.) They are
no temptation to war, out security against it
Thus they are thoroughly in accord with all
the traditions of our national diplomacy.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
Government Penitentiaries.
The attorney general presents a detailed and
interesting statement of the important work
done under his supervision during the last
fiscal year. Tbe ownership and management
by the government or penitentiaries tor tne
confinement of the convicted in United States
courts of violations of federal laws, which for
many years has been a suhject of executive
recommendation, has at last, to a slight ex
tent, been realized by the utilization of
the abandoned military prison at Fort
Leavenworth as a United States penitentiary.
This is certainly a movement tn the right
direction; but it ought to be at once supple
mented by tbe rebuilding or extensive enlarge
ment of this Improvished prison, and the con
struction of at least one more, to be located in
the southern slates.
The New Salary System.
It is most gratifying to note the satisfactory
results that have followed the inauguration of
the new system provided for by the act of
Mav 28. 1896, uni.er which certain federal offi
cials are compensated by salaries instead of
fees. The new plan was put in operation on
the first day of July. 1W0. and already the
great economy It enforces, its prevention of
abuses and its tendency to a better enforce
ment of the laws are strikingly apparent. Be
tailed evidence of the usefulness of this long
delayed but now happily-accomplished re
form will be round clearly set forth in the at
torney general's report.
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
Its Operations During the Past Tear.
Our post office department is in good condi
tion and the exhibit made of its operations
during the fiscal year, ended June 30, 1896, if
allowance is made for imperrections in the
laws applicable to It, is very satisfactory. The
total receipts during the year were 182.499,' 08 -
40. The total expenditures were 890.626.-96.84,
exclusive of $1,559,898.27. which was earned by
the Pacific railroad for transportation, and
credited on their debt to the government
There was an increase of receipts over the
previous year of f.i.nl6.'8a21, or .!
per cent., and an increase of expendi
ture of J3.83iU24.02. or 4.42 per cent.
The deficit was I.tii9,956.19 less than that of
the preceding year.
Ahnseof the Service.
The transmission at the rate of one cent a
pound of serial libraries, advertising sheets.
'house organs" (periodicals advertising some
pellicular "nouse ' or institution), sample
copies, and the like, ought certainly to be dis
continued. A glance at the reveuues received
for the work done last year will show more
plainly than any other statement the gross
abuse of the postal service aud tbe growing
waste of its earnings.
The free matter carried in tbe malls for tne
departments, offloes, etc., of the government
and for congress in pounds amount to 94.48U,-
189.
Corrective Legislation Recommended.
If such second-class matter paid merely the
cost of its handling our deficit would disappear
and a surplus result, which might be used to
give the people still better uiuil facilities or
cheaper rates of letter postage. 1 recommend
that legislation be at once enacted to correct
these abuses and introduce better business
ideas in the regulation of our postal rales.
Universal Postal Union.
The Universal Postal union, which now em
braces all the civilized world, and whose dele
gates will represent 1.0u0.uou,u(iO people, will
hold its fifth congress in the city of Washing
ton iu May, ibtti.
In view of the importance of this assem
blage and of its deliberations, and of the hon
ors and hospitalities accorded to our repre
sentatives by other countries on similar occa
sions, I earnestly hope that such an approprl-
aiion win oe mane lor ine expenses neeessa
rily attendant upon the coming meeting in our
capital city, as well le worthy of our na
tional hospitality and indicative of ourappre
ciation of the event.
' THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.
Construction of Our New Navy.
The work of the navy department and its
preseut conditions are fully exhibited in the
report of the secretary. The construction of
vessels for our new navy has been energetic
ally prosecuted by the present administration
upon the general lines previously adopted, the
department having seen no necessity for radi
cal changes in prior metheds under which the
work was found to be progressing in a manner
highly satisfactory, it nas been decided, now
ever, to provide in every ship-building con
tract that the builder should nay all trial ex
penses, and it has also been determined to pay
no speed premiums in future contracts.
The premiums recently earned and some yet
to be dec idea are ieatures or tne contracts
made before this conclusion was reached.
On March 4, 1893, there were in commission
but two armored vessels, the doubie-turreted
monitors Miantonomoh and Monterey. Since
mat date, of vessels .theretofore authorized,
there have been placed In their first commis
sion three first-class and twosecond-class bat
tleships, two armored cruisers. one
harbor-defense ram, t and five doubie
turreted monitors, including the Maine
and the Puritan. just completed,
tight new unarmorea cruisers and two new
gunboats have also been commissioned. The
Iowa, another battleship, will be completed
about March 1, and at least four more gun boats
will be ready for sea in the early spring.
The War Collage.
The war college has developed into an insti
tution which it is believed will be of great
value to tbe navy, in leaching the science of
war as well as in stimulating professional zeal
In the navy, and it will be especially useful in
the devising of plans for the utilization, In
case ot necessity, of ail the naval resources of
the united Slates. Tne secretary nas per
sistentlv adhered to tbe plan he found in oner-
ation for securing labor at navy yards, through
boards of labor employment, -and has done
much to make it more complete and efficient.
Dlacipliue in th Service.
Discipline among the ofTKers and men of the
navy nas Deen maintained to a nign standard,
and the percentage of American citizens en
listed has been very much increased.
The secretary is considering, and will formu
late during the coming winter, a plan for lay
ing up ships in reserve, thereby largely reduc
ing the cost of maintaining our vessels afloat.
The Naval Militia.
The naval militia, which was authorized a
few years ago. as an experiment, has now de
veloped into a Dody of enterprising young
men, active and energetic In the discharge of
their duties, and promising great useful
ness. T bis establishment has nearly the same
relation to our navy as - the national guard in
the different states bears td our army, and it
constitutes a source of supply for our naval

Enormous Disbursements. .
The report of the secretary' of 'the interior
presents a comprehensive and interesting ex
hibit ot the numerous and important affairs
committed to his supervision. It is impossible
in this communication to more than briefly
refer to a few of the sub
jects concerning which the secretary
gives full and instructive Information.
The money appropriated on account of this
department, and for its disburtement for the
fiscal year ended Juue 80, 18V6, amounted to
mors than it7 OOO.UOO, er griar awn than
was appropriated for the entire maintenance
of the government for the two fiscal years
end June 30, I8ei.
Tfe Pwl.lic Domain.
Our public lands, originally amounting- to
I 840,000 acres, have been so reduced that only
about 60u.0ti0.00o acres still remain in govern
ment control, excluding Alaska. Ihe bal
auce be'ng by far the most valuable portion,
has been given atrav to settlers, to new states
and to railroads, or sold comparatively
nominal sum.
National Forestry System.
The eiiaJnsWip appointed from the mem
bership of the Nation! aeudemy of sciences,
provided for by an act of cohgreis la f ormulate
plans for a national forestry system, will. It is
Loped, soon be prepared to present the result
of thorough and Intelligent examination ot this
Important subject.
Our Indian Wards.
The total inaiah population of the United
States is 177,23), according to ft cusus made in
lj. exclusive of those within the state of
New Voru and those comprising the five civil
ized tribes. Of this number there are apprcix-
mately 38 0i) chtldren or scnooi ago. uunuK
tbe ytar 23,398 of these were enrolled ana may
be in schools. The progress wnich has attend
ed recent efforts to extend Indian school facil
ities, and the anticipation of continued Iibfcrl
approprialians to tnat end, can cot fail to
anora tne utmost s,uiitm.i,ii,i i-j
lieve that the education of Indian children is
a prime factor in the accomplishment of In
dian civilization.
The l ive Clvillaed Tribes.
The condition of affairs among the five civil
ized tribes, who occupy large tracts of land in
the Indian territory, and who have govern
ments of their own, has assumed such an as
pect as to render it almost lndespensaiue that
thefe should be an entire change in the rela
tions of these Indians to the general govei n
ment. This seems to be necessary in further
ance of their own interests, as well as for he
protection of non-Indian residents in their ter
ritory. A commission organized and em
powered under several recent laws is now
negotiating with these Indians for the
relinquishment ot their courts and the di
vision of ;helr common lands in .severalty.
and are aiding in the set tlement of the trouble
some question of tribal membership, ine
reception of their first proffers of negotiation
was not encouraging. but through patience and
such conduct on their part as demonstrated
that their intentions were friendly, and in the
interest of the tribes, the prospect of success
has become more promising.
Utah Uilsonite Deposits.
It appears that a very valuable deposit oi
irilsonite or asuhaltum has been found on the
reservation in Utah occupied by the Uncom
nairhre Ute Indians. Every Consideration of
care for tho public interest, and every sensible
business reason, dictate such management or
disposal of this important source of public
revenue as will except it from the general
rules and incidents attending the ordinary dis
position of public lands and secure to the gov
ernment a fair share, at least, of its advantages
in place of its transfer for a nominal sum to in
terested individualism.
A Permanent Indian Commission.
I indorse the recommendation made by the
present secretary of the interior, as well as
his predecessor, that a permanent eon, mission,
consisting of three members, one of whom
shall be an army officer, be created to perform
the duties uow devolving mon the commis
sioner aud assistant commissioner cT Indian
affairs.
The Pension Roll.
The diminution of our enormous pension roll
and the decrease of pension expenditure which
have been so often confidently foretold stiil fail
in material realization. The muniier of pen
sioners on the roll at the cloe of the fiscal
year ended June 30. 1896, was 970.678. This is
the largest number ever reported. The amount
paid exclusively for pensions during the year
was $138,21 4,71)1.9), a slight decrease from that
of the preceding year, uuile the total expendi
tures; on account of pensions, including the
cost of maintaining the nepartuicnl and
expenses attending pension distribution,
amounted to 14 :.2iif..".ro.ri9, or within a very
small traction of one-third of the entire ex
pense of supporting the government during
tne same year, ine numoer oi new pension
certificates issued was Wi.6. Of these 40.374
represent orlginalallowance of claims, and 15,
878 increases of cxislting pensions. The num
ber of persons receiving pensions from the
United States, but residing in foreign countries
at tne close of the last fiscal year, was 3,7l,
ami the amount paid to them during the year
was $582,735 38. The sum appropriated for the
payment of pensions for the curient fiscal
year, ending ,iune .u, icvu. is smu.eou.vw, auu
for the succeeding year it is estimated that tha
same amount will be necessary.
The commissioner of pensions reports that
during the last fiscal year H3i indictments were
found against violators or the iicusiou raws.
L ion these indictments 107 convictions re
sulted.
l'ae.llc Railroad Obiigaf ions.
The secretary calls attention to the public
nterests involved in an adjustment oi tho ob-
lgations of the Pacific railroiius to the govern
ment. I deem it to bo an important duty to
especially present this subject to the consider-
tion of tne congress.
Under section 4 of the act of conpress passed
March 3. 1887; the president is charged with
the duty iu the event that any mortgage or
other incumbrance paramount to the interest
of the United States iu tiro property of tne
Pacilie railroads shall exist aud bo lawfully
liable to be foreclosed, to direct the action of
the denartinents of the treasury aud of justice
in the protection of the Interest of the United
States by redemption or through judicial pro
ceedings, including foreclosures of the. gov
ernment liens. In view of the fact that the
congress has for a number of years almost
constantly had under consideration various
p.uns for dealing with the conditions existing
between these roads anil the government, I
have thus lar felt justified iu withholding ac
tion under the statute above mentioned.
An Urgent Situation.
Iii the case of the Union Pacific, company.
however, the case has l ecome especially and
immediately urtreut. Proceeding-, have been
instituted to foreclose a first mortHae upon
these aided parts of the main lines upon
which the government holds a stcoi.d and
subordinate mortgage lieu. In consequence of
these proceedings aud increasing complica
tions, added to the default occurrirgon the
first day of January. 197, a condition will be
presented at that date, so far as this company
is concerned, that must eniphitsie the man
date of the act of 1887 and give to executive
duty under its provisions a more important
aspect.
'therefore, unless congress shall otherwise
direct or shall haie previously determined
upon a different solution of the problem there
will harcly appear-to exist any reason for de
laying, beyond the date of the default above
mentioned, such executive action as w ili prom'
isc to subserve the public interests and save
the government from the loss threatened" by
lurmer inaction.
DEPARTMENT Of AGRICULTURE
Worthy of Constant Care and Encourage
ment.
The department of agriculture is so inti
mately related to the welfare of our people aud
the prosperity of our nation that it
should constantly receive the care
and encouragement of tiie government.
From a small beginning it has grown to be
the cenier of agricultural intelliL' m e aud the
source or aiu arm encouragement 10 agrl' lll
tural enorts. large sums of money are an
nually appropriated for the maintenance of
this department, aud it must be confessed that
the legislation relating to it nas always been
directeJ iu the interest of practical farming or
properly guarded against waste and extrava
gance. So far, however, as public money has
been appropriated fairly and sensibly to help
tnose wno actually tin the son, no expenditure
has been more profitably made or more gener
ally approved by tne people.
Exports ot Purui Products.
The secretary reports that the value of our
exports of farm products during the last fiscal
year amounted to ' $5;ti,ooo,0uu, an increase of
oo.ouu over tnose of the year immediately
precearng.
This statement is not the le!s welcome be
cause or the fact thaWnotwiibstandiug such in
crease, the proportion of exported ngricurtural
products lo our total exports of oil descrip
tions fell off during the year. The benefits of
an increase in agricultural products being as
sured, the decrease in its proportion to our
total export is the more gratifying when we
consider that it is owing lo the fact that such
total exports for the year increased more than
S.O.U.O.U'.'U.
Oratnltons Distribution of Seeds.
In my opinion the gratuitous distribution of
seeds by the department, as at present con
ducted, ought to be discontinued. No one can
re a tne statement of the secretary on the
subject and doubt the extravagance and ques
tionable resulis of this practice. The pro
fessed friends of tbe fanner, and certainly the
farmers themselves, are naturally expected to
be willing to rid a department devoted to the
promotion of farming interests of a feature
wnicn tends so mucn to its discredit.

partment oi agriculture, nas continued to ex

Inter-State Com mere.
The Inter state commerce commission traV
dsrice the last year, supplied abundant erl;
dence Of ks asefnlheaa and the importance of
the work commuted to Its ebarge. Publie
transportation is wntversal necessity, and
the question of just aisflt reasonable charges
therefor has become of vitfil Importance, no
only to shippers and carriers, but Also MUM
vast multitude of producers and consunitrB'
The justice onu equity of the principles e

nature of the case, more or less tentative an4
experimental, it was hardly expect! o apply
a complete and adequate system. While ta
wholesome effects are manifest, and having
amply justified its enactment, it is evident
that all desired reforms in transportation
methods have not been fully accomplished.
In view of the judicial interorelation which
some provisions of this statute have received
and the defects disclosed by the efforts made
for H enforcement, its revision and amend
ment appear to be essential, to the end that it
may more eileetuslly reach the evils designed
to be corrected. I hops the recommendations
of the commission upon this subject will be

Rfes.
Tllfi TABIFF QUESTION.
Suggestions Touching the Present Law
and Its Operations.
j desire to recur to the statements elsewherd
Wade eoncerniug the government's receipts
and expanlitureS for the purpose of venturing
upon some st;?.iestion9 touching our present
tariff law and its operation.
This statute took effect On the 28th day of
August, 18&4. Whatever may be ! shortcom
ings as a complete measure of tariff reform, it
must he conceded that it has opened the way
to a freer and greater exchange of commodi
ties between the United States and other
countries, cnl tWus furnished a wider market
for our products aiiS manufacturers. Theonly
entire fiscal year during Mer this law baS
been enforced ended on the 30th Sat of June,
1896. In that i ear our Imports increased over
those of the previous year more than f6,500,(KXJ,
while the value of domestic products we ex
ported, and whieh found markets abroad, was
nearly $70,000,000 more than during the pre
ceding year.
Those who insist that the cost to our people
of articles coming to them from abroad for
their needful us should only be increased
through tariff charges to an extent necessary"
to meet the expenses of the government, as
well as those who claim that tariff charges
may oe laid upon sucn articles oeyouu n
necessities of governfiientreveuue.and with the
additional purpose of so increasing their price
in our markets us to give Ainerletta manufac
turers and producers better and more profita
ble opportunities, must agree that our tariff
laws are only primarily justinea as sources oi
revenue to enable the government to meet thd
necessary expenses of its maintenance. Con
sidered as to Us sufficiency in this aspect, the
present law can by no means fall under just
condemnation. 1 Hiring tne only complete
fiscal year of its operation it has yielded near
ly &8,MXUo more revenue than was received
f rom tariff duties in the preceding year. There
was, nevertheless, a deficit between our re
ceipts and expenditures of e little more thaa
$2S.otw.(XK. This, however, was not unexpected.
The situation was sucn in December last, seven
months before the close of the fiscal year, that
the secretary of the treasury foretold a defi
ciency of $17,000.(1110.
The great and increasing apprenension ana
timidity in businesscircles.and the depression
in all activities intervening since that time, re
sulting from causes perfectly well understood
and entirely disconnected with our tariff law
or its operation, seriously checked the Imports
we would have otherwise received, and readily
account for the difference between this
estimate of the secretary and the actual
deficiency, as well as for a continued
deficit. Indeed, it must be confessed that we
could hardly have had a more unfavorable pe
riod than the last two years for the collection
of tariff revenue. We can not reasonably hope
that our recuperation from this business de
pression will be sudden. I ut it has already set
in with a promise of acceleration and continu
ance. 1 believe our present tariff law, if al
lowed a fair opportunity, will, in the near fu
ture, yield a revenue which, with reasonably
economical expenditures, will overcome all de
ficiencies. Meed Not Excite or Disturb Us.
In the meantime no deficit that has occurred
or may occur need excite or disturb us. To
inet any such deficit in the treasury, in addi
tion to a gold reserve of tl o.Ooo.iKH), a surplus
of more than $128.ouo.0Cu applicable to the pay
ment of the expenses of the government, ana
which must, unless expended for that purpose,
remain a useless hoard; or. if not extravagant
ly wasted, must In any event be perverted from
the purpose of its exaction from our people.
The payment, therefore, of any deficiency In
the revenue from ihis fund Is nothing more
than its proper and legitimate use.
A Matter of Supreme Importance.
I suppose it will not be denied that under
the present law our people obtain the neces
saries of a comfortable existence at a cheaper
rale than formerly. This is a matter of supreme
importance, since it is the ;alpable duty of
every just government to make the burdens of
taxation as light as possible. Tbe people
should not be required to relinquish this
privilege of cheaper living except under the
stress of lh-ir government's necessity made
plainly manifest.
OCR FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
Weakness and Vices of Our Present
Method.
This reference to the conditions and pros
pects of our revenues naturally suggests an
allusion to tne v-eauness ana vices of ournuan
clal method. They have been frequently
pressed upon the attention of congress In
previous communications and the inevitable
danger of their continued toleration pointed
out. w ituout now repealing tnese details, I
an not rt f rain from again earnestly present-
ng the necessity of the prompt reform of a
system opposed to every ruie of sound finance
and showu by experience to be fraught with
the gravest peril ana perplexity.
Withdrawals f Cold Obligations.
Hecanse we may be enjoying a temporary re
lief from its depressing influence, this should
not lull us into a false security, nor lead us to
forget the suddenness of past visitations. I ant j
more convinced than ever that we can have
no assured financial peace and safety until the
government currency obligations upon whlcfc
gold may be demanded from the treasury nre
withdrawn from circulation and cancelled.
This might be done, as has been heretofora
recommended, by their exchange for long
term bonds bearing a low rate of interest or
by their redemption with the proceeds of such
oonos.
This plan of issuing bonds for the nurnose of
redemption certainly appears to be the most
effective and direct path to the needed reform.
in oeiautt oi tins, nowever. it would be a step
in the right direction if currency obligations,

should be cancelled instead of reissued. This
operation would be a slow remedy, but it would
improve present conditions.
National Hank Notes.
National banks should redeem their own
notes. They should be allowed to issue circu
lation to the par value of bonds deposited as
security tor redemption, ana tne tax on their
circulation should be reduced to one-fourth of
one percent.

opinion we have placed too much stress upon
tne oanger oi contracting tne currency and
have calculated too little upon the gold that
would be added to our ciicul ,tion if invited to
us by better and safer financial methods. It is
not so much contraction of our currency that
should be avoided as its unequal distribution.
The entire case may be presented by the
statement that the day of sensible and sound
financial methods will not dawn upon us until
our government abandons the banking busi
ness and the accumulation of funds, and con
fines its monetary operations to the receipt of
the money contributed by tbe people for its
support, and the expenditure or such money

MONOPOLY.
Trusts and Other Aggregitlona of Capital
Another topic in which our people rightfully
take a deep interest may be here briefly con
sidered. I refer to the existence of trusts and
other huge aiwreputlons of capital, the object
of which is to secure the monopoly of some
particular branch or trade. Industry or com
merce, and to siifie wholesome competition
When these are defended it is usually on the
ground that, though they increase prices, they
also reduce prices, and thus may benefit the
public. It must be remembered, however, that
a reduction of priees to the people Is not one of
the real oojerts ot these organizations, nor is
their tenjrncy necessarily in that direction.
If it occurs in a particular case it is only be
cause it accords with the purposes or interests
of those managing the scheme.
Though congress has attemped to deal with
this matter by lr glslalion. the laws passed for
that purpose thus far have proved ineffective,

everywhere esteemed so highly by all
who value good health. Its beneficial
effects are due to the fact, that it Is tbe
