Tho Hoys' Temperance club of tho Tenth

direction of Mrs. E. L. Shlnrock and her
daughter and Is composed of some thirty
or moro newsboys, bootblacks and street
urchins of tho vicinity of Tenth street and
Capitol avenue. For weeks the boys bavo

only on account of the feast, but ns nn
opportunity of showing their mothers Just
what their' club ami Its work meant. Ac
cordingly tho entire membership wns pres
ent, arriving quite n half hour in advance
of their guests. Sovernl of their number
had been appointed ushers and others
waiters, the first set doing tho honors as
their guests arrived, tho others busying
themselves with preventing tho girls of
tho sewing classes, who wero not Included,
from even peaking Into tho windows by
holding up their aprons, with which each
had been provided. About fifteen women
wcro present. Previous to tho tea pnrty
a program had been arrnnged, which opened
with tho roll rnll by tho secretary. Tho
first numbor was tho club's rally song,
"Wo Aro Coming," followed by tho nddresn
of welcome by Jop Mnrtneltl, which was
quite tho fenturo of tho afternoon, o tho
uptown visitors nt least. Tho youthful
speaker, after assuring the guests of tho

that they might dcrlvo much "porflt" ns
well ns enjoyment from tho occasion. Two
recitations followed by two very small
boys, who stood upon chairs that thoy
might bo seen and heard. A revlow of tho
class work by questions from Mrs. Shln
rock and tho singing of tho class song.
"Our Glasses Upsldo Down," concluded tho
program, and then enmo tho rcnl feature
of tho occasion.
Tho boys served their mothers first, tho
refreshments consisting of tea, sandwiches,
fruit, enko and crenm, tho others waiting
quietly until their turn, but when It nt
Inst arrived the boyB' nppctlto nsserted
Itself, with tho result that the tables wcro
soon cleared, nnd tho urchins departed,
well pleased with themselves nnd the work
that nffords such nu occasion.

Nr Toon Chow, editor of tho Chung Snl
Vat I'o, published In San Francisco, will
Iccturo nt the First l'resbyterlan church
tonight on "Tho CHbIb in China from tho
Stnmlpolnt ot a Chlnamnn."
Nk Toon Chow has resided In tho United
States for twenty-ono years nnd Is a grad
uate of tho San Francisco Theological sem
inary. For tho last two years ho has been
tho mnnaglng editor ot tho Chung Sal Yat
Po, tho first Chinese paper published In
tho United States nnd tho largest and moat
Influential. Tho Christmas number con
tains many elegant pictures of tho manag
lng alitor, his staff, the Chinese consul and
tho Chlneso emperor. Kdltor Chow, is en
thuslustlc over his papor, and while It Is
difficult for nn American to rend, It Is cer
tainly n thing of beauty.
"Our paper," said tho editor, "of course
circulates only among tho Chlneso. Whllo
wo have only about 0,000 subscribers, we
consider that good for tho number of peo
plo wo enn reach. You will bo surprised
to lenrn that tho troublo In South America
has effected our circulation. Wo have many
progrexfllvo Chinamen In Colon, nnd bo
cnuso of tho war twenty-flvo of our renders
hnvo requested their papers discontinued as
thoy havo becomo impoverished by tho
troublo. Tho Chung Sal Yat I'o readers In
tho United States pay $6 per year for the
paper; outsldo ot this country tho subscrlp
tlon prlco Is $8 per yenr.
"Wo Chlneso think you Americans are
.queer people," continued tho editor. "Wo
don't know why tho Chlneso exclusion act
should bo re-enacted. You aro surely not
afraid that too many Chlneso will come
hero. At tho present tlmo there aro not
moro thnn 70,000 Chinese In this country.
During tho twenty-flvo years when thoro
wns no restriction placed on Chlneso enunt
gratlon thoro was never a tlmo when thero
wcro moro than 150,000. Peoplo who come
from my country aro tho progressive class.
Thoy come to lenrn your ways and become
educated. Thoy aro a lawabldlng and law
loving class. Only tho dark eldo of tho
Chinese people has been, shown to tho
masses ot the peoplo. Tho fight ngalnst us
Is caused nnd carried on by tho politicians
nnd the labor unions. Wo aro In a falss
light.
"For Instnnce, during tho Epworth league
convention In San Francisco guides em
ployed by tho politicians nnd others piloted
the visitors to what they called tho Chl
neso quarters and showed them" tho Chines
smoking opium. The truth Is theso quarters
wero rented by politicians and theso Chlnost
wero paid to go thero and smoko and live
In filth that tho visitors would go home
and tell of tho horrors of tho Chinese quar
ters. .
"The Six Companies you hear so much
about Is also misrepresented. This Is nn
organization formed by tho Chinese ot six
districts of China. Its object Is bonevolent.
Wo tako caro of our sick nnd sond homo
our dead. Wo aro assessed nothing until
ono member desires to return to China,
and then ho pays $10. We havo requested
every Chinese In tho country to contribute
something In order that we can fight the
re-enactment of tho Chlneso exclusion net,
or to got It modified. Many of us here
would Uko to bring our families over, our
wives and children. At present wo cannot.
We want tho United States and our gov
ernment If the formor docBn't want us
to mako some kind of a treaty. It Is to
your Interest ub well ns ours. China Is the
market for American products. Wo aro
waking up nnd progress Is our watchword.
Wo want to become citizens. I havo been
hero twenty-one years, but cannot vote, nnd
yet European cmmlgrants aro allowed to
vote after a certain number of years with
out regard to charactor. We bring no an
archists here; wo bring no nihilists, Tho
Chlneso will make good, true, honest citi
zens. If. ever we got a vote, then the good
and, bright side of the Chlneso will be
shown nnd the fight on us by politicians
will cease. Many peoplo In California are
now petitioning their congressmen to work
for the removal of tho restriction of Cal
uese cmmlgratlon."
