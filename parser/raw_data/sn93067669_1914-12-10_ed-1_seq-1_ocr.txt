FRANK MAKES
A STATEMENT
Denounces Spirit of Mob Violence
Which Pervaded Court Room
at His Trial.
(By AsMdafed Prest.)
ATLANTA; GS., Dec. 9.-Leo Ta.
Frank today waa sentenced in the
Fulton county auperior court to be
hanged on Friday, January 22. for the
murder here tn April. 1913, of Mary
Phagan. a 14-year old factory girl.
; Before receiving sentence, wbicn
was pronounced by Judge Ben H. Hill,
Frank made a statement to the court,
denouncing the "spirit of mob violence
which pervaded the court room' at '
bia trial; declaring bia death wouiu
lay an indelible stain upon Georgias
name for Justice," and charging that
James Conley, the negro sweeper at
the factory of which Frank was super
intendent, ar>d who waa the States
principal witness against Franky had
committed perjury.
, Tho ?talement waa as folio wa :
"May it please your honor, thia ia
a momentous day-a day of far reach
ing importance to the State of Geor
gia and to .the majesty of the law even
than to myself, for under the guise of
law your honor Ia about to pronoun e..
words that will condemn to death an
Innocent man. Transcending in im
portance the loas of my life ia tho in
delible stain and dishonor resting av
on the name ot the State by reason m
Its. Judicially murdering an Innocent
man. The Jury's verdict of August 26/
1913, rinding me guilty of the death
of Mary Phagan, did not then and does
not now apeak the truth. I .declare to
your honor, and to the world that that
verdict was made In an atmosphere
seething with mob violence and clam
or for my life- a verdict based on evi
dence absolutely false which under
other, circumstances would not have
been given a moment's credence. .
"Your honor, I deeply sympathize
with the parenta ot Mary Phagan.
The brute that brought so much grief
upon them has plunged me into sor
row and misery unspeakable, and is
about to accomplish my undoing.
"But thia I khow, my execution will
mark the advent of a new era in Geor
gia, where a good name and stainless
honor count tor naught against the
word of a vile crimina); where the
testimony of southern white women
of unimpeachable character ls brann
ed as false by the prosecution, disre
garded by the Jury, and the perjured
vaporings of a black brute alone ac
cepted Ss the whole truth; where a
mob crying for blood invaded the court
room and becamr the dominant factor
in what should .'ave been a solemn
Judicial trial. Oh, shame- that these
things be true!
"Life ls very sweet tu me. It Is not
an i easy thing to give up the love bf
dear ones, of wife and pan cn ts, or
even loyal frienda. Though this he
true, death has no terrors for me. 1
go to mr end ia the full consciousness
of innocence and in the firm convic
tion that, aa there is a God in Heaven,:
my full vindication must come soma j
day. With the dawn of that day, there
will come to the people ot Georgia
a ?oil realisation of this horrible mis
take, 9 mistake irretrievable- the
execution v?f an Innocent man, a vic
tim of perjury, prejndice and passion."
Today marks the third time Prank
has been sentenced to death for the
Phagan girl's murder. Resentence is
in accordance with the State supreme
courts refusal to net aside the con
viction on the grouAd that Frank was
absent from the court room when the
verdict was returned.

the Vorth asa, and while they have
not made any marked advance, they
have been.able, according to officia!
announcement, to organise and con
solidate poettioas won during the last

without opposition from the Germans

Act of Wer.
(By AjMdstad Pro?.)
WASHINGTON. Dec. P.-If the con
tending Mexican forcea opposite Naco. !
AH?., do not cease firing into Amerl- !
can territory the three batteries of'
field artillery sent to the International
Une wll be ordered to return the dre.
'filia ia the Unfed States Govern
ment's determination, it became
known tonight after a full discussion
of the situation by President Wilson
and his cabinet. No specific orders
have been given, but while Brigadier
General Tasker H. Bliss, who waa di
rected to proceed to Naco, with the
field artillery, ls en route there, offl
c?al? expect an answer to the sharp
warning given to Mexican factions
battling across the border that bullets
and shelbi must not fall on American
BOll.
No act of "aggression" is contem
plated, a statement made by the <
White House today said, but officials j
draw a distinction between aggressive !
and defensive action. Por cavalry or
field artillery to cross the Mexican
line or open fire first would constitute
sn act of aggression, but to remain
on American soil and return the fire
of the Mexicans is, in the opinion of |
high officials,, a measure ot defense
fully Justified and not an act of war
or invasion.
The White House statement issued
by Secretary Tumulty after a confer
ence with Ute President was as fol
lows:
"It has been thought wise to streng
then the forces at Naco be causo of
the recklessness of the contending
factions there in tailing to control the
Direction of their fire. Of course, no
aggressive action is contemplated.'
It waa explained at the war depart
ment that the artillery ordered to
Saco could fire over the Mexican town
Into the lines of the Mexican factions
which, insisted on firing Into Ameri
can territory. Thia ls the plan should
warnings prove futile. The general ex
pectation however, is that no such
contingency will arise.
The Washington government's ac
tion constitutes a precedent for the fu
ture and was taken to mean that' any
tiring into American territory along
the border would be met by similar
steps. Many telegrams bad come te.'

bullets and at yesterday's cabinet

ON PUNT
ENTIRE BLOCK OF REINFORC
ED CONCRETE BUILDINGS
BURNED OUT BY
FLAMES
?3,000 PEOPLE
OUT OF WORK
[At the Inventor Stood Watching
Flames He Said "IH Start AU
Over Again Tomorrow."
(fly Associated Pr*!?.)
WEST ORANGE, N. J., Dec. 9.-Fire
destroyed virtually the satire malu
plant of the Edison company hare to
night, causing damage estimated at
nearly $7,000,000 with insurance that
it is expected will reduce the lou to
approximately $6,000,000.
An entire square block ot modern
reinforced concrete buildings which
aero supposed to be fireproof waa
burned out by the flamea. The only .
building saved in the block was the
laboratory building, containing valu
ablo scientific machinery under imme
diate superintendence ot the inventor.
Thomas A. Edison. Especial efforts
made to save this structure were suc
cessful.
It ls eslnraicd that 3,000 men and
women will be temporarily thrown
out of work because of the fire. In
all about 7,000 persons were employed
st the plant, but aa the storage bat
tery building across the street from
the main plant waa saved with other
buildings* nearby, lt will he possible
to keep something more than halt the
force employed.
Four firemen were injured fighting
the blaze and were taken to a hospital.
. although I am more than 07 yean
ot age, I'll start all over again to
morrow," said Mr. Edison. "I am pret
ty well burned out tonight, but to
morrow there will be a mobilisation
hers sud the debris will be cleared
away if lt ls cooled sufficienty, and I
will go right tc- work. ia FrCiuittrs'j*
the plant."
The inventor expressed himself thus
as he stood watching the flames lick
up building after building, ot his mam
moth electrical plant, started, it la
thought probable, by an explosion in
the inspection budding, ons ot the,
smaller frame structures. This bulld
lna waa quickly m. m o CM nf fi?~s; ??u
the fire spreadrapldly to other struc
I tures. Chemicals in some ot the build- ?
ings made the firs fighting extremely
difficult. Explosions occurred fre
quently. All employes at work ia var
ious buildings escaped.
In all eleven buildings in the main
plant were destroyed. The . buildings
destroyed included those occupied by
the New Diamond Disc Company, the
one occupied by the Klnetophone Com
pany and the building which housed
the li?tes numbering machines, to
gether with the Edison primary bat
tery bujldlng, the talking machine
building and the administration build
ing.
Fire department* from Orange. East
and South Orango, Bloomfield, Mont
clair and Newark responded to a call
for help, but wurt, badly handicapped
by lack of sufficient pressure. Electric
light wires of the town went out of
commission when the power bou?a at
the Edison plant waa destroyed,
plunging the place into daran sse.
From the biasing electrical plant it
self, bower ar, there shot np towering
flames which illuminated tho country
for miles around.
Mr. Edison was not at the plant
wben the firs started, but hs soon
appeared and assumed personal
charge of directing the C?rete combat
ting the flames. He was especially
anxious regarding the laboratory
building and when ho found that it
probably would be impossible to save
the greater part of the rest Sit the
plant he had the effort of the fire
fighters centered upon this?structure.
In the mes ntime much of the valuable
scientific apparatus, drawings, models
and other treasured possessions Ot the
inventor In thu building as could be
readily moved were carried to a place
of safety.
After the fire Mr. Edison made the
estimate ot the loss entailed.
