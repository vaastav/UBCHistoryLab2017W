A TEEBIBLE DEATH.
Mrs. Alsop Thrown Out ofHer Bug
gy andfaKilledv -
Last week we announced the death of
Mrs. J. E. Alsop but were not able to give
any of the particulars. The following we
taken from the Taeoma Globe of date of
November 25 th:
"Mrs. James E. Alsop, the wife of the
superintendent of the Lake Park Land,
Railway and Improvement company, was
accidently killed late yesterday afternoon
by being thrown out of her carriage, which
was dragged over an embankment by
her horses, which had run away in the
new addition to Taeoma. Her skull was
crushed, and although she was alive when
picked up by her husband she lived only
about an hour. Her body was baought
to this city by Undertaker Hoska and is
at her late home, No. 705 Yakima avenue
Early in the afternoon Mrs. Alsop and
her husband left their home together in a
buggy to visit a house on the top of the
hill, which they had- rented a few days
ago. On Monday evening last while they
were attending a lecture a lamp exploded
at their residence on Yakima avpnue, and
although the damage was slight they im
mediatly arranged to change their abode
to the new addition. Their visit to the
house yesterday was for the purpose of
measuring the floors of the several rooms
for carpeting. The house adjoins that oc
cupied by Mr. Harvey. They finished
the work about 5 o'clock and started
to return home in the buggy. While
driving down the hill, a short distance
from the bouse in the new addition, the
horse became fractious and disarranged
his harness. Mr. Alsop restrained the
animal, and bringing him to a standstill,
jnmped out of the carriage to fix the har
ness. While so engaged the horse again
became restless, and with a leap sprang
away from Mr. Alsop and dashed down
the hill at a furious gait. Mrs. Alsop
bravely seized the reins and endeavored
to check the animal's mad flight, but
without success. He paid no heed to her
efforts, but ran at breakneck speed for
quite a distance. Going down the hill in
front of the runaway was a wagon load
of hay. The runaway horses soon cov
ered the distance between the obstacle in
the road and shied to one side and dash
ed over tho embankment, about fifteen
feet high. Mrs. Alsop was hurled from
the buggy and fell with a crash against a
small stump, striking on her head. Her
skull was crushed and her scalp badly
torn. She was rendered unconscious,
and was lying as if dead when her hus
band found her. With the assistance of
another gentleman the insensible woman
was tenderly carried to a house on Thir
tieth street, between F and G streets.
Medical assistance was hastily summoned
but despite all efforts she passed away
about 9 o'clock. Undertaker Hoska was
sent for and he took charge of the body.
As soon as the 10-year-old daughter of
the deceased heard of her mother's death
Bhe exclaimed: 'My mamma is in Heav
en." Mrs. Alsop was abont 43 years of
age, and was a very estimable lady. She
was the mother of two children, one of
whom is a young married man, and the
other the little girl whose pathetic remark
brought tears to tne eyes of all who
heard her.

Herb. Douglas, living in Adair town
ship, has one of the finest fish ponds in
the county. Four years ago he placed 12
carp in a pond and a short time ejnee he
drained the water off and counted over
5,000. Some of those first placed in the
pond will now weigh twelve or fourteen
pounds each.
We have discovered that the first
term of district court was held in this
county in May, 1881. That Judge Nellis
presided. That Ben. C. Bich and Fry
Bryant were admitted to practice law at
that time. That Jim Hall was district
clerk and that there were 19 cases on the
docket. That S. J. Osborn was county
attorney and J. F. Allen sheriff.
A farmer down at the other corner of
this townslu'p has a novel way of watering
his stock during a calm. He has invent
ed a suitable "nipple," and has taught bis
stock how to use it. When the wind is too
light to raise the water, he attaches this
patent mouth piece, and when any one of
his beasts get thirsty it goes to the well
and gets its own drink. Such an inven
tion would be a great convenience in any
country where the wind is less constant
than it is in western Kansas. SclJLirA
Graphic.
As an experiment we asked twelve of
our business men this week, "What is the
news?" The answer invariably was, "I
don't know of anything." And yet we
are expected each week to fill our paper
with news of a local nature and if we don't
we are liable to censure. The hardest thing
newspaper men have to encounter in
small country towns is the scarcity of
news items. It is much more difficult to
publish a readable local paper in a small
town than in a city and we are constrained
to believe that the man who can furnish
a moderately newsy paper in western
Kansas would make a howling success in
a metropolis.
Last Monday morning we were Bit
ting in our sanctum and wrestling with
an editorial entitled "Moral Suasion, as
it should be applied to the American In
dian, when a youth young and inex
periencedjust budding into manhood,
as it were called. We use the words
"young and inexperienced" advisedly, for
if it had been otherwise this would never
have been -written. The following pro
ceedings were then had and done: "Say,
are you the printer?" We were not, we
were the editor, but seeing that the afore
said young man was not very well versed
in the nomenclature of the print Bhop, we
answered in the affirmative. "I have a
flittle pome' here on 'Winter which I
hastily dashed off, and which I would
like to have printed in your paper. I
would also like to have twenty-five copies
of the paper containing the same and "
Here we smiled a child-like and" bland
smile, such as we keep in stock for just
such occasions, and kindly referred him
to our mechanical supervisor, in the. other
department, imported for such emergen
cies, weighing about one hundred and
ninety pounds and measuring three and
a-half feet across the back. What trans
pired beyond the inner door will probably
never be recorded fullv. It Rnnndd
something like an Indian ghost dance,
but more like nlavinc ten trins nnd a nnrfc
of a dull thud occasionally byx way of
variation. We arrived just in tine to see
a pair of number 10 boots on the inside
of the window apparently attached to and
connected with something on the outside
of the building. But it was only for. a
moment and then all was still. The
young man had disappeared, arMso had

may notbe plain, but we are compelled
to draw the line somewhere. We have

A Christrnas Greeting.

A very marry Chriatmas and haDDy
$ew Year to all our friends. Another
holiday season is right at our doors,
bringing its Christmas duties as well as
its cheers. You have presents to buy.
undoubtedly, and you feel that,the selec
tion of nice and appropriate articles, at
prices within the limits of your purse,
will prove no small task. Almost every
body is in the same state of mind at the
present time. It is the great duty Christ
mas imposes on parents and friends that
they shall go forth and buy gifts for
their loved ones, and we may add that
they usually put it off nntil the eleventh
hour and then go about it so crowded for
time, and bo uncertain about what to get
and whore to find it that Christmas gifts
are not the carefully choeen and appro
priate selections they should be. But to
every reader who wishes to make a success
of Christmas shopping we say commence
in time. Our stock of holiday goods is
all unpacked and ready for inspection. It
will not be larger at any time, but, on the
contrary, will constantly grow smaller and
smaller, day by day, until Christmas. If
you have an idea that I may possibly
meet your wants in any way, now is the
time to come in and see what I have to
offer. Later, I shall have fewer goods, a
crowded store and less time at my dispo
sal. Please bear in mind that it will be
to your advantage in every way to be
early for the best pick, and if I should
not have what you want, I will gladly or
der what you do want. In prices I am
indeed determined to make a merry Xmas
for all my customers, I have bought
carefully and closely and those that pat
ronize me shall have the advantage of
these terms. Inviting you to call and
see our line of holiday goods, and again
expressing the best wishes of the season,
I remain, very respectfully,
O. A. Cobtbight.

Mrs. Elmira Scott died Wednesday
morning Dec. 3, at the residence of her
father H. M. Buss, of Collyer. The
deceased came to this county, from Mis
souri, several months since, for the' ben
efit of her health, but that dread disease,
consumption, had too firm a hold for her
to derive more than temporary relief from
our climate.
