T! President thinks the rights of prop-
r!
the creations of t!
human intel-
et ought to be given full recognition and
he therefore recommends the adoption of
the international copyright law which was
signed by repi esentat i ves of most of the
tivi'ied governments in September last,
in the interest of American artists he rec--n.
mends the abolition of the tax on for
eign p tinting- and drawings.
The receipts of the government for the
!:-eal" year ending June o()ih, lssc, were
bi'.i.r-.'T.dO. Of this amount the bulk
.v,i- laid by receipts from customs and in
ternal revenue. These two sources fur
nished: From Customs 1 02. 00,"i, 023.41.
from Internal Tlevenue.. 1 Hi,S05,9:.56.48.
The gain in these items for the past year
was nearly sixteen million dollars. The
t xt't tise at the different custom houses of
collecting this increased customs revenue
u.ts l.-ss than the expense attending the
collection of such revenue for the preceed
i: g year by 490,G03; and the increased
receipts of internal revenue were collected
at a cost to the internal revenue bureau
-Si " ".'' I i. '.''.) less than the expense of such
collection for the previous year. This
f.aks loudly for Democratic economy.
I'.'iiiocrats collected more money than Re-
uhlieans and did it at a cost of nearly
'. ii hundred thousand dollars less.
The President then goes on to show, by
'igures and facts, that during the last year
the expenses of the government were "242,
ls',.1 :!-.. "50 a saving in the expenditures
'' the previous year of nearly eighteen
tiiiliion dollars. Take this, with the sav
ing in collecting the revenue, and Presi
dent Cleveland's administration has saved
t' t he country in one ear about forty
cents for every man, woman and child in
the I uited States. Put beyond this, there
;.; low a surplus in the Treasury of over
ninety three million dollars, as against
sixty-three million at the close of the pre
vious year, beins; an increase in such sur
I't is of thirty and a half million dollars.
This is a gtiin of over fifty cents to every
man. woman and child in the United
"tat.-s. Added to the saving above men-t:o!i,-d
it would give to each inhabitant
HV'iut ninety cents or nearly one dollar.
Thi- in one yt -ar of Democratic rule, and
yet th.-re in ,, people w ho have not ytt been
ah!,. Ut .tlly improvement by reason of
the Democratic administration.
Commenting on the large surplus in the
Irca.-iiry s9'J,000,000 Mr. Cleveland re
commends that legislative action be taken
to relieve the people from thy unnecessary
hunl, -n of taxation made apparent by the
presence of a large surplus. He says, and
h:s words ought to be committed to mem
! and taught to every child:
Wh EX MOKE OF THE TKOI'LE'S substance
EXACTED THKOl'li H THE FORM OF TAXATION
THAN Is NECESSARY TO MEET THE Jt'ST OBLI
GATIONS O-.- THE GOVERNMENT AND THE EX-i'l-NSE
OF ITS ECONOMICAL ADMINISTRATION,
SI' H EXACTION BECOMES RUTHLESS EXTOR--T'tN
AND A VIOLATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL
I'UINC II'LES OK A FREE GOVERNMENT.
This utterance, in itself, is a Democratic
platform. To the above add the follow
ing, and we have an expre.-sion of Demo
cratic faith that makes the message worthy
of preservation ami study:
All the people know that the average
rate of Federal taxation upon imports is to
day, in time of peace, but little less, while
upoti -orie articles of necessary cou-wunp-tion
it is actually more, than was imposed
by the grievous burden willingly borne,
at a time when the government needed
millions to maintain by war the safety and
integrity of t he Union.
It has been the policy of the govern
ment to collect the principal part of its
revenues by a tax upon imports; and no
chatiL" in this policy is desirable. Put
the present condition of affairs constrains
our people to demand, that by a revision
of our revenue laws, the receipts of the
government shall be reduced to the neces
sary expen-e of its economical admini-tra-t
ion; and this demand should be recognized
and obeyed by the people's representatives
in t he legislative branch of the govern
ment. In readjusting the burdens of Federal
taxation, a sound public policy requires
that such of our citizens as have built up
large and important industries under
present conditions, should not be suddenly
ami to their injury, deprived of advant
ages to which they have adapted their
business, but if the public good requires
it, they should be content with such con
sideration as shall deal fairly and cau
tiously with their interests, while the just
demand of the people for relief from need
less taxation is honestly answered
The relation of the workingman
to the revenue laws of the country, and
the manner in which it palpably influences
the question of wages, should not be for
gotten in the justifiable prominence given
to the proper maintainance of the supply
and protection of well paid labor. And
these considerations suggest such an ar
rangement of government revenues as
shall reduce the expense of living, while
it does not curtail the opportunity for
work nor reduce the compensation of
American labor, and injuriously affect its
condition and the dignified place it holds
in the estimation of our people.
Put our farmers and agriculturalists
those w ho from the soil produe: the t hings
con.-umed by all are perhaps more direct
ly and plainly concerned than any other
t if our citizens, in a ju.-t and careful sys
tem of federal taxation. Those actually
engaged in and more remotely connected
with this kind of work, number nearly
t tie half of our population. None labor
harder or moie continuously than they.
Xo enactments limit their hours of toil,
and no interposition ot the government
enhances to any great extent the value of
their products. And yet for many of the
necessaries and comforts of life, which
the most scrupulous economy enables them
to bring into their homes, and for their
implements of husbandry, they are obliged
to pay a price largely increased by an un
natural profit which, by the action of the
government, is triven to he more favored
manufacturer.
1 recommend that, keeping ia view all
these considerations, the increasing and
unnecessary surplus of national income
annually accumulating, be released to the
people, by an amendment to our revenue
laws which shall cheapen the price of the
necessaries of life and give freer entrance
to such imported material.- as by American
labor may be manu! act ui cd into niarket
ab! e co m m od i t ies;
Nothing can be accomplished however,
in the direction of this much-needed re
form, uii less the subject is approached in
a patriotic spirit of devotion to the inter
ests of the entire country ami with a will
ingness to yield something for the public
g tod .
t l.oal.O P5.ot was paid upon the public
debt during the last fiscal year. During
the same time 2!,fi:5y,90."i silver dollars
were coined, and the cost of the silver
used in such coinage" was $2;'., I t.'.ioO.ui .
In 1 S 7S, when the compulsory coinage act
was passed, the intrinsic value of the sil
ver dollar was 94J cents. Now the intrin
sic value of these silver dollars is 7 cents.
In eight years the decrease in value has
been 1GV cents. In view of the fact that
the vaults of th Treasury are full to over
flowing, that the silver dollar has depre
ciated in value, that the people ought to
be protected in their currency, and the in
crease of our gold exportations during the
last year, the President recommends a
suspension of the coinage of silver.
Following the more interesting ques
tions of public revenue and expenditures,,
tariff and silver coinage, comes the recom
mendations relating to the Army and Na
vy, the Post-office and Interior Depart
ments. The Indian policy is discussed at
some length and the appointment of a
Commission is recommended. The pen
sion operations are referred to and pre
sented fully and patriotically. The total
amount paid for pensions since 1 sill is
shown to be SOS,G2-t,Hll.a7.
The re-recommendation made at the
special session of Congress to add to the
present function of the labor bureau the
tower of arbitration where differences
arise between employer and employed, is
insisted upon by a reference to the pres
ent labor troubles.
The operations of the Agricultural De
partment, Patent Office and other matters
pertaining to the details of administration
are touched upon. Congress is told that
it is a plain duty to pay the depositors in
the Freeman's Saving Bank amounting to
.$1,291,744.50, and local affairs in Wash
ington City are discussed briefly.
fpon the question of Civil Service Tie
form the President says:
'The continued operation of the law re
lating to our civil service has added the
most convincing p. oofs of its necessity
and usefulness. It is a fact worthy of
note that every public officer who has a
just idea of his duty to the people, testi
fies to the value of this reform. Its
staunchest friends are found among those
who understand it best, and its warmest
supporters are those who are restrained
and protected by its requirements
Our Civil Service Reform may be im
perfect in some of its details; it may be
misunderstood and opposed; it may not
always be faithfully applied; its designs
may sometimes miscarry through mistake
or wilful intent; it may sometimes trem
ble under the assaults of its enemies or
languish under the misguided zeal of im
practicable friends; but if the people of
this country ever submit to the banish
ment of its underlying principle from the
operation of their government, they will
abandon the surest guarantee of the safety
and success of American institutions."
SENATOR VANCE AT THE HUB.

Ill thf Entire Lecture There i o iu-.li
Over New Eiisland The Lectur i an
A hie Pre-cntat ion ot Southern Idea-.
We publish below a synopsis of Senator
Vance's lecture in Tremont Hall, post n,
Mass., Dec. Mil., on "Political Feeling
and Sentiment During the War." The lec
ture was delivered for the benefit of I. A.
Andrew Post (I. A. U. We have read the
lecture or rather copious extracts there
from and regret that our space foi bids its
publication in its entirety. A defence of
the South in Host on was doubtless a de
cided novelty in that city in which the
anti-slavery movement had its birth and
most able champions. Heated under the
shadow of Hunker Hill, listening w ith rapt
interest to the eloquence of Wendell Phil
lips, paying daily reverence to Charles
Sumner, the Hostoniau as naturally
thought of a Southern soldier as "a rebel"
as he thought of Lincoln as a patriot.
Fed since the war by partizan and mali
cious lies about the South the men of the
Hub may have wondered if any good thing
could come out of Nazareth. Some of
their broad men had heard Senator Vance
and been impressed with his candor, his
honesty and his ability as a popular lec
turer. He was invited to speak in Boston.
Think of that! Twenty years ago the city
would have been decidedly too cool to
wards a prominent Southern soldier to
give him a warm reception.
We rejoice that our great Senator, who
better than any other prominent citizen
of the commonwealth represents North
Carolina sentiment and North Carolina
prejudices, as well, accepted the invita
tion to speak before a portion of the Crand
Army of the Republic in Boston. We re
joice that he discussed the war and gave
to the Northern people a clear statement
of the reasons that induced Southern men
to secede. It is an admirable lecture
honest, straightforward, with an occa
sional flash of humor. The Boston Globe
published it and the Boston press spoke
pleasantly of it.
We do not believe there is now in the
South a man in public life who is so many
sided and so typical of the best type of
the Southerner as Senator Vance. There
are better lawyers, better scholars, better
specialists, but not one we believe who
has his ability in so many departments.
For this reason, as well as for the reason
that he is a North Carolinian, we are glad
that he was the lirst to represent our
lost cause in the home' of tin: highest cul
ture and the peculiar abode of the anti
slavery sentiment.
The following synopsis written by the
Boston correspondent of the Baltimore
Sun is, to be given in such small space,
excellent. Head and preserve tor your
children:
The Senator's remarks were devoted to
the attempt oil the part of the North to
forestall history in regard to the civil war,
and to impress upon all who look part in
it on the Southern side the stigma of
I rea.-oti, to which he said that all crime
is to be found in criminal intent, and no
Southern man believed he was engaged in
rebellion or treason; that secession was
constitutional and right; that the Southern
people had beef, so taught by Northern
and Southern statesmen: that the univer
sal understanding when the constitution
wits adopted was that when a State deem
ed herself injured by its lestrictions she
had the right to withdraw. The founda
tion for tiiis decision," he said, "was
Madison's resolution of 179S. Massachu
setts accepted this doctrine, and asserted
her right and threatened to execute it in
when Louisiana was annexed. She
again asserted this right in the Hartford
Convention several years later. The reso
lution of 1798 became the political plat
form of the Democratic party, and was
enunciated again and again by national
conventions, and candidates of that party
professing these principles had carried a
majority of the American people. Thus
feeling and being reared to believe that
doctrine accepted, no Southern man could
be legally convicted of crime for thus at
tempting to carry it out. No court has
ever decided that secession was treason,
and therefore there could have been no
criminal intention as there was no crimi
nal knowledge. It is therefore unfair and
untruthful to continue to speak of seces
sion as treason. The question never was
decided until it was decided by the war."
"They do us Injustice, " continued Sena
tor Vance, "when they say that slavery
was the cause of the wai-; in truth, it was
only an occasion of the war. The real
cause of the war was the attempt of the
federal government to control the internal
affairs of the States. Had we submitted
to the interference of the general govern
ment in regard to slavery, we would have
been precluded from resisting that inter
ference in regard to anything else what
ever, w hich would have'made an absolute
end of the sovereignty of each State over
its own affairs." He then went on to
state that for the the sin of slavery itself
the responsibility must be divided between
the North and South. Rhode Island and
Massachusetts ships (slavers) went to Af
rica, bought slaves for New England rum;
the South also bought them. When the
Northern States found the climate im
suited to slaves, they sold them to the
Southern States, quit the business and
turned philanthropists. Massachusetts,
New Hampshire and Connecticut joined
extreme Southern States, the two Caroli
nas and Georgia, when the constitution
was formed and postponed for twenty
years the suppression of the slave trade,
so that on both subjects, secession ami
slavery, New England is not in a condition
to throw stones at anybody else.
He then proceeded to speak of how se
cession was accomplished; how it was re
ceived by the common people; how the
civil authorities were supported by popu
lar opinion throughout the lirst year or so
of the war; the necessity for conscription
acts and their effect on the popular opin
ion in the South; the social condition of
the South during the war, when shut off
by blockade from all the world; what peo
ple did and said and thought and lelt, and
especially what they did in the way of im
proving their manufactories of war ma
terial, food and clothing, and all imple
ments used in the industries of daily life.
Public feeling in the Confederate cause
only began to wane when losses in our
army could no longer be supplied, and a
I great mass of he people thought of tivat
j ing for peace. He explained the d.fficul
tit of negotiations which were in the way.
I IVitu State ami Confederate authorities
! were bound by a constitution and a gov
ernment of Confederate Mates. -In my
opinion," he .-aid, "it was a great mi-t.ik"
to have formed any con-tit tit ion, for the
Confederacy was restrained by its ow n
eon-titution. In view of the great odd
against ; he Conl'ederacv , they.-hou'd hae
stripped them.-elves naked of ail i twsor
constitutions and ljowed to one will"
Speaking of the nero question m eon
nection with the war, the nator s:id:
"The North predicted that the - a . . -would
be incited to commit munlt r. in
cendiarism, and bring on ail the horrors
of servile war. They found if quite the
contrary. The negro wa- a positive
mciit of strength to the South. By rea-on
of hi.-service in the fielus we ftv enabh d
to put in our army far more white men
than we could have done but for the pres
ence of the negro. Instead of insurrection
anil outrage, the negro not only refrained
from any act of vengeance when an op
portunity came, but in a huge measure
faded to embrace the opportunity of lr. e
doin itself when the Federal armies came.
Few followed t e ainiy off', .".nil still fewer
ran away to get to the armies. They
stayed quietly on the old plantation, cul
tivating the liehls, ami earing for the
women and children with a kindness anil
loyalty that gives the lie direct to charges
of cruelty and iil-t reat ment to which they
were said to be subjected."
In conclusion the Senator said: "I
now assert, though my ha'r has since be
come white, that 1 would tight years
against any attempt to reinstate secession
in my country. I do not believe there is
one man in one hundred in all the South
w hose sentiments .are not the same. I am
sure there is not in the land of my nativ
ity and my unchanging love -North ' 'ar
olina." Annual Session ol Ihe "on (ere nee ol I lie

Extract from I'rivate Letter from a Cape
Fear Farmer.
Trade seems to me now to be without
any basis. In another month th mer
chants will begin to feed the fanner, (God
bless the merchant, for how ei.-e could the
poor farmer live), and then flon.r worth
if 1.50, fetches -1,8.50, ami next Fall the
cold pinches ju t as it did this, for it takes
all the crop to pay up. Who's to blame
not the merchant! Not the farmer! Then
who is? 1 can't answer certainly, but it
does seem to me that we need more and
cheaper money. To get tnis ought the
tax on State banks to remain? Fayctte
viile had four banks in ante bell 11 m, now
two only with a circulation of perhaps
one-tenth. The only argument I hear
against it is the money don't pass in other
States. What a small thing to get specie
to travel on it is hardly ever worth a pre
inium.

to the laudatory speeches of the silvcr
tonged oratt is ot North Carolina until
they have been persuaded to Ixdieve that
their State is the grandest under heaven.
A few days since it was my pleasure to be
conversing with a lady by no means un
informed on general subjects and finally
she inquired what State I was from. Like
every North Carolinian would have done.
I assumed my proudest attitude, and an
swered quickly "I am a Tar heel!" "A

: niitil yesterday. Often I have read of
money returned to the Natioual Treasury
by people who wrote that they had taken
it dishonestly ami that their conscience
i roubled them until they returm tl it. I
had thought how many months we could
run all our public schools if the men who
misappropriated and stol" money in the
years of Republican rule following the
war, would have a touch of conscience
j and return it to : he Sta i e T rea-urer. Mr.

If you ask most men you meet, w het her
on Fayt tteville street, or at the railroad
shops, or on the roads leading from Ral
eigh, what they think of the action of the
county commissioners iu the recent giving
of bombs by the county officers, you will
find that most of them condemn the com
missioners for troubling Mr. Wynne when
everybody was satisfied that his bond was
all right, but commend them for requiring
a better bond from the new ,-herilf than
the one lit? first offered, and soi.e .--a; his
present bond is not good enough.
It ha- not been generally known until
now that the full amount of ll penalty
of a bond might be regarded as ,1 liability,
and even now that rule has not controlled
the commissioners. In the giving of bonds
discretion must be lodged somewhere and
no Median law ought to prevail. What .1
county or state want.-, a public officer to
do is to give a bond that is good, but it
ought not to rt quire anything more than
that. 1 don't believe that a man ought to
be debarred, .-0 to speak, from ..igumg the
bond of a man because, by some rem tc pos
sibility, lie might be liable on a not her bond.
