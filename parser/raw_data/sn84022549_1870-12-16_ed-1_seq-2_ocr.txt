. course wants more. or Joss of the taxes,
paid by tbe people, used for that pur
pose, and tbe other day offered a resolu-

The President's Message.
We gave a summary .of the message
lagl week. That .portion relating to the
sheries attracts perhaps most attention
. and interest, particularly iu England,
and we give it entire as follows :
THE FISHERIES QUESTION.
The course pursued by the Canadian
authorities toward -the .fishermen of the
. United Stated during the past season
has not been marked by a frieudly feel
ing. By the first article of the conven
tion of 1818 between Great Britain and
the United States, it was agreed the in
habitants of the United States should
.have forever, in common with British
subject?, the right of taking fish in the
waters which are therein defined. In
the waters not included in the limits
named in the convention "within three
miles of parts of the British coast" it
has been the custom for many years to
give to intrudiug fishermen,of the Unit
ed Stater a reasonable warning of their
violation of the technical right of Great
Britain. The imperial government is
understood to have delegated the whole
or ashare of its jurisdiction or control
of these iu-shore fisheries' grounds to
the -colonial authority known as the Do
minion of Canada ; and this semi inde
pendent but irresponsible agent has ex
ercised its -delegated powers in an un
friendly way. Vessels have been seized
(without notice or warning, in violation
of the custom previously prevailing, and
have been taken into the Colonial ports,
their voyages broken up aud their ves
sels condemned. There is reason to be
lieve that this unfriendly and vexatious
treatment was designed to bear harshly
upon the hardy fishermen of the Unit
ed States, with a view to political effect
upon this government
The statutes of the Dominion of Can
ada assume a still broader and more un
tenable jurisdiction over tbe vessels of
the United State. They authorize of
ficers or persons to bring vessels hover
ing within three marine miles of any of
the coasts, bays, creeks or harbors of
Canada Into port, to search the cargo, to
examiae the master under oath, to
change the cargo and voyage, and to inr
flict upon him a heavy pecuniary penal
ty if the true answers are not given ; and
if such a vessel is found preparing to
fish within three marine miles of any
such coasts, bays, creeks or harbors, with
out a license, or after the expiration of
the period named in the last license
granted to it, they provide that the ves
sel, with her tackle &c, &., shall be for
feited. It is not known that any condem
nations have been made under this stat
ute. Should the authorities of Canada
attempt to enforce it, it will become my
duty to take such steps as may be nec
essary to protect the rights of the citi
zens of the United States. It has been
claimed by Her Majesty's officer that
the fishing vessels of the United States
have no right to enter the open ports of
the lintish possessions in North Ameri
ca except for tbe purpose of shelter and
repairing damages, of purchasing wood
and obtaining water ; that they have no
right to enter attheBritish custom house
or to trade there except for tbe purchase
of wood and water, and that they must
depart within twenty-four hours after a
notice to leave. It is not known that
any seizure of a fishing vessel carrying
the United States flag has been made
under this claim. So far as the claim is
founded on an alleged construction of
the convention of 1818, it cannot be ac
quiesced in by the United States. It is
Loped that it will not be insisted upon
by Her Majesty's government During
the conferences which preceded the ne
goliation of the convention of 1818. the
British commissioners proposed express
ly toexclude the fishermen of the Uuited
State from the privileges of carrying on
trade with any of Ilia Britannic Majes
ty's subject residing within the limits
assigned for their use, and also that it
should not be lawful for the vessel of
tbe United States engaged in the said
fishery to have on board any foods, wares
or merchandise whatever, except such as
might be necessary for the prosecution
of their voyage to and from said fishing
grounds, and any vessel of the United
States which shall contravene this regu
lation may.be seized, condemned and
confiscated with her cargo. This pro
position, which is identical with the
construction now put upon the language
of the convention, was emphati ally re
jected by tbe American commissioner,
vq4 thereupon was abandoned by the
British plenipotentiary, and Article 1,
as it stand in the convention, was sub
stituted, If, however, it be said that
this claim is founded on provincial, or
colonial statute, and not upon the con
vention, thia government cannot but re
gard it as unfriendly, and in contraven
tion of the spirit, if not of the Jetter, of
the treaty, for the faithful execution of
which the imperial government is alone
responsible.
Anticipating that au attempt may
possible be made by the Cauadiun au
thorities In the oorning season to repeat
their uuneighborly acts toward our fish
ermen, I recommend you to confer upon
the Executive the power to suspend by
proclamation the operation of tho laws
authorizing the transit of goods, wares
and merchandise in bond across the teri-
tory of the Uuited States and Canada ;
and further, should such an extreme
measure be necessary, to suspend the op
eration of any laws whereby the vessels
of the Dominion of Canada are permit
ted to enter the waters of the United
States.
A like unfriendly disposition has been
manifested on the purt of Canada in tbe
maintainancc of a claim to the right to
exclude the citizens of the Uuited States
from the navigation of the St. Lawrence
This river constitutes a naval outlet to
the ocean for eight states, with an aggre
gate population of about 17,600,000 in
habitants and an aggregate tonnage of
6,611,367 tons upon the waters which
discbarge into it. The foreign commerce
of our ports on these waters is open to
British competition, and tbe major part
of it is done in British bottoms. If the
American seamen be excluded from this
national avenue to the ocean, the mo
nopoly of the direct commerce of the
lake ports with tho Atlantic would be in
foreign hands, their vessels on transat
lantic voyages having an access to our
lake ports, which would be deuied to
American vessels in similar voyages. To
state such a proposition is to refute its
justice. During the administration of
Mr. John Quincy Adams, Mr. Clay un
questionably demonstrated the natural
right of the citizens of the United States
to the navigation of this river, claiming
that the act of the Congress of Vienna,
in opening te Rhine and other rivers
to all nations, showed the judgement of
European jurists and statesmen that the
inhabitants of that country through
which a navigable river passes have a
natural right to enjoy the navigation of
that rivertoand into the sea, even though
the territory of another power. This
right does not exclude the coequal right
of the sovereign possessing the territory
through which the river debouches into
the sea to make such regulations rela
tive to the police of the navigation as
may be'reasnnably neccssarv. But these
regu'ations should be framed in a liberal
spirit of comity, and should not impose
needless burdens upon the commerce
which has the right of transit
It has been found in practice more ad
vantageous to arrange these regulations
by mutual agreement, and the United
Stales are ready to make any reasonable
arrangement as to the police of the St.
Lawrence which may be suggested by
Great Britain.
If the claim made by Clay was just
when the population of the states bor
dering on the shores of the lakes was on
ly 3,400,000, to it now derives greater
force and equity from the increased pop
ulation, wealth, production and tonnage
of the states on the Canadian frontiers.
Since Mr. Clay advanced his argument
in behalf of our right, the principle for
which he contended has been frequently
and by various nations, recognized by
law and treaty, and has been extended
to several other great rivers.
By the treaty concluded at Maycnce
in 1831, the Rhine was declared free
from the point where it is first navigable
to the sea. By the convention between
Spain and Portugal, concluded in 1835,
tbe navigation of the Douro throughout
its whole extent was made free for the
subjects of both crowns. In 1853 the
Argentine Confederation by treaty then
opened the free navigation of the Para
guay and Uruguay to the merchant ves
sels of all nations. In 1856 the Crimean
war closed by a treaty which provided
for the free navigation of the Danube.
In 1858 Bolivia, by treaty declared that
it regarded the rivers Amazon and La
Plata, in accordance with fixed princi
pies of national law, as highways or
channels opened by nature for the com
merce of all nations. In 1859 the Para
guay was made free by treaty, and in
December, 1866, tho Emperor of Brazil.

About this time Postmasters may ex
pect to receive circulars offering them
most tempting inducements to "get up
clubs " of subscribers for bogus maga
zines and newspapers. Promi-cs of tne
most lavish kind will bo made to them of

Last year hundreds of postmasters were
placed in a most unpleasant and morti
fying position by leading an ear to the
seductive tale told by the publishers of
the " People s Home Journal," w ho is
sued a circular offering a premium worth
$30 for $15 in subscriptions; and the
consequence has been that the unlucky
subscribers, having received two or three
numbers of the paper, have "gone for"
the postmasters in a way that must after
a few months, have become monotonous,
to say the least of it.

their "confidential" letters off counter

Jews in Rome Set Fkee. By a re

forcibly penned up there by huge iron
gates being closed at nightfall, and rieith-
ingeess or egress permitted by the guard
until the following rooming, are thus

Up to the present time, though many
disabilities were removed, their testimony
was not considered as a valid in any of
law, so that a Cbristain who killed a Jew

Hon. Jons P. Hale. Remembering
the earnest and successful labors of the

read with sadness the following, from N.

seeming to be mainly in and below the
ankle. In opening a door he ia obliged
to use his left hand, chitnging h is cane to
the right. Intellectually Mr. Hale is
vigorous, but thinks he is somewhat im
paired in memory. The rotund, rosy
man of yore is no more, for Mr. Hale is
but the ghost of his former self. His
hair is well silvered, and, altogether, no
former acquaintance would recognize
the man, without some clce to his iden

DR. SCnXXCK A D VIRES COXSTTtfPTTTES
TO GO TO FLORIDA IN WIS TIM.
Haying for the last thtrty-flve years devoted my whole
time and attention to tho study of lung dleas' and von
sumption, 1 feel that I undi-rtttand fully the course that
uplit to bo puntui-d to restore a tulentbly tad csmj of
diseased lunga to healthy soundness. The flrot and nnrnt
important u p is, fur the patient to avoid tiikintrceld;
and the beat of all Dlaeca on this confluent for this pnr-
joaa.tn winter, la Florida, well down in the hute. where
I con recommend. A good hotel is kept there by l'cter
man. Last winter I saw several persons there whoso
lunirt had been badly diseased, but w ho, under the heat
ing infl uence of the climate and niy medicines, were get
ting well.
One hundred miles f&rtherdown the river Is a point
which I would prefer to Talatka, aa the tenipvrature is
more even and the air dry and bracing. VeiUmvtlle and
lintcrprise are located there. 1 should give a decided.
firefurencc to MvUouvllle: It It two miles from river or
nke, and It seems almost Impossible to take cold there.
The tables in Florida mitcht be better, and paiieutscom
plafn at times; hut that Is a good slim, as it Indicates a
return of appetite: and, when this is the case, they guk
erally Increase in flesh, and then the lungs must heal.
Jacksonville, Hlbernia, Ore-n Cove, aud many other
placesin various parts of Florida can be safely recom
mended to consumptives In winter. My reasons for say
Inn so are, that patients aro less liable to take cold there
than where there Is a less evi-n temperature; and It Is
not necessary to say, that, w here a consumptive person
exposes himself to frequent colds, he Is certain to die
shortly: therefore my advice Is, go well down Into the
folate, ont of the reach of prevailing east winds and fogs.
Jacksonville, or almost any other of the localities I have
named, will bcnefllthosewho are troubled with a torpKt
liver, a disordered stomach, deranged bowels, sore throat,
or cough; but, for those whose lungs are diseased, a more
southern point is earnestly recommended.
For fifteen years prior to I was professionally tn
New York, Boston, llaltlmore, and Philadelphia every
week, where I saw aud examined on an average five
hundred patients a week. A practice so extensive, em
bracing every possible phase of lung disease, has enabled
me to understand the disease fully ; and hence my caution
In regtrd to taking cold. A person may take vast quanti
ties of ' Sehenck'a Pulmonic Wyrup, Seaweed Tonic, and
IA andrake Tills,' ' aud yet die if uo does not avoid taking
cold.
In Florida, nearly everybody la using BchencVs Man
drake fills; fr the climate Is more likely to produce
bilious habits than more northern latitudes. Itisawell
establlshed fact, that natives of Florida rarely die of con
sumption, especially those of the southern part. On tho
other hand, in New .England, one-third at least of the
population die of this terrible disease. In the Middle
States, it does not prevail so largely ; still there arc many
thousands of cases there. What a vast percentage of
life would be saved If consumptives were as easily alarm
ed in regard to taking fresh colds as they are about scar
let fever, small-pox, Ac. I but they are not: they take
what they term a littlecold, which they are credulous
enough to believe will wear off tn a few days. They pay
no attention to It; and hence It lays tho foundation for
another and another still, until the lungs axe diseased be
yond all hopo of cure.
My advice to persons whose longs are affected, even
slightly, is tolaylnastockof tchenek's 1'olmonic m-rup,
Schcnckis Seaweed Tonic.and Hcbenck's Mandrake Villn,
and goto Florida. I recommend these particular medi
cines, because I am thoroughly acquainted with their
action. I know, that, where they are used In strict ac
cordance with my directions, they wllldo the work that
Is required. This accomplished, nature will do the rest
The physician who prescribes for cold, cough, or night
sweats, and then advises the patient to walk or ride out
every day, will be sure to have a corpse on bis hands
before long. -
My plan is, to give my three medicines in accordance
With the printed directions, except in some canes where
a freer use of the 31 andrake Piilsis necessary. My object
is, to give tone to tho stomach, to get up a good appe
tite. It isalwaysagood sign when a patient begin to
grow hungry: 1 have hopes of such. Willi a relish for
food, and the gratification of that relhdi, comes good
blood, and with It more flesh, which Is closely followed
bya healing of the lungs, then the cough loosens and
abates, theereeping chills and clammy night sweat no
tions as in more northern latitudes, l'alatka Is s point
.lie temperature is regular, and not subject to tuchvarta
longer prosinuo ana annoy, ana Uie patient gets well,
provided ho avoids taking cold.
.Now, there are many consumptives who have not the
means to go to Florida. The question may be asked. Is
there no hoje for such 't Certainly there is. My advice
to such is, and ever has been, to stay in a warm room
during the winter, with a temperature of about seventy
degrees, which should be keptregitlarly at that point by
mean of a thermometer. Let such a patient Cake his
exercise within the limits of the room by walking up and
down as much as hi strength will permit, in order to
keep up a healthy circulation of the blood. I havo cured
thousands by this system, and can do so again. Con
sumption is v easily cured as any other disease. If it Is
taken in time, and the proper kind of treatment Is par
sued. The fact stands undisputed on record, that
Schenck's Pulmonic Hyrup, Mandrake Tills, and Sea
weed Tonic have cured very many of what seemed to be
hopeless cases of consumption. Go where you will, you
will be almost certain to find some poor consumptive
who has been rescued from the very jaws of death by their
Use.
8o far as the Mandrake Pills are concerned, everybody
should keep a supply of them on hand. They act on the
liver better than calomel, and leave none of its hurtful
effects behind. In fact, they are excellent In all cases
where a purgative medicine Is required. If you have
partaken too freely of fruit, and diarrhoea ensues, a dose
of the Mandrakes will cure you. If you are subject to
sick headache, take a dose of tho Mandrakes, and they
will relieve you in two hours. If you would obviate the
effect of a change of water, or tho too free indulgence In
fruit, take one of the Mandrakes every night, and you
may then drink water, and eat water melons, pea rs, ap-i
pies, plums, peaches, or corn, without the risk of beinff
made sick by thein. Ihey will protect those who live iu

amimatlon with the Keeplrometer will be charged five
dollars. The Kespirometer declares the exact condition
of the lungs; and patients can readily learn whether
they are curable or not. But I desire it distinctly un

In conclusion. I will say, that when persona take my
medicines, and their systems are brought into a healthy
condition thereby, they are not so liable to take cold;
yet no one. with diseased lungs can bear a sudden change
oratmosnhere without the liability of greater or leas Irri
tation of the bronchial tubes.
Full directions in all languages accompany my medi
cines, so explicit and clear that any one can use them
without consulting me, i.nd can be bought from anr
