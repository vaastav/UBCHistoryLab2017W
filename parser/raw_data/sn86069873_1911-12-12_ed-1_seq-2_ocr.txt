The President's Message.
YOV
C
Bio o dine
The only definite thing in President
Taft's message to Congress is his at
tempt; to prove that the f arcial tobac
co trust'decree is a most excellent en
forcement of the Sherman anti-trust
law. He would make the people be
lieve that the tobacco trust decision
practically solves the trust probleip.
He complacently assumes that this
decision is certain at some indefinite
period to restore competition and soft
en the evils of illegal monopoly if it
does not Jndeed completely eradicate
them.
Once again, therefore, the President
is found advocating in a message to
Congress a cause that is not popular
with the people, forthe merest tryo in
the study of trusts recognizes the to
bacco trust "dissolution" as a victory
for that monopoly. That even Wall
street so considers it is evidenced by
the fact that the securities of the to
bacco trust are higher after the "dis
solution" than before.
"The punishment incited apjn the
American Tobacco Company for being
in existence in violation of the law,"
declares Chairman Stanley of the steel
! investigating committee, "is worth
hundreds of millions cf dollars to that
concern. There is not a trust in the
United States or in the world which
would not give millions to b9 'disolv
ed' as it has been dissovled."
And the President devotes his offici
al message to Congress to an attempt
to make it appear that this tobacco
trust decision is a great victory for
the independent tobacco men and the
picple. ZZ
No Man is Stronger
Than His Stomach
A strong man is strong all over. No man can be
strong who is suffering from weak stomach with its
consequent indigestion, or from some other disease
of the stomach and its associated organs, which im
pairs digestion and nutrition. For when the stomach
is weak or diseased there is a loss of the nutrition
contained in food, which is. the source of all physical
strength. When a man "doesn't feel just right,"
nin Uo. (inocn'f dwn w1t Vtotf nn uncomfortable
feeling in the stomach after eating, is languid, nervous, irritable and despond
ent, he is losing the nutrition needed to make strength.
Such a man should use Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery. It cures diseases of the stomach and other s
organs of digestion and nutrition. It enriches theblood,
invigorates the liver, strengthens the kidneys, nqurjsheg
the nerves, and so GIVES HEALTH 2UVD STREXGTH-TO
THE WHOLE BODY.
You can't afford to accept a secret nostrum as a substitute for this non
alcoholic medicine of known composition, not even though the urgent dealer
may thereby make a little bigger profit. Ingredients printed on wrapper.

on the Ctsro ol Catarrh.
"A few years ago -we considered that
we were doing well if we cured tenper

of Catarrh in its various forms brought
to us. Catarrh of the Head, Catarrh
of the Eyes, Catarrh of the Bladder
and Uretha, Catarrh of the large in
testines. Catarrh of the Larynx, Pelvic
Catarrh, Catarrh of the Throat,, and
c;atarrn or tne stomacn are quiciuy
cured with "Bloodine." Itbuildsnew
tissues, gives new energy, new life,
new blood and strength to anv part of
the body attacked by the Catarrhal
germs."
Bloodine is a powerful tonic, nour
ishing food medicine, composed of
valuaole tonic stimulants obtained

contains no narcotics or other danger
ous drugs which merely deaden pain
temporarily, butLve no permanent
relief or cure the cause of your disease.
; "Bloodine is a powerful body builder
and blood maker; it is the best remedy
known to the medical profession to
enrich thin, watery blood and supply
new, rich red blood to the whole body.

A Dreadiul Wound
Holiday Fire Hazards.
Fire insurance hazards multiply
during the holiday season, owing to
special electrical displays, Christmas
trees in stores and show windows, and
a liberal use of cotton snow and other
inflammable decorations. n.very mer
chant should be specially eaieful
about fire hazards at this time, not
only because of the danger of inter
fering with his trade at the most
protfiable season of the year, but be
cause of his responsibility to the pub
lic through endangering the lives of
the holiday throngs. The most serious
hazard at holiday t.imp. is tht Hhrisr- i
mas tree filled with lighted tapers and ;
likely to be overturned, and thefhurried
electric wiring put up for sperial dis
plays. Trees should be intsalled so
that they cannot possibly be overturn
ed, and electric lights should be used
in place of candles. The latter are al
ways dangerous especially after the
tree gets dried out in a warm room.
Electric lighting fires are due almost
invariablyto the practice cf allowing I
employes not familiar with the elec-l
trie hazard to install displays :n show !
windows and other places. The wires
are frequently run over nails, which
wear ott the insulation and start
blazes, cotton batting and tinsel is
allowed to come into contact with
lamps and their (receptacles, and cir
cuits are frequently overloaded by
special displays and thus made danger
ous. The Boards of Underwriters are
glad to pass upon all holiday electric
wiring plans in order to diminish the
losses from fire, and merchants gener
ally should confer with their insurance
men and should be certain that the
electric wiring is done by competent
men. Otherwise they may impair
their fire insurance protection, as the
policies provide that if there is a
material increase in hazard, without
permission, the insurance shall be void.
The holiday season ia a good time lor
merchants to begin to enforce "no
smoking" rules, and to be especially
careful about the prompt removal of
boxes, paper and all inflamable rubbish,

Estimates of the treasury depart
ment for running the government dur
ing the next fiscal year which have
just been submitted to Conrgess, con
template a saving of $21,283,921.43 as
CDmpared with the amount appropriat
el for the fiscal year 1911-12.
This is in contrast to past Republi
can performances. Mark for Jnstance
the following comparative figures
which best tell the story of Repuolican
extravagance :
Annual .appropriations 1890, $340,
000,000 ;1900, $600,000,000; 1909, i.103,
3887,508. Per capital cost of running
government 1890, $6.00 ; 'u1900, $8.00 ;
1909, $12.40.
Why rave the Republicans suddenly
developed symptoms of economy, this
particular year reducing their esti
mates after having regularly increased
their expenditures every year for six
teen years.
The answer is that the Republican
department heads knew extravagant
estimates could not pas3 the security
of the Democratic House.
Notwithstanding their admission
that they will be able to get along for
twenty-one millions less, there has
been no marked complaint from the
Republican officials that they will be
stinted or hampered in their work.
The Democratic leaders made it plain
at the start that the necessary ex
penses of the government were to be
met as usual, but that all unnecessary
items would have to be cut out.
Woman's Earning Powers Same
as Man's.
The Court of Appeals last week
affirmed tne judgment of the Boyd
Circuit Court in the case of the Chesa
peake and Ohio Railroad Company
against Cleotine Ward's administrator
in which the estate of Miss Ward re
ceived a judgment for $12,500 because
the railroad company's engine killed
her in Catlettsburg. The companyjhad
asked for a reversal of the judgment
on the ground that $12,500 was an ex
cessive amount to pay for'the death of
a Bitxeen-year-old girl. Miis Ward wa&
a stenographer and was receiving a
salary of $25 a month.
"While the time was when a man's
er.ning pawer was much larger than a
woman's," said Judge Carroll;, "it is
by no means certain that the great
diapantybetween their earning power
will continue for any length of time."

Another political bombshell was
ploded at the White House a few days
ago sccoiding to a dispatch from
Washington. It was not quite so noisy,
and perhaps not so serious in its
effects as the one set off in Ohio by
State Chairman Brown last week, hut
it was enough to cause a shock.
It was in the statement (f Repre
sentative Frank B. Willis, of the
Eighth Ohio District, to the effect that
as he sees the situation in that section
of the State which he represents in
Congress it is in opinion doubtful if
tne resident couia carry a single one
of the six counties comprising it.
These counties fare . Delaware, Cham
paign, Hanccck, Logan, Union and
Hardin.
Mr. Willis did not make this state
ment at the White House himself, but
it was repeated there by former State
Senator Duval, who has had several
conferences at the White House. The
natural interpretation placed by J
friends of the Administration upon
Mr. Willis' statement was that for
some reason he had become unfriendly
to the President, but this Mr. Willis
