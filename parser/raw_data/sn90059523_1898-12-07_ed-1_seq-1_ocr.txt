PARIS, Dec. 6. —The peace treaty of
Paris is practically an accomplished |
fact. Today's session disposed of the
essential features of the treaty, which
■will be embodied in the following eight
articles:
First —The customary preface of treaties,
in the nature of an expression of amity and
hope for perpetual peace.
Second—The relinquishment by Spain at her
sovereignty over Cuba.

SIGN THE TREATY.
President's Instructions to Amer-
Ican I'oaee Commissioners.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. — Advices
from Paris to the effect that it might
be reasonably presumed that the peace
commissioners will be ready to sign
a treaty of peace within a day or two
are fully confirmed here. It is learned
that the president's instructions to
Judge Day were to hasten the con
clusion, and to that end the American
commissioners have been authorized to
limit the treaty closely to protocol
points, leaving other matters, such as
the acquisition of cable stations and
naval stations, to be dealt with here
after. As such separation of the points
is entirely in line with the expressed
desire of the Spanish commissioners,
there appears to be no reason, now that
an agreement has been reached as to
all of the protocol points, why those
should not immediately be reduced to
the form In which it is desired they
should appear In a treaty and be at
once signed by the commissioners. In
this case it Is possible that the treaty
of peace may be submitted to congress
even before the Christmas recess. It
is believed that it will make toward a
speedy treatment of the points of the
protocol.
As to the other points which our com
missioners were instructed to negotiate
upon, they may or may not be disposed
of at Paris by the present commission
ers, but the Indications are now that
they will be left to adjustment in the
future by the ordinary methods of di
plomacy, the Spanish government be
ing under no compulsion whatever,
save such as may be exercised by the
Spanish people who may suffer from
the lack of proper treaty safeguards
to regulate commerce between Spain
and the United States. Perhaps con
sideration for this threatened evil will
lead the Spanish commissioners to con
sent to an inclusion in the peace treaty
of a clause providing for a renewal of
the old treaties of commerce and
comity, and extradition, at least tem
porarily, until other treaties can be
agreed upon to take their place. If
this should not be the case, however,
there will not be an entire stoppage
of trad.p between the two countries, but
American merchants will suffer from
the imposition of the maximum tariff
in Spanish ports, and many other petty
charg-es which will amount to consider
able discrimination against them, while
the United States statutes already con
tain clauses that might operate against
the Spanish merchants In the same
manner, if not In the same degree.
QUEENLY WOMEN MEET.
Wife of Senator Davis, of Minne
sota. Visits Ex-Empress Evffenie.
PATHS, Dec. 6.—^Mrs. Cushman K.
Davis, wife of the United States peace
commissioner and senator, had an in
teresting interview today with ex-Em
press Eugenic, who is living incognito
at the hotel where the United States
peace commissioners are residing,while
on one of her periodical visits to Paris.
The senator's wife left her card as a
formality. The ex-empress promptly
sent an attendant to request Mrs. Da
vis to call In person. The latter com
plied and was received, she said after
ward, by a stately, white-haired, sad
faced woman, having little of the ap
pearance of the invalid which the pub-
He supposes her to be. The ex-emprest»
6ecmed to be pleased at being address
ed as "your majesty," and said she
had the deepest regard for the Ameri
cans, "because for my escape from
Paris at a perilous tlrne I was chiefly
Indebted to an American," the refer
ence being, of course, to the late Dr.
Evans.
Although Mrs. Davis Btudiously
avoided mentioning the American-His
pano war, remembering that the ex
empress is a Spaniard, the latter
broached the topic, saying:
"After the destruction of the Maine
war was inevitable, although I do not
believe any Spaniard was responsible
for that calamity. I am sure any na
tion would have done, under the cir
cumstances, as the United States did."
Mrs. Davis, on retiring, kissed her
hand. The ex-empress seemed deeply
touched and exclaimed: "I am most
grateful."
MAY BE TABLED.
Report in tlie Senator Hui-Ue Dis
barment Frweedingß.
CLEVELAND, 0., Dec. 6.—lt seems
now very probable that the report of
the trial committee of the Cleveland
Bar association, in the proceedings
against State Senator Burke, will be
tabled indefinitely at the meeting of
the association next Saturday. It Is
said that both the friends of Senator
Burke and Judge Dellenbaugh are In
favor of disposing of the verdict in that
manner. It is claimed by many lead-
Ing attorneys that the report is obvi
ously unfair so far as it relates to Del
lenbaugh, inasmuch as the judge was
not on trial and was not given an op
portunity to defend himself at the hear
ing.
AT $10_PER FISH.
Delightful Time in Prospect for
Andrew Johnson, Fisherman.
RE© "WING, Minn., Dec. 6.—(Special.)
—Andrew Johnson, a fisherman, at
tempted to send two barrels of fish to
the Maryland Packing company, Dcs
Moines. A deputy game warden seized
them at the express office. The state
law imposes a fine of $10 on each fish;
and as nearly 1,000 fish were confiscated
the shipment may prove expensive.
HEROES OFJTHE MAINE.

navy to erect a monument In Havana,
Cuba, to the memory of the Bailors and
marines who lost their lives by the ex
plcsion of the Maine. The bill Is rec
ommended by the navy department.

SENATOR VIQST SOUNDS THE FIRST
WARNING AGAINST THE EX
PANSION IDEA
HE OBJECTS TO MILITARISM
Says It Would Be Better for Amer
icans to First Turn Their Atten
tion to Acquisition of Ships of
Colmmerce, Rather Than Ma
chines of War—Dislikes Ceas
ing: to Be a Nation o>f Traders.
WASHINGTON, Dec 6.—The first
note of the aniti-ex.par.&ionists was
founded in the senate today, by Sena
tor Vest, of Missouri, who introduced
the following- Joint resolution:
"That under the constitution of the United
States no power is given to the federal gov
ernment to acauire territory to be held and
governed permanently as colonies.
"The colonial system of European nations
cannot be established under our present con
stitution; but all territory acquired by the
government, except such small amount as
may be necessary for coaling stations, correc
tion of boundaries and srtiuilar governmental
purposes, must be acquired and governed
with the purpose of ultimately organizing
such territories into states suitable for ad
mission into the Union."
A brief discussion of the navigation
laws was precipitated by the considera
tion of a bill amending those laws by
the addition of a provision that foreign
built vessels, wrecked in the United
States, purchased by citizens of this
country and repaired to the extent of
three-fourths of their value shall be
subject t3 forfeiture If they engage sub
sequently in the coastwise trade of the
United States.
Mr. Vast, a member of the connmlttee
on commerce, expressed Ma opposition
to the bill, principally because lit af
forded protection to the coastwise trad 9
which needed no protection. Cur gen
ea-al carryingl trade, Mr. Vest believed,
needed protection. Under the present
system of navigation laws, this trade
had decreased from 75 per cent to 11
per cent, and this country is now pay-
Ing $150,000,000 annually to foreign ship
owners for carryingl trade that ought
to be carried in American bottoms.
This condition of affairs, Mr. Vest de
clared, was "a scandal and disgrace."
lie said he had been amused at the
suggestion of the president, made in
his message, submlttted yesterday, that
our carrying trade be encouraged by
the payment of subsidies.
"In othor wca-dis," said he, "it is pro
posed to substitute for the present vic
ious system of navigation Laws a
scheme of subsidies that Is even more
vicious than is the evil it proposes to
remedy. Under the proposed policy of
the administration," continued Mr.
Vest, "we are to build a great navy.
We are to cease to be a nation of trad
ers, and, under the impulse of the
policy of expansion, become a nation of
warriors. It would seem to me better
first to build up our carrying trade.
I would also let our people, through the
beneficent effects of such trade, buy
r.here they can buy cheapest."
Mr. Caffery, of Douisiana, wlho is a
member of the committee on, commerce,
opposed the bill. Finally it was made a
special order for next Monday.
At 1:80 p. m. the senate adjourned.

EL PASO, Deo. 6.—A private dispatch from

C'asualtlCM Elevator Had Just
Been Inspected.
NEW YORK, Dec. 6.—An accident to
the elevator In tho eleven-story build
ing a/t Pine amd William streets t occu
pied by the United State 3 Fire Insur
ance company, today, resulted in the
death of one of the company's direc
tors; the fatal Injury of another direc
tor, and the serious injury of a third
insurance man. Several mem'b-srs of
the direotorate of the United States
Fire Insurance company, were in the
elevator at the time of the crash, to
gether with other parties, and miracul
ously escaped.
Walter Hayden Griffin, secretary and
director of the company, was instantly
killed.
Thomas w. Caldwell, of Mbrrlstown,
N. J., also a director of the oompany,
received a. compound fracture of the
skull, and is not expected to leave.
George H. Smith, head of the firm of
Smith & Hicks, fire underwriters, was
injured about the head and body.
It is not definitely known whether
the elevator fell first from one of the
upper floors, or whether the superstruc
ture saxppartlng the elevator fell on top
of it, from the roof of the building.
There was a jarring sound, and than a
crash. The caible snapped and the
counterweights, half a dozen in num
ber, and weighing from sixty to seventy
pounds each, de&cended, bounding from
side to side of the shaft. They crashed
through the roof of the car. One of
them struck Secretary Griffin on the
head, crushing it In. Another struck
Director Caldwell a glancing- blow on
the back of the head, fracturing the
skull and exposing the brain. Under
writer Smith was struck by the torn
cables and debria
The elevator man, Dennis Sullivan,
had presence of mind enough to throw
open the lower gate just as the first
crash came, and the other passengers
in the ear were able to get out of the
cage in time to save themselves. After
the aocident Sullivan was arrested and
held, awaiting- the action of the coroner.
It appears from statements made by
Manager Belknap, of the Otis Elevator
oompany, and from others in the build
ing, that this elevator had been inspect
ed ten minutes before the accident oc
curred, and was pronounced absolutely
safe.
Manager Be]knap could not advance
any theory as to the cause of the acci
dent.

sion Unknown, as Great Care
Had Been Taken.
BOSTON, Dec. 6.--Four men wera
killed and several severely Injured at
Fort Independence, on Castle island,
in Boston harbor, this afternoon by tho
explosion of a mine which had been
removed from the channel by a diver.
The dead, are: Sergeant Morris Mo-
Grath; Hiram Vaughn, private; Bren
nan, a diver; Ryan, a citizen.
The men were engaged in carting
the mine from the shore to the interior
of the island. The three men, Vaughn,
Brennan and Ryan, had placed the
mine on the team, and started to take
it to the place where the other ammu
nition was stored. The road along
which they passed was unusually
smooth, having been constructed with
a view to the necessity of care in
transporting explosive material. Sud
denly, and without warning, the mine
burst. The horse and cart and the
three men were blown to fragments.
Sergeant McGrath was standing fully
twenty feet away. He was instantly
killed by concussion. Kls body does
not bear a mark Gf any sort.
As soon as possible after the explo
sion a careful search was begun by
Lieut. Raymond, who had charge
of removing the mines, Hbut not a frag
ment of men or clothing could be
found.
Lieut. Raymond states that he can
not explain how the explosion occurred.
He says that since the order was is
sued from Washington hundreds of
mines have been handled in precisely
the same way as this one, and trans
ported over the same road.
Ryan was a civilian and was assist
ing in the work. Vaughn was a mem
ber of the engineer corps. He had only
two weeks more to serve, when he ex
pected to be transferred to the naval
college to take a course in naval con
struction. Sergeant McGrath was the
telegrapher of the island.

Headquarters of (he Army, Washington, D.
C, Dec. s.—The Honorable Secretary of War
—Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith
the draft of a bill for the reorganization
of the United States army, btused on a
strength of one soldier to I.C-00 of the popu
lation of the United States, and two soldieri
to I.CCO of the population in the dependent
colonic-iv—approximately 100,000 men. My
recommendations are for what I believe to
be for the best interests of the government,
not only for the present, but a3 far a* I
am nble to see for the future. The recom
mendations havo been made regardless of the
personal consideration of any officer cr sol
dier now connected with tho military service.

fantry la in accordance with the immediate
necessities cf the United States. We have
4,000 miles of coast, with 27 principal harbors,
where are located millions of Deonlc and
property of almost Inestimable value. That
they should properly be defended is demand
ed by every consideration of prudence and
■good administration. In addition to this, ;
wo have the important harbora in Porto It'co,
Cuba and the Philippines to defend, requiring
a large force of artillery.
The organization recommended Is euch as
to give an army In proportion to the im
portant duties and great responsibilities re-<!
quired of the different officers in our serv
ice, and is similar to the organization which,
has been found most efficient In the armies
of all other civilized nation's, and also t»
that which was found to be most effective in,
the Confederate army between the years IB6i
-ISG3. A slmliar organization has been reoonv«
mended by Gen. Sherman and Lieut. Gea.
Schofield.
I earnestly recommend for your considers,
