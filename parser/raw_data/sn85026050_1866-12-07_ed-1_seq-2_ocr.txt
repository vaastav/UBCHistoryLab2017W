MEETING OF CONGRESS.
V- The second session of the Thirty-Ninth
Congress Assembled last Monday, and
: an organization of both ' Houses was
effected the same day. The Message of the
President was delivered on Tuesday. The
subject of regulating and . limiting the
pardoning power as exercised by the Ex
ecutive is about the only important topic
yet discussed. AVe shall give each week
a summary of the proceedings.
THE MESSAGE.
We print this week the annual message
to Congress of the President of the Uni
ted States. It is of moderate length,
therefore every one will be likely to read
it The document is tame and dreary,
scarcely rising to common-place. It in
dulges in no bravado, and has no salient
. points. The greater portion is devoted to
the reconstruction question, and is made
up of diluted doses of "bit policy." It
entirely ignores the verdict of the . people
rendered with euch unanimity in the late
elections, that guaranties for the future
shall be given by the rebellious states be
fore their political rehabilitation and insists
upon their immediate and unqualified re
' storation. This is a touch of Rip Van
. Winkleism in politics that is more amus
ing than otherwise, in the light of the fact
t'lat the eople have buried "my olicy
beyond the hope of resurrection under
the overwhelming weight of their votes
' The rest of the message consists of a not
very lucid summa.j of the Mexican and
Fenian questions, with incidental allu
sions to our foreign relations, and a syn
opsis of the reports of the Heads of De-
' partments. Take it altogether, and the
message is a tame afterpiece to the roaring
farce which the President performed while
swinging around the circle."
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR.
The report of the Secretary of War
Kuows that few volunteers now remain in
the service, and they are being discharged
. as rapidly as they can be replaced by reg
ular troops. Sufficient war material to
meet any emergency has been retained,
and, from th9 disbanded volunteers stand
ing ready to respond to the national call,
large armies can be rapidly organized.
equipped, andjeoncentrated. ' Fortifies-
tions on the coast and frontier have receiv
ed, or are being prepared for more powei
. ful armaments; lake surveys and harlor
aud river improvements are in . course of
energetic prosecution. Preparations have
been made for the payment of the add!
tional bounties authorized during the re
cent session of Congress, under such reg
. ulations as will protect the Governiiieti
from fraud, and secure to the- honorably
discharged soldier the well-earned reward
of his faithfulness and gallantry. " More
than six thousand maimed soldiers have
received artificial limbs or other surgical
. apparatus; and forty-one national ceme
' teries, containing the remains of 104,526
Union soldiers, have already been estab
lished. ' The total estimate of military
appropriations is $25,105,609.
REPORT OF THE POSTMASTER GEN.
The expenditures of this Department
during the past year have exceeded the
receipts $265,093, a very small deficiency,
The mail service has been extended in the
South rapidly, and will soon afford-the
people there the' facilities enjoyed before
the war. An arrangement has been made
with the Post Oflice Department of Great
Britain which contemplates a reduction of
international letter postage to one-half the
existing rates. On the 30th of Juno hist.
there were in operation 6,930 mail routes,
with an aggregate length of 180,921 mjles,
and au aggregate annual cost of $8,410,'
184. The length of railroad routes is 32,
092 miles; steamboat routes 14,346 milesT
REPORT SECRETARY OF THE
NAVY.
The naval force at this time consists of
two hundred and seventy-eight vessels,
armed with two thousand three hundred
aud fifty-one guns. Of these, one hun
dred and htteen vessels, carrying one
thousand and twenty-nine guns, are
commission, distributed chietly among
seven sjnaJrous. The number of men in
service is thirteen thousand six hundred.
The expenditures of the department for
the fiscal year ending 30th of June !last
were $43,324,526, and the estimate for
the coining year amount to $23,5G8,436.
LIBERATED ROME.
The Frenchtroops have been withdrawn
from Rome, and are now on their home
ward march. Victor Emanuel will estab
lish the capital of the Kingdom of Italy
at the Eternal City. The Pope is thus
left without temporal power. . It may be
that he will accept the offer of the Queen
of Spain, and remove his headquarters to
that country where further troubles will
overtake him, as eveu there the sway of
Catholic monarchy is rapidly drawing. to
a close.
LIBERATED ROME. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
INTERIOR.
Since the beneficent homestead law has
been in operation, the revenue derived by
the Government from the sale of publ
lands has not amounted to much, com
paratively. During the last fiscal year, 4,
629,312 acres have been disposed of of
which 1,892,516 acres were entered under
the homestead act.
ARREST OF JOHN H. SURRAT.
The cable telegrams announce the re-
- arrest in Egypt of John 1L Surrat, one
of the participators in the assassination
tragedy. Sometime ago' he Was discover
ed and arrested in the ranks of the Papal
army in Rome, but escaped and fW to

themselves had been asked to take part in tne
hiirh function of amending the Constitution.

can slavery is one C the legitimate results ol
our intcmtcine ttruggie.
ADMISSION OF CONGRESSMEN FROM THE REBEL.
STATES.
Having .i.roirresed thus far, , the Executive
Denartineut found that it had accomplished
nearly all that was within the scope of its con-
stituiionai auiooruy. iuinK, "w, jn
remained to be done oeiore ine worxoi rostpra-
tion could be completed, and that was the ad-
mission to Coneress of loval Senators and Rep.
rexentatives from the otates wnose peopie Had
rebelled against the lawful authority of the
General Government. This questiendevolved
upon the respective Houses, which, by the con
stitution, are madet the judges of . tie election,
returns, and .qualifications of their own mem
bers; and its consideration at once engaged the
attention of Congress. '
ACTION OF THE EXECUTIVE.
In the meant'me, the Executive Department
no other plau having been proposed by Oon.

nraclieihle, the rosier itinn of the proper re'a.

seeniefl to rcquiic, t. le ptu cisi, rKvenur, biiu
pou.l systems of the couutry. With the advice
and conseut of the Senate, the necessary officers
were appointed, and appropriations made by
Congress for the pay mcnt of I heir saieries. The
propositions toainend tho Federal Constitution,
so ax to nreveut the exutencc of slavery within
the United Stales or any place subject to their
jurisdiction, was ra'i'iod by tbe requisite num
ber of States; nd on the liMi day of Decem
ber. 1665. it wasoffc ally declared to lave be
come valid as a part, of the Constitution of the
United States. Allot the States in wnicn tne

proceeded tn g od laitn, to tne rnactmeui 01
measures for llit protection and amelioration of
the condition of the colored race. Congress,
however, vet hesitated to admit any of these
mates torf presentation; and it was not until
towards The close of the eighth month of the
session that an exception was trade in fnvor of
Tennessee, by the admisssion of her Senators

REBEL STARS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS CONQUERED
TERRITORIES.
It is true, it has been assumed that the exis
tence of these States was terminated by the re
bellious-acts of their inhabitants, and that the
insurrection having been suppressed, they were
thenceforward to be considered merely as con
quered territories. Tbe Legislative, Executive
and Judicial Departments of tbe Government
have, however, with great distinctness and uni

appareut that these ten political communisies
are nothing less than steles. of the Union. At
Uie very commencement of the rebellion, each
house declared, with a unanimity as remarka
ble as it was significant, that the war was not
"waged, upon our part in any spirit of oppres
sion, nor for any purpose of conquest or .subju
gation, n r purpose ol overthrowing or inter
fering with the rights of established institu
tions ofihoH Slates, but to defend and maintain
the supremacy of the Constitution and all laws
made in pursuance thereof, aud to preserve the
r '.v. -n.i, a.. ;, ..oi; j
Union with allthe dignity, equality, and rights
of the several States unimpaired; and that as
soon as these objects'.' we:e "accomplished the
waroughttocca.se." Iu some instances, Sen
ators, were periuitled to Contiuue their legisla
tive functions, wnue in oilier instances nepre-

Congress, by the act of March 4, 1862, and by
theannorlioume::! of representation thereunder,
also recognized their presence as States in the
Union; and they have, for judicial purposes,
wn divided into districts, as States alone can
be divided. - The, same recognition appears
the receut legislation in reiereuca to Tennessee,
which evidently rests u pun the fact that the
fri of the State were not destroved by
the rebellion, but merely suspended,- and that
principle is of course applicable to those States

their places in the Union. .

IMMIGRATION OF FREEDMEN.
Thc
Executive, werned, of an attempt
gpanjfl, American adventurer to induce
emigration of freedmen of the United States
a foreign country, protested against the project
as one which, if consumated. would reduce them
I to a rjonuage .; yrr
ment of the Stale in which the plan was ma
tured, that the proceeeing will meet neither it
encouragement nor approval. It is a question
worthy of your consideration, wnemerour iawe
upon this subject are adequate to the prevention
or punishmeut of the crime thus meditated.
MEXICAN AFFAIRS.
In the month of April last, as Congress if
aware, a friendly arrangement was mane be
tween the Emperor of trarce anil tne i resi
dent of the United States for the withdrawal
from Mexico of the French expeditionary mili
tary forces. This withdrawal was to be effect
ed in three detachments, the first of which, it
was understood, would leave Mexico in Novem
ber, now past, the second in March, next, and
the third and last in November, 1867. Imme
diately upon the completion of the evacuation,
the French uovernment was to assume me ramc
attitude of non-intervention, in regard to Mex
ico, as is held by the Government of the. Uni
ted States. Repeated assurances have been
given by the Emperor, since that agreement,
that he would complete tne prom is eutim
tion within the time mentioned, or sooner.
It was reasonably expected that the proceed

forward, on the 9th day of November last, to
assume his proper functions as Minister Pleni
potentiary of the United States to that Repub

should be attended in the vicinity of Mexico
by the Lieutenant General of the Army oi me

information as might be important to determine
the course to be pursued by the United Slates

the Emperor of France had some time before
dee ded not to withdraw a detachment of his
fnrrps in the month of November past, accord
inir tn entrapment, but that this decisiori was
made with the purpose of withdrawing the
whole of those iorces in ine ensuing .npnug.
Of this determination, however, the United
States had not received any notice or informa

ceived by the Government, care was taken to
make known US dissent to tne x-mperor ui
France. -

INTERNAL INDEMNITY.
A claim of a citizen of the United Sta'es for
indemnity for spoliations committted on the
hiirh seas bv the French authorities, in the ex
ercise of a belligerent power against Mexico, has
been met by the Government ol franco witn a
nrnnnaition to defer settlement until a mutual
convention for the adjustment of all claims of
citizens and subjects ol notn countries, ansinc
outpf the r cent wars on the continent, shall
be agreed upon by the two countries, lhe

THE ANGLO-REBEL PIRATES.
It is a matter of regret that no considerable
advance has been made towards an adjustment
of the difference between the United States and
Great Britain, arising out of tbe depredations
upon our national commerce and other tn spas
ses committed during our civil war. by British
snbieetH. in violation of international law and
treat v oblieations. The delay, however, may
be believed to have resulted in no small degree
from the domestic situation ot Great Kntain.
An entire change of ministry occurred in that
ronntry during the last session of Parliament.
The attention oi the new ministry was caiiea to
the subject at an early day, and there is some
r ... , . l i i i i
reason to expect mat it win now ue cunsiuerea
in a becoming and friendly spirit. The impor
tance of an early disposition of the question
cannot be exaggerated. Whatever might be
the wishes of the two Governments, it is mani
fest that good-will and friendship between the
two countries cannot be estaoiisnea until a re.
ciprocity, in the practice of good faith and neu
triality should be restored between the repec
THE FENIANS.
of
On the 6th of June last, in violation of our
neutrality laws, a military expedition and en
terprise arrainst the British North Ameaican
Colonies was projected and attempted to be
carried on within the territory and jurisdiction
of the United States, in obedience to tbe obli
ration imposed upon the Executive by the Con
stitution, to see that the laws are faithfully exe
cuted, all citizens were warned, by proclama
tion, against taking part in or aiding such on
lawful nroceedines, and the proper civil, mili
tarv and naval officers were directed to take
all necessary measures for the enforcement
the laws. The expedition failed, but it has not
been without its ramful consequences, Some
nf nnr citizens who. it was alleged, were enga.
ged in the expeditim, were captured, and have
been brougnt to iri8l,a turn capi'tu uui-uie, m
the Province of Uanada. Judgment an
sentence of death have been pronounced against
some, whileotherg have been acquitted. Fully
believing in the maxim of government, tba
severitv of civil punishment for misguided per
sons who have engaged in revolutionary at.
temnts which have disastrously failed, is un
seuud and unwise, such representations hav
heen made to tbe British Government, in lie.
half of the convicted persons, as, being sustained
bv an enliehtened and humane judgement, will,
it is honed, induce in their cases an exercise
c.leinencv and a judicious amnesty to all wh
were engaged in the movement. Counsel has
been employed by the .Government to defend
citizens of the United States on trial for capital
offences in Canada, and a discontinuance of the
prosecutions which were instituted in the courts
of the United Statest against those who took
part in tbe expedition, has been directed.
T have regarded the expedition as not only
political in its nature, but as also in a great
measure foreign from the United States in its
causes, character, and objects. The attempt was
understood to be made in sympathy witn an
insurgent paity in Ireland, and, by striking
a Rritish Province on this Continent, w
designated to aid in obtaining redress for poli
ical jrrievances which, it was assnmcd, the peo.
pie of Ireland had suffered at the hands of the
British Government during a period of several
centuries. The persons engaged in it were
ehieflv natives of that country, some of whom
had. while others had not, become citizens
thn United States untler our general laws
naturalization. , Complaints of misgovernment
Ireland continually engage the attention
tho British nation, and so great an agitation
nnw nrevailiner in Ireland that the British Gov
ernmc.nt have deemed it necessary to suspend
the writ of habeat corpus in that country. These
circumstances must necessarily modify the
opinion which we might otherwise have enter
tained in regard to an expedition expressly pro.
hihiied bv our neutrality laws. So long ai
tbose remain upon our statute hooks, they
should be faithfully executed, and if they oper
ate harshly, unjustly, or oppressively, Uon
greFS alone can apply the remedy, by thei
modification or repeal.
RIGHTS OF NATURALIZED CITIZENS.
in
of
1
to
by
The Government has claimed for all persons
not convicted, or accused, or suspected of crime,
an absolute political right of self-expatriation
and a choice of new national allegiance. Mo
of the European States have dissented from th
principle, and have claimed a right to hold such
ot their suojecis as uav lumiigmicu io anc
been natnralized in the Uni'ed States, andaf'er
wards returned on transient visits to their na.
tive countries, to the performances of military
service in like manner as resilient subjects.
Comnlaints arising from the claim in this re
spect made by foreign States, ha ve heretofore
. .. e . l.i . i. TV -
been matters ot cuniriTojr iiwtn ine uni
ted States and some of the European Powers,
and the irritation consequent upon the failure
to settle this question increased during the war
in which Prusia, Italy aud Austria were re
cently engaged. While great Britain has never
acknowledged the right of expatriation, she has
not practically - insisted upon it, France has
been equally forbcarine; ami Prussia has pro
posed a compromise, which, althongh evincing
increased liberality, has not been accepted by
the United States. Peace is now prevailing
everywhere in Europe, and the present seems
to be a favorable time for an assertion by Con
press of the principle, so long maintained by thc
Executive Department, that naturalization by
one State fully exempts the native-horn subject
of any other Slate from the performance of ruil
litary service tinder any foreign government,
long as he does not voluntarily renounce
rights and benefits.
CONCLUSION.
In the performance of a duty imposf d upon
me by the Constitution, I have thus submittf
to the Representatives of the States and of tbe
PoatOh such information of our domestic and
uire. Our uovernn cm is now undergoing its
most trying nrdinl, in 1 my earnest prayer is,
that the peril may lw mccessfuily and finally
pas e 1, n ltliout impairing its original strength
and symmetry, The interests of the nation are
best to be promoted by the revival ol fraternal
relatiqns, the complete obliteration of our past
difference, and the re-inauguration of all the
pursuits of pence. Directing our efforts to tbe
early scroinplishuient of these great ends, let us
endeavor to pres rve harmony between the co
ordinate Departments of the Government, that
each in its proper sphere may cordially co-oper
ate with the other in securing the maintenance
f the Constitution, tbe preservation of tbe
Union, and the perpetuity of our free institu

to scire their own interests.'

interest to read tkeee thirty timet. If you are healthy
is presumed you wish to oonttnue so. Jf sick, of course
you desire to be relieved. In either ease it is important

safest, surest and best tonic and alterative ever advertis
ed in any country. This is a period of the year when
the strongest need an invigorant.

strength which unassisted Nature denies them. All
who are thus circumstanced are Invited to give the Rtt-
tets a trial. Before thfy hive taken tbe elixir three
