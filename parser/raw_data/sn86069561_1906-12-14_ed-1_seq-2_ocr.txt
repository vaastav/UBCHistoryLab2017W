Kentucky Jamestown Exposition
Commission Calls For Popular
Subscriptions to Fund
A wellattended meeting of the
Kentucky Jamestown Exposition
Commission was held last Wednes
day at the headquarters of the Com
mission in Louisville The meet j
ing was called by Col J Stoddard
fohnston president for the pur
pose of devising ways and means to
4 continue the campaign for popular
subscriptions to the Kentucky
Building and Exhibit fund
Citizens from every section of
the State have been responding to
the call for funds but as it will
require not less than 40000 to
erect a building and make a proper
aisplay covering the products and
resources of the State the Commis
sion is still a long way from the
desired goal Less than five
months remain before the open
ing of the Expositiou and with tle
stupendous amount of work ahead
it is necessary that the subscrip
tions be received ac an early date
Direct appeals have already been
made to those friends of State de
velopment who showed an inerest
by subscribing to the Kentucky
Exhibit fund for the St Louis
Worlds Fair of 1904 and now a
campaign will be carried or which I
will cover every class of business
and so far as possible every indi
vidual in the State A plea for
popular subscriptions throughout
Kentucky is made It is the wish
of the Commission that 100000
may appear on the subscription
I
books Therefore no subscription
is too small to be of value
The Commission invites every
citizen of the State to give an ex
pression of substantial interest in
this movement C C Ousley
secretary 204 Commercial Build I
ing Louisville is authorised by
the Commission to receive all sub
scriptions The general public is
urged to send contributions direct
ly to him and the receipt of the
Treasurer for the amount of sub
scribed will be promptly forwarded
In cases where it is not desired to
make a cash subscription the
Commission is anxious that those
willing to give notify the secreta
ry by mail ot the amount of their
subscription naming a futcre date
lor payment All payments should
be made on or before Feb i 1907
Attention has heretofore been
called to the manner in which the
money will be spent The Com
missioners are giving their services
en terly gratuitously to the work
and every cent subscribed will be
devoted to the erection ofa Ken
tucky Building and the collection
transportation installation and
maintenance of an exhibit from
this State
At Wednesdays meeting consi
erable progress along the various
lines o endeavor was reported by
Commissioners The mineral ag
riculture aHd oreslsY exhibits from
this Slate promise to prove more
interesting than At any previous
C 9t
Worlds Fair although the e hifJl
its may not be built on so large a I
scale as heretofore It is the in
tention of the Commission mI
I er to make every department a
i model of completeness The his
torical department will doubtless
doubtless1be
be the most interesting this State 1
hat ever sent to an Exposition
Many proffers of valuable histori
cal souveniors have already been
made to the Commision
A committee was authorized to
isit Jamestown once and select
he building site for Kentucky and
Iso secure the necessary space for
xhibits in various Exposition

I
I Washington Dec 12Ia executive
I session the senate mustered up enough
courage to anum rate solemnly a new
Declaiation of Independence It will
wiiiI
did the document which signalized the
separation of the colonies from Eng
i land 130 years ago nor is anything
like the vital principle involved In
effect it wz 3 a notice to the presideit
that he must consider the senate as
the more important half of one of the
coordinate branches of the govern
t ment and not treat it as a body whose
I
existence is a mere incident to his con
v6nience It must have taken consid
I
erable nerve to take such a boldstep
inasmuch as the senate was half an
I
hour in reachinc its decision but when
I
one recalls that its spirit has been con
I siderably broken by the occupant of
j the white hoase during the last four
years it might be regarded as a really
1 daring thing to do
I The senate resolved to say to the
president We insist on your being
more definite in the matter of nomina
tions which you send to us if you
are not we will hold up the confirma
I
tion of several important appoint
ments This resolution was reached
I after a large number of subordinate
nominations had been confirmed and
just about the time it was expected
the question of confirming several cab
inet appointments would be taken up
When consideration was about to be
resumed of the case of Secretary of
the Navy Bonaparte who has been
appointed attorney general to succeed
Sir Moody some senator asked wheth
er the senate had any knowledge when
the various changes in the cabinet
were to take effect
Signal for Discussion
This was the signal for a somewhat
general discussion on the subject of
the prospective changes in the cabinet
Were it hot for the newspapers the
senate would have no information as I
to the program of the president The I
senate is cognizant furthermore that
Commissioner of Corporations James
R Garfield is slated to succeed Sec
retary of the Interior Hitchcock but
were it not for the newspapers the
senators would not know it is the
presidents idea to make this change
March next
Therefore it was resolved that in
asmuch as the senate under the con
stitution is virtually onehulf of the
appointing power the president should
be require to explain in his official
capacity just what his pragram is In
the meantime the action on the nomi
nations will bs deferred
Possibly the country will be amazed
at the defiant attitude assumed by the
coincript fathers but they have been
waiting for an opportunity to demon
strate that they are in a rebellious
mood ginst what they have long con
sidered tlic < domineering disposition of
the president
