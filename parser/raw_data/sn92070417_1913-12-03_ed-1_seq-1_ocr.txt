ABANDONING THEIR COMMANDS

Disintegrating With Deadly Certainty

Washington, Dec. 3. The flight of
Huerta's generals in northern Mexico,
lederal evacuation of Chihuahua and
Guaymas and the refusal of Mexican
oil companies to furnish fuel for
movement of federal troop ' trains,
were pointed out by officials here to
day as such events to which President
. Wilson referred In his message to
congress yesterday when he declared
the, Huerta regime was crumbling
"little by little every flay."
Diplomatically there have been no
developments. President Wilson's
etatement that this1 government would
not, in his opinion, be obliged to al
ter Its policy of "watchfurt waiting"
was regarded as forecasting a (period
of passive observation, with every eye
of the government exercising at the
same time a close scrutiny on the
safeguarding of foreigners and their
property. Some diplomatists were
inclined to see in President Wilson's
expression of hopefulness that when
Huerta has been forced from power,
after which order will be restored
by "the concerted energy of such of
Mexico's leaders as prefer the liberty
of their people to their own ambi
tions," an answer to the frequent in
quiries in the foreign press as to
whether chaos and anarchy would re
sult if Huerta retired. j
Diplomatic officials here had no ad
vices to support published reports
that Queen Wilhelmina, speaking fori
The Hague tribunal, had addressed a'
peace proposal to Huerta. State de
partment officials were confident that
the United States would be notified
before any such proposal was made.
Although the state and navy de
partments were without official ad
vices over night, unofficial reports are
that seven federal generals in north
ern Mexico were ready to surrender
to the constitutionalists, were read
with keen interest. . ,
Tamplco is Capital
Mexico City, Dec. 3 The seaport
!city of'Tampico was today officially
declared the temporary capital of the
state of Tamauiipas. General Antonio
Rabago, the military governor who
was forced to abandon Ciudad Victo
ria and who yesterday was , reported
to have committed suicldehas gone
to Tampico under orders , from' the
federal government to re-establish his
governorship in the temporary capi
tal. The war depal ttnenfl today announc
ed that General Arizmendi and other
federal officers who fled from Ciudad

Women as
Soldiers
Extraordinary methods are being regarded as a virtual breakdown of
employed here to gain recruits for; the Huerta dictatorship so far as the
the federal army. Servant girls dis-1 north of Mexico is concerned, are
play marked caution when they ap-; headed for Ojinaga on the border. It
r in, the streets, as thev are aware 'is thought they will cross the river
that scores of their fellow servants
have been drafted into the army as
female soldiers.
One territory, utilized by the re-
vnltinr officers netted the federal.
army 65 conscripts in a single haul
yesterday. , The bills posted outside
a moving picture show announced that
the exhibition was "for men only."
The little room was crowded some
time before the performance began.
A series of religious pictures was
thrown on the screen, the first being
"The Virgin of Guadalupe," patron
PROTECTING GARRISONS
saint of Mexico. The crowd greeted
this good naturedly but when it was
followed by two other religious pic
tures, the men, who had looked for
a different kind of 1 entertainment,
started an uproar. This resulted in a
raid by the police, who inarched the
majority of the men to the barracks,
where they were at once placed in
the ranks of the army.
Preparations for defence in case of
local disturbances are being continued
by the foreign colonies other than the
American. Leaders of the American
colony are inclined to believe that
any move in that direction taken by
them would be misconstrued by 'the
Mexican government. In order to
avoid being regarded as organized
combatants, - the Americans, in case
of necessity, will take refuge beneath
the protection of the various Euro
pean flags. H. S. Kidder, general
traveling sales agent for the Waters
Pierce Oil company, was released on
a bond or $2,500 at San Luis Potosi
today, after submitting to-trial by
the federal authorities on a charge of
sedition. : " ' ;
Apparently the only evidence
against Mr. Kidder was that while
riding on the railroad he had talked
with employes regarding prevailing
conditions and frequently looked
through his field glasses at the land
scape. He was arrested on Novem
ber 27, ' , : ." ;".- :'
Peace Commission Appointed
The news that General ; Salvador
Mercado, commander of the federal
forces in northern Mexico, has sent
a military peace commission from
Chihuahua to Juarez to treat with thecided to lay it on the table,
rebels, while vigorously denied in of-
flcial circles, is regarded as the most Cradock Is Dined ,
serious blow yet struck at federal
prestige. -
In view of, Provisional President
Huerta's statements that he never j
would treat with the rebels it is con-j
sidered impossible that the peace com-j
mission has been sanctioned by him
At the same time, however, it is point
ed outl(,thatnthe appointment of the
commission is W line with the recent
suggestion made ' by t)r. Aureliano
Urrutia when at the head of the min
istry of the interior, that overtures
'might be made to the rebels without
government sanction.
Federals Flee Across Border ,
Juarez, Mex., Dec. 3. Confident
that the sevean federal generals who
evacuated Chihuahua City with their
troops intend to seek refuge in the
United States and thus be beyond
danger of being taken prisoners
by
the rebels, General Francisco Villa!
huahua and whose statement that he
had no money to pay his troops are
to Presidio. AX xresiuiu ucj tti
expected to be arrested by the Uni
ted States military authorities, taken
to Marfa and thence to San Antonio.
Their arrest on crossing the river
would follow as a matter of course,
under a ruling of Secretary of War
Garrison. '
With the generals are many subor
dinate officers, about 2,000 federal
regular soldiers and more "than 1,000
people of the wealthier class of Chi
huahua, who took flight rather than
face an attack by the rebels.
General Pascual Orozco and Gener
al Jose Ynez Salazar, believed to be
with Mercade, are under indictment
returned in the United States court in
El Paso for violation of the neutral
ity law. Salazar is out on bond, but
Orozco never was arrested.
Villa had little hope that his sol
diers would ,be able to overtake the
federals, who left Chihuahua several
days before the fact of their flight
became known.
That Mercado, after handing over
the portfolio of state to Federico
Moye, civil governor ad interim, should
offer to surrender on behalf of him
self and his subordinates and then
fly to the border, was regarded by
Villa as an unusual procedure.
Wealthy Man Executed!
Hermosillo, Dec. 3. A wealthy Mex
ican resident of Sinaloa was shot to
death here early today by a firing
squad of insurgent soldiers. He was
Antonio V. Caballero, convicted of
plotting against the constitutionalist
government of his state.
It was at the darkest hour, just be
fore dawn, when Caballero was placed
against a wall of sun-baked brick fac
ing the cemetery where his body now
rests. A group-of army officers and
a few curious civilians stood by.
The 'prisoner walked alone to the
wall, received the blessing of a priest
and placed the executioner's bandage
over his yes with bis own hands.
"Mark well the heart," he said.
Nothing was visible to the marks
men except the silhouette of his shirt
sleeves and the white bondage over
his eyes. The firing squad moved to
within ten feet of thslr huumn mark
and the five rifles cracked at once.
According to the findings of the
court martial Caballero had been con
fronted with letters signed by his
name which gave details of the in
surgent strength in Culiacan, recently
taken by the constitutionalists.
Moved to pity by the presence here
of the doomed man's wife and two
Children, a score of women pf Her
mosillo called on General Carranza at
the last moment to ask mercy. The
constitutionalist commander told them
they came too late. r,,. ,
American Policy Condemned
Mexico City, Dec. 3. The Colom
bian congress severely criticises for
mer President Roosevelt in a com
munication cabled to the Mexican sen
ate and camber of deputies today. It
arraigns Colonel Roosevelt and the
governmental methods of the United
States.
The communication was sent, it is
explained, "as a protest against inter
mediation in Latin-American affairs
by the Colossus of the North.''
The communication was considered
in secret session, at which it was de-
Mexico City, Dec. 3. Sir Chris
topher G'radock, the rear admiral in

guest. -

Paris, Dec. 3. 'Francisco de la
Iiarra, former provisional president of

SOL'DATED Washington, Hcc. 3. Secretary Mc
Adoo's first report to congress, de
livered today, is largely confined to
a review of the achievements of the
treasury departimnt in matters that
have been of nation-wide interest; to
recommendations, for increased ap
propriations for bureaus' undtjr his
authority, and for legislation, which
he declares necessary to the better
conduct of the government and the
protection of the people.
The secretary , discusses at some
length the subject of currency legisla
tion, reviewing the activities in his
department related, to it He speaks
of an unrest In business circles follow
ing the beginning pf the special ses
sion of congress lit April, refers to a
''propaganda of pessimism which, -de-'
signedly or not,.; produced a condition
of extreme nervousness, and tension,"
and points to Ida announcement in
June that the treasury was ready to
issue $500,000,000 of' emergency cur
rency under the AJurich-Vreeland act
to-' prevent? restn'.'4'ofl. okta-cOila'and
to ease any situation.
Mr. McAdoo details the treasury's
offer to loan to banks of the country
money to 'move the fall crops. The
cum of $46,500,000 out of $50,000,000
estimated to be needed, was appor
tioned among the states.
"It was essential," eays the secre
tary, "that the action of the depart
ment should be non-partisan and non
political; the crops of republicans,
democrats and progressives and all
other classes of people had to be
moved, and the earnest effort of the
department was to have the benefits
of this action, diffused as widely and j
impartially as possible.
. After pfaising the psychological
value of these incidents the report
continues:
"They demonstrate clearly that any
improvement in our financial system
which will permanently establish con
fidence will in itself be an immense
gain, and if that' improved financial
system assures the opportunity to se
cure at all times the necessary funds
and credits to meet the expanding
and legitimate needs of the commerce
and industry of the country, it will
be an achievement of enduring bene
fits." s, .
The secretary asks congress to im
pose a nominal tax of 1 per cent
proof gallon on all alcohol withdrawn
for ' denaturation a legislation re
quiring every dealer in leaf tobacco
to make an inventory of stock Janu
ary 1 'of each year and make a report
of his transactions quarterly or month
ly, and' that every dealer be required
to give bond.
The present oleomargarine law is
declared to be unsatisfactory and the
government is said to lose more taxes
from illicit practices in olemargerine
than through moonshine stills.
The law governing the sale of adul
terated butter Is declared to have
brought about unfortunate conditions
through 'the difficulty of its just en
forcement. : ' .-. .
Among his principal recommends
tions to congress the secretary plao
ed the following:
Enlargement of the public health
service and a closer co-operation With
state authorities to prevent and stamp
out epidemics of disease.
Building of f6ur revenue cutters,
for need of which the secretary
points out, the service is seriously
crippled. '.-'
Consolidation of the revenue, cutter
and life saving services into one or
ganlzation to be known as the coast
guard. Such a consolidation, the sec
retary says, would increase the ef
ficiency of each service with the idea
that the new coast guard should be
come a first naval reserve In time of
war. ' . "
The report refers to the require
ment that banks which hold govern
ment deposits made April 30, 1913,
pay Interest at 2 per cent, declaring
that it means an annual revenue of
$2,000,000 to the government and
showing that if such a regulation had
been made in 1897 the government
would now have received in Interest
more than $50,000,000.
The income tax Is not dwelt upon
at length, but the report estimates
that 425,000 individuals are subject
to it and' that corporations not here
tofore subject to tax will number
about 150,000.
International action to prevent such
disasters at sea as resulted -in the
sinking of the Titanid' Is urged.
, "The important maritime nations
should unite," eays the secretary, "in
defining lanes of travel across the
north Atlantic to avoid all danger of
icebergs during the months of April,
May and June of each year, and com
pel steamship companies to observe
them. This would result in increas
ing to some extent the time of ocean
passage but it would, on the other
hand, insure immunity from the dan
gers of icebergs during this season.
The steamship companies should not
be permitted to jeopardize human life
for the purpose of shortening the
trans-Atlantic journey by a few hours,
and saving comparatively few dollars,
but if they are they should be com
pelled to maintain an efficient ice
patrol at their own cost."
The question is to be taken up by
the international conference on safety
at sea now in session in London.
Speaking of scientific research by
the public health service the report
says :
"On account of the announcement
of. discoveries of alleged cures for
tuberculosis and their bearing on pub
lic health, important investigations of
them have been undertaken. Studies
of the Friedmann treatment were
sufficiently - advanced by May 36,
19lSrto - justify" a teport that the- ob-'
servations made up to that time did
not warrant the confidence In the
remedy which had been inspired by
widespread publicity. This investiga
tion is being continued, as are also
studies of other preparations claimed
as cures."
Sedretary McAdoo estimates that
the revenues for the fiscal year, ex
clusive' of postofficj receipts, will be
$28,000,000, onl $2,000,000 less than
the estimates for tne f'tcal year of
1914. To make that total he expRC'.s
the customs to brim; in fCn.OvC.OO
ordinary Internal revenue $315,000,000,
and the income tax l'"5,00.'?'H), of
which $40,000,00') 's to coma from
corporations, the remainder from In
dividuals.
From sales of pubiij lands he ex
pects to cover into the treasury $3.
000,000 and from miscellaneous
sources $56,000,000. re expressed the
belief that the ordinary receipts for
1915 will exceed the disbursements
sufficiently to pay out; about $26,000,
000 from the treasury's general fund
for the Panama tianal.

Cripple Creek, Colo., Dec. 3. With
out hope of finding alive any of the
three men caught in Monday's slide
in the Golden Cycle mine, volunteers
today continued the task of digging
their way through yesterday's second
slide. So dangerous was the work
considered that only volunteers from
the Golden Cycle employes were per
mitted to work, although men from
all parts of the district offered their
services.
Thomas Ilenehan, state mine conv
missioner,' arrived this .morning.. and
with his deputy, James S. Stewia'rt,
continued the official investigation.
Although no official statement was
given out, it was stated that all the
levels from the third to the ninth had
been destroyed and it was estimated
that 500,000 tons of dirt and rock had
gone down. So severe was the strain
that, the vein was split 100 feet from
the slide, and great .cracks, resem
bling earthquake fissures, were open
ed.
Mrs. Sorensen, wife of Samuel Sor

TIIG11IT TO BE DEA
Boston, Dec. 3. Twenty-seven, me
were killed in a fire which eweptj
through the upper floors of the Arcad
ia hotel, a lodging house in the South,
end, early today. Others are missing.
Scores were taken to hospitals., .. i
Nearly all the bodies were terribly;
burned, making identification impoa
sible. The victims were men in poofl
circumstances. Caught in the crowd
ed bunks on the top floor of the five-
story brick building and in, the email
rooms on the fourth, floor, they were
helpless. When they were aroused
the stairways were in flames and
there was a mad rush for the fire
escape at the rear.
Practically all the men were naked.
Many were resced by the firemen
and police. Some escaped by walking
a shaky plank stretched to an ad;c'.n
ing building or by jump'ng across a
five-foot alley to neighbcr.ng roofs.
The property loss is only $25,000
The Arcadia was locate 1 at ihe coi

streets. ..: The lower-iloers were oc,.
pied by stores. Th6 fire apparent
started in a hallway closet in tl.
second floor. The flames swept !.;
the wooden stairs and burned throti :h
the. roof. According to William Walsh,
the night clerk, there, were 178 lodg
ers in the building when the fire was
discovered by a passing newsboy.
After turning in an alarm he rushed
into the building, awakening the men
with his shouts. . . '
The top floor was one large rcorn,
filled with cots and bunks.' On the
fourth floor, where the loss of life
was heaviest, there were 30 tiny
rooms, like cells, with two cots In
each. A hallway ran through the cen
ter. The men in the rear rooms, open
ing on the fire escape had locked the
doors when thev went to bed and
those In front were unable to reach
the fire escape.
