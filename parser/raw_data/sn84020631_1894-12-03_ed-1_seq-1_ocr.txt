Washington, Deo. 3. The following is
the president's animal message to the
congress of the United States:
The assemblage within the nation's leg
islative balls of those charged with the
duty of making laws for the benefit of a
generous and free people impressively
suggests the exacting obligation and inex
orable responsibility involved in their
task. At the threshold of such labor
now to be undertaken by the congress of
the United States and in the discharge of
nu executive duty enjoined by the con
stitution, I submit this communication,
containing a brief statement of the con
dition of our national affairs aid recom
mending such legislation as seems to me
necessary and oxpediont.
The history of oar recent dealings with
other nations and our peaceful relations
with them at this time additionally dem
onstrates the advantage of consistently
adhering ton firm, but just foreign policy i
free from envious or ambitious national
schemes and characterized by entire hen
esty and sincerity.
During the past year pursuant to a law
of congress, commissioners were ap
pointed to the Antwerp industrial expo
sition. Though the participation of
American exhibitors fell far short of
completely illustrating our national in
genuity and industrial achievements, yet
it was quite croditnblo in view of the
brief timo allowed for preparations. I
have
ENDEAVORED TO IMPBBS9
upon the Belgian government the Heed
lessness and positive harmfulness of its
restriction upon the importation of our
food products and have strongly urged
that the rigid supervision and inspection
under our laws are amply sufficient to
prevent the deportation from this coun
try of diseased cattle and unwholesome
moat.
The termination of the civil war in
Brazil has been followed by the general
prevalence of peace and order, it ap
pearing at an early stage of the insurrec
tion that its oourse would call for un
usual watchfulness bn the part of this
government, our naval foroe in the har
bor of Bio Janeiro was strengthened.
This precaution, I am satisfied, tended
to restrict the issue to a simple trial of
strength between the Brazilian govern
ment and the insurgents, and to avert
complications which, at times, seemed
imminent. Onr firm attitude, of neutral
ity was maintained to the end; the insur
gents reoeived no encouragement ef
eventual asylum from our oommaaders;
nnd such opposition as they encountered
was for the protection of our commeroe
and was clearly justified by public law.
A serious tension of relations having
arisen at the close, of the war between
Brazil and Portugal by reason , of the esr
cape of the insurgent, Admiralde Gamma
nnd his followers, the friendly offices of
our representatives to those countries
were exerted for the protection of the
subjects of either within the territory of
the other. Although the government of
Brazil was duly notified that the com
mercial arrangements existing between
the United States and that country, based
on the third section of the tariff act of
1890, was abrogated on August 9, 1891, by
the taking effect of the tariff law now in
force, that government subsequently
notified the United States of its intention
- to terminate such arrangement on the
first day of January, 1895, in the exercise
of the right reserved in- the agreement be-
' tween the two countries. I invite a
reference to the correspondence between
the secretary of state and the Brazilian
minister en this subject.
The commission organized under the
conference which had been entered into
with Chili, for tho settlement of the out
standing claims of each government
against the other, adjourned at the nd
of the period stipulated for its continu
ance, leaving undetermined a number of
American cases which had been duly pre
sented. These olaims are not barred and
negotiations are in progress for their sub
mission to a new tribunal.
On the 27th of March last a
NEW TREATY WITH CHINA
in further regulation of emigration was
signed at Washington and on Angust 18
it reoeived the sanction of the senate.
Ratification on the part of China aid
formal exchange are awaited to give ef
fect to this mutually beneficial convention.
A gratifying recognition of the uni
form impartiality of this country to
wards all foreign etates was manifested
by the coincident request of the Chinese
and . Japanese governments that the
agents of the United States within her
proper limits should afford proteotion to
the subjects of the others daring the sus
pension of diplomatic relations due to a
state of war. This delicate office was ac
cepted and a misapprehension whioh
gave rise to the belief that, in affording
this kindly unofficial protection, our
agents wonld exercise the same authority
whioh the withdrawn agents of the belig
erents had exercised, was promptly cor
rected. Although the war between China
and Japan endangers no policy of the
United States, it deserves our gravest
consideration, by reason of its disturb
ance of our growing commercial interest
in the two countries and the increased
danger which may result to our citizens
domiciled or sojsurning in the interior
of China. Acting under a stipulation in
onr treaty with Korea, (the first oonoluded
with a western power), I felt constrained
at the beginning ef the controversy to
tender our good offices to induce
AN AMICABLE ABBANQEMENT
of the initial difficulty growing out of the
Japanese demand for administrative re
forms in Korea, but tno unhappy precipi
tation of aotual hostilities defeated this
kindly purpose. Deploring the destruct
ive war between the two most powerful
of the eastern nations, and anxions that
dur commercial interests in those coun
tries may be preserved, and that the safe
ty of our citizens there shall not be jeop
ardized, I would not hesitate to heed any
intimation that our friendly Bid for the
honorable termination of hostilities
would be acceptable to both belliger
ents.
A convention has been finally con
cluded for the settlement by arbitration
of the prolonged dispute with Ecuador,
growing out of the proceedings against
ismilio Santos, a naturalized citizen of
the United States.
Acting upon the reported discovery of
Texas fever in cargoes ef American cat
tle, the German prohibition against im
portations of livo stock and fresh meats
from this country has been revived. It
is hoped that Germany will soon become
convinced that the inhibition is as need
less as it is harmful to mutual interests.
The German government has protested
against that provision of the customs tar
iff act whioh imposes a discriminating
duty of one-tenth of 1 cent a pound on
sugars coming from countries paying an
export bounty thereon, olaiming that the
exaction of such duty is in contravention
of articles 5 and 9 of the treaty of 1823
with Prussia. In the interests of the
commerce of both countries and to avoid
even the accusation of treaty violation, I
recommend the repeal of so much of the
statute as imposes that duty and I invite
attention to the accompanying report of
the secretary of state containing a dis
cussion of the questions raised by the
German protests.
The boundary of British Guinea still
remains in dispute between Great Britain
and Venezuela. Believing that its early
settlement on some j net basis alike hon
orable to both parties is in the line of our
established polioy to remove from this
hemisphere all causes of difference with
powers beyond the sea, I shall renew the
efforts heretofore made to bring about a
restoration of diplomatic relations be
tween the disputants and to induoe a ref
erence to arbitration, a recourse which
Great Britain so conspicuously favors in
prinoiple and respeots in practioe and
which is earnestly sought by her weaker
adversary. -
Since commnmcating the voluminous
correspondence
IN EEOA11D TO HAWAII
and the action taken by the senate and
house of representatives on certain ques
tions submitted te the judgment and
wider discretion of congress, the organ
ization of a government in the place of
the provisional arrangement which fol
lowed the deposition of the queen has
been announced, with evidence ef its
effective operation. The recognition
nsual in such oases has been accorded the
new government.
Under our present treaty of extradition
with Italy, miscarriages of justice have
occurred, owing to the refusal of that
government te surrender its own subjects.
Thus far pur efforts to negotiate an
amended convention, obviating this dif
ficulty, have been unavailing. Apart
from the war in which the island empire
is engaged, Japan attracts increasing at
tention in this conntry by her evident
desire to onltivate more liberal inter
course with us nnd to seek oar kindly aid
in furtherance ef her laudable desire for
complete autonomy in her domestic af
fairs and equality in the family of na
tions. The Japanese empire of to-day is
no longer the Japan of the past and eur
relations with this progressive nation
should net be less broad and liberal than
those with other powers.
Good will, fostered by many interests
in common, has marked our relations with
our nearest southern neighbor. Peace
being restored along her northern frontier,
Mexico has asked the punishment of the
late disturbers of her tranquility. There
ought to be a new treaty of commerce
and navigation with that country to take
the place of the one whioh terminated
thirteen years ago. The friendliness of
the intercourse between the two countries
is attested by the fact that during this
long period the commerce of each has
steadily increased under the rule of mu
tual consideration, being neither stimu
lated by conventional arrangements nor
retarded by jealous rivalries or selfish
desires.
An indemnity tendered by Mexico as a
graoions act for the murder, in 1871, of
Leon Baldwin, an Amerioan citizen, by a
band of marauders in Durango, has been
accepted and is being paid in install
ments. '
The problem of the storage and nse of
the waters of
THI BIO OSAND8 FOB IBBIOATION
should be solved by appropriate concur
rent aotion of the two interested coun
tries. Rising in the - Colorado heights,
the stream flows intermittingly, yielding
little water during the dry months to the
irrigating channels already constructed
along its course. The scarcity is often
severely felt in the regions where the
river forms a oommon boundary. More
over, the frequent changes in its oourse
through level sands often raise embarass
iog questions of territorial jurisdiction
Prominent among the questions of ter
ritorial jurisdiction prominent among
tne questions ot the year was
THE DLEWFIELD8 INCIDENT,
in what is known as the Mosquito Indian
strip, bordering on the Atlantio ooean,
and within the jurisdiction of Nicaragua.
By the treaty of 1860, between Great
Britain and Nicaragua, the former gov
ernment expressly recognized the sov
ereignty of the latter over the strip and a
limited form of self government was
guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians to
be exeroised according to their cus
toms for themselves and other dwellers
within its limits. The so-called native
government, which grew to be largely
made up of aliens, for many years dis
puted the sovereignty of Nicaragua over
the strip and claimed the right te main
tain the reign practically independent of
municipal government. Early in the
past year, the efforts of Nioaragua to
maiutain sovereignty over the Mosquito
territory led to serious disturbances,
culminating in the suppression of native
government and the attempted substitu
tion of an impracticable compact ad
ministration, in which Nicaragua and
alien residents were to participate. The
failure was followed by an insurrection,
which, for a time, subverted Nicaraguan
rule, expelling her officers and restoring
the old organization. This, in time,
gave place to the existing local govern
ment established and upheld by Nicar
agua.
Although the alien interests arrayed
against Nicaragua in these transactions
have been largely American and the com
meroe of that region for some time has
been, and still is, chiefly controlled by
onr citizens, we can not, for that reason,
challenge the rightful sovereignty ef
Nicaragua over this important part of
her domain. For some months, one, and
during part of the term, two of onr naval
ships have boon stationed at Blewflclds
for the proteotion of all the legitimate
interests of our citizens. In September
last, the government at Managua expelled
from the territory twelve or more for
eigners, including two Americans for al
leged participation in the seditious or
revolutionary movements against the re
public at Blewfields, alroady mentioned.
Though the earnest remonstration of this
government, the two Americans have been
permitted to return to the peaceful man
agement of their business. Our naval
commanders, at the scene of this disturb
ance, by the constant exhibition of firm
nessnnd good judgment, have contributed
largely to the prevention of more serious
consequences and to the restoration of
qniet and order. 1 regret that, in the
midst of these occurences, there opened a
MOST QRAVE, IUBITATINO FAILUEB
of Nioaraguan justice. An American
citizen, named Wilson, residing at Rama,
in the Mosqnito territory, was murdered
by one Argnello, the acting governor of
the town. After some delay the murder
er was arrentod, but so insecurely oon
llned or guarded that he escaped, and
notwithstanding our repeated demands it
is clnimed that his recapture has been im
possible by reason of his flight beyond
Nicaraguan jurisdiction.
The Nicaragnan authorities, having
giving notice of a forfeiture of their con
cession to the canal company, on grounds
purely technical and not embraced in the
contract, receded from that position.
Peru, I regret to say, shows symptom
of domestio disturbance, due probably to
the slowness Of her reouperation from
the war of 1881. Weakened in resources,
her difficulties in facing international ob
ligations invite our kindly sympathy and
justify our forbearance in pressing long
pending olaims. I have felt constrained
to testify this ..sympathy in connection
with certain demands urgently preferred
by other powers. , .
The recent death of the ezar of Russia
called forth appropriate expressions of
sorrow and sympathy on the part of our
government with his bereaved family and
the Russian people.
The government ef Salvador, having
been overthrown by
AN ABBIiFT POPULAB OUTBBEAK,
certain of its military and civil offioers,
while hotly pnrsned by infuriated insur
gents, sought refuge on board the United
States warship Bennington, then lying in
a Salvadorean port. Although the prac
tice of asylum is not favored by this gov
ernment, yet, in view of the imminent
peril whioh threatened the fugitives and
solely from considerations of humanity,
they were afforded shelter by onr naval
commander; and when nfterward de
manded under our treaty of extradition
with Salvador for trial on the charges of
murder, arson and robbery, directed that
saoh of them as had not voluntarily left
the ship be conveyed to one of our near
est ports, where a hearing could be had
before a judioial officer in compliance
with the terms of tho treaty. On their
arrival at San Francisco such n proceed
ing was promptly instituted before the
United States district judge, who held
that the sots constituting the alleged of
fenses were politioal and discharged all
the aooused, except Cienfuegues, who
was held for an attempt to murder.
Thereupon, I was constrained to direot
his release for the reason that an attempt i
to murder was not one of the crimes
charged against him, and upon which his
surrender to the Salvadorean authorities
had been demanded.
Unreasonable and unjust fines imposed
by Spain on the vessels and commerce of
the United States have demanded from
time to time during the last twenty years
earnest remonstrance upon the part of
our government. In the immediate past,
exorbitant penalties have been imposed
npon our vessels and goods by the cus
toms authorities of Cuba and Porto Rice
for clerical errors of tho most trivial
character' in the manifests or bills of
lading. '' In some cases, fines amounting
to thousands of dollars have been levied
upon cargoes) or of the carrying vessels,
wherein the goods in question were en
titled to free entry, fines have been ex
acted even when the error has been cor
rected and the Spanish authorities noti
fied before the arrival of the goods in
port. This conduct is in strange con
trast with the considerate and liberal
treatment extended to Spanish vessels
and cargoes in our ports in like oases.
No satisfactory settlement of these vex
ations questions lias yet been reached.
The Mora cases, referred to in my last
annual message, remain unsettled. From
tho diplomatic correspondence on this
subject, whioh has been laid before the
senate, it will be seen that this govern
ment has offered to conclude a conven
tion with Spain for
THE DISPOSAL BY ABBITBATION
of outstanding claims between the two
countries, except the Mora claim, which,
having been long ago adjusted, now only
awaits payment as stipulated, and of
course it could not bo inoluded in the
proposed convention. It was hoped that
this offer would remove parliamentary
obstacles encountered by the Spanish
government in providing payment of the
Mora indemnity. I regret to say that no
definite reply to this offer has yet been
made and all efforts to secure payment of
this settled claim have been unavailing.
In my last annual message, I adverted
to the olaim on the part of Turkey of the
right to expel, as persons undesirable
and dangerous, Armenians naturalized in
the United States and returning to Turk
ish jurisdiction. - Numerous questions in
this relation have arisen.
While this government acquiesces in
the asserted right of expulsion, it will
not oonsent that Armenians may be im
prisoned or otherwise punished for no
other reason than having acquired, with
out imperial consent, American citizen
ship. Three of the assailants of Miss
Melton, an American teacher in Mosul,
have been convicted by the Ottoman
courts, and I am advised that an appeal
against the acquittal af the romaiuing
nvo has been taken by the Jurkigh prose
cuting officers. I
A convention has been concluded with
Venezuela for the arbitration of a long-
disputed claim growing out of the seizure
of certain vessels, the property of citizens
of the United States.

President's Message Received
Other Washington Notes.
Washington, Deo. 8. The opening of
the seoond session of the 63d congress,
after a reoeas of three months, made the
oapitol building the center of interest to
day. There was added interest owing to
the politioal revolution which has recent
ly occurred. Then the president's mes
sage was to be presented to both houses
and this meant that there conld be no
sharp debates, as the reading clerk would
have the floor for two heurs or more.
Congressional veterans, who had spent a
good share of their lives in the house ef
representatives, cams into it for their
final Bession, the recent tidal wave having
retired most of .the leaders of the major
ity. There were, however, few discon
solntes among the defeated and they
joined with the members of the minority
in good natured sallies. Representative
Holman, of Indiana, was one of the firet
to appear and was greeted warmly by his
friends. In the senate, the members were
late in arriving, and seme of those most
conspicuous in recent public events,
notably Senator Hill, were absent.
IN THE SENATE.
Promptly at 12 o'oloek Vice ProBident
Stevensou'cnlled the senate to order and
Chaplain Milburn offored the opening
prayer. He referred feelingly to the
critical illness through which the daugh
ter of the vice-president had safely
pnssed. Harris (Dem. Tenn.) and Man
derson (Rep. Neb.) wore appointed a coin
uiittee to notify the presidout of the sen
ato's readiness for his messnge. Mr.
Cockrell (Dom. Mo.), chairman of tho
committee on appropriations, offered a
resolution which was adopted, providing
that the daily sessions of the senate be
gin at 12 o'clock noon. The roll call de
veloped the presence of sixty-six sena
tors, considerably more than a quorum.
A recess was then taken until 12:30 p. m.
BEFUBLIOAN SRNATOBS CONFER.
At 12:30 the senate teok a further re
cess until 1:30. On the Republican side,
Mr. Wolcott of Colorado, who has been
so prominently identified in tho fight for
silver, conferred with Mr. Cameron of
Pennsylvania.
Aldrich and Allison, the respective tariff
and appropriation authorities on the Re
publican side, had a half hour's confer
ence during the second recess, being
joined by Messrs. Teller and Callam.
On the reassembling of the senate at
1:30, Executive Clerk Pruden
APPEABED WITH A MESSAGE
from the president and Secretary Cox be
gan the rending of the document. Special
attention was given to the reference to
the China-Japan war. This was the first
official information known evcu to tho
members of the foreign committee. It
was much more brief than was expected
and laft open the actual detail of the
negotiations.
AS BEEN TniiOUOH BKPUBLICAN GOGGLES
The Republicans do not fear any tariff
legislation this session. Senator Aldrich,
of Rhode Island, says that he thinks it
wonld be best to allow matters to rest
where they ore. "Let the country re
cover," ho added, "and wo will see if any
further legislation is wanted."
IN SFEAEEB CRISP'S DOMAIN.
The house was called to order at noon.
The chamber was well filled. Many of
the members' desks were strewn with
flowers. As onesaid: "These are flowers
for the living and flowers for the dead."
The desk of ex-Speaker Reed was
adorned with an immense floral ship of
state from a "Protectionist." On the
desk of Representative Linton, of Michi
gan, was a large floral Bohoel house, sent
with the compliments of an A. P. A.
organization, in acknowledgement of his
championship of the publio schools. Mr.
Reed was roundly oheered whon he en
tered, as was Representative Wilson, ef
West Virginia, author of the tariff bill.
At 12 o'oloek, Speaker Crisp entered and
ascended the rostrnm, and the second ses
sion of the 63d oongress had begun.
Rev. Mr. Bagby, the chaplain of the
house, invoked divine blessing and then
the roll was called.
Abont 12:15 W. C. P. Breokinridge, of
Kentucky, with
ntB SNOW WHITI HAIB
and beard, entered and walked quietly to
his seat. A page, carrying an armful of
magnificent roses, followed and placed
them on his desk. The roll call developed
the presence of 216 members, forty-seven
more than a quorum. Wilson, Holman
and Reed were appointed a oommittee to
join a similar committee from the senate
and inform the president that congress
was ready to receive any communication
he desired to make.
At 12:30 the honse took a recess until 1
p. in. to await the president's message.
At 1:35 Mr. Pruden, the president's

' THE ABMENIAN T80UBLE. . '
Washington. The Turkish legation to
day furnished the Associated l'ress with
an official telegram received from Turkey
by the Turkish minister, relative to the
trouble in Armenia. The dispatch says
that it wan the Armenians of the Talourio
district who started the revolt by at
tacking Mussulman villages. Troops
were thereupon immediately sent. The
faots show that instead of committing
any cruelties, the regular troops succeeded
in restoring peace and order. Further
proof that there was no persecution of
any sort is evinced by tho fact that the
peaceful Armenian villages, which took
no part in the revolutionary movement,
were unmolested during and after the
military operations.

"Dear Sirs: I take pleasure in writing the
good I have received from taking Hood's Sarsa
parllla. Every spring and summer for six years
or more, my health has been so poor from heart
trouble and general debility that at times lllfe
was a burden. I would become so
Emaciated and Weak and Pale 1
that my friends thought I would not live long.
I could do scarcely any work at all and had to
lie down every few minutes. I began getting
worse In January, losing my flesh and feeling so
tired. I thought I would try Hood's Sarsapa
rllla and I am happy to say I am in bettor health

than I have been for a number of years. My
Iriemls remark to mei ' Why how well you look.'
I tell them it is Hood's Sarsaparilla that lias
done the work. I would liavo all suffering hu
manity give this medicine a trial and bo con
vinced. This statement is True to the Let
