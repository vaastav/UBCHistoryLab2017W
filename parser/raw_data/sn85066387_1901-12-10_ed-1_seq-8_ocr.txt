"A prominent oacker of prunes at San Jose.
Cal.. wired a broker here to-day declining
orders for new crop Santa Clara fruit on a
2=i«c tour-tize basis, and reporting 3c as ab

40-uOs and 50-COs. Some packers hold these
sixes on the S! 4 c four-size basis f. o. b. in

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market
NEW YORK. Dec. 9.-There was a lively
shaking out of speculative long accounts in
stocks to-day, accompanied by a threatening
break in prices, which caused some alarm dur
ing the early hours of the day. In the after
noon there was a sudden about-face In specu
lative i*nUment. and a disorderly scrambuTin
sued among the bears to cover their short con
tracts. Amalgamated Copper continued to
m-iintain its conspicuous position, even with
the inci-ease in animation in the market to
day. The opening sales carried the stock back
1% to 60. and this proved the low level of the
dfcy. b'.u the demand dropped off as often as
the «tock approached Saturday's level, al
though determined support. was always offered
as it neared «S. The bears became alarmed at
the action of the stock, and In the last hour
rushed the price up to 71 in their frantic bid
ding aeainst each other. The final price was
but a ehade lower. The support offered to cop
per at the opening break prompted supporting
orders elsewhere, and the market steadied mo
mentarily, quite a iust of important stocks
rinlrs: & fraction over Saturday. . With a rise
in the call loan rate to 7 per cent. howe\-er
epeculatom took . fright and unloaded stock*
Prices eenerally touched the low point of the
day on this slump. &lth0ueh individual stocks
were forced down under subsequent attacks
carrying the whole market with them back to
about the . low level several times. St. Paul
was notably weak end fell 2% under Saturday.
Manhattan was also vigorously attacked' and
driven 2\i under Saturday. There was a good
deal of calling of ■ loans, but in seeking: new
accommodations borrower* bid the rate up up
on themselves to a higher rate than was j»ec
fssary. Judzing from subsequent developments.
The rulinc NUi were 6 per cent, or even 6V-,
and there seemed ample supply at thet figure
The perception of this fact emerged about the
•uie time that Amalgamated Copper began iu
rally. From a general level of a point or more
b»uow Saturdays prices the morKet be«tan to
move upward and sained momentum. There
wae a flight reaction before the close, but the
advance was renewed, making the closing ac
tive and strong at about the best. The Gould
railroed, Manhattan. New York Central,
Sugar, Pacillc Mail and General Electric were
all prominent in the rally, and the day closed
with net gains except in a lew instances. Tne
activity in the call loan market was reflected
In the sharp \ decline in , foreign exchange,
! which precluded all idea o£ gold exports for
• the present. Money was reported easier in
j London, Berlin and Paris to-day.
Railroad bonds weakened in sympathy with
1 stocks, but became irregular later. Wabash
debentures - gained nearly. 2 per cent. Total
bales (par value), $5.1S5,O0O.
\ United States bonus were all unchanged on
■ the last call.

The stock market to-day was weak, being
dominated by copper, which opened 10s down,
although closing unchanged at £55 per- ton.

break in the street. Prices ended about half
a point above the worst. London is inclined

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Dec. ■ 9.— Over-confidence among
the bears in the grain pits brought crlef to
many shorts to-day. Liquidation for profits
and short selling: brought a tremendous vol
ume of business, but the low prices which fol
lowed these weakening ! influences were . too
tempting to the big public and amid scenes of
the wildest confusion wheat was sent up to a
new crop record Drlce.
Wheat sold in great quantities at the open
ing. Conditions had changed; there was not
the same general clamor for the cereal from
the "country and there' was a " nervous feeling
resultant Irom the tumble of prices in Wall
street. In general there was an inducement
for people with high priced lines to take good
profits. Big houses with connections in .New
York, the Northwest and St. Louis were heavy
sellers, and Patten is reported to have un
loaded 1,000,000 bushels of wheat. As the mar
kets weakened in price they were met with a
renewal of outside buying, which was in such
bulk that.it could hardly have come from
scattered outsiders. Some of the persistent
bulls continued buying, and even at the top
prices at the opening thought the bargain a
good one. Conditions that usually govern wure
somewhat mixed. Cables were . not quite as
responsive as expected. Though the English
country markets were reported very strong
Northwestern receipts were falling off, but pri
mary receipts , showed a. good gain. 'The in
creases in breadstuffs on passage and in the
visible supply also were bearish factors. With
all these influences to abet the selling pressure
prices fell off badly. May options, which opened
%@%c higher to %@V4c lower at 82%@82Uc
steadily fell to 81%a Shorts were Jubilant and
rushed to put on more pressure. Then came
the- reaction -with the force of a whirlwind
Buying orders sprang up all around . and it
became woefully apparent that the market was
heavily oversold. In twenty minutes the price
for May was up again to 83%c, a new • crop
record. The close was very strong, %c above
Saturday,- at 83%©83V4c a
Corn started strong because of the snow- and
rain, which, it was thought, might hinder
farmers deliveries. Heavy profit-taking- how
ever, made itself felt in a weakening of prices
Increased Western offerings and the slump iii
wheat caused a • further decline until May
touched 67%c. Wheat strength, however came
to the rescue Just before the end of the ses-
aM^Hc.^ " P tO * 8t<5ady : ClOse '
After an opening at about steady prices oats
suffered a material loss ' under early heavy
liquidation from several of the most prominent
professionals. Prices were off at one time l%c
, below Saturday's close. When the strength In
wheat became manifest oats followed closing
comparatively firm, %c lower, at 46%c
Provisions were "rather heavy early 'affected
by the downward tendency in grains.'- On the
revival of the wheat strength,' however prices
responded. January pork closed 5c up - lard
5c higher and ribs unchanged. '

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
| The market is overburdened with Oranges,
mainly on account of the low prices at New
York, which are sending increased supplies this
way. No further decline is reported, however.
' : Grape Fruit is weak, with too much small
stock offering. ■ : • •
Receipts of Berries were very light, not ex
ceeding: 10 chests. A car of Apples came in
from Oregon and one from Mendocino County.
Quotations for Grapes and Figs are discon
tinued, as they have about disappeared. A few
scattering lots will probably come forward oc
casionally for several weeks yet.
Two cars of Eastern Cranberries came In yes
terday. Another falls due to-day and another
next'week, and dealers say that the latter will
be the last to be received here this season.

below our figures. Salvador Is now held flrmly
at 9c without recent transactions.
"The statistical • position of this market
should warrant the prospect of a ready demand
for new crop arrivals when they begin. It la
understood from many reliable sources that the
bulk of the crop will move later this comtns
season than usual by some thirty to sixty days.
There Is probably ■ suf flclent coffee In second
hands to avert any stringency in a general
way. although some varieties are apt to go
out of existence for a time.
"Stocks In first hand are remarkably small—
13.697 bags, or normal for this period— In view
of; the heavy receipt* during 1301. larger than
any previous .year by 46.000 bags and greater
than the average of the five preceding years
by 54.000 bags. -
"An important feature has been the increass
In shipments overland, which have mora than
doubled.
"Aside from the increased outlet to various
points of export, both domestic and foreign.
local requirements have undoubtedly perma
nently Increased, due both to the natural
growth of coast population and the gradual
extension of trade in nearby fields. It is hoped
and believed the gain will be permanent in all
directions, and • that the demand established
will be fostered and furthered by supplies from
Central America, during the coming year suffi
cient in quantity and quality to meet it.
