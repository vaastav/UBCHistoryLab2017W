--- was not acquitted, but the mis

have committed an assault on the
woman who died as the direct
consequence of the lewd and inde
cent Bacchanalian debauch in Ar

of . a crime against decency and

that the whole bunch of them

punishment, if it could be applied,
but as there happen to bfe a good
many* millions of people in the
United States whose ideas of wit,
humor and a good, time coincide
with those of Fatty Arbuckle he
will continue to be popular, despite
his lack of morals and respect for j
law and the good opinion of decent \
people.
NEW JOBS.
. The Saturday Evening Post has
a long article about finding em
-ployment which ought to bring
heart to many a man "who has been
looking for something in his own
line in vain. The men who can
do only one thing are apt to be in
a bad way if their one line shuts
down. But the hopeful thing, is.
that many men who think they can
dp only one thing are in reality
equipped to do more than one.
-There was the man who was in
despair because fee had "held'd?wn
a political job and didn't know any
thing.*' Inquiry proved that in that
job he had learned all about com
pensation insurance. He is now
selling it and doing well. There
was the man wncr was ? looking for
an engineering job but who was
not afraid to tackle the,business
of becoming an expert on apple
wood in 48 hours. He. got the
place and by constant study made
good- as a wood -expert. That jebi
led back to engineering.
Tnerewas the)man who, on road
repair, saw that tennis' courts along
that road needed'repairing and re
building, too, and ' has made a
successful business of that. There
was the man. who made the income
tax his hobby, and when his shop
closed, became a tax expert: The
man who in days of wealth did fine
cabinet work for fun, and in days
of adversity opened a period fumi-1
ture shop, is another example. j:
Courage, in.bad times, is the main^
thing. The frightened man . does
not know he can'do anything. The.
brave and resourceful man can
turn his hand successfully to some
thing hew.
EDUCATION TTEEK.
Not much education can be ac
complished Iii a week, but a good
start may be. made in the right' di
rection. Thkt is; the value of the
present week?-to* show what is
needed, and make the start.
The first thing Is to get 5,080,000
absent boys .'? and girls into the
schools. -Once there, the schools?
will attend to the matter in charac
teristic American fashion.
The next thing is to get after the
illiterate adults, native or immi- ]
grant. That is mostly a matter of,
night schools. The full possibili
ties of the night school have never
yet been realized.
. After that, or along with it,
comes the Americanization of
aliens. * ..
These, three things together
mean the making of good Ameri
cans. There cannot be really good
Americans without good education.
There is a bigger, broader thing
than all of these. It is something
that H. G. Weils is always harping
on, in his Outline of History and
his other writings. He aims at
nothing less than the education of
the whole world. And he wants
'not a narrow, provincial education,
not a merely national or racial ed
ucation. He wants a uniform body
of instruction that shall be agreed
upon by the more enlightened rep
resentatives of all nations and
races, and applied to all, for the
purpose of molding them into one
great, harmonious civilization. The
conception is of a world culture
bearing the same relation to pres
ent national cultures as the United
States of America bears to the va
rious states and races of which it is
constituted.
This is a huge undertaking, enor
mously difficult and requiring far
more time, effort and money than
any other educational scheme ever
conceived. Yet it may not be whol
ly visionary. The process has real- j
ly begun, in a vague, informal I
; way. Some day the nations may j
take it up seriously.
?
It will soon be too late to plant
wheat, but by ah effort a good
many hundred more acres could be
put in before Christmas. A few |
! dollars expended for seed wheat, a j
j few days' work and the utiliza
| tion of a few^acres of idle land on
[
i every farm would mean plenty of
bread next summer and fall at a
nominal cost.
? ? ?
A cow, a sow and a hen have
i proven more than a.match for the
J boll weevil wherever they have
j been given the right sort of sup
i port and co-operation. The farm
j er who is turning his seventy-five
cents a bushel corn into fifty cents
a dozen eggs is selling the corn
at a very high price and making
money.
? ?* ?
There will be more need for the
Christmas fund this year than
there has been since the fund was
first created more than a quarter
of a century ago, when cotton was
selling for five cents and great des
titution and suffering existed. Those
who have anything should divide
with those who have not.
? ? ?
The land owner who does not
' ??. i
make an effort to take care of his
tenants, who does not assist and
encourage them to adopt a system
of farming that will yield a living
under boll weevil conditions, will
destroy the value of his own prop
erty. Farm land, without labor
to cultivate it, is useless and with
out value.
? ? ?
The proposed reduction of the
levy for state taxes must not be lost
sight of when the law-makers as
semble in Columbia next month.
The budget makers for the several
counties' should follow the exam
ple of the Legislative Committee
on-Economy and cut out all the
non-essentials in county expenses
and thereby reduce the taxes for
county purposes.
? ? ?
There promises to be an unusu
ally large crop of candidates in
next year's primary, and it will be
a fact worth noting that while all
of the office seekers will be voci
ferous advocates of economy and
reduction of taxes, not one will
suggest cutting the salary of the
office he seeks." Just remember
this when you hear an office seek
er orating about lower taxes and
economy.
? ? ?
Several close students of the his
tory and economics of the south
during the last one hundred and
twenty-five years assert that cot
tori has never been a profitable
cr?p for the south, although it has
piled up wealth for New England
and. Old England. They claim
that the south would have been
more prosperous and on a sounder
economic and industrial founda
tion if cotton growing had never
become the dominant industry of
this section. Everything else was
sacrificed to cotton and the south's
entire industrial system has been
lop-sided and unsound for more
than a century. If this conclusion
be Correct, and there are
reasons to believe it is to a great
extent, it is time to make a change
and the boll weevil is a powerful
factor in forcing a change that \
should have been ma'de long ago.
The only b?sy plants in town are
the lumber mills, some of which
are running day and r.isht.

? COTTON LETTER.
(Furnished by MacDowolI & Co).
New Orleans, Dec. 8.?The sustaining
feature of market today was the reported
Iwtter demand for cotton goods and some
improvement in the demand for spots.
New York reports the cotton goods mar
ket ,t?ore active, estimated sales of print
cloths the past two days 200.000 pieces,
and that mills have hooked good orders for
ginghams, autumn 1922 delivery at one cent
higher than spring prices.
- Sales at Fall River of print cloths this
w*ek likely large aiso. Last week they
wer** 120,000 pieces, and while rather small,
nevertheless were largest for weeks, indi
cating the demand to be improving.
Returns to the census bureau shows the
following comparatives on ginning3 this
season and last:
tinned to December 1st. 7.610.870 vs. 10.
141.293: ginned to November 14th. 7.270.
575 vs. 8.914.642: ginned to November
14th to December 1st. :;70.29."> vs. 1.226.651.
Percent ginned to December 1st ? vs. 76.4.
Crop lint ? vs. 13,270,970.
The above returns show the greatest fall
ing off In ginnings for many years, if not
on record, and denotes what may l>e ex
pected rn the way of a falling off In re
ceipts and stocks shrinking in the future. I
becoming mure pronounced as the season
advsnces.
To December 13th last season an addi
tional 735.Ofto bales were ginned: 678.000 j
more to January 1st. and another 460.000 j
to January 16th and the last periodical re ;
turn1? of the season accounted for 1.236.000
to March 20?h making a total for last ;
season of 13.271.000 bales.
In as much hs there remains but a very j
small amount of cotton to be ginned dur
lug the remainder of this season, and as j
consumption promises to continue 1>'ik, it
would seem as if higher perhaps much
higher prices are a certainty eventually.
The only tlp'ng preventing market showing
more strength at moment is the want of a j
better spot demand, but as goods are report
ed In better request it follows that spot-, 1
are apt to become more sought after In the
Dear and distant future. 1
FEDERAL
BUDGET
^REDUCED
Budget Commission
presents Estimate
Fiscal Year 1923
That is $500,000,000
Less Than Former
Figures
Washington, Dec. 5.?A federal
budget for the fiscal year 1023 ap
proximately $500,000,000 below the
four billion dollar figure which had
been estimated some time ago as
the minimum of government expen
ditures for several years to come,
faced congress when it reconvened
today.
The exact figures as prepared by
the newly created budget, bureau
and transmitted by President
Harding in a special message, were
$3,505,754,727, including an esti
mated deficit of $21,509,666 in the
operations of the postal service.
This total represents a decrease
of $402,107,639 from the $3,967,
922,366 estimated expenditures for
the current fiscal year and $2,032,
285,962 from the actual expendi
tures in the fiscal year 1921. It is,
however, $167,"'1,977 in excess of
the estimated receipts of $3,338,
182,750, while the outgo for the
current fiscal year exceeds the esti
mated receipts of $3,043,453,063 by
$24,468,703.
Referring to the apparent deficit
for 1923, President Harding wrote
the congress that "ways are provid
ed for the, relatively easy adjust
ment without added taxation" of
the discrepancy between the income
and outgo, .es one means he rec
ommended legislation directing the
reduction of the accumulated naval
supply account by $100,000,000.
Actual appropriations asked of
congress for the various federal .de-'
partments and agencies for 1923"
total $3,224,875,592, exclusive of
postoffice department. This repre
sents a reduction of $122.S06,310
from the original estimated a3 pre
sented to the budget bureau, it is
stated, but is approximately $27,
000,000 more than the appropria
tions for this fiscal year.
Explaining the $2S0,S79,134 ex
cess of estimated expenditures in
1923 ever the appropriations asked
for, budget bureau officials explain
that some of the funds actually to
be put out will be carried over in
continuing appropriations and by
other means. They say that ap
propriations for a given year do not
accurately reflect actual expenses
for that year, pointing out that
while ahe appropriations for this
fiscal year were $3,197,807.962, the
estimated actual outgo will exceed
this sum by approximately $770,
000,000.
Of the total estimated expendi
tures for 1923, approximately $2,
900,000.000 is to pay for past wars
and to keep up the fighting arms of
the governrr mt, leaving only about
$600,000,000,000 for the peace
time pursuits of the federal estab
lishment. The estimate for the
army and the navy is $801,636,107,
a reduction of $66,305,299 as com
pared with this fiscal year and
$956,352.741 as compared with the
fiscal year 1921.
The navy estimate of $431,754,
000, it is explained, does not take
into account any possible reduc
tions that might be brought about
as a result of the arms confer
ence, the total including funds for
continuing work on the ships of the
1916 program, most of which
would be scrapped under the pro
posal made to the conference by
the American government.
The largest single item in the
budget is the fund for the interest
on the public debt, the $975.000,
000 provided lacking only $25.000,
000 of the total expenses of the
federal establishment before the
world war. In addition, there is an
estimate of $389,388.800 for the
war debt sinking fund.
Included in the total for the
army and navy is $31.964,000 for
development and maintenance of
the air service by the two depart
ments, divided $16,195,000 for the
navy and $14,964,400 for the army.
These compare with expenditures
this year of $15.000,^00 and $19,
159,700. respectively.
The navy estimates carry an item
of $99.198.000 for continuing con
struction on the 1916 building pro
gram, as compared to $142.452,000
for this year. Navy pay calls for
$14S,754*.O0O, an increase of $49,
000,000.
Expenditures on public works un
der the war department are given
a's $57,943.900, including $44,245.
400 for rivers and harbors, as com
pared with $29,850,000 for the cur
rent year.
Included in the $455,232,702 es
timate for the veterans bureau are
these items:
Military and naval compensation,
$ 50,000,000; military nad naval in
surance. $62,713.000: vocational re
habilitation. $127,000,000; medical
and hospital service. $72.000,000.
and salaries and expenses, $26,
521,702.
Fori prohibition enforcement the
budget bureau estimates $10.000.
000, an increase of $2.500.000 over
this year. Expenses of the Inter
nal Revenue Bureau are placed at
$66,206,1 90. as compared with $58,
032.790 for this year.
Estimates for independent agen
cies include:
Federal Trade Commission. $94$,
500; Interstate Commerce Commis
sion. $4.995.240: Housing Corpora
tion. $1.267.453; Railroad Labor
Hoard. $39S,630; alien property
custodian. $390,480; Civil Service
Commission. $595.595, and em
ployes' compensation commission
and compensation fund, $2,798,000.
While the railroad administra
tion and the transportation act are
expected to cost the government
$337,679,235 in 1922, no estimate
!
of expenditures for these purposes
for H?23 included in the budget.
Exports explained that it was not
possible to make an accurate esti
mate of what would be needed for
the carriers until after the results;
of the 1922 railroad financing are j
j known.
Accompanying the budget as sent
i to congress is a detailed report
I from Director General Dawes as to
the operation of the budget bureau
j since its establishment five months
ago and some pointed comments as
to means o nnitocfu c!0s890$_.
to means of continuing its efficient
operation. Discussing the reception
of the budget by congress, General
Dawes says:
"It is to be expected that since
the preliminary estimates have
been made under pressure by the
executive for proper retrenchment,
where consistent with efficiency, it
will not be necessary, as heretofore,
for.congress to make radical cuts
upon the estimates of the budget
with any uncertainty as to what
will he the result as it effects ef
ficiency. The president of the
United States, when he sends the
budget to congress is presumed to
send it with all the reductions in
expenditures^ which can be effect
ed without due impairment of gov
ernmental business* processse. in
the preparation of the budget he j
has had at work and authorized
agency in the bureau not only in
ascertaining the reasonableness of
desired appropriations, but in con
tinuallj- imposing pressure upon the
departments for a reduction in the
estimates wherever proper and
possible.'
General Dawes says he feels that
the estimate for expenditures for
102C, upon which the budget is
based "will not be increased ex
cept through appropriations initiat
ed by congress or by the executive
as a result of emergency or unfore
seen conditions arising after the
preparation of the budget."
Reiterating his recommendations
that congress immediately repeal
all outstanding continuous appro
priations and "revolving funds,"
General Dawes says the methods
of appropriating money heretofore
followed "has resulted in a condi
tion of things under which it is al
most impossible for either the exe
cutive, congress, or the secretary
of the treasury to have before them
a true picture of the fiscal condi
tion of theg overhment at any par
ticular time."
"The whole habit of making con
tinuous appropriations to which
the government has been commit
ted in the past," he adds, "is only
an encouragement to a lack of
scrutiny of public work by the head
of the department under which it
j is carried on, and an encourage
ment to shiftlessness and careless
ness on the part of the subordi
nates more directly concerned in
it. This system of preparing the
budget will confine the attention
i of the executive, of congress, and
of the public to the one great im
portant question, to wit. the rela
tion of the money actually to be
I spent by the government to the
I money actually to be received by
the government in any given year,
all its outstanding obligations and
indefinite commitments, projects
and enterprises considered. This
will enable congress, with more in
telligence, to determine at any
time both the necessity for re
trenchment and the ability of the
government to engage in additon
al projects to be initiated by con
gress outside of the budgetary pro
! visions."
Likening the federal government
to a business corporation. General
I Dawes points to these "faults'
which he says existed:
The president of the corporation
(the president of the United States)
gave practically no attention to its
ordinary routine business.
The administrative vice presi
lents (members of the cabinet)
were allowed to run their several
departments as if each separate
department was an independent
authority in all matters of routine
business.
Because of a lack of any out
lined business plan, no system ex
isted for making purchases or in
selling material along business
lines under a unified policy.
No balance sheet of the corpora
tion as a whole was ever prepared.
The treasurer kept no accurate
account of the contingent obliga
j tions of the various federal depart
ments, thus resulting in money be
I ing drawn from him continuously
in excess of the estimated annual
running expenses.
The corporation, in effect, sel
! dorn reconsidered an unwise pro
ject entered into by any depart -
I ment.
! The administration heads of the
j departments were selected as a
I rule with little reference to their
J business qualifications and were
I compelled to rely largely upon the
j advice of subordinates "wedded to
the theory of the right of independ
! ent operation of the department." j
! Outlining the work of the vari
j ous co-ordinating agencies estab
I lished by presidential order "to rec
tify faults in the routine business
of the government," General Dawes j
says:
> "They involve no transfer of au- j
j thority the location of which has
I been fixed otherwise by statute.
"They involve the delegation of
no questions of policy save that of
I economy and efficiency.
I "They are simply agents by ,
I which unified methods of ordinary :
I business can be imposed by the j
chief executive.
"They are created simply to
give the president of the United j
States, the same agencies of con- j
tact and transmission of authority i
as obtain in any private organiza- j
[tion.
"They involve no material ad
| dition to the expense of govern- j
mental administration.
"They are non-partisan, being
composed of men already in the
government service.
"They are in effect simply a ;
j regrouping under an executive j
J leadership of certain of the present .
I employes of government of such j
I experience, contact, and relation in j
; its routine business as enables them '
! to make possible the application of j
I common-sense business methods, j
"It cannot be too often reiterated
that this most important reforma
tion in the governmental business
system is independent upon the
president of the United States him
self, and upoii his continued as
sumption of his responsibilities as
its business head. The minute he
realizes his attitude of attention to
this duty there will be felt the nat
ural pull of the departments and
establishments toward the old sys
tem of complete independence and
decent raliation."
General Dawes concluded his re
port with this statement:
"In making this report the direc
tor of the budget will state that his
connection with the bureau is limit
ed as to time, in accordance with an
understanding which he had with
the president at the time of his
appointment. His purpose in mak
ing this announcement at this
time is a emphasize the fact that
his recommendations are made in
an impersonal way, with funda
mental business principles and their
proper preservation in their appli
cation to governmental business ad
ministration alone in mind."
Strike Troubles in
Kansas City
Governor May Be Forced to
Call Out State Troops
- Kansas City, Mo. Dec. 5?(By the j
Associated Press.)?The Kansas;
Court of Industrial Relations today i
informed Mayor Harry B. Burton,!
of Kansas City, Kan., and Henry
T. Zimmer, chief of police, that un
less crowds surrounding the pack
ing plants were dispersed by to
morrow morning the industrial
court would telegraph Governor
Henry J. Allen to declare martial
law in Kansas City, Kan., and or
der the State militia to take charge j
of the situation.
The ultimatum of the court to
the city authorities was delivered at j
a conference in Mayor Burton's
office late today, at which the three
members of the industrial court,
the mayor, the chief of police and
superintendent from several pack
ing plants were present.
Earlier in the day a number of
trucks attempting to cross to Kan-i
sas City, Mo., to make local deliv- ;
jries of meat, were turned back by \
strike sympathizers. One truck
driver was pulled from his seat and j
beaten.
Claim 41,000 Men Arc Out
Chicago, Dec. 5?(By the As
sociated Press.)?At the close of
the first day of the strike of pick
ing house workers, union officials
announced that 41.000 workers in
packing houses throughout the
country were on strike, while
spokesmen for the packers as
serted Chicago plants were operat
ing, with full forces, while plants!
in other? centres all continued j
work.
Twenty-nine thousand workers:
in packing house centres outside i
Chicago responded to a strike call
today, according to a statement to
night by Dennis Lane, secretary of
the Amalgamted MeMat Cutters
and Butcher Workmen of North
America, which called the strike
after a wage cut averaging 10 per
cent had been decided on by plant
assemblies, composed of reprcsen- ;
tatives of employers and workers j
through which the packing com
panies propose to settle questions
affecting the workmen. More than
12.000 workers employed by the
big five in Chicago walked out to
day, according to Mr. Lane.
Spokesmen for the "big five" i
gave figures to show that only
about 1.000 men were out in Chi
cago while the number on strike
at independent plants was given
by packing officials as about the
same number.
According to Mr. Lane, approx
miatoly 28 per cent of the Chi
cago workers reported for work to
day. "I am satisfied that tomor
row morning will see the packing
establishments closed tight, because
this element will join the majority j
now," he said. Four independent {
packing concerns in Chicago and
two outside the city, settled with
the strikers today, Mr. Lane said.
According to the packers, there
were two men waiting for every
job that was vacant and men be
ing hired to fill the places of the
strikers.
There was no violence in con
nection with the first day's strike !'
here but at St. Paul several persons j
were slightly injured when a group
of commission men clashed with j
strikers.
Practically all employees of the
Denver packing plants were strik
ing, company officials admitted to
day and tonight an order was is- !
sued in District Court demanding
that the workmen return to their!
jobs pending investigation of tin;
dispute by the Colorado Industrial
Commission.

The Boll Weevil Problem Cannot be
Solved Except by United Effort
In a letter to the Daily Item Dr. W. W. Long, Di
rector of the Farm Extension Service of Clemson
College, says:
"The action of the business men of Sumter in or
ganizing to meet boll weevil conditions is absolutely
a step in the right direction. The boll weevil problem
cannot be solved except by united effort. Any coun
ty that undertakes to solve this problem by individual
effort will make a horrible failure. The business
men and farmers must of necessity work out their
problems together and adopt the slogan, "One for all
and all for one". You must not only endeavor to
work out your agricultural program but your
economic and financial program. Industrious, hon
est, pains-taking men must be made to understand
that the community is going to stand back of them
and the thriftless, shiftless, and do-less men must
be made to understand that they have no place in the ?
community. With this spirit engena areNi, the
problem will be solved and the community will be
better for the doing, inasmuch as it will have been
purified by unselfish sacrifice, earnest toil and the
development of the co-operative spirit.
I again congratulate Sumter county and its lead
ers.

ton pneumatic tire truck, submit
ting figures to the board on several

obtained prices. The board, after
due consideration, favored . the
purchasing of this truck, but as the
funds for same were not availahle
in this year's supply, thought best
to\consult with the legislative dele
gation before taking action. Com
missioners McLaurin, Britto n and
Oliver and engineer Jeffords to conr
suit with members of the legisla
tive" delegation, and if. they' con
curred in the matter, to purchase
a truck which their discretion dic
tated.
Engineer Jeffords presented-a
bill for damage to a buggy due to

and caused by the county truck's
brakes being so worn that they
would not hold. This bill was, au
thorized paid.
The clerk advised that Jesse^

Permanent Roads Commission ap
peared before the board with ref-*
erence to the balance of the funds
collected for special county work
not being used for the gravelling of
the Oswego road and stated that
they would like to know the atti
tude of the board as to the handling
of these funds. The board, after
considering the matter ordered that
this commission be advised that the
county beard had under contem-"
platiort. and pending, certain mat
ters which would have to be dis
posed of before it would be in po
sition to reply definitely as to these*
