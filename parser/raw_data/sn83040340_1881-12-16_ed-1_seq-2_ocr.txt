THE NEWS IN BRIEF
It was generally understood in Wash
ington on the 6t.h that Secretaries Lincoln,
.Tames, Kirkwood and Hunt would con
tinue in the Cabinet for some months yet
at least. The appointment of Frelinghuysen
lor Secretary of Slate and Brewster for Attorney-General
was expected to be an
nounced at any moment.
Pbesidekt Arthur took formal pos
session of the White House on the fth. He
was unaccompanied, and after entering the
mansion spent a little while down-stairs
inspecting the recent improvements. He
then went through the upper part of the
house, and was greatly pleased with the
chamber prepared for his use. He dined in
the family dining-room, in company with
"Representative Skinner, of New York.
There were no callers, and the President
spent the evening with jMr. Beed, his Sec
retary. The report of the Ute Commissioners
to the Secretary of the Interior is very volu
minous. Among the most important of the
recommendations are: That the present
boundaries of the reservation be established
permanently; that the few settlers now on
the reservation be paid a reasonable com
pensation for their improvements; that the
"White River and Uintah tribes be consoli
dated, and that portions of the different
lands assigned by the recent agreement be
changed with consent, and gradually the In
dians taught to cultivate their lands, and
finally withdrawing Government aid alto
gether. Joseph Warren Keifer, Speaker
of the House of Representativesrepresents
the Eighth Ohio District. He was born in
Clark County, O. , January 30, 183G. His
boyhood and youth were mostly spent on a
.farm. He received a common-school edu
cation, topped off at Antioch College. In
il858 he was admitted to the bar. He en
tered the Union Army as Major of the Third
Ohio' Volunteers, was subsequently ap
pointed Colonel of the 110th Ohio, and
served with conspicuous gallantry through
out the war, being severely wounded at the
battle of the Wilderness. He subsequently
was made a Brigadier-General and Major-
General by brevet for gallant and distin
guished services. He made his first ap
pearance on the stage of national affairs as a
member of the Forty-fifth Congress, and
was re-elected to the Forty-sixth and Forty
seventh Congresses.
Caucuses for the nomination of offi
cers of the House of Representatives were
held on the evening of the 3d, with the fol
lowing result: Republican nominees: For
Speaker, J. Warren Keifer, of Ohio; Clerk,
Edward HcPherson, of Pennsylvania; Ser-geant-at
Arms, Geo. W. Hooker, of Massa
chusetts; Doorkeeper, W. P. Brownlow,
of Tennessee; Postmaster, Capt. Harry
Sherwood, of Michigan; Chaplain, Rev.
Frederick D. Power. The caucus contest
lor the Speakership lay between Keifer
and Hiscock, of New 'York, and
the lines were pretty closely drawn
as between Stalwart and anti-Stalwart,
the former carrying off the the prize.
The Democrats renominated the officers of
the last House. The Greenbackers selected
Nicholas Ford, of Missouri, for Speaker;
Gilert De La Matyr, of Indiana, for Clerk;
Lee Crandall, of Washington, D. C, for
Sergeant-at-arms; H. Martin Williams, of
Missouri, for Doorkeeper, and W. C. Moore,
of Pennsylvania, for Postmaster.
A number of experts were called to
the stand in the Guiteau case on the 5th.
Most of these were gentlemen who had
closely watched the prisoner as spectators
during the trial, and had therefore had a
good opportunity of Judging of his mental
characteristics. Dr. Kennon, editor of the
Chicago Medical Review, gave his opinion
unequivocally that the prisoner was insane.
Witness based his Judgment of Guiteau's
insanity upon the hereditary taint, upon the
impairment of judgment, upon the exalta
tion of the emotions, and upon inspiration,
which also included the motive. Witness
admitted that when a man committed a
.crime while acting under the delusion of
Divine inspiration and then conducted him
self precisely as a criminal would do, it
would be presumptive evidence against his
insanity. Dr. Charles H. Nicholas, of the
Bloomlngdale Asylum,replied to a hypothet
ical question proposed by Scoville : " If the
evidence to which I have listened is correct,
I should say the prisoner is insane." Dr.
Folsom, Boston, Dr. Godding, of the Gov
ernment Insane Asylum, Washington, Dr.
McBride, of Milwaukee, and Dr. Chan
ning, of Brookline, Mass., concur
red substantially in the opinion
of Dr. Kennon. President Arthur, who
was subpoenaed by the defense, was not
called to the stand, but submitted his writ
ten answers to several interrogatories. The
substance of his replies was: He knows the
prisoner, having seen him at least ten times,
possibly twice that number; had never con
versed with him "excepting to return the
ordinary salutation of the day, and once or
twice in answer to his request to be employ
ed in the campaign as a speaker by the Re
publican State Committee, of which I was
Chairman." To the question: "What polit
ical services the prisoner had rendered the
Republican party during the last Presiden
tial campaign?" the answer is: "None that
I know of." To the question whether there
was anything in the prisoner's relations to
himself or Gen. Grant, or Senator Conkling,
or any of the others of the Republican par
ty, socially or politically, to furnish him
with any ground for supposing he would
receive any political preferment, the answer
is "No." Prisoner. "That is a matter of
opinion." The last question was: "Did
you ever give him any reason to think that
he could have any political or personal in
fluence with you?" Answer: "Ineverdid."
Prisoner. "He never had occasion to."
The President adds to his answers the follow
ing: "I hve been requested by counsel for
the defense to produce a letter written by
the prisoner since his indictment; that let
ter was received by me in October last, and
was not pret-erved. I do not recollect its
contents particularly, excepting that it con
tained some claim of his having rendered
some important services to the Republican
party during the Presidential campaign, and
an appeal for postponement of his trial to
give him time to prepare for defense."
Prisoner. " That is all there was to it."
PERSONAL AND GENERAL
A(iNNEAPOi.is has again suffered a
furious loss to her milling Interests, four
,f her large flouring establishments being
entirely destroyed by fire on the moraine or
the 4th. Theso were the Excelsior Mill,
owned by D. Morrison and operated by
Charles A. Plllsbury & Co., capacity 700
barrels per day; the PillsburyBMill, owned
and pperated by the same firm, capacity 10,
000 barrels; the Minneapolis Mill, owned
and operated by Crocker, Fisk & Co., ca
pacity 450 bwrels; the Empire Mill, owned
by D. L. Watson, of Massachusetts, and op
erated by Chas. A. Pillsbury & Co., capacity
650 barrels. A cotton mill, owned by D. M.
Morrison and operated by Henry Honkompt,
was also destroyed. The aggregate loss is
not far from $415,000, with insurance of
about $215,000. The fire originated in the
Pillsbury B Mill, but in what manner is
not known. While the Minneapolis Mill
was burning a terrific explosion occurred,
throwing down the walls and burying sev
eral men in the ruins. Assistant Engineer
Fredericks, John Tuhey and Daniel Burke,
firemen, and a man named Robinson, were
taken out dead. Several others were badly
injured.
Tobin, arrested at Bradford, Ireland,
will be tried on the charge of treason and
felony. The Government proposes to iden
tify Tobin with the Fenian and Irish broth
erhoods. Papers seized at Tobin's house
show that 257 men were enrolled in the
neighborhood of Bradford, and the Broth
erhood possessed arms to equip them, and
had a fund of over 200.
A nitro-glycerine explosion at
Eagle Lake, on the Thunder Bay Division of
the Canadia Pacific Railway, killed Duncan
McMillan and Wm. Cornell. They were
blown to atoms.
Warren Woodward, son of the late
Judge Warren J. Woodward, of Pennsyl
vania, committed suicide at Reading, Pa.,
by shooting himself through the head. He
was a young man of more than ordinary
ability, but of infirm health.
Miss Louisa Stevens, an attractive
young lady of Pleasant Plains, Sangamon
County, 111., took a fatal dose of opium on
account of a supposed slight from the young
man to whom she was engaged.
The Virginia Legislature organized
on the 7th.
Dr. Crawford, a prominent physi
cian of Van Buren County, Iowa, swallowed
a dose of poison mistaken for medicine.
He died in half an hour.
The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe
Railroad Company have unearthed a series
of startling frauds connected with the con
struction department of their road and have
caused the arrest of a number of employees
and others, some twenty-five persons in all,
engaged in the conspiracy. The swindle
has been in operation for six years. It was
carried out by means of time-checks, issued
to fictitious persons and indorsed over to
outside parties in collusion with the Road
master and Section Foreman. A number of
well-known Topeka men are alleged to have
been engaged in the scheme, and they have
been arrested.
The Ring Theater, the principal place
of amusement at Vienna, was consumed by
fire on the evening of the 8th and a large
number of persons perished in the flames or
were trampled to death in the frantic ef
forts of the audience to secure an exit. The
fire broke out on the stage Just before the
time for the curtain to rise, and is said to
have been caused by the falling of a kerosene
lamp. In a brief moment the curtain and
scenery were enveloped in flames, and soon
after there was an explosion of gas. The
audience were naturally panic-stricken and
the ordinary exits became blocked by a
struggling mass of humanity. A large num
ber leaped from the windows to the pave
ments below, where sheets were stretched to
break their fall. The number of lives lost
is estimated at from 150 to 200.
The great Wabash Railway bridge,
spanning the Missouri River at St. Charles,
again went down, on the ; vening of the 8th,
precipitating an entire freight train of some
thirty cars sixty-five feet into the river be
low. The engineer, Jack Kirksby, fireman
Chamberlain, and one other employee took
the terrible plunge, but strange to say two
of them escaped without serious injury.
Engineer Kirksby was either killed by the
fall or drowned. His fireman came
out of the cab to the surface and
was rescued. Several stock men leaped
from the caboose in time to save themselves
as they saw the front of the
train plunging Into the abyss.
It was two years ago on the
8th of November that a similar disaster oc
curred. That time it was the third span;
this time it was the first span that suc
cumbed. A month ago the State Railroad
Commissioners made a report that the bridge
was perfectly safe, and only a day
previous to the accident one of the
Commissioners inspected the struc
ture and went away seemingly satisfied.
It was estimated by the officers of the road
that it would take a week or more to erect a
temporary trestle-work to permit the pas
sage of trains.
Hiram and Valentine Mercer, broth
ers, shot and killed a Deputy Sheriff and
wounded another officer, in Decatur County,
Iowa, on the 16th of November last. They
subsequently fled to Missouri, taking up
their residence with another brother, who
owns a farm near Eau de Vie, Christian
County. A reward of $1 , 200 was offered for
the capture of the desperadoes. A few days
since an officer from Iowa, assisted by the
Sheriff of Christian County and a small posse,
attempted their capture by strategy. The
plan succeeded so far as to draw the des
peradoes into an ambush prepared for them
by the officers, but both refused to surren
der and showed fight, whereupon they were
shot down, one being instantly killed and
the other dying within a few minutes.
Jefferson Davis has arrived in New
York from Europe.
FORTY-SEVENTH CONGRESS.
The Forty .seventh Congress convened at
noon on the Sth, Senator David Davis presid
ing. But few Senators were present and the
proceedings of that body were devoid of es
pecial interest. A number of bills were in
troduced, among them the following: By Mr.
Sherman To provide for the Issue of three
per cent, bonds, to be applied solely to the
redemption of three and one-half per cent,
bonds; by Mr. Garland For the appointment
of a commissioner to Investigate the ques
tions of the tariff and revenue laws: by. Mr.
Beck For retiring trade dollars and recoin
Ing them Into standard silver dollars ; by Mr.
Logan To place Gen. U. S. Grant upon the
retired list of the array. Mr. Edmonds offered
a resolution to continue the committees as
they existed last session. Mr. Pugh
moved an amendment, authorizing the
President of the Senate to decide
whether the committees shall be equally or
otherwise divided between the two political
parties Laid over without action, and the
Senate adjourned .The House was called
to order by Clerk Adams. The roll-call
showed 290 Representatives present, the ab
sentees being Morey, Scales. Mills and Dens-
ter. Nomination for Spenlrer being In order,
Keller was put in nomination by Robinson,
Randall by House, and Ford by March. Bar
rows of Michigan. Holman, McCoofc and
Laddwere appointed tellers. The roll was
called and the result was as follows: Whole
number of votes, 285; necessary for choice,
143. For Keifer 148, Randall 129, Ford 8. None
of the candidates voted. Those voting for
Ford were: Brennan, Burrows of Michigan.
H. A. Hazeltine, James of Texas, Ladd of
Wisconsin, Grave and Murch of Missouri.
Fulkeraon and Paul of Virginia, Readjusters,
voted for Keifer. The result having been an
nounced. Keifer was escorted to the Speaker's
chair by Randall and Hiscock and took the
oath of office, which was administered by
Kellcy of Pennsylvania, as the oldest member
In point of service. The swearing In of mem
bers then took place. Objections were made
to several, who were compelled to stand
aside, but except in the cases of Chalmers of
Mississippi and Dibble of South Carolina, the
objections were subsequently withdrawn.
The other Republican caticus nominees
were then duly elected and the Bouse was
declared duly organized. After appointing
the usual committee to wait upon the Presi
dent the House adjourned.
The President's Message was delivered
to Congress on the 6th. Among the bills In
troduced In the Senate were two for admis
sion of Dakota as a State. Senator
Davis, vacating the chair in favor Mr.
Harris, spoke at some length in
regard to his position as President
S:o tern. The occasion was the calling up by
r. Edmunds of his resolution provldlngf or
the continuance of committees as they
existed at the close of lost session.
In the course of his remarks Mr. Davis said:
"Last spring I took occasion to state
the reasons why my votes should
be given to sustain the existing organ
ization of the Senate. Although cir
cumstances have materially changed since
that time, the obligation which I vol
untarily assumed has not been altered;
hence I adhere to that declaration, always
reserving to myself the right of rejecting an
offensive candidate." This expression of Mr.
Davis's views Is regarded as settling for
the next two years the status of the
Senate officers, unless death should moke a
change, giving the Republican party a posi
tive majority. . . .Tim proceedlngsof the Houso
were devoid of interest, the drawing of seats
occupying the greater part of the session.
The House adjourned till Friday.
Ox the 7tb, Senators Sherman, Pendleton,
Davies, Lapham, Bayard and Morgan were
appointed a joint committee for the prepara
tion of a memorial upon the death of the late
President Garfield. Bills were introduced
and referred: For the admission of New
Mexico as a State; compensating railway
companies for transporting mails ; establish
ing a Department of Agriculture and Com
merce; making trade dollars legal tender for
nil debts except where otherwise stipulated.
Mr. Morrill's Tariff Commission was then de
clared in order, but that gentleman declined
to speak, and the Senate adjourned.
Senator Morbjix addressed the Senate,
on the 8th, upon the Tariff Commission bill.
He said our nearest approaches to free trado
had been seasons of national disaster, as were
the ycai-s 1833, '47 and '57, and the further we
had receded from free trade the better had
labor fared and the greater had been the ma
terial and educ.itional advancement of the
country. At the conclusion of his remarks,
Mr. Morrill moved a reference of the subject
to the Committee on Finance, but at the sug
gestion of Mr. Garland, who desired to be
heard on the subject, withdrew his motion.
The latter temporarily yielded the floor for
some general business, and the subject was
formally passed over for the present. The

Secretary Folgcrt Report.
Washinqtox, Decembers.
The annual report of Secretary Folger,
transmitted by the President with his mes
sage, covered forty pages of printed matter.
It states that the revenues for the fiscal year
were $360,78298.57. the ordinary expenses
$880,712878, and there was left a surplus of
$100,099,40190, This surplus was disposed of
as follows:
To the redemption of bonds for
the sinking fund $747100 00

ing fund 109,00100

The receipts of last year were greater than
the year before by $29,358,901.10. The customs
revenues were increased $11,637,611.42, and tfce
revenues 111,255,0119. There was a decrease
of expenditures as follows: In tho Interior De
partment for pensions, $671,789.48; for premi
ums on purchased bonds, $1,734,071.64; and in
terest on the debt, $13,248,833.93. The receipts
for the present year are estimated at $400,000,
000, and the expenditures at $270,000,000.
The report recommends that National Banks,
at any time within two years prior to the expi
ration of their corporate existence, bo allowed
to extend the period of succession by amend
ing the article of association by the votes of
shareholders owning two-thirds of the capital,
if the bank be found to be in good 6hape.
' THE TREASURY RESERVE.
The Department, the report declares, has
pursued the policy long established of retain
ing as a reserve for redemption of bonds about
40 per cent, of tho notes outstanding. In ad
dition, sufficient money has been kept in the
Treasury to meet all other demands and obli
gations outstanding. Tho reserve has never
been below fl per cent, and never above 45
percent, of tho outstanding notes. The lib
eral purchase and coinage of silver, and the
receipt of them for public dues, has failed to
raise the market value of silver, It is recom
mended that measures be taken to repeal the
act requiring the Ibsuo of silver certificates.
and for tho retirement of such as may be in
circulation. It is recommended that National
Banks be prohibited from retiring their cur
rency except after a previous notice of inten
tion so to do, the length of such notice to be
fixed by law. The compelling of such a notico
would prevent tho banks from suddenly con
tracting the volume of currency, and creating
the embarrassment that followed the passage of
tho 3-per-ccnt. Refunding bill of Congress at
the last session.
Between June 22, 1874, and 1878, silver coin
was not legal tender in payment of United
States bonds. The report asks whether foreign
bondholders who acquired their bonds during
this period may not regard tho payment of
these bonds now with silver coin as a breach of.
faith. This Government, the Secretary says,
Is abundantly able to discharge its debts in
money which Is everywhere accepted as a true
standard of value. Further, on the subject of
silver coinage at the rate of $2,000,000 per
month, he savs:
" We furnish the world with the largest por
tion of both silver and gold, and our exports
command the best money of the world, as they
ever should do, and will, unless wo bind our
selves to accept of a poorer. Wo need not ap
pear anywhere as supplicants when we clearly
maybe the contractors. Some of tho Euro
pean nations whose concurrent action is neces
sary to any result that is sought, do not yet
appear ready to accept limitation, and when
ready they may ask for a ratio that will be in
convenient for us to adopt, and reduce the
ratio of silver below the standard of our coin
age. The most potential means of bringing
about any concert of action among different
nations would appear to bo for tho United
States to suspend for the present the coinage
of silver dollars. It is, therefore, recommend
ed that provision for tho coinage of a fixed
amount each month be repealed, and the Sec-
rotary be authorized to coin only so much as
will be necessary to supply the demand.
"The revenue from customs for the past
fiscal year was $198,159,676,02, an increase of
$11,637,611,42 over that of tho preceding year.
Of the amount collected, $138,908,062.30 was
collected at the port of New York, leaving
$59,251,146.63 as the amount collected at all the
other ports of the country. Tho expenses of
collection for tho past year were $8,419,315.20,
an increase over the preceding year of $387,
410.04, while there was an increase in the rev
enue from customs over the preceding year of
over$U,500,000."
There was a decrease in the value of Im
ports amounting to over $25,000,000, manuf act
tured wool and scrap and pig-iron showing the
most of this decrease.
REDUCTION OF TAXATION.
The report declares that an equalization and
simplification of tho tariff is necessary, but
leaves the method and degree to Congress
without a recommendation. The question of
disposing of the surplus Government revenues
Is in this connection taken up. The Depart
ment is embarrassed in disposing of the sur
plus in an economic and lawful way. While
there is an alleged stringency in the money
"vZfm. f w.owirPPently most unlikely to be otherwise

full accepted. The entering of the market and
buying of bonds at their current rates Is not
recommended, because experts show that
this cannot be done without a loss to the
Treasury. The announcement, too, of such
a purpose would put up the market
price. The report suggests that, In view
of this existence of a surplus of revenue, it
might be well to lessen certain taxes. A re
duction of the tax on liquor and tobacco is not
recommended. But bank checks, matches and
proprietary taxes are suggested as proper ones
to lessen. It Is further recommended that If
Congress determines on a decrease of the rev
enue. It seek that end as well through a revis
ion of the existing Tariff laws as through an
abatement tf tho internal revenue.
REFUNDING MEASURES.
On the subject of the refunding measures of
the year the report says
"On the 1st of November there remained
outstanding of bonds bearing three and a half
per cent interest, payable at the pleasure of
the Government after proper notice, $563,380,
950, Included in which were $12,035,500 called
bonds not matured. If the excess of revenues
ver expenditures should continue as during
the past year, Its application to the payment of
the bonds can be' made at the discretion of the
Secretary, and to that extent the Government
will be relieved from tho necessity of paying
any premium of consequent redemption of its
bonded debt."
Concerning future refunding measures the
report, while making no recommendations,
daclores that it fears short-term bonds bearing
a lower rate than 34 per cent, cannot be mar
keted. It is suggested, if any be issued, that
they be made not shorter than ten-year obliga
tions. The attention of Congress is called to the
presence of pleuro-pncumonia among cart!
In different sections of the country, and to th
necessity of quarantining imported cattle.
It Is recommended that a better appropria-
tlon be made for the life-saving service; that
thepenslonlaws l extended to the revenue
marine service; anainai me project ior mo
search for the Jcannette, suggested by Capt
tain Hooper, be acted upon.

of Bank Directors and of Examiners of Na
tional Banks. Sections of the Revised
Statutes and by-laws of the National Banks
are cited, and the report continues:
"The duty of a Board of Directors is
plainly defined, and, however innocent they
may be of any intention to wrong, they are
responsible for the safety of the funds com
mitted to their care. If it can be shown
any of them had notice of illegal transac
tions, it is a serious question whether they
are not legally bound to make good the
loss which may occur; and it Is a question
whether they are not also liable for losses
which may occur from neglect of duty,
even without notice. If this is not a just
and proper construction of the present law,
then it becomes a question for the consid
eration of Congress whether additional leg
islation upon this subject Is not required.
The Examiner can have but limited knowl
edge of the habits and character of those
employed in a bank. If the Teller is mak
ing false entries, and daily abstracting the
funds of the bank: if a book-keeper is
keeping false accounts, and render
ing untrue statements; if the Cashier
is placing forged paper among the bills re
ceivable and upon the register-books, and
transmitting such paper to distant places
where it is purported to be payable, it is not
possible for the Examiner in a day or two
to unravel this eil work, wh.ch may have
continued for months, and obtain a correct
balance sheet. Examinations should be
periodically made by a competent commit
tee, selected from the Board of Directors.
They have the whole resources of the bank
at their command, and if they hayanv rea
son to suspect dishonesty or 5faud, it is
their business to investigate thoroughly,
and they should employ experts to assist
them in so doing. The Directory must
continuously look after its own serv
ants. The Examiner looks after the
acts of the Directors. The report of
the Examiner is confidential. It is
for the use of the Comptroller's office only,
and is in no sense a certificate of the good
condition of a bank. In many instances the
capital stock of a bank has thus been found
to be impaired and the deficiency been mad
good without the knowledge of the general
public. In other instances banks have been
obliged to pass their usual dividends, using
their earning to liquidate all bad and doubt
ful debts. The number of banks passing
dividends the present year is 175; in I860,
230; in 1879, 304, and in 1878, 343. Hun
dreds of instances occurred annually, and
many are occurring daily, wherein banks,
under the reports of Examiners, are notified
of violations of the act and are brought un
der discipline of the law. The records of
this office show only one among all the Ex
aminers ever appointed who baa been found
guilty of any wrong-doing."
bpeaking of the Pacific National Bank of
Boston the Comptroller says the Directors
had full information in reference to the ir
regular and illegal methods of the bank,
which have since caused its ruin. His let
ter, in any properly-conducted bank, ad
dressed by him to the Board of Directors,
composed, as is the case in these instances,
of prominent merchants and business men,
should have been sufficient to correct the
abuse, and save the bank from the disaster
which occurred. The law should certainly
be so amended as to make it a criminal
offense for an officer of a bank clandestinely
to make loans, either by the use of certifi
cates, as in this case, or otherwise.
A considerable part of the report is given
to the subjects: "Substitutes for Money,"
"The Proportion of Bank-checks Used,"
from data furnished by President Garfield;
"Checks and Drafts in the Principal Cities,"
and the Comptroller says:
" It would be an interesting subject for
investigation to determine what proportion
the checks received by banks in New York
City on any given day represent the opera
tions at the stock Exchange, and what pro
ortions of these operations represent
egitimate, and what speculative, transac
tions." Secretary Lincoln's Report.

The annual report of the Secretary of War
Is chiefly devoted to the consideration of the
important recommendations contained in
the annual report of the army chiefs. Gen
eral Sherman's recommendation that the
army be increased to 80,000 men receives
Secretary Lincoln's earnest indorsement.
The attention of Congress is called to the
need of legislation to prevent an intrusion
upon Indian lands, especially from Kansas,
into the Indian Territory. Secretary Lin
coln invites special attention to that part of
the report of General Wright, Chief of En
gineers, which refers to our seacoast de
fenses, and on this subject says:
"The Chief of Engineers shows that de
fense by fortifications and torpedoes is the
only one which is at all practicable for a
coast as extended as ours, comprising so
many rich maritime cities, extensive navy
yards,and depots of supply; that any attempt
at any other mode of defense would be
enormously expensive, both for first cost
and maintenance, and it is the only mode
adopted by maritime nations. Experience
shows modern wars come on suddenly; that
serious international disputes occur be
tween nations the relations of which
are
for defense ana an attituae oi oeiugerencv
are sometimes the best preventives of actual
war. We know that the necessary new
works and the proper modifications of the
old works will require many years for their
completion, and it seems simply a matter of
common prudence that we commence with
out delay, and, under liberal appropria
tions, put our coasts in an effective condi
tion of defense."
Referring to the subject of the standard ef
requirements necessary for admission to the
Military Academy at West Point, the Sec
retary says:
"1 concur in the views of my predecessor,
that it would not be well to raise the stand
ard of admbslon. The result of the last ex
amination, in which 49 out of 118 candidates
were rejected, shows the standard is so high
as to prevent the admission of many who
would undoubtedly, if they had been so sit-
J uate(ias to receive the proper preliminary
training, prove valuable omcers. u nas re
cently been recommended to me by the
Academic Board to permit the discontinu
ance of certain prescribed studies in the
course for the purpose of giving time for
others, the importance of which was appar
ent. A consideration of the subject sug
fested by this recommendation leads me to
elieve it would be best to extend the course
so as to cover five years. It is believed that
by so doing not only would the benefits of
the academy be more widely extended, but
that the graduates would be prepared to
render better service to the country."
The actual expenditures under the War
Department for the fiscal year ended June
20, 1881, were $42,122,201. The appropria
tions for 1882 were $44,889,725, and the esti
mates for 1883 call for 44,541.27& The es
timates presented to the Secretary for re
vision included, for the armament of fortifi

The question whether eggs should
be sold by number or by weight has
been under discussion in Paris. All of
the usual arguments in favor of either
method have been put forth. Men oi
mathematical and statistical proclivities
have been at work on the problem, and
have learned that eggs laid by the
more generous fowls, such as Black Span
ish, Houdans and Creve-Cceurs, aver- -age
seven to a pound, while Hamburgs
and some other varieties lay eggs so
small that nine or ten are required to
tip the pound weight. It has not oc
curred to any ingenious Frenchman,
that, in view of the varying thickness
of the shells, a more equitable method
than either of those under discussion
would be to open the eggs, and sell'
them at so much a quart for solid meats,
as oysters are sold.
Tho Lynchburg Virginian describes
an ingenious trap devised by a Virginia
farmer to capture sheep-stealing dogs.
Having suffered severely from the dep
redation of dogs upon his sheep fold, he
built around a number of sheep that
dogs had killed an inclosure of rails
twelve feet high and ten feet square at
the ground, the sides of the trap slop
ing inward until an opening was left
about live feet square. 'Any dog could
easily climb such a sloping fence and
enter the pen, but not even a grey
hound could jump ont of it, In three
nights the farmer captured forty-six
dogs, including fifteen or twenty 'that
had never been seen before in that
neighborhood. This after their had
been a public slaughter of all dogs sus
pected of sheep killing save one, whose
master could not be convinced of his
guilt. The trap was built for his espe
cial benefit, and it caught him the first
night.
A little girl only fourteen years of
age, named Margaret Messenger, has
just been convicted and sentenced to
death at the Cnmberland Assizes in
England for the murder of a baby
whose nurse she was. The jury found
her guilty, and also that although, be
ing at the time under the age of four
teen, she was, prima facie, incapable
of crime she was precocious enough
to have a criminal intent. There is on
record in England an example of a boy
aged eight years being hanged for burn
ing a Darn in Berkshire. A boy of
ten. convicted of murdering his "bed
fellow, was unanimously pronounced
by the Judges as a proper subject of
capital punishment, and does not ap
pear to have been reprieved. These
cases happened long before the Secre
tary of State was in the habit of inter
fering in cases of murder as he does at
present; and it is probable that this
young girl may have her punishment
commuted to imprisonment for life.

that leprosy is contagious, a belief

as the woman has never in her life

for her to contract the disease by breath
