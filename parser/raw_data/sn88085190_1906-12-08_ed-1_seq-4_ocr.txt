Government
By ELIHU HOOT. Secretary of State
CUE first fruits of democracy are, many of them, crude and
unlovely. Mistakes are many, partial failures are many
and sins not a few. The capacity for self government does
not come to man BY NATURE. It is an art to be
learned, as well as an expression of character to be devel
oped among the great numbers of men who exercise popular sover
eignty.
To reach that goal toward which we are pressing forward, the gov
erning of the multitude, we must first acquire the knowledge that
comes from UNIVERSAL EDUCATION, the wisdom which fol-
lows practical experience, that personal independence and self respect
befitting men who acknowledge no superior, self control to replace that
external control which democracy rejects, RESPECT OF THE
LAW, obedience to the lawful expressions of the public will, consider
ation of the opinions and interests of others equally entitled to a voice
in the state, a loyalty to the abstract conceptions of one's country as
inspiring as that loyalty to personal sovereigns which has so illumined
the pages of history, the SUBORDINATION OF PERSONAL IN
TERESTS TO THE PUBLIC GOOD and love of justice, mercy,
liberty and order. All these we must seek by slow and patient effort.
iNo student of our times can fail to see that not America alone, but the
whole world, is swinging away from the old governmental moorings
End intrusting the fate of civilization to the capacity of the POPU
LAR MASS to govern.
Nor can we fail to see that the world is making substantial progress
toward more perfect popular self government. I believe it to be true,
viewed against the background of conditions a century, a generation,
even a decade ago, that the government of my own country has ad
vanced in the intelligent participation of the great mass of the people,
the fidelity with which they are represented, respect of the law, obedi
ence to the dictates of SOUND MORALITY and in effectiveness
and purity of admiration.
Nowhere is this progress more marked than in Latin America. Out
of the wreck of Indian fighting, race conflicts and civil wars strong and
stable governments have arisen. Peaceful succession in accord with
the people's will has replaced the forcible seizure of power PERMIT
TED BY THE PEOPLE'S INDIFFERENCE. The rule of law
supersedes the rule of man. Property is respected, individual liberty
is respected, and the national faith is held sacred. This progress has
not been equaled everywhere, but there has been PROGRESS every
where.
The present affords just cause for satisfaction, and the future i:s
bright with hope. Not by national isolation have these results been
accomplished. No nation can live unto itself alone and continue to
live. The growth of each nation is part of the development of the
RACE.
THERE MAY BE LEADERS, AND THERE MAY BE LAGGARDU,
BUT NO NATION CAN LONG CONTINUE FIRST IN THE ADVANCE
OF THE GENERAL PROGRESS OF MANKIND, AND NO NATION NO"
DOOMED TO EXTINCTION CAN REMAIN FARTHEST BEHIND.
The Islander is pleased to note that the consolidation of
the Bellingham Reveille and the Puget Sound American is not
to result in the discarding.of the name of the former or in its sub
ordination through hyphenation} or otherwise. The editor of
this paper has been a reader of the Reveille ever since .it: first
began carrying its morning messages to the people of the north
west, sixteen years ago. During all of its history as the pioneer
daily paper north of Seattle it has maintained an enviable repu
tation for integrity and enterprise, conservatism and sound judg
ment in its treatment of public questions of general importance,
and it has seldom gone far astray in purely local matters. It
would be little short of reprehensible to drop or belittle a name s
which for a quarter of a century has been so prominently and <
worthily connected with the development of- the northwest and j
has occupied such an honorable place in the journalistic history 5
of the state. "'.'''•'• ' ]'.*- s'< *•- ; «'',/.!. '.'.:', '', \

"Socialism" says the Post-Intelligencer, "is not the formu- <
, lated protest of disinterested reform." Perhaps not, for very few {
reforms are altogether disinterested. We can hardly agree with {
our big contemporary, however, in its statement that Socialism !
is merely "the garrulous complainings of human .failures Who- !
have lost interest and ambition, or who were born with a grudge !
against honest endeavor." Its tremendous, growth in Germany, j
and even in this country, can hardly be" accounted for in that, |
way. A great many bright men and good citizens are conscien- [
tious believers in the principles of Socialism and it may*.a«.well ,
| be conceded^ that however impracticable it may be-from the stand
point of most people, it is a force that must be reckoned with 1. '
 President Roosevelt's message to Congress gives abundant
assurance to the people, .i£ any needed, that he is still sitting
otf the lid,- Throughout the nation- the hope # ,$& people is
strong that 4ho #ffi slay there for ihothfcr term, 1 notwitHstantling
his repeated declarations that he wants to get off and enjoy the
simple Hit in a lodge in some vast wilderness.
