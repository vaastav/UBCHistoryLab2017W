| Correspondence of 'J'ho Cecil Whig J
Letter from tlie (ilh Aid- Regiment.
j A communication over tlie signature
of “ Cecil,” sent you some time since,
and which you were kind enough to ;
insert in T/ic Whig, scorns to bavtj ex
cited ihc ire of our Q. M. in an extra
ordmary degree.
Allow me .o say in reply to his arti
cle on the subject, published in The
Whig of the 16th of November, that ,
“ Cecil ” had not the most remote idea ;
of offending our worthy Q. M. Hut in
a leisure moment penned a rough sketch
of tho movements of the (sth, which he.
“ Cecil,” believed, and still believes, to '
be a plain unvarnished account, without
exaggeration. The appellation “ Ras
cally Quar ormusters ” was not intended
to apply to .Mr. Touchstone, (who
appears to be excessively touchy, and if
touched is very apt to ffmg stones, as it
seems) hot was intended to apply to
that numerous class of quartermasters
having charge of the principal depots,
and who are fattening upon the plunder
of the treasury, by tbe most rascally
stealing, and whose villany, not only
robs the people of the Union of their
money, but causes extreme suffering to
the men who have voluntarily left
their homes, and are now, in this
inclement season, perilling their lives in
defense of the Constttu ion and Govcrn
uiuiu. “ Cecil ” admits the article was
carelessly writer), and might bo con
strued in the light Mr. T. views it, but
nothing of tbe kind was intended, or
.bought of.
Jim our worthy Q. M., in his fury,
coinini s an error still more grave, in
endeavoring 10 ridicule the services of a
corps, in whose good name he ought to
glory, and which lie ought to sustain by
every honorable means in bis power.—
The exposure and service rendered by .
the Otb and so flippantly ridiculed by
Mr. T. is subs a. t ally proven by the f ict
that in the “ Randal* own” march lUO
men, a majority of whom were p ydcaily
abler men man the fj. M., were entirely
broken down, and unable to keep up with
lie column, many of them nut reacning
our camp until the second day, and the
whole command rendered unlit for ser
vice, lor a week at leas , and I fearsome
of them were permanently injured by
tha' night’s du y. The sneer at the
labor pel formed upon tin*, and other
muielms of the corps comes with bad
grace from one who is never called upon
10 share in such service, and cannot,
whilst lying snug in his quar ers, pro
perly estimate the wear and .ear upon
the thews and sinews of the men par
torming such duly. His efforts .o turn j
into ridicule the complaints made of the !
quality of the provisions, is in still j
worse taste, from tho fac , ihat no one I
knows as well as the Q. M. that, a large
proportion of the rations forwarded for
he use of this Regiment were unsound
and totally unlit for use, and that no
one has complained more loudly than ho
has on the subject.
Amongst ibe articles, were s inking
boot, pork do., mouldy and wonneaten
bread, ro ten beans, and ground coffee,
(misnamed such) which lasted as if man
ufactured of said beans. .Suffice it. to
say, (hat this Regiment, numbering at
most 800 men, have had wi bin the last
two months, 4UU men sick wi li jaundice,
to say nothing of those affected by
rheumatism, typhoid fever, and other
disorders, which, our Surgeon believes,
were caused by extreme exposure and
bad rations. I’he same low estimate of
the service and exposure of our men in
the calling a large portion of them out.
night after night, of the last week, af or
they had retired for tho nigh , and on
one of these nights marching them
through ra n to Hagerstown and back,
would only have the effect to bringdown
the contemptuous derision of our worthy
Q. M. So I shall not attempt o sketch
it. Pardon tho liber y I have taken in
be mat er, and the storm I have inno
cently lot loose, giving you trouble, and
I doub not, (at least in the es imation
of our (j. .M.J demolished entirely poor

Ruined Plantations in Louisiana.
A correspondent of the Boston Trav
eler,who accompanied a flag of truce to
a rebel camp eight miles from New
Orleans, a faw weeks since, says :
“ We passed large groves of manges,
ripe, soon to decay for want of labor to
: pluck them ; laige plan aliens deserted,
! and the immense crops of sugar and eoru
! destined to ibo sumo fate, aud for the
same cause The scene was dismal in
I the extreme, mid should bn witnessed by
i ilktso nor hern men who, ignorant of war
: and i s ravages, complain of it so bi terly
because they are culled upon for increas
ed taxes.”
—Death. V' a frond man, is thu coming of'
the heart loin blooming time. Down ea!l I

Retribution.
But few of tho leading and most
active men of the South, who wore in
stumental in getting up this rebellion, ,
will be likely to escape in their own ;
persons and families, ihe direful eon.se- I
quenoes of their treachery and ingrali- i
tude to tho Government from which so
many of them had received almost, illim
: liable favors and advantages. We are
1 reminded of this fac:, from reading a
paragraph from a letter dated ar. War
renton, Va., where is located tho resi
dence of ex-Governor Smith, (famous as
Extra Bill>,) for the additional charges
ho made to his bills against Uncle Sam,
as a mail contractor.) Tbe premises of
extra Billy were recently visi ed by
some of our troops, and found to con
tain thu remnant of .he family, his aged
wife and daughter, ihe latter represented
bv the letter as not much calculated to
cause any modern Leander to swim a
river, to visit this fair specimen of a
Virginia hero—old Billy himself had
been sen: away on the approach of onr
army, being an invalid from fever, the
results of a wound received in the light
at An ie am—one of his sons was killed
in the battles near Richmond, and the ,
other died from disease incurred from j
exposure, serving the secession cause— |
i is probable tha all his servants |
availed of the opportuni y to make their !
escape from his quarters a: Warrenton,
hut few of whom will ever he likely to
be gathered into his fold again—so that
all he extras Billy made off poor old
Uncle Samuel, but little will be left to
him, and the probabilities are, iliul no j
posterity will be left to rise up and call !
him “ blessed.”
The or'ginal Soore'ary of War of ihe
rebels, who made the famous speech on
_tho steps of their Capitol a Montgomery,
Alabama, when the news of ihe capture
of Sumter was received, in which ho
promised he excited multitude that by
ihe Ist of May, the rebel flag would also
‘‘ be unfurleJ on tho capitol at Wash
ington, ami soon in Philadelphia, New
York, and even on Fanieul Hall in Bos
ton,” is now represen ed to bn a house
less wanderer at the South, his family
having all been swop from him by
disease, and bis property by fire. Old
Tyler’s plantation near Hampton, doub -
less shared thu fate of must, of the others
in that vicinity, the drunken Magrnder
having destroyed the town hy lire, in i
midsummer, on the plea hat he Union I
troops might occupy it, for Winter quar- [
lets I —ho full into disgrace, and has
been sent into exile amongst the wild j
i Indians in Arkansas, bu. between his!
| ravages and the devasta ions which fol
! low all large armies, poor old Tyler’s
( proper.y has been pretty thoroughly
destroyed, and he himself has gone to
give an account to a higher than any i
can lily tribunal. Old Wise has lost in
death his favorite son : he himself is
held in contempt, aud in his old Vir
ginia, whore ho was ever accus umed to
make a swell, and to command attention,
either by bis arrogance, his impudence,
or his tergiversations, ho is now a mere
cypher, despised by his old associates,
spurned hy those who were formerly
lick-spittles, given the cold shoulder hy
ihe cotton oligarchs who arc now lord
ing it over the F. F. V’s., who have
virtually placed him and the thief Floyd
on the shelf, as of no further use to
•hem—alas I how are the mighty fallen.
Old Mr. Ruffin, too, >lie cynic, who
obtained the honor of firing the firs shot
ar the old flag on Sumter's heigh s, and
visited Charleston for slie purpose, has
seen the palatial residence of his family,
on the James River, represented to
have cost a million dollars in its erec
tion and adornings, destroyed by Me-
CK Han as a military necessity, but a
few days before tbe emanation of our
army from that vicini y, and the poor
old man has probably been reduced to
beggary. Thompson, the Secretary of
the interior under the imbecile Buchan
an, and who wi Ii Cobb and Floyd, plot
ted all the mischief in their power
against the Government they had sworn
to snppor, ; he ion, has rccen ly felt,
oven on Ins far off plantation in Missis
sippi, some of the horrors of war which
he had done so much to bring upon the
country—lit lo did he think during his
midnight plot.logs with the other con
spirators, that the hand of retribution
would reach him , in his far off and
beautiful home in the interior of his
State, but lie has had it shown to him,
that Ihe way of transgression is hard,
and that iLitre is an over-ruling Power
above, whose decree to fallen man is,
tha" whilst ho is a God of mercy, he
will in no wise clear ihe guilty.—
'i honipson’s plantation has been recently
visited, in one of the excursions of the
gonboa s and military expeditions into

“ They know (says Jackson) that a

j enemies have beheld our prosperity with

i doctrines, and they will point to our
I discord wi h the triumph of malignant

Such was the warning voice of the

j words of his prophecy been fulfilled, let

“Chalk Your Bobbins.’’
Every one knows that old Sir Robert
Peel, father of the late Prime Minister
of England, and grandfather of the
present baronet, made his money by the
eo ton spinning, in the caily part of
Itis career his business was not remarka
bly extensive, bu suddenly he made a
tremendous start, and soon distanced ali
his rivals' lie grew immensely rich, as
we all know, hut we do not all know the
lucky accident to which ho was indebted
I for his enormous wealth.
In he early days of cotton spinning
machinery a great deal of trouble used I
!to bo caused by 4il imonts of an ton |
adhering to the bobbins or tapes which |
then formed portions of looms. Those |
filaments accumulating, soon clog- !
god the wheels and othor parts of .he
machinery, and rendered it necessary
j that they should ho cleared, wbieh invol
i veil frequent stoppages and much loss of
I tinm
The great desidcra um was to find out
i some plan of preventing this clogging
by ilie cotton, and Sir Robert, .Mr. Peel,
as lie was then, spout vast sums in ex
perituon s. He employed some of the
ablest niachinests in the kingdom—among
hem James Watt —who suggested vari
ous corrections ; but spite of all they
could do, the inconvenience remained—
the cotton would adhere to the bobbins,
and the evil appeared to be insurmount
able.
Of course these delays seriously affect
ed the wages of the operatives, who on
■Saturdays generally came short in pro
portion to the s oppages during the pre
vious days. It was noticed, however,
that one man always drew his full pay,
his work was always accomplished ; in
fact, his loom never had to stop, while
every other in the factory was idle.—
Mr. Peel was informed of this, and knew
there must be a secret somewhere. It
was impor ant that it should bo discov
ered, if possible.
The man was watched, but all to no
purpose ; his fellow workmen tried to
‘•pump” him, but they couldn’t : at last
Mr. Peel sent fur the man into his pri
vate office.
lie was a rough Lancnnsliire man,
unable to aead or write ; little better,
indeed, than a mere animal. Ho entered
the presence pulling his forelock and
shuffling on the ground with his great,
clumse.y wooden shoes.
“ Dick,” said .Mr Pool, “ Ferguson,
ihe ovef-looker, tells me your bobbins
are always clean, is that so I ” ~*
“ Eo’s master, ’t be.”
“ Well, Dick, how do you manage it;
Lave you any objection to lot mo know
Why, mas er Pill, ’t be a soiirt of .
sacct loike, ye see, and if 01 told, t*
o beis ’il know’s modi as oi,” replied
Hick, with a cunning grin
“ Of course, Dick, I’ll give you some
ihing if you'll tell we—and if yon can
make all the looms in the factory work
as smooth as yours.”
“ Ev'ry one ’u them, master Pill ”
“ Well, wbat shall 1 give you ?
Name your price, Dick, and lot mo have
| your secrc:.”
j Dick grinned, scratched and shook his
I groat bead, and shuffled for a few minu
-1 tes, while Mr. Peel anxiously awai cd
I bis reply. The co ton lord thought his
i servan would only ask a hundred pounds
i or so, which ho would most willingly
have given him. Presently Dick said ;
“ Well, master Pill, I’ll tell 'ee all
! about i', if you’ll give rue a quart o’
1 beer a day as long as I’m iu the mills—
youll’ll save that ten.”
Mr. Peel rather thought ho should,
and quickly agreed to the terms.
“ Yon shall have it, Dick, and a half
gallon Sunday into the bargain.”
“ Well, then,'’ said Dick, first look
ing cautiously around to see that no one
was near—“ this it bo” and putting his
lips close to Mr. Peel’s car, lie whisper
ed ; “ Chalk your bobbins!”
That indeed was the great secret.—*
Dick had been in the habit of furtively
chalking his bobbins, which simple con- 1
trivanoe had effectually proven ed tho \
| adhesion of the cot.on. As ihe bobbins
j were white, the chalking escaped dblec- I
i lion.
j Mr. Peel was a sagacious man, and
j saw through iho whole affair a' a glance. 1
tie at once patented the inwon ion—had
(“chalking” much incry contrived, and i
I soon took tiie lead in the cot.on spinning
department This was ihe foundation;
of his princely fortune. It i, hut right 1
to add that he pensioned off' Dick hand- ,
somely.
Teacher's Required To T.ilte the
Oath or Allegiance.
From tho Baltimore County Aduncate, i
of tne ’JOtli of November wo clip tho ful- |
lowing Resolutions requiring teachers of!
Public Schools in that county to take |
the oath of allegiance.— Onr School ;
Commissioners should require the same
hero and we doubt not some of ihe Cecil ;
| teachers would have to walk. Any man j
j or woman who assumes to be an alien, 1
being thus dcvilishcd by the airus of I
secession, should be dismissed from all
public employment.
“ We mentioned a few weeks ago that
(he Board of School Commissioners had
passed a resolution requiring Teachers
in certain cases to lake an oath of alle
giance. We now publish the Hesolu
,ions and Oath.
Whereas, This Board has satisfactor
ily information that in several instances
Teachers in ihoir employ have openly j
avowed disloyalty to iho Gov&nmeiK
under which they live and through which
they receive their support, and have
declared their sympathy wi h the Rebel
armies which lately invaded this Sta o.
Be it Besot cel, That from this date,
it shall bo the duty of each Commission
er before appointing a Teacher to tho
charge of any school in his District, to
require the applicant to make oath of
allegiance to tbe following form, in the
presence of a Justice of the Peace for
Baltimore County.
2. Resolved, That Teachers now in
the employ of this Board, known by the
Commissioner of the Dis net in which
employed to be disloyal to tho Govern
ment of those Uni ed States, or reported
by throe respectable persons, pa rons of
lie school, to bu in sympathy with exist
ing rebellion, or to have publicly used
reasonable language, or to have allowed
i in school any demons ration of disloyalty
!by word or deed, shall bo required to
' take the above oath, and upon refusing
so to do, shall be dismissed, and tbe sal
! ary paid only lo the day of dismissal.
3 Resolved, That the Committee on
examination of Teachers bo ordered to
require each appliean fur a teacher's
certifies e, to take the required oath,
before being permitted to enter upon an
examination.
OATH.

allegiance to the United States, and sup
port and sustain the Constitution and
laws thereof; that 1 will main ain the

Keeping Morses in Winter.
j The first ibing of importance is a good
stable, which siiould be warm, light, dry
' and well ventila cd. Each of thesu cou
di ions must be obseivcd to insure the
■ heat;h and comfort of the horse. The
i cold winds must not be permitted to
j blow upon biin, nor damp, foul air fill
: the stable. Let a plentiful supply of
pure air and light be admitted through
windows or blinds. The stable should be
11 feet long ami hi wide; mangers for
bay are preferable to racks, as the horses
are less liable to waste their hay by get
ting it under their feet. The manger
should be abou l d 4 feet high nest to the
s all, and 6 inches higher in front ; about
20 inches wide at the top, l-l at the bot
tom, and to extend to within 10 inches
of the floor, which will leave room be
neath fur the bedding' The top piece
| on both sides of the manger should bo 2
' inches thick, of hard wood, to prevent
the horse from gnawing. The feed box
should be in the right hand end of the
manger, and made of two inch hard wood
plunk ; 1U inches square is a good size
The partitions between the sialls should
be about 8 fee! long, and it is best to
have them so high in front that the
horses can not get their heads together.
When the horse is idle, two quar s
of oats given morning and evening, with
plenty of good hay, will keep him in
good condition. If corn is fed on the
ear, iwo or three common sized ears will
answer the same purpose, or three quarts
of corn and cob meal per day. If at
light or medium work, four quarts of
oa's, six cars of corn, or throe quarts of
corn and cob meal, should be given throe
times per day, with all the hay he wil
oat. If at hard labor, six qrarts of
oats, ten cars of corn, or four quarts of
corn and cob meal, will be required
Whole corn is not economical food for
horses, as much of it will pass through
them undigosicd ; but as it is used by
many farmers, I give directions for feed
ing it. In feeding new corn, care must
be taken not to give too much at first,
us it is very liable to give horses the
colic. Many, perhaps the major! y of
farm horses, in our part of the country,
are kept upon much less grain than this,
but they do not look as we desire our
horses should—fat, slock and comforta
ble, and alwuijs ready for service- Car
rots are very good for horses, and ins oad
of feeding grain alone, an cqmal quaii.-
ity of carrots may be substituted once a
day with great benefit. Hoots have a
tendency to keep the bowels loose, and a i
horse will thrive better and look much
better if carrots cun form a portion of
bis food. An occasional “ bran mash ”
is very good for the same purpose. To
make !;, scald four to six quarts of
shorts,add a little salt, and feed after it
lias cooled sufieiently. Horses should
be watered regularly, at least three times
per day, our rule is, water after eating
I in the morning, before eating at noon, 1
j and before eating at night.
•American jJgricuHunst.
Horn lo Cnok a Rabbit.—h, K. Palmer,
I Luzerne co., Pa., writes to the -American
i .Agriculturist ; At the present season, coun
try families, especially those which number
a trap-setting juvenile or two, are coming
into possession of various “small deer" of
this sort. Many question whether it is
“ worth while ” to dress and cook these
chance aqiiisitions. Plain housekeepers are
apt to he shy of wild game from the idea
that it requires some intricate process to
render it really excellent. Habits cooked
j in the following simple way are pronounced
j better than that great standard of compari
son —‘chicken.’ Prepare for stewing the
j same as with fowls, and after par-boiling,
change the water, adding salt. Three hours
steady stewing is not too much for an old
rabbit, the great point is to get it tender,
hut not ragged. When co.oked, add two
thirds of a teacup of butler, and stir in
while boiling, two tablespoonfuls of flour in
j a cup of water, then a little pepper Toast
lo surface brown, hut do not harden, three
slices of bread ; batter them freely while
hot, lay on the platter, and pour the slew
over them.

equally expert with a gun in bringing down
rabbits at home, or as a “ militia man ’’ on

her method of preparing arabhitas follows;
After skinning they are thoroughly freed
from blood with cold water. They are then
left over night in weak salt water, which is
poured oil' in the morning, and new salt
water added, in which they stand until ready
for cooking. This water is made just suit
enough to lit the flesh for eating. They are
then boiled until tender, when the meat is
taken out, and flour and butter, first rubbed
together, is stirred in, and well peppered,
and the whole poured over toast, upon
which the meat is laid. A few sprigs of
parcely added, improve the taste for many
persons.

THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.

1 Until branches of Congress mot mi
i Monday anil the Message of the Prcsi.
dent was read and appropriately refer
im. Want of space prevents ns giving
S *• entire in The IV/iig, and wc therefore
; omit (lie numerous topics discussed in i;,.
I and give that portion relating to “ Com
pensative Emancipation ” arid the negro
question generally. The President a ay.-.
On the 22J day of December last, a proc
lamation was issued by the Executive, a
copy of which is herewith submitted. In
accordance with the purpose expressed in
the second paragraph of that paper, I now
respectfully call your attention to what may
be called “Compensative Emancipation."
A nation may be said to consist ot its ter
ritory, its people, and its laws. The terri
tory is the onlv part which is of curtain
durability. •• One generation pas.-eth away
and another generation eontcih, hut tho
earth ahidclh lorever.”
It is of the first importance to duly con
sider and estimate this ever-enduring part.
That portion of the earth's surface which is
owned and inhabited by the people of lint
United Slates is well adapted to be the home
of one national family, and it is not w ii
adapted for two or more. Its vast extent
and its variety of climate and productions
are of advantage in this age for onv people,
whatever they might have been in former
ages.
Steam, telegraphs, and intelligence have
brought these to be nn advantageous combi
nation for cue united people. In the inaug
ural address, I briefly pointed tint the total
inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for dif
ferences between the people of the two suc
tions. I did so in language which I cannot
improve, and which, therefore, 1 beg leave
to repeat;
“One section of onr country believes
slavery is right, and ought to he extended,
while the other believes it is wrong and
ought not lo he extended- This is the only
substantial dispute. The fugitive slavi,
clause of the Conetlf nfionandthe law for the
siipprseision of tin; foreign slave trade are
each as well enforced, perhaps, as any laws
can ever he in a community where the tnon.i
sense of the people imperfectly supports tic
law itself. The great body of the peoph
abide by the dry legal obligations in both
cases, and a lew break over in each. 1 his
I think cannot he perfectly cured, and n
would be worse in both cases, After 1 the sep
arntton of the scctio.s, than before. '1 l.c
foreign slave trade, now imperfectly sup
pressed, would he ultimately revived with
out restriction in one section, w hile fugitive
slaves, now only partially surrendered,
would not be surrentfered at all by the other.
Physically speaking, wc cannot separate. —
We cannot remove our respective sections
from each other, r.o? build an impassabJ.-
wall between them. A husband and wild
may may be divorced and go out of tbo
presence and beyond the reach of each
other, but the dilfcrent purls ot our country
cannot Jo this. They cannot but remain
face to face, and intercourse, either amica
ble or hostile, must continue between them.
Is it possible, then, to make that interemtrsu
more advantageous or more satisfactory
sifter separation than bifuief tan aliens
make treaties easier than friends can make
laws? Can treaties he more faithfully
enforced between aliens than laws can he
among friends? Suppose you go to war.-
You cannot fight always, and when, after
much loss nn both .■■■’ s. and no gain oti
either, you cense lighting, the id. uhi-tii old
questions as to terms of intercourse aro
again upon you.”
There is no line, s'rail or crooked, suita
ble for a national boundary, upon which to
divide. Truer through from ea f to west
upon the line hot we n the five and lave
country, and wc shall find a "ul o more than
| one-third its IciiL'ib are riv •■ ■ ,■a■ vt ■ > bo
crossed, and populated, or -onn to lie pop
ulated, thickly upon la :h .oh -; whilo
nearly ail its icmaimug stnmgih are merely
surveyors’ lines over which people may
walk "back and forth without tiny emu-ions
ness of their presence. No pa--: files line
can be made any more dilltcuit to pa- -by
writing it down on paper or parchment an a
national boundary,
Tliu fact of separation, if it conics, gives up
on tliu part of the seceding section ti.u fugi
tive slave clause, along will) all other Const i
tmiomil obligations upon the section seceded
from, while I should expect no ticaty stipula
tion would ever be made to toko its place.—
But there is another dilliculty. The great
interior region, bounded east by lire Ail,:,
ghenk-s, north by the British dominions, west
by tliu Kooky Mountains, and south by tbo
line along which tiro culture of corn and cot
ton meets and which includes part of Virgin
ia, part of Tennessee, all ot Kentucky, (hi.i
Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Mi.
aonri, Kansas, lowa, Minnesota, ami the Ter
ritories ot Dakota, Nebraska, atal part of Col
orado, already has above ten millions of peo
ple, and will have fifty millions within (ili-v
yeai s. if not prevented by any political fully
or mistake. It contains more than one-third
of the country owned by the United States ;
certainly more than one million of tnnaru
miles. One-half us populous as Massachu
setts already is, it would time more than
seventy-live millions ot people. A glance at
the map shows that, territorially speaking, it
is the great body of the republic. The other
parts aro but marginal borders to it, the mag
hifleent region sloping west from the Kooky
Mountains to the I’aeilic being the deepest",
and also the richest, in undeveloped re
sources.
In the production of provisions, grains,
grasses, and all which proceed from them,
this great Interior region is naturally ono of
the most important in the world. Ascertain
from the statistics the small propor ion of Ihu
region which has as yet been brought into
cultivation, and also the Urge and rapidly
increasing amount of its products, and m
shall bo overwhelmed with the magnitude of
the prospect presented." And yet this region
has no sea coast—touches no ocean any
where. As part of ono nation its people m-.v
flud and may forever Hnd their way lo Eur- ;-u
by New York, to South America and Alika
by New Orleans, and to Asia by Sun I-’rar,, is.
co. lint separate onr common country ;t.'<>
two nations as designed by the present n .
lion, and every man of this great in;, :t,
region Is thereby cut oil from some on
more ot these outlets, not, perhaps, by a |
sical barrier, but by embarrassing and on
mis trade regulations ; and Ibis is true wher
ever a dividing or boundary line may l-„
3xed. l“lace It between thu now free and
slave country, or place it south of Kentucky
or north of Ohio, and still Ihu truth remains
that none south of it can trade to any port or
place north ol it, nor none north of it ran
trade to any port or place south of if, except
upon terms dictated by a government lor igu
to them.
These outlets, cast, west, and Jfinlh, an
indispensable to the well-being of the pm-plo
inhabiting and to inhabit this vast interior
region. Which of lire three may be tins best
is no proper question ; all nre belter than
i either, and all of right belong to litat pcmd.i
and to their successors forever. True t<>
themselves, they will not ask when a line or
Separation shall be, but will vow rather that
there shall bo no sncli line. Nor si • tbo
