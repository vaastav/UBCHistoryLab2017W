and called at tho consulate to see
him. His call at the Immigration

made at the Japanese Consulate when

unable to see him, so lie very cour

Applauds Presidents Message.
Thursday, December G.
"The President's message in re
gard to the naturalization of the
Japanese is fine, strong and I think
that it is high fine that some one
took this stand and upheld the honor
of our country." .
This was the remark made by
Governor Carter this morning in
response to a question asking what
he thought of the p blished accounts
of President Roosevelt's message to
Congress in regard to the Japanese.
He went on to say:
'I am heartily in accord with tho
proposition of offering a solution of
one part of tho Japanese trouble by
repealing tne law forbidding the nat
uralization rf the people of that
country. I had an illustration of how
this works a little while ago when a
Japaneso, a graduato of Cambrltlgc
University and who employed nearly
100 men near Tucson, Arizona, wish
ed to become a citizen and could not
on account ol tho law which declares
that all men are not free and equal.
"In r. latlon to tho "part of t-1'"
message concerning this Territory it
expresses views which I have held
for some time and which I expressed
in almost identical lunguago a fow
weeks ago in a letter to tho Pres!
dent. The letter was in connection
with the land situation hero and I
stated that the interests of the sugar
planters and the Territory wot
widely divergent and that on the one
side wo were-lookmg for a class of
peoplo here who would become per
manent residents and who would
.build up tho Territory. On the othor
hand the sugar plantdrs are looking
forward to nothing but tho money
which they may make. I said that
if the two interests could be brought
together it would mean that we" had
gone a great way toward tho solving
of our nlost important problem.
"I do not believe from what we
have received of tho message that
the President is dissatisfied with the
conditions here. I see no reason that
any one else should be. With the
bringing in of tho immigrants on the
Suvoric there has been a new step
taken, at least there has been a new
stop commenced. It will not be com
pleted for somo time but there is
overy reason to hope that it will be
successful There has been a greater
percentage cf Portuguese who have
become permanent settlers of this
country than of any other race.
"That is what wo want, permanent
settlers. The planters have spent
thousands of dollars iu bringing
laborers to the islands. Cau anyone
say that if they had kept the labor
that they had in tho first plnco they
would not be better off than they are,
not when they must continually re
plenish tho supply?
"Can anyone look back over the
record of our relations with China'
and see the solemn compacts, the
treaties winch have been broken and
disregarded and feel that the record
is one to be proud of? What of all
the talk of equality of men which is
broken down by cu act of Pongress?
The President has taken a most ad
mirable stand and I admire him more
than ever for it." Bulletin.
Europe And The Japan Question
While tho Japanese question raised
by the Sm Praneisco School Board
Is a swbj at interest to the Euro
pean pf ., it apparently sees not
hing very wrkntB m it, nor is there a
suggestion that the cause of the
trouble, the action of the Board of
Education is a ust cause for war.
Tlio following from the last issuo of
the Literary Digest which brings
the matter down to within a few days
of the openiug of Congress is of iu
terest:
Tho c'ause in tho Declaration of
Independence which avers that "all
men are created equal" isboingquot
cd derisively by the European press
in the comment on San Francisco's
exclusion of tho Japanese children
from tho schools whom tho white
children go. It was put Into that do
cument, thny remark, to prove that
tho Americans were as good as the
British, but it has never since then
availed to prove that anybody oho is
as good as tho American. T!io Jnpa
ncso may put this to tho proof somo
day In a very unpleasant way, several
writers intimate, butitdoes notse'.'ui
to be genorally expected by the press
of Europe that this time is at hand.
The Paris Figaro treats the race
matter witli levity and nsks:
"Do the North Americans wish to
abolish tho rainbow? Red Indians,
negros, yellow Asiatics, all the colors
are to be banished from the soil of
the United States. Putting out of
question the black and the red, here
wo find the Japcnese protesting
against the somewhat rude and ex
clusive usages of tho Americans. The
Chinese have already complained.
Chino'sc students, etc., even a mem
ber of the Chinese Legation, were
detained at Ellis Island as eonlies."
The writer adds that as the Chinese
retaliated by a boycott, the Japanese
may do likewise. lie things, how
ever, that "a little patience and good
temper may arrange tho present
difficulty, although '"the United
States and Japan will sooner or later
have to settle-their accounts in the
Pacific." The Frankfurter Zoitung
says that, if matters are not adjust
ed "what the Americans hnvo to fear
Is a boycott" or even worse, for, in
the words of tho German paper:
"The Philippines present on entic
ing object to the oyes of Japan, and
it is believed in the United States
that Jppin's mouth Is watt ring for
the islands. There are only 20,000
American soldiers In the archipelago,
a quite insufficient force to protect
it. America's only means of defend
ing it is her Meet. She has only fifteen
ships of various clasSesin the Pacific,
so that it is easily to be understood
why the protest of the Japanese Am
bassador should make Washington a
little nervous.
Tills view is echoed by the Koinische
Zeituhg, which, w.alo expressing Its
sense of Mr. Roosevelt's "justice and
anxiety to preserve good commercial
relations with Japan," concludes that
"unless America can succeed in
pacifying Japan, she will find herself
In a very perilous situation."
But though Japan 'Ms on fire," de
clares .the Journal dts Dobats, she
will not fight, "at least immediately ."
Japan," says the London Spectator,
"has taken the affair iu the bast
spirit, realizing at once the good iu
tentions and tho helplessness of the
United States Government," and The
Saturday Review (London) is confi
dent that "tho trouble between Japan
and tho United States does not seem
likely in Itself to lead to any serious
conflict." Tho London Times thinks
a Japanese boycott will bo the worst
outcome that can be expected to tho
complication. Star.
Planters should Pay Better.
"I Uiink it would ho well' If labor
horo wore paid a little better," said
United States Commissioner-General
of Immigration F. P. Sargent .this
morning. "I see no reason why,, the
plantations of Hawaii cannot offer
hotter wages to their field labor.
"In regard to this projected im
portation of labor for Hnwallan plan-.
tations from tho PhVllppinosf I bo-
liovo that Hawaii can get all the
good immigration she needs from
else whore and all the labor she wants
without looking to tho Philippine Isl
ands for assistance.
"The Philippines have their own"
development to look out for nnd their
own labor problems to solve and those
Islands need all they can get in tho
wav of good labor and probably do
not welcome tho idea of Hawaii try
ing to take away good labor. Besides,
what might provo to bo very good
labor in tho Philippines might not bo
so suitable for Hawaii and, as I have
already said, there are other sources
for Hawaii to look to and we can got
all the good Europeans wo want.
"If we want to build up Hawaii's
population In the right, manner wo
should not be bothering with the Fili
pinos Get Europeans and pay them
better wages than are now being of
fered. It will pay the planters and
it will pay the Territory in tho long
run." Star.
