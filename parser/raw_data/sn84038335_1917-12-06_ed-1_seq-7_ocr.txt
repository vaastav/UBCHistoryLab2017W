the difference between the .$4 the
thrift stamps represent and the
current value of a war savings'
stamp, which in December, 1917,1
and January, 1918, will bo $4.12,1
and thereafter 1 cent, for each,
succeeding month during the vear.
1918.
With the first, war-savings
stamp obtained by purchase or
exchange the owner is given a I
war-savings certificate contain-j
ing spaces for twenty war-sav
ings stamps. If the twenty spaces I
are filled during December, 19 17,
or January, 1918. the cost to the
purchaser will be *4.12 for each
stamp, or $82.40 for the full cer
tificate, and on the first day of
January, 1923, I,lie government,
will redeem the certificate at *100
giving the holder a net profit, of
$17.60 for the use of his money.
Although these investments do
not mature until January 1, 1923,
provision is made whereby upon
ten "days' written notice after
January 1, 1918, such certificates
will be redeemed by postmar.lers
at their cost to the purchasers,
plus one cent a month on each
war-savings stamp on the certif
icate.
The thrift, stamps do not bear
interest, but the war-savings
stamps bear 4 per cent, com
pounded quarterly.. The certifi
cates will -be dal.'d .January 2,
1918, and mature January 1, -192:1.
Under-'the plan aft amount as

The- stamps and certificates
can be obtained from post offices,
banks, or trust companies, at
most railroad stations, slims,

places.-
Having the entire wealth oi the
United 'States back ol them, and
being redeemable as above, slated,
there is no danger of any depre

declared emphatically for a peace bas

The message follows:

"Rut the fact that a wrong use has

why a right use should not be made oT

said again that autocracy must first be

Final ^nd Convincing Lesson.
"You cut eh with we, the voices of
humanity that are in the air. They
"row daily more audible, more articu
late, more persuasive, and they come
from the hearts of men everywhere.
Tliey Insist that the war shall not end
in vindictive action of any kind that
-no nation or people shall he robbed or
punished because the irresponsible
rulers of a single country have them
selves done deep and damnable wrong.'
It is this thought that has been ex-.
pressed in the formula 'No nnnexn-.
tions. no contributions, no punitive in
demnities.' Just because this crude
formula expresses the instinctive Judg
ment as to right of phi In men every
where, it has been made diligent use
of by the masters of (iermati intrigue which must heneeforth .guarantee the
to lead the people of Kussia nsiruy— world's peace. -That partnership must
and the people of every country their 1 be a partnership of jieoples. not a mere
Not Again to Be Trusted.
"The worst that can happen to the
German people is this, that if they
should still, after the war Is over,
continue to be obligated Ao live under
ambitious and intriguing masters in
terested to disturb the peace of the
world, men or classes of men whom the
other peoples of the world eoutd not
trust, It ruight be impossible to admit
them to the partnership of nations
partnership of governments. It might
be Impossible, also, In such untoward
clrcumsiancps, to admit Germany to
tile free economic intercourse which
must inevitably spring out of the other
partnerships of a real peace. Hut
there would be no aggression in that
and such a situation, inevitable be
cause of distrust, would in the very
nature of things sooner or later cure
itself, by processes which would as
suredly set in.
Wrongs Must Be Righted.
"The wrongs, the very deep wrongs,
commuted thisivill have lotrlie
righted. That of course, lint they
cannot and must not be righted by the
commission of similar wrongs against
Germany and her allies.

were lb/' trij'-esi vesterdav ol the
winr with Austria-Hungary. Does
!t
seem strange to you that this should
he the conclusion of the argument I
have just addressed to you? It is not.
It is in fact the inevitable logic of
what I have said. Austria-Hungary Is
for the time being not her own mis
tress. but simply the vassal of the
German government. We must face
the facts as tliey are and act upon
them without sentiment in this stern
business. The government of Austria
Hungary is not acting upon its own
initiative or in response to the wishes
and feelings of its own jieoples, but as
the instrument of another nation. We
mast meet its force with our own and
regard the central powers as but one.
The war can he successfully conducted
iu 110 other way. 8|gg»
As to Turkey and Bulgaria.?J§f!
"The same logic would lead also to
a declaration of war against Turkey
and Bulgaria. The.v also are the tools
of Germany. But they are mere tools
and do not yet stand iu the direct path
of our necessary action. We shall go
wherever the necessities of this war
carry us. but It seems to me that we
should go only where Immediate and
practical considerations land us and
not heed on.v others.
"The financial and military meas
ures which must be adopted will sug
gest themselves as the war and Its un
dertakings develop, but I will take the
liberty of proposing to you certain
other acts of legislation which seem
to me to be needed for the support of
the war and for the release of our
whole force und energy.
"It will be necessary to extend In
certain particulars the legislation of
the last session with regard to alien
enemies and also necessary, I be
lieve, to create a, very definite and
particular control over 1he entrance
and departure of all persons into and
from the United States.
"Legislation should be enacted de
fining as a criminal offense every willful
violation of the presidential proclama
tions relating to alien enemies promul
gated under section 4007 of the Ile
vised Statutes aud providing appropri
ate punishments and women as well
as men, should be Included under the
terms of the acts placing restraints
upon alien enemies. It is likely that
as time goes 011 many alien enemies
will be willing to be fed and housed
aJ the expense of the government in
the detention camps, and it would he
he purpose of legislation I have sug
gested to confine offenders among
llieni in penitentiaries and other sim
ilar institutions where tliey could be
made to work as other criminals do.
Go Further In Fixing Prices.
"Itecenl experience has convinced
me that the congress must go further
in authorizing the government to set
limits to prices. The law of supply
aud demand, I am sorry to say. has
been replaced by the law of unrestrain
ed self!-hn.'ss. While we have elim
inated profiteering 111 several branches
of industry. It still runs Impudently
rampant iu others. Tin* farmers, for
Example, complain with a great deal of
justice. 1h.1t while the regulation of
!i».il prices restricts their Incomes, 110
restraints are placed upon the prlieos
of most of the things the.v must them
selves purchase, uml similar iiibi'.ii'ies
obtain on all sides.
"It Is Imperatively necessary that the
consideration of the full use of t.h»
at-the very outset the sympathy and! wuU'r power of the country and also
consideration
enthusiasm of th" Hunlau peoplu
iiifghi have been once #0* all enlisted
on tile side of the allies, ausplelon and
distrust '"Jwepr a way, and a real and
laetiiig tiiiion of purpose effected. Had
th»y believed these things at the very
moment el their revolution and had
they been cpnflrmcd In that belief
•••Ince, the sad reverses which have re
cently marked the progress of their
affairs towards an ordered and stable
tlie consideration of the systematic
and yet economical development of
such of the natural resources of the
country as are still under the control
of the federal government should lie
ftpnuediately resumed and atliriiialively
alnd constructively dealt with at the
earliest possible moment. The press
ing need of such legislation Is dully be
ieonting more obvious.
A Word to the Lawmakers.
"The legislation proposed at the last
session with regard to regulated com
binations umong our exporters, in or
der to provide for our foreign trade a
more effective organization and metli
•od of co-operation, ought by all means
to be completed at this session.
"And I beg that the members of the
"house of representatives will permit
me to express the opinion that it will
lie impossible to deal in any but a very
wasteful and extravagant fashion with
1 he enormous appropriations of the
public moneys which must continue to
be made, if the war Is to he properly
sustained, unless the house will
sent to return to Its former practice
of initiating and preparing ail appro
priation bills through a single commit
tee, in order th«t responsibility may
be centered, expenditures standardize,!
and made uniform and waste and du
plication as much as possible avoided.
"Additional legislation may also be
come necessary before the present con
gress again adjourns In order to effect
the most efficient co-ordination and op
eration of the railway and other trans
portation systems of Hie country: but
to that I shall, if circumstances should
demand, call the attention of the con
gress upon another occasion.
Concentrate on Winning War.
"If I have overlooked anything that,
ought to be done for the more effective
conduct of the war, your own counsels
will supply the omlsslou. What I am
perfectly clear about Is that In the
present session of the congress our
whole attention and energy should he
concentrated on the vigorous, rapid
and successful prosecution of the great
task of winning the war.
