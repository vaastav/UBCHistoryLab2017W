1898 BREAKS THE RECORD.
IT is customary in trade to base comparative con
ditions on the heaviest previous business year until
a new record-breaker occurs, when that, in turn,
it taken as the basis. These record-breaking years
occur every now and then and are dispersed along the
commercial highway of the country like so many mile
stones, and are commemorative of exceptionally pros-
perous times. For several years past the year 1892
has been the basis of comparison, as that year made
• the best average up to the present time. But we are
now told by those whose business is to collate com
mercial statistics that hereafter 1898 will be the basic
year. It seems rather odd to us in Califronia that
1808, which has been our "dry year," should have
been the most prosperous in the country's history,
but if we are to beheve the figures of the commercial
statisticians, it has broken the record in the volume
of trade, though it is behind other years in the plane
of values. In other words, prices have been low, but
the amount of business has been very large.
If this be really true, it destroys the popular theory
that war is destructive to business, for during four
months of the year the United States was engaged in
an expensive war with Spain. Indeed, it was observed
throughout the whole course of the war that outside
of Wall street the business of the country was hardly
affected by the war, one way or the other, and The
Call pointed out at the time that a foreigner might
travel from one coast of the country to the other with
out knowing that a war was in progress if he could
be kept away from the newspapers. The foreign and
internal trade of the nation went on as usual, and the
people were as tranquil as a cow chewing her cud.
A? the year goes out certain favorable conditions
are apparent. The iron and steel trade are excited
over the placing of orders for from 500.000 to 700,000
tons of steel rails — more than 25 per cent of the coun-
try's annual production — at prices which, though not
too satisfactory to manufacturers, indictate a stable
cc ndition of the trade. The boot and shoe business is
looking up, leather is steadier and hides are higher,
and the early advent of winter in the South has
caused a marked improvement in the cotton market.
The exports of flour and wheat from Atlantic ports
last week were 7,484,000 bushels, against 6,500,000
bushels for the same week last year. The lumber
trade seems to be improving, and the recent advance
in prices is maintained, while reports from the pro
ducing districts show that the heavy output has been
satisfactorily handled. The general jobbing trade of
the country has been checked here and there by se
vere storms, but this is transient and incidental to the
season. . The sales of wool in November were 39,875,
000 pounds, against 34,122,000 for the same week last
year, but they were effected only by concessions on
the part of sellers. Manufacturers of woolen goods re
port rather larger orders, and the general opinion is
that the. 'wool trade has seen its worst days, though
ho marked improvement in prices is looked for un
til the present enormous stocks become materially re
duced. The failures last week were 281, against 306
for the same week in 1897, while the record for the
month of November is said to be the best in this re
spect in the history of- the country, and shows a grati
fying condition of financial soundness. The bank
clearings continue to show a gain over those of last
year, the increase last -\»eek being 15.8 per cent. The
uncertainty connected with the Peace Commission
unsettled Wall street during the early part of the
week and led to some selling of our securities by for
eign holders, but that was a mere passing cloud. On
the whole the country seems to be going out of the
year with flying colors.
Locally there is little new. The lack of rain still
hangs like a cloud over the State, and while last
week's shower helped the pasturage in the northern
part, the San Joaquin Valley and the southern portion
of the Sta'e derived little benefit from it. Aslongasthe
dry weather lasts the interior banks and merchants
will be indisposed to advance seed to farmers, and
this acts as a drawback to business generally. What
the State needs more than anything else at the mo
ment is a good soaking rain, and when it comes there
will be a general unloosening of purse-strings all along
the cqmmercial and .agricultural line. There is no
contraction of credits anywhere, and money is in
abundant supply at the regular rates of interest, but
capitalists, both individual and corporate, are dis
posed to go slowly until they are satisfied of favorable
results from their advances.
The tendency of prices during the past week was
generally favorable, to ferjaie'rs. .. There was no decline
i\\ any Article ofproduce^ and several advanced. There
is very •little speculation St: -t.be foment, and business
js proceeding on conservative and safe lines.

THE WORK BEFORE CONGRESS.
AS a rule comparatively little important legisla
tion is undertaken at the short session of Con
gress. That which is to be held this winter,
however, may prove an exception to the rule. Cer
tainly there are gr,eat issues to be ddeafl f with. The
fact that the Senate is not fully under the. control of
sound money men may prevent any attempt to enact
a. currency reform bill, but with that exception there
is hardly any important measure of needed legisla
tion that might not be accomplished this winter.
Some of these measures, like that providing for the
construction of the Nicaragua canal, have been long
before the public. Others like the proposed legisla
tion for the promotion of American shipping have
been given an increased importance by reason of the
rapid expansion of our commerce, which is now car
ried on in foreign ships. Still others, like the demand
for the establishment of a parcels post, are new. All
of them, however, are supported by a strong popular
sentiment, and it is reasonable to expect that at least
some of them will be provided for by .the legislation
of the session.
The action of Congress will undoubtedly be largely
puided by the message of the President. It is re
ported he will recommend an increase of the army
and the navy, the construction of the Nicaragua
canal, a careful consideration of th: policy to be
adopted with regard to the government of Cuba,
Porto Rico and the Philippines, but will not recom
mend any financial reform at this time.
While these reports are more or less authentic, they
will not in any way detract from public eagerness to
read the message itself. Mr. McKinley is a conser
vative statesman, well fitted to direct the affairs of the
nation at this critical juncture. It is still freshly re
membered how he saved the country from committing
the blunder of recognizing the so-called Cuban re
public, and the people have, therefore, ample confi
dence that his abilities and his patriotism will enable
him to settle up all the issues and responsibilities
growing out of the war with Spain without commit
ting the United States to any policy adverse to its
highest interests. ' . :,
Certainly Congress assembles for its short session
at a very critical period of our history. It is likely
to be marked by debates o- the highest themes that
can engage the attention of statesmen, for such will
be those involved in devising a government for
Hawaii and for the islands freed by our arms from
Spanish tyranny. We shall see what our Senators
and Representatives can s do with the great oppor
tunity before them.
NEW YORK BEATS LONDON.
A HAPPY coincidence has brought it about that
the year in which the United States first re
vealed themselves* to other nations as a great
world power of commanding naval and military pres
tige should also be marked as the year when for
the first time New York outranks London as a com
mercial city. The commercial triumph is, in fact,
the more surprising of the two. No one ever doubted
that we could sweep the Spanish from the seas and
drive them from the colonies they misgoverned, f bu^
it was not at all expected that the honor of being; the
world's commercial metropolis would be shifted from
London to New York before the year was over.
The figures and reports on which the claim of New
York for supremacy are based are official. Mr. Van
derlip, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, is quoted
as having said recently that the annual report of the
Commissioner of Navigation would show the total
value of London's trade in 1895 was $i,i23.59i;630t
New York's showing for the same period was $803,
321,190. In the following year New York gained
$137,980,338, while London advanced only about $27,
000,000. In 1897 the figures for New York were $976,
898,235, a decrease from the preceding year, while
London showed another slight gain. But 1808 has
proved a banner year. Exports of merchandise have
advanced fully $450,000,000, a greater gain than has
been shown by any preceding twelvemonth. Imports
of merchandise have not advanced, but there have
been heavy imports of gold to put the figures up. Al
together New York's foreign trade for 1898 will not
be less than $1,300,000,000, while that of London is
computed at $1,202,207,847.
Of course the contest will be close for some years
to come, and the fortunes of trade will vary. London
will be ahead one year, and New York another, but in
the end the advantage of New York will be so great
that mere temporary fluctuations and changes in the
commercial world will not affect her supremacy. She
will be in the near future what London has been for
so many years of the past, the commercial metropolis
of the world.
It is safe to say that if ever New York loses the
supremacy she has now attained the loss will be due
tc the opening up of the Orient and the development
of great commercial cities on the Pacific. San Fran
cisco in this respect is the child of destiny. The in
dustrial progress of the United States has brought
the mercantile center of the earth to our Atlantic
coast, and the progress made in the Far East may
bring it to this coast at a time much earlier than is
now expected.
THE BRIGHT SIDE OF A BLIZZARD.
RARELY has that vigorous and buoyant Ameri
can optimism which with a "frolic welcome
takes the sunshine and the storm" been better
illustrated than in the comments of the New Yofk
Mail and Express on the recent fearful storm that
swept over the whole country from the Dakotas to the
Atlantic coast. Our contemporary not only saw a
bright side to the blizzard, but found it so radiant
that it burst into a rhapsody of sparkling prose.
The storm, it will be remembered, was one of the
severest of recent years. Upon land and sea the de
struction of property and the loss .of life were great.
The Mail and Express itself describes it as "a grand
all-star combination of cyclone and blizzard." One
storm wind started from the south and the other from
the far west. The two united in New Jersey,' and
from there made a swift and terrible advance. Way
farers caught in the blizzard were frozen on the high
ways, many destitute persons died of the cold in their
unwarmed tenements, and on the sea the number of
wrecks was appalling.
After viewing and reviewing all these disasters the
Man and Express cheerfully advised its readers next
morning after the storm to turn "from these distress
ir.gr recitals to contemplate the beauty touches which
the great cyclonic blizzard has given to the visible
world." As an inducement to a study of these beauty
touches the genial and irrepressible optimist said:
"The storm king is a scenic painter of surpassing
genius. With his airy brush and his wealth of wjiite
he has given the outlines of castles and palaces and
fairy dwellings to the monotonous structures reared
by man. The trees, decked with feathery plumes and
glittering icicles, are like giant flowers from some en
chanted clime, and the distant hills loom skyward as
if they were terraced banks of habitable clouds. All
of which means that it was a royal storm, gorgeoifs
and beautiful, fitly heralding the approach of the ex
hilarating delights of winter."
Californians will not begrudge the East such win

ter delights* and if the people there find them ex
hilarating, so much the better. There is no
accounting for tastes. We can hardly re
frain from something of envy, however, for
the cheerfulness of the happy liar who,
after the passing of a blizzard, can rise up and swear
that he likes it. Every American has the nerve to
boast of the prevailing weather of his locality, and
declare the climate to be unsurpassed, but they are
few indeed who can survey the work of a winter
blizzard and shout with rapture, "It was a royal
storm, gorgeous and beautiful."
WHATEVER ground a woman may have for
complaining that her natural "rights" are de
nied her, when she turns criminal the basis of
her' logic fails. As a criminal she has privileges no
male could think of claiming. She is apt to be re
garded as a heroine. At least she arouses a maudlin
sympathy and escapes punishment. As to her privi
lege of slaying the man who may have wronged her,
or have been simply her companion in evil, no serious
question arises. ' There may be an arrest, a perfunc
tory performance at court, which is merely a trial of
patience and a waste of time. Under present condi
tions in cities around the bay any woman may kill
any man she feels an impulse to kill, and fear no
penalty more serious than her conscience can mete
out.
In direct defense of her honor, as of her life, human
judgment would sustain any woman if she slew her as
sailant. No such circumstance has marked the numer
ous murders committed here by women. Usually they
have been cold-blooded, deliberate, and so without
excuse, that, with the tragedy reversed, the woman the
victim, the man the assassin, the gallows would have
been the end for him. The plain citizen does not
crave the probability of being eliminated from the
material world even by the gentle hands celebrated for
a natural tendency to rod: the cradle rather than press
a trigger.
Since the execution of Durrant, the monster who
was hanged after a three years' fight, the law against
murder has seemed in a degree effective. There has
grown up a restraining habit of dropping thugs and
killers through the trap, reforming the individual and
making him useful as an example. No similarly be
nign influence has been brought to bear upon the
woman homicidally inclined. She has been taught
that she has nothing to fear from any violence, and
that a fit of hysteria and a gush of timely tears will
wash away her guilt. This is not fair to either sex.
If the Shattuck woman had been hanged, as she
richly deserved, for luring Harry Poole into ambush
and shooting him, the man-killing habit would not
have taken so firm a hold upon femininity. But this
woman, heartless, brutal and cunning, was not pun
ished. On the contrary, the court permitted her to
go, for the District Attorney, having convicted her
once, saw the futility of undertaking the farcical pro
ceeding again. Her sentence in the first place had
been twenty-five years, yet there was not about her
deed the first color of justification. The only woman
who has been punished was Mrs. Worthingtcm. Pen
niless, friendless, weak in mind and body, gpadefi to
"the act by her Husband, she excited' no sympathy, ihe
episode was not romantic nor the central figure a
beauty with lachrymal founts on tap. She did not
understand the science of applied hysterics. All the
rest of the list have escaped.
It is with no desire to appear harsh we call atten
tion to the recent tragedy in which the bride of a
month sought the presence of" her husband, Arst arm
ing herself, and sent a bullet into his heart andanpther
through his brain. She claims this was done in self
defense. If it was, the fullest opportunity should be
given her to prove it, and if it was not, if she sought
this man with intent to kill him, the penalty should
be as quick and as severe as it would have been for
him had he slain her. The mocking of justice has
continued too long, for the rustling of a skirt may
mark the approach of an assassin as truly as may the
stealthy tread of the midnight footpad. It is high
time for the distinction to be wiped out. The bullets
sped by the hand of a bride carried death with them.
How is such a deed less black because not the work
of a man?
Whatever fate may have in store for this self
created widow, it is certain that her career affords a
dreadful lesson to foolish girls. She had been mar
ried without parental consent. The husband was
perhaps in many respects her equal, but he was in
capable of providing for her, and this she knew. In
order to marry she was forced to lead a double life,
deceive her parents, and exist in a constant fear of
exposure. A marriage which must be kept as secret
as a thief keeps a robbery has in it no element of
good, and the girl becoming a party to it is treading
on dangerous ground along a path which can lead
only to disgrace.
There has as yet developed nothing to show that
either mentally or physically the man was the stronger
of the two. He did not seem as one who could in
fatuate and beguile. In these illicit alliances the
error cannot always be put upon the man, though for
his share of it he dwells in trembling fear and goes to
his grave. She has a share also. To hold her blame
less h a grievous wrong.
A girl who has the protection of a home does not
need to be protected by a pistol. When she resorts
to it, let the consequences be visited upon her.
A gentleman who was killed while on a hunting
trip it is now suspected shot himself deliberately,
since it is discovered that his life was heavily insured.
Needless to say, the insurance companies do the sus
pecting. To the average judgment the good that
money can do a dead man is hardly worth reaching
after.
Whether a woman has a right to kill a man who
happens to have acquired her ill will has come to be
a pressing question, and might as well be settled right
now. A man may be imperfect and yet commit no
capital offense, and a woman as executioner is out of
her element anyhow.
The Shenandoah arrived in port with a story of a
meteor which had flashed flamiag across the sky. and
a reporter recounted the yarn as a "long fiery tale."
Perhaps he did not mean to do this, but either the
scribe or the type machine was peculiarly honest.

WOMON (\S A CRIMINAL.
ENGLAND'S EDITORS IN DIRE DANGER.
The Author of the Immortal Words, "Not Simply .Hoisted, but Nailed "Till
Prosecute Them if They Say Anything Abouf^is Painful Old Con
tract With the Southern Pacific.
In this era of fraternity, when we are even talking of an alliance with
the British, our cousins over the sea will surely permit us a laugh at their
unconscious humor. They have heard there of the ''gale of the Examiner's
good will to the Southern Pacific, and the subjoined excerpts from the
Westminster Gazette Bhow how fully they have grasped the situation:
The Exnminer and the San. Francisco Call have for many year? added to the
gayety of the American press by their censelef* quarrtflings and bickerings. They
are perpetually flying at .one another's throat and sometimes nno and then the
other pets the upper hand. The Call is at present parformtng a. lively war
dance on the body of its rival. It alleges to have upearjhed a very pretty piece
of blackmail on the part of its rival, an. l its crowing is "particularly vociferous. It
flecltfrea that "William R. TT'earst. the proprietor of the Examiner, was at one
time promised $30,000 in Installments from the South Pacific Railway on the
understanding- that he would from that time consult the interests of the railway
and cease from all hostile criticism. This agreement was. signed in 1592 and for
a time, according to The Call, the Ronth Parifte and the Examiner had a
community of interests. Shortly after, however, the parties in this contract
quarreled, and although the affair was arranged at the time, the evidence of the
questionable transactions has now by some means passed into the hands of The
Call, which is not slow to rake th? ashos nf an old scandal on the head of its
rival. The text of the agreement has passed Into its hands and it :-. forthwith
gives it in full as follows, under the title of "The Purchase of Heargt:"
The company [Is to en.loy immunity from hostility tn th« oolumnß of the Examiner,
andl Is not to be the victim of malicious attack or criticism, or of misrepresentation:
that the Examiner will not seek to create hostile sentiment In the minds, of this" commun
ity against the Southern Pacific Company, or any of the interests It represent*, and that
while not stipulating as aralnst all criticism, it agrees that criticism Shall not proceed
from any motive of malice or malignity, ami that- mich criticism as may he found neces
sary to keep and maintain the confidence of the public to the- extent t{iat any public sen
timent may have been created from Other sources, is to avoided as much p.s possible.
Round the typewritten agreement, which purv>or+* to be a rough copy, are
scribbled the comments of the managers of the Examiner. One of thorn agrees
to the entire, document except a few w.prds in brackets. Another says that "cer
tainly nothing else . would be satisfactory," whjle a third a,sks, "How does this
conform to your understanding?"
Although more than six years old the document is still a very pretty cudgel
for one newspaper to belabor its rival with. Unfortunately the answer of the
Examiner Is not to hand.
Meanwhile The Call, with the view of slinging another bolt at its rival, has
published photographs of what in American sjp.ng is. ca.^ed thQ Examiner's cold
pig. This Is the colloquial expression, for the unsold returps p{ a newspaper,
and the cartload in the cruel photograph is meant gently to convey that the Ex
aminer has not such a big circulation after all.
The fun came In where the editor took It all back. He recanted on the
authority of Creelman, a correspondent whose aversion to the truth is paid
for at space rates. Possibly Creelman could tell the truth, but Indubita
bly he never does so. He was an accessory to the horrors of the war be
tween China' and Japan, creating most of them himself and portraying with
elaborate detail thrilling series' of events which never occurred. In Cuba
he conducted the campaign, the presence of the officers being wholly super
fluous and rather annoying. He was an eager target for Mauser bullets,
and told with much elaboration the sensations of a brave man under fire.
So when Creelman was Instructed to call upon the editor of the Gazette
and to tell him what was what the editor Imitated Davy Crockett's coon.
Creelman added this to universal joy:
To the Editor of the Westminster Gazette— Dear Sir: There is not a word of
truth In the statement published in your columns based upon the San Francis
co Call's charge that the San Francisco Examiner had many years ago made
an agreement with the Southern Pacific Railroad by which the proprietoror man
agers of the Examiner were, in consideration of a payment of a sum of money,
to refrain from hostile attacks on or criticism of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company. The whole story Is a pure falsehood uttered by the San Francisco Call,
which is a mouthpiece of the Railroad Company, which now bitterly attacks
the Examiner because the Examiner has for years maintained an ear
nest anti-corporation attitude. This railond and its allied "trusts" on the Pacific
Slope first sought to shield themselves from honest criticism by attempting to
crush the Examiner. They supported the Examiner's rival, excluded the Ex
aminer from the railroad trains, and exerted their Influence in every possible
manner, public and private, to silence it. These facts" are well known in the
United States, and are repeated here now simply to meet a statement calcu
lated to deceive people in England who aro not familiar with American af
fairs. The whole Pacific Slope has been for years in the grip of a corrupt
and tyrannical corporate clique, headed by the Railroad Company, which has
Inspired the attack to which you give eurrencv. The Examiner has led a pop
ular uprising apainst this despotic system. The railroad and its accomplices
failed in their efforts to crush the Examiner. They then tried to caiole it with
advertising and favors. Failiner in this they are now trying: to discredit it.
The Examiner is In no way affected by such an obviously false attack, and the
conspirators have had to go a loner way from San Francisco to find a newspaper
other than their willing organ willing to publish this stuff. The Examiner is brinsc
iner a suit aprainst The Call for libel and Judgment is assured. I am instructed by
cable by William R. Hearst, the proprietor of the Examiner, to deny specifically
every part of the story printed in The Call, and to hold to strict accountability
in the courts all persons who repeat it. Faithfully yours.
JAMES CREELMAN.
Temple Chambers, Temple avenue, E. C, November 14.
The editor was scared. The threat of libel fetched him. The ridiculous
folderol of Creelman, of course, could not be. understood In London. How
could they know there the Examiner was a discredited arid purchasable
sheet. Its virtue a jest and Its record a scandal? So the editor said this:
[We are very glad to publish Mr. Creelman's letter. Our paragraph was in
tended to bo asummaryof a newspaper controversy which has excited some in
terest in America, and we were careful to explain that the statements were ex
parte allegations subject to the answerof the other side. Mr. Creelman's letter
certainly puts an entirely different color upon the statements made In The
Call.-Ed. W. G.]
So he will not be sued for libel. Happy man. He wouldn't havQ been,
and couldn't have been, but the bluff worked well.
But Creelman had a pull with some other papers. He caused the Even
ing Dispatch of Edinburgh to fly to the rescue of Hearst as a man who
was opposed to the Southern Pacific, but he did not tell it that he was so
opposed because cut off from the payroll, a circumstance fully advertised out
here. The Echo also made comment displaying a childish ignorance of the
situation, and a sweet and simple faith In Creelman. The correspondent
wrote a communication in which he said — but why quote Creelman? There
are Aesop and Munchausen to draw on. Creelman was instructed to make
a general denial of the charge that Hearst had sold his toleration and he did
it. He forgot to. deny that the E-xamlner circulation is largely by way of
the garbage crematory, but still he did very well. "We congratulate Creel
man. In the world of fiction he holds a leading place, and is steadily
lengthening the lead.

At the Chatham dockyard the wages to
workmen for the week ending November
12 was $250,000. This amount exceeded the
average weeks' wages by $100,000, and was
due to the elaborate war preparations
which have necessitated considerable
overtime.
A submarine boat, the invention of an
engineer in Berlin, is shortly to be tried
officially by the German Admiralt- in the
harbor of Kiel. The boat carries only
three men and it has already been tried
t» the extent of three hours continuous
traveling under water at a denth of nine
feet.
The Russian coast-defense ship Aprak
sin has passed through a continuous
seven hours 1 trial under full power. The
contract called for 5000-horse power, but
the trial developed 6757. On the first trial
the engines fell short of the power and
the contractors were fined $14,400, which
now is remitted. The ship made 15.07
knots over the measured mile course in
four runs.
.An almost forgotten act of naval heroism
Is retold of Admiral Lyons of the British
navy. Lyons was a lieutenant. 21 years
of age, on the seventy-four-sun * ship
Mlnden In the East Indies, fighting the
Dutch. One of the strongholds was Fort
Marrack In Java, which the British cap
tain considered too strong to capture by
his force of 450 men. The fort mounted
64 guns and had a garrison of 800 soldiers
but Lyons conceived the idea that he
could capture it, and contrary to orders
he, with three midshipmen and thirty-one
sailors, effected a landing in two boats
made a dash against the fully prepared
fort and drove the soldiers out,. alter
which he spiked the guns and returned
to his ship with a lons of only three
wounded. His captain was furious an,!
Lyons narrowly escaped a court -murtlal
but when. the admiral of the Beet heard
of the exploit he promptly promoted T.lou
tenant Lyons and a few years later he
was made a captain.
A serious state of affairs Is reported on
board the British battleship Majestic ly
ing at Gibraltar. .In consequence- of the
ship's ! company having strewn >l on the
docks orange pool and other 'fruit debris
the order wan Riven that no frutt wa« to

FATHER OF THE AMERICAN
NAVY-EsK-k Hopkins of Rhode Island is
entitled to the name of "Father of the
American Navy." He was appointed
commander in chief of the navy, by the
'.-"ntinehtal Congress in 1775. In 177«. while
in command of the first colonial fleet, he
Lired the British ships Hawke and
Bolton. Ho was retired in 1777 for neglect
to appi ar before the naval committee on
a charge of unnrceH.sary delays.
SULU GROUP— E.. City. The Sulu
ground mentioned in the peace treaty be
tween the United States and Spain is an
archipelago pf mure than sixty islands in
Ufi Mindoro 6ea. between the Philippines
and Borneo. Qagayen Sulu. the largest of
the islands, is thirty-six miles long and
twelve wide. It contains the town of
Soong, the residence of the Sultan of the
group. These islands have a population of
about 150.000. Soong is in 66 degrees 1
minute north latitude, and 120 degrees 55
minutes and 51 seconds east longitude.
THE RUSSIANS AND OPALS— W. C.
D., City. The Russiar-* are very super
stitious in regard to opals. They believe
that this exquisite stone, with its fairy
light dancing over its delicate surface,
will bring tears to the *--es of the wearer.
No woman 6t rank will have an opa^ in
her jewel box. The merchant or the or
dinary shopper, if he boo" ■ see an opal,
will that day not make any purchases for
fear that ill luck will attend the pur
chase. The Russians fear the influence
of the stone, but they are unable to tell
why.
CAVEATS— H. C, City. The filing of
caveats is sometimes of great importance,
as it may be quickly done and affords Im
mediate protection against the issue, of a
patent without the knowledge of the
caveator. The object is to give the in
ventor time to perfect his invention. A
caveat consists of. a petition, specification,
drawing and affidavit of invention. The
fifing of a caveat does not secure any ex
clusive right of sale, the patent secures
that. If you have a valuable invention
and have to have a mgdel made, you
should first secure a caveat or place the
matter in the hands of a reliable agent.
You have a right to dispose of your in
vention to any one at any time.
MATCHES— S.. City. A number of per
sona have been najned as the inventor of
the phosphorus match. "Invention" says
that "it appears that the real Inventor
was a Hungarian, James Irinyi. When
he was a student, 19 years old. In 1835, he
attended the Polytechnic School at Vi
enna, and was a student of chemistry unv
der Professor Meissner. He becam a
greatly impressed by a demonstration o,\
the reaction produced by rubbing to
gether peroxide of lead and sulphur. It
struck him that the reaction might be
greatly intensified when substituting
phosphorus for sulphur. Irinyi was not
seen for several' days by .his fellow-stu
dents; but when he rejoined them he had
his pockets full of matches, which he
struck on the wall, all taking fire. He
sold his invention, it is recorded, to a
merchant named Romer for about $3500.
GEKMAN MILWAUKEE.
The theater, art and science have found
a home in the German city of America-
One German and three English theaters
offer to the public an abundance of varied
pleasures, and all eminent in intellect and
art are accustomed to stop in Milwaukee
on their American travels. A public li
brary, as well as a picture gallery and a
museum, offer gratuitous instruction to
every one. In the fall there is an annual
industrial and agricultural exhibition.
Which with each year receives a greater
abundance of contributions. Dozens of
German glee clubs and athletlu dissocia
tions, serve for social intercourse. As
might be expected, the English language
is used in the conduct of business, al
though at least from 50 to Go if not a
greater, per cent, of the people have com
mand of the German language, which is
taught in the public schools.
in almost every business, in nearly all
the commercial houses, which are for the
most part conducted by Germans, the
German language is used along: with the
English, and so ignorance of German is
regarded as great a fault as ignorance of
English, if not a greater one. Recently an
attempt was made to remove the German
language from the curriculum of the pub
lic Bchools. but the inquiry instituted for
this purpose produced a result very vexa
tious to the investigators. The over
whelming majority of the non-German
parents decided in favor of ha%'ing their
children taught the German language.
Thus Milwaukee, in this case also, nas
made good her reputation as, the Ger
man city of America.— Prom the Chau
