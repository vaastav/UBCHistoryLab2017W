TUESDAY EVENING
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Continued from Srst page
great matter and to avow my convic
tions with deep earnestness. I have
tried to know what America is; what
her people think, what they are, what
they most cherish and hold dear. I
hope that some of their finer passions
are in my own heart some of the
great conceptions and desires which
gave 'birth to this government and
which have made the voice of this
people a voice of peace and hope and
liberty among the peoples of the
world and that, speaking my own
thoughts, I shall at least in part,
speak theirs also, however faintly and
inadequately upon this vital matter.
We are at peace with all the world.
No one who speaks counsel based .on
fact or drawn from a just and candid
interpretation of realities can say thnt
there is reason to fear that from any
quarter our independence or the in
tegrity of our territory is threatened.
Dread of the power f( any other na
tion we are incapable of. We are not
jealous of rivalry in the fields of com
merce or of aiy other peaceful
achievement. We mean to live our
own lives as we will; but we mean
also to let live. We are indeed a true
friend to all the nations of the world,
because we threaten none, covet the
possessions of none, desire the over
throw of none. Our friendship can
be accepted and is accepted without
reservation, because it is offered in a
spirit and for a purpose which no one
need ever question or suspect. There
in lies our greatness. We are the
champions of peace and of concord.
And we should be very jealous - f
this distinction which we have sought
to earn. Just now we should be par
ticularly jealous of it, because it is
our dearest present hope that this
character and reputation may present
ly,, in God s providence, bring us an
opportunity such as has seldom been
vouchsafed any nation, the opportuni
ty to counsel and obtain peace in the
world and reconciliation and a' heal
ing settlement of many a matter thit
has cooled and interrupted the friend
ship of nations. This- is the time
above all others when we should wish
and resolve to keep our strength by
self-possession, our influence by pre
serving our ancient principles of ac
tion. From the first we have had a clear
and settled policy with regard to mil
itary establishments. We never have;
had, and while we retain our present
principles and ideals we never shell
have, a large standing army. If ask
ed, are you ready to defend your
selves? We reply, most assuredly,
to the utmost, and yet. we shall not
turn' America into a military camp.
We will not ask our young men to
spend -the best years of their lives
making soldiers of themselves. There
is another sort of "energy in us. It
will know how to declare itself and
make itself effective should occasion
arise. And especially when half the
world is on fire we shall be careful
to make our moral insurance against
the spread of the conflagration very j
definite and certain and adequate in-1
deed.
Let us remind ourselves, therefore,
of the only thing we can do or will
do. We must depend in every time f
national peril, in the future as in the
past, not upon a standing army, nor
yet upon a reserve army, but upon a
citizenry trained and accustomed to
arms. It will be right enough, right
American policy, based on our accus
tomed orincioles and practices, to
provide a System by which every citi-
zen who will volunteer for the train- I
ing may be made family wth the use
of modern arms, and the rudiments ,
nf Hritl nn,l maneuver, and the main-
tenance and sanitation of camps. We ,
should encourage such training and
make it a means of discipline which
our young men will learn to value
It is right that we should provide it
not only, but that we should make it
as attractive as, possible, and so in
duce our young men to undergo it at
such times as they can command a
little freedom and can seek the phys
ical development they need for mere
health's sake, if for nothing, more.
Every means by which such things
can be stimulated is legitimate and
such a method smacks of true Ameri
can ideas. It is right, too, that the
national guard of . the states should
the State of Nevada and for the
Ormsby, Nevada
DECEMBER 8, 1914
I be duplicated and strengthened by
every means which is not inconsist
ent with our obligations to our own
people or with the established policy
of our government. And this also,
not because of the time or occasion
specially calls for such measures, 'but
because it should be our constant
policy to make the provisions for our
national peace and safety.
More than this carries with it a re
versal of the whole history and char
acter of our policy. More than thh.
proposed at this time, permit me to
say. would mean that we had lost our
self- possession, that we had been
thrown off our balance by a war with
which we have nothing to do, whose
causes cannot touch us, whose very
existence affords us opportunities of
friendship and . disinterested service
which should make us ashamed of any
thought of hostility or fearful prepar
ation for trouble. This is assuredly
the opportunity for which a people
and a government like ours were raid
ed up, the opportunity not only to
speak but actually to embody and ex
emplify the counsels of peace and
amity and the lasting concord which
is based on justice and fair and gen
erous dealing.
A powerful navy we have always re
garded as our proper and natural
means of defense; and jt has always
been of defense that we have thought,
not of conquest.
Rut who shall tell us now what sort
of a navy to build? We shall take
leave to be strong upon the seas In
the future as in the. past and there
will be no thought of offense or of
provocation in that. 'Our ships arc
cur natural bulwarks. When will the
experts tell us just what kind we
should construct and, when will they
be right for ten years together, if the
relative efficiency of craft of different
kinds and uses continues to change
as we have seen it change under our
very eyes in these last few" months.
But I turn away from the subject.
It is not new. There is no new need
to discuss it. We shall not alter our
attitude toward-, it, because some
amongst us are nervous and excited.
We shall easily and sensibly agree
upon a policy of defense. The ques
tion has not changed its aspects be
cause the times are not normal. Our
policy will not be for an occasion. It
will be conceived as a permanent and
settled thing, which we will pursue
at all seasons, without haste and af
ter a fashion perfectly consistent with
the peace of the world, the 'abiding
friendship of states, and the unham
pered freedom pf all vlith whom we
deal. Let there be, no misconception.
I he country has been misinformed.
We have not been negligent of na
tional defense. We are not unmind
ful of the great responsibility resting
upon us.. We. shall learn and profit
by the lesson of every experience and
every new circumstances.; and what is
needed will be adequately done
I close, as I began, by reminding
you of the great tasks and duties of
peace which challenge our best pow
ers and invite us to build what wiil
last, the . tasks to which we can ad
dress ourselves now and at all time:
with free-hearted zest and with all
the finest gifts of constructive wis
dom we possess. To develop our life
and our resources; to supply our own
people, and the people of the world
as their need arises, from the abund
ant plenty of our fields and our maris
of trade; to enrich' the commerce of
our own states and of the world with
