NATURAL GAS.
Ïeïrlble Wreck and Probable Loss of îw °
Human Lives By an Explosion of the In
sidious Element in Pittsburgh —Three
Houses Wrecked and Seyeral Persons In
jured By Falling: Debris.
Pittsburgh, Pa ., December 5. —Yes
terday morning at four o'clock a natural
gas explosion, with probably fatal results
nnd destroying much property, occurred
$t 545 Grant street, in the cellar of a
house occupied by J. Meehan. Almost
simultaneously a similar explosion, ac
companied by tremendous reports, oc
curred in the adjoining cellars of Louis
Favilla, a fruit dealer, ' and J. J. Flan
nery's livery stable and undertaking
rooms. There is a six-inch main running
along Grand street, but it had no connec
tions with the houses that suffered. The
gas probably escaped from the main
and found its way to the cellars. Shortly
after four o'clock Katie Griffin, a domes
tic employed by Mrs. Meehan, started in
to the cellar for coal, taking with her a
lighted lamp. At the cellar door she re
quested Mrs. Phipps, who was in the
room, to hold the lamp. No sooner had
she opened the door than the gas rushed
out and ignited from the lamp in Mrs.
Phipps' liands. A terrific explosion en
sued, followed in quick succession by ex
plosions in the cellars of Flannery and
Favilla. The noise was heard for squares
away, and created the most intense ex
citement. Sheets of flames burst from
the windows and doors of the wrecked
houses. From within came the screams
of the terrified women and children.
a horrible siant.
Several men worked their way through
the fire into Mrs. Meehan's house, where
a terrible sight met their gaze. Prone
upon the Hoot, with every vestige of
clothes burned from her body, lay Kate
Griffin, bleeding from a gash in her side.
Near her was Mrs. Phipps, wrapped in
flames. Both women were picked up
and carried from the burning build
ing. It was found that Kate Grif
fin was burned beyond all hopes of
recovery. She was removed to the
Hon: »patliic Hospital, where she now
is lying unconscious. Mrs, Piiippe is se
verely burned, but her injuries are not
considered fatal. On the upper fiooi
of Mrs. Meehan's house were eight
women and children; in Flan
nery's, Mrs. Flannery and two
babies, and in Favilla's Mrs.
Favilla and her nephew, J. E. Case.
The fire spread so rapidly that they were
rescued with difficulty, but all were
finally taken out uninjured except Mrs.
Fiavilla and young Case, who were quite
seriously hurt by falling debris. Mean
while the flames gained such headway
that the three-story brick building was
completely destroyed. The other houses
were not entirely burned, but were so
badly wrecked by the concussion that it
will probably be necessary to tear them
down. The news of the casualty in a few
minutes caused the streets to be black
with people struggling to get neai
the scene and learn the exact results. The
wildest rumors prevailed. It was first
stated that seventeen persons had been
killed and injured, but when it was
definitely ascertained that the victims
seriously hurt numbered only two the ex
citement gradually subsided and the throng
dispersed. A short distance from the
scene of the accident a faith-cure meeting
was in progress. The explosion shook
the building and created a panic, but all
reached the street without injury. The
loss will reach $30,000.
