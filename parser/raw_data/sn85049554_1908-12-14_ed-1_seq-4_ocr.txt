as to prohibitory legislation looks on them

RELIGION AND AMUSEMETS.
Rev. F. A. Stephens, a Congrega
tional preacher In Des Moines, talked
considerable good hard horse sense to
his congregation yesterday morning
•When he dwelt with wholesale denun
relations of the theater, card games
and dancing, as indulged in by godly
and pious persons.'' Mr. Stephens will
find pretty general support and agree
ment with his assertions thai
"To denounce unsparingly the the
ater is to drive into a pen the great
'writers and actors of our magnificent
dramas with the army of filth-producing
Aa.nd
fUth-rehearsing peple and stuff
that are indiscriminately classed with
Ithe best by those who are willfully
or otherwise incapable of sane judge
ment. Likewise to attack with tooth
and claw the dance, irrespective of
classiflcktion. Is .to declare that the
lewd, sickening bowery orgy is no less
respectable than an innocent whirl in
dulged in by young men and maidens
in the drawing room of a pure, ele
vating home. To speaJt in the same
(breath of an innocent game of cards
with' the gambling devices, whether
manipulated by the shuffling of a pack
of pasteboards or otherwise, is not only
to display ignorance but to parade
prejudices. The standard set up by
the church In relation to amusements
should be a Christion standard, a
•standard based on the principles of
Christian liberty and Christian mo
tives. Turn the young people over from
Moses to Christ Let us teach the
young that Christianity forbids nothing
that will not harm ourselves or others."
Austerity and severe suppression of
proper and natural impulses never
made a religion, a nation or a great
man. To guide, direct and modify i^
one thing, to prison and prevent is
entirely another. The Y. M. C. A. is
successful as a teacher of Christianity
and religious life because it has_ learned
to supply what the narrowest puritan
ism denies. Rev. Stephens is a bold
man, but a useful one. He. may not
stay long as pastor of the Des Moines
church, but lie will have accomplished
something beyond a narrow round of
postoral calls if he brings about mental
agitation and honest thought among
his congregation.
PAT CR0WF,--EVANGELIST.
If the last resort of a knave is
patriotism, the last resort of a drunk
ard, the. platform as a temperance lec
turer, Pat Crowe is taking a logical or
at least natural course. However when
tvve think of Pat Crowe as an evan
gelist urging upon men and women the
Christian life, most of us will find an
incongruity in the combination that re
pulses and sickens. It will be an ex
trertiely natural conviction that Pat
has quit the business of child abduc
tion for a confidence "lay."
No doubt he will draw a crowd. He
could get a goodly number of curious
people into a. tent at ten cents a head
to simply look at "the man who stole
Cudahy's kid." There are few' of us
who •wouldn't walk a block to see a

smacks of sacrilege.

The editor of the Carroll Herald, out
of the depth of recent experience, has
this to say: "The democrats of the

bility present bill providing for a
guaranty of bank deposits. We do not
see why the measure should not be
taken up by the dominant party in the
legislature. The Oklahoma, law is es
sentially wrong and pernicious. But
there ought to be some way to protect
people against loss in banks. The pos
tal banking system will not reach the
danger. Think of it. there is not a per
son doing business involving a risk
of any kind that is not required to
furnish bonds to covcr possible loss.
Why, I'nele Sam requires rural car
riers to give bonds when the possibility
of loss or defalcation is almost noth
ing. But a banker, with only a few
thousand dollars may. and does, receive
hundreds of thousands of the people's
money, without ever giving a cent in
the way of security. It is not fair, and
law making bodies are deaf to a posi
tive demand when t.hev ignore this
crying need of the people."

-MORTGAGES AND LIARS,
(Manson Journal)
A law which takes such a proportion
of a person's income as Is demanded
by the tax on mortgages, is simply a
law to promote lying. In fact, it sets
a premium on lying. For people wilj
not be robbed of one-third of their
income if lying will save them.
It Is almost impossible to borrow
local money on mortgages because of
the high rate of taxation. Not only
is this law unfair in comparison with
the tax on other property, but how
does it affect the local money in
competition with money from a dis
tance? Foreign mortgages escape
this tax, and so local money must
find some way to escape or be driven
from the field entirely. All .sorts of
sulbterfuges are resorted to, such as
holding mortgages from record, taking
mortgages in the name of distant
friends or relatives, and taking a
release back. Thus while we have a
law that punishes 'the honest man by
taking one-third of his income, the
one who is less inclined to stand on
technicalities gets out of the tax, and
so we have the law, but get very little
income from it, and are creating a
nation of liars.
You will probably ask what Is to
be done about the matter? We say
frankly that we do not know just
how it Should be adjusted, but if we
were fishing and caught nothing but
suckers and minnows, we would quit
fishing.

Export and Import Values
'Exports! of agricultural products in
190S were valued at $1,017,000,000
greater than for any preceding year,
except 1907, and $37,000,00*0 less than
last year, because of decline in values
of cotton exports. Imports were $540,
000,000, a reduction of $S7,000,000.
During the last twelve^ years the
yearly average agricultural balance of
international -trade in favor of this
country increased from $234,000,000 to
$411,000,000 or 76 per cent.
Under the head of the department's
experiment and other work in 1908,
mention is made of a high yielding,
early maturing variety of corn which
gave 100 bushels per acre in Wiscon
sin, under adverse seasonal conditions.
Public Roads and Forestry.
Under the head of highways, the re
port states that freight hauled to rail
roads over wagon roads exceeds 250,
000,000 tons a year. With an average
cost of 23 cents per ton per mile the
resultant sum representing the annual
cost of wagon transportation passes the
half billion dollar mark.
The total cost of 2,151,000 miles of
road is given as over $1,720,000,000,
while the percentage of improved roads
•was only 7.14 in 1904, and is probably
pi
not in excess of 8 per cent at the pres
ent time.
Twenty states are reported to have
adopted the state aid plan of improv
ing roads, either by appropriating
money from the state treasuries or by
providing skilled supervision or both.
The number of national forests is
1S2, with an area of 168,000,000 acres,
and a timber value of $800,000,000.
They contain one-fifth of -the standing
merchantable timber in the country.
Statistics of tuberculosis in animals
showed:
Beef cattle affected, 1 per cent hogs,
2 per cent -dairy cattle, 10 per cent
annua-! loss $14,000,000. On this head,
the secretary says, tuberculosis can be
eradicated from our animals only by
means of systematic work of federal
and state authorities in co-operation.
Agriculture in the Schools.
"There are," says the report, "fif
teen state agricultural high schools and
forty others receiving state aid, 115
state and county normal schools pre
paring young people to teach agricult
ure, and sixteen privately endowed col
leges and over 250 public and private
high schools and academies giving in
struction in agriculture. Over 2,000,000
people are reported as"-having.attended
the farmers' institute meetings during
the year."
Incidental to the discussion of ex
periment stations, and pests that men
ace agriculture, Secretary Wilson says:
"As a means of spreading typhoid
•fever the common house fly is attract
ing more attention and an effort is be
ing made to arouse public interest in
the subject. The tick, the sole agent in
the spread of Texas fever, has been
studied with a view -to assisting in the
campaign of eradication now being
waged with good prsopects of ultimate
success."
For American Sales Abroad.
The annual report oif John M. Car
son, chief of the bureau of manufac
turers, to the secretary of commerce
and labor, calls attention to work done
for opening foreign markets to the sale
of American goods.
Pursuant to instructions, consular
officers have supplied the bureau with
over 100 commercial directories of for
eign countries.
By this means there is now in Wash
ington a "selected commercial directory
of the world," available for manufac
turers, exporters, and their agents.

A FIRE TRAP
The accompanying picture is a reproduction of
a photograph of the disastrous school fire in Cleve
land which cost the lives of 150 children.
State Architect, Liebbe^ has started a crusade
against hot air furnaces in schools, claiming that
they not only make firetraps of the buildings in
which they are installed, but prove unhygenic,
Mr. Liebbe said:
"The first thing to do is to eliminate the hot air furnaces. vvnat
trouble have they not engendered. Home aiiter home and lives by the
score have been extinguished by the red hot demon in the cellar, to say
nothing of the unhygienic inflow of life destroying air, they furnish to
the human hot house plants—the school children, who must breathe in
this vitiated air after it passed in thru a'dirty air duct from off the sur
face of the ground, then embrace the hot demon and pass up thru all
sorts of flues into the crowded school room to sicken, enervate, emaci
ate its occupants with the inevitable accompaniments of headache, lan
guor and debilitation.
"The proper warming and ventilation of the school room or any
other habitation is no longer an unsolved problem. Its accomplishment
simple and usually perfectly safe by either hot vapor, steam, or
er ."till, HOT WATER."
