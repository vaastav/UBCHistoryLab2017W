BEST EARS OF CORN FROM YEAR'S
2,767,000,000 BUSHEL CROP
FRED PALIN, WINNING EAR, TROPHY, AND THE 10 BEST
EA RS.
OMAHA, Neb., Dec. 1C. —In the
season just ended American farm
ers produced 2,767,000,000 bush
els of corn, worth $1,720,000,000.
Considering quantity, quality and
price, this Is the proudest record
of the American corn farm.
To have raised the best one ear
of corn out of the tremendous
crop is a distinction of no small
magnitude. The honor belongs to
Fred Palm, a farmer of Newton,
Ind. To signify his splendid
achievement the national corn ex
position here awarded him the $1,
--000 trophy shown in the picture
THE TACOMA TIMES
kbove. The $ 1,0 00 ear, each ker
ne w of which is worth $1, 1b also
Bhown in the picture, and the
pride of the possessor is not dis
guised in his face.
The exposition awarded anoth
er 11,000 trophy for the best 10
ears. This fell to J. R. Oberatreet
of Franklin, Ind. The 10 mag
nificent ears are shown in the pic-
ture. j
Palm said: "I put In Beven
years growing that ear of corn.
My parent stock consisted of
Reed's Yellow Dent as the male I
plant, and the Alexander Gold j
Standard as the mother plant. The;
Standard was detasseled the first]
two years. This cross produced!
the seed from which the -world's j
best ear came.
"The ear came from among
those selected for seed. My wife
picked out the winning ear, and
I think that the credit belongs to
her."
