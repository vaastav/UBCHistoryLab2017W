The President's Message.
The message is very long, but readable
throughout. It is packed with matter In
which the people are Interested?matter
which by speeches and oiher deliverances
the President has made of moment. Some
of It is ripe for action by Congress, and
action should be taken, while other por
tions are for discussion, and should re
ceive a good deal of discussion.
Oar foreign affairs, the President points
out, are in exce.lent shape. We are at
peace with the world, and noihing threat
ens a change in those fortunate relations.
The reference to Secretary Root's visit
to Mexico is couched In terms of warm
appreciation of our southern neighbor,
and the recommendation respecting Amer.
lean representation at the Tokio exposi
tion in 1011! should meet with the most
cordial response in the way of a libera,
appropriation. Congress should see that
the greatest republic in the world makes
the proper appearance at a celebration
where all the world will be on view, and
in a country strongly attached to us and
to which we are strongly attached.
The President gives his space largely
to domestic affairs. Ills range of sub
jects is wide, stretching all the way from
the currency question?the most pressing
of all our questions?to the campaign ex
penses of political parties, which Just now
is in the hands mainly of those with noth
ing else to do. Except that the President
is a man of serious mind, he might be
suspected of quizzing the reformers by
proposing that the government foot the
bills of our national campaigns and keep
its own account of expenditures.
The suggestions as to the army are in
the right spirit, but need working out.
That establishment undoubtedly is lan
guishing. and the wide advertisement of
the fact discredits us in the eyes of the
nations. But the fact exists, and unless
in some way it is remedied we shall be
discredited in our own eyes. As to the
navy we have the most definite word in
the whole message. The President wants
four new battleships, and they should be
voted. The cruise to the Pacific invites
great attention to our sea power and how
much we expect of it, and it should be
made, and kept, equal to every possible
demand.
The President wants additional trust
legislation, and argues his case very per
suasively. He asks also for currency leg
islation, though he does not go into the
subject beyond the generalities of the day
Perhaps he is wise in that. An elastic
currency and an emergency currency are
safe texts for use In discussing present
conditions, but a law which will meet the
requirements and at the same time safe
guard values and business is something
that must come from a conference of
many men with many minds. The rresl
dent is Justified In quoting from hla previ
ous deliverances on both the trust ques
tion and the currency question, and in
doing so makes effective repiy to those of
his critics who cliarge him with failure in
the one case, and with responsibility for
disaster In the other.
At last we have a word about the tariff
?not as straight a word as the subject
warranted, but sufficient to show that the
President favors and expects revision, and
that the time for it will come in the
spring of 1909. Meanwhile, sentiment may
be taken as to an income tax and an in
heritance tax, as, should the country
favor the one or the other, or both, the
tariff will thereby be affected. Mr. Gor
man's work in 1894 was rendered all the
more abortive by the decision of the
Supreme Court ruling out the income tax
which he at that time had provided.
First and last, tne President, as usual,
has provided many texts for discussion!
and all ot them, both in Congress and in
the press, will be freely used.
Bills and Petitions.
Hills and petitions are now in order,
and the prospects are that the record
will be broken. Not only are there many
new members in both bouses of Congress,
all full of suggestions about saving the
cquntry and anxious to redeem promises
made on the stump, but issues are numer
ous, and all of them tempt a new hand at
the bellows. But no harm will be done.
The more bills the merrier. Few are ex
pected to become laws. The pigeonholes
of Congress are capacious. Many am
bitious propositions find their way to
those caverns. Otherwise six years in
stead of six months would be necessary to
enable Congress to dispose of the business
of a single long session.
The rule "No flowers" still applies to
the opening day of Congress. But that
does not prevent the Speaker from receiv
ing the customary bouquets.
By not wearing a frock coat Senator
Koraker once more gave evidence of a
thoroughly independent spirit.
. The District and Congress.
Once more the District Commissioners
lay before Congress their annual recom
mendation Jhat the local appropriations
be based upon business principles. They
ask that In the allotment of the public
funds, half fropi the Treasury and half
from the local taxpayers, consideration
should be given to the current needs of
the municipality tlrst of all, and that the
provisions for the large permanent works,
which will benefit the residents of later
generations, should be financed as are
slmi.ar works in other cities. In no other
way will it be possible for the District to
grow in proper proportion, to develop
harmonious.y, to meet its new require
ments as they arise, and to provide ade
quately for the future needs In advance.
The annual report of the Commissioners
is long and interesting. It embraces in
detail all the items of municipal manage
ment for the past fiscal year, and It dis
closes In the main a satisfactory and
wholesome state of affairs. In practically
every department of the municipal organi
zation, however, are to be noted the ef
fects of parsimony, the direct results
of the pay-as-you-go po.icy adopted by
Congress several years ago and persist
ently maintained! The District needs more
school buildings, more policemen, more
firemen, and better pay for these two
vitally important protective workers. Its
administrative forces are smaller than
good municipal business requirements de
mand. The various corps of Inspectors
are Inadequate to cover the fields assigned
to them. The truth is, the District has
srewn faster tlM Congress has realised,
or has undertaken to provide for tn terms
of financial adjustment.
The fact that this annual recommenda
tion for tbsr&stabllshment of the District
finances on a business basis has been reg
ularly rejected from session to session
does not operste today to warrant an
other refusal of this reasonable request.
The Commissioners have right and'logic
on their side. They are backed by the
entire community. They have in support
an endless vista of precedents. Their
proposition is sound. The Secretary of
the Treasury wisely refrains from cutting
the estimates submitted by the Commis
sioners, passing up to Congress the whole
budget with its involved issues of method
and principle. If the recommendations
are rejected and the estimates are cut It
will have to be on the Initiative of Con
gress. and with the houses solely respon
sible for the results.
Meanwhile it is gratifying to observe
that despite the heavy handicap of the
unjust and li logical financial conditions
imposed upon the District. It has made
headway during the past y$ar. That It
would the more quickly solve the various
problems which confront it, such as those
which affect the public health and safety,
if it were given a more adequate annual
allowance for maintenance is perfectly
plain. It cannot be expected to biiUd
great permanent works on a cash basis,
and at the same time keep up the stand
ard of administrative efficiency, and the
requirement to attempt this Impossible
task imposed upon it by Congress is Flat
ty to be deplored.
The House and Business.
Mr. Williams and Mr. DeArmond were
doubtless sincere yesterday In objecting
to the lodging of so much power in the
hands of the Speaker of the House. But
that was because of the Speaker's poli
tics. Mr. Cannon Is a republican, and
the leader of thp minority and his first
lieutenant are democrats. Had Mr. Wil
liams taken the gavel would Mr. DeAr
njond have objected to the House rules?
Hardly. Had Mr. DeArmond taken the
gavel would Mr. Williams have objected
to them? It is moat unlikely.
The rules of the House, as we all know,
are the fruits of a reform Instituted by a
strong man. Thomas B.* Reed came to
the chair at a time when the House, for
years, had been tied hand and foot by a
procedure which was discreditable to the
body. Obstruction had become an art.
and the dullest member could success
fully practice it. A premium was put on
talk, and business could be halted at any
time by anybody. The Speaker was kept
busy with points of order and parlia
mentary inquiries, while the clerks'
throats were tried calling the roll. It
was that merry old scheme of how not to
do it.
Mr. Reed at the beginning of the
Fifty-first Congress put an.end to the
nuisance. He had seen it in operation
and come to despise it. He thought the
public welfare demanded a change, and
ne made a change. Hs had studied
the subject, and the rules he offered
for adoption embodied everything nec
essary for the transaction of business.
The noisy obstructionist was deposed
from power, and the House made the
master of the situation.
The cry of czar was raised, bat Mr.
Reed did not wince. The charge that
the House had ceased to be a deliberative
body amused him, as well it might. As
he knew, the House under the old rules
had not been permitted even to delib
erate. Talking against time is far
from deliberation. A l%ss resolute or
resourceful man would have failed, but
Mr. Reed had both sand and sense, and
wen.
In the next House Judge Crisp, a
democrat, used practically the same
rules, and they have since remained in
force. Mr. Henderson, who succeeded
Judge Crisp in the chair, was no csar.
and surely no man not playing politics
can call Mr. Cannon a csar.' Tho House
must do business. To go back to the
old procedure would be a sort of crime
against experience and common sense.
But nobody thinks of going back to the
old procedure. The proposition is Pick
wickian. and has a smile concealed
about its person.
The verdict in the case of Mrs. Bradley
may be regarded as something of a vin
dication of Oklahoma's determination to
have the unwritten law formally and
respectfully recognlze'd on the statute
books.
A number of statesmen seem determined
to do all in their power to counteract the
pleasant, things that were recently poured
Into President Roosevelt's ears by the
reception committees. * .
Stuyvesant Fish's enemies are still full
of fight, but his athletic exploits make
them chary about leaving the choice of
weapons to him.
It should be a matter of pride in pe
rusing the message to note that previous
messages have been found worthy of
?ncores.
Now that ocean travel is at its mini
mum there Is no longer enough advertising
value in a record-breaking liner to make
!t worth while.
Overhead Wires for the Plaza.
A suggestion that the street traction
situation at the Union station be relieved,
as an emergency measure, by the installa
tion of overhead trolley lines, revives
memory of Washington's long fight
against the introduction of this "cheap
and nasty" form of propulsion. The citi
zens of this community have always been
and still are flatly opposed to any less
safe, sightly system of traction than that
which, after many seasons of struggle,
was finally installed here and now stands
as an object lesson for the entire country
as a type of the best attainable method of
surface traction. Whether they will op
pose the emergency proposition depends
entirely upon circumstances.
There will be no objection to the use
of overhead wires to give street railway
access to the station plaza provided the
legislative authorization to that effect
is directly coui led with and made an in
separable part of the act of* Congress es
tablishing the permanent system of tracks
at that p ace. In other words, recogniz
ing the acuteness of the emergency, the
people of Washington, and doubtless their
good friends in Congress who appreciate
the necessity of maintaining the high
standard already established after so
much travail, will consent to the make
shift method only on condition that its
term of existence is definitely limited to
the period necessary to complete the per
manent arrangement of tracks on the
underground-conduit basts, that arrange
ment being enacted into laif In the same
bill that carries the permission to install
overhead wires.
There wl"l be strenuous opposition to
any move designed to establish the over
head wires on the plaza by means of a
separate bill, to be followed at some later
time by the biij prescribing the perma
nent routes. To separate the two meas
ures will be to invite delay, to offer a
premium upon the loading of the perma
nent trackage bill with amendments such
as have already caused postponement and
are at this time promised, or threatened,
by the advocates of the former proposi
tions of a general character.
The issue in this matter remains clearly
deflned. Owing to the failure of Con
gress to provide adequately tor the ac
cewmoistkm of the public at the new
terminal In the matter of street car Hues,
the station la occupied before the car
tracks outside of the building are ready.
It Is clearly the duty of Congress now to
repair its error as far as possible by
hastening the enactment of the law which
should have been approved at least during
the first session of the Fifty-ninth Con
gress. Any temporary scheme to lessen
the public Inconvenience shoud be re
garded merely as a phase of the general
work, promptly to be undertaken and
pressed to a finish, of insta.ling on the
station p.aza a series of loops directly
connected with the city's general system
and operated by means of underground
conductors.
i
A number of the members of the House
of Representatives appear to like "Uncle
Joe" very much, even though their poli
ties prevents them from ever being re
garded as favorite nephews.
Predictions that Gen. Grosvenor will be
forgotten are absurd. Even though the
Congressional Record may be closed to
him, the arithmetic is still open.
* . .
Of course young Mr. Hyde would not
surrender a million dollars of insurance
money voluntarily. But nobody cares a
great deal about his feelings in the matter.
When the "third term" Is mentioned It
Is now necessary to study the remark to
be sure whether it is intended as a com
pliment or a sarcasm.
In his indignation at the way some of
the New Tork newspapers treat him Mr.
Bryan may be tempted to start an Ana
nias Club of his own.
The President's tendency to increase the
length of his message makes the ad
vancing cost of white paper a more seri
ous problem than ever.
Postal savings banks would enable the
village postmaster to become even more
intimately acquainted with the affairs
of his neighbors.
Great possibilities before Congress in
clude even those of launching hitherto
undiscussed presidential booms. ?

SHOOTING STABS.
BX PHILANDER JOHNSON.
Forethought.
"I have decided to give my husband
something very inexpensive for Christ
mas," she sai?, thoughtfully.
. "Some simple souvenir of the day that
will be cherished for its remembrance
rather than for its value?"
"Yes, that's it. Something that won't
put,such a crimp in the family funds that
-he will have to economize in selecting a
present for me."
"Do holiday recess of Congress." said
Uncle Bben, "makes me think of what a
lot of folks acts. Dey uses up so much
energy mappin' out deir Intentions dat
dey has to take a vacation befo" dey gits
stahted."
It Occasionally Happens.
The statesman oft will cause distress
By greedy depredations;
Proprieties with him are less
Than the appropriations.
Progress Reported.
"At least half a million dollars has been
expended for that building." said the in
dignant citizen, "and there ha; been no
progresa"
"My dear sir," rejoined Mr. Grafton B.
Gay. "how can you ignore the fact that
the expenditure of half a million la in it
self. progress?"
Refuge in the Abstruse.
"Ethelinda seems to prefer the most
classical pieces she can find." said the
fond mother.
"Of course she does," answered Senator
Sorghum. "8ome people play the piano
Just as some people make speeches?the
more difficult and unfamiliar the subject,
the less liable they are to be corrected
when they make mistakes."
The Sixtieth Congress.
Old machine is running fine!
Cheers resounding down the line!
Used to look like 59;
Now she looks like 00.
Some were bold enough to say
They pursued a restful way.
That Is over. From this day
They will work like 90.
Heretofore two statesmen might
Lose their heads and start a fight.
After this they'll do It right.
They will fight like 00.
But with patriotic skill
* They will pass each little bill
That the voters hope they will;
Yes they will?like 90!
Currency Reform Prospects.
From the Philadelphia Ledger.
The advices which are being received
from Washington concerning the subject
of currency reform are about as clear as
the minds of those from whom they ema
nate. No J>etter confirmation could be
had. U any were needed, of the remark
which wan made in these columns a few
days ago, that the average statesman's
brain is a blank on thlB great question.
The conclusion is reached thus early in
the career of the session that there will
be no financial legislation this year be
cause the members cannot agree upon any
one who shall be authorised to decide
when an "emergency" Is at hand, be
cause next year la presidential year and
the democrats may make an Issue of such
a law if the republicans pass it, and be
cause?and because.
Proving It..
From the New York Herald.
Col. Bryan is running things to suit him
self in Washington, and this will induce
many to agree with him that the donkey
is a fit emblem for latter-day democracy.
Wires.
From the Philadelphia Inquirer.'
The air of Washington will be thick
with wireless messages between the Cap
itoi and the White House this week. But
wires will be pulled. Just the same.
What's a Motto in Cleveland f

The fact must not b. overlooked that
