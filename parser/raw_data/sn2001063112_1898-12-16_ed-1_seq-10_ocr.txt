ml the Necessity of Meeting New
'onditioiis.
of the Treasury Gage has
^iiile public his report on the condition of
lie finances of the country and the work
cconiplished by his department during
he year. It is an interesting document.
J],on the subject of currency and banking
lol'onn he says:
Tin arguments against government issues
fcf paper money as medium for commer
cial exchanges have been fully made and
mil not be repeated In detail. The pro
usal to substitute bank Issues for govern
ment notes Is opposed with many lionest
Sirejudieos and assailed by bitter denuncia
tions. The first arise from a failure to com-
I'luMid the true philosophy of a paper cur
Ircney and must be patiently considered.
•TUp latter obscure the question by recklesa
•statements, charging thnt all propositions
Ifor currency reform are bank conspiracies.
If it be conceded that the legal-tender
noney Issued by government does not pos
sess I he qualillcntlo lis to make It a proper
[factor in the country's exchanges of prod
Jth'ts and manufactures, If the fact also be
[admitted that it is a deranging and dlsturb
I lug fa.-tor la its relation to Industry and
rumnierce. then the time has come to sub
stitute for it a currency which will ade
quately. economically and safely meet with
the ever-growing needs of the country, rap
iiliy developing, as it is, In the power ol
production, in the number of its people and
the Importance .of '.ts domestic and foreign
trade.
In answer to the question whether a
bank note currency can be established
which will lie economical, adequate and
sale and .serve the public needs in a bet
ter way than is now served, the Secre
tary points to the system in force in
(J aim da.
The facts set forth by the Comptroller re
late exclusively to the proposition that the
notes of a failed bank shall be a paramount
lien upon tin- assets for their full value be
fore any rights accrue to other creditors.
The issue of notes upon the general assets
of national banks may bo made perfectly se
cure wltli.uit the requirement that the notes
be a first lien upon their assets. It would
only be necessary to award to the notehold
er the same ra able proportion of the assets
which went to other creditors, and to pro
vide that the amount required to pay the
•inference be obtained by an assessment up
on ail the national banks, collected ratablj
In proportion to their share in the circula
tion of this character. The vital question Is,
Wlia' percentage of assessment upon this
circulation would be required in order to
cover the losses to noteholders in the case
of failed hanks? The experience of the na
tional banking system demonstrates that the
assessment would be Insigniticant.
The total circulation of failed banks out
standing at tin- time of failure up to Oct.
HI, 3S117, was -S20,S!)3,£27. The loss upon
these notes. If the security for them had
been impaired in the same degree as the
security for other liabilities, would have
been .«,"i.: 7ii,1!jr, or an annual average oi
about SlO'i.OtP. This loss would have been
made gno.l by a tax of about one-twelfth
of 1 per cent, per year upon the circulation
of the solvent banks. A tax of one-flfth ol
1 per cent, upon the average circulation ol
the national banks since the foundation ol
the system woulil have paid such losses up
to Oct. :u lb07, and left a surplus of about
¥'.l,OUO,COO in the guaranty fund.

Ill r.\v ias?t report I ventured upon specific
recommendations. These recommendations,
If adopted and formulated into law, would
III my opinion be curative of the evils herein
pointed out. In house bills Nos. 10.2S9 and
10,3:13 are embodied a series of measures In
some respects more meritorious. The meas
ures herein proposed are the result of care
ful study by expert and experienced men.
With some modifications—the reasonable
fruit of full discussion—they would, I be

The amount of fractional silver coin held
by the treasury July 1, 1S97, was $16,201,
BUO July 1. l.SJiS, $12,070,090. This stocS
has at present. Nov. IS, been reduced to $7,
1^2,o(IO, much of which Is so worn as to be
unfit for circulation. The amount available,
attributed among :he several sub-treasuries,
gives but small stock to each, and some de
nominations are exhausted. The Secretary
of the Treasury should be authorized to re
coin this uiicin-iont stock and any such coin
which may hereafter accumulate In the
treasury, the difference between Its face
value and the new coin It will make to be
paid out of any moneys in the treasury not
otherwise appropriated. Further provision
should be made to add to the stock of frac
tional coin, and to that end It la suggested
that 11c Secretary of the Treasury be au
thorized to use any silver bullion now In the
treasury for the coinage of such denomina
tions as may be required from time to time
to meet the demand from the different sec
tions of the country. With an ever-Increas
ing population, which will be added to In
the near future by the acquisition of addi
tional territory, the demand for fractional
silver coin will be such as to make it essen
tially necessary that the stock should be In
creased.
It is suggested that, at the proper time,
action be taken by Congress to assimilate
the currency of L'orto ltico to that of the
United States, so far and so rapidly at
this can be done without unduly disturb
ing existing conditions and contract rela
tions in Porto Rico. This, it is believed,
can be accomplished by making customs
dues in the island payable in American
money, yet receiving the silver pesos and
centavos at a fixed relation to our dollar,

FARMERS IN SESSION.
National Congress Begins Delibera
tions at Fort Wayne.
The farmers' national congress of the
United States of America assembled at
Fort Worth, Texas, in its eighteenth an
nual session. Ex-
Gov. William D.
Hoard of Wisconsin
presided, and among
the delegates were
representatives of all
gjthe States and terri
Ttories of the Union
and of several of the
Canadian provinces.
After prayer by Rev.
Alexander C. Garrett
of Dallas, the visitors
w. D. HOARD. listened to addresses
Df welcome by Mayor B. B. Paddock. Gov.
Charles A. Culberson, President W. E.
Skinner of the Fort Worth Live Stock
Exchange and others. Responses in be
half of the delegates were delivered by
Secretary John M. Stahl of Illinois, Wil
liam, Freeman of Maine and F. L. Max
well of Louisiana. After the roll call by
Stales President Hoard proceeded to de
liver his annual address.
A feature of the congress was the at
tendance from some of the States of large
numbers of associates to re-enforce the
delegates. Iowa had sixty-three persons,
including the delegates, and Colorado had
fifty-four. The annexation of the Philip
pines was one subject which engrossed the
attention of the delegates.
The report of Prof. Henry of Wiscon
sin on the President's address was adopt
ed. It recommended instruction in the
principles of agriculture in rural public
com­
mend the subject to the early and earnest
attention of Congress.
On the point of fractional silver the re
port contains this paragraph:
PERILS AS TO CHINA.
ftngland and Russia Unable to Reach
an Agreement.
Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain, Brit
ish colonial secretary, made new disclos
ures the other night in a speech at WTake
field, Yorkshire. He virtually stated the
British Government had found it impossi
ble to reach an agreement with Russia
touching China, and that France's plan
of exasperation had prevented a settled
policy as to Egypt.
It was made evident, however, that an
entente has been reached with Germany
that may make for peace and for extend
ed trade but the significant fact was
brought out that unless an agreement is
effected with Russia there are dangers of
grave complications. He, however, left
room to hope for a settlement.
Mr. Chamberlain again referred with
feeling to the cordial Anglo-American re
lations. He quoted from the President's
message to show that there is hope that
England is not to stand alone for the
"open door" in the East, and again declar
ed that an alliance between the two na
tions would make them inviuciblc.
HOBSON REFUSES $50,000,
Merrimac Hero Peclines an Oiler to
Lccture.
An offer of $50,000 for a number of lec
tures has been refused by Naval Construc
tor Richmond P. Hobson. This offer was
made by a New York lecture bureau, and
the reason for his refusal was stated by
Hobsou to a friend.
"Before the sinking of the Merrimac,
he said, "my lectures would probably have
not been worth 50 cents. The sinking of
the Merrimac seems to have made them
worth $50,000. The work that so sud
denly raised my stock in literary trade
was done in simple execution of my duty
as an American naval officer. I did not
feel that I had a right to use the perform
ance of that duty for my financial better
ment. I therefore declined the offer of
$50,000."
Gold from Maria Teresa.
The safe of the Spanish cruiser Maria
Teresa, which has lain for some time in
the Norfolk navy yard, has been opened
and found to contain bags of Spanish and
American gold and silver coin. It is esti
mated that the value of the treasure will
reach $75,000. The money wilf be turned
over to the proper officials, and the safe
will be sent to the National Muaeum at
Washington.

Offer of $200,000,000 for Group Made
to President McKinley.
•Tapan has offered this Government
$200,000,000 for the Philippines. This
information came through a Washington
correspondent from a high source and is
asserted to be ollicial. It was further
stated that this overture of Japan was
met by the reply from the President that
no negotiations affecting the disposition
or control of the Philippines could be en
tered into until after the conclusion of the
treaty of peace at Paris.
In direct connection with this story it is
known that an influential Senator recently
had a long talk with the President, at
which the disposition of the Philippines
was the main topic of conversation. The
argument of the Senator was that, while
he was opposed to the holding of the Phil
ippines, he had now become convinced it
would bo necessary to hold the island of
Luzon. He told the President it would be
to the advantage of the Government to
dispose of all of the group except Luzon
and that it would be the better plan to
have several purchasers for the group. In
other words, he would avoid all possible
complications by letting Germany, Eng
land, France, Japan and Russia into the
gigantic auction sale.
When the peace protocol was negotiated
by Cambon and the President the adminis
tration's idea involved nothing more than
the acquisition of Luzon. Since then the
expansionist sentiment has grown rapidly
in popular favor. The President may be
only testing public opinion by giving cer
tain gentlemen the impression that he
favors the sale of all the islands except
I Luzon, or he may actually favor this dis-
schools that commercial representatives position of the Philippine question. If

eign markets be provided that the best
possible means for the operation of steam
ship lines direct to South America should
be secured, and that laws against food
adulteration be adopted. The report also
urged farmers to uphold agricultural col
leges and experiment stations and recom
mended strong taxation laws for securing
equity in taxation. Resolutions were
adopted and ordered to be sent to Con

struction of the Nicaragua canal and gov

UNCLE SAM AND JOHN BULL.
Demand for Joint Control of Nicara
gua Canal Causes Irritation.
The Nicaraguan canal question prom
ises to be one of the leading questions in
Congress this winter. The anxiety of the
British to get in on the ground floor, as
expressed by the London press, causes
some irritation in Washington, as Eng
land's friendship for this country during
the recent war is shoved under our noses
as an argument for joint control of the
proposed canal.
England's claims for a share in the
canal are based on the Bulwer-Clayton
treaty, an agreement entered into before
any one dreamed of a canal across that
part of the isthmus. It is understood that
Sir Julian Pauneefote has recently had a
conference with Secretary of State Hay
and has intimated that our exclusive con
trol of the waterway violates the conven
tion of 1850.
In administration circles the feeling is
strong that no one shall interfere with this
Government's declared intention to build
the canal, and Secretary Hay probably
told this to Sir Julian in a friendly but
firm way. Later the United States may
declare the canal neutral in war times,
but the Government will do this in its own
way and certainly not under pressure.
As to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, which
England threatens to drag forth, the
United States has two strong defenses
against it. First, the United States can
immediately annul the treaty. Second,
under the treaty the Uuited States can do
anything she proposes to do without vio
lating any of its terms, although the
treaty has been abrogated by Great Brit
ain's own acts.

Expedition of Three Regiments Will
Soon Leave New York.
The next regiments to start for Manila
will embark at New York about the end
of this month, and will go through the
Suez canal, unless present plans fail. This
The decision to use New York as the
point of embarkation instead of San Fran
cisco was reached after a careful review
of a number of considerations, chief
among which was the urgency for haste.
At the present time the Government is
wholly without available transports in the
Pacific ocean to meet the emergency.

ADDRESS TO FARMERS
W. D. HOARD TALKS TO
TIONAL CONGRESS.
Ex-Gov. Hoard of Wisconsin, president
of the Farmers' National Congress, in his
annual address to that body at Fort
Worth, said:
Our agriculture Is becoming nationalistic.
This farmers' congress Is one of the proofs
of this assertion. We are no longer a loosely
joined band of States, "discordant, bellig
erent." "Thank God, we are coming to see
each other "face to face." We are becoming
cemented by railroads, navigable rivers, In
terchangeable products, and a more general
commingling of our people. National legis
lation Is taking on thought of this kind In
the establishing of experiment stations, the
enactment of laws for the better protection
of agricultural products against the dishon
est greed of men who would adulterate and
counterfoil.
We are just beginning to feel as a people
that agriculture Is an Intellectual as well as
a manual pursuit that from the humblest
tenant to the lordliest ranchman progress
nnd profit depend on mental comprehen
sion of the principles Involved, nnd an ener
getic obedience to that Uuowledge. Compre
hension means Intellect, obedience means
business. Some men are nil Intellect and no
work others nil work nml no Intellect. The
true farmer unites both. He Is both a stu
dent and a "doer of the word."
Some of the
questions
f0r this farmers'
congress to ask itself are: What can we
do In an organized way to get the farmers
of this continent to. see the necessity of
more intellect on the farmV Iu other words,
what can we do to promote farm education'/
What can this congress do to promote wise
legislation In the State and national legis
latures to this end? What can this congress
do as a great force to arrest the tendency
of the American farmer to destroy the natu
ral fertility of his farm? What can we do to
arouse public opinion ami the great educa
tional forces of the country to the Import
ance of teaching the elements of agricul
ture In the primary schools of the land?
Our present system of agricultural educa
tion Is an image with a head of brass, a
body of Iron and feet of clay. We are di
recting all our energies to the head and not
the feet. Our common schools recruit the
academy, the college and the university,
and they, In turn, recruit every profession
but farming. Our young men flee to the
towns and cities because we have educated
them to do so. Nearly every European
country Is putting forth strenuous efforts
to stop this tendency by teaching the ele
ments of scientific agriculture in the public
schools. It can be done as easily as the
teaching of the elements of scientific arith
metic, or chemistry, or philosophy. A great
host of farmers who were deprived of such
teaching now tind themselves barred from
an understanding of much agricultural liter
ature. As a consequence they turn from
the agricultural college, the bulletiu of the
experiment station and the farm paper,
which Is really worth everything to them.
Like all other lines of human thought and
action, the American farmer and his farm
are going through process of evolution.
The manufacturer feels It, and his capital
and enterprise can hardly keep pace with
coming changes statesmanship feels It, for
new and difficult problems of government
constantly present themselves, and how to
keep center aud circumference In harmon
izing growth is the problem of the day. The
rail-road magnate feels It and must bow to
!t. What Is the subtle power that Is so
mysteriously leavening the whole lump? It
is growth of knowledge among the people.
Heretofore our vision has been directed al
most wholly to the price we were to receive
for our products. The present tide of evolu
tion bears us In another direction. We can
not control prices the market end of the
question Is beyond the individual reach or
modification of any farmer. What can he
do, what must he do, tc, increase his profit,
for on that hangs his prosperity? This must
he do: He must realize that he Is no longer
a crude producer he Is a manufacturer. He
must Invoke science, invention, better sys
tem, more thorough organization among his
fellow farmers, more exhaustive study of
the underlying principles of his business,
Improved methods, everything he can lay
hold of, to contribute to a reduction of the
cost of production.
He is subject to the same economic laws
as Is every other manufacturer. The world
declares It will have cheap food and cloth
ing, for this Is the humane order of our civ
ilization. The American farmer Is In the
forefront of a merciless competition, for
from the soil must come primarily all the
food and clothing. He must furnish as good
as the best or he will lose the market. He
must do this at a living cost and keep up
the fertility of the soil, or lie and his farm
will both perish by the way. The demands
of modern civilization are expensive. It
costs more to live, educate his children and
be a man among men than It d'd his father
fifty years ago. There Is but one road out
of the difficulty as I can see. He must put
more thought into this question of the cost
of production. Heretofore the cry has been
more land, until the farm has become bigger
than the farmer. This makes expensive
farming. The necessities of the hour say
make the farmer bigger than the farm.
The Fanners' National Congress Is needed
as an organized body of opinion to promote
as best it can national legislation In support
of the Department of Agriculture. Our
present Secretary of Agriculture is doing
what he can to Introduce American food
products Into foreign markets and promote
their consumption. That department should
have the authority and means to employ,
under Its own direction, commercial agents
In every food market in the world. Den
mark sends its agents to England to receive,
guard aud look after its shipments of butter
nnd bacon. Canada Is doing the same.
There Is no reason better than traditional
abstraction why the United States should
not show the same good business sense. Be
sides, there is a great trade awaiting us at
our very doors In the sister republics of the
southern part of this continent. Can we say
or do anything here which will move our
national legislature into work of a practical
character, In the way of mall subsidies to a
line of American ships sailing direct from

hope we can. It Is a reproach to the practl
cal statesmanship of the American people
that something has not been done of this
character.
This congress can do something In the
way of aiding the greater eliicieney of the
State experimental stations, some of which
are hardly more than lodging-houses for
politicians. It can stand up and rebuke, In
no measured tones, the prostitution of agri
cultural necessities ami progress to political
favoritism. It can ami should demand of
the national government the taxation to
extinction of all counterfeit food products.
An imitation is a counterfeit, and a counter

An incident which mast have been
quite as lively in itself as it is in the
telling of it is given in "Our World's
Cycling Commission," in Travel. The
cyders were in Bengal, where, one
morning, they ran up to the only re
spectable bungalow of a village, and
called for some one to attend to their
wants. To their surprise, their sum
mons was answered by an English
man, who explained thai: his house was
not tlie dawk-bungalow, but who in-

mighty hunter, and regaled his visit
ors with stories of adventure while he
showed his collection of skius. The
narrator says:
It was his tiger stories that made our
flesh tingle nnd our hair heave. We
were in the very heart of the Bengal
tiger district, and with the nonchal
ance of a rabbit-shooter he told us of
the prevalence of these unwelcome
brutes. It was close here, he said, that
they caught a tiger credited with hav
ing done to death two hundred natives.
"Are we likely to lie Htucked?" we
asked.
"Well, I don't know. You may be,
but I rather think a bicycle" would
frighten a tiger," was the reply.
Of course we said it would be rath",
nice to see a tiger but as a matter of
fact we regretted having talked about
the aibsolute necessity of getting awa.r
with the moonrise. We tried to shak
All the while the animal was behav
ing in a distinctly mysterious way. We
could see Its dark form in the gloom,
It was traveling ahead at a leisurely
pace, occasionally rustling the branch

its wake. Suddenly the brute strayed
into a patch of moonlight. It was
poor, insignificant donkey.
Poor Memory.
An English bishop was one day wait
ing at a station for a train, says the
Churchman, and being in good time
was indulging in a walk tip and down
the platform. While thus engaged he
met a young officer whose face seemed
familiar to him.
As the two met a second time the
bishop said, "Good-inornung." At the
third encounter he stopped and asked,
"How is 3'our father?"
The gallant soldier replied, "He has
been dead many years."
The bishop tried again with the.
query, "How is your mother?"
"Well," said the officer smiling, "I
think she must be all right, for you
would certainly have heard if she had
been indisposed."
The bishop walked away, but his cu
riosity was thoroughly aroused. See
ing the station-master, he went toward
him. and asked whether he could en
lighten him as to who the young offi
cer was with whom he had just: been
speaking.
"Why. your lordship," replied the
stariou-master. "that Is the Duke of
Connanght."

That the color of eyes should affect
their streugth may scent strange, yet
that, such is the case need not now be
proved, and those whose eyes are
brown or dark colored should be in
formed that they are weaker and more
susceptible of injury from various
causes than gray or blue eyes. Light
blue eyes are generally the most pow
erful, and next to these are gray. The
lighter the pupil the greater and longer
continued is the degree of tension
which the eyes can sustain.

our host's convictions that it was

would not accommodate us.
When the moon rose we weni down
to the banks of the River Son. where
a boat was waiting to ferry u.s over, la
an hour and a half we were landed on
tbe edge of an eery covert, and after
some searching hit tlie trail that led
through thick jungle toward the Grand
Trunk Road. Every instant we expect
ed a fearsome tiger to spring upon us
from the thicket. Maybe, we eonjec-

The Kooly motor must now be packed

his will, are likely to find nothing bill in

roadway, watching for natives.
As our Rovers went splulling
in the mellow moonlight, eyes v.--,
strained ahead for any prowling ob
ject. Once there was a quick steadying
down of pace. There was some beast
running along in the shade. It wasn't
big enough for a camel, it was too big
for a dog, so it must be a tigor. Never
a word was said. Each pretwded not
to notice anything.
"Now I wonder what that brute
was," one of us at last remarked, in
pretended don't-care voice.
"Oh, nothing in particular hyena or
something," was the reply.

Many great iuventions have resulted
from trifles or accidents by patient stu
dents, who had seemingly exhausted cv
rry resource. Keely is therefore not to
be ridiculed. Ilis idea may seem chimer
ical now, but his purpose was beneficent
and the time may come when posterity
will call not him but his critics the foolisls
ones.—Galcsbttrg Republican Register.
Tbe difficulty with Keely was just this
—that he made a wrong distribution of
his abilities. If he had put as much en
ergy and sheer power into perfecting his
motor as he put into organizing his finan
cial support, he might have thrown Tesla
into the shade, and made Edison hunt
cover. As it was. he only lacked one thing
of being a great discoverer—the making
of a great discovery.—Kansas City Jour
nal.
But he worked on and died leaving his
invention uncompleted. His partners iu
the enterprise hope that the Keely motor
has been pushed to a point of development
where it can be taken up by other bands
and brains and advanced to prm Hcul
working. Let it be hoped so for science
has done so much for the race that Amer
icans look upon things once regarded
wild with imaginings as plausible ami
practicable.—St. Louis Republic.
The W. C, T. U. Temple.
The hard times and not the women are
to blame, however, and the chances are
that.any orga nization of men would have
been forced to throw up its hands long
ago.—Peoria Transcript.
It is hardly surprising that women un
accustomed to handling large business
enterprises should have become dismayed
at the magnitude of the Temple scheme,
but they might have drawn inspiration
from the courage of Mrs. Carse instead of
listening to the timid counsels of Lady
I-Ienry Somerset.—Minneapolis Tribune.
The action of the W. C. T. U. conven
tion in dropping the Chicago Temple cre
ates no great surprise. It was too big a
scheme for that organization to under
take, and even if it had been successful,
it has never yet been made clear how the
cause of temperance for which the W. C.
T. U. is working would have been bencr
fited.—Bloomington Pantagraph.
That most women are confirmed hero
worshipers is shown in the strife of the
W. C. T. 1". over the proposition to make
the Women's Temple a monument to Miss
Frances E. Willard. The sentiment
which inspired the Temple contemplated
the ercction of a noble memorial to the
cause for which many labored with equal
head of the movement led a considerable
portion of the workers to idolize the lender
above the cause.—Springfield Journal.

As to the outrage in Wilmington, it may
be said that there was no plausible excuse
for the revolution of Thursday. The
white leaders had only to wait till March
to come into power in the city government.
Waiting so brief a period would not have
brought disaster.—Indianapolis Journal.
The whites, not the blacks, are the rul
ers of this country. North and South,
East and West. That fact should have
been established long ago, and is, we be
lieve, well understood in every other State
in the South except tbe unfortunate east
ern portion of North Carolina, and when
the terrible work of yesterday is done the
fact will be thoroughly established there.

The negroes in the South cannot stand
against the whites when it comes to a
question of physical force. They may out
vote the whites in some States or locali
ties, but in time their victories will sure
ly be snatched jnvny from them by the
shotgun or rifle. Their only safety lies in
abandoning the race issue and dividing iu
politics, as they naturally would it' there
were not two separate races living side by
side.—Minneapolis Tribune.
It seems in North Carolina they want
many negroes there to leave and also wish
to prevent those outside from entering.
This is like the Southern coon trap that
caught them going and coming.—Phila
deupliia Times.
The accounts of the wholesale and un
provoked murder of colored men in the
South may well make an intelligent per
son reflect as to whether or not certain
Southern States are a part of tbe Ameri
can Union. For a few years there was
less of this barbarism, but of late there
has been a remarkable revival of it.—
