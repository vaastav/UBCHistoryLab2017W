WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.?Widespread
approval and gratification was ex- ;
pressed In Washington to-day over the !
settlement between Ireland and Great!
Britain.
In Senate and House circles expr?s- ;
sions of approval were numerous and
under the surface there was much talk ;
and speculation concerning the effect
of the agreement There is a deep \
sense of relief because of the belief ;
tho settlement means the end of possl
Ml i tie a of friction and misunderstand?
ing between this country and Great
Britain over the Irish question.
Another important pha_o of tho mat?
ter Is the recognition of the fact by,
many public men that with the Irish
question removed H Ls possible for the |
United Stntts and Great Britain ?to.
?approach a number of questions in !
wnich the two countries are mutually ,
concerned In a much more satisfactory ?
manner than if tho controversy over!
?-eland were acute.
In this relation it can be said that'
? t is gen?.raily assumed that the set- j
element will tend to make the work I
?f the armament conference easier.
Of Benefit Here and Abroad
Among other phases of the matter
which give satisiaction is the fact that!
t is thought the ;idjustment will have
a tendency to help restore to normal
business -and industrial conditions in
the United Kingdom and that the re?
action will be beneficial here and
abroad.
Senator Lodge, one of the four Amer?
ican delegates to the arms conference,
-tras plainly pleased over the tettlo
Tient,
"I am very glad the Irish question
bas been so fortunately sett ed and
that it meets with the approval of the
-.-epresentatives of Ireland," said he.
Aitneng other Senatorial expressions
"??as one from Senator Calder. who
said:
?"Of conree, I am very much pleased.
? sincerely hope the settlement will
be accepted by the British Parliament
and by ths Parliament of Ireland."
Other expressions were:
Senator Reed, of Missouri, Demoerr.t !
i?If the settlement is satisfactory to i
the people of Ireland there sheuld be j
ao objection from anybody in this ??
country.
Senator Edge, Republican, New Jer?
sey?It is indeed a very gratifying re?
sult. The effect of it has already been
3_rreat on the social and industrial lifo
of the whole world.
Great Accomplishment for Peace
Senator Pittman Democrat, Nevada
| v?I consider it one of the greatest ac
? ?omplishments for peace not only in
the British Empire out throughout the
"world, that has taken place Sn a hun?
dred yenrs.
Senator Freiinghuysen, Republican,
New Jersey?Every American must feel
Gratified that there has at last been
A satisfactory settlement of so trouble?
some a question.
Senator King, Democrat. Utah?"The
news is certainly welcome to tho Amer?
ican people, anxious as they ore for the
preservation of world peace."
Senator Walsh, Democrat, Massa?
chusetts?"I feel certain that the
friends of Irish freedom will be ex?
ceedingly pleased with the good news
that the Irish people are at last to be
fermitted to govern themselves A
riendlier feeling between the Knglish
?peaking peoples should be one result
?-if the ?rreat step taken toward insur?
ing the happiness and welfare of the
Iriah peope."
Relief Felt In Congress
The troublesome Irish question has
long been the cause of much embar?
rassment in Congress. A number of
resolutions have been offered in both
Houses expresing sympathy with Ire?
land or for the recognition of the Irish
na a separate republic. Members have
ft>ur?d themselves repeatedly in tho
position o at once fearing to offend
irish-America.) political support In this
country and also fearing to take a
course which might lead to more es?
tranged relations between the two
great English-speaking nations. It is
not overstating it to say the Irish
question has been looked on as one of
toe continual sources of worry for
many members of Congress, and for
this reason, along with others, satis?
faction is felt here over the new
treaty.
E. L. Doheney, president of the
American Association for the Recoir
nltion of the Irish Republic, gave The
Tribune a statement in which he said:
"Out of the struggle of centuries, a
new state has been born. This agree
tnent means peace?more than peace,
the burial o? cause for a bloody strifo
which has existed pearly as long as
our civilization. A struggle for lib?
erty having no parallel in all history
has ended in victory."

Boycott Leaders To Be Interned
During Prince's Bombay Visit
RANGOON, Barman, Dec. * ?Speak- I
Ing in the Legislature today, Lieuten?
ant Governor Sir R. H. Craddock con- I
demned the effort? of what he termed
"a dissatisfied clique" to organize a ?
boycott on the occasion of the visit of
the Prince of Wales by mean? of in?
timidation.
The lieutenant governor announced
tliat in order to prevent a recurrence
of the violence which occurred during1
the stay of the Prince nt Bombay it
had been decided to tntern the lenders
of the movement here. He expr?s ed
confidence that a majority of the Bur
mans would welcome the Prince as
cordially as he had been welcomed in
other communities.
BHARATPUR, British India, Dec. 7
(By The Associated Press).~Th? Prince
of Wales, who is continuing his hunt?
ing trip through Rajputana, arrived
hore to-dny. He wns received with (he
same spectacular scenes of Indian mili?

DELHI, India. Dec. 7 (By The Asso
! plated Press). -Twelve leaders of the
"non-co-operationlf-t" movement have i
been arrested at Allahabad and Luck

Union Graft
Plot to Go to
Grand Jury
(Csntlnuatf from ptsj? vn*)
from non-union men for permit cards.
He said tho federation also disapproved
of the high initiation fees, such as the
$200 exacted from men seeking admis?
sion to the Marblo Polishers' Union.
"This certainly dooa not encourage
membership." ho remarked.
Unions Assess Non-Member?
It had been testified previously thai
it wae the practice of the plastsrcrs'
and some othi-r unions to keep down
tho membership so that non-union
workers would be compelled to pay
large amounts into the treasury of
these organizations for permission to
work or, union jobs.
"It has been tho very essence and
fundamertal claim of organized labor,"
said Mr. Frayne, "that it shall not ex?
clude any man who is capable of com?
ing into the union."
"When men are good enough to bs
given permit cards by n union, and not
nood enough to bf> taken in as mem?
bers, t^at is a vicious practice, is it
not?" asked Mr. Untermycr.
"There should be no such practice,"
Mr. Frayne admitted.
Asked how the practice could be cor
recK'd, Mr. Frayne suggested that the
employers and union leaders get to?
gether and thrash the matter out. He
said that he stood ready to render
?very assistance in his power as tho
representative of the American Federa?
tion of Labor.
In this connection It developed that
Thomas J. Williams, a commissioner
of conciliation in the Department of
Labor, had come here from Washington
to help ward off any trouble that might
arise between the. emp oyers and em?
ployees in the building industry about
the first of next ;,*ear, when the con?
tract between the Building Trades Em?
ployers' Association and the Building
Trades Council expires. It is under?
stood that the employers will insist
that the workers accept a reduction in
wages, which tho union men have said
they will oppose.
Doge..? Makes Denial
When informed that the testimony
concerning him was to be sent to the
grand jury Hogan said:
. "I have never touched a cent of the
money belonging to the organization.
Tho books were in confusion, yes, but
I have been trick for months, otherwise
the books wou.d prove what I say. As
to the death benefits, I never wanted
the Smith money and I have agreed to
pay $800 to Mrs. Smith. Ine other
death benefits were from men who had
been living off me for years and it cost,
me more than $1,000 apiece to save
them from starvation."
Walter D. Alien, of ?0 Pearsall
Avenue, Lyn^rook, L. I., a member of
Electrical Union No. S, said that be?
cause of his objections to the methods
of the organization's officers he was<
hounded out. In one instance he saii;
that in one hour the union officials had
put through a resolution authorizing:
ihe purchase of five automobiles for !
themselves, "to ride around in." Al 'en I
said .hese men represented that they '
needed these cars to hunt jobs for
members.
Allen said ho told Commissioner ?
Hirs'-fie'd during an investigation that ;
the workers were required to pay city !
inspectors for tho rght to work or
get off the job.
"What happened?" asked Mr. Unter
myer.
"1 got ?red." replied Allen.
Cl ristian G. Norman, chairman of
the Board of Governors, of the Build?
ing Trades Employers' Association,
added some more alleged abuses by
labor unions to those ho enumerated
yesterday, saying that owners are
fo.eed to employ a foreman for every
four plasterers, "who Bhall do no
work," and that moulding models had
to bo destroyed after their first use
under the rules o' the union men.
He further showed that delegates and
?hop stowan.-?> regulate the amount and
character ?,? Mie work by union men
on a job, and that they even order
work performed n second time at the
cost of the employer.
Thomas Sheridan, financial secretary
of the Plasterers' Union, and John
Pearl, chairman of the executive com?
mittee, also wore examined. Pearl wae
a snappy witness. He sard the "mean?
est of mean" men wns the ono who
started before starting time and
worked after quitting t'rne. He said
the union did "everything imaginable"
to the foreman who ura-ed his men to
work?that they tried to drive him out
of the trade.
"He is 40 per cent meaner than a
pickpocket," summed up Pearl.
The committee adjourned until next
Tuesday morning.

GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala, Dec.
7 (By Tho Associated Press).?The gov?
ernment of President Carlos Herrera
was overthrown at midnight Monday
after fighting in which three persons
were killed and several woundod. Tho
President surrendered his powers to a
provisional government headed by
General Jose Maria Lima, General
Ore liana and Miguel Larrave, former
Undcr-Sccrctary of Wur.
The provisional government Is de?
taining Prosident Herrera under gunrd
;n his home and l\n* imprisoned mem?
bers of his Cabinet, Including Luis P.
Aguirre, Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The casualties came as tho result
of resistance to the revolutionists by
the city police. The country is tran?

Revolt Unpopular, Says Envoy
WASHINGTON, Dox. 7.--i)r. Julio
Bianchi, Minister of Guatemala to the
United States, nnnounced the overthrow
of his government to-night in a state?
ment in which he said
"The revolt was plan
by a small group of men, who impris?
oned the officials of the government
with the aid of ?> few disloyal soldiers
stationed in Guatemala City. President
Herrera and members of his Cabinet
submitted to arrest in order to avoid
fighting a;id bloodshed.
"The rcolt is not supported by the
people of Guatemala, a large majority
of whom are Unionists, members of the
party which elected Carlo? Herrera
President by tho largest vote over cast
in the history of the country.
"As Guatemala now is a state in the
new Republic of Central America, the
revolt, is not only against the govern?
ment of Guatemala, but against the
government of the Republic of Central
America, composed of Guatemala, Hon?
duras and El Salvador.
"I am advised that steps are being
taken by the government of the Re?
public of Central America to suppress
the revolt, and release President
Herrera and members of his Cabinet.
The revolt probably could have been
prevented by President Herrera had
he cared to use all of the powers at
his - -*-?? maud ? the Chief Executive.
"It is my belief that, the people of
Gu*-?..i?-..I_ will rise in support of
President Herrera, and I regret to say ,
I fear serious consequences.''
Dr. Latour, representing the Guate- i
malan Liberals, declared, however, j
that "the Herrera administration was j
overthrown because of the strong popu- j
lar ?'"'--'" ' "r p change in policy."
"As President Herrera and a major?
ity o ii.s iu.mSt.cra o, the Conservative!
party refused to heed public opinion,"
he said, "it became necerieary to em- ?
ploy force to induce their retirement,!
which was fortunately accomplished!
with but, few casualties."
Delay Over Loan Blamed
A statement attributing the over-1
throw of tho government of President]
led and executed
Carlos Herrera to discontent arising
from delay In negotiation*, for a $25,
000,000 i an from tho United States
was issued yesterday by Manuel
Urruela. president of the Comit?
Unionista Centtoamcrican, composed
of Central Americans In this country.
Tho loan, ho said, had been expected
by the poop'o to stabilize the dis?
tressed financial situation In Guate?
mala."
Carlos Herrera became Provisional
President of Guatemala following tho
Tevolution in April, 1920, In which the
government of Estrada Cabrera was
overthrown. Herrera'? government
was recognized by France and the
United States three months later, and
in September of tho same year he was
regularly elected as President for a
I term of nix years.

Leo Urges Changes
In Former Office
At Meyer Inquiry
Would Make Tenure of Of?
fice for Street Head Defi?
nite; Suggests Election of
Accounts Commissioner
John P. Leo, who resigned recently
as Commissioner of the Department of
.Street Cleaning after a dispute with
David Hirshfield-, Commissioner of Ac
connts, told the Meyer committee yes?
terday of improvements that he
thought could be made in both offices.
"I think tha Street Cleaning Corn
mlssoner should have a definite tenure
of office," he said, "and be subject to
removal only for cause."
"And not for a whim?" suggested
Elon R. Brown, counsel to the com?
mittee, a suggestion to which Mr. Leo
assented.
"I think tho Commissioner of Ac?
counts?," the witness continued, "should
be an elective and not an appointive
official. I believe if tho official had to
go before' the people for election we
would have a different grade of men."
Mr. Leo said that the Department of
Street Cleaning ought to be reorgan?
ized and the borough system of ad?
ministration abolished, so that street
cleaning forces at Coney Island, the
Rockawaya and similar resorts could
be reinforced easily in the Bummer by
drawing upon other boroughs where
their services were needed more in the
other seasons.
Francis C. Rippon, a pier expert,
criticized the method of leasing the
new city piers on the Staten Island
water front. The rentals, he said,
barely would cover interest and tax
losses on the investment, leaving noth?
ing for depreciation or other charges.
Clarence King, an expert, called by
the committ.ee, testified regarding an
examination made by him of the man?
datory legislation passed in Albany re?
garding salaries of city and county offi?
cials here. He said that he found that
in the entire city nearly 26 per cent
of the salaries arc mandatory. In some
of the county offices 75 per cent of the
pay roll was fixed by legislation enacted
at Albany,
The committee adjourned for a week.

Harding Plea for
Party Solidarity Is
Scored in Senate
Harrison, of Mississippi,
Sees in the Urging of Re?
publican Line-Up a Move
to Seat Mr. Newberry
I From The Tribun?'? Wa*Kino'- *? Bureau
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.?In a speech
in the Senato to-dav Senator Harri?
eon, of Mississippi, criticized features
of President Harding'? message to
Congress. He also demanded to know
why the Republicans had abandoned
tho railroad bill, and he charged there
was a program.
Senator Harrison especially assailed
tho action of the President in urging
party responsibility and party solidaritj
and for oppoaing the agricultural
"bloc" in one of the allusions he mad?
in the message against division "ac
cording to pursuits."
He declared tho President ought t<
have commended the agricultural group
for the reason that whatever beneficia
legislation had been enacted by Con
green had been due largely to the mem
bcrs of that group.
Ho called attention to the fact tha
when former President Wilson wrot<
a letter appealing for the election o
a Democratic Congress "Rep?blica!
Senators and Representatives cor.
demned it.1*
"You acornea the President for hi
actions," he continued. "You said i
was unfair and had never been don?
by ti President before. And yet th'
President in His speech yesterda;
pleaded for drawing purty lines ii
legislation." *
Senator Harrison suggested that i
might be that this effort of the p-*esi
dent to draw party lines strictly wa
the first move to forcb Republican
into line to vote for the seating o
Senator Newberry, of Michigan, "tki
friend of the President, even though ,
jury of his own constituents convicto?
him by unanimous vote."
The reference to tho Ncwberry cas
led to a discu-sion of the questio
whether Mr. Newberry was guiltj
Senators Watson, of Georgia; Caraway
of Arkansaa, and King, of Utah, too!
part in the debate.
Senator Harrison then resumed, as
sailing Mr. Newberry and continuin,
his f.ritici-m of the President for hi
effort to draw party lines in legisla
tion. He said there were many ques
tions which were not partisan an
Democrats would continue to vote wit
Republicans when measures were pre
rented "in the interest of the people.
Referring to the efforts of the Presi
dent in the extra session to preven
the 50 per cent surtax rate bein
adopted, Senator Harrison charge
that the President wanted to reliev
wealth from its just share of taxatioi
He declared that though the Pre"!
dent stood higher in esteem of th
country than the Republican Congrua
he did not know why this was.
"The good legislation that was passe
did not come at the sugge tion of th
President," said ?Senator Harrisoi
"and good legislation that was su?:

East Side Wants Bridge
Renamed for Roosevelt
Manhattan Square and 59th
Street Plaza Site? AIuo Con
?idered by Aldermen
The suggestion to change the name
of Williarnsburg Bridge to Theodore
Roosevelt Bridge were considered yes?
terday by the committee on public
thoroughfares of the Board of Alder?
men which met at City Hall. Sug?
gestions also were made to give the
name of tho late President to the Plaza
at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street,
and to change the name of Manhattan
Square, in which the Museum of Nat?
ural History is situated at Eighty-first
St. ?. and Central Park West, to
Roosevelt Pf-rk.
A delegation from the East S'de
headed by Julius Goldman and Dr.
WllMaia I. Sirovieh, advocated the re?
naming of the Williarnsburg Bridge.
Mr Goldman said that he had con?
sulted members of tho Roosevelt fam?
ily and that they favored the change.
Alderman Peter J, McGuinno??, of
Greenpoint, suggested the brid??e be
renamed after the late Senator Patrick
H. McCurran, of Brooklyn.
Alderman Bruce 8?. Falconer r>r^
pose<i that the ?pace at Fifth Avenue
an?! Fifty-ninth Street, be called Roose?
velt Plaza. He pointed out that thii
would be appropriate, as the plaza was
in the district Colmel Roosevelt's
father helped to settle and the Ai
semly District from which Colonel
R-,oseve'<, i"n? ?f^t to the Legislature,
his lirft public office.
'(" e alde-fmanic com mitt?? also con?
sidered the proposed changing to
Blackwe'l's Island, of the present
nnnie. Welfare Island. Commissioner
Bir?4 S Coler, of the Department of
Public Welfare, opposed going back to
the o'd title. He naid the alterations
had been made to take the stigma
from sick persons who were sent to the
hospitals on the island. He added that
since tho name h*d been changed to
Welfare Island the department bad
had little trouble in fretting pupils for
the nurs?*' training school.
Representatives of the Holland So?
ciety and the Son? of the Revolution,
! favored the original designation. They
said th* is'and hid been known by the
name of tho Blackwell family, who had
owned the island, for moro than 300
years. The committee will make its
report to the full board Tuesday.

Before they started on their expedi?
