Both Speak For Conservation of Na
tion's Resources.
Washington. Dec. 9. -President Elect
Taft and President Roosevelt met at
the conservation congress here, and
both spoke from the same platform
urging a liberal policy to save the na
tion's natural riches. President Itoose
Telt said:
The three things which should be done
without any further delay are. first, to
provide for a comprehensive plan (.if wa
terway development; second, to begin at
once on work sUready planned that will
surely fit into the larger plan: third, to
provide amply for forest protection against
lire, against reckless cutting, against wan
ton or reckless destruction oC ail kinds,
and to secure the Appalachian and White
mountain national forests without delay.
Mr. Taft, who was met with si round
f cheering, led by the president, said:
A conservation nlan to be effective must
be one comparatively large enough to TO RENT Five rooms
rover the whole country. No one state is
financially equal to the carrying out of an
adequate conservation policy. It is vitally
necessary that we have co-operation on
the part of the states.
I assure you of my deep sympathy with
this movement and of my purpose to car
ry on the policy so admirably begun and
prosecuted by President Roosevelt.
I agree with what the president has
said about the issuance of federal bonds
for the funding of permanent national

ed with a foreign war, the executive ;
power could proceed at once to .trans- i
form enthusiastic and patriotic citizens '
Into efficient and organized soldiers."
It. is pointed out by the president
that the proposed measure would not
call for a dollar's expenditure during
the years of peace, and its enactment j
into law now "wouid merely be to
place at the disposal of the executive
power machinery whereby should war
threaten the means to wage it could
be swiftly brought into being."
The proposed bill is elastic. T'nder
its provisions a force of 2.00fi.0cH) men
could be raised as well a one of ,1o.-00(1.
