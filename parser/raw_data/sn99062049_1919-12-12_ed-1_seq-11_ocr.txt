Among tile things recommended by
tile message are:
1
The budget system of government

Tanl'l changes to conform to. the
fact that the United States is the

The Lane plan for putting soldiers

ployment. service for the returned
men ..............
Hotter regulation of colli storage.
More democracy in industry.
Passing of peace treaty.
In view of the fact thai the Repub
licans control congress the president
message will probably have little ef
fect. The Republicans in the senate
threaten to lay the peace treaty on tjie
itable and take up domestic issues un
less the president offers some basis
for compromise. He has not. as wt
receded from his position to "take it
or leave" which he declared for from
the beginning.
Conservatives iitil Radicals
People who have been afraid all
along that labor might becom'c radical
have a good deal to think about in the
present coal situation. The strike is
the weapon of conservative labor. Po
litical action is the major waepon
urged by most of the so-called danger
ous radicals like Debs, Morris Hi'.quit
and Thomas Van Lear. The conserva
tive leaders have preached cratt union
ism and alliance with old-party lead
ers, with the strike as the means of
securing bettor conditions in the
trade.
Conservative labor, as represented
by Gompers, Lewis of the miners and
other federation chiefs, had had to
call two big strikes, the steel strike
and the coal strike, which bring g.-eat
distress to the public. Their political
"friends" have failed them absolutely.
The politicians have refused to, do a
thing to bring the trust officials to
terms.
If, on the other hand, labor had t.i.l:
en up independent political action
years ago, it would now have consid
erable power in the government. It
could have raised an effective voice
against war profiteering, it could
have kept wages up to the cost of liv
ing by regulation, and the country
would bo immensely better off. Labor
would not now have to strike to
keep the children from going Iv.in-

Minneapolis an honest, businesslike

mayor Minneapolis had less strikes

In the wild ranting about, bolshev
jsm, Americanism, wicked foreigners,
red rascals and what not, we arc like
ly to forget that most of what the
general run of so-called radicals ad
vocate is needed by the people for
continued prosperity and happiness.
THU MAX WOULD
The world which we must seek is a
world in which the cro:tive spirit is
alive, in which lie is an adventure full
of joy and hope, based rather upon
the impulse to construct that upon
the desire to retain what we possess
or to sieze what is possessed by others
It must be a world in which affection
has free play, in which love is purged
of the instinct for domination, in
which cruelty and envy., have been
dispelled by happiness and the un
fettered development of all the in
stincts that build up life and till it
with mental delights. Such a world
is possible it watis only for men to
create it.
Meantime, the world in which we
exist has other aims. But it will pass
away, burned up in the fire of its own
hot passions and from its ashes will
spring a new and younger world, full
of fresh hope, with the light of morn
ing in its eyes.—Bertrand Russell.'
TKIOATING THK SYMPTOMS
In dealing with radicalism, our pub
lic officials from the national admin
istration down to governors and may
ors are giving their attention to sup
pression of symptoms rather than
the removal of the causes. So long
as these methods are followed, to the
exclusion of a real cure, we may x
pect plenty of symtoms. During the
war we heard a great deal about
new day in industry. The war is over
and laboring people tind at they are
living in the same old world. Their
relation to industry is exactly the
same as before, and even though
their wages have been increased in
dollars they find it increasingly diffi
cult to make both ends meet on ac
count of the high cost of necessities.
On the other hand, they see how
great profiteers made millions and
billions out of the war. This is the
cause of the wave of radicalism that
is sweeping the country. It can not
be stopped by suppressing free
speech, curtailing the freedom of
the press or throwing men into jail.
Nothing will stop it but democracy in
industry and a fairer division of the
products of labor.—Nebraska Union
Farmer.

Minnesota Attorney General Finds
Loop Hole-« for the Governor
St. Paul. Minn.—The removal of
John (rowan. Ortonville (Minn.)
sheriff, who acted with the American
Legion members in that town in the
breaking up of a public meeting and
the deportation of the speaker, former
Congressman Luiuleen, was put up to
(iovernor liurnquist again las: week
by Attorney General Clifford L. Hi.
ton.
Governor Burnquist attempted to
pass the buck to the attorney general
hut the latter passed it right back.
The attorney general, however, of
fred the governor two ways out of
the embarassing position lie finds
himself in.
In his formal opinion the attorney
general suggests that the governor
hold a "preliminary examination tr
determine for himself if the sheriff's
offense were serious enough to justify
the appointing of a commissioner tr
take testimony. There is no provision
in the Minnesota law for such a 'pre
liminary investigation."
Another Way Oul
The second way out suggested by
the attorney general is contained in
the second paragraph of his opinion,
which calls the governor's attention
to the fact that Lundeen can sue the
sheriff for damages or file a com
plaint for criminal prosecution in the
state courts.
The ''preliminary examination"
plan will allow the governor to apply
a coat of whitewash to Sheriff
Gowan.
The second way out will relieve the
governor of all further responsibility
in the matter, although by refusing
to appoint a commissioner to take
testimony, the governor will be act
ing contrary to law.
The ouster proceedings against
Sheriff Gowan were instituted by the
World War Veterans' association, an
organization of former service men,
whose slogan is, "The enforcement or'
the Constitution a.i it is written."
The veterans are collecting a de
fense fund in Minnesota and have
announced their intention of prosecut
ing every person participating in mob
outrages.
Although the state organization of
the American Legion has announced
campaign for law and order, the Or
tonville post of the American Legion
has adopted a resolution conunendin
Sheriff Gowan for his action in the
Lundeen case. By inference, the
resolution also commends the part
played by the Legion men, who lock
ed Lundeen in a refrigerator car, just
as a freight train was pulling out of
Ortonville.
