WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. President Wilson, in his
annual address to congress today gave his answer to
those who contend that the United States is unprepared
for national defense.
The Country Misinformed.
"Let there be no misconception," he said. The coun
try has been misinformed. We have not been negligent
of national defense. We are not unmindful of the great
responsibility resting upon us. We shall learn and profit
by the lesson of every experience and every new circum
stance; and what is needed will be adequately done."

senators and representatives ntcw . Je president, read
- ing his addressin person from the clerk's desk, outline
the administration's legislative program and voice a fer
vent hope that the United States might be instrumental
in bringing peace to Europe. The legislative program
includes passage of the conservation bills, the bills for
ultimate independence of the Philippines, ratification of
the London convention for safety at sea, a government
owned merchant marine, charting the perilous waters of
the Alaskan coast, and measures for economy in all of the
branches of the government.
But the portion of the president's address which com
manded intense interest was that in which he discussed
the subject of national defense.
Prepared Jor War.
"It is said in some quarters that we are not prepared
for war," said the president. "What is meant by being
prepared? Is it mean that we are not ready upon brief
notice to put a nation in the field, a nation of men trained
to arms? Of course we are not ready to do that ; and we
shall never be in time of peace so long as we retain our
present political principles and institutions. And what
is it that it is suggested we should be prepared to do? To
defend ourselves against attack ? We have always found
means to do that, and shall find them whenever it is nec
essary, without calling our people away from their neces
sary tasks to render compulsory military service in times
of peace.
"From the first we have had a
clear and settled policy with regard
to military establishments. We never
Jiave had, and while we retain our
present principles and ideals, we nev-
Uiey can command a littlo freedom
and can seek the nhvsl

sake, if for notliinir

yourselves? We reply, most assured
ly; and yet we shall not turn Amer

not ask our young men to spend the
test years of their lives making sol
diers of themselves. There Is an
other sort of energy in ui. It will
know how to declare itself and make
itself effective hould occasion arise.
And especially when half the world
is on fire we ehall be careful to make
our moral insurance against the
spread of the conflagration very def

"Let us remind otirselres, there

will do. We must d?pend in every
time of national peril. In the future

"It Is right, too, that the National
Ouard of the states should he de

means which is not lnconsltent with
out obligations'to our own people or
with the established policy of our
government. And this, also, not
becsise the time or occasion specially
calls for such measures, but because
it should be our constant policy to
, make these provisions for our na
tional peace and safety.
".More than this carries with it a
reversal of the whole history and I

this, proposed at this time, permit
me to say, would mean merely that

PETROGRAD, Dec. 8. The newspapers here con
tinue to claim that the Germans lost one hundred thou
sand men in the month's fighting about Lodz. Several
generals remained on the tiring line so long that they
escaped the Russians only on motor cycles. The Germans
escaped from the ring placed about them in a series of
night attacks with bayonets. Their losses are officially
stated as "unheard of."
Several Turkish officers are said to be serving with
the Germans in Poland.
An official statement today describes the fighting
about Lodz, saying that on November 19, the Germans
penetrated the Russian front on the Vistula river. The
report says, "this was followed by the driving of the
German avalanche into the opening thus made." This
avalanche for a time ignored the Russians about Lodz,
but made frantic attacks on the Russians north of Lodz.
The Russians then began to surround the Germans who
had penetrated the lines, and their attacks were ferocious.
