WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—The suc

(or supplemental legislation, to make
it more effective, was the gist ot
President Taft'B message, on foreign
relations, the first of a series of mes
sages which together will take the
place of the customary Annual mes

The president also dealt extensively
with the necessity of co-operation be

Discussing Investigations ot foreign

that lack of capital and a sufficient

velopment of our agricultural Inter

A solution of the problem, he said,
was to be found in the reports made
by our diplomatic representatives and
submitted to the congress of gov
ernors now meeting in Richmond, Va.,
as to rural credit planB.
Reviewing legislation accomplished
and thwarted during hlB term, the
president advocated the immediate

to the killing of first the father and
then the son. Snead's friends, how
ever, regard his acquittal aB a victory
which will cover both caseB.
Under Judge Swayne's instructions,
the jury could find Snead not guilty
