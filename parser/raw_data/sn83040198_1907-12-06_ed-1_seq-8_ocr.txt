Washington. Dec. 3. President
Roosevelt s annual message to congress
it a voluminous document of nearly
10,000 words, by far the longest mes
sage he has ever submitted to congress.
The opening subject of the message Is
the financial condition of the country,
and for which the president lays much
f the blame upon unscrupulous stock
peculators, and says:
"In any large body of men, however,
there are certain to be some who are
dishonest, and if the conditions are
such that these men prosper or corn
nit their misdeeds with Impunity, their
example is a very evil thing for the
community. Where these men are busi
ness men of great sagacity and of tem
perament both unscrupulous and reck
less, and where the conditions are such
that they act without supervision or
control and at first, without effective
Check from' public opinion, they delude
many innocent people Into making in
vestments or embarking In kinds of
business that are really unsound.
When the misdeeds of these successful
ly dishonest men are discovered, suf
fering comes not only upon them, but
Bpon the innocent men whom they
have misled. It is a painful awakening,
whenever It occurs; and, naturally,
when it does occur those who suffer
are apt to forget that the longer It was
Referred the more painful It would be.
In the effort to punish the guilty It is
both wise and proper to endeavor so
tar as possible to minimize the dls
tress of thoee who have been misled by
the guilty. Tet It is not possible to
jrjfraln because of such distress from
striving to put an ena to the misdeeds
that are the ultimate causes of the suf
fering, and, as a means to this end,
where possible to punish those re
sponsible for them. There may be hon
t differences of opinion as to many
governmental policies; but surely there
n be no such differences as to the
,eed of unfUnchlng perseverance in the
"Sra? af aThst successful dishonesty."
He quotes at length from his mes
sage of last year in which he advo
cated federal control of corporations
doing interstate business, and believes
that in such control would be found the
remedy for overcapitalization and
Stock speculation which he believes
have brought about the present finan
cial conditions. He says:
"Our steady aim should be by legls
'lation. Aiutiously and carefully under
taken, but resolutely persevered in, to
ssert the sovereignty of the national
government by affirmative action.
"This is only in form an innovation.
In substance it is merely a restoration;
for from the earliest time such regula
tion of industrial activities has been
recognized in the action of the law
making bodies; and all that I propose
Is to meet the changed conditions in
such manner as will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power it has
always possessed, not only in this coun
try, but also in F.nglnnd before and

shonld be so framed as to give to the
Interstate commerce commission power
to.pass upon the future Issue of securi
ties, while ample means should be pro
vided to enable the commission, when
ever ln Its judgment It Is necessary, to
mak'e a physical valuation of any rail
road. As 1 stated in my message to the
eongress a year ago, railroads should
tfe given power to enter into agree
ments, subject to these agreements be-
lag made public In minute detail and U

commission being first obtained. Until

In the exercise of the authority It al
ready possesses, tt wtll be Impossible
either to give to or to ret from the
railroads full Justice. The railroads
and all other great corporations will
do well to recognise that this control
must come; the only question Is m to
what governmental, body can most
wisely exercise It The courts will de
termine the limits within which the
federal authority can exercise It and
there will still remain ample work
within each state for the railway com
mission of that state; and the national
Interstate commerce commission will
work In harmony with the several state
commissions, each within its own prov
ince, to achieve the desired end.
, Coatrol of Interstate
Business Concerns Urged.
"Moreover, In my Judgment there should
be additional legislation looking to the
proper control of the great business con
cerns engaged In Interstate business, this
control to be exercised for their own
benefit and prosperity no less than for
the protection of investors and of the
general public. As I have repeatedly
said in messages to congress and else
where, experience has definitely shown
not merely the unwisdom but the futility
of endeavoring to put a stop to all busi
ness combinations. Modern Industrial
conditions are such that combination is
not only necessary but Inevitable. It is
so In the world of business Just as It is
so In the world of labor, and it is as Idle
to desire to put an end to all corpora
tions, to all big combinations of capital,
as to desire to put an end to combina
tions of labor. Corporation and labor
union alike have come to stay. Each if
properly managed Is a source of good
and not evil. Whenever In either there
la evil, it should be promptly held to ac
count; but it should receive hearty en
couragement so long as it is properly
managed. It Is profoundly Immoral to
put or keep on the statute books'a law,
nominally in the Interest of public moral
ity, that really puts a premium upon
public immorality, by undertaking to
forbid honest men from doing what must
be done under modern business condi
tions, so that the law Itself provides that
its own Infraction must be the condition
precedent upon business success. To aim
at the accomplishment of too much usu
ally means the accomplishment of too lit
tle, and often the doing of positive dam
age. "The antitrust taw should not be re
pealed; but It should be made both more
efficient and more In harmony with act
ual conditions. It should be so amended
sa to forbid only the kind of combination
which does harm to the general public,
such amendment to be accompanied by,
or to be an incident of, a. grant of su
pervisory power to the government over
these big corporations engaged in Inter
state business. This should be accom
panied by provision for the compulsory
publication of accounts and the subjec
tion of books and papers to the Inspec
tion of the government officials. A be
ginning has already been made for such
supervision by the establishment of the
bureau of corporations.
"The antitrust law should not prohibit
combinations that do no Injustice to the
public, still less those the existence of
which Is on the whole of benefit to the
public. But even If this feature of the
law were abolished, there would remain
as an. equally objectionable feature the
difficulty and delay now incident to its
enforcement The government must now
submit to Irksome and repeated delays
before obtaining a final decision of the
courts upon proceedings Instituted, and
even a favorable decree may mean an
empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to
control these corporations by lawsuits
means to Impose upon both the depart
ment of Justice and the courts an Im
possible burden; It Is not feasible to carry
on more than a limited number ot such
suits. Such a law to be really effective
must of course be administered by an
executive body, and not merely by means
of lawsuits. The design should be to
prevent the abuses incident to the crea
tion of unhealthy and improper combina
tions, instead of waiting until they are
in existence and then attempting to de
stroy them by civil or criminal proceedings.
Inventing Public Should
lie Amply Sufegcnreled.
"The congress has the power to churfr
corporations to engage in interstate and
separate j foreign commerce, and a general law can
be enacted under the provisions of which
existing corporations could take out fed
eral charters and new federal eorpora-
I t:ons could be created. An essential pro-
vision of such a law should be a method
( of predetermining by some federal board
j or commission whether the applicant for
a federal charter was an association or
combination within the restrictions of the
. federal law. Provision should also be

cerned and of the actual needs of the
situation. Only a special body of men
acting for the national government un
der authority conferred upon It by the
congress is competent to pass Judgment
on such a matter.
Greater Elasticity la
Cnrreaey Is Urged.
The president auotM rtnei fm
lt message in dealing with th d
net object t currency legislation, and
says:
1 again urge on tit congress the need
f immediate attention to this matter.
We need a greater elasticity In our our
racy; provided, of coarse, that w recog
nise the even greater need of a safe and
secure currency. There must always be
the most rigid examination by the na
tional authorities. Provision should be
made for an emergency currency. The
emergency Issue should, of course, be
made with an effective guaranty, and up
on conditions carefully prescribed by the
government Such emergency issue must
be based on adequate securities approved
by the government, and must be Issued
under a heavy tax. This would permit
currency being Issued when the demand
for It was urgent, while securing Its re
tirement as the demand fell off. It is
worth investigating to determine whether
officers and directors of national banks
should ever be allowed to loan to them
selves. Trust companies should be sub
ject to the same supervision as banks;
legislation to this effect should be en
acted for the District of Columbia and
the territories.
'Tet we must also remember that even
the wisest legislation on the subject can
only accomplish a certain amount No
legislation can by any possibility guar
antee the business community against the
results of speculative folly any more than
It can guarantee an Individual against the
results of his extravagance. When an In
dividual mortgages his house to buy an
automobile he Invites disaster; and when
wealthy men, or men who pose as such,
or are unscrupulously or foolishly eager
I to become such, Indulge ln reckless spec-
ulatlon-especlally if It Is accompanied by
dishonesty they Jeopardize not only their
own future but the future of all their In
nocent fellow-citizens, for they expose
the whole business community to panic
and distress."
He advises against any general tariff
leg'slatlon this session of congress, and
says:
"In a country of such phenomenal
growth as ours It Is probably well that
every dozen years or so the tariff laws
should be carefully scrutinized so as to
see that no excessive or Improper bene
fits are conferred thereby, that proper
revenue Is provided, and that our
foreign trade Is encouraged. There
must always be as a minimum
a tariff which will not only al
low for the collection of an ample rev
enue but which will at least make
good the difference In cost of production
here and abroad; that is, the difference In
the labor cost here and abroad, for the
well-being of the wage-worker must ever
be a cardinal point of American policy.
The question should be approached pure
ly from a business standpoint; both the
time and the manner of the change being
such as to arouse the minimum of agi
tation and disturbance ln the business
world, and to give the least play for
selfish and factional motives. The sole
consideration should be to see that the
sum total of changes represent the pub
lic good. This means that the subject
cannot with wisdom be dealt with In the
year preceding a presidential election, be
cause as a matter of fact experience has
conclusively shown that at such a time
It Is Impossible to get men to treat It from
the standpoint of the public good. In my
Judgment the wise time to deal with the
matter Is Immediately after such elec
tion." He asks for the repeal of the tariff on
paper and wood pulp.
He reviews and enlarges upon his pre
vious recommendations for the enact
ment of federal inheritance and Income
tax laws.
Attention Is called to the prosecution of
wealthy offenders against the national
laws, and ln this connection he asks that
the laws under which these prosecutions
are brought be strengthened and made
more definite.
The Use and the
AboRe of Injunction.
"Instances of abuse In the granting of
Injunctions In labor disputes continue to
occur, and the resentment In the minds
of those who feel that their rights are
being Invaded and their liberty of action
and of speech unwarrantably restrained
continues to grow. Much of the attack
on the use of the process of Injunction ta
wholly without warrant; but I am con
strained to express the belief that for
some of It there Is warrant This ques
tion is becoming more and more of prime
importance, and unless the courts will
themselves deal with it In effective man
ner, it is certain ultimately to demand
some form of legislative action. It would
be most unfortunate for our social wel
fare if we should permit many honest
and law-abiding citizens to feel that
they had just cause for regarding our
courts with hostility. I earnestly com
mend to the attention of the congress
this matter, so that some way may be
devised which will limit the abuse of In
junctions and protect those rights which
from time to time it unwarrantably In
vades. Moreover, discontent Is often ex
pressed with the use of the process of
injunction by the courts, not only In la
bor disputes, but where state laws are
concerned. I refrain from discussion of
this question as I am informed that It
will soon receive the consideration of the
supreme court"
Of other legislation In the Interest of
labor he favors federal Inspection of rail
roads; providing limited but definite com
pensation for accidents to all workmen
employed ln any way by the government,
and says:
The constitutionality of the employers'
liability act passed by the preceding con
gress has been carried before the courts.
In two Jurisdictions the law has been de
clared unconstitutional, and In, three Juris
dictions its constitutionality has been af
firmed. The question has been carried to
t..e supreme court, the case has been
heard by that tribunal, and a decision is
expected at an early date. In the event
that the court should affirm the consti
tutionality of the act, I urge further leg
islation along the lines advocated ln my
message to the preceding congress. The
practice of putting the entire burden of
loss of life or limb upon the victim or
ti;e victim's family is a form of social In
justice In which the United States stands
In unenviuble prominence. In both our
federal and our state legislation we have,
with few exceptions scarcely cone
I farther than tbo repeal of the feilow
j Servant principle of the old Jaw of liabil
I l'y. and in some of our states even this

out-
He favors the extension of the
eight-
ho'jr law to all d'-p-irtnit-nts of th
ernn.ent, i.id te .ill work curt
'd on by
I the government. He ures legislation
i for the empui.oory Investigation cf In
dustrial disputes, and says:
"The need for some provision for such
Investigation was forcibly Illustrated
during the past summer. A strike of
tleirr:inh nnerator serini'Qlv inferf..r
with telegraphic communication, caus
ing great damage to business, interests
; and serious inconvenience to the gen
' eral public. Appeals were made to me
j from many parts of the country, from
! city councils, from boards of trade,
, from chambers of commerce, and from
, labor organizations, urging that steps
1 be taken to terminate the strike.
J Everything that could with any pro
priety be done by a representative of
j the government was done without avail,
; and for weeks the public stood by and
j suffered without recourse of any kind.
I Had the machinery existed and had
I there been authority for compulsory
j investigation of the dispute, the public
would have been placed In possession
ot the merits of the controversy, and
I public opinion would probably have
I brought about prompt adjustment
1 It U idle to hold that without goo
laws trlls inch as child labor, u the
ver-worklsg of women, as the fall
re to protect employes from lot of
life or limb, can be effectively reawhed,
any more than the evils of rebates and
stock-waierie can bo reached without
good laws. To fall to stop these prac
tices by legislation means U lores
honest men Into them, because other
wise the dishonest who surely will
take advantage of them will have
everything their own way. If the states
will correct these evils, well and good;
but the nation must stand ready to aid
them.
Inland Waterway Systems
Shoald Be Deevloped.
The conservation of our national re
sources and their proper use constitute
the fundamental problem which under
lies almost every other problem of our
national life. We must maintain for
our civilisation the adequate material
basis without which that civilization
cannot exist We must show foresight,
we must look ahead. As a nation we
not only enjoy a wonderful measure of
present prosperity but If this prosper
ity Is used aright It is sn earnest of
future success such ss no oth r nntlon
will have. The reward of for-sight foi
this nation is great and epsily foretold.
But there must be the I00W nhead.
there must be a reallzitlon of tc fact
that to waste, to destrov. our natural
resources, to skin and exlnuit t land
Instead of ucinff it so as to Iwnr.e It
usefulness, will result In und rmlnlni
In the diys of our children the very
prosperity which we oug! t by rlht to
hand down to them amplified and devel
oped. For the last few years, through
several agencies, the government has
been endeavoring to get our people to
look ahead and to substitute a planned
and orderly development of our re
sources in place of a haphazard striv
ing for Immediate profit. Our great
river systems should be developed as
national water highways; the Missis
sippi, with Its tributaries, standing first
In Importance, and the Columbia sec
ond, although there are many others of
Importance on the Pacific and Atlantle
and the gulf slopes. The national gov
ernment should undertake this work,
and I hope a beginning will be made
In the present congress; and the great
est of all our rivers, the Mississippi,
should receive especial attention. From
the Great Lakes to the mouth of the
Mississippi there should be a deep wa
terway, with deep waterways leading
from it to the east and the west Such
a waterway would practically mean
the extension of our coast line into the
very heart of our country. It would be
of Incalculable benefit to our people. If
begun at once It can be carried through
In time appreciably to relieve the con
gestion of our great freight-carrying
lines of railroads. The work should be
systematically and continuously carried
forward In accordance with some well
conceived plan. The main streams
should be Improved to the highest
point of efficiency before the Improve
ment of the branches is attempted; and
the work should be kept free from
every taint of recklessness or Jobbery."
Attention Is called to the work of Ir
rigation and reclamation of govern
ment lands. In the same connection he
asks for a revision of the public land
laws along the lines proposed by the
public lands commission. Believes the
government should Increase Its efforts
to conserve our. forests and should in
crease by purchase the existing forest
preserves. On the subject of the natural
resources of the nation he says:
"In the eastern United States the
mineral fuels have already passed Into
the hands of large private owners, and
those of the west are rapidly following.
It Is obvious that these fuels sfiould be
conserved and not wasted, and It would
be well to protect the people against
unjust and extortionate prices, so far
as that can still be done. What has
been accomplished In the great oil
fields of the Indian Territory by the
action of the administration offers a
striking example of the good results
of such a policy. In my judgment the
government should have the right to
keep the fee of the coal, oil and g-.?
fields In Its own possession and to lease
the rights to develop them under
proper regulations; or else. If the con
gress will not adopt this method, the
coal deposits should be sold undir lim
itations, to conserve them as public
utilities, the right to mine coal being
separated from the title to the soil.
The regulations should pirtnit coil
lands to be worked In su;nent quan
tity by the several corpor tlons. The
present limitations have be- n absurd,
excessive, and serve no useful purpose,
and often render it necissary that
there should be either fraud or else
abandonment of the work of getting
1 out the coal."
! Progreim of the Work
j On the Panama CanaL
I "Work on the Fanama canal Is pro
! ceeding In a highly satisfactory man-
ner. In March the total excavation In
the Culebra Cut where effort was
j chiefly concentrated, was 815.270 cubic
yards. In April this Was Increased to
l 879.527 cubic yards. There was a con
' slderable decrease In the output for
1 May and June owing partly to the ad-
vent of the rainy season and partly to
I temporary trouble with the steam
I shovel men over the question of wages.
I This trouble was settled satisfactorily
! to all parties and In July the total ex
cavation advanced materially and in
; August the grand total from all points
in the canal prism by steam shovels
and dredges exceeded all previous
; United States records, reaching 1,274,-
! 404 cubic yards. In September this rec
ord was eclipsed and a total of 1.517,-
' 412 cubic yards was removed. Of this
amount 1,481.307 cubic yards were from
' the canal prism and 36.105 cubic yards
were from accessory works. These re
sults were achieved In the rainy sea
son with a rainfall in August of 11. 8D
Inches and in September of 11.65 Inches.
Finally. In October, the record was
again eclipsed. th total excavation be
ing 1.86S.7I9 cubic yards; a truly ex
traordinary record, especially In view
of the heavy rainfall, which was 17.1
Inches. In fact, experience during the
last two miny seasons demonstrates
that the ra ns are n les serious ob
stacle to prirres th.in has hitherto
been supposed.
"Work on the loks and dims at
Gaf.in. which began actively In March
last h.:s advanced so fir that it is
thought that masonry work on the
locks c;m be begun within 15 months.
"Ui.-t winttr bi?s were requested and
received f jr t'oing the work of canal
construction by cor.tnct. None of them
was found to be satisfactory and all
'were reject d. It is the unanimous
opinion of the present commission that
, the work can be done better, more
cheaply, and more quickly by the gov
ernment than by private contractors.
Fully srt per cent of the entire plant
needed for construction has been pur-
: chased or contracted for; machine
: shops have been erected and equipped

ple economy and thrift and by the use
of postal strings banks to give them
an opportunity to husband their re
sources, partlculsrly those who have
not the fsrllttlts at hand for depositing
their money In savings banks. Viewed,
however, from the -riperlence of the
past few weeks, It Is evident that the
advantages of such an Institution ars

restored to the channels of trade, to
the mutual benefit of capital and labor.
"I further commend tu the congress
the connltli rut ion of the postmaster

the rural routes. Tl.re are now 38,

Corporation Contributions
to Compalga Expenses,
"Under our form of government voting
is not merely a right but a duty, and,
moreover, a fundamental and necessary
duty If a man is to be a good citizen.
It Is well to povlde that corporations
shall not contribute to presidential or
national campaigns, and furthermore to
provide for the publication of both con
tributions and expenditures. There is,
however, always danger in laws of this
kind, which from their very nature are
difficult of enforcement; the danger being
lest they be obeyed only by the honest
and disobeyed by the unscrupulous, so
as to act only as a penalty upon honest
men. Moreover, no such law would ham
per an unscrupulous man of unlimited
means from buying his own way into of
fice. There Is a very radical measure
which would. I believe, work a substan
tial Improvement ln our system of con
ducting a campaign, although I am well
aware that It will take some time for
people to so familiarize themselves with
such a proposal as to be willing to con
sider Its adoption. Tlie need for collect
ing large campaign funds would vanish It
congress provided an appropriation for
the proper and legitimate expenses of
each of the great national parti, s, an ap
propriation ample enough to i:e et the
necessity for thorough organization and
machinery, which requires a large ex
penditure of money. Then the stipula
tion snouia De made that no party re
ceiving campaign funds from t'.ie treasury
should ne'cept more than a fixed amount
from any Individual subscriber or donor;
and the necessary publicity for receipts
and expenditures e-ould without d.fllculty
be provided."
Wants Improvement In the
Ocean Mall Sen Ire.
"I call your especial attention to the un
satisfactory condition of our foreign mail
service, which, because of the lark of
American steamship lines. Is now largely
done through foreign lines, and which,
particularly so far ns South and Central
America are concerned. Is done n a man
ner which constitutes a serious barrier
to the extensions of our commerce.
"The time has come, In my Judgment,
to set to work seriously to make our
ocean mall service ewrrespond more
closely with our recent commercial and
political development. A beginning was
made by the ocean mall act of March 3,
1891, but even at that time the act was
known to be Inadequate In various par
ticulars. Since that time events have
moved rapidly In our history. We have
acquired Hawaii, the Philippines, and
lesser Islands In the Pacific. Te are
steadily prosecuting the great work of
uniting at the Isthmus the waters of the
Atlantic and. the Pacific. To
extent than seemed probably even a
doxen years ago ws may look to an
American future on the sea worthy of
the tradition of our past As the first
step ln that direction, and the step most
feasible at the present time, I recommend
the extension of the ocean mall act of
191. That act has stood for some years
free from successful criticism of Its prin
ciple and purpose. It was based on theo
ries of the obligations of a great mari
time nation, undisputed In our own land
and followed by other nations since the
beginning of steam navigation. Briefly
those theories are, that it is the duty of
a first-class power so far as practicable
to carry Its ore. malls under its own
flag: that the fast ocean steamships and
their crews, required for such mail serv
ice, are valuable auxiliaries to the sea
power of a nation. Furthermore, the
construction of such reamsMps Insures
the maintenance in an elHci.-nt condition
of the shipyards in which our battleships
must be built.

Increase In the navy, snd asks present
congress for appropriations for four
new battleships, and says:
"We need always to remember that
In time of war the navy Is not to be
used to defend harbors and sea-coast
cities; we should perfect our system of (
coast fortifications. The only efficient
use for the navy Is for offense. The
only way In which It can efficiently pro
tect our own coast against the possible
action of a foreign navy Is by destroy
ing thst foreign navy. For defense
against a hostile fleet which actually
attacks them, the coast cities must de
pend upon their forts, mines, torpedoes,
submarines and torpedo boata and de
stroyers. All of these together are ef
ficient for defenstvs purposes, but they
in no way supply tne place or a thor
oughly efficient navy capable of acting
on the offensive; for parrying never yet
won a fight It can only be won by
hard hltlng. and an aggressive sea-go-
Ing navy alone can do this hard hitting
of the offensive type. But tbe forts
and the like are necessary so that the .
navy may be footloose. In time of war
there Is sure to be demand, under pres
sure of fright, for the ships to be scat
tered so as to defend all kind of ports.
I'ndt r penalty of terrible disaster, this
demand must be refused. The ships
must be kept together, and their ob

fortifications are sufficiently strong", no

them, so long as the foe has In exist

should be kept In the Atlantic When
the Isthmian canal Is built the transit
of the battle fleet from one ocean to

Until it Is built I earnestly hope that
the battle fleet will be thus shifted, be
