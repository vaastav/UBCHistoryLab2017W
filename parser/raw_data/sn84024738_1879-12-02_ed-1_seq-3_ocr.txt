T!se arrangement made by the Postmas

iias proved >o satisfactory in its practical
operation that the recommeudation is now
icade t hat Congress shall extend the provi
sions (<f the act. of March 3, 1S70, under
which this arrangement vvps made, so as to
apply to all other dutiable articles received
in the mails from foreign countries.
The reports cf the Secretary of the Inte
rior and of the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs, setting forth the present state of
our relations with the Indian tribes on our
territory, the measures taken to advance
their civilization and prosperity, and the
progress already achieved by them, will be
I found of more than ordinary interest. The
' general conduct of our Indian population
lias been so satisfactory that the occurrence
i o! two disturbances, which resulted in
f bloodshed and destruchon of property, is
ali the more to be lamented.
The history of the outbreak on the White
river Ute reservation in western Colorado
has become so familiar by elaborate reports
in the public press that its remarkable inci
dents need not be stated here in detail. It
i> expected that the settlement of this diffi
culty will lead to such arrangements as will
prevent fuither hostile contact between the
Indians and the border settlements in west
ern Colorado.
The other disturbance occurred at the
Mtscalero :<gency, in New Mexico, where
Victoria, the head of a small band of ma
rauder*, after committing many atrocities,
bein^ vigorously chased by a military force,
made his way across the Mexican border
and i< now on foreign soil.
While these occurrences, in which a com
paratively small number of Indians were
engaged, aic most deplorable, a vast nra
1 iarity of our Indian population have fully
Jas7)fiei\ vi'.e expectations of itiose who be
lieve that by bumuneand peaceful influences
Indian can b" led to abandon the habits
f,I savage life and to develop a capacity for
useful and civilized occupations. What
'.bey have already accomplished in the pur

fetched in the report of the Secretary of
jhe Interior, the object of which is to make

fouth, to settle the Indians upon farm-iots

Tho experiment Of sending a number of
Indian children, of both sexes, to the
Hampton Norma! and Agricultural Insti
tute-, in Virginia, to receive an element iry
English education and practical instruction
in farrotng and o'her useful industries has
led to results so promising that it was
thought expedient to turn over the cavalry
b'i rracks at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to the
Interior Department for the establishment
ot an Indian school on a larger scale. This
school has now one hundred and fifty-eii?tit
pupils, selected from various tribe?, and is'
in full operation. Arrangements are also
made for the education of a number ot In
dian boys and cirls belonging to tribes on
the Pacific slope in a similar manner ut
Forest Grove, in Oregon. These institu
tions will eocnmencl themselves to the libe
rality of Congress, and to the philanthropic
muni licence of the American people.
Last snriog information was received of
the organization of an extensive movement
in the western States, the object of which
was the occupation by unauthorized per
sons of certain lands In the Indian Terri
tory ceded by the C'tierokees to the Govern
ment for the purpose of settlement by other
Indian tribes.
On the 20th of April I issued a proclama
tion warning all persons against participa
tion in such nn alteropr, and by the co
operation of a military force the invasion
was promptly checked. It Is my purpose
to protect the rights of the Indian inhabit
ants of that Territory to the full extent or
the Executive power. But it would be
unwise to ignore the fact that a Territory
so large and so fertile, with a population so
sparse and with so great a wealth of unused
resources, will be found more exposed to
the repetition of such attempts as happened
this year, when the surrounding States are
morn densely settled, and the westward
movement of our population looks still
more eagerly for fresh lands to occupy.
Under such circumstances the difficulty
of maintaining the Indian Territory
in its present state will greatly in
crease, and the Indian tribes inhab
iting it would do well to prepare for such a
contingency. I therefore fullv approve of
the advice civen to them bv the Secretary
of the Interior on a recent occasion, to di
vide among themselves in severalty as large
a quantity of their lands as they can culti
vate. to acquire individual title in fee, in
stead of their present tribal ownership in
common, and to consider in what manner
the balance of their lands may be disposed
of by the Government for their benefit. By
adopting Mich a policy they would more
certainly secure for themselves the value of
their possessions, and at the same time pro
mote their progress in civilization and pros
perity, than by endeavoring to perpetuate
the present state of things iu the Territory.
The qu?stion whether a change in the
control ol the Indian service should be
raad<\ was in the Forty-fifth Congress re
ferred to a joint committee of both houses
for inquiry and report. In my last, annual
message I expressed the hope that the deci
sion of that question, then in prospect,
would arrest further agitation of this sub
ject, such agitation being apt to produce a
disturbing effect upon the service as well as
the Indians themselves." Since tnen, the
committee having reported, the question
has been decided in the negative by a vote
in the House of Representatives.
For the reasons here stated, and in view
of the fact that further uncertainty on this
point will l?e calculated to obstruct other
much-needed legislation, to weaken the
discipline of the service, and to unsettle
salutary measures now in progress for the
government and improvement of the In
dians, I respectfully recommend that the
decision arrived at by Congress at its last
session be permitted to stand.
The efforts made by the Department of
the Interior to arrest the depredations on
the timber-lands of the United States have'
been continued, and have met with consid
I erable success. A large number of cases of
trespass have been prosecuted in the courts
of the United States; others have been set
tled, the trespassers offering to make pav
ment to the Government for the value of
the timber talcen by them. The proceeds
of these prosecutions and settlements turn
ed into the Trea-ury far exceed in amount
the sums appropriated by Congress for this
purpose. A more important result, how
ever, consists in the fact that the destruc
tion of our public forests by depredation,
although such cases still occur, has been
greatly reduced in extent, and it is pro
bable that if the present policy is
vigorously pursued and sufficient pro
vision to that end is made by Con
gress, such trespasses, at least those on
a lar^e scale, can be entirely suppressed,
except in the Territories where timber for
the daily requirements of the population
cannot, "under the present slate of the law,
be otherwise obtained. I therefore earn
estly invite the attention of Congress to
the recommendation made by the Secretary
of the Interior, that a law be enacted ena
bling the Government to sell timber from
the public lands without conveying the fee,
where such lands are principally valuable
for the timber thereon, such sales to be so
regulated as to conform to domestic wants
and business requirements, while at the
same time guarding against a sweeping de
struction of the forest*. The enactment of
such a law appears to become a more press
ing necessity every uay.
JVIv recommendations in former messages
are renewed in favor of enlarging the fa
cilities of the Department of Agriculture,
Agriculture is the leading interest and the
permaoeut industry of our people. It is to
the abundance of agricultural production,
as compared with our home consumption,
and the largely-increased and highly
profitable market abroad which we
have enjoyed in recent years, that
we are mainly indebted for our present
prosperity as a people. We must look
for its continued maintenance to the same
substantial resource. There is no branch
of industry in which labor, directed by sci
entific knowledge, yields sucli increased,
production in comparison with unskilled
labor, and no branch of the public service
to which the encouragement of liberal ap
propriations can be more appropriately ex
tended. The omission to render such aid
is wot a wise economy; but, on the con
trary. undoubtedly results in losses of im
mense sums annually that might be saved
through well-directed efforts by the Gov
ernment to promote this vital interest.
The results already accomplished with
the very limited means heretofore placed at
the command of the Department of Agri
culture ts an earnest of what may be ex
pected with increased appropriations for
the several purposes indicated in the report
of the Commissioner, with a view to
placing the Department upon a footing
which will enable it to prosecute more
effectively the objects for which it is estab
lished.
Appropriating are needed for a more
complete laboratory, for the establishment
of a veterinary division and a division of
forestry, and for an increase of force.
The requirements for these and other
purposes indicated in the report of the
Commissioner under the head of the imme
diate necessities of the Department, will
uot Involve any expenditure of money that
the country caunot with propriety now un
dertake in "the inteiests of agriculture
It is gratifying to learn from the Bureau
of Education the extent to which educa
tional privileges throughout? the United
States have, been advanced during the year.
I No more fundamental responsibility rests
upon Congress than that of devising appro-'
j priate measures of financial aid to educa
' tion, supplemental to local action in the
States and Territories and in the District
of Columbia. The wise forethought of the
founders of our Government has not only
furnished the basis for the support of the
common-school systems of the newer States,
but laid fhe foundations for the mainte
nance of their universities and colleges of
agriculture and the mechanic arts. Mea
sures in accordance with this traditional
policy for the further benefit, of all theso
Interests and the extension of the same ad
vai jUmx to every pprtioa oft be country, it
is iioinni, yrtll j*C?iye your teirorable5 con?

of such a public building, which should

present and for tbe vast increase of the
nation'* books In the future, is a matter
wfiicb addresses itself to the discretion of
Congress. If Is earnestly recommended as
a measure which should unite all suffrages,
and which should no longer be delayed.
The Joint commission created by the act
of Congress of August 2, 1876, for the pur
pose of supervising and directing the com
pletion of the Washington Natioual monu
ment, of which commlssiou tbe President
is a member, has given careful attention to
this subject, and already the *trengthening
of the foundation has so far progressed as
to insure the entire success of this part of
the work. A massive layer of masonry has
been introduced below the oriainal founda
tion, widening the base, increasing the sta
bility of tbe structure, and rendering it
possible to carry the shaft to completion.
It is? earnestly recommended that such fur
ther appropriations be made for the con
tinued prosecution of tbe work as may be
necessary for the completion of this na
tionnl monument at an early day.
In former messages, impressed with (be
importance of the subject, I have taken oc
casion to commend to Congress the ndoi>
tion of a generous policy towards the Dis
trict of Columbia. The report of the Com
missioners of the District, herewith trans
mitted, contains sueaestions and recom
mendations, to all of which I earnestly in
vite your careful attention. I ask your
early and favorable consideration of the
views which they express as to the urgent
need of legislation for the reclama* ion of the
marshes of the Potomac and "its eastern
branch, within the limits of the city, and
Tor the repair of the streets of the capital,
heretofore laid with wooden blocks, and
now by decay rendered almost impassable
and a source of imminent danger, to the
health of its citizens. The means at the dis
posal of the Commissioners are wholly in
adequate for the accomplishment of these
important works, and should be supple
mented by timely appropriations from the
Federal treasury.
The filling of the flat* iu front of the city
will add to the adjacent lands and parks now
owned by the United States, a large and
valuable domain, sufficient, it is thought, to
reimburse its entire cost; and will also, as an
incidental result, secure the permanent im
provement of the river for the purposes of
navigation.
The Constitution having invested Con
gress with supreme and exclu-ive jurisdic
tion over the District of Columbia, its citi
zens must of necessity look to Congress
alone for all needful legislation affectine
their interests ; and as the territory of this
District is the common property of the
people of the United States, who, equally
with its resident citizens, are interested in
the prosperity of tbeir cnpitul, I cannot
doubt that you will be amply sustained by
the general voice of the country in any
measures you may adopt for this purpose.
I aKo invite the favorable consideration
of Congress to the wants of the public
schools of this District as exhibited in the
report of the Commissioners. While the
number of pupils is rapidlv increasing, no
adequate provision exists for a'correspond
ing increase of school accommodation, and
the Commissioners are without the means
to meet this urgent need. A number of the
buildings now used for school purposes are
rented, and are, in important, particulars,
Junsuited for the purpose.. The cause of
popular education in the District or Colum
bia is surely entitled to the same considera
tion at the "hands of the National Govern
ment as in the several States and Territo
ries, to which munificent, grants of the pub
lic lands have been made for the endow
ment of schools and universities.

Tbe Rckdjusters arc more anxious to

debt thau to elect a Democratic senator, and
in this spirit tlicv bave also had some of
their members here during tbe week trying
to arrange terms with the Administration.
One member of tbe Cabinet has at least
been consulted, and a leading western Re
publican senator has also been brought into
tbe matter. Tbe Rettdjuslersmaken square
proposition that if the Administration and
the Republican leaders here will control tbe
Republican members of tbe-L'-'firislature and
get them to vote with tbe Reiidjusters so as
to make a majority, the latter will vote with
tbe Republicans and elect a Republican to
the Senate in place of Mr. Withers.
In so many words, this is a trade proposi
tion by which they can sccurc a United

about thirty million dollars of Virginia debt.
The Administration cannot, of course, be
come a party to any such transaction, and
the Republican members of the Legislature
will be left free to exercise tbeir own judg

PRESIDENTIAL SPECULATIONS.
The Bayard men call attention to tbe lac1;
tbat several of Mr. Eandall's congressional
friends wben recently interviewed express
ed tbe belief tbut tbe distinguished Senator
from Delaware cannot carry New York,
and draw the inrere?ce that tbe Speaker of
the House and bis friends are against bis
nomination. In spite of this the Bayard
men claim that their favorite is gaining
strength daily in Pennsylvania as well as
elsewhere.. The advocates of Mr. Seymour
are conciliatory, and have at every turn to
deny the report tbat he will not accept.
No one says anything unkiud of him, and
all concede that if he will run that be can
carry New York. I beard a Seymour man
to-day assert with a knowing air that Hen
dricks will accept tbe second place on a
Seymour ticket. I found a leading stal
wart journalist in a talking humor this eve
ning, and I said : " Your party will nomi
nate Grant." <4 No," said be ; u it isn't by
a long shot. Now, we won our recent victo
torics with what you call tbe bloody shirt.
Tln-re was no conciliation and none of Mrs.
Winslow's soothing syrup about it. To per
fect it we mean to elect a stalwart Presi
dent and reap the full fruits of a stalwart
victory. We are afraid of Grant. All of
Lis recent utterance? have been for peace
and conciliation. He is bidding for conser
vative support, and must reward, if elected,
conservative supporters. We want no di
vision, but mean to have all of the spoils for
ourselves. That is plain talk," said he,
" but it is honest, as distasteful as it may be
to you sautberners." "Who, then, will
you nominate?" I asked. ** Why, Blaine
or Sherman." This interview staggered me
a little, but I closed it by saying, " You

THE POLITICAL OCTLOOK IN* CONGRESS.
Of course this will be, as everybody says,
a political session, and congressmen will
devote themselves to making-a President.
Up to Christmas the indications now arc
that it will be quiet, but the Republicans
are on the alert, eager to spring any ques
tion that will help them and hurt the Dem
ocrats. Their main design, according to
leaky Radical vessels, is to divide the Lem
oeratic pirty on linance and array the West
against the East. This, they think, will
slaughter Bayard on the one hand, and
Ihurman and Hendricks on the other, and
make a Republican victory next fall easy.
The Democrats have a delicate rdle to play,
and, as a sagacious southern leader says,
they will have to be as wise as ser
pents and a9 harmless as doves. And
yet I have beard to-day several protni
neBt Democratic members of the House
declare that there is no way of avoiding a
renewal of the fight over the issues of last
session. This is what the Republicans say
tbey want, and they smile as they add, And
Mr. Hayes can veto bills and call extra sefc
si9ns every fifteen minutes between July
and December, and then not hurt either
himself or his party by so doing. The Re
publicans, it is easy to see already, mean to
have a long session, and it i9 to their inter
est to have one. On the other hand, Sena
tor Johnston, when he remarked to a party
of Virginians to-day that be wanted an ad
journment by March, 9bowed that he com
prehended the situation; and that is the
feeling of all the most sagacious Democrats
I have conversed with.

BILLS WITH DEBATE IN* THKH.
There are two bills on the Senate calen
dar which will give an opportunity for un
limited polltfcal discussion. The first was
introduced by Mr. McDonald May 6th, and
its object is to prohibit military Interference
nt election'. The second was introduced
by the same Senator May 22d, and is enti
tled a bill to authorize the employment of
the militia and the land and naval forces of
the United States in certain cases and for
other purposes.
A WISE MEASURE OF REFORM.
Last winter Mr. Potter's bill to remove
all war claims and other private claims not
including pensions from Congress to the
Court of Claims passed the House by a
two-thirds vote and ought to have passed
tlie Senate. Senator Johnston has an
nounced that be will introduce substantially
the same bill in the Senate at an early day.
It is a wi<?e measure 01* legislative reform,
and the sooner it becomes a law the better
for the country. Tbe Court of Claims is
Republican, and the Democratic party and
the South cannot be held responsible for its
awards to loyal southern claimants. The
Republicans do not want the bill to pas'.
A RICHMOND CASE IN THE SUPREME COURT.
At a recent term of tlie United States
Circuit Court at Richmond, in the ca3e of
Garnettv.s. Rosenbaum, Judge Bond re
fused an appeal to the defendant, against
whom he had decided the case. Judge
Meredith thereupon applied to the Su
preme Court of the United States for a
mandamus to require the Judge to grant
an appeal. Tbe case was to-day argued in
the Supreme Court by Judge Meredith and
\Y. A. Maury for Rosenbaum, and John
Howard and Major Robert Stiles for Gar
nett. .

Messrs. Pell and Reed, members of tbe

This accords with the President's recom
mendation, but was prepared before his

Suffolk, Ya., December l.?Mws Vir
ginia Rawls, of this place, dSsappenredfrora
home Friday night last, and to-day her body
was found in the bottom of Nanseraond j
river. Doubtless a case of suicide. De
ceased was eighteen years of age.
FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT.
rSpeclnl telegram to the Dlspatfb.l
Suffolk, Va., December 1.? Miss Vir
ginia Bawls, daughter of Mr. P. II. Rawls, j
of this place, committed suicide by drown- j
fog, on last Friday night, November 28tb.
Toe particulars gathered are these: It j
seems that on Friday night Miss Rawls had
company until about 9 o'clock. After their
departure the young lady, as was her cus
tom, retired to her room with her little
brother. After carrying him to his room
she changed her dress, and came down
stairs and stood at the front door. When
asked by her mother to retire, she de
clined, giving as an excuse that she was
not sleepy.
"In a few moments her father came in, and
was asked by his wife If ho had seen Jen
nie. He said he had not, and asked where
she was. Mrs. Rawls said she did not
know, and told Mr. Rawls to make search
fer her at once, which he did. Not finding
her in a short timo, he became greatly
alarmed. A crowd was soon gathered and
the search kept up all that night, but with
out avail. Fears were at once entertained
that she had drowned herself, as she bad
threatened to drown herself before. A
cannon was fired, and parti:s kept drag
ging the river yesterday -and until about 4
o'clock this evening, wheu the body of the
unfortunate girl was found. Her father
had noticed that she had been very de
spondent for several days, but paid no at
tention to it until after her sudden disap
pearance.
Miss Rawls was just eighteen years of
age, and her sad fate is greatly deplored by
her many friends. The parents have the
sympathy of the entire community.
