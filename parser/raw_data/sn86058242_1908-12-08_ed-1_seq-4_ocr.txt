LAWYERS' ARGUMENTS ARE SOUND.
There is a "sound sense in what Hon. A. F. Knotts, president of the
Lake County Bar Association, says in regard to the congestion in the Lake
county courts and this interview, coming from one of the oldest practition
ers in this part of the state, and a man who owns property in both Ham
ond and Gary, will have added weight on that account To put it short,
Mr. Knotts believes that the congestion should be relieved in the quickest
way possible and he does not believe that this can bo done by establishing
a court either it Crown Point or at Gary. Mr. Knotts' opinion will stand the
calcium light and he voices practically the same expression as the other
lawyers on the committee, except those who returned the minority report
last ni eht The interview with Attorney Frank N. Gavit of Whiting in
today's issue is also timely and his argument is sound as well.
. There seems to be a mistaken idea in Gary and that is that the Ham'
mond lawyers speak of Gary in a patronizing way as if they had anything
to do with the question of whether or not Gary should have a court now.
This is of course due largely to "a certain Gary newspaper which has taken
upon itself the task of running the whole city and has made an amusing
failure of it. As the TIMES has pointed out, Gary will get a superior court
when the business warants it. Lake county is a rich county but it is not
throwing any money away, and a good many of the professional and bus
iness men of Gary are beginning to see that the time is not yet ripe for a
superior court.
DID THE WISE THING.
Sam Ableman, the republican candidate for trustee of North township,
will not contest the election. Defeat was naturally a bitter pill for Mr.
Ableman. He worked harder to be elected than any other man on either
county or township ticket from' either party and as it was his first appear
ance in politics, it was hard for hixn to lose. When he has been in a
few more political battles Mr. Ableman won't care so much. He was wise in
refusing to contest, however. People hate a poor loser. The man who
whines and paws the air when he is a loser In one of the battles of life,
generally comes to be despised and pitied. Mr. Ableman retires with far
more friends than he would have if he contested. His opponent was elected
and if he wasn't elected squarely he is ont to blame for it. No one would think
of accusing Mr. Becker with connivance at fraud. His life has been an open
book and the citizens and tax payers of North township are to be congrat
ulated that he is to be the next township trustee. He will be a worthy
successor to F. R. Schaaf, the present trusted guardian of North town
ship's strong box. -
A NEW KINK IN INSURANCE.
WALKING AS AN EXERCISE.
This heart to heart talk will be about
the benefit of walking as an exercise
and the why.
You know physicians recommend this
as the best all around exercise known
to them.
Why?
Let's put the matter In plain speech
and print out the main words in capi
tal letters: ,
In the first place, when you walk
you RAISE THE TEMPERATURE
OF TOUR BODY. It is like putting a
lot of coal in the stove and opening
the draft. There's something doing.
Waste is being carried off and your
muscles and nerves get needed nutri
ment when the temperature is raised.
Besides, you BREATHE MORE
DEEPLY when you walk. And that
puts more oxygen in your blood, and
oxygen is LIFE.
And there's the skin. Millions of
pores little sewers are opened up.
Perspiration carries off waste, waste
which if it stayed in your blood would
poison you.
And your DIGESTION walking aids
that process and puts an edge on your
appetite. And good digestion waits on
appetite.
But that is not all.
There's your diaphram. That useful
thing is a sort of movable stage plat
form between the chest and the abdo
men. It is raised or lowered by the
contraction or swelling of the lungs
When the lungs are filled the diaphram
goes down and presses upon the liver,
stomach and spleen.
Now
This movement of the" diaphram up
and down, especially down, Is like a
massage on the liver, stomach and
spleen. The massage helps to keep
those organs in good order, especially
the liver, ne who walks regularly
and systematically will have no liver
troubles.
Nothing is here said about the MEN
TAL BENEFITS the exhilaration that
comes from being in the open, the joy
that comes In knowing that your whole
organism Is in good working order
and the reaction of the mind on the
body.
Do you see? Especially that about
the diaphram?
It pays to walk, purely as a beneficial
exercise, to say nothing of the enjoy
ment. It pays big.
He who constructed your body did
not intend you to ride. He gave you
two legs.
UP AND DOCTJ If INDIANA
ADE OFF FOR EUROPE.
The wanderlust has again taken pos
session of George Ade, the well-known
Indiana humorist. On Dec. 16 he and

much puszled by the action of a strang

WED ON WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.
Married on her first marriage anni
versary In the eame town and building,
at exactly the same hour, before the
same magistrate and wearing the same
dress and to the close friend and name
sake of her first husband. Miss Kate
Rohrer, a Marion girl of 22 years, has
become the bride of Russel Armstrong
of Lebanon, Ind.
A novel form of insurance has been introduced in Massachusetts which
they call "Bread and Butter Insurance." It Is as easy to insure your life
in the Bay state now as it is to buy a drink in Lake county on Sunday.
Every savings bank is authorized to conduct an insurance department where
a man or a woman can be insured in three sizes, according to the capacity
of the pocketbook, at a cost of from fifty cents to $1.25 per month. A man
of twenty-five years can get, for example, for 65 cents per month the sum
of $250 at the age of 65 or the same policy may become an annuity at $50
per year. Or for 50 cents a month he may secure a paid-up policy of $250
when he reaches the age of 75. His life is, of course insured in the
meantime for the full amount of the policy. The third degree is for an en
dowment policy of $246 which costs 50 cents a month until you are 65 years
old when it is paid in full. The state pays the cost of the actuary's de
partment and no solicitors are allowed to canvass for the bread and butter
insurance, so the cheapness of the rates is thus accounted for to some ex
tent. It is- said that the scheme is working pretty well and that all it
needs Is a press agent. The law in itself reminds one of the laws passed
by some of the recent Indiana legislatures It is so different.
WHY DESTROY A CHILD'S FAITH.
This is about the time of the year when a lot of parents, and especially
others begin to do their annual fuming as to whether their children should
be allowed to believe in Santa Claus. It seems rather hard, to us of the
past generation of Santa Claus believers, that the children of today have
all their childish faith shattered in Kris Kringle. Why must children be
brought up not to believe in the exquisite fairy tales and fanciful creations
we all so loved in bygone days? Why must children be taught that they
must not believe in these things? Why destroy the .illusions of childhood
anyway? Tots leave chldhood all too soon and are plunged into the stern
realities of life when they are unprepared for it. What harm did any child
ever get from believing in Santa Claus and the beautiful world-wide Christ
mas legend? ' .
THE SEVERING OF amateur athletic relations with England appears
to have been accomplished as far as the Amateur Athletic Union is, con
cerned, but it will not necessarily precipitate an international crisis. It
looks like a rather boyish performance, resembling the unpleasantness ex
pressed in the lines of the ditty about refusing the other girl the privilege
of sliding down her cellar door.
FORTY-SEVEN THOUSAND head of cattle, 62,000 hogs and 46,000
sheep, not to" mention thousands of other animals, including horses and
calves, arrived at the Chicago stockyards one day recently and remind us
of the impressive fact that the Windy city is not losing her grip as the
greatest live stock center in the world.
LOWELL HAS A nine year old boy named Meritous who is a confirmed
-housebreaker. It is pretty hard to reconcile the lad's front name and his
chosen occupation, but if he lives to be old enough to crack safes, the
newspapers will certainly have a lot of fun with Meritous.
THE LATEST ANGLE in the Lake county court fight is that East
.Chicago has leaped Into the breach with a demand for a court Now, to
make it unanimous, let Indiana Harbor and Hobart also get busy.
IT IS FUNNY, said an East Chicago woman the other day, "how
money goes. I started shopping with ten dollars and really I haven't bought
anything and it 13 all gone." Pity the poor ladies these days!

New York, Dec. 8. (Special.) It be
came known today that Mrs. Foxhall
Keene had filed a suit for separation
from her husband. The case came up
for trial before Justice Marean In the
Mineola supreme court today. As Mr.
Keene Is in Colorado and cannot get
here until Thursday, the case was set
over for that day.
The proceeding today was the first
hint that the troubles of the Keenes
had come to a suit, the prellmlnary
proceedlngs having been conducted so
quietly as to escape public notice. ;
Mr. and Mrs. Kenee separated about
three years ago. At that time they
were living at their summer home.

Friends of the couple then declared
their quarrel was. not serious and would

however, that it all will be disclosed at
the trial.
At the time of the separation Colonel

admitting that his daughter and her
husband had decided to live apart, as

What Attorney Manlove Says!
Position Taken by Gary Lawyer in Regard to Gary Ear
Attorney George Manlove outlined
the position of the Gary bar and the
people of Gary in an interview with a
reporter for The Times last evening.
"Gary did not withdraw from the
Lake County Bar association, it simply
withdrew from the meeting after the
minority report Jiad been turned down.
This is but the beginning of the fight- '
love that it is too bad that the inevit
able rivalry between the cities of Norh
ownshlp, comprising Hammond, East
Chicago, Indiana Harbor and Whiting,
should have been precipitated so soon.
It is sure to come some time, but It
might have been delayed a little while.
Mr. Manlove replied that this rivalry
was sure to develop sooner or later
and that It might as well be precipi
tated now as in the future. That gives
of the members of the bar an Idea of he fighting spirit of the peo
ple of Gary, and It is very likely that
the coming contest for additional court
facilities In Lake county will be a
memorable one.
"Some
have made the statement that they are
in the fight for five years if it takes
that long to win out. I know the peo
ple in the rest of Lake county think
we are presuming too much to ask for
a court, but they will see that we really
mean to get one before we are through
with the fight.
"Even if the lawyers of Gary could
be persuaded that it would be better
for them to drop the fight now and
wait until they could secure the co
operation of the rest of the county later
on, I doubt whether the business men
of the city could be prevailed upon to
drop the contest.
It'a Now or Never.
"The people of Gary have got it Into
their heads that they are going to have
a superior court and they will not stop
until they get one. They are also firm
In the conviction that if they do not
prevent Hammond from getting its ad
ditional court now the new judge will
absorb the extra business of Lake
county and It will be a long time be
fore Gary will get a court.
"They may be wrong or they may be
right in that contention, but the fact
remains that the people of Gary are
convinced that it is a case of 'now or
never' with them and they propose to
fight for a court now.
"While I will admit that the odds
are against us in this fight, you never
can tell what you can do until you try.
You don't suppose the people of the
city of Boston thought the United
States would win the war of the rebel
lion when they threw the English tea
overboard?"
Mr. Manlove says the people of Gary
would have been better off if they had
never permitted their end of the mat
ter to come up in the Lake County Bar
association. He says they could have
fought It out alone with better results.
