Oregonian comment upon this part of the president's message.
The Portland paper has said with fine scorn that the East Orego

will call attention therefore to the fact we have distinguished

HAS OUR KING LOST HIS KROWN?
IT has been several days since Kiiur Ottenheinior issued a
ukase with reference to his desires in the w ay of road work j
in Oreiroii and particularly in respect to His Lordship's par-'
titular wish that there be 8 "winter highway" between Wallula
and Umatilla so that the fastidious traveller seeking the Jones
Cash store will not have to journey over the roiitfh trail between
Walla Walla and our cowboy town. It is also noticeable that
certain other Portland champions of the Wallula Way have be
come oppressively silent.
Is there deep meaning in this? Is it possible our friend has
lost his throne so soon ami no longer holds sway over the high
way affairs of our fair province?

m AN INSANE SUGESTION
TIIKRE are 5000 miles of roads in I'matilla county and nec
essarily most of this mileajre is dirt road. It involves con
siderable expense to keep these roads in shape for travel.
There are always washouts hi remedy and there are bridges
and culverts needing attention. As a result the road fund is
usually broke and citizens seeking relief from had road Condi
tjOM find to their sorrow there is no money available for their
projects, Vet in spite of this, Mr. Hmkle wants to cut away
most of the general road fund for next year by lopping $62,000
from the road item in the budget. Ho the men who use the dirt
roads and who clamor for their improvement wish to see this
bit of "economy" carried out? Do those who demand market
roads want to see such roads go to pieces for lack of any funds
with which to maintain them? Do the people of this county
w ant to see roatl work closed dow n from one end of the county
to the other anil our road machinery scrapped? If so they can
get their wish by backing up the Hinkle suggestion tor budget
trimaniiiK- If the roatl budget is reduced as suvryrested the coun
ty will be in a sad plight fur the next year and that is stating the
case mildly.

fVhat Kind of a Day
Do You Wish Yourself?
.Suppose you could make
a wish at the breakfast table
and finally have the wish come
1 true. Would you say,
"I want this to be a good
day," or
1 "I'm willing for this day
to drag along?"
If you keep on wishing
your days with the food you
eat, finally the wish is likely
to come true.
Grape-Nuts helps your
wish for a good day. Nothing
miraculous; just the natural
result from right food with
the right taste.
There is a charm of flavor
and crispness in Grape-Nuts
that is like the smile of a good
friend at the breakfast table
And Grape-Nuts, with
cream or milk, is fully nour
ishingfeeding the tissues
and glands, the bone and
blood, with just those ele
ments which nature requires
building strength without
any "heaviness."
Grape-Nuts is the per
fected goodness of wheat and
malted barley, scientifically
developed ready to eat from
the package.
A Grape-Nuts breakfast
or lunch is a practical ish
for good luck.
