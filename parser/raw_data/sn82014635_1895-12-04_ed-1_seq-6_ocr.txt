Washington, Dec. 3. The Kansas del
rgation in congress is -determined to j
. ave nothing undone to release Jonn L.
Waller from his imprisonment in

France.
tr"Ce- Jtr ?rrr;:Cr;:: ,

uelegation of senators ana memoers, j
including Republicans and Populists,
held a meeting to decide upon their
course of action. It was resolved -to
push a resolution in both houses call
ing upon the president for all the papers
and'eorrespondence in the case. Several
members -thought this resolution should
be accompanied by one seating it to be
the view of congress -that the president
Ehould take immediate action and such
a resolution may be decided upon at a
futre meeting. From the jniormation
at hand the members took exception to j
Prirfpnt Cleveland's view that the cor- !
respondence wi'th France upon the mat- j to citizenship who has for the contin
ter is progressing satisfactorily. The , ued term of five years preceding his
only question raised was whether or i admission resided within the United
not the reply to the resolution calling states and who cannot speak, read and
for the papers should be awaited oe- ,
fore more vigorous steps snouia oe
taken.
Representative Miller, "Erom whose
district Waller was appointed to his
consulate,, was empowered to draw the
resolution and he had a conference re
garding it tonight with Mr. Hitt. the
probable chairman of the committee on
foreign (affairs. Representative Curtis
nf "Kansas has received many petitions
calling for strong action in the waller i
, T,-v,iM, h wi nwsent to the house.
Mr. Miller said 'that it was evident
from the president's message that the
state department preferred not to have
congress take cognizance of the Waller
case at all at this time, tout (that the
message would make no difference with
"the plans of the Kansas members.
There was no doubt, he said, in the
minds of Kansans, that Waller was un
justly Imprisoned and that his succes
sor. Wetter, had connived at his con
viction instead of helping to acquit him
of the charges against him.
SENATE GKIa. '1 O BUSINESS.

ber. At its conclusion Mr. Lodge of
Massachusetts offered a resolution, vig
orous in terms, Teanirnung the princi
ples of the Monroe doctrine and pre
senting them in such form as to permit

olutlon on the Monroe doctrine similar
o that presented by Mr. lodge. He
srave notice that he would call up the

the purpose of addressing the senate
thereon.
Among the large number of bills offer

those limiting the president's term to
six years without re-election; repealing

ALLEN'S KE-OI.UTION IN TtTLL.
ftecognitlon. Annexation, Monroe Doctrine
anil I'rotectlon to Americans Abroad.
Washington, Dec. 3. Following is the
full text of Senator Allan's resolution
on the recognition of Cuba and the
maintenance of the. Monroe doctrine.
Resolved, That is is the sense of the
senate.
1. That the government of the TJnl-
j leu ouiies 01 America, miouiu piumpu
recognize the revolutionists or uuoa,
-who are now honestly struggling to se
cure their independence of the Spanish
government, as composing an indepen-
dent nation possessing all the rights
thereof according to the laws of na
tions. 2. That all islands in close proximity
to the mainland of the United States of
America should as speedily as possible
by treaties or purchase, be annexed to
this government as essential to our
safety in times of war and the conve
nience and necessity of our commerce
in times of peace.
3. That the wise declaration of Pres
ident Monroe, known as the Monroe
doctrine, is a well established policy of
the government of the United States
and should be promptly and effectually
maintained -by the government in its
original purity and purpose.
4. That while the government of the
United States should not needlessly or
hastily embroil itself with any foreign
power and should only resort to ex
treme measures in cases of absolute
necessity, a firmer and more prompt
policy on the part of this government
in maintaining the rights of American
citizens abroad should be introduced
and pursued."
HODSE HEARS THE MESSAGE
Following: Which an Adjournment Is Taken
Till 1'ricUy.
Washington, Dec. 3. The session of
the house today was very brief and was
consumed entirely by the reading of the
president'es message. It was listened
to with fair attention, but the features
of the document received no sign either
of approval or disapproval from the
members until the conclusion of the
reading, when several Democrats creat
ed a slight demonstration. When it
was finished the house immediately ad
journed till Friday.
'OT A WORD Or THE DEFICIT.
Whleh Naturally Takes the House Some
i hat hj- Surprise.
Washington, Dec. 3. Both curiosity
and interest were manifested by the
members of the house in the president's
message. Members expressed surprise
that no recommendation was made for
the supply of the treasury deficit. In
the discussion of foreign affairs the
portion devoted to the enforcement of
the Monroe doctrine in connection with
the boundary line dispute, and the sug
gestions regarding Cuba attracted spec
ial attention, but the main interest cen
tered in the recommendations for the
retirement of the greenbacks and the
extension of the national bank system.
Several of the Democratic leaders who
differ with the president on the financial
question refused to express their opin
ions for publication.

representatives of the powers will hold
another -meeting to determine what
steps to take in view of the con'ttoued
refusal of ithe sultan to granlt the re
quest of the powers for extra guard

to form am estimate of the situation, as
to itihe condition of Asiatic Turkey.
Tthe -work of strengthening the forti

nlghit and -day. Soldiers are busily at
work throwing up fresh defenses and

London. Bng., Dec 3. The Daily
News correspondent at Constantinople
says: A letter from an European at
Marsovan says that on Saturday after
the massacre there was a ghastly spec
tacle at the edge of the Armenian ceme
tery. Corpses were brought by the
wagon load and tossed upon the ground
in heaps. Aside from the -drifting of
the bodies by the pepetrators of the
slaughter, a hyena-like horde of bar
barians pounced upon these heaps and
stripped the dishonored carcasses of
what poor clothing they had, leaving
them in all degrees of nudity. Finally,
about noon, a score of Armenians head
ed by a priest, -went under protection of
6old!ers to bury the corpses. Eighty
three of them were laid in a single
trench. Probably a hundred of them
were killed.
The Vienna correspondent of the
Daily News says a telegram to the Tur
kish embassy 'there last night (Tues
day), says that the sultan has resolved
to break all diplomatic relations if the
powers force the Dardanelles.
A dispatch from Rome to the Daily
News says.that there is great activity
in all the artillery arsenals to prepare

The" secretary suggested the Red Cross
society as an agency best adapted to j
the work of distribution. Mr. Bogigion
later called on Miss Barton, the presi
dent, and sorrte of the staff oificers of
tthe society, regarding the matter.
While theanswers to his questions wre

-undertake the work. It would do so.

New York, Dec 3. The World this
morning says the persistent efforts of
Proprietor Louis Klopsch of the Chris
tian Herald to send relief to starving
Armenians through Mr. W. W. Howard,
the newspaper correspondent, have
been fully checked. The Turkish min
ister at Washington sard very plainly
that Mr. Howard was objectionable to
'the sultan's government. The reasons
assigned -were Mr. Howard's dispatches
describing the atrocities in Armenia.
Considerable correspondence has been
exchange since on 'the matter of Mr.
Howard's proposed mission. Yester
day Mr. Klopsch received a letter from
the department of state at Washington
under date of Dec. 2, in which it said:
"I have to inform you that our minis
ter at Consta-ntinople has been advised
by the Turkish government that Mr.
W. W. Howard will not -be permitted to
proceed to Asiatic Turkey. The rea
sons given for this decision are Mr.
Howard's alleged hostility to the Tur
kish government and his attacks
against it and the Mohammed religion
in 'the newspapers of the United States.
"RICHARD OLNEY,
"Secretary of State."
Mr. Klopsch regards this decision as
final and he has cabled Mr. Howard
to return to this country.
