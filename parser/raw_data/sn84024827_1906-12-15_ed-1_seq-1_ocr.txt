OVER TO NEW COLE-RYAN COMPANY
'
BOSTON, Dec. 14. Papers were signed today
turning over Greene's properties to a new company
to be organized by Cole-Ryan. Greene goes in one
and a half for one, and Cananea for 1 2-3 for one,
and the company will have about ten million dollars
in its treasury.
(Special to Review.)
NEW YORK. Dec. 14. Negotiations
nere completed today (or the consoli
dation of the Greene Consolidated Cop
per Co. with the Caaanea. Central, a
property controlled by Thomas l
Cole and John D. Ryan, who, as a re
sult of the deal w ill become the dom
inating factors In the famous Greene
mine. Both properties are located In
Mexico. Nearly $00,000,000 of new
securities will be issued.
Although it is properly supposed
that as a result of the consolidation the
Greene Copper company will pass un
der the control of the Amalgamated
Copper interests, trade authorities who
are familiar with the operations' of
the Ryan-Colei syndicate say Messrs.
Ryan and Cole are now factors In the
mining industry as important as the
Amalgamated Copper Co. They main
tain close and harmonious relations
with th Standard Oil copper trust.

and went to bed tonight feoilnt; that
itcosevelt Is certainly bln.r given
as severe an initiation as was ever
devised for a candidate in i!iT f.irao.ia
Harvard organization. La.t night,
after he had recovered from the nard
stUnts'or the"d5y"before, he v.n "r
quested"to attend a little function In
the "Dickie" clubhouse on II la!fe

sing "Old Black Joe" backward to- the

Refreshments were served, during
which Teddy sat up on a ralsol dais
and consumed enormous amounts cf
Ice cream, plentifully seasoned wi'h
tomato catsup, with Jamaica ginger
added as an evidence of good taste.
The feast was topped off by a toast to
the president drunk by Teddy with
milk.
He hit the trail this morning at 4
o'clock In a driving snowstorm. He
was ordered to take an early car to a
suburb, where at a certain house ho
was directed to go to another suburb,
about ten mileH away. There at a

and a hatpin. With tbese in the do-

no more, no less. Having failed to
dispose of his pickle, he was then re

Square and kiss the picture of every

Is Given Short Rest.
By this time it was well along in
the afternoon and he was given the
rest of the day off. Tomorrow he will
continue his stunts, but, having been
