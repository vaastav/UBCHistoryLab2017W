BRUSSELS, Pee. 17. A content over the
succession to the throne of Belgium Is
possible. "The Vatican Is reported to have
confirmed the marriage a year ago of
Kin Leopold and Baroness Vaughan. Two
xons are said to have' been born from this
anion and both survive. The elder Is
Luclan, 5 years old. It Is reported that
lie will claim the throne. Prince Albert,
the heir presuptlve, is a nephew of Leo
pold II.
BILLETS.
PAP.IS, Dec. 17 neclsls from Brus
sels cay that Baroness Vaughan. reputed
to be the morganatic wife of King Leo
pold, has been expelled from Belgium. It
la also reported that Prince Albert and
the Princess Clementine were not present
when the king received the last sacra
ments on Wednesday because of their un
willingness to meet the baroness.
The JIatin today says:
Baroness aVughan was born Caroline
LaCroIx and was the daughter of the
house porter at the French legation In
Builapest. The man who was known aa
Baron Vaughan was in reality a French
sutofficer named Durleux.
"Leopold first met the woman at Os
tend. Following her acquaintance with
the king she was the mother of two chil
dren Luclen, the duke of Turvkeren, now
aged S years, who was born at Ville
franche, and Phllllppe. count of Raven
stcin, who was born at Balincourt three
years ago."
BRUSSELS, Dec. 17. Tolling bells and
booming cannon announced today the death
of Leopold IL king of ths Belgians. Half
masted flags of red, yellow and black fly
from the public buildings.
Crowds fill the streets and discuss the
king's death and whatever their opinions
of hia person! life join in tributes to his
grratnefes.
Leopold died as he lived, relentlessly re
puting his exiled daughters and clinging
tenaciously to his favorites, and at death's
brink, when, he insisted upon closing up
certain private business negotiations, he
was unable to escape the -influence of his
greaii-n passion, that for work and ma
terial gain.
Princess IOulfe of Belgian, the eldest of
the three daughters, arrived here today.
The second daughter, Uit unfortunate
Stephanie, was here when her father died,
but vi aa refustd trie permljion to see him
till after his death. When she was ad
mitted to the chamber she threw herself
brfii'e the body In a stale of uncontrolled
grief. Prince Albert, the new king, was
moved with pity, and, selling his cousin's
hand, knelt with her before the body, giv
ing mute expression to his sympathy for
and intended protection of the banished
daughter. The group of old servants, who
loved all three, wept at the sad picture.
Kins Leopold fought dea'.h as he had
fought the world, and strugKled to the end.
For two days he had survived an operation
that would have killed the average man of
his ace and only a moment before his sud
den death he had talked of revisiting sunny
southern France and of "the blue skies of
the Mediterranean."
The funeral will be held next Wednesday.
He had expressed a wish for the simplest
funeral rites, but it is understood that the
ceremonial obsequies at the burial of his
father. Leopold I, will be followed.

Tlie public was admitted to the mortuary
chamber at 4 o'cli-ck this afternoon. The
body lay in state for two hours before its

Thousands passed before the bier. The
newspaper correspondents also were ad

It Is said that a bailiff appeared today
at the residence of Baronesa Vaughan with
the ohlect of seisins' the premises on h- I
half of Louise. The Baroness successfully
prevented the formal service on her and
It is expected that the matter will be

upon hearing of the king's death today ex
pressed condolences to the royal family.

' The socialist organ, the Pelple, violently
attacks the memory of the king because
he repulsed his daughters and admitted bis

The paper discusses ths reported morga
natic marriage of the king and Baroness
Vauchan and ssks whether ths children of
this union will hold pretentions to ths

The point appears to be settled by the

The police are looking for Charles Jahn

ident. WASHINGTON. Dec 17. -The United
States ship Buffslo, now at Panama, with
700 marines on board, has been ordered to
sail at once for Corlnto. This action was
taken today as the result of a telegram te
celved from the United States consulate
at Managua, stating that Inasmuch as Ze
laya, tn his message resigning the presi
dency, had made unpleasant reference to
Americans, and owing to a report current
in that city that civilian adherents of Ze- j
laya had been armed with daggers, the j
citizens of the United States residing in
that city had appealed to the consulate for
protection. A tclegTam from the Ameri
can consulate at Managua states it is cur
rently rumored there that when Madris ar
rives tn Managua, presumably tomorrow,
Zelaya will formally surrender his office
to the national assembly, and that that
body has already received instructions from
Zelaya to cast its vote for Irias, as presi
dent of Nicaragua.
This rumor Is directly at variance with
the understanding here, based on dis
patches from Nicaragua, officially or
otherwise, to the effect that Madris would
receive the support not only of Zelaya him
self, but of his faction.
' Zelaya Will Dominate.
The conclusion of the United States of
ficers at Managua is that by the selection
of Irias, Zelaya will still dominate.
Zelaya's change of front Is a matter of
no surprise to the officials here. It being
known that both Irias and Madris have
long been regarded as Zelaya's willing
tools, and it has been suspected for some
time that Irias was really Zelaya's first
choice for the presidency and Madris sec

The hurry order sent to the Buffalo to
proceed at once to Corlnto may have some
significance other than that stated. Inas
much as ks arrival- there Is looked for -on
the day that Madrlz is expected to arrive
In Managua.
Rear Admiral Kimball, who went to
Panama on the Dixie, will accompany Hie

Zelaya Cable to Taft.
MANAGUA, Dec 17. President Zelsys
last night cabled a conciliatory message to
President Taft, ssylng that he had shown
his good faith by resigning in order that
Nicaragua might resume friendly relations
with the United States. He added that he
proposed to leave the country, but stood
ready to account for his acts as president
Zelaya's message to Mr. Taft follows:
"On December 4, I cabled to Washington
this message:
" 'Secretary Knox: I believe the Sources
of your information are prejudiced and
request that the United States send a
commission of Investigation. If Its find
ings show my administration to be det
rimental to Central America, I will resign.'
"I have received no reply. To avoid
harm to my country and desiring that it
shall renew friendly relations with the
United States, I have today sent my
resignation to congress. As my opponents
consider my presence a disturbing factor,
I propose to show my good faith by leav
ing Nicaragua. I stand ready to account
for mv acta."

STANDARD OIL ASKS APPEAL
Oil Company Alleges Sixty-Fiv
Errors on Part of Lower Court.
PAPEES FILED IN ST. L0UI
Order Granting the Appeal t
Supreme Court la Signed by'
Judges Hook and
Adams.
ST. LOUIS. Dec 17. The appeal of the
Standard Oil company of New Jersey, its
subsidiaries and the swn inui.iuua,:
against whom the government recently
woa Its diMOlution suit . In ..the Unite.
States circuit court, was filed here today.
61xty-flve instances in which the clrcuU
court Is alleged to have erred are cited ai
reasons for taking the case to the supreme
court of the United tSates.
The appeal was accompanied by a bond
of $50,000.
Collectively the assignments of error are
that the evidence did not show a violation
of the Sherman act, under which the suit
was brought. The decree is attacked as
against almost all the defendants, different
reasons being assigned as to why they
were not subject to the order of the court.
The findings in respect to competition as
between corporations occupying territory
are also declared to have been error as
well as the court's conclusions regarding
the part which John D. Rockefeller, Henry
H. Rogers, John D. Archbold and the other
individual defendants took in the forma
tion an dconduct of the various companies.
The order granting the appeal was signed
by Judges William C. Hook and Elmer B.
Adams.
Criticism of the decree begins in assign
ment No. 48. The court enjoined the New
Jersey company from voting the stock of
subsidiary concerns, the smaller companies
from pay.ng dividends to the larger, the in
dividual defendants from continuing the
combination which It found to exist or the
formation by them of any similar arrange
ment looking to the control of the price or
transportation of petroleum. All these or
ders are declared to be In error.
The find.ngs regarding monopoly of a
part of commerce are assailed in assign
ment No. 66.
Assignments Nos. 66 and 64 contend that
no decree should have been entered against
certain of the defendants which operated
in only one state, or the stock of which
was tpurchased for cash by the Standard
of New Jersey, or which was organized rt
the Instance of the trustees of the trust
of 1882, prior to 18H0.
Assignment No. 86 contends the costs of
the case should cot have been taxed
against the defendant
The assignment of errors was presented
to the court by Frank L. Crawford of New
York, counsel for the Standard Oil com
pany. Supreme Judge Found Dead. '

Smashed and Father Is
Struck.
John S. Paul has possession of his three ,
children. Incidentally to the transfer of ;
the children from Mrs. Paul to Mr. Paul j
there occurred more excitement than Flor-
ence has known tn a long time. Among
the episodes of the affair, according to re- j
ports, were the smashing of a window by J
Mrs. raui ana ner entry into raui s noune
thereby, and the clouting of Paul on the
head with a scantling by seme unidentified
person.
At noon yesterday Judge Troup In dis
trict court signed an order giving the
custody of the children to the bsnkr-r, who
recently won his divorce suit. Later In the
day, Paul, Dr. Adams, Laura Faublan. the
nurse, and Sheriff Brailey visited the resi
dence on State street, Florence, where Mrs.
Paul has been living with the children.
Mrs. Paul did not strenuously resist giv
ing up the children at first, though she
said to Sheriff Brailey, "No court on earth
has a right to rob a mother of her chil- i
dren."
Paul and the physician carried the chil
dren out to the carriage and drove off
to the new home which Paul has fitted up
several blocks away.
Mrs. Paul was there first, having run
across lots. Paul carried the children Into
the house and Mrs. Paul made no difficulty 1 Par' ot he day at the exposition and had

The sheriff started down the street. In
a minute more he saw Mrs. Paul running Tn school children of Omaha came flock
past him. She had changed her mind and l"K to tlle show eerly. Unexpected re-
left the carriage.
She ran to the side of the house. What
happened next is described by Sheriff Brai
ley as follows:
"I heard the crash of a window pane at
the side of the house and saw Mrs. Paul
crawling through the window. In a minute
more there were loud cries for help from
the Inside. Then the front door opened
and Paul and his wife came out, struggling.
I made them stop at once.
"I was trying to persuade Mrs. Paul,
who was hysterical, to leave the scene and
go to her home, when somebody unknown

piece of scantling. Paul suffered a
smashed hat and that was all. Then Mrs.
Paul agreed to go horns and did so."
Mrs. Paul Is under Injunction not to In

giving Paul the custody ot the three Uttfe

defendant filled to furnish the governor,
semi-annually, a copy, or substantially a
copy, of the account as required by the
chartfcr, but such pretended statements as
It has furnished have been dishonest and
fraudulent.
"The star scheme practiced by defendant
to rob the charter lines has been that of
constructive mileage. In plain English,
constructive mileage meins dishonest
mileage. It avails nothing to say that con
structive mileage has barn common among
railroads. So has rebating; so has stock
watering; so have many other schemes
which are going out of date.
Another point made by the counsel for
the state was that In the matter of bridge
earnings at Cairo and Dubuque, the state
Is entitled to at least 17,000,000 more than
It has received. The question of 'profit
