The President's Message is a business
document, and gives a resume of the operations
of the government during ihe last year,

ing several suggestions and recommendations,
to which we shall refer hereafter. We are
pleased to see that he favors amnesty, lie expresses
himself anxious i'oi ''civil reform," in
relation to appointments upou the recommendation's
of friends of the persons seekiug office
?defends the Ku-Klux law, and his action
under it?states that our foreign relations are
generally of a peaceful nature, &e., &c. The
JVIessage is before our readers. It should receive
a fair and candid consideration from the
people of the country.
The Commerce of Alexandria. -It has
been with the greatest pleasure, that during
the year now drawing to a close, we have frequency
noticed the improvements that have
taken place in Alexandria?improvements of a
character that show a steady and healthy
growth, and give promise of permanent prosperity.
During the past season upwards of
seventy-five new. and in many instances, elegant
brick dwellings and stores have been built, j
while an equal number of old ones have been i
repaired, remodled and modernized .and yet j
the demand for houses is such, that but very
few are unoccupied, and in most cases these remain
so on account of their unfavorable condition.
Upon an examination of the registers
of the hotels, it will be seen that the number
of strangers who visited the city, largely exceeds
that of the preceding years, tor four or live
back, while trade and commerce have, siuce I
rhe war, gradually revived and increased be
yond.what had been anticipated, and now. in j
many instances, are greater than prior to 1 So 1; j
when Alexandria received an impetus that bid i
fair to make her a thrifty and business city. I
In looking over the reports presented to the j
meeting of the Stockholders ol the Orange, j
Alexandria and Manassas Railroad Company, |
held here lasi week, it is very gratifying to note,
thai of all the freight passing over that line :
from the South, nearly three-fourths stopped j
here, while cities North received the remainder,
consisting principally, however, of cattle, tor a :
share of which trade Alexandria is in a quiet!
way-contending, and with, we arc pleased to ;
learufrom the stock brokers, a fair prospect of
success, (he number of cattle received and sold
here weekly, showing a steady increase, and attracting
the attention of buyers from other
places. Of all the freight going South over !
the same line a large part is from Alexandria, '
thus giving practical illustration of what has so
often-been repeated, that all things takeu into
consideration, this market presents inducement*
uot excelled by those held out by other cities, j
and incidents are not unfrequent, where mcrch- j
axits aod dealers liviug along the lines of communication
with Alexandria, after having gone
on to the North to purchase goods, have been
convinced that they could deal more advantageously
in a home city, and have returned here !
to buy better articles ut less cost.
With the construction of the Lyuchburg and I
Danville Railroad, a new avenue of trade will
be' opened, and n<s the management ot the
toad will be principally in the hands of those
who have, for years past, ably controlled
theO., A. & M. R. It., and who will, in all
probability, continue the best feeling towards
this city, granting her the facilities and ad
vantages, of which by her location, she is
possessed, a large portion of the products of
the rich country, thus to be brought into immediate
couuect ion, will doubtless centre here,
where a ready market will always be found,
while the citizens of that section of the State
will have the advantage of choosiug between
Alexandria and Richmond, two Virginia cities
* that ought to l?e fostered, and preferred, by
Virginia people.
It is gratifying, also, to note the proposed I
speedy resumption of work on the construction
of the Washington and Ohio Railroad -a road j
that has been of so much beneiit to Alexandria. |
and which i? destined, iu its onward Westward
progress, to be of incalculable advantage, making,
should it be completed to the coal iields.this

try, besides bringing here, as we hope, the iw
mense products of a rich, and what will then
soon be, a most productive region.
The trade of the Canal this season ha? been
good, notwithstanding the frequent interrup
'lions on account of breaks, &c\, and although
the mills at Georgetown consume the principal
part of the grain that comes down that channel,
y6t the shipping demand here is beginning
to attract the atteutiou of the farmers, aud
next season, with the large quantities of coal |
that will come dowu, may be expected tiour aud
grain. The return freight from here Is steadily |
increasing, aud the caual trade; exclusive of}
coal, is getting to be a considerable item.
The River trade - which in by gone days, was j
large aud remunerative, is slowly, but we hope j
surelyvreturning to its legitimate market,while j
the import aud export trade this season will
have been greater than tor auy year since ibe
war..
All these signs of prosperity are most cuvouraging
and should stimulate our people to
diligeutiy persevere iu the endeavor so successfully
begun, of making Alexandria, a rail
business place; aud to do this. more assuredly,
every inducement should be held out to attract
capital and manufacturers, the latter of
which-are so esseutial. and are always the
barbiugers of prosperity giving employment to
?o many, and more tban anything else, enliven I
icg and increasing, with honest ludustriou*
people, the population of u city j
A LEX A NDI
The following paragraph occurs in the President's
Message:?
"The condition of the Southern States is uti-<
happily not such as all true patriotic citizens j
would like to sec. Social ostracism for opin- j
ion's sake, personal violence or threats towards j
persons entertaining political views opposed ro j
those entertained by the majority of'the old cit- j
izens. prevent immigration and the flow of!
much needed capital into the States lately in re- \
bellion. It will be a happy conditiou of the !
country when the old citizens of these State:-!
will take an interest in public affairs, promul- i
gate ideas honestly entertained, vote for men ,
representing their views,and tolerate the. same '
freedom of expression and ballot in those entertaining
different political convictions."
The condition of the South is certainly not i
such as any trit* pahint would like to see, but i
it has been made as it is by the acts of the party j
of which the President is the leader,aud by the ;
passage of obnoxious and tyrauuical laws, up- j
plicable to one section and made to be felt in j
the South only. The "Loyal Leagues" carry
political ostracism to its utmost extent and the
old citire.-i' are in many instances debarred from
"taking an interest in public affairs' because
of the laws enacted to prevent them from doing
that very thing. Ivn Klux acts, the right,
in time of peace, to suspend the writ of habeas
corpus in Southern States and the enforcement
of those doubtful powers, for the sake ]
of carrying out party ends, are certainly not j
calculated to produce u conditiou of affairs that i
would commend themselves to any tearpatriot, j
As ro promoting an influx or immigration and
capital, no people on earth have, siuce the war.
done more or held out stronger inducements to
capital, und to immigrants to come among
them and help to build up their waste places,
than the people of the South ; but in their en
deavors they have been thwarted,more especially
in the States further South, by the bad legislation
of those who have obtained power and
control and who on account of the ostracism of
she old citizeu9 have acquired place and power
merely to abuse both.

John W. Green, L. W. Green, and W. W.
Webb, were the committee recently appointed
by the meeting of Land Owners uud Real Es- !
tate Agents held in Norfolk, charged with the
duty of inviting from different portions of Vir- I
ginia such citizens as they may know 10 be able I
and willing to contribute valuable counsel aud j
zeal in this enterprise, to attend a meeting in j
aid of Immigration, to be heldattheExehauge j
Hotel, in the city of Richmond, on Tuesday I
the 12th day of December next. at i o'clock p. j
in. These gentlemen are engaged in the per- !
forma nee of this duty.
The General Assembly of Virginia turds to- j
mot row. There will be doubtless a quorum
present in both brunches and an organization i
effected at otice. It is to be hoped that this |
will be a Luxiit.".*.; session and if the members ,
apply themselves diligently t<? the work before
them, and remain at their posts, it may be a |
short one. too. L*t "rings." lobbyists, uud all
outside influences, be ignored, and the interests j
of the State only looked after. We hope for the ;
be<t from this Legislature.

-In the hurry of getting out the j
President's Message, the priuters,iu Washington J
did uot take much paius, nor was there anv time j
toi proof reading; consequently mau\ errors
occurred, some of which are rather ludicrous ; i i
for instance when the President is made to j '
say. in reference to the Catucazy difficulty, that ; '
"the affairs of the Imperial Legation have pas- !
*ed into the hands of a gentleman entirely ul- .
jcctioiuilJe." instead of unobjectionable it will at j
iirst blush astonish Count Orloff. Many other 1
errors occur, hut they will bo readily detected ,
and corrected by the reader. j J

The "Piamonp Murderer.' A briet teie- e,
gram which appeared in the New Fork Star a ;3
day or two sines, relative to the release from ]u
prison oi' the once famous Tgnatz Ratzky, no
doubt recalled to the minds of many of our sc
readers the facts of the famous diamond mer- f0
chant murder sensation, which convulsed this 0
city in October ten years ago. v?
bigismund Fellner. a diamond merchant, was p(
found Head at Hoboken. with twenty-one stab? p|
near the heart. He had been but two weeks ^
in the country; he lodged in Brooklyn with ga
Iguatz Ratzky, a young foreigner and had in- j ef
tiiuate relation* with Aibertina Pllaum, Fast tr
Broadway, New Fork, in a house kept by a
Mrs. Marks. When last seeu alive Fellner left ql
this house iu company with Ratzky to go to by
their lodgings in Brooklyo_ This was on the jn
ISth of October, 1 Scl. Four day? after his pC
body was found. Suspicion at once was at- th
tached to Ratzky and the two women. Ratzky to
disappeared; the two women were arrested; a te
quantity of the diamonds belonging to the
murdered man were found iQ their possession. ati
and at night Aibertina committed suicide iu ou
her cell hv hanging herself. Mrs. Marks was qJ(
taken to New Jersey; she either wa* actually u0
crazy or assumed to be; was discharged for 0f
want ol evidence, and at last accounts was
keeping a house of prostitution in California. ;
Ratzky was traced to St. Louis, captured, i |(j,
brought to Freehold, imprisoned tor eight;
months, transferred to Brooklyn, where lie was j
tried April 20, 1S63, f'ouud guilty and sent ;
euccd to be hanged. The sentence, however, j u!.!
was commuted by Governor Kenton. i?ij July ! ?.

'ourier, the following:?
;iWc briefly mentioned last week that the
oters of the District of Columbia on the ifdrd

It is very true, as its enemies .say that tlio

1 the District of Columbia, but it has as good a
barter existence under the laws of Virginia as
ny incorporated institution in the District ot
,'oluuihiu lias under any charter granted to it
y its Territorial Legislature. To influence
ublic opinion agaiusi the subscription to the
\ & P. K. R., by the Territorial Legislature,
nd approved !ry the* people at the recent eleeion,
it is denounced as having barely a corporate
existence under an old charter granted
>y the Legislature of Virginia without h Jol
ir's subscription in stock or bonds negotiated,
r the right of way secured. The charter is
