aactive part taken by this paper in the
recent canvass for Police Commissioner.
Oar only explanation must be that, in
our view of journalistic dutv. whatever
concerns the public welfare should
concern us, whether it be in toli.
tics, morals, industrial economy or

A CELEBRATED RACEHORSE.
Purchase ef Felloweraft by m Km-
larky Tarfmn.
New York Herald, Dec 8.
Mr. Kichard Fenistan, of Kentucky, yes
terday purchased the celebrated racehorse
Felloweraft, by Australian, dam Aerolite,
four years old. It will be remembered
that Felloweraft made the fastest four mile
- time on record 7:19 at Saratoga last
summer, beating Wanderer and Katy Pease.
This grand horse will now be retired from
the turf and put to the stud. The price
paid by Mr. Fenistan for Felloweraft is a
secret between buyer and seller. Mr. Fen
istan has a large estate in Fayette county,
Ky., near Lexington, on whidi be has some
of the fastest young trotters in the world,
among others tr-e chestnut filly Lady
Stout, by Here's Membrino Patchen (own
lirother to the great Lady Thorn), by Mem
brino Chief, dam by Gano (son of Ameri
can Eclipse, he by Duroc, son of im
ported Diomed, dam Betsy Richards, son
of Sir Archy, by imported Diomed.) second
dam by a son of Sir William of Transport,
he by Sir Archy, out of Transport, by Vir-
ginius, son of imported Diomed, out of
hnea, ly Chatham. Lady Stout's dam,
Puss Frail, was by Mark Time, he by
Bethune, son of Sidi Hornet, by Virginian,
son of Sir Archy, by imported Diouied.
The filly Lady Stout," three years old last
spring, won the second, third and fourth
heats in the stake for colts and fillies of
that age at Lexington, in 2:30 J, 2:2".', 2:32 1.
Three days after this race the filly was
given a public trial in the presence of a
large assemblage on the same course at
Lexington, and she trotted in 2:30 J, 2:2S,
2:28, the fastest time ever made by a three-year-old.
This performance stamped Lady
Stout the fastest and best three-year-old in
the world. Mr. Penistan also owns Lady
Davis, a four-year-old, by Bourbon Chief,
that can trot a mile in 2:27.
FOUR LEVCED TEX Ji ESS EE GIRL.
Lynchburg (Va.) Republican.
We yesterday had a call from the little
four legged girl and her father, when we
had an opportunity of witnessing this won
derful freak. The little girf is in her
seventh year, and was born in Lincoln
county, Tennessee. Two of her legs are
of natural size for a child of her age, while
the extra appendages are some three or
four inches shorter, and are corresponding
ly smaller in size. One of her feet is
somewhat misshapen, the ankle apjearing
twisted, but with this exception, the four
legs are perfectly formed, and present a
lealthy appe arance. The little girl walks
with ease on her two natural legs, aud is
quite interesting in appearance and con
versation. Altogether she furnishes a
wonderful example of the freaks in which
Dame Nature is sometimes wont to in
dulge. C'oadenned Telegram.

Tbe Freed mea's Saving Bank Swin
dle.
Special to the Cincinnati Enquirer.
The lion. Washington C. Whitthome, of
lenessee, will introduce at the earliest
practicable opportunity a bill directing the
Commissioners m charge of the assets of
the Freedmen's Savings and Trust Compa
ny to institute suit against the Trustees of
said company, with a view of holding them
personally liable for the deposits. The
bill refers to the act of the 2d of March,
1SG5, incorporating the companv, and the
several powers and duties conferred upon
the Trustees; the efforts made by them suc
cessfully to obtain larger powers; how two
millions of dollars were collected from the
freedinen, and authority for new modes of
investment procured from Congress with
out consulting the depositors, and the
suffering occasioned among the fatter by
reason of the tailure to make dividends.
The bill then goes on to enact that tbe
Commissioners directed to wind up the
affairs of the bank shall make dividends as
often as they collect five per cent., and em
ploy counsel to bring suit on behalf of the
depositors against any of the trustees or
officers of the bank who may be found to
have violated their trusts, with a view to
holding them personally liable to the de
positors for the full amount of their de
posits. Among the trustees named are
Peter Cooper, . C. Bryant, A. A. Low,
and a number of the prominent Radicals of
the country. The bill will make a flutter
ing but the negro must not imagine that
these distinguished Republicans will agree
to let it pass Congress.
Ia tbe President a Falsifier?
Mr. Randall, of Pennsylvania, made a
very severe onslaught on the President's
message to-day, wherein it was attempted
to whitewash the late Board of Public
Works. The l"resident bad attempted to
convince Congress that Boss Shepherd and
his associates bad not incurred a debt ex
ceeding $10,000,000. Mr. Randall to-day
took up the figures furnished by the Board
of Audit, which demonstrate that the Dis
trict debt really exceeds $20,(00,000. '1 he
special champion of the President,
little Ilaie, of ilaiue, attempted to reply to
Mr. Randall, but it was au utter failure,
lor Randall asserted tliat he had official
figures for the statement made by him, and
he defiel anybody to demonstrate his inac-
curacv. Air. liale, having charge ot the
resolution which affords the opportunity for
Mr. Randalls attack, called the previous
question, and then cutoff all further debate.
Not being able to"answer the facts as pre
sented aiainst the President, therefore the
-ny way to stop unpleasant disclosures
was to choke Mr. Randall off. As was very
pertinently remarked, the time is coming
when the truth can t be suppressed-
Demanding Pay for tbe Slaves
Attorney General Williams has signally
failed to report the latest Southern outrage.
The case is that of a distinguislied Ala
bama Radical of African descent, who has
made a speech demanding that the United
States Government shall pay a reasonable
compensation for all the slaves which were
enfi anchised, one-half of the money to be
paid to the master or owner, and one half
to the negro. The idea is expected to take
among the colored Republican of the
Soutli, and the question arises, what will
their Northern allies do about it?
Tbe LNt Desperate Resort.
There are very decided indications, also,
that the Republican Congressmen here are
seriously alarmed at the prospect of a large
Southern Democratic vote for President m
1870, and are resolved to take as many
Southern States as possible by the throat,
and so reconstruct aud annul their State
Governments as to fix their vote two years
hence to an absolute certainty. Louisiana,
Arkansas, Alabama aud Mississippi are all
believed to be in danger from these des
perate conspirators. Tlieir object is to
carry the Presidential election, either by
fair means or foul, and to this end every
thing else will be subordinated.
Supervisor Cobb's Sneeettsor.
Special to the Cincinnati Gazette.
Col. P. B. Hunt, of Paris, Ky., was to
day appointed Supervisor of Internal Rev
enue for Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi,
aud Louisiana, vice Supervisor Cobb, re
moved for inefficiency! Col. Hunt is a
man of h:gh standing and ability, and his
appointment is, in all respects, a first-class
selection.
Probable Work of tbeKeralon.
Speci&l tothe St. Louis republican.
Indications still point to the proability
that this session will do little more than
pass the various appropriation bills. The
policy of letting all other matters alone is
very strongly adv ocated by many of both
parties.
Tom Kcott s Kauroaa interests.
The advance cohorts of Tom Scott's tri
partite alliance to help along the three
Pacific railroads, are already here in the
persons of well-known representatives of
the Northern aud Southern lines. There
is also a rumor current to the effect that
the alliance has been further strengthened
during the summer, by a treaty offensive
and defensive, made with the advocates of
the cotton tax refund job. The shortness
of the session, however, will militate very
strongly against Uie success of these under
takings. The chances for an appropriation to im
prove the mouth of the Mississippi are,
however, regarded as much more favor
able. KENTUCKY.

burg In'ltx denounced the charges of Mr.
Porter as infamous lies aud vile si tnders.
He now asked for au investigation by a

an issue of 3.C5 convertible bonds.
Mr. Willard, of Vermont, offered an
amendment providing that greenbacks shall
not be legal tender in payment of debts
contracted after the first of July, 1875.
Dawes Dogmatizes.
Mr. Dawes spoke at length in opposition
to the bill. He declared that with the gen
tleman from Oh'.o, (Garfield) he rejoiced
that the hands of Congress were being
stayed up in the effort, if it had the courage
to make it, to bring the country back to tbe
laws of trade, and argued that tlie direct
aud inevitable consequence of the substi
tution of the pending bill for the existing
state of affairs, instead of bringing relief
by appreciation or greenbacks to goIO,
would sink it ten and fifteen per cent., and
thereby take from the lalorer fifteen per
cent, of the purchasing power of his day's
wages, aud cut dowu his now scanty loaf
of bread.
The greenback would be worth as much
as gold to-day, if the Government would
pay it when presented, and it never would
be worth as much as gold until tlie Gov
ernment did tliat. Let it do tliat, and all
the rest would follow. In conclusion lie
said: Those who are responsible for pub
lic affairs have no time to lose. We can
put off our duty in promises no longer.

to save or to destrov its existence. No
other power than itself can accomplish its
ruin. It will pass out of mind and memo
ry in the politics of this country, if at all,
by its own hands. It has the power as
well as tin; privilegeof accomplishing either
of these results. Whatever in the near fu
ture awaits that party let it not be for want
of courage.
Pbeip.
Mr. riielps argued against the pending
measure and siid: This is what I ask the
government to do: I ask the government
to pay the promises that it uiade twelve
years ago, to pay these greenbacks on de
mand, dollar for dollar, and I ask the gov
ernment to do so by borrowing on its bonds
payable fifty years after date, the money
with which to pay its present indebtedness.
In my opinion, there is but one way to
make the currency equal to money, aud
that is to follow that straight, narrow path,
which is the path of honesty. Tlie gov
ernment must pay its debts when they are
due. Then alone can we expect to be
again a ptosperous and happy and honored
nation.
Smith.
Mr. Smith, of New York, spoke in favor
of a return to specie payments as soon as
practicable without disaster. There were
some featuies in the pending measure
which impressed him favorably, but there
were very grave object ions to it . There
was illimitable expansion in it, because
these bonds of small denomination would
circulate as currency. In order to guard
against that, he would move to amend the
bill by making the lowest denomination
of the bonds $1,000.
At the close of Mr. Smith's remarks the
committee rose without action on the bill.
On motion of Mr. Tyner, the Senate
amendment to the bill appropriating $30,
00.) for scales required in carrying out the
law for the pre-payment of newspapers was
concurred in and the bill passed.
Mr. Ga field made an effort to have an

Governor Responsible for the Blood
shed. In an interview of the Yiclcsburg Herald
reporter to-day, with Andrew Owens, the

groes, which advanced on Grove street, who
is a prisoner, Owens reiterated that Sheriff
Crosby ordered him to come to the city
with all the armed men he could get, and
tliat Crosby gave Ames as his authority for
calling out the negroes. Crosby savs
Ames and Attorney General Harris ad
vised htm to call a posse to reinstate him
self in office; but be did not do it, and dis
claims any responsibility for the columns
which marched on Vicksburg.

Jacksojt, Dec 10. Tlie proclamation

than wliom no man has done more to create
this trouble, declares that the race conflict
is now on us, aud the negro women are
ready to commence with ax and knife to
slaughter the white women and children.
One remarkable fact is that only the coun
try neeroes have been drawn into the con
flict. The town negroes are too smart to
be duped by their leaders. The actual
number of negroes killed in Monday s fight
was probably i50. Forty-eight were buried
in one field yesterday.

Crosbv, the colored sheriff and leader of
the negroes, is still held, but the other
prisoners are released on promise of good
behavior. No violence is offered.
Republican Views.
The Times, (Rep.), says: "The at'ack on
the city was- as impracticable as it was
atrocious, and the leaders ought to be
punished." It says Crosby is as big a fool
as the other negroes, and intimates that
white men were at the bottom of it.

court, in case a bill of particulars is grant
ed, to insert a clause to the following effect:
But this order is not to be so construed
or applied as to prohibit the plaintiff from
introducing evidence which may be ad-
missable under the general rule of evi

TRAKSITOBY.
I low the Astronomers Inter
viewed Our Neighbor
Venus.
A Peep at Her Cusps How She Be
haved In Company with tbe God or
Day.
Lo3fD05,Dec -10. The following dis
patch has been received from IW. David
son, Chief Astronomer of the American
exedition to Nagaski, Japan:
During our observation of the transit of
Venus to-day, the weather was unusually
cloudy and unpromising. The time at
which it was calculated the transit would
begin, passed away without our being ena
bled to record the exact moment of the
first contact with trustworthy result. After,
about a quarter of an hour before Venus
reached the stage of her second contact,
the observer at the equatorial caught a
glimpse of the sun and planet. He was quite
successful in taking several measurements
of the planet's cusps during the interval be
tween tbe first and second contact. Sliort
ly after the second contract, -further meas
urement of the distance between Venus
and the sun's western edge were made with
tlie microscope. In all there were taken
1j0 micrometic measurements or the line
between the rasp. Besides these, thirty
one micrometric observations were made of
the passage of both edges of the sun across
the meridian of the stations, and similar
views of the right and left rims of Venus in
crossing the same line. Eighteen micro
metic surveys were made of the
respective declinations of the sun
and planet by observing both
the upper and lower limbs while pass
ing the meridian. About sixty excellent
photograplis of the transit, during the va
rioiis periods of its recurrence, were taken.
Extreme good fortune attended astronomy,
for, just as Venus departed from the sun,
the clouds began to gather and threatened
rain towards tbe close. We were enabled
to telegraph the difference of longitude to
Vladevostek, so that tbe location of the po
sition here is definitely determined.
Prof. Uarkness, of the Lnited States
Naval Observatory, sends the following re
garding the observations of the transit of
emu at
Uobartown, Tasmania.
lthough the weather was bad, our ob
servation! at the time of the transit were
partially successful. We succeeded in
taking 113 photographs of Venus during
her passage over the disc of the sun.

St. Loi is, Dec 10. W. W. Drummond,
who claims to be a brother of Judge Drum
mond, of Chicago, and says he was form
erly Judge of the United States District
Court, of Oregon, was arrested here to-day
on the charge of perjury, and in default of
$1,.)00 bond was committed to jail. In
October last he was accepted on the bond
of John McCarty, arrested for passing coun

false, aud lie was indicted.
HIRACI.ES ASCIEXr ASD HODERX.
Have miracles occurred in our dav?
u I he thing is not possible,' say some; "the
age of miracles is past. But this begs the
question. What right have we to affirm
tliat the age of miracles is past:' Give ns
sufficient evidence of a modern miracle
and we must admit it.
This is tbe true attitude in the case. If
one affirms, let him give the proof; if one
denies, let him do it on the ground that no
sufficient proof has been adduced. Prof.
Seelye puts it right in the following state
ment, orig'nally published in the Cvngre
gationalist. It will be seen that the atti
tude demanded applies to the alleged mira
cles of all times:
"The only proper attitude towards this
question, and the only true scientific
method, is to inquire whether such occur
rences have actually taken place an in
quiry whose answer is only to be gained
through a careful sifting or the evidence
which declares them. If we find wonders
reported, which turn out to be no miracles,
but only delusions of witchcraft and magic
these no more militate against the reality of
miracles than does an abundance of coun
terfeits against the reality of genuine coin.
If we find some miracles reported for
which the evidence fails, this no more
precludes our finding others of undoubted
venty than do raise statements in other
matters prevent us from learning anything
true. Let the quality of the reported mir
acle and its evidence be sifted to its ut
most, and, while we reject nothing from
preconceived skepticism, let nothing be
taken incredulous superstition. Let the
eye be open and clear, and the heart re
ceptive and resionsive only to lie truth,
and if miracles are proved by sufficient tes
timony to have taken p'ace, the wise man
will accept them, and follow their conclu
sions, whatever these may be."
THE TOtiHT EXTKADITiOX CASE.
Carl Voght was valet to the Chevalier
Du Bois De Biano, a wealthy and venera
ble gentleman residing in Brussels, two
years ago. The old man was murdered,
the premises robbed and fired, and Voght
lied to America. 1 he tnierence that lie was
guilty of the triple crime was irresistible,
but thouch arrested in ew I otk he could
not be returned to Belgium because of
the absence of an extradition treaty with
the United States. While held in the
Tombs, Voght was visited periodically by
a woman who had followed him from over
tbe sea, and who was supposed not only to
have a full knowledge of her companion's
felonies but also to be tbe custodian of his
plundered Iwnds. Discharged from the
lombs, V oght was thrown into the Lud
low street jail on the suit of a nephew
of the murdered man, who sought
by an action in tort, to recover
the value of the bords. When the case
came up for a hearing last week it was
postponed because of ti e failure to arrive
of evidence expected from Belgium. The
nephew, however, offered to discontinue
tlie suit, and compound with Voght, if he
would transfer all the securities in his pos
session, and agree not to prosecute for false
imprisonment. Evidently the nephew was
more intent on securing his uncle's inheri
tance than upon revenging "his foul and
most unnatural murder."

Gen. Banks Says It Is the Koot
of All Southern Evils.
History or All the Reconstruction
Measures The Whole Difficulty on
Aeeonnt of Federal Officials They
Should be Prevented from Touching
Local Affairs.
Bob ton (Dec s) Special to the Chicago Tribune.
The Hon. N. P. Banks spoke to a laree
audience on "The Future and the Recon
struction of the South" this evening in
Tremont Temple. He was received with
considerable app'ause, and began by saying
that he was to sptak in order to fill the en
gagement he had made with the manager
of the course, and because he thought it
his duty to express his opinions in resard
to the condition of the Southern portion of
ine country and the possible means for the
reorganization of its industry and its po
litical society. He desired to divest the
subject of all political considerations, for it
was a question, not for a party, but for the
country. The financial and all the busi
ness embarrassments under which we at
the North were pressed was due to the con
dition of affairs in the South, for it was
impossible that a coition of the country
should be in anarchy, and it 12,000,000 of
people suffering an invas on of their social
and political rights, and the other portions
be unaffected. He then began with the
history of
TH ATTEMPT AT BECOXSTKUCTIOS,
beginning first with President Lincoln's
movement in Florida, while the war was in
progress. Then be spoke of the second at
tempt, the first having failed, to secure the
allegiance of the States on tbe borders of
the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. This was
a wise plan, for in these States was the
strength and power of the whole country,
and what authority held them, held the
destinies of the Government. He gave sta
tistics showing that the fourteen States in
the Mississippi and Ohio valleys furnished
more farm and live-stock products than
ALL THE OTBEB 8TATE3
combined. But Congress was at no time
leady to act upon any measure for recon
struction. Its delay he characterized as
fatal, for no one could doubt that if these
Valley States had been received one by one
into the Union, the entire reorganization
and reconstruction of the Soutli would
speedily have followed. Then came Mr.
Lincoln's death, and with it the whole
train of evil and disaster which had befallen
the South and the whole country. The
matter of reconstruction was thrown upon
Congress, but that body, unwilling to adopt
any policy, the question went over till the
close of the war, and it was not till 1800
that it bezaa to
TAKE DEFINITE MIAPE.
Then the Senators from Tennessee were
admitted to the councils of the nation. In
1SC3, Arkansas, North and South Carolina.
Louisiana. Georgia and Alabama followed.
and in 1;70, Mississippi and Texas. So
that, practically, all the Rebel States came
into the I mon at the same time. After
pausing to express his gratitude to God
that they did not accept the fourteenth
amendment, and all come in in 1:06, in
which event the South would have ob
tained possession of the Governmeut, lie
spoke minutely of the action of Congress
in regard to
XE6EO SUFFRAGE.
Universal suffrage having been adopted,
an immediate and important change was
produced at the South. The negroes were
son leagued together, and the white race,
their former masters, was soon arrayed
acainst them. Therefore, it was thought
wise to send among them, as instructors
and peacemakers, officers of the Freed
man's Bureau and other Government offi
cials, and hence the carpet-bag governments.
It was suspected that these carpet-baggers
were running the Government for their
own personal gain, and, in fact, there were
grounds for this suspicion, from tbe fact
that the rate of taxation was increased
from :W cents to 100 on $100. The value
of property was reduced from $3,300,000,000
to $140,0u0.0uo; tbe area of improved lands
was reduced from 3S.000.0tx acres to
31.000,000, and their value from $1,200,
000,000 to $.14o,000,tCN; and that the State
debts has increased to
AS ENORMOrS AMOUST.
Could such a condition of things con
tinue long? No. There must inevitably,
unless some remedy was applied, be repu
diation in some form or other, and he
called attention to the ruinous effect such
action would have upon tbe whole country.
He spoke favorably of that portion of the
President's message referring to recon
struction, but said that the time must come
when it would be fjreed upon tbe people
and tlie lresident that the whole
DIFFICULTIES AT THE SOUTH
were on account of the United States of
ficials holding office there; and it might
come to pass that by a special vote of Con
gress these men would be prohibited from
taking any art in local politics. Ap
plause. He believed in the capability of
the negro race, and thought that, as always
since the birth of the Savior,
REGENERATION MUST COME
from the lower classes of tlie people. He
spoke eloquently of tbe action of Kobert D.
LUiott in leaving his seat in Congress that
he might go back to take office in his own
Stare, there to educate and lift up his peo
ple to a sense of their political duties.
Why then could not the South, under the
leadership of such men as he and others,
be left to itself.' Certainly mafers could
be no worse tlian tliey were now. There
could le
NO MORE BLOODSHED,
anarchy, and strife, and he prophesied that
all differences would be righted speedily,
for there were no enmities so great between
man that could not be softened in politics.
No Southerner had so great a hatred toward
the negro that he would not ask of him and
accept his vote. Mr. Banks illustrated his
position by supposing that the whites were
in power. There would be a minority
among the ruling race which would be out
of office. This part would
OO TO THE SEGROEs
ai:d say, "Come, and we will oust these
men."' Tlie negroes would inquire, 4Will
you allow us to go to tbe same hotel with
you; to ride in the same car or steamboat
with you, to go to the opera, the theatre,
or the ball with you?"1 If they were
answered "No," then they would say, "We
will not vote for you." But they would
receive no such answer. They would, in
fact, hold
THE BALANCE OF POWER,
and could secure for themselves whatever
was right. On the same principle there
would be no ruling of the uegro over the
white race. The people were able to
govern themselves, and tbey should be al
lowed to do it. In closing, he spoke f r
the rights of the minority. Though he
would not argue that the Southerners
could claim any rights they constituted
A MIGHTY POWER
The General Government might crush
them out, but we wanted no more war, no
more force, no more bloodshed. We should
strive to find those grounds of amity on
which harmony between all lections and
all classes can be secured.
LOX6FFXLOW AD HIS VISITORS
A letter to the JVc 1'orfc World says:
We last saw Longfellow at the funeral of
Asassiz. The old college chapel was filled
with the perfume of flowers, and through
the aroma the delicious music of Cher
ubim's requiem was solemnly f.dling. He
looked wrinkled and old, his hair was thin
and silt ery, and he seemed to feel that
around the generation of men he repre
sented the shadows of the eventide were
falling. He has three daughters, who
usually remain with him iu Cambridge,
though somewhat fond of society and
travel.
His residence is much visited, so much
so, in fact, that horse cars usually stop be
fore the house, and the conductors shout,
"Longfellow'sT
Curiosity-seekers sometimes venture
within the inviting precincts of the poet's
esta'e. A party some time ago fiiade such
a venture and were hospitably receiyed by
the poet, who astonished them wilt the

were about leaving, one of them asked:

This is dow sold along the streets, and the

ladies using this fern were compelled to

came a nuisance rather than a pleasure.
It can no be purchased already pressed,
thus saving a great amount of trouble.
When pressed it lasts a long time, and is
very pretty. It grws exclusively in Ilart
ford, and can there be found in the woods.
Tbe people used to tear it up by the roots
and sell the plants to outsiders, but it is a
hard thing to cultivate, and that trade ha
been discontinued. The quantities that
were taken would soon have desL'oyed it
entirely, but a law was passed prohibiting
people from picking it except at a curtai'i
