THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
•h'i (President Roosevelt has seat
iast message to congress, it is along
document, and characteristic of the
(president. In many particulars It is
not eo earnest or vehement as some
of the messages previously dispatched
to congress .fry the president. At the
same time it deals with matters that
toave tang 'been dear to the presi­
dent's heart, the proper regulation of
great corporations, the amendment of
trust laws that evils may be less­
ened and legitimate business not
harmed, the passage of _lawB that
shall improve the standard and -condi­
tion of labor, amd the helping along
of the "moral uplift" .with which the
president has been so vigorously and
earnestly concerned.
There is no question but the presi­
dent has made a lasting impression
upon the life of the nation, both as a
statesman and a moralist He has
pointed out .the evils that have arisen
through the race tor great wealth,
and through taking advantage of
loogfaoles in the laws of the nation.
He has put under the ban customs
that grew up with the great business
of. tbe country. Me has striven to en­
act legislation for the benefit of all
the people, Irrespective of wealth or
class, and to remove special privilege
ttnd advantage. .He has been gener­
ously praised and roundly criticized.
And yet the people have indorsed the
^•Roosevelt policies" as they (have
come to be known, and have elected'a
president pledged to carry on and put
Into practical execution the standards
set by Presfdenit Roosevelt.

The present session of congress
will ibe what is knwwn as the'short
session, amd It to mot likely that many
of the major reforms sought by .the
president will be carried to comple­
tion before the time tor adjournment
to Mareh-Hhegreater ipart of the
worfc will remain to be done when
•President Tteuft is 'Inaugurated and
fcaills congress fa special session. The
recommendations of President Roose­
velt, however, will not be unheeded,

BLEACHED FLOUR.
As we understand the decision of
the secretary of agriculture in the
bleaahgd flour case, the bleaiching pro­
cess Is held 'to be harmful and is tor-,
bidden by the secretary, and after six
months from the time of the decision
flour that is bleached' will not be per­
mitted as a pant of interstate com­
merce, thus preventing its shipment
from one state to antoher. This is a
highly Important decision, perhaps
the most important that has been ren­
dered under the pure food law. Com­
missioner Ladd of this state has been
especially active in opposing the
bleaching process, and* the sale of
flour that is bleached. Bleaching at
the present time is practiced by the
great majority of the mills. The flour
is passed through anelectrical flash,
which whitens It and "ages" it. The
millers have claimed' that the flour
thus bleached was not harmful and
that the nitrites present, due to the
bleaching process, were not sufficient
to do harm. It has also been claimed
that the trade demanded the peculiar
whiteness .that comes from the
bleaching.
The declsictti'of' the secretary of ag­
riculture, if it proves to be final, will
prevent the employment of the
bleaching process altogether. This de­
cision, of course, covers only inter­
state commerce, 'but will probably be
supplemented with a decision in this
state preventing the 'sale of the
bleached flour. The whole decision
will mean a readjustment of the flour
trade and the abandonment of the
electrical /bleaching process which is
in general use.
The same old story comes from
Minneapolis—the benevolent old North
Dakota stockman who started' out tor
Heidelberg, or some other German
city, to see the folks across the water
end isihow them a few thousand of the
dollars taken out of the soil and grass
of North Dakota—-the "friend" who
ran alcross the benevolent traveler In
the- wicked city and interested him
so. much that they became quite
chummy—then the express package
'Consigned to the "friend", that was in
the express office awaiting the pay­
ment of charge®, which were reported
by the second friend --with the cap
and the words "express agent" on the
peak of it—4he wallet (brought out by
the stockman who offered to lend the
first friend the jieiceasary $100 until a
check was cashed—the grip contain­
ing several thousand dollars in money
and securities temporarily held while
the stockman, found his wallet—the
substitution of the dummy grip, and
the disappearance of the swindlers.
The benevolent stockman says he lost
$7,000 aside from £he hundred he
loaned the "Mend." The -police say,
the benevolent stockman lost only
$105. At any rate, it proves that

If the train that -was wrecked
Wednesday ndght at McKenzie had
not been of the latest, best and most
enduring construction, If it had been
lighted with old fashioned oil lamps,
if the icoaches had been heated with
stoves as in former days, telescoped
coaches and fire might and would in
all probability have added their hor­
rors -to what was a bad. enough situa­
tion, but might have been a great
deal wors£. That the number of in­
juries was not greater and that some
deaths were not recorded is remark­
able, bat doubtless due to the splendid
construction of the train, and the use
cf electric lights and steam heat, two
very frequent and serious sources of
danger being removed. That heavy
coaches, traveling at the rate of forty
or fifty miles an hour, can be plunged
down a steep embankment and over­
turned without doing greater Injury
to passengers than was done is a pret­
ty good testimony of the enduring
construction of .modem passenger:
coaches.. It has long been agreed
that travel inside a Pullman coach Is
the best kind of accident insurance,
from the manner In. which these
coaches are built, and their usual dis­
tance from the engine, in case of
a collision. But other passenger
coaches are^ being better constructed
these days, ajtdday coaches and .tour­
ist cans are reinforced' and durably
cosSsfcructed and will stand much wear
and tear. Tina desire for the cheapest
possible transportation, te natural/but
on such occasions as that of the re­
cent wreck, a superior kind of car
equipment is much more important to
the passengers to be riding than the
price of their ticket, a lighter train
of cheaper construction and without
modern conveniences fax the" ^ay of
heat and light might have be&nthe
center of a tragedy deplorable indeed

common idea qf the umbrella
man found in rainy weather stationed

It is to supposed that if his duty
seemed divided between a customer
leaving the store for'her carriage and
one leaving it/at the same time for a
trolley car his umbrella would be held
over the carriage rider, but whenever
oppoitunity offers he affords the wom­
