Mr Ilandall raised tho point of order against
Mr Haskells resolution and demanded that tho
Territorial delegates be sworn In
The Speaker sustained tbo point of order and
all the delegates except that from Utah qualified
Tho Speaker then said There Is re controversy
on tho matter or tho Dolegalo rrom Utah There
aro acYcral certificates or ot least two held by two
dlOercut gentlemen and It is a matter as the Chair
understands it that cannot bo determined in ad

Mr Mctane contended that the Chair having
stated that all the ccrtlficAicst were to bu read
could net wlthdrrw that ruling
Mr Cox argued In support or bis point of order
contending that under sections 31 and 38 Itcviscd

Charles 11 Farwcll a member or Congress from

and then Inquired whether In witness opinion
thoso dissouslons did not threaten

To this question Mr Davldgo objectod and the
Court held that tlie question w as too leading
Tho Prisoner It Is a rather abrupt way of put

wltli prlllmlnary questions lhat was tho trouble
you bod with Mr Davis You ought to ask prelim
inary question a and not get up to tho point at
once
Mr Porter said that tho prosecution had allowed
tho defenso to go Into this question of tho politi
cal situation but they unit not forget that this
was a court uf Justice and a prisoner Is on trial for
crime
Tho rrlsoncr Thats tbo very point I want lo
discuss thla morning
Mr Fo rtcrIfthc ltcpubllcan party was In a stslo

MrKcovlllc ir tho gentleman had mado that

trio tlmo ho talks about I understand now that
tho prosecution admits that the dliRrcnccsiu tho
Kcpuhllcan party
DID SOT THREATEN ITS EX1STPNCE
orlntegrtty Hthot is admitted that is all I ask
Mr Porter I have made an admission lu terms
Intelligible to every gentleman Iu the court room
I do not propose to adopt tlie terms my friend pro
poses Tho ltcpubllcan parly was not In danger
of disruption It waa not needful forthe purpuo
of tuning tho American ltcpubllc that Its Presi

facts however wo by no menus ndmlt that tbcro
wcro not those so vile and revolutionary lu spirit
and so desirous of notoriety that they entertained
a different view not from Insanity but depravity
and dealra of self advancement

Tlio Irosldont of Iho Sennto luldrossod
that botly yesterday ns follows
A solemn event vt hlch excited tho sympathy of
tho civilized world recently brought about nu un
expected chango lu tho Presidency Tho lirty
sovenlh Congreia now meets under tho constitu
tional successor to tho President who was only In
augurated last March and who was stricken down
lit tho maturity of his manhood after but four
short months of experience in the Hvccutlvu
chair Theso stern fuels nro full or admonition
They tench us how frail aro human hope nnd
how transitory Is human power In presenile of
this sad Instruction nmbltlon may well pause
and all or us mny learn how vain aro Iho aspira
tions In which too much of nut lives is devoted
Great as was tho bereavement which spread stir
row over Iho land and which touched the heart
of every fireside It was sanctified by tho consola
tion that Iho people of all sections were brought
nearer together by n common grief and Ihiiscnnia
to understand each other better through kindred
emotions Asperities that hod long estranged
litem were solluutsl nnd the violence or faction
was chastened by allllcllon
AiTiioinit riinsmrvT Annum nrrnnsrvrs
tlio parly Hint elected General Garfield his per
sonal posltlnri is necessarily dellcata and trying
He Is entitled by his whole bearing through n
critical ordeal lo gene mm coinitonanco As n
Senator I proposo lo extend to his Administra
tion candid treatment sustaining It when right
nnd opposing It vvhon wrong on nil public ques
tions Holding lo tills purpose ami Intending to
Insist on a purr nn economical nnd n Just
administration or tho Hxccutlve trust tlio
new President ought to bo ntded by
nil proper legislative co opcrallon In carrying
out he general policy ho may prowso to Iho coun
try Whatever that policy In Iho future may bo
It la entitled to Inlr trial and to patient hearing
With this view or my duly 1 ahull veto wlllliuly
to conliiiuo tho committees In this body as they
nro now commuted It Is best that the party
which has tho President nnd tho Uouso or Iteprc
scntnllvcs should bu held atiswcrnbln for nil
measures Then Ihcro will bo undivided rtspuii
Blbillly
if TiiRorrostTiosj are wise
they vtlllnccopt this conclusion At tho special
scssloh in March lliey mailo tnil it brief and feeble
stand iigalusl lllo organlzutlim or tha committees
which ahaputhu great kglilallon or Iho country
Indeed they nlmost conceded lhntlmiortiinlpolnt
to their ailv crsarlcs Hut In Iho protracted con
test for tho ollcts of tlio Senate under the santo
political conditions my DcmucrntlO friends
ylulded llo ground from tho beginning
to tiiu cuu or n iioiiuucss nicy nan satis
factory reasons for tills courso of policy
IOSI spring I took occislim to snttothoriit uus
why my veto should bo given for thu then exist
tug Organization of the Senate Although tho
circumstances hut o materially changed since Hint
itltno Iho obligation which I voluntarily assumed
lias qot been ultcrod Hence I adhere tu that
declaration nl ways reserving to myself Iho right
or rejecting ollcnsiv o candidates
IAiKIIIEATLY EVC0URAII1D
In this decision by the course uf my distinguished
ilrlcnd from Vermont eminent res n lender ol his
nartv as bu la also eminent for liubllu nud for
Ivalo worth Upon Ills motion tho present Chief
Clerk distinctly appointed as n Democrat was
unanimously made acting frecrebiry That grace
ful deed Is a cheering sign which utlnnls mo
nlrniunsm atmlatid liubllchr because tills Is thu
first plncu where nu example should bu set against
tho common ccntinbllng for oflico that ills
I figures our political life Tho country was
almost equally divided between tho two great
parties attbo lrcsuieiiliai election i no majority
In thu Houso or Itcprcseutatlves is small nud lu
llilsCltamliertlloltcjaibllcaiis ami Democrats con
front unch other wltli ilka numbers Tha cum
millets aro now held by ono patty nud tho office
of the Senato nro held by Iho other parly from
my standpoint It would bu tinwlio tu disturb this
condition or things and I do not proposo to en
gage in any struggle that looks to that object
AS OURiFOMTItS ARE OROANirrD
a public man who steps outildo tho parly lines is
always exposed to harsh criticism no manor how
roper his motives may be Tho machinery or
C olh enforces rigid ilttclpliuo and denounces re
volt ns treason Vur thu fast ten years mypoltllenl
position has been entirely ludepcudcul of any
organization I havo accepted tho good wherover
It was found and 1 havo voted for thu host men
whether they woru called Republicans or Demo

COSSISTESCY IS SOT A VIRTUE
If It means dogmatic adhesion ton given Idea
when change would bo meritorious 1 ho greatest
statesmen of modern times havo been courageously
luconsislcnt and havo become public lienetftctors
by abandoning mlstulcn policy If conviction

tho Senato to con re r upon mo thu highest distinc
tion lu their gift Prized ns tliat honor is nnd
ought lobe It is doubly valuable In my estima
tion because It came wholly unsought nud with
out tho exchange of it single word directly or In
