Cold weather and snow have coino to
Northern Arizona for tho winter
AmzoNA hna two excellent Spanish
newspapers in El Frontcrizo and El
Hijo del Frontcrio
CmtisTMAs notions litter the stores
Tho ono day in tho year when infancy
reigns supreme is near at haud
Now that the Central Pacific will
soon become unreliable on account of
snow a largo addition is to bo expected
to tho travel on tho Southern Pacific
Faiimeks aro now busy planting what
will probably bo tho largest acreage of
grain over put in in the Salt River Val
loy Tho good prices of tho present sea
son havo served to somewhat encourage
agriculturists
As lono as tho cottonwood continues
to bo as luxuriant in this valley as it is
no fear need bo entertained as to a
scarcity of firewood Truo the fuel is
not as hard and lasting as mosquito but
it is available and cheap
General Mile is occasionally men
tioned as seeking tho Republican Presi
dential nomination but there can bo no
doubt that tho unanimous voice of the
West will bo heard in tho National Con
vention uplifted for that great patriot
and statesman James G Blnino
The rainy season is hero Arizona
has been struck by tho edgo of what
tho weather bureau ia pleased to term a
cyclonic disturbance Tho rain is wel
come Nearly all tho barley and fall
grain is planted and up and theso
showers will almost ensuro a bountiful
harvest
The two kinds of time kept in Phcunix
ia simply maddening Tho usual pro
cedure after tho inspection of a clock is
to ask its owner Is that railroad or
local time One of tho two times mus
bo unanimously adopted or tho insane
asylum will havo a plethora of patients
from Maricopa County
Necessity for irrigation in this valley
ia growing less and less aa tho yeara ad
vance One farmer living six miles
south of Tempo reaped 1400 pounds of
wheat per aero last summer from a field
of wheat that had been given but one
Irrigation and that irrigation was prior
to plowing Another not far distant
obtainsd 1200 pounds per acre from a
piece of spring wheat that waa irrigated
only once and that very poorly in April
Foil tho first timo in tho history of
Arizona tho peoplo of this Territory
had tho Presidents message laid before
them in full tho next morning after it
was read in Congress They can thank
Tnn Republican for this privilege for
it waa only through its push and enter
prise that such a thing waa possible
Heretofore they had to wait forty eight
to seventy two hours for tho San Fran
cisco papers to get hero to get tho full
news of tho world
It is wonderful how politics aro
allowed by somo mon to warp their
every thought President Harrisons
message was n calm matter of fact
digest of tho reports from different
departments of tho public service to
which wero added brief comments con
taining tho Presidents viewa in each
matter discussed Yet in their hasto to
belittle a man who lias done much to
advanco tho Nations interosta and who
haa given to tho country an administra
tion without a blot tho Democratic
organs aro vying with each other in
flinging at him tho atinkpota of abuse
The Prescott Courier editor is road
boiling mad and no wonder Ho had
the contract for county printing and
tho recent grand jury when it submitted
its report touched the county printing
question in tho following language
Wo find that the official printer of tho county
has been allowed and paid f 75 for extra print
ing 150 of this amount was for printing the
lection proclamation and 25 tor publishing In
the Prescott Courier a lettee replying to an ar
ticle by Sheriff ONeill allecting county Inter
ests Both of theso Items appear to be fully cov
ered by the contract of the county with said
printer and have therefore been Illegally paid
and allow cd The election proclamation Is re
quired by law and therefore comes under the
provisions of the the contract by a direct specifi
cation Tho other item should have been
paid for by the Atlantic- Paclfio Rail
road Company or its attorneys rather
than by this county This committee holds
that under no coloring ot tho law can these
charges be legalised they have been psJd in
excess of the contract covering such printing
and are Illegal We therefore recommend that
tho District Attomeybedlroctedtolustltutesult
against the Board and the contractor for the
recovery to the county of the sums thus Illegally
and without Just claim paid to tho said con
tractor We further find that the Hoard hud al
lowed the official printer of the county fi2 for
printing a brief In the appealed tbeotseof
ONeill vs Yavapai county Under a strict in
terpretation ot tho contract this is also an
Illegal charge and appears to have been al
lowed without reference to tho contract or tho
interests of the county This is also a natter
to which we believe tho attention ot the Dis
trict Attorney should be dlrectedand we recom
mend that it bo done

THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN PHOENIX FRIDAY MORNING DECEMBER 5 1890
It ia delicious to read of the indigna
tion of tho Democratic and especially
tho Mugwump press towards Senator
Quay Senator Quay is a sharp man
he believes in running a campaign to
win Ho believes in exactly such
methods as does Governor Hill of Now
York Senator Gorman of Maryland
Calvin U Urico ol Now York and
Ohio and they all obtained their ideas
from that glorified Democrat Samuel J
Tilden In tho late Presidential cam
paign tho then President of tho United
States sent 10000 to Cnlvin 15 Brieo
knowing that the money would bo used
for the election of a gentleman who be
lieves entirely in Mr Quays methods
of conducting a campaign Now wo
havo no excuses to make for Senator
Quay but wo respectfully submit that
when men denounce Mr Quay and hii
methods and at tho samo timo have
none but soft words for Mr Gorman
Mr Urico and Governor Hill and who
hold the memory of Mr Tilden aa soino
thing sacred in tho history of their
country thoy aro running tho risk of
having somo envious person declaring a
full belief in their cntiro inconsistency
About half of tho Democratic press of
this country has been charging for two
years past that tho electoral vote of New
York was traded away by Governor
Hill through an arrangement between
tho Governor and Mr Quay but these
papers that aro denouncing Mr Quay
for a rogue aro half expecting to support
Mr Hill for tho Presidency for 1892
which ia another proof that sometimes
consistency loses all her jowolry
Only for tho fact that tho character of
tho pcoplo in chargo ia ao well known
tho attacks upon tho courtB by tho
Democratic organ of thin city would bo
worthy tho notice of the court in citing
them to appear for contempt It re
minds one most forcibly of the old ndage
that no thief oer felt tho halter draw
with good opinion of tho law IUnakes
a great difference with the sheet which
is like master liko man in this case
only to bo seen to bo despised which
side of tho question is represented
Yestorday morning it said of the present
grand jury wmcii is composed ex
clusively of Democrats and Mormons
We never knew that Jurors were questioned or
objected to on the grounds of their politics the
Idea Is as absurd as it Is debating
in ttie same issue in following up a
base and cowardly attack begun some
timo ago upon tho Circuit Judges of tho
Territory it said
If one sixteenth of the laws that are now
being prepared against the Ariiona Judiciary
are passed few more political decisions will be
Indulged In in this Terrltorj
The Republican at this time will not
comment upon theso Attacks upon tho
courts but simply give these examples
to show tho atato of mind of tho pcoplo
making them If thoy only owned the
whole court so that their stealings
would not daro be questioned how
aupremely lovely everything would be
