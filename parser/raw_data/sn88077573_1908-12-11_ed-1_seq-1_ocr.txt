RESULTS IN FUGUE
Firm in Detroit Responsible for Spread of Foot and Mouth
Disease ot Cattle Animals Innoculated to Try Cure

Plttsbuitj, Deo. 11 Tho federal
government's' offer to trace tho or
igin of the present epidemic of npli
thoim fever (foot and mouth dis
ease, has been rewarded with suc
cess. The desired Information was Im
parted yesterday to secretary of ag
grlculturo James Wilson and the
search that has been In progress fo
tho past five or six weeks will be
discontinued. The cxlstance of th.
disease In the United States at pre
Kent Is owing to tho desire ot a
Detroit drug firm to manufacture a
supply ot tho scrum which Is used
In flghtln? aphthous fever and to
the Inectlng of a large number of
wittle used In the experiment.
The disease, uncommon In tha
United States. Is often met with In
Germany, nnd ithero n regular sys
etm of combating It has been de
vised. An antitoxin Is used, which
Is Ud to be very successful. The
Detroit drug firm has ben carry
ing a smnll supply of this nntltoxln,
but, owing to It being so exponslve.
thero was not much of It used. A
couple of months ago the firm con
ceived tho Idea of manufacturing
Its own antitoxin, and to that de
