THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Dissatisfied with the failure of the Associated Press to send the usual
abstract of the President's message to the papers here, this journal wired to
the western office of the A. P. yesterday, asking it to repair the omission at the
Advertiser's expense. The result is the profoundly interesting cablegram on
the first page.
Comment upon the sensational Japanese passages o
elsewhere.
By the Hawaiian paragraph, our readers will see that the President is still
determined to build up a middle-class American citizenship here and that,
until the planters shall consent to do their part in that work, the solution of
the industrial and commercial problems of the Territory may receive scant
aid from Washington.
The other recommendations which vitally affect Hawaii are those which
propose free trade or a reduced tariff for the Philippines, a subsidy for Amer-
o-n t;na pirizpnshin for Porto Ricans and legislation against child
The latter proposal, if enacted, might especially affect the earning power
our Portuguese families.
IS IT MORE SCANDAL ?
Does the Board of Supervisors extvect to fool all of the people all of the
time?
rserore election tne Hoard raised tne ponce appropriation to .ih.UU( per
month, ostensibly to provide more police, actually to provide Brown with
more politicians in t lie guise of police. Supervisor Lucas, after this had been
done, publicly accounted for the appropriation in that way.
After election it was urged in the Board to lower the appropriation to the
old figures, and the Supervisors, instead of doing so, as economy and common-
sense dictated, reterreu the question to a dilatory committee. That committee.
week after week, asks for "more time" and the money keeps flowing into
Brown's hands.
e put two questions: Has the delay been caused by a desire to give the
Sheriff enough of the people's money to pay the expenses of the recount1.'

ears, noses nor memories?
labor.
of
THE CRISIS WITH JAPAN.
The message of the President on the Japanese question would be extra
ordinary if it were not for the as yet unpublished facts about the crisis.
Mr. Roosevelt has gone to the length of stigmatizing California civilization;
of threatening to use the civil or military power to enforce the treaty with
Japan a statement which hints at martial law and the possible suspension
of the writ of habeas corpus; has asked for laws to enable the President to
supersede State authorities in all matters which trench upon international
affairs and has even gone so far as to suggest the naturalization of Japanese. It
is no light and trivial affair of diplomacy which has led the President to
make such far-reaching declarations.
For lack of knowledge Congress has treated the President's message with
no great respect and the Coast press with less; but the Senate has asked for
the diplomatic correspondence with Japan and if that body gets it all, we
shall expect to see a spirit of sobriety fall upon both law-makers and journalists.
Wie shall have no more indiscretions of the Raynor type; at least, so it is
to be hoped. In writing of this matter the other day, the Advertiser gave aa
inkling of the private news it had as to the real gravity of the Japanese-
American situation. It could tell more; but what it has known ' for some I
time may today become public property if the President responds fully to the
Senate's request. Then our own public will see how essential it is that the j
naseinn of .Japanese subiects should stop and realize the entire wisdom of ,
the President 's otherwise inexplicable course.
The Advertiser would be glad to receive from the exhibitors at the
jhotographic display, copies of pictures of scenes in and about Honolulu for
use in its February special number. It is desired to have new pictures for
that edition. Photographs sent in for the purpose, marked with the owner's
name, will be credited in their published form and the original print returned-
The Advertiser desires the co-operation of amateur as well as professional
photographers in the pictorial featuring of its great number.

The outcome we hope for, in the trouble with Japan, is not only a peaceable
understanding with that country but a constitution1 amendment by which the
States shall bind themselves to the principle, which is essential to the power
cf the government, that all laws and ordinances, in derogation of the treaty
rights of aliens, shall, by that fact, be held invalid. Otherwise it will be
within the power of any state, territory or town, to precipitate, interfere with
or control the gravest Questions of public nolicv. and even to eomnel war.

It is a vital prerogative of a nation acting as such through its central govern
ment. The excuse hitherto given by the United States that it can not compel
States to observe treaty rights, has never been accepted by Europe and this
country has been obliged to vevade the issue and satisfy foreign claimants in
some roundabout way. Thus, when Italian subjects were murdered in New
Orleans by a mob which mistook them for members of a murder cabal called
the Mafia, the Washington government, unable to do anything with New
Orleans or Louisiana, paid an indemnity to the families of the dead out of its
contingent fund and expressed its regret at the occurrence. Something of the
sort was done to satisfy China in the matter of the slaughtered Chinese in
Wyoming. Had the contingent fund been unable to meet the demand upon
it, the Government would have had to wait for the assembly or the action
of Congress, a delay which a strong and aggressive complainant might not,
in such a crisis, be willing to share. And if Italy, in the Mafia case, had
demanded the arrest and punishment of the murderers and if Louisiana had
professed her inability to find or to convict them, what could the United
States have done to meet its treaty obligations to Italy?
The attitude of Great Britain, in the famous McLeod case, reported in
this paper yesterday, was this: "That if the United States disclaimed re
sponsibility for an offense against a Briton on the ground that it was solely pun
ishable by the laws of New York, Great Britain would then proceed to exact
reparation from New York." War was averted by the prompt acquittal of
the political prisoner, the forcible detention of whom brought on the diplomatic,
crisis referred to but the central question of national responsibility for State
violation of treaty rights remained unsettled and has returned to plague us.
It is sadly plaguing us now and if Japan should conclude to accept the British
precedent and act upon it, California would be plagued exceedingly. A glance
at the small roster of American ships in the Pacific now will show how little
defensive aid could be supplied, for at least six or seven weeks, by the national
authority.
UNFAIR ELECTION LAW.
In the matter of inspecting ballots cast at an election there is no reason
why the common sense rule in other matters should not be used.
For instance when a will is offered for probate or to be construed, it is
an axiom of law, and the court invariably heeds it, to carry out the intention
of the testator as far as is discernible from the instrument. No will is to be
thrown out in its entirety merely because a clause or some clauses are so
drawn as to prevent the discernment of the intention of the testator.
Where a ballot in all parts, but one, declares the intent of the voter it
should be counted for such offices as from it the intent of the voter can be
diseerned.
The argument against such a course, viz: that the voting for too many
names is of itself a distinctive mark, is too far-fetched to be agreeable to the
majority of our citizens.
That such and such a course of denning or identifying one's ballot might
be decided on by some low coteries, and eventually there might be occasion
for a recount and exposure of the ballots in court is carrying conjecture
beyond the realm of probability.
It is the belief of many who are versed in the common law that our
election law is in part unconstitutional, in that by its provisions, which are
too remote for probability, it deprives the citizen of his right to choose his
representative or executive officers.
For example. Sec. 94 recites that "if more names are voted for on a
allot than there are offices to be filled, then such ballot and all it contains must
be rejected. ' '
On an appeal to the. Supreme Court it is believed by many that this part
of the election law would be held to be unconstitutional.

THE RELEASE GRAFT.
The exposure of Birbe has drives him in haste from town or into hiding;
and the coincidental exposure of (he police ought to drive them to an explana
tion to the grand jury.
Birbe secured the release, without bail, of a man who had been arrested
for drunkenness, taking $5 for his services, which might otherwise, on the
con K'lion or tne man in district court, nave gone to the county of Oahu
a fine.
According to his own story. Birbe telephoned Yida and Vida ordered the
prisoner's release.
Birbe then went on the cocktail route spending some of the money in
McTifjhe's saloon perhaps no more than his share. If any was saved oat,
who got it?
Daring the late campaign the Advertiser pointed out the amazing dis
crepancy between the arrests made by the police and the court arraignments.
From October 4 to October 9 there were twenty-seven arrests for drunkenness.
Of these nine resulted in arraignments: the rest, eighteen, or sixtv-six per eenl
of them, are unaccounted for on the books. They were quietly let out and
the County lost from $3 to .$5 apiece in fines. The question is. in view of the

at the base. The sides were fringed

Much of the evening's festivities were
