IREAL ESTATE IS
Past Week Has Been Dull, hut
This Is Not in Least
Surprising.
OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE ' :
EXCEPTIONALLY UK WWT
City Stands Second in Matter of
Building Record During
Year.
Hfjjorts from real cstato doalors all
over the city indicate considerable con
fidence in local conditions, although
there has not been a great deal of busi
ness during Iho past week. This is as
might bo expected at this timo of the
year, it is said, when Christmas is at
tracting so much attention. Tho recent
"fctorm, also, has served to place a damp
or on tho trade, and, except for the clos
ing of a number of deals which have
been pending for some time, business
has been quiet.
The number of inquiries has been
large, howover, according to the state
ments of large local dealers, and there
has been a disposition on the part of
local investors to place their money in
good security in this city. Apparently
the good things of Salt Lake City have
begun to count, for the real estalo in
vestors hero as well as those from out
of the state.
I a prominent reai estate aeaier toia
Saturday of a man who had sold out
his business hero because ho was dis
satisfied ' with conditions, although ho
appeared to be doing fairly well. After
an absence of more than a year, during
which time he visited man- of the cities
of the Northwest and Pacific coast, ho
returned with the doclaartion that Salt
Lake City was good enough for him,
and has opened up a new business here.
Four Largo Deals.
Another large dealer told of the
the four largo deals ho had consum
mated during the past throo months, and
reported that although there is seldom
much real estate business late in Do
member, this year appears to be an ex
ception and the activity ut this time
is rather astonishing.
The feature of the week' is the clos
ing of two largo deals by the Ilalloran
.Tudge compauy, amounting to $37,000
and $35,000 respectively. These trans
actions indicalu that investors aro sc
ouring all the property they can before
the coming of spring, when it is ex
pected tho activity in real cstato will
bo even greater than it has been for the
past year, Tho purchase of tho prop
erty by P. J. Moran in the southwestern
section of the city shows also tho ten
dency of the largo contractors to spread
out in their business and secure good
locations. ....
There, is. not a ny great surplus of
good" houses for rout at tho present
time, and although there is a slight ten
dency "for rents to decrease, the drop
has been confined up to tho present
time to the most undesirable properties.
Besides this, rents in many cases have
boeu rather high on account of tho
congestion here, and the presout in
crease in tho number of new residences,
and especLallv the erection of commo
dious apartment houses, has provided
110 1 only for tho coming of the normal
increase hi population from the outside,
but for a spreading out on the part of
the old residents as. well.
Salt Lake iln In Front.
Comment has been made on the pub
lished reports of the American Con
tractor, including satistics from fifty
tif the largest cities of this countrv,
during the past eleven months, and
which show that only nine of these
made gains in tho number of building
permits during the past month. Salt
Lake City is second, with 0 per cent,
folowing Denver, with -19 per cent, only
O per cent iu advance of this city. Tho
nearest competitor to Salt Lake City is
Pnterson, N. J with 32 per cent, and
2Tew Orleans is fourth in the list with
22 per cent.
The recent report of the building in
spector here, showing the total amount
of building permits for the past week
SS4.400 and the total for tho month, with
ten da3's yet to run, .4f0,000. in com
parison with $112,000 for the entire
month last year, shows that this citv
may even head tho list next month, and
will stand well up towards the top of
the list for amount of building during
The entire year.

SENATE AJOEX HELD
TO ENDANGER LIFE
WASHINGTON. Dec. 1L. Tho fact
that a. large number of -senators havo
been occupying quarters for tho past
several years that were perilous to life,
in a building that should havo been con
demned, was emphasized today by tho
refusal of Elliott Woods, superiutend--int
ol' the capitol, to permit anv in
crease of the weight, upon tho floors
through tho admission of documents
needed bv the national monetary com
mittee. The building where this condi
tion exists is known as tho Senate an
nox, situated one square from tho capi
tol building. The finance committee
of the Senate has occupiod quarters
there for several years, for tho force cm
pl03ed iu gathering data for tariff and
currency exchange.
In addition, three Democratic soua
torfl and a half-dozen Republican sena
tors havo their office rooms in tho
building, but within tho next few
months thej will move to tho handsome
niarblo structure which is just being
completed for use as Seuato offices.
The finance committee desired to
carry into the building a large number
of documents and volumes on tho sub
ject of finance, but Senator Aldrich
was told that the floors of tho auuox
would not carry an extra pound with
safotj. This brought out tho fact that
several senators have been compelled to
keep their law libraries at thoir homes,
because of the overloading of tho floors
of tho annex. All of tho senators and
committees of the Senato annex will be
transferred, to tho new building.
CENSUS EMPLOYEES
NOT COMPETITIVE
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19. Tho ap
pointment of clerks and other employees
needed for work on the thirteenth na
tional census will be by congressional
patronage, as in the case of the talcing
of previous censuses.
Senator Long, chairman of tho com
mittee on census, today reported to tho
Senate tho JIouso bill providing for
non-competitive examinations, to be
held throughout the country by means
of the civil service machinery, but based
on the form of examination to bo pros
cribed by Director North, of tho census,
and confined to persons designated bj
senators aud representatives.
Members of the civil scrvico commis
sion contended for tho uso of their
classified lists, but tho Senato commit
tee on tho census, in its report, fol
lowed the lines laid down in the bill
passed by the house. Thoro are about
3000 places to be filled, and tho bill will
prescribe that preference shall bo given
to persons who participated in provioiu
censuses. Tho positions will coutinus
about three years.
It is expected that the bill will be
taken up immediately after tho holiday
recess. The Senate committee adopted
a new section providing for the purchase
of the property now used as quarters at
the census bureau, and of an abandoned
school building adjoining, at a limit of
cost of 543,000. Provision is also made
for tho construction of new buildings
not to exceed $250,000 in cost.
