WEDNESDAY EVENING, DEC. »
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
PRESIDENT WILSON'S message,
read in Congress yesterday, is re
markable In only one respect—
that its dominant note is negative
instead of positive. The really Import
ant part of It lies in what the Presi
dent proposes not to do, rather than
In any of the several recommenda
tions he makes. No legislation regu
lating business is to be enacted. The
President desires so keenly to make
this point emphatic that he establish
ed a precedent by deviating from the
written text of his prepared speech to
force it upon the attention of his
hearers.
The President says the Democratic
"program of legislation with regard to
the regulation of business is now vir
tually complete." This is a sharp
right-about-face. When Congress ad
journed it was generally understood
that the administration had at least
one railroad regulating measure and
Bcveral other bills relating to business
still to be acted upon. This was, how
ever, before the November elections.
The entire text of the President's mes
sage indicates that he has seen the
handwriting on the wall. Despite the
Democratic claims of endorsement at
the polls President Wilson shows by
the tone of his message that he is
willing to forego many of his pet theo
ries in the hope of regaining the confi
dence of the public, which he appar
ently feels that he has lost. This is the
keynote of the whole beautifully writ
ten, artfully phrased document.
There is little else worthy, of note.
As was to be expected, he endorses his
own water power control and general
conservation measures and repeats
that our duty to the Filipinos lies In
early and complete Independence for
the Islands. The President would
turn the Filipinos loose to shift for
themselves as an example of our un
selfishness, regardless of the fact that
it would be far easier for us to do
just that than to retain our present
position as guide and mentor to a peo
ple not yet fully prepared for self
government. The most selfish course
we could pursue would be to do as
President Wilson advises.
As for a government-owned mer
chant marine, to be operated at a
loss, such as the President recom
mends, how does this differ in essen
tials from government subsidy, and
how much less permanently beneficial
would it be? What we need is a law
as liberal as those under which the
shipping of England and Germany
eails. That alone will bring many
boats under our flag. Nothing else will
be worth serious consideration.
The message is a model of simple,
forceful English, but It contains noth
ing of particular importance that he
has not said before, and it does not
measure up to the stirring period in
which It was written, nor docs it sound
the keynote of public sentiment and
public aspiration. It contains little
that is new and much that may sound
well aa the President says it, but that
would not work out in practice as he
anticipates.
"MADE IN AMERICA"
THE "Made-in-Amerlca" campaign
is on in earnest, if the pages of
the ourrent magazines are to
serve as a basis for judgment
Scores of manufacturers of standard
poods—those backed by national ad
vertising campaigns—bear the label.
Its use bids fair to spread.
The Philadelphia Evening Telegraph
sees a danger in this that is more than
Imaginary. It points out the peril of
placing the "Made in America" card
on articles of inferior quality, es
pecially at a time when wo are bidding
for foreign business, and when we de
sire to make a particularly favorable
impression on the export trade.
Unless there is some limitation on
the use of the label it will come to
mean as little as the "Made in Ger
many" sign does now. Goods of a very
Inferior nature are being sold to-day
bearing the mark of the Fatherland.
It has ceased to be a badge of merit
and is now merely a tribute to the
untiring energy and vematility of the
German manufacturer, which is a re*
suit scarcely to be desired In our own
case.
ANOTHER ZEPPELIN SCARE
EVER since war was declared there
has been uneasiness in London
over the possible Invasion of a
German fleet of Zeppelins. Just
now the people are in the grip of an
other "scare." It is declared that the
Kaiiar is preparing to send his air
WEDNESDAY EVENING,
craft over London to drop bombs on
the city and timid residents are lying
awake nights a-tremble at the least
sound.
It is altogether within the range of
possibility that German aggressiveness
may prompt the dispatch of a number
of Zeppelins across the channel, but
such a trip would be exceptionally
hazardous and void of results, so far
as the outcome of the war is con
cerned. As Lord Kitchener said In a
recent interview, dropping bombs on a
defenseless city is not war and can
have no effect on the ultimate result
of the conflict. Such a raid as is pro
posed would be costly in the extreme
and would net the Germans absolutely
nothing, while in all likelihood Eng
land would profit by a rush of new
enlistments.
It is hardly likely that, with an army
in the east and another in the west
facing an enemy that on both sides
has demonstrated that it can fight, the
Kaiser is thinking seriously of an
aerial raid on London. He has more
serious things to think about, no mat
ter how much his love for the daring
and spectacular might prompt him to
give the signal for flight to his airmen.
DR. BRUMBAUGH'S SPEECH
HE speech of Governor-elect
T Martin G. Brumbaugh at the
dinner given in his honor in
Washington Monday night is
just such an address as those who
know him best expected htm to make.
In some quarters there is some pre
tense of surprise at the vigor with
which the Governor-elect declared
himself for the enactment Into law of
all his pre-election pledges, and of his
expressed purpose to "go It alone" If
those to whom he looks to carry out
the party promises perchance should
fall to measure up to what he believes
their full duty.
There is nothing new in this atti
tude of Dr. Brumbaugh. From the
time he entered the race for the Gov
ernorship he has been absolutely true
to his own convictions. Even in the
heat of as trying a campaign as was
ever waged In Pennsylvania he never
for a moment swerved. He stated his
platform in clear and unmistakable
terms; he repeated it hundreds of
times over the State in his speech
making, and those who have followed
his career in public life knew that
what he favored as a candidate he
would endeavor to the full extent of
his ability to carry out In office.
There is nothing whatever of the
"woolly lamb" about Dr. Brumbaugh.
He is as fine a type of upstanding
manhood as Pennsylvania has ever
produced, and those who hailed him
at the Washington function the other
night as "presidential material" spoke
with inoro than the laudatory good
fellowship that often accompanies
postprandial oratory.
OPENING THE EXCHANGES
MUCH interest surrounds the
opening of the stock exchanges
of the country on Saturday.
This Interest largely hangs on
whether or not there will be such a
rush of foreign owned securities to
market as was anticipated when at the
outbreak of the war the exchanges
were closed. There is no fear of a
panic. That possibility is eliminated
by the fact that the committees in
charge will permit no sales below a
safe minimum to be announced pre
vious to the opening.
In other words, holders of securities
must keep them unless they can find
buyers willing to pay not less than the
bottom price fixed by those in au
thority, and this figure will, in all like
lihood. be what the stock in question
brought on the day the New York ex
change ceased to do business.
The resumption of stock and bond
dealing ought to have a wide and very
beneficial effect on business in gen
eral. Stagnation naturally follows such
a condition as has prevailed during the
period since the war began. Oppor
tunity to buy and sell, to turn securi
ties into ready money or to borrow or
lend on them will doubtless stimulate
business to a degree that will permit
of industrial activities and improve
ments that have been held up by lack
of funds.
The country can get along without
the stock exchanges; that has been
demonstrated. The exchanges can be
operated without danger of panic due
to the hammering down of prices;
that, too, has been demonstrated. So,
with its possibilities for good unim
paired and its chances for evil greatly
reduced, there is no apparent reason
why Wall Street should not be per
mitted to resume after its long vaca
tion.
WINTER WORK FOR LABORERS
THE announcement that contract
has been let and work is to be
started at once on the grading
of the ground in the lower end
of the city for the new Pennsylvania
Railroad freight station Is good news.
This improvement will give employ
ment to scores of men who otherwise
would be idle.
The examplo of the Pennsylvania
company in this respect should be fol
lowed by other corporations and by
the city government wherever possi
ble. This will be a hard winter at
best. Mills are closed entirely or
working with reduced forces and on
short time. Conditions are better than
they were, perhaps, but not so much
so that there will not be suffering and
hardship among the many who are
out of work and will be for an in
definite period. Any work that must
be done and can be done now as well
as next Spring or summef should be
done.
There is a selfish side to this aa well
an a philanthropic, if that phase must
be considered. Labor is plentiful now
and cheap. Next summer may find
the reverse true. NOW is the time;
benefit yourself and your less fortu
nate fellow at the same time.
AN EVENING THOUGHT
If ye abide in me, and my
words abide in you, ask whatso
ever ye will, and It shall be done
unto you —John 16:7.
EVENING CHAT ]
The Telegraph Employes' Association,
which has Just entered upon Its sev
enth year, is said by one of the most
prominent bankers of the city to have
been the first of the Christmas savings
clubs, so to speak, and to have been
in the van of the practice which has
turned so many thousands of dollars
loose for the holiday trade and to help
make many homes happy. For years
there have been beneficial organ
izations in this city which have de
clared dividends, but the Telegraph
association is said by this well-Informed
financial man to have been the first to
arrange for a general distribution of
funds Just before Christmas. Just what
these organizations have done for Har
risburg and Steelton people is too well
known to discuss. They have put
money for Christmas In the hands of
people whose savings had never before
reached anything like what they are
now able to command and many sav
ings funds have been formed along the
same lines. The Telegraph association
was formed along the lines of some in
Philadelphia newspaper establishments
and has been watched with interest by
men connected with newspapers in
other places.
People all over the hard coal regions,
in fact in every county in the anthra
cite field, will he watching the hearing
in the Dauphin County Court to-mor
row when the anthracite coal tax will
be taken up. This action will test the
constitutionality of the tax quite as
well as the action In equity which was
started earlier In the year and which
Is now in the hands of the court to
determine. What interests the people
In the hard coal region Is that half of
the tax goes back to the county where
the coal Is mined. This means that
every township in Schuylkill county, as
well as every one In Dauphin, will get
a share of the tax for local expenses.
The chances are that there will be
closer attention given to this hearing
than any that has been held for a
long time.
It is gratifying to note that Harris
burg's new Public Library is keeping
right up to date. Not only does it
provide over 100 periodicals of vari
ous kinds for free reading by the hun
dreds of people who frequent the
building, but it also maintains its col
lection of books right up to the mark.
This Is well illustrated by a Catalog
of books suitable for children which
was Issued a day or so ago by one of
the big publishing houses. It con- j
tained pages on pages of books for
youngsters and a search of the booklet
shows that every book mentioned is
on the shelves of Harrisburg's library. |
C. L. S. Tingley, president of the
Pennsylvania Street Railway Associa
tion, who has been presiding at the
meetings at the Board of Trade this
week, is president of the American
Railways Company, which operates
lines in a number of cities of the State.
There was an interesting sale of
letters In Philadelphia a short time
ago and while many Harrisburgers"
probably did not know the connection
they were of a native of this city who
achieved fame as a commodore in
Uncle Sam s navy. The letters were
those of David Conners, who was born
here and who commanded the Ameri
can fleet when it assisted in the tak
ing of Vera Cruz and who died while
in command of the Philadelphia navy
yard. The letters had bearing on
many notable events.
The wind-up of the fiscal year al
ways brings some interesting things to
light at the Capitol and It has Just
been found that some corporations
which were not counted as worth
much have been kept alive. This is
due to the fact that the State assesses
them at a valuation of SI,OOO, and ilf
they do not pay the tax they are wiped
off the slate by Judicial proceedings
In almost every instance the tax has
been paid.
Two addresses of unusual interest
are scheduled for Friday night before
the Engineers' Society at the clubhouse
at Front and Chestnut streets. One
will be given by George F. Watt, head
of the Elliott-Fisher Typtewriter Com
pany, and the other by John Price
Jackson. Commissioner of Labor and
Industry and president of the society.
They will talk on ther experiences in
Europe during the outbreak Qf the
war. Both were caught by mobil
ization.

Half of the battle In selling
goods is getting the enthusiasm

The same rule applies to goods
sold over the retailer's counter.
When the retailer is pushing
an article with vim it usually
sells.
National manufacturers are
finding that the surest way to
create dealer enthusiasm is
through newspaper advertising.
When a nationally made ar
ticle of merit is advertised in
the newspapers, the dealers know
the demand will be immediate
and definite.

HARRISBURG TELEGRAPH
DR. BRUMBAUGH IS
ENJOYING THINGS
Says That People Have Fixed Up
Hit Cabinet For Him, but He
Has Done Nothing Yet
WILL KEEP HIS PLEDGES
Intends to Have Considerable to
Say About Local Option
When Assembly Meets
Governor-elect Martin G. Brum- •
baugh had considerable fun with
questioners in Philadelphia yesterday
upon his returjj from the dinner given
in his honor at Washington, and the
sum total of it all was that he had
not made up his mind about appoint
ments and did not Intend to talk
until he did so. He let It be known
that he Intended to keep his cam
paign pledges and that he expected
all good men to help him do so when
the Legislature meets.
—The new Governor looks bronzed
and well. "I was down South for a
month and enjoyed myself, resting
most of the time," said he. "All the
time I was there I did not see a poli
tician or talk politics. I hardly
thought about It. There is much work
ahead for me and X want to be in
shape to do my job well. If I had
worried about things down there, I
might not feel so well as I do."
During his stay at Southern Pines
Dr. Brumbaugh, while not playing
golf, devoted much of his time study
ing the messages of former Governors
of Pennsylvania. "I found much in
the way of suggestions in these
papers," said he, "that was Important
and valuable."
—Upon the question of appoint
ments, the Governor-elect said he had
not seriously taken up that phase of
his future activities. He declared that
unless something unexpected shall
call for him to change his mind, he
will not consider Cabinet appoint
ments until he shall be through with
his work as superintendent of public
schools of Philadelphia on or about
January 14. He is now engaged upon
his annual report as superintendent.
Among those who have been suggest
ed to him for Attorney General, it is
authoritatively stated, are Attorney
General John C. Bell, Francis Shunk
Brown, Superior Court Judge George
B. Orlady. ex-Superior Court Judges
Dlmner Beeber and W. W. Porter,
Deputy Attorney General Jesse E. B.
Cunningham, Speaker George E. Alter
and John S. Killing. Ten names have
been recommended to him. It is
stated, for appointment to the post
of private secretary. It is understood
that while the Governor-elect wants
to surround himself with "loyal Re
publicans" he will also insist that
they shall be "loyal to his adminis
tration flrst."
—When ho was asked about local
option—whether he would use his
power as executive to force the Leg
islature to pass a local option bill, Dr.
Brumbaugh hesitated before replying,
and finally said he didn't care to be
quoted at this time. "In fact," he
said, "I do not believe I should make
any statement now. After I take of
fice, I'll have plenty to say."
—One thing Dr. Brumbaugh
seemed to want to talk about and that
was roads. He said he had inspected
a number of roads in North Carolina
and had found them fine and cheap,
being made of sand and clay. This
kind of road, he pointed out, cannot
be made in Pennsylvania, owing to
the frost. He said he would give con
siderable time to the study of roads
and the Improvement of the notori
ously bad roads of this State. "All
improvements to roads during my ad
ministration," he said, "will have to
be paid for out of current revenue.
The $50,000,000 road loan amendment
to the Constitution was rejected by the
people in 1913 and cannot be brought
up again for four years. That makes
It Impossible to float road loans dur
ing my administration. However, I
hope to do much to better the roads
of the State." Dr. Brumbaugh was
asked If It was true that he Intended
to thoroughly reorganize the Highway
Department of the State. "We will
cross that bridge when we come to
It," he replied.
—State Chairman William E. Crow,
who stopped off here yesterday on his
way from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh,
reiterated his belief that there would
be a short legislative session and much
done, but declined to go into further
particulars. He smiled when the an
tics of the Bull Moosers were called to
his attention.
—Walter J. Christy, the Allegheny
county Republican chairman, was a
visitor to the Capitol to-day and was
heartily congratulated upon the splen
did showing made by his county for
the Republican ticket. Mr. Christy,
who is well known here by reason of
his service as legislative correspond
ent, took hold of the Allegheny cam
paign at a critical stage and got results
that attracted national attention. Fur
thermore, he discovered the error
made by the return judges which was
corrected In court and netted over
#,OOO inore votes for Penrose.
—William Flinn is in Philadelphia,
where he is talking over steps to keep
the Washington party organization
alive without the expense of head
quarters.
-—Members of the Central Demo
cratic Club failed last night to get har
mony on the elections for vice-presi
dent and house committee at the club
supper and it is expected that the
battle will be fought out at the annual
meeting. Herr Moeslein is unopposed
for the preidency.
—The Democratic bosses have
agreed upon W. W. Deeds, of Ligonier,
for the surveyorship at Pittsburgh.
The usual row will break out again.
—E. V. Babcock, Pittsburgh lum
berman, gave a dinner for Allegheny
legislators last night and declared he
was not a candidate for United States
senator.
—Grangers in the state are watch
ing with interest the movement to un
horse William T. Creasy as master and
to thus emphasize the fact that the
Grange is not in partisan politics.

In the midst of the rapidly increas
ing literature of the war and the con
troversy that has raged about the
character and aims of the German
Emperor, it has been strange that no
means have been taken earlier to put
before American readers his own
actual reported public utterances on
his beliefs and policies, which in
various forms, and notably in a com
plete collection in four volumes pub
lished In Berlin, are open to ail Ger
mans.
Professor Christian Gauss of Prince
ton University is preparing a repre
sentative selections from tlie.se
speeches and declarations under the
title of "The German Emperor as
Bhown in His Public Utterances,"
which will be without question th 6
fairest as it is one of the most il
lustrating presentations of this much
disputed character. In it may be
traced with no little clearness the
grov/th of the Emperor's opinions, the
extent to which his ideas have really
gone on the subject of German do
minations, the course he has taken
with regard to war and peace and his
views of his own office and mission.
The opportunity to judge him by hlB
own words is not only one to be wel
comed by all fair Americans, but of
fers, with the history of the occasions
of these utterances, a book of un
common interest In itself to every
reader of history.
It will be published at an early data
by Charles Scribner's Sons.
In "liberal Orthodoxy," Dr. Henry
W. Clark offers historical survey of
the most modern of all religious
movements. Hia study covers the
whole of Europe, and gives full cre
dit to American developments as well.
It can hardly fail to rank as the most
suggestive volume yet devoted to this
far-reaching and rarted movement.
