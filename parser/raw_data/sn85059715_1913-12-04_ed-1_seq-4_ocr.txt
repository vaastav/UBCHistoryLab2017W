An Evening Echo.
: Always say a kind -word If you

Fresldeht Wilson invoked the wfMh
of a thousand women gathered In na
t.onal convention In Washington,
when he failed even to mention wom
an .siirrage in his message. No reason
has been Iusigned 'by him so far as the
Telegram has seen why he did .not
mention that subject, but he may have
good reasons. Perhaps, be will de
liver a special address on the subject.
It Ib Incredible to believe that tho
?president of the United States will
Ignore this nation-wide subject of in
terest.
Jail Conditions.
Annual' Inspection of the county
jail has been made and report there
on made to the criminal court as re
quired by statute. The inspectors did
their work well as shown by the re
port 'and they found rather unsatis
factory conditions, some of which of
course are natural results, such as
?- wore bedding. The system of feed
ing, the lack of health precautions
and the want of proper ventilation are
condemned by the inspectors.
? Various recommendations apparent
ly sensible arid Wholesome are made
by the Inspectors and they can be
speedily put into execution without
harm to anyone or Infliction of hard
shin
The subject is one that interests
hoth the sheriff and the county court
and It IB hoped-ttiitr no- time will be
Jost In msMnir ?h?? "hanges recom
mended by the inspector*.
For Bftter Road Laws,
As a result of the co-operation be
tween the American Bar Association
and the American Highway Assocla
tlon, a deiflnite effort Is to be made
to .revise tho chaotic road laws or
the various etaUa.with a vjew to
codifying and sTmphfnrtg" them Hut1
making them more uniform. The
plan which has been evolved is so
comprehensive that it is believed it
will eventually result In a more uni
form system of all laws, not merely
thope dealing with road'matters, but
those dealing with divorce, marriage
and all other subjects.
A committee of the . American
, Highway Association has been ap
pointed to take charge oI the matter
and this committee is to meet with
C. T. Terry, of New York, who is
chairmhn or the committee on uril
lort^. legislation or the American ,Bar
Association, at the Vanderbilt hotel
on .December 12. The members ot
the American .Highway Association'.
,-conantttea'. are FV'^E.. "Wadham.,, of
AlbTrty, N'Wf A. B. Fletcher, atet?
highway engineer of California ; A.
N. Johnson, atateTUfihWy^ffglneer
<>r Illinois; J>. T. Colgrove, president
of the 'Michigan 3tato. Good IRoads
Association; and J. I. Pennypacker,
seoret^ry of the American Highway
Association,: Mr. Wadhams is chair,
man. ^
It Is recognized T>y the American
Highway Association that most -of
the road legislation In various states
In antiquated and in many Instances
obsolete. Many of the road laws are
one hundred years old. They are
based on Colonial legislation, which,
in turn, had been Ibased on ancient
English precedent. There is very
little uniformity in the laws among
the states and it is relt that this
fact puts obstacles in the way of
those who are seeking to give the
entire nation a network of 'Improved
highways.
It is probable that as a result of
the meeting to ibe held in New York,
the committee of the American 'High
way Association and the representa
tives of the American Jlar Associa
tion will ask the governors of tho
various states to urge upon the leg
islatures the appointment of com
missioners would work In conjunc
and simplify the laws. These com
missioners would work in conjunc
tion with each other so that uni
formity of the various state laws
Might be achieved.

Templemoor, -who lite

Held and <jf whonr all 'Harrison coun
ty people are justly proud:
\MelvlIle Division Post, one 01
(West. Virginia's most talented au
thors, whose Abort stories hare been
produced in several of the leading
magazines of the country, including
the Saturday Evening Post, Pear
son's, the Metropolitan, etc., in the
Metropolitan for (December has a
ftory entitled "An Act of God,"i
which is one of the teat of the
"Uncle Aimer" stories yet coming
from the pen of this strong writer 01
Action. Mr. Post's stories are differ
ent from the writings of most all
other authors of the present day, in
that there is either a strong moral
or a peculiar demonstration of Jus
tice that dictates amoral.
A great many of his' storied are
based on actual decisions of- courts
of ?justice, and he endeavors to im
press always the absolute Impossibil
ity of commission of crime without
evidences being left behind that will
convict the crlmnal. His ' efforts,
therefore, are to unmake criminals,
rattier than to make them as appears
to be the effort of so many present
day writers of stories of crime.
Stories of successful/criminal resign,'
lfke so many now appearing in nc
tlon publication, are inclined toward
encouragement of crime and tiie pub
lishers should cease purchasing nar
ratives oj that kind But not so Mr.
Post's productions. With but the'
singular erceiptlon of hie latest con-w
triluition to the Metropolitan, all the
stories we have -ever read by this au
thor have clpsed with. an unmis
takable warning to Hhe criminally
Inclined; and even in this last one
containing as it may, a justification
of-the "unfwritten 'lafw," there is
something mighty healthy and ele
vating about it.
Mr., Post is ai native of .West Vir
ginia, a lawyer toy profession. and
was for a nllmber of years associated
31tit the Hon. John T. MoGraw, of
rafton, during which time some of
i his strong stories were written. He
Is the author of ?ewerai successful
I books of Action. At the present
I time, because oT his health condi
| tions, we believe, he Is residing in
Pennsylvania. His writings are rec
ognized throughout the county as
containing considerable merit, are
widely read and greatly enjoyed.

; In Massachusetts, New York and
Minnesota there are- laws which
mak.e it optional, but not compulsory
to teach thrift in the public schools.
The school savings-banks are mak- :

little is being done in-the public of
the country to give the children a
grounding in the essentials.or thrift..
Much U being said about agricul
tural and other vocational education,
about manual training and domestic
science 'In the public schools; but
there is no well defined plan for
adding thrift training to thetKhool
curriculum. I
?If it is orth while to teacb

is It not worth while to show'- hiui
also now to administer to better|ad

A school superintendent In a large
city when asked what was being
done in the public schools under his
supervision to systematically instill!
the thrift idea, replied '"Absolutely
nothing." A member off the school
board in the same city asked whether
he did not think thrift training
should have a prominent place In
our educational system, replied
"That is a matter for the home."
