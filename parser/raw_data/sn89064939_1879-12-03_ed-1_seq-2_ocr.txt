for a good or a poor year for wheat.
He says if the wind is in the north
west or north from the 19th to the

from the south during those days,
farmers had better plant com, or
any other crop than wheat, W

he has noticed it for more than 20
years in this country and it has never
failed. Make a note of this and see
how your experience tallies with his.

NEW ULM REVIEW, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1879.
Commenting on the rumor that'
General Grant is to visit the South,
the Philadelphia Times says:
Regardless of all mere partisan
considerations, we hope to see Grant
make an extended journey among
the Southern people. It can't but
be productive of good to the coun
try and if it promotes his Presiden
tial prospects, nobody has a right to
complain. He will be doing to the
South just what he has done to nearly
every civilization of the world, and
wate he then shall have done to the
people of the North and there is no
one whose deliverances to the South
would be so wise or so productive of
peace.

Mr. Griffin's Fatal Joke.
LAST Saturday night Mr. A. Griffin,
of this county, proposed to Mr. Jesse
Yarborough, one of histenants, to play
a joke on some young men who had
been raiding his watermelon-patch.
The plan was this: Mr. Yarborough,
who is a young man about eighteen
years old, was to get the parties sus
pected by Mr. Griffin to go into the
patch after melons, while Mr. Griffin
secreted himself behind a stump near
by. The agreement was that when the
men entered the patch, Mr. Griffin
should fire his pistolin the air, and Mr.
Yarborough should fall, and pretend
that he was shot. Mr. Griffin did
shoot, and Mr. Yarborough fell, and
cried out that he was shot. The other
parties ran off, Mr. Griffin continuing
to shoot in the air as they retreated.
Mr. Griffin, on returningto"the house,
noticed that Mr. Yarborough did not
follow, but continued to cry out, so
he went out to see what was the mat*
ter. On arriving at the spot, he found
that he had shot Mr. Yarborough'*
brains out. Mr. Griffin says it was
purely accidental, and states that as
he attempted to raise the pistol and
shoot in the air, having one finger on
the trigger and the other on the ham
mer, the hammer slipped from his fin
ger before the weapon was raised to
its height. He says he had no idea
that Yarborough was shot until he re
turned to him, and regrets the acci
dent very much. The young man waj
not dead at last accounts, hut there is
no hone of his Teooyerj.-^Handersvilk
