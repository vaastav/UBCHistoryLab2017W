Love in a Cottage.
They may talk of love in a cottage,
And bowers of trellised vine,
Of nature bewitchingly simply,
And milk maids half divine,
They may talk.of the pleasure of sleeping
In the shade of a spreading tree,
And a walk in the fields at morning,
By the side of a footstep free I
But give me a sly'flirtalion
By the Light of a chandalier,
With music to play in the pauses,
And nobody very near,
Or a seat on a silken scia,
With a glass of pure old wine.
And m; mma too blind to discover
The small white hand in mine.
Your love in a cottage is hungry,
Your vine is a nest for flies?
Your milk maid shocks the graces,
And simpUcity talks of pies!
You lie down to shady slumber,
And you wake with a bug in your car,
Andyour damsel that walks in the morning
_ Is shod like a mountaineer.
True love is at home on the carpet,
* And mightily likes his ease?
? True love has an eye for dinner,
And'stories beneath shady trees,
His wing is the fan of a lady,
His foot's an invisible thing,
And his arrow is tipped with a jewel,
And shot from a silver siring.
Gen., Cashing on Secession.
\Yc find in the Boston papers the fol?
lowing letter from the Hon. Caleb Gush?
ing, of Massachusetts, in reply to an invi?
tation to 'address tho citizens of Newbury
port on " the state of the-country." The
letter is well worth reading:
Hon. Albert Currier?Dear Sir:?I had
the honor, some time since, to receive a
communication from yourself and a large
number of other signers, requesting mo to
address tho. citizens of Newburyport on
the subject of the state of the Union.
? To do so at that time seemed to me in?
convenient, first, because of my belief of
the impossibility, ponding the Presidenti?
al cajivass, of tho accommodation of tho
points of controversy between those, who,
while thus differing on temporary ,incidcnt
al,' or personal questions, were yet, in my
judgment, alike tho true friends of the
Constitution; and, secondly, because of
special reluctance to put myself in the pos?
ition of partisan conflict with any of my
immediate fellow-citizens of this city.
But all those questions have passed
away, a*nd yielded place to others of a
higher order and moro comprehensive
character, appertaining to the now im?
minent peril of the dissolution of the Amer?
ican Union.
To tho imminence of that peril, it is no
longer permitted to us to continue, as for
years we have done, wilfully to shut our
eyes. It forces itself upon us in report of
official acts; it has become the chief topic
of tho newspapers; it pre-occupies all
minds; we feel it, throughout the coun?
try, in tho decline of the vendible value of
stocks, merchandise and real estate, and
in the universal disturbance of domestic
productions, trade and labor.
God forbid that, at such a moment, any
thing should be done or said by me to add
to tho intensity of solicitude, which al?
ready exists in this relation. On the
other hand, there is but one thing to allay
it, which can be done or said by or in the
State of Massachusetts.
It avails nothing for us, in Massachu?
setts^ discuss tho question of the expedi?
ency or inexpediency of Secession, and to
endeavor to impress on the Southern States
the sacrcdness of the Union. So long as the
State of Massachusetts maintains a system
of legation plainly contrary to tho Con?
stitution in tho veiy matter of the-special
rights of the Southern States, all cars are
closed to appeals in behalf of tho Union
from us. To such appeals tho answer is
ready-, that when we duly regard tho Con?
stitution ourselves, and not until then, it
will be competent to us to exhort others
States' to respect and observe it; that,
otherwise, wo are but meanly enjoying
tho benefits of the compact without, dis?
charging its obligations; and that our lau?
dation of the Union is alike odious and
ridiculous, whilst we cling to it only as
the means of oxcrting the power of the
Federal Government to tho spoilation,
oppression, and wrong of fifteen States of
the Union. How deeply soever, there?
fore, any citizen of the State of Massachu?
setts may deploro the possibility of the
dissolution of the Union, she is utterly
powerless to dissuade any other State
from seeking or promoting its dissolu?
tion.
Tho nullification laws of Massachusetts
wcro not only most deliberately enacted
in the first instance, but tho question of
their repeal has been earnestly moved in
tho Legislature of the State, first by Mr.
Charles Hale, and afterward by myself;
and although some provisions of mere ex?
acerbation in those laws have been re?
pealed on the recommendation of Gov.
Banks, yet the vicious substance still ex?
ists, and has but just been carefully re-en?
acted in the general revision of tho stat?
utes.
Vainly, therefore, would tho State of
Massachusetts admonish the State of
South Carolina to observe the Constitu?
tion or uphold the Union. If wo would
have equity, we must do equity, and go in?
to court with clean hands. Lectures on
loyalty to tho Federal Constitution como
with poor grace from obstinate and syste?
matic violators of the Constitution. There
k
is but one thing more odious and absurd
than that, and it is tho idea of Masssachu
setts, herself in a state of permanent re?
bellion to the Constitution and laws of
the Union, assuming to coerce other
States into punctilious obedience to the
Constitution and the laws of tho Union.
Nay, if there be any article or articles of
the Constitution, which, with her particu?
lar notions of right or wrong, the State of
Massachusetts cannot or will not fulfill
and obey, then every consideration of
honor, truth, faith, conscience, virtue, re
ligion, would impel her cither to secede at
once from the Union herself, or to co-op
erato with Virginia in the call of a Con?
stitutional Convention to revise the terms
of the federal compact, or at least manful?
ly to extond to South Carolina tho right
hand of cordial nullification and secession
fellowship.
Our forefathers, when the}- found tho
government of their country not to be up
to the height of their standard of liber?
ty or morality, strove in the first place to
change the government, and, failing :'in
that, they withdrew themselves from it.
J& such course there was dignity and
spirit both?there is none in keeping the
good of the Union and refusing its price:
asserting the bond of the Constitution
where it is favorable to Massachusetts,
and repudiating it where it is favorable to
South Carolina. Conduct of the hitcor
sort, in ordinary life, has ugly names?as
cheatingjSwindling, fraud?and it deserves
no softer appellation in the acts of a State
or a people.
Futhermore, so long as the State of
Massachusetts perseveres in this nullifica?
tion of the Constitution, she affords, not a
pretext onry, but a justificatory cause to the
State of South Carolina, to that of Georl
gia, Alabama, Mississippi, or any other
State, otherwise disposed to secede; for
the violation of the fundamental compact
of association by one of the contracting
parties, serves, in morality as well as law,
to release the others; and the unconstitu?
tional and dishonorable attitude of the
State in this matter is not less mischeiv
ous in another respect, to wit: its obvious
tendency to paralyze the conservative ef?
forts of other Southern States, not yet
prepared to secede, such as Mailand, Vir?
ginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Ten?
nessee.
I think there is a duty in this behalf,
which it is incumbent on Massachusetts,
and every loyal citizen of the State to per?
form; one, which it is never too early to
enter upon, and never too late to persist
in; and which it is peculiarly fitting for
us to undertake now?namely, to repeal
unconditionally these laws?which are
scandalously false in their profession of
purpose?which are tyrannical in then-do?
mestic and treasonable in their Federal
relation?and which misrepresent the spir?
it and disgrace the legislation of our Com?
monwealth.
As this is the duty of all, it is the duty
of every one; and, therefore, it will give
me pleasure to speak on the subject; to
expose the gravity of the situation; to de?
monstrate our obligation regarding it,and
to participate with you in the initiation of
measures, for the wiping out of this foul
blot from this escutcheon of the State of
Massachusetts.
Having done that, we shall then have
tho right, happen what may, to stand
erect, to hold up our head in the Union,to
look our sister States in the face,.and if
need be, to address fraternal exhortation
to the State of South Carolina.
I am, very faithfully,
C. GUS III XG.
Newburyport, November 19, 1860.

The " Overt Act."?A writer in the
Eichmond (Va.) Examiner, arguing to
prove that the election of Lincoln is sulli
cient to justify a dissolution of the Union,
or even to make such a step necessary,
thus refers to the proposition to wait for
an overt act:
"But setting this aside, thus much is
plain, that any overt act of the Federal
Government would be less a warrant for
the resistance on the part of the South
than is the menacing action of the North?
ern States in electing Mr. Lincoln. And
plainly it might be urged that then we
should wait for a change of administra?
tion. But as the matter stands, what
hope can wo wait for ? Absolutely none.
Wo havo both the Federal Government
"against us and the whole united body of
the Northern States. We have this as
matters now stand. But day by day the
Federal Government will strengthen that
party to which it owes its success; and
that party reciprocally will strengthen
tho Government. Meantime the South
will become weaker and weaker.
"We must profit by the experience of
others where we havo none of our own.
Franco, not long since, was a Eepublic.
The President was suspected of trasona
ble designs. The opposition leaders wait?
ed for some overt act. And we know the
result. We should see, in our case at
least, the most humiliating spec tacle on
earth?all the Southern States subdued
by pure passive inaction, just as we have
seen the Monarch of Naples vanish with?
out any definite or palpable attack."

than fourteen certificates of various qual?

The Only Remedy.
So far as South Carolina in concerned,
the unanimous voice of .her people has
disposed of the question of secession. She
will unquestionably withdraw from the
Union as early as practicable after the
meeting of the Convention.
The next question is, will the exercise
of this indispensable right of sovereignty
involve her in war? Will the Federal
Government attempt to force her to l'e
main in this present Union ? We are dis?
posed to think not. although we have in?
timations to the effect that President
Buchanan i.s opposed to secession. Such
action on his part would be a denial of
the highest principle of the State Rights
party, and would stamp him as a federal?
ist and consolidationist. If a State has
not the right to resume her sovereignty,
she has no rights at all in this present
Union, and is no more or less than a col?
ony under the government at Washing?
ton. No man at this day, who ever main?
tained the first principle of State sovere?
ignty or State Rights, could consistently
take such a position.
South Carolina,through her former Con?
vention, eight years ago, asserted this
right; and, the time having arrived for
her to exercise it, we do not believe she
will be opposed by the Federal Govern?
ment; if she should be, however,-the strug?
gle would be a short one, for. tho attempt
to use force would bring to her side every
slaveholding State, and no doubt would
then exist of the prompt formation of a
Southern Confederacy, embracing the
whole of them. Secession, therefore, wc
believe to be a peaceful remedy, and the
only remedy for the evils we suffer from
our present political connection.
In some quarters of the South, and by
some inofficial positions, it has been pro?
posed to have a convention of all the
Southern States. What benefit would re?
sult from such a meeting before the sep?
arate action of the States we cannot see.
The delegates to such a Convention would
not be clothed with authority to take the
South, as a section, out of the Union.
Even if they should be unanimous as to
the course the Southern States should pur?
sue, they wotdd have to return to their
constituencies, submit the proposed meas?
ures to the people for ratification, and at
last each State for herself would have to
act in her sovereign capacity. By such a
course time would be lust, divisions among
the people on points of expediency might
spring up, leading to parties : compromis?
es and hollow proposals of amity and
friendship would pour in upon the South,
until resistance would be finally lost sight
of through the machinations of Union-sav?
ers and submission isfs.
Separate State Action commends itself
then as an effectual, prompt, and (in all
probability) a peaceful remedy for evils al?
ready, borne too long, and the surest in?
strumentality in the great work of our po?
litical deliverance and disenthral men t.

Mkssaok of (Jov. Rector, of Arkan?
sas.?We copy from the Little Rock True
Democrat, the following extract from the
Message of Governor Jtoctor: lt
[ The issue made up by the North, and
which woof the South will not be permit?
ted to decline, is. the Union without
slaveryj or slavery without the Union.
Wiiat portion of the Confederacy will
be so infatuated as not to prepare for the
coming of this sad event? What magis?
trate of the law will lull his people into
fancied security, by promises of peace and
safety, when an enemy is at their door?
God forbid that I should bo an alarm?
ist; that I should be insensible of the
wide-spread desolation that would fix it?
self, like a pall, upon the American peo?
ple, should disruption ensue. But I am
not. nor will I content myself with any?
thing less than a faithful exposition ol my
.views upon this subject.
Eleven of the Northern States, by sol?
emn legislative enactments, have nullified,
revoked, and trampled upon the Federal
Constitution. Maine, Connecticut, New
York, Rhode Island, New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Wisconsin
Massachutts, Michigan, and Vermont,
have prohibited their officials and citizens
from aiding in the execution of the li Fu?
gitive Slave Law." By their action, the
Federal compact has been broken?they
have revolutionized the Government, and
have left every other State absolved from
its Federal allegiance, and free, as an in?
dependent and sovereign government, to
seek its own destiny.
But the question is asked, whether or
not these offences, coupled with the elec?
tion of a chief executive avowedly hostile
to an extension of slavery, is cause justi?
fying, as a matter of policy, immediate se?
cession ?
To my mind, no farther local justifica?
tion is necessary. Still, if the Union was
severed to-day, leaving the slave States
standing as the}r originally stood sover?
eign and independent governments, recon?
ciliation and compromise might, neverthe?
less, be induced by moderation, and a free
interchange of sentiment evolved by au?
thority through conventions assembled
by the Northern and Southern portions of
the Union respectively.
In view, then, of the bare possibility
that the North may still be induced to re?
trace her steps, and award to the South?
ern States tho rights guaranteed to them
by the Constitution, I cannot counsel pre?
cipitate or hasty action, having for its ob
ject a final Separation of the States, and
breaking up of the Union.
Should any one of the Southern States,
however, prompted by a spirit of just re?
sentment towards the North.deem it nec?
essary to declare her independence, and
assert a separate nationality, Arkansas,
having like grievances, and a common
purpose to subserve, ought not to with?
hold her sympathies and active support,
if coercive measures be adopted by the
General Government.
Undcrsuch an exigency. 1 should regard
it as an imperative duty to convene the
General Assembly, that the matter might
be referred to the people for their prima?
ry action and advice.
How Jon n "Wkntwortii Proposes to
Coerce.?The Chicago Democrat, the es?
pecial orga atof Abe Lincoln, has thus ear?
ly indicated the plan of coercing Virgin?
ia:
" In order to provide for all emergen?
cies, and to have at hand the safest, and
cheapest, and surest way of taking care of
the Virginians, a messenger has been sent
to North Elba, for the suit of clothes
worn by .lohn Brown when he made his
celebrated foray at Harper's Ferry.?
Upon the first intelligence of any traitor?
ous act in Virginia, this suit will be at
once taken to the scene of disturbance
and prominently displayed. That will be
quite sufficient. The chivalry will at
once retire to their holes, as the}* did be?
fore, and us the Federal troops will not
be allowed to go to their aid, the ghost
of John Brown will he enough to keep
them perfectly quiet."
Washington, November "js.?The
President takes the position, in bis Mes?
sage, that while denying the constitution?
al right of a State to secede ho will at?
tempt no coercion, but that he will see,
nevertheless, that the Federal Laws are exe?
cuted. That these are the views of the
President. 1 have from the most reliable
authority.
Secretary Howoll Cobb is quite ill to?
day. His family and all his household
effects will he removed to Georgia on Sat?
urday next.
The concluding portion of the Message
of Gov. Gist, of your State, is exciting
much comment among the political here
Gen. Scott has not been ordered here,
in the event of difficulties between the
State and Federal Governments, as has
I been stated in leading journals.
Senator-Jeff. Davis, of Missisippi, is in
the city, lie is strongly in favor of seces?
sion.
The Government officials were paid off
in specie to-day by a very close calcula?
tion. The Treasury is almost bankrupt.

Senator Wilson, of Mass., in the subjoin?
ed remarks, indicates beyond doubt the
real feeling of the Republican party, de?
spite of their hypocritical professions of
conservatism:

That haughty power which corrupted the
Whig party, strangled the American par?
ty and used the Democratic party as a
tool. Ues crushed to the dust to-night, ami
our heel is upon it. And. sir?said the
Senator?that power never rises again ;
it can never more sway the destinies of
the Government of the United States.?

statement which has been extensively
published, to the effect that he has declar?
ed that he would resist, with the Federal
troops, an}- attempts that might he made
to sei;:o the United States forts in the
South.
A large number of members of Con?
gress arrived to-nighl. Also, Seward and
Sumncr, of the Seriate. It is expected
that the session will be the most* stormy
ever witnessed here arc in a terrible slate
of apprehension and doubt in relation to
the secession movement. Yet the city is
lively, and all the hotels are already pret?
ty well filled.
Out of Empoyment.?The New York
Journal of Commerce thinks it would
probably be no exaggeration to estimate
the numder of persons thrown ont of em?
ployment since election day at 25.?UU a
large proportion of whom are young
women. One clothing establishment in
New York has discharged 1,U0\) workmen;
a has establishment has discharged nearly
1,000; a sad lory firm has reduced its force
about 500; and curtailment is very general.
At Newark, especially, the crieis is scverly
felt, on account of their extensive connec

THE GLOBE,
THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF CONGRESS.
IPUBLISH now my annual Prospectus of THE
DAILY GLOBE, and the CONGRESSIONAL
GLOBE, to remain subscribers, and inform those
who may desire to subscribe, that Congress will
meet on tiic first Monday of next December, when
I shall resume publishing the above-named papers.
They have been published so long, that most pub?
lic men know their character,and therefore I deem
it needless to give a minute account of the kind
of matter they will contain.
THE DAILY GLOBE will contain a report of the
Debates in both branches of Congress as taken
down by reporters, equeal, at least to any corps of
short hand-writers in this, or in any other country.
A majority of them will each, be able to report,
verbatim, ten thousand words an hour, while the av?
erage number of words spoken by fluent speakers
rarely exceeds seven thousand five hundred words
an hour. When the debutes of a day do not make
more than forty-five columns, they will appear in
The Daily Globe of the next morning, which will
contain, also, the news of the day, together with
ing events.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE AND APPEN?
DIX will contain a report of all the Debates in Con?
gress, revised by the speakers, the Messages of the
President of the United States, the Annual Reports
of the Heads of the Executive Departments, the
Laws rassed during the sessions, and copious in?
dexes to all. They will be printed on a double
royal sheet, in book form, royal quarto size, each
number containing sixteen pages. The whole will
make, it is believed, at least 2,001) pages. This is
acknowledged to be the cheapest work ever sold in
any country, whether a reprint or printed from
manuscript copy, taking for Jala the average num?
ber of words it contains.
The coming session will, without doubt, be an
unusually interesting one. becausethedebates will,
in a great measure, be upon the policy of the Pres?
ident elect, and The Globe will be, as it has been
for many years past, the only source from which
full debates of Congress can be obtained.

to the above Sewing Mach n.-s. These machines
are reliable, simple, cheap and durable, and well

the fines! fabric to the coarsest plantation goods.
It is wonderful the amount of labor they save.
Ladies who have tried them, are completely fasci?

their work is done. These .Machines, now offered
to the public of Anderson and I'ickens Districts
by the undersigned, through their regular ngent,
Mr. John Hammond, are thought to bo superior to
anything of the kind yet ottered in this market,
when you take into account the price, the Jtiiitj'liciig
of their much in cry, and the eaSc of learning to
sew on them. The learning to sew is often difti

so than on any machine the subscribers have seen.

EDITOR.
Newbcrry District being one of the richest Cotton
Districts in South Carolina, her people are largo
consumers of every kind of merchandize. The
CONSERVATIST, therefore, furnishes one of the
best mediums in the State for advertisers, so far as
Newbcrry District is concerned, while it enjoys a
fair circulation in the surrounding Districts. The
terms for inserting advertiscmcnts are certainly as
reasonable as those of any other journal in the
country, especially when it is desired to advertise
by contract.
The CONSERVATIST numbers among it/* con?
tributors gentlemen of the first talent and soundest
political faith. With their assistance, the editor
will endeavor to make his journal an acceptable
and ever welcome family newspaper and fire-side
companion.
The political character of the paper is "of the
strongest States Rights stamp. Believing that the
Constitution under which the Confederacy of tho
American States was formed, has been repeatedly
and grossly violated, and that "the Plantation
States " have been the only sufferers?that the
Union of these States is no longer a policy founded,
on the principles of right and justice, but that th<&
bond of Union is " the cohesive power of public;
plunder"?the proprietors prefer that their journal
shall rather soem to be a Southern Extremist than
appear an unconditional advocate of tho Union at
any price.
TERMS.?The paper will be regularly mailed to
subscribers out of the town of Ncwberry at the fol?
lowing reasonable rates of subscription:
One copy, per year, - - $2.00
Three copies, - 5.00
Five copies, - - 8.00
Ten copies, - - - ? * 15.00
Twenty copies, - 25,00
J85a*f** The money upon these terms always to b
paid in advance.
No paper will be discontinued until all arrearages
arc paid, and no paper mailed until the subscrip?
tion price is received; unless at the option of the
proprietors, when the circumstances call for a dif?
ferent course.
