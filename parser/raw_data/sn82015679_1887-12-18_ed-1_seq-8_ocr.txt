The stock market was again extremely dull to-day,
but with a generally firm tone, the result of the ope
rations of the sessions being to leave prices, in most
eases, fractions bettor than those of the previous day.
Thai was a great indisposition to trade, the business
Tat being confined to the room-traders almost en
tirely, who ware of a bearish temper in the early deal
ings, owing to reports of European complications and
the unfavorable statements of the Granger roads. De-
e.mS at toe opening maacea some baying, However,
which was encouraged by the expeetation of a favor
able bank statement, and the early losses were gener
ally made up.The only features to the market were the
bit ominous coal stocks, and New England, which de
veloped considerable strength, though the latter bare-
' ly recovered the loss at the opening. The business in
the remainder was entirely without feature, and the
changes in quotations were for insignificant fractions
nly. Most stocks were from 8 to 4 per cent, be
low yesterday's final figures at the opening, but Read
ing was down and New England and Kansas & Tex-
' as each. New England and Lackawanna exhibited
some strength, and the former advanced 1 per
cent., .but the general list was intensely
dull, though ' a firm . tone existed and
mall fractions of gain were established
among those stocks traded in. Toward 11 o'clock
xnere was noticeaoie a drooping tendency, wnica was
Specially marked in Kansas A Texas, but the market
rallied and dosed firm at near the best prices reached.
The smaller eoal stocks were features in the last
latjr; being strong and comparatively aetive. Most
of the list are higher, but the only important changes
re gains of la per cent, each in Hocking and Color
'da Coal.
The railroad bond market was quiet; sales, $400,
, O00, Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe firsts rose 2. to
121; Hocking Valley fives lost 3, at 6d, and Wabash

CHICAGO, Dee. 17. Pork was the favorite article
Cn the list for the brokers at the opening; of the Board
of Trade this morning. On a big bid bv a local opera
tor, the May option opened at $16, but the general
crowd waa only bidding at $15.95, and in half an
sour the pries had eased off to $15.85. This last
Crura, however, was a fraction above last night's
dose, the strength being due to light receipts. Later,
on heavy "bear" movements, the option went down to.
915.75, bit soon rallied to $15.82i. The record
tit the other markets during the first hour was similar
to that of pork. May lard opened .0790 higher, at
8-2"o. May wheat opened at 83780 and May corn
i 04. -xraaing was not unusually large. During

INDIANAPOLIS MARKETS.
Trade Becomes Ouiet as the Tear Nears Its
Close.
Indianapolis. Dec 17.
Trade is rather quiet, but reaches the usual volume
in the last half of December, but is dull as compared
with the preceding months of this year. No one is
complaining, as the sales of the twelve months past
have been very satisfactory and handsomely in excess
ot any preceding year in nearly all departments, and,
as a rule, prices have been firm and declines few. This
coupled with the fact that but few bad debts have
been made, are among the favorable features of the
year's business. In prices to-day there were but few
fluctuations in values. Poultry, game and fruits suit
able for the holiday trade are beginning to moie
briskly, and will continue so to do for the coming
week. Arrivals of poultry endgame are liberal. Christ
mas is always the best time to sell well-fatted turkeys
and geese, and usealir they are readily disposed of,
while poor thin stock sells slow. Chickens are not
wanted halt as bad as good turkeys, and wise farmers
will hold their chickens until after the holidays, when
better prices will be realized. The apple trade is
slow, few large lots selling and trading is largely to
the peddlers. Vegetables receive moderate attention
at unchanged prices. The provision market has taken .
on a better tone with the lighter arrivals of hogs. The
Cincinnati Price Current says: The past week has
fallen largely helow the corresponding time last year
in r umber of hogs handled by Western packers. For
the ten leading points the total for the week is 317,
OOO hogs, against 481,000 last year a reduction; of
104. OOO; the total is 103,000 smaller than the
preceding week. Ten other points have packed
50.00O " hogs, against 59,000 for same
week last year. The aggregate packing to
date is probably about 175,000 hogs less tnan a year
ago. There is no essential ehange manifest in regard
to quality. The average weight is generally lighter
than a year ago outside of central and western Iowa
and Nebraska, and some localities in western Illinois.
Grocers are having quiet times. A few small orders
are coming in. They look for a brisk trade, however,
after the holidays, as stocks of the retail merchants
are getting low. In prices there were no changes,
and the present range will probably rule until after
the holidays. The position of both the coffee and the
sugar markets is such as to indicate higher prices in
the coming month. The hide market is sluggish;
prices weak. The iron market is firm; trade active.
Hardware dealers report trade as quiet, but the pros
pects of an early, brisk spring trade favorable. The
seed market is quiet and prices steady at the recently
revised quotations.
GRAIN.
The local market was steady at Friday's prices, the
attendance on 'Change, as usual on Saturday,' was
small and little interest shown except in early de
liveries. " Futures dealers are disposed to bid cau
tiously on. Traok bids to-day ruled as follows:

PRESIDENTIAL POVERTY.
Relative of Great Men Whose Lives Hsts
Been Cast In Unpleasant Places.
Washington Letter in New York World.
A niece of Andrew Jackson had to bee for a
sight's lodging at a Washington hotel this week.
Sixty years old and without a cent in her pocket,
she arrived here from Washington Territory on
her way to her friends at Stannton, Va. Her
transportation from Chicago had been furnished
by charity, and it was charity that gave her a
night's rest here and sent heron her way Sonth.
Sae bad three grandchildren with her and she
was absolutely destitute. She has many friends
at Staunton, and she seemed y bright and cheer
ful in the midst of her trouble. The children
wen well dressed, and they showed no sign of
the lorrow which seems to hane over the rela
tives and descendants of oar Presidents.
Thomas Jefferson's granddaughter, Septima
Meikleham, died here recently, leaving several
grancchildren to battle with the world. One of
her sens, owing to a severe sickness, is not at all
strong mentally. One of her daughters is not
well enough to work, and the other is employed
in one of the government departments. An
other great-granddaughter of Jefferson has
eharga ot a school in Baltimore, and Monticello
has lots since passed ont of the bands of the
family. Just before Jefferson died he was so
much 11 debt that a lottery scheme was gotten
no to sell his property and relieve his necessi
ties. H left practically nothing to his children,
and the; received some two sums of $10,000 each
from th Legislatures of two of the Southern
States. .
John Tyler left some property, but it all went
to his second wife. One of his sons. General
John Tylsr, who drove a four-in-hand while his
father wis in the White House, and who was
then called, the handsomeest man in Washing
ton, lives off a position in the Treasury Depart
ment, and one of Tyler's most accomplished
daughters, a lady who presided over the execu
tive mansfth after her mother's death and until
her father tnarried Julia Gardner, is a guest at
Corcoran's Old Ladies' Home here. A man who
claims to b one of the Washington family, and
who, by ths way, has a face strikingly like that
of the President, peddles trinkets in a little
booth in the Pension Building. Dolly Madison,
the President's wife, was, during a part of ner
last days, famished food by a colored man who
had been in President Madison's service She
got, however,' a large sum of money from Con
gress for Madron's papers, and it was this that
eased her decining years.
Most of the,' Presidents have died poor, and
few of them hive made much out of office-holding.
Monroe visa- so poor that his latter days
were spent vith bis son-ic-law. Samuel L.
Gouverneur, in ?sw York, and there he died.
Harrison left nothing to speak of. Polk left
about $150,000 including Polk Place, at Nash
ville, where his widow now lives. It is a valua
ble block of grdind in the center of the town,
which has riseujaigely in v&lue since the Presi
dent's death.
Martin Van Btren made money out of poli
tics. He started life poor and died well-to-do.
One estimate pub his estate at 1800.000. and he
made money in ieal estate as well as in law.
Both ot the Adamses were money-savers, 'if not
money-makers. Ths letters of John Adams,
the second Presile jt, to his wife. Abigail, re
peatedly urge htrU cut down the household
expenses and to ptattice economy. He lunched
himself on oat-ctki. and lemonade, and he
walked far oftenerlhan he rode
John Quiocy ASaas received nearly a halt
million dollars fror the government in salaries
during bis lifetime, and be possessed the Yankee
thrift The Adams family at present is one of
the riehest in New England, and I was told at
Kansas City that Charles Francis Adams had
more than a million dollars invested in real es
tate there. He has railroad stocks and bonds in
addition, and he makes his money breed like
Anstralian rabbits.
Andrew Jackson spent more than his salary
while he was in the While Honse. and be had
to borrow money to keep up with his expenses.
Thomas Jefferson borrowed the money that car
ried bim out of Washington when he left the
presidency, and Andy Johnson, though he en
tertained considerably, is supposed to have
saved at least $50,000 during his White Honse
career. He died. I am told, worth about $100,
OOO. and the most of this came from economy.
It was a pretty good estate for a tailor to leave
James Buchanan was making about $7,000 a
year at the law when he entered Congress, and
he spent during bis presidency what was left
from his living expenses in charity. He was
not, however, a rich man when he died, and his
estate of Wheatland was sold a year or two
ago.
President Fillmore began life as a wool-carder.
During the three years he was engaged to his
sweetheart he had not enough money to pay the
expenses of the 150 miles which lay between bet
home in Saratoga county. New York, and where
he had begun to practice law. During the first
Tears of their marriage his wife did the house
work and taught school, and still he died one of
the richest of the Presidents. The greater part
of his fortune, however, came from his second
marriage to a rich woman of Buffalo, whom he
courted after his first wife died.
President Cleveland is supposed to be worth
about $100,000, and be owns, I am told, real es
tate in Buffalo which is rapidly advancing in
value. President Arthur left much less than he
was supposed to be worth. Garfield, shortly
before his death, owed $30,000 to Gen. Swaim,
and Grant did not add to bis fortune by his
White House career. Hayes made money ont
of the presidency, and is rich through inherit
ances and economy. The Presidents, as a rule,
have not saved money during their presidency;
but the same abilities which made them Presi
dents would, if tbey bad been used in the field
of money-making and money-saving, have given
them fortunes.
GRAY'S ELEGY.
Some New Facts About the Famons Poem
flow the Author Wanted It Printed.
Frederick francders, in the "Story of Eome Famous
Books."
Of Gray's 'Elegy it is related that General
Wolfe, on the evening preceding the memorable
battle of the Plains of Abraham, repeated the
noble and seemingly prophetic line.
"The paths cf glory lead but to the grave!"
to his brother officers, adding: "Now, gentle
men. I would rather be the author of that poem
than take Quebec!" There are two manuscripts
of the "Elegy" in existence, one containing five
stanzas which the author never inserted in tbe
published editions. Gray, with a friend, once
saw an elegant book-case filled with a choice
collection of French classics, handsomely bound,
the price of wbich was one hundred guineas.
He expressed a strong desire for this lot, but
could not then afford to buy it The conversa
tion between the poet and his friend being over
beard by the Duchess of Northumberland, who
was acquainted with the latter, she took tbe
opportunity of ascertaining who his friend was.
Upon finding that it was Gray the poet, she at
once bought the book-case, with its contents,
and sent it to his lodgings, with a note, import
ing that she was "ashamed of sending so small
an acknowledgment for the infinite pleasure she
had received in readine the 'E.egy in a Country
Churchyard,' of all others her most favorite
poem."
That of t quoted couplet
"Where ignorance is bliss,
Tis folly to be wise."
we derive from his Ode to Eton College.
Gray began his Elegy soon after the death of
his friend Kichard West, about 1742; it is sup
posed the event prompted the poem. It wss
laid aside, however, for nearly seven year, and
in 1750 was resumed, when the poet thus re
ferred to the circumstance in his letter to Wal
pole: "I have been here at Stoke a few days (where
I shall continue good part of the summer), and
having put an end to a thing whose beginning
you have seen long ago, I immediately send it
you. You will, I hope, look upon it in the light
of a thing with an end to it a merit that most
of my writings have wanted, and are likely to
want"
The Elegy was much handed about in manu
script, and like Coleridge's "Chris label," in that
condition gained considerable celebrity. In 1751
it was ascertained that it was likely to be pub
lished without his consent, and Gray desired
Walpole to place bis copy in Dodsley'a hands, to
be printed and published, with this direction:
"Print it without any interval between the
stanzas, because the sense is, in some places,
continued beyond them; and the title must be
"Elegy Written in a Country Church-yard." If
be would add a line or two, to say it came into
his hands by accident, I should like it better."
It baa not been ascertained how long Gray was
engaged upon the structure of the Elegy, al
though be is known to have made frequent re
visions and alterations of it. The actual locality
of its composition is, we believe, a yet undeter
mined; there is a tradition that it was within the
precincts of the church of Granchester, about
two miles from Cambridge; and tbe "curfew"
is supposed to have been the great bell of St
Mary's.
It would be superfluous to speak of the merits
of this matchless poem, its world-wide popular
ity evinces how universally it charms and im
presses the reader. It has been translated into
Hebrew, Greek, Latin. French, Italian, Portu
guese, German, and re-printed more frequently
in tbe original than almost any other production
of its class.
