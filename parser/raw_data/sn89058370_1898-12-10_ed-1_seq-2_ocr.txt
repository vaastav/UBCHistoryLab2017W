Destructive Forest Fires.
The fires that have been raging in the
forests of Wisconsin and Colorado are
likely to prove more destructive of our
timber wealth than any of previous oc
currence. This is a disheartening ex
perience, because this year, for the first
time, a new force of government offi
cials, known as forest rangers, has been
employed to detect incipient fires and
prevent their spread. That their serv
ice has opparently been a failure it is
said cannot justly be attributed to de
fects In the system. The German gov
ernment, which h.is been conspicuously
successful in forest preservation and
cultivation, maintains a kind of forest
gendarmerie, a semi-military organiza
tion, uniformed and armed, and under
the strictest discipline. This force is
charged with the duty of executing
both the forest and the game laws. Its
officers must have had thorough in
struction in forestry, as well as training
in the command of men, and those un
der them are familiar with the regions
which they are required to patrol.
It may be difficult to engraft such a
body of forest wardens upon our sys
tem, but until we can employ for this
duty trained and responsible men, un
der strict and intelligent control, the
large sum which the government now
pays annually for forest rangers will
be to a degree wasted.
Damon and Pythins were as nothing
compared to two Brookl3'n women
that is, until recently. Damon and
Pythias were pretty devoted people in
their way, but they didn't wear each
other's hair, while the two Brooklyn
women had one switch between them
for a long, long time. It all came out
j-when they quarreled and one of them
'sued the other for the return of the
switch, at the same time making this
explanation to the court: "Both our
beads of hair are the same shade of
yellow. Some years ago mine began
to fall out and my mother had a switch
wade for me of my own hair. I fre
quently let Mrs. I'ierson wear my
switch. She used to say it was a test
of friendship. The other day she bor
Irowed it and refuses to give it back
again. I prize that hair and I want
that woman arrested."

'phenomenal in the annals of the rec

Admiral Dewey's sword will cost
'$3,000, but the one to be presented to
iAdmiral Schley by Pennsylvanians will
cost $3,500, and will be the flneBt sword
that has ever been presented to either
a military or naval officer of this gov
ernment. The scabbard will be in
crusted with diamonds, the hilt will be
ornamented with a large opal, and the
blade will be Damascened steel, and
will be highly wrought and embel
lished with etchings. With the excep
tion of the blade all the metal work
will be 18-karat gold.
Giant bees, one and a half times as
large as the kind now in vogue, are to
be imported into the United States
from the Philippine islands. The honey
combs they construct are said to be five
times as large as that of ordinary bees,
and when they are angry it takes them
3 . seconds to make ready to sting. To
those who come in contact with these
new pain packers we would suggest the
unwisdom of trusting too implicitly in
the latter portion of this statement or
the latter portion cf the anatomy of the
insect.
A kite expert undertook a few days
ago to prove that the statue of Liberty
In New York harbor absorbed the elec-
triclty in its neighborhood. The little
electrical conductor was sent up along
the string to within 30 feet of the head
of the statue, and the nearer it ap
proached the larger were the sparks
obtained. So tho experimenter was
forced to conclude that the statue tends
to increase the electricity near at hand
instead of absorbing it.
Twenty-five thousand headstones are
delivered every year at the expense
of the government to the friends of
deceased soldiers, who ore expected to
place them up at their own expense.
The stones are three feet high from
the ground, and ten inches wide. '
It is reported that Admiral Dewey

Onr Country's Wealth.
The wealth of the American people
to-day surpasses that of any other na
tion, past or present. The develop
ment of the intellectual and industrial
power of the United States hus in the
past 70 years been stupendous, but our
immediate concern is not with thut,
but with the marvelous growth in the
wealth of the country. The census
taken in 1S20 shows the wealth of the
United States as $1,060,000,000, or an
average of $205 for each head of the
population. Seventy years later, to take
the full length of liuinnn life, the re
turn was $05,037,000,000, or $1,030 per
inhabitant. The rote of increase has
not been uniform throughout the pe
riod mentioned. In the first interval
of 20 years our country doubled its
wealth, in the second it wasqu'adrupled.
but in the following years, although the
increase of wealth per head v;ns un
precedented, the rate of geometrical
progression was much less. From 1S21
to 1840 the average annual increase was
about $100,000,000, or a little over $7.50
per head of the population ; in the next
20 years it was about $635,000,000, or
nearly $30 per inhabitant; from 1861
to 1880 the annual increase was near
ly $1,370,000,000. or over $30 per inhabit
ant. These figures are startling enough,
but in the last decade of our 70 years
the accumulation has been still more
marvelous, the average annual Increase
being over $2,225,000,000, or about $40
per inhabitant.
She Bossed the Governor.
Sick soldiers are constantly passing
through Washington, and a number of
women who live there have left their
homes to administer to the soldiers and
furnish them with the delicacies which
are not supplied by the government.
These women enter the trains and per
form the duties of nurses, which the
government in many instances failed
to supply. When a New Jersey regi
ment passed through there recently
one of these women noticed a soldier
who seemed to have but a short time
to live and endeavored to cheer his few
remaining hours. She needed a basin
of water to wash the face of the suffer
ing soldier, and seeing a man dressed
in citizen's attire standing near or
dered him to bring it to her. lie
obeyed the order with alacrity, and
several times was ordered to "bring
more water," which he did cheerfully
When the train was about to depart the
woman thanked the citizen for his
services and inquired who he was
Much to her surprise she learned that
it was the governor of New Jersey who

Here is an instructive story that
comes from Indiana. The state board
of health tells-it in its latest annual
report The scene was Clarksville: "Ty
Dhoid invaded the family of Mr. Klotz.
and three children were smitten, but
all recovered. The health officer, Dr
Camp, suspected the water, and had
an analysis made by the state board.
The water was found to be polluted,
and the well condemned. Mr, Klotz,
however, had little faith in boards
of health and their methods, and re
fused to believe that the well he had
drank from for years had become dan
gerous. He therefore gave no heed,
but kept on drinking from the old
well. The gentleman is now down with
typhoid fever himself, and Is thorough
ly subjugated.
The Casinol Espanol at Santiago de
Cuba, before the capture of the city,
was the clubhouse of the Spanish offi

other sources of amusement waB
gramophone, and one of the musical
airs it produced was a great favorite
among the Spaniards. They did r.ot
know the name of the tune, or its com'
poser, but they caused it to be ground
out on all occasions. When the Amer
ican ling was raised in the town they
heard with amazement the same air
played by the regimental band of the
Sixth United States cavalry, and were
informed when they asked that it was
the "Star Spangled Banner."
In Camp Black not long ago it was
noticed that nearly all the cases of ty
phoid fever came from one regiment
whose camp was in perfect order and

sending for cool water to a neighboring
farm well. Within 12 feet of the well

prospective husband to secure a mar
riage license she met an old lover, who
called Lcr aside and convinced her that

marry him. She broke the news gently
to the other young man, urging that
the new arrival had more money and
that consequently she loved him better,

fT-dd Occupations'.
Many funny things may be observed
by one who stands around the registra;
tiou office, remarks the Kansas City
Journal. At Topcka a man gave his
occupation us "contractor." lie has
the contract to keep the weeds down
in the state house yard. A young man
who wus doing his first work as a re
porter upon a small weekly paper gave
his occupation as "journalist." The
next man to step to the desk was one
of the veteran editors of Kansas, who
subscribed himself a "newspaper man."
At Wichita a man asked to be put down
us an "invalid" and two others said:
I guess you will have to put me down
as a loafer, in tne same Town a man
gave hi3 age at 37 and his occupation
as "elevator boy." Another Wichita
man subscribed himself as a "dealer in
wet goods," a term, by the way, which
has oceans of significance in Kansas.
In Leavenworth one of those fellows
who do business behind three golden
balls gave his occupation as ''capital
ist," and the jocular fellow who hauls
off dead horses, dogs and cows at
Atchison recorded himself as a "taxi
dermist." Ruined by Mules.
An Alabama farmer says that many
negroes in tne soutn are ruiueu ujr
mules, and he thinks he has proved it.
. , J V ..
He owns a great deal of farm !snd,
which he rents to negroes on condiaon
that they shall do thelrwork with an ox
instead of a mule. As a result, all his
tenants are prosperous, and pay their
rent promptly. The ox, he explains, Is
entirely capable in all the requirements
cf the cotton patch, but he has his lim
itations, and his colored master does
not think of mounting him and riding
off on useless errands or pleasure trips
As the negro cannot ride to distant
churches, cake-walks or "hoe-downs,"
and as he will not walk, he goes to bed
and is rested and ready for labor in
the morning. So far as the inference
from this experiment goes, the negro,
plus a mule, is a .shiftless and unrelia
ble citizen, but eliminate the mule and
substitute an ox, and he becomes reg
ular in his habits, businesslike and pros'
perou3.
An eastern exchange Enys that Rev
W. II. Burley, of Port Jarvis, N. Y., was
confronted by a most serious problem
recently. He is the owner of a cran
berry marsh, and it so happened that
his flock and his cranberry marsh need
cd his attention the same day. The flock
wanted a sermon, and the cranberries
wanted to be picked. It wouldn't do to
neglect the flock and neither would it
do to neglect the berries. Therefore,
with due regard to the relative impor-
.-'nee of each, he sent his wife to con
duct the services and preach tfle ser
mon while he went after the berries.
"Never too old to love" is the motto
of Donald B. McDonald, aged 98, of
Reno, Mich., andMarguret Ann O'Rea-
gan, aged 84, who were married recent
ly. Both of these veterans had had
plenty of experience. McDonald had
been married three times in Canada,
and is the father of 14 children. The
bride had been married twice once in
Ireland and once in New York and is
the mother of ten children. The wed
ding was performed in the presence of
great-great-grandchildren of both
bridegroom and bride.
"Clarison" is the name of a new
made-to-order language constructed
from French, Italian, Spanish and Por
tuguese. It is said to be less thin than
Italian, less guttural than Spanish and
omits the nasals of the French and
Portuguese. The author of "Clarison"
claims that it can be completely mas
tcred in two or three weeks. But the
failure of Volapuk ought to serve as a
warning. If the Latin races desire a
practical world's language they must
take up the study of English.
A New York woman has started
crusade against school-teachers who
dally with the make-up box. She ar

before them every school day with
their own complexions touched up with
gaudy colors.
A Niles (Mich.) exchange reports
that Charles A. Chopin, of that town,
one of the richest men in the state,
bought land there years ago and tried
to find copper; failing, he endeavored
tor 20 year3 to sell the ground, then,
when he was CO years old, discovered
just in time that he owned what were
to become the richest iron mines in the

Really the saddest part of all the un
happy story is the death of many of the

and a great deal larger in quantity.

MINERS ARE PROSPEROUS.
km Example of the Dentals of a Pro
tective Tariff to YVork-ir-aVmen.
No better illustration of the benefi
cial effects of the Dingley tariff could
be desired than may be had by a com
parison of the financial and industrial
condition of the southeast Missouri
lead district now and two years ago.
As is generally known, lead is the leud-
ug product of this section, and the
price of this staple is a sort of barome
ter governing the price of all other
products. As the price of lead goes up
or down, the price of lubor, farm prod
ucts, etc., advance or decline.
Under the operation of the YAilson
tariff law the price of lead was steadily
hammered down until at the time of
the presidential election of 1896 it was
only worth about" 2 cents per pound.
At this price it was only the largest
and best equipped plants that, by rea
son of great output, were able to con
tinue operations without actual loss.
And even this was only made possible
by a system of economizing that, while
cutting expenses in every other direc
tion also, necessarily reduced the price
of labor to the lowest living rate, while
the amount of labor that could find em
ployment even at these reduced rates
was greatly restricted.
Lead being the basis on which every
other industry rested, and from which,
directly or indirectly, all others ob
tained the means of continuing their
existence, it naturally followed that,
owing to the small amount of money
disbursed by the lead interest, the de
mand for all other products was greatly
reduced, enterprise of every kind was
completely paralyzed, and a condition
of business stagnation that amounted
to absolute financial distress existed
in tbe lead district of southeast Mis
souri less than two years ago.
To realize the change that has been
wrought under a republican adminis
tration in the short time it has been at
the helm, one has qnly to open his eyes
and look about him. An advance of
about 30 per cent, in the price of lead
has restored wages, inspired new min
ing enterprises, giving employment to
additional labor, while the old plants
are all operating to their full capacities.
Large accessions have been made both
to the population and permanent
wealth of the district, while a feeling of
security and confidence in the sound
ness and permanence of our present
financial system pervades the whole
community.
During the past eight months there
have been more substantial improve
ments made in this place (among which
I may mention a $25,000 public school
house) than during any previous five
years in its history. Republicans do
not now have to offer arguments in
vindication of their policy, it being
only necessary to refer to their record
and point to facts already accom
plished, j
. In the meantime those who two years
ngo were near going into convulsions in
contemplation of the dire calamities
that they assured us would follow a re
publican victory are now too busy gath
ering in all they can of republican pros
perity to say a word in vindication of
their now defunct theories. St. Louis
Globe-Democrat.
A TARIFF FOR THE PEOPLE.
The Dingley Law Hub Pat Money in
tbe Pockets of Oar
Laborer.
A census of leading industries in 47
states and territories shows that under
the Dingley law there is a great in
crease in wages paid to labor. The
amount of wages for 1898 Is 44 per cent.,
or $1,004,615,272 greater than in 1895.
This comes home to all who were out
of employment or were employed at
low wages in 1895 and 1896. There was
improvement as soon as it was known
that Mr. McKinley wns elected, and
there was still greater improvement as
soon as the Dingley bill became a law
A billion dollars more went into the
pockets of workinginen in the last
year than in 1895. If the amount paid
to agricultural laborers, miners and
miscellaneous workers is added, fie la
borers of the United States will be
found to have received $2,000,000,000
more in 1898 than in 1895.
Tbe value of the home market in the
United States is 20 times the aggregate
value of all our foreign markets.' The
Dingley law gave the Americans the
ndvantage in the home market, yet at
the same time it enabled our manufn?
turers to enter foreign markets -. a
lurger extent than ever before. The
exports of merchandise from the Unit
ed States increased from $793,392,299
under the Wilson tariff in 1895 to $1
210,291.913 under the Dingley tariff in
1898." .
When President Harrison sent his
last message to congress in December,
IS92, the country was at the high-water
mark of prosperity. The national debt
had been decreased, there was a surplus
in the treasury and there was activity
in every branch of industry. Under
Cleveland and the Wilson tarjff the na
tional debt was increased, the treasury
was depleted and industries were pros
irated. Under the Dingley tariff law
the surplus in the treasury increased,
nnd when war came upon the country
the money for war expenses was ready
la spite of war we continued to send
American goods abroad nnd to receive
gold in return. The Dingley law has
increased our producing capacity, has
put more money in the pockets of our
laborers and has built up great enter
prises that have given employment to
thousands who, under the Wilson law,
were idle. What more can the Amer
ican people ask? Chicago Inter Ocean

LIES OF SILVERITES.
Tbe Panic Maker Are Asa In at Tuell
Old Trlok Their 1'lop an
the Avar.
A local democratic silverite paper
prints some cartoons representing the I
republ'n an party as disclaiming the
war at its approach and claiming it
after it was over. The falsity of such
assertions will be apparent to every
tbinkiug man. When the proposition
of war with Spain first began to be
broached the great majority of the
"peace at any price" men were sixteen
to one bad money democrats, headed by
Bryan and flanked by mugwumps. And
now a sixteen to one organ has the un
utterable effrontery to label its own
party's unpatriotic bellowings as re
publican. The value-destroying, panic-making
free silver democrats at the head of the
party never wanted to see Cuba freed,
first, last or at any time. But the young
men among the democrats, in spite of
their unpatriotic leaders, joined the
vounir republicans in insisting that
Spain should be punished for its horri
ble perfidy in destroying the Maine,
nnd that the Cubans should be rescued
from its tyrannical, robber grasp. The
whole republican party, with the presi
dent at its head, came marching rapid
ly up to this patriotic position, not only
remaining there but progressing as
events progressed.
What hove the democratic leaders
done in the meantime? At first they
pretended to support the president in
his wnr measures, because they were
afraid of the resentment of the young
democrats. But they soon saw that the
war was going to table or kill their
darling sixteen to one, panic-making
scheme, so they censed to support the
war. Since then they have been fight
ing It and its supporters and howling
for nothing but the bad money plank ol
Bryan's Chicago platform. That was
the cause of their backward flop. That
is where they stand.
This prating about a "republican
war" is ail In the talk 01 the partisan
sixteen to one democrats. Why are
they all anti-expansionists, "Col." Bry.
an at their head? Why are they mak
ing war on the presiden t ? Why are the
bad money schemers sheering at and
deriding "republican statesmanship"
r.nd offering nothing themselves but
hostility and abuse? They hated the
war from the word go, and they hntc it
now, with all its glorious results, be
cause these things only show up the
contemptible littleness of their pirati-
?nl designs upon the credits and the
prosperity of the nation. That is the
real animus of all the democratic jeal
ousy of the recent war. Chicago Trib

GOLD ENOUGH
Another Silverite Lie la Nailed lijr the
Olllelol Report from the
Mini.
The refutation of the plea of the sil-
verites that there is not enough gold to
answer the demands of the gold stand
ard for money is found in tho reports
of the production of gold throughout
me woria
The director of the mint has just pub
lished his report of the gold production
of the United States and of the world
for last year. It shows a vast increase
over 1896, just as 3890 showed an in
crease over preceding years. .
Taking the world s production, Africa
leads with something over $5S,000,000.
The United States comes next with over
$57,000,000, and Australia next with
ever $55,000,000. Russia leads European
Countries with $23,000,000. Altogether
tbe world's output of gold for 1897 was
nearly $238,000,000, which is an increase
of $35,000,000 over the output of 1890,
and more than twice as much as was
produced in 1890.
The Indications for the present year
pre that these figures will be surpassed
and that not less than $270,000,000 will
be the production for 1898.
The statistics for the United States
how that Colorado has at least sur
passed California as a gold state, her
output being $19,000,000, as against
$14,000,000 for California. South Da
kota the Black Hills region comes
next with $5,000,000, and Montana with
$4,000,000. With such a production of
gold the world over one that is a
permanent addition to the world's
wealth how futile Jt is to say that
there is not gold enough to answer the
demands of a monetary system founded
tipon it?
It may seem paradoxical to say so,
but the more gold we have the less we
will need It as money. The world's
business Is done upon paper, and nil
that is needed is a uniform standard
for the paper. That standard Is gold,
nnd we have it In abundance. Chicago
