The awful calamity occasioned by a
river changing its course and overwhelm
ing 7000 quare mile3 of densely popu

arouse the charity of benevolent people
all over the world When this country

people responded promptly and liberally

of Congress to appropriate a respectable
sum for the purpose of ameliorating the
suffering and relieving the widespread

objects is always a good investment
The twentyfifth annual report of the
Comptroller of the Currency shows that
the total number of national banks in
operation on October 31 was 3061 The
total numberof new banks formed during
the last year is 225 the total number
closed during the year is thirtythree of
whicn twentyfive went into voluntary
liquidation and eight failed The gross
increase in national bank capital during
the year amounts to 36894775 There
has been however a decrease of capital
of 6322450 The net increase of capital
for the year is therefore 30572325 On
the other hand there is a net decrease of
50495590 in the circulation represented
by bonds The people may see from this
statement how great is the security of the
national banking system That only
eight banks out of a grand total of
3061 failed is a tribute of security at
least which should be considered by those
who are discussing the banking system of
the country
THE DALLAS MEETING
The Dallas convention was called to
considervways and means to promote the
welfare of Texas people and Texas rail
roads and to advance the interests of
every section of the state Every man
who goes to that convention should labor
for the cooperation of people and rail
roads and waive all sectional and local
rivalries The watchword should be
unity and cooperative effort to secure
for the entire state low passenger rates
and a sufficient sum of money to be
equitably expended in advertising and
working up immigration and capital to
fully develop the resources peculiar to
each division of the state
CALIFORNIA TOURISTS
The necessity of immigration is well
known and the virtue of inducing tourists
to visit the state as a means of correcting
the erroneous impressions entertained
abroad is becoming more and more man
ifest daily A number of gentlemen from
Michigan and points in the northwest
who constitute a party of excursionists
to California induced towards the Pacific
slope by the low rates offered stopped
over in Eort Worth and were surprised
and delighted with what they found The
rains had contributed liberally in furnish
ing a carpet of mud to the streets and the
gloominess of the day was discouraging
but the excursionists were shrewd
enough to see through all the
untoward circumstances and discern
the attractions of fhe city and country
contiguous Many of the gentlemen
spoken to admitted that Texas was
grossly misrepresented and painfully mis
understood abroad and that if her re
sources were properly advertised and a
low tourists rate made by the railroads
that thousands of people would come
here and find eligible investments It
was indeed a pity and some of the excur
sionists regretted that their trip had not
been to Texis instead of California It
is to be hoped that Texas shall soon be
receiving carloads ef just such as those
who were the citys guests yesterday for
a brief stay
SYMPTOMS OF DECAY
The meeting of the Republican clubs in
Chickering Hall New York and their
puroose of forming a national league is
one of the strongest evidences imagina
ble that the Republican party is falling
into decay and will soon be a thins of
the past The most prominent men in
the Republican party have entered heart
ily into the new departure and while
they protest that It is not an abandon
ment of Republican principles but a fur
therance of them and while the old is
sues are the same or nearly similar it
cannot be denied that the necessity for
these clubs springs from a lack of faith in
the old organization and that the clubs
themselves are each crystalized protests
against the Republican party The idea
of a national party professing to espouse
the principles and act as an auxiliary to
another national party already thorough
ly organized is too absurd It
is the policy of the oriental chan
cellor who finding the tax on hands
greater than the people could pay
divided the sum into ten equal parts and
made it a tax upon fingers and thumbs
n the hope that its payment would be
simplified and rendered easy There are
only a certain number of voters who will
vote the Republican ticket Dividing
these into two national parties cannot
increase their number Just now there

will be the easiest and simplest thing in

RENDER UNTO CAESAR
The value ofjncwapapers as factors in de
veloping Btates and sections is forcibly Illus
trated by the results obtained by the Fort
Worth Gazette in regard 10 immigration to
this state The Gazette took hold of a ques
tion that had lain dormant for years and In a
short time aroused the great stste of Texas to
action The result Is ihat a meeting will be
held at Dallas on the 20th to organize a state
Immigration society and the probability is that
nearly every county In the state will be repre
sented The good that may result to the state
by this organ i ration is not a matter of specula
tion but too boundless to attempt an enumera
tion Tbe Gazette Is solely responsible for
the move and to it should the honor be given
Ilillsboro Mirror
While The Gazette is duly grateful
for all appreciation of any of its efforts in
behalf of Texas simple justice to another
demands an explanation of the origin of
the agitation that has so aroused the
whole state of Texas now that this paper
is ihus publicly accorded the sole credit
When the contemplated formation of a
Texas pool was announced in 1885 Mr
John Howard then agent of the Bee
Line wrote to The Gazette predicting
the effect of such pool ontTexas immigra
tion The Gazette printed Mr How
ards letters and editorially besought the
roads not to quarantine Texas by the
destruction of competition Mr Howard
sought in that year to interest certain
other newspapers in the agitation but
failed The effort in 1885 fell stillborn
Mr Howard and The Gazette failed to
impress and arouse the people and short
ly afterwards he left the Bee Line and
entered the service of the Mobile and
Ohio but never ceased to urge the need
of some action by the people of Texas
During the past month the editor of
The Gazette was m correspondence
with an eastern gentleman who contem
plated a visit to Texas and who inquired
if there were not return tickets to Texas
sold in eastern points as well as to Cali
fornia The Gazette editor referred the
inquiry to a Eort Worth ticket agent
who said such tickets were sold in the
east and the eastern gentleman was so
informed He however replied by en
closing a note to himself from a ticket
agent in Bbston saying that no return
tickets were sold to Texas and that
the rate to Eort Worth was
something over 40 The day after the
receipt of this letter Mr Howard was in
The Gazette sanctum during one of his
periodical visits to the state and was in
terrogated as to excursion tourists and
other round trip tickets to Texas from
outside points and the result of this in
quiry was an editorial in The Gazette
calling public attention to the discrimi
nation in favor of California The people
were impressed because they had been
watching for months not only the Cali
fornia craze but the depletion of Texas
by Texas railroads with no corresponding
inducement by the roads In behalf of
Texas
The movement has now attained state
proportions and no town or newspaper
or individual should seek to claim unde
served credit John Howard who has
done as much for the state as any man in
Texas according to his means has been
agitating thie question since
1885 when he and The Gazette
so signally failed to arouse the
people and while a chance correspond
ence of The Gazette led to the inquiry
concerning round trip tickets John How
ard is really entitled to all the credit for the
agitation that now promises to result in
great good to the whole state Dallas is
to be highly commended for its quick
perception of the popular pulse and for
its practical and energetic response to the
agitation so long persisted in by John
Howard and at this time received
through a chance correspondence of The
Gazette
The result of the Dallas meeting is of
far more importance to the state than the
origin of the agitation that led up to it
and mention is made of the latter only
becsuse The Gazette is indisposed to
remain silent when accredited with praise
due to another

A Visit to Caddo Poak
Joshua Tex Dec 15 1837
To the Editor of the Gazette
Sir Having traveled on every railroad
out of your city and not being able to get
out of sight of the majestic Caddo Peak
I determined to stop over at the nearest
depot which is Joshua twenty miles
south of your city and visit this great
natural observatory It is two miles
south of Joshua on the edge of the tim
termed a truncated cone of beautiful
shape It i3 a half mile in circumference
at its base and at its top or
apex 100 yards in circumference
300 feet high and as nice as if
tnrown up by man Erom this grand out
look we can trace the Brazos river four
hundred miles in its meanderings tne
great network of railroads rivers creeks
etc for hundreds of miles in every di
rection Moreover all farms houses
towns and cities including two of the
largest Fort Worth and Dallas are in
view as far as our vision aided by tele
scopes can rescb for there is nothing to
obstruct vision unless it be the curvature
of the earth While taking these views
for at least two hours our mind ran back
to the Mammoth Cave Niagara Falls the
Lookout mountain Stone mountain and
other natural curiosities but came to the
conclusion that I was standing on a
greater curiosity than any of them and if
properly improved would bring people
from all quarters A fortune lays idle for
the want of enterprise or capital we
know not which Let our Eort Worth

San Antonio and Hir Jury
Dextox Tex Dec 101SS7
To the Editor of the Gazette
Yesterdays Gazette told of Attorney
General Hoggs visit to San Antonio to
see that the law was enforced etc and
that he said it is folly for juries to pass
upon the constitutionality of the law etc
Your correspondent i3 very much sur
prised at AttorneyGeneral Hogg In the
light of the Nineteenth century and the
decision of the jury in Justice court of
San Antonio it would be well for him to
appeal the drummer case to that high
tribunal and have Judge Sabins opinion
reversed
We are sure that if the attorneys for
Mugler in the Kansas prohibition case
knew of this superior court that they
would appeal from the United States Su
preme court and have its decision re
versed and Mugler could then make the
Kansas treasury howl
We understand that San Antonio wool
growers are kicking against the message
of President Cleveland and that they
would support the Republican nominee
etc Now Mr Editor this places the
Democratic party in a serious position
and we think that a session of the nation
al Democratic committee should be called
at once and have the matter of the Demo
cratic nominee referred to this self same
justice Jury so that like Davy Crockett
we may be sure that we are right and then
go ahead The eyes of the nation are on
San Antonio and this justice jury and
will watch with interest further develop

reason for cultivating these offensive and
worthless weeds
Mr3 Goodley replied after carefully
removing the perspiration which the
prospect of labor had caused to bead her
husbands brow I keep them for
tramps Eor tramps interrupted the
husband The tramps youve fed dur

the grass from the streots of Dallas if
chey hid been put to work and upon my
word Mrs Goodley the more you ban
quet them the more weeds we have
and 1

grnb up but merely to determine
