TAFT DECIDES
TO PUT END TO
RUSSIAN PACT
President Will Notify Senate
and Ask for Approval
of Action
Executive Decree Believed Suf=
ficient Without Any Action
by Congress
Message to Dwell on Necessity
of Maintaining Friendly
Relations
[Special Dispatch to The Call]
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.-_p r e s i-j
dent Taft will tomorrow abro
gate the treaty of !M1 be
nited States and
aa mi act of executive initiative.
He "will not await any action of con
gress, but assume that, as the primary
making power of th« govern -
be has ample authority.
A special meeting of the cabinet was
.^livened shortly before 11 o'clock to
to consider the determination
reached by the president. All the
members were present except Secreta-
Stitnson and MacVeagh.
Tlip intention of the president is to
notify Russia of the termination of the
treaty at the" expiration of one year
after January 3. Then he will inform
the senate of the step taken and re
quest approval. .
The president will goon the assump
tion that as he must negotiate; all
treaties and submit them to the senate
for ratification it is likewise within his
province to denounce a treaty and re
quest the senate to approve his action.-
The purpose involves many, new and
novel points and will precipitate much
discussion.
House to Be Eliminated
By taking the. course indicated, the
president will eliminate the house from
ail participation in : the .matter., His
action will necessitate, co-operation
only between the president/and the
senate. All neoesity for perfecting.th*>
Bulzer resolution, may be nullified by
the president's course.
The president indicated his determi
nation to take executive action to but
few senators and to no members of the ■
house. Those taken into his confidence
late tonight are divided In opinion as
to the propriety of the step. Some ex
perts on international matters declare
the president can not act alone.
President Taft. it is said, will veto
the Sulzer. resolution if it should be
forced through the senate tomorrow
without modification. Nothing that can
be construed, as an offense to Russia
will be permitted, if the president can
help it. . , .
Message to Notify Senate
According to plans announced to
night, Taft will send two communica
tions to the capitol tomorrow, one, a
message addressed to the senate to be
considered in executive session, and the
other a letter directed to Chairman
Cullum of the senate ' committee on
foreign relations. In these communi
cations Taft, it is said, will call atten
tion to the fact that international re
lations are not lightly to be dealt
with.
Senate leaders expect to hear, tomor
row that the president, through Am
bassador Guild at St. Petersburg, has
notified Russia of the impending
abrogation of the treaty. This notice
is believed to have been couched in the
politest diplomatic language and to
have stated that the American people
had come to regard the treaty as ob- j
solete. The expiration of the treaty is;
fixed for January 1, 1913.
According to information received by \
senators tonight, Taft in his communi
cation tomorrow •will, dwell on the
friendly relations that have existed be
tween the United States and Russia
and will say that, while the termina- i
tion of the treaty of 1832 seems desir
able, the friendship between the two
nations of of too long standing to be :
brushed aside lightly.
Nations' Friendly Relations
Taft, it was said, would point out j
that Russia, because of her friendship
with the United States, listened to
America's proposal of peace in the war
with Japan.
Those professing to know the presi
dent's purpose also said that he would i
call attention to the fact that the United j
States levies a head tax on every Rus
sian who enters this country and would
not for a minute entertain a suggestion !
by Russia that the right to levy the tax
was debatable. * .. ■ *•■■; .".■..,.-, v v'
In his speeches on' the .arbitration
treaties President Taft .has expressed
the view that each country has a right
to say who shall and who shall not
enter her domain.
Lively Debate Expected / ,
It was generally believed tonight that
the senate would solve the problem to-"
morrow ,by adopting a resolution of
abrogation, couched in strictly formal
language. Before ; this can be brought
about lively sessions of the foreign re
lations committees and 'the senate itself
are expected. -. " . '. , • -'"•''
President *- Taft's message, although
expected to be read in executive gession,
probably will b;made public -at once.

The accident occurred on_a south
bound car as it was starting from the
Market street crossing. The motorman
turned on too much power and the cur
rent was short circuited. A flash of
electricity set fire to the woodwork on
the car. A panic ensued. Raisin was
seated near the motorman and was
burned by the blazing woodwork.
The others who were injured jumped
from the moving car and fell to the
pavement. The motorman, Hannigan,
jumped from the. car at the first shock
of the short circuit, but recovered his
presence of mind, pursued the runaway
car. and caught and stopped it. He ex
tinguished the fire with his overcoat.
The injured were removed to the
central emergency hospital.
MOB STARTS RAID
ON DENVER OFFICE
DENVER, Dec. 17.—Colorado's state
capitol was the scene of an unusual
demonstration, participated in by more
than 10,000 persons, including women
and children, late this afternoon, and It
nearly resulted in a riot. The public
had been invited to join in a demon
stration against Mayor Robert W. S.
Speer and the council.
The climax came near the meeting's
close with the hoisting of Henry J. Ar
nold on the shoulders of several antl-
Speer enthusiasts after a speech from
the capitol steps by Arnold, who was
ousted as county assessor by Mayor
Speer ne%'eral days ago.
Arnold had declined to speak at the
demonstration, but the crowd insisted.
"I do not purpose to regain the office
to which the people elected me by
force," said Arnold, "but I shall reoc
cupy the office under the law."
"You won't have to wait for the
law," some one shouted. "We will put
you in the office where you belong,
right now."
Then the immense throng crowded in
about the ousted official in an effort to
carry him to the county courthouse, a
few blocks away. But cooler heads
soon ended the demonstration.
Arnold, pale with fright, worked his
way out of the crowd and was taken
to the governor's office. Even then, it
required no little persuasion to keep
the mob from taking possession of the
assessor's office.
Arnold was the only official not re
appolnted by Mayor Speer. under the
recent consolidation of Denver county
and city by the supreme court decision.
State Senator Hiram Hilts has posses
sion of the onice, having with the as
sistance of the Denver police ejected
Arnold at 1 o'clock Thursday morning.
Next day Arnold hung out a sign on a
private office, reading "Assessor of the
City and County of Denver." He has
filed suit to recover the office.

RHENISH PAPER
STIRS WAR BROTH
British Plot to Blow Up Wil
helmshaven Food for Con»
tinenta! Readers
COLOGNE. Dec. 17.—The Rhenish
Westphalian Zeitung publishes today
a story of the alleged discovery of a
plot on the part of Great Britain to
blow up Wilhelmshaven.
The Zeitung professes to have re
ceived its information from one of the
best informed officials, who said that
the postal authorities, becoming suspi
cious of repeated money orders in fa
vor of deck officers and chief mates,
finally seized some of the letters. These
showed that the plans to the entrance
to Wilhelmshaven war harbor, as well
as plans of the water supply and the
contents of the secret code book had
been betrayed to the British admiralty.
The paper points out that with such
; information at its command. Great
Britain could blow up the entrances to
the war harbor at the decisive moment,
rendering the harbor utterly useless
and Germany, at the very beginning of
war, helpless to defend herself at sea.
To prevent the threatened danger,
the Zeitung continues, a German squad
ron remained for weeks on patrol duty.
Recent conferences between the em
peror, the minister of marine, the chief
of the aJmiralty staff and the chief
of the marine department dealt with
this danger.
Regarded as Romance
LONDON. Dec. 17.—The story that th«
British admiralty has seized plans of
the locks and water sxipply and the se
cret signal codes of Wilhelmshaven
with the idea, in event of war, of blow
ing up the harbor's entrance and thus
bottling up the German fleet, is re
garded here as a mere romance. The
story is thought to have been told by
German officers to the Rhenish West
phalian Zeitung, which is strongly anti-
British and the organ of the war ma
terial trade.

MADERO ASKS DIAZ
TO RETURN HOME
Invites His Former Foe to
Spend His Remaining
Years in Mexico
[Special Dispatch to The Call]
CTTT OF MEXICO. Dec. 17.—Presi
dent Francisco Madero has invited
former President Porflrio Diaz to re
turn to Mexico, his home country, to
spend the remaining years of his life.
General Diaz is in Spain, where lie has
been spending the winter.
It has been known at Chapultepec
for more than a month that Diaz was
presenting a pathetic figure in his aim
less wanderings in self-enforced exile.
Madero was aware of this when he be
came president, and as soon as he could
put his presidential house in order he
commissioned former Provisional Pres
ident de la Barra to carry an invita
tion to the dethroned warrior to re
turn and end his days in his home
country. Through his brother, who
is a minister in Spain, the invitation
has been delivered.
Just what effect the possible return
of Diaz will have upon the present dis
turbed political situation is prob
i^matteai. The return of Diaz might
bring oh another revolution to rein
state him. Again, the-presence of Diaa
might tend to pacify the country If he
should offer his assistance to the Ma
dero government. Neither contingency
is more than possible. If Diaz returns
it will be as a broken hearted old man
coming home to die among his people.
A conspiracy to assassinate Presi
dent Madpjjo and proclaim a provisional
presidency pending the coming of' Ge
neral Reyes to the capital to assume the
office of president, has bee. n frustrated
at the last moment, in the opinion of
the authorities, by the arrest today of
Generals Higlnio "Aguilar and Meliton
Hurtado of the federal army, and of
a score of cocohspirators. Madero was
to have been shot from the balcony of
a hotel as he rode from Chapuletec to
morrow. During the confusion the
conspirators were to kill or seize the
ministers and take possession of the
pa lace in the name of Reyes. Hurtado,
said to have been slated for the pro
visional vice presidency, was at one
time chief of police under President
Diaz.
Indian Tribe Starving
JUAREZ, Me*., Dec. 17.—The condi
tion of the Tamahuara Indians located
in the mountains west of the.city of
Chihuahua is said to be deplorable.
As a result of the revolution these
Indians, who were activein the revolu
tionary cause, made no crops and are
on the verge of actual starvation. They
also are suffering severely from the
rigors of winter.
A delegation of 3dO of the tribe is
in the city of Chihuahua making a sec
ond appeal to the governor for imme
diate aid. Unless it given soon it is
feared many of the tribe will perish.
The governor has promised assistance.
SHIP'S SALVATION
WILL COST LIFE
Intrepid Engineer Is Fatally
Scalded in Stopping Power
After Explosion
SEATTLE, Dec. 18.—Chief Engineer
Andrew Reed of the Pacific Coast
! Steamship company's steamer City of
Puebla was so badly scalded that he
is not expected to live when he rushed
iutr> the engine room of the vessel to
(shut off the power following the burst
ing of the forward cylinder heud when
the steamer was off Partridge point,
near Port Townsend, early today.
Distress calls were sent out and the
<'ity of I'ueMa was picked up by tugs
and towed to Seattle, where it will be
laid up for repairs.
The engine was completely wrecked,
and officers of the steamship company
say it will take at least 30 days to
effect repairs^
Cylinder Blows Up
There were no passengers aboard
the City of Puebla, which was bound
to Vancouver from Seattle to pick up
cargo for San Francisco. When off
Partridge point the cylinder head blew
out with a force that shook the whole
ship. Many of the crew, thinking the
vessel had struck a rock, rushed to the
boats and made ready to cast away.
Chief Engineer Reed, who was asleep
in his cabin, was thrown out of his
berth by the shock. He realized imme
diately the danger of the situation, and
without waiting to put on his clothing,
rushed down into the engine room,
which was filled with steam pouring
from the broken cylinder.
He reached the valve and shut off
the steam and then staggered up on to
the «leek where his wounds were
dressed. As soon as the vessel was
towed to Seattle he was removed to a
hospital, where his condition is said to
be critical.
Calls for Help Sent
"S. O. S." calls were sent out by the
wireless operator and were picked up
by the Canadian government station at
Vancouver, which relayed them to the
steamship offices in Seattle, whence the
tugs were sent to tow the disabled
steamer to this port.
Examination of the engine showed
that a piece of steel two inches thick
and containing a surface area of 16
square feet was blown out of the cyl
inder. This missile struck the forward
bulkhead with such force that the bulk
head buckled and broke fixtures on the
other side. Parts of the gridiron gal
leries in the engine room were also
broken and the asbestos jacket around
the cylinder was torn to. pieces, as
bestos being spattered over the walls
of the engine room like whitewash.
Skylights were broken and a five foot
mirror in the saloon was shattered.

[Special Cable to The Call]
LONDON, Dec. 17;— Alfred
Gwynne Vandcrbilt * and Mrs.
Hollis McKim,formerly Miss
Margaret Emerson of Balti
more, were quietly married at Reigata
this .afternoon. Following the cere
mony, the bans :of which were an*
nounccd in the usual manner, the.
couple; departed on a motor wedding
trip, keeping their destination secret.
The couple were married by license
in the office of the district registrar at
Reigate. Mrs. McKim's age is given
on the certificate as 27. :
: Vanderbilt gave his address as Glou
cester house. Park lane, and was de
scribed as being of "independent
means, the con of Cornelius .Vanderbilt,
president of .railways, deceased." !
.The party returned to Belchworth for
the.wedding breakfast and then went
'to London for a reception. ,
; The parties to the wed. had) to
arrange for special permission to have
the ceremony take place on Sunday. *
Surprise Discounted
• NEW YORK, December 17.*— The an
nouncement-; today from ■ London-that"
Alfred Gwynn* , Vandortiilt and Mrs.
Hollis lfcKlm were married this after
noon at Reigate does not come as a
surprise, for, while each . has already
'weathered the stormy matrimonial ? sea
through a long series of divorce court
sensations^ the names- of the couple
have been linked for several" years. Al
fred Vanderbile, as the chief heir of
Cornelius yanderbilt's millions, is cred
ited with being one of : the richest of
the younger set of millionaires. His
marriage; to Miss . Ellen * French in ; Jan
uary, 1907,: proved a transient flight to
ward wedded happiness, .ending: May
25 of the next year, when his wife was
granted interlocutory decree of di
vorce. • , . ~ ' ivsjifo?;
Mr?. Vanderhilt secured the custody
of their son, William Harry Vanderbilt.
When the decree was made final it was
said that Mrs. Vanderbilt received as
a settlement $1,500,000.
Tragedy Comes
Following the divorce case came a
tragedy that shocked prominent so
ciety and official circles in this coun
try and England. Mrs. Mac Ruiz, the
divorced wife of Antonio Ruiz, a for
mer member of the Cuban legation at
Washington, and whose name was men
tioned in the Vanderbilt divorce suit,
committed suicide in London, May 6.
1909. The manner of her death was
suppressed for a considerable time.
Mrs. Vanderbilt No. 2 was Miss Mar
garet Emerson, daughter of Isaac E.
Emerson of Baltimore. She married,
Dr. Smith Hollis McKim of this city,
and after what she termed six years
of daily misery, in which she claimed
she was beaten, abused and vilified,
she secured a divorce in Reno, August
13, 1910, on the ground of cruelty and
failure to provide.
While she was a member of the Reno
colony and after her decree was grantedi'
she was the central figure in many a
romantic adventure, from a bear hunt
in Nevada to a picturesque steamer
farewell at San Francisco, when she
pressed a red rw to her lips and
waved goodby to Ray Rak^r as thq
ship, bound for the orient, left him
standing on the dork.
Abuse Is Charged
