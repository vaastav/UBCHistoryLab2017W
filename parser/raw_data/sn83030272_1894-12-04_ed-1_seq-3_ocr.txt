when tho Orand Jury was called and every
thing appeared ready for business when Justice
Ingrahatn brought matters tn a stop by dismiss

liEmKMKX or TII Jtiiv I tiave thought
It lieccsory to direct that n lanai Jury be sum
moned to attend thl Court of Ocr and Ter
miner contrary lo the usual custom tus I con
slder that under the present circumstances It
may be ncccs ary to mk you to luvcitlgate
charge against certain public nfficlals In the
tty of New York After thl direction wa
given certain public citizen In whom In late
events the people have shown great confidence
requested the Attnrneytieneral tn appoint a
deputy lo conduct the proceedings before you
In that request the District Attorney concurred
Upon my attention being called lo that fact
I deemed It my duty to apply to the Oovernorto
make such designation considering under the
circumstance that to mlle the Investigation
that I to ask tn undertake all
propose you at Al ex
haustive some Independent public official
ehould conduct It So far as I know that ap
plication has not been granted To my request
I have received no answer
Under the circumstance upon full consid
eration I have cOle tn Ihe conclusion that
without the assistance of this At torn General I
the investigation I was shout to propose to you
that on should undertake could 1011 be l succev
ful anlll I have therefore conic tn the conclu
Ion that It will not b necessry or will not
b necessary for the public Interest that any
such investigatIon 0 commeni cd until some ar
rangement is made and the AltorneyUeneral
is here present
I think therefore I shall say to yon thnt Ii
will not require your attendance until the first
Monday In January by which time I hope ar
rangement will b mad so that the Attorney
Oeneral may be here present and assist us in
the Investigation ThIs I asIc you to under
stand la I leaving the responsibility for any fall
lire of justice lu contfiiueiice of delay If failure
there b with thneevvhn had the power tnmako
the necessary arrangements and though re
quested have refti > cd to execute that power
