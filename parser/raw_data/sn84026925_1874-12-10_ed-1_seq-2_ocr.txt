The small-pox is rapidly spreading in

Notwithstanding ail that ha3 beeu said
and written against it, the use of horse and
inule flesh for food is rapidly spreading in
Paris, it being the chief diet of the poor, who
can't afford to pay the high prices demanded

To show how love levels all inequalities
of station, Paris records a recent wedding
wherein the bridegroom was three feet four
inches in height, and the bride six feet and a

as a "marriage of convenience."
The balance of trade seems to be a

Jennie June's last New York letter
contains an abundance of seasonable gossip
from the Metropolis. Business is brightening
under the.influence of Thanksgiving and
the approach of the holidays, and in a solid
and substantial direction. Leading jewelers
and silversmiths declare that there has rarely
been such a demand for fine jewelry and solid
silverware as now. Diamonds, especially,
can hardly be obtained in sufficient quantities.
Six years ago the cultivation of tobacco
in North Carolina was confined to a few counties
ou her northern border, but since that
time the area of cultivation has extended
rapidly, and now embraces a large portion of
the State, the crop having become a leading
industry. That the soil and climate of a part
of the State furnish the natural requisites for
the production of tobacco is evidenced in the
fact that the crop grown there is unsurpassed
for manufacturing purposes.
It has been estimated that of 12,000,000
women in America, 11,000,000 wear calico
dressess, more or less; that the spirit of
economy, has during the past year, induced
them to forego ODe dress a piece from their usual
outlay ; that the average calico dress contains
eleven yards, and that consequently there has
Koon o lr>aa tn ftio froda hv t.hia retrenchment
oj 121,000,000 yards. This is nearly the entire
product of all the mills of Massachusetts
for a year.
The representatives of the United
States to the two principal countries inhabited
and governed entirely by the colored race,
are themselves colored men, and both these
colored diplomatists are at present sojourning
in this couutry on leave of absence from
their posts. They are Ebenezer D. Bassett,
a former resident of Philadelphia, who |
has been minister resident and consul general
to Hayti since 1869, and James Milton
Turner, of St. Louis, who has been
minister resident and consul general to Liberia
since February, 1871. Mr. Turner has
had quite a checkered career, having been a j
slave in St. Louis county, Mo., before the !
war.
Decidedly the finest turnouts in Washington,
says a corespondent, are those of President
Grant and Postmaster-General Jewell, i
The former consists of four blooded bay horses,
which are generally driven to a landaulet, the
harness being silver-mounted, and their appearance
on the street always attracts considerable
attention, from the fact they are
always driven in fine, masterly style, and are i
so beautifully matched. The turnout of Post- j
master-General Jewell is generally considered
by connoiseurs to be the finest in the city.

A dispatch from Memphis, dated De-j
oeraber 2, says : "The Cotton Exchange crop |
report for November was issued this morning
and gives the following summary derived from ;
one hundred and seven responses from West
Tennessee, North Mississippi and Arkansas,
north of the Arkansas river. Sixty-four
report damages by frost at three and a half
per cent.; due exertions are being made to
save the crop. The average at the closing of,
the cotton picking season last year was Jauu-1
ary 14; this year it will close about Decern-1
ber 7. The crop is being marketed unprecedeutedly
fast. The corn crop of this district
is about thirty-two per cent, short of the average
of the past two seasons. The aggregate j
of responses does not indicate any change in
the morale of the laborers. The prospect is j
that the entire crop will be saved in a better ,
condition than ever known. The committee
are of the opinion that the decrease of the
cotton crop in this district from last year will
be about thirty-five per cent." j
In 1868, Mr. Snyder, a Richmond mechanic,
conceived the idea of a machine for
making horse-shoes, and made his first model
iu 1869. This machine was constructed and
put in operation at the Tredegar works less
than twelve months ago. While it performed
good work and turned out a shoe which
is rapidly becoming the most popular in
the Southern and Western market, still
the skillful inventor was not satisfied, and
aided by the Tredegar company, he has succeeded
in perfecting and putting in operation
a machine which excels anything ever invented,
and which is calculated to work a
revolution in the manufacture of shoes. The
first machine made only one shoe at a revolution,
but in the second machine the inventor
has brought to successful practice his original
design of making two shoes at one revolution,
and this machiue is now actually turning out
at one revolution, a horse shoe at one side
and a mule shoe at the other, at the rate of
sixty per minute. Nothing like this has
ever been attained before, and is in daily \
successful operation. The gifted inventor j
is a plain,^unassuming gentleman and a fine !
type of the American mechanic.
The inspector-general of the array says
in his annual report that a regulation is much !
needed indicting some punishment on soldiers
who marry without proper permission. Military
posts are sometimes overrun with the j
wives of enlisted men. It is frequently the J
case that company commanders do not know j
the number of married men in their compa- 1
nies. These women manage to get shanties j
to live in, to have fuel, to eat, and in case the j
company changes its situation, to obtaiu trans- !
portation for themselves and their effects, and ;
in the majority of cases the lumber for the J
construction of the shauties. The fuel, rations,
transportation, &c., are made in some
way out of the government. Itis well known
that it requires about as much transportation
to move four laundresses as it does to move a
whole company of men. Iu the opinion of
the inspector-general, laundresses can be dispensed
with in the army just as well as not.
A man can be detailed ou daily duty to do
the washing of the company with the same
facility as a laundress, and the results would
be equally satisfactory.

GOV. CHAMBERLAIN'S INAUGURAL.
The inaugural address of Governor Cham
0 - berlain,
which we present in this issue, will
be read with peculiar interest by all parties.
It is an able paper?concise?and terse as
the nature of the various subjects treated will
permit. The Governor frankly admits the
sins of commission and omission?mostly of
the former class?of his party in the past, and
with apparent candor and good faith suggests
measures of reform, and in some instances
points out the necessary legislation
to secure the desired results.
He say3 it is the duty of those administering
the Government to practice and enforce
economy and honesty, and the earliest and
most earnest attention should be directed to
the subject of the collection, appropriation
and disbursement of the public funds. He
admits that the valuations of property for
taxation have been unjust and oppressive,
but the total assessments have been reduced
thirty or forty millions of dollars this year,
and he says he stands ready to cooperate with
the General Assembly in auy measure calculated
to obtain a just valuation of all property
for taxation according to its true money value;
and so far as the faithful execution of the law
depends upon the officers appointed by him,
no county shall have just cause of complaint.
He urges the limitation of taxes to the actual
requirements of the Government, and
recommends the reduction of legislative expenses
to an economical limit by reducing the
leugth of the session to thirty days, which he
says can be accomplished by avoiding the
consideration of special acts that can be covered
by general laws, and also by reducing
the number of subordinate officers and at
tachcs, and cuttiug off the contingent or incidental
legislative expenses, which have been
as much as $90,000 a session, with half a
million dollars of legislative pay certificates
still unpaid. The public printing system he
declares to be incapable of defense or excuse,
aud he urges the repeal of the present system,
as well as to abolish the practice of publishing
the laws, at heavy expense, in the newspapers.
The present status of the State debt
is set forth and discussed, and he declares
that the settlement of the debt, under the Act
of the last Legislature, must be regarded as
final, so far as legislative and popular influence
can make it so. By the Act in question,
when the debt is funded according to requirement,
it will amount to only $5,740,016. The
common school system is treated at length,
and certain legislation recommended to make
it more effective.
Other matters o? general interest are discussed,
and the Governor asserts that to all
the measures of reform recommended by him
* * * ^ i rnL
he stands unalterably piecigea. xms asseveration
should be gratifying to both parties
alike, aud to all advocates of an honest, economical
government. Although Gov. Chamberlain,
as an executive officer, is powerless
by his unaided individual effort, to bring
about the reform which he urges, and which
the people so much desire, yet his fearless exposure
of past wrongs, and his earnest advocacy
of better government must have great
force with the party responsible for the past
abuses, while the opposition cannot fail to be
inspired with the hope that our long-suffering
State will yet be rid of venal officials and
corrupt legislators.
To aid Governor Chamberlain iu the con- i
summation of the recommendations of reform i
which he makes, it is the duty of all parties ;
in the State to give him their united eucour- j
agement. In doing this, no man will make j
any sacrifice of principle, nor will he thereby '
abandon his political platform?the platform j
of honesty and good government?adopted ,
alike by all the voters, though under different
leaders.

CIRCUIT COURT. h
The Fall term of the Circuit Court for York
county, his Honor, Judge Mackey, presiding, ai
and I. D. Witherspoon, Esq., acting as So- a
licitor, pro tem., commenced at 12 M., on Mon- te
day last.
In charging the graud jury, his Honor an- bi
nounced that inasmuch as the present mem- ja
bers of the jury had served for several successive
terms during the past year, he deemed cc
it unnecessary to deliver a general charge, tl
but would call their attention to one or two
matters on which they had not heretofore been a]
charged specifically. bi
First. Under recent statute, the sale of in- ai
toxicating liquors is subject to the control of V
the graud jury, whose duty it is to determine E
?'?11 K/iamoa o V\ o 11 nrrontori fn flip J,
wueuicr ur uut utcusc ouuu wgiutiuvu ?>v Ul
applicant. The Court urges that in consider- tl
ing applications, the number of licenses will 8C
be restricted by them to the lowest possible ti
number. While, under our form of govern- m
ment, the evils attending the traffic in intoxicating
liquors cannot be extirpated by law, gi
yet the sale of liquor may be limited by the ni
action of the grand jury in recommending tl
the granting of licenses. As the grand jury tl
are also empowered to fix the price that shall
be paid for'the liceuse, the Court recommends T
that it shall be put at a sura not less than two
hundred dollars. And should the price of a i:
license be fixed at a less sum than two hundred
dollars, the Court will disapprove the c
application. In the opinion of the Court, re- y*
tail dealers in spirituous liquors are respousi- to
ble, to a great extent, for the poverty in the 'jj
land, and they should be made to contribute to
to the support of the poor, whose poverty is (l,
increased by their own traffic. in
Second. The Court would urge upon the
grand jury the importance of enquiring cli
whether any combinations exist in this county J}]
to deprive any man from procuring employ- hi
ment for the allege^ reason of having exercised
his right as a citizen by voting the socalled
Radical ticket; and also whether simi- y
lar combinations exist among the laborers to t(:
refuse to work for any man for having exer- r(
cised his privilege as a voter. The Court feels P1
compelled to bring this subject to the at- r(
tention of the grand jury, because there are
newspapers within the limits of this circuit t\
urging farmers and employers to give work to ?
no men who had voted the Republican ticket, di
Such editors Jay themselves liable to indict-1 ^
ment for attempting Iq iqtinjidaf? voters. A J tl
man may refuse to employ another for various i
reasons?on account of his political opinions, | hi
i his religious views?if he has any?the cut of j ^
his garments, or any other reason of like na- ri
tine, that his fancy may dictate; but when j1,1
he says I will not employ you because you : to
voted the Republican ticket, under our laws, j tf
he becomes liable to indictment. From the J ^
character of the people of York county, the j (i
Court cannot believe any such cases will come ! 1,1
before the grand jury, yejt it is .deemed but j w
proper to charge them on that poiut. J1
Third. The Court would urge upon the 1
grand jury the importance qf considering I
, whether a change is not desirable in the pres-1 it
it mode of enforcing liens on crops. Under !
listing laws, the crop of a tenant nmy be
;ized and sold before he can have a hearing,!
le mere agreement to advance supplies being
msidered as evidence that the supplies were
Ivanced, when probably advances to the
mount claimed had not been furnished. A
lange in the law, permitting the tenant to '
old one-fourth of the crop, exempt from sale ;
ndcr liens, is greatly ueeded. The Court j
ould be pleased to have the grand jury reort
in favor of a change in the mode of enircing
liens. His Honor deemed it proper
> say, in this connection, that should any atunpt
be made to sell a crop at execution sale,
uder the existing lien laws, he should enjoin
le clerk from selling for fifteen days, in order
? give the tenant opportunity to be heard in
le premises?a privilege of which he is now
sbarred by the lien law.
Fourth. Another matter of practical inter- !
it to the people is the fact, apparent to all, I
lat the great mass of grown colored people i
in neither read nor write. Under the laws,
id from the very necessity of the case, they j
e compelled to conduct the most of their
isiness transactions under written contracts,
he educational facilities furnished by the
iate are not such as reach this class of our
mple. And perhaps one-third of their chilren,
in consequence of having to work to
irn a support, are also prevented from attendig
school, and, as a consequence, are growing
p in ignorance. The parents of these chilren
are poor, %and need their services in the
ly time, thus preventing them from attendig
the day-schools, as now provided by law.
fhile the law does not prohibit grown perms
from attending public schools, yet from
le facts stated, it is impracticable for them,
ad for many of their children, to attend
:hool in the day time ; and for these reasons
le Court would suggest the expediency of
stablishing, in each township, one or two
ight schools for males. In the judgment of
le Court, it will prove of great benefit to
pen such schools, even if a few day schools
lould be closed thereby, which danger, howver,
is not apprehended. In York county,
lere are, perhaps, 300 white voters who canot
read nor write. In Chester county the
lourt has been cognizant that there were
:hool trustees, pretending to exercise the
motions of such position, who could neither
jad nor write. One of this class attempted
) make au enumeration of the school poputtion
of his district, by visiting the families
nd cutting notches 011 a "tally-stick" to rep;sent
the number of children in each family,
his fact being made known to the Circuit
udge, the trustee was notified that he must
t once resign, or he would be committed to
til?the ofTense being that he was presuming
> discharge duties for which he was incoraetent,
on the same principle that a man uriersed
iu surgery would attempt the amputaon
of a human limb. The Court recomlends
that the graud jury consider this matsr,
and if you deem it expedient, recommend
ie measure, even if it should, for a while,
lose a few of the day schools.
At the close of his Houor's charge, Acting
ulicitor Witherspoon gave out a number of
ills to the grand jury, after which that body
(tired, and the criminal docket was taken up.
. number of cases were continued, among
lem the indictments against U. S. Deputy
[arshal Hubbard. Hubbard was bailed for
(appearance on his own recognizance.
The case of Charles Kane, Jasper Goforth
id Charles Hooey, indicted for robbery comlitted
on the person ofF. Magrath. in this
iwn, on the 9th ultimo, the particulars of
hich we published at the time, was taken up,
id ended on Monday night iu couviction of
11 the parties. Ou Tuesday they were senmeed
by the Court as follows: Kane to
iree years in the peniteutiary; Goforth to
leyear; and Hooey to six months. The
j 1 ir
VO iasi Dameu are uegiues, aim ivauc was a
ildier discharged from the garrison at this
ost only a few days before the robbery was
jmmitted.
Bill Staten, a colored boy, charged with
irceny, was found guilty aud sentenced to 24
ours' imprisonment.
Henry Coker, a negro, charged with assault
ud battery, and attempt to commit rape on
small colored girl, found guilty aud sensnced
to the penitentiary for one year.
Thomas Adams, charged with assault and
attery, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to
.il one hour.
Oliver Hill, indicted for the larceny of a
>w. Pleaded guilty and was sentenced to
je penitentiary for nine months.
On Tuesday afternoon, G. W. S. Hart, an
pplicant for license to practice in tne rroate
and Circuit Courts, was subjected to extiination
by a committee composed of W. B.
filson, W. B. Williams and C. E. Spencer,
isqrs., and after successfully passing the oraal,
was admitted to practice. Mr. Hart,
lough young in years, is a close student, and
? well did he8ustain himself oil his exarainaon
as to elicit a high and deserved coraplilent
from the bench.
The case of State vs. Nelson Clawson, a nero
indicted for the murder of a white man
imed James Pressley, near Fort Mill, on

The grand jury, before being discharged on
uesday,submitted to the Court the followiug
presentment :

EDITORIAL INKLINGS. j ?
Congress. , ti<
Congress assembled on Monday last, i CI
and there being a quorum in each house, the M
usual committees were at ooce appointed.- Si
The President's message was received and re
read. From what purports to be a summary ar
of the message, sent out by telegraph, the
document presents no striking features. The ve
Senate proceedings were devoted to District w
of Columbia affairs, and in the House a uura- cl
ber of appropriation bills for the different de- Cc
partments were reported. pi
Mixed Schools in Indiana. ov
At Indianapolis, on Wednesday of last fit
week, the chief justice of the Supreme Court so
of Indiana rendered an opinion in a case of pi
appeal that colored children are not entitled, th
by the laws of that State, to admission to the in
same school with whites. The salient points in
of the opinion of the Judge are to the effect ca
that the Legislature has provided separate ra
schools for the two races, aud this provision is ta
not in conflict with the fourteenth amendment w
to the constitution of the United States. The Y\
educatioual sections of the constitution oflndi- G
ana were not intended for persons of the African sa
race, for they expressly limit the enjoyment Y
of their provisions to citizens, and at the time sa
of the adoption of that constitution negroes \\
were neither citizens of the United States nor C
of Indiana. Upon the question whether the h<
fourteenth amendment has worked any change in
in the constitutional provisions of the State, al
the court says that the fourteenth amendment th
had not delegated to the federal government ai
power and control of the domestic institutions of
of the State, and that this view has been, in all "s
constitutional respects, sustained by the highest
judicial tribunal in the country, and the gi
one especially charged with the construction ra
and interpretation of the federal constitution, er
By the solemn decision of that high court, the h<
privileges aud. immunities belonging to citi- th
zens of the State, as such, rest for their securi- at
ty and protection where they have heretofore 01
rested?with the States themselves. In con- m
elusion, the court says : "Colored . children le
are not entitled to admission into the common bt
schools which are provided for the education th
of white children." It is stated that an ap- p(
peal in the case will be taken to the Supreme ar
Court of the United States. W'
Gen. Kershaw.on Grant. of
George Alfred Townsend, in a recent ar
letter from this State, relates the following in tr
detailing an interview he had with General th
Kershaw:
Apropos of the President, let me quote
General Kershaw on General Grant, as he cc
spoke to me a fortnight ago; Kershaw is the v(
Conservative leader in South Carolina: J'After
the conviction of the ku-klux," said Ker- ,
shaw, "I went to Long Branch, with a few
other persons, to solicit pardon for these men, m
and notably for one of them, a very old man, ui
who had really joined tne organization to le
prevent its excesses. We were apprehensive Q
of our treatment, but it was both polite and ??
presidential. I did not know that the President
was acquainted with our affairs, but
found he had a very clear idea of pretty much
everything in the State, and a knowledge of ^
details, too. Yet he had never been there, pi
Afterward I was told that this intimate knowl- tl:
edge of localities was not unusual with him. DI
TT 1 . , li! ... _ L 4
ne saiu 10 us at once, auer puuiug us ui ease,
aud giving us cigars: '-'All these men will be
pardoned, gentlemen, whose misdeeds did not cc
involve destruction of life. I cannot pardon te
these, but, in the end, they will all be pardon- H
ed. The utmost length of the confinement of tb
any will be measured by the behavior of the ft
community for which these men are hostages. jn
Now, as to the particular person you seek to .
aid, I will have his case reopened, and examined
in the light of what you tell me. But "I
there is especial complaint against him, I bi
will write to the Attorney General, telling h<
him what to do." This," said Kershaw, "I hi
was able to find afterward. Grant did to the a]
letter as he said, because Williams showed us
Grant's letter of instructions; and he also
showed the letter of complaint against our C?
man, Brown, though we could not see the signature.
The President made an impression hi
upon us all, which is not effaced, of knowledge sf
and good intentions. If there is to be a Re- a,
publican at the head of the Government he pi
would suit us better than any we know." ^
Gov. Chamberlain Interviewed.
The Columbia correspondent of the
Charleston News and Courier, under date of
the 4th instant, furnishes the subjoined re- bi
port of an interview between Gov. Chamberlain
and the committee of the State Tax si
Union: c?
"The committee appointed by the State Tax P1
TTninn consisting of Messrs. S. P. Hamilton.
Thomas Taylor, William Wallace, G. Muller
and J. W. Moore, waited upon the Governor
at noon, to-day, and presented the resolutions
adopted at the meeting of the State Union.
Col. Hamilton, on behalf of the committee, ,.
said that the Governor's inaugural had al- .1
most entirely anticipated the object of the
mission of the committee, who had nothing
left to do beyond expressing their unqualified
approval of that very able State paper. In P1
undertaking to carry out the recommendations
contained in the message, the committee
felt that they would not exceed their power
in pledging to the Governor the cordial sup- re
port of the organization they represented. cQ
Col. Hamilton closed by asking the Governor
to appoint honest and intelligent men to the q
positions of trial justices and jury commissioners,
and to recommend to the Legislature the
postponement of the payment of taxes. . '
In reply the Governor said he realized the g?
difficulties in the way of carryingoutthe recom- cj
raendations in his message, but pledged him- ^
self to do all in his power to accomplish that ^
end. As to the extension of the time for the
payment of tases, he said that Mr. Trenholm ^
and other Conservative members bad suggest- u
ed that relief could be obtained by division of ^
the taxes, making half payable in January
and half in April. He would give the mat- ^
ter his attention, and if the plan was prac- ^
tic-able he would recommend it. He promised cj
also to recommend a reduction of the State tax '
levy if he found that it could be done without
embarrassing the government. The commit- ,
tee then shook hands with the Governor and _
,, , , ea
took their leqve, we/i pieasea wnn ine nuer- .
view and with the tone of the Qovernqr'g re- "
marks.''

FROJJ CHESTER. ^
Chester, Pec. 7,1874. ai
Au organisation was recently formed at this se
place, entitled the "Merchants' Protective J di
Association of Chester." The object aimed at!
is protection against "unworthy debtors." To j ot
accomplish this object, a "black list" will be I
k.rtlio A conniafinn prmtaininor t.hfi names '
ftcpb XJJ UIIW ngouv/iuwiv/uj "Q ?? yJ
of "persona in our town and community who
are unworthy of credit, either from dishonesty,' cc
or inability to pay their debts when contract- bj
ed." This list wijl receive, from time to time,1
such additional names as the occasion (}e- ^
iqands, and will be open at all tinges to tt]e a
inspection of members, Woe be to the urn f0
worthy debtor whose name appears upon thp tli
black list. He could not obtain credit for a ri
crust of bread if his family were upon the "
brink of starvation. Some persons are of the (
opinion that there is more necessity for a com- "
bination of the people against the merchants. v(
Your correspondent does not propose to solve 1 of
this knotty question, for he does not wish | gi
incur the wrath of either party to the con-1 tf
at. He will, however, say that the merchauts
ive a perfect right to protect themselves j ^
om the "dead beats," who are continually 1
aking bills without the most remote inten* j C(
)n of paying them. The officers of the"Mer- ta
iants' Protective Association of Chester" are i ai
r. Joseph Wylie, President; Mr. J. H. tl
nith, Vice-President; Mr. J. D. Means, Sec-' ?
tary; Mr. T. N. Youngblood, Treasurer; ' ^
id Mr. Win. Stringfellow, Doorkeeper.
The beautiful Indian summer, which pre- 0j
tiled for so long a time, left us last week, ' el
hen Btern winter, with blighting frosts and I te
lilliug winds, made his appearance. Over-1 ^
iaLs were sneedilv drawn from their hiding!^
r ' ^ ~ qi
aces, and made to add to the comfort of their ?,
vners. Trade was also considerably bene- j;
;ted by the change of weather, for many per- tl
ns had made a postponement of winter w
irchases until driven to it by necessity. In d
is connection it may not be uninteresting to
form the outside world of the business done
Chester on busy days. In this way only
in a proper idea of the enterprise of our j
erchants and the trade of our town be oh- o
ined. On days when business is all aglow b
ith life and activity, the sales of Messrs.
fylie & Agurs amount to $1300; of I. L.
unhouse & Co, to $1000; of Wilson & Cou- jj
r, to $1000 ; of Gregg & Means, to $800; of ^
oungblood & McFadden, to $600. The '?
lesof Alexander, Robison & Atkinson, of n
T. H. Hardin & Co., of R. D. Galbraith & j(
o., of Massey & Co., and other firms are
;avy on busy days, and might be given with
terest did space permit; but from the figures t(
ready given, some idea can be formed of t<
ie extent of business transacted in our town, tl
id thus tend to the disabusing some raind3
1 . i-ii il
the erroneous impression that Chester is a ^
iort of one-horse place." ^
The Conservatives of this place express
- r\I U
eat sausiacuon wun uimuucnaiug iu<*u?U- n
J, and are of the opinion that our ill-gov- p
ned State has reached the lowest limit of ti
3r misfortune and misery, if the promises of ^
ie new Executive are made with sincerity
>d with the firm intention of being carried ^
it to the very letter. He will undoubtedly 0
eet with violent opposition from the corrupt e
aders and members of the Radical party ;
it if he will walk with an unerring &tep in c
ie course he has marked out, soon will the ^
>litical burdens be lifted from our shoulders,
id all will in the end be well, supremely p
ell. He will be sustained by the cordial coleration
of the Conservatives, and as they ?
e the "bone and sinew" of the State, he can ti
eat with sublime indifference and contempt P
ie opposition and enmity of the corruptionists. ^
The Senator from this county, Dublin J. q
falker, colored, has been appointed on the
imraittee on education. This is probably a 0
iry suitable appointment, as the Senator was tl
r many years the School Commissioner of si
lis county. The beams of light that will ema- 0
itefrom his brain respecting the various ^
atters appertaining to education will doubtss
shine with unspeakable effulgence. S. J. v
ouch, the white member of the Chester dele- J
ition, has received a place ou three different S
>mmittees of the House?an honor, it is said, tl
lat has not been conferred on any member of a
ie Legislature from this county during the
resent century. On what substantial basis j
lis honor lies I do not know, unless on the f{
rinciple of lucus a non lucendv. He has been G
Dpointed to the chairmanship of the military I
>mmittee, and is a member of the commites
on the judiciary and ways and means. n
[is military experience was obtained during q
ie war, when he served in the Union army in a
ie position of lieutenant in a Kentucky reg- a
aent, which gained the unenviable reputation p
7 being good plunderers, rather than good o
jhters. But it is to be hoped that as he has *
3en invested with such distinguished honors,
3 will refuse to avail himself in the future of ?
is plundering experience, and join the mighty ^

N. B. Meyers, of Beaufort, filed the protest
f the electors of Barnwell county against the

Upon the conclusion of the work of the
louse, the Seuate was announced, and tl"
?vo houses met in joint assembly-for the pin- .
ose of engaging in the inaugural ceremonies
f the newly elected Governor. We quote
om the Columbia correspondence of the
lharleston News and Courier:
"The inaugural ceremony, to-day, was one
f the most elaborate and successful affairs of
le kind which has taken place in the State
nee reconstruction. The hall of the House
f Representatives was crowded with specta)rs,
among whom were many members of the
!ar, who happened to be here in attendance
n the Supreme Court, and crowds of Conserative
citizens, United States Army officers,
udge Bryan, and the officers of the Uuited
tates Court. The mush was furnished by
le Post Band. At one o'clock, p. m., the inugural
procession entered the hall, beaded
y Whittemore, chairman of the committee
f arrangements, who walked arm in arm with
udge Wright of the Supreme Court; then
mllowed Governor-elect Chamberlain and
lovernor Moses arm in arm; after them the
/ieutenant-Governor and the Chief Justice,
illowed by the members of the State government
and the committee of arrangements,
onsisting of Messrs. George A. Trenholm,
labriel Cannon, A. Simkins, T. B. Johnston nd
Curtis, of the House of Representatives,
nd Dunn and Smalls of the Senate. The
rocession was headed by the sergeant-at-arms
f the Senate wielding the old Colonial mace,
rhich has been in the archives of the State

int personages had been seated, Lieut. Gov.
Heaves called the Joint Assembly to order,
'he Governor elect then rising and addressing
be chief justice said: "Mr. Chief Justice: I
rn now ready to take the oath of office as
rovernor of South Carolina." The oath was
ben administered, and was followed by a salvo
f artillery from the capitol grounds. Gov.
lhamberlain then delivered the inaugural
ddress.
The message was delivered in Mr. Chambertin's
usual calm and unimpassioned style,
ut at times he warmed up, and the delivery
light fairly be termed eloquent. It occupied
bout one hour and a half in delivery, but
>as At.tent.ivelv listened to end frennentlv An.
lauded. The members of the Legislature
pplauded especially when he touched upon
le subject of making county treasurers, counj
auditors and justices of the peace elective,
nd when he recommended the adjournment
f the Legislature before Christmas. When
e referred to the abuse of the pardoning
ower, there was prolonged applause, and also
hen he promised to appoint competent perms
to office. ,
The general sentiment here is that the inugural
promises all the Conservatives could
sk, and that if the Legislature carries out its
commendations, better days are in store for
outh Carolina. The Conservative and Inependent
members are much pleased with its
atesmanlike tone, and begin to entertain
opes of a real reform of existing evils."

lem that the Senate, if it desired to carry out
ie recommendations of the Governor as to a

fter considerable debate the resolution was
st by a vote of 17 ayes to 12 nays?the
