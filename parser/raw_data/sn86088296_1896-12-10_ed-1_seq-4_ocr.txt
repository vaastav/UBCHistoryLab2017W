THE CHANGE IN FINANCE AND
COMMERCE.
W have ru deair whatever '"to rob
ia" th result of the laat presidential
electifta to inflame the tender cnticl of
the defeated, aa w have been onjuatly
acenaed by . hypercritical friead; bat
there U an object Iesaon that we in
deaire to call attention to ia that con
nection. It ia a well known fact that
jnat before the election money ia New
York ran cp ia interest t 100 per cent.
It waa the very icarcest thin fa that
ireat center of wealth. The New York
Ura!4, in a late edition, ondr :he head
of "New York'a Position ia . Flnaaee,
telU the atory of the rapid chinge ia
condition ia regard to money and trade
in that city, brooght aboat by the re
sult of the presidentia! eJectioa. The
Herald aay ia anbatance that heretofore
the accumolatol capital in Earope and
the scarcity of ita oatleta ha be-o ctn
traated with the plentitade of er.ter-pri.i-
in thia country and the scarcity
of capital, and, aa a result, higher rates
of interest prevailed in this country and
w w.re frrower from th-ir store.
But rxow alrnct a if by m.iie, the
Herald say, we have a g'at of mo.iey
in thi. rr,nntry, with lower rates of
inurest than in Europe, and the uaik--r
and capitalist of the old world are now
borrowing from us. The estimate of
the treasury department. Issued on the
3rd of Decern Urr, makes the net in
crease of money in this country, outside
of government holding for the past
month, nearly I2J,VjO,00O, and the in
crease from August 1. $131M.00w.
This enormous gain comes from the im
ports of gold, the output of oar mines,
the increase of bank note circulation and
the expenditures of the treasury oT'-r
the amount it ha collected. That is
not all. This vast amount of hoarded
money keep coming, which strengthen
our financial position and make us
lenders rather than borrowers. This ia
due to the richness of oar mineral re
source, the fetility of our fields and tne
skill and enterprise of our people.
The Herald aiao makes quite as
favorable a showing for our foreign
trade. In the last ten months we have
sold the rest of the world $240,000,000
worth of commodities more than we have
purchased. We had been until lately
living beyond our means and conse
quently ran heavily in debt to the rest
of the world and were hard put to pay it.
But while our expenditures have been
materially reduced, our exports have
been enormously increased, and in the
last ten months we have decreased our
imports $100,000,000 compared with the
same months the year previous.
This is a happy condition of affairs
naturally felt first by our great money
center, New York City, and it only re
quires a short time for every part of
this country to fee! its stimulating ef
fects. The hard times, it would aeem
from this, have done us good after all
our complaints, changing us from a
nation of borrower to a nation of
lenders, changing us from xpetiding
more than our income to largely in
creasing our income over our expendi
tures, changing the balance of trade that
wa against us to largely in our favor,
and, we trust, teaching us lessons by
which we will continue to be lenders
rather thau borrowers, and with our ex
ports always exceeding our imports. It
is the inauguration of a general pros
perity that will be felt to the mot re
mote border of our country.
MR. CLEVELAND'S MESSAGE.
Mr. Cleveland' message is one of the
ablest state paper that has ever emanat
ed from the White House. His treatment
of the Cuban question is especially felic
itous, exhibiting a diplomacy nnd consid
eration of his peculiar position worthy of
a philanthropist and a statesman. It is
very evident from his treatment of this
subject that he recognizes that while his
administration is about to expire, that it
would be an infringement of courtesy to
Mr. McKinloy for him to recommend to
congress any positive policy in regard to
Cuba, that if adopted by congress would
have to either abandoned or carried
out bv the incomini! administration. But
if that part of his message is attentively
read, he really draw n strong picture of
the existence of affairs in Cuba, which he
afterwards premises if they should later
exist it would liecome incumbent on this
government to take some positive action
in the premises. It is obvious from this
that if Mr. Cleveland wa in tho middle
of his term or at any other period in it
but I'. closing day that he would have
recommended immediate action upon me
grounds he so clearly et forth in his
message. While in obedience to interna
tional, law he can not declare that Cuba
is entitled to recognition, ho emphasizes
Uie fact that the interest of this coun
try in tho Island is second only to that of
Spain, estimating that Americans have
invested in CuU from $.'10,000,000 to
$40,000,000 with a trade interest of near
ly $100,000,000 annually, and in hi post
tion, with his hands ti-d by courtesy to
Mr. McKinley's administration, he pro
poses that the United States should urge
upon Spain the granting of national nu
touoniy, which lie must Is? well aware
both Spain and the Cuban patriot would
reject; but that ho know would lead to
further interference by this government
which ho wisely loaves to Mr. McKinley'i
administration. .Mr. Cleveland lias xvcn
much more space in his message to this
than any other subject, showing that h
fully appreciates its importance, and the
necessity fur some immediate action by
this government.
The Cuban question is also more vigor
ously presented by the secretary of state
in n paper which was submitted with the
president's message to congress. Mr,
Olnoy could go further than Mr. Clove
land, and while lie ha been careful to
observe tho courtesy duo the next ad
ministration, he has colored the picture
more deeply than Mr. Clcvclund did, and
ho makes the ground for the immediate
inauguration of sorie policy on our part
towards Cuba luore imperative. It i

gation he is under". to the- iacomiag ad
ministration. Wet ir not for this
partiwanship thy wonid feel exceedingly
encouraged by the mesrfase, and if thy
were not too blind to rad between the
lines they would that it i very favor
able to the Cuban patriot. The mesaa?
went farther ia behalf of some action
toward Cuba than we expected, but Mr.
Cleveland' superior sagacity mapped
out a wiy for him that we did not anrio
jpaf.i x way by which he might avoid
the iafringemeot upon internatiooal obli
gations, and also avoid trespassing np-'.a
the next administration. Hi message ia
this respect was most admirably and ia
genuoualy constructed and worthy of the
careful atatesmaaship he has always
demonstrated.
We congratulate the democratic party
on the splendid record of a democratic
president. Not only on this question, tat
upon finance, upon the Venezuelan enc
broglio and upon civil service ha Mr.
CieveUnd shown that he was master of
all the intricate question he has handled.
The democratic party will always be
proud of the administration of Grover
Cleveland.

DEFENDS HIS DEAD BROTHER.
Senator Hour Corrects a Misstatement
for Many Years Circulating.
Worcester. Mass.. Dec. . Scmitoi
Hour has written u letter defending hi
brother, tho Into E. Hoar, attorney
general in the Grant cabinet, from at
tacks made during the recent presiden
tial campaign.
Mr. Hour says in explanation of the
otter:
"About a fortnight before the election
when on my way to a dinner of the Nor
folk club. I read in a morning pa nor that
Mr. Fairchild, formerly secretary of the
TfTF PS DAY. DECEMBER 10.
treanry. had repeated ia a speech before
the Reform r!ub. the statement, often
contradicted, that the supreme court ot
the United States had been pack-i t
rersK. the decision ia Hepburn vs. n.s
wohi. ia which the court held the legal
tender act wa unconstitutional. At the
dinner a few hours later. I criticised this
statement a being a vile a Blander as
ever wa uttered pn the stump. I dou t
suppose that Mr. Fairchild wa aware
of the falsehood of the charge that he
endorsed. He only made the too com
mon miatake- of adopting without inves
tigation aa error which had become cur
rent ia regard to the ease."
After quoting liberally from the rec
orda, Senator Hoar makes pablie two let
ter just received from two of the mem
ber of the cabinet of President.firant.
Say Senator Hoar ia this connection:
-I . have received a letter from Gov
ernor Cox. who waa then secretary f
the interior ia Grant's cabinet. He
dwelt ia the am hoae with Attorney
General Hoar during the aummer until
the meeting of congress on December 1.
l.h, and was the judge' intimate friend.
He would have known of thia matter
if it had been known, both a a member
of the cabinet and from hi .familiarity
with Judge Hoar.
" Governor Cox says in part: T would
say that I have alway regarded the
charge that the supreme court was
packed to reverse the legal tender deds
ion in Hepburn vs. Griswold as one of
the most curious instances of declaring
an unwarranted conclusion from a mere
coincidence. When I orisinaily heard
the assertions made I carefully reflected
to see- whether I could recall any fact
that sustained ir. I could not. Every
incident pertaining to the appointment of
judges to fill the . vacancies wa. so far
as my recollection coma reacn. exacti?
what high-minded men would wish and
exactly what all who knew Judge Hoar
would expect from an attorney eeneral
having his high ideas of public duty."

THE FIRST BATTLE."
the Title of Bryan's Book His
cuse for Writing It.
Ex-
Lincoln. Neb.. Dec. 5. A representa
tive of the Associated Press learned to-
ay that the title of illiam Jennings
Bryan' book ia to be "The First Bat
tle." In the preface he states his reasons
or wntiag the toon in tne following
words:
The campaign of I'sao was a remark
able one, whether we measure it by the
magnitude of the l.-eues involved or by
the death of interest aroused. I have
been led to undertake the work by a de
sire, felt by myself and expressed by
thers. to have th more important inci
dents of the campaign put into perma
nent form for the convenience of those
who have taken part in the contest and
or the use of thoe who shall hereafter
desire to review the struggle. The
amount of work done by the advocate
f free coinage is beyond computation.
and the number of those who took an
active part in the contest too great for
numeration. 1 hese tacts, togetaer
with the difficulty of chosing between
so many meritorious speeches, have
compelled me to limit the quotations to
the addresses made and papers issued
by persons standing in an official or
semi-official capacity, and to the princi
pal speeches delivered by myself. I
have added a brief history of the cam
paign, including a discussion of the elec
tion returns and the significance thereof.
It has also been thought best to narrate
the part taken by me in the question of
silver previous to the convention, and at
the request of the publishers I have in
cluded a biographical sketch written by
Mrs. Isryan.
It is understood here that the publish
ers will he Conkey & Co. of t. nicago,
who will issue the book early in January.

WHERE CIVILIZATION REIGNS.
How the Effete East Condones the
- . Sport of Prize Fighting.
There is no one form of sport in the
world which provokes such spectacular
displays of hypocrisy as prize fighting.
It is possible to pull off a mill between
two obscure plugs in almost any city in
tho Union. Righteous indignation sits
quietly in the chimney corner and makes
no sign. Hardly a dav passes that a
prize light does not take place some
where within tho United Stntes, but let it
be announced thnt two of the stars of
tho ring are to fight for the champion
ship, then all the Pharisees emerge from
their lairs, strike attitudes on the street
corners and denounce the brutal iort
of prize lighting. Righteous indig.iti
tioh deserts the fireside, procures a bugle
and makes itself seen nnd heard. Es
pecially is there a furor in the land when
it is announced that ono of these events
is to be pulled off in the south. Then
tho stern moralists of tho eastern press
print solemn editorials on tho lack of
civilization in the south, where Mich
things are tolerated, and the next day
wo read where Mr. l'ug knocked out
Mr. Slug in four rounds under the super
vision of the police in -Now York Citv,
nnd that Mr. I'lug was killed iy"u
knock-out blow, administered before' a
larite and enthusiastic audience in tho
refined and civilized burg ot Boston.
A few days ngo those well known
citizens, Peter Mailer nnd Joe Cliovnski,
hold a floteriul convention right in the
heart of New York City. Tho event
was well advertised in all the Now York
papers. The accommodations wore all
that could be desired, nnd a large and
speckled gathering of the elite of pugdom
was present. The police wore on hand
to prevent any exhibition of brutality on
the pnrt of the combntnnts. and wore
firmly determined that if Choynski tried
to brain Maher with an ax, or Maher en
