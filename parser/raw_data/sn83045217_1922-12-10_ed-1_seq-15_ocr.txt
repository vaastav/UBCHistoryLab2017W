New York, Dec. 9.—Wall street is
still diveded in opinion as to whether
the rise in the stock market during
the past week is merely a recovery

November, or whether it is a fresh |
advance. One thing, however, is cer
tflin and that is that the rebound is
from ihe severe break in October and !

logical and justified by reason of the
fact that the preceding decline was un
wan-anted by general business and
financial conditions, ir was due soie
]y to overspeculation last spring and.
summer, and as always happens,
when it is a case of correcting n spec
illative excess on the buyng side, the i
market went to a corresponding ex
treme on the selling side.
Railway securities have not felt any- j
thing like the impulse toward improve
inent that other sections of the mar-!
ket have experience,!. The reason lies
readily at hand. The investing pub- ;
juvromif, f uu I
lie is constantly being reminded that
there is a serious state of affairs in
the railway world. There is no ques
t ion of bankruptcy or even of reduc
tion in dividends. But the roads as
shown in the October figures, have
been called upon to spend a lot more
money than usual on maintenance of
plant and equipment.
The suggestion that these expedi
tures will continue for an indefinite
length of time is strengthened by the
statement frequently made before, and
repeated this week by the secretary
re low on
stributing
(he main reason why prices are
ihe farms and high at the di
centers.
Legislation Remote
President Harding in his message
recommended encouragement of rail
way combinatons and the pooling of
freight cars as a partial soluton of the
problem. Unfortunately, there is lit
tle or no chance of any remedial legis
lation at the present session of con
gress, and the next session the bal
ance of power if not the actual con
trol, will rest in the hands of the rad-j
ical bloc which is committed to a:
program of rate reduction regardless
of what this would entail for the fi
tiancial position of the railroads.
In the end, any downward revision
of freight rates which threatened to
bring earnings below a fair return on
capital invested probably would not
nuce charges, is not inclined to in
crease even though he is not reducing
4 ot rails.
Secretary Mellon's reference to busi
ness conditions was an inspiring
tribution to (ho markets of the week.
While there was nothing in his sum-i

The two most striking incidents of

were the continued advance in sterling

I to proposed farm credit legislation and
j to buying based on President Harding's
(message. Compared with a week ago,
I the wheat market Saturday morning
was % to cent higher, corn up a
shade to IV« and 1 cents, oats a shade
off to % cent advance, and provisions
varying from 47 cents decline to a rise
of 5 cents.
Bulls In the wheat market were at
first under a disadvantage to overcome
price setbacks due to world shipments,
the largest since 1920, and the stock
market weakness that on successive
days brought about a. decided increase
of wheat sefling. Falling off in the
United States visible supply total and
In receipts at primary points was some
help to rallying prices, and so too were
estimated that the domestic winter crop
acreage showed 10 per cent decrease
with the crop condition seven points
below the average.
It was only slightly noticeable after
bills had been introduced both in the
senate and the house at Washington
to add $18,000,000 to the government's
$12.000,000 subscription to the farm loan
system that any upward tendency In
the wheat market became at all pro
nounced. Rains interfering with the
Argentine harvest counted later as a]
bullish factor, and toward the end
the week, the buying movement to
distinctly accelerated in connection with
the president's message much more than
offsetting reports of weakness in values

. GRAIN AND PROVISIONS
Chicago, Dec. 9.—All grains took an
upward swing Saturday, wheat for May
and December deliveries advancing to
a new high for the season, as a result
of a material increase in speculative
interest induced by President Harding s
message to congress and a speech by
Julius H. Barnes before the Illinois
chamber of commerce here Friday. At
„ , si/.„
the finish wheat was up I 1 /* to ô M jc,
with May $1.20% to ^l-SO 7 '» and Jhly
$1.09% to $1.09%. Corn advanced 1%
to 1% cents, oats gaineu 1 to lVj cent,
and provisions were unchanged to i.(
cents higher. .
At the outset there was a good i.lass
of buying of wheat by commission
houses with a result of Mr.. Barnes
statement recommending the extension
of a $50,000,000 to the
t },e needy nations of turope ror tne
purpose of buying grain. This, he sata,
would greatly enhance values. Offer
ings soon were absorbed and prices
advanced radically. Bulls were further
encouraged by Washington advices, the
trend of talk in congress being in their
favor, it was said., * "Chouse" coupled

point of the day. , . .. ,, 4 „
Corn and oats showed fair activity
and scored moderate gams, with all
deliveries for oats at a new
the season, that grain showing inde
pendent strength for the first time in

Only 1.200 casks of Danish butter in

WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW
New York, Dec. 9.—The struggle for
control between opposing speculative
forces imparted a decidedly Irregular
trend to prices in this week's stock
mart. Gains of the first few days were
substantially reduced or wiped out in
the mid-week reaction, but a further
recovery set in Friday afternoon. In
dustrials continued to offer much better
resistance than rails.
Intermittent weakness of railroad
share* was caused by several factors,
not the least important of which was
the unloading by pools which had be
come discouraged by the lack of public
Interest in these securities.
Selling toç taxation purposes, uncon
ffrmed rumors regarding possible re
auction of present dividends, which
were used effectively against Great
Northern preferred, and higher fuel
prices, also were factors.
President Harding's message to con
gress, approving railroad mergers and
the pooling of equipment, was favorably
received in the financial community.

vember 25 totaled 955,495 cars, which
was described as an unprecedented
number for that season of the year.
The final summary of railroad earn
ings for 192 class one roads showed
net operating income of - $85,234,000,
which represents a return on an annual
basis of 4.05 per cent on tentative
operation figures.
The improvement in the sugar indus
try was reflected by the report o# the
Cuba Cane company for the year ended
September 30, which showed a profit
of nearly $30,000 as against a loss of
$9,716.000 last year. Declaration of a
25 per cent stock dividend by the direc
tors of the Studebaker corporation with
the additional comment that present
learnings and future prospects indicated
a continuance of the $10 dividend rate
on both the new and old stock, mirrored
the splendid condition of the automobile
industry which has just had the best
year in its history. Hudson and Hupp
motor stocks eaeh established new high
records for the year during the week.
New high records of the year were
made in the foreign exchange market
by_ demand sterling, which touched
$4.57% or within 30 cents of parity;
guilders at 39.97 cents and India rupees
at 30.35 cents. The Italian lire was
quoted above 5 cents for the first time
since June 15. Canadian exchange went
to a light discount above, holding
around par for a week.
The gigantic weekly increase of J10,
336,000,000 marks in German note cir
culation had no effect on marks, which
were still quoted around 1% cents a
hundred. French francs got above
7 cents again despite another increase
of 269.911,000 in note circulation and
300,000,000 in government borrowings.
Business in the time money and com
mercial paper markets was quiet with
no change In rates.
