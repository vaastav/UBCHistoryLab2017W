Chief Justice Chase yesterday delivered tlie
opinion of tho supreme court in the case of the
Veaeie Bank vs. Jeremiah Fenna, Collector of inter
nal Revenue, to recover tho tax of ten per cent
npon its circulation imposed by the act of
July, lsw. The \eazve Bank, chartered by
the Maine Legislature, held the act to be
unconstitutional because It was in the nature of ft
direct tax, and interfered with rights vested In the
bank by its charter. The Court affirmed the consti
tutionality or the law, grounding it? opinion on the
article in the constitution enabling government to
lay and oollect taxes and provide for the deience
and general welfare of the United states. The tax was
not a direct tax, but was in the same class as taxes
on insurance companies, which has already been de
elded not to be direct taxea. The decision sustains
the constitutionality of the law creating a national
currency, although the Court expressly asserted that
it wu not called upon to pas* upon that portion
making such currency a iex?l tender la individual

Holding Bark the Cuban Question?
Wbnt Does It Mean t
Every one a?ks with some surprise what the
apparently pro-Spanish policy of the adminis
tration and -ho seemingly studied reticence of
Congress on the Cuban question n^ean. Even
those memters of Congress who are most
pronounced and advanced in favor of Cuban
independence or annexation are holding back.
Monster petitions to Congress, with seventy
thousand signatures, for the recognition of
Cuban belligerency or independence are laid
aside for the present, and that upon the motion
of members who have been the warm
friends Df Cuba. Months ago the President
did not hesitate to express opinions highly
favorable to the Cubans. The Secretary of
State was scarcely less sympathetic and hope
ful for Cuba than his chief. All this is on :
record. ?ur Minister at Madrid was instructed
to tell the Spanish government, nearly nine
months ago, that publio opinion in the United
States was so strongly in favor of the Cubans
that the administration and Congress would be
compelled at no distant day to recognize them.
' At the end of the session of Congress last
spring the House of Representatives passed a
resolution unanimously expressing sympathy
with the Cubans in their struggle for freedom
and authorizing the President to recognize
them. It Is known, too, that our government
made an effort, about the san.e time, to nego
tiate with Kpkin for the independence of Cuba, i
Nor should it bo forgotten that the seizure
and detention of the Spanish gunboats for a
| time had no real relation to Peru. No one
had any idea that these gunboats would or
could be used against Peru. The government
knew this, and, therefore, using the Peruvian
Minister or the pretended quari war with Pom
in the matter was mere pretext. There is no
doubt that the object at the time was to serve
the Cubans in an indirect way. Everything
tended to show that the government and
1 people of the United States wero steadily
advancing to a point when this country would
interpose in some way or other in favor of
Cuban irtdependonce. Everybody expected it,
the press anticipated It and the poor Ctsl^ns
were InsplPed with hope by It. That was the
state of the question up to two weeks
ago, and a great deal wai expected
from the President and Congress, or from
Congress, at least, as soon as the session
commenced. General Grant said even to one
of the Cuban Junta, In an interview ten days
since, that Congress would take prompt
action on the subject of Cuba.
Now let us look at the other side of the
| picture. Let us gee bow far the hopes that
| were inspired have been realized, how far
[ the administration have acted in accordance
?
with its professions or popular sentiment, and
how far Congress has come up to the expecta
tions of the publio. First of ail the Presi
dent's Message fell heavy upon tho hearts of
the Cubans and hopes of the American
people. After saying something about the
people of the United States sympathizing with
all who are struggling for liberty and self
government, and the efforts the government
had made to negotiate for the independence of
Cuba, the President states that the contest on
the part of the Cubans "has at no time
assumed the conditions which amount to a
war in the sense of international law, or
which would show the existence of a de facto
political organization of the insurgents suffi
cient to justify a recognition of belligerency."
Then followed immediately after this declara
tion the order to release the Spanish gun
boats, thereby giving unnecessarily the. most
effective aid to the Spaniards while at the
same time utterly ignoring the Cubans. Since
the publication ot the President's Message the
sympathies and ardor of Congress for the
Cubans seem to have been surprisingly chilled.
To all appearances It fell liko a wet blanket
upon the glowing sentiment of liberty and gene
rosity that u4d fired the breasts of Congress
men before that event. Monster petitions for
the Cubans are tabled without notice; resolu
tions favorable to Cuba or to bring up the
Cuban question in any fprm have been
objected to and laid over, and in every way
there seems to havo been a disposition to put
off the subject or to hold back from it for a
time.
This is a curious state of things. It cannot
be explained by any facts known to the public
or by any process of reasoning upon the
caprices or vagaries of human nature. The
Cubans have not forfeited their claim to ihe
sympathy of the American people and govern
ment. On the contrary, they have displayed
those heroio qualities and that ability in the
conduct of their war for independence that
ought to inspire admiration in the heart of
every American. How can the President say
it is not a war in the sense of international law
which would justify the recognition of bel
ligerency in the face of facts to
the contrary that all the world must
know ? General Prim acknowledged lately
that forty thousand troops and fourteen war
vessels had been sent from Spain to suppress
the insurrection, and yet it is known that the
insurgents are stronger to-day and occupy a
larger extent of territory than ever they did
sinco the commencement of the war. From the
very beginning, which from the want of means
was on a very small scale at first,* the Cubans
I have been increasing their power, the strength
of their organization and the territory held,
until they are able to defy successfully all the
power of Spain. The very necessity of these
thirty gunboats which this country has fur
nished the Spaniards, and the enormous rein
forcements sent out from Spain, afToid a
sufficient answer to the President's assumption
that a war in the sense of international law
does not exist. The war is on such a s?ale,
and the Cubans have such an organized
government, both civil and military, that any
nation would be justified in according belige
rent rights. It could be done fairly within the
meaning and general interpretation of inUr
national law. But the American republic and
government should rise above this considera
tion even in the case of Cuba. We should
have a broad and comprehensive American
policy of our own with regard to all
the countries, colonies or territory in this
hemisphere. We should never fail to aid the
cause of republican freedom on American soil
whenever an opportunity occurs. If the
government should not do this at the present '
time in the case of Cuba it will show a
lamentable want of foresight and statesman
ship, will not fulfil its mission and will act in
opposition to both the interests of the country
and public sentiment.
But wo are not willing to believe the
administration is aiming to assist the
Spaniards and to crush the Cubans, notwith
standing the language of the President's Mes
sage and the release of the Spanish gunboats.
We are disposed to believe there may be some
overtures from Spain?some professed dispo
sition on the part of that Power to opon nego
tiations for the sale or cession of Cuba, and that
our government is desirous to conciliate the
Spaniards and to save their pride from being
wounded, so that the object may be accom
plished under the form of friendship. The
extraordinary attentions to General Sickles,
our Minister at Madrid, lately, give color to
this opinion. We cannot believe that the
government, and least of all that General
Grant, would take the back track in the
Cuban question for fear of war with
Spain. Such a bugbear would not
disturb the most nervous* bid fogy if he
had any sense. But if the seeming pro
Spanish and anti-Cuban policy of the adminis
tration arises from any new movelnent on the
part of Spain to negotiate for the sale or inde
pendence of Cuba it may be well to warn the
government against any possible Spanish
treachery, so that it may not aid the Spaniards
in their atrocious system of war on Cuba for
the sake of a remote contingency. If our
government be too yielding and tender in its
friendship for Spain on such a prospect it may
be cheated and be laughed .at by the whole
world for its simplicity and folly. The only
way to treat Spain and this Cuban question is
in the boldest mannor and on the principle of
a broad American policy, independent of
what the rest of tbo world may think or say.
I us Got.d Panic?A Co.vansseioiiAi.
iNVKhTiOATioN.?The subject of the Septem
ber gold panic it to meet investigation at Con
gressional hands. Representative Fox,
whoso district includes Wall street, has
made himself conspicuous for his efforts to
hare ? select committee of investigation
appointed, but his resolution' Bearing direct
animus toward General Grant he was very
properly overslaughed by the majority, ft is
rather Into in the day to make the President
responsible Tor the vagaries of bis brothers-in
law. The matter was amended by another
resolution, emanating from Mr. Schcnck,
directing the Committee on Banking and Cur
rency to make the investigation, and clothing
them with the necessary powers. We doubt if
anything n?w will be dovoloped or if any
result will be attained which will punish the
conspirators or prevent a recurrence of simi
lar conspiracies.
The Tlrgiala Radical l)el?i>Un.
The delegation of radicals from Virginia
who are now pressing upon Congress and the
President "loads of documents," to show that
tbe State should not be admitted into the
Union, had much better hare stayed where they
belong. It is this class of fellows who have
been retarding reconstruction all along. Ilar
ing done all the mischief they could at home?
it indeed it is proper to oall the "Mother of
Presidents" the home of the carpet-bagger?
they come to Washington to put a brake on
the wheels of reconstruction progress. The
President has already, in his Message, recom
mended the admission of Virginia and the re
cognition of her members on the floor of
Congress. There is no doubt that Congress
itsi'lt is inclined to accept General Grant's sug
gpHtionB, and bring the old State into the
Union, relieved of her disabilities, acknowledg
ing that she haB conformed to all the require
ments of the law in the matter. What does
this little radical cabal, then, want in Wash
ington ? It is said that there is a load of
proofs about fraud and intimidation in the late
election. If so, these are questions which
can be settled in Virginia. If there were
any "repeaters" operating there, the local
courts, we suppose, can dispose of them with
out a dolegation coming to Washington to
grumble about it. It is better to let Virginia
come back without farther quibbling or petty
opposition, now that sho stands on the
threshold. How little this delegation could
reasonably hope to effect with the President
or the Reconstruction Committee, to whom
their doleful plaints were to be made, is plain
from the bill introduced in the House yester
day by Mr. Butler, Chairman of the Recon
struction Committee?which will doubtless be
promptly passed?declaring "that the State
of Virginia is entitled to representation in the
Congress of the United States."
The .Monday Diacouraea of the Herald.
Like Father Hyacinthe, in his broad,
world-embracing catholio views of the
enduring and expansive principles of Chris
tianity, it is our purpose in our Sunday edito
rial religious lessons to our readers to culti
vate the grand idea of the tendency of the
material and moral forces of the age to a
fusion of all creeds, all colors and all nations
under one general system. Here we have
scope and verge enough to embrace all
the prophets, all the apostles and all
the religion founders and leaders, and
churches, and orders, past and present,
in the four quarters of the globe. How dif
ferent this from the small abstractions, and
quibbles of doctrine, and chop-logic, and
twaddle on the peculiar kinks and crotchets of
this sect, that sect and the other of religious
professors. The long and bloody reign of
universal ignorance and superstition, of civil
wars and wars between nations is drawing to
a close with the extension of tbe amalga
mating moral forces of modern enlightenment,
with its scientific inventions and appliances.
The new era may be dated from the sup
pression of African slavery, with the downfall
of our late rebellion; tor in this great revolu
tion the whole world has been awakened to
he invincible and progressivo moral forces of
the Bteam engine, the electric telegraph and
the independent press.
*The SpaM9U Gunboats.?We give to-day a
report of the actual condition of the Spanish
armada?eighteen of the gunboats being almost
ready to depart for Havana, under convoy of
the Spauish war steamer Pizarro, which lately
brought over officers and men for them, and a
second flotilla being likely to be completed in a
fortnight, and to be officered and manned from
a second Spanish war steamer which is
expected to arrive. We give also a list of the
officers and of the American engineers engaged
for the first expedition. In connection with
this report it is noteworthy that Senator Car
penter has lifted hit voice in the Senate in
favor of the cause of Cuban independence,
having introduced yesterday a resolution?
which he gave notice that he would call up on
Wednesday for debate and action?to prevent
the sailing of the Spanish gunboats from New
York so long as the rebellion continued in
Cuba.
Thk Breaking Up of tuk Couxoii, at
Naples.?The anti-Papal Council, or the meet
ing of the Freethinkers, which was convened
in Naples on ihe 9th inst., if the cable
despatches are correct, seems to have proved
a failure. The details of the causc of its col
lapse are not given, but an inference can be
drawn from the list of names reported to be
connected with the movement, which have at
various periods appeared in the columns of the
IIbuald. The sentiments entertained by the
extreme opposition party have doubtless been
so strong that their utterance caused a rupture
even among themselves. Italy has advanced
considerably on the path of enlightenment
since the liberation of Naples from the Bour
bon rule, especially in respect to religion, and
although freedom of thought is advocated^
public opinion is too well biased to tolerate
any excess.
Spain?Pkim'h Ki;mokei? Coup i>'Etat.?
From l'aris we learn that General Prim has
grown tired of the unsettled state of things in
Spain, and that he seriously meditates a coup
d'ltat, with the view of placing the young Duke
of Genoa on the throne and proclaiming him
self Dictator during the King's minority.
Another despatch ha# it that Prim has denied
any intention of a r,oup d'etat, but that he
declares it to be his belief that an immense
majority of the Spanish people are in favor of
the Duke ; that the Duke's mother favors her
son's candidature, and that the probability i?
the Duke will soon be proclaimed King of
Spain. Tho two despatches are not altogethor
contradictory. Prim has tho army at hia back,
and he knows it. It will not surprise us to
learn that tho eoupd'Ctat has been accom
plished?that the Duke of Genoa ttas been
proclaimed King and Prim Dictator. But
we shall not then bo convinced that Spain
haa found her haven of rest.

British Affair*?The Old ftar* 0?M Agmim. j
Our cable despatches from Great Iritaia
are of the most alarming description. Cabinet
meetings are being held in London. The
state of Ireland is the special cause of these
, meetings. It is said that as the result <f these
Cabinet, deliberations certain sectbns of
Ireland?viz., the county of Tipperry, in
Munster, and some portions of Ulster?are to
be proclaimed in a state of insurrection It is
added that five thousand additional tro?ps are
to be sent to Ireland without delay, this rais
ing the actual force in Ireland to thirty
thousand men. It la farther said ttut when
I Parliament reassembles on the 10th of Jan
uary a bill will be introduced empowering the
government to suspend the act of habeas
corpus at will, thus dispensing with tfaa neces
sity of waiting for the action of th< legisla
ture.
? Some of this intelligence seems to us ques
tionable. It shoots ahead a little to> wildly.
At the same time no one can refuse to admit
that Ireland is in a troubled and, so ar as the
British government is concerned, uiaatisfac
tory condition. One man, who is a notorious
Fenian, has been elected to the imperial Par
liament, and other Fenians now in prison are
popular candidates. Whatever the explana
tion, the fact is undeniable that Ir. Glad
stone's Church measure has not saisfled the
Irish people, and that his promised settlement
of the land tenure system does lot soothe
them. Mr. Gladstone evidently iitended to
build up a great reputation aa tie healer
of Ireland's sores; but in proportio as suc
cess seems to have been merited failure has
been marked. For centuries Island has
complained of two living practical wrongs?
an alien Church establishment and an
obnoxious system of land tenure, "he former
of these grievances Mr. Gladitone has
removed; the latter he promises toremove in
the first session of Parliament, lehold the
result! Ireland is more anti-English than

What it the reason ? Is H that Ireland Is
absolutely irreconcilable? Or is' it that
Irishmen have so long been used t< ?e angry
with the Englishmen that they have begun to
look forward with .a holy horror to tie loss of
their identity ? We have heard of ac Irish wo
man who got tired of her hnsband because Pat
^|s too good-natured and would not help to get
up a row. Is this the case now as between Ire
land and England ? The situation is certainly
peculiar and somewhat of a puzzle. We await
further developments with some degree of
interest.
Was News fbom Pak,<q o a y. ?The war
news from Paraguay is to-daf highly favorable
to the prospects of the alied forces, as it
usually i8 when it cornea bf way of Lisbon.
This is not the first time tkat the fall of one
after another of the strongholds of the Para
guayans has been confidently annoanced. But
how often the announcement has been contra
dicted a day or two afterwards by news from dif
lorent and more reliable souices! If the allies
are now said to be marchings "the last outpost
of President Lope*" we must not too hastily
infer that they wiU surely riach it. Whatever
maybe the fiual result of the war the brare
and stubborn resistance of the Paraguayans
will be historical.

Court yesterday, and Judge Barnard appointed

John Livingston is alleged to haye "manared
by fraud trick and device," to have a trust
deed made in 18G3, but whom he is said to
haye been persecuting with lawsuits for a
long while in order to get him removed. That
Mr. Livingston is what Dr. Johnson wo?Id call

against the Judge which Livingston himself
had made and then attributed to him. Judire

Monthi-y Pensions?Wht Not? ?The
Ladies' Union Relief Association have in con
templation an excellent modification of the
present system of paying pensions to widows
of soldiers. Those pensions are now paid on
the 1st of March and the lgt of Septembfir
The result is that not only does great incon
venience arise in the Pension Office on pay
days as well as to the recipients themselves,
but many poor widows Vd sick soldiers are
greatly distressed by the long interval between
the payments. It is proposed that the law
m' 80 Tml6d aH u make the
monthly, and to substitute for the existing
cumbrous system that of sending money orders
to those entitled to pensions. It i. claimed
that this plan will abolish the pension agencies,
which are a fruitful source of fraud and extor
tion, from which the poor suffer severely at
times, for this reason alone, apart from the
conoray to the government In disbursing
pensions, the movement on the part of these
ch.iritable ladies commends itself to our judir

instead of half-yearly by all moans.

The Omm rf /<*? n?"1*
Yesterday La the General Term of the
Supreme Court Judge Clerke, the presiding
Justice, rendered the judgment of the court on
the writ of error obtained by the counsel of
John Real, affirming the verdict of guilty pro
nounced by the jury In the Court of Oyer
and Terminer and refusing a new trial.
Real was convicted in February I&aI
of murder in the first degree for having
killed police officer Smedlck in the summer of
1868. It was urged by the defendant's coun
sel that the court which tried him had no
jurisdiction, as he was tried in February,
1869, and the case having been transferred
from the General Sessions in August, 1868,
the February term of the Court of Oyer and
Terminer waB not the next term after the
transfer was made, at which the defendant
ought to have been tried under the law, and
therefore bis trial was without law and
coram non judice. A number of the rulings
of Judge Barnard during tho triil and hi?
charge to the jury were also objected to aa
erroneous and invalidating the verdict. On
all the points and objections raised the court
decided against the defendant, the grounds of
the decision being elaborately stated In tho
opinion of Judge Clerke. Judge Barnard con
curred in the result. Judge Cardoso filed hi*
views, dissenting from the judgment of tha
Court and expressing his conviction that a
now trial should have been granted.
IMPORTANT DHOISION JBT CHIEF JfJSTIOB
Cnask. ?The opinion delivered yesterday In
the United States Supreme Court, by the Chief
Justice, sustains the authority of Congress to
tax the circulation of the State banks, affirm
ing the powers of government to create a na
tional currency and the constitutionality o
acts for the emission of Treasury notes. A
dissenting opinion was presented by Mr. Ju?r
tioe Nelson and concurred In by Mr.. Justloa
Da vies, contendiag that the tax upon the circu

tempt to crush them out of existence.
Military Honors to Gkobui Piabodt.?
It is all right for the United States govern
ment to turn out its marines to escort Mr.
Peabody's remains to the depot on their arrival
here. That is the only expression of honor in
its power. But to turn out our city militia to
do military honor to thiB distinguished citltan
in a trip to Massachusetts would be absurdly
inappropriate. It would be much better to
parade all oar benevolent societies and all our
schools to fittingly honor a man of great
benevolence and a friend of education.
