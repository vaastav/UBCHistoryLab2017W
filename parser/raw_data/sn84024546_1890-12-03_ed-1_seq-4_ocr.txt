PITTSBURG, WEDNESDAY. DEC. 3, lS9a
A CONVINCING experiment.
Superintendent Warner's statement of the
exact cost of improving the last eleven hun
dred feet of road by the workhouse labor
completes ibe showing of this interesting
end important experiment. The statement
that 1,098 feet of road had been graded,
macadamized, graveled, rolled and drained
by convict labor at a cost of 75 3-3 cents per
lineal foot is the most conclusive that can
be made with regard to their employment of
workhouse and prison labor on that much
needed work.
The statement brings out a suggestion
which might tend to increase the benefits of
convict labor. The statement shows that the
labor of the men is charged at CO cents per
day which, as the Superintendent states, is
24 cents above the cost of maintenance. The
county, of course, has no desire to go into
such work for the sake of a profit; but it
would be quite legitimate to let the work
offer to tbe men a chance of making a little
wages over the cost of maintenance. In any
plan for the general employment of such
labor, it would be an inducement to good work
and a benefit to the convicts to give them the
share of the wages that they earn over the
cost of keeping them. At SO cents a aay
their labor would be economical, in this
case increasing the cost of the entire work to
about So cents per lineal foot. If the men
were credited 40 cents a day for work that
Is up to the standard, the money to be paid
lo them at the expiration of their sentences,
it would not only make them ready and will
ing to work, but would afford a safeguard
against attempts to escape, in the money
that a man who serves out his sentence
would be entitled to draw at his discharge.
3Ir. Warner's practical work is certainly
fall of important suggestions with regard to
the intelligent direction of convict labor to
the improvement of the highways.
A HEALTHY rLACE.
The ceusus has not done a very great deal
for this region, but we may be thankful for
the advertisement it has made of the won
derful healthiness of the First District of
Hraddock. According to the returns which
lave been specially verified, Hawkins and
Swissvale, the suburbs included in the
First Census District, have nearly 2,000 in
habitants ot whom only seven died from
June 18S9 to June 1S90. It is hardly sur
prising that but two doctors and no under
takers can live there, and Superintendent
Porter is doubtless correct in terming it the
healthiest district in the country.
DEMOCRATIC DIFFERENCES.
The selection of Messrs. Harrity and Hen
Eel as the leading members of Governor Pat
tison's official family has produced the usual
reports of dissatisfaction in Democratic
quarters. It is stated that Judge Gordon,
of Philadelphia, who was the legislative
leader for the former Pattison administra
tion, does not speak with Mr. Harrity as
they pass by, and is disposed to extend the
same non-intercourse to the head of the com
ing administration. Jlr. Stenger, who was
Secretary of State in Pattison's first term, is
sJso alleged to be in a state of insurrection
over the preferment of Mr. Hensel, whose
position in the last campainn is thought to
lave differed from Mr. "Wallace's, only by
virtue of his having made an earlier discov
ery as to the advisability of his getting on
board of the train.
It is not at all improbable that these re
ports have some foundation in fact. Our
Democratic friends in Pennsylvania have
long possessed the quality of throwing a
maximum of earnestness into the disposition
of a minimum of patronage as the settle
ment of a usually empty partisan leader
ship. That quality has in the caucus
and conventions of the Allegheny county
Democracy furnished some strenuous illus
trations; and it would not be a violation of
party precedents if Messrs. Gordon and
Stenger should bite their thumbs over tbe
preferment granted to Messrs. Harrity and
Hensel.
So far as the public is concerned, how
ever, there is little disposition to share the
feelings either of rebellion or enthusiasm
which marks the Democratic wings. The
jiublic knows what good work can be done
by an active and uncompromising Attorney
General, from the example of Attorney
General Cassiday. It is also the fact that
the alliteration which locates the Governor's
chief appointments in the H's indicates a
departure from that other alliterative com
bination that put the Governor in the field,
and which, according to the telegram of a
disappointed Wallace man, was confined
strictly to the M's. Put while the personal
qualifications of the new Cabinet, and their
disposition, either toward partisan or re
form politics, are matters of public interest,
the people will recognize that the proof of
the pudding will lie in the eating. They
have faith, from the Governor's former
record, that his administration will direct
its efforts to the honest and independent
furtherance of the interests of the people on
State matters. If Messrs. Harrity and
Hensel prove efficient aids in that work,
their appointment will be fully demon
strated to have been a wise selection, inde
pendent of the sensibilities of other party
leaders. If not, it will be the misfortune of
the administration, and not the fault of the
public
As bearing upon the probable outcome of
these appointments, it is pertinent to recall
the iact that the appointment of Attorney
General Cassiday at the beginning of Gov
ernor Pattison's first term was one that was
ruott widely criticised; but at the end of the
terra it was Hip one that was most onm"lMc'r
vindicated by the events of the administration.
THE TREASURY FIGURES.
The Secretary of the Treasury's report pre
sents the usual statement of actnal and esti
mated receipts and expenditures of the Gov
ernment for the past, the current and the
next fiscal year. As intimated in yester
day's Dispatch the favorable exhibit of a
surplus of 515,000,000 for the next fiscal
year is reached by excluding from the ex
penditures the sinking fund expenditure
and the announced deficiency of 533,000,000
in the pensions appropriation for the cur
rent year; and the cash resources of the
Treasury appear to be swelled by includ
ing among them the national bank redemp
tion fund, every dollar of which is deposited
to meet a demand liability. While these de
partures from the former methods of ac
counting may be legal, it is certain that
their results do not give the public an ac
curate idea of cither the present or pros
pective condition of the Treasury.
After devoting considerable space to the
discussion of the bond purchases, their rela
tion to the money market, the tariff and cus
toms regulation laws and the internal reve
nue, the Secretary gives some figures on the
subject of circulation. Opposed to the idea
that there has been a decrease in the mone
tary circulation of the country during late
years, the Secretary presents the fact that
there has been a net increase in all kinds of
circulation during the past twenty years of
727,760,709; during the past ten years of
$476,039,024. For the past five years no
comparison is made, but the figures are
given which suffice for a comparison and
show the increase to be about 250,000,000.
The increase is largest in the items of gold
and silver certificates, while the decrease is
wholly in the national bank circulation.
This certainly seems to dispel the idea that
there has been a decrease in the circulating
medium, although it still leaves open the
question whether the increase has kept pace
with the expansion of business demands dur
ing the past decade.
The Secretary next proceeds to discuss the
silver question. He points out v'ie differ
ence between the silver legislation recom
mended in his last report and that which
was adopted by Congress. He thinks, how
ever, that the silver act is an improvement
over the old one, and that while it is too
soon to judge of its permanent results, "it
has been the means of providing a healthy
and much-needed addition to the circulating
medium of the United States." This ap
pears to indicate that the preceding demon
stration by the Secretary of the large in
crease of circulation is not to be taken as
expressing his conviction that the previous
increase was all that the country needed.
The rest ot the report is taken up with
matters of a rather stereotyped character,
the statistics of imports and exports being
the most important feature which is, of
course, summarized from the more detailed
reports of the Bureau of Statistics. The re
port shows the Treasury to be in good con
dition. Its resources are ample to meet all
possible demands upon it, and it will still
remain as the most stable and solvent public
treasury in the world. But it may be
questioned whether some of the methods
that have been changed by the present ad
ministration would not have more clearly
informed the public of the fact that the
present scale of expenditures and receipts
brings the income and outgo of the Govern
ment more nearly to a balance than for many
years in the past.
IN JAIL AGAIN.
Jail-breaking, after all, is not such a de
lightful recreation. The Nicely murderers
are now in a position to appreciate the com
fort of bed and board behind prison walls,
even with the gallows in the background.
The ending ot this daring attempt to evade
justice cannot but have a discouraging ef
fect upon tbe inmates of penitentiaries, and,
perhaps, the warning of broken bones and
recapture may serve to deter other prisoners
from making their keepers ridiculous. It is
to be hoped that the dangerous criminals
who escaped from the Western Penitentiary
will be retaken in like manner.
KAILROAD FACT AND FANCY.
The argument of the railroad interest,
which is urging, under the leadership of
Mr. Gould, the restoration of the system of
combination and pooling, is that under com
petition the earnings of the roads are cut
down so that they are brought to the verge
ot ruin. The assertion of Mr. Aldace T.
Walker that if the railroad officials were
left to themselves tbey would bring the
properties entrusted to their management to
a condition of universal smash, was noticed
in these columns some' time ago. Now the
same arguments are used by the kings of
Wall street to justify the combination
which they have lormed among the trans
continental lines, and to support the modest
request that Congress shall for their benefit
repeal the fifth section of the inter-State
commerce act, which prohibits pooling.
With regard to the transcontinental lines
the assertion has this foundation in fact that
rates have been cut on these lines to a losing
point. But everyone who has kept posted
knows that this was done as a part of the
Gould plan to attack the lines which he
wished to absorb, and either drive them into
a combination or depreciate their stock so
that he could by it at what he thought a
bargain. This is simply a new illustration
of the principle often pointed out by The
Dispatch that cut-throat rate wars are al
ways inspired by some purpose of combina
tion; and that legitimate competition will
always stop where the profit that is the pur
pose of natural competition, is turned into
loss.
With regard to the general condition of
the railroads, the allegation that their in
ability to pool traffic reduces them to a ruin
ous condition, is contradicted by tbe most
convincing proof, namely, the reports of
railroad earnings published from week to
week in Wall street. These reports cannot
be made the basis of exactly equal compari
sons because the number of roads actually
reporting changes each year. But when we
find that the totals show a constant increase,
the utter factitiousness of the railway plea of
general demoralization is established. Thus
the gross earnings of 146 lines which re
ported for tbe first ten months of this year
and last were $415,046,015 in 1890, against
$379,872,990 in 1889; of 138 lines reporting
in 1889 and 1888, there was an increase
from f321.276.191 in 1888, to 349,914,796 in
1889, and so on down with a greater or less
gain in gross earnings for every year sin.ee
the passage of the inter-State commerce act.
This contradiction of their argument is
explained by the railway people with the
assertion that while rates have been cut so
as to increase the traffic and consequently
tbe gross earnings the business has been so
unprofitable that they made no money.
That plea is, however, subject to the test of
the Wall street figures in the returns of net
earnings. These figures are given for a re
duced number of lines, it is true, but for a
sufficient number to afford a fair criterion,
as follows:
Eight months No. of Year Previous
ended Aug. 31. roads. Riven. year.
1317 i CI $99.IXariff SS-SSIKI
1S88 77 81.273,614 90,737,975
1SS9 113,413.1107 93,730,837
1K H5 U5.17r.350 117,810,034
Thus we see that the net earnings of the
115 lines reporting show a gain of 6 per cent
as compared with last year. This is not very
large; but when we note that the .gain of
1889 was 15 per cent over the previous year,
it is allowable to infer that to improve on
that very decided prosperity is by no means
an indication of general ruin. We further
see in these figures the fact that for the five
years past there has been a steady gain iu
net earnings with the exception of one year,
which is a reflection of the further general
fact that since the inter-State commerce law
abolished pooling, railroad rates have been
steadier, on a conservative and reasonable
basis, than they ever were under the regime
of universal pooling.
It is quits possible that in the near future
railroad earnings will show a slight decrease
on account of the short crops and conse
quently decreased traffic. It will hardly ap
pear to the general public a good reason why
the companies should be permitted to com
bine to make the productive interests pay
moro for a less service. But up to the pres
ent time, it is pertinent that the railroad
plea of general demoralization and ruin for
lack of pooling is entirely an effort of the
imagination.
The Western blizzards will probably

Of Congressman Oates' proposition to
mpose an income tax on Incomes of $10,000 or
more, the New York JPress says: "No measure
ot taxation has ever been so obnoxious to the
people of this country as an income tax." This
is true so far as tlio people who had incomes
within the scope of the law are concerned.
Wo never heard ot any complaint from the
masses who were not taxed by it.
Controller Morrow's notification that
city expenditures must be kept within tbe lim
its of the appropriations is an eminently cor
rect attitude. Fay as you go i3 a good rule for
communities as well as individuals.
One of Stanley's critics objects to the
frequency with which he says "I" and "we."
When a man has done what Stanley has done
in Africa be has something to say "f and "wo"
about. Egotism is a relative term and its lia
bility to criticism depends on what a given
man has done. If Stanley's critic should talk
about himself no exception could bo taken to
the charge of egotism.
The Governor of New Jersey pardoned
Eva Hamilton; but since it Is announced that
she Is going on tbe stage it becomes doubttul
whether the public can pardon her.
The New York World asks, "Where be
your jibes now.Mr. President pro tern Ingallsr',
Perhaps Mr. Ingalls may be rather short in the
matter of jibes, but there is reason to think
that before tbe session is ended he may relieve
himself of some characteristic talk, in which
he will express a very savage opinion ot former
Republican voters who have left Ingalls on the
shelf.
The winter started off badly, but made
a vigorous effort to redeem itself on tbe second

The assertion of Secretary Noble's report
with regard to the Indians, that "there has
been steady progress made in engaging them
in peaceful ways and Industrial pursuits," indi
cates that the Secretary mast have been so
busy over his report that he did not have time
to study the current news from the Indian
agencies.
Let the Weather Bureau be credited with
having brought Its cold wave in according to
programme. A few more successes of this sort
and the past will be forgotten.
The Secretary of the Treasury proves
that there is more money in circulation now
than either five, ten or twenty years ago, but he
fails to give due allowance to the artistic man
ner in which Jay Gould and John D. Rocko
feller have got their grip on a large share of
the increase.
The Indian ghost dances are not likely to
do much hurt, it the spirits that white rascals
sell to the Indians are kept away from them.
The census district which had a death
rate of only seven to a population of nearly
two thousand is in our suburbs. Its showing
for health is so good thai a large influx of pop
ulation may be expected, which will, of course,
bring up tbe death rate.

most degree. The work Is as profitable for the

of every kind salaries, repairs, insurance, food

APPBECIATE THE COMPLIMENT.
Swedish-Americans Pleased With the
Honors Shown to John Ericsson.
Washington. Dec. 2. The Committee of
Swedish-American citizens, of New York, who
had charge of a part of the procession on the
occasion of the removal of the remains of
Captain John Ericsson to the United States
steamship Baltimore, have sent a personal
letter to the Secretary of the Navy, in which
they say:
"We consider it our pleasant and paramount
duty to express to you, and through you to the
Government of tbe United States, our earnest
and heartfelt gratitude for the alacrity and
tenderness with which you undertook to carry
out the wishes ot the old hero. Tho grand,
liberal, and yet perfectly orderly manner, in
which this delicate task was performed, de
serves thanks, not only of ns, his late country
men, but also of the American people and of
the whole world. Republics may be somewhat
slow in recognizing tho merits of their great
wen, bnt they are not ungrateful. To the best
ot our knowledge and belief, no other man of
foreign birth has been so honored as was John
Ericsson. Such actions of our Government
tend to still further strengthen the ties that
bind tbe hearts of the Swedish-born citizens to
theiradoptcd country. Sweden isour old mother,
but Columbia is our brido to whom we propose
to remain loyal and true. We hope, Mr. Secre
tary, that you will kindly receivo these feeble
expressions of our gratitude and of tbe high
esteem in which we hold you and tbe Govern
ment you in this particular case so worthily and
nobly represented."

THE TOPICAL TALKER.
Llko Lot's Wife.
T-Iow did you like the sermon, girls?" a
Pittsburg man asked of his two nieces
at luncheon last Sunday. "Didn't hear a word
of it," the younger girl, a sweet seventeener,
replied.
"Why, how was thatT Dr. Blank has a good
voice."
"Yes but those Mallory boys who are home
from college do stare so they didn't take their
eyes off us all through the sermon."
And this statement gained a singular signifi
cance wben it came out that the offending
young men sat five or six rows behind the girls
on the other side of the churob.
Dust, hut Not of Gold.
iT5ion and poor must go down to tho grave
alike,".said Deacon Smith sentcntiously.
"They take their 'dust' with them, though,"
said his irreverent son.
Bulletins About tho Baby.
'tXT'HEN a young mother and her first born,
still a tender monthllng, left Pittsburg to
visit friends in the Eait, the former sent bulle
tins on postal cards from three or four stop
ping places to the father who was, or was sup
posed to be, in a very critical state of anxiety
about tbe baby's entire safety and happiness.
Here is a sample bulletin: "Baby has been
sleeping 20 minutes before that took a great
fancy to that young man you introduced me to
in the next section, and was rather inclined to
be cross because I wouldn't let my precious
pull bis newspaper to piece?. He cries when
ever the train stops, but seems to like the mo
tion of the cars still sleeping Harnsburg, 2:45
p. M."
A bachelor friend of the happy fathor, to
whom the latter confided tho baby bulletin
idea, smiled one of those aggravating smiles
tbe unmarried man kecp3 constantly in stock,
and said: "Twenty years hence, old man, that
boy of yours will send his own bulletins when
he goes a-traveling. and they will be briefer
and more stirring messages than his mother's.
Something of this sort: 'Dead broke send S20
quick!' "
A ParaUel Case.
iTt is dreadful the way misfortune follows
misfortune, and disaster, disaster with
some people look at poor Mrs. B , she's lost
her husband and two children within a year,
and her own health is breaking," said she,
"xes," said he, "look at my case too. I've
hardly paid for your new sealskin, when half a
dozen opera companies come to town, one after
the other."
A Joke Frappeed.
A large block of ice which wonld have
been worth a king's ransom last August
lay all day on the Fifth avenue pavement in
front of the Western Union Office. It attracted
considerable attention with the usual cursory
remarks, as people tripped over it. Some
small jokes as well as shins were cracked over
the iceberg also.
"Not often you see apiece of Ice that size left
in the street," was tho one pedestrian's remark.
"It's a cold day wben ice gets left there,
you'll observe," his companion rejoined.
THE PBESIBENTS MESSAGE.
New York Evening Sun (Dem.): President
Harrison has Issued his annual message. It is
a long one. The Evening Sun prints it. Read
it if you like, but it's hardly worth it.
NetvYork Star (Dem.): Politically, it is a
purely partisan plea in extenuation of the
course of tho administration and tbe Con
gress which the people have just decisively
condemned.
New York Evening World (Dem.): Fresi
dent Harrison's message, presented to Congress
to-day, is a very carefully prepared document.
It treats with more or less detail many im
portant questions.
Philadelphia Times (Dem.): The one fact
clearly taught by tbe message is that the Pres
ident makes the old Bourbons of France com
paratively respectable by learning nothing and
forgetting nothing.
New York Evening Post (Mugwump): At
no time since the war has a session of Congress
opened when thePresident's message was of so
little consequence to the members or to the
public. This Is true as to both sides of the
Chamber. ,
Philadelphia Record ( Dem.): Tbe Presi
dent's message to Congress has been composed
under circumstances of irritation and difficulty,
and it is chieflj noteworthy in showing how un
able the writer is to adjust himself to the polit
ical situation.
Philadelphia Evening Bulletin (Rep.):
It is almost the same message In spirit and pur
pose, if not in phrase, as that which General
Harrison wrote a year ago. In this sense it
does not indicate that the President has
broadened as a party leader.
Philadelphia Inquirer (Rep.): The feat
ure of tbo message is tho backbone displayed
by the President. In spite of the Democratic
whirlwind ho stands just where he did before
the elections, unless indeed, be has advanced a
step or two upon the subject of reciprocity.
New York Commercial Advertiser (Ind.):
If the Congress pays any heed to tbe voice of
the country as expressed in the November
elections, little will be done except in the trans
action of necessary routine business, and the
enactment of a few minor bills loft over from
the last session.
Philadelphia Press (Rpp.): The message
throughout maintains with earnestness and
broad judgment the policy and principles upon
which tbe administration came into power.
What has been done was in pursuance of that
policy, and because it was elected on a platform
requiring it to do those very things.
Philadelphia Ledger (Rep.): But the
President should not let this point escape
bis view, nor should Congress either, that the
Federal election bill is the product of most In
veterate partisanship, both as to its paternity
and as to tbe Houso of Representatives that
passed it. It would fall by the President's own
test.
Philadelphia Evening Telegraph (Rep.):
It simply necessitates, on the part of tbe wisest,
best and most patriotic clement of the party,
the stern repudiation of Mr. Harrison as the
leader of the Republican organization. To fol
low out his unwise counsel in this respect
would be to surrender the great contest of IS92
in advance.
New York Times (Mugwump): The Presi
dent has forgotten little and learned nothing.
He meets the Congress in which his party pro
voked defeat, on its reassembling, with a tedi
ously urgent exhortation to remedy none of
tho mistakes already made, to press forward in
the samo line, and trust to that Providence
which the French say watches over "Ameri
cans and fools."
New York Tribune (Rep): The message
of the President is a calm, dignified and able
document, which appeals to tbe sober thought
of Americans, and will strongly influence pub
lic opinion. Without any reference to the re
cent elections the President makes it clear
that he does not regard the neglect or absence
of a fifth of tbe Republican voters any reason
for supposing the people have abandoned tbe
'convictions which were registered in the full
vote of 1SS3.
Brooklyn Eagle (Ind.): ,The plea for the
passage of the force bill is a fatuous one. This
repudiated Congress has the physical power,
but tho Eagle does not believe it will have-tbe
Immoral courage to pass it. Should it do so,
however, nothing could prevent the measure
from becoming an Instrument for the solidi
fication of the North against the Republican
party as thoroughly as past enactments in its
likeness have become such a means for the
solidification of tbe South against that party.
New York Herald (Dem.): But Mr. Har
rison in tbe latter part of his message shows
himself to be the head of a party rather than
the President of a people. He reminds Con
gress that this is their short session and calls
upon them to push certain purely partisan bills
with vigor and celerity. The reapportionment
and force bills must receive immediate at
tention. Mr. Harrison is an honest man, but a
thorough partisan. We have never questioned
his motives or his integrity, only his judgment.
NEW YORKlSun (Dem.): The principal thing
in President Harrison's message is a zealous
recommendation that the force bill should be
taken up and pressed through Congress.
This scheme should be resisted determinedly,
unyieldingly, uncompromisingly, by every
Democrat. If necessary, every means of delay
and obstruction should be resorted to In Con
gress. Tbe mischiefs that are sure to arise
from such a political resolution are so great
and so grave as to crerghadow every,, other
question.
THE MOZART CLUB.
Opening Concert of the Thirteenth Season or
the Organization An Audience to he
Proud or Other Features of a Social In
terest. The opening concert of the Mozart Club's
thirteenth season came off very pleasantly at
Old City Hall last evening. It Is good to no'e
tbe size, quality and faithfulness of the clien
tele which this leading local organization has
acquired throngh its dozen years of honest,
earnest work. It can now always depend upon
having at its regular concerts as was the caso
last night an audience of 1.000 and upward,
comprising really the best elements of the com
munity; and that In spite of counter attractions
or an overplus of other concerts near the same
date. Till is as it should be.
Nicolal's light, merry and graceful overture
to the "Merry Wives ot Windsor" formed an
appropriate preluuo for tho cantata, Qowen's
"Rose Maiden," to which tbe remainder of the
evoning was devoted. The playing jgf tho
overture was eminently praiseworthy from
every mechanical point of view; there was a
well-balanced body of tone, and the work was
at all points clean, correct and full of life and
spirit. The orchestra that has got that far. is
now ready for effective drill upon the finer
points of shading, phrasing and expression.
"The Rose Maiden" presents a pretty little
story about a flower fairy who longs for love
and gets herself changed into a mere evcry-day
girl in order to obtain that donbtf nl boon. Af
ter meeting with another girl to whom love bad
brought pain throngh the desertion of her
lover, she herself gets married and thinks her
self very lucky, until death suddenly claims
her husband and she dies of grief, quite con
vinced that love, whether early disappointed or
realized, brings more trouble than it is worth.
In the hands of Mr. Schopenhauer, for In
stance, the story might have pointed a grimly
philosophical moral. As the libretto stands,
however, the story is simply an excuse for a
string of pretty verses, from which everything
dramatic or philosophical is excluded as far as
well could be done.
Mr. Frederic H. Cowen a youth of 18, when,
inlbTO, he comonsed this music as his opns 3
has been at even more pains than his librettist
to free the story from everything that might
grate on sensitive ears: the few opportunities
for dramatic contrasts and varied coloring be
has either passed over altogether or touched
very gingerly. The net result in a cantata fill
ing up an hour and a half with a succession of
sweets that become cloying long before tbe
time is up. Some of them are very sweet in
deed; lovely Ivrics that gave ample promise of
his matured skill in ballad writing. There
are a few tourbps of color well
laid on; but precious few. The cboral writing
is veryslmple.bat shows here and there some
admirable effects in the moving and massing of
the voices. There is more real musicianship
in the orchestration tban in aught else; it Is
Interesting and often surprisingly skillful for
so young a band. The string of very pretty
solos and duets is, however, beyond a doubt
what has kept the work alive for a score of
years.
The chorni turned out in lull force last
nigbtand all tbe singers seemed to be in fine
fettle. Cowen's fluent measures were easy
prey to this spirited force. Too easy, indeed,
for about the only choral fault was a ten
dency to sing straightaway from the shoulder,
so to SDeals without enough attention to tbe
nice points of shading. In all other respects
the work of the chorus calls for high praise; in
parity and volume of tone it has never done
better. The orchestral score of tbe cantata
was by no means so well treated; bnt it could
not expect anything but a cold shoulder after
dallying so long on the way from England that
it caused this concert's postponement and
could not be sufficiently rehearsed itself. Con
ductor James P. McCollnm and his players did
all that could be expected under the circum
stances. Miss Grace Miller sang the soprano solo parts
with that rarely pure and sympathetic voice of
hers and a goodly amount of taste and senti
ment. Miss Ella Semple. who took the con
tralto part, made her first appearance as a solo
ist in tbe Mozart concerts and fully justified
her choice. She has a sweet, rich, mezzo-soprano
voice, without any contralto quality,
and she sang with ease and expression. Mr.
Joseph A. Vogel sang the tenor part with fine
art too fine. In tonal power, to be heard at
first, though be warmed up toward the close.
Mr. Vogel has too good a voice to be held
under that way. Mr. E. H. Dcrmltt, suddenly
called on to take tbe bass part assigned to Mr.
Amberson, who could not be present, was in
excellent voice and deserves all credit for his
manful effort at an Impossible task.
AN INTEBESIING MEETING
Of tho Woman's Club, at "Which Several
Good Papers Were Read.
The papers read at the Woman's Club yester
day afternoon wero all of unusual interest. "A
Visit to Greenland" was the subject chosen by
Mrs. Scriven, and in a delightful manner the
lady told of that icy country and its inhabit
ants. With "the historical tradition regarding
tbe origin of tho little people was the paper
introduced, and then in a logical treatment
were their lives and customs portrayed. A
fact of considerable interest listened to in the
paper is that no marriage ceremony prevails
in Greenland, and that heroic measures are
pursued by a native wben he wishes a bride,
and by her family if tbey object to him for a
relative. Ho is compelled by custom to secure
his wife by main force, and if he is unsuccess
ful in escaping with his lady-love to his own
dwelling place, bis life is the forfeit.
With "The Spanish School of Painters"
Mrs. Lichlioter proved herself very familiar,
and a delightful half hour was spent in hearing
of the peculiarities of the ancient and modern
Spanish painters. That they were tho most
famous colorists in the world was stated upon
good authority; that their works were all
deeply imbued with religious sentiment was
affirmed likewise in connection with consider
able other interesting Information. The dis
cussion which followed the reading ot the paper
was animated, and awakened thonght for
future study and research.
"The Cid," the famous Spanish hero, was the
subject of Mr. Reynolds' paper, and In it was
the history of the wonderful man traced, from
his birth in the earlv part of tho tenth century,
to his death, in lOtW. His association with the
crowned heads of tbe aze, his wonderful valor,
his banishment, from which he received the
title, "The Cid," meaning lowered, his rein
statement in royal favor, and bis death, with
the final tragedy, wherein his dead body was
strapped to his war charger and led one of the
most important battles of the war then in
progress, were all treated in a wonderfully in
teresting manner by Mrs. Reynold, and were
the subject of an extended discussion after
ward. Preceding the reading of the papers, the
President. Mrs. Wade, briefly outlined the
plans of the Isabella Association
of the World's Fair, which tho club
naa been asked to Indorse, miss Matilda
Hlndmau also made a few remarks upon the
subject as President of tho State of Pennsyl
vania for tbe association. No action was taken
noon the matter other tban tn defer it till some
future meeting ot the club. Before adjourning
Mrs. Wade also addressed the club regarding
tbe coming annual meeting in January, when
officers are elected and a course of study de
cided upon for the year. Several new members
were granted admission to tho club.

The average annual yield per tea-plant
is very variable, but may be stated at about
one-fifth of a pound of finished tea; and, as
each acre of a garden hold3 1.500 to 1,600 mature
plants, the yield per acre maybe from 300 to
350 pounds per annum.
It is worthy of notice that the quagga
