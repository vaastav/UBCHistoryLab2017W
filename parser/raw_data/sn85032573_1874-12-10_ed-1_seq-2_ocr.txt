The experience of the past week has

grain to keep teams and stock alive i

Tho Topcka Wife Murder.
Ci.i:ai: Watku, Ks., Dec. o, '71.
I'mtok Eagi.k, Dear Sir: As you
have not any correspondent from this
ihe best part of Sedgwick county, 1
thought I would drop jou a few lines
to let you know how we are getting
along.
Our friend,. lohh Duuscomb, has left
Dr. Ashmore who murdered his
rtifo some lime ago in Topeka, b
-hooting her in the head, and who wa
iflerwards captured in the wilds ot
Texas, and who got a change of venue
to Uurlingame, Osage county, wa
loiiud guilty of murder in the first de
gree last week and sent to the peniten
tiary to await his execution which un
der our law will never occur. Tin
murder was most brutal and the exe
cution in all righteousness shuld havi
been speedy and would have been bin
for the law.
The Topeka Commonwealth in a
seven column review goes for Auditoi
Wilder's report, allirming that it reads
tnd sounds more like the v.ily plead
ings of a politician than like a stat.
paper. We have not had time to re
view the report, but from what w.
have seen we fear Webb has gone a lit
tle outside of the record and the law
to make a ca-c. doing violence, to tin
political life and motives of sevcra
iioii who acted conscientiously and ti
ihe best of their ability we have no.
the least doubt. Webb was an editoi
loo long to confine him-elf to iniist
records and dry figures, hence, w.
suppose, his graceful pen pictures.
Mr. Secretary Delano, of the Inter
ior Department, has fiui-hed and pub
lished his report. Among his recom
mendations respecting public lauds i
one very sensible one for a law to pro
Icet our forests, lie advises a systen
of surveys that will establi-h thequau
i i ty ol pine or fir timber on eacl
-mallest subdivision of a .section, th.
appraisal of all such timber hind, am
Hs sale at appraised value. This wil
accomplish the double purpose of pre
venting a further waste of the forests
.mil of securing to the government :
largelv increased revenue.

gave my pony three ears of grasshop

away toward Spring Creek. When I
gained the "divide" overlooking
Spring Creek valley the sun was jus
sinking in the western prairie- am

u hich was rellecled bj the scattering
clouds in the west. The meauderiu;

ihe green wheal fields, the black soi
of tiie corn fields, and the newly bro
ken laud looked like an iiiitucn-i

As 1 looked upon this rich productivi
valley and thought how many such
there were iu soiithwe-tern ivan-a, I

Hid industrious, ate knocking at tin

Perhaps we were ready to say this is :
great country and an empire of itsell
and providence has caused this rid
-oil "to withhold its corrupting aliun
dance" for this once to remind u thai
ucaro not independent of our breth
ren of tl.e cast. When I arrived at
tho school house 1 found it crowded
with people who all seemed to be Irv
ing to talk taster and laugh loudci
than all the rc-t. Through the ceutei
of the house were two t-ibles piled
full of eatables. There was roast pig
and fried doughnuts, roasted turket
and fruitcake-, stewed chicken and
pyramid cakes, and cookie-, and
pickle-, and twenty-live other di-he-lhat

Caroltou, of Dry Creek, picked up a
us, jind we miss him very much to
keep the Eacsm: po-ied iu the affairs
of this locality, but on a trip to your
town wc find him snugly located iu
West. Wichita, with a full line ot goods
selling cheaper than the cheapest.
I5ut, Mr. F.Adr.i:, John is a boy that
will make his mark who. ever he
goes. Though wc miss him very much
at Clear Water, wc console ourselves
bv knowing lhatwc have an excellent
man iu his old stand, iu the person ot
Mr. (.'has. Cramer, who has a good
stock of groceries and dry goods, and
Charlie can dish them out too, to his
customers with about as much satis
faction, iu regard to prices, as anyone
else.
Charlie Ward also has a good stock
of groceries at Clear Water. Uoth ol
these gentlemen, (Mr. Ward, and Mr.
Cramer), are very accommodating, and
.ire doing a very good business, consid
ering the-e haul limes, and scarcity ol
money.
We need a hotel at Clear Water.
I'hc farmers iu general are in prettv
;ood spirit notwithstanding the
grasshoppers eat all of their crops. I
think wc can make it though with a
little assistance from the State Central
Aid Society, iu the way of getting
-omecorn to feed our stock, in order
io keep llieni able for spring work. We
nearly all have friends iu Iowa, and
eNewliere, who will contribute to om
.-clief, in the way of sending us grain,
out wc arc not able to pay the freight.
Wc formed a society this atternoon
for the purpose of asking assistance,
operating with the State Kclief So-i-iety.
Nearly all of us have food plcutv for
ourselves, what we lack most is food
for our stock. We have new settlers
oming in fulling up the places ot
those who got scared by the grasshop
pers. The citizens themselves have a con
siderable emigration in the way of bov
.abics, for this reason I think this lo
cality, and Wichita should be on verv
joud terms, as Wichita can't produce
my thing but girl babies.
The grange spirit is not dead here.
A'e are still taking in new nicinbcis
uto the grange.
As this is my first letter, I will not be
oo lengthy, but if it is worthy of your
loiieeyou shall hear from me again.

We succeeded in gotting it released,

Iu most of the foregoing counties
more or less wheat was raised, but wa
vcry unevenly distributed.
Homesteaders depended largely up
on the corn crop and vegetables,
which were destroyed. The failure ot
corn, the principal food for domestic
iiiimals in the state, has necessitated
ihe feeding for wheat; in addition to
this, there lias been a large increase in
Wichita. Ks., Nov. 27, 1874.
We reached this youthful city last
night iu a storm of sleet and snow
that was anything but agreeable, and
which failed to impress us with a be
lief that we were in a tropical region.
We hud to be constantly reminded we
were iu in south Kansas, where the
balmy breeze- blow and the sun is ev
er shining. The storm to-day equals
au thing we have had up north, and
Ihe snow is several inches deep, ll
brings to the minds of Vermonters re
membrances of the Green mountains,
to Iowa men it looks like Iowa, and
Michicau settlers think they are at
home. Hut then the like vvas never
seen before. The memory ot tlfc old
est inhabitant, the first squatter, runs
not back to the time when such a
storm occurred.
We are well pleased with the busv
little city, and somewhat surprised at
the solididy and worth of the
blocks of business houses, &c, that
make up the streets. The citizens
seem to be fully impressed with the
notion that they have a lull-fledged
city, if it isn't as long as New York or
as broad as PliiholJj)l"r-a. Their po
lice force is as wisHMflfganized and ef
lectivc as that of their big sisters, and
law and order is maintained at all haz
ards. Indeed, the absence of rows and
disorderly conduct is a matter ol won
der to those knowing the location of
Wichita and the character of many ot
it citizens, and who are pre tared to
encounter deeds of violence.
We found the Eagi.i: spreading its
wings prutertingly over the town, and
the Murdocks happy iu the possess
ion of the bird. They have a good,
wcll-furuished office, and conduct a
No. 1 paper, a credit to the town am'
coil u try. We al-o met Mr. Gable, the
gentlemanly editor of the Beacon,
which is also an excellent newspaper.
Uoth journals arc Republican, and
Wichita is fortunate in possessing two
such papers.
W. E. Stanley, Esq., so well known
io many of she JmU-pemlcut readers,
is right at home here, and is now
''resting upon his l.iurels," having, af
ter a hard light, been elected to the of
lice of county attorney. He gained a
greet deal in popular favor by his
manly way of conducting the cam
paign, and seeins to be on the high
way to success and fortune. May he
reach it.
Wichita is located on the Arkansas
river, 212 miles from Alchisun, bv
rail, about -l.'t wiles from the southern
line of the stale, and is the terminus ol
one branch of the A. T.& S. P. rail
