FORAKER SLAPS
AT PRESIDENT
IN SENATE BILL
Seizes JVlessage on Brownsville
Affair as Pretext lor Attack
on Executive
Would Take Case Out of Hands
of Administration and Give
It to Special Tribunal
Congress Urged From White
House to Reinstate Soldiers
-f Who Confess
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.—Sen
ator Foraker today intro- '
duced an amendment to the
bill providing for the re-en
listment of the negro troops discharged
\u25a0without honor because of alleged par
ticipation in the affray at Browns
villa and addressed the senate con
cerning the amendment. He proposed
in his new measure to establish a
tribunal consisting of retired army
officers before whom evidence might
be submitted as to the guilt of the de
fendants and before whom the de
fendants themselves might appear to
answer to charges. The measure was
fo drawn as practically to take the
matter out of the hands of the execu
tive and to give a tribunal appointed
l>y congress full authority io consider
i lie Brownsville questions and by Its
lindings provide for the re-enlistment
of the discharged negroes.
Object to Sleuths
In addressing the senate Foraker
raid that during the summer letters
lsad been coming to him from these
discharged negro soldiers declaring that
detectives were constantly engaging
them in conversation. The senator
of the activities of the detectives
as outlined by his correspondents, say
ing that in many cases they went so
far as to take up their dwelling with
the discharged soldiers for the purpose
of .securing their confidence and spying
upon their movements.
\u25a0H?"Spproveil ferreting^crtiT "in*?* f acTsT
but declared that there was a right way
to do it.
Upon the conclusion of Foraker's re
marks, Culberson asked that the presi
dent's message on the Brownsville af
fair be read, and Vice President Fair
banks directed it be done. All the sena
tors present remained in their seats
and much interest was shown in the
document.
Senator Foraker took .the floor as
soon as the prcsidenrs message and
the accompanying reports had been
read. lie read a letter from Boyd
Conyers, a discharged soldier, who is
alleged to have made a confession to
Detective Lawson.
Scores Detective
In his letter Conyers speaks of the
visit of Lawson to Monroe, Ga., where
Conyers has been living. • Conyers
pays he learned that Lawson was
there to "pick" him and that he had
the "high sheriff" arrest Lawson. As
Lawson had not had an opportunity to
have a. private talk with Conyers, ac
cording to the latter's letter, it made
him angry and Conyers says Lawson
"told lies" to the sheriff about him.
Foraker referred caustically to the
negro detective, calling attention, to
"his high sounding, smooth, logical re
port, signed with his mark," and then
added:
*'Ob, Mr. President, when this thing
ix gone to the bottom of, all honest
men will be ashamed of it."
Foraker said that the president's
statement concerning this investigation
by detectives' showed the propriety of
adopting such a provision as that em
bodied in his amendment •
' "It seems to me," he said, "that one
of the worst features of this whole un
fortunate business is that this man
should now be pursued In this way by
secret service detectives In the manner
I have described."
Senator Foraker read a letter he had
written to Conyers, in which he said
he would "look after the detectives
who .are visiting him."
"That promise will be made good,"
declared Foraker.
Create a Tribunal
"Enough has been shown to make it
the imperative duty of the senate to
create a tribunal before \u25a0which men
«an go and receive a hearing. Is there
anything more atrocious than this case
against these men? This is the sixth
time they have been put on trial and
five times they have been acquitted in
my opinion."
Forakcr concluded by declaring that
the president's statement that the es
pionage against -the soldiers of the
Twenty-fifth regiment would be con
' tinned was additional reason for prompt
action by the senate.
President's Message
In his message to. the senate Presi
dent Roosevelt said in part:

*( Cretary of war/transmitting a report

NAVY CRITICS
ARE SCORED BY
FIGHTING BOB
Evans Says Latest American
YVarships Are Superior to
England's Dreadnought
Asserts Uncle Sam's Fleet Could
Never Be Compared With De
feated Russian Ships
ReuterdahTs Criticisms , Are
Separately Refuted; by
Noted Admiral r
XEW YORK,. Dcei 14J— "Of i»ll the In
acvarate and mlsleiulliij; Mut rmrndt fii
this wonderful Reuterdahl ertilclum,"
says Admiral" Robley •d! Evans, \u25a0 "the
iuottt incorrect in that the buttlesni}** of
the United State* are exactly the Manic
as .were the Russian Kbip* after the
Huwso-.Jaiiaue.se light In tl'e nea' of
Japan— not temporarily but permanent
ly
••I assert that the battle fleet of the
United Mates never was and never will
be, i never can be in the condition of
that Russian fleet when it went into
action for the last time."
That the latest battleships built by
this country are vastly superior to
England's Dreadnought is also emphat
ically insisted upon by the admiral in
an article written by him wherein he
strongly defends the American navy
and replies to criticisms of it made
some ago by Henry Reuterdahl and
others.
"I do not for a moment claim. that the
Indiana and her sister ships are equal
"to the Dreadnought *ofr the English
navy," says Admiral Evans, "only that
she is the equal of the English ships
designed at the same time. But, I do
claim that our latest ships^are .vastly
superior to the Dreadnought and I be
lieve that every fighting man Who has
given the subject intelligent considera
tion will agree with^me.",-
Big Guns Superior
Evans urges' the .superiority
of the 13 inch'gun'oVer tlie 12 inch gun.
and asserts that the change to the
lesser caliber to conform to' England's
type was a most serious blunder.- This
is changeable, he says, to the sea going
ofHcers of the navy, and not to any staff
corp?. Regarding the water line armor
belt he said:
"I am sure, after many weeks ; of
close observation, that the lower edge
of the armor belt is too" high rather
than too low." . .. .
It had been strenuously contended by
critics that the low location of the^belt
was a vital point of weakness.
"As the upper edge of the belt is al
ways even with or above the level of
the protective belt," continues Admiral
Evans, "the danger to be apprehended
from a projectile penetrating above the
belt, beyond the wrecking effect of such
projectile, is that due to the amount of
water that may enter the hole.
Damage Improbable ;
"It is {he damage. that may be done
by such prqjectiles entering below that
may cause the, ship to sink by explod
ing; magazines or boilers, but this is
jmprofcable. It will require many^ 12
inch shells. on the water line, or on any
other, to disable or sink such a ship if
the officers and'menknow their busi
ness and want to fight."
Admiral Evewis declares the statement
"that a wound on a turret may disable
tlie turret's guns" is absolutely inac
curate, unless by "wound" penetration
is meant. . •
The leading, features in battleships'
designs. Admiral Evans concludes,- are
the battery, the armor protection and
the motive power. \ V>v:
- Any one of these unduly sacrificed in
favor of the other means weakening of
tlie lighting machine. '

Though the "announcement, in Tokyo

through a; long series .of negotiations
between Secretary Root and Baron Tak

Mrs. Ada Long McCormick, daughter
of James M. Long, the millionaire syrup
refiner of this city, once th« guest of
"Whltelaw Reid -when Reid was United
States "minister to France; successively
a prominent belle of San Francisco, St.
Louis, Denver, Paris or wherever she
might be, slept last night under an as
sumed, name in a bare, barred' cell for
the detention of insane patients in the
central emergency hospital. She is
about to be examined regarding her
sanity.
At one time she was the sensation
of Parisian circles. According to her
first husband, Joseph Vincent, general
manager of the Colorado syrup com
pany of Denver, she ruined him finan
cially. "It cost me $200,000 to learn
that she and I were not mated." he said
yesterday, and added ungallantly, "she
was a beautiful woman, but I always
felt that she would end badly. She was
\u25a0 - - •-\u25a0 -. i - - \u25a0 \u25a0 . \u25a0
too fast for me."
BeJLated Prophecy"
~" There seemed a sorry touch of belated
prophecy, in the former husband's
words. While the woman, who in s llka
and jewels once conquered as an In
ternational queen of beauty wherever
her gay path led, rests on a hard, cold
cot in. the rough ward of the detention
hospital for the insane, her second, and
present husband,- Joseph McCormick, a
waiter by occupation, \u25a0 moans in a char
ity ward at the of Califor
nia hospital, south of the park, suffer
ing most intense pain from an ugly
knife wound in the thigh, inflicted by
his wife, Mrs. Ada Long Vincent-Mc-
Cormick.
And at .the same time Mrs. McCor
mick's elder son, Madison Vincent, her
one champion of all her , broad court,
whose father was 12 years ago di
vorced ,by the mother, was at the
proud Long home, -2647 Pierce street, a
supplicant in the cause of his wretched
parent, who once was the beautiful cen
ter of the family circle.
>. From .Denver, the former home^of
the young woman, there came yester
day news of an exciting career which
Mrs. McCormick had in that city.
Mother of Two Sons
She is the mother of two children,
Madison, the manly lad of 16, who
has been the , champion of the mother
here, and. Harry, who Is now in Den
ver. They are the sons of Mrs. Mc-
Cormick's first husband, Joseph Vin
cent. The couple secured a legal sep
aration twelve years \u25a0 ago and after
that Vincent - showed great bitterness
toward the. woman. Vincent has since
remarried.'
r It was also .reported that at one
time; she shot at a man who, she said,
had /insulted > her.
The accident which affected Mrs.
McCormick's •; brain occurred on t July
'27,-1906, at Denver. That was before
she had met McCormick .and was liv
ing.' In the Colorado city on ..remit
tances from her family. - To prove the
bitterness ;6f her first husband at- the
time ofvthe accident, which it 'was
thought; .would terminate fatally,
word.was sent to- him concerning his
former wife and ' he was asked v if he
would not come to see her before she
died*' '
.."I'll not go; to : see her until she is
a corpse," Vincent is quoted as saying.
Released on Bail
Captain of . Detectives, James Kelly
released. Mrs.' McCormick from, detinue
at the city prison yesterday morning,
her bond of >100 still standing. Cap
tain^ Kelly \u25a0 said that he learned, that
McCormick : \- would .not prosecute her
and "Jthat'lt was possible that 1 the stab

William McDonough Held in
Custody on Prison Ship at
Mare Island
Disappears From the Missouri
in China and Makes Way to
San Francisco
Fails to Comply With Regula
tions of Service and Alust
Face Charges
WILLIAM McDQNOUGH. pay
clerk of the battleship Mis
souri, Is held In irons on the
prison ship Manila at Mare
island because he thought more
of his sweetheart than he did of
his job. It was in far off Amoy on the
Chinese coast that McDonough decided
to cut away from the life on the sea
and to join the girl who had waved
him goodby when the fleet sailed from
San Francisco. In his haste to return
the young official cast to the winds the
strict regulations of the service and
reached San Francisco only to be ar
rested as a deserter. Before he could
communicate with the young girl who
awaited his coming he was put in irons
and under orders from Washington he
was sent last night to the prison ship
at the navy yard.
McDonough is prominently- connected
in the east and came to San Francisco
with the fleet with letters to people pi
consequence in the commercial as*!,so
cial life'of the cityl. He attended "many
of the dances and receptions given In
honor of the visitors, and before he left
he had secured the promise of one of
the girls he had met that she would
become his wife. Her name he refused
yesterday to reveal. -
Returns to Claim Bride
'The celebrations at ' Honolulu, and the
ports of Australia held out but «m»n
pleasure for McDonough, for his
thoughts were of San Francisco. It waa
during the festivities at Amoy, China,
that, he resolved to risk all to return
and claim his bride. There was a con
cert on board, ana from the brass
throats of the instruments came the
familiar rhythm of The Girl I Left Be
hind Me." It had a new message for
the pay clerk.
That night he wrote out his resigna
tion. Then he joined one of the launch
parties to the shore. The next day the
formal letter of withdrawal from the
service was found on his desk. Mc-
Donough had disappeared. An examina
tion was made of his accounts, but
no irregularity has been charged. Then
it was learned from one of McDonough'a
comrades that he had often spoken of
leaving the ship to join his fiancee in
San Francisco.
Classed as Deserter
According to the rules of the depart
ment no officer may leave the service
until his resignation has been acted
upon. McDonough was therefore
classed as a deserter. Ort?ers \u25a0were
wired out from Washington to Tratch
every ship coming into San Francisco.
McDonough had made his way from
Amoy to Manila and had there taken
passage on the transport Thomas.
When the Thomas came into port he
was captured and placed under arrest,
lie Is said to have admitted that he
had returned to join his sweetheart. •
The young man was taken to the
navy yard by ' the . federal officials last
night and placed In irons on the prison
ship Manila. It- is believed that some
of his influential friends in the; east
will intercede in his behalf.
