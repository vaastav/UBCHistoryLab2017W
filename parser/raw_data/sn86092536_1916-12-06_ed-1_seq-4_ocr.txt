THE GREATER WRONG THAT IS IGNORED !
President Wilson in his agreeably short message to Congress lays stress j
?on rhe necessity for rhe passage of a corrupt practices act. regulating thej
?expenditure of money in elections, but it seem? to The Intelligencer rh.it <
^Senator Penrose's amendment to the Owen bill for federal supervision ofj
.national elections is seeking to correct a more grevious national scandal than \
that suggested by *h?- {'resident. The purpose of the Penrose amendment is ;
to secure the right of rhe negro to vote in the South. where ai present his
^suffrage privileges are suppressed. The Intelligencer recently called atten- '
'tion to this great injustice by which the Southern States are held stolidly in
the Democratic coiumn. The circumstances are familiar to all intelligent,
readers.
There was a great hue and cry raised by the managers of the Demo
.cratic Presidential campaign about the alleged importation of negroes from
the South for the purpose of being fraudulently voted in the close States, but
tJhere was no voice raised against the greater iniquity practiced in the South
where the negro voter is not allowed to exercise rights guaranteed him by
the constitution. In fact, the Southern Democracy terrorizes a part of its
white population. No law prevents a white man from voting the Republican
'ticket in the South, but public opinion restrains him. This outrageous condi
-lion^Jias established an advantage for every Democratic candidate for Presi
dent of 126 electoral votes, guaranteed him absolutely. The delivering of
these votes through an election is a mere matter of form, wholly perfunctory.
Mr. Wilson has professed to be very much concerned about "humanity."
and in an exalted moment after the election he plead for "justice with a heart
in it." Why, in the name of consistency, then, when he was asking for a
corrupt practices act did he not at the same time demand Justice for t.he
intimidated voter of the South? The answer is only too obvious. We do not
entertain any hope thai Senator Penrose's amendment will pass, for the'
South practically controls the Senate. But it seems that the time has arrived
for one of two things to be done. -These Southern States ought to b?- deprived
of a large number of electoral vote?. They have disfranchised the negro by
one process or another: yet the negro is counted as a vot?*r and a man in the
distribution of members of Congress and members of rh*- electoral college.
The South ought, not to have the benefit of the negro in making up their rep
resentation in Congress, or else rhey ought nut have power to disfranchise
him.
Here is a chance for President Wilson to put a great throbbing hear; in
justice, to give some slight evidence of the sincerity of his professed high
ideals. Will he do it? No. He always has and always will hit. the point of
least resistance: and. further, because he is in uo sense a statesman but in
?eTery sense- a mere politician.
AKIN TO INTIMIDATION
The current issue of the Railway
Age Gazette gives an interesting in
sight into the controversy before the
Interstate Commerce Commission
concerning the proposed rale to adopt
high power electric locomotive head
lights on fh>> railroads of the country.
There was such a conflict it: the tes
rimony with regard to the increased
safety and rhe increased danger that
, the Commission took the matter tinder
advisement without common:.. The in
teresting development in the case waa
the actioD of the Brotherhood of Lo
comotive Engineers in warning any ot
their members in testifying against
"the installation of such light under
pain of expulsion. It. was developed
during the hearing that such a provis
ion existed in the constitution of the
.brotherhood, which show3 a remark
able srate of affairs in that organiza
tion. One engineer, however, braved
'the wrath of the brotherhood provision
? who said that he had voluntarily come
'"to protect myself and rhe public
.against tho enforced use of a device
which means death.''
The counsel for the railroads scath- J
inely denounced the brotherhood con
stitution's provision providing that
"any member who Interferes with a
legislative matter being conducted by
the legislative board sha.ll be expelled.'
He called attention to the warnings
sent broadcast to engineers that they
f were subject to expulsion if they tes
tified, and cited the case of David
Trostle, an engineer who admitted un
der oath that, while he was waiting to
take the witness stand, Aionzo n. Park
assisrant chief Inspector on rhe gov
??rnm^nr staff of Frank McManaray.
had "reminded him of fhe brotherhood
rule that he ro?iM he expelled for in
terfering in legislative matters," even
within i Jit* hearing chaufber ot the in
terstate Commerce Commission.. With
the testimony of the brotherhood wit-]
n esses so directly contradictory of -rill j
the mass of testimony of engineers
f.nd others who testified of difficulties j
in vision through falsu color?, reflec
tions and blinding glare from the high
power lights, as produced by the rail
roads. the two could not be reconciled i
and it resolved itself into a matter of
the credibility of the witness, with re
gard to which the Commission has ve
served its decision. It was significant
that at the close of the hearing the
statement was made that the brother- j
hood chiefs, in expelling engineer- j
from membership for testifying to !
their belief that, the electric headlight.- ;
are dangerous, had violated the Fed- ,
eral penal code. which prescribes n ,
fine of sr>.(Vift and six years' 1mpris-j
onment for intimidation or wrongful j
influencing of witnesses in a proceed- i
ing before a United Stare? court or!
commissioner.
THE WORST YET TO COME j
If the Democratic party cherlslu s ?
?_ny idea that it is going to get away
with the claims made for the Undor
wood bill in the pre-election rnrapnlfrn
It is going to be badly fooled. Every
day fresh revelations are piling up
against its utter inefficiency. There
was a short test of the measure before j
the war. but the ^rorst is yet to come I

Britain's Problem in Egypt is Like Ours in the Philippines.
BY G. SCOTT DALG-LEISH
Former General .Manager of the A trri^'iiltu ra 1 Bank of Kjrypt.
I: i? extremely hard for the Occi
dental mind in clearly visualize condi
tions in i he Kast when the problem of
government "(if ibe people, by the peo
ple' 'is under discussion. The people
of a republic, where every man has,
i hemri't icallv ;? t least, a voice in ih<*
govern m?int of the country, fe^l a
natural impatience when they hear
of any d^lay in ibe procuring of sik-Ii
benefit for the people of other coun
tries.
A larK'"* number of people of this
country foel that they are untrue so
the principles upon which ibe great
ness of their own land was founded
if they do not hasten to enfranchise
th?"> Philippine Islanders and permit
them to rule themselves. This is ?i
perfectly laudable feeling. It has had
so exact a parallel in Egyptian history
of ihe last thirty years that, ene who
has had experience of the latter feols
impelled to discuss at least one feat
ure of the conditions affecting t his
question In that country.
When the English occupied Egypt,
Mr. Gladstone specifically stated that;
they would withdraw from the coun
try as soon as the Egyptians proved
themselves capable of conducting
their own affairs satisfactorily. This
declaration has been a constant, wea
pon in the arguments of the Egyptian
National Party. Few people realize
that in pursuance of this policy an
agreement was actually drawn up in
1SS7 under which England proposed
to withdraw her troops two years
later and to establish autonomy in
Egypt. It is fortunate for both coun
tries that this treaty with Turkey was
strangled at its birth by Turkish in
trigue. In all these years there has
constantly been a party In England
which has loudly sympathized with
the aspirations of the Nationalists
and has inveighed against the alleged
treason to Egypt in the continued Eng
lish occupation. What these people
have failed to realize is the absolute
incapacity for administration shown
by a people who have for tens of cen
turies been under the hell of various
alien rulers and administrators. The
ingrained habits of servility cannot
be thrown off in a few years, perhaps
not in a generation. While a nation
of serfs may produce one man or a
lew men of dominating character
from time to time, it cannot be ex
pected to produce a class of states
men. except after many years of trial
and error.
The Pharoahs claimed, not only
divine riuliC to rule, but absolute di
vinity. A striking evidence of their
consciousness of the inferiority .of
their subjects is found in the mural
paintmss and carvings on the walls
of t lie ancient temples. There the
stature of the Pharaoh is always
shown as several times greater than I
r that of (he attendant crowds of priests, ,
of soldiers and of fellahin. In later
'times 'ho power of the Pharaohs
passed u> strangers, and the country
itself never produced a ruling class.
I Even ill l heir linn'- ihe influence of
? the stranger ha ci been fell. Joseph,
jthe firs i Minister of Finance, _ was an
Israelite. I'haroah found in him,]
i though an alien and outcast blond, anj
i economic and administrative knowl-|
! ''due which he could nowhere discover j
[among his native ministers. After!
i he Assyrians, the Persians. thej
[(.reeks and the [lomHits, even ihe |
I.Mameluke, though descendants of;
slaves, yet ruled the country by sheer1
I force of character and warlike ability. J
From the sixteen century to t.he nine-,
teenth, amidst a succession of Turk*
i ish Pashas, we find no record of a j
[native Egyptian rising t> prominence. I
Mohamed All. who achieved for Egypt j
its semi-independence from Turkey.!
his grandson Ismail, who. despite the
economic depths to which he plunged
the country, is yet the founder of
modern Egypt, were Albanians. The
| latest of theid descendants, the pres
ent. Sultan, Ilassein Kamel, devoted
though he is to the interests or the
Egyptian Fellah, has no Egyptian
blood In his veins. Of all the out
standing ministers who have, aided in
making Egypt what she is today, onlyj
one, Mustapha Fehml, an upright, de
voted but somewhat, colorless char-|
acter, can be called a real Egyptian.
Kiaz Pasha, in some way the strong- 1
est. was a Turk. and. as such, in many j
ways reactionary and jealous in main
taining the dignity of the Pasha
class, almost all Turks also. Nubar
Pasha, founder of the Mixed Tribun
als, modern Egypt's one real states
man. was an Armenian. Poulros Ohali,
a Copt, as a reward for integrity and
disinterestedness, fell a victim to the
jbuller of a Mohamedan fanatic,
i When Ismail Pasha founded a par
liament along European lines and ex
I plained lo the assembled notables (he
lines of the party system with an
administration party and an opposi
tion party, they all automatically oc
cupied the administration benches,
| and no one could be found bold
, enough to form an opposition. It is
[a significant fact that, in spite of
I every encouragement, and after manv
[attempts, no purely Egyptian coni
| pany has ever lion able to conduct
commercial affairs satisfactorily. Till
j such knowledge has ronie their wav,
j how can the people hope to success

and strenuons business of Kovern- 1

wood law permitted those countries
to ger into our market to the tune of
S3-I9.000.ft00. making a balance of
trade against us of $12t>, 000,000. In
cluded in our exports were war ma
terials to the vahte of $12S.OOO,!'OU
which went to Russia in Asia, to which
normally we send about $1,000,000
worth of our products annually.
Without this stimulus to our export
trade, the traiie balance against us
would have been $253,000,000 In our
commercial relations with the Asiatic
division, and this does not take Into
consideration the fact that our export
trade to Japan was al9o increased by
reason of shipments of war supplies.
This gives just a little idea of how the
war is helping us ont, and it also
causes us to conclude that a return
io the protective tariff policy, whether
Mr. Wilson likes it or not. is advisable.
The imports from Asia will continue!
to increase, whil^ our war t ratio to!
that division must suffer a slump after'
the war. it Is confidently expected
that the '"opfn mind" of which Wood
row Wilson boaste will catch the pro
tective Id^a within the next two or
three years and the last bulwark of
Democratic opposition will have been,
broken down by Republican logic.

Back of I ho transmitter |
diaphragm of your Boll tele

drum partly filied with carbon
crushed to about the size of
granulated sugar. Here that
little drum is shown, with the
bar that holds it.
The function of the granu

diaphragm and send them out over ihe wires in
varying impulses. If I he telephone is held in your

will sound "far off" because the little granules fall
away from the diaphragm. Tf it is held above
your lips and you talk up to it. the little granules
"pack" against the diaphragm and your voice will
sound "muddy" and "thick" to the listener.
The Bell transmitter is designed for most
effective use. local and long distance alike, when
the telephone stand is resting on a flat, level sur
face. Yoyfctjn help to safeguard the high quality
of your ?ervfce by holding your telephone in that
