Gems From The Message.
There must t>e 110 abuse of the in
junction power, as it is implied in for
bidding laboring men to strive for their
bettermeut in peaceful and lawful ways
nor must the injunction be used mere
ly to aid some big corporation in carry
ing out schemes for its own aggrand
izement.
The judge who does thus disregard
public sentiment when it is wrong, who
brushes aside the pica of any special
interest when the pleading is not
founded on righteousness, performs
the highest service to the country.
Just and temperate criticism, when
necessary, is a safeguard agains't the
acceptance by the people as a whole of
that intemperate antagonism toward
the judiciary which must be combatted
by every right thinking man, and
which if it become wide spread among
the people at large, would constitute a
dire menace to the republic.
Let justice be both sure and safe;
and let it be justice under the law, and
not the wild and crooked savagery of a
mob.
Purveyors of sensational slander in
newspaper or magazine are the worst
enemies of all men who ore engaged
in an honest effort to better what is
in our social and governmental con
ditions.
The man who debauches others in
order to obtain a high office stands on
an evil quality of corruptions with the
man who debauches others for finan
cial profit.
The most damaging blow that can
be given popular government is to
elect an unworthy and sinister agitator
on a platform of violence and hypo
crisy.
The demagogue and corruptionist
often work hand in hand.
The triumph of the mob is just as
evil a thing as the triumph of the
plutocracy.
One of the most efficient methods of
averting the consequences of a dang
erous agitation, which is 80 per cent
wrong is to remedy the 20 per cent of
evil as to which the agitation is well
founded.
The effort to prohibit all combination
good or bad, is noxious where it is not
effective.
Combination of capital, like combin
ation of labor, is a necessary element
of our present industrial system.
The man of great wealth owes a
peculiar obligation to the state, be
cause he derives special advantages
from the mere existence of govern
ment.
It is probable that a thoroughly effic
ient system of education comes next
to the influence of patriotism in bring
ing about national success.
Education must seek to train the
executive powers of young people and
to confer more real significance upon
the phrase "dignity of labor."
No man, no woman, can shirk the
primary duties of life, whether for love
of ease aud pleasure, or for any other
cause, and retain his or her self re
spect.
It is wicked for a nation to regard
only its own interest, and foolish to be
lieve that such is the sole motive which
actuates any other nation.
It is the sure mark of a low civiliza
tion, a low morality, to abuse or dis
criminate against or in any way humil
iate such stranger who has come here
lawfully and who is conducting himself
properly.
Neither a nation or an individual
can surrender conscience into anothers
keeping.
A just war is, in the long run, far
better for a nation's soul than the most
prosperous peace obtained by acquiesc
ence in wrong or injustice.
It is morally as indefensible for a
nation to commit a wrong upon an
other nation, strong or weak, as for an
individual thus to wrong his fellow.
Shortage Made Good.
Captain F. E. Grimes, ex-state treas
urer, has voluntarily paid to the state
of Kansas the sum of $9,381 for which
amount an investigating committee
some time ago held his administration
responsible. The alleged shortage was
never considered in the light of a de
falcation in any sense of the word, and
resulted from practices that had been
the rule in the state treasurer's office
for many years before and after Mr.
Grimes assumed the office.
The investigation showed conclusively
that Mr. Grimes was not benefited in
any way through this practice in his
administration. Therefore, in making
a paymen', to the state now of the
amount involved he has, in an effort
to clear hia administration, assumed a
responsibility at a personal loss. On
the check with which he paid the
alleged shortage Mr. Grimes wrote
these words:
Ji" Victim >f circumstances."

Special Message.
A special message on the Japanese
question and the California school
problem supplementary to the discus
sion of these same subjects by Presi
dent Roosevelt in his regular message,
will be sent to congress from the
White House next Tuesday. It is
stated authoritatively that this spec
ial message will be more vigorous in
tone than the former communication
and will not be calculated to cool the
indignation of Californians previously
aroused.
The special message, moreover, aside
from its local application, will be one
of the most important communications
in the entire list of those sent to con
gress by the present executive. It
will bring to a direct issue the cen
tralization of government which is
likely to form the climax of endeavor
on the part of the Roosevelt adminis
tration.
The administration is about to take
advanced ground regarding the doc
trine of federal supremacy over state
sovereignty. The Japanese question
raised in connection with the public
schools of California has* supplied the
opportunity to give forcible expression
to the mighty scheme of centralization
that is to be perfected if possible.
It is not possible at this writing to
forecast in detail what the president
will say in his second message on the
Japanese question. Accompanying his
message which it is understood will
be a full explanation of the adminis
tration's projected policy as to the
supremacy of federal over state power
; will be the report of the special inves
tigation of the San Francisco school
question, made by Secretary of Com
merce and Labor Metcalf. Regardless
of the nature of this report, the pres
ident will adhere vigorously to the t
position taken by him in his regular
message, which was written before he
left Washington to visit the canal
zone, and before he had anything at
all from Secretary Metcalf.
But as to the Metcalf report, it has
been learned that its author found
much to condemn in the matter of the
treatment of Japanese outside of the
school question. His report, in fact,
will furnish a new sensation. It will
show, it is understood, labor union ty
ranny over Japanese which affects the
rights held to be theirs by treaty in
even more pronounced manner than
anything connected with the school
embroglio.
Matters of this nature embraced in
Secretary Metcalf's report will furnish
the key for many arguments to be ad
vanced by the president in his message.

Hill May Build One More Railway.
James J. Hill is now reported to
be planning for a road, connecting the
line from Wenatchee to Oroville with
the Portland and Seattle road at Pasco.
It is also stated that this branch of
about 100 miles will be completed be
fore the line of the Chicago, Milwaukee
& St. Paul reaches the coast.
This would complete the missing
link in the Hill system and would give
the Great Northern a new outlet to
the tide water for eastern and central
Washington without being obliged to
haul all goods over the Cascade range.
The Great Northern Railway com
pany recently gave notice of a new
' issue of stock of $60,000,000. This is to
be used in betterments and in the
building of new lines. Now that the
work of the branch from Wenatchee
up the Columbia into the Okanogan
region has been assured, it is reported
that indications point to the final link
in this road being built promptly.
According to the theory set forth
here the new road would start near
where the main line crosses the Colum
bia river, running down the east bank
of the river to Crab creek and Sentinel
Bluffs and the new town of Milwau
kee, started by Tacoma people, then
by Priest rapids and the property of the
Hanford irrigation district and past
White Bluffs to Pasco where it would
connect with the Portland and Seattle
line.
This would enable the road to drain
the resources of the Okanogan, Chelan,
Douglas and Kittitas counties and
to haul its freight by water grade to
the coast. The grade for such a road
it is claimed might be less than one
half of one per cent and would save
the present expensive hauls, besides
developing a new country and giving
it almost exclusively to the Great
Northern system.
The road, it is estimated, would be
about 100 miles long and might cost
in the neighborhood of $6,000,000.

"And There Was No Room for
Them in the Inn."
By G. A. DAVIS.
A little cry goes shivering It is Thine image only,â€”
Between the night and morn,â€” The likeness of the Son,
The holy night of wonder, Whose home was Mary's bosom,
When God on earth was born; The Sole-begotten One;
A shadow in the darkness Thine image, marred and broken,
Across the lighted paneâ€” Born of the world's long sin,
This is Thy time, 0 Son of Man, and That wanders wide t his ChHstmas
hast Thou come again? night, and no man takes it in.
Thy crownless head in Bethlehem
Lay in the manger poor;
For Thee no fire was lighted,
There swung no open door;
O'er all Judea's hillsides,
In all her cities fair,
There was no room save one poor
stall for David's Lord and Heir!
And still the child and mother, They hear from echoing belfries
By many a weary way, The first glad tidings rung,
Through ages lost and lonely, And 'round God's shining altars
Go wandering far astrayâ€” Christ's praise in splendor sung,
Homeless, by red-lit windows, They crouch athirst and hungered,
Where children 'round the knee They knock and are denied-
Crowd close to hear of Him who And outcast as of old, they keep the
came a Babe in Galilee. world's great Christmas-tide.
Thou, child, who borest earth's sorrows,
We give Thee, as we gave,
Only the bitter bread of tears,
Only the cross and grave!
But Thou, 0 son of Mary,
In that Thy Day of Doom,
Shalt hold the shining gates of Heaven
Where we would fain find room;
Grant us, O Judge tremendous,
When we as outcasts stand,
To see beside an open door the stretching
of Thy Hand!
Grocers to Ask New Laws.
The Washington Retail Grocers' As
sociation will ask the next legislature
to pass a new pure food law; require
manufacturers to stamp all package
goods with the actual quantity provid
ed and to provide a new exemption law,
states a coast report. The legislative
committee of the Grocers' Association
has been meeting in Seattle to prepare
these measures.
Conflicts between the federal pure
food statue and the pure food law of
this state are said by the grocers to
lead to much confusion. Under one
act all the goods shipped in from out
side points are affected and under the
state law the manufacturers of this
state are liable.
It is believed by the grocers that if
the provisions of tne national pure food
act are followed bv the legislature of
this state, confusion can be done away
with and a much stronger statue given.
The state pure food law is said to be
weaker than the federal statute.
The demand that all packages be
plainly marked with the quantity of
goods contained grows out of a practice
on the part of some manufacturers of
providing short weights. The claim is
not actually made that the package
goods contain certain quantities, but
the impression is given to the public.
Crackers, cereal foods and similar prod
ucts are said to be sold commonly in
short weight packages.
The grocers want a clearer definition
of the exemption law so as to fully
cover all cases. The plans of the.asso
ciation have not been worked oat for
that statute.

is to increase the attendance at the
college to 2000 students, through the
efforts of the student body. The total
