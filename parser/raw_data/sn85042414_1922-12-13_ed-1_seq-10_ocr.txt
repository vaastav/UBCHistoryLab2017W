"Well, I'm going up." ahe said, suddenly. "Good night."
She had come up behind him,and he felt her bare arrti across his back.

Disgusted, he shut his ears to the half sentences that came his way. He
gathered that Katherine was exploiting his coldness to her in order to keep

were not etnoufrh.
"If yop enjoy being a little better oft than your acquaintances, why didn't

play time rather than work time in

complaint about the on-utility of
manual training or about cooking and

rudiments of the trade.
In vocational training there is of

A large part of the tazpaying pub
lic, both country and city, feels, that
manual training is largely a waste of
time and money. A similar view is
taken in regard to domestic science.
The plain truth of the case Is that
there is in many Instances too much
cause for complaint. The complaint
comes largely, however, from the rur
al consolidated and from the smaller
town schools. Here especially, boys
and girls, do. not get clear ideas, on
the subjects they study and supposed

it behind the stove. The next evening

Chicago. Dec. IS.'—Influenced .by a
fresh upturn In sterling exchange, the
wheat market here averaged higher dur
ing the early dealings. All deliveries
touched a new high price record for th'e
season. A trade review dwelling on
shortage in world production of wheat
as compared with last year Induced con
siderable buying, but was partly offset
by forecasts of snow or rain for the en
tire domestic grain belt./ Opening quo
tations, which ranged from to
higher, with May 1.21% to 1.22 and July
1.12% to 1.1-2%, were followed, by mod
erate further gains.
Corn and oats climbed with Wheat,
May and July corn reaching the top
most figures yet this season. After
opening unchanged to higher, 71% to
27, the corn market scored upturns all
around.
Oats started
unchanged
to off. May
46*, and latter showed, a substantial
general advance.
Provisions were bearishly affected by
weakness of hog values.
Wheat: Subsequently, purchasing on
a broad scale developed, and the mar
ket showed power to rally quickly from
minor reactions due. to profit taking on
the part of holders. The close was un
settled 1% to 2* net higher, with May
1.23tf to 1.23% and July 1.14J4 to
Cork: Free buying on the part of
houses with eastern connections
brought about further advances later.
The close was firm, to 1% net high
er, with May 73% to 73%.
