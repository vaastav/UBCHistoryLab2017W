yesterday morning, when a white chap
entered, and was in tbe act of cutting
one of the . negro's pockets out of his
pants with a "clip ring" which he wore,
and with a view of stealing the money
therein. United States detective Kintzler

of police, civilians, niggers, boys, and

Market and Jefferson streets, in an! old
sali warehouse. But salt didn't save

John P. Reid, Jr., was acquitted at
Bedford, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, of
tbe charge of killing Crouse,' a Provost
Marshal. Reid is a prominent Demo
crat, and he bore the insults of the tool
of Stanton for weeks, but when Crouse
resorted to blows he could stand it no
longer, and shot bim dead. If I ever
there was a just verdict, this is one.
Yineenne Sun. j: j l-
We have no doubt he was tried before
a copperhead Judge by a copperhead
jury. Of course they would approve
v the killing of a Provost Marshal or any
other loyal man. ' " '-' j

Snort Speech by Mr- Colfax
Hon. Mr. Cessna, Chairman of the
Pennsylvania Union State Committee,
in company with about twenty members
of it, called upon Hon. Schuyler Colfax
to night, and presented tbe resolutions
which had been vnanimously adopted by
the committee, approving the sentiments
enunciated in bis speecn ueiiverea in
Washington three weeks ago. . . ,
Mr. Cessna, in tbe eourse of his re
marks, said they had watched the course
of Mr. Colfax in Congress with a great
deal of interest and confidence, and ex
pressed gratification that it was indorsed
by his fellow members, and that be was
destined again to fill the Speaker's
chair, the duties of which he bad dis
charged with so much efficiency and
noDularitv..
Mr. Colfax, in reply, said the regard
and confidence of his own constituents
were always highly prized and appre
ciated bv bim: but when the represent
atives of the Union party of a' great
State like that of Pennsylvania tendered
such hearty manifestations of approval,
there was additional canse of gratitude
and thankfulness. In 1564. at tbe time
the soil of the Republic was shaken by
tbe tread of contending armies, and tbe
defenders of tbe Union cause encoun
tered all the prejudices growing out of
taxation, accumulating debt, and tbe
draft filled the hearts of every person:
when the great State of Pennsylvania
gave ber electoral votes for tbe distin
guished patriots, Lincoln and Johnson,
and again this morning, when Pennsyl
vania, with the adjoining States cf New
York and New Jersey, re-affirmed so
decisively their attachment to the great
cause, it gave renewed hope to all those
who had been faithful to the Union in
its peril.
Mr. Colfax said in conclusion that the
soldiers of the Republic had done their
share in the great work of putting down
the rebellion, and the spirit which ani
mated it now remained for the Senators
and Representatives of the people with
statesmanship and fileiity to the Union
and to tbe principles of liberty and hu
manity to complete tbe work now in
trusted to their bands. He rejoiced
that every indication gave promise that
they would shoulder to shoulder unite
inflexibly in tbs path of du ty.
