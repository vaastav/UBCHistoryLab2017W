Cheapest Remedy Made at Home128 TeaspoonsM for 25 Cents.
The first 300 persons calling at Bar
ker's Drug Store will be entitled to a
regular 50c bottle of Schiffmann's
New Concentrated Expectorant for
half price (25c) by presenting the
coupon below, properly signed. With
a view to giving those who have not
yet used this new excellent remedy
an opportunity of trying it, in the
treatment of Bronchial affections, in
cluding Bronchitis, Whooping Cough,
Croup, Severe Coughs, Colds and
Hoarseness, to prove its merits, these
druggists are willing to allow the
public the profit which they would
otherwise make and the proprietor is
willing to lose money on the same,
so as to give them an opportunity of
trying it, at partially their expense,
knowing it will be found the best
medicine ever used by anyone.
Even though not in need of a
Cough or Cold Medicine at the pres
ent time, it will pay to buy now, as
some such medicine is sure to be re
quired before the winter is over, but
this remedy cannot be obtained at less
than full price again. Besides making
this reduction these druggists guar
antee this remedy yust the same as
Dr. Schiffmann's famous Asthmador,
and will return the money in every

single instance if it does not give per
fect satisfaction and even moreif it
is not found the best remedy ever
used for any of the above complaints.
This excellent remedy is sufficiently
concentrated so that 50 cents' worth,
when mixed at home, with simply one
pint of granulated sugar and one-half
pint of water (according to printed
directions) makes a whole family sup
ply (128 teaspoonsful) while bottles
of the old, regular, ready-made kinds,
of doubtful inert, and without a
guarantee, usually average 20 to 32
teaspoonsful.
It is prepared from strictly harm
less plants, contains absolutely no
chloroform, opium, morphine or any
narcotic or injurious drugs which do
most cough remedies, and can there
fore be given to children with perfect
safety. It is pleasant to take and
children are fond of it. Besides ab
solutely no risk is run in buying this
remedy whatever, on the guarantee of
the above, well-known, reliable drug
gists who will refund your 25c if it
is not found the best remedy ever
used.
If a neighbor or friend could be in
duced to divide and pay for half the
quantity, the cost would thus only be
about 12c to each.

sensations, his only needs being sleep and enough
food to nourish his gigantic body.
A monster that stands upright and throws its
herculean strength into a yoke that drags a heavy
plow, His mind gone and in abject terror of his masters,
he does their bidding as a beast of burden. But,
sometimes when the lash sings round his ears,

EDITH WYNNE MATHISON.
"The Governor's Lady," which
will be shown at the Grand theater
tonight is the story of two young peo
ple in the humblest stations of life,
who are strongly devoted to each
other. They become wealthy and the
husband ambitious, later wishing to
divorce his wife whom he thinks is
standing in his way. How the faith
ful wife spoils his schemes through
simple wifely honesty and finally
takes her place as the Governor's
Lady, makes the story of unusual in
terest and appeal. The play is an
American story of Americans in
which we see the finest type of Am

they are in real life. Miss Edith

where they are as yet undeveloped
done to open the arteries of trade
Where the currents have not yet

the two American continents, where
they are, singularly enough, yet to
be created and quickened.
"There is another matter which
seems to me to be very intimately
associated with the question of na
tional safety and preparation for de
fense. That is our policy towards the
Philippines and the people of Porto
Rico. Our treatment of them and
their attitude towards us are mani
festly of the first consequence in the
development of our duties in the
world and in getting a free hand to
perform those duties. We must be
free from every unnecessary burden
or embarrassement and there is no
better way to be clear of embarrass
ment than to fulfill our promises and
promote the interests of those de
pendent on us to the utmost.
"I have spoken to you today, gen
tlemen, upon a single theme, the
thorough preparation of the nation
to care for its own security and to
make sure of entire freedom to play
J&%inipartial role in this hemisphere
vSAd in the world which we all be
lieve to have been providentially as
signed to it. I have had in my mind
no thought of any immediate or par
ticular danger arising but of our re
lations with other nations. We are
at peace with all the nations of the
world, and there is reason to hope
that no question in controversy be
tween this and other governments
will lead to any serious breach of
amicable relations, grave as some
differences of attitude and policy
have been and may yet turn out to be.
"For what we are seeking now,
what in my mind is the single
thought of this message, is national
efficiency and security. We serve a
great nation. We should serve it in
the spirit of its peculiar genius. It
is the genius of common men for self
government, industry, justice, liberty
and peace. We should see to it that
it lacks no instrument, no facility or
vigor of law, to make it sufficient to
play its part with energy, safety and
assured success. In this we are no
partisans but heralds and prophets
of a new age."

IF YOU WANT A GOOD FARM
Why Not Buy It Direct From the Owner
There is some satisfaction in knowing that only
one man can get a "rakeoff" if you deal with the
man who owns the land he wants to sell. You
will spend less time, that is wasted time, by
being taken direct to the property he has
for sale. I have 240 acres of the best
land in the county, located on the
"Divide", three miles east of Hines
and four miles from Blackduck.
Twenty-five acres in hay and
crops and sixty acres
seeded to clo and
timothy grasses.
