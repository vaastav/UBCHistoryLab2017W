The House Committees.
rrha .nnntinrament of the -
t f the House of Representatives on
Friday, gave rise to the usual amount
of grumbling, some members having
a hiirher opinion of their merits than
seems to be entertained in other quar
ters. New England has seven impor
tnt chairmanships, including the Ju
AMarv. The Middle States have ten
chairmanships, the most important
...v.-i. 1r1.ot.inn.q- The west nas
nineteen, in which are Appropriations,
Trifle Railroads. Indian and Foreign
Afiairs. The South has eight, inclu
ding Banking and Currency. The
-t,to .ni Mnana Committee contains
fiv nflts old members Dawes, Kel
lev. Burchard. Roberta and Beck. On
the Committee on Appropriations are
the old members Garfield, Kale,
Maine; Marshall and Swan. Of the
new members, Wheeler is the strong
est. Maynard's appointment as chair
man of Rankine and Currency, occa-
ainnacTeat surprise. Mr. Packer,
Pennsylvania, gets the chairmanship
of the Committee on Postoffices. The
Committee on Commerce has but two
members living on the seacoast. Mr.
Mvor. of PennsvlvanuLgoes on Private
Kcnfield retains the
UtlUU ,aua.ut?a
chairmanship of Naval Affairs. Orth,
nf Indiana, is chairman of Foreign Af
fairs. McCrary, of Iowa, late Chair

Railways and Canals. It is under

trusted with the subject of transporta
tion -nniM to the sea coast. Butler
takes the Judiciary Committee,

not like the selection of Wood, as ihe
Democratic standard bearer. It is
Ttainocratic. but that is a liih too
much. It says:
The electioh of Wood as tbeir leader

Taken as a whole the present is per
haps, the ablest message yet delivered
by President Grant. There is no effort
at rhetoric, but the document is terse
and compact, and expresses clearly and
intelligently the thoughts and opinions
sought to be conveyed. It will well
repay careful perusal. Wucago Inter-
Uoean.
The President's message, like all his
published declarations, confirms the
impression of his desire to do what he
considers best for the general good and
leaves unaffected the impression that in
the discussion of the financial and eco
nomical questions he simply repeats the
views of certain of his counsellors, lie
is a patriotic and honest Executive,
and popular confidence in him is still

determined tnerefore. when the trans-
fer trade should be superceded by the
new bridge, not to be like Othella with-
out an occupation, so made strenuous
persevering efforts to attract man-
ufacfuring capital. The wisdom of their
foresight has been justified by the re-
suits. A great Nail mill and furnace,
numerous glass factories, besides minor
industries have risen like magic, and
wherever located have drawn after
them population, stimulated building
and in every way advanced
the importance of the place. Water
and gas works have been built,
and in all the appointments which
characterize a city, she is far ahead or
many older and larger towns. We pre-
sent this morning such notices of her!
specialties as we were enabled to make
during a lew nours' visit one uay inst

THE BELMONT GLASS WORKS.
are the Pioneers of her manufacturing
interests and are situated on tne west
side of the town. They were built by
Rarnes and Fauoel in 1866. and their
specialities were table ware and lamps.
The firm conducted the business witn
until the close of 1868. when
joint stock company were formed, un
der wnose auspices operations xiave
continued since Jan., 1869. Up to the
close of 1872 the profits of the business
was verv large, uv tne iuqicioub ex
penditure of their surplus the product
ive capacity of the works has been
made commensurate wun its great
trade. The company give employ
ment to one hundred and fifty-five per
sons; the toiai sales ior toe present
vear will foot np one hundred and
fortv-five thousand dollars. The offi
cers of the company are Messrs. James
Hobbs, President, and w. iv. uoruy,
Secretary.
THE STAR GLASS WORKS
are also situated on the west side of the
town, and are the property of J. H.
Sullivan & Sons. The commencement
of the works was in March, 1872, and
their completion and operation in the
month of July in the same year were
consistent with the characteristic ener
gy of the senior member of the firm.
Lamp chimneys are the exclusive pro
duction of this establishment. It has
an eight-pot furnace and is worked in
daylight only. It is perhaps in all its
appointments the most compactly ar
ranged factory in the city. Mr. Sulli
van estimates the tirt year's business
at seventy-five thousand dollars and
expects a showing considerably in ex
cess of that for the current year.
THE NATIONAL GLASS CO'S
works are located south of the creek,
and were built in 1870 by James Cran
gle, of Wheeling, and designed for the
exclusive manufacture of pressed ware.
The concern from some cause was very
slow in stating, and was finally con
verted into a joint stock enterprise, of
which John T. Mercer is President and
H. C. Waddeil, Secretary. The '.first
and second years, for reasons iucident
to iuexperience, were unsuccessful, re
sulting in a reduction of its capital by
about fifteen thousand dollars. Nothing
daunted, however, the Company in the
face of disaster changed front, and turn
ed their works upon lamp chimneys
alone, blown ana moulded. Success
immediately followed the change. The
result of the current year's business will
foot up between ninety and one hun
dred thousand dollars, with flattering
prospects for a large increase of business

THE OHIO GLASS COMPANY—LEVI CASSELL,
PRESIDENT, AND W. J. KELLY,
SECRETARY.
These works are also south of the
creek, and were built in 1872, commenc
ing operations in August ot that year.
The capital of the Company was not so
large as mat oi some oi inesimiiar con
cerns, but their business has been pro
portionately successful. Their produc
tion is also exclusively lamp chimneys,
with an average turn out of 750 boxes
per week, approaching an aggregate
value ofseventy-nve thousand dollars
per annum.
THE RELLAIRE WINDOW GLASS
Company's establishment is also south
of the creek and next to thorn of the
Belmont company, are the largest in
the city. The company was organized
in the spring of 1872, with S. M. Sheets,
President, and G. W. Sandeis. former

The Knights Templar under the au

No. 11. had a splendid re-union on
Thanksgiving day. Many guests from
Pittsburgh and other places were pres
ent. They had marcning with ban
ners and brass bands; they had a ser
mon and a banquet and toasts, and
jolly good time.
Ex-Senator Updegraff, of Mt. Pleas
ant, in response to the toast "The
State of Ohio; the third in the bright
galaxy of States," found a theme wor
thy of being talked about. We present
a specimen of his admirable condensa
tion of the richness and greatness
our Buckeye State:
Thirty-seven sovereign States, clasp
ed bytbe endearing name, "Uur uouu
try," form our national family. Among
these, umo, graded by population,
takes the "third" place. In growth
variety of resources and products, loca
tion, progress, education, - benevolent
institutions and national influence,
holds a rank second to none, in 1810,
when New York stood first and Penn
sylvania second in white population
Ohio was ninth. Since that time
progress has been such a miracle
growth and prosperity, that its history
and statistics seem a fable and a false
hood to the amazed people ot older and
slower countries. In 1870 its constant
ly increasing population was 2,655,260,
Last year the aggregate assessed value
of its daily augmenting, real and pei
sons! property, was $1,624,323,118.
true value of the same is set down
$2,335,463,394, or about four times what
it was in 1850. There are in the State
20,000,000 acres of cultivated land, which
last year yielded over $200,000,000
worth of farm products. There
now $141,924,000 invested in manufac
turing, supplying 137.200 men with
bor, and yielding last year a product
$300,0U0,U0U.
In 1871 there were mined 55,315,666
bushels of coal, and geologists compute
the amount of available coal in
State to be 23,000,000,000 tons, and new
sources of supply are being constantly
discovered, xnesuppiy already knon

last year for more than 30,000 years,
Of pig iron, that standard staple
modern industry, unio, in isvi, manu
factured 353,0o0 tons. Kvery ton
iron represents about twenty-tive days'
work, us nearly 85 per cent of its value
is tne labor it involves. That amount
of iron manufactured , then means
825,000 days' labor, worth $14,737,500,
or the constant employment of 32,750
workmen, and tie support of 163,750
American men, women and children.
But lietter and gntnder far than
these proofs ot material proenerity
comes the crowning fact that during
the past year Ohio has expended more
than $7,000,000 for educational purpo
sed in furnishing the meaus of knowl

Living Age affords the best and, all
things eousidered, the cheapest means
of keepiug well iu formed iu the most
valuable current literature; a literature
that embraces the productions of the

ptuiosopny, criticism, and art.
A list, of some of the distinguished
authors represented in its pages will

of names it is. The new series, which
was begun Jan. 1, 1873,already embraces
serial, and short stories by eminent
French. German. Bussian. and English
novelists; and during the ensuing year,
as heretofore, besides the choicest fic
tion by the leading foreign authors, the
usual unequaled amount will be given
of the ablest essays and reviews, the
best poems, itie nnest sketches ot trav
el and discovery, and the most valua
ble historical, biographical, scientific,
and political information from the pens
of the foremost living authors.
