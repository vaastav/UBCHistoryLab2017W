The president dliveid hit
RDonal message to congress on
Monday, bat failed to lay ft ward:
about the Indian territory, while
touching on almost all foreign
nations of the earth.
The merchant, the mechanic, the
laborer, and every person in the
eity of Chickashs are busy. Whether
itis the wave of McKinley prosperity
or whether th location, the resour
ces or what not we hare itis a very
marked degree.
The smoke stacks of the city
were all belching this morning
and as the atmosphere was in that
condition the smoke hung in great
clouds over three quarters of the

The alugle statehood convec
tion at South McAlester next
Tuesday should wake np Mr. Mc
Kinley to a knowledge that there
is a loreign couutry in the heart
of America that needsatteiition n
his annuals aud also in bis inn. r
niort thoughts.
It ia customary among news
paers to wish a new competitor
in the field the lest of wishes aiid
good luck. The Express has oi
tired of doing that same thing.
Yet there is no use to lc mean
and we once more extend a wel
Come to Mr. Knotts in his new
venture wiih the Telegram.
The Express is in (Jliiukaaha as a
fixture, and has kept in liie march
and a-Jvance ol the city's improve
ment, and will continue to keep in
the advance. It ia today the equal
of any daily published In the lerri
tory and one of which the ci'y may
well be proud, and it should rneei
. au encouragement, in , keeping wiih
its effort.
What does the tingle statehood
convention at South MeAIfster on
the 10th expect to do? What can
it do? Nothing but to meet, reso
lute and show to the people of the
country that we need something
need something, and need it
bad. The news will go out that
we are in earnest, and that word
will get something after a time.
Without theso conventions we can
drag on and on in this anomolous
condition, and never will
change. Let the convention
go on with all the support in at
tendance that can be mustered.

- IN MEMORY.
i Si Perkins Comedy Coin
pany gave "Hazel Kirk1' last
night to a crowded house in a
h gbly satisfactory manner. The
p ay was especially well rendered,
t.m more so where all the sur
roundings are considered. Miss
Coleman as Hazel Kirk displayed
a genius highly commendable as
au actress of great ability. Misa
Oglesby displayed a marked
ability in getting away from a rat,
aud takes her part well in every
particular. Mr. Vender, as the
old miller, was perfection, For a
jouug man to sustain his charac
ter of this part must be a very
difficult thing, but the gentleman
never lost his cue and was the
perfect old man ot stern mein, but
soft heart, to the last. Mr. Bur
ton is the safety value in all the
plays and only needs be seen to
be appreciated. The Si Perhins
company are all right.
A man may walk with a springy
step even in the fall.
It was perfectly proper to ar
rest the New Jersey politician
who was accused of bribing a
man w'th applejack.
Stfictly speaking, of course, a
man can't be ready to die for two
different girls without leading a
double life.
"De trouble 'bout los' sheep is,"
observed Elder Sable, "dat it
take too many people to find 'cm."
The flower that's fairest and sweetest,
Thai perfumes the golden mora;
Their loveliness seems iho sweetest,
Yields Hrst to the winter's storm.
In our garden sweet with posies,
There stood one of brightest hue
1'ho essence of eternal goodness
Humble, yet brave and true.
On the trouble waves of conflict,
Or when kissed by the dews of morn;
His presence gave us gladness.
His absence makes us mourn.
Enraptured with art and music,
He would soar on her balmy wings,
As he drew a Dow of finished power,
Across the trembling strings.
But there's a painful discord in our band
The absence of sweet strains,
The organ pleads for his skillful hand
Only groans to tell its pains.
There's a vacant place a vacant chair,
And anguish in each sad heart.
And every thought gives birth to tears;
Sad mcnory that shall ne'er depart
Yet love is the only bow,
That illumines death's lower? cloud ;
It exalts what fate lays low
Drives fear from the solemn shroud.
And perhaps the midnight here,
Is some where else a dawn
He lives in a higher sphere
He perfumes a brighter morn.
SVe know from the tree of life,
The buds and blossoms fall
The patriarch and babe alike;
Death claims them one and all.
In the common bed of earth ;
The young and sage repose
Mysterious is the birth, -
As mysterious the depose.
Then, oh, how we love to think
Of our Claude In a Heavenly band,
On the daisy sprinkled brink
Mid the applause of the great and grand.
Then let us all some day.
Touch upon that shore and stand
After crossing the tempestous waves.
We will shake little Claude's hand.

"When I went abroad this snrino-"
said the young mnn who was being
dined betnuse he had just come home
from the exposition, says the New York
Run, "I was so ill that mv mother said
I could not go without our doctor.
"On the way across, somehow, all
my illness pot blown overboard and I
felt as if I had left myself in New York
and was a new man I'd have to get ac
quainted with. I?ut ail the lime there
was the doctor in our party. He was
having a good time and taking his own
medicines; every once in awhile he
would take a pill from one wai-stcoat
pocket and take it, then after a meal
he would draw a powder from another
pocket and wash that down.
"The day we reached Amsterd nm.
however, like a flash I found my old
self I had loft in New York, I felt ill
and couldn't breathe. I went to the
doctor in haste.
"'Doctor,' I said, 'I feel fpieerly; I
can't get a long breath, all I can do'.
" 'Then take two short ones,' said he,
and 1 laughed and got better right
there.
"And that was the only time my
physician prescribed for me from dock
to dock, over and back."
