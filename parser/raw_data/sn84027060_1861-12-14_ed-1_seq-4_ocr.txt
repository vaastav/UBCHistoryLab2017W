dreomstancea compel him to redeoe
his estimatee for 1862', from the revenue from
$57,000,000 to $82,198,602. The estimates
from tbe receipts from landa and miscellaneous
aoarces be redaoesfrom $8,000,000 to $2,804,
062 of revenue. There is a direct tax author
ised by Congreee, which if increaaed to tbe
limit proposed by the Secretary, and assumed by
States,She further sum of $20,00,000 may be
expected. The aggregate of revenue may be
thus estiipaled at $64,662,660, which ia $23,
447,884 leas than the estimate of July.
The Seceetary states tho estimstse for July
were based on tbe raising of 250,000 volunteers,
and an increase of the regular army by eleven
regiments, but after that report bad been cloaed
Congress authorized tho acceptance, by tbe Pre
sident, of 600,000 men, besides additional com
panies and ofiiccra. This large increaso has,and
must necessarily augment tbe expenditures far
beyond tbo limit indicated by the original esti
mates which will be still further extended by the
increase of tbe Navy, and additional appropria
tion are asked for.
If these additional appropriations $47,985,666
were authorized by acta of last eeasion, $143,
130,927 are now asked for making an aggregate
including $22,787,933. For indefinite appropria
tion $213,904,427. To provide theae large sums
retrenchment and reform are indispensable.
Contracts should bo subjected to strict super
vision, rigorous responsibility, all unnecessary
officer should bo abolished, and salariea and
pay materiatly reduccd.
While recommending retreebment he feels
himself constrained to renew suggestions here
tofore submitted by him that (the property of
rebels should be made to pay in part, at least,
the cost of rebellion. Property bf great value
in loyal States is held by proprietors virtually
engaged in guilty attempt to break up tho Union
which is justly forfeited to the people, which
should be subject to sequestrations or confis ca
tion, and the proceeds spplied to the satisfac
tion of claims arising from the war.
Property of rebels in rebel States should be
treated in same manner. Rights to services
uuder State laws must of necessity form an ex'
ception to any rule of confiscation. Persons
held by rebels under such lawa to aorvice as
slaves may however be juatly liberated from
their constraint and made more valuable in va
tious employments through voluntary and com
penaated service than if confiscated aa aubjecta
of property.-
The Secretary aaya tbe moat sacred duty of
the American people now requires the eoaseera
tion of all their energies to tbe establishment of
the Union, and sound policy would seem to aug
geat no extension of foreign trjde, but more ab
aolute reliance on American labor, American
akill and American aoil.
He reoommenda that duties on tea, ooffee and
augar be increased, to 2}c per pound on brown
sugar So on clarified 20o on green tea 6c on
coffee, and that no other alterationa of tariff
be iflede, unless further experience Bball do
monatrate tbe neeeasitv.
He deema it necessary to increaso the direct
tax ao aa to produce from loyal Statea a revenue
of at leaat $20,000,000, eetimatiog such itiea
on atills, distilled liquors, tobacco, bank notes,
earriages, legacies on paper, evidencea of debt,
and conveyances of property, and other like
property aa wi.l produce an equal additional
sum. The income tax will probably produce
$10,000,000 more, making an aggrepate of $60,
000,009.
Tbe Secretary ia aware that the aum ia large,
bi)t aeeing no probability of revenue exceeding
$40,000,000 during the current year he fee
la
that be muat not shrink from a plain statement
of actual neceasitiea of tbe aituation. 2 6 of
one per cent in real and personal property of
the loyal Statea will produce 44,000,000, tbe
proposed income adding $10,000,000.
The Secretary recommenda a plan for a na
tional circulation of notes, the features of which
are a circulation by notea bearing acommon im
pression and authenticated by common author
ity. Tho redemption of these notes by associa
tiona aad laatitutioae to which they may be de
livered for issue, and tbe security of that redemp
tion by tbe pledge of United Statea stocks and
an adequate provision of specie. An important
advantage to tbe people by tbia plan would be
in the increased security of the Union springing
from the common interests In ite preservation,
created by the distribution of its stocks to asco
ciationa throughout tbe country, aa the baaia of
this circulation, and beentertaina the opinion if
a credit circulation be deairable it is this form.
He states that it ia earnestly hoped, not with
out sufficient ground, that the present wsr will
be brought to an auspicious termination before
'midsummer, and that iii that event the provision
by taxation recommended will amply., suffice
for all financial exigencies' without additional
loansand enable tbe Government at once to be
gin a redaction of tbe existing debt.
If the war continues to July 1st 1862 tbe
public debt will be $617,322,802 if till Jnly
1st 1863, It will be in round numbers $W)0,000,
000. The prohibition of trade with tne rebel
States has been 'fully enforced. Regulationa
have been established by which rice, cotton and
other property in the icaurreetiouary district
occupied by our troops will be collected and
aent by aea to New York. All salea will be
for accoudt of the Government and the pro
ceeds paid into tbe National Treaaury.
Aa a general rule commerce ahould follow the
flag, and when tbe authority of the Uaioa ia
ttllj restored in theae State*/ ports abould be
opened without restriction and all commerce
freely permitted. The Secietary closes by say
ing it bae been Ida endeavor to infuse Into bia

WssataaToa, Dec. 9.—Skratb.—A number of
petitione were presented aad referred to appro
priate committees. Several oa tbe eatancipe
tioa of alavea of rebels were preeeated and re
ferred to committee aa Judiddry.
Mr. Suauier preeeated a resolution that all
memorials aad papera on the files of the Senate
relating to the recognition of Liberia and Hayti
ba takes from tbe filea and referred to tbe com
mittee oa Foreiga afBUra. Agreed to.
Mr. Clark oflhied areeeiutloo requMtiag the
Marshal of tbe district to inform tbe Senate by
what authority he keeps alavea of the district in
jail, beoeaae tbey are refractory. He said he
had vial ted the jail and foond a number of the
alavea af the district confined, for ao reason on
ly becaaas their mastera or mistresses aent them
because they were refractory, Resolution agreed
to.
Mr. Halo's resolutions directing the Judiciary
Committee to inquire' into tbe expediency of
abolishing tbe present Supreme Court bad fail
ed. He believed if the rebels now in arma should
eueeecd the Supreme Court Would decide that
tba soldiers aow in Virginia were trespassers
and rioters.
Mr. Collamar moved as a substitute tbst all
portions of }he President's message relating to
the Judiciary be referred to tbe Judiciary Com
mittee.
Collamar'a amendment was agreed to and the
resolution as amended, waa adopted.
On motion of Mr. Chandler, the resolution of
enquiry into tbe cause of tbe disasters to our ar
my at Bull Run aad Ball's Bluff, was taken up.
Tbe queation was on the aubstitute offered by
Mr. Grimes, that a committee to investigate the
cause of all the disasters that have happened so
the Union forces.
Mr. Chandler said the officers of the army
were not liable to impeachment, but one of our
own number has fallen (Baker) and nobody is
to blame. He thought the facts ought to be
known. He wanted the truth known regarding
disasteta in Missouri, referredfto by tbe Senator
from Kansas. If Gen. Fremont is to blame let
it be known, but if not, in God's name let him
be justified and let tho couutiy know it.
Mr. Foster thought it best not to investigate
the subject now uuder tbe present circumstan
ces. He thought Congress had better not do it.
If military officers managed tho army badly,Con
gress would only make a bad matter worse, by
interfering. He would let the military alone.—
In time of war an inquiry of this kind would on
ly call men away from higher dutica. At the
proper time Coogreas might make the inquiry.
Mr. Sherman believed an investigation would
be beneficial, especially a geueral inquiry into
tbe whole conduct ef the war, and said he would
record his solemn conviction that before the
war closed, slavery would almost if not entirely
cease to exist, but tbe war should be carried on
without any reference to the subject of slavery,
to preserve a free country.
Mr. Stevena has modified bis resolution in
several important particulars.
Mr Hutching, of Ohio, introduced a bill
conditionally abolishing Slavery in tbe District
of Columbia.
Mr. Gurley introduced a bill to confiscate
slavea of rebels and colonize them.
On motion of Mr. Cox it waa reaolved that the
Committee of Waya and Means be instructed to
eonsider tbe tariff and taxation with a view to
equalize the burdens of the present war.
A delegation from au Indian tribe arrived here
to examine and report to their people the true
condition of affaira. Tbey express surprise at
finding things so entirely different from wbst
they were represented by means of tbe rebel
leaders.
WASHDIOTOI, Dec. 10.—House.—Mr. R?scoe
Conkling offered a resolution which waa adopted,
requesting the Attorney-General to report his
views as to tbe means of obtaining a retroces
sion of that part of Virginia formerly belonging
to tbe Dietrict of Columbia
Mr. Potter, from the Committee of Public
Lands, reported a bill providing homesteads
to actual settlers and providing a bounty for
soldiers In lieu of granta of public lands. He
explained that the homestead feature of thia bill
was heretofore passed, but there is an addition
that all soldiers, marinea and aeamen, ahall bo
entitled to the proviaiona of thia act. It also
contains a section giving a bounty of $30 to tbe
three months volunteers.
The Houae concurred in tbe Senate resolution
for a Joint Committee to inquire into the con
duct of tbe present war with power to send for
persons and papera.
Mr. Pendleton moved that tbe memorials of
Measrs. Howard, Gatchell and Dunn be referred
back to tbe committee on Judiciary, with in
structions declaring that Congress alone baa the
power under the Constitution, to suspend the
writ of habeas corpus that the exercise of the
power by another department of the Govern
ment, ia a usurpation and dangerous to public
liberty that tne persons above named be de
livered to tbe Marshal in the end, that they may
be iodicled with tbe rigbta of speedy trial, if
there be probable cauae for such proceedings.
Ho spoke at soaie length on this subject, saying
that those gents weie members of the Board of
Police of Baltimore, and on the lat day of July
last, in the dead hour of nigbt, were arrested by
ordar of the military authorities, and without
charges being preferred againat them, conveyed
as prisoners to Ft. McHenry. They ask that
Congress may examine Into the queation or that
they may be heard before a judioial tribunal.—
And yet tbia Mr. Pendletoo'a eolleaguea on tbe
committee on Judiciary could find no more fit
ting reply to tbe memorial than that it ahould
lay untuad on the table. Tbe queation bore pre
sented waa aa to the character of their preaent
punishment, which he denied.
Mr. Bingham said hie colleague'a position was
that Congress alone can suspend the writ, while
conceding the time has come for its suspension,
when rebellion lifted up its head over a large
portion of thia Republic, and essayed to shske
down tho pillars of tbe Constitution, and drench
the land in fraternal blood, it waa no time to be
splitting hairs aa to whether Congress or the
President should first exercise tbe power. Did
his colleague contemplate a general jail delivery
or wish to confine his sympathies to the rebels
and conspirators of the city of Baltimore Had
ho no sympathy for thoae confined in the Old
Capital? Why ahould tbey not also be dis
charged Aasuming hia colleague's position to
be right, bis colleague waa derelict in duty, in
not moving a suspension of the writ, in accord
ance with the oath he had taken to maintain,
protect and defend the Constitutioa. Tbe jaws
are to be execated, and not only executed by
force, but by the sword against the powers of
rebellion. It did not lie in the mouths of the
memorialists to elalm the beaefit of the Conati
tation,every provision of which they have tramp
lednbder foot.
On motion "of Mr. Bingham tho whole subject
was tabled—108 agaiast 86.

daath of Senator Bingham, of
Eulogies were delivered by Messrs.
Besman, Trowbridge and Granger, of MicUcaa,

Nsw Yoax, Dec. 10.—Tbe following ia an
abridged copy of tbe report of CapL Wilkes,
assigning his reason for his arrest of Mason and
Slidell:
U. S. Strambb, Sam Jacibto, at Sea,): i
November 16th, 1861.
Tbe government of Great Britain issued proc
lamations that the Confederate States were
viewed, considered and treated aa belligerents.
I felt no hesitation in boarding and searching
all vessels of whatever nation I fell in with, and
I have done so. Tbe question arose in my mind
whether I had the right to capture the persons
of the Commissioners whether they were smen
able to capture. There waa no doubt that I bad
the right to capture vessels with written dis
patches they are expressly referred to in all
authorities, subjecting the vessel to seizure and
condemnation, if the captain of the vessel had
the knowledge of their being on board. But
these gentlemen were not dispatches in the lit
eral sense and no where could I find a caae in
point. They bad been presented to tho Captain
General of Caba by H. B. M. Consul General.
But the Capt. Gen'l told mo that he did not re
ceived them in that capacitv, but as distin
guished gentlemen and strangers. I then con
sidered them as the embodiment of dispatches,
and thetefore it beeame my duty to arrest their
progress snd capture them if they bad no
ports or papera from the Federal Government,
as provided under law of nations, namely, that
foreign ministers of a belligerent on board of
neutral ships are required to possess papera from
the other beligerenta to permit tbem to prss free
As respects the steamer in which they em
barked, the aeent of the vessel, the son of tbe
British Consul at Havana, was well aware of tbe
character of these persons. They went into the
steamer with tbe knowledge and consent of the
Captain, who endeavored afterwards to conceal
them by refusing to exhibit tbe passenger list,
and the papers of the vessel. There can be no
donbt he knew they were carrying highly impor
tant dispatches, and were endowed with instruc
tions inimical to the United States. This ren
dered his vessel, though a neutral, a good priz).
I determined to take possession of the vessel,
and as I mentioned in my report, send her to
Key West for adjudication. I forbore to seize
ber, however, in consequence of my being so
reduced in officers and crew, and the derange
ment it woold cause in.iocent persona, there be
inga large number of passengers who would
have been put to great loss and inconvenience
as well as disappointment fro a the interruption
it would havecaused them in not being able to
join the steamer from St. Thomaa for Europe.
I therefore concluded to aacrllice the interesteof
my officers and crew in the prize, and softer tbe
atesmer to proceed, after the neceasary deten
tion to effect the transfer of these jcommission
ers, considering I had attained the important
end I bad in view.

Tbe Journal further saya that the President
gives Congress the hint, which it is disposed to
take, to aOop* extreme anasarca. It proceeds
aafollawa:
We thaa have before aa tho startliag fact that
within a few daya or weeka tha Preridoat will
be called upon to decide for or against the adop
tion nf lasssaimi which the oonasrvative men of
the country dens utterly fatal to tbe re-eatab
lisbment of our Goverameat aad nfuth ht mil
coruuitr wUk a Ha* favorabit to ihar mdoption.—
Tbia ia tho plain truth, deny it who may, aad
the revelation of this truth marks tbe real turn
log point in the present momentous struggle.—
Now, of sll others, is tbe critical hour of Amer
ican nationality.
What is to be donef There is but one thing
to be done. The adoption of the extreme meas
ures conteaplstcd must be prevented, or the
nation is swallowed up. Of this we do not feel
a shadow of a doubt. But how can the adoption
of these measures be prevented 'There appear
to na to be three modes, in cither of which the
sll important prevention may be attained.
1. The prosperity of our arms and of our canae
generally in k great degree will put all pretexts
whatever, for a resort to extreme mesanres out
of tbe question. 2. The awakening of tbe con
servstive sentiment and enlightened loyalty of
the country, and bringing both to bear on the
President with a force which he cannot as an
honest and rational man withstand. S. The res
olution of the Commander-in-Chief in the field,
and of bia principal associates in command, to
aurrender their swords rather than link them
with the infamy of such measures. The first of
these three modes is for the most part beyond
the reach of tbo people. We have faith in it,
but it should not be relied on blindly The last
mode is our last hope. When everything else
fails, this may save us. If it does not, wo are
irretrievably lost as a nation. This mode, tbo*
hardly beyond tbo reach of the people, is still
not directly within their influence. The aecond
mode is especially the people's own, and through
this mode we invoke the people to pour their
awakened energiea with a spirit of lofty resolve
that will not be put down or put aaide. Here la
the sphere wherein the loyal masses of our peo
ple in this crisis of tbe nation'a fate can work
effectually for the national preaervation. We
call them to the aublime task.
Tbe teak can be perlormed successfully. Let
it be performed at every cost of energy and of
sacrifice. We would have tbe General Assem
bly of Kentucky inaugurate tbe imperative work
by at once protesting in loyal terma, but expli
citly and emphatically againat tbe adoption of
tbe measures in contemplation. Let this be
done and let the example be followed as prompt
ly as possible by Missouri and Maryland and Del
aware and Western Virginia, and every other
Southern community, whether large or small,
that still owna thei banner of our'country. Fur
thermore, let the solemn protestations be carri
ed to Waahinpton by delegations of the roost
eminent and influential citizenaof the respective
communities, and be urged upon the President
with all tbe Weight of exalted character and in
telligence seconded by the power of personal
presence. Let the loyal men of tbe Sonth rise
up as one man and tell the President be knows
not what be does.

Tha lwdseilla Jooraal aays the Presideat's
_assage is "deplorably aasatisfbotoRy. «», tha
point «f ehlefealieteade to tbe conaervativa mea
of the coon try." It quotea Mrv Liooola's very
•odcrate expressioas an the slavery quaatiou,
and profseoss to see ia them "indirect and aa
»«niy eoncurrenco in tbe policy asserted recent
ly bvCoL Coohrane aad approved by Secretary
Oameroa to the mortification and shaase of eve
ry loyal man in Kentucky."
It ia now plr.in to every candid
observer, that the Preaident must either break
with the extreme men of bia party or sacrifice
the country to their fanatical measures. One
or the other is inevitable. Tbe message shows
that the President is not disposed to break with
the extreme men of his party. He wants per
haps both tbe sagacity and the nerve. Some
thing be certainly wants. Whatever it may be,
the firm, full, healthful, assuring, overruling
voice of tbe people will supply it Let that voice
be besrd.
Our sense of tbe actnal peril is
most deep and vivid. If we suppressed or dis
guised it we should be false to ourselves and false
to our country. We know not how it may be
with others, but we confess tbe effect produced
in us by the mournful repulse and panic of Bull
Run was elation compared with tho feeling we
experienced on reading the passage of the mea
sage which forms tbe text of theae remarks. Un
less the President is speedily braced up by tbe
conservative sentiment of the nation there is se
rious danger that although the rebellion be put
down tbe nation will be extinguished.
0. S. A.—In onr
last issue we referred to the fact that tbe re
cent Message of Gov. Rector, of Arkansas,
darkly and dolefully hinted at the existence of
treason fat the midst of that bappy State. From
other sources this passes beyond a mere surmise,
since
1t is certain that arrests are being made of
parties in Arkansss charged with being Union
men.
The Little Rock State Journal, of the 29th
ult, notices the arrival at that city of twenty
seven prisoners, members of a secret Lincoln
organisation from Van Bnren county. They
were lodged in jail for ssfe-keeping, until tried
by the civil authorities. Forty others were said
to be on tbe way, and tbe namea of the whole
clan known, also their secret signs and pass
words, which were divulged by a young man who
was ignorantly initiated into the order.
From tbia aame sheet it appears that informa
tion of thia organization was given to Gen. Bur
gevin by a citizen of Van Buren county, and
a volunteer ia tbe Confederate (service. The
namea of the leaders were fully divulged, and a
sharp pursuit took place. Two or three were
hong immediately upon being taken. Tbe editor
of tbe Little Rock Journal claims to speak most
knowingly, and entirely by the card in the mat
tor, and ctaima to have been permitted tc peruse
the Constitution of this organization. He eaya
it is called a "Peace and Constitutional So
ciety." Tbey have 700 members in Searcy,
Van Buren, Newton and Ixard counties, and
1,700 in tbe whole State. They have a regular
avetem of signs and paaa-words, and are furnish
ed with aupplies of money from the Northern
camps. The Constitution makes it obligatory
upon every member to hazard his life in aid of
another in diatresa, and the penalty of express
ing any of tbe secrets of the organization is
death.
Gen. Burgevin, who waa mustering in a ragi
ment at Carrolton, in Carrol county, aa soon aa
be heard of the conapiracy, at once hurried
down to the counties above named, to take such
steps as might be neessary. At Clinton, in Van
Buren county, he saw one Col. Jerome B. Lew
is, who aaaured him of tbe correctness of the
report CoL Lewis had called out a guard of
100 men, and was st thst time making arrests,
and Gen. Burgevin left tbe control of tbe whole
affair with that officer.
The abaet we quote reports that those already
taken were well supplied with arma and ammo
nitioo, and infeia that those atill at large are
eqaally well equipped.

Jefferson Davis, then Secretary af War, was ad
dreseed on the subject by a committee of the
citisens of Yazoo, who expressed the hope that
he woakl, in tbe intoreet of the State, as well aa
of the deputy pootmaster whoae caadact waa
under review, give the case hia peraonal atten
tion. Thia Mr. Davis engegsd to do, and the
matter, es one of constitutional law, having been
referred by the Poetmastor General of that data,
tbe Hon. Jamea Campbell, to tbe Attorney Gen
eral of the United Statea, then tba Hon. Caleb
Gushing, that learned jurist delivered aa elabo
rate opinion affirming the right of tbe Poatmaa
ter General and of hu subordinatea in the Statea
to aoppresstheeircnlstion of all printed matter
"ths design and tendency of whioh ara to pro
mote insurrection."
What the doctrine laid down by Mr. Cnahing
was, may be read in the following extract:
"With these premises, we have the main
queation very much simplified. It is this: Haa
a citizen of one of the United States plenary
indiaputable right to employ tbe functions and
the officers of the Union as the means of ena
bling him to produce insurrection in other of
tbe United States I Can tbe officers of tbe Un
ion lawfully lend ite functions to the citizens of
one of tbe States for tho purpose of prompting
insurrection in another State
Taking the last of these questions first, it
obvious to say, that, inasmuch as it is the consti
tutional obligation of the United States to pro
tect each of the Stetee againat "domestic vio
lence,"and to make provision to "suppress in
surrections," it caanot be the right of tbe Uni
ted States, or of any of ite officers, and of course
it cannot be their duty, to promote, or be tbe
instrument of promoting, insurrection in aay
part of the United States.
As to tbe first question, likewise, it seems ob
vious to say, that, as insurrection in any one of
the Statee ia violation ot law, not only aa far as
regards thst State itself, but also ss regards tbe
United States, therefore no citisen of tbe Un
ion can lawfully incite insurrection in aay one of
the States. Even as between foreign Govent
ments, it Is contrary to natural right, or at least
an act of international hostility, for the inhabi
tanta of one country to seek to disturb the do
mestic peace of the other. Combinations in
one country for the purpose of producing, by
whatever means, insurrection in another, unless
they be avowed acts of war, are, at any rate,
acts of unjust aggression on tbe rights of inde
pendent States. All such acts, reprehensible
generally, and of miscbevious effect, are peculi
arly unjust and criminal as between citisens of
different States of the Union, bound together aa
we arc by tbe most solemn engagements of reci
procal reapcet of one anotber'a rigbta, mutual
amity, and common support and defence. It
would be preposterous to suppose that any citi
zen of the United States has lawful right to do
that which he is bound by law to prevent when
attempted by any and all others and monstrous
to pretend that a citisen of one of the Statea
haa moral right to promote or commit insurrec
tion or domestic violence that is, robbery
burglary, arson, rape, aad mnrder, by whole'
sale, in other of the States.
These considerations, it seems to me, are de
cisive of the question of the true construction
of the aot of Congress. Of that it ia impoaai
ble for me to doubt. Its enactment It, that "if
any postmaster shall unlawfully detain," he «M1
be subject to fine, imprisonment, and disqualifi
cation. Then, if the thing be of lawful deliv
ery, it cannot be lawfully detained while, on
the other hand, it cannot be unlawful to detain
that which it is unlawful to deliver. 8uch ia tbe
plain language and the manifest import of the
act of Congress.
I do not mean to be understood that the word
"unlawfully" ot the aot determines the case.—
On the contrary, my conclusion would be the
same though tbe word had not been bare insert-
By employing it, indeed, the act expressly
ed.
admita that there may be lawful cause of'deten7
tion. But such lawful cause would not the
less exist, although its existence were not thus
expressly recognized. And of all conceivable
causes of detention there can be none more op
erative than the treasonableness of character.
For, in every society, the public safety ia tbe
aupremeat of laws.
Nay, if, instead of expressly admitting lawful
causes of detention, the act had undertaken to
exclude them—if, for instance^ it bad in terms
required the postmasters to circulate papers
which, in tendencj and purpose, are of cbar&c
ter to incite insurrection in any of the States
still my conclusion would be the same. I abould
aay of such a provision of law, it ia a nullity—it
ia unconstitutional not so by reaaon of conflict
with any State law, but because inconsistent
with tbe Constitution of tbe United Stales.—
TheContiUtUion forbidt insurrection it imposes
on Congress and Ae President the duty of suppres
sing insurrection Ait alligation (hrouah
Congress and the President to all the subordinate
functionaries of Ae Union, civil and military and
"jy of an act of Congress requiring a
Federal functionary to be the agent or minister of
insurrection w either of Ae States, ,could violate
palpably, the positive letter, and defeat one of the
primary objects of the Constitution.
These, mv conclusions, apply only to newspa
pers, pamphlets, or other printed matter, the
character of w.iich is of public notoriety or is
necesssrily brought to the knowledge of the
postmaster by publicity of transmission through
tbe mails unsealed, aad as to the nature of which
he cannot plead ignorance. It la otherwise in
tbe case of letters, the contents of which he hss
no ordinary and public means to know, which
he is presumed not to know, snd which he has
no business to Inquire into or challenge. Indeed,
printed publications are in one statute exclu
aively, and in the other chiefly, the objects of
the restraint of the laws of Mississippi. Other
descriptions of printed matter exiat tbe trans
mission of which is not protected by law. I
designedly pan over that, however, and confine
the specific description of matter,that
which has for its objsct and tendency to pro
mote insurrection in one of the States."—fNn
