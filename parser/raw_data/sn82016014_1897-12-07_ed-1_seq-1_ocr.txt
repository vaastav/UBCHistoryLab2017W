CONVICTS, NOT GENTLEMEN
That 'is the View Held by the Warden
of the 2i3souri Peaitsnttary.
Austin. Texas. Dec. T. At yesterday's
session cf the Xatlonai Prison con
press the reports of the standing com
mittees on "pr.son discipline" and
"prison physicians" were . submitted.,
showing marked prnc-ress in both de
partments. A considerable discussion
was had as to whether it was more ad
visable to teach hand power in prison
industries or machine power, and the
general opinion was that machine pow
er was mere abreast of the times and
ence waa decidedly advantageous to
convicts, who u:--:i t ---.r..f r.e .sed.
wei-e better able to pet employment.
The old ";uesiion of corporal pur.'sh

tn- course r.t the discussion Warden
Clark of Missouri, said that violaters

yet to hear the northern brethren one
w..u:i think that n-.body hut Sunday

A resolution was tinaliy adopted
cli .rig the line that at the next meeting

FIGHTJJPENS
Between Kepley and Cook as to
Which One
Was Legally Elected Sheriff at
the Late Election.
ARGUMENTS TODAY
Were on the Question as to
Whether
Giring Away of Liquor Should
Enter Into the Controversy.
The Cook-Kepley contest for the of
fice of sheriff of Shawnee county was
formally opened at 9:30 this morning.
The three judges of the contest court,
Probate Judge Dolme.n.A. W. Dana and
John F. Switzer sat behind a long table
carried in from the office of the county
superintendent of public instruction.
The old benches which w ere used in the
old Cvjurt house were used for the spec
tators while the attorneys were group
ed on either side around two painted
pine tables. The sittings are being
held on the third floor of the court
house in O. A. R. Memorial hall which
has never before been used.
When Judge Dolman rapped for order
there were about 25 people ia the room,
most of them being ward workers.
Judge Hot-tun. T .F. Doran and W. F.
Schoch sat with Mr. Cook to the left of
tne judges. Directly in front of them
sat Mr. Kepley with his attorneys. Eu
gene Hagan. O. E. Hungate and John
C. Waters. Mr. Hagan arose and ex
plained that he wished a few hours
time in which to file some motions. At
torney Doran objected to any postpone
ment whatever. He said that the at
torneys for Kepley had nut taken ad
vantage of the time given them and it
was nut the fault of Mr. Cook or his at
torneys. Prooate Judge Dolman consulted with
his associates and then announced that
they- would grant a postponement until
11 o'clock this afternoon. "S.'e want no
more delays," said he. "and vcherr vie
convene this afternoon let the contest
be hurried through witnout any furtner
delays. "
The motions that the attorneys for Mr.
Kepley tiled this afternoon are in refer
ence to the dispensing of liquor charged
by the attorneys for Mr. Cook. They
ciaimed that whether or not liquor was
served cuts no figure in the present
contest. Tney say that the law pro
vides that in case liquor has teen
used in an election the fact can be used
against a successful candidate to de
cire his off.ee vacant but that it can
r.oc be used when the candidate has
been defeated on the face uf the re
turns. This point is raised by U. C.
Clemens who was employed by Jlr.Kep
ie;c today. This is the first motion
which is in the nature of a demurrer to
the answer of Mr. Cook. If Mr. Cock's
answer is heid to not be good it will
cause an adjournment until a new an
swer may be filed.
The second motion is to be argued in
case the first motion fails. It is to
strike out that portion of the answer
which refers to the giving away of li
quor. The third motion is to make the peti
tion more definite and certain. The
attorneys for Kepley claim that when
the charges are made that liquor has
been used it should be stated when it
was used and t-y whom.
This is the preliminary skirmish.
The arguments wdll probably not be
completed before evening and perhaps
not then. It is a fight to make the con
test simply upon the question of legal
or illegal votes.
It is reasonably certain that the giv
ing away of liquor will not enter into
the contest. It is believed that in case
the recount shows that enough Keplev
votes were marked on the three places
on the ticket to change the result the
contest will be dropped bv Mr. CookT
on the other hand if it is found bv the
recount that not enough of "these
marked ballots were thrown out to
change the 125 majority- in Mr. Cook's
favor, the Kepley atcomevs will give
up the fight. This has not yet devel
oped tut the information comes from
reliable parties cm both sides.
The recount will probably be complet
ed in a day. There wdll be discussions
and ofc-j-rtjoris by attorneys which nay
prolong the count but it should be defi
r.lteiy decided one way- or the other in
two or three days.
RIOT AT A THEATER.
Former Owner of a Lincoln,
Neb., Playhouse Objects
to Sale.
Lincoln. Xeb.. Dec. 7. The Lansing the
ater, the leading playhouse of this city,
was dismantled of part of its furnishings
before daylight this morning, almost a
riot accompanying the work.
As a result J. L. Lansing, the late half
owner: L. C. Burr and Roscoe Pound, his
attorneys, and a score of laborers were
arrested. The trouble is the outcome of
tiie saie cf the property under foreclos
ure a week ago. Mr. Lansing claimed
there was a conspiracy to defraud him of
part of his hr.dlng. The district court,
however, confirmed the sale and declared
the title vested in the purchaser, William
Oliver cf New York.
Between 2 and 3 o'clock this morning
Lansing, his attorneys and a number of
stage hands and roughs 'gained entrance
and began to remove the scenery and
chairs. Agents of Oliver were notified,
and in the controversy which followed
there was a personal collision between the
attorneys of the rival calimants. The po
lice queiied the disturbance about the
time it began to be interesting.

BAKER HOLDS THE CLUB.
An Interesting Interview of Chester
I. Long With Him.
A few days before his departure for
Washington. Senator Baker entertain
ed Chester I. Long at Leavenworth, the
latter appearing before the senator to
push the bill providing a new federal
district in Kansas.
Mr. Long was urging the merits of
the proposed measure with enthusiasm
when Mr. Baker interrupted him to
say:
"I think it would be a good idea for
me to investigate this matter and see
who wiil have charge of the patronage
in the new district should it be cre
ated." 'That will be satisfactorily arrang
ed." said Mr. Long, who was anxious to
proceed without considering that pro
position. "Well, perhaps you are right, but I
will investigate the matter anyhow."
Reflecting for a moment Mr. Baker
said :
"If I opposed thai bill it might not go
through."
Tnis indicates that Mr. Baker, in the
future, proposes to know who ts in
charge of the federal sppointments and
to prevent the possibility of other men
usurping his power.
S EATON TO BUY.
Tha Snccessfai Atchison Manu
facturer liay Purchase
the Grand.
The litigation involving the Grand
opera house in this city may be ended
by the purchase of that property by
John Seaton. of Atchison.
Mr. Seaton has commenced negotia
tions looking to the purchase of the
property, and while he is not willing
to give the amount represented by the
two mortgages. a compromise will
probably be effected with Mr. L. B.
Kendall, the holder of the second mort
gage of J16.. by which the property
can be secured at a reasonable figure.
Mr. Seaton owns the Seaton opera
house in Atchison, and has had exper
ience in the theatrcal line. If he se
cures possession of the Grand opera
house it is his intention to place the
theater in first-class shape, by renovat
ing the Retire interior. Mr. Seaton will
not atte'.npt to manage the house him
self, she- tld he purchase it. and it is
possible that Manager L. M. Crawford
would sec-ire control, as Mr. Seaton and
Mr. Crawford are warm friends. In
any evend the purchase of the Grand
opera houu: by- Mr. Seaton would give
Topeka a .' andsome play- house, one of
the handsomest in the west.
Last week Mr. Seaton purchased a
building on Kansas avenue, now oc
cupied by the Elliott gun store, and it
is known that he has one or two other
purchases of business property- under
consideration. He believes that the
parthase of Topeka property at the
present time wilt .ve a profitable in
vestment, as he says that in his opin
ion the value of property will gradual
ly increase from this time on.
If a satisfactory compromise can be
made with Mr. Kendall, it is likely that
Mr. Seaton wi'i step into possession of
the Grand opera house.
JENNINGSES ARE CAUGHT.
Deputy Marshals Arrest Al and Prank
and Two Confederates.
Muskogee, I. T.. Dec. 7. Four mem
bers of the Jennings gang of outlaws
were lodged in jail here last night.
A! and Frank Jennings, the reputed
leaders of the band, are among the
prisoners. The two Jennings brothers
and Tom O'Malley were captured by
four cf Fnited States Marshal Bennett's
men while traveling in a covered wag
on east of here towards the Arkansas
line. The deputies surprised them on
the read, and they surrendered without
firing a shot. The deputies then went
to a house near Bond Switch and cap
tured Morris O'Malley, catching him
in bed.
The Jennings boys and their follow
ers are charged with several crimes,
but were arrested particularly for the
held up of a Rock Island passenger
train in broad day light, several months
ag-. near Chickasaw. I. T. They are
also accused of having stolen 400 head
of cattle from the Chickasaw nation.
A.I Jennings has been a leader in Okla
homa politics. He was at one time
county attorney of Canadian county,
and is a lawyer of considerable ability,
and both Frank and Al are graduates
of the University of Virginia. Another
brother was killed by Temple Houston,
cf Texas, during a sabwn row about
two years ago. A! Jennings was shot
in the arm during the same affray. The
brothers come of a highly respected
family. Their father is probate judge
of Woodward county, Oklahoma-
FAILED TO IMPRESS THEJI
football Players Invite Virginia'-;
Legislators to Witness a Game.
Richmond. Va.. Dec. 7. In view of the
fact tnat a bill is pending in the Virgin
ia legislature to prohibit the game of
football on Virginia soil an exhibition
contest was arranged at Browd Park,
between the College and Richmond col
lege team, for which invitations were
sent to every member of the legislature.
There was no tender playing on ac
count of the impression to be made on
the law-makers present, but the game
was honestly and earnestly played and
was hot from start to finish. both teams
being in good condition and training,
and the game closing with the score of
6 to 0 in favor of the college team.
State Senator W. Barksdale. the auth
or of the anti-footbaii bill had a prom
inent seat and watched the concest with
interest and remarked at the close of
the game: "My opinion is in no way
changed, I think the game more bru
tal than a buil fight."
A number of tne other members had
never seen a game of football before
and the fact that they did not under
stand the game wiil not be in its favor
on the floor of the legislature.

AT HERBEDSIDL
The President is Again Beside
illis Dying Mother.
He Reached Canton at an Early
Hour This Morning.
RECOGNIZED 1IER SOX.
When Her Attention Was Call
ed to Her Son's Presence
MotherMeKinley Put Her Arms
About His Neck.
Canton. O., Dec. 7. Once more the
children of Xancy Allison McKinley
have gathered about her couch made
sacred by her tenacious struggle
against death. The reunion is com
plete. The president arrived before the
death angel made his visit and took
with him the spirit of the aged mother.
With the children are the other rela
tives, among whom is the aged sister
of Mrs. McKinley, Mrs. Abigail Os
borne, mother of Consul W. M. Osborne.
There as a joy unspeakable in the
breast of the president as he stood at
the bedside. He had been permitted
to again see his mother alive. He had
answered all the obligations of his
country. He had fulfilled his vows to
his people. He had witnessed the as
sembling of congress and had been
cheered with the news at the same time
that his mother was better.
In the little upper room at the Mc
Kinley homestead this morning, there
was a scene almost too sacred for pen
to write. The eyes of all present were
filled with tears as they v.iessed the
remarkable and almost miraculous ral
ly of the president's mother from the
unconscious state into which she had
fallen early in the morning. As her
son entered the room, accompanied by
his wife and Miss Mabel McKinley. the
sister of the president, Miss Helen
said :
"Mother, here are William and Ida."
The president kneeled by her bed
side, kissing his mother tenderly, rever
ently and as he did so she put her arms
about his neck and signified that she
knew him. She also recognized the
president's wife and reached her hand
toward her. She recognized Mabel Mc
Kinley and Jack Duncan.
It seemed to friends that she had
been awaiting the arrival of her son.
Soon after she lapsed into an uncon
scious state and the strength that had
been husbanded for the last meeting
of mother and son. seemed to leave her.
An hour after his arrival the presi
dent sat by the bedside holding the
hand of his mother. The attending
physician was surprised at the remark
able rally-. At 9:30 he said she was get
ting weaker, but he thinks she will live
through the day.
At 5 o'clock this morning, it was
thought by those irt attendance that the
president would not arrive before the
aged mother had died. He was inform
ed that such was thought to be the
condition. He was anxious to get to
her bedside. The run was a rapid one
from Pittsburg, but there was a slight
delay there in making the transfer to
the Fort Wayne track.
The p-residential party was made up
of Presidena and Mrs. McKinley. Sec
retary and Mrs. Day, Miss Mabel lic
Kinley. Jack Duncan, Miss Mary Bar
ber. The trip was made in the special
coach Xewpert. and was without spec
ial incident. The party was met at the
station by Mr. Abner McKinley, and
Mr. Charles R. Miller.
Dr. Phillips, who was present at the
time of the president's arrival and the
recognition, said that he had never
known such a recognition to occur in a
case where the person was as advanced
in years. It is plain to the president
however, that despite the rallies, she
has had. his mother has been failing
since he left.
Canton. O.. Dec. 7. Dr. Phillips left

however, disappointing that an offense
so grave and an example so far
reaching as this should have been vis
ited with so light a penalty. There is
no question but Private Hammond de
served punishment for his conduct, but
he should have received it in a law-ful
way. The military laws governing the
army are explicit. They prescribe the
duties of officers and enlistei men. len
der them, both ht.ve rights and obli
gations. When. therefore, an officer
with theinteliigeneeand experience with
which Captain Lovering is credited not
only violates these laws, but exhibits
such a lack of humanity as is shown in
this case he should receive a more se
vere sentence than a mere reprimand.
Committing such acts degrades the of

his wrongful acts."

given $l.t'00.i. but the two sens, who
nave vexed the father's soul with their
escapades, were shut out of his Bene

the two boys were the greatest favor

so far as possible, an equal show wdth
the daughters.

servative estimates at the time the will

The Europeans Can Hare Any

Port Au Prince, Dec. 7. The trouble
between Germany and Hayti appears to
be settled. The Hayti;. n government
has saluted the German flag and the
foreigners, who had sought refuge on
board ships, in the harbor, have return
ed to their homes.
It is understood that the question of
the indemnity demanded by Germany
for the aiieed illegal arrest and im
prisonment of Herr Lueders has !.t-ri
settled to the satisfaction of Germany
and that all the demands of that coun
try have been agreed to by the govern
ment of Hayti. in face of the display of
force made by Germany and under the
threat of a bombardment of the defen
sive works of the p.ort unless these de
mands were agreed to within the eight
hours following the time the German
ultimatum was delivered yesterday
morr.ing shortly after the arrival at
this port of the two German crui.-ers
sent to back up the demands of the
German minister here.
The first part cf the settlement took
place at 6 o'clock last nieht v hen the
Kaytian fleet formally saluted the Ger
man nag from the flagship of the rieet
of Kayti. the Crete a Pierrot, a smail
vessel armed with a fe.v guns of light
calibre.
Admiral Ki'.ick. the Haytian com
mander, had charge cf the formal sa
lute of the German flag. While the tlag
of the republic was being dipped o:
board the Crete a Pierrot to the stand
ard of Germany, the band of tne rlav

The second part of the settlement will
take place today when Ccunt Schweria.
the German minister to Hayti. ulii be
formally and sriemnly r-eeiyed by the
Haytian officials. The latter, it is un
derstood, have assured the German
authorities that summary justice v. ill
be promptly meted out to those of the
officials of Hayti who caused the es
trangement between the republic and
Germany.
Ail citizens of German nationality
who had sought refuse on hoard the
steamer in this port, have returned to
their residences, no further trouble 1 e
ing apprehended. The few French citi
zens who sought refuse on the French
steamer Vilie d'Marseiiles. which was
requisitioned for that purpose, from
Porto Rico, have also gone back to
their homes and businesses.
Xaturally- there is a strong feeling of
resentment against the government on
account of the humiliation Inflicted up
on the country by Germany but it is
not thought anything more serious than
a ministerial cr.sis will result.
