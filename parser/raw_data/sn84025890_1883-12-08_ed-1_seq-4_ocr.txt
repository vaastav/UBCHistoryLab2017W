" I am fond of rats, mice, moles,
roaches, flies, Hear, moths, ants, scor
pions, and like voivnin, hecause I have
studied their habits and ways nearly all
my life," said a little man "in spectacles
to a New York Sun reporter. He sat at
his desk in a small shop in a busy street
down town, writing busily. At his side
was a pen about five feet Ion?, two feet
wiac, ana tnree leer. deep. In it wero
twenty or thirty ferretd coiled together in
nn undulating mass of fur, with here and
there a sharp muzzle and a pair of bright
little eyes rising above the mass and
looking intently at the little man who
wrote at. the desk.
"There was a time, many years ago,"
continued the little man, wheeling around
in his chair, "when vermin were more
or 'less obnoxious to me, but I began to
study their habits and natures, and in a
short time I became so much interested
in them that all dislike disappeared. 3
went into the business of destroying
them about 1850, and since that I have
had my hands full. I make contracts to
rid houses, hotels, and institutions of
rats for so much a year. My charges
vary considerabty. For a good-sized city
residence I remove all rats and keep them
awav for a vear for 50."
"How do you do it?"
"With these little beauties," said the
little man, turning affectionately toward
thfe pen. As he did so the ferrets wrig-
fled out of the cosy tangle in which they
ad lain and bounded upward with their
fore paws in the air and their heads
thrown back, exhibiting joy at every
jump. The3T were pretty little creatures,
about as large in girth as an average
rat, but almost twice the length. Their
heads were rat-shaped, their four claws
very sharp, and their activity and quick
ness nmazing.
"I have a thousand of them," said the
. 1 - ., ... O' .
rat-catcher, "and I wouldn't sell the lot
for $20,000. I have trained them all so
that they obey me unhesitatingly. When
I wish to clear a house of rats I take some
of my ferrets five or six or ten and slip
them into the rat holes. I leave them
there all night, and whistle for them on
the following day. They come right to
me, and I take them home. No rat can
escape a ferret. The rat3 run from fer
rets like mad, but it is useless. Where
ever a rat goes a ferret can go. The
ferret catches a rat and then eat3 him
flesh, bones, hair, tail, everything.
Ferrets cannot live without rats for any
length of time. I feed mine hair, feath
ers, and fur regularly twice a week.
" Where do you get vour ferrets?"
"1 breed them. Different breeds can
be crossed as easily as with dogs."
He took a bit of raw meat in a big pali
vof iron nippers, and held it at a height ol
about four feet over the den of ferrets.
Every one of tho little creatures bounded
fiercely for the meat. He raised it as
they jumped, and only half a dozen ol
the best jumpers succeeded in fastening
their jaws on it. To show how tenacioush
the ferrets held their grip, the rat catchei
Bwung the meat around his head and
slammed the ferrets against the sides oi
the pen, but they could not be shaken
from their hold. Then he selected one,
seized it by the back "of tho neck, and
tore it loose from the meat.
" This one," he said, holding it aloftj
" is a new breed. It is a cross betweei
een
the American minx and tho Fitch ferret,
and can stand the climate better than the
uncrossed breed. FcrretstTequire consid
erable care, but I avoid any contagious
diseases bv a very simple plan."
"What" is it?"
"As soon as a ferret gets the least bit
off I shoot it and throw it away. It is a
wise plan, for the rest are never troubled.'
Instrnction of Deaf Mutes.
Alexander Graham Bell, whose name
is known to all who use the telephone,
vtakes a deep interest in the instruction oi
deaf mutes. In a recent letter on the
subject he says: "In 1878 I organized 8
day-school in Greenock, Scotland. At
my suggestion an unoccupied room was
secured in the Greenock academy, n
Bchool containing, I should think, up
ward of two hundred hearing children.
In this room the deaf children were
taught by a special articulation teacher
sent from America. They were caused
to associate with the hearing children in
the academy in every way possible. They
.played with them, and joined them for
instruction in writing, drawing and sew
ing. The success of this school has
been so great that the board of education
has adopted it as a permanancy, throwing
it open to all the deaf children of Green
ock and the surrounding towns. The
deaf pupils have formed many friend
ships among the hearing pupils of the
academy, with whom they converse freely
by word of mouth." He thon goes on to
speak of a similar school which he has
recently had opened in Washington, D.
C. "We have obtained a room in a
'building
occupied by a kindergarten
school for hearinjr children. There is a
large garden in connection with this
building, and the deaf children will play
with the hearing children in the play
ground, and join them for an hour or so
every day in the kindergarten occupa
tions. I think that the time has come
when some organized effort should be
mado to convince the public and the
more conservative teachers of the deaf of
the practicability of articulation teach
ing. The recent census shows us that
we have in this country about 34,000
deaf mutes, and that more than half are
under twenty-one years of age. New
schools must be established, and why
should they not be day schools, where
the children may learn to speak and
understand speech by the eye, and bo
kept in constant association with hearing
children?"

Corea and Madagascar. The new boundary
survey treaty with Mexico, a trademark, con
sular and a supplementary treaty of extradi
dition with Spain and conventions extending
the duration of the Franco American claims
commission have also been proclaimed.
I suggest that Congress create a, commis
sion to consider the general question of our
rights in the fisheries and the means of open-
conditions, the richly-stock d fishing water
j and sealing grounds of British and llutsian
i -North America.
Correspondence rolatiTe to the Clayton
Buhver treaty has been continued and will
be laid before Congress.
The legislation of France against the im
portation of prepared swine products from
the United States, has been repealed.
Germany still prohibits the introduction
of all swine products from America. A
friendly invitation was extended that gov
ernment to send experts to our pork grow
ing localities to examine the subject, which
was refused.
It is understood that measures for ths
rempval of the restrictions, which now bur
don our trade with Cuba and Puerta Rico,
are under consideration by the Spanish gov
ernment The proximity of Cuba to the United
States and the peculiar methods of adminis
tration which there prevail necessitate con
stant discussion and appeal on our part
from the proceedings of the insular authori
ties. I regret to say that the just protests of
this government have not as yet produced
satisfactory results.
The United States now parMcipating in a
reunion of the tariffs of the Ottoman Em
pire they have assented to the application of
a license tax to foreigners doing business in
turkey, but have opposed the oppressive
storage tax upon petroleum entering th
ports of that country.
The government of the Khedive has pro-pos-
d that the authority of the mixed judi
cial tribunals in Egypt be extended so as
to cover citizens of the United States accused
of crime, who are now triable before .con
sular courts. This government is not indis
posed to accept the change, but believe that
its terms should be submitted for criticism
to the commissioner to revise the whole sub
jeer. At no lime in our national history has
there been more manifest need of close and
lasting relations with nj neighboring Stato
th.'iu now exists with respect to Mexico. The
rapid influx of our capital and enterprise
into that country shows by what has already
been accomplished.
The provisions for the reciprocal crossing
of the frontier by the troops in pursuit of
hostile Indians have been prolonged for
another year. The operations of the forces
of both governments against these savages
have been successful, and several of their
most dangerous bands have been captured
or dispersed by the skill and valor of United
States and Mexican soldiers, fighting in a
common cause.
The boundary from tho Bio Grande to the
Pacific, having been ratified and exchanged,
the preliminary reconnaisance therein stipu
lalcd has been effec ed. It now rests with
Congress to make provision for completing
the survey and re-locating the boundary
monuments.
Our geographical proximity to Central
America, and onr political and commercial
re'ations with the States of that country ju3
ti'y, in my judgment such a material in-
I rrQ.-iRfi of onr conpular corns as will Dlnca at
each capital a consul-general.
In pursuance of the policy declared by our
government of extending our intercourse
with the Eastern nations legation have, dur
ing the pat year, been established in Persia,
Siam and Corea. It is probable that perma
nent missions of those countries will ore
long be maintained in the United states. A
special embassy from Siam is now on its
way hither.
China, by the payment of a money indem
nity, has settled certain of the long pending
claims of our citizens, and I have strong
hopes that the remainder will soon be ad
justed. There is good reason to believe that the
law restricting the immigration of Chinese
has boon iola;ed, intentionally or otherwise
by officials of China, upon whicli is devolved
tliedutyof certifying that the immigrants
below to the excepted classes.
Mea-ures have been taken to ascertain the
facts incident to this supposed infaction,
and it is believed that the government of
China will co-operate with the United States
in securing the faithful observance of the
law.
The question of tho general revision of the
foreign treaties of Japan has been consid
ered in an international conference held at
Eoldobnt, without definite results.
The rich and iopulous v alley of the Congo
is being opened to commerce by a Bociety
called "The International African Associa
tion," of which the KitJg of the Belgians is
the president, and a citizen of the United
Stnes tho chief executive officer.
It may become advisable for us to cooper
ate with other commercial powers in pro
moting the rights of trade and residence in
the Congo valley, free from the interference
or political control of any one nation.
I have alluded in my previous message to
the injurious and vexatious restriction suf
fered by our trade in the Spanish West In
dies; Brazd, whoe natural outlet for its
great national staple, coffee; is in aud
through tho United State, imposes a heavy
export duty upon that p o.lnct. A lite nar
row policy is pursued in other American
countries. Our petroleum expo ts are ham
pered in Turkey and in other Eastern ports
by restrictions as storage and by onerous
taxation, and the free outward movement
of our great food products is in some quar
ters clogged wiih like impediments.
FortbB&e mi6chiofs adeq Ate relief is not always af
fordtd by reciprocity treaties like that with Hawaii or
that lately negotiated with Mexico and now awaitins
thn action of the Senate. Is it not advisable to pro
vide soma measure of cqniiable retnliation in one rela
tion with RuvernraentB which discriminate against oui
own? If. for exnmple, the executive were empowered
to apply to Spanish vessels and cargoes from Cuba and
Puerfci ltico the same nile3 uf treatment and scale of
penalties lor technical faalts which are applied to onr
TKBRelB and cargoes in the Antilles, a resort to that
coarse miRht not be barren of RDtd results. A dUcre
t.onasy authority to forbid tho importation of articles
ol consumption injurious to health might be advanta
geously exorcited in our dealings v.ith such countries as

Hitherto the surplus, as ntpiily as it bu accumu
lated, has been devoted to the reduction of the national
debt.
As a result tho only bonds now outstanding are re
deemable at tho plasBnra of tnt government are tho
threo perccntB, amounting to about 'oo.ooo.ooo.
The tocr an i one-half percents, amounting to JKo.'
ooo,ot.o and tho I?37,ooo ooo four percents are not paya
ble nntil lail and i9u7, respectively.
In a cumnunicati'tn to the Congress at its last rassian
I recommended that all excise laws be abolished, ex
cept th fie relating to dfstilled spirits, and that Enb
stantial reductions be also made in the rerenuos fnm
cntfomB. A statute hHssInco been enacted oy which
tho annual tax receipts of the government h.ivo been
cut a own to the extent of at leaBtflltv or sixty milli ns
of dollars, While 1 have no doubt that till further re-
dnctins may be wisely made. 1 do not advise the adop-
tion at thiB session ot any zneisures for large diminu-
t.on ot me nst;onai revonufs.
In the interval which taunt elapse before thefiffectG of
the act of March 'A, 185, can be definitely a.scertalned,
a portion at least of th surplus revenues may be wisely
applied to the long-neglected Cnty ot rehabilitatint; our
navy and providing coast defenses ior the protection of
our liarbor.
Immediately associated with
the financial subject just discussed is tho important
question, what legislation is ncoded reardng the ni
tionil cunvner. The aggregate amount of bends now
on deposit in ini
ae treasury to support the national bank
circulation is about J?3o, ooo, ooo. Nearly Sou, ooo, ooo
of this amount consist, of three per centsTTwiiich, as
lati
already stated, are nsvabio at the measure of the
ernment, and are likely to be called in within less Lhsn
four years, unless meantime the surplus revenues shin
be dunintihed. The probable effect of ucli an exten
sive retirement of the securities which aro the basis of
national bank circulation wiiuld be such a contractisn
of the volume of the currency ss to pvoduce grave'eoni
incrcial embarrassments. How can tho danger bo ob
viated ? The most ehectual plan, and one whose adoo
tfon at the earliest practicable opportunity I shall
heartily approve, has already been indicated.
As an important measure of national de
fense, the secretary urges also the immidiato
creation of an interior coast line of water

I feel bound to impress upon the attention
of Congress the necessity of continued prog
ress in the reconstruction of the Navy. The
condition of the public treasury, as 1 havo
already intimated, makes the preson an au
spicious time for putting this branck of the
servico in a state of efficiency.
It is no part of our policy to create and
maintain a navy able to cope with that of
other great powers of tho world.
We have no wish for foreign conquest and
the peace which we have long enjoyed is in
no seeming danger of interruption.
But that our naval strength should be made
adequate for the defense of our harbors, the
protection of our commercial interests and
the maintenance of our national honor, is a
proposition from which no patriotic citizen
can wiuiaoia ms aEsent.
Tho report of the Postmaste-General con
tains a gratifying exhibit of the condition
and prospects of the interesting branch of
tho public service committed to his care. It
appears that on June 3. 18S3, the whole num
ber of postoffices was 47,683, of which 1,032
were established during the previous fiscal
year.
Admitting that its authority in the premi
ses is as ample as has ever been claimed for
it, it would not, in my judgment, be a wise
use of that authority to purchase or assume
the control of existing telegraph lines, or to
construt others kith a view of entering into
general competition with private enterprise.
I avow my belief, however, that the gov
ernment should be authorized by law to ex
ercise some sort of supervision over inter
state telegraphic communication, and I ex
press the hope that for attaining that and
some measure may be devised which will re
ceive your approbation.
The Attorney-General criticises in his re
port the provisions of existing law fixing the
fees of jurors and witnesses in the foUeral
courts.
It is manifest that such compensation as
might, when these laws were enacted, havo
been just and reasonable, would, in many in
stances, be justly regarded at the present day
as inadequate. I concur with the Attorney
General in the belief that the statutes should
be revised by which these fee3 are regulated.
So, too. should the laws which regulate the
compensation of District Attorney and Mar
shals. They should be paid wholly by sala
ries, instead of in part by fee3, as is now the
case. It would prevent much of the present
expensive litigation which is carried solely
to increase fees.
I particularly call your attention to his pre
sentation of certain phases of the Indian
question; to his recommendations for the re
peal of the pre-emption and timber culture
acts, aud for more strh gent legislation to
prevent frauds under the pension laws. The
'i: -.. -. --;-,- - . , -.i vv TV ,
ironies Trmai presence trie aeimnions ana
punishments of cnme3 relating to pensions
could doubtless bo made more effective by
certain amendments and additions which are
pointed out in the Secretary's report.
I have previously referred to the alarming
state of illiteracy in corti in portions of the
country, and again submit for the consider
ation of Congress whether some federal aid
should be extended to public primary educa
tion wherever adequate provision therefor
has not already been male.
He recommends more stringent laws to J
control and disrupt poligamy.
The department of agric ilture is accom-p'i-hing
much in the direction of the agri
cultural development of this country, aud
the report of the commissioner giving the
results of his investigations and experiments
will bo found iuteresting and valuable.
I trust that Congress will not fiil at its
present session to put Alaska under the pro
tection of law. Its people have repeat
edly remonstrated against our neglect to
afford them tho maintenance and protection
expressly guaranteed by the terms of tho
treaty whereby that treaty was ceded to the
United States.
The right of these railway corporations to
a fair and profitable return upon their invest
ments and to reasonable freedom in their
regulations must be recognized, but it seems
only just that, so far as its constitutional
authority will permit, Congress should pro
tect the people at large in their inter-Stato
traffic against aots of injustice which the
State governments are powerles to prevent.
Ho recommends the protection of forests
from which the country derives its supply of
water.
Ihe Centennial Exposition to be held next
year at New Orleans in commemoration of
the centenary of tho first shipment cotton
from a port of the United States bids fair to
meet with like gratiiying success. Under
the act of Congress of the 10th of February,
1SS3, declaring that exposition to be national
and international in its character, all foreign
governments with whidi the United States
maintain relations have been invited to par
ticipate. The Civil Servico Act is referred to as im
perfect, and asks legislation thereon.
j At tho time when the present .txocutive
entered upon hiB office his death, rcrnova1,
resignation or inability to discharge his du
ties would have left tho government without
a constitutional head
He asks legislation to prevent such a con
tingency. Ihe decision of the Supreme Court on the
fourteenth amendment is alluded to and he
asks that 6ome legislation be devised to
placo the colored people in the position said
amendment intended.
I commt-nd to your attention the verj in
teresting and thoughtful suggestions upon
this subjeot which appear in the secretary's
report.
The objection which he urges against the
acceptance of any other securities than the
obligations of tho government itself as a
foundation for National Bank circulation
eeemsto me insuperable.
For averting the threatened contraction,
two courses have been suggested, either of
which is probably feasible. One is the
assurance of new bonds, having many years
to run, bearing a low rate of mlere?t, nnd
exchangeable upon specified terms of those
now outstanding. The other course, what
commends itself to my judgment as the
better, is the enactment of a law repealing
the tax on circulation, and permitting the
banks to issue notes for an amount equal to
DO per cent, of the market value, instead of
ns now tho face value of their deposited
bonds. I agree with the Secretary in the
belief that the adoption of this plan would
afford the necessary relief.
The trade dollar was coined for the pur
pose of traffio in countries where silver passed
at its value, ascertained by its weight and
fineness. It never had a legal trade quality.
Large numbers of these coins entered, how
ever, into the volume of our currency. By
common oonsent their circulation in domes
tic trade has now ceased, and they have thus
become a distributing element. They should
not be longer permitted to embarrass our
currency system. 'I recommend that pro
vision be made for their reception by the
treasury aud 'ho mints as bullion, at a small
percentage above the current market price
of silver of like fineness.
From the report of the Secretary of War
it will be seen that in only a single instance
has there been any disturbance of tho quiet
condition of our Indian tribes. A raid irom
Mexico into Arizonawas made in March last
by a Email party of Indians which was pur
sued by General Crook into the mountain
regions from which it had come. It is con
fidently hoped that serious outbreaks will
not again occur, and that the Indian tribes
vhich have for so many years disturbed thp
West will hereafter remain iu peaceable sub,
mis?in.
1 again call your attention to the present
condition of our extended seacoast, upon
which are so many large cities whose wealth
and importance 'o the country would iu time
of war invite attack from modern armored
ships against which our exi-ting defensivo
works conld give no adequate protection.
Whose works were built before the introduc
tion of modern heavy rifled guns into mari
time warfare and if they are not put in an
efficient condition we may easily be subject
ed to humiliation by a hostile power greatly
inferior to ourselves.
The Secretary of the Navy reports that
under the authority of the Aots of August
5th, 1&S2, and March 3d. 1883, the work of
strengthening our Navy by the construction
of modern vessels has been auspiciously
begun. Three cruisers are in process of con-
struction. The Chicago of 4,rC0 tons dis-
placement ana me .Boston ana Atlanta, eacn

At precisely 12 o'clock Clork McPherson
took his stand at the clerk's desk, rappod
tho House to order and proceeded to calj
the roll of Representatives-elect. The State
of Mississippi having been reached, the
clerk said that he wished to make a state
ment as to his failure to put upon tho roll
the name of any Representative-elect from
the second district. Tho reason for this was
that no paper which could bo considered a
certificate of election in the sense of the law
had been presented to him. Mr. Chalmer.
had filed four exhibits in support of his
claim for the seat, but neither individually
nor collectively did these exhibits afford the
olork of tho House sufficient authority for
fcae enrollment of Mr. Chalmers. If the
Governor of Mississippi had issued a cer
tificate of election to any one it had not
been presented to the clerk. In regard tu

House for the honors conferred. The sig
nificant points of the address are as follow?:
T nm eni.A rranilnmari- flint, nil mnffprs of
legislation presented during this Congress
will receive from you such careful consider
ation as the magnitude and character of tho
interests involved require, and that your
action upon them will be wise, conservath e
and patriotic. Sudden and radical changes
in the laws and regulations affecting the
commercial and industrial interests of tii-j
people ought never be made unless impera
tively demanded by some public emergency,
and in my opinion, under existing circum
stances, such changes would not be favorably
received by any considerable number of
those who have given serious attention to
the subject. Applause. Many reform
are undoubtedly necessary, and it will be
your duty, aftor a careful examination of
the whole subject in all its bearings, to decide
how far they should extend, and when and
in what manner they should be mado. Ap
plause. K there be any who fear that you:
action on this or any other subject will actu
ally be injurious to any interest or even
afford reasouable cause for alarm. I am
quire sure that they will be agreeably disap
pointed. Applause. What the country has
a right to expect is strict economy in tho ad
ministration of every department of the
government, just and equal taxation for pub
lie purposes, a faithful observance of the lim
itations of the constitution, and a scrupulon
regard for the rights and interests of the
great body of the people, in order that they
may be protectd.as farasCocgress has power
to protect them, against encroachments from
every direction. Whatever can be done
under the circumstances surrounding ns to
meet this expectation ought to be done in
my judgment.
The other business of tha session was the
wearing in of new members -and a partial
consideration of the Mississippi contested
case of Chalmers, which was referred to the
committee on elections. The House ad
journed at 3.30 P. M.
SENATE.
The only business of importance in the
Senate was tho reading of the President's
Message, after which the following resolu
tion was offered by Senatar Wilson, of Iowa,
proposing the following amendment to the
constitution: "Congress shall have power by
appropriate legislation to protect citizens of
the United States in the exercise and enjoy
ment of their rights, privileges and immuni
ties, and to assure to them the equal protec
tion of the laws."
House.
The only important business in the House
waB the election of the officers to minor posi
tions, which resulted in the election of the
Democratic nominees, after tho reading of
President's Message.
The contested seats of members were re
ferred to the committee on lections, when
appointed.

After Three Days.
Mr. Chaiiles W. Mobbis, "Engle" office,
Pittsfield, Mas., writes, May 25, 188.1: "For
several month my wife's mother (Mrs. Amy
Boyce) had been in a very rrccarion3 condi
tion with dropsy or Bright's disease of the
hidneys, and having nsed all methods and
measures for her restoration in the line of
treatment by onr leading physicians, and
having failed to benefit her, her family de
spairedof seeing her relieved, and gave her
np to die. Happening to run across the tes
timony of a Mrs. Dawley. who had been cared
of similar sickness by nsin-r Hunt's Remedy,
we at onco procured a bol Ie of it, and com
menced giving it as directed. Aftor using it
threo days she was so far improved that she
could get from her bed to he- "hair without
assistance (a clrcnmstanro that had not hap
pened for months). Previous to taking it
she was troubled more or las with short
breath, requiring a continuous fanning lo
keep her alive. Thi3 gradually improved as
we continued tho uso of Hunt's Remedy, and
on the fourth bottle she was able to set up all
day. She was bloated terribly in both limbs
and body upward to tho lungs. The tenth
day tho bloating left her bowels, and now she
is not swollen above the kuees. Her kidneys
were very bad at the time, discharges being
of a bloody character and emitting a sicken
ing odor. I can say that the change in her
case has been wonderful, and Hunt's Remed
has worked a miracle in her."
