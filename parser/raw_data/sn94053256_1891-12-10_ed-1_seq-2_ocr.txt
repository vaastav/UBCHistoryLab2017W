The message of President Harrison
submitted to congress yesterday is a
moet important state document. It
treats such topics as the Chili outrage
and our relations with Italy in a calm
and digmhed manner. Matters of a
political nature are presented in a way
that will please those in political accord
with the president.
.The Princess Victoria Mary is sweet
24, and Prince Albert Victor is 27.
They say the princess isn't particularly
pretty, but that 6he possesses all the
cardinal virtue, which is ahere she
differs from her fiance, who has won
distinction by his collars, his cuffs and
vulgar vices. Being the eldest son of
the Prince of "Wales, he may some day
come to the throne, but it will be a
sorry day for Great Britain and Ireland
when that day comes.
John Parxell, brother of the late
Charles Stewart Parnell, proposes a
settlement of all disputes between the
contending parties in the Irish nation il
ists ranks. He says: "As the repre
sentative of the Parnell family, I will
insist that no further quarrel should be
kept up over differences, whether
wisely or unwisely inaugurated, so that
the two factions may come together.
I am confident of the place which his
tory will give to Charles Stewart Par
nell. As the man who set in motion
the ball for Irish freedom, his family
will insist that his personal affairs are
no longer matters of debate. Taking
up the platform upota which he led the
Irish people to the polls in 1885, we
can still unite and stand upon it. I
would propose that Kome such man as
William O'Brien, holding the confidence
of the Irish people, .should be called to
the leadership, around whom all should
rally. We would then surrender, the
Paris fund into the hands of the man
thus chosen. I am sure .that this is a
reasonable proposition, ; and, coming
from our side, it should be readily ac
cepted. I regret that so much rancor
has been displayed, but that is all past
now and our duty is with the future."
The New oik papers are .clamoring
for the repeal of the electrocution law
of that state. Warden Brown says that
the latest electrocution under his man
agement was a "complete success." If
this simply means , that Loppy was
killed, says the Advertiser, the warden
is warranted in styling the performance
a "success." But this success was se
cured by meansof no less than six min
utes of horrible tortures, which, by the
combined accounts, exceed in savagery
the most diabolical devices which the
worst barbarians of whom all history
makes any mention could inflict or in
vent. And the most hideous .view of it
the one that fairly forces itself upon
the public mind before all others is the
admission of the experts engaged in the
electrocution, that this infliction of
keenes agony jand suffering upon a
humen being ""is still-"experimentaT!"
The amount of voltage necessary to kill
the victim is a matter of "experiment."
If the first shock is not fatal, there is a
respite for the victim; then a second
shock, to be followed by a third. Such
minor matters as the baking, boiling,
blistering of the man are mere incidents
in the grand "experiment."
Let's reason together. Here's a firm,
one of the largest the country over; it
has grown, step by step, through the
years to greatness and it sells patent
medicines ! ugh 1
"That's enough !"
Wait a little
This firm pays the newspapers good
money (expensive work, this adver
tising I) to tell the people that they have
faith in what they sell, so much faith
that if they can't benefit or cure they
don't want your money. Their guaran
tee is not indefinite and relative, but.
definite and absolute if the medicine
doesn't help, your money is "on call."
Suppose every sick man and every
feeble woman tried these medicines and
found them worthless, who would be
the loser, you or they ?
The medicines are Dr Pierce's "Golden
Medical Discovery," for blood diseases.
and his "Favorite Prescription," for
woman's peculiar ills. If they help
toward health, they cost $1.00 a bottle
each 1 If they don't, they cost nothing I
MISCELLANEOUS.
There are only three words in En
glish that end in "ceed." They are ex
ceed, proceed, succeed. It is interesting
to note that only four English words
end in "cion," namely, coercion, epine
cion, internecion, suspicion, and only
four end in "dous," to wit, hazardous,
jeopardous, stupendous, tremendous.
A happy family dwells in an engine
house in Madison, Indiana, and the an
tics of the members afford amusement
to the fire company. The family is
composed of a coon, a cat, a pair of rab
bits, two white mica and a shepherd
dog. They occupy the same apartment,
sport tog-ether and eat from the same

The Hawaiian islands were dis
covered by Gaetano, a Spanish navigator,
in 154-2. The independence of these
islands was recognized by the United
States in 1829, and more formally in
1843; by Belgium in 1844, and by En
gland and France later in the same
year.
G orb am Gray, inventor of a kind of
wire by which the conductivity is in the
core instead of on the surface of the
wire, says he is convinced that tele
phony is practicable not only between
this country and Europe, through the
Atlantic ocean, but for 9,000 miles from
New York through to San Francisco
and Hawaii. Hello, there!
An Equivocal Puff. "'Did you see
the notice I gave you?" said the editor
to the grocer. "Yes, and I don't want
another. The man who says I've got
plenty of sand, that the milk I sell is of
the first water, and that my butter is
the strongest in the market, may mean
well, but he is not the man I want to
flatter me a second time."
Secretary Blaine is very proud of
the success achieved by his eldest son,
Emmons, who has just been appointed
assistant to the president of the Balti

charge of the western department of
the road. Secretary Blaine has never
recovered from the shock of his son
Walker's death, but his pride now cen
ters in his eldest son.

A strange story comes from Bruns
wick, Me. A worthy citizen of that
town was breaking ice, preparatory
to making some ice water. In the
middle of the square of ice he discov
ered a dark-brown substance. Cutting.
closer to this object, he saw that it was
a toad. While the gentleman was gaz
ing in amazement, at it, the toad, which
at first seemed lifeless, recovered ani
mation, and leisurely hopped away.
It is evident that there was no con
troversy about the source of the Mis
sissippi when the treaty of 1783 con
firming the independence of the United
States was signed. It was stipulated in
that treaty that the boundary between
the two countries should run from the
northwest corner of the Lake of the
Woods due west to the source of the
Mississippi. It was not discovered for
many years later that the sources of the
Mississippi are far south.
Hundreds' of mistakes creep into
maps through misinformation given by
savage or semi-civilized people, or the
misunderstanding of explorers. Here
is one instance: A conspicuous place,
the capital of the Laos country, east of
Burmah, has been known for many
years as Zirame, and the name has ap
peared in large letters on the maps.
The real name of this place is Chineg
Mai. The Burmese can not prc-nonnce
this name, and the name introduced on
our maps is their mispronunciation of

One of the most successful practical
Inventions recently perfected in Dres

employed on all varieties of fancy work
as well as on round and flat work,
capable of producing1 colored, striped
and vari-colored patterns without

gan stitch, pearl-Cardigan and two-and-two

machine has ever taken the place of
the knitting needle.
Mr. Theodore Bent who was sent
to investigate the famous Zimbabye
ruins in South Africa, writes home that
these ruins are undoubtedly of Phoeni
cian origin, and that the inscriptions
and other evidence he has found un
mistakably indicate the form of wor
ship, the manner of decoration, and the
system of gold smelting practiced by
the vanished people who erected the
structures. They are relics of a people
who were far advanced in civilization,
though the present inhabitants are
mere savages.
A distinguished foreign physician,
paying a visit to the Berlin Medical In
stitute, found Prof. Brieger busily at
work in the laboratory, surrounded by
a most formidable array of chemical
and bacteriological utensils. The pro
fessors sole attention and care, how
ever, appeared concentrated on one par
ticular vessel, which was enveloped by
smoke and steam. "Guess what I am
boiling here," said the professor to the
visitor. The latter began to enumerate
the entire scale of micro-organisms.
"Micrococci?" "No." "Gonococci?"
"No." "Spirochetal" "No." "What
then?" "Hot sausages," replied Brie
ger. This cut illustrates the Normal

Mr. Stillar'e BMolatloi on Committer
Chairmanship Adjournment.
Washington, Deo. 10. After Mm
read.g of the President's Message, Mr.
Hoi man, of Indiana, moved that the
House adjourn until Saturday, with the
understanding that lc should adjourn
on that day without doing any business
until after Wednesday.
Pending a vote on Mr. Holman's mo
tion, Mr. Miller, of Wisconsin (Dam.),
submitted a resolution requesting th
Speaker to apportion the committees of
the House among the several States ac
cording to populatiou, and that each
State receive at least one chairmanship.
The resolution caused a buzz, and Mr.
Milliken, of Maine (Rep.), called out:
"I think the Speaker should not be em
barrassed in this way. We have confi
dence in his ability to select his commit
tees." Before a discussion could take place,
Mr. Breckenridge, of Kentucky, moved
the reference of the resolution to the
Committee on Rules, and this was done.
The House then adjourned until Sat
urday. The Senate adjourned until to-day im
mediately after the reading of the mes
sage. House Committees.
Washington, Dec. 9. Some of the
prominent Democratic members of the
House are urging Speaker Crisp to
appoint the committees before the holi
day recess, but there appears to be con
siderable doubt as to whether this work
can be accomplished in so short a time.

Poughkeepsie, N. Y., Dec. 10. The

Suuol Sa-iti t be Umt,
Stockton, Cal., Dae 10. The state
ment is published here that Sunol, the
trotter, is crippled and there is little
hope of a cure being effected. The mare
went lame after her recent feat of
breaking the record, and despite the
best known treatment no relief was
reached. Expert horsemen here think a
ligament was strained, in which event
Sunol will be lame permanently.
Charles Marvin is reported to have said
that the lameness was caused by a blis
ter, and that the mare may recover,
but is apt to go lame again after fast
work.

Sunday, and President Sullivan of the
Pacific Rowing Association has accord

Bank, and John Massey, an ex-clerk of
the same institution, star ted y.esterJay to
make a sworn identification of the dead
dynamiter who wrought death and
destruction in Russell Sae' a oflice last
Friday. They said the man was John
Herbert Phillips, who was employed
with them for some years as an assist
ant bookkeeper in the bank. A dis
patch from Chicago, however, last
night, showed that PhiUips was alive in
that city.
Phillips was with the bank for three
years. His sahary was $700, but it is
claimed that as Phillip was a society
man in Brooklv'n that sum was not
enough for him. In order to provide
himself with sulQciout funds it is fur
ther charged he embezzled in small
amounts about ((3,000, and it was owing
to this theft that Detective Aiken's at
tention was part icularly drawn to hira
as he was engaged in ferreting .out the
thief.
lie saw the head in the glass recepta
cle yesterday at t he Morgue. It was not
in a good state o preservation, but even
under those disadvantages he identilied
it as belonging to .fhillips.
He said that he has had exceptional
cause to study Pbill ips's head, as he had
him under observation while he was un
der suspicion in th o bank and on ac
count of his peauliaifities.
IX'tective Aiken i;'ave the following
points of identiliCiitio u: The hea l he was
Buro of, and this was strengthened by the
fact, that tho dynamiter word such a
small shoe and had sucui a small lug that
it was at first supposed when these par
tions of his body wore found among the
ruins that they were believed to have
belonged to a woman.
Phillips wore a 4 1-2 shoe and was
very dainty about his dress. He was
often joked by the othtir clerks ou Lus
girl's letcs, as they called them.
Mr. ilaasey said that Phillips was al
ways dissatisfied with his condition.
He would suddrtuly start swearing over
his work, and the objects of his wrath
were al ways capitalists a&d wealthy peo
ple. He often argued on financial mattars,
and believed that the wealth of the
world should be equally distributed.
He was often heajd to say that he be
lieved he knevr way of "blulHng Gould,
out of a million." Mr. Massey said,
that Phillips was undoubtedly crazy.
Phillips was last seen in Xew York
two momhs ago.
A dispatch trom Chicago gives this
intormittion concerning the inau Phil
lips: Dispatches from New York staie
John Herbert Phillips is supposed to
have been the man who threw the dyna
mite bomb at Kusell Sag-e after de
manding $1,200,000. Phillips, the mait
referred to, was iu Chicago early last
spring.
He calldd at the oiDca of the Com -mei'Cial
Bank and presented a card
showing that he was or had been con
nected with the 11, mover National Bank,
of Sew Yorlc. After introducing him
self to David Vernon, the assistant
cashier, Phillips said he had been the
protest clerk o tha Hanover National
liauk, but was no longer in its employ;
that he had been iu Dover aad was the a
returning Hist. As -Mr. Veruuu recol
lects him Phillips was a dapper young
man with a dark luustaolu a.d haud
soiuely Uress'jd.
During the afterneou of ihe s inio day
the assistant cashier of 1 he Hanover
National, who happened ta be in Chi
cago ou his vacation trip, clroppe.1 into
the ollice of the Comm'erciitl National,
and in conversation with iir. Veruou,
said that Phillips had never boon pro
test clerk of the Hanover National, but
had at one time occupied .some minor
clerical position. Ho did not j;ive Phil
lips thj uighest character, and spoke oi
him as being a triile flighty at times.
Phillips's father was a retired sea
captain of considerable means. While
calling at the Commercial National
Phillips did not apply for a position or
ask a iavor of any kind.
The matter create! much -comment in
banking circles downtown, as Phillips
was quite well known, and a. so owing
to the fact that Kussell Saga p.ti'tiaUy
identilied the man from a photograph.
