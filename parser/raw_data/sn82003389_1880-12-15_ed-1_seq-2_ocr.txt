*I have this day retired from the edi
tonal management of this paper. The
reasons which have prompted me ni
taking this course are wholly of a per
sonal nature, but they are such that,
in justice to myself, are made impera
tire. To the publie, I now desire to
tender some acknowledgmenf of the
favors I have received at their hands,
while I express the hope that in my
successor their interests will find a.
more capable and efficient exponent.

T fR PESIIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The last annual message of Presi
dent Hayes contains but few augges
tions or recommendations that can
be deemed of general interest. In
deed, it may be said, that even the
well-informed public have come to
regard these voluminous State pt
pers as things more curious than
useful, and there are but few who
have the abundant leisure to indulge
in such an extravagant outlay of time
as is required to read and inwardly
digest such a vast array of facts, fig
ures and propositions, to say noth
ing of the con cieusness of utter ig
norance which nearly all will confess
in matters of statecraft.
Mr. Hayes indulges his prejudices
by abuse of the South, and alleges
that privileges conferred by the Con
stitutiý,nal Amendments are denied
her newly enfranchised citizens.
Reform in the Civil Service is stren
uonsly urged, and the "Spoilse Sys-.
tem" is strongly condemned.. The
. Mormons come in for a share of his
good offices, end the suppression of
their polygamie practices he insists
should be promptly enforced by the
exercise of the Federal authority.
I The financial condition of the
country and of the government are
shown to be very satisfactory, and
the gradual reduction of the Public
Debt is made to exhibit the extraor
dinary receperative capacity of the
country.
' He commends the great services
s General Grant has rendered to the
Union, and suggests that the office
' of Captain General be created for
him, "witH suitable provisions roea- -
ting to compensation, retirement, 1
etc.," which would in his judgment
'be altogether fitting and:proper, end
would be warmly approved by the
country."
The accumulation of business in 1
the United States Courts has made
it s necessity that there should be
as increase is the number of Ci euit
Judges, which he recommends should
he done at once. National aid he
thinks should be extended towards
the education of the masses, and the
public school system of the States
rendered more eflcient by increase
of the school fua4 from the sale of
public lands.
-OLD "Santa Clans" has again

The United States Supreme Court.
Several of the Justices of the Uni
States Supreme Court, will shortly
retire, on account of advanced age,
t and having served the time upon the
d Bench which entitles them to a full
pension. Judges Swayne and Strong
some time since, signified their in
tention of resigning, and Judge Clit
ford has been rendered ud~lt for fur
ther service by a stroke of paralysis.
f and' mst soon withdraw. Judge!
Hunt has also been a victim
r of paralysis, and Judge Brad
ley, covets the. seclusion of pri.
i. vate life, and derives no comfort from
n his uneviable fame as a member of
n the Electoral Commission. The
e youngest member of the Court is
ý. Judge Harlan, who is now forty-sev
,h en years of age. The last Southern
representative in the Court was John
A. (amnhll who raeigfned at the
outbreak of the war. The responst
bility in filling the vacancies will no
doubt be left to the incoming admin
istration. Will Mr. Garfield pur'sue
a step farther the conservative poli
cy adopted by Mr. Hayes, in the ap
pointment of a Southern man to a
place in the Cabinet, Agd give us one
member of the SupreME Court?

ness and the popular and enterpris

lishment on every hand, and tremen

we would like. Mr. Julius M. Na
site will extend the ooartesies of this

singular and admirable gift of ren
doring the visits of the public pecu

WlLLIAll MILLS.
This well-known citizen of Alex
andria died, at his residence in this
Town, on the 7th inst. Mr. Mills
wr.s one of the few of our remaining (
citizens who was identified with the
history of our Town and Parish dur
ing the period that they were most
prospnrous, and when our community
was noted for many men of remark.
able character. William Mills was a
native of Maryland, and he came to
Alexandria in 1835. Possessed
of sterling sense, indomita
ble energy and industry, and
of a very practical turn of mind, he
was peculiarly fitted to make his
mark among the people with whom
he cast his lot in those times, when
real worth and merit w, r the surest
means of securing recognition. Mr.
Mills had undergone thorough train
ing in the several branches of the
mechanic arts, and as architect,
carpenter and builder he had no su
perior. All, or nearly all of the
public edifices erected in this Town
and Parish, for the past forty years,
were built under his special superin
tendence, and the structures he has
raised will stand for many years to
attest his Industry, skill and useful
ness as a citizen.
He had acquired a handsome prop.
I erty when the war broke out, and the
fruits of his labor would have ena
bled him to pass his declining years
in comfort and ease, but the destrue
Lion of our Town by the Federals, in
1864, swept away his entire accum .n
s lations, and he had to begin life
l anew, as it were, after the close of
the war. He continued to labor In
his chosen calling until within a few
r days of his death, and by hie honest
exertonse, was enabled to supply
himself with the necessary comforts
Sof life.
The "Old Governor," as he was
Sfamiliarly called, was esteemed by
e all for his kindly disposition and
modest worth, and he will long be
a remembered by those who pay hom
age to the generation which is fast
disappearing, and which has done so
much for the material interests of
it the country, through the many event
d ful years of the past halt century.
