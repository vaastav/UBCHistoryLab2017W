STRIKING POINTS IN PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE
The department of war contemplate! an increase of the standing
force of the regular army from its present strength of 5,023 officers
and 102,935 enlisted men to 7, 130, officers and 134,707 enlisted men, and
supplementing the army by a force of 400,000 disciplined citizens.
It will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of
strength and efficiency.
The gravest threats against our national peace and safety have
been uttered within our own borders.
It is necessary for many weighty reasons of national efficiency and
development that we should have a great merchant marine.
It seems to me a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank
finance that In what we are now to undertake we should pay as we go.
We should be following an almost universal example of modern gov
ernment If we were to draw the greater part or even the whole of the
revenues we need from the Income taxes.
We have been put to the test In the case of Mexico and we have
stood the test. Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we
have pursued remains to be seen. Our concern for the Independence
and prosperity of the states of Central and South America Is not
altered.
STOTLER & DAVID, Dealers
Bonne Terre, Ho.
which plans long matured shall be
carried out; but It does make definite
and explicit a program which has
heretofore been only Implicit, held In
the minds of the two committees on
naval affairs and disclosed in the de
bates of the two houses but nowhere
formulated or formally adopted. It
seems to me very clear that it will be
to the advantage of the country for
the congress to adopt a comprehen
sive plan for putting the navy upon
a final footing of strength and effi
ciency and to press that plan to com
pletion within the next five years.
We have always looked to the navy of
the country as our flrBt and chief
line of defense; we have always seen
It to be our manifest course of pru
dence to be strong on the Seas. Year
by year we have been creating a navy
which now ranks very high Indeed
among the navies of the maritime na
tions. Wo should now definitely de
termine how we shall complete what
we have begun, and how soon.
The program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
live years of ten battleships, six bat
tle cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty
destroyers, fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-live coast submarines, four gun
boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni
tion ships, two fuel oil ships, and one
regular repair ship. It is proposed
that of this number we shall the first
year provide for the construction of
two battleships, two battle cruisers,
three scout cruiserH. flften destroyers,
live fleet submarines, twenty-live coast
submarines, two gunboats, and one
hospital ship; the second year, two
battleships, one scout cruiser, ten de
stroyers, four fleet submarines, fifteen
coast submarines, one gunboat, and
one fuel oil ship; tho third year, two
battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout cruisers. Ave destroyers, two
fleet submarines, and fifteen coast
submarines; the fourth year, two bat
tleships, two battle cruisers, two scout
cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet sub
marines, fifteen coast submarines, one
ammunition ship, and one fuel oil
ship; and the fifth year, two battle
ships, one battle cruiser, two scout
cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet sub
marines, fifteen coast submarines, one
gunboat, one ammunition ship, and
one repair ship.
More Men for the Navy.
The secretary of the navy is asking
also for the immediate addition to the
personnel of the navy of 7,500 sail
ors, 1,200 apprentice seamen, and
1,500 marines. This increase would
bo sufficient to care for the ships
which are to be completed with
in the fiscal year 1917 and also for the
number of men which must be put in
training to man the ships which will
be completed early In 1918. It Is also
necessary that the number of midship
men at the Naval academy at Annap
olis should be increased by at least
three hundred
If this full program should be car
ried out we should have built or build
ing In 1921, according to the estimates
of survival and standards of classifi
cation followed by the general board
of the department, an effective navy
consisting of 27 battleships, of the first
line, 6 battle cruisers, 25 battleships
of the second line, 10 armored cruis
ers, 13 scout cruisers, 5 first-class
cruisers, 3 second-class cruisers, 10
third-class cruisers, 108 destroyers, 18
fleet submarines, 157 coast submarines,
6 monitors , 20 gunboats, 4 supply
ships, 15 fuel ships, 4 transports,
3 tenders to torpedo vessels, 8 ves
sels of special types, and 2 ammuni
tion ships. This would be a navy fit
ted to our needs and worthy of our
traditions.
But armies and instruments of war
are only part of what has to be con
sidered if we are to consider the su
preme matter of national self-sufficiency
and security in all its aspects.
There are other great matters which
will be thruBt upon our attention
whether wo will or not. There is, for
example, a very pressing question of
trade and shipping involved in this
great problem of national adequacy.
It Is necessary for many weighty rea
sons of national efficiency and devel
opment that we should have a great
merchant marine.
It is high time we repaired our mis
take and resumed our commercial inde
pendence on the seas.
Need of Merchant Marine.
For It Is a question of independ
ence. If other nations go to war or
seek to hamper each other's com
merce, our merchants, It seems, are
at their mercy, to do with as they
please. We must use their ships, and
use them as they determine. We have
not ships enough of our own. We
cannot handle our own eommcree on
the seas. Our independence is provin
cial, and Is only on land and within
our own borders. We are not likely
to be permitted to use even the ships
of other nations In rivalry of their
own trade, and are without means to
extend our commerce even where the
doors are wide open and our goods
desired. Such a situation Is not to
be endured. It Is of capital import
ance not only that tho United States
should be its own carrier on the seas
and enjoy the economic independence
which only an adequate merchant ma
rine would give it. but also that the
American hemisphere as a whole
should enjoy a like Independence and
self-sufficiency, if it Is not to be drawn
into the tangle of European affairs.
Withoit such Independence the whole
question of our political unity and
self-determination Is very seriously
clouded and complicated indeed.
Moreover, we can develop no true
or effective American policy without
ships of our own not ships of war,
but ships of peace, carrying goods and
carrying much more; creating friend
ships and rendering indispensable
services to all Interests on this side
tho water.
Must Provide Ships.
With a view to meeting these
pressing necessities of our commerce
and availing ourselves at the earliest
possible moment of tho present un
paralleled opportunity of linking the
two Americas together In bonds of mu
tual interest and service, an oppor
tunity which may never return agrln
if we miss it now, proposals will be
made to the present congress for the
purchase or construction of ships to
bo owned and directed by the govern
ment similar to those made to the last
congress, but modified ill some essen
tial particular!. I recommend these
proposals to you for your prompt ac
ceptance with the more confidence
because every month that has elapsed
since the former proposals were made
has made the necessity for such action
more and more manifestly Imperative.
That need was then foreseen; it is
now acutely felt and everywhere real
ized by thOBC for whom trade Is wait
ing but who can find no conveyance
for their goods. I am not so much In
terested in the particulars of the pro
gram as I am in taking immediate ad
vantage of the great opportunity which
awaits us if we will but act in this
emergency.
The plans for the armed forces of
the nation which 1 have outlined, and
for the general policy of adequate
preparation for mobilization and de
fense, involve of course very large ad
ditional expenditures of money ex
penditures which will considerably ex
ceed the estimated revenues of the
government. It Is made my duty by
law, whenover the estimates of ex
penditure exceed the estimates of
revenue, to call the attention of the
congress to the fact and suggest any
means of meeting the deficiency that
it may be wise or possible for me to
suggest. 1 am ready to believe that it
would be my duty to do so in any case;
and I feel particularly bound to speak
of the matter when it appears that the
deficiency will arise directly out of
the adoption by the congress of meas
ures which I myself urge it to adopt.
Allow me, therefore, to speak briefly
of the present state of the treasury
and of the fiscal problems which the
next year will probably disclose,
State of the Finances.
On the thirtieth of June last there
was an available balance in the gen
eral fund of the treasury of $104,170,
105.78. The total estimated receipts
fur the year 1916, on the assumption
that the emergency revenue measure
passed by the last congress will not be
extended beyond its present limit, the
thirty-first of December, 1915, and
that the present duty of one cent per
pound on sugar will be discontinued
after the first of Ma,y, 1916, will be
$t70,365,500. The balance of June last
and these estimated revenues come,
therefore, to a grand total of $774,
435,605.78. The total estimated dis
bursements for the present fiscal year,
including $25,000,000 for the Panama
canal, $12,000,000 for probable dc
ticlenry appropriations, and $50,-
000 for miscellaneous debt redemp
tions, will be $753,891,000; and
1 lie balance in the general fund of the
treasury will be reduced to $20,644,
U05.78. The emergency revenue act, if
continued beyond Its present time lim
itation, would produce, during the half
year then remaining, about $41,000,
e00. The duty of one cent per pound
on sugar. If continued, would produce
during the two months of the fiscal
year remaining after the first of May,
about $15.000 000. These two sums,
amounting together to $56,000,000, If
added to the revenues of the Second
half of the fiscal year, would yield the
treasury at the end of tho year an,
available balance jf $76,644,605.78.
Tho additional revenues required
to carry out the program of military
and navaf preparation of which I have
spoken, would, as at present estimated,
be for the fiscal year 1917. $93,800,000.
Those figures, taken with the flguros
for the present fiscal year which I
have already given, disclose our finan
cial problem for tho year 1917. As
suming that the taxes Imposed by the
emergency revenue act and the pres
ent duty on sugar are to be discontin
ued, and that the halunce at the close
of the present fiscal year will be only
$20,644,605.78, that the disbursements
for the Panama canal will again be
about twenty-five millions, and that
the additional expenditures for the
army and navy are authorized by the
congress, the deficit in the general
fund of the treasury on tho thirtieth
of June, 1917, will be nearly two hun
dred and thirty-five millions. To this
sum at least fifty millions should be
added to represent a safe working bal
ance for the treasury, and twelve mil
lions to include the usual deficiency
estimates In 1917; and these additions
would make a total deficit of some two
hundred and ninety-seven millions. If
the present taxes should be continuod
throughout this year and the next,
however, there would be a balance in
the treasury of somo seventy-six and
a half millions at the end of the pres
ent fiscal year, and a deficit at the
end of the next year of only some fifty
millions, or, reckoning In sixty-two
millions for deficiency appropriations
and a safe treasury belance at the end
of the year, a total deficit of somo
one hundred and twelve millions. The
obvious moral of the figures is that it
is a plain counsel of prudence to con
tinue all of the preesnt taxes or their
equivalents, and confine ourselves to
the problem of providing $112,000,000
of new revenue rather than $297,000,
000. New Source! of Revenue.
How shall we obtain the new reve
nue? It seems to me a clear dictate of
prudent statesmanship and frank
finance that in what we aro now, I
hope, to undertake, we should pay as
we go. The people of the country are
entitled to know Just what burdens of
taxationthey are to carry, and to know
from tho outset, now. The new bills
should be paid by internal taxation.
To what sources, then, Bhall we
turn? This Is so peculiarly a question
which the gentlemen of the house of
representatives are expected under
tho Constitution to propose an answer
to that you will hardly expoct me to
do more than discuss It in very gen
eral terms. We should bo following
an almost universal example of mod
ern government if we were to druw
the greater part or even the whole of
the revenues we need from the in
come taxes. By somewhat lowering the
present limits of exemption and the
figure at which the surtax shall begin
to be imposed, and by increasing, step
by step throughout the present gradu
ation, the surtax itself, the income
taxes as at present apportioned
would yield sums sufficient to balance
the books of the treasury at the end
of the fiscal year 1917 without any
where making the burden unreason
ably or oppressively heavy. The pre
cise reckonings are fully and accurate
ly set out in the report of the secre
tary of the treasury which will be im
mediately laid before you.
And there are many additional
sources of revenue which can justly be
resorted to without hampering the in
dustries of the country or putting any
too great charge upon individual ex
penditure. A one per cent tax per
gallon on gasoline and naptha would
yield, at the present estimated pro
duction, $10,000,000; a tax of 50 cents
per horse power on automobiles and
internal explosion engines, $15,000,
000; a stamp tax on bank checks,
probably $18,000,000; a tax of 25 cents
per ton on pig iron, $10,000,000; a tax
of 50 cents per ton on fabricated Iron
and steel, probably $10,000,000. In a
country of great Industries like this it
ought to be easy to distribute the bur
dens of taxation without making them
anywhere bear too heavily or too ex
clusively upon any one set of persons
or undertakings. What is clear Is,
that the industry of this generation
should pay the bills of this generation.
I have spoken to you today, gentle
men, upon a single theme, the thor
ough preparation of the nation to care
for its own security and to make sure
of entire freedom to play the Impartial
role in this hemisphere and in the
world which we all believe to have
been providentially assigned to it. I
have had in my mind no thought of
any immediate or particular danger
arising out of our relations with other
nations. We are at peace with all
the nations of the world, and there is
reason to hope that no question in
controversy between this and other
governments will lead to any serious
bteach of amicable relations, grave as
some differences of attitude and policy
have been and may yet turn out to be.
I am sorry to say that the gravest
threats against our national peace and
safety have been uttered within our
own borders. There are citizens of
the United States, I blush to admit,
born under other flags but welcomed
under our generous naturalization
laws to the full freedom and oppor
tunity of America, who have poured
the poison of disloyalty into the very
arteries of our national ife; who have
sought to bring the authority and
good name of our government into
contempt, to destroy our industries
wherever they thought it effective for
their vindictive purposes to strike at
them, and to debase our politics to
tho uses of foreign intrigue. Their
number is not great as compared with
the whole number of those sturdy
hosts by which our nation has been
enriched in recent generations out
of virile foreign stocks; but it Is great
enough to havo brought deep disgrace
upon us and to have made it neces
sary that we should promptly make
use of processes of law by which we
may bo surged of their corrupt dis
temper America never witnessed
anything like this before. It never
dreamed It possible that men sworn
into its own citizenship, men drawn
out of great free stocks such as sup
plied some of the best and strongest
elements of that little, but how heroic,
nation that In a high day of old slaked ,
its very life to free itself from every;
entanglement that had darkened the
fortunes of the older nations and set;
up a new standard here that men j
of such origins and such free choice:
of allegiance would ever turn In;
malign reaction against the govern-!
ment and people who had welcomed!
and nurtured them and seek to make;
this proud country once more a hot-!
bed of European passion. A little!
while ago such a thing would have;
seemed Incredible. Because it was
Incredible we made no preparation!
for it. We would have been almost;
ashamed to prepare for it. as if we!
were Busplcious of ourselves, our own
comrades and neighbors! But the;
ugly and Incredible thing has actual-!
ly come about and wo are without ;
adequate federal laws to deal with It :
I urge you to enact such laws at the
earliest possible moment and feel that
In doing so 1 am urging you to do
nothing less than save the honor and
self-respect of the nation. Such crea
tures of passion, disloyalty, and an
archy muBt be crushed out. They are
not many, but they are infinitely
malignant, and the hand of our power
should cloBe over them at once. They
have formed plots to destroy property,
they have entered into conspiraciee
against the neutrality of the govern
ment, they have sought to pry into
every confidential transaction of the
government in order to serve Interest!
alien to our own. It Is possible to
deal with these things very effectually.
I need not suggest the terms in which
they may be dealt with.
Are Disgrace to the Nation.
I wish that it could be Bald that
only a few men, misled by mistaken
sentiments of allegianco to the govern
ments under which they were born,
had been guilty of disturbing the self
possession and misrepresenting the
temper and principles of the country
during these days of terrible war,
when it would seem that every man
who was truly an American would
Instinctively mako It his duty and his
pride to keep the scales of Judgment
oven and prove himself a partisan of
no nation but his own. But it cannot.
There are somo men among us. and
many resident abroad who, though
born and bred in the United States
and calling themselves Americans,
have so forgotten themselves and
their honor as citizens as to put their
passionate sympathy with one or the
other side In tho great European con
flict above their regard for the peace
and dignity of tho United States. They
alBO preach and practice disloyalty.
No laws, I Buppose, can reach cor
ruptions of the mind and heart; but I
should not speak of others without
also speaking of these and expressing
tho even deeper humiliation and scorn
which every self-possessed and
thoughtfully patriotic American muit
feel when ho thinks of them and of
the discredit they are dally bringing
upon us.
While we speak of the preparation
of the nation to make sure of her
security and her effective power we
must not fall into the patent error of
supposing that her real strength
comes from armaments and mere safe
guards of written law.
What Is more important Is, that the
Industries and resources of the coun
try should be available and ready for
mobilization.
The transportation problem is an'
exceedingly serious and pressing one
In this country. There has from
time to time of late been reason
to fear that our railroads would
not much longer be able to cope with
it successfully, as at present equipped
and co-ordained. I suggest that it
would be wise to provide for a com
mission of Inquiry to ascertain by a
thorough canvass of the whole que-,
lion whether our lawa as at preaent
framed and administered are as serv
iceable as they might be In the solu
tion of the problem. It is obviously a
problem that lies at the very founda
tion of our efficiency as a people. Such
an inquiry ought to draw out every
circumstance and opinion worth con
sidering and we need to know all sides
of the matter if we mean to do any
thing in the field of federal legislation.
Regulation of Railroads.
No one, I am sure, would wish to
take any backward step. The regula-;
tlon of the railways of the country by!
federal commission has had admirable;
results and has fully justified the;
hopes and expectations of those by!
whom the policy of regulation was;
originally proposed. The question is!
not what should we undo? It is,;
whether there is anything else we can;
do that would supply us with effective!
means, in the very process of regula-:
tion, for bettering the conditions un-;
der which the railroads are operated;
and for making them more useful serv-!
ants of the country as a whole. It;
seems to me that it might be the part!
of wisdom, therefore, before further;
legislation in this field is attempted, to;
look at the whole problem of coordina-! ,
tlon and efficiency in the full light of a;
fresh assessment of circumstance and!
opinion, as a guide to dealing with the
several parts of It.
For what we are seeking now. what
in my mind is the single thought of
this message, Is national efficiency and
security. We serve a great nation.
We should serve it in the spirit of Its
peculiar genius. It is the genius of
ct i ion men for self-government, to
il i. . y, Justice, liberty and peace. We
Bhould see to it that it lacks no Instru
mi nt. no facility or vigor of law, to
make It sufficient to play its part with
energy, safety and assured success. In
this we arc no partisans but heralds
and prophets of a new age.
