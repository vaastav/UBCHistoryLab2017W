President's Message.
Gentlemen, of the Senate and House of
Representative* :
Id addressing my third annual mee
aage to the law making branch of the
Government, it is gratifying to be able to
atate that during the past year success
has generally attended the effort to exe
cute all the laws found upon the statute
book. The policy has Deen not to in
quire into the wisdom of the Jaws
already enacted, but to learn their
spirit and inteat and to enforce them
accordingly.
TH? PAST YEAR
has, under ft wise Providence, been one
of general prosperity to the ofttioa. It
hfts, however, been attended with more
ihfto asuftl chastisements in the loes of
lift and property, by storm ftnd fire.
These disasters have served to call forth
the beet element of human natare in
our country, and develop a friendship
for us on the part of foreign nations
which goes far towards alleviating the
distrraa occasioned by these calamities.
The benevolent who have so generously
shared their means with the victims of
these misfortunes will reap their reward
in the consciousness of having per
formed a noble act, and will receive the
grateful thanks of the men, women and
children who?e suffering* they have
relieved.
FOKlWiX KKLATIOM&.
The relations of the United States j
with foreign powers continue to be
friendly. The year has been an cvent
Ail one in witnessing two great nations
spe iking one language and having one
lineage settling, by peaceful arbitration,
disputes of longstanding, and liable at
any time to bring those nations into
bloody and hostile conflict. An exam
ple has thus been set which, if success
ful in its final issue, may be followed by
otiier oivilized nations and be the final
means of returning tj productive in
dustry millions of men now maintained
Co settle the dispute; of nations by the
bayonet and sword.
THE TREATY OF WA9HIXGTOS.
I transmit herewith a copy of the
treat? alluded to, which has been con
cluded since the adjournment of Con
gress with Her British Majesty, and of
the conferences of the commissioners by
whom it was negotiated. This treaty
provides methods for adjusting all the
questions pending between the two
nations The Alabama questions are
to br adjusted bv arbitration, an J 1
recommend Congress at an early day to I
make ihe necessary provision' for the
meeting of this tribunal at Geneva, and
for the several commissioners on the
part of the -United States called
for by the treaty. His Majesty the
King o' Italy, the President of
the S'vi-w Confederation, and His
Majesty the Emperor of Brazil
have each conferred, on the joint request
of the t*-i pnvers. to name an arbitrat
or for t lii* tribunal at Geneva. I have
caused my thanks to be suitably ex
pressed for the readine-n with which
the joint request ha- been complied
with by the appointment of gentlemen
of eminence and learning to those im
portant positions. His Maj esty the Em
peror of Germany has also been pleased
to comply with the joint request of
the twoGovernments, and has consented
to act as the arbitrator of the disputed
water boundary between the United
States and Great Britain. The con
tending parties in the treaty have un
dertaken to regar 1. as between them
?elves, certain principle* of public law
for which the United States has con
tended from the commencement of its
history. They have aI.*o agreed to
bring these principles to the knowledge
of the other maritime postern and to
invito them to accede to them. Nego
tiations are going on as to the form in
which the invitation is to be extended
to theae powers.
THE FISilECIKS.
I recommend the legislation neces
sary, on the part of the United States,
to bring into operation the arrioles of
the treaty relating to the fisheries and
to the other matters touching the rela
tions of the United States toward the
British North American Possessions, to
become operative as soon as the proper
legislation shall be had on the part of
Great Britain and its Possessions. It is
much to be desired that this legislation
may become operative before the fisher
men ef the United States begin to make
their arrangementa for the coming sea
son.
THB LAKES AND CANALS.
I have ad lressed a communication,
of which a copy is transmitted here
with, to the Governors of New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan.
Illinois, and Wisconsin, urging upon
the Governors of these States, respect
ively, the neces&uy action on their part
to carry into effect the object of the
article of the treaty which contemplates
the use of the canals on either side,
connected with the navigation of the
lakesand rivers forming the boundarv,
on terms of equity by the inhabitants of
both countries. It is hoped that the
importance of the object, and the benefit !
to flow therefrom, will secure the
speedy approval and legislative sanc
tion of the States concerned.
THE BOrNDARV QUESTION.
I renew the recommendation for an
appropriation for determining the
true position of the forty-ninth parallel
of latitude where it forms the boundary
between the Unite.! States and the
British Provinces, between the Lake
of the Woods and the summit of the
Rocky Mountains. The early action of
Congress on the recommendation named
would put it in thepower of the War
Diparment to place a force in the field
during the next summer.
FRANCS AND GERMANY.
The resumption of diplomatic rela
tion between France and Germany has
enabled me to live directions for the
withdrawal of the protection extended
to the Germans in France by the dis*
plomatic and consular representatives
of the United States in that country.
It is just to add that the delicate dutv
of this protection has been performed
by the Minister and Consul General at
Paris and the various consuls in France
under the supervision of the former,
with great kindness as well as
with prudence and tact.- Their
course has received the commenda
tion of the German government,
and bas wounded the susceptibility
of ihe French. The Government of the
Emperor of Germany continues to man
ifest a friendly feeling toward the United
States and a desire to harmonize with
the moderate and jnst policy which this
government maintains in its relations
with the European Powers as well as
with Uae South American Republics. I
have given an assurance that the friend
ly feelings of that government are fnllv
shared by the United States. The rati
fication of the Coasolar and Naturali
sation Conventions with the Austro
Jlnngariao Empire have been exchang
ed. 1 have been officially informed of
the annexation of the States of the
Church to the Kingdom of Italy and the
removal of the Capital of the Kingdom to
the city of Rome. In conformity with
the established policy of the United
States, I have recognized this change.
The ratification of the new treaty of
commerce between the United States
and Italy bM been exchanged. The
two powers have agreed in their treaty
that property at sea shall be exempt
from capture in case of war between the
two powers. The United States has
spared no opportunity of incorporating
this rule into the obligations of nations.
SPANISH CLAIMS.
The Forty-first Congress, at its URrd
session, made an appropriation for the
organization of a mixed commission for
adjudicating upon the claims of citizens
of the United States against Spain,
growing out of the insurrection in
Cuba. The commission has since been
organized, and I transmit herewith the
correspondence relating to its formation
and jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that
this convention will afford claimants a
complete remedy for their injuries.
It has been made the agreeable duty
of the United States to preside over a
conference at Washington between the
plenipotentiaries of Spain and the
allied South American Republics,
wbich has resulted in an armistice, with
the reasonable assurance of a per
manent peace.
THE MCSCOVY DICK.
The intimate and friendly relations
which have so long existed between the
United States and Russia continue un
disturbed. The visit of the son of the
Emperor is a proof that there is no desire
on the part of his government to dimin
ish the cordiality of tho^e relations.
The hospitable reception which has
been given to the Grand Duke is proof
that on our side we share the wishes of
that government. The inexcusable
course of the Russian Minister at Wash
ington rendered it necessary to ask his
recall, and to decline to longer receive
that functionary in a diplomatic rela
tion. It is impossible with self respect,
or with a just regard for the dignity of
the country to permit Mr. Catacazy to
continue to bold intercourse with this
government after abusing the govern
ment officials, and during bis persistent
interference, through various means,
with the relations between the United
States and other powers. In accordance
with my wishes, this government has,
been relieved of further intercourse
with Mr. Catacazy, and the manage
ment of the Imperial legation has pas
6ed into the hands of a gentlema nen
tirely unobjectionable.
With Japan we continue to maintain
friendly relations. The CaWinet of the
Mikado has, since the close of last ses
sion of Congress, selected citizens of the
United StatC3 to serve in offices of
much importance in the several depart
ments of that government. I have rea
sons to think that this selection is due
to an appreciation of the disinterested
ness of the policy which the United
States has pursued toward Japan. It
is our desire to continue to maintain
this disinterested and just policy with
China as well as Japan. The corre
spondence transmitted herewith shows
there is no disposition on the part of
this government to swerve from its es
tablished course
TUE COREA DIFFICULTY
Prompted by a desire to put an end
to the barbarous treatment ol our ship
wrecked eailorn on the Corean coast, I
instructed our minister at Pekin to
endeavor to conclude a convent on with
Corea for securing the safety from
inhuman treatment of such mariners.
Admiral Rogers was instructed to ac
company him with a sufficient force to
protect him in case of need. A small
surveying party was sent out, and on
reaching the coast was treacherously
attacked at a disadvantage. Ample
opportunity was given for explana
tion and apology for the insults, but
neither came. A force was then
landed, and after a forced march
over a rugged and difficult country, the
forts from which the outrages had been
committed were gallantly assaulted and
were destroyed. Having thus punished
the criminals and having vindicated the
honor of the flag, the expedition re
turned. Finding it impracticable under
the circumstances to conclude the de
sired Convention, I respectfully refer
you to the correspondence relating
thereto herewith submitted, and leave
the subject for such action as Congress
may see fit to take.
THE VESICA* SMUGGLERS.
The Republic of Mexico has not yet
repealed the very objectionable law es
tablishing what is known as the free
zone on the frontier of the United
States. It is hoped this may yet be
done, and also that more stringent mea
sures may betaken by that republic for
restraining lawless persons on its fron
tiers. I hope that Mexico, by its own
action, will soon relieve this govern
ment from the difficulties experienced
from this cause.
Our relations with the various re
publics of
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
continues, with one exception, to be
cordial and friendly. I recommend
some action by Congress regarding the
overdue instalments under the award of
the Venezuela claims commission of
1866. The internal dissentions of this
government present no justification for
the absence of an effort to meet their
solemn treaty obligations. The ratifi
cation of our extradition treaty with
Nicaragua has been exchanged. It is
a subject for congratulation that the
great Empire of Brazil has taken the
initiatory steps toward the abolition of
slavery. Our relations with the
empire, always cordial, will natur
ally be made more so by this
' act, and it is not too much to hop* that
the government of Brazil may hereafter
find it for its interest, as well as intrin
sically right, to advance toward entire
emancipation more rapidly than the
present act contemplates. The true
prosperity and greatness of a nation is
to be found in the education and eleva
tion of its laborers. It is a subject for
regret that the reforms in this direction,
which were voluntarily promised by the
statesmen of Spain, have not been
carried out in its West Indian colonies.
The laws and regulations for the appa
rent abolition of slavery in Cuba and
Porto Rico leave most of the laborers in
bondage with no hope of release, until
their lives become a burden to their
employers. I desire to direct your at
tention to the fact that the citizens of
the United States are large holders in
foreign lands of this species of property
forbidden by the fundamental law of
their adopted country. I recommend
to Congress to provide by stringent leg
islation a suitable remedy against bold
ins, owning, or dealing in slaves, or
being inteiested in slave propertv in
foreign lands, either as owners, hirers
or mortgagees, by citizens of the United
States. It is to be regretted that the
disturbed condition of
THE ISLAND OP CUBA
continues to be a source of annoyance
and anxiety. The existence of a pro
longed struggle in such close proximity
to our territory without apparent pros
pect of early termination, cannot be
other than an object of concern to a
people who, while abstaining from in
terference in the affairs of other powers,
naturally desire to see every country in
the undisturbed enjoyment of peace,
liberty and the blessing of free institu
tions. Otirnaval commanders in Cuban
waters have been instructed, in case it
should become necessary, to spare no
effort to protect the lives and property
of bona fide American citizens, and to
maintain the dignity of the flag. It is
to be hoped that all pending questions
with Spain growing out of the affairs of
Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit of
peace and civilization which has hith
erto guided the two powers in their
treatment of such questions.
SCHOOLING FOR FOREIGN SERVICE.
To give importance and to add to the
efficiency of our diplomatic affairs
with Japan and China anl to further
aid in retaining the good opinion of
these people, and to secure to the
United States its share of the commerce
destined to flow between these nations
and the balance of the commercial
world, I earnestly recommend that an
appropriation be made to support at
least four American youths in each of
the^e countries to serve asa part of the
official family of our Ministers
there. Our representatives would
not, even then, be placed upon
an equality with the representatives of
Great Britain and some other powers.
As now situated, our representatives in
Japan and China have to depend for
interpreters and translators upon natives
of these countries who know our lan
guage imperfectly, or procure for the
occasion the services of the employes in
foreign bueinefs houses, or the inter
preters of other foreign ministers.
SUBSIDIES TO STEAMERS.
1 would also recommend liberal mea
sures for the purpose of assisting the
American lines of steamers now plying
between S;in Francisco, Japan and
China, and the Australian line, almost
our on'y remaining lines of ocean
steamers and of increasing their service.
THE NATIONAL DEBT
has been reduced to the extent of
$86,057,129.80 during the year and by
the negotiation of National bonds, at a
lower rate of interest. The interest on
the public debt has been so far
diminished that the sums to be raised
for the interest account is nearly
#187,000,000 less than on the first of
March, 1869. It was highly desirable
that this rapid diminution should take
place both to strengthen the credit of
the country and to convince its citizens
of their entire ability to meet every
dollar of liability without bankrupting
them, but in view of the accomplish
ments of these deeirable results, of
the rapid development ol the re
sources of the country, its increasing
ability to meet large demands, and the
amount" already paid.it is not desir
able that the present resources of the
country should continue to be so taxed,
in order to continue this rapid payment.
TAXES AND FI.VAXCK.
I there ore recommend a modification
of both tariff and internal tax law?. I re
commend that all taxes from internal
sources be abolished, except those on
spiriiuous, vinous and male liquors,
tobacco in its various forms, and for
stamps. In readjusting the tariff I sug
gest that a careful estimate be made of
the amount of surplus revenue collected
under the present laws, after providing
for the current expenses of the govern
ment, interest account and a sinking
fund, and that this surplus be reduced
in such a manner as to afford the
greatest relief to the greatest num
ber. There are many articles not
produced at home, such as medicines
and compounded essences, trom which
very little revenue is derived, but which
enter into general use. All such arti
cles I recommend to be placed on the
free list. Should a further reduction
prove advisable, I then recommend that
it be made on those articles which can
be reduced without disturbing home
production or reducing the wages of J
American labor. I have not entered^
into figures, because to do so would be
to repeat all that is laid before you in
the report of the Secretary of the
T reasury. The present laws for collect
ing the revenue pay the collectors of
customs small salaries but provide for
shares of all seizures whicb, at the
principal ports of entry particularly,
raises the compensation of these offi
cials to a large sum. It has always
seemed to me as if this
system nui9t at times work perniciously
in holding out inducements to dishonest
men. should such get into possession of
the offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of
goods entered in order to enable them
finally to make large seizures. Your
attention is respectfully invited to this
subject. The continued fluctuation in
the value of gold, as compared with the
National currency, has a most damag
j ing effect upon the increase and devel
opment of the country, in keeping up the
prices of all articles necessary in everv
day life. It gives rise to a spirit of
gambling prejudicial alike to the Na
tional morals and the National finances.
The question to be met is how to get a
fixed value to our currency. That value
is constantly and uniformly approach
ing a specie basis, for with "specie every
desirable object will be gained.
FOR THE OPERATION'S OF TUB ARMY
in the past year, the expense of main
taining it. the estimates for the ensuing
year, and for continuing the sea coast
and other improvements conducted un
der the supervision of the War Depart
ment, I refer you to the accompanying
report of the Secretary of War. I call
your attention to the provisions of the
?f C<?n?reM aPPr<>ved March 3d,
1869, which discontinues promotions
in the staff corrs of the army, until
provided for by law. 1 recommend that
the number of officers in each grade of
the staff corps be fixed, and that when
ever the number in any one grade falls
below the number as fixed, that the
vacancy may be filled by promotion
from the grade below. I also recom
mend that when the office of chief of
a corps becomes vacant, the place may
be filled by selection from the corps in
which the vacancy exists.
TDK xavt.
The report of the Secretary of the
Navy shows an improvement in the
number and efficiency of the naval
force without a material increase in the
expense of supporting it. This is due
i to the policy which has been adopted
and is being extended as fast as our
material will admit, of using small
vessels as cruisers at tKe several sta
tions. By these means we have been
enabled to occupy at once a larger ex
tent of cruising ground, to visit, more
frequently the posts where the presence
of our flag is desirable, and generally
discharge efficiently the appropriate
duties of the navy in time of peace,
without eiceeding the somber of men
or the expenditures authorised by lav.
Daring the part year the nary has, in
addition to its regular service, supplied
the men and officer* for the vessels of
the coast server, and has completed
the surreys authorized by Congress of
the Isthmus of Darien and Tebuaute
pec, and under the same authority has
sent out an expedition completely fur
nished and equipped to explore the
unknown oceans of the North. The
suzgestions of the report as to the
necessity for increasing and improring
the materisl of the nary, and the plan
recommended for reducing the pereon
nel of the serrice to a peace standard,
by the gradual abolition of certain
grades of officers, the reduction ol
others, and the employment of some in
commercial marine, are well considered,
and deserre the thoughtful attention of
Congress. I also recommend that all
promotions in the navy abore captain
be by selection instead of by seniority.
This course will secure in the higher
greads greater efficiency, and hold out
an incentire to young officers to im
prore theraeelres in the knowledge of
their profession. The present cost of
maintaining the nary and its cost, com
pared with that of the preceding year,
and the estimates for the ensuing year,
are contained in the accompanying re
port of the Secretary of the Nary.
TUB POSTOFFICB DEPARTMENT.
The enlarged receipts of the Poet*
office Department, as snown by the ac
companying report of the Postmaster
General, exhibits a gratifying increase
in that branch of public service. It is
an index of the growth of education
and of the prosperity of the people in
elements highly conducive to the vigor
and stability of republic?. With a vast
territory like ours, much of it sparsely
populated, requiring the services of the
mails, it is not at present to be expected
that this department can be made self
sustaining, but a gradual approximation
to this end from year to year is con
fidently relied upon, and the day is not
far distant when the Postoffice depart
ment of the Government will prove a
much greater blessing fo the people
than it is now. The suggestions of the
Postmaster General for improvements
in the department presided over by
him, are earnestly recommended to
your special attention, especially the
documents favorable to the considera
tion of the plan for uniting the telegraph
system of the United States with the
postal system. It is believed that
by such a course the cost of tele
graphing could be much reduced,
and the service ax well, if
not better, rendered. It would
secure the further advantage by ex
tending the telegraph through portions
of the country where private enterprize
will not construct it. Commerce, trade,
and above all the efforts to bring a
people widely separated into a com
munity of interest, are always
benefitted by a rapid intercommunica
tion. Education, the ground work of
Republican institution, is encouraged
by increasing the facilities for bringing
speedy news from all parts of the coun
try, and the desire to reap the benefit of
such improvements will stimulate learn
ing. I refer you to the report of the
Postmaster General for full details of
the operation of last year, and for com
parative statements of the result within
four years.
THE KU-KLCX LAW.
There has been imposed upon the
executive branch of the Government
the execution of the act of Congress ap
proved April 20, 1874, and commonly
known as the Ku-Klux law. In a por
tion of the State of South Carolina the
necessity of the course pursued will be
demonstrated by the report of the com
mittee to investigate the Southern out
rages. Under the provisions of the
above act, I issued my proclamation
calling the attention of the people of
the United States to the same and de
claring my reluctance to exercise any ol
theexiraordinary powers thereby confer
red upon me except in case of imperative
necessity, but making known my pur
pose to exercise such powers whenever
it should become necessary to do so for
the purpose of securing to all citizens of
the United States the peaceful enjoy
mentof their rights, guaranteed therein
by the Constitution and the laws. Af
ter the palace of this law informa
tion was received from time to time that
combinations of the character referred
to in this law, existed and were power
ful in many parts of the Southern
States, particularly in certain coun
ties in the State of South Carolina
Careful investigation was made and it
was ascertained that in counties of that
State such combinations were active
and powerful, embracing sufficient por
tions of the citizens to control the local
authority and having, among other
things, the object of depriving the
emancipated class of the substantial
benefits of freeJom and of preventing
the free political action of those citi-j
zens who did not sympathize with their'
own views. Among their operations
were frequent scourging and occasional
assassinations, generally perpetrated
at night by disguised persons, the
victims in almost all ca*es being
citizens of different political sen
timents from their own, or free per
sons who had shown a disposition to
claim equal rights.with other citizens.
Thousands of inoffensive and well
disposed citizens were the sufferers by
this lawless violence. Thereupon, on
the 13th of October, 1871, a proclama
tion was issued in the terms of the law
calling upon the members of these com
binations to disperse within five days
and to deliver to marshals or military
officers of the United States all arms
and amunit;on, uniforms, disguises and
other means and implements used
by them for carrying out their unlawful
purposes. This warning not having
been heeded, on the 17th of October
another proclamation was issued,
suspending the privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus in nine countiss in that
State, and direction was given that
within the counties so designated, per
sons supposed, upon creditable informa
tion, to be members of such unlawful
combinations, should be arrested
by the military forces of the
United States and delivered to the Mar
shal to be dealt with according to law.
j Id two of said connties, York and Spar
tanburg, many arrests have been made.
At last accounts the number of persons
| thus arrested was 168. Several hun
! ared, whose criminality was ascertained
to be of an inferior degree, were released
for the present These have generally
made confessions of their guilt. Great
caution has been exercised in making
these arrests and notwithstanding this
large number, it is believed that do in
nocent person is now io custody. The
prisoners will be held for regular trial
id the judicial tribunals of the United
States.
As soon ^ it appeared that the au
thorities of the United Statss were
about to take vigorous measures to en
force the law, many persons abscon
ded and there ia good ground for sup
posing that all sacb persons bare vio
lated the lair. ? lull report of what
has been done under the law will be
submitted to Congress by the Attorney
General.
THE XOKJfOK QCESTIOX.
In Utah there still remains a rem
nant of barbarism, repugnant to civili
zation and decency and the laws of the
United States. Territorial officers, how
ever, have been found who are willing
to perform their duty in a spirit of
equity and with a due sense of sustain
ing the majesty of the law. Neither
polygamy uor "any other rio'ation of
existing statutes will be permitted with
in the territory of the United States. It
is not with the religion of the self-styled
Saints that we are now dealing, but with
their practices. The? will be protected
in the worship of God according to the
dictates of their consciences, but they
will not be permitted to violate the
laws under the cloak of religion. It
may be advisable for Congress to con
sider what in the execution of the laws
Xinst polygamy is to be the status of
ral wives and their offspring. The
propriety of Congress passing an ena
bling act authorizing the Territorial
Legislature of Utah to legitimatize all
born prior to a time fixed in the act,
might be justified by its humanity to
the innocent children. This is a sug
gestion only, and not a recommenda
tion.
THE INDIAX rOLICT.
The policy pursued toward the In
dians had resulted favorably so far as
can be judged from the limited time
during which it has been in operation.
Through the exertion of the various
societies of Christians to whom has been
entrusted the execution of the policy,
and the Board of Commissioners au
thorized by the law of April, 1869,
many tribes of Indians have been in
duced to settle on reservations, to culti
vate the soil, to perform productive
labor of various kinds and to partially
accept civilization. They are being
cared for in such a way that
it ? is hoped may induce tho?e
still pursuing their old habits of
life to embrace the only opportunity
which is left them to avoid extermina
tion. I recommend liberal appropria
tions to carry out the Indian peace
policy, not only because it is humane,
Christian-like and economical, but be
cause it is right. I recommend to your
favorable consideration also the policy
of granting a territorial Government to
the Indians of the Indian territory
west of Missouri and south of Kansas,
and in doing so every right guaranteed
to the Iudians by treaty should be ob
served Such a course might be the
means of collecting most of the Indians
now between the Missouri and the
Pacific, and south of the British pos
sessions, into one territory, or one
State. The Secretary of the Interior
has treated this subject at length, and
I recommend to you his suggestions.
THE PUBLIC LANDS.
I renew ray recommendation that the
public lands be regarded as a heritage
to our children, to be disposed of onlv
as required for the occupation of actual
settlers. Those already granted have
been in a great part disposed of in such
a way as to secure access to the balance
by the settler who may wi*h to avail
himself of them, but caution should be
exercised in attaining so desired an ob
ject. The educational interest may well
be served by the grant of the proceeds
of the tale of public land to settlers. I
do not wish to be understood as recom
mending in the least dtgree a departure
from what is being done by the general
government for the encouragement of
education.
THE CEXSt'8.
The report of the Secretary of the
Interior submitted with this will give
you information collected and prepared
for publication in regard to the census
taken during the year 1870. The oper
ations of the Bureau of Elucation for
the year, the Patent Office, Pension
Office, State Office and Interior Bureau
are submitted. The reports of the Com
missioner of Agriculture gives the oper
ations of his department for the year.
As agriculture is the ground work of our
prosperity, too much importance cannot
be attached to the labors of the depart
ment. It is in the hands of an aUe
head with able assistants, all zealously
devoted to introducing ir.to the agricul
tural productions of the nation all
useful productions adapted to ? any
of the various climates and
soils of our vast territory, and to g'ving
all useful information as to the methods
of cultivating the plants, cereals, and
of other products adapted to particular
localities. Quietly, but surely, the
Agricultural Bureau is working a
great material good, and if liberally
supported, the more widely its influence
will be extended, and the less dependent
we shall be npon the products of foreign
countries. The subject of compensa
tions to heads of bureaus, and officials
holding positions of responsihilitv and
requiring ability and character to fill
properly, is one to which your attention
is invited. But few of these officials
receive a compensation equal to
the respectable support of a family,
while their duties areeuch as to involve
millions of interest, in private life,
services demand compensation equal to
the services rendered; a wise economy
would dictate the same rule in the
Government service. I have not given
the estimates for the support of the
Government for the ensuing year nor
comparative estimates between expen
ditures for the year just passed and the
one just preceeding. because the figures
are contained in the accompanying re
ports or in those presented to Congress
These estimates have my approval.
REMOVAL OF POLITICAL DISABILITIES.
More than six years have elapsed
since the last hostile gun was fired
between the armies then arrayed
against each other, one for the perpe
tuatioo, the other for the destruction of
the Union. It may well be considered
whether it is not now time that the dis- 1
abilities imposed by the Fourteenth
Amendment should be removed. The
amendment does not exclude from the
ballot, but only imposes the disability
to hold offices of certain classes. Where
the purity of the ballot box is secure,
the majority are sure to elect officers
reflecting the views of the majority. I
j do not see the advantage or propriety
i of excluding men from office merely
because they were before the rebellion j
j of standing and character sufficient to
be elected to positions requiring
them to take an oath to support j
the Constitution, and admitting to :
eligibility those entertaining pre
cisely the same views but of leas
standing in their communities. It may
be said that the former violated an oath
while the latter did not have if in their
power to do so. If they had taken this
oath it cannot be doubted they
would have broken it as did the former
class of them. Are any great criminals
distingniahed above all other* for the
part they took in opposition to the
Government? They might, in the
? ?
judgment of Congress, be excluded from
such an amnesty. The condi
tion of the South is not each as
all patriotic citizens could desire.
It will be a happy condition of the
country when the old citizens of these
States will take an interest in pnblio
affairs, promulgate their views honest
ly vote for men to represent
their views, and permit the same
freedom of expression and the ballot to
those entertaining different political
convictions.
TH* TERRITORY OF COLUMBIA.
Under the provisions of an act ap
proved February 21, 1871, a territorial
government was organized in the Dis
trict of Columbia. Its results have
thus far fully realized the expectations
ot its advocates. Under direction of
territorial officers a system of improve
ment has been inaugurated by means of
which Washington is rapidly becoming
a city worthy of the Nation's Capital.
The citizens of the District have volun
tarily taxed themselves to a large
amount for the purpose of contributing
to the advancement of the seat of gov
ernment. I recommend a liberal appro
priation from Congress in order that the
Government may pay its just share of
the expen?esof carrying out a judicious
system of improvement.

not now state as fully as I desire the
nature of the complaints made by immi
grants of the treatment they receive,
but will endeavor to do so during the
session of Congress, particularly if the
subject should receive your attention.
HONESTY AND EFFICIENCY.
It has been the aim of the adminis
tration to enforce honesty and efficiency
in all public Offices, and every public
servant who has violated the trust
placed in him has been proceeded
against with all the rigor of the law
If bad men have secured places it has
been the fault, of the system estab
lihed by law, and the custom of making
appointments; the fault of those who
recommend for government positions
persons not sufficiently well known to
ibem personally, or who give 'et^frs
endorsing the characters of office
seekers, without a proper senee of the
grave responsibility which such a
course devolves upon them. Cml
service reform, which can correct these
abuses, is much desired. In mercantile
pursuits, the business man who gives a
letter of recommendation to a friend to
enable him to obtain credit from a
stranger, is regarded as morally respon
sible for the integrity of his friend, and
his ability to meet bis obligation. A
reformation which could enforce this
principle against all indorsers of per
sons for public place would insure
great caution in making recommenda
tions. A salutary lesson has been
taught the careless and the dishonest
servants in the great number of prose
cutions and convictions of the last two.
years. It is gratifying to notice the
favorable change which is taking place
throughout the couutry in bringing to
punishment those who have proved
recreant to the trusts confided to
them, and in elevating to public
office none but those who possess
the confidence of the hontst and virtu
ouh who, it will always be found, com
prise the majority of the community in
which they live. In my message to
Congress one year ago I urgently rec
ommended reform in the civil service
of the country. In conformity with
that recommendation Congress, in the
ninth section of ?n act making appro
priations for sundry civil expenses of
the government, and for other purposes,
approved March 3, 18 1 1, the nec
essary authority to the Executive to
inaugurate civil lervice reform and
placed upon him the responsibility of
doing so. Under the authority of said
law, I convened a board of gentlemen
eminently qualified lor the work, to de
vise rules and regulations to effect the
needed reform. Their labow are not
vet completed, but it It believed that
they will succeed in devising a plan
which can be adopted, to the great relief
of the Executive, the Heads of Depart
ments and the members of Congress,
and which will redound to the true
interests of the public service. At all
events, the experiment shall have a
lair trial
CONCLUSION.
I have thus hastily summed up the
operations of tbeGovernmentduringthe
last year and mad# such suggestions as
occur to me to be proper for your con
sideration. 1 submit them with a con
fidence that your combined actions will
be wise, statesmanlike, and for tbe best
interests of tbe whole country.

I A Tribune special dated Washington,
December 3, says: Senator Sumner
intends to introduce to-morrow a new
bill to fairly return to specie payment.
His plan is to issue every month ten
millions of interest bearing legal tender
notes, similar to those issued in 1863
and 1864, and to canoel a like amouut
of greenbacks, the process to go on till
all the greenbacks have been thus re
placed. The new notes he proposes
shall bear fire per cent interest, and
shall be paid in coin at the end of three
years, or converted into fire per cent
bonds. By this means Mr. Sumner I
thinks resumption could be reached
without a shock to business, or serious
disturbance of prices. Mr. Sumner's
plan has the approval of many eminent
financiers, bankers and baainess men in
New England.
It was the intention of the Southern
Claims Commission to resume their
sessions about the latter part of this I
month, shortly after submitting their '
report to Congress, but owing to the
mass of testimony unwritten from the
short-hand notes, the evidence cannot be
got in shape up to the time of the pro
posed meeting in December, consequent I
1 y the recess of the Commission will be
prolonged until about the middle of
January, 1872. I
Troubles mt Hmrmmm? The Murdered
Itidenta.
Havana letters of the 28th give the
details of the troubles there and execu
tion of the eight students, showing that
the only desecration to the grave of
Castanon consisted in breaking the
glass cases covering the niche of the
tomb, and substituting wreaths of garlic
instead of immortelles. At the court
martial the Chaplain stated that it was
only a student's frolic, and did not de
serve such severe sentences, but the
clamors of the volunteers overruled
everything else, andeight were condemn
ed to death, eleven sentenced to six years
in the chain gang, nineteen to four
years in the same gang, four to
six months' imprisonment, and two
were liberated. The sentences were
immediately executed, those murdered
not being allowed an hour's respite to
see their friends. Volunteers raided
through the streets all day, shooting
eight Cubans. Business was entirely
suspended, and quiet was only partially
restored after the execution. The
students were all quite young men ?
boys ? but met their deaths bravely in
the presence of immense throngs. Their
parents offered large sums of money to
save them ? the father, of one offering
one million dollars; but all were vain
The Captain General, Valmaseda, was
absent at the time, but fully sanctioned
the murders on his return. The au
thorities appear perfectly impotent in
the presence of the Volunteers.
Locomotive Boiler Explosion.

another freight car, yesterday, on the
Erie track, near Rutnerford Park, all
being smashed. Loss heavy.

A FAST OE5T COME TO GKIEF.
Arreat of a Potlofflec Clerk for Rob.

at (bo Bottom of It.
A dispatch from Louisville, oj the
1st, says :
This morning T. W. Lindrum. a night
clerk in the Louisville Postoffice, was
arrested for robbing the mails in the
office. Eleven letters were found on
his person. The robberies have been
f;oing on for some time. Lindrum
eading a fast life, keeping a m stress,
horse, <tc , and sporting valuable dia
monds. on one thousand dollars a year,
led to his being suspected. Watch was
set for him, and this morning he was
seen taking letters from the distributing
department. The policeman recovered
the letters. Lindrum was lodged in
jail and will be examined before the
United States Commissioner to morrow.
He has several tboasmd dollar* in the
bank, which of coarse is a part of the
proceeds of the robbery. Ue is a son
of J. R. Lindrum, formerly city clerk
of Covington, Kentucky. The affair
excites much attention, and Postmistress
Porter is much distressed over it. Sbe
pat the young man in his nlace from
friendship for bis family, who are per
sonal friends. Lindrum was not much
affected. It is supposed that be relies
on influence from Covington to secure
bis pardon. He has been in the place
about two years. When the policeman
tapped him on the shoulder, remarking,
" r want you," Lindrum at once replied, j
"I know what you want," nod surren

including a cross valued at over f 1000,

that the robberies extend over a year,

two or three months. Lindrnsa claims
