DAILY ABXxQS.
Tuesday Evening- Dec. J.
The oonBolation the country will experi
ence, Bays the Boston Fost, from the digni
fied and amicable tone of the president
message will be somewhat disturbed by the
evident purpose of Mr. Sumner and Mr. Wil
son to present all the obstacles in their pow
er to ofler against a restoration of that union
of kind feelings and action in the discharge of
political duties which the national executive
is laboring so sincerely to inaugurate. Mr.
Sumner seems to hare taxed his imagination
in multiplying acquirements which grant
nothing to the justice and fidelity of southern
citizens; but which would impose upon them
a humiliating subserviency to an arrogant
assumption of superiority in all that distin
guishes civilization from barbarism. Mr
Wilson is anxious not to be outstripped in dic
tatorial presumption, and follows the steps of
his taller colleague in bristling opposition to
the president's policy of restoration. This
determination to prolong intestine strife and
to delay the healing of its wounds to the lat
hour merely to gratify personal animosity
or to subserve party interest we cannot be
lieve will escape the jnst rebuke and indig
nation such treachery to the public welfare
merits. The president thinks the adoption
of the amendment of the constitution abolish
ing slavery everywhere under the govern
ment of toe United States is sufficient secur
ity to allow all the states representation on
the floor of congress. He would protect
"state governments in all their constitutional
rights, the general government in its whole
constitutional vigor." But Messrs Sumner,
Wilson fe Co. have a longing for arbitrary
power and summary punishment, and so long
as they can be judges and executioners enjoy
their positions hugely and strive to retain
them; but should they find themselves upon
an equality with those they would tetter
the limbs of both parties free the contest
would be quite a different affair ; this is what
they fear and seek to avoid.
The President's Message.
The first official communication made bv Pres
ident Johnson to congress and the country in a
concis?, plan and intelligent exposition of the af
fairs of the nation. It is practical in it charac
ter to an admirable degree, and breathes no
word that falters from the firmest and most en
larged patriotism.
In reference to the propagandist!! of republi
canism, the president funks it no part of our
policy. lie would have us do what Washington
sought to impress upon his countrymen pre
serve our system of government tor a Dieting to
ourselves and an example to be imitated by t!ic
world. But if the monarchies of Europe insist
on challenging republicanism to a triil on tlii-t
continent, he does not believe the peopla of thU
country will hesitate to meet the issue.
The stability of the government i as-nred by
every token. The president's recit?! of these
proofs is as eloquent as timely. Rut all rests
with the people, from whom it springs. And he
solemnly invokes their aid in making perpetual
a system within which are contained the hopes
of freedom for the human race. And he asks all
men to join in the prayer he puts up, that ''we ot
this day miy be able to transmit our gont in
heritance, of state governments in ail their rights
and of the general government in its who!e con
stitutional vigor, to our posterity, and they to
their through countless generation."
The whole document is so truly patriotic, jnst,
libearl, sensible, that its sentiments mast receive
a hearty response from the American people.
Boston Post.
The Message of President Johnson is ta model
document. Its quiet, calm and nninipassioiied
discussion of the great question of the day is
worthy of the highest commendation. It evin
ces no distrust of the people cither north or
south, and taking for granted that all must now
be desirous of restoring peace an t prosftcritv to
the land, is full of strength for the present and
hope for the future.
If congress comes to the consideration of the
great question with the same intelligent apprecia
tion of duty and patriotic devotion which is man
ifested by the president, it will be but a short
time before liberty and peace, prosreritv sr.d
happiness will be re-established throughout the
United States on firmer foundation than ever he
fore. lioxUm Courier.
A more important state paper has not tioe;i
published since the war began. It is high-toned,
conservative and truly statesmanlike. It w ill
displease the radicals and rejoice the conserva
tive men of all parties.
The president maintains his reconstruct inn
policy, leaves the question of negro suffrage with
the states, and argues most ably in support of
state rights under the constitution. Suite
lierjisttr.
One side the democrats and conservative re
publicans come up to the work boldly, mid
frankly give3 Mr. Johnson's message an approval
so plain that "he who ruus may read," while the
other side the radicals either attack it cut
right, endorse 3t with a great many "ifs" and
"buts," or pass it by with a two column editorial
in which they use many words to fill up space,
and cover up ideas, and entirely fail to let their
readers know whether they approve or condemn
the document, while a few with cheeks of brass
and hearts of deception, pervert its meaning in
such a manner as to enable them to give it "a
hearty endorsement." Peoria National Detno
eral. The democratic press generally endorse
the message heartily , and but for the loaves
and fishes, doubtless the entire abolition
crew would in thirty days be worse in their
denunciation of Andrew Johnson and his ad
ministration than were the Whigs of 1840 of
John Tyler.

TOE DEPARTMENT REPORTS.
The Interior.
The secretary of the interior, in hie report
presented at the opening of congress, states
that during the year ending June 30, 1865,
public lands were disposed of as follows:
Acres sold for cask 557,312.53
Acres located with military warrant.. 343,660.00
Acrea located with agricultural scrip. 460,130.27
Acrea selected under agricultural col
lege grant 603,368.11
Acrea given to the atates aa swamp
land 571,429.24
Acrea given to the atatea for rail
road 607,415.30
Acrea taken under the homestead law 1,160,534.92
4,513,738.46
The receipts from cash, sales amounted to
$748,427 25. On September 30, 132,285,035
acres of surveyed public lands remained un
disposed of.
The attention of congress i again invited
to the subject of organizing a bureau of min
ing. All lands denominated mineral should
be brought into market and placed under the
guardianship v( private owners. Congress
has u t legislated with a view to securing an
income from the product of precious metals
trom pubiio domain. It is estimated that
two r three hundred thousand men are en
gaged in mining operations on the pubiio
lands without authority of law, who pay
nothing to the government for privilege or for
lite permaueni possession ot property worth,
in many instances, millions to tbe claimant.
l'ENSIO-NS.
Tbe act of Feb. 27, 1S65, made an annual
allowance of three hundred dollars for life to
each of fivo sorvivors of the army of the rev
olution. Fi-ur of ttiese aged aud venerable

During the fiscal year endiug June 30,1865,
the names ot fourteen thousand nine bunlred
and aixty-two army invalid pensioners were,
on original application, added to the roll, and

Tho number of navy ioviUid pent-ion al

fiscal year whs two hundred and fifty, and
there were seven navy invalids whofe pen
sions were increased. Two hundred and y.ix-tv-six
navy renames were awarded to widow
or other uepenient relatives of deceased of
ficers, seamen or mariners. The acgregnte
amount pitid to naval pensioners of uii classes

Th! navy pension found, which had accu
mulated under the Ret of April 22, 1800, was
exhustrd niiiny ycart since : and congrer-s,
b? tl act 0f July, 17, 1SG2, dcclarod that all
money accruing, r which had already ac
crued, to the United State from the sale of
prizes should b, and remain forever, a fund
for the payment of pensions to the officers,
seamen, and marines, who might be entitled
to receive the tame. If the fund should le
inr nfficient for this purpose, the public faith
was thereby pledged to make up the deticien-
X; if it ehouli b more than sufficient, the
rplus was to be applied for the making cl
further provision for the comfort of tbe of
ficers, eamen, and marines. Tbe amount of
this fund invested in gold bearing, registered
bonds of the United States is nine million
dollars, and there is subject to investment a
further sum of $1,305,114 21. The interest
of this fond exceeds by 100 per cent, tbe
amount required for the payment of naval
pensions authorixed by existing laws.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
The number of Indians residing within tbe
jurisdiction of the United States does not
probably exceed 350.000, a large majority of
whom maintained (luring the past year peace
ful relations. Those tribes whe entered into
an alliance with the rebel authorities and
made war upon the United States have been
vitited with the severest retribution, and re
duced to euch poverty that thousands of
them must inevitably perish during tbe pres
ent winter, unless timely provision be made
by this government for their relief.
Tbe secretary admits great difficulty in
maintaining peaceful relations with the Indi
ana in Minnesota. The terrible massacre of
the whites in 1862 greatly exasperated tbe
people of that state, and the total destruction
of the Indians is advocated by gentlemen of
intelligence and high position. To sanction
such a policy would be to forfeit the respeot
of tbe civilized nations of tbe earth, and it is
recommended that stringent legislation be
adopted to protect the persons and property
of Indian trifce at peaoe with the govern
ment. FATIMTfc.
Poxing the year ending September SO,
1865, there were received at the patent offioe
eleven thousand eight hundred and sixty
applications for patents, and seventy appli
cations for an. extension of patents. Six
thousand two hundred and ninety-two patents
(including reissues and designs) were is
sued, and sixty-one extensions granted. One
thousand five hundred and thirty-eight cav
eata were filed. Seven hundred and forty
one applications allowed, but no patents is
sued thereon by reason of tbe non-payment
of the final fee.
On the first day of October, 1864, there
was a balance to tbe credit of the fund of
$37,117 20. Tbe fees received for the suc
ceeding twelve months amounted to 310,
987,27. The expenditures during the same
period were $262,445,47. Leaving a balance
on the 1st day of October, 1865, of $110,
659 10.
The commissioner of patents is slothed
with unrestrained discretionary power in all
eases of application for the extension of pat
ents. Ilia decision, whether favorable or
unfavorable, is final, and frequently involves
private ana pubiio interests of enormous
value. It is submitted for the consideration
ot congress whether it is wise to lodge so
larie a power with a subordinate officer,
without subjecting its exercise to tbe super
visory control of the bead of the department.
CENSUS.
During the year the work on the census of
18G0 has been rapidly pushed forward. One
volume on"I'opulation"was issued in March,
1864 ; a second on ''Agriculture" in March,
1865 ; the third, entitled "Manufactures" has
just been completed and printed, and the
fourth and last volume, embracing mortuary,
educational and miscellaneous statistics is in
the hands ot tbe printer.
TDK PTCtriC RAILROAD.
The secretary presents statements from the
officers of the Union Pacific Railroad Compa
uy, showing how far the work has progressed
on the various nections of that road. Sixteen
miles of traok have been laid west of Omaha
and arrangements made to prosecuto the
work at the rate ot & half a mile per day. No
doubt 18 entertained that the first one hun
dred miles will be in operation by July next.
On the eastern division, or Kansas l.raucb,
forty mile have been completed from the
mouth of the Kansas Hiver to a point near
Lawrence. On the Atchison branch the
bridges and masonry on the first twenty
mile are completed, and forty miles of track
will be laid by May. The Central Pacific
Railroad Oonipsny of California reports forty
three mile of track eastward from Sacra
mento in running order and the grading
completed for twenty miles more.
Tne Northern Paciae Railroad Company,
on the Ilth of December. 1S04, tiled their
acceptance of the provisions ot the act of
congress entitled "An act granting land to
aid in tbe construction ot a railroad aud tele
graph line from Luke Superior to Poget
Sound, on the Paciti.i coast, on the Northern
route ;" and under date of the Gth of March
last Ktihuiitted their map designating the
general direction of iheir road trom a point
on Lake Superior, in tlie etate of Wisconsin,
to a point on Pue; Sound, in Washington
terr.tory. The records of the department do
tot. however, show any further action by the
compauy iu the premises.
TRE CAPITOL.
Th work on the capitol building still
rtritg along, aud the secretary does Lot inti
mate that it will ever be finished. An ap
propriation of S375, 000 will be required to
continue it until June 30, 1807. The library
is being enlarged at an expenditure of sl4i,
001; and the architect recommends extend
ing the centra building and portico to the
line of the porticoes of tae coveing. an i en
larging the capitol grounds.
DISTRICT OF COLl'UlllA.
The remainder of th secretary's report is
devoted to the internal affair id tiie District
d Columbia and the atteution of congress is
cslied to the duty resulting from its power
td'exclusivo legislation of making just and
adequate provifions lor its welfare, and for
the improvement ot streets and squares, the
property t f the United States. The Insane
Hospital and Deaf end Dumb Asylum are
Mated to bo under excellent management and
conducted in b manner to deserve pubiio con
fidence. A strong appeal is made for the
eition of a house of refuge for youthful of
fenders. Comptroller of the Currency,
The comptroller ot the currency
presented his annual report at tbe
opening .of congress. Since tbe report of
iat year, two hundred and eighty three new
banks have been organized, and seven hun
dred and thirty-one state bank converted in
t.i national associations making the total
number organized to November 1st, sixteen
hundred and one ; of which six hundred and
Feventy-nine were new banks, and nine hun
dred and twenty two were conversions from
stte banks.
The first national bank of Columbia, Mo.,
ha voluntarily gone into liquidation, and
the firt-t national bank of Attica, N. Y., has
failed, and a receiver has beeu appointed to
settle up its agairs.
Nearly all the banks organized under state
liws have voluntarily changed into national
associations, and this transformation has
been accomplished without deranging the
business of these institutions or affecting es
sentiallr the amount of bank note circula
tion. No national currency lias been deliv
ered to a reorganized state bank, until its
former circulation had been reduced below
the amount to which its capital as a national
bank would have entitled it under the law
and as many of the banks had a greater am
ount c.f state notes in circulation than they
were entitled to under the national acts, the
result lias been to diminish rather than in
crease tbe volume of bank note circulation.
Tbe amount of national bank notes
in actual rirculatior on the fint
day ot October last, was 3171,321,!)03

This lavorable eihibit of the amount of paper in
actual circulation is owing, in a great degree, to
the accumulation jf cujrency in the hands ot the
banks, in the absence of the great demands ot the
government for currency since the close of the
war.
At tbe same date the banks held $170,045,
89t in exoass o' the reserve which they are
required to hold.
It is believed that the most efficient check
upon the tendency to expansion would be
found in the compulsory redemption of bank
isurs in the great financial and commercial
centres of the country New York, Boston or
Philadelphia. Under such a tyetem many
institutions, established chiefly tor tho isue
ot their own promises, without the expecta
tion of being called upon to redeem them,
uld lind that they had exceeded tho re
quirement ot legitimate business, and ob
tain relief in the abatement of their issues.
The steady reduction of the volume f ir
redeemable ciireucy in preparation for a re
turn to specie payment is regarded a the
best policy to be pursued, and that the first
step should be the conversion of all the inter-est-heariiig
legal tender'note into 5 20 tix
per cent b ind. It is believed that the alight
c jntrac:ion caused bv such c inversion woul 1
bo hardly perceptible. In view of tbe urgpnt
demand that will undoubtedly be made for
an iucreasa of the national bank note circula
tion, mid a a gentle mode of further reduc
ing tho volume of legal tender notes, it is bug
gsHted that the national currency act Ic ho
amended a to allow an increase of the limit
to four millions of dollar, on con litions only,
that all the banks 1e required to redeem their
notes in New York, Boston or PhiiadelpSia ;
and also that an issue of six per cent. .r-'J
bond be authorized to the umourjt that it
j will require to procure the additional circula
tion under the provisions of the aet, wlii.'h
bonds the banks pIkiII purchase at not !es
j than r-ar value and pay lor them in I'nitd
.Suites ieg.U tender iinfc.Rii notts no received
j to be cancelled and destroyed,
i The comptroller is verv emguine of tbe fu
ture of the country, and belieres th it from a
few eource a revenue can lie raised that will
pay the national debt in thirty-two years and
a half. Tho tariff enn be eo aljusted as to
produce one hundred and twenty millions of
dollars ; one hundred million can be raised
on whisky, ma!t liquor m:o' d iiietic wine;
fifteen million on tobucc i; one hundred and
twenty-five million-; -n cotton ; fifteen mil
lions on stair. ps ; irmi licences twenty mil
lions, and from the pre.tiium on the -orplus
of id-l, after pavi:ii interest on bonds, ten
millions, inaVini; four hundred and five mil
lions of dollars, a sum probably niie hundrei
millions in excess of the amount that will be
required under an economical a jminist ration j
of the government. Three-fourths of the
crops of cotton and tobacc are exported :
that proportion, therefore, of the tax on those
articles woui i be paid br foreign countries,
anil to that extent contribute to the liquid.t
ti'in ot the pullii debt and relief of our own
people.
Tho attempt to tax government securities
invested in banks is opposed as a disgraceful
violation of the public faith. These invest
ments were made on the solemn pledge that
the stocks should be free from taxation by or
under state authority, and banks were re
quired to make uch investments as a funda
mental conditt-in of their existence. The ioi
propriety of the prop -ed uxntiou is more ap
parent when it is lrtic in in hid that they
are taxed by the geueral government to a
greater extent than any other corporation or
c lass of biifices.
In addition ! the amendments to the cur
rency act already sta,ed, it is suggested that
a penalty should b- impred upon tho banks
l.ir i-um note with the engraved and prin
ted signature of the officers. The greatest
protection against counterfeiting is found in
the written eignatures of the officers. The
counterfeiter mnt attempt hi imitation thro'
tho same instrumentality on each note; but a
printed signature being once accurately imi
tated, may be reproduced with each revolu
tion of the press.
The removal of the bureau to New York is
recommended as for tbe interest of the gov
ernment, the pubiio and the banks.
If the system of redemption previously rec
ommended be enf-roed, it is further suggest
ed that bank outside of those cities be reliev
ed from tbe obligations to keep on hand a
revenue equal to titteen per cent, of their cir
culation and deposits, a it would bo bard
ship to require them to bt prepareed to re
deem both at homo and at one of the points
indicated and keep up on idle revenue of fif
teen per cent, against contingencies.
The Navy.
The secretary of tte navy begins with a his
tory oi navai operations from the capture of Fort
Usher till tbe termination of the war, but no
tacts ot importance are Hated, not already in the
possession of the public. Immediately alter the
fall of Fort Fisher, measures were taken for the
gradual redaction of the naval forces employed
on the blockade, and the subscqnent successes
ot our arms were followed by a rapid diminntion
of the number of ships, so that there are now iu
commission, at home aud abroad, onlv one hun
dred nd seventeen vessels of all descriptions.
or these, seven are in the European squadron,
under Rear Admiral L. M. Goldsborough ; ten in
the Brazil an 1 African squadron.-under Acting
Rear Admiral S. W. Gordon ; five in the ast
India squadron, under Acting Rear Admiral II
11. Ball ; and eleven in the Pacific squadron, un
der Acting Rear Admiral George F. Pearson.
These squadrons, with another of nine vessels,
soon to be put in operation in the West Indies,
under Commodore James S. Palmer, are consid
ered sufficient for the encouragement and protec
tion of our countrymen engaged in legitimate
commercial pursuits and for upholding our flag
abioad.
Since the 4th of March, 181, 418 veesela have
been purchased for the navy at a cost of $18,
S66.681.83, and of these 840 have been sold, for
which tbe government has received $5,621,800,
87. Five hundred and eight vessels have been
commenced and most of them fitted for service
in the period. A few of the larger ones will re
quire still further time for completion. From
7,600 men in the naval service at the commence
ment of tbe rebellion, the number was increased
to SI, 500 at its close. In addition to these the
aggregate of artizans and laborers employed in
navy yards was 16,880 instead of 4,844 previous
ly in tne pay ot the government.
ine secretary evidently considers tbe enlarge
ment of the navy yards a subject of special im
portance. He eays not one of them presents the
lull requisite conveniences and facilities for
promptly fitting out in an efficient manner, more
than a tingle yessel at a time. Vessels which
ought to be repaired in three month?, are often
detained for a year. There is not a public yard
where an iron vessel cau be constructed, an iron
plate made, or where shafting can le forged, or
r-teniu machinery manufactured, except on a
moderate scale; nor, with the exception of Mare
Island, California, and Norfolk, have we a navy
yard with sufficient room to erect the necessary
works for even present want. England, besides
her great public navy yarns, with which we can 1
bear no comparison, p.ses-ies several private es- '
tabliahruents,in each ef which there are more mechanic-.!
appliances than are possessed by our
whole country. The immediate, indispensable and
truly economical remedy for all this disadvantage
is toeularge the navy yards at Uoston and. New
York, to complete the yard at Mare Island, on
the Pacific, re-build those of Norfolk and Pensa-
cola, and sell the present restricted grounds at
Philadelphia alter establishing a yard of suffi
cient capacity at League Island, or some other
proper location on the Delaware. There are ser
ious objection to the yard at Kittery, as a naval
station, on account of its proximity to the ocean,
but if it Iv to be continued, the proposed ac
quisition of Seavey's Island should be carried in
to effect.
Of the monitor tlas of vessels, the eecretary
says, they stand as the uudoututed and best de
fence of our fhores against any naval armament
in existence. Several light-draft vessels of this
class, drawing .but eight i-et of water, have un
dei taken sea voyages with entire safety, and one
made a voyage from Bostou to Charlston, S. '.,
where she is etationed an. I performs with entire
satisfaction all the duties required of her. The
accompanying report of the thief of ihe liureauof j
Medicine and Surgtry gives some interesting and j
extraordinary facts aid statistic concerning the i
comparative heaitnincrs of iron duds and ood"-n j
vessels, irnm wuicli it appears that there wasUs9
sickness on hoard the monitors thin on the
wooden ships with nn equal number of im-n and
in equally exposed posit ioii8.'

The expediency of appointing oue-haif the mid
shipmen from the ei, li.-ted apprentices, inst-ad
of from congressional distiicw, is also suggest
ed. The law -f congress that ' the hours of la!or
and tbe rate of waes of th- emploveo in the
navy varus shall conform with tt.ose in private
stsblishnx i.ts." is said to be a source of disatis-
t.x'lion at d discontent, and it-- repeI is reeom- '
mended. ( uiier alms- in tt.e y arii have ben j

A strong recommendation is made in favnr of
increasing the psy ot naval officers.
The total expenses of the department fr;r.i
4th of March, 1SH1, to tiic 30th of June. Jm!.".,
were f -J18.17',900,J8 in average annual exjH-n-liiture
of S"2.S'SJ.'.1M,C3. Tlie estimate for t:ie
year t-uding June SO, 167, amount to 23,Ss2,
437,50, which include 5,500.0OO for the erec

In describing the opei ations of tti-i r f,e-En-clish
cruisers Stonewall mid S;:enatitioau. the
secretary says he was informed in an official
communication that the crew of the latter wire
all liiili-ii subject, th:it many of them belongi-d
to the roytl naval reserve, and that ome forty
or fifty ot the Alabama's men were amo:,g
them.
The opinion is expressed that the act of t-n-prcss,
M irch S, lSfii. "to incorporate a nution.il
military and naval asylum," should it ever go in
to r licet will be lik'-ly to operate injuriously to
the naval service. The taste aud puisuits of
the saiiors and soldiet s are .--o !:ssiiriilar that
they cau scarcely be made to harmonize. It is
suj-ncsted that a home be established tor soldiers
exclusively, and that the present grounds and
huiluirgs f the naval accrdemy at Annapolis
could at slight expense be converted to this pnr
pose.
Oil the 1st of November, 1865, the navy pt-i.-sion
roll included 2,027 persons, reeeiving"$24S,
."2'. 50, being nil increase during the je;ir of 4 IS
persons, receiving pensions amounting to $5$,
t70 4U. Attention U called to an unjust discrini
ination against pensioners who have lost both
hands or lect, or both eyes, in the naval service.
The law give increased pension for ouch iriuries
in me mi, iiarr service, out n.is Ix-en construed so
a not to include those in the navy. There are
aiso several grades of navtl officers for which no
provision is made.
The accompanj ing reports of the chief of the
various bureaus presen some interesting details
in audition to the (-encral statements of the sec-r-t
irjs report. The nnmber of seamen enlisted
in the navy from the 4th of March, Ifctfl, to the
1st of May, 1S65, was 118,1144. The chief of the
ordnance bureau reconinn nd a course of expeii
Hu nts with torm-does. ami to establish rornno
operators for future service. The total numhef !
of casualties in the navy during the war was 3,
2201,406 killed, l,Ki wounded, and I7H miss
ing. The reports frotn the war department, iu
cludicg the report of tho secretary of war,
aud also of Lieut, lien, tirant, are, either of
them, about twice the length of the presi
dent message, and too Hug for our columns.
They contain very little of importance which
has not been published in the papers a long
time ago, and of en in much bettor form,
the report of battles and movement uf ar
mies being much better discrihed by news
papers correspondents ; yet the report of
Lieut. Gen. Grant, though It e mtaias nuth
ingbarticularly new, will profiV.Iy receive
as much attention as auy of tbe department
reports, and probably a g iod deal muro than
some of them, and be deemed worthy cf pre
servation as oue ot the roost valuable tecords
of a struggle which will
always occupy a
conspicuous place In American history. The
brief reference made to the war report, by
tbe president, in his message, is sufheent for
for general purposes. It is impossible to
make an abstract cf either of these docu
ments and do justice to them. They must
be read in full to be appreciated.
The paragraph in the president's message
devoted to our relations with Englnad, covers
a very sharp diplomatic lance. Ite reason
able interpretation is, that the presidsnt does
not propose to surrender any of the claims he
has made upon that power.and that the main
tainance cf amicable relations depends upon
the temper in which these shall be met. So
in regard to Mexico. Without assuming an
arrogant tone, Mr. Johnson affirms the Mon
roe doctrine in language which will not be '
