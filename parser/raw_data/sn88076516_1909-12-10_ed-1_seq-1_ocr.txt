ernment of the United States as a con
sulting and advising party this gov
ernment has been almost continuously
called upon by one or another and in
turn by all of the five Central Amer
ican republics to exert itself for the
maintenance of the conventions. Near
ly every complaint has been against
the Zelaya government of Nicaragua!
which has kept Central America in
constant tension or turmoil. The re
sponses made to the representations of
Central American republics as due
from the United States on account of
its relation' to the Washington conven
tions have been at all times conserva
tive and have avoided, so far as possi
ble, any semblance of Interference, al
though It Is very apparent'that the
considerations of geographic proximity
to the canal zone and of the very sub
stantial American interests in Central
America give to the United States a
special position In the apne of these
republics and the Caribbean sea.

Monroe doctrine may be said to have
nearly disappeared, and neither the
doctrine as it exists nor any other doc
trine of American policy ishould be
permitted to operate for th^ perpetua
tion of Irresponsible government, the
escape of just obligations or the insidi
ous allegation of dominating ambitions

My meeting with President Diaz and
the greeting exchanged on both Amer
ican and Mexican soil served. I hope,
to slgnaliize the close and cordial rela

republic and the great republic imme

there is so vast a network of material

I am happy to say that ail but one

for so lbng vexed
eerves" unchanged Its policy of support

tunity and scrupulous respect fop the
Integrity of the Chinese empire, to
which policy are pledged the interest
ed powers of both, east and west
By the treaty of 1903 China has un
dertaken the abolition of likln with a
moderate and proportionate raising of
the customs tariff along with currency
reform. These reforms being a mani
fest advantage to foreign commerce as
well as to the interests of China, this
government is endeavoring to facili
tate these measures and the needful
acquiescence of the treaty powers:
When It appeared that Chinese likln
revenues were to be hypothecated to
foreign bankers in connection with a
great railway project it was obvious
that the governments whose nationals
held thiB loan would have a certain
direct interest In the question of the
carrying out by China of the reforms
In question. The administration deem
ed American ,participation to be of
great national interest Happily, when
It was as a matter of broad policy ar
gent that this opportunity should not
be lost the indispensable instrumental
ity presented itself when a group of
American bankers of international
reputatioh and great resources agreed 000,006, and $1,000,000 to be paid on
at once to share in the loan upon pre
cisely such terms as this government
should approve. The chief of those
terms was that American railway ma
terial should be upon an exact equality
with that of the other nationals join
ing in the loan in the placing of or
ders for this whole railroad system.
After months of negotiation the equal
participation of Americans seems at
last assured.
In one of the Chinese-Japanese con
ventions of. Sept 1 of this year there
was a provision which cansed consid
erable public apprehension in that
apon its face it was believed in some
quarters to seek to establish a monop
oly of mining privileges {pong the
South Manchurian and Antung-Muk
den railroads and thus to exclude
Americans from a wide field of enter
prise, to take part in which they were
by treaty with China entitled. After
a thorough examination of thewonven
tions and of the several contertoal
documents the secretary of,
state reach
"&d thVci6seihSBS||^bhat'iKi^^
oly was ^intended «^.^fl,ccompllsli«d:
This^ government made: Inquiry of the
Imperial Chinese and Japanese gov
ernments and received from each offi
cial assurance that the provision had
no purpose inconsistent with the poli
cy of equallty of opportunity to which
the signatories. In common with the
United States, are pledged.
Our traditional relations with the
Japanese empire continue cordial, as
usual. The arrangement of 1908 for
ft co-operative control of the coming
of laborers to the United States has
proved to work satisfactorily. The
matter of a revision of the existing
treaty between the United States and
Japan which is terminable in 1912 is
already receiving the study of both
countries.

As a consequence of section 2 of the
tariff act of Aug. 5,1909, it becomes the
duty of the secretary of state to con

The Panama Canal.
The policy of paying for the con
struction of the Panama canal not
out of current revenue but by bond
Issue, was adopted in the Spooner act
of 1902, and there seems to be no good
Reason for departing from the princi
ple ijy which a part-at least of the
burden of the cost of the canal shall
fall upon our posterity, who are to
enjoy it, and thefe is all the more rea
son for this view because the actual
cost to date of the canal, which is now
half ,done and which will be completed
Jan. 1, 1915. shows that the cost of
engineering and construction will be
$297,766,000 instead'elf $139,705,200, as
originally estimated,.^ In addition to
er
government aqd the amount paid foi
flie properties, the franchise and the
privilege of building the dual, in
crease the cost by 7B 485,000 to a
total of $875,201,000. The Increase In
the cost of engineering and construc
tion Is due to a substantial enlarge
ment of the plan of construction by
widening the canal 100 feet In the Cu
lebra cut and by increasing the di
mensions of the locks, to the under
estimate of the quantity of the work
to be done under the original plan and
to an underestimate of the cost of la
bor arid materials, both of which have
greatly enhanced In price since the
original estimate was made.

As the degree of efficiency in all the: S
departments is,much lessened by the re

Is indispensable to any proper systemv|

that their separation from the service
shall be easy and inevitable. It is im-

will be in reducing the number of|
