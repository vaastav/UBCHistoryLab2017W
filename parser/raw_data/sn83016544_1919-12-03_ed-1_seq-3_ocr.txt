SENATE PUTS
PEACE PACT
TO ONE. SIDE
Fails to Ratify Treaty After
Lodge Reservations Are
Rejected.
COHGRESS ADJOURNS
Wartime Rule3 Remain in Force When
All Compromise Moves Fail—
Resolution Declaring Peace
Goes Over.
Washington, Nov. 20.—Failing after
three attempts to ratify the peace
treaty, the senate laid it aside, ended
the special session, and went home.
All compromise efforts to bring rati­
fication failed, the three resolutions
of ratification all going down by over­
whelming majorities. The Republican
leaders apparently despairing of bring­
ing two-thirds of the senate together
for any sort of ratification then put in
a resolution to declare the war at an
end.
T,wo of the three ratification votes
were taken on the resolution drafted
by the Republican majority containing
reservations which President Wilson
had told Democratic senators in a let­
ter would mean nullification of the
treaty. On each of the votes most
of the Democratic supporters of the
treaty voted against ratification.
Democrats Gain Few Votes.
The first vote on this resolution
stood 39 for to 55 against. On the
second vote taken after several hours
of parliamentary wrangling in which
the Democrats made vain efforts to
win over some of the Republican group
of mild reservationists, 41 senators
voted in the affirmative and 51 in the
negative.
The third vote was on straight-out
ratification without reservations which
got only 38 votes to 53 opposing it.
Only one Republican, Senator Mc
Cumber, North Dakota, voted with the
Democrats in its support.
Final Decision.
Republican Leader Lodge declared
the voting constituted a final decision
on the peace treaty unless President
Wilson circumvented the senate rules
by withdrawing it and then submit­
ting it again to the senate. In other
quarters there was some difference of
opinion, but the general sentiment
seemed to be that there was only a
slender chance that the treaty would
come up at the beginning of the next
session of congress, beginning next
month.
Action Kills Wets' Hopes.
The effect of the senate's failure to
ratify the treaty will be the continua­
tion of various war-time la,ws and
regulations at least until the new ses­
sion opens. Among these is the war­
time prohibition act.
The resolutions presented to declare
a state of peace will come up at the
beginning of the new session and is
expected to start another stubborn
fight.
House Adjourns.
Washington, Nov. 20.—Six months
to the day after congress convened in
special session, the house formally
adjourned after receiving word from
President Wilson that he did not ob­
ject' to this action.
The adjournment resolution was
adopted by a vote of 55 to 5.
RED CHRISTMAS PLOT BARED
Plan to Slay Officials With Bombs
Is Exposed.
Philadelphia, Nov. 20.—Discovery of
a "Red" plot to slay officials with
explosive Christmas mail packages is
announced by James Robinson, super­
intendent of police.
Information of the plot,' which he
considers reliable, indicates it is na­
tion-wide and directed against federal,
state and city authorities who took
part in the national round-up of radi­
cals planning overthrow of the gov­
ernment.
Immediate steps were taken to pre­
pare federal investigators, postal au­
thorities and police of large cities for
action against the "mail terror" which
is scheduled to begin operation short­
ly before and during the Clyistmas
holidays.
To Withdraw Troops From Russia.
Washington, Nov. 20.—Withdrawal
by the Allies of all troops and ma­
terial support from Russia seem immi­
nent. The revolution at Vladivostok,
has been quelled, dispatches to the.
state department said.
$10,000 in Jewelry Taken.
Chicago, Nov. 20.—Four pieces of
platinum jewelry set with diamonds
and valued at $10,000 were stolen
from a show case in Marshall Field
and company's store here.

ployes of Chicago's leading photog­
raphers went on a strike. They de­

District Court Orders North Da­

Seized Properties.
Says Executive Action Is Confiscation
and Brings Involuntary
Servitude.
Bismarck, N. D., Nov. 20.—Judge W.
L. Nuessle in district cour* here has
issued an injunction directing Adju
that General Fraser and Capt. L. R.
Baird of the state Home Guard to
restore to the Washburn Lignite com­
pany within five days the mining
property at Wilton, N. D„ seized un­
der orders from Governor Frazier.
"It seems to me that it amounts on
one hand to confiscation and on the
other to involuntary servitude," de­
clared Judge Neussle in reviewing the
action of Governor Frazier in taking
over lignite mines in North Dakota
and in enforcing his proclamation by
the use of available military re­
sources.
Opens Way to Possible Appeal.
"I realize that any mandate this
court"^may "Issuer uhlS'ss" the' 'goffehi.:
ment chooses to recognize it, cannot
be carried out without civil war," said
Judge Nuessle. "I do not*want that.
I will make my order for return of
the property to the plaintiffs at some
future date long enough ahead to per­
mit of an appeal to the (state) su­
preme court should defendants elect'
to appeal. I do not know whether the
supreme court will support my views

GIVES STERN WARNING
America "Surprised and Inoensed"
at Retention of Official Which
~lc Branded as Unwarranted
"and Arbitrary.
Washington,—Nov. 21.—Mexico has
been warned by the American govern­
ment that' any further molestation of
William O. Jenkins, the American
consular agent at Puebla, who recent­
ly was kidnaped by bandits, would
"seriously affect the relations be­
tween the United States and Mexico,
for which the government of Mexico
must assume sole responsibility."
Coupled with the warning was a
demand for the immediate release of
the consular agent, who lias been re­
arrested on charges in connection
with his abduction and ransom in the
sum of $150,000 in gold.
Official Announcement.
The note was sent following receipt
at the department of the official con­
firmation of Jenkins' rearrest.
The announcement follows:
"The Department of State has sent
a note to the Mexican Foreign office,
through the American embassy at
Mexico City, calling for the imme­
diate release of William O. Jenkins,
the American consular agent at
Puebla.
"The note, which is based on the
rearrest of Consular Agent Jenkins at
Puebla,^ points out that the United
States government is 'surprised and
incensed' to learn of the reimprison
ment of Jenkins, particularly in view
of the suffering and losses already
sustained by him in connection with
his kidnaping through lack of protec­
tion by authorities and in connection
with his first arrest by Mexican offi­
cials.
"The note expresses the view,
based on the information in the pos­
session of the bepartment of State,
that his rearrest is absolutely arbi­
trary and unwarranted, and warns the
Mexican government that further
molestation of the consular agent will
seriously affect the relations between
the United States and Mexico, for
which the government of Mexico must
assumev sole responsibility."
Jenkins Health Poor,
Jenkins was first arrested early this
month on the charge of collusion with
the bandits who took him from his
home at' Puebla on October 19, but he
was released after remaining in the
penitentiary two hours. He was re­
stricted to his home, ho.wever, and
later was rearrested" on complaint
that he had threatened peons who had
given evidence on which the state
authorities acted in first taking him
into custody.

restrictions.
Washington, Nov. 22. President
Wilson has placed the government
again in control of the nation's food
supply by transferring the authority
of Food Administrator to Attorney
General Palmer.
Revival of the war-time functions
of 'Herbert C. Hoover as food admin­
istrator resulted directly from govern­
ment efforts to avert a famine in
sugar but the powers delegates to
the head of the Department, of Jus­
tice will be used also in an effort to
put down the ever mounting cost of
living.
-Far th.e.. .present the attorney gen­
eral will not put into operation all of
the machinery permitted under the
executive order but, should conditions
demand it, the full pressure of all the
power vested in him will be exerted.
Mr. Palmer's staff will begin imme­
diately to build up a sugar distribut­
ing system which will allocate all
sugar stocks in the country. It will
provide an equitable system of dis­
tributing supplies and will defeat any
concentration or hoarding, officials
said.
12 Cents Wholesale Planned.
Plans tentatively decided on provide
for increasing the price of all sugart
excelling the Louisiana crop, for
which a price of 17 cents already has
been fixed, lo 12 cents a pound whole­
sale., Through this increase new
sources of supply are expected to be
opened. With assurances that a fair
margin of profit, said to be about $1.54
a hundred pounds, .would be allowed,
kugar refiners are ready to enter the
Cuban- markets and purchase all avail­
able stocks, it' was stated. Thub,
officials beiieve, the increase in the
price will avert a shortage which
threatens to become a famine during,
the next 60 days.
Immediate action also is contem­
plated in curtailing the consumption
of sugar by manufacturers whose prod­
ucts are not regarded as essential
food. This will apply particularly to
soft drink deale,rs and candy manu­
facturers.'
