(lulUau't Trial.
Wasiiis oTor, December fi. Guiteau was
brought to the court house a little later
than usual, and the court was not opened
till 11 o'clook. An immense crowd had
gathered on the sidewalk, and when
Guiteau sllghtod from the van
ho showed unusual trepidation

With trembling steps and Minting gait !
nuickly stopped through the angrv crowd.
! ear was depicted on hissiillow countenance
and it was several niinutos after he reached
his room before he regained his usaal com
posure. Kx-Sneaker Randall appeared in
answer to a subpiena, but was at a loss to
know why ho bad been summoned.
Immediately after the opening of
court Soovillc called to the stand Doctor
James Kinnon, of Chicago. Before anv
question could be asked witness, Guiteuu
desired to address the court and without
waiting for permission or dissent on the
part ol tho court, said, in a quick, nervous
tone: "1 want these expert witnesses to
pass on this point: Where a man is
compelled to do an unlawful act.bv a power
which he cannot possibly control or
overrule and nv which his moral
agency is dominated, is he to be consid
ered sutie or insane."
Judge Cox" We will have that question
discussed."
Witness said he was managing editor of
the Chicago Medical Review, and lec
turer on mental diseases at the
Chicago Medical School. He delivered his
first looture last April. AVitncss replied to
a hypothecated question predicated on the
trustworthiness of evidence to which he had
listened, that he had no doubt of the pris
oner's insanity.
Witness admitted that when a man com
niitod a crime while acting under the delu
sion of Divine inspiration, and then con
ducts himself precisely as a
criminal would do, it would
be presumptive evidence against his insan
ity. Quiteau, who had been quietly but
intently following witness, here broke in
rather excitedly saying: "Nothing of the
kind In this case."
Judge Davidgc "Well we will see."
Quiteau (Angrily) "You are going too
fast In this mutter, we want fa-is not your
judgment." .
itness "Here understand one thing
right. The Lord injects inspiration aud
lets the man use his own judgment
to work it, . mid that's Just my case;
that'a tho way I got inspiration.
The Lord don't- employ fools to do his
work. He gets the best material.
Duvidge put a still stronger hypothetical
case, using the term "Like a common, vul
gar criminal."
Ouiteau turned to Davidgo with t lie air
of immense superiority aud suid: "There is
nothing vulgar about this case, aud it is all
high-toned." Laiighti r.quiukly suppressed
uy i lie LUill l.j
Witness thought a-, insane man In carry
ing out inspiration would act accord
ing to the peculiarities of his
manners ami temperament, although
there were types of insanity where a man's
goaerui cnaructer became changed.
Richard J. Hentor, editor of
the Washington Gasette. had
seen the prisoner at the Republican head
quarters in aew lorn and he had
loruieu mo opinion mat. he was
exceedingly illy balanced, a cranky
egotist. Witness was asked what he
thought of prisoner's speech, "Garfield and
Hancock," and replied that in his opinion,
it was a ridiculous, disjointed atiair.
Guiteau, who had smiled complacently
when the witness came upon the stand,
became very much incensed and shouted
out:
"Well. It was not anvthlmr of tho tin.1
You don't know what you are talking
about. My speech received the endorse
ment ot the best men in the coiintrv."
Witness resumed by saying the prisoner
seemed to be a perfect nuisance about the
rooms, but was interrupted by Guiteau,
who Ntufeil
" You worea nuisance yourself. I'd rather
oc nanged as a man man acquitted as a
fool, and I wou't have any more of this kind
of evidence."
Witness added lie was a laughing stock so
iur nn no i-ouiii see.
Ouiteau became greatly enraged and
turning, to Scovillo shouted: "It you put
any more of these crank fellows on the
stund I'll scare you again. It was a great
piece or impudence on your part to put
Judge Davis on the stand without consult
ing me.
