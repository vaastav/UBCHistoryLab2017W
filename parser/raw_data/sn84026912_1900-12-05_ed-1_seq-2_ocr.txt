Duchess county, N. Y.,says: "Chamber
lain's Cough Ito m cd y is tho best medi
cine I have over used, lt is a line chil
dren's romedy for croup and never fails

vent tho attack. This should be borne
in mind and a bottle of the Cough Rem
edy kept at hand ready tor instant usc
a-s soon as these symptoms appear. For

Terriblo Accident in San Francisco.
A dispatch from San Francisco, Cal.,
under dato of November 30th, says: Not
in tho history of thia city has an acci
dent happened approaching in horrible
details that of yesterday when more
than 100 men and boys, who were view
ing tho Stanford-California foot, ball
gamo from the roof of an adjoining glass
manufactoiy, wore suddenly precipi
tated into tho interior of tho building,
many on top of the white hot furnaces.
Tho ventilator annex to the roof, on
which they were perched, collapsed un
der tho strain and without winning l l
porsons wero hurled i , their death.
Tho injured now being cared for in hos
pitals or at their bom is number 83, and
of these several cannot survive
Nearly all of the fatalities were caused
by tho force of the fall. In only a few
cases was contact with tho furnaces thc
immediate cause of death; for ready
hands quickly dragged into the open air
those who were in danger of being
burned alive.
Charles Vost, oven man Of the glass
works, was raking tho lire when the
crash carno and narrow ly escaped hoing
Htruck by the falling bodies. Ile says
that those killed either struck the heavy
bands that surrounded the glas, oven or
wero crushed by those who fell on top
of them.
Many succeeded in staving their dc
scout for a moment by clutching the
broken Imams, bul Indore they could be
reached they were obliged to colease
their hold and drop to tho lloor, !.*> feet
below.
Claronc? Joter, a furnace tender, pulled
eight persons oil" the top of tho retort,
wbero the heat w as about 500 degrees.
Tho oil rotorts were full and the lire did
not go down until they were emptied.
Some of the men and boys wore terri
bly burned. They were drawn aw ty
from tho rotorts witli long iron pokers
used in testing the glass.
While aiding In removing the dead
and wounded T. J. Paiker, a fireman,
found his own son among those injured.
Tho lad probably w ill die.
Tho managers of the glass works
stated that it was impossible for them to
koop the people oil Huir buildings.
They disclaim all responsibility for thc
Accident, lt is estimated that over ??0
porsons woroon tho ventilator when il
Collapsed for it? entire length of KM)foot.
Some wore thrown to tho main roof of
tho building and escaped unhurt, but of
thone who fell to the furnaces nearly all
were either killed or seriously maimed,
SKETCH OF MRS. PICKRFLL'S UFE.
She Carno to this Stato In 1819 and Died
November 30, 1900.
Iiioyles, Anderson County, December
I.-Mrs. Mary 13. riokroll died at 3
o'clock on Friday afternoon at the homo
of her daughter, Mrs. Kate Norris, at
Broyloa, lu Anderson county. She was
tho widow of tho lato Jonathan Piokroll,
Esq., who diod live years ago nt tho ago
of 07, aud horsolf laokod till tho 10th of
February of eomplotlng hor ninety
fourth year. Sho had huon sick but a
short time and her death was duo sololy
to tho indi inities of extreme ago. Sho
suffered but llttlo and passed away with
out a groan or a struggle Notwith
standing tho groat weight of years her
strength of mind and body was remarka
bly well preserved, and tho Uro of hor
religious experience burned brightly to
tho omi. Only a fow days boforo hor
death sho caught the hand of hor daugh
ter, who was ministering to hor, and
pressing it warmly exclaimed with rnp
turo, "as Booing him who is iuvisiblo,"
"Glory bo to God; praise His holy
name!"
.Sho had boon a mombcr of tho Metho
dist church sovonty-llvo years, probably
longer, and during that long timo-a
much longer timo than is allowed most
peoplo to sorvo in tho church militant
sho was uniformly loyal to tho church
of her fathers, constantly exemplifying
tho soundness and saving powor 'Von
doWU to old ago" of tho religion of tho
Lord Jesus Christ.
Mrs. Piokroll was born on Nantuckot
Island, oil' tho coast of Massaohusotts,
' and was tho daughter of Abraham Cof
fin, alho a nativo of Nantucket, and ono
of tho first persons of tho island to on
braco Mothodisni whon tho old religion
1 with a now and consuming zeal swopt
tho dead ecclesiasticism of Now Eng
land as a prarie Uro. Her mothor's
father, William Buukor, a Baptist, was
caught by tho tide of Methodism, as lier
father's poople who woro Presbyterians,
had been, and bo gavo tho land upon
which tho first Methodist church on
Nantucket was built.
When she was sumo ton years of age
sho board tho celebrated ovangolist, Lo
renzo Dow, preach in Providonco,
Rhode Island, whore her father was liv
ing at the time, and to her dying day
she kept fresh in mind hor impressions
of tho man and bis manner. Thc preach
er was unwell and after tho sorvieo in
tho Court House-thoro was then no
Methodist church in tho city-decided
to rest Ibero till tho evening appoint
ment. During tho interval a lady, sym
pathizing with tho evangelist In Iiis in
disposition, brought bim Bomo refresh
ments and subsequently becamo Iii?
wife.
During tho year lSlO Mr. Collin, Mrs.
Piekrell's father, a man possessed of a
wide range of practical knowledge, de
cided, in view of the wide spread busi
ness gloom that hung over tho F.astorn
States as a result of tho war of 1S12, t'.?
remove to South Carolina. His resolu
tion to come South was largely determ
ined by tho insistence of his friend,
Philip Weaver, who had already como to
South Carolina and established a lillie
cotton mill in Spai tanbiirg county.
Accordingly, Mr. Collin sailed with
his family from Providence that year
and reached Charleston after a stormy
voyage of tinco weeks. They wero mot
in Charleston by Mr. Weaver's wagons
uni' conveyed to the little mill up in
Spart.inburg, and thus Mrs. Piokroll
became an operativo in tho first ootton
mill established in South Carolina.
A few years later Mr. Collin removed
toa similar mill on Keedy Hiver, a few
miles below Grconvillo, and from there
he went about the year 182(1 to tho Fork
section of this country to tako a half
interest in a small yaru mill which the
Kev. Levi Garrison, father of the late
Henry Oarrison of this county, had
established on Llttlo Boavordani creek,
one-fourth of a milo below what is now
known as Broyles' Mill.
lt was hero that Mrs. Piokroll was
married January 1">, 1828, tho Hov. Mr.
Garrison pei forming the ceremony. Sbo
was the mother of thirteen children, ton
of whom grew to maturity. Ono of ber
sons, a promising young man, was killed
in battle at Lookout Mountain, Tennes
see, as a member of the Second South
Carolina Hilles, during tho Civil war.
Four of her children, Mrs. Kate Norris
and Mrs. Fd row Cromer of tho Fork;
Mrs. John C. Gantt, of Hartwell, Geor
gia, and Mr. William B. Piokroll, of
Texas, survivo ber. Tho Hov. Henry
Bascom Brow no, a prominent mombor
of the South Carolina Conference, and
Dr. Walker CL Browne, of Atlanta, Geor
gia, distinguished in the profession of
dental surgery, are ber nephews.
Mrs. Piokroll s body was interred yes
terday beside that of her husband at
Smith Chaped in the Fork, in which
church she has held an unbroken mom
horship fora period of seventy-five years,
the like being probably without a par
allel in tho State.
Among thc tens of thousands whohavo
used Chamberlain's Cough liomcdy for
colds and la grippe, during tho past fow
years, to our knowledge, not a single
case has resulted in pneumonia. Thus.
Whitfield A- Co., 2-10 Wabash avenue,
Chicago, one of the most prominent re
tail drug (inns in that, city, in speaking
of this, say: "Wo recommend Chamber

many eases, as it not only gives prompt
and complote r?covory, but also counter
acts any tendency of la grippe to result
in pneumonia." For sale by J. W. Boll.

CLEMSON COLLEGE DISBANDS.
The Students Go Homo on Account of thc
Appearance of Scarlet Fover.
Tho Clemson Collogo students all loft
for their homos last Monday morning,
tho immediate causo of the disbanding
of tho college being the development of
a case of scarlet fever in tho hospital. ;
Tho young man w ho has tho disease is
Cadet G. I). Levy, of Sumter. It has
been known for two weeks that there
were a number of cases at Newry. The
authorities at Clemson redoubled their
rigid precautions, and it was thought by
establishing a strict quarantine there
would be no danger of getting tho dis
ease there. Dr. Rod f oar tl, tho college
surgeon, watched closely every slight
indisposition and had any young man
who was oven slightly unwell to report
to tho hospital. How Mr. Levy con
tracted the disease is not known. Dr.
Rod foam decided on Sunday that. Mr.
Levy had scarlet fever. Dr. Hanlin, a
prominent physician of Washington, D.
C., who is visiting his father. Col. M. B.
Hardin, concurred in this opinion.
What to do was a serious question. It
was thought to bo a serious matter to
disband; a more serious ono not to. At
most, institutions whoro the student body
is scattered it would not bo necessary to
disband, but where there aro470students
in ono building, tho case is difToront.
Not to disband meant about DOO cases.
To disband meant possibly only one;
probably a dozen. After careful consid
eration of tho matter, the authorities
decided to give tho students leavo of
absence until notified to report for duty.
lt was thought best to suspend immedi
ately because the disease would spread
until it would havo boon necessary to
suspend a little later anyway, when there
would be danger of spreading tho fever
olsowho re.
Tho corps of cadets was assembled in
tho college chapel, and Dr. Hart/.og ex
plained tho existing conditions. Dr.
Redfearn gave advice as lo what should
be done if any ono developed a case.
Since the Christmas holidays aro so near,
not more than two or three weeks' work
wdll be lost. During this vacation the
barracks will bo fumigated and every
means of contagion removed.
Four Children Die of Nctjlccl.
George Griffin and w ife, w hile, wein
tried last, week in Nash county, North
Carolina, for causing the death of Grif
fin's four children by a former marriage.
The. oldest of the four was barely ten.
Griffin and the step mother put tho chil
dren in an out-house sixty foot from
their house and loft them there on one
miserable bed with no attention. They
fell ill w ith dropsy and in June one died.
Tho body lay on tho bed beside the liv
ing children. Ali wero covered with
bedsores and they and tho bed itself
were alive with maggots.
The evidence was so horrible as lo
sicken judge ami jury. If was in evi
dence that the step mother had said she
would move the miserable little dirt-eat
ing devils out into tho out-house and let
them die.
The grand jury bad returned a true
bill for murder, but lt was decided to
try them for manslaughter, as it was
contended for the defense that on ac
count of the poverty of Griffin and his
w ife, the children died as much of dis
ease as of neglect because he could not
furnish t hem w ith medicine. No medi
cine was given and no doctor saw thom.
WIlOll neighbors, who heard of the
altair, went to tim aid of the children
Griffiii made threats of violence and
drove them away. The neighbors, how
ever, took away the body id the first
child who died and buried it after it had
remained some time in bed with (Int liv
ing. At intervals of about ten days the
other children died and the neighbors
had to lake their bodies,
Griffin was given a twelve years' sen
:vo to the penitentiary and his wife
six years. She got the shorter tenn be
cause she was no blood relation to the
children.
Now is the time when croup and lung
tron?les prove rapidly fatal. Tho only
harmless remedy that produces immedi
ate results is Ono Minute Cough Core.
lt is very pleasant to lakeland can bo
relied upon to quickly cure cough :, colds
ami all lung diseases, lt will prevent
consumption. J, W. Boll.
