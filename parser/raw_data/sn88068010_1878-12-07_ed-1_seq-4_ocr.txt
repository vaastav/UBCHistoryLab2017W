reach.
TH TllXOW FEVER.
The enjoyment of health by oar people gen
erally has, however, been Interrupted, during
the past season, by the prevalence ol a fatal
. pestilence, the yellow fever, in some portions
of the Southern States, creating an enter
vency which called for prompt and extraor
dinary measures of relief. The
disease appeared as an epidemic
- at Kew Orleans and at other places
on the Lower Mississippi, soon after mid
summer. It was rapidly spread by fugitives
from the Infected cities and towns, and did
not disappear until early in November. The
States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennes
see have suflered severely. About one hun
dred thousand cases are believed to have oc
curred, of which about twenty thousand, ac
coming to Intelligent estimates,proved fatal.
It la impossible to estimate with any ap
proach to accuracy the loss to the country
occasioned by this epidemic It is to be
reckoned by the hundred millions of dollars.
The suffering and destitution that resulted,
excited the deepest sympathy In all parts of
the Union. Physicians and nurses hastened
from every quarter to the assistance of the
afflicted communities. Voluntary contribu
tions of money and supplies, in every needed
form, were speedily and generously furnish
d. The Government was able to respond In
some measure to the call for help, by provid
ing tents, medicines, and food for the sick
and destitute, the requisite directions for the
purpose being given, in the eonfldent expec
tation that this action of the Executive
would receive the sanction of Congress.
About eighteen hundred tents, and rations of
the value of about twenty-five thousand dol
lars, were sent to cities and towns which ap-
Riled for them, full details of which will be
irniahed to Congress by the proper Depart
ment. The fearful spread of this pestilence has
awakened a very general public sentiment In
favor of national sanitary administration,
which shall not only control quarantine, but
have the sanitary supervision of Internal
commerce in times of epidemics, and hold an
advisory relation to the State and municipal
health authorities, with power to deal with
whatever endangers the public health, and
which the municipal and State authorities
are unable to regulate. The National Quar
antine act, approved April 29, 1878, which was
passed too late In the last session of Congress
to provide the means for carrying it into
practical operation during the past season,
is a step In the direction here Indicated. In
lew of the necessity for the most effective
measures, by quarantine and otherwise, for
the protection of our sea-ports, and the coun
try generally, from this and other epidemics,
it is recommended that Congress give to the
whole subject early and careful considera
tion. Ill CONGHESMOWAl, SLKOTIOX8 IK TH1
SOOTUKBIt STATIC s.
The permanent pacification of the country
by the oomplete protection of all citizens lu
every civil and political right continues to
be ol paramount interest with the great body
of our people. Every stop in this direction is
welcomed with public, approval, and every
interruption of steady and uniform
progress to the desired consum
mation awakens general uneasiness and
wide-spread condemnation. The recent Con
gressional elections have furnished a direct
and trustworthy test of the advance thus far
made In the practical establishment of the
right of suffrage, se tired by the Constitution
to the liberated race in the Southern States.
All disturbing Intlurnens, real or imaginary,
bad been removed from ail of these states.
The three constitutional amendments,
which conferred freedom and equality of civ
il and political rights upon the colored peo
ple of the South, weie adopted by the con
current action of the great body f good citi
ens who maintained the authority of the
Katlonal Government and the Integrity and
perpetuity of the Union at. such a cost of
treasure and life, as a wti-e and necessary
embodiment in the organic law of the ust
results of the war. The people of the former
slave-holding States accepted these results,
and gave, in every practicable form, assur
ances that the thirteenth, fourteenth and fif
teenth amendments, and laws passed In pur
suance thereof, should. In good faith, be en
forced, rigidly and Impartially, in letter and
spirit, to the end that the humblest citizen,
without distinction of race or color, should,
under them, receive full and equal protec
tion in person and property and in political
rights and privileges. By these con
stitutional amendments, the Southern
section of the Union obtained a
large increase of political power In
Congress and in the Electoral College, and
the country Justly expected that elections
would proceed, as to the enfranchised race,
upon the same circumstances of legal and
constitutional freedom and protection which
obtained in all the other Statesot the Union.
The friends of law and order looked forward
to the conduct of these elections, as offering
to the general Judgment of the country an
important opportunity to measure the degree
la which the right of suffrage could be exer
cised by the colored people. and would be re
spected by their fellow-citisens; but a more
general enjoyment of freedom of suffrage by
the colored people, and a more Just and gen
erous protection of that freedom by the com
munities of which they form a part, were
generally anticipated than the record of the
election discloses. In some ol those States in
which the colored people hate been unable
to make their opinions felt in the elections,
the result is mainly dun to Influences not
easily measured or remedied by legal protec
tion ; but in the States of Louisiana and South
Carolina at large, and In some particular con
gressional districts outside of those States,tbe
iv cords of the elections seem to compel the
conclusion that the tights of the colored vot
ers have been overridden, and their partici
pation In the elections not permitted to be
either general or free.
It will be for the Congress, for which these
elections were held, to make such examina
tions Into their conduct as may be appropri
ate to determine the validity of the claims of
members to their seats. In the meanwhile it
becomes the duty of the Executive and Ju
dicial Departments of the Government, each
In its province, to inquire Into and punish
violations of the laws of the United States
which have occurred. I can but repeat what
1 said in this connection in my last message,
that whatever authority rests with me to this
end I shall not hesitate to put forth, and I am
unwilling to forego a renewed appeal to the
legislatures, the courts, the executive au
thorities, and the people of the States where
these wrongs have been perpetrated, to give
their assistance towards bringing to Justice
the offenders and preventing a repetition of
the crimes. Mo means within my power will
be spared to obtain a full and fair investiga
tion of the alleged crimes, and to secure the
conviction and Just punishment of the guilty.
It Is to be observed that the principal ap
propriation made for the Department of Jus
tloe at the last session contained the follow
ing clause: And for defraying the expenses
which may be Incurred In the enforcement of
the act approved February twenty-eighth,
eighteen hundred and seventy-one, entitled
' act to amend an act approved
May thirtieth. eighteen hundred and
seventy, entitled An act to en
force the rights of citizens of the United
States to vote In the several States of the
Union, and for other purposes,' or any acts
amendatory thereof or supplementary there
to." It la the opinion of the Attorney-General
that the expenses of these proceedings will
largely exceed the amount which was thus
provided, and I rely confidently upon Con
gress to make adequate appropriations to en
able the Executive Department to enforce
the laws.
I respect fully urge upon your attention
that the congressional elections, in every
district. In a very Important sense, are Justly
a matter of political Interest and concern
throughout the whole country. Each State,
every political party. Is entitled to the share
of power which is conferred by the legal and
constitutional suffrage. It is the right of
every citizen, possessing the qualifications
Srescribed by law, to cast one nnintimidated
allot, and to have his ballot honestly count
ed. Bo long as the exercise of this power and
the enjoyment of this right are common and
equal, practically as well as formally, sub
mission to the results of the suffrage will be
accorded loyally and cheerfully, and all
the departments of Government will feel the
true vigor of the popular will ttius expressed.
Mo temporary or administrative interests of
Government, however urgent or weighty,
will ever displace the seal of onr people In
defense of the primary rights of citizenship.
They understand that the protection of lib
erty requires the maintenance, in full vigor,
of the manly methods of free speech, tree
press, and free suffrage, and will sustain the
fall authority of Government to enforce the
laws which are framed to preserve these in
estimable rights. The material progress and
welfare of the States depend on the protec
tion afforded to their citizens. There ean be
no peace without such protection, no pros
perity without peace, and the whole country
is deeply Interested In the growth and pros
perity of all its parts.
While the country has not yet reached
complete unity of feeling and reciprocal con
fidence between the communities so lately
and so seriously estranged, I feel an absolute
assurance that the tendencies are in that di
rection, and with increasing force. The pow
er of public opinion will override all political
prejudices, and all sectional or State attach
ments, in demanding that all over our wide
territory the name and character of citizen of
the United States shall mean one and the
same thing, and carry with them unchal
lenged security and respect.
OOB FOSEIOM RELATIONS.
Our relations with other countries continue
peaceful. Our neutrality in contests between
foreign powers has been maintained and re
spected. The Universal Exposition held at Paris
during the past summer has
been attended by large numbers
of onr citizens. The brief period
allowed for the preparation and arrange
ment of the contributions of onr citizens to
this great Exposition was well employed In
energetic ana Judiolous efforts to overcome
this disadvantage. These efforts, led and di
rected by the Commissioner-General, were I
remarkably successful, and the exhibition of .
the products of American Industry was cred- !
liable aud gratifying In scope anil character, i
The reports of the United States Commission-
era, giving its results In detail, will be duly
laid before yon. Our participation In this
international competition, for the favor and
trade of the world may be expected to pro-
auco nseiui ana important results, in pro
moting intercourse, friendship, and com
merce a-1th other nations.
In accordance with the provisions of the
act of February 48, 1873, three commissioners
were appointed to an international con Ter
ence on the subject of adopting a common
ratio between gold and silver, Tor the pur
nose of establishing. Internationally, the use
of bimetallic money, and securing fixity of
relative value between tnose metals.
Invitations were addressed to the various
Governments which had expressed a willing
ness to participate in its deliberations. The
conference neiu its meetings in fans, in Aug
ust last. The report of the commissioners.
herewith submitted, will show its results. No
common ratio between gold and silver
could be agreed upon by the conference.
The general conclusion was reached that it
is necessary to maintain in the world the
monetary functions of silver as well as of
gold, leaving the selection of the use of one
or the other of these two metals, or of both,
to he made by each state.
Congress having appropriated at its last
session the snin of $5,500,0110 to pav the award
ol the Joint Coiumisi. ion at Halifax, if, after
correspondence with the British Govern
ment, on the suhji ct of the conformity of the
award to the n iiulreiiienia of the treaty and
lu the terms of the question thereby sub
mitted to thi Commission, the President shall
deem it his duty to make the payment, com
munications ii-oii these points were address
id to the British Government through the
legation of the United States at l-ondon.
Failing to obtain the concurrence of the Brit
ish Government in the views of this Govern
ment respectingthe awaid, I have deemed it
my duty to tender the sum named, within
the yenr fixed by the treaty, accompanied by
a notice ol the grounds of the pa ment. anil
a protest against any other construction of
the same. The correspondence upon this
subject will be laid before you.
The Spanish Govtrnment has official
ly announced thn termination of the
insurrection in Cuba, and the res
toration of peace throughout that
island. Confident expectation are express
ed ol a revival of trade and prosperity, which
it is earnestly hoped may prove well found
ed. Numerous cla'm- of American citizens
for relief lor injuries or restoration of n op
erty have been aining the incidents of long
continued hostilities. Some of these claims
are in process of adjustment by Spain, and
the others are promised early and careful
consideration.
The treaty made with Italy, In regard to
reciprocal consular privileges, has been du
ly ratified and proclaimed.
No questions of grave Importance have
arisen with any other of the European pow
ers. Tne Japanese Government has been de
sirous of a revision of such parts of Its treaties
with foreign powers as relate to commerce,
anil, it is understood, has addressed to each
ol the treaty powers a request to open nego
tiations with that view. The United States
Government has been Inclined to
regard the matter favorably. What
ever restrictions upon trade with
Japan are found Injurious to that people can
not but affect Injuriously nations holding
commercial Intercourse with tbem. Japan,
after a long period of seclusion, has within
the past few years made rapid strides in the
path of enlightenment and progress, and,
not unreasonably, is looking forward to the
time when her relations with the
nations of Europe and America
shall be assimilated to those
which they hold with each other. A treaty
looking to this end has been made, which
will be submitted tor the consideration of the
Senate.
After an interval of several years, the Chi
nese Government has again sent envoys to
the United States. They have been received,
and a permanent legation is now established
here by thatGovemiuent. It is not doubted
thutthia step will be of advantage to both
nations in promoting friendly relations and
removing causes of ditferen.-e. The treaty
wltn the Samoan Islands, having been duly
ratified and accepted on the part of both
Governments, is now In operation, and a sur
vey and soundings of the harbor of Pago
Pago have been made by a naval vessel of the
United Slates, with a view of its occupation
as a naval station. If found desirable to the
service.
since the resumption of dfplomatlo rela
tions with Mexico, correspondence has been
opened and still continues between the two
Governments upon the various questions
which at one time seemed to endanger their
relations. While no formal agreement has
been reached as to the troubles on the bor
der, much has been done to repress and di
minish them. The effective force of United
States troops on the Rio Grande, by a strict
and faithful compliance with instructions,
has done much to remove the sources of dis-
Jiute, and it is now understood that a like
orce of Mexican troops on the other side of
the liver is also making an energetic move
ment against the marauding Indian tribes.
This Government looks with the greatest
sat i-.f action upon every evidence of strength
In the national authority of Mexico, and up
on eveiy effort put forth to prevent or to
funth Incursions upon our territory. Re
uctant to assume any action or attitude In
the control of these incursions, by military
movements across the bonier, not Impera
tively demanded for the protection of the
lives and property of our own citizens, I
shall take the earliest opportunity, consistent
with tne proper discharge of this plain duty,
to recognise the abilitv of the Mexican Gov
ernment to restrain effectively violations of
our territory. It is pro nosed to hold next
year an International Exhibition In Mexico,
and It is believed that the display of the. ag
iKultural and manufacturing products of
the two nations will tend to better under
standing and increased commercial inter
course between their people.
With Brazil, and the Republics of Central
and South America, some steps nave been
taken toward the development of closer
commercial Intercourse. Diplomatic rela
tions have been resumed with Colombia and
with Bolivia. A boundary question between
the Argentine Kepubllo and 1'irag.iay has
been submitted by those Goveinm-ints for
arbitration to the President of the Ui.ited
States, and I have, after careful examination,
given a derision upon it.
A naval expedition up the Ama
zon and Madeira Kivers has brought
back information valuable both for scientific
ami commercial purposes. A like expedition
is about visiting the coast of Africa and the
Indian Ocean. The reports of diplomatic and
consular officers, in relation to the develop
ment of onr foreign comnxrrce, have tumlsh
ed many farts that Intve proved of publlo in
terest, and bav stimulated to practical ex
ertion too enterprise of our people.
OUR NATIONAL FIN HOES.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
fnrnl-hes a detailed statement of the opera
tions of that Department of the Government,
and ot the condition of the public finances.
The ordinary revenues from all sources for
the fl-cal year ended June .30, 1 878, were JJS7,
764.8;u.;o; the ordlnsrv expenditures tor the
same period, were J .':!, 9d4, ."Kb r leaving a
surplus revenue for the year, of ,7.l,5 ' l.W).
The receipia for the present fiscal year,
ending Jnne SO, 1VT8, actual and estimated,
are as follows: Actual receipts for the first
quarter commencing July 1, lrCS, f73,3-9,7i3.43;
estimated receipts for the reinsitiig three
quarters of the year, Jl'.ll HO.isJ iT; total
receipts for the current fl-CHl year, ac
tual and , est 1 mau d, 3'4.:uu,poi. The
expenditures for the same period aid be, ac
tual and t-stimated, as follows: For the
quarter commencing July 1, l 8, actual ex
leni i ores, J7:I,S44,J"..1 17; and lor the remain
ing three-quarters of the year, the expendi
tures are estimated at l',7M.t2.73 making
the total t xpenoitures, 2lu,lo ,0 u.and leav
ing an esiininted surplus revenue, for the
yenr ending June 30, lt7, of J -'4 4ti,oto.
The total receipts dining the next fiscal
year, ending June 30, 8S), estimated accord
ing to exisi lag laws, will be tH 4,5C0,(i; and
the estimated orotiiarv expenditures, for the
same k-i1oi, wi I lie Jia.M.O.ilS.iJI; leaving a
surplus of a,i;9,V7.34 lor that year.
In the foregoing statements of expendi
tures, actual and estimated, no amount is al
lowed for the sinking-fund provided for by
the act approved February SS, lf.i, which re
quires that one per cent, of the entire debt of
the United states shall be purchased or paid
witl.iu each fiscal year, to be set spart as a
sinking fund. There has been, however, a
substantial comp. lance with the conditions
of the law. By its terms, the public debt
shou 1 1 have been reduced, between 18 1 and
the close of the Inst fiscal year, M8,S-1.8 .4o;
the actual reduction ol the ascertained debt,
in that period, baa been T'JO.Ml.i.W.ril : being
in excess of the reduction riqulied by the
sinking-tund act 9S.1.S3.
The ainniutf the ptibliu debt, less cash
In the liox-urv, November 1, l"7s, was $ ',
OM.SoutHt.ls a r'ediicil n, since the same date
last yeur.ot $ia,l.vi,fil7 3s.
The progress uiatle during the last year. In
relunding the public debt ut lower rales ol
interest, is very gratifying. The amount ot
4 per cent, boutla sold during the present
year prior to NovemLer , 1878,1s $ I0i',v!7lio-i,
and 6 per cent, bonds, cuiiiinouly known as
five-twenties, to an equal amount, huve been,
or will lie, redeemed as cuM mature.
It has been the policy of the Department
to pluce the 4 per cent, bonds within easy
reach of every til izen w ho desires to invest
his savings, whether small or great. In these
securities. The Secretary ol the Tn nsury
recommends that the law be so lnoilit1"d,tbHt
small sums may be invested, and that through
the post-oulcrg, or other aifents of the Gov
ermnetif . l he t rest ot -port unity lnnv he irlven
in all parts ot the country for such invest
ments. The best mode suggested ls.that the Depart
ment be authorized to Issue certificates of de
posit, of the denomination of ten dollars,
bearing Interest at the rate of S.tti per cent,
per annum and convertible at any time with
in one year after their Issue Into the four per
cent, bonds authorized by the Refunding act,
and to be Issued only in exchange ot United
6tatea notes sent to the Treasury by mail
or otherwise. Such a provision of law, sup
ported by suitable regulations, would enable
any person readily, without cost or risk, to
convert his money Into an interest-bearing
security ot the United States, and the money
so received could be applied to the redemp
tion of six per cent, bonds.
The coinage of gold during the last fiscal
year was S.V2,79s,9tu. The coinage of silver
dollars, under the act passed February 28,
178, amounted, on the Sid of November, 1878,
toil!i.M.yo. of which amount 4.4.947 is in
circulation, and the balance, $14,829,601, Is still
in i no possession oi tne Government.
With views unchanged with regard to the
act under which tho coinage of silver pro
ceeds, it has been the purpose of the Secretary
faithfully to execute the law, and to afford a
latr trial to the measure.
In the present financial condition of the
country, 1 am persuaded that the welfare of
legitimate business and industry of every
ueoriuoii wui us ues promoted, iy su
staining from all attempts to make radical
changes In tho existing financial legislation.
I.ct it be understood that during the coming
year the business of the country will be un
disturbed by governmental interference with
the laws affecting it, and we may confidently
expect that the resumption of specie pay
ments, which will take place at the appointed
time, will ho successfully and easily ui-tiii-tnlned,
and that it will ba followed by a
healthful and enduring revival of busluess
prosperity.
Let the healing influence of time, the In
herent energies of our people, and the bound
less resources ot our country t have a fair op
portunity, and relief lroui present dilhcultics
will surely follow.
THB ARMY.
The report of the Secretary of War shows
that the army has been well and economical
ly supplied, that our imall force has been ac
tively employed, and has faithtullv perform
ed all the service required of it. The morale
of the army has Improved, and the number
of desertions has materially decreased dur
ing the year.
Xhe Secretary recommends
1. That a pension lie granted to the widow
of the late Lieutenant Henry II. lienner, 18th
Infantry, who lost his llle by yellow fever
while iu command of the steamer "J. M.
Chumliers," sent with supplies for the relief
of sufferers in the South Horn that disease.
4. The establishment of the annuity scheme
for the benelit of the hclr-t of deceased of
ficers, as suggested by the Paj master Gen
eral. i. The adoption by Congress of a plan for
the publication of the records ol the Wnrof
the Rebellion, now being prepared for that
purpose.
4. The increase of the extra per diem of
soldier-teachers employed in post-schools,
and liberal appropriations for the erection
ot buildings lor schools aud libraries at ti.e
different pouts.
6. The repeal or amendment of the act of
June 18, 1878, forbidding the "use of the Army
as a poeee comitatue, or otherwise, for the pur
pose ot executing the laws, except in such
cases and under such circumstances as may
be expressly authorized by the Constitution
or by act of Congress."
6 The passage of a Joint resolution of Con
gress legalizing the issues of rations, tents,
and medicines which were made for the re
lief of sufferers from yellow-fever.
7. That provision be made for the erection
of a fire-proof building for the preservation
of certain valuable records, now constantly
exposed to destruction by fire.
These recommendations are all commonded
to your favorable consideration.
the itxvr.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
shows that the Navy has Improved during the
last fiscal year, work has been done on
seventy-five vessels, ten of which have been
thoroughly repaired and made ready for sea.
Two others are in rapid progress towards
completion. The total expenditures ol the
year, including the amount appropriated for
tho deficiencies of the previous year, were
f 17,4i .Sfi.Bi. The actual expenses
chargeable to the year, exclusive
of these deficiencies, were $1J.W,14A'J. or
$7(17,19.18 less than those of the previous
year, and $4,!h!-,677.74 less than the expenses,
including the deficiencies. The estimates for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, are $14,
662,33 .45 exceeding tho appropriations of
the present year only fi,9rj.75; which excess
Is occasioned by the demands of the Naval
Academy and the Marine Corps, as explained
In the Secretary's report. The appropria
tions for the present tii-osl year are $1428,
4:11.70, which, in the opinion ot the Secretary,
will he ample lor all the current expenses of
the Department dining the year. The
amount drawn from the Treasury from Jnlv
l.to November 1, 1878, is $4,740A44.14, of which
$70,980.73 has been refunded, leaving as the
expenditure for that period $1,6 ,.Vk) 39, or
$.ViO,899.24 less than the corresponding period
of the lust fiscal year.
POSTAL AFFAIRS.
The report of the Postmaster-General era
braces a detailed statement of the operations
of the Post-office Department. Tne expendi
tures of that Department for the fiscal year
ended June 8n, 187, were $ 4,180-4.4. The
receipts, Including sales of stamps, money
order business, and official stamps,
were $i9,977,MS.. The sum ol
$290,4.18.90, included in the foregoing state
ment of expenditures. Is chargeable to pre
ceding years, so that the actual expenditures
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, are
3. 874,047.4". The amount drawn from the
Treasury on appropriations, in addition to
the revenues ot the Department, was $.107,
662 81. The expenditures for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 188J, are estimated at $.167.71,
900, and the receipts from all sources at ,
St4,0S3.90, leaving a deficiency to he appropri
ated out of the Treasury of $s,9c7 ,876.1(1. The
report calls attention to the tact that the
compensation of postmasters and of railroads
for carrying the mail is regulated by law, and
that the failure of Congress to appropriate
the amounts required for these purposes does
not relieve the Government of responsibility,
bnt necessarily increases the deficiency bills
which Congrtss will be called upon to pass.
In providing for the postal service, the fol
lowing questions are presented: Should
Congress annually appropriate a sum for its
expenses largely in excess ot its revenues, or
should such rates of postage be established
as will make the Department self-sustaining?
Should the pot.tl service be reduced by ex
eluding from t ie malls, matter which does
not pay Its way? Should the numberof post
routes be diminished? Should other methods
be adopted which will Increase the revenues
or diminish the expenses of the postal serv
ice? The International Postal Congress, which
met at Paris May 1, 1878. and continued in
session until June 4 of tne same year, was
composed of delegates from nearly all the
civilized countries of the world. It adopted
a new convention, to take the place of the
treaty concluded at Berne October 9, 1874;
which goes Into effect on the 1st of April, 1879,
between the countries whose delegates have
signed it. It was ratified and approved, by
and with the consent ot the President, Aug
ust It, 1878. A synopsis of this Universal
Postal Convention will be found In the re
port of the Postmaster-General, and the full
text in the appendix thereto. In Its origin
the Postal Union comprised twenty-three
countries and colonies, with a population of
three hundred and fifty millions of people.
On the 1st of April next it will comprise forty-three
countries and colonies, with a popu
lation of more than six hundred and fifty
millions of people, and will soon, by the ac
cession of the few remaining countries and
colonies which maintain organized postal
services, constitute. In fact, as well as in
name, as Its new title Indicates, a Universal
Union, regulating, upon a unllorni basis of
cheap postage-rates, the postal Intercourse
between all civilized nations.
Some embarrassment has arisen out of the
conflict between the customs laws of this
country and the provisions of the Postal
Convention, In regard to the transmission of
foreign booksand newspapers to this country
by mail. It Is hoped that Congress will be
able to devise some means of leconciling the
difficulties which have thus been created, so
as to do Justice to all parties involved.
' THK COURTS.
The business ol the Supreme Court, and of
the courts In many of the circuits, has in
creased to such an extent during the past
years that additional 'egislatlon is impera
tive to relieve and prevent the delay of Jus
tice, and possible oppression to suitors,
which Is thus occasioned. The encumbered
condition of these oeckets is presented anew

OUK IMI1AM TROUBLE.
The annual reports of the Secretary of the
Interior and of the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs, present an elaborate account of tho
present condition of the Indian tribes, and of
that branch of the publlo rervlce which min
isters to their Interests. While the conduct
of the Indians, generally, baa been orderly,
and their relations with their neighbors
friendly and peaceful, two local disturbances
haveoccurred, which were deplorable In their
character, but remaii.ed, happily, confined to
a comparatively small number of Indians.
The discontent among the Bannocks, which
led first to some acts of violence on the part
of some members of the triho and finally to
the outbreak, appears to have been CHin-ed
by an Imflicieucy of lood on the reservation,
and this insufficiency to have been owing to
the inadequacy of the appropriations, made
by Congress, to the wauisof the Indians, at a
time when tho Indians were prevented from
supplying the deficiency by hunting. After
an ariluuus pursuit by the troops ol the Unit
ed States, and several engagements, tho hos
tile Indiana were reduced to subjection, and
the larger part of them surrendered them
selves as pi isoners. In this connection, I du
sire to call attention to the recommendation
made by the secretary ot the Interior, that a
sullic'.ent f und bo placed at the disposal of
the Executive, to be used, with proper ac
countability, at discretion. In sudden emer
gencies of the Indian tei vice.
The other rase of disturbance was that ot a
band of Noithern Cheennes who sinldcnty
lelt their i enervation in the Indian Territory
and martin d rapidly through the states of
Kansas and Nebraska in thudirectionof their
old hunting-grounds, committing murders
and oilier crimes on their way. From
documents accompanying the leport ol the
Secretary of the Interior, it appears that
this disorderly hand was as fully supplied
W illi the necessaries of life as the 4,7- 0 other
Indluns who remained quietly on the reserva
tion, and that the distui bance was caused by
men ut a rest less and mischievous ili-position
among the Indians themselves. Almost the
whole of this band have surrendered to tho
military authorities, unditlsagratiliing fact
that, when some of them had taken refuge in
the ca.li ot the K.-d Cloud Sioux .ill whom
they ban been In friendly relations, the Sioux
held them as prisoners and readily gave them
up to the olllcers ot the United stales, thus
giving new proof of the 1o)u1 spirit which,
alarming rumois to the contrary notwith
standing, they have uniformly showed ever
since the wishes they expressed at the
council of September, 1877. had been com
plied with.
Both the Secretary of the Interior and the
Seoieiaiynt War unite in the recommenda
tion thul provision be made by Congress lor
the organization of a corps ot mounted "In
dian auxiliaries," to be under the control of
the Army, and to be used for the purpose of
keeping the Indians on their reservations
and preventing or repressing disturbance on
their part. I earnestly concur in this recom
mendation. It is believed that the organiza
tion of such a body ot Indian cavalry, re
ceiving a model ato pay from tho
Government, would considerably weaken
the restless element among the Indians, by
withdrawing troui it a number of young men
and giving them congenial employment un
der the Government, it being a matter of ex
Jierience that Indiana In our service almost
without exception are faithful in the per
formance of the duties assigned to them.
Such an organization would materially aid
the Army in the accomplishment ot a task
for which Its numerical strength Is some
times found Insufficient.
But, lille the employment of force for the
prevention or repression ot Indian troubles
is of occasional necessity, and wise prt p.tra
tloii should be made to that end, greater re
liance must lie piuced on humane and civil
izing agencies for the ultimate solution ot
what is called the Indian problem. It may be
very dilllcult. and require much patient e.f
foit, to curb the unruly spirit of tne savage
Indian to the restraints of civilized lib , but
eericnce shows Hint it is not lui jMislblo.
Many ol the tribes which are now quiet anil
orderly and Self-supporting were onoo a
savage as any that at picseut roam over the
plains or in the mountains of the far west,
ami were then considered Inaccessible to
elvUlziag intluenooa. It may be impossible
to raise them fully up to the level of the
white population of the United states; but
we should not forget that they are
the aborigines of the country, and
called the soil their own on which
onr people have grown rich, powerful, and
happy. We owe it to them as a moral duty
to help them in attaining at least that degree
of civilization which thev may be nble to
reach. It Is not only our duty it is also our
Interest to do so. Indians who have become
agriculturists or herdsmen, and feel an in
terest in property, will thencelnrth cease to
be a warlike and disturbing element. It is
also a well authenticated lact that Indians
are apt to be peaceable and quiet when their
children are at school, and I am gratified to
know, from the expressions of Indians them
selves ami from many concurring reports,
that there is a steadily Increasing desire.
i even among Indians belonging to compara
tively wild tribes, to nave their children ed
ucated. I invite attention to the reports of
the Secretary of tke Interior and the Com
missioner of Indian Affairs, touching the ex-
rieriinent recently inaugurated, in taking fllty
ndian children, boys and girls, from differ
ent tribes, to the Htimpton Normal Agricul
tural Institute, in Virginia, where thev are to
receive an elementary English education and
training in agriculture and other usef til work,
to be returned to their tribes, alter the com
pleted course, as interpreters, instructors,
and examples. It is reported that the officer
charged with the selection of those children
might have had thousands of young Indinns
sent with hiin had It been possible to mako
provision for them. I agree with the Secre
tary of the Interior in saying that "there
suit of this interesting experiment, if
favorable, may be destined to become an Im
portant factor in the advancement of civili
zation among the Indians."
The question, whether a change In the con
trol of the Indian service should be made,
was, at thn last session of Congress, referred
to a committee for inquiry anil report. V Ith
out desiring to anticipate that report, I ven
ture to express the hope that, in the decision
of so important a question, the views ex
pressed above may not be lost sight of, and
that the decision, whatever it may ne, will ar
rest further agitation of this subject, such
agitation being apt to produce a disturbing
effect upon the service as well as on the In
dians themselves.
In the enrollment of the bill making appro
priations for sundry civil expenses, at the lost
session of Congress, that portion which pro
vided for the continuation of the Hot Springs
Commission was omitted. As the commis
sion had completed the work of taking testi
mony on the many conflicting claims, the
suspension of their labors, before determin
ing the rights ol claimants, threatened, lor a
time, to embarrass the interests, not only of
the Government, but also of a large number
of the citizens of Hot Springs, who were
waiting for final action on their claims be
fore beginning contemplated Improvements.
In order to prevent serious difficulties, which
were apprehended, and at the solicita
tion of many leading citizens of
Hot Springs, and others interested In
the welfare of the town, the Secretary of the
Interior was authorised to request the lnte
commissioners to take charge oltbe records
of their proceedings, aud to perform such
workaa could properly be done by them un
dre snchcircumstances.to facilitate the future
adjudication of the claims at an early day , and
to preserve the status of the claimants until
their rishts should be finally determined.
The late commissioners compiled with that
request, and report that the testimony, in all
the cases, has been written out, examined,
briefed, and so arranged as to facilitate an
early settlement when authorized by law. It
Is recommended that tho requisite authority
be given at as early a day in tne session as
nossihle. and that a fair compensation be al

FRE9KKVATIOX OF FORESTS.
I invite the attention of Congress to the
recommendations made bv the Secretary of
the Interior with regard to the preservation
oi tne timner on tne puuue lanas oi tne v nis
ed States. The protection of the public prop
erty Is one of the first duties ot the Govern
ment. The Department of the Interior
should, therefere, be enabled by sufficient
appropriations to enforce tne laws in mat
respect. Hut this matter appears still more
important as a question of public economy.
The rapid destruction of our forests
Is an evil fraught with the gravest
consequences, especially in the mountainous
districts, where the rocky slopes, once oenud
ed of their trees, will remain so forever.
There the inltirv. once dona, can not be re
paired. I fully concur with the Secretary of
the Interior In the opinion that, for this rea
son, legislation touching the public timber in
the mountainous States and Territories of
the West, should be especially well conslder-

struction of the forests is not sufficiently
guarded against. BUouid oe stieeuiiy moat

subject appears to me to do a matter oi ut

OUR AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS
From the organization of the Government,
tne importance oi encouraging, Dy an possi
ble means, tho Increase of our agricultural
productions has been acknowledged and
urged upon the attention of Congress and
the Deonle as the surest and readiest means
of increasing our substantial and enduring
prosperity.
The words of Washinnton are as applicable
to-day as when, In his eighth annual message,
he said: "It is not to be doubted that, with
reference either to Individual or national
welfare, agriculture Is of primary import
ance. In proportion as nations advance in
population and other circumstances of ma
turity, this truth becomes more apparent,
and rentiers tho cultivation of the soil more
and more an object of public patronage. In
tltntions for uromotimr It irrow un. sunnort

can it 1st ueuicatea witn greater proprietyr
Among the means which have been employ

greater success than the establishment of

Pecuniary aids, to encourage and assist the
spirit of discovery and improvement, this
species of establishment contributing doub
ly to the increase oi improvement oy stimu
lating to enterprise aud experiment, and by
drawing to a common center the results ev
erywhere of individual skill and observation,
and spreading them thence over the whole
N ation. Experience accordingly bath shown
that they are very cheap instruments of im
mense National benefit."
The great preponderance of the agricultu
ral over any other interest in the United
States, entitles it to all the consideration
claimed for it by Washington. About one
half of the population of the United States la
engaged in agriculture. The value of the ag
ricultural products of the United States, for
the year 1878, is estimated at three thousand
millions of dollars. The exports of agricultu
ral products lor the year 1877, as appears
from the report of the Bureau of Sta
tistics, were live hundred and twenty four
millions of dollars. The great extent of our
country, with Its diversity ot soil and climate,
enables us to produce within our own bor
ders, and by our own labor, not only the neo
essaries but most of the luxuries that are
consumed in civilized countries. Yet, not
withstanding our advantages of soil, climate,
and Intercommunication, it appears, from
the statistical statements in the report of the
Commissioner of Agriculture, that we import
annually from foreign lands many millions
of dollars' worth of agricultural products
which could be raised in our own country.
Numerous questions arise In the practice of
advanced agriculture which can only be an
sweted by experiments, often costly and
sometimes fruitless, which are beyond the
means of private Individuals, and are a Just
proper charge on the whole nation for the
benefit of the nation. It Is good policy, es
pecially In times of depression and uncer
tainty in other business pursuits, with a vast
area of uncultivated, and hence unproductive
territory, wisely opened to homestead settle
ment, to encourage, by every proper and
legitimate means, the occupation and tillage
ol the soli. The efforts of the Department of
Agriculture to stimulate old and in
troduce new agricultual industries,
to Improve the quality and in
crease the quantity of onr products,
to determine the value of old or establish
the Importance of new methods of culture,
are worthy of your careful and favorable
consideration and assistance by such ap
propriations of money and enlargement of
facilities as may seem to be demanded by the
present favorable conditions for the growth
and rapid development of this Important In
terest. The abuse of animals in transit is widely
attracting public attention. A national con
vention of societies specially Interested In
the subject bos recently met at Baltimore,
and tho fact developed, both In regard to
cruelties to animals and the effect of such
cruelties upon the public health, would seem
to demand the careiul consideration of Con
gress, anil the enactment of more efficient
laws for the prevention of these abuses.
KUUCATIONAI. MATTERS.
The report of the Commissioner of the Bu
reau ol hdueatton shows very gratifying pro
gress throughout the country, in all the in
terests committed to the cure of this impor
tant office. The report is especially encour
aging with inspect to the extension of the
ailvantuges of the comnion-school system, in
sections of the country where the general
enjoyment of tho privilege of free schools is
not yet attained.
To education more than to any other agen
cy we are to look, as the resource for the ad
vancement ot tho people, the rtqui-ile
knowledge and appieciaiion of their rights
and responsibilities as citizens, and I
desire to repeat the suggestion contained lu
my former messuge in behalf of the enact
ment of appropriate measures by Congress
for ihe purpose of supplementing, with na
tional aid, the local systems ot educutlon in
the several States.
Adequate accommodations for the great
library, which is overgrowing the capacity of
the rooms now occupied at the I'upitol,
should be provided without further delay.
This Invaluable collection of hooks, manu
scripts, and Illustrative art, has grown to
such proportions, in connection with the
copyright system of the country, as to de
maud the prouipt and careful attention of
Congress to save it from injury In its present
crowded and Insufficient quarters. As this
library is national in its character, and must,
from the nature of the case, increase even
more rapidly in the future than In the past,
it can not be doubted that the people will
sanction any wise expenditure to preserve it
and to enlarge Its usefulness.
The api eal of the Regents of the Smith
sonian Institution for the means to organize,
exhibit and make available tor the publlo
benefit the articles now stored away belong
ing to the National Museum, I heartily rue
ouimend to your lavorable consideration.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
The attention of Congress is again
Invited to the condition of the
rlver-frcnt of the City ot Washington. It is a
matter of vital Importance to the healihof
the residents oi the National Capital,
both leiiiorary and permanent, that the
low lands In tront of the city, now subject to
tidal overflow, should bo reclaimed. In their
present conditiou, these flats obstruct the
drainage of the city, and are a dangerous
source of malarial poison. The reclamation
will Improve the navigation of thn river by
restriotlng and consequently deepening Its
channel; and is ulso of importance, when
consideieil In connection with the extension
ot the public ground and the enlargement of
the pin k, west nntl south of the Washington
Monument. The report of the board of sur
vey, heretofore ordered by net of Congress,
on' the improvement of the harbor of Wash
ington and Georgetown, is respectfully com
inr titled to consideration.
The report of the Commissioner of the Dis
trict of Columbia presents a detailed state
ment of the affairs of the District.
The te'iitive expenditures by the United
States and the District for local pm poses is
contrasted, showing that the expenditures
by the people of the District greatly exceed
those of the General tiovernment The ex
hibit l-t made in connection with estimates
f,ir the requisite repair of the defective pave
ments and sower of the city, which
is a work of immediate uecesslty,
and, in the same connection, a plan is
presented for the permanent funding ot the
outstanding securities ol the District.
The benevolent, reformatory and penal in
st unions of tho District are all entitled to
the favorable attention of Congress. Ihe
Reform School needs additional buildln

HOTS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD.
Weak tea is very useful for clean
ing furniture.
Cool rain-water and soda will re
move machine-grease from washable
fabrics.
Oxalic acid will take iron or ink
stains out of cloths. Wash the cloths
after using it.
Fish may be scaled much easier by
dippin&r into boiling water aDout a
minute.
Ripe tomatoes will remove ink and
other stains from white cloth; also,
from the hands.
A teaspoonful of turpentine boiled
with vour while clothes will aid the
whitening process.
Fresh meat, after beginning to sour,
will sweeten if placed out of doors in the
cool over night.
Kerosene will soften boots or shoes
which have been hardened by water,
and render them as pliable as new.
Milk which is turned or changed
may be sweetened, and rendered fit for
use again, by stirring in a little soda.
Boiled starch is much improved by
the addition of a little sperm, or a little
salt, or both, or a little gum-arabic dis
solved. In damp closets, strong rooms,
safes, and other places where mildew is
dreaded, a trayful of quick-lime placed
there will prevent it.
Salt will curdle now milk; hence,
in preparing milk-porridge, gravies,
etc., the salt should not be added until
the dish is prepared.
Clear boiling water will remove
tea-stains and many fruit-stains. Pour
the water through the stain, and thus
prevent it spreading over the fabric.
Keroseno will make tin tea-kettles
as bright as new. Saturate a woolen
rag and rub with it. It will also remove
stains from clean varnished furniture.
A carelessly kept coffee-pot will im
part a rank flavor to the strongest in
fusion of the best Java. Wash the coffee-put
thoroughly every day and twice
a week boil borax and water in it for 15
minutes.
Beeswax and salt will make your
rusty flat-irons as clean and smooth as
glass. Tie a lump of wax in a rag, and
keep it for that purpose. When the
irons are hot, rub them first with the
wax-rag, then scour with a paper or
cloth sprinkled with salt.
Now that colors are so largely used
in stockings and so many are ruined in
the laundry, a good plan in washing
tbem is to roll them after being rinsed
into a piece of white linen and squeeze
it so as to remove ail tne moisture pos
sible. then put it to dry, and the stock.
ings will look new again. It is also a
good plan to put a small spoonful of
spirits of salt into the water in which
stockings are washed in order to keep
in the colors.
The following recipe for imparting
to stoves a nne polish, which will neither
burn off nor give out an offensive smell,
will prove acceptable to some of our
readers. Lamp-black is mixed with
water-class fa solution of silicate of
soda) to the c6nsistency of sirup, and
applied with a brush as a thin and
even coating, then left 24 hours to dry.
Afterwards erapnite, or DiacK-ieaa,
mixed with gum-water, is applied, and a
polish obtained by rubbing in tne usual
manner.
It is stated that newly ground coffee.
sprinkled over game, will keep it sweet
and fresh for several days. Clean tne
game that is, wipe off the blood,, cover
the wounded parts with absorbent pa
per, wrap up the heads, and then sprin
kle ground couee over ana among tne
feathers or fur, as the case may be, pack
up carefully, and the game will be pre
served fresh and sweet in the most un
favorable weather. Game sent loose
can not, of course, be thus treated, but,
if packed in boxes or hampers, a tea-
spoonful of coffee is enough for a brace
of birds, and in this pionortion for
larger gamo. A lump of charcoal in
serted in the cavity of a drawn bird is
very desirable.
To wash silks, lay the silk smooth
on a clean board, rub soap upon it, and
brush it with a rather hard brush. The
amount of brushing requisite will de
pend on the quantity of grease upon the
silk. When it has been sufficiently
brushed with the soap to cleanse it from
grease and dirt, it should be well brush
ed on both sides with clean cold water.
A little alum infused in the last water
with Which the silk is brushed will pre
vent the colors from spreading. Should
there be any patches of grease upon the
silk, they should be removed as previ
ously described, or by the application of
a little campbene and alcohol. Folding
or wringing silk when wet must be
scrupulously avoided, as creases made
in silk when wet will never disappear;
and, in like manner, hot suds must not
be used for washing silks, as it will in
most instances remove the colors.
A gentleman who was formerly
tutor to the Marquis of Lome, and a
frequent visitor to him since, describes
him as a man of decided ability, and
says that to all appearances his married
lile is as happy as falls to the average
lot of mortals. As to the Princess
Louise, he says that there is not a more
industrious woman in England. Her
name is ever prominent in good and
charitable works. She is a most ac
complished lady, a tine artist both in
sculpture and painting, and one of the
best judges of laces in England. Neith
er she nor Lome eats the bread of idle
ness ; indeed, the amouut of work they
go throngh with in a day would surprise
a New York lady of fashion very con
siderably. Tho Princess has been call
ed dowdy in her dross, which simply
means that she is sensible. She wears
thick boots, and dresses uccording to
the season and tho dictates of health.
A Damp Place.
The Island of Mauritius is a place
where one can realize what it is to be a
" damp, moist, unpleasant body."
If any one asked me what was the
serious occupation of my life here, I
should answer without hesitation air
ing my clothes," and It would be abso
lutely true. No one who has not seen
it can imagine the damp and mildew
which covers every thing if it be shut
up even for a few days. Ammonia in
the box or drawer keeps the cloves from
being spotted like the pard, but nothing
seems to avail with the other articles of
clothing. Linen feels quite wet if it is
left unused in the almirah, or chest or
drawers, for a week. Silk dresses
break out into a measle-like rash of yel
low spots. Cotton or muslin gowns be
come livid, and take unto themselves a
horrible charnel-house odor. Shoes
and books are speedily covered a quar
ter of an inch deep by a mold which you
can easily imagine would begin to grow
ferns and long grasses in another week
or so. Good Words.
