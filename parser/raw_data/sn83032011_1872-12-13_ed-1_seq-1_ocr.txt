THE ALABAMA TREATY.
When Congress adjourned in Juno
last, n question had been raised by Great
Britain, and was then pending, which
for a time seriously imperilled tho net
tlemcut by friendly arbitration of tho
gravo differences between this Govern
ment and that of Her Britannic Ma
jesty which by tho Treaty of Washing
ton had been referred to tho Tribunal
of Arbitration which had met nt Ge
neva, in Switzerland. Tho arbitrators,
however, disposed of tho question
which had jeoparded tho whole of tbo
treaty, and threatened to Involve tho
two nations In most unhappy relations
towards each other, In a mnnnerentlro
ly satisfactory to this Government, and
in accordance with tho viows nud tlio
policy which it had maintained. Tho
Tribunal, which had convened in Gene
va In December, concluded Its labori
ous session on tho fourteenth day of
September last, on which day, having
availed Itself of the discretionary power
given to It by tho treaty to award n
Him in gro?s, It mado its decision,
whereby it awarded tho sum of $15,600,
000 In gold as tho Indemnity to be paid
by Great Britain to tho United States
lor tho satisfaction of all claims refer
red to Its consideration. Tho decision
hnppily disposes of a loug-standlng dif
ference between tho two Governments,
nnd, in connection with ntiothcr award
made by tho tho German Emperor un
dent rcferenco to him by tho samo
treaty, leaves these two Governments
without a shadow upon tho friendly re
lations which it is my sincerohopomay
forever remain equally unclouded. Tho
report of tho agent of the United States
appointed to attend tho Geneva Tribu
nal, accompanied by tho protocols of
tlio proceedings of tho arbitrators, tho
argumenisoi tno counsel oi notn uuv
ernments, tho award of tho Tribunal,
und tho opinion given by tho several
arbitrators, is transmitted herewith. I

ANOTHER BOUNDARY QUESTION.
Experlencoof tho dlfllcultlcs attend
Ing tho determination of our admitted
lino of boundary, nftrr tho occupation
of tho territory and It? scttlomont by
thoso owing iillciiianeo to tho respective
Governments, points to tho importance
of establishing y natural objects, or
other monuments, tho actual lino be
tween the territory acquired by pur
cha30 from Rtusin and tlio adjoining
possessions of Her Britannic Majesty.
Tho region is now so sparsely occupied
that no conflicting Interests of individ
uals or of jurisdiction aro likely to in
terfere to tlio delay or embarrassment
of tho actual location of tho lino. If
deferred until population shall enter
and occupy tho territory, somo trivial
contest of neighbors may ogaln array
tho two Governments in antagonism.
I therefore reenmmond thonppolnttncnt
of a commission to act Jointly with ono
mat may oo appointed on tlio part or
Great Britain to determino tho lino be
tween our territory of Alaska and the
conterminous possessions of Great Brit
ain. TUB FISHERIES.
In my last annual messago I recom

MEXICO.
BInco vour last session, lho President
of tho Mexican Republic, distinguish

ed with great unanimity by tho peoplo,
n proof of conlldenco on their part in
his patriotism and wisdom which It Is
believed will bo connrmed oy tno re

tleularlv desirable that nothing should
bo left undone by tho Government of
either republic to strengthen thtlr rela

LAWLESSNESS ON TUli RIO GRANDE.
It Is much to bo regretted that many
lawless nets continued to dhturb tho
quiet of tho settlements on tho border
botween our territory anil that of Mox
ico, nnd that complaints of wrongs to
American citizens In various parts of
tho country nro mado. Tlio rovolutlon
nry condition In which tho neighboring
republic has so long been involved has
in somo degreo contributed to this dis
turbance. It is to bo hoped thot with
a moro settled rulo of order through
tho republic, which may bo oxpected
from tho present Government, tho acts
of which Just complaint is mado will
censo, Tlio proceedings of tho Com
mission under tho Convention with
Moxlco of tho Uli of July, 1803, on tho
subjects of claims havo unfortunatoly
bcon checked by an obstacle, for tho ro
tnoval of which measures hnvo bcon
taken by tho two Governments which
it 13 bcllovcd will provo successful.
Tho Commissioners appointed, pursu
ant to tho Joint resolution of Congress
of tho 7th of May last to Inqulro Into
depredations on tlio Tex an frontier hnvo
diligently mado investigations In that
quarter. Their report upon tho subject
will bo communicated to you. Their
researches were necessarily Incomplete,
partly on account of tho limited appro
priation mado by Congress. Moxlco,
on tho part of that Government, has
appointed a similar commission to In
vestigate these outrages. It is not an
nounced officially, but tho pross of that
country states that tho fullest Investiga
tion Is desired, and thnt tho co-operation
of all parties concerned is invited
tosccuro that end. I therefore recom
mend that n special appropriation bo
mado at tho earliest day practicable to
enable tho Cotntrilssioners on tho part
or tho United States to return to their
labors without delay.
CUBA.
It Is with regret that I havo again to
nnnounc" it continuance of tho disturb
ed condition of tho Island of Cuba. No
advanco towards tho pacification of the
discontented part or thn population has
hpen made. Whilo tho insurrection has
mi t not! nn nilvantno-ps nnd exhibits nn
morooi mo elements oi power or oi 1007''""' ...o..iu.,-. .
pro-ipecis 01 u nimaic success man was
exhibited a year ago, Spain, on tho
other hand, has not succeeded in its
repression, nud tho parties stand appar
ently in tbo samo relative attitude
which tney navo occupied ior n long
tlmo past. This contest has lasted now
for moro than four years. Wero It seen
at n distanco from our neighborhood
wo might bo indifferent to Its results.
although humanity could not ho un
moved oy many 01 tno incidents
wherever thev tnltrht occur. It is.
however, nt our door. I cannot doubt
that tho continued maintenance of
slavery in Cuba is among tho strongest
Inducements to tho continuanco 01 tno
strife. A terrihlo wrong is tho natural
cause of n terrible ovil. Tho abolition
of slavery, and tho introduction of
other reforms in thn administration of
the Government In Cuba could not fall
to ndvnnce tho restoration of peace and
order. It is especially to bo hoped that
tho present 11 ueriil Unvernraont ol Spain
will volunturlly adopt this vlow. Tho
law of emancipation, which was passed
moro than two years since, has remain
ed unexecuted in tho absence of regula
tions for its enforcement. It was but ft
feeblo step toward emancipation, but Is
was tno recognition 01 rlgnt, nnu was
hailed as such, and exhibited Spain In

THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
I rcnow tho recommendation mado
on rt previous occasion, of tho transfer
to tho Department of tho Interior, to
which thoy seem more appropriately to
belong, of all tho powers nnd duties In
relation to tho Territories with which
tho Department of State is now charged
by law or by custom.
CITIZENS IN DISTRESS ABROAD.
Congress, from tho beginning of tho
Government, ha.3 wisely mado provision
for tho relief of distressed scamon in
foreign counties. No similar provision,
however, has hitherto boon mado for
tho relief of cltizons In dlstrc.33 abroad
other than seamen. It is understood to
bo customary with other governments
to authorlzo consuls to oxtond such ro
llof to their cltizons or subjects In cer
tain cases. A similar authority nnd an
appropriation to carry it Into effect aro
commended in tho caso of citizens of tho
United States destitute or sick undor
such circumstances. It is woll known
that such citizens resort to foregln coun
tics lu groat numbers. Though most or
them aro ablo to boar tho expenses In
cident to locomotion, there nro somo
who. through acclduntor othorwlso, bo-
como penniless, and have no frlonds nt
noma ublo to succor them. Persons in
this situation must cither perish, cast
themselves upon tho charity or for
eigners, or bo roliovcd nt tho privato
charge of our own offlcors, who usually,
even with the most bonovolont dispo
sitions, hnvo nothing to sparo forsuch
purposes. Should thu nuthority and ap
propriation asKed ror do crantcd. care
will bo taken to carry the beneflcencoof
Congress into effect, that it shall not bo
unnecessarily or unworthily bestowed.
