" :r Lincoln's Message's
We publish the portion of Lincoln's message
to the Yankee Congress, in which,
from the tactile relations we sustain to him
and his people, we are bound to feel some
* degree of interest. There is but one con*
elusion which we can draw from it, and the
whole temper and tone of the people North,,
that is, the necessity of thorough, unceasing
^ preparation to meet and defeat they armies
in battle:
Qtm MILITARY OPERATIONS?PROGRESS 0?
RECONSTRUCTION.
The war eonticuee. Since the last animal
message all the important lines .and
positions then occupied by our forces, hare j
been maintained, and our armies have stead-J
xtv advanced, thus liberating the regions I
.left id the rear, so that Missouri, Kentucky,
v Tennessee, mm1 ports of-other States, have
again produced reasonably fair crops. The ]
? most remarkable feature in the' military
operations of the year is Geuerai Sherman's
attempted march of three hundred miles directly
through insurgent region. It tends
to, show a gTeat increase of our relative
strength that our General-in-Chief should
feel able to confront and hold in check every
active force of the enemy, and yet to detach
a well appointed large annate move on such
an expedition. The result not yet being
known, conjecture in regard to it should
I jaot hare be indulged.
Important movements have also ooeurred
daring the jmb to the effeot of moulding
society for^hltWhy in tl^e Union. Al'
though short of complete success, it is much
S in the direction that twelve thousand citizens
in eaoh of the States of Arkansas and
. Louisiana have organized loyal State Governments
With free Constitutions, and are
earnestly struggling to maintain and admin-1
^ later them. 'The movement in the same
direction, more extensive though less definite,
ia Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee,
ahoold not be overloofa^'^at' Maryland
- presents the example of complete suooess.'
. Wary land n secure to unercy unu uuiuu iur
all the future. The genious of rebellion
will no more elaim Maryland. Like another
foal spirit being driven oat, it may
seek to tear her, bat it woo her no more.
ABOLITION OF SLAVERY BY CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT.
At the last session of Congress, a propo4
- eed amendment of the Constitution abolishing
Biavery tUroaghoat the United States
passed the Sedate, bat failed, for laok of
the reqnisite two-thirds vote, in the House
' of Eepres&tarives. Although the present
is4h?- ??ne ^Jougross, and. nearly the-same
dom or patriotism of those who stood in opposition,
1' venture to recommend there:
consideration and passage of the measure at
4 the present session. Ofoouroe, the abstract
question is not obanged; but an intervening
. election shows Almost certainly thai the
_?/ next Congress will pass the measarej-'if this
does cot. Hence there is only a question
":r. of time as to when the prepoBftd~?Cteftd>nftatr
will go toihe States for their'action j and,
as it is togo st all events, may we not agree
that the Sootier the better. It is not claimed
that the election has imposed a duty on
members to change their views or their
toteB, any further than as sn additional
element to be ooDshiered. Their judgment
may Jbe effected by it It is the voice of the
people, cow, for fire first time, heard npon
the question. In a great national crisis
like ours, unanimity of action among those
seeking a common end is very desirable?
Jg* akoost indispensable; and yet no approMb
to snch unanimity ia attainable, unless some
-??" ? sj ?.:n- c\,n
piu w buti wo> . y* hw
majority, simply beeaase it is the will of
the majority. In this esse, the common
end is foo maintenance of the TJniOQJ and
among the means to secnre that end, snoh
. will, thoagh the eleotion is most clearly dedared
ia favor of such constitutional amendment.
' '
THE REBELS MUST BE SUBDUED.
On careful consideration of all the 6videnoe
accessible, it seems to me that no attempt
st negotiation with the iosnrgent
leader coald result in any good. He would
accept of nothing short of the sewrewe of
.W the XJniop. His declarations to that effect
are explicit and oft repeated. He does not
attempt to deceive as. He affords as no
excuse to deceive ourselves. We oannot
voluntarily yield it. Between him and uS
tha issue is distinct, simple and inflexible.
It is an issue whioh can only-he tried by
war, and deotded* by victory. If we yield
we are beaten. If the Southern people fail
him be is beaten. | Bilher way it would be
the victory and defeat following war. What
, tajej however, of him who heads the insurgent
cause is not necessarily trueof those
. who follow. Although he eannot reaccept
the Union they can. Some of them we
know already desire peace and reunion.?
The number of suob may iooreaae. They
can at any moment have peaoe simply by
laying down their aTms and submitting to
- the national authority under the Constitution.
After so much the government could
'r.v. not, if it would, maintain fir against thorn.
The loyal people would not sustain or allow
.? it. If qaesttons should remain we would
adjust them by the peaceful means of legis-.

toog'ooly in constitutional and lawful channels,
some certain and other possible questions
are and would be beyond the Executive
power to adjust, as, for instance, the
admission of members into Congress, and
whatever might require the appropriation
of money. Executive power itself would be
greatly diminished by the cessation of actual
war. Pardons and remissions of forfeiture,
however, would still be within executive
control. In what spirit and temper
this control would be exercised can be fairly
judged by the past. A year ago general
pardon and amnesty, upon specifier terms,
were offered to all, except oertain deviated
classes, and it was at the same time made
known that the excepted classes were still
within contemplation of special clemency,

Daring the jeer many availed themselves

and certain. Daring the same time also
special pardons have beep granted to individuals
of excepted classes, aud^no voluntary

practically, the door has beenfqr a fall year

how the message was beceived.
A dispatch from Washington says:
, Daring the readipg of /the President's
'Message in the House of Representatives,
was several times interrupted by applause,
especially the oonolnding portion, in which
he says he will not be the instrument, to reenslave
each persona as are made free, by
the Emancipation Proclamation, or by any
of the Aot of Congress; and where he says,
that, "in stating a single condition of peace,
hft meant to-say that the war will cease on
thd part of the government whenever it shall
have ceased on. the part of those who began
h." The applause was by clapping of hands,
with exolamations, 'Good !' (That'sright/
etc. The Speaker rapped with bis gavel
to prevent a further infraction of the rales
of decorum, although it was evident that
he himself shared in the approval of the
deejsionaof the President.
To The Publio.
At the late sessions of the Sooth Carolina
Conference, the undersigned was appointed
agent of that body, to raise fands for the
education of indigent children, of deceased
and disabled soldiers. The obligations of
gratitude to the gallant soldiers, who have
given their lives in defence of their country,
combine With the inspiration of patriotism
and Christian charity toteommend this
cause to every heart. The importance of
educating the children of the State, at all
times worthy of serious consideration, in
the peculiar circumstances of these times,
cannot be over-estimated. Regarded only
as a measure of polioy, it is jadioioos and
wise ; bat when the elaims of orphanage
and-the obligations of patriotism, and the
debt We owe to the noble dead, who sleep
on every held of their ooontry'j glory, are
considered, every generous heart mu$ surely
respond to-the call and swell the oohtriboticBs
to this most worthy and benevolent
object. ~ ;
The following plan, proposed by fchftSoutb
Carolina Conference, is eminently practical,
-and famishes the nyans .for immediate usefulness
:
Whereas, the iudigeut orphans of deceased
soldiers, the children Of disabled soldiers
iu destitute circamstances, and wounded
young soldiers Without means, may desire
au education, have special claims upon our
sympathies as a christian people. And,
whereas, the intellectual and moral education
of this dess is recommended to us by
the warmest feelings of patriotism, as well
as by a profound sense of Christian duty,
therefore, it is by the South Carolina ConResolved,
That a fund shall be raised

the patronage of the South Carolina Conference,
and such other schools as may be
established or sanotioned by that body,

longer needed for the ednoation of those
for whom jt is primarily intended, said fund
shall be at the discretion of the South Carotina
Conference, to be used either in assisting

Messrs. Editors :< Please allow a soldier

to stir them up to a Bense of that duty.
They seem-to $e opposed to the'"tax in

get quite as muoh pay for their prodooe as,
they would in the market. We wjjold like
to know if the Government price >!or produce
is not equal.ta a soldier s pay ? Even
the soldier's wife is opposed to it; We are
surprised, for we did'not think that South
Carolina had a woman who ^raa not willing
to give her fiusband or sons half she had.
Instead of this, we hear that they are not
willing.to.give one-tenth. - Is this the propof

to aell to the Government -for the support
of the soldiers, their wheat at $8 per bushel,
corn at $5, Molasses at S8 per 'gallon,
wool at $5 per pound, fodder at $5 per bon-r
dred, and other produce in the. proportion,
they will not try to raise anything. Now
we want to know if any true South Carolinian
will make use of any snoh language.
If so, bar services are Dofc' p^petly appreciated,
for all of yon well know that we are
fed by the'<taxin kind." If zpenj^e hot
willing to rabe provisions at such prices,
let them come forward and fight for 911. per
month, as that is st> much letter pay than
they get for their produce, and as for-the
ladies, we appeal to their affections. We
are willing to fight" this bloody crusade
through, and intend to do so,* bat at the
same time, we would like to have something
to eat. If the people at home are' opposed
to feeding the soldiers, our limited supply
will give out, and then what are we to. do 7
If those at home will do their duty and feed
us only on half rations, we will whip the
Yankees, and peace and prosperity will a-:
gain smile on ns; but if yon falter in yonr
duty, we may be' oompelled to straggle many

soldier of Gen. Hood's army, in a letter
to the Selma. Reporter, speaks of the discouragements

with while passing from Hood's to Porrest's

and heard so much gloomy forebodings uttered
by those .who are staying at home, he
began to feel gloomy himself. After describing
what he saw and heard, he doses
hialetter thus? - ?
It is suoh influences as these that operate
upon the mind of the soldier.- He leaves
the army bopefnl and returns disheartened.
Let me say to yon, men in the rear, that we
who do the fighting are not whipped, and
if they will have confidence-in . us we will
whip the fight. Be cheerful, be' hopeful,
and with all let each man be determined,

can for the cause.' We will win.- Napoleon's

tGF* A correspondent of the Augusta
Constitutionalittj writing from Milledgeville
on the 29th ultimo, says :
On Sunday, the 20th, the Yankee army
entered tbifl nnfortunate town. Ktijntru&s
cavalry, or rather a portion of it, some six
hundred in number, were the first to oome.
They behaved with tolerable decency.
On Jhe following day the infantry marched
in, composed of the 14th, 20th.and another
corps, the designation of which I have
forgotten. The remaining oorps did not
disturb the town, but made a detour towards

. While here, scenes of outrage and rapine
transpired which would be too horrible
to relate. I will mention a few graphically,
leaving the rest to the imagination jjf 'the
reader. A wholesale plunder of houses
was inaugurated. Gold watobes, silver
plate, olothing?anything and everything
that con Id tempt cupidity?was stolen. In
'their'lust for gold*they frequently maltreated
persons of bdth sexes,"thinking to" extort
by torture. The principal sufferers in this
respeot, were the Messrs. Weitzfelder, and
a daughter of one; of the flame geptlemen,.
Cows/ chickens, and horses were slaughter
wantonly.' They burned, the peni- .
tefitiafy, arterial, depot, railrosd bridge,' and

was blown np. The State House was

haoked to pieces, and book* strewn broadcast.
Out of (he carpets they made horseKlonVflfa

towards t ho ladies. At lqast six or
seven suffered the last extremity.. One
young "|prl became erased in consequence,
and has "been sent to the asylum. Other

in such a plight, compelled to play the piano,

t, A Romance in Real Life.
An Abducted Daughter Discovered After
an Interval of Twenty - Seven Year}?-An
. Heirm.
The Taunton (Mass.). Republican is to
sponsible for t the following story :
- A romance in real life has joat come to
light, aud is at present foe chief gossip of
this city. The foots, as related by an intimate
acquaintance of the fortunate family,
are as follows:
It appeare that about twenty-seven years
ago, a Captain Brown,whose family resided
id Mattapoisett, was the overseer of the estate
of Mr. Henry E. Clifton, a wealthy
gentleman of Richmond, Ya. From some
cause, which still remains a secret, a difficulty
urojjg between Captain Brown and Mr'
Clifton, wherein the former considered himself
theraggrieved party. To revenge himself
for the supposed wrong, he stole 1|r.
Clifton's infant daughter, then bat six
weeks old, on tbff day she. waff christened;
The child was brought to Mattapoisett and
seoretly adopted by Brown and Ms wife as
their own.? She was namefl J alia, and grew
to be a woman. When only sixteen years
old she: married Mr. Isaac 0. Pierce,;' a
printer, who learned his trade in Fall Riv-'
er. Several years ago, they moved to Taun-;
ton, living for a while at East Taunton,'but
recently at "the Green.'^Two ohildren have
been born to them, one of whom . is" notr
living.
During this long period Mrs. Pierce has
lived In blissful ignoranoe of her high parentage,
and Mr. Pierce, who took her for
better or worse, had never imagined himself
the husband of an heiress. He abandoned
the priotfcjV trade shortly after learning it,
and for several years has earned : his daily
bread by. the sweat df his brow, at Mr..
Mason's works in tbw oity. This is their
history until recently. Now comes the denoucmcnt.
Last summer while Rev. Mr. Talbott, of
this oity, was at Saratoga, , lid became acquainted
with Mr. Ciiftou and wife, wbo,
it appears, at the breaking put of tbeji^bellion,
converted their Richmond property
iuto cash and mqvod to Baltimore. lb the
course of conversation'with them Mr. Talbott
remarked upon the striking resemblance
of Mrs. Clifton fo a lady parishioner of his
in Taunton. Nothing particular was thought
of it at first; bat on his repeating the iremark,
Mrs. Clifton inquired the age of the
lady. On being informed that she Was about
twenty-seven, Mrs. Clifton immediately
said to her husband "why, that would be
just the 'Ego of our daughter that was
stolen."
"The matter then received their serious
attention. Mr. Talbott was .taken into
Jheir jmofidenoe, and inqwiiyv instituted aa
