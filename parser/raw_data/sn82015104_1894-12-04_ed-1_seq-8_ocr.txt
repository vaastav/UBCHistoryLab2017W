they joined with tlie members ol the mi

greeted warmly by his old friends.

IN thi: HOUSB.
Washington, Dec .—'l he opening of
the short session of the Houso was pic
turesque in a way, but devoid of inter
esting features. The victorious Republi
cans aud the defeated Democrats ex
changed greetings, aud gave aud took
tii rusts on the results of tho recent politi
cal battle with much animation, but
thorough good nature. The galleries
-were crowded, and half tbe desks on tho
ilooi were smothered with llowers. The
leaders on both sides got enthusiastic re
ceptions from their respective partisans,
the appearance of Speaker Crisp, ex-
Sueaker Keed, Mr. Y\ ilson and Mr. Pur
rows being the signal lor long and loud
outbursts. There was no chance in the
first day's proceedings lor the reference
to the elections, so the actual proceedings
■were dull aud uninteresting. Seven new
members were sworn iv. aud alter a long
wait the President's message was read.
Although it was iistened to with interest,
it was concluded without a mark ol ap
proval or disapproval.
As the hands of the clock pointed to 12,

SHIPPING IM'ERE.XS.
Kills Introduced lv tho House to Lower
Taxes on Sailing Vessels.
Wasiiini'lon, Dec. "J.—Two bills of in
terest to shipping people wore introduced
in tho House to-day by Representative
1 jthiau of Illinois. The legislation in
corporated in them was recommended by
Mr. Chamberlain of the Navigation Bu
reau of the Treasury Departmeut in his
last report.
The tirst bill provides that gross ton
nage instead of net tonnage shall be the
basis of compuliug tonnage taxes, aud
what is known as the three-cent rate per
ton is reduced to two cents and the six
cont rale to live cents. Theso changes
will not affect the decreased revenues,
but will diminish the taxes on sailing
vessels, which are now said to be too
high, and will transfer a portion of these
charges lo steam vessels.
The second bill changes the measure
ment law also to make it conform to those
of <-real Britain, Norway and other na
tions, and the object sought by the pro
posed legislation is to dimmish the
amount of taxes which vessels of the
United States have to pay iv foreign
ports.
PRESIDENT CLEVELAND.
He It-turns to the White House After
an Absence of Two Weeks.
"Washington, Dec 3. President Cleve
land came to the White House at If
o'ciock this morning, lt was the first
visit he had made to tlie city in two
weeks. He came alone, and was met by
Mr. Thurber wheu he entered. The
President looked very well, considering
the severe illness he had suilered from,
ami tho outward sign of his ailment is
the pronounced limp which characterized
his walk Irom tlie carriage iuto the houso.
There were very few callers in the
morning, the only one of note being Cap
taiu Catchmgs of Mississippi, who, in
behalf of the Speaker, came to luijuire
wbother the President would receive the
Committee on Notiticatiou at the White
House.
Free Coinage Hill.
Washington, Dec. 3.—A bill providing
for free coinage of silver was introduced
iv the House to-day by Representative
Hartman of Montana. Au important pro
vision of tho measure is that requiring
import duties to bo paid in gold in cash
whore the importations are brought from
countries where Governments refuse to
open their mints to free coinage of silver
aud gold.

Washington, Dec.
McMillan of Tennessee, the prime mover
of the income tax law, says there is no

PUNCH WITH CARE.
Why the Railroad Man Should Obey
This Injunction.
Some Explanations of the Mysterious
Symbols a Passen-ger Will Fiud
ou His Ticket.
The ticket punching system is the
masonry of railroading. It almost ranks
as an occult science. The ticket auditing
department is the custodian of these mys
terious symbols—the punch marks are as
important in the disposition of tickets as
are signatures in the acceptance of bank
checks. In any case of dispute between
passenger and conductor, or conductor
and company, the punch marks are linal
and incontrovertible evidence, except
where an original punch mark has been
punched out by a larger punch in crimi
nal hands, which seldom happens.
Every passenger conductor In America
has a punch of his own, though not ol his
own selection, and when he applies it to
a passenger's ticket he has committed
himself to it as irrevocably as though he
affixed his signature on the back of the
contract. Every conductor must punch
every ticket on nis train, or hold himself
liable for personal payment of the fare of
his division or part thereof over which
the unpunched portion reads. In nothiug
are railroad companies more strict than
in the use of ticket punchos, the conduct
or's insignia of oiiice and the company's
material guarantee of square dealing by
all interested.
The punch mark is the passenger's
protection. By it or its absence any mis
take or oversight on the conductor's part
involving subsequent confusion or loss to
the passenger can be easily traced, proved
and rectilied. For illustration, a passen
ger receutly purchased a round-trip
ticket from Portland to San Francisco.
On the going trip Uie conductor by mis
take tore oil the section reading "to San
Francisco." Ihe next conductor, having
no evidence of the passenger's right to
travel over his division, demanded cash
fare, which was paid and receipted. Ou
arriving at San l-raucisco tho passenger
called upon the Ceuerai Passenger Agent
and, showing his return portion of the
ticket aud receipt for part cash payment
on going trip, asked that his loss bo made
good. The General l'asseuger Agent
hesitated a moment.
"Look here," said the passenger. "I
know something about railroad tickets
myself, even if I'm not a deadhead. You
look up the going portion oi 1113' ticket,
and if you don't liud punch mark 'V ou
it I'll give you (SO cash and go home."
The ticket was iooked up and the iden
tical punch mark discovered, wberoupon
tbe passenger department refunded the
cash payment made on tho train.
The lirst mark punched in tru* ticket is
tho letter "L," meaning origim.ii .- "Lim
it," by tho city ticket agent or total anient
who issues it. This letter is used by all
agents who sell tickets in this country,
and designates the class and limit of the
ticket. Tho star punch is used about as
freely as the letter "L," and iias about
the same signitioance. lt is generally ap
plied to iron-clad or not-slop-over, one
way tickets, and also descriptive tickets,
it is even used ou coupon tickets, known
to auditors as "excursion" tickets, which
read to a far point on home line, to desig
nate class and limit. Liko tne "L," it is
used on the body ot contracts. In tho
Auditor's oiiice it is used for cancellation.
Ordinary card tickets, which aro used tor
transportation one way between local
stations where there is not sufficient
travel to justify tho company in paying
tiie cost, of separate printing, are novo:
puuehed by tiie selling ageut. Besides
tho "L" and star, all ticket oiiices have
tho mark "1-*J," which is applied lo tick
ets sold to childreu entitled to ride at
half-fare. If baggage is checked from
tne house or hotel, tho letters "I*. P." are
puuehed out on the ticket, meaning "bag
gage cnecked." The transier company
and also the baggageman at the depot
have this punch, tho use of which pre
vents a passenger from getting ISO pounds
of baggage checi.ed a., nis house and an
other 10. pounds at the depot. 1 hen in
large cities the gatemen have a punch,
"C," which means that "holder has
passed through the gate," and nothing
more.
Ticket agents, baggagemen and gate
men use always the punches belonging
to their respective classes. Conductors
have individual punches, as already ex
plained, no two oi which make the same
mark. Ten thousand would be a mod
erate estimate of all tho conductors'
punch marks in this country.
Tiie system of punching tickets held by
passengers is simple euough. If a ticket
reads to a point on his division, tho con
ductor punches it and places it in his
pocket, if it reads beyond, he punches
it to the end of his division, and if a sep
arate section represents his division, Ue
tears it off and places it in his pocket.
Each succeeding conductor follows the
same rule. If the passengers asks for a
stop-over at any intermediate point, his
ticket is punched to the end oi the run
just the same, and a stop-over chock is
issued. The return portion of a round
trip ticket is never touched in conductors
ou going passage. If a ticket reads over
two or more roads, the conductors of each
are responsible only for their own por
tions, aud must under no circumstances
meddle with any foreign portion, in
tins way all confusion is avoided by the
respective ticket auditing departments in
making the monthly settlement of pro
portions with each other, ln case of or
dinary ticKets it is immaterial whether
conductors punch high or low, to the
right or left, but involuntarily they select
certain pet portions. <>f course there are
perilous of every ticket where no con
ductor is supposed to apply his instru
ment.
Every conductor knows a few other
conductors' punches, but tho ticket audit
ing department knows them all. liefore
the general passenger agent gives out a
punch to a conductor tho ticket auditor
writes the recipient's name in a large
book, and opposite it his mark is punched
out, aud for every ticket with that mark
which is subsequently ieceived that con
ductor is personally responsible. His
mark means that within a given time on
a certain train, running over a certain
division, he accepted from s passenger,
named or uuamed, the material evidence
of his right to travel, and indorsed the
company's spociheation of privileges to
said passenger.
The punch mark means all this and
more. It means that the conductor holds
himself personally responsible lor any
oversight, indiscretion or irregularity iv
his handling of the ticket. If he loses
his puuch he must report immediately to
headquarters, whereupon his General
Passenger Agent will furnish him a new
one, necessarily not of the same denomi
nation. The old punch mark is bulle
tined as lost. Great care is exercised in
this regard because of the opportuuity
atlordeu a scalper of securing the old
punch and manipulating tickets. A fa
vorite trick of some scalpers used to be to
punch out a small mark by inserting
about It a larger mark, thereby changing
the denomination of the ticket.
Such marks as "1." or "1-" or other
letters, excepting "ii," "L" and 'TJ
C," have no significance whatever, any
[ more than has au angle or bar. Some
I people suppose they represent conduct
i or's names. Every mark has untold
signiiicance to the ticket auditor, but
none to any one else.
Ilaviugexciusivo jurisdiction over con
ductors, the Division Superintendent cau
change them around to different trains
without notifying the ticket auditing
department, which cares littlo iv lact,
since the same conductors always carry
the same punches, aud the infallible
record is not disturbed.—St. Paul Press,

A PRIMS VAL CITY.
Tho Center of Ancient 2E__re__n Civil
ization Discovered at Crete.
But of all the centers of Cretan an
tiquit3-, by far tho most imposing is the
site of the ruined primeval city, now
known as ('oulas, from the Turkish
word for a tower, of which the ancient
name is still lost in the mist of timo.
i'he city, indeed, seems to have been de
serted before the dawn of history. Among
the many relics that 1 was abb" to collect
irom tho spot, including a series of My
cenaean gems, not a fragment belonged
to later times. The walls and buildings
are almost without exception built in a
rudo "Cyclopean" style, and there is
nothing visible that can be safely called
"Helenic" in the latter sense of the word.
The site itself was visited by Captain
Spratt, who wrongly identified it with
the ancient OIOUB, which is still marked
by the village of Klunta aud considerable
ruins on the neighboring isthmus of
Spiualunga. But how much is still to bo
made out by the explorer may be gath
ered from the fact that it was only alter a
second day spent among the ruins that I
came upon a second and hitherto unde-
Bcribed acropolis, on the summit of which
were the lower walls of a building, tho
hall or megaron of which shows close
points of comparison with more than one
building with tiie Sixth or Mycencean
city of Troy—lho true Homeric Pera
gauios. For vastuess of extent the rums
of Ooulas aro surely unrivaled among
tho primeval remains on Kuropean Soil.
Wall rises within wall, terrace above ter
race, and, what can hardly be paralleled
elsewhere, the dwelliug-houses them
selves, oi the same Cyclopoan construc
tion, are still partly standing within the
walls. Prom the acropolis hights opens
oul a panorama of sea and land worthy of
the colossal ruins around. The glimpses
of the neighboring coast land bring home
to us the lact that we are within iiail of
tho chief harbors of Pastern Crete, look
ing out toward the islands .topping-stones
to Asia Minor. There can be little doubt
that futuro research and much-needed
excavation will reveal in Goulas a prin
cipal center of ___gean civilization. Lon

ABOUT GRAY HAiR.

Concerning gray hair, there seems to
be no rational theory lor change in ihe
color of the liair, except that of loss of

tho result of natural or artilical causes.
Probably among the Americans the eariy
age at which the hair blanches is duo
largely to nervous conditions. Mental
and puysical disturbances undoubtedly
often affect the secreting apparatus of the
hair, destroying coloring matter, for his

neither can coloring matter, once entirely
destroyed, bo restored. Do not believe
the quacks who pretend to restore gray
hair to the yonthlul color in any other
way than by dyeing, for science lias not
yet discovered a method by whicn pig
ment, once entirely exhausted, can bo re
newed. Dan. hair may bo bleached, but
no sane person could be deceived by the
dull, losterless yellow ol hair so treated,
neither does dye deceive anyone, and a
woman who would look charming wuh a
head of white hair kept perfectly clean
and Huffy with legitimate treatment, be
comes disgusting when she resorts to
such flagrantly artificial means for keep
ing tiie hair dark or blonde.
When one's hair turns gray attontion
should be directed toward keeping it

complexion delicate and line with color,
the eyes bright, and tho expression ani

Vagrant Johu WiUou Tries to Chew
Cp a Fellow-Prisoner.
A man named Michael Ryan applied
at the polico station last night for a
night's lodgiug. He was put into the
"hobo" cell, and had not been iv there
more than ten minutes before Sergeant
Plunkett heard a scuitle going on in the
cell. Ho opened the door and found that
Ryan was engaged in a lierce tight with
a man named Johu Wilson, who had
been arrested for vagrancy. The latter
was on top of Ryan, and instead of using
his fists was chewing Ryan's face.
Sergeant Plunkett and two or three
moro oilicers who were at the station had
all they could do to separate the men.
V. hou thei* did so they found that Ryan
Lad beeu se\erely bitten on the lace by
Wilson.*
Wilson was put in a cell l.y himself,
and a charge of mayhem was entered
against him.
About 1 o'clock this morning a strong
smell of smoke pervaded 4 the police sta
tion and upon investigation it was found
to issue from the cell occupied by Wil
son, on opening the cell door the bed
was found to be in llames and tho occu
pant nearly sutrocated. lie was dragged
out and soon brought around aii right.
How the lire originated is not known,
but it is believed to have been started by
the prisoner.
H. A. KNOX'S BOND.
It Will Probably be Fixed To-day aud
Knox Koloased.
Lifo in tho jail at Woodland is becom
ing very wearisome to Chairman Knox
oi tho A. 11. I. Mediation Committee,
and his friends have been exerting them
selves for soverai da\ s past to procure a
new bond that would permit his release.
They wero unsuccessful until yester
day, whon a bond was presented to Judge
Grant of Yolo with the names of May
hew and Specht. Judge Oram accepted
Mayhew's bond, and honored that of
Specht to the extent of $1,000. The latter
owns land in Sacramento, as to the value
pf which Judge Grant is not sufficiently
informed.
A tele;.hone message to the Recokd-
UNIOK states, however, that it is thought
iv Woodland the bond will be perfected
to-day and that Knox will bo released
Irom jail.
A CUTTHROAT AMONG FISHES.
Tho Swordflsfa Fights Lverytlnu_r, and
Death Follow* in His Wake.
The swordiish is the pugilist ot' the se:;,
a pugilist who" wastes no timo in talking
and mis>es no opportunity to light. Un
like the shark, the swordhsh wouid rather
fight than eat. The shark is ferocious,
ravenous and a glutton, but tho swordiish
tights for tj l 0 sake of ngii tin<_;, without
troubling whether the object 01 his attack
is worth eating or not. Anything is
gamo for him from a mackerel to a man
of-war. (>no of tne things in the ascend
ing scale between tho two is a whale.
The passen*_ors on an .- tlantic liner had
tho j_oo.i fortune somo timo ago to witness
an encounter between several swordiish
and a whale, i'he huge body of the ce
tacean was seen to nse repeatedly above
the water, quivering with pain and lash
ing his tail with fury. His antagonists
could not at first bo seen.
Whon a view of them was obtained it
was evident that they wero enjoying
themselves. They prodded the unhappy
whale with wonderful vigor and rapidity.
lt was hard work killing so large an ani
mal and ono so well protected by blub
ber, but tho swordiish persevered aud
finally did the whalo to death.
There aro a lew animals which attack
man and other animals without provoca
tion. Tbo sword fish is among them.
Ino tights between swordiish are the
most interesting to witness, as in other
cases the chances aro apt to be unequal.
Two swordiish light like determined and
expert fencers. One of these combats is
described by an eye-witness. The two
lish first rushed straight at one another
swordpoint to swordpoint. one missed
and the other's weapon entered his head
just below thooyo. Tho wounded lish,
however, turned aa his eneinv rushed
past and drove his sword clear through
the other's body.
It is asserted that tho force with which
a largo swordiish strikes is equal to that
whicn drives a tweuty-four-pound shell
from a howitzer.
The common swordllsh found in tho
Atlantic is Xiphias gladius. Tho sword
is a sharp, bony continuation of tiio up
per jaw. it attains a length of live to ten
feet, and whon full-grown cau pierce the
copper-sheated wooden hull of a ship.
1 liero are various authenticated casos in
which this has happened. One ship
sprang a leak at sea from no apparent
cause. When she arrived in port it was
found that tho sword of one of tnose tish
had pierced the copper, thick oak hull
and pine sheathing, and theu entered a
barrel. Tho sword had broken oil.
The sinking ot tho sloop lied Hot, in
the servico of the l'nited Mates Fish
Commission, oil' New Bedford, was
caused by sword fish.
When a BWordfisb gets into a school of
tish he does not merely kill what ho wants
to eat Ho dashes in among them, dealing
death right and left. His wake is strewn
with dead and mutilated fish. A largo,
fat, oily cod is one of the swordlish's
favorite victims.- Now York World.
