J?traps and ^facte.
? Judge David Davis has made an inter-1
esting discovery. He says President Arthur's !
message is the first document of the sort in j
forty years that has not referred to the South
as a distinctive section of the country.
? The John P. King Manufacturing Cora- I
pany, with a capital of 81,000,000, will be or- ;
ganized at Augusta, Ga., on the 28th instant.
The stock has been subscribed, over $400,000
being taken in Boston, New York and
Philadelphia, and the balance in Augusta.
This makes S3,000,000 subscribed for cotton
mills in Augusta within three years. All
mills in that city have made over 14 per cent,
on capital within the last year.
? At Shelby, N. C., last week, Amos Horn, J
colored, aged forty, caused the death of bis
son, Burt Horn, aged sixteen, by kicks and j
blows with a walking stick and wagon whip, j
The boy was buried on Saturday, but his body
was exhumed by the coroner's jury on the j
following day, and an examination shows the I
stomach, spleen and liver bruised and swollen.
The father has been committed to jail. The
negroes are excited and swear vengeance.
? In New York, after a long and bitter j
contest over the will of Edwin P. Christie, i
the founder of negro minstrelsy, who died in
1862, and the will of his son, E. Byron Christie,
a decision has been rendered by which
the heirs of the widow of the former are entitled
to some $35,000. Edwin P. Christie
left originally an estate of about $200,000,
hut through litigation the major portion has
passed into the hands of attorneys.
? Keifer, the new Speaker of the House of
Representatives, is, according to the Augusta
Chronicle and Constilutionaliat, "a verv burly,
red faced, German-looking man. His hair
and beard are bushy and iron grey in color.
He was noted on the floor of the House more
because of bis roaring voice than for anything
else. He is an utter Stalwart, and one
of the few soldiers of the war retaining
vindictive sentiments."
? On Friday morning last, the fast mail train
northward bound, ran off the track when between
High Point and Jamestown, N. C.
The whole train was thrown from the track,
thereby slightly injuring many of the passengers,
and severely injuring Mr. G. W. White,
of Chester, S. C. Mr. White was riding in
the last coach, and was thrown from his seat,
the stove falling on him. When the train arrived
at Greensboro, the assistance of a physician
was called, at the railroad's expense,
and he had recovered sufficiently to leave on
Saturday evening. The rest of the passengers
were not materially injured. The.run off
was caused by a broken rail.
? Last week was the most successful so far
of the Atlanta Cotton Exposition, both in
point of cash receipts and general attendance.
The receipts footed up over two thousand in
excess of the week before, although there
was no special event to attract visitors. This
week there are special attractions daily, and
the attendance and receipts will largely overtop
those of any preceding week. The Ex
position is fully in shape, every feature being
in position and every piece of machinery in
motion, and the prospect is that from now
until the closing of the gates on 31st of December
there will be a rush to the Exposition
from all sections of the country.
? A very fine piece of work has been set
in place in the ladies' room of the Baltimore
and Potomac depot at Washington. It is a
memorial stone, to mark the place where President
Garfield was shot, and is set in the wall
directly over the silver star in the floor
which marks the place where the Presideut
fell. The tablet is of white marble, about
three by four feet iu superficial area, and is
an elegant piece of carving. An eagle surmounts
the work, holding iu its claws arrows
and laurels, and beneath it the American
flag falls gracefully about a tablet iu gold
letters, inscribed : "James Abram Garfield,
President of the United States, shot July 2,
1881."
? The stockholders of the Keely Motor
Company in Philadelphia, dissatisfied and
impatient beyond endurance, have filed a bill
in equitv to oblige Keely to disclose the secret
of his workshop. They say that the defendant
has secured from the company over
SloO.OOO under various pretexts, and ask that
he be compelled to give such information as
unll^oriaklo cbilla/l nnronna tn n/mcfriinf nnrl
work a machine to collect, generate and eliminate
the "force,"- and that he shall immediately
apply for letters patent upon his inventions.
He is also commanded to deliver all
the machines he has yet constricted to the
company, and an injunction is asked restraining
him from removing the same from the jurisdiction
of the court.
? At Suanee Station, on the Atlanta and
Charlotte Air-Line Railroad, thirty miles
from Atlanta, an accident occurred at a late
hour on Wednesday night of last week,
resulting in the instant killing of Conductor
John P. Dean and Flagman Charley Herst,
the former of Atlanta, and the latter of Decatur.
The cab and two flat cars were totally
destoyed. The particulars appear to be
that as a local freight train was approaching
Suanee at a slow speed the through passenger
train from Charlotte ran into it. The
engine was badly used up, and the stove in
the cab turning over set fire to the cab, from
which the flames spread to the two new flat
cars being brought to Georgia for the use of
the Georgia and Pacific Railroad, now undergoing
construction. The body of Charley
Herst was partly disfigured by fire.
? At Nashville, Tenn., last Friday, John J.
Vertrees shot Senator Smith, of Fentress
* il. ~ 1 1^ ' iL?
uuuiuy, in uie icu suuuiuer, iu wis rutuuuu
of the Maxwell House. The wound will not
prove fatal. Vertrees had iu a case in court
charged Senator Smith with bribery and corruption
in voting for the State debt bill during
the last regular session of the Legislature.
In the Senate on Thursday, Senator Smitb
denounced Vertrees as a liar, and upon the
adjournment of the Senate Vertrees sought
him at the Maxwell House and shot him.
Senator Smith claims that he was taken unawares.
He states that he was seated reading
a newspaper when Vertrees approached and
fired at him, without giving him any warning.
Vertrees' friends assert that Senator Smith
was in the act of rising and drawing his pistol
when Vertrees shot him.
? Two papers up in Lewiston, Maine, the
Gazette and the Journal, have just been carrying
on a very animated and interesting debate
on the question whether cotton manufacturing
was more profitable in the South or in
New England, the Gazette upholding the
Southern cause and carrying off the victory.
Taking the question of dividends the Gazette
shows they are strongly in favor of the
Southern mills. The Graniteville factory of
South Carolina paid a dividend of 20 per
cent, last year. The Augusta, Ga., mills 15
per cent., the Langley mill 15 per cent., the
Woodlawn and Lawrence manufacturing
companies, of North Carolina, 15 per cent.,
and so on throughout the South. These are
not isolated cases, as is shown by the fact that
the July dividends of the forty-five mills in !
Georgia averaged over 12 per cent. On the j
other hand the mills at Lewiston, Me., did not:
pay a cent of dividend, and two of them j
found it necessary to scale down their capital i
to 75 and 90 per cent., respectively.
? The Greenville (S. C.) New thus an- j
nounces the death if J. K. Jillson, ex-Super- j
intendent of education of South Carolina:]
Mr. H. H. Jillson, who is connected with the
revenue service in this city, received a telegram
from Springfield, Massachusetts, on
Thursday, announcing the death of his brother,
Mr. J. K. Jillson, at that place. He had
been professor in one of the colleges there.
Mr. J. K. Jillson was well and favorably
known in this State during the Republican
regime, being Superintendent of the Public
Schools from 1863 to 1876, when he wa9 displaced
by the success of the Democracy. He
was among the honorable exceptions to the
mass of Republican politicians here, and was
an honest and efficient officer, always
endeavoring to check the abuses which
disgraced most of those who held office during
the Republican administration of affairs in
the State. His efforts were always directed
toward the advancement and improvement
of our education < cilities.
YORK VILLE. S. C.:
THURSDAY MORNING, DEC. 15, 1881.
THE LEGISLATURE.
For our summary of the proceedings of the
Legislature, we feel constrained to make our
acknowledgments to the Charleston News and
Courier and the Columbia Jicgister, which papers
furnish comprehensive rei>orls of each
day's proceedings. As may be seen, very little
public work of importance has as yet been
completed. The bill for the repeal of the lien
law was effectually killed by the House of
Representatives 011 Friday; and though the
opponents of the lien law threaten to bring up
a bill in another l'orm for its repeal, it is safe
to predict, from the vote of Friday, that let
the measure be revived in ever so questionable
a shape, the lien law will be left on the statute
books substantially in the form under which
it has given a majority of the people of the
State general satisfaction ever since its enactment.
Our private advices from Columbia are
to the effect that the agricultural committee
were equally divided on this bill, and the chairman
decided it^fate before the committee by
casting his vote in favor of its rej>eal. This
led to a minority report in opposition to the repeal,
signed by six members of the committee,
among them Mr. ones, of York. On the final
vote before the II mse, of the York delegation,
all voted against the repeal excepting Dr.
ftlack, who voted aye.
On the subject of a general fence law for the
State, which excepting from its provisions two
or three counties, has passed the House, the
Senate will probal \y be about equally divided,
and the fate of .he bill before that body is
somewhat doubtfi i.
The registration bill, which has passed the
Senate, will be strongly contested in the House.
While the low country generally desire this
law, opposition to it comes mainly from the
counties in the up country. The latest phase
of this question is thus given by a correspondent
of the Neics and Courier, under date of
last Sunday:
A majority of the State Democratic Executive
Committee, at their meeting in Columbia
last week, agreed to recommend the adoption
of a law providing for registration pure and
simple, the severance of Federal and State
elections, and the reduction of the number of
boxes to four instead of eight, as provided in
the bill now before the General Assembly?one
box for the State, one for the county, one for
the legislative and one for the Federal offices.
The committee think that the adoption of such
a bill will harmonize the different views of all
the counties and secure a very fair settlement
of a most perplexing problem.
It is not improbable that the two houses will
finally agree upon a bill modeled upon the suggestions
thrown out by the State Democratic i
Executive Committee as above indicated.
In the Senate, 011 Monday, the bill for the
repeal of the lien law was indefinitely postI
1 mi !11.. -r : ?
I>oneu. j.ne committee ut u^ncuiuuc ut mc
Senate, to whom the bill providing for a general
stock law for the State was referred, met
on Monday evening for the special consideration
of the bill. This was the third meeting of
the committee 011 the subject. After considering
the whole matter, the committee determined
to rejiort the bill back to the Senate
without recommendation. Three of the committee
favored the passage of the bill and three
were opposed to it. The seventh member was
absent: The advocates of the bill claim that
it will pass the Senate by a very small majority,
while the opponents of the measure are almost
equally confident of defeating its passage.
A conference of the Democratic Senators was
held in the Senate Chamber on Monday night
to discuss the registration and the election bill.
Mr. Jeter was called to the chair, and Mr.
Beatty was appointed secretary. The conference
was held with closed doors.
In the House, on Monday, a Senate concurrent
resolution urging the members of the
General Assembly to accept the invitation to
visit the Atlanta Exposition and go in a body,
leaving Columbia on the -20th instant, was
agreed to after a sharp debate. There is a difference
of opinion as to whether this resolution
binds the General Assembly to go, as the resolution
to adjourn, for the recess, 011 the 21st
instant has still been unacted upon by the Senate.
The majority of the members are very
anxious to go, however, and if cheap railroad |
fare can l>e arranged the probability is that the
Legislature will adjourn on the 19tli and a large
number of the members will go in a body, together
with the Governor and the Statu officers
as an official representation from the State.
Under the resolution the members are to pay
all their own expenses.
SOUTH CAROLINA NEWS.
? A committee of five, including three colored
men, from Floyd county, Ga., visited
Anderson last week to see the operation of the
fence law, and were much pleased.
? Gov. Ilagood has exercised executive clemency
in twenty-seven cases during the past
year. Of these, sixteen were full pardons and
eleven commutations of sentence.
? The receipts of cotton at Anderson for the
month of November amounted to 2,459 bales,
making a total of . ',059 bales for the season.
Compared with the receipts of last year, this
shows a falling off of about one-third.
? In the United States Circuit Court at Columbia
last Thursday the the case of the State
vs. Ilugh P. Kane, a revenue officer, for the
murder of Amos Ladd, was continued until
next term, in consequence of the absence of
State's witnesses.
? The directors and stockholders of the Charlotte,
Columbia and Augusta Railroad met
Thursday afternoon in the Carolina National
Rank at Columbia. No changes were made in
the board of officers. Various reports we submitted
and approved.
? We learn from the Chester Reporter that a
negro went into a bar-room in Chester one day
last week and offered to bet the proprietor
that he could drink a large quantity of whisky
without being hurt by it. The offer was accepted,
and the proprietor pointed to a keg and
told the negro to help himself. The latter
turned the faucet and drank of the whisky until
he fell. He died that night.
? Another serious blow seems about to fall
upon Edgefield?in the reported breaking of |
the Atlas Fire Insurance Company, of Ilart-'
ford. I'll is company is reported to have suspended
on the 15th of November. By its suspension,
Mr. Alvin Hart would lose S'2,600,
Mr. W. II. Brunson, $1,225, Mr. Arthur S.
Tompkins $750, and Mr. A. A. Clisby $750.
? Says the Newberry Herald: There is no
disguising the fact that the cotton crop of this
county is going to be decidedly short. The receipts
up to the 1st instant amount to 9,103
bales, against 12,251 for the same period last
year?a fall off of 3,088 bales. This showing taken
in connection with the fact that cotton
lias been rushed into market faster than usual
this year, makes us fearful that our estimate
of 15,000 bales or J of a crop, will not be
reached.
? Under the head of Factory Items, the
Chester Jteportcr of last week says : The machinery
for the Fishing Creek Manufacturing
Company arrived here last week. It is to be
forwarded to the factory and put into position
without delay, and spinning will begin early
in January. The Cedar Shoal factory is running
regularly and turning off about 300 pounds
of yarn daily. There is a revival of the factory
talk here in the town of Chester. It is said
that $30,000 are in sight for the proposed
building of a cotton factory at this place.
Additional subscriptions can be obtained.
THE FORTY-SEVENTH CONGRESS.
The first regular session of the Forty-Sev

On the 6th, the President's message was received
and read in both houses. Mr. Edmunds'
resolution continuing the committees
of last session was adopted, Mr. Pugh having
withdrawn his amendment authorizing the
President ]>ro tern, to decide whether the committees
be divided equally or otherwise between
the two parties.
In the House, Mr. McKinley, of Ohio, offered
the following resolution, which was
unanimously adopted :
Resolved, That a "committee of one member
from each .State represented in this House be
appointed on the part of the House to join the
committee which may be appointed on the part
of the Senate to consider and report by what
token of respect and affection it may be proper
for the Congress of the United States to
express the deep sensibility of the nation at
the decease of its late President, James Abram
Garfield, and that so much of the message of
the President as refers to that melancholy
event be referred to that committee.
The House adjourned until Friday.
In the Senate on the 7tli, Senators Sherman,
Pendleton, Dawes, Lapham, Bayard and Morgan
were appointed by the Chair on the Joint

Among other communications laid before the
Senate was one front acting Attorney-General
Phillips enclosing the annual report of the Attorney.
General. A portion of the morning
hour was consumed in an uninteresting discussion
upon the propriety of dispensing with
reading at length of communications from the
heads of the departments addressed to the
President of the Senate, and on a tie vote on
the question, the President pro tem. voted aye,
aijd the reading of the communications above
named proceeded. The following bills were
introduced. : By Mr. Ingalls, enabling the
people of New Mexico to form a State government
; tabled. By Mr. Call, a bill granting
pensions to soldiers in the Mexican, Creek,
Seminole and Blackhawk wars.
In the Senate on the 8th, Mr. Garland introduced
a bill on the Presidential succession,
' ' ' -r 1. 4-rx
upon wnicy ne gave nouce ut ma uucuuun tu
speak at a future time. A bill granting the
franking privilege to Mrs. Garfield, was unanmously
passed, it being the first bill of the session
to pass the Senate.
Cn the 9th the Senate was not in session,
and the House, after a short session in which
no business of general importance was transacted
further than the appoiniment of a committee
on the death of President Garfield, adjourned
until Friday.
In the Senate 011 thfe 12th,Mr. Edmunds introduced
a bill to provide for defraying the extraordinary
expenses incurred in consequence
of the assault upon the late President Garfield,
authorizing the secretary of the treasury to pay
the necessary and reasonable expenses incurred
in behalf of the late President, provided the
aggregate sum allowed and paid does not exceed
$100,000.
THE TRIAL OF GUITEAU.
The trial of the assassin of President Garfield
is still progressing, the public interest in
it remaining unabated, though the proceedings
of the past week were not marked by any
unusual incident.
The morning session 011 the 7th was devoted
to an examination of citizens of Freeport, 111.,
in behalf of the prosecution. The evidence of
these witnesses was that they had known Guiteau's
family and did not regard the father of
the prisoner insane, and also that they believed
other members of the family were sane.
Some twenty or thiity experts were summoned
for the defense; but the fact that only
a few of them gave their testimony excited
some remark. It is understood that nearly
all the experts summoned for the defense came
to the conclusion that they could do Guiteau
110 good by their testimony. Of the few experts
who had had interviews with Guiteau
none appeared on the witness stand.
On the 8th, the Court room was again densely
packed. Mrs. Julia M. Wilson, of Leadville,
Col., was the first witness. She testified
that L. W. Guiteau was her uncle and she
knew him from her earliest recollection. She
gave a most feeling account of the life and
character of her mother, Mrs. Maynard, (who,
it had been alleged by defense, had died insane)
who died from pneumonia in 18o(>; witness
was her constant attendant in to the hour of
her death and never saw the slightest indication
of Mightiness or insanity. Guiteau, during
the examination of this witness became
greatly excited and interrupted the testimony
several times. At the conclusion of the witness1
examination George C. Maynard was
called and corroborated portions of her testimony,
and Court took a recess for an hour.
Several witnesses were examined, all of
whom had known Guiteau in the West and in
Boston, and none ever supposed him insane,
though all thought him lacking in moral
character. Rev. R. S. McArthur, pastor of
the Calvary Baptist Church, New York, testified
that Guiteau had been a member of his
church and had been cited before the congregation
for immoral conduct. The witness'
testimony irritated Guiteau greatly. Scoville
objected to the admission of this testimony,
when the District-Attorney announced his
object was to demonstrate that what the defense
calls insanity is nothing more than devilish
depravity.
Some written interrogatories to President
Arthur, and his answers thereto in writing,
were put in evidence as follows :
Q.? Do you know the prisoner in this case?
A.-Yes.
(,>.?IIow many times, and when and where
did you ever see him ? A.?I have seen him
at least ten times, possibly as often astwenty.
Altogether, mostly in and about the rooms of
the Republican State Committee, in the Fifth
Avenue Hotel, New York city, in the Fall of
1880, and two or three times in the streets of
Washington, in the Spring of 1881.
(,)?What conversation, if any, did you have
with him ? A.?None, excepting to return the ;
ordinary salutation of the day, and once or
twice iii answer to his requests to be employed <
in (he campaign, as a speaker by the Republi
can State Committee, of which I was chairman.
Q.?"What political services, if any, did the
prisoner render to the Republican party during
the last Presidential campaign ? A. None,
that I know of.
Q.?Was there ever anything, to your
knowledge, in his relations to yourself or to
General Grant, or to Senator Conkling, or to
any leaders of the Republican party, socially or
politically, furnishing a shadow of a reasonable
claim on his part for political preferment'?
A.?No.
Q.?Did you or not ever give him any reason
to think that he had, or could have, any
political or personal influence with you ? A.?
I never did. I have been requested by counsel
for the defense to produce a letter written by
the prisoner and enclosed to me by his counsel
since his indictment. That letter was received
by me in the month of October last and not
preserved. I do not remember its contents,
particularly, excepting that it contained some
claim to have rendered important service to
the Republican party in the Presidential campaign
and an appeal for a postponement of
his trial to give him time to prepare his defense.
On the 9th, the attendance of spectators in the
Court room was greater than for several days.
During the examination of Dr. McArthur, for

of the prisoner, while on the point of the
prisoner's past moral character, and touching
offenses against the law of which Guitean was
charged with being guilty, Sir. Scoville addressed
the court and objected to the character
of evidence given by the witness, on the ground
that the evidence to any other crimes could
not be introduced here when the prisoner is
on trial for this particular offense. He desired
that all such evidence should be stricken out.
The Court ruled that evidence could l>e admitted
to show the general character of the
prisoner. Witness then testilied as to the interviews
with the prisoner and said that he
never saw any indications of insanity in the
prisoner
Several other witnesses were examined, all
of whom testified to the same effect as Dr. McArthur,
viz. : that the prisoner's "disease" is
more of the nature of moral depravity than
insanity, and the Court then took the usual
recess.
After recess several more witnesses testified
to transactions more or less disreputable in
Guiteau's past life, and the prisoner abused
them all, calling them liars and every abusive
epithet he could think of. Several insurance
policies were put in evidence, in which Guiteau
asserted there was no insanity in his family.
Guiteau poured out such a torrent of abuse
upon the witnesses that there was'difficulty in
conducting the proceedings. Court adjourned
until Monday.
Dr. Spitska, the celebrated insanity expert
of New York, who dodged both the Government
and the defense as a witness in the Guiteau
trial, but was finally captured by the latter,
and compelled to come, made a close examination
of Guiteau in his cell last Sunday
and, as the result, declares that he can visit
any lunatic asylum in the country and find a
dozen patients less insane than Guiteau is.
This testimony will be very valuable to the defense.
Mr. Scoville claims that the testimony
of Dr. McArthur, which told so horribly
against Guiteau, was manufactured, and that
he will demonstrate it before the close of the
trial.
Dr. Spitzka was examined on Monday, his
examination continuing .through the day, and
remaining unfinished when Court adjourned.
He testified to the belief that Guiteau was
born insane. During the proceedings on Monday,
some one in the crowd shouted, "Shoot
him now!" which caused great excitement,
but the person offering the suggestion could
not be found, and the excitement subsided.
Warden Crocker has received several anonymous
communications leading to the suspicion
that an attempt may be made to blow up with
dynamite the wing of the prison in which Gui
reau is connneu.
THE COTTON CROP.
The following is the New Orleans Cotton
Exchange report for the month of November,
based upon replies received up to the 9th instant
: ..
Louisiana.?Seventy two replies from 32
parishes 011 average date of November 30.

it was very wet and unfavorable. A fair prospect
for a top crop was destroyed by frost and
worms with few exceptions. Picking will be
generally finished by December 1st. The yield
is 20 per cent, less than last year, which indicates
a decrease of 8 per cent, since the report
last month. 08 per cent of the crop has been

FIRE I.N CHESTER.
About 12 o'clock M., on Saturday last, the
depot of the Chester and Lenoiy Railroad at
Chester was discovered to be on fire, the fire
supposed to have originated by a spark from a
locomotive communicating with cotton on the
platform. There were 167 bales on the platform
at thetime, of which only37 were saved
uninjured. Ten or fifteen bales were saved in
a damaged condition, and all the remainder,
with the building and contents, were destroyed.
The loss in depot building, safe, oilice furniture,
scales and cotton platforms, will amount
to about $1,500. The loss in merchandise
freights in the depot will probably amount to
$1,200. The exact amount of insurance cannot
now be ascertained, but it is thought the
loss to the railroad will not exceed $3,000.
GRAND JURY COMiMlTTEE'S REPORT.
At the last term of the Court of General
Sessions, the grand jury, in their final presentment,
reported to the Court theAimpracticability
of their making a proper examination of
the books and accounts of the several trial
* * t* it- - n L A ?
justices, during tne session 01 cue ouuil. im
order was passed by the Court providing a
committee of the jury, and an expert for them,
to make the examination after the adjournment
of the Court. On the 8th instant, the
committee filed the following report:
SOUTH CAROLINA-YORK COUNTY.
COURT OF GENERAL SESSIONS.
To the Honorable, the Presiding Judge of said
Court: The undersigned, the committee of the
grand jury, acting under the order of the Court,
met on the 15th day of November, 1881, (the day
fixed by the Foreman,) and with the aid of the
expert furnished them, who submitted the result
of the examination he had mode of the books of
the several trial justices, proceeded themselves to
examine the said books, and also the accounh
presented by the trial justices to the county commissioners.
The committee present to the Court, for such
consideration and action as to the Court may seerr
proper, the following matters, as the result of
their labors, taking the several trial justices seriatim,
to wit:
James S. Lewis, Yorkville.?We find ninetyone
cases entered on the criminal docket of this
trial justice since the 1st of January last. Of these,
twenty-one cases were compromised or withdrawn
without costs to the county; eighteen were
sent up to this Court; in fifteen, bonds to keep
the peace were taken ; in thirteen, verdicts of "not
guilty" were rendered; nineareopen?no entries
as to their disposition ; in seven, verdicts of "guilty"
were rendered ; in three, recognizances and
releases onlj' were taken and issued ; in two, defendants
were committed, in default of peace
bonds; in one, the defendantJlcd; in one, a commitment
only was issued ; and in one, there was
a mistrial. The fines entered aggregate twentyone
dollars. The treasurer informs us that twenty-six
dollars have been paid over to him since
the first of January last. The charges made we
find correct, with this exception, (if our view of
the law be correct,) he charges $1.25 for "summons
for jurors."
S. M. Fewell, Rock Hill.?Thirty-four cases
have been entered on the criminal docket of this
trial justice since the 1st day of January last. Of
these, verdicts of "guilty" wore rendered in four
teen ; nine were sent up iu mis umn j m seven,
verdicts of "not guilty" were rendered ; iu one,
a bond to keep the peace was taken ; in one, notices
were issued tfl parties living in a state of
adultery; in one, a mistrial was had ; and one
was withdrawn, with the consent of the Solicitor.
The tines entered since the 1st day of November,
1880, aggregate forty-six dollars, of which forty
dollars only have been paid over to the treasurer.
In the case of the "State vs. Mat. Rainey," this
trial justice charged two dollars for a search warrant,'and
his constable two dollars for making the
search. Are these charges correct? This trial
justice has also collected onedollar and fifty cents
each for seventeen trials; one dollar and twentysix
cents six times, one dollar and twenty cents
I twice, and sixty cents four times, for "summons
for jurors;" forty cents eleven times, and fifty
| cents three tiuies, for commitments. Are these
charges correct?
T. G. Culp, Fort Mill.?Thirty one cases have
been entered on the criminal docket of this trial
justice since the 6th day of February last. Of
these, in ten verdicts of "guilty," and in three
verdicts of "not guilty," were rendered. Six were
compromised without costs to the county; four
were sent up to this Court; in four, peace bonds
were taken ; and four are open?no entries as to
to the disposition. The fines entered aggregate
forty dollars, of which thirty-eight dollars have
been paid over to the treasurer. The two last
tines of one dollar each were entered August
25tli, and September 1st, respectivel}'. We iind
several charges incorrect, though they were paid
by the defendants and not by the county. We
are entirely satisfied that the charges were so
made through want of familiarty with the fees
allowed bylaw. This trial justice entered upon
the discharge of the duties of the office about a
year ago. The erroneous charges are all made in
cases brought before him shortly after ho assumed
the office. In the case of the "State vs. B. M.
Ferris" the costs seem to have been paid in full, J
though the defendant was found "not guilty."
W. P. Good, Yorkville.?Twenty-seven cases
havo been entered on the criminal docket of this
trial justice since the 16th day of May last. Disposition
: "Guilty," niue; "notguilty," fourteen;
peace bonds, three; and "sent up," one. Charges
correct, except the charge of $1.26 for "summons
forjurors"?which is correct or not, as the court
may hold the law.
A. L. Nunxeky, near Smith's Turnout.?
Twenty-six cases have been entered on the criminal
docket of this trial justice since the 1st day of
January last. Of these, verdicts of "not guilty"
wore rendered in nine, and "guilty" in three;
in four, defendants Jlcd ; in three, entries of tiol.
pros, were made; in two, prosecutor defaulted;
two were sent up to this Court; in one, defendant
escaped; in one, a witness was bound over
to this Court; and in one, party was bound to
appear before trial justice Fewell. In the case
! of the "State vs. Alex. Marion," this trial jusj
tice charged, and collected of the county, one
i dollar for trial, though the case is one of those
in which nol. pros, is entered. In the case of the
"State vs. Alex. Smith," this trial justice collected
the costs of the county, though the entry, as to
disposition of the ease, is : "Aro/ pros, entered?
defendant promising to pay cost." The tine of
one dollar imposed on Hector Love, July 8, 1S81,
has not been paid to the treasurer. In the case
of the ".State vs. Geo. Lee," the entry on the
docket is "guilty," and the sentence "to pay all
costs." In the accounts presented, this case is
marked, "not guilty," and the costs?$'2.40?collected
of the county.
W. D. Camp, Black's Station.?Twenty cases
have been en the criminal docket of this trial justice,
since the 1st day of January last. In two of
them, this trial justice collects live dollars each,
as for "proceedingsin bastardy," from the county.
Those charges are not correct: He 1ms paid over
ten dollars for fines entered. We also find an entry
of twenty-live dollars as a fine against Charley
Canada, which it docs not seem the trial lustice
over received. Why? He can, doubtless, ex-,
plain. Other charges are correct.
S. L. Davidson, Bullock's Creek.?Seventeen
cases have been entered on the criminal docket of
this trial justice since the 1st day of January last.
Disposition: Withdrawn, without costs to the
county, seven; guilty, three ; open, (no entries),
three; not guilty, two: and took bunds to keep
the peace, two, Fines, thirteen dollars, which
have been paid over to the treasurer. All charges
correct, except one?twenty-live cents, instead of
twenty cents?for a commitment.
G. C. Lkkch. Hickorv Grove.?Sixteen cases
have been entered on thecriminal docket of this
trial justice since the 1st day of January last.
Disposition : Not guilty, six ; guilty, live; sent up,
two; coin promised, one; and a lunatic, one.
(The disposition of one eutry has been omitted
herefrom, through oversight.) Charges on book
are all correct. On account presented, we find
two items : In "Stato vs. Jerry Moss," $1.50,
"subpoenas for jury;" and in "State vs. Nancy
Jackson," 81.50, "jury tickets." We suppose
those items may represent sums paid to the jury.
D. M. Wallace, Bethel.?Eight cases are entered
on the books of this trial justice, since the
1st day of January last. Disposition: Not guilty,
four; and guilty, four. Charges on books are all
correct, so far as the county is concerned, except
one charge of twenty-tive cents, instead of twenty
cents, lbr a commitment. In two of the cases,
being "proceedings in bastardy," the defendants
gave bond, and the trial justice collected of each
live dollars as his costs. Though the committee
have no sjunpathy for the defendants, duty bids
them to present the charges as incoirect. The
book of this trial justice has been very nicely and
neatly kept. In presenting bis account to the
county commissioners, he only drew fifty per
centum thereof, which was error against himself.
We find one or two improper charges in the a'ccount.
Still he has received less than the sum to
which he is justly entitled.
W. J. White, Coates' Tavern.?Seven cases
have been entered on the criminal docket of this
trial justice since February 5, 1881. Disposition :
Guilty, four; not guilty, two ; sent up, one. In
five of the cases the trial justice entered a charge
of two dollars for trial, and in four a charge of
aixty cents for issuing summons for the jurors.
He also enters, sixteen times, a charge of fifty
cents for "witness," which entry we do not understand.
The fines imposed aggregate fifteen
dollars, no part of which has been paid over to
the treasurer. The account presented to the
county commissioners, as against the county, has
not yet been audited or paid, and the commissioners
have been notified not to pay the same. In
it, the trial justice gives the county "credit" lor
the fifteen dollars, amount of fines; but his account,
when properly made out, will not amount
to that sum. This" plan of giving the county
"credit" has r.ot.as we understand it, the sanction
of the law.
R. T. Gillespie, Clay Hill.?Five <;ases have
been entered on the criminal docket of this trial
justice since the 1st day of January last. Disposition
: Dismissed, three; guilty, one; not guilty,
one. Charges all correct.
Z. D. Smith, Zadok.?Three cases have been
entered on the criminal docket of this trial justice
since the 1st day of January last. His book
was very nicely and neatly kept, and showed but
one erroneous charge?twenty-live cents, instead
of twenty cents?for a commitment.
After completing the examination of the books
and accounts of the trial justices, the committee,
in the afternoon of the same day, adjourned, subject
to the call of the Foreman.
Respectfully submitted.

In the House, the session was devoted almost
exclusively to the work of clearing the
calendar, and a large number of bills only of
local significance were read the third time.
The militia bill came up on its second reading,
and the first twelve sections of the bill
were read without amendment. The thirteenth
section, which provides for the continued
employment of a State armorer and night
watchman at a joint salary of ?400 a year was
stricken out, and the Adjutant-General is left
to take care of the State property in his office
as best lie can. The seventeenth section,
which provides for the appointment of ten
aides by the Governor, was amended, so as to
leave it discretionary with the Governor as to
the number of aides he should appoint. Section
thirty-four, which provides for the levy
of a tax of one-tenth of one mill on all taxable
property of the State outside the city of
Charleston, which is elsewhere provided for,
the proceeds from which shall be distributed
in counties where the taxes are paid, for the
purpose of improving the efficiency of the volunteer
troops of the State, one tenth of the
amount raised to be given to the National
Guard in sucli counties where this organization
exists. Mr. Murrray moved that this
section be stricken out. Mr. McCrady spoke
in favor of the section, and after a debate, in
which other members participated, for and
against, the motion was lost by a vote of 37
yeas to 50 nays.
The bill amending the General Statutes in
relation to the time in which actions may be
brought against executors and administrators,
passed its third reading.

liens excepting landlord and labor liens.
The majority report is unfavorable to the pro]K)sed
repeal and the minority report favorable,
Ordered for consideration next day.
The bill to establish a general stock law, and
also a large number of other bills of local nature,
were received from the House and appropriately
referred.
Mr. Witherspoon introduced a bill to charter
the Charlotte, Anderson and Atlanta Railroad
Company. Also, a joint resolution authorizing
the county treasurer of York to pay
certain funds to certain school trustees. Also,
a petition for the relief of John L. "Watson,
for services as treasurer of York county.
In the House, after the conclusion of the
routine work, the special order?being the
Convention bill?was taken up; but on motion
of Mr. Simonton the consideration of the
bill was postponed until Monday.
The House then took up the election law,
the question being a motion by Mr. Parker to
strike out all of chapter 1, relating to registration,
except the first section. He called for
the yeas and nays, which resulted?yeas, 56;
nays, 50. Mr. Johnson then moved the postponement
of the bill until the 20th instant,
which, after considerable discussion, was
adopted.
The militia bill was then taken up, when
Mr. Jones, of York, moved to reconsider the
vote whereby the thirty-fourth section, providing
for the levy of a tax of one-tenth of
one mill for "the purpose of improving the
efficiency of the volunteer troops," &c., which
had been passed on the previous day. Mr.
Jones said he made the motion to reconsider,
but did so with no intent to diminish any
amount which should be thought proper to be
appropriated for encouraging and aiding the
volunteer system. He thought that as there
are counties where no volunteer organization
exists, it is unnecessary to levy a general tax
applicable to those counties, when the aid desired
could be secured by an appropriation.
He disclaimed any wish or purpose to diminish,
by one dollar, whatever was shown to be
necessary.
A vote was then taken, and the motion to
reconsider was adopted by ayes, 54 ; nays, 47.
Mr. Jones then moved to strike out the section.
Mr. Johnson spoke in favor of retain
ing the section. Mr. iJiacK, 01 i one, reyiieu
to Mr. Johnson, showing that the scheme of
the bill in antecedent sections provides that the
militia organization of the State shall consist
of the volunteer troops and National Guards ;
and that the number of existing volunteer
troops and National Guards shall not be increased,
and therefore, there could be no reason
to raise a fund by taxation from every man
in the State for purposes, which, under the
very letter of the Act itself, it could not be
m;ule to apply. lie also thought it an unnecessary
burden on the people in the counties
where military organizations do not exist, to
levy this tax. Mr. Murray also spoke in favor
of striking out the section. The motion to
strike out the section was then voted on, and
was agreed to, being a reversal of the judgment
of the House on the same subject the
pveceding day.
Section forty-six was then stricken out, to
conform to the action on section thirty-four.
On motion of Mr. Simpson, the power of
imprisonment for offenses against the Act was
stricken out of section 79.
Mr. Simpson offered a substitute for section
thirty-four, which was adopted. It provides
that all appropriations made for the benefit of
the State militia shall be distributed among
the counties in proportion to their representation
in the nouse of Representatives ; and
provided that in the case of counties where no
? mi Avict fhaf-. t.hft fund
Ill J1 i til Vy Ul^itiii/xltiUiio i/aiwvj viiw? - .
shall be under the control of the AdjutantGeneral.
In the evening session, after a number of
bills of a private or local nature were read a
third time and ordered to be sent to the Senate,
the special order, being a bill to revise
the General Statutes, was taken up, and the
reading thereof resumed at section 934 and
continued to section 1,072. The only material
amendment made was section 1,071, pertaining
to the road law, which was amended so as
to make the ages between which persons shall
be liable to road duty from 10 to 50, in all the
counties; and section 1,072 was amended so
as to exempt from road duty "teachers and
students of schools and colleges, ministers of
the gospel, millers who are employed on merchant
mills working at least six days in the
week, and the warner for five days."

for subsequent days.
Other bills acted upon are not of general
importance.
In the House, Mr. Alexander offered a
concurrent resolution to take a recess on the
22nd of De cember and resume on the 17th of
January, which was amended to read "the
10th of January," and adopted.
The special order, being the general railroad
law, was discharged, and the bill for therepeal
of the lien law was taken up. A lengthy
discussion ensued, in which Mr. Black, of
Spartanburg, spoke in favor of the repeal.
Mr. Barber, of Chester, spoke against the
repeal of the law. He said it was urged by
a class of men who farm well on paper; but
when it comes to actual results, their work
ilnn't "nan nut.."
Mr. Marshall, who claimed to be a Granger,
also spoke against the repeal, and among other
arguments in favor of continuing the law,
he said that of the whole amount of liens given
in this State, about one-half were held by
tlit six counties of Darlington, Abbeville,
Barnwell, Sumter, Fairfield and Marlboro, the
very six counties which are shown to be in the
advance in agricultural and industrial progress
and prosperity in the State.
The debate was prolonged, without reaching
a conclusion, to the hour of adjournment.
The evening session was devoted to reading
the bill for the revision of the General Statutes.

incorporate the Cherokee Falls Manufacturing
Company, in York county.
The bill for the repeal of the lien law was
resumed, and after another lengthy discussion,
the motion to strike out the enacting words of
the bill, which had been made at a former
