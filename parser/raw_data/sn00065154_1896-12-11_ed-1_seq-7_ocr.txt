Chippewa Faltn, Wis.. Dec. 7.- Sight

Chippewa Falls for the purpose ol
viewing the immense gorge of ice that
has choked the rivet- and given this
town such prominence during the last

towns on the Central road between this
city and Med ford, and .Minneapolis and
St. Paul, few of whom appreciated the
full significance of the ice formation
in the bed of the river. Only streaks
of Jagged ice clinging to the fronts and

lifved by cifSe obsei'vers of 1 he situn
tion that the river will cause no fur
ther nppivhenisioii thiis winier. and the
more in.pel ui pretliet that tiie ice will
go out gradually, giving Hie stream a
clear course by spring. The supply of
anchor ice from above the city seems
inexhaustible. Tons ol' the slushy
stuff is still pouring over the dam. but
it must certainly be flowing with the
current beneath the gorge, as the ice
near the city remains unchanged.
Maj. Jones. 1*. S. A., left Chippewa
Fails to-day, stating as his opinion
that the danger of the flood is at an
end. Then* is a great deal of good
feeling iu the city at the happy ter
mination of affairs, and it is the gen
eral belief that the damage that has
been car sod property will be much
smaller than was at lirst apprehended.
It is impossible to get an estimate of
lhe cost ot' the Hood, but business men
generally refuse to give out any esti
mate of their losses. \o one. however,
has been so seriously affected that it
will invvent him from remaining in
business the same as fonm-rly.
