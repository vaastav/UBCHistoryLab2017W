The scribes on tho banks of a river
In Algeria have considerable induce
ment to write, as tho river is com

which runs through a peat swamp
containing much gallic aeld, and the
other through soil impregnated with
Iron, and when the two join pure ink
is formed.

Washington, Dee. 4. When J he sen
ate convened yesterday for the short
session of tho Fifty-sixth congress
it was within the shadow of the death
of two of its most distinguished mem
bers. The fall of Senator Krye's gavel
caused a huuh to fall over the cham
ber at 12 o'clock, and then Air. Mil
burn, the venerable blind chaplain, in
a beautiful prayer, paid touching
tribute to the deaths of Senators
Davis and dear.
Tho call of the roll disclosed the
presence of Gt senators and the sen
ate then proceeded to routine busi
ness. William J 5. Dillingham was sworn
in to fill the unexpired term of tho
late Justin S. Morrill.
Tho senate, on motion of Senator
Hale, then took a recess of 40 min
utes and on reassembling Senator
Hoar announced that the president
had expressed his pleasure that con
gress once more was in session and
that ho would communicate with it
forthwith. Instantly Maj. Pruden,
one of the secretaries of the president,
was recognized and presented the
awaited message of the president. It
took Mr. Dennett, tho secretary of
the senate, one hour and 50 minutes
to read it.
Senator Allison then announced the
death in July last of his colleague,
Senator John Henry Clear, and of
fered the usual resolution of sorrow,
which was adopted.
Senator Nelson, of Minnesota, who
had returned only two hours before
from St. Paul, announced formally
tho death of Senator Davis, saying
that in his death "the nation has lost
one of its wisest public servants and
the state of Minnesota one of its dis
tlngulshd sons."
Tho senate then at 3:15, on motion
of Senator Allison, as an additional
mark of respect for the memories of
Senator Gear and Senator Davis, ad
journed. 'I'hr I'tticomllnca In din Ifnnno.
Washington, Dee. 4. Tho opening
of tlie session in the house yesterday
was brilliant, but not exciting. There
were the usual throngs in the galleries
and the usual display of floral pieces
on the floor, but the proceedings were
purely formal, consisting of tho
rapping to order by tho speaker,
prayer by tho chaplain, tho roll call
of members, tho appointment of the
formal committees to wait on the
president and the reception and read
ing of tho president's message. De
spite tho fact that a great presiden
tial campaign had concluded within a
month tho bejjt of feeling seemed to
provnll between victors and van
quished. The reading of the message,
which naturally was tho feature of
the day, occupied over two hours. It
was listened to with respectful inter
est by both sides.
When Speaker Henderson called the
house to order at noon the desks of
half tho members were freighted
with flowers from admiring friends
of constituents. Then the blind
chnplaiu delivered a prayer. In his
invocation the chaplain referred feel
ing to tlio deaths of the late lleprc
sentatlves Daly, of New Jersey, and
HoiTccker, of Delaware, whleh oc
curred during the recess.
Messrs. Payne (rep., N. Y.), Oros
venor (rep., O.) and lUehardson (deiu.,
Tenn.) were appointed to join tho
committee of tlio senate to notify
tho president that congress was In
session and ready to receive any com
munication from him. The clerk also
was directed by resolution to notify
the senate that the house was ready
to do business. After the adoption
of these formal resolutions tho house,
at one o'clock, took a recess until two
o'clock, 'when tho president's message
Mas laid before the house. Its reading
was listened to attentively.
Tlio deaths of tho late JJepresentn
tlvo lIolYockor, of Delaware; the late
Representative Daly, of New Jersey;
the late Senator Gear, of Towa, and
tlio late Senator Davis, of Minnesota,
were then announced and after the
adoption of resolutions of regret the
house as a further mark of respect
to the memory of the deceased states
men at 4:20 p. in. adjourned.

THE WAR DEPARTMENT.
Sncretnry ICool'n Anntinl ltoport Toucliai
Upon Many Iiitcrnntlni; Topic, Includ
ing Work In Our Nnw Territory,
Washington, Dec. 4. Tho annual
report of Secretary Hoot is of more
than usual interest owing to its wide
scope and tho fact that it treats of
subjects of such importance as the
Philippine insurrection, the Chinese
campaign, tho developments in Cuba
and Porto Hleo and finally, with the
subject of army reorganization.
The chapter of the report treating
of military operations in tho Phil
ippines is n recital of the features
of tho campaigns that were con
ducted in tlio islands during the pnst
year. It is said that the purpose was
to pursue the small bands of Filipinos
scattered throughout tho islands.
The ofTort was successful and re
sulted in the further and practically
complete disintegration of the insur
rectionary bands; in tho rescue of
nenrly all tho American nnd Spanish
prisoners; in the capture of many of
tho leading insurgents and the de
struction of large quantities of arms
and supplies. Secretary Hoot says
that with tho execution of tho mili
tary plans there, all formal nnd open
resistance to American authority in
tlio Philippines terminated, leaving
only nn exceedingly vexatious and an
noying guerrilla warfare, of a charac
ter closely approaching brigandage,
which will require time, patience and
good judgment to finally suppress.
Touching Cuba the report says that
tho conduct of tiff airs there during
the year lias been a continunnce of
the process of aiding the Cuban peo
ple In the development of the Cuban
government In such a way that, when
fully organized, it shall bo stable and
ellleient. This has been done by
guiding the Cubans in the, iirst steps
of systematic self-government, and by
introducing, mainly through Cuban
ofllcers, such reforms in administra
tion as shall servo to put the busi
ness of government in fairly good con
dition when a complete Cuban ad
ministration ilnully assumes control
of the government of the island.
Tn Porto Hleo, where tho army con
trolled up to the first of May, its
principal function was the improve
ment of the civil administration, ac
customing the people to the exercise
of the lowers of government and con
tinuing; the work of relief made neces
sary by the deplorable condition in
which the island had been left by the
great hurricane. The secretary ac
cepts as his own Gen. Davis' state
ment as to tho creditable way in
which the army discharged the trust
committed to it in Porto Rico, and
ho ndds an expression of grateful ap
preciation of tho devotion, judgment,
good temper and ability exhibited' by
Gen. Davis.

OLDEST MMffl AMERICA
Tells How He Escaped the:
Terrors of Many Winters
by Using Peruna.
Mr. Isaac Ilrock, tho Oldest Man In tho
United States,
Mr. Isaac Brock, of McLennan county,,
Tex., has attained the great age of 111 years,,
having been born in 178S. lie is an ardent
friend to Peruna and speaks of it in the
following terms:
"During my long life I have known a.
great many remedies for coughs, colds, ca
tarrh and diarrhoea. I had always supposed .
these affections to be different diseases, hut
I have learned from Dr. Hartman's books
that these affections are the same and are '
properly called catarrh.
"As for Dr. Hartman's remedy, Peruna,
I have found It to bo the best, if not the
only reliable remedy for these affections.
"Peruna has been my stand-by for
many yearm, and I attribute my good
health and my extreme age to thlm
remedy. It exactly meets all my,
requirements.
"I have come to rely upon it almost en
tirely for the many little things for which I
need medicine. I believe it to be especially
valuable to old people." Issac Rrock.
