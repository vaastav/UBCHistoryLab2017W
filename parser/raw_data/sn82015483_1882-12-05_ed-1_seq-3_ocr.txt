Btr Frederick E Ives, Brown, from New York.
The sch Eva M Lewis, reported arrived in yester
day's paper, did not arrive.
There was a steam barge got aground on the east
bank of the channel this afternoon.
A vessel was seen to strike about 3 o'clock this
morning on the outer bar. The crew of the life sta
tion immediately launched tbelr boat. A tremendous
sea was running and the boat was twice capsized in
tht surf. A third attempt took it out a short distance
when a heavy sea struck it and it was again overturn
ed, throwing the crew into the surf. The boat was
again righted and the crew were taken off and safely
landed. The stranded vessel proved to be the schr
Oliver Amss, of Taunton, Capt. Babbitt, from Gard
ner, Maine, with ice for Baltimore. The mate of the
vessel was on deck at the time of the accident, and
says that they mistook Race Light for Highland's
Light, and changing their course accordingly the ac
oident occurred. The Ames lies in a dangerous posi
tion and will undoubtedly go to pieceB. The vessel
has been to this port once or twice with a load of ice
for Strong, Barnes, Hart & Co. She was a good
vessel.

THE NATIONAL CAPITAL.
The Tariff Commission's Report A Bill
Embodying Change, nt Duty Recom
mendations of the Commission Basi
ness At the Capital on the Opening
Day of the Session.
Washington, Dec. 4. The report of the
tariff commission recommends an average
reduction of duties, including that caused by
the enlargement of the free list, of from 20
to 25 per cent., the redaction in the case of
some articles being from 40 to 50 per cent.
The report says : "If the redaction reaches
the amount at which the commission has ar
rived, and if there is any truth in the allega
tion of the opponents of the present econ
omic system that the duty on artioles such as
are produced in this country, whether in
manufactures or agriculture, enhances the
price to consumers not only of what is im
ported, but of the whole domestic production
to . an amount of which the duty is
a measure, then the commission thinks
that the reduction proposed will benefit
consumers to the extent of hundreds of mil
lions dollar." The report is accompanied
by a voluminous bill embodying the recom
mendations on which the Ways and Means
committee will have a meeting this week.
The principal articles on the proposed duty
list with the amounts of tariff recommended
are as follows : Iron in pigs, wrought and

NEW YORK.
laiigtry OH' for Boston A. Q,narrcl with
Her Friend Labonchere,
New York, Dec. 4. The departure of Mrs.
LaDgtry for Boston, unaccompanied by Mrs.
Labouchere, and a difference perhaps amount
ing to a quarrel between the ladies thus indi
cated, formed a subject for gossip and con
versation in theatrical circles to-day. The
opinion generally held was that Mrs. Labou
chere had attempted to dictate to Mrs. Lang-
try regarding her acquaintances and Mrs.
Langtry resented the attempt. A statement
attributed to. Mrs. Ijabouchere, that Mrs.
Langtry had formed acquaintances which
seemed to her (Mrs. Labouchere) detrimental
to the actress1 success, attracted special at
tention. It was not believed, however, that
the trouble denoted so serious a complication
this statement would seem to indicate.
Among stockbrokers, Wall street men and
men about town the statement of Mrs. La
bouchere that Mrs. Langtry intended toacon
tinue this objectionable acquaintance in Bos
ton was eagerly taken up, and reported de
partures for that center of culture were in
dustriously discussed. Young men who had
danced attendance on the beauty during her
stay here were mentioned, but most of them
were found last evening in their accustomed
places of resort and those who were not
had been - seen by friends during the day.
Outgoing trains for Boston were watched by
enterprising news gatherers. One gentleman
who has met MrsT Langtry frequently since
her arrival made his appearance in traveling
guise. He said he was going to Boston or
rather near Boston to attend a funeral.
So many different versions of the rupture between
Mrs. Langtrv and Mrs. Labouchere have been set
afloat that a reporter to-day endeavored to get at the
true inwardness of the matter. Mrs. Labonchere was
about to depart on a visit to friends in Richmond,
Va. She denied having bad any dispute with the
Jersey Lily, that she had intended accompanying
Mrs. Langtry to Boston, and on being pressed
admitted that the reason for refusing was that she
had occasion to remonstrate with Mrs. Langtry in re
gard to a cert tin unsatisfactory acquaintance she had
made during her stay In New York and which ap
peared more than likely to interfere with her future
success on the stage. Mrs. laDoucnere saw that
the warm friendship which had been
formed would be unpleasant to herself as a
friend and companion and informed Mrs.
Langtry that she could under so circumstances go
to Boston unless the acquaintance was brought to an
end. The beauty preferred to. keep her friend and go
to Boston alone, so Mrs. Labouchere was found
to-day packing her trunks alone in the city where
bath had been honored. She thought she would take
a look at Congress in Washington and after visiting
friends In Richmond return home to Knglsnd. Of
names of several gentlemen were mentioned by gos
sips to-day as to the objectionablo acquaintances was
Mr. uuuert, who made the acquaintance or Jure.
Langtry since her first appearance at Wallack'a and
afterwards praised her at the club. There are so
many conflicting statements that it is impossible to
ascertain definite facts.

Washington, Deo. i. The Postmaster
General in his annual report recommends the
abolition of postage on second class matter
and that the rate on fourth class be increased.
He approves the plan of selling stamped en
velopes at cost of the stamp and thinks the
revenue would be increased by this means.
He recommends the establishment of posta'
savings banks and a postal telegraph system.
He recommends postal rates for $5 and un
der, commends civil servioe in railway mail
division. He states that the Star service has
been handled by the Assistant Postmaster
General in a most gratifying manner and fa
vors the suggestion that first and second
class offices receive stationery through the
first assistant's office, that box rents be paid
direct to the government and that the gov
ernment rent all postoffices and not the post
masters, and that where practicable all post
office buildines be erected by the govern
ment and no buildings be rented or leased it
it can be avoided.
The annual renort of Attorney General Brewster
asks for $3260,000 to defray the expanses of the Uni
ted States courts during the next fiscal year; recom
mends a revision of the present scale of fees of Uni
ted States marshals ; asks an increased appropriation
for the investigation of accounts of marshals, dis
trict attorneys, etc. : recommend, the authorization
nf attorneys to annoint a substitute in several cases
and legislation better defining the powers of the au
thorities regaraing tne retention ana return ox pris
oners ; that the maximum compensation oi several
clerks of the United states courts shall be uniformly
the same, that the revised statutes be so amended
that all emolument retainers of distriot attorneys,
clerks and marshals shall hereafter 'be settled for the
fiscal years as other accounts are settled, that addi
tional legislation oe naa to protect executive civil oi
ficers of the government in the performance of their
duties, and also against outrages committed upon
them beosuse they have faithfully performed them.
The report states that since the last report there have
been brought In the court of claims 482 suits claim
ing $448,790.37, and the entire number of suits pend
ing against the United States is 718, claiming $27,501,
756 01.
The annual report of the Secretary of War shows
the expenses of the last fiscal year to be $45,349,319.01;
asks for $38,897,620 34 for the next liscil year, not in
cluding anything for rivers and harbors ; concurs in
General Sherman's recommendations that the stand
ing army be increased to 30,000 men, that the pay of
privates be increased to $16 a month to prevent de
sertion and some systematic plan be adopted for tbe
exchange of officers and men from one State to an
other. The report calls attention to the great neces
sity for a fireproof building suitable for the proper
accommodation of the army medical museum collec
tion and the library, which yearly grows more im
perative, as the present building is overorowded and
unsuitable for the purposes intended, while its gen
eral insecurity against aoeident and fire places in
extreme jeopardy collections which if destroyed
would be an irreparable loss not only to the United
States, but to the world. The Secretary concurs in
the view of Chief Engineer Wright that there has too
long been a nogleot of providing for the safety of
harbors and maritime cities, and Bupplles for navy
yards and arsenals in provision again.t the possi
bility of a foreign war. He also concurs in Chief
Wright's judgment respecting an increase of strength
of the engineer battalion to 620 men, and oommends
the bill reported from the Senate Committee on Mili
tary Affairs, and now on the calendar, providing for
a substantial increase of the appropriation to arm
and equip the militia of the several States, and con
surs with the recommendation of the chief Bignal offi
cer for a District organization sufficiently large
to nerform the work of the weather bureau.
and further reoommends that the weather bureau be
wholly separated from the army and from its appro
priations. He reoommends that the laws relating to
retirement ba amendedjeo as to avoid the dilllculty
that now exists under an opinion of the Attorney
General that as long as there are four hundred officers
on the retired list no officer can be placed on that
list, except one who belongs to one or the other of
the classes mentioned in the act of 1882. He also reo
ommends an amendment that would impose a penalty
of imprisonment upon Payne or others who may make
raids Into the Indian country.
The annual report of the Commissioner of Pensions
shows the number of pensioners on tha rolls at the
close of tbe fiscal year to have been 385,497, of whom
1 73,000 are invalids and 76,000 widows, orphans and
dependent relatives. The number added to the rolls
during the jear was 27,864 and the number dropped
11,446. The total sum paid for pensions during the
year was $54,000,000. The commissioner renews the
recommendation of his last report that any pension
er feeling that tha proper pension has not
been allowed him may by making arl application
within one year have his case reopened. He also
recommended a modification of the laws requiring
persons applying for pensions on account of the
death of relatives to show that they were dependent

Purchase of a Lot for the Normal Train
ing School.
The Board of Education made a purchase
yesterday of a lot for the Normal Training
school building which Is to be erected. The
lot is on the corner of Vernon street and
Congress avenue, and was purchased of Mr.
Bristol for $5,500. It is 137 feet by ISO feet,
and is considered a very eligible lot for the
object in view, both as to location and situ
ation. It is sewered, and a sidewalk pave
ment has recently been laid, the cost of
which will be paid by Mr. Bristol. The in
tention is to proceed at an early date with
the erection of the new building, with the
intention of opening it at the close of the
long vacation next summer. It will be an
eight-room building, partly for use as a
school for the chiMreu in that part of the
city, and partly 'for a training school for
teachers. When done the Fair street train
ing school will be given up, and there
will then bo, as now, two training
schools the one on Cedar street and
the new one. The committee on schools
and the committee on school buildines of
the Board of Education will soon have a
meeting to take steps for the erection of the
new building. A committee will visit several
cities to examine training schools with a view
to making the new one here unrivalled. It
designed to have a lecture room in tbe
new building for the use of teachers. There
are now about 30 teachers in training in this
city. The average number undergoing train
ing is from 25 to 30, and there are 150 teach
ers now in service in the public schools here
wno received their training at the city train
ing schools and many of them are considered
among tne best teachers.
Sots, of "Travel In Europe.
Kev. Dr. Hawes at the North church,
Elm and Temple streets, last evening, gave
the fourth of his series of talks on his recent
trip abroad. Venice and Milan and their
famous places and history were graphically
described. The ancient approach to the re
nowned city of Venice was contrasted with
the entrance now by railroad over the long
est bridge in the world. The grand canal
and the various winding canals and bridges,
which form the city's streets, were told of,
as well as the grand palaces, churches and
buildings forming the Square of St. Mark's.
The place of the Inquisition, the room of
torture and rayless gloomy dungeons, where
thousands of martyrs suffered such horrid
cruelties as we read of, were a part of the
story. The beautiful views of the surround
ing country, as seen from the Bridge of
Sighs, were alluded to as the last the ill-fated
prisoners saw when led to their doom. The
famous four bronze horses, the three im
mense granite pillars brought from Alexan
dria in Egypt, and their history, were men
tioned. The pictures, mosaics and statues
adorning the interior of the churches, each
wonderful enough for a separate lecture,
were described in a most interesting way.
The description of Milan, the Campanello
tower (ascended by means of inclined planes
instead of steps), the picture of the Last
Supper, by Vincio de Medici, as all the lec
ture, was of notable interest, occupying over
an hour in delivery.
