TUt TREA0DRT DEPARTMENT.
Washington, Doc 2. The report of Hugh
McCulloch, Secretary of the Treasury, was
submitted to the House of Representatives
yesterday. It is of great length, but, on sev
oral questions of vital Interest to the finan
cial and commercial world. It Is exceedingly
Interesting. From tno mass or figures sub
mitted It is learned that the total revenues of
the Government for the last fiscal year
were 1348,519,809, and that tho ex
penditures were f2U0,010,773, leaving a
surplus of f57,6U3,306, of which f 3 1,000,000 ha
boon appllod to bond redemption. The actual
and estimated revenue for the fiscal year
1854-5 Is 1330,000,000 and the estimated expendi
tures are 12,000,000. Of the revenues ex
pected during the ensuing year 1185,000,000
will come from customs taxes and 1115,000,000
from internal revenue. Tho Secretary esti
mates that the treasury surplus in 1884 will be
not less than f 50,000,000, and argues that some
thing should bo done to relieve the people of
mis unnecessary taxation.
Tho most lmioitaut chapter in the report
Is devoted to foreign trade and taxation.
After speaking of the remarkable changes in
the Western Htatcs and Territories and as
serting that "to the rise in the value of lands
resulting from the construction of railroads
the wonderful increase or tho National
wealth Is very largely attributable" ho says:
Tho condition of the manufacturinginterest
of the United states is similar in some respect
to the condition of the agricultural interest of
the West In vhe urly days. Vt hat tho Western
farmers then needed was a market for their
crops. V hat manufacturers now noed Is a
market for thoir surplus manufactures. Tho
real foundation of our grout manufacturing
Industry was laid in New England undor the
first tariff "of 1 protective character, which
diverted a part of Its capital from shipping
Into cotton factories. Those first constructed
having been fairly remunerative, more wore
constructed, and other branches of manu
facture wore undertaken, until New En
gland was converted from maritime and com
mercial pursuits Into manufacturing. It will
bo rocollocted that New Englund was opposed
to the first protective tart IT.
It was not many years after the first cotton
mills were erected In Now England that the
great iron Industries of the country began to
be developed, and Pennsylvania soon became
the great iron manufacturing State of the
Union. Nor was it long before various kinds
of manufactures came into existence in most
of the Northern and Western Stutos. Tho
demands of tlio Government during the la to
civil war for nearly all kinds of manu
factured goods and the high tariff greatly
stimulated production. After the war stimu
lus was found In railroad building and in ex
travagant expenditure Induced by super-
tomo wife nlTio" i ua ntfructurl ng "f nd u"f rylJr
the United States is in dire distress from
plethora of manufactured goods. Some man
ufacturing companies havo boon forced in
to bankruptcy; others have closed their
mills to escape it; few mills are run
ning on full time, and ns a consequence
a very large number of operatives are
either deprived of employment or are working
for wages hardly sutlicient to enable them to
live comfortably or even decently. Nor are
manufacturers and their employes the only
sutiercrs by the present depression or our
manufacturing industry. So largo and wide
spread has tliis industry become, so inter
woven Is It with other Industries, so essential
Is it to tho welfare of the wliolo country, that
It can not be seriously depressed without In
juriously affecting business throughout the
Union.
The all-Important question, therefore, that
presses Itself uKn tho public attention Is, how
shall the country bo relieved from the plethora
of manufactured goods, and how shall pletho
ra hereafter bo prevented? It is obvious
that our power to produco is much in excess
of the present or any probable future demand
for home consumption. The existing iron,
cotton and woolen mills, If employed at thoir
full capacity, could meet in six months per
haps in a shorter time the home demand for
a year. It Is certain, therefore, that unless
markets now practically closed against us are
ojenijnloss wo can share in the tradewhltnl
pression now so 6cverely7eirwiTrcontInue,
ana may oecomo more disastrous.
The question how shall our foreign trade bo
Increased is the question which now comes to
the front und demands prompt and careful
consideration. Manufacturers aro primarily
Interested, but the whole country has a stake
in its solution, in its investigation tho tariff
will necessarily bo Involved, inasmuch as tho
relations between it and our foreign trade are
so close that they can not bo considered
separately, but it need not be involved except
so far as It stands in tho way of interna
tional trado. If the duties upon raw materi
als aro an obstruction, those duties should be
removed. If the duties upon other articles
aro nn obstruction, they should bo modified.
Whatever may bo required to Increase our
foreign trado, whether it le a repeal or a mod
ification of existing duties, should be de
manded by tho manufacturers themselves.
How, then, shall tho Information required for
a full understanding of what stands in tho way
of uu increased exportation of our man
ufactured goods bo obtained? It may not bo
Iiroper for mo to offer advice on this point
nit 1 cun not forbear to say that I can see no
better means than by the appointment of a
commission, composed of men not wedded to
tho doctrine of trc trade or protection fair
minded men, who would prosecute tho inquiry
thoroughly, comprehensibly and impartially.
If such a commission should bo created, it
Should be don without noresmnry delny,
revolutionized " by steam-power and theli7fl
stitullonof machinery for hand-work. It is
this great revolution caused by steam-power
and machinery and their general use that will
inako tho labors of the commission arduous.
All the loading Nations of the world aro now
engHged in manufacturing, and all but Great
liritaiu are fencing themselves In by protect
ive duties. Among them tho United States
has been conspicuous. Has not tho time
come when a new departure is demanded?
Tho present condition of our foreign trado it
not as full understood by tho public as it
ought to bo, or there would bo greater un
easiness In regard to what may l tho result
Look, for Instance, at our trade relations
with Ilrazll. We sold to Urazil last year
various articles to tho amount of
64.r),al. We bought of her various
kinds of her own production to tho
amount of foO.STo.Kxit, leaving f41,tt,rt: ns
the balanco against us. Now, how is this
largo balanco liquidated ? Not by gold, but by
tho sale of our farm products, for which thore
is a largo demand In Europe, it is our cot
ton, our wheat, our petroleum, our beef and
pork, which can bo produced more cheaply in
tho United States than anywhero clso, which
creates the sterling exchange that cnalrfcs us
to carry out this one-sided trado with llru.il.
Now. if by the failure of our crops, or ver
favorable seasons on tho other side of tho At
lantic, or, what is more probable, by retalia
tion, our export of theso articles should ma
terially decline, what then would bo tho con
dition of our Brazilian trade? Instead of de
pending upon tho exports to Europe for the
means to cover the balanco in favor
of Brazil, ought not an effort be modo
to equallzo that trado by our manu
factured goods? Ought we not to endeavor
to verify the prediction of Cobden by becom
ing a competitor with Great Britain in the
Brazilian markets? Ought not this to be at
tempted ic the interest of our own manufact
urers? When tho renl condition of our foreign
trade and the character pf the competition in
which we must pooner or later engago aro
fully understood. It will be found that our In
ability to make that trade as free as our best
Interests r. "quire lies in the nocossity which
exists for heavy import duties, which, al
though they may bo levied for revenue only,
must bo In a largo degreo protective.
It is upon such taxes, therefore, that ous
Government must mainly rely for its large
current oxjienditure and tho reduction of the
National debt Largo revenues will be de
rived from the taxes upon whisky and tobac
co, if tlio tax on tho latter articlo should be
retained, but our chief revenue must lo de
rived from Import duties. To show how theso
dutiAsmaybo imposed and distributed ns to
neither Imperil our manufactures nor ob
struct our foreign trade, whllo tho Treasury
Is kept in an easy condition, will bo tho
task of the commission. That tho task will bo
a very difficult one Is certain, that It may bo
successfully porformcd ought to be certain
also.
In the commencement of Its work the com
mission should, 1 think, regard the following
points ns being settled :
1. That the public revenues are not to le In
excess of what may lie required for the sup
port of tho Government and the gradual re
duction of tho pulto debt.
t. That our manufactures, which under the
fostering care of tho Government have at
tained such gigantic proportlon9 "d whona
prosperity is essential to th welfare of all
other Interests, are not to be put In loopardjr
by rapid and sweeping changes In the tariff,
add that all reductions!'" import duties should
be modo with a view to their ultimate, advant
age by opening to them markets from which
they are now In a large degree excluded.
If such a commission as has been suggested
had been apioiuted, and Its work could be
Serformod at an early date, I should not be
isnosed to say anything bearing directly
upon tho tariff; but as relief from the pres
ent burden of taxation 1s urgontly and Jutly
demanded, I deem It my duty to suggest that
something In this direction should be done
without delay. Owing to the shortness of the
timo allowed to me for the consideration of the
subject, I am not prepared to name the articles
upon which duties should be remove or re
duced. 1 should regret this If Congress were
not already In possession of the iacta whlcb
should govern its action. This much, how
ever. It luiy be proper for me to recommend l
1. That the existing dutlus upon raw ma
terials which are to be used in manufacture
should be removed. This can be done la the
interest of ou r foreign trad e.
2. That the duties upon the articles used of
consumed by those which are the least able to
bear the burden of taxation should be re
duoed. Tliis also can be effected without
prejudice to our export trade.
lu regard to our Internal revenue taxes, I
have to say that, as theso taxes, with the ex
ception of the tax upon whisky, ought not to
be and will not be needed for revenue If ap
propriations are kept within reasonable
bounds and rigid economy is established in all
branches of the public service, 1 sea no good
reason for thoir continuance. Taxes upon
agricultural productions, although indirectly
levied, are Inconsistent with our general poli
cy, and tobacco Is the only one of these pro
ductions which has boon taxed. An article
which Is so generally used, and which adds so
much to the comfort of the large numbers of
our population who earn their living by man
ual labor, can not properly be considered a
luxury, and as the collection of the tax Is ex
pensive and troublesome to the Government,
and Is especially obnoxious and Irritative to
small manufacturers, the tax upon tobacco
should, In my Judgment be removed.
The tax upon whisky could not be repealed
without a disregard of public sentiment, nor
without creating a necessity for higher duties
upon imported goods, but while this is true
the tax upon the alcohol used In manufactur
ing might be removed with decided ben oil t to
home industry and foreign trade.
On the subject of our shipping interests
Secretary Mc'Jullooh urges the prompt re
moval of the unjust tariff taxes which have
driven American vessels from the soa and
Suralysed Bhlp building in this country, lie
oes not, however, consider the restoration
of our merchant marine an easy matter. We
have been out of the carrying trade so long
and foreign! companies have such enormous
capital invested that an attempt on the port
of the United States to gain supremacy on the
seas would meet with most vigorous compe
tition. On this point Mr. McCulloch says;
Thore is, in my opinion, no prospect whatev
er that the United States will ever share to a
considerable extent in the foreign carrying
trade without Government aid. It Is for Con
gress to determine whether this aid shall bo
granted or whether our foreign shipping in
terest snail remain in lta present aeatn-uite
condition. The let-alone policy has been tried
for many years, during which our ships havo
boon swept from the ocean, and we pay every
year many millions of dollars to foreign ship
owners for freights and faros. Ought this con
dition of things to be continued?
Entertaining these views, I do not hesitate
to express the opinion
1. That without Government aid to United
Stutes steamship lines the foreign carrying
trade will remain in the hands of foreigners.
2. That as wo ought to have an interest In the
business which we create, and as the restora
tion of our shipping interest Is lmportant.if not
essential, to the extension of ou r f orolirn trade.
subsidios in the form of liberal payments for
the transportation or mails or lu some other
form should be offered as an inducement to
investments of capital In steamships. The
amount of necessary aid would be lnsisrnin-
cant in comparison with what has been
granted to manufacturers by protective
duties, and nothing would be paid until the
services were rendered.
On the subject of the continued coinage and
unlimited legal-tender quality ox the silver dol
lur the Secretary says:
I have been forced to the conclusion that
unless both the coinage of silver dollars and
Ttiv I.. . mr I i.i m mm .lw.w amm-m wmj.bii uJ
there is danger that silver, and not gold, may
become our metallic standard. This dan
ger may not be imminent, but it is of so se
rious a character that there ought not
to be delay In providing against it Not only
would the National credit be seriously im
paired if the Government should be under the
necessity of using sliver dollars or certificates
In uavment of irold obligations, but business
of all kinds would be greatly disturbed; not
only so, but gold would at once cease to be a
circulating medium, and severe contraction
would be the result.
The United States is ono of the most power
ful of Nations its credit is high, its resources
limitless; but it can not prevent a deprecia
tion of silver unless its efforts are aided by
leading Nations of Europe The suspension
of its coinaire might depross the market price
of silver for a time, but the ultimate effect
would doubtless be to enhance it The pro
duction of gold is diminishing, that of silver
has practically reached Its maximum, and
there aro strong indications that from
this time the yield of both gold and
silver mines will speedily decline. At
the same time the demand for both for
coinage and in manufactures will Increase
Tho very necessities of the commercial world
will prevent a genoral and continued disuse of
cither as money, ine European nations
which hold largo amounts of silver must
sooner orlater come tojts rescue, andjthe
would To mucirtbTJrTng about ou their part
action in its favor. But whatever might be
the effect of the suspension of the oolnairo
upon the commercial value of silver, it is very
clear that tho coinage can not be continued
without detriment to the general buslnoss
and danger to the National credit
Tbo amount of one-dollar notes in circula
tlon is f-'0,7u3,O97.fl0; tho amount of two-dollar
notes in circulation Is f ai,778,TJ8.20. Congress
would, I think, act wisely in putting an end
fcj their circulation. Nor do I hesitate
to express the opinion that tho country
would bo benefitted If all five-dollar
notes should be gradually retired and the
coinage of hair and quarter eagles should be
increased. If this should bo done, the circulat
ing medium of tho United States below ten
dollars would bo silver and gold, and we
should be following the example of France, In
which there Is an Immense circulation of sil
ver coin, which In all domestic transactions
maintains a parity with gold. In this event
also, the Treasury would lo relieved from the
burdqn of silver In its vaults, und It would not
be long ieforo the coinage of sliver might be
resumed.
In conclusion, the Secretary recommends
that immediate action be taken by Congross
relative to tho basis or National bans circu
lation, now seriously thro it e nod by the rapid
call for boud-i on which it is based, and that
tho system be continued substantially as it
now Is, except that the tax on circulation

office of Uriah Hill, on Broadway street, W.
L H. Burns, the father of Zora Burns,
passed by and saw him there He went by
the window, and, turning toward the door,
drew a large revolver from his pocket
and ' fired at Carpenter. The bullet
struck the Iron door-post and glanced Off,
doing no harm. Burns did not wait to see
the effect of his shot, but walked quietly on
arovnd the square and went borne. On the
way he met a man named Prlmm and said
to him: "Well, I have killed Carpenter."
Burns has not been arrested. It Is thought
the old man's mind has been unbalanced by
his trouble. Carpenter was very much

iECKETABT CIIAXM.EIl's REPORT.
WAsinjtGTOJf, Deo, 6.The annual re
tort of tho Secretary of the Nary was made
public yesterday. Secretary cnanuier says
three new ships havo been successruiiy
launched, arid it lias been shown that our
fcteel-makers can readily furnish excellent
material in large quantities, Its high quality
belli? assured by the tests adopted. The de
partment is confirmed In the opinion that
the criticisms advanced last year against
the new ships were of lltt'.e moment
or based upon theories at variance with the
progress of modern shlp-bulIdlng. Compar
isons of the speed of the new cruisers with
that of tlio creat trans-Atlantic racinff-
6teamers are unfair, because the latter at
tain their speed only by a sacrifice of the
qualities that are essential to a shlp-of-war.
They are unprotected, unwieldy, and enor
mous hi draft and dimensions in a number
of them the pressure for very liign
fsneed Is small, and the new cruisers could
overtake ninety-six per. cent of the mer
chant steamers of the world. . I ne rates oi
speed assigned to the new ships are based
on a very conservative calculation of their
probable performance, and they will un
doubtedly exceed the estimates; but the
first uuarmed cruisers of the new American
fleet are not intended for comparison in
speed witli the unprotected raciiisr ships of
enormous size, or m aeicnsive power wuu
the modern Iron-clads.
The department, in adopting the recom
mendation of the Advisory hoard for addi
tional new vessels, calls sjeclal attention to
the necessity for torpedo boats. In general
the Secretary recommends the construction
of seven modern cruisers annually for a
period of ten years. Such a plan, he says,
while conforming, to me conservative ae
mands of our National policy and affording
ample time for adopting every new device
In construction, would give the country, at
a moderate cost, a navy adequate to train
its officers and maintain its safety and
honor.
In regard to the existing navy Secretary
Chandler says:
It appears from the condition of the fleet
tnat at tne ena oi nitcen years me uniy cruis
Inar vessels in the present list remaining will
be three small iron vessels the Monocacy, the
Alert and the Ranger. The real explanation
of the disproportion between the expenditures
and the results accomplished in the naval ad
niinmreuuu is iv v rvuira in t.9 pvHof w
tempting at great cost to rehabilitate worn
out structures under the name of repairs,
ltepalr and construction in the absence
of a nxed limit are terms easily in
terchangeable, and the published state
ment of expenditures under tho
first name during many years shows that it Is
only too apt to mean the second. The bu
reaus are unrestricted in their expenditures
for repairs except by the gross amount of
their annual appropriations. The practice of
reconstructing vessels undor the name of re
pair Is only a pretext upon wh Ich our over
grown navy-yaad establishments could be
justified, and it appears that iustead of main
taining our yards for tho advantage and ben
efit of our ships, have dragged out a protract
ed existence for the bcnetlt of the yards.
Concerning the navy yards, the Secretary
holds that only two naval workshops should
be maintained on the Atlantic coast and
one on the Pacific The New London yard
should be restored to Connecticut and
League Island yard to Philadelphia. Tho
Boston yard should be sold or reduced in
size. Tho Pensacola and the Portsmouth
yards may be kept for naval stations. The
workshops would then be at New York,
Norfolk and Mare Island. These needed
certain improvements in their organization:
their management; second, the responsi
bility for the work must be more definitely
fixed.
The Gun-foundry Board was reconvened
In April to decide on full plans and esti
mates to carry out its recommendations. It
has obtained information that there are re
sponsible steel manufacturers in this coun
try who, although not provided at present
with the necessary plant, are willing to
construct the same and to make bids for
contracts with the Government for a supply
of 'material for the heaviest guns, If guar
anteed that orders of sufficient magnitude,
with a positive appropriation covering a
series of years, shall be made by Congress.
Secretary Chandler next details the facts
connected witli frauds in the Bureau of
Medicine and Surgery. The amount ot sus
pected vouchers is J 124,835, extending over
a period from 1870 to 1884. The Surgeon
General neglected to require the customary
evidence that the goods had been received.
The frauds were made easier by the fre
quent use of the .exigency clause, under
which the purchases are made without ad
.yertislng. the fiscal year endedjune 30,1si, were'
$17,292,601 The estimate for the ordinary
purposes and public work for the next fiscal
year is $17,860,658, and the estimates for
the increase of the navy, $15,071,572. Of
this latter sum about one-half will be need
ed for the coming fiscal year.
The Secretary comments severely upon
the existing practice of securing the solic
itation of persons possessed of political and
social influence in behalf of officers,
whether for the purpose of obtaining agree
able duty or of effecting the restoration, "by
legislation, of those who have been dis
missed for drunkenness or other miscon
duct, or for incapacity. He says that
such restorations demoralize the sev ice.
Public opinion should sternly condemn
all who have been guilty of miscon
duct as well as those who lend themselves
to efforts for the restoration of officers re
moved. In discussing this subject he refers
to the President's veto message on the FitJ
John Porter bill as "pointing out the un
constitutionally of sueh legislation, and as
showing that the Constitution has provided
an effectual barrier to any restoration by
legislation of particular officers."
In conclusion the Secretary dwells upon
the close connection between the improve
ment of the navy and the development of
the merchant marine, and shows that to
make the latter commensurate with trade,
the coast line, and number and wealth of
the commercial cities, It is necessary to have
great lines of ocean. steamships of high
speed and large capacity, carrying
the flag to the most distant lands,
and saving ;to tlio American people
the vast profits of tho carrying trade.
The only way to accomplish this result,
he says, Is through direct encouragement
given by the Government, either in the
form of bounties upon the construction or
by payment for carrying tho malls, so that
American capitalists will be Induced to em
bark in the business. The recent enactment
repealing the laws requiring all Amer
ican vessels arbitrarily to carry for
eign mails, ho says, should be supple
mented by a provision that the contracts
for carrying such mails in American line
steamers over all the principal ocean high
ways should be let for terms of years to the
lowest bidder, adequate compensation there
for to be paid by the Government upon the
same principle as that adopted In establish
ing the great National post-routes on land.
Drowned.
Bostow, Dec 6. A special! telegram
from Victoria, B. C, says: Five days
since it was) reported I that a three-ton
sloop, which left here with nineteen China
men, who were to be smuggled, and two
white men, for the American shore, had
been swamped and all hands lost.
In addition to this disaster two more white
men who left Foul Bay seven weeks ago in
a leaky boat with twelve Chinamen, for
Washington Territory, have not since been
heaid of, and all are bellved to be drowned.
The temptation to smuggle Chinamen
across the border is very strong, as for each
one landed the owners of the boat receive
twenty-five dollars.

when in some way one exploded and
ignited the whole lot. There was also
a quantity of gunpowder in tho house-
said to be two kegs. This also explod
