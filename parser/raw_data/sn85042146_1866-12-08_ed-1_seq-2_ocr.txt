- RALEIGH. If. C.
SATURDAY DECEMBER 8, 1866.'
Scene in the Hoase of Commons.
We refer to the proceedings for a sketch
of the scene in the House of Commons of
this State, yesterday.
Mr. Russ offered resolutions affirming the
loyalty of this State under its present organ
ization, which passed by a large majority.
j Much excitement revailed during the con
sideration of the- resolutions. Violent and
inflammatory speeches were made by Mr.
Crawford, of Rowan, and Mr. Russ, of W ake,
against the Unionists of this State, and
against any attempt that may be made to
supersede the present government of North-
Carolina.
Mr. Blair, of Randolph, offered an amend
ment to the effect that those Southern lead
ers" who " fired the Southern heart," and in
volved the country in war, ought not to be
allowed to vote or hold office. The majori
ty dodged this by refusing to order the yeas
and nays upon it.
Unionists were hissed in the Hall when
Mr. Blair offered his amendment, and when
the House refused to order the yeas and
nays.
Mr. Blair, Mr. Lyon, Mr. Blythe, Mr. Free
man, and indeed all those Unionists who vo
ted against the resolution, deserve the thanks
of every patriot for the firmness they dis
played on the occasion.
If any thing had been wanting to make
such action necessary, the scene in the House
on yesterday would have rendered it the im
perative duty of the Congress of the United
States at once to sweep the existing State
organization, with its disloj'al Legislature,
from existence. We declare, in the most
emphatic terms, that the Legislature of this
State in 1864, (during the rebellion,) was a
much more loyal body in sentiment than the
present one.
The Sentinel regrets that action has been
so long deferred by our Legislature on the
Howard amendment. We concur with that
paper in tins regret, ihere was no good
reason why the Legislature should not have
adopted it at once, unanimously.
The Sentinel adds, " We are ready to sur
render any personal or political feeling to
effect the great object of national tranquility
and Union." That is a very pretty expres
sion, hut unfortunately the facts do not sus.
tain the Editors in making it. The Sentinel
also adds:
But we never can vote for the enlarge
ment of the powers of the Federal Govern
ment, or the Congress and Executive, which
look to the destruction of the old government
as the Howard amendment proposes to do,
or the humiliation and degradation of our
own people. If they are to be disfranchised,
let others do it."
To nil which we have no particular objec
tion. It is very refreshing, however, to hear
the Sentinel and its triends praising " the old
government." Every one knows how they
love " the old government," and how they
hate the present one. They went out from
the old mansion five years ago, and labored
to the last moment to fire and destroy it.
Since they left, many changes have occurred.
They will condescend to return to it, if the
occupants will beg their pardon for having
left it and sought to destroy it, and if, in
addition, they will put every thing in the
mansion in the same condition it was
when they left. This is so kind and reason
able that any thing else would be "humili
ating and degrading ;" and "true Confede
rates," who scorned to "cowardly abandon
the cause of the South," will suffer any thing,
no matter how terrible or awful, before they
will obey any will but their own. Never
theless, they are as submissive as lambs, and
much more loyal than any other class in the
country. All other classes are common,
when compared with them. They are " the
best!"
Important Rumor. A report prevailed
on the streets and about the capitol, yester
day, that Hon. George W. Logan, a member
of the House of Commons, is now in Wash
ington City on business connected with tbe
reconstruction of this State. Progress.
This rumor is unfounded. Gen. Logan
is on a visit to his home in Rutherfordton,
on business which he felt obliged to attend
to. He will no doubt be in his scat again
in a few days.
Col. Forney, in a recent letter over the
signature of " Occasional," in his paper, the
Washington Chronicle, says :
" Congress is called upon to provide re
publican governments for all the States of
the Uuion ; and now that the recent rebels
have again defied the laws of the land, and
in the name of an aristocracy worse than
any on the face of the earth an aristocracy
that was supposed to have gonedown in the
field of battle insist upon ruling a country
they sought to ruin, there is but one course
left to those in whose hands the public lib
erties have been placed by the people. The
course was plainly indicated in the reply of
Speaker Colfax ; and he is an idiot, and
worse, who supposes that there is any human
power on this continent that will prevent the
completion of the work it imposes upon the
representatives of the people."
Mr. Wentworth offered a resolution in the
House of Representatives of the United
States, a day or two since, to the effect that
the many recent acts of disloyalty in the
Rebel States are additional reasons why they
should pass the Constitutional Amendment
before Congress can consider the propriety
of admitting them. It was passed by 119
to 32.
One of these recent acts of disloyalty in
North-Carolina was the election of Judge
Manly to the Senate. Another, was the dec
laration by Gov. Worth in his message that
Congress is an unconstitutional body.
Dental Association. We learn that the
N. C. Dental Association, Dr. B. F. Arring
ton presiding, has just closed a harmonious
and useful session in this Citv.
Mr. Crawford, of Rowan, very kindly pro
poses to "prepare a hell for W. W. Holden
and his friends." There is no necessity
for preparing such a place for the Commoner
from Rowan. It is already prepared, and
will give him, in due time, a warm recep
tion. It is thought the Legislature of thia State
will adjourn about the 20th of thi month.
TerfKorTlTiedveraBaet
The. following is the resolution of Mr.
BroomaU, of Pennsylvania, which passed the
House by a vote onuiwa. ?
lisxoUfA. That the Committee on Territo
ries be instructed tolnquire into the expedi
ency of reporting a bill providing Territorial
Governments for the several districts of coun
trv formerlv occupied by the once existing
States of Virginia. North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Ala
bama, Louisiana, ArKansas anct lexas, anu
crivinir to all adult male inhabitants born
within the limits of the United Suites, or
duly naturalized and not participants in the
late Rebellion, full equal political rights in
such Territorial Governments."
The " above is a test vote, which shows
that the House is not disposed to favor the
proposition for universal amnesty and uni
versal suffrage.
The Washinsrton correspondent of the N.
Y. Tribune says :
" It is the opinion of a prominent Senator,
who has had unusual opportunities ot ooser
vation, that at the present session of Con
gress an enabling act will be passed, reject
ing the present governmentsof the rebellious
States as nullities, and that the loyal people
ot those States, without respect to color, will
be authorized to choose delegates to consti
tutional conventions, and that the conven
tions will be required to submit the const!
tutous thus formed to a vote of the people
for approval or rejection. The Senator
makes these statements with so much earn
estness that little doubt can be entertained
of his source of informatian. He predicts
that the bill will very shortly be presented
lor action."
We predicted that the President's message
would disappoint the tire-eaters of the South.
Their organs bestow doubtful compliments
upon it, and some of them receive it with an
" unmistakable" sneer.
The Wilmington Dispatch says :
" As far as he goes he is very conservative, and
is disposed to do the South what he roirards as a
service secure for her the admission of repre
sentation, cut ne aoes not go iar enough by hall.
Indeed, we are forced to believe that he is either
insincere, or of weak intellect. He ouch) to tell
Congress that the test oath which it lias passed
ior i ue exclusion oi soumern men irotn omce is not
only unconstitutional, but an outrage on the couu
try. lie eituer Knows tnat this is so, or he is no
statesman ; and his opinion on any point of Con
stitutioual aw, in the last case, is utterly worth
less. If be knows that the test oath is uncousti
tutional, then he should say so like a man. and
not in all his public utterances avoid committing
nimsuii, line some miserable county cross road s
politician. He occupies a position in which he
may auoru to despise the arts ol demagotrism,
and should do so. If it is his purpose to be frank,
aud he does not believe that the test oath is un
constitutional, he should employ the services of
some one ot sumcicnt capacity to enlighten him
on that point. The letter of Gov. Graham, pub-
isiicu uuniij me last, iweive montns, might serve
to assist him in his research after the truth in re
gard to thi.-. question. Taking the message all in
mi, ii is a uisappoinimeni.
It is a little remarkable that the President
does not recommend in his late message, i
ne aid in ins message ot JJecemoer, leoo, a
modification of the test oath. Indeed, when
ue says, as lie uoes, tnat only " loyal mem
bers" of Congress should be admitted, and
ioruears at tne same time to repeat his re
f . . i . . ...
commendation that the oath be modified, he
impliedly endorses it. This is what vexes the
Dinpatch and others of that ilk.
The real feeling of the " Southern leaders"
towards the President, is shown in the cool
and conteinptous manner in which the Dis-
jtntch advises him to employ the services of
Mr. Graham. This is nearly as good in its
way as the opinion of Gov. Swain, that if
Mr. Graham and Mr. Perry had been admit
ted to scats in the Senate they would have
induced that body to adopt " a wiser scheme
ol adjustment" than any yet presented.

were only $75,383 less than the liabilities for
the mail service in that section. This is a
small deficit. Previously to the war the pos
tal service in many of the Southern States
was an expense to the government. The
postal service in the South ought to be in
creased. Dr. Ketser is a physician ot over thirty

Mr. H. T. Helmbold :
Dear Sir. In regard to the question ask
ed me as to my opinion about Buchu, I
would say that I have used and sold the ar
ticle in various forms for the past thirty
years. I do not think there is any form or
preparation of it I have not used or known
to be used, in the various diseases where such
medicate agent would be indicated. You
are aware, as well as myself, that it has been
extensively employed in the various diseases
of the bladder and kidneys, and the reputa
tion it has acquired, in my judgment, is war
ranted by the facts.
I have seen and used, as before stated, ev
ery form of Buchu the powdered leaves, the
simple decoction, tincture, fluid extracts,
and I am not cognizant of any preparation
of that plant at all equal to yours. Twelve
years' experience ought, I think, to give me
the right to judge of its merits, and without
prejudice or partiality I give yours prece
dence over all others. I do not value a thing
according to its bulk, if I did other Buchus
would out-do yours, but I hold to the doc
trine that bulk and quantity do not make up
value if they did a copper cent would be
worth more than a gold dollar.
I value your Buchu for its effect on pa
tients. I have cured with it, and seen cured
with it, more diseases of the bladder and
kidneys than I have ever seen cured with any
other Buchu, or any other proprietory com
pound of whatever name.
Respectfully yours, &c.

PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS.
In tbe Senate, on the 6th, the list of stand
ing committf es agreed upon by the Repub
licans in caucus, was adopted.
Mr. Sumner remains as chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs ; Wilson chair-;
man of the Committee on Military Affairs,
Grimes chairman of the Committee on Naval
Affairs, and Wade chairman of the Commit
tee on Territories. The three friends of the
President Doolittle, Dixion, and Cowan
have been deprived of the chairmanship of
the committees respectively of Indian Affairs,
Post-office, and Patents. There are no com
mittees now that are headed by friends of
the Administration.
Mr. Wade introduced a bill for admission
of Nebraska into the Union. It was ordered
to lie upon the table for the present.
The committees for the session were an
nounced. Mr. Williams offered a resolution directing
the joint Committee on Retrenchment to in
quire into the power of the President to re
store confiscated property, and if such power
exists, under what laws ; and also the right
of the Secretary of the Treasury to restore
lands without payment of taxes and costs
incurred under authority of the United Sl ates
laws. The resolution was adopted

power of the President was taken up.
Mr. Turnbull moved to refer to the com
mittee on the judiciary ; which motion Chan-
dler
earnestiy opposed, and called for the
ayes and noes some discussion ensued ;
during which Chandler made assertions and
charges respecting the use of the pardoning
power ; which called forth an emphatic de
nial from Mr. Dixon, who said that if the
charges which Chandler had made against
the president were true, they would render
him liable to impeachment. He then repea
ted his denial of any and al the charges laid
against him. After some further discussion
the bill was referred to the Judiciary Com
mittee. Mr. Summer offered a series of resolutions
declaring for reconstruction, the jurisdiction
ot Congiess over the whol - subject, the ille
gality of the existing governments in the
South, and the exclusion of those States with
such illegal governments from congressional
representation, and from voting on the con
stitutional anendments. They also declare
that it is the duty of Cong-ess to proceed
with the work ot reconstrution, and to this
end it niut assume jurisdiction over the
States lately in rebellion, except so far as
that jurisdiction may have been renounced,
and must recognize only the loyal States as
entitled to representation, and to vote on the
constitutional amendment. He said he
would not discuss the resolutions, but would
read a letter from a friend in Texas, showing
the importance of the matter, which he did,
and after finishing, made some characteris
tic remarks. The resolutions were ordered
to be printed. Mr. Morrill gave notice that
he woultl call up on Monday next the dis
trict of Columbia Negro Suffrage bill.
Iu the House, on the same day. Mr. Wil
liams read a lengthy written argument on
the bill reguiating appointments to, and re
movals from, office. He was very severe
upon the President, who he said had be
trayed his party and country. Several a
mendments to the bill were offered, and it
was made the special order for to-morrow.
A bill to protect the rights of action of
loyal citizens was passed. It provides tbat
where a citizen who has always been loyal
shall bring action to recover damages, it shall
not be defeated or any defence allowed by
virtue of the authority of the lute Confederate
States.
In the Senate, on the 6th, Mr. Trumbull
reported favorably from the Judiciary Com
mittee tbe bill ot the House, to repeal tha
amnesty power of the President, and asked

and lies over till next day.
3Ir. Wade called up a bill of last session
to regulate the selection of grand and petit
tines in the territory ot L tali, winch was

Mr. Poland gave notice that on Monday
he would call up the bankrupt bill.
It was ordered, on motion ot Mr. Sumner,

Upon motion, the Senate adjourned.
In the House, on motion of Mr. Wash-

same day each alternate year thereafter. Re

The House then adjourned.
Farther from Washington.
The House select committee to inquire in
to the New Orleans riots and the murder of
three Uunion soldiers in South Carolina, will
leave here next week forservice on these
investigations.
Congress will undoubtedly pass a bill pro
viding that every Congress ahall commence
on the 1st of December. The object is open
ly declared by the radicals to have in effect
a permanent Congress. There is to be no re
cess, but an adjournment : in such a case, ac
cording to this programme, there would be
no recess during which the president could
make appointments requiring the confirma
tion of the senate. According to the present
law no removals can be made during a ses
sion, until the successor of an incumbent
shall be confirmed.
After an extended discussion on an amend
ment ordering an election in all the States
on the 22d February next, and after provi
ding in the first section that Congress shall
meet on the 4th of March, the House at three
adjourned till Monday, when the bill again

on foreign affairs was instructed to inquire
as to tne measures necessary to secure the re
cognition by other nationalities of our natu
ralization laws. , . .
Mr. Schenck'a bill to fix the time for the
regular meeting of Congress came up as spe
cial order. Mr. Schenck explained and ad
vocated it. - ' - '
The Welcome to Congress
On Monday last Congress was welcomed
by a large concourse of citizens to the City
of Washington, U t: r:
The Southern Loyalists with representa
tives from every State except South-Carolina
were also present.
Judge Carter on behalf of the people de
livered the address of welcome.
Speaker Colfax replied. He said :
"But four months since we left this Capi
tol, and yet how crowded with events I The
bloody and wicked massacre at New Orleans,
the very- week after our adjournment, and
the extraordinary speech of the President at
St. Louis, palliating the guilt of the mur
derers, and charging its grave responsibility
on the Congress of the United States ; the
two great Philadelphia Conventions, one
memorable for the frank acknowledgement
that those who denounced Congress were
really arm-in-arm with the men who, tramp
ling on broken oaths, had sought to destroy
the nation's life ; and the other honored by
the presence of the faithful Loyalists, who,
when the storm of treason swept over their
States, refused to bow the knee to Baal ; the
expulsion from office of thousands, trusted
and commissioned by our martyred President,
to whom, more than any other equal number
of men, the present Administration was in
debted for the power it wielded their crime
being inflexible fidelity to the principles pro
fessed by the successful candidate for Vice
President in the canvass of 1864 the hun
dreds of speeches of the Presidential tour
throughout the land, and their republication
in millions of copies of all our prominent
presses, bringing the issues to the hearth
stone of every voter the magnificent re
sponse of the people, from ocean to ocean,
condemning the policy of which they had
heard so much, and attesting their unshaken
confidence in the Congress which had stood
so faithfully, so fearlessly, and so immova
bly, in the pathway of duty and of right
how rapidly have we been making history in
these past few months ! Thank God, in this
this land the people are the only rulers.
Every two years they resume their sovereign
ty, and at the ballot-box given to them by
the dead of the Revolution they make and
unmake Congress; they approve or condemn
Administrations; they speak their will;
they command, and Congresses and Presi
dents must obey.
We return, then, to these halls to carry
out and enforce this decision of the rulers of
the nation the people. No man can mis
understand their will. Four points have
been settled, by them beyond all controversy.
1. That the work of reconstruction must
be in the hands of those who have been the
friends, not the enemies of the nation ; that
it must be based on the granite of loyalty,
and not the quicksands of disloyalty ; and
that those whose wicked leadership and
guilty repudiation of solemn oaths plunged
a peaceful country into the bloody conflict of
civil war shall not be clothed with the power
io ieyisitie ior tue widows ana orpnans
the kith and kin of the men they have slain
in their attempt to slav the nation itself.
. That the promises of Abraham Lincoln.
in his immortal proclamation, tbat the tree
dom of our emancipated millions should be
maintained, must be fulfilled both in letter
and spirit, and guaranteed beyond any pow
er of abridgment in our supreme law : for
bidding interference by any unfriendly State
with the privileges and immunities of the
liberty granted bv the whole nation to all its
people.
3. That no persons snail be disfranchised
in this Republic on account of their race,
and vet have their numbers counted to con
fer increased political power on those dis
franchising them.
4. That the national debt, the cost of our
national existence, shall be forever sacred :
and that all debts or claims growing out of
the rebellion, or the breaking or fetters that
ended it, shall be forever held illegal or void.
And the people also declared as their de
sire and will that Congress should enforce
this decision of theirs by appropriate legisla
tion. But, on the contrary, these terms are
spurned and scornfully rejected by those who
control public opinion and wield political
power in the South ; and the recent election
of most conspicuous secessionists in North-
Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, &c., with the
hostile messages of their Governor's is their
defiant reply.
Rejecting the Constitutional amendment,
they show that they insist on representation
in Congress and the Electoral College, for all
the four millions ot their former slaves, thus
ascending to enlarged and increased law-making
power in consequence of the rebellion ;
while, at the same time, they not only dis
franchise them and refuse them the rights
and protection of citizenship, but by dis
graceful and oppressive laws, pretending to
regulate labor contracts, and to punish va
grancy, reduce those whom the nation made
free, to a subserviency and serfdom, but little,
if any better, than slavery itself.
Yet, while we cannot compel them to ap
prove the constitutional amendment, our du
ty to the nation, to justice, to liberty, and to
humanity is none the less. And, exponents
of the people's will as we are, we cannot
avoid that duty. Indeed, we may see in it
the finger of Providence. Like our fathers,
we have, in the past few years, buikled bet
ter than we knew. In the earlier stage of
the war, how willingly would an overwhelm
ing majority of the people have consented to
perpetual slavery in the Republic if South
ern traitors had taken from our lips the
bloody chalice of civil war, which they com
pelled us to drain to its very dregs ! But
God willed otherwise ; and at last, when ev
ery family altar had been crimsoned with
blood, and every cemetery and churchyard
crowded with patriot graves, the nation rose
to a higher plane of duty, and resolved in
these halls that slavery must die.
The question naturally arises, how can
this be done ? Surrounded by these able ju
rists and patriotic statesmen, returning here,
as they do, crowned with an unparalleled
popular endorsement, it might not be fitting
to anticipate their arguments on these vital
themes in the session just opening. But
when the Constitution declares in its open
ing sentence, that "all legislative powers
herein granted shall be vested in a Congress
of the United States" when it solemnly en
joins that " the United States shall guaranty
to every State in this Union a republican
form of government" and when it gives to
Congress full authority "to make all laws
which shall be necessary and proper for car
rying into execution all powers vested by
this Constitution in the Government of the
United States, or in any department or officer
thereof the duty and its exercise both
seem to have been specifically anticipated by
the framers of our supreme law."
Senator Yates of Illinois spoke as follows :
Mr. Yates, in continuation, said some allu
sion had been made to the question of the
admission of the Southern States. He had
been asked his views of this matter in Illi
nois, and when asked when he was willing
that the South should come in, he said he
was in no hurry. He would not be willing
until the right of free speech was recognized
on every foot of American soil from the At
lantic to the Pacific ; not until every man
can go into all portions of our country and
enjoy all its privileges ; not until constntion
al guarantees confer a lasting peace ; not so
long as skeletons of Northern men hang
dangling from limbs of trees in the South ;
until these things are changed, they shall
never come in until Gabriel blows his last
trump. Applause. He thought he par
tially understood his Democratic friends.and
in his State they were all for negro suffrage.
Ho believed in universal suffrage, and he
would say to his. Democratic friends that all
he wanted was a fair race. - He wanted the
same law for all men, and he thanked God
for this country and this government, which
paiieu mm on tne oacK and said he ha l
good a chance to rise in honor and din-
as anv one else in the country u , n"y
a fair race for honor in this
red
all are citizens, whether thpu n Si P1
uninrtw i
American, Chinese or African. It's fair 0r
and a fair fight ; and he would say toTe
Democratic friends that no doubt
of them could beat some of these ne!?rame
Laughter. They can't all be Fred
lasses ; but if they (tbe Democrats) woi I i
read the Scriptures and join the Rcpul r
party they had a chance of beating nianf f
the negroes. He sometimes thought i
his heart was glad at the pnwpcct, that en
and human wrong is drawing to a close H
was for man, everywhere, whether his v
was browned by an American, an African
an Asiatic sun. The color of the skin
nothing to him. He was for all men r a8
plause. " LAP-
Hon. W. D. Kelly of Pennsylvania said .
The majority alone of those who said w.ii
done to Congress, is more than the ent
white voting population of the ten late i"
surgent States ; and with this endorsement"
he took the question of the admission of ti
Southern States to himself. He would s.
when he would admit them. He was
ing, when Congress shall have disavow
those bastard organizations which now ml
over the territory of the ten late insurren.
States ; when having disavowed the product,
of usurpation, it shall pass enabling acts U
which the whole people of each State shall
elect a convention to form new constitutions
which shall be submitted to the whole peo!
of the State for their ratification ; and if
when that constitution is thus submitted it
shall be discovered that any citizen of anv
township, though he be black as the the dev.
il, is excluded from voting by reason of hij
color, it shall be the cause for the rejec tion
of such constitution. Applause. Whcn
the States come with constitutions republi
can in form, he (Mr. Kelley) will agree to
their admission. But until then he never
wbuld agree to the admission of a single oue
of them.
At night the banquet was held. In reply
to a toast, complimentary to Congress, Hon.
Thaddeus Stevens said :
I pray you, gentlemen, to strengthen our
nerves to do all these things, and more. Aid
us to make " treason odious : to seize the
largest estates of traitors and sell them in
small plantations to industrious men, aud
apply the proceeds to pay pensions to sol
diers and the debt of the nation. Do not
permit us to allow these great criminals to
escape with but ample fines as a warning to
future malefactors, as well as indemnity for in
juries inflicted." Can you not so brace our
nerves as to induce us to give impartial suff
rage to all men within the States now in our
power ? Less than this with my consent
shall never suffice for reconstruction. I have
been mortified to see Republicans profess
that the new Amendment of the Constitu
tion already proposed would satisfy them.
It was never so intended. It is oue step, a
very mincing step, in the line of reform.
But it might be adopted and leave this Gov
ernment a despotism. Teach us to do thor
ough work ; not harsh but just work ; and
may disgrace follow those who are satisfied
with less. We give various excuses for our
shallow work. Some of us have too much
conscience ; some have too much heart ; some
have friends who own Southern plantations ;
I have no personal allusions, as I am not
speaking of what has happened but what
might.
I know not what there is in the proposi
tion that captivates sensible men. There is
the music of alliteration, " universal amnes
ty for universal suffrage." But that could
only gratify those who are " pleased with a
rattle," " tickled with a straw." Let us not
be content with such puerile work. We are
laying the foundation of a new empire, us
ing all the materials of tbe old that are fit
for service. This empire is to embrace a
continent, and during the lives of some men
living it will contain one hundred millions
of people.
To le enduring, her institutions and laws
must be homogeneous; to be just, they must
be impartial. No man, or sect, or race must
be singled out for special legislation. Let
the same laws apply with strict impartiality
to every human being in the Republic, wheth
er it be in Church or State, in civil or mili
tary life. Then we shall have realized the
glorious dream of " liberty and equality."
We shall nave created an empire wtiose chro
nology shall put China to shame a republic
more perfect and more practical than we im
agined bv flato or More.
Speaker Colfax spoke in reply to a toast
requesting speedy action by Congress, as fol
lows :
He knew right well that no indemnity for
the past could be secured ; we could not go
down to those cannon-furrowed battle-fields
and bring to life the mouldering bones of our
dead soldiers there; we could not restore
again to the widow her dead husband, to
the father his dead son ; but, thank God, we
could have security for the future, and, so
help us God, we would have it. We inten
ded to reconstruct this great nation saved by
the heroism ot our brave men, upon such a
corner-stone of loyalty, liberty, justice, and
humanity, as shall stand, enduring as tbe
eternal ages, until, from ocean to ocean, from
the Lakes to the Gulf, every man, rich or
poor, learned or unlearned, black or white,
shall have that equal justice which was his
birthright, and until a government was es
tablished to which every man, however hum
ble, might look for protection against tyran
ny at home. Applause. On that platform
this Congress stood and the Fortieth Con
gress would stand, and they would be sus
tained by the people, and, sustained by jus
tice and right, would go forward to a glori
ous triumph.
In reply to a toast, " The Loyal Press," Col.
Forney of the Chronicle said :
The few Union newspapers that bravely
defend the doctrines of the Radical Congress
and still stand true to the original pledges
now so basely broken by Andrew Johnson,
are published in the midst ot hostile com
munities, and, without exception, at the im
minent hazards of the lives of their proprie
tors and editors. There is, 1 believe, but one
such newspaper in Eastern Virginia, but one
in North-Carolina, (that of the gallant Hol
den,) none in South-Carolina, two in Geor
gia the Savannah Republican, which is now
simply a newspaper without opinions, and the
Loyal Georgian at Augusta, in the same State,
chiefly supported by colored men. In Ten
nessee there are four the Memphis Post, the
Nashville Press and Times, the Knoxville
Whig, and the Colored Tennesseean. In Ala
bama one, and that conducted by a colored
man ; in Louisiana two, one conducted by
colored men ; in Mississippi none ; in Texas
none; and in Florida one. Even in such
border States as Maryland and Delaware a
Union paper is only published under incon
ceivable difficulties. In Kentucky, after sev
eral efforts to establish a paper of this kind,
and after a promising enterprise had been
commenced in Louisville, the effort was aban
doned in despair and the field surrendered to
the rebels and Copperheads.
In reply to another toast Senator King of
Louisana said :
It is the desire of all truly loyal men in
the rebellious States, and particularly of tbe
loyal people of Louisiana, that Congress pro
vide for them enabling acts, provisional gov-
ernments, with loyal men, possessing
the
proper nerve, as provisional governors, and
n : l ? i - , .i .
ignore an previous political goveruuicu" i
plainly speaking, rubbing out and beginning
anew.
The loyal people of Louisiana desire and
pray for universal suffrage, with one except
ion, and that is, that rebels shall be disfran
chised. They are, further, in the necessitous con-
I
