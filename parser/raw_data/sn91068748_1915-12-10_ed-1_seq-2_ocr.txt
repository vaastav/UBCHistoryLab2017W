As three would make good
company, it really seems unfeel
ing on the part of the State De
partment in not letting von
Bernsdorf breeze along with
Boy-Ed and von Papen.
"Is Louisburg a Ass?" queries
the Greenville News anent the
refusal of its Board of Town
Commissioners to install a sew
age filtration plant. More polite
to say Louisburg is an mule and
just as good grammar.
Recent statistics gotten up by
the University News Bureau
show that Halifax County ranks
seventy-second in the number of
murders committed. Robeson
county has the undrsirable
eminence of ranking first in this
list.
"The country is now to be pre
sented with the spectacle of a
Democratic leader on the tloor of
the House stoutly and obstinate
ly opposing the most important
policies of a Democratic admnis
tration. No wonder the donkey
is almost universally accepted as
being emblematic of the Demo
cracy" is the way the Hender
son Gold Leaf reflects on the
situation.
President Wilson's message to
the sixty-fourth Congress will
probably go down in '.history as
one of the ablest State papers of
this government. On no point
brought out is the President
more logical and convincing thin
on the all important issue of
adequate national preparedness.
The increases he proposes are
both "essential and sufficient:"
"it involves only a shortening of
the time within which plans
long matured shall be carried
out" declares the President, and
he appeals to the patriotism of
Congress to carry these plans in
to effect. Every citizen interested
in the welfare of the nation
should read this message.
We were mistaken when we
stated in an editorial last week
that the commissioners should
and probably would pass an
ordinance prohibiting the mer
chants from sweeping the trash
out of their stores into the street.
This ordinance is already in
effect having been passed years
ago and4it is up to the policemen
to see that the law is enforced.
We believe a warning is all that
is necessary and it should be at
tended to at once. Either that,
or repeal the ordinance and make
it against the law to have any
cleaning up done at all.
The "Quart Law" Upheld
l
In so deciding the caseof tllenn
vs Express Company as to up
hold the popularly designated
"quart law" of the State, the
Supreme Court merely resolves
the close question of the consti
tutionality of the Webb-Kenyon
law in favor of the interpretation
put upon it by the Legislature.
With this result every phase of
opinion in the State should be
well content, since whether the
Webb-Kenyon law is or is not
constitutional is in reality a mat
ter for the Supreme Court of the
United States, to which the ques
tion, on the facts of the North
Carolina statute, will now be
squarely presented on writ of er
' ror. The net practical result is
that the novel experiment of
regulating interstate commerce
by the exercise of the police
power of the State will continue
in operation for at least a con
siderable period before the high
court at Washington will render
a final opinion. In the opinion
of a unanimous court, which was
read by Associate Justice Allen,
the intricate questions of inter
state commerce and the power
of Congress practically to dele
gate its regulation to the States
are stated with clearness and
powerfully argued in the affirma
tive. It may be of academic in
terest to attempt to set forth in
the words of a layman what
seems to be the objection to the
Webb-Kenyon law, which caused
Mr. Taft to veto it, and the reas
oning by which it is now sustain
ed by the North Carolina court.
Prior to the passage of the
Webb-Kenyon law the power of
the State to regulate traffic in
liquor began in interstate com
merce only after it was placed in
the hands of the consignee.
Liquor was then, as it is now, a
recognized subject of interstate
commerce. The State could pro
hibit its manufacture even for
individual use. It could, per
haps, make it a crime to have it
in possession, or even to drink of
it: but it could not so inter
fere with the exclusive right of
Congress to regulate interstate
commerce as to say in what
quantity or manner it might be
imported. The Webb-Kenyon
law assumed so to limit the right
of interstate commerce in liquor
as to make it illegal wherever it
might operate in contradiction of
an existing State statute passed
in pursuance of the police power.
It having been settled that
Congress cannot delegate the
right of regulation of interstate
commerce to the State, does a
general statute recognizing laws
of varying tenor which the State
has passed or may pass consti
tute an attempted relinquish
ment of its sole privilege?
If so, the Webb-Kenyon law is
unconstitutional and the status
of liquor in interstate commerce
i is unchanged until Congress shall
j postively regulate it in direct and
; specific terms.
If, on the other hand, an act of
Congress may declare that in the
I uncertain event of action by
1 States that action shall, ur.derthe
general term of the statute, in
stantly become a part of the
Federal act, the Webb-Kenyon
law stands.
It is this technical but far
reaching decision on which the
fate depends, not only of the
Webb-Kenyon law, but of a new
principle in interstate commerce
interpretation. Raleigh.Times.

! GREENSBORO LEADING
Sold 60,000 Red Cross Seals Be-
fore Thanksgiving. Clarkton
in Same Class
Greensboro has already sold
over 110,000 Red Cross Christmas
Seals and has so far set the pace
for the sale of the seals in other
towns her size. By Thanks
giving she had not only sold liO,
000, but had placed ;!0,nno more
Where they will most likely be
sold before Christmas, and had
' given her order for fiO.OOO more
seals, increasing her original or
der of 1UI,IH)II to loO.OlKI.
The secret of Greensboro's
properous sales lies mainly with
; her business men. They have
agreed to use the seals on all
' correspondence, including state
ments sent out, beginning De
1 cember 1st.
What the town of ClarkU n Las
done in the way of selling Red
Cross Christmas seals is by no
means to be sneezed at. She is
. right up with Greensboro in per
capita sale. By Thanksgiving
she had sold 1.000 seals and had
i given her order for 2. . i M I more.
Elkin and Duke are not far be
hind as' they each sold l.non
'seals before Thanksgiving and
askeil for 1,000 more.
According to Dr. L. B. Mc
Brayer, chairman of the State
( Red Cross Seal Commission, San
atorium, N. C, the sale of Red
Cross Christmas seals will be in
creased o0 per cent or more this
' year over last year and the fight
' against tuberculosis made strong
er than ever before.

The tet of
a fire insur
ance policy is
Every fire tests the kind of
service a company K'vi-s its
policy-holders butthe suprern j
test is the great conflagration
that leaves a big city in ashes
and forces many insurance
companies out of business.
At such times the man who
holds a policy of the Hartford
Firelnsurance Company never
worries. He knows that his
policy is bae' ed by ample as
sets and more than a century's
record for the prompt pay
ment of every honest loss.
That's one reason we repre
sent the Hartford here. There
are other reasons equally good.
May we talk to you about it ?
