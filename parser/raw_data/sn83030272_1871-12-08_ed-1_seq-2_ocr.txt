then, In round numbers 20,000 Iiepulil cans
In tho State, who, nt the recent election,
voted for minor candidates, but refused to
sustain their regular Stnto ticket
Now, every well informed politician knows
that except for thu tremendous pressure
brought to bear upon tho Itopuhlicaus on
r.rcotiut of tho Tnmmany fraud", tho bolt
from tho State tirkrt, In'rattso of tho out
rageous proceedings of (J'UNl'M olllci'hold
ers and retnliicru at tho Syn.ci.B0 Conven
tion, would lmvo been more than double
what It was. Indeed, except for this eovero
pnsmire, and for the utter demoralization of
thu Democracy nriBing fro the 8am.' c.iuae,
the Syrncu! ticket would havo been beaten
by Iltty thousand.
Tin S3 figures nro capable of 5 fur wider

This Stnto gives only about ono tenth of the
electoral votes of tho whole Union. If, u i
ilcr tho most discouraging clrctinistmcf,
and in tho faeo of persistent ell'irts to keop

t.ml ns playing Into tho hands of the Turn
many robbers, nnd wns sure to bo bnrreu of
Immediate benefits, twenty thoimnd Repub
licans In this Statu had the courngo to pro
test at tlio polls against nominations dictated
by n Convention of Guam's officeholders,
then it Is sufo to assume that there nro at
least ton times as many Indepomb'nt Repub
licans in the Union who will stand up to
thoir convictions at .11 hazards, nnd will not
only refuse to support n regular Republican
candidate for the Presidency whom they do
nut like, but will volt- for au npptudtion can
didate whom they do like.
In 1809, when Oen. Uuant was thorough
ly acceptable to nil Republicans nnd to many
Democrats, and when (luv. Suymudu nns
norno down with nn obnoxious platform,
UliAHT only r;at n majority of 300,593 In tho

ngnljitt a lb form enndidnto like I.yma.n
Tltl'Mlil'M., nnd these 200,000 independent
Republicans nlonc would make n chnnge of
100,000 in tho popular vote, thus destroying
Uhant's majority of nOMSS. nnd turniug
whole tiers of States against him.
As nlrendy stated, the figur-s we have
el ted by no means monsiir'' the extent of the
Republican defection from U n. Quant; but
we have taken them because they cannot bo
dlrpntjd, nnd becausT they provo that, In
tho lnnifungc of JuJge Citftnit, if Quant
is tho Republican candidate next year, he
will como out of tho contest one of the
worst beaten injn that ever ran ut the Presidency.
How Crime is Promoted,
In Ioulsville, n clerk lu tlie lVst Olllef, n
young man belonging to a highly resp.'itnblu
family, has been nrrctt. d and held to lnul In
:ho sum of ten thousand dollar to nppnr
fur trial on tho chnrgo of ruin ing the mail.
The cv'.dcneo against blm appears to bo con
elusive, ns several letters enntnliilug money
wero found uion his person at tho .time of
lii errcM. Such enses ns this are only tno
(ommou, ns lnstnnees of dishouesiy ou the
part ofthrso employed In positions under
the general nnd various Stnto and municipal
goven iiients nre becoming painfully fre
quent. It s not dillleult to account fur this un
pleasant and disgraceful state of affairs. It
lies, In tho miuds of ninny, come to bo cou-fiden-d
nothing disreputable to steal from
tho publ.c funds ; nnd ninny men who nre
notoriously dlshonct-t now figure prominent
ly 111 high jofitione, mid ostentatiously
tlautit the tvii.incoi of their iil-gotto:i
wialth lu the eyes of the world without
orfeltlng fecial recognition from thoso wuo
absumu to be gentlemen nnd men of honor.
And yet these men nro moro culpable than
tlio common burglar who stonltlilly pursue?
his vocation under cover of night, Inasmuch
us to tho crime of theft they add thu equally
ser.ous ofl'etico of a base bitrayal of tho con
fidence which has been placed in their integ
rity by thulr fellow clt zens, And It is owing
to the impunity which has attended corrup

directly from the public treasury ; but they
corruptly divert tho authority with which
luy arelntriistid for tlie benefit of the people
to the promotion of pr. vat t interests which are
antagonistic to thi.tto of tho public at large ;
unci they nre not dlsgruc d in public rstltun

Minister Catacazy was tho rcfimnl of tho

true?
Any wny, speculation is one ol the great
brunches of business attended to by th s Ad
ministration. Thero nro speculations In
gold, out ol which brother-in-law CouniN
draws $2fi,000 profit for Mrs. Quant. Thero
aro speculations In Senecn sandstone, by
which tho city of Washington Is robbed nnd
ruined, while tho members of the H ng, Oen.
QltANT Included, per.ket the nvnlls in safety.
Thero nro speculations In telegraph stock
which rnlso the price from III to 70, the
President's message giving It tho hist lift,
nnd then tho bold bulls se'l out nnd lenvo
their victims to dcploro tho loss. Thero nre
speculations in keeping public stor s to
iloicc tbo merchants of New York nnd fatten
tho lucky members of that Ring. Then
thero is tho grcnt Ring of tho Pr.tiKtNH
clniin, lu which the President Is raid to I c
employed ns claim ngent, writing prlvnte
letters to tho C.nr In thirt capacity.
So it is all around. Sioculatious, Rings,
and corruption aro tho nrdur of the day it .der
this Adm.nlstration. Then there Is the gn at
Cuban Ring, with Secretary Kisit's son.
Inlaw being its most sctiw member nnd
President Quant its right lower, with ten
or twenty millions for lis prospective profits.
Amid this great rush of Rings, robberies, nml
frauds, it would tint ln surprising if Don
Hamilton Ftsit should tako a hand in by
attempting to put oil' upon the Russian Mil.
It-tor a lot of hind oil the sleepy east sine f
New Yoik for fifty per cent, above Its real
value.
However, let us wint und see. Perhaps
Don Hamii.io.n w II write us a communica

to make a Utile money out of Catacazv, and

Tho ibtabl s'linont of a r ublie in Prance

This was to be eipcctud. (Iiunt's deswjtic Ad

Tho poor of Nuw York and Huston arc threatened

tno compensation of skilled labor in the New

bo hoped that Congress will crant the lucre ise,
even to tbi aTiount of one hundred thousand dol
Uis. h may bo urged, it is truo, that poor anil

The election of Mr. PlM IlliACK to tho

Gen. Grant. Senator I'lMiinict, who thus
becomes virtually Mcu'cnanbUnvcrnor In room
of Dish, deceased, is one of the ablest and most
influential colored gentlemen 111 the State. He
was a leading member of the Committee which
met Gen. Ohant last summer at bong ltratich
and demanded the removal of brother-in-law
Casrt, 011 which occasion tho President foil
backward upon tin pi.no and dismissed tlio
