RUEF JURY
LOCKED UP
FOR NIGHT
Panel Trying Fallen Boss of San
— Francisco Unable to Agree
at 1 o'clock
Huge Crowd Gathers Around
Courtroom, Tensely Await
ing Verdict
Juror Murphy Blocks Verdict
-{ by Holding Out for an
Acquittal
Judge Lawlor Defines "Accom*
pike" and Specifies Complain*
ing Witness Is Not One
WITH a case before it that
for positive incrimination
of the defendant defies the
assault of logic, another
ILuef jurystands unready, for the time
at least, to retprn a verdict of guilty
against the former boss.
Although the Ruef bribery case was
submitted to tlie jurors for their de
termination at 3:40 o'clock yesterday
afternoon, they had failed to reach
;; verdict up to 1 o'clock this morn
ing. when Judge Lav.lor ordered them
locked up for the night.
(Jet Supervisors' Testimony
Only once during the hours of de-
liberation that followed the placing of
the case in the jury's hands was an
inkling given of the cause of the dead
lock or of the identity of the members
6f the jury responsible for the delay.
That was late at night, when the jury
entered the courtroom with a request
that certain portions of the testimony
of former Supervisors Gallagher, Wil-
M»n"and Furey be read to them. Later
Hi* request was amplified by an ap
plication for further instruction con
cerning the law applicable to accom
plices.
• During the three hours that the jury
remained in the courtroom one thing
became clearly evident — that Juror
Dennis Murphy was one man holding
oat .for a verdict of acquittal and
aligning himself against an overwhelm
ing majority of his fellow Jurors.
Whether Murphy stood alone against
the remaining 11, or whether he had
the support of two other members of
the jury, could not be read from what
transpired In the courtroom.
AUirphy in Limelight
Murphy, however, failed to hide his
own position. The fight in the. jury
room evidently had been a bitter one,
and it was 9:40 o'clock when the re
quest was made for additional instruc
tions. Foreman Joseph McNainara an
nounced that the portions of testimony
desired were those parts of the state
ments of Gallagher, Wilson and Furey
directly relating to the offer of a bribe
made to Furey In the trolley matter.
Then the reason of the indecision of
the Jury became evident. Murphy took
the deepest Interest in the reading and
eeveral times . volunteered suggestions
as to the portions of the record to be
read.
Consult With Foreman
Jurors Alexander Bond and William
Harrison also consulted earnestly with
Foreman McNamara, but their conver
sation seemed directed to suggestions
relative to convincing Murphy, and not
to requests for furtber'instruction on
their own account.
For nearly three hours the reading
progressed. Dozier objected time and
again to the omission of portions of
testimony in the reading, endeavoring
to make himself the censor-and force a
reading of much for which the jury
had not asked.
Not Clear on Law
The reading finished, Murphy de
clared that he was etill not clear on
the particular point that caused the
trouble.
"It's a question of the law we don't
understand," he said. "We want to
know whether one who agrees to re
ceive a bribe is an accomplice of the
one who offers the bribe. That's what
we are disagreeing over. We want, the
la-w on that point." ;
**The instructions of., the court 'rel
ative to the law regarding accomplices
was read. The court repeated again
that the agreement, to accept a bribe
does not In- itself make the one so
agreeing an accomplice of ; the person
offering the bribe, and .Murphy ex
pressed, himself as satisfted.; It was
12:15 o'clock when the Jury retired for
the last time. . Thirty- five -minutes
later Judge Lawlor gave the order, for
*.V<« twelve men t<T retire "for" the, night.
wTarge to Jury
The reading of the charge to the Jury
was concluded at 3:35 o'clock In the

PANAMA CANAL
RECORDS SHOW
NO SHADY DEAL
Former Attorney General Knox
Makes Clear President's
Action in Matter
Accredited Agent of France the
Recipient of Coin Paid by
the United States >>\u25a0
[Special Dispatch to The Call]
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.— When Presi
dent Roosevelt wrote his letter to
William Dudley Foulke concerning the
insinuations of improprieties*, on "the
part of the administration in; the. pur
chase of the Panama canal property,
he stated completely, so far as the
administration is concerned, its atti
tude toward that transaction.-. The
president- has always taken the position,
and does so' today, that " he' does not
care what individuals got: the $<o,oo<hV
000 paid by the United States for the
canal. The thing;he was after , was to
get the canal for the United States,
and he . got it .- • >
All the papers in Washington bear
ing on. the purchase of the canal prop
erty have been overhauled and sub
mitted to the' correspondent of <the
Times. In them there was nothing to
indicate that the government officials
connected with the- purchase had - any
knowledge of the ownership of the
stock, in the' company that owned the
property or that any Americans were
interested in the matter.
Fixing of the Price
The price paid for the canal ""property
was determined by a board of United
States officers after a thorough invest
gation on the isthmus. As far as this
government knew or. had any occasion
to ! inquire, the persons with whom it
dealt for the canal property were
Frenchmen or their representatives, and
the Frenchman I who . receipted • for the
$40,000,000 was the representative' of
the ' Panama canal company, 1 duly ac
credited by civil tribunal of the. Seine.
It was because .of *thiiy. action, of .the
French courts in the , matter that the
president in his letter; to Foulke said
that the United 'States-had "-'dealt'* with'
the French government, the -French
court undoubtedly being a part of that
government." , \u25a0 , , y •
.Neither the president nor any one
,for. him made an' investigation .at the
time of the purchase as to the personnel
of the new Panama canal company.
Why the President , Is Angry
These circumstances explain , the an :
ger of the president at the continued
insinuations of impropriety on his part
In the canal transaction. From , his
point of view those .'insinuations, car
ried to their logical conclusion, embody
substantially a charge that he pro
cured the payment of $40,000,000 for
the canal property to enable his broth
er in law, Douglas Robinson^ and
Charles P. Taft to make a lot of money.
Since the publication of the presi
dent's letter to Mr. Foulke there has
been a search of the, papers relating
to the canal transaction, now on file
in the various departments in Wash
ington, in order to see if there is any
thing among them that would tend to
show who constituted the new canal
company at the time of the sale.
All these papers were overhauled and
submitted to the New York Times cor
respondent. The search^ of the, papers
disclosed the fact that; nothing was
brought to. this country that" would
show in detail the personnel of the new
Panama canal company. The -minutes
of -the general meeting of, the stock
holders of: April 23, 1904, report only
the two resolutions carried, -and men
tion the fact that the first was op
posed by only four stock holders, rep
resenting five votes, and the second by
only three stock holders, representing
three votes.
Senator i Knox's Statement
Senator Knox called on the president
this morning and made it very clear
why nothing bearing .on this, question
had been brought to Washington. He
left a written answer to the president's
note, saying in part: .
"This government did not get the
stock books . of - either the old or the
new Panama canal company. We did
not. "buy the corporations or, their
stocks. We only bought property. We
had. no dealings with the old company
at all. That company and the new
company adjusted their equities in the
French courts. . . All; I_? cared) for was to
see that they did adjust therain such
way as, to protect this government.
"In. the absence of , any suggestion of
irregularities— and there was none such
—it was a matter- of .indifference to
the United States who owned the stock
of the new company."
Knox said this morning that he alone
was responsible for v. the '.--manner -in
which the transfer of .= the ; canal ; prop
erty from the Frenchmen to. the United
States was; accomplished. : It was his
business as" attorneyVgeneral to satisfy
himself of the correctness and validity
of all the moves in the transaction^ and
he.had done so. * '

The Spring Valley, .water company
has secured but cold* comfortvf rom i the
recent decision of Judge Farrington^
and in order to extricate" itself from
Its unpleasant predicament has. issued
a; so?tly phrased appeal to the publicJ
It appears that: the: uncertainty of the
court's ruling has-.: prompted;- some
26,000 "consumers to decline to pay the
excess ; charges . as , , demanded -by the
corporation: \u25a0 Of the 50.000 rate pay

bill;; . ; . : ' , '
Amount Due in Doubt
The' phraseology of Judge Farring

the. : consumers -were- obliged \u25a0to i pay.
The company claimed . that it was en

obliged to pay the excess.
. The tender plea; presents Spring Val
ley in a new role.* The wording of the
document is calculated to start all the
springs of human sympathy gushing in
full commiseration. The appeal runs
as follows: '\u25a0/ ;
"Many rate payers are without cor
rect Information relative to rates and
water, supply. l The -water rates have
been: judicially increased 15- per cent.
The' water used' for domestic and other

Miss Rotimer Is an intelligent young

Alleged Suicide
On every occasion but the one nar
rated by; Miss Rohmer. "Wilson c'ontend
ied that Boas committed sulcldo" In a
; spectacular manner to s-yold harassins
debts. He contended that point yester
day when he was interviewed.
Only ' 24 hours after" Boas' death tne
man .who, bsS Boas lived, •would possi
bly have been exposed as an embezzler,
said to Miss Rohmer: "Harry Boas did
not- commit suicide; he was murdered
and they will get the man who did it."
Now "Wilson Is In jail.' about : to b»
charged with the murder. His un
canny prediction Is .comlnff strangely
true. The police believe that "Wilson
murdered Boas by sending- him' strych
nine' disguised as indigestion powders.
They declare that" their theory Is sub
stantiated by the findings of Theodora -
Kytka, the handwriting expert,- who to
convinced that Wilson wrote ! the J note

also contend that Wilson had" heen'rofr
