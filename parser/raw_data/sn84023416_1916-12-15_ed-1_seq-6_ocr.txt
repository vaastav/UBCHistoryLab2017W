Vocational Education.
President Wilson in his personally
delivered message to Congress De
cember 5th, gave the vocational
education bill a good send-off when
he said:
"At the last session of the Con
gress a bill was passed by the Senate
which provides for the promotion of
vocational and industrial education
which is of vital importance to the
whole country because it concerns a
matter, too long neglected, upon
which the thorough industrial prep
aration if the country for the criti
cal years of economic development
immediately ahead of us in very
large measure depends. May 1 not
urge its early and favoiable con
sideration by the House of Repre
sentatives and its early enactment
into law? It contains plans which
affect all interests and all parts of
the country andl am sure there is no
legislation now pending before the
Congress whose passage the country
awaits with more thoughtful ap
proval or greater impatience to see
a great and admirable thing set in
the way of being done."
This bill is the5 one Senator Carroll
S. Page has so long labored upon,
and first introduced. It failed pas
sage at that time, but its importance
was not lost, and when the Demo
cratic administration' came in it was
taken up and introduced by another
member only to meet the fate given
to Senator Page's bill. It is sure to
come, however, for the people want
it, and it should be a national law in
order for all the boys and girls in
the United States to be benefitted.
No matter under whose name it be
comes a law, the fact that Senator
Page was first given credit for it,
and it was largely through his ener
gy and efficient labor that it took
shape and secured so firm a hold on
public opinion, will always connect
Vermont and Senator Page with this
far-ieaching and constructive educa
tional legislation, and it will go
down in history as supplementing
the great and valuable work of the
Morrill Agricultural College bill.
This bill has the loyal support of
President Wilson and Vermonters
are going to take much interest in
its passage.
There is some talk of attaching
the office of tax commissioner to
that of State treasurer, claiming
that an efficient clerk can take care
of the work of the office and thus
reduce the cost of operating that de
partment. This may look good at
fit st thought, but is it possible to
to keep adding to the office of state
treasurer, secretary of state, and so
on, without increasing the salary for
those offices? Is it wise to bunch
this work where mush, of it will re
ceive only divided attention? Is not
the office of tax commissioner of suf
ficient importance to require the un
divided attention of the commis
sioner? We believe in retrench
ment, but not such kind as this,
where there is something more evi
dent than retrenchment. If there
are people who want to cut off
Charles Plumley's head, politically
speaking, come "out into the open.
Be men! Plumley has been a most
efficient and energetic tax commis
sioner. He has done his work faith
fully arid well and there is no valid
reason to knife him. We feel his
activity in the recent senatorial pri
mary was unwise, but there is no
evidence that it caused the work of
his office to be less faithfully per
formed. We are free to admit that
the real cause for this activity on
the part of Mr. Plumley seemed un
justifiable to us, for the Plumleys.
father and son, have received much
from Senator Page in the way of
boosting them into public patronage
and political honors. This, however,
is something the public has nothing
to do with so long as their conduct
as public officials has been of the high
standard the Plumleys have main
tained. We also admit that Charles
Plumley as a coiner of campaign
slogans and political phraseology,
showed remarkable poor judgment,
but there is no evidence that this in
any way caused lack of efficiency as
tax commissioner, or should be held
against him as a public official. If
the Republican party is going to
stoop to such vindictive and drastic
methods as is generally believed
prompts this "retrenchment in the
office of tax commissioner, then it is
evident there are certain other les
sons for it to learn wh;ch its pig
headedness and foolishness has failed
to take in from the happenings to the
party in the past four years. Bah!
Let's be men and fight in the open.
This village is certainly fortunate
in having a R. R. Y. M. C. A. This
is emphasized when we see how
firmly it is established and the good
work it is doing. Associate with
the railroad is the local field in its
work of- maintaining this organiza
tion, and its membership is made
up from both. There probably li no
better equipped R. R. Y. M. C. A.
building to be found in any place of
its size. In their support of this or
ganization the Island Pond people
have shown their characteristic unity
of action, zeal and determination
which they put into every project
for public good, and have made it a
splendid success. It is a matter of
no little pride that Island Pond can

It was not a long time ago when
the claim went broadcast into every
nook and corner of the State that
nobody wanted a certain candidate
for senator but the people. The vote
has been counted and now let's
see who the people did vant.
Neither Hugjies, the Republican
candidate for president.nor Graham,
candidate for governor, headed the
list, but the man whose public life
was held up before the people in
every phase of disparangement, and
picked and twisted, and placed in
every light to show base and selfish
motives, stood the test of public
scrutiny, and at the polls received
the emphatic approval of the people.
Yes, the people certainly wanted
Carroll S. Page for U. S. senator to
the tune of 47,362 votes that he re
ceived againft Miller, democrat, 14,
956, making Page's plurality 32,406,
as against around 16,000 for Hughes
and 26,000 for Graham. "You can't
most always, sometimes tell" what
strange ideas get into the cranium
of political aspirants who try to
climb into office by tearing down tim
life work of their opponent. Some
boomerang, that.
"Sound" Criticism.
The editor of the Merrytown Mail
received a complimentary copy of a
musical composition from a friend who
desired a favorable criticism of his
work. This is what appeared in the
next issue:
"As the editor of this journal doesn't
know a tleml-semlquaver from a dia?
pnson or a bass clef from a 'high O,
he will not therefore be expected to
give an extended notice of this pro
duction. We enn sny, however, that
the type used In printing the composi
tion Is clear and plain, and thnt the
paper appears to be of the best quality
of rag. The design on the front page
Is most artistic, and the words are as
tender as a real spring chicken and as
poetic as the song of the meadow lnrk
on a Muy morning. The melody is
sound and all right. The harmony,
too, appears to be strictly O. Iv with
no patent defects or noticeable blem
ishes. The tonality Is clear and re
sonant, and rests on harmonic gela
tions and melodic elements. This is
about all' the pruiso In connection with
said composition we are able to evolve
from our cabbage-fluvored temperament."

From a Sherburne Correspond
ent. History is repeating itself in this
section and like tobacco in Virginia,
potatoes and cabbage were legal
tender in Sherburne this fall. A
farmer could fill his pockets with po
tatoes and exchange them at any of
the stores for a bill of groceries that
would last the family for several
days; for what cabbage he could car
ry in his arms one farmer bought a
brass bed and received 87 cents in
change, while another whose old hen
turkey brought her setting Bafely
through the perils of infancy . drove
the flock to town and took back a
Ford fully equipped and a pair of
extra tires.
