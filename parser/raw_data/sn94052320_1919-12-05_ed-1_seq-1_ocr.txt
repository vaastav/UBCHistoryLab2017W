Carranza Must be Good
Washington. Itsnewlng its request
for the Immediate release of Consular
Agent Jenkins Imprisoned st Puebls,
the Isteet American note to Melco,
made public here, arraigns tbe Meg.
lean government's conduct In severe
terms and characterizes It ss a studied
attempt to ensnare the American con
sular agent la the Intricacies of legal
proceedings.
No ultimatum was served snd bo
Indication was gives) of what the
American government'a course would
be If Jenkins is not immediataly re
leased. Tbe note to Mexico begins by saying
that the United States declined to be
drawn Info a Judicial discussion of
"Irrelevant or unimportant matters,"
and aaya tbe request for the consular
agent's release is founded on "right
snd Justice."
The United States, the note ssys, is
"constrained to the opinion" that the
Carranza arguments that the case Is
being Investigated and that Jenkins
has not taken opportunity to be re
leased on ball are "mere excuses."
This government does not sdmit, tbe
note saya, that It Is necessary to keep
Jenkins In Jail while bis case la being
investigated and this government "fsils
to discern" that tbe "Intricacies of the
Mexican penal law" have been applied
with Impartial effect to Jenkins.

Causes of Unrest superficial
The president made bis moat exten
sive reference to tbe pees treaty by
aaylng the oauses for tbe unrest "are
superficial rather than ' deeo-eeeted"
and that they "arise front or are con
nected with tbe failure on tbe part of
our government to arrive speedily at
a Just and permanent peace "permit
ting return to normal conditions, from
the transfusion of rMIcar theories
from sea thing European centers pend
ing such delsy, from heartless profi
teering resulting from the taerears of
tbe cost of living, and lastly from tho
machinations of passionate end male
volent agitators. ' " " ' "
"With the return to normal condi
tions this unrest will rapidly disap
pear." Would Curb Agitators.
The president renewed his recom
mendations for legislation to deal ef
