CLEVELAND DOWNED.
Charles F. Crisp, of Georgia, has been
elected Speaker of the Fifty-second Con
gress, and Hoger Q. Mills, with hit plat
form of "absolute free trade, an income
tax, and Cleveland at any cost,' is wal
lowing in the dust. Of course Crisp's
election means the continuance of the
Democratic policy on the tariff, but
more than that, it seems that G. Cleve
land has received a slap in the face at
the hands of the Xatioaal Democratic
House of Representatives. Mills wa3
Cleveland's man, and made the tight on
that issue. The fight was bitter and to
the fiaish, and the an'i-Cleveland men
seem to be in the majority. This is the
first right for the Democratic nomina
tion next year, and if this indicates any
thing, the bloated apostle of tariff re
form is do longer the patron saint of
Democracy.
The fight over the Speakership, which
it took thirty ballots to decide, evident
ly engendered enough feeling to insure
more fractional .fights in this Congress.
The Cleveland men will endeavor to re
claim the the points they have lost, and
an interesting time may be looked for
on all questions in which they can
divide. The turn of affairs will meet
with the approval of Republicans, and
can not fail to be injurious to the
Democracy,
Is these days when executive com
mittees are endorsing men for positions,
and requesting Representatives to pur
sue such and such courses on certain
questions, the erroneous impression has
gained a footing that such endorse
ments carry with them the backing of
all the Republicans of the county. Such
is not the case, nor do the3e gentlemen
who happen to give endorsement in
tend that it shall convey such a mean
ing. Such an endorsement carries with
it no more weight, nor is it entitled to
any more weight than the endorsement
of the same number of other Republi
cans in good standing in the party.
Senator Bkice, of New York, was
allowed to take hts seat in the Senate,
but Senator Sherman served notice on
him that his seat would be contested.
The way is now open for a contest if
the Legislature of Ohio deems such a
course advisable, and shall elect a suc
cessor to Senator Payne.
The Cyclone and Fayette Republican,
of Washington C. H., is doing valiant
service for the cause of Senator Sherman.-
Last week it printed the reasons
of the editors of the State, along with
the leading editors of other States, for
supporting Sherman. Its work will tell
in January.
Ever since the election the Foraker
organs have yelled for their man to the
exclusion of everything else. That may
do for them, but the Sherman men have
been quietly sawing wood, and will be
in the lead when the votes are counted.
Owing to the day in organizing the
House, the President's message was not
delivered to Congress until Wednesday
morning, consequently too late for this
week's issue.
The man who tried to kill ' Russel
Sage with dynamite was found to be a

Ex-Sheriff O. E. FoiLKe has pur
chased the interest of J. M. Maring in
the Lantern Globe Works. The price
paid is private.but the works will continue
iu operation as heretofore, Mr. W. C.

charge of the business. We are glad to
welcome Mr. Foulke here to engage in
manufacturing and have no doubt his
investment will prove profitable. Bell
aire Independent.
He is For Sherman.
Hon. J. C. ileinlein has announced
himself for Sherman for Senator. There
has never at anytime been any doubt
about the sentiment of the Republicans
of this county on that questiom, and the
announcement could just as well have
been made a month ago as now, if he was
waiting to learn the feeling of Repub
licans. However, the decision of Mr.
neinlein is as was expected and meets
with general approbation.

in regard to the, financial standing of

editor of the local paper. As a rule he

promptly, can be trusted in all things.
The contrary is also probably true.
Governor Campbell has granted a
pardon to Edward Steele, who was sent
up from this county in February of last

The Standard Oil stave cutter, which has been
in operation ou the farm of Bcuj. Watkins, has

have been, during the last contract, considerable
contention between the company and haulers,
four in number, who it appears have hauled to
Lewis' Mills for transportation 139 more railroad
ties and several hundred more staves than the
mill sawed. While it Is probably a mistake, It is
also rather a ridiculous dilemna.
After the adjournment of the Bible Society on

say so in its very next issue.
