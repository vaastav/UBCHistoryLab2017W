My love is like the dewy rose
She wears upon her breast.
Her breath.is like the wind tbat blows
Balm-laden from the West;
Her smiles are like the sunlight shed
On wavelets aB they roll.
And like the blue Bky overhead
Her purity ol soul.
Her generouß thoughts are like the rain
That falls on hlga and low ;
Her kindly gifts to age and pain
None but the wretched know.
Her sympathies are broad as Day
And starry as the Night,
And when there's darkness on the way.
Her presence sheds a light!
Such were my thoughts when love was young
But now, when Love is old.
Each fancy .of my pen and tcngue
Is silver turned to gold.
I wood her In the Morn of Life,
Ere yet by sorrow tried.
And now I cherish her as wife-
More than I loved as bride.

SUMMARY OF THE PRESIDENT'S HIS
SAGE.
The President's message wbich was de
livered to the Houses of Congress on Wed
nesday, the 9th, is a very voluminous docu
ment covering a great variety of subjects
and too long to be published in full in these
columns, and wonld probably be read in
exlenso by few, if any, and as preferable we
publish a summary of it as furnished by
tbe Baltimore Sun which says:—
About one-third of it is devoted to a dis
cussion of tbe foreign relations of the Uni
ted States. The year, he says, has been
one of unusual activity in tbe Department
of State. Among the diplomatic results is
the negotiation of reciprocity treaties with
Brazil, the Spanish West Indies and San
Domingo, and like negotiations with otber
oountries are in progress. The satisfactory
termination of tbe Bering eea dispute bas
resulted in a greatly decreased destruction
of seal, and nothing now remains open bnt
tbe selection of arbiters. A joint demarka
tion of tbe boundary line between the Uni
ted States and Canada, rendered more
necessary by growing border settlements, is
suggested. Nothing bas been accomplish
ed in tbe attempt to mediate between Great
Britain and Venezuela in the settlement of
their boundary trouble. The opening of the
maikets of Germany, Denmark, Italy,
Anstria and France to American inspected
pork products is attributed to the act of tbe
last Congress in providing for such inspec
tions by the Department of Agriculture and
tho power given to tbe President to exolude
products of chose countries which unjustly
discriminate against the United States.
Correspondence with North Germany is
pending looking to concessions in return for
the free admission of ber sugar to tbe Uni
ted States. The internal affairs of Brazil
and the relations of that country with us
are discussed. Whilst condemning tbe ac
tion of the New Orleans mob, the Presi
dent regrets the manner in wbich Italy
chose to present her claim for indemnity,
and says that the temporary absence of an
Italian minister at Washington has tended
to delay a settlement. The episode sug
gests to the President the propriety of mak
ing offenses against treaty rights cogniza
ble by FtJeral.'rsthor than State courts.
Tbe most important matter in our foreign
relations is tbe present condition of affairs
witb Chili. The President narrates the
history of the recent revolution in that
country. An appeal was taken from the
judgment of the court iv the It -ia affair,
not so much in view of the importance of
having the vessel condemned as to bave tbe
law uudeißtood. If tho lower court is
right, Mr. Harrison thinks the law should
be amended. The tone of the message in
dealing with the attack in Valparaiso upon
the sailors of the Baltimore is strong and
aggressive. The report ot Capt. Schley is
adopted, and hostility to tbe United States
is considered the only motive for the at
tack. The attention of Chili was directed
to tbe matter, and that government was
asked if there were any qualifying facts
which might relieve tbe affair of the char
acter of an intentional insult to the United
States. If such did not exist this govern
ment wonld confidently expect reparation.
The reply to this communication wss of
fecßive in tone. Events are waitiog upon
the investigation now in progress in the
Criminal Court of Valparaiso. The Presi
der.t declares that it the just expectation
for reparation is disappointed a special
message will be sent to Congress. Legis
lation enabling (he government to apply to
Sweden and Norway the rule for levying of
tonnage dues, as was provided in the treaty
of 1827, is recommended. The time for
the ratification of the nctß concerning the
reform of the tariff in Congo Free State and
the suppression of the slave trade has been
extended to February 2, 1892. Toe Presi
dent considers the objection to Mr. Blair
as minister to China untenable, and says
that American citizens residing in China
and in the Caroline Islands mast be pro
tected. Participation in Spain's celebration
at Madrid of the discovery of Columbus is
iecotnme_,ded. The survey of the inter
continental railroad is progressing well, and
a thousand miles have been surveyed with
out encountering insurmountable obstacles.
Otber questions of foreign relations are a
recommendation of an appropriation for
carrying out the Mexican boundary treaty,
tbe necessity for a cable to Honolulu and a
discussion of the friendly relations of those
islpnds, and the condition of the Jens in
Bußsia, to which country a respectful pro
test against its cruel treatment bas been
made. This country, the President eec
c arts, is threatened with a vast immigra
tion of these people. There is also a rec
ommendation for an improvement of the
harbor of Pearl river and its equipment as
a naval station, and the ratification of the
arbitration treaty formulated by the Inter
national American Conference. Aid to tbe
.Nicaragua Canal by ihe indorsement of its
binds is strongly recommended. If this
cinal can be secured in no otber way tbe
President thinks that to build it witb
money from the treasury would be justified
by the economy which it would effeot in
handling the navy and in the transportation
of freight, which be estimates would pay
the cost of tbe canal in a short series of
years. The appointment ol a government
Bgent to reside at Navas.3, at the expense
of the guano company, for the protection
of the laborers is recommended, and tbe
oondition cfinternition 1 copyright is ad
verted to.
Io dealing with the tariff question tbe
message gives the arguments of tha repub
lican party, and declares that the expeota
lions of the friends of the McKinley. bill
bave been realized in an increased volume
of foreign trade, cheapness of all necessary
articles and in the general prosperity of
the country. The total value of foreign
oommerce for the year ended September
30, 1891, was $1,747,806,406, the largest in
tbe history of tbe country. Imports of
merchandise Increased $11,000,000 over the
previous year,and exports show an increase
of $62,014,021. The President concludes
this portion of his message by condemning
»Dy further agitation of lhe tariff question
as detrimental to the country. The re
ceipts of the government for the fiscal year
were $458,544,233.03, and the disburse
men ts $421,304 470.46 The d isappearanor
of the surplus is accounted for by the pay
ment, since March 1, 1889, of $259,079,350
of tbe bonded debt. Interesting facts and
figures are given concerning the silvei
question, and here, too, the President
itrocg'y condemcs any change in tbe pres
ent law, which he cotsirlets salutary.
The retirement of Secretary of War
Prootor is referred to with regret and the
operations of his department highly com
mended. His recommendations for the
adoption of smokeless powder and con
tinued activity in harbor and const defense
is approved. The enlistment of Indians
into tbe army is pronounced a success. He
also concurs witb tbe Attorney-Gereral ie
recommending tbat tbe ri»ht of review by
the Supreme Conrt in felony cases be
limited. An appropriation for a reforma
tory school foi girls in tbe District of
Columbia, already provided for by law, is
also recommerded Attention is directed
to tbe evasion < f the law by Chinese who
enter tbe country over the Canadian and
Mexican borders. Tbe increased receipts
of tbe postal service are given, along with
a recommendaiion that, free delivery be ex
tended to to- nc of 5 000 population, ad
tbat tbe «n< ney-order and postal-note
•ystem be ft rther extended. Tbe failure
lamplish any results nnder the ship
y system devised by the last Congress
wiih the hope that a way maybe
to overcome tbe difficulties. Ihe
ion of the navy as shown in the re
f Secretary Tracy, which has alreaay
red -n these columns, is given, ana
resident concurs in the recommenda
f its further increase. The discuasiou
dia. affairs occupies considerable
. Methods to reduce Indians to
a. and farmers, and the cstablisb
cf mixed sohools to bring tbe children

_. A simple form of town govern

tions of the Department of Agncult
re adverted to with much satisfaction.
is connection it is estimated tbat the
of farm products this year exceeds
of the last by $1,350,000,000. O.her
lmendations. are: Increased appropria
tions for the civil service commission, whose |
work is highly commended; protection to,
railroad employes by requiring air brakes
and automatic couplers in interstate trad J!
tha annointment of a committee to take
to collect the debt of $118,512,613
Ribe subsidized railroads; appropria
or tbe completion of tbe census; that
overnment should i_ot part with its
rights in the dry region »>»oat as
ce that citizsus will get full benefit of
irrigation, and for tho further suppression
of polygamy. The active operations ot the
pension bureau are commended and tne
harsh criticism of it is depreoated. lhe
subject of offenses against chastity in the
Distriot of Columbia also receives attention.
The ohange of method in selecting presi
dential eieotors in Michigan is referred to
with some feeling, and is made tbe occa-
Sof a-recommendation tbat Congress
ild fix the method of suoh appoin
ts so as to be uniform and free from
the gerrymander.
The latter portion of the message is de
voted to a brief discussion of the force bill
and the evils it was intended to correct.—
Tbe President yet entertains the hope tbat
tbe question may be the subject of a calm,
patriotic consideration, and thinks it wonld
be possible to constitute a non partisan
commission, tbe appointment of the mem
bers of wbich might be given to the
Supreme Court, to consider the whole sub
ject of the law of elections as related to
federal affairs, "witb a view to securing to
every elector a free and unmolested exer
cise of the suffrage and as near an ap
proach to equality of value in each ballot
oast as is attainable." The message con
cludes with the expression of gratification
at the increased unification of the people
and the revival of the national spirit.

qnickly cured by Simmons Liver Regulator.
