President McKinley has the same Samp
son-Schley matter under aerious consider- j
ation. He is understood to he willing that
a bill should be passed authorizing the re
vival of the grade of vice admiral for the
benefit of Rear Admirals Sampson and
Schley, tne former to be given seniority
of the other. It is believed Secretary
Long will join in indorsing this solution
of the controversy.
What will probably cause considerable
criticism among Rear Admiral öchley's
friends is the determination of Secretary
Long to name Admiral Sampson in the
measure he is preparing, . giving the
thanks of congress to the couunander-in
chief of the-north Atlantic squadron and
the officers and men under his command,
It is not believed, however, that the
president will transmit such a resolution
to congress, knowing what determined op
position it will meet and the probability
that friends of Schley would have his name
substituted for that of Sampson and paaa
the resolution in that form.

Washington, Dec. 16.—With solemn
p 0m p and circumstance, with ceremon
j es beautiful, impressive and appropri

assemblage and in the full splendor of
ideal autumn weather, the centennial
of the death of George Washington was i
commemorated at Mount Vernon. That 1
Mount Vernon should have been select- J
ed as the scene of the exercises was
peculiarly fitting. Ihere it was that
the happiest incidents of Washington's
life occurred. In other parts he en
dured his trials; on other fields he won
his triumphs; but there, surrounded by
those whom best he loved, were spent
the restful, quiet, studious hours of his
Ilf®. There it was, too, that he sick
cned and died; there all that was raor
tal was laid to eternal rest In a mau
80,euin overlooking the broad sweep of
toe picturesque Potomac,
The ceremonies were elaborately
P lanned and successfully carried to
fru,t,on ' They were conducted by the
Masonic bodies and by the Red Men of
the United States. The movement for
the day's observance originated in 1893
with the grand lodge of Masons of the
state of Colorado, the proposition being
made by Most Worshipful William D.
Wright, grand master of Colorado, who
was present to witness the carrying
Into efTect of his long cherished Idea.

Mr. Isaao Brook, of McLennan
county, Tex., has attained the great
sge of 111 years, having been born la
1788. He is an ardent friend to Pa
rana and speaks of it in tho following
terms:
"During my long life I have known
» great many remedies for coughs,
»olds, catarrh and diarrhoea. I had
always supposed these affections to bo
different diseases, but I have learned
from Dr. Hartman's books that these
affections are the same and are prop
erly called catarrh.
"As for Dr. Hartman's remedy, Pa
rana, I have found it to be the best, if
not the only reliable remedy for these
affections.
••Peruna has been my stand-by
for many years,and l attribute my
good health and my extreme age
to this remedy. It exactly meets
ell my requirements.
"I have come to rely upon It almost
entirely for the many little things for
which I need medicine* I believe it to
be especially valuable to old people.
ISAAO BROCK.
Catarrh is the grastest enemy of old
age. A person entirely free from ca
tarrh Is sore to live to a hale and
hearty old age. A free book Oh ca
