PRESIDENT IS
PROUD OF
i
MR. TAFT ASSERTS THAT
STATES HAS WON A VICTORY
OF DOLLARS AND NOT VICTORY
OF BULLETS IN A CRISIS
Washington, 1). ('.. Dec. 3. -President
Taft's first mei-sr.fe'o to the last
session of congress in his term, was
received with close attention of hot:'
brandies when legislative business be
gan today.
Dealiug entirely with foreign rela
tions and America's commercial pro
gress in foreign trade, the message
paved the way for others the chief
executive will send later dealing
with th.p big questions of legislation
and government.
Washington, D. C, Dee. :!. A note,
of warning to European powers which
by indirect means continue to dis
criminate against American trade;
a strong appeal to the congress to up
lift the great foreign policies of Amer
ica above mere questions of partisan
ship: a triumphant vindication of the
diplomacy of the administration,
which is characterized as that of "dol
lar versus bullets;" a masterful pride
it; the enormous expansion of Ameri
can trade as a result of tlx' foreign
policies of his administration: and an
earnest appeal tor joint action by
congress and the executive to open
new markets for American industries
these are the more striking features
of President Taft's fourth annual mes
sage sent to congress today.
The message is the first of a series !
of such communications which he !
will make to congress in the early :
days of the session, and deals entirely ;
with the foreign relations of the!
Vnited States. Beginning with the
tiiiial reference to the existence of
good relations with foreign powers. '
the president adds that these have
been strengthened by "A greater insis-:
ti nee upon justice to American clti
zenc, or itnerests, wherever it may ,
have been denied and a stronger em
phasis of the need of mutuality in
commercial and other relations."
For the first time in its history ;
says the president the state depart-:
ment has obtained substantially the
most favored nation treatment from !
. all of the countries of: the .world.!
Therefore, he says that it is only
natural that competitive
countries i
should view with some
UNITED
concern the,1" ...
expansion of our commerce. Hence
the warning, "If in some instances,
the measures taken by them to meet
it are not entirely equitable, n remedy
should be found."
To this end, the president strongly
recommends the enactment of the bill
recommended by Secretary Knox last
december, permitting the govern
ment, instead of imposing the full
maximum rates of duty against dis
criminating countries, to apply a grad
uated scale of duties, up to that max
imum of 23 per cent.
"Flat tariffs are out of date," says
the president. "Nations no longer ac
cord equal tariff treatment to all
other nations, irrespective of the
treatment from them received.
It is very necessary that the Amer
ican government should be equipped
with weapons of negotiation and
adapted to modern economic condi
tions." The state 'department, "an archaic
and inadequate machine," at the be
ginning of this administration, the
president says, has
become a new or-;
ganization, with highly specialized
bureaus and experts dealing with
every phase o American trade and
diplomacy. Holding that the essence
of this reorganization service is
leund in the merit system, which
President Cleveland is credited with
having introduced. President Taft
makes a strong appeal to congress to
make this machine permanent, by
giving the force of statutory law to
the executive orders governing admis
Mon to and promotion in the diplo
matic and consular services.
To show that these appointments
are already largely non-partisan, the
president points to the fact that
three of the present ambassadors are
hold overs; that of the ten he has
appointed, five were by promotion
from the rank of minister; that of the
thirty ministers appointed, eleven
were promotions; and that in the con
sular service no less than 55 per cent
of the consuls appointed by him were
from the southern states.
"The diplomacy of the present ad-
ministration has sought to respond to ;
modern ideas of commercial inter- i
course," says President Taft. "This j
policy has been characterized as sub-; S
stituting dollars for bullets. It is one !
that appeals alike to idealistic hit-1 V
manitarian sentiments, to the dictates j
of sound policy and strategy, and to !
legitimate commercial aims."
The president adds that "because S
modern diplomacy is commercial,
there has been a disposition in some
quarters to attribute to it none but
materialistic alms."
"How strikingly erroneous is such
an impression may be seen from a
study of the results by which the di
plomacy of the t'nited States can be
judged," says the president.
He mentions the arbitration

C. Gilbert was awarded the verdit in
her suit to recover $UMn from the
Yeoman lodge on the face of her late
husband's life insurance policy to
day. The trial was a peculiar one in
asmuch as it had the effect of twice
having cleared Mrs. Gilbert of the
charge of murdering her husband in
Pueblo, August, 1911. The jury in the
life insurance case was given to de
cide whether William Gilbert died by
suicide or had been poisoned. Mrs.

HOW THEY PROCEED TO IMPEACH A FEDERAL
JUDGE.
The house of representatives pre-i
pares and votes the articles of im-.
peacliment against a federal official.
! P. acts as a sort of a grand jury in the !
matter. The present, house did that in ,
' the Archbald case last spring and
early summer. The senate is the
; court that conducts the trial of the :
! charges. i
, The house having appointed a com
! mittee to manage the prosecution,
j consisting of representatives Clayton,
i (Ala.); Webb. iX. C); Davis, (W.
1 Va. I: Floyd, lArk.i; democrats, and:
i Sterling, (lll.i; I lowland, (O.), and:
! Norris. (Xeb.l, republicans, this body:
! appears before the bar of the senate.
The assistant sergeant-of-arnis an-1
; nounces their prest nee to the sena
tors, who until then are not officially
aware of their being in the chamber.:
The sergeant-tif-tirins cries the trial ',
thus:
"Hear ye! Hear ye: Hear ye! All ;
! persons will keep silence, on pain uf I
i imprisonment, while the house of rep
resentatives is exhibiting to the sen
ate of the l uited States articles of
i impeachment against Robert NY. Arch
i bald. United States circuit judge."
ChaViman Clayton, of the house
prosciiting liiitnagers, leads the arti
cles. These articles having been care
: fully prepared by the best lawyers in
the house, are immediately attacked
j by the best lawyers in the senate. 1
1 no big flaw is found the senate orders
j them printed and sets a date for the
J trial to begin, and serds word to Chief
' Justice White to come over and ad
j minister the oath required by the con-;
stitution to each senator. That noma
dene, the accused Is summoned, and
cemcs to the chamber with his law
yers. By that time the senate room is
packed so full with lawyers that the
paees are crowded up against the
vails.
Then the trial .'tarts in good earn

DEMOCRATS SAY
TAFT BEAT THEM
OUT OF JOBS
, Washington, D. C, Dec. 3. Presi
dent Taft sent more than 200 recess
appointments to the senate today ana
immediately indications of a move
ment among some of the democratic
: senators to prevent their confirmation
became evident. Senator Gore, it
was said would have the active sup
port, of several collegaues in heading
the movement.
The campaign is directed especially,
against nominations which it is claim
ed have been postponed from time to
time .thus bringing Ihe new terms
close to the beginning of the demo
cratic administration. Democratic i
unators claim the president already
has deprived the democrats of the
privilege of appointing ",0.ouli post
masters by placing them within the !
ivil service law by a single order.

i London, Dec. 3. Adrianople was
the obstacle which threatened to
wreck the parleys between the pleni
potentiaries of Turkey and the Bal
kan allies when they first opened at
Baghtche, and Adrianople, appeared
again at the end of the negotiations
as to the most serious hindrance to
the attainment of an agreement. At
the first session the Turks absolutely
refused to surrender Adrianople, but
when the Bulgarians finally yielded to
them on this point, the Greek dele
gates shrank back and demanded
time in which to submit the question
to the government at Athens.
The reason for the Greeks' objec
tion to such submission is not far to
seek, according to diplomats. It is
pointed out that it is obvious that if
the Bulgarians sacrifice the ultimate
possession of Adrianople in the inter
ests of general peace they will expect
their allies to share their sacrifice
and the only way in which this can
be rime is to cjive Bulgaria compensa
tion in the shape of territory
nupred bv the Creeks, Servians
con
and Montencurins. ar.d which they
staked
'out for themselves. Hence
the wail
from Athens that any concessions to
Turkey will "endanger the fruits of
victory gained by the aies abov
ail those of Greece and Servia."

peaceful motives, he is unable to re

which all Ottomans consider as a
Mohammedan sanctuary.
Diplomats in all the European coun
tries are anxious to see the real peace
negotiations, as they consider there
will then be a better chance of reach
ing a settlement of the Austro-Ser-vian
dispute, which is still worrying
the nerves of Europe.
London,
Eng., Dec. 3. 1 e imiei-
ness of feel
ling between Greece anu
Bulgaria was
reflected today at tfie
Greek legation m
London. The Greek
minister claimed that the action oi
the
Greek lleet was the 'one uecioivo.
factor i
of the whole war. Hiinoui are
of our ships Turkey would
presence
have been able to Dnng ner rav
troops from Asia Minor and to land
Itheni at Dedeagatch and flank the
Bulgarian armies, thus rendering
their magnificent victory quite impos
sible." As regards the Bulgarian po
sition at Tchatalja, it appears that
Greece more than once offered Bul
garia three divisions of fresh troops
and the entire use of the Greek fleet
' to augment the force before the Tcha
talja lines, but received no reply td
her offer.
The terms of the armistice between
the Turkish and Bulgarian armies
as accepted by Bulgaria provide that
Ihe truce shall continue during the
whole period of tlw peace negotia
tions. Turkey is to have the right of revic
tuailing all her besieged fortresses
and all the detached bodies of Otto
man troops remaining in Macedonia
and elsewhere as well as the Turkish
populations in the various parts ot
Ihe theater of war
For revictualling she may use the
Adrialic and Ionian seas in addition
to the ordinary available routes. The
allied Balkan nations are to furnish
safe conduct for the revictualling
parties and Ottoman convoys are to
;be permitted to pass, if necessary,
; through the forces of the allies.
; The blockade of the Aegean and Ad
riatic coasts of European Turkey is
, to be raised.
i The terms are generally regarded as
generous, but in view of the great
'difficulty which Turkey necessarily
: wMI find in revictualling her scattered
forces their practical effect probably
will not be very important.
Athens. Dec. 3. Surprise and an
noyance are expressed by the Greek
, newspapers at what they term the
complaisance shown by Bulgaria in
1 accepting the Turkish proposals
i which are so advantageous to the Ot-
