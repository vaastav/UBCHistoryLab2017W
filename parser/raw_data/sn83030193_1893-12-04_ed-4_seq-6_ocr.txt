BINO BINO, Dec. 4. John De'.ftno, the
Murderer of Mrs. Cnrollne Oesell, whom
he shot two days after last Christmas
Dy. paid the penalty for hla crime In
Sins Sing Prison to-day. The electric I
current was turned on at exaetly 11.43, '
and In 50 seconds he wna offlcli.ny pro- ;
nounoed a oorp.'e by the attending phy-.
alclans.
Aa waa the case In the more recent
executions, the voltage was 1.700 and of
1-2 amperes.
In four seconds the voltaic wna re
duced to 160 and kept there for 4ii sec- i
o'nris.
The execution wns a perfect success,
and unattended by any of the horrible
features In. Idem to a l...:ir,lu.:.
Delflno w.ts executed In inc same chuir
In which Carlylc V. Harris and John 1..
Osmond paid the death penalty, and, like i
both of them, he was thoroughly same
to the end. He vn for more c.ilm an i
sif-collected than Hev. Fatheil He Nino
and M il-. his api.uuu unvmeis, w.i.j a.
companled him to the deatli chair.
Jb'athcr De Nisei wis particularly nf-.
fected, even to tears. li.s associate, i'aih

the prayers for Ihe dying and threw an '
especial fervor Into the sacred recital.
fit company ltn ihe newspaper men ,
and other witnesses, Warden Durston, i
l'rlaon Fhysicla i Irvine and Urs, ri j. I
Carroll, of Brooklyn, and Cnarlos Carter
Crammer, of New York, went down to
the death chamber at 11.S0.
Here rtarly fifteen minutes was spent
In examining; the death-dealing appara
tus. It was found to be in perfect condi
tion, with no possibility of a repetition
of the Taylor horror at Auburn.
Warden Durston then quietly motioned
P Principal Keeper 'onnaughton and
State Detective Jackson, who dlsap- j
pcared into the cell-honse. Again the!
bis black door swung n .Uselessly aside,
and following the prison otllelals there.
appeared a sightly built man of less
than thirty years. His oc.unionan.c de-
noted more than average Intelligence, and
wore an expression of almost cheerful
ness, not to say confidence.
The priests who followeo him repeated
the prayers of the Catholic Church in
nervous and excited tones. At Intervals
the doomed man Joined in the riMpmses,
but it was noticeable that he seemed to
take a remarkable Interest In the pro
ceeding's, of which he was the central
flgu'u.
Ho .ni.rk d was that Interest thnt when
the leather misk was finally atrsppe.l
cvtr hla face Delflno Impatiently Jerked
hla head one side to get n last look nt
the reporters, who were making notch
on ins final exit.
The current was applied Just as he In- ,
lated on this final look, ami he died
almost without a struggle. Father Mllo.
on bended knee, did not realize that the
end had come
He continued his recltnl of the prayer
for the doomed man until he had been a
corpse several seconds. Onlv did he de
alat when Father De Nlsco silently
touched him upon the arm. Then hi'
arose, and followed his associate through
the cellhouse and up Into the Warden's
office.
The autopsy was Immediately begun
by Dra. Irvine and Carroll, in the death
I chamber.
The autopsy was finished nt 1.35. It
I dlacloaed that death was Instantaneous.
I According to Dr. Irvine, Deltluo was
I one of the finest physically developed
I men that ever sat In the death chair.
I There was a slight scorching on Ihe
right leg and on the scalp, where the
electrode was applied, the latter being
caused by the cup used. It lit loosely,
as Delflno'a head v.as unusually small.
i Immediately after the autopay Warden
Durston telegraphed to Delflno'a wire.
asking her what disposition she wished
made of the body. He received a reply
atatlng that a Brooklyn undertaker
would call for it during Ihe afternoon.
I Delflno arose early this morning, and.
In spite of the Ignominious fate await
ing him. appeared unwontecHy cheerful.
He ate a light breakfast consisting of i
chops and eggs and smoked several j
strong cigars while awaiting the in. I
visit of his spiritual advisers.
He bade farewell to his wife, children
and brother yesterday afternoon, and
P. . the scene waa most affecting.
At .30 Warden Durston visited Delflno
in ills cell and read the death warrant
to him. He was apparently little af-fe-ted.
Aa coon as the Warden left him Hev.
Fathers De Nlsco, of Brooklyn, and ,
Nino, of Sing Sing, were admitted to
the cell-house, and for Hie next hour i
were closeted with the doomed man,
heating his final confession and adminis
tering the last rites of the church.
to the vety last Delflno insisted that
he was not a murderer. He admitted
killing M-s. Oesell, but claimed that the
hooting was uccv-ental.
For tne first time since murderers were
killed in the electric chair at Sing Hlng
no flag or signal was displayed to-day
at the execution. On former executions
a black flag was raised over the War
den's house aa soon as the murderer had
been executed.
John Dtlflno's crime was committed
on the night of Dec. 17. ISSe His victim
was Mrs. Caroline Geseil, of 4G7 Degraw
treet, Brooklyn.
Mrs. Qesell A'as about twenty-one
years old. and lived with her hus
band and thlr three-year-old baby.
Delflno was married, had several small
Children, and was about twenty-six
year old. He earned his llvlnc by ex-
Knlblting trained birds on the street cor
ners In Brooklyn.
It Is alleged that Beveral days prior to
the shooting ot Mrs. Oesell Delflno had
Insulted her. i.he repulsed him, ordered
him to leave h r home and never come
Into her house again.
t He called on her ngTln on Dec. 27,
and when she again repulsed him he
murdered her.

There WSI a pronounrcd bearish feel

SHOT BY A BURGLAR,
Baker Kairer, of Oumden, Killed
in His Own Parlor.
The Thief Firei Three Times at Him
Through the Open Window.
Humors tli.ii the Murdered Sinn's
Son Is Under Suspicion.
CAHDBK, N. J.. Pec. 4. -William
Kalror, a well-known baker, of 429 Iteck
Itt rtreet, was shot and killed early this
morning hy a burglar who had entered
the house.
A few minutes before 5 o'clock this
n'ornlnij Knlrer was awakened by a
noise downstairs lie got out of bed,
and, without waiting to dress hlniBclf,
went to the head of the stairs nnd lis
tened. He heard footsteps and was con
vinced that some one was trying to force
en entrance Into th nojse.
Subsequently he went downstairs and
ntw n mnn on the porch. The burglar
l.nd opened the parlor window, and aa
Knlrer called to him the Intruder fired
three shots In rapid succession. One
shot passed through the baker's breast,
and he fell to the floor.
The noise of the shooting aroused the
other Inmates of the house and they
found Kalror lying on the parlor floor,
breathing heavily and Weeding from the
bullet wound In his breast. He did not
regain consciousness ..nd died before a
physician arrived.
The liurglur and murderer fled with
out leaving any clue to his Identity. It
Is not known whether he succeeded In
carrying away any property with him.
The supposition Is that he was sur
prised by KaJrw before he could ste.il
anything, and that he shot the baktr
down so as to Insure his escape.
The police have been at work on the
case Blnce daylight, but to the present
time, ns fnr as known, have no clue to
the murderer.
I luring the past few months numerous
burglaries have been committed in Cam
den, and on a number of occasions the
burglar or burglars have resorted to the
pistol.
In one Instance a citizen whose house
was broken Info looked out of a scend
story window, when two shuts were fired
at him by the burglar. Neither took
effect.
The Coroner, Justice of the Peace nnd
Police Lieutenants Smith nnd Neutze
made a careful examination of the house
thla morning and found that the l.ui-glar
had tnken BO cents which he found in n
child's bank. He smashed the bank to
pieces.
The man lert prints of his bootheels
In the ground where he jumped from the
veranda.
The murdered man's son says his
father and himself chased the burglar
downstairs and that his father got be
tween him nnd the burglar. -
Tile son then chased the burglar out
the back entrance, and as the thief ran
by the parlor window he deliberately
fired nt the old man. The burglar hnd
unlocked both the front and back doors
or the house.
Pater In the day It wns announced at
i Police Headquarters that William Knlr
er, son of the murdered baker, was rus
pected of having killed his father, and
that Chief Davis had gone to Kalrcr's
house to arrest the son.
The theory of the police Is thnt the
son killed his father ror the purpose
of getting possession of the bakery busi
ness, and that he concocted the burglary
story for the purpose of concealing Ids
crinie.
