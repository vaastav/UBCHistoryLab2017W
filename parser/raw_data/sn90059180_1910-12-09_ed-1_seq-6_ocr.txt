IX an article on "Duluth's Offer
to Factories" in the News Tribune
of Wednesday we note the rate per
kilowat hour of the Great Northern
Power Co. is given at from 2K cents
down to
a4
cents. We dislike to give
it to Duluth on anything, but are
forced to confess we believe they
have a mere trifle the best of Vir­
ginia in power rates.
THE Duluth delegation in the
coming legislature seek to learn
the wants of their constituency by
addressing a communication to the
Duluth city council, the county at­
torney and the board of county
commissioners, asking for informa
tion on any special legislation de­
sired. There is no record of the
State Brewer's Association being
favored with a copy of the com­
munication such an act would be
unnecessary, as all that is wanted
is anything for the good of the
cause, a fact too well known to need
recounting.
PRESIDENT TAFT'S MESSAGE, of
ficially delivered on Tuesday, was
not as long as the short session of
congress but will require most of
the term for members to property
digest. It covers everything in the
list, from tariff reform to the north
pole, and shows the president to
have taken a decided step forward
in the line of progressive repub­
licanism—especially as regards his
recommendations for a non-partisan
tariff commission to revise "the
best tariff ever." All of which but
serves to remind us that there is
but one more winter between now
and the jreneral election of 1910.
CONGKESS convened in short ses­
sion Monday. Inasmuch as the next
congress will be divided against it
self in such manner that the pass­
age of any law for the alleviation of
the people as a whole will be be­
yond the pale of expectation, it is
up to tlie present session of a re­
publican congress to pass any
measures they may deem necessary
for the party good—which mean9
measures for the public good, as
well. It is not anticipated, however,
that the short session of congress
will distinguish itself in any partic­
ular—unless it be in the tearful
farewell due the retirement of Uncle
Joe Cannon at the close.
COUNTY AUDITOR HALDEN on
Tuesday finished his work of mak­
ing the November apportionment
of funds to the various municipali­
ties of the county, and Virginia's
slice of $84,541.23 will place the local
bank book in favorable position
once more. The thousands of dol
lars of permanent improvement ex­
pense in Virginia during the past
season has made the city dads
draw
their breath and find out what
their credit was good for at the
bank, but they never fell down in
meeting any pending obligation
nor would have to fall were the ob
ligations thrice the size, for Vir­
ginia is one of the cleanest towns
from the viewpoint of indebtedness
to be found on the Minnesota map.

SPECIAL MEETING
November 21,1910.
A special meeting of the Board of Educa­
tion of Independent School District of Vir­
ginia, Minnesota, was called for the pur­
pose of considering the report of L. A. Lar­
son, the question of installing electric
generators, purchasing storm windows for
the Virginia High School Building, and to
do other legitimate business.
The special meeting was called to order
at 8:15 o'clock by the chairman. N. A. Hol­
mer.
Roll call:
Present, N. A. Holmer, T. H. Fleming,
Helen E. Coffrtian. R. J. McGhee, Lafayette
Bliss.
Absent, Guv H. Moore and Joseph Ros­
killy.
A comnmnication from Bell, Tyrie &
Chapman, Architects, was read nnd order
ed placed on file.
Bids for storm windows for the Virginia
High School building were considered as
follows:
Martin J. Enders $3175 00
Andrew Nelson 2875 00
Emil Solve 2800 t0
As the bid of Emil Solve was the lowest,
and also included the furnishing of oak
sash instead of pine, the contract, on mo­
tion duly seconded and carried, was award­
ed to the said Emil Solve to furnish all
material and labor necessary to install
storm windows on the Virginia High
School building according to the plans
and specifications furnished by Bell, Tvrie
& Chapman. Architects.
The report of L. A. Larson, heating and
electrical expert of the board, was read by
R. J: McGhee. On motion duly seconded
and carried the report was accepted, order­
ed placed on file, and that portion of said
report pertaining to electrical generators
was ordered puplished.
EXTRACT FROM REPORT OF L. A. LARSON.
"Your special committee on light and
power asked me to embody in my report
any advice or suggestions I might have re­
garding the advisability of putting in
your own generating sets. To this will
say I shall not attempt to advise you but
will give you facts and from that you can
advise Ourselves.
First—We gather from your committee
that your probable needs would be a total
of 150 H. P. in lights and motors. For this
I should recommend two direct connected
75 K. W. engine-driven generating sets.
The cost of these two sets erected (upon
foundation furnished by you) would be
about $7000 00
Foundation 200 00
Piping Valve, etc 500 00
Switchboard 1600 00
Estimate on wiring to lights and motors
—cannot estimate as I do not know how
much of this is now done.
Exhaust from engines would all be used
for heating except such days in fall and
spring when outside temperature is high
enough to require no artificial heat in
buildings. In cold weather you would not
get enough exhaust for heating unless
your engines were both running and carry­
ing full load, which probably would never
occur, so vou would have to add live steam
to make up the deficiency.
The available heat in exhaust steam can
best be illustrated as follows: If 1,000,000
British Terminal units of heat goes to an
engine in a given time—say one hour
there being less than 5% less of heat in
passing through engine would leave 950,000
British Terminal Units available for heat­
ing out of the 1,000,000 British Terminal
Units that were delivered to engine. That
is, 95% of the coal burned would be used
for heating and 5% should be charged to
the engine for power.
Estimate $800.00 for coal to one engine.
5%of$800.00 $ 40 00
Engine up-keep 100 00
Extra help 1000 00
Actual cost for power for one year $1140 00
Your committee informs us that in the
new building you have 90 H. P. in motors
and the best rate obtainable was 5c per
W. hour, with a $2.00 minimum H. P. per
month. If the minimum is applied it
would be $180.00 per month $2160.00 per
vear for power alone at new building. If
you have 20 H. P. at the Roosevelt at same
rates add $480.00, and if equivalent to 50 H.
P. for lights in both buildings were used
at same rate add $100.00 per month $1200.00
per year. This would indicate a minimum
charge per year for current, $3840.00. Should
you use enough current so the minimum
would not be applied, so much the worse
for you. Therefore let us use the mini­
mum. $3840 00
Cost to operate generators 1140 00
Net saving on current $2700 00
This would pay 6% interest on $45,000
orl09£ on 27.000
or 27% on 10,000
Should the cost of plant exceed the
estimate of $9900.00 by $100.00 and make the
plant cost $10,000.00 even, the plant would
earn 27% on the investment and would
therefore pav for itself in three years
nine months.
Would recommend that the A. C. motors
that you now have purchased be exchang­
ed for direct current motors and direct cur­
rent generators installed, if satisfactory
change can be made with the companies
furnishing the motors. If such satisfactory
arrangements could not be made we can,
however, install the low voltage generat­
ors, which would do the work but not so
satisfactorily as the direct current.
Here we leave you to draw your own con
clutions, and vou are at liberty to make
any changes in the figures that may ap­
pear to you necessary. Am of the opinion
that no matter how you juggle them there
is enough to go on to still make a good
showing in favor of a plant.
Yours truly,
L, A. LARSON."
Moved by J. H. Fleming seconded by R.
J. McGhee, that the Board of Education of
Independent School District of Virginia
enter into a contract with R. B. Whitacre
& Co. of St. PBul, for two high speed, self
oiling, automatic, Chuse engines, and two
75 K. W. Sprague Generators as per spec­
ifications in the hands of the Board for
$7759.00 and that the Virginia Plumbing 6c
Heating Co. be allowed 12'a% (twelve and
one half per cent) of the total cost of the
plant for installing the same according to
plans and specifications furnished by L.
A. Larson.
Carried unanimously.
On motion duly seconded and carried a
committee consisting of N. A. Holmer, J.
H. Fleming and Lafayette Bliss, was nam­
ed to arrange for the exchange of motors
now in the Virginia High School building,
and to execute formal contracts between
the parties named in the above motion
and the Board, The committee was given
power to act in the matters named and
was directed to meet at ten o'clock the fol­
lowing day to close up the business.
No further business appearing, on mo­
tion the Board adjourned.
J. II. FLEMING.
Clerk.

A 48-foot express car equipped with

cently, and will be loaded with 8,000
pounds of German carp and "dogfish"
for sale in Philadelphia. The car is

filtered. It will be kept in motion
constantly by air pressure and will be
cooled with ice. It Is said that fish
thus shipped will be worth 18 cents a
•pound, while fish shipped dead are
worth about six cents less.—St. Louis

Short Lived Notoriety.
Marietta Wolff, once the cook In the
home of line. Steinheil. whose aoquit
tel on the charge of murder was. In a
great measure, due to Mrs. Wolff** tes­
timony, has found a new occupation.
She has become a professional bill
poster in Paris. On one of the recant
"notable people" postcards published
in that city she is shown aa a «m«nny
elderly, plump woman carrying a lad­
der. A cap is set jauntily over one ear
and the poster bag hangs at one side,
held by a broad strap oyer the shoul­
der. The fact that she goes about her
bnslnes unnoticed, says a Paris letter,
shows that people have forgotten a»
other celebrated ease.
