CHAMBER OP COMMERCE.
Plana for Next Year's Campaign Dis?
cussed.
The directors of the Sumter Cham?
ber of Commerce h.ul a long meeting
yesterday and discussed plans for the
1916 operations of the organization,
and for cooperation between the city
council and Chamber of Commerce,
and the citizens generally for the up
buiUling of Sumter.
Water Works ' Department Land
Suggested for a City Park.
The directors decided to respectful?
ly suggest to city council that the
thirty-five or forty acres of land be?
longing to the water works depart?
ment be turned into a city park. They
will ask council to immediately begin
the setting out of pecan trees or other
suitable shade trees, pecan preferred
by the directors, on the water works
land. That the grounds be laid off in
streets preparatory to the completion
of the park plans.
Public Forum for Sumter During 1916
?Monthly Mass Meetings.
It was also decided that there will
be held monthly mass meetings of the
citizens of Sumter during 1916 under
the auspices of the Chamber of Com?
merce, and cooperating with the Re?
tail Dealers' Association, Civic j
League, City Council, City Board of
Education, County Commissioners,
County Farmers* Union, Y. M. C. A.
and other civic and welfare organiza?
tions, for discussion of various mat?
ters of general public interest.
It is intended that these meetings
will be a forum at which may be dis?
cussed almost any matter of public in?
terest for the city and county, and at
which plans may be put in motion for
the carrying out of a number of mat?
ters. The citizens generally of the
county and city will be invited to these
meetings. The directors believe that
if the citizens of the city and county
get together often for discussion of
public affairs, looking to the improve?
ment of conditions and discuss these
matters intelligently that the meetings
will result in bringing out many mat?
ters that will prove beneficial to Sum?
ter and Sumter county.
Dollar Get-together Dinner During
Last Week of December.
The managing secretary was direct?
ed to call the entertainment commit?
tee together and ask this committee
to arrange for a dollar get-together
dinner under the auspices of the
Chamber of Commerce some evening
during the last week in December.
December 30th was selected, but
Secretary Reardon was notified today
of the big dance in Sumter that eve?
ning and the supper date of the Cham?
ber will be changed to the 28th or
29th. At this dinner the business
and professional men will discuss a
number of matters pertaining to the
commercial, industrial, financial, and
agricultural welfare of the city and
county. Local speakers will address
the meeting on selected subjects.
On the first Monday in January
(there will be held at the county court
house a mass meeting of the farmers
of Sumter county and the bankers
and merchants of Sumter to discuss
plans for putting on additional cream
routes and the establishment of a
creamery in Sumter, to formulate
systematic plans for preparing for the
approach of the boll weevil, such as
making this a live stock, grain and
dairy section, the raising of more
poultry, truck, fruits, etc. and the re?
duction of the cotton acreage.
Dr. W. W. Long, of Clemson Col?
lege, with probably a dairy expert,
will be invited to address this meet?
ing.
Produce Exchange Manager Wanted.
The Chamber of Commerce is anx?
ious to secure a competent and ex?
perienced man who is willing to man?
age a country produce exchange In
Sumter for the bundling of grain,
truck, etc. One who is willing to
purchase the produce from the farm?
ers on market quotations.
This is a much needed enterprise in
Sumter. The necessity for conven?
ient marketing facilities in Sumter is
recognized by the business men of
Sumter, and efforts are to be put forth
to furnish same if possible at the
earliest possible date.
The inauguration of the dairy, live
stock, poultry, truck, and grain grow?
ing Industries to get ready for the
boll weevil means that the farmers
must have means of disposing of
these products. Unless the farmers
arc assured that they will be able to
dispose of their surplus Of produce it
a reasonable profit they will produce
in limited quantities only.
The dollar dinner and the county
mass meeting will discuss these mat?
ters intelligently.
The necessity for Improvement of
the country public highways was dis?
cussed at length by the directors at
the meeting yesterday, particularly
sonn? nf the main highways leading
into Sumter.
Public Fbrum Will l>o of (.real Val?
ue to Sumter.
The monthly meetings to be held
luring 1916 will be made as attrac?
tive and interesting as possible. The
directors seemed to be much interest?
ed in these coming meetings in which
nil citizens of the city and county will
be invited in true democratic style to
express their opinions upon any mat?
ters of public interest, such as mu?
nicipal or county government, civic
improvements, educational, public
health, commercial and agricultural
conditions or necessities. The bring?
ing together of the organized forces
of the city anl county, and the ming?
ling together of citizens, male and fe?
male for cooperative and educational
purposes will do a great deal of good
if the meetings are attended as they
ought to be.
SPENT MILLION ON ROADS.
Commissioner Watson Writes on Pro?
gress of Road Construction in
South Carolina.
Columbia, Dec. 9.?Reporting on
the progress of road construction in
South Carolina during the past year
Commissioner Watson says in an ar?
ticle prepared for a magazine:
"On the financial side of the mat?
ter, we have received reports as to
the grand totals of revenues for road
purposes derived from the genercl
road tax, which vary according to the
counties, from all but nine counties,
and the grand total thus derived from
taxation is $883,052.22. Estimating
the other nine counties, this would
mean that $1,000,000 was spent in
this State for roads for the year 1915.
"In addition to the above, since
1910, in seven counties, road and
bridge bonds were voted to the extent
of $249,500, $238,000 of these bonds
having been sold. In three of those
counties the bonds are 20-year bonds
and in the others 40-year bonds. In
each of the counties, with the excep?
tion of one, the rate of interest paid
on the bonds is 4 1-2 and 5 per cent.
In one county 6 per cent, is paid on
an issue of $25,000.
"With three counties not yet re?
ported, there are 3,808 miles of sand
clay roads, 17,219 miles of graded and
drainage earth roads, 36,055 miles of
unimproved, ungraded earth or sand
clay roads, 3 1-2 miles of macadam
mixed with bitumen, 18 miles of
plain macadam, 30 miles of gravel,
53 1-2 miles of shell and 600 miles of
other hard-surfaced roads. The total
mileage of roads, therefore, in the
State covering aU classes and kinds
is 47,791."
ENTERTAIN FOR YOUNG WO
I MEN. t
Missionary Social Union Committee
Gives Introduction Party to Mag?
neto Girls.
On Tuesday afternoon a commit?
tee of the Missionary Social Union
entertained in the rest rooms of the
Magneto Factory in honor of the
young ladies who are employed there
and the hundred or more of the girls
who accepted the invitation found the
occasion a most enjoyable one. The
committee of the Missionary Social
Union had requested a number of
young ladies from the city to assist
them, in receiving and entertaining
their guest3 and all found the occa?
sion which was in the nature of an
"Introduction Party," where the Mis?
sionary Union committee met the
young ladies, most interetsing.
Refreshments of coffee and sand?
wiches were served and music was
furnished on a Victrola. The ladies
of the Union, which is composed of
n embers of all of the churches in
the city, were assisted in their enter?
tainment by the officers of the fac?
tory, the efforts of all being to fur?
nish a little amusement for the
working girls and to make them feel
at home in Sumter. In fact so suc?
cessful was this "introduction party"
that the Missionary Social Union ex?
pects to give other similar receptions
to these young ladies each month.
OFFERS FOR NAVAL SERVICE.
Daniels Says it Now Has Watting List
and Picks its Men Carefully.
New York, Dec. 8.?The United
States navy has a waiting list at its
recruiting offices and accepts only
cne in six of the men who apply for
erdistmcnt, Secretary Daniels told
members of the Southern Society of
New York tonight, speaking at the
BOCiety's annual banquet on 'The
Navy." When he took office, the sec?
retary said, there were 4.053 vacan?
cies in the authorized enlisted per?
sonnel of 51,000, but as a result of
the steps taken to make the service
more attractive to young men of
proper qualifications, this h?s been
overcome and In addition the propor?
tion of reenllstments has risen from
' I per cent to 82 per cent., "which
means the securing of men of long
(raining lor the service."
