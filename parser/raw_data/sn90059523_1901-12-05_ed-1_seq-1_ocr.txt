RESOLUTIONS ARE DANGEROUS
LAKEWOOD, N. J., Dec. 4.—National
Democratic Committceman ' Norman:v £0.
Mack, of New York, .: said today with
reference to the McClellan and Fitzgerald
'resolutions that the' Democratic national
platform of ll'OO would stand until a new
one was made'- He said ■ nothing but
harm and disruption to the party could
ccme from any attempt to change it until
it is done by the representatives of all
Democrats in the national convention of
, 3904, for unless the Democrats of the east
ern states stand by the last declaration
of the party, dominated by the Southern
and Western states, there would be no
. good reason why the South and W<=st
should abide by- the national platform
dominated by.the Eastern states in 19U1-
if they should succeed in controlling aril
dominating the convention. .
V "The fact of the matter is," he said,
"that the Democratic party cannot alter
their national platform every minute. If
; they do not stand by the present one for
four years, what assurance will the peo
ple have that: they will stand by the next
oho for four years; and I don't mean by
this that the 1904 convention would not he
conducted on entirely different issuaa
than that of 1900." ...

GOVERNORS AT SHOW
SEVi. CHIEF EXECUTIVES AT LIVE
STOCK EXHIBITION
Record-Breaking: Crowd on Inter
collegiate Stoelc Jmlj-ins, Day-
Fifty Cents Per round for
Fat Prize Winner.
( AICAGO, Dec. 4.-The fifth day of the
international live stock exposition at
tracted the greatest crowd ever assem
bled at the Chicago stock yards, the pa
vilions, pens ar.d yards being crowded
really beyond their capacity. High offi
cials of several Western states and Cana
dian provinces were among the specta
tors, including Gov. Shaw, of Iowa; Gov.
Savage, of Nebraska; Gov. Van Sant, of
Minnesota; Gov. Durbin, of Indiana. Gov.
Dcckery, of Missouri; Gov. Toole, of Mon
tana; Gov. Wells, of Utah; Senor Cas
overas, of Mexico; Senor Alberto Seran
tes, of the Argentine Republic, and Hon.
J. H. Dryden, Canadian minister of agri
culture.
An interesting incident .of the day wa3
the selling at auction of the fat Hereford
steer Woods Principal, to which the
championship of the show was awarded
yesterday. A local packing firm started
the bidding at 25 cents a pound. Penny
by penny the price advanced, but 50 cents
was the limit, and A. G. Swenson, oX New
York, was the purchaser.
The annual intercollegiate stock judging
contest for the Spoor trophy was another
feature of the day. There were fifty
seven contestants, representing eight col
legos of agriculture, from the following
states: Illinois, lowa, Wisconsin, Michi
gan, Indiana, Ohio, Ontario (Guelph) and
North Dakota. Nineteen classes of live
stock were judged. Bach class was judg
ed by a special judge after the students
had judged them, and the students' judg
ment will be compared with that of the
judges.
The winners in this contest probably
will be announced tomorrow. ~
Students of agricultural colleges in the
United Stales and Canada met this even
ing at the hall of the Chicago live stock
exchange and organized the International
Federation of Agricultural colleges. Pur
due, Mich.; Ontario, lowa, Illinois, Okla
homa, Minnesota and other colleges were
represented. The object of the organiza
tion is the promotion of agricultural sci
ence and of good fellowship among the
students of agriculture.
The combination sale of Aberdeen-An
gus breeding stock in the main pavilion
this afternoon was mojst successful.
Ninety-seven cattle sold at an average
cf $344 per head.
Tonight closed "Governor's day" at the
show. Facing a throng that packed the
big pavilion, the heads of four of the
leading live stock and farming states of
the Middle West told how the farmer is
the "backbone of the nation." Each
speaker sounded especially the glories
and resources of the state which claims
him as its chief executive. The four
go\er ors whose addresses brought the
fifth day of the show to a close were
Shaw, of Iowa; Van Sant, of Minnesta;
Bliss, of Michigan, and Savage, 'of Ne
braska.
When Gov. Van Sant got the platform
the crowd greeted him as the man who
lias opened the fight on the recent com
bination of railroad interests.
"Hit 'em hard! Give it to the octopus!"
was the cry. But the governor side- '
stepped any reference to the anti-cor
poration fight and confined himself to re
citing the glories of Minnesota.

BANK TAX
IS BOOSTED
CAPITAL, SURPLUS, UNDIVIDED
PROFITS AND BORROWED
MONEY LIABLE
RATHER SWEEPING DECISION
Commissioner of Internal Revenue
Interprets the Law to Apply
to All Money Used In
the Bnsiness
RULE IS SHARP AND CLEAR
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—The commis
sioner of internal revenue has rendered
a decision in which he holds that bank
ers must return for taxation capital, sur
plus, undivided profits and borrowed
money used in the business of banking.
.The commissioner holds that capital Is
taxable, whether Invested, as in the case
of the United States bonds or the bank
building, or circulating, as in the case
of money, including money borrowed;
also surplus, including undivided profits.
"In providing that surplus shall be in
cluded as capital," the decision says, "it
is obviously the purpose of the law to
have the tax imposed apply to all money
used or employed by banks, as capital,
in carrying on their business.
"Money borrowed by banks, and used
as capital, is held to be taxable, and it
is clearly no less lia"ble to tax because
of the fact that it is borrowed by a bank
from its own undivided profits.
"The fact that surplus so used consists
wholly or in part of undivided profits, or
that such undivided profits have or have
not been formally set apart for such use,
seems wholly immaterial, so far as the
purpose of the act is concerned. It is
ti.e use, and not the authority to use,
that brings such profits within the tax
ing provisions of tne act.
"Banks should, tnerefore, return for
(axatlon the. capital, the surplus fund,
their undivided profits or other profit and
loss account, except so much thereof as
nay be actually necessary and has been
set apa*4 to meet ascertained liabilities
and losses, or to pay dividends actually
declared by the directors of the bank, to
pay taxes, or to pay fixed annual
charges, such as salaries and other nec
essary annual expenses."

PLAN OF ACTION OUTLII7ED
Special to The Globe.
CHICAGO. 111, Dec. 4.-"I am prepar
ed to stand l>y every statement I havo
made," said Gov. Van Sant, of Minne
sota, in specking of his attitude in the
proposed consolidation of the Northern
Pacific and Grout Northern railways. "I
came here to sec the .stock show," he
continued, "an.l for nothing eise. Hie
period of talk is past; the period of no
tion has arrived. We will act imme
diately; you may be sure of" that 1 have
not called an extra session of the legisla
ture, and cannot say now when it will
be done, or whether or not it will be Uono
at all. We will follow the trail lhat
seems to promise best results. Wo shall
not stand still.
"This proposed combine moans robbery.
There is no other thing to be said about
it. Our people are opposed to it. Our
law is plain against it. My oath of o"
--fice compels my course. What I havo
done has been alone from a sense of duty
and right; what I shall do will be dic
tated by right. I *ould assume no other
position, having in view the sanctity of
my oath. I understand that the movers
in the project say that there is no law
against it, and that they will succeed.
Well, they can't do it. They will not
make one those parallel and competing
lines, obviating their natural rivalry and
fixing wrongful rates—not while 1 am
governor.
"I have not been approached with an
offer of compromise. I have heard ot
no compromise. So far as I know, there
has been no thought of compromise—
certainly not by those who have the
safety and well being: of Minnesota in
their charge. We think that we see our
way clear, and we shall follow that way.
'"We have three ways of reaching these
men, and, if necessary, every way will
be tried. Our railroad and warehouse
commission has the power to fix rates.
It may, if it sees fit, enact a prohibitory
tariff on all classes of goods, and force
the combiners to do legitimate business.
"We have a law which expressly pro
hibits the combination of parallel lines.
The Northern Pacific and the Great
Northern are parallel. Good lawyers
seem to Question the scope of this law.
I shall .cpnsult with the Minnesota at
torney general about It. If he is doubt
ful about it. I can call the legislature in
extra session, and that body can make a
law .which will fit this particular In
stance. Within the state lines of Min
nesota the Northern Pacific and Great
Northern interests will not weid."
Gov. Van S:\nt loft Chicago tonight for
his old home in lowa, where he «sill pay
a visit to his aged father.
