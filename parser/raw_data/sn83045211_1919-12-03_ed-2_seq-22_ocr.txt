for American Investors
As this is the richest
country in the world,
the European nations
associated with us in
the war, as well as for
eign corporations, nat
urally look to us to help
finance them during the
reconstruction period.
Because of exchange
rates and the demand
fbr capital, inducements
are offered which are
without parallel in the
history of finance in
connection with conser
vative securities.

New York, Dec a. Further Improve
ment in prices was scored In today's
slock market ns a result of continued
covering of shorts and what was said
to he frro reinvestment hujing. The.
tipmarking of tlook values mine In for
more notice because of the further de
moralization In the foreign exchange
market. While theie ivns an appreci

the trading continued lnrgrly of n pro
fessional caliber.
Technics inffueme apparently ex
erted greater nffect than outside con
ditions. Superficially, however, the
mnrket had nil the appearances of cut
ting looe from the restraint of the fac
tors which have held speculative en
thusinsm in check since the curbing of
tlw recent boisterous bull movement.
The ncilte coal strike situation was
wholly ignored. The Mexican troubles
were seemingly ontltcl.i forgotten. Over
night consideration of the Prcsidcut's
message found favorable points which
were overlooked jostorday. At least what
disappointment wax felt concerning the
omission of some definite piograui for
cither the Peace Treaty or the railroad
tinildrin, wns modified hv the encoinng
ing hope thnt these mutters would he
treated coinprohriisivcl.1 In subsequent
messages to Cougies on these purlieu
lar subjects.
Possibly the greater amount of rn
intirm.flmrnl wns furnished in the grow
ing impression of n material wising of
ulntlve accounts vlilually completed, the
universal law of suppi.v nnd demnml
brought the markel to n position where

J OFFERINGS WERE LIMITED
, New York, Dec S. The New imk
I Kvening Sun's closing finaneial review
I today says:
Todav's stock market was consistently-
strong, but the character nnd
source of the buying was a mutter for
conjectuie. It was impossible to deter-
mine definitely whether the impulse
1 came from the supposedly large short
interest, from those who. having sold to
i establish losses for the federal tax rc
1 turn, were buying back nt what they
quite rightly regarded ns low prices or
, from a general public weary of inne
1 tion and curious to test the assertion
that the market has been heavily over
sold. It may be that the forward swing of
some 2 to t or fi points lcflceted buying
I initiative from all three sources, ltijl
with it all trading was of very modest
proportions, as nffeiings were limited.
I'udcr these 'conditions a little push
created considerable momentum, nnd it
'was too easy to develop an exaggerated
I idea of buying power
I Perhaps the most telling market fac
tor was the secretary of the treasury's
elaboration of what the President
i touched on in his message to Congress
respecting tax revision and foreign
financing. Mr. Olnss's recommendations
in his annunl report called for lower
J excess profits levies and, if necessary,
higher actual taxes.
Ilo made it clear, however, that noth-
iug could be done along that line until
1 it was established that government e--
penditurcs were not exceeding or con-
l sinning nrcscnt receipts. lie was equally
explicit concerning the financing of Ku-
lui'u n n .-.to. , .

tious should peek out trade opportuni
ties, that financing of foreign trade
should come from privato sources nud
not governmental, was merely a reitera
tion of the government's attitude nl
ready alluded to in the recent Fciicial
Reserve Board bulletin, an.d expressly
stated as the Washington policy in
Congress. This would Feem to iiceoimt
for the irritation felt when the Presi
dent failed to make any reference te the
pence treaty in his communifiition of
jestcrday to the Congress.
Ilnth business men and bunkers feel
the handicap of the absence of n positive
position in our foreign relations with
no immediate prospect of such n po
sition except the possibility of the
Senate declaring by lesolution that n
state of war has romp to an end This

Price movements In the local stock
market were Irregulnr, but In most
cases the variations were routined with
in the smallest fractional limits. Elec
tric Htorngo Haltery nnd United (las
Improvement were the exceptions. The
lack nf confirmation of yesterday's ex
travagant rumors concerning the divi
dend action by the Hlcclrlc Storage lint
tcry directors today was responsible for
the ?5 drop In that stock during the
early trading. After recovering the loss
tho stock wns neglected the balance of
the day, because of (he genernl dispo
sition to defer further commitments un
til after the meeting of the board which
was scheduled for lute this nfternoon.
United (!ns Improvement after ruling
firm at small fractional advance diir
iug most of the morning ran into fresh
liquidation In the nfternoon cniising it
decline of $1 from Cnj to C2Vj.
The more active dealings were sup
plied by Lake Superior Corporation
with a turnover, of approximately 1!I)00
shares with a rnngc of ouly n "i be
tween 20 and 20',.
Otherwise the denlings in the local
stocks were of the same desultory char
acter, with indifferent ehnuges. Phila
delphia Klectrle was unchanged at 2ln,.
Philadelphia Traction was again ab
sorbed at 02. York Hallways preferred,
on smnll dealings, dropped 7i5 crnts from
the previous sale to UO'i- Philadelphia
Itapld Transit was n shade higher nL
20.
General Asphalt common came In for
considerable at tent Ion in the second'
hour of the trading by reason of n sen
sational jump of ?l.'!,7r to 12.1. Tim
movement, however, wits of no locul sig
nificance since the wide advance ivns
merely an adjustment of price, closer to
the New York curb quotation, which at
present Is flic principal market for the
stock.
Attention of the local finaiicinl com
munity is more or less occupied nt the.
moment its to the character of the new
financing by the Philadelphia Klcctric
('o. nnd fulled Gas Improvement Co.
Willie nothing tangible is yet oblui'n
ablc. It is generally understood nego
tiations are already under way to pro
vide for the inntiirity of the notes of
both of these corporations, which fait
due in February. It Is the consensus
of opinion in bunking circles, in view
of the high money market tension, ar
rangements will probably be made for
a renewal of thcbc notes for nt least
another year, if not two jcars. Ity
fhnt time the return of normal condi
tions 'will permit both concerns to take
up a more permanent form of financing.
BUSINESS NOTES
V4
One of (he tilings which (he season's
vogue for green tints in women's gar
ments has done Is to bring Into unprec
edented popularity various articles of
jewelry made of real Chinese jade.
A seasonal quiet prevails In (lie local
crude rubber .market at the moment.
Prices on Brazilians arc fairly steady,
however, on the basis of 4DVi cents for
spot and afloat up-river fine. Up-river
coarse is worth SO1': cents for similar
positions, while the quotations on upper
Caucho ball Ls. 33M:(230 cents.
Whether (hey will really stick (o their
intentions after the coal strike is over
or not, reports were current in the dry
goods trade yesterday that several of
the prominent Southern manufacturers
of cotton goods are going to change
their power arrangements a order to
burn fuel oil inthe tnturc in place of
coal.
Word comes from Several representa
tive buyers of men's furnishings that
from now on tb.cy will feature fine man
ras shirts instead of silk ones. Among
the high-class stores, it is said, there
has been n gradunl turning nway from
silk shirts owing to the popularity they
have found among the lage !iurnbr of
nrtisans and laborers who are now being
paid such high wages nud are spending
