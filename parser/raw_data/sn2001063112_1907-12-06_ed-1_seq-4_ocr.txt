however, afforded opportunity to

fPoncetiilhit tbe presidential &sl&
dltloo, Mi. Martin says that tie
faVors the nomination of President
Boofcevelt for another term, and
believes tbat* the-nomination will
come to him as a public call which
he cannot consistently turn aside.
Realising the faot, however, that
the president is not a candidate for
the nomination, Mr. Martin makes
lor his second choice "tbe nomin
ation of William H. Taft as tbe one
most likely to carry forward the
policies now foremost in the public

Mr. Martin believes tbat "our tariff

next congress. Tbe tariff on lumber
and wood 'pulp should be removed
altogether, and there should be a
liberal reduction *on many manufact
ured articles where we are competing
successfully in the markets of the

Ja an absolute denial and put

Hut "churchman" seems to be
willing to let it go at that, having
sown the seed he hopes tbat the lie
will spread and that tbe truth, as is
often the case, will travel verv slowly
in its efforts to overtake it.
It must have been something of a
disappointment to the insurgent
leaders when Congressman Hall in
formed them that he was not going
to lay down for Glass, as the slate
had evidently been made. The con
gressman made the fight two years
ago. and won out and be could see
no reason wby be should be shelved
for tbe whltewasher of Codington
county. It will be a merry chase and
the change of sentiment that is
spreading over tbe state will show
that insuigents are steadily losing
ground.
Congress convened Tuesday noon
and Speaker Cannon was re-elected
to his honorable position. President
Hoosevelt presented his message of
thirty thousand words and presents
some very Important subjects for con
sideration by congress. The president
discussed the inter-state commerce
law, tbe Sherman anti-trust law,
pure food, currency, revenue, the
tariff, income tax and inheritance
tax, a general enforcement of law,
Inland waterways, public lands, and
tbe other subjects which usually
come in for attention in a oresi
dents message. Throughout his
message tbe president frequently
quotes from some of ills former mes
sages and tbev show a justification
lu nearly every case for bis position
at that time. The message is well
woith the reading from beginning
to end, for tbe Roosevelt message
takes on an individuality and a free
expression of thought that is really
wholesome.
Hans Ustrud, the superintendent
of public Instruction, wants tbe puh
lio to know rlaht now tbat he is a
candidate for renominatioo, and also
tbat lie wants to defeat Senator Kit
tredge for. reelection to tbe senate.
It means'a tight In Mlnn&bafrA
county between Mr. Kittiedge, arid
Mr. Ustrud, with tbe cbances very
strong in favor of Mr. Kittredge win
ning out. Mr. Ustrud, so far as Che
public generally knows, bas made a
good superintendent—we have beard
nothing particularly against the
gentleman's administration of tbat
office—but he reckons too strongly on
bis own popularity to defeat the
senator In Sioux Falls and Minneha
ha county. Tbe superintendent de
clares there is nothing personal In
bis opposition to tbe senator, but
tbloks be is not tbe right kln? of a
sran to represent South Dakota in
Washington, on tbe same old ground
that is brought forth by tbe insui
gent idea tbat be is opposed to tbe
oommon people. The expression Is
rather hackneyed but in the absence
of any other excuse it will serve the
purpose of tbe opposition .faction.
As one of tbe causes for Governor
Crawford's opposition to Senator
Kittredge and why he wants tbe
senator retired to private life, is
because Senator Kittredge opposed
the primary law in the legislative
session of 1905 It was a pet measure
of the governor's and be used every
possible endeavor to secure Its pass
age. Along about the same tim.e
Senator Gamble was trying to do a
little effective work to make it im
possible to pass the primary law.
The senator wrote a number of let
ters back to his political friends in
this state and urged them to "work
agalnsi. the passaue of the measure.
Last January -during the legislative
session Senator Gamble was a n
didate for le-eiection. Did anyone
hear Governor Crawford raise his
voice against the fe-election of Mi.

passage of the primary law? Not a
syllable. Did Governor Crawford
snow—so far as

That Luke Fallon was superintend

was not ,-w
guc greatness. The littl» branch road
from Greenville to Bay Shore was Inn
forty miles in length and important
only in the summer season, when t!ie
trunk line to which it was a feeder
loaned It another engine, and there
were two trains a day each way for
the benefit of the boarders at summer
cottages on Bay I'oint aud the guests
at the big hotel 011 the shore.
Fallon was also statiou master, hag
gage ana express agent and the entire
executive force of the road, most of
which was owned by stockholders In
the L. and V., the trunk line. Sadie
Fallon was ticket agent and train dis
patcher, and Martin Red way was not
only engineer of the one locomotive,
but was master mechanic, superintend
ent of lolliug stock and most of the
things that Fallon was not. Almost ev
ery one was more than one officer on
the G. a-ad B. S. with the exception of
Willie Fnrrell, who was station agent
at Farrell's. He was just station agent
of the little (lag stop, the "station" be
ing a well mown patch of grass beside
the track In summer and a well shov
eled place in the snow in the vlnter
season. The lawn mower and the snow
shovel were Willie's only tools of trade,
but he bore his dignity as seriously as
did those who held a multiplicity of of
fices. Most of the employees of the
road nuule up in dignity what Ihey
lacked in importance.
Then came the strike. I!edway loung
ed into the little station at the shore
end of the run, while his fireman took
the engine down to the one stall round
house. Fallon looked up at his ap
proach.
"What's the news down to Green
ville?" lie demanded as he reached out
S'-'LLi: T| (M
Tl.fA &
"IT'S AIJj BIGHT, MABTt" BITE ni T.T.an
gnarled hand for the train messaged
Red way had brought.
"•Nothing much," said Redway Indo
lently. "I e'pose you beard that there
was
a big utrike out west?"
"I was informed of that fact," said
Fallon, with dignity. "There will be
no trouble this side of Chicago."
"I was calculating to get out that
way this fall." said Redway. with an
assumption of carelessness that his
twitching lips belied. "Sarlle and I
was talking it over. She wants to vee
the Yellowstone park on her wedding
trip."
"Sadie and you':" retorted Fallon.
"And since when have you and Sadie
had it all fixed to get married? 'Pears
to me that her pa ought to have some
thing to toy about it."
"This is where you say." explained
Redway.. "We fixed it up last night,
but I didn't have time to-talk to yoi.
this morning. The engine.needed nome
fixln' up."
"v. ell. 1 say 'No!'" was the decided
response. "1 guess Sadie can do bet
ter than an engineer when she wants
to get married."
"I'm muster mechanic, too." reminded
Redway hopefully.
"Sadie can do better," repeated Fal
Ion as he rose .to put some papers in
the safe. "Don't let me hear any more
of- this."
"Redway sat in silence until the safe
was locked and the lights put out then
he followed Fallon out on the platform.
"Better think it over," he advised.
"I'll ask you again in the morning."
Redway turned away down one of
the almost deserted streets, and Fallon
stamped angrily in the opposite direc
tion.
Not even Sadie realized how proud her
father was of his position as superin
tendent oven of such an unimportant
road as the G. and B. S. That the
daughter of the superintendent should
be asked to wed a common .engineer
w«.s a thing not to be heard of. He
had uo talk with Sadie on the matter,
but as he lay in bed thinking it over
his auger grew, and he became more
firm in his determination not to give
his consent.
He was at the station early in the
morning, affecting not to notice how
red Sadie's eyes were from weeping,
•s soon as Redway .stuck his head
into the general office Fallon began:
"You needn't come in," he rasped
out. "My mind ain't any different
from what It was last night."
Redway grinned and withdrew, shut
ting the door. Fallon fidgeted at the*
desk, making a feeble pretense of
working, but when the hands of the
clock drew around to S aud the en
gine had not puffed down the track to
couple to tbe train Fallon went out on
the platform.
Redway was sitting 011 the baggage
truck puffing at his cigar. Several pas
sengers paced the platform, aud both
of the day coaches were about half
filled.
"Where's the engine?" demanded
Fallon. Redway moved.his cigar that
he might grin the broader.
"I'm 011 a strike," he explained. "The
engine's in the house."
"Strike!" shouted Fallon. "What you
strikin' about? You had a raise last
spring!"
"It's not about money," explained the
engineer. "I saw Sadie last night, and
she says she won't marry me until you
say she can. I'm on strike until you
give the 'go ahead' order."
Fallon glared impotently. There was
no one else in town who could run an
engine except Sim Dugau. who fired
for Redway. Sim was sitting 011 the
truck by his boss aud only smiled
pleasantly when Fallon offered him
double and even triple pay to take the
train out. Some of the passengers
crowded about to watch the fun, aud
In the end the superintendent beat a
retreat to his office, where presently he
wired to Greenville for help.
But Greenville was unsympathetic.
Something of Redway's plan the office
knew, and Fallon's pompousness had
not made friends for him. Greenville
declared flatly that they could spare
neither engine nor engineer, and when
the division headquarters was appeal
ed to Fallon was told to settle the
matter himself. In theory the G. and
B. S. was an Independent road, with
its own corporate entity, and head
quarters was not interested in its af
fairs. Several heavy wrecks had filled
the re :::ir shops with locomotives, and
there were r.ot enough to properly
equip the division, to say nothing 01*
loaning one to so unimportant a branch
line.
In desperation Fallon wired the main
offices of the L. and V., and their reply
was even more curt. The western strike
was growing worse, and the message
suggested that if Fallon could not man
age without the assistance of the en
tire system a strike of one engineer he
had better resign and let the office boy,
if he had one, take charge.
All this took time, and the station
was filled with the intending travelers,
who were anxious to start upon their
journey. The cause of the strike had
been whispered about, and the passen
gers took turns coming to the general
office, which was also the baggage
room, and demanding that the strike
be broken and communication restored.
Fallon grew desperate. Hardy, one
Of the heaviest stockholders of tbe
h. and V., had been born in Bay Side,
and his summer cottage over on the
point was always open to bis old ac
quaintances when the owner was there.
If the story should reach Hardy
through complaint on the part of one
of the town people, there might be
trouble. With a gesture of despair he
opened the door and called Sadie into
consultation.
"See If you can't fix things up," he
pleaded. "Don't give In unless you
have to, but as a last resort—well, 1
suppose 111 have to let you marry
him."
With a hug and a kiss, Sadie darted
to the window and threw up the sash.
"Ifa all right. Mart!" she called. "I'll
ride down with you and get the ring."
"I told jou as a last resort," groaned
Fallon. "You might have talked him
out of the strike."
"Small chance of that," laughed the
girl as from the roundhouse came the
puff of the exhaust. "As official strike
breaker of the road 1 saw long a go
that only complete surrender would be
effective."
"Strike breaker!" grunted Fallon.
•'There would have been another
strike in the morniug," she explained.
"The telegraph department and the
train dispatcher were going out in
sympathy."
"It's darned little sympathy you
have," growled Fallon. "What do you
suppose Hardy will say if lie hears of
this?"
"He promised me a weddiug present
if I broke the strike," explained the
girl calmly. "He wired this morning
to know what the trouble was. and 1
told liini."
I'or a moment Fallon pondered the
situation, then he rose to his feet, with
a sigh.
"Thpre won't be any more strikes,"
he said. "It's all in the family now."
Why She Sang the Hymn.
A well known bishop relates that
while 011 a recent visit to the south he
was in a small country town where,'
owing to the scarcity of good servants/
most of the ladies preferred to do their
own work. He was awakened quite
early by the tones of a soprano voice
singing "Nearer, My God, to Thee."
As the bishop lay in bed he meditated
upon the piety which enabled his host
ess to go about her task early in the
morning singing such a noble hymn.
At breakfast he spoke to her about It
and told her how pleased he was.
"Oh, law." she replied, "that's tne
hymn I boil the eggs by—three verses
for soft and Ave for hard-"—Judge's
Library.

"So you think his intentions are sen
