A PIONEER GONE
0. T. Byland of San Jose Has Passed
Away
SAN JOSE, Dec. B.—Hon. Calus Taci
tus Ryland dted this afternoon In his
Sixty-third year. He left a widow and
children to mourn his loss. In his death
a notable figure, a pioneer and widely
known and conspicuous citizen passes
away.
C. T. Ryland was born In Missouri, and
at an early age came to California and
eventually settled in this county. He
was a lawyer and an enrgetlc business
man, engaging with success in various
enterprise. He accumulated a large
fortune and was one of the rich men
of the county. The Ryland block, prob
ably the handsomest in this city, was
built and owned by him. He leaves other
valuable real estate holdings, as well as
large values In personal property. He
had been for years a large holder of
local hank stock, and until he retired
from active business, participated in the
management. He married a daughter of
one of California's first governors, Bur
nett. John W. Ryland, who Is now post
master, having been appointed by Pres
ident Cleveland, Is his son. At one time
C. T. Ryland was one of the most active
lawyers of this bar, but his large busi
ness interests caused him to withdraw
from the practice of his profession. His
death removes one of the very few of
those hardy spirits which connected the
pioneer days with the present, and he
■will be sincerely regretted by a large
circle of relatives and friends. He had
been in failing halth for some time,

SESSION
Will Open for Business at
Noon Today
LITTLE EXCITEMENT AROUSED
AS ALL THE PLACES HAVE BEEN
GIVEN OUT
Advocates of Cuban Recognition ana
Hawaiian Annexation Must Pos
sess Their Souls In Patience
Associated Press Special Wire.
WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—The regular,
or long, session of congress, as It Is call
ed, because there Is no constitutional
limitation upon the period of its dura
tion, opens at noon* tomorrow. The
leaders, and a large majority of the
members of both houses, are here to par
ticipate in the opening ceremonies, and
President McKlnley has made the Jour
ney to Washington from the bedside of
his dying mother, that his absence might
not delay the national legislature at Its
assemblage.
The extra session robs the opening of
the regular session of the excitement and
Interest which usually attaches to it.
On the evening of a regular session or
dinarily Washington thrills with excite
ment. The hotel lobbies surge with
place-hunters In the wake of the various
candidates for speaker, clerk, doorkeep
er, etc., the members are struggling
for committee assignments, and the
air is full of rumors of plots and counter
plots. But as the house was completely
organized at the extra session, and all
the committee assignments made then,
beyond the natural stimulus produced
by the returning statesmen, the regular
hangers-on of legislation and the out
lining of schemes by members of this
"third house," or lobby, Washington to
night is tranquil.
HOUSE PROGRAM
The program at the house tomorrow
Is very simple, and beyond the spectac
ular show which It offers to the curious,
has, in Itself, little attraction. The house
will be called to Crder by the speaker;
who, after the chaplain* invocation.
wBl direct the clerk to call the roll.
- This having been accomplished, and
the presence of a quorum demonstrated,
the clerk will be directed to notify the
senate that the house is ready for busi
ness, and a committee will be appointed
to wait on the president. After that
there will be a recess to await the ar
rival of the president's annual message,
which will be read upon Its inception, and '
be followed by an adjournment until
Tuesday.
It is the intention of the house leaders
to proceed with the business of the ses
sion as rapidly as possible. The com
mittees will begin their labors this week,
and as all of them have more or less bill?
on hand, which were Introduced at thf
extra session, there will be no lack of
material for the house to work on after
the committee hoppers have begun to
grind. The appropriations committee
has been at work for ten days, and
Chairman Cannon expects to pass at
least two of the regular budgets beforo
the holidays—the legislative, executive
and Judicial, and the pension appropria- 1
tlon bills. One or the other of these '
bills, It is expected, will be reported on 1
Wednesday, and the end of the week
promises to see the house down to busl- :
ness.
Among the early general measures to
receive consideration will be the bank
ruptcy bill. Whether It will be the Nel
son bill, which passed the senate at the
last session, or a modification of the Tor
rey bill, depends upon the temper of the
Judiciary committee, which will submit
the measure to the house.
Beyond doubt there will be several
resolutions of Inquiry during the first
week, which may be more or less sen
sational, and some of the radical pro-,
Cuban advocates will attempt to get
consideration for a Cuban resolution be
fore the foreign affairs committee can
act. Congressman Livingston of Geor
gia is one of these. But owing to the
nature of the house rules, all these hasty
efforts will prove abortive, and the meas
ures will probably take their course.
THE SENATE SESSION
There will be nothing except indispo
sition on the part of the members to
prevent the senate entering upon its
work with the convening of the senate
tomorrow, as there Is a calendar already
made for It, with about thirty bills re
ported from committees during the spe
cial session. If any circumstance should
prevent the receipt of the president's
message on Monday, the probabilities
are that the senate will adjourn over
without taking up any other business
until the message could be received.
With the message read, it will remain
with the senate to decide am to whether it
shall seriously enter upon the work of
the session after Monday or begin a
system of delay intended to throw all
Important questions over beyond the
holidays. The Indications are now for a
little more activity than usual during the
pre-hollday session. This Is largely due
to the fact that the supporters of the
administration and advocates of annex
ation are very anxious to secure the
earliest possible consideration of the
treaty with Hawaii. Senator - Davis,
chairman of the committee on foreign
relations, announces his purpose of
pressing annexation at the earliest pos
sible moment, but it is probable that the
matter will not be taken up seriously
until the committee can have a meeting
to deolde on the details of procedure
The committee will be called together
Wednesday for this purpose. On* point
which the committee will be called upon
LOS ANGELES, MONDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 6, J897
to decide is whether to proceed to ratify
the treaty of annexation or to annex the
Islands by resolution. The annexation
ists have lost some votes during the va
cation, and there Is now apprehension
that, the two-thirds vote necessary to
assure* the ratification cannot be se
cured.
No satisfactory canvass la possible un
til all the senators arrive, and If It is
then made manifest that the necessary
two-thirds vote cannot be secured. It Is
likely that the proceeding by means of
resolution, which would require only a
majority vote, will be Inaugurated.
Some members of the foreign relations
committee who favor admission advocate
this course, because they see no reason
for traversing the same ground twice,
as they would be compelled to do In
case the matter should be first considered
In executive session, fail there, and then
be taken up in the form of a resolution
in open senate and house.
The immigration bill for which Sen
ator Lodge stands sponsor is practically
at the head of the senate legislative cal
endar and will be considered early in
the session. Senator Lodge today re
peated his Intention of pressing the bill,
but he will not antagonise the Hawaiian
treaty with it
The first bill on the calendar is Sen
ator Gear's measure providing for the
adjustment of the Pacific railroad debt,
but the sale of the Union Pacific doubt
less will have the effect of causing the
temporary withdrawal of this bill and
the substitution of others.
Of the 300 bills on the calendar about
200 are private pension bills, and all of
these probably will be disposed of at
one sitting when taken up. There are
also several hundred recess appoint
ments to be considered In executive
session. It Is not probable that much
will be done in the way of legislation
the present week. There will be an ad
journment on the day after receiving
the message on Monday, and as there Is
no disposition to press the Hawaiian
matter until the foreign relations com
mittee agrees upon a line of action, the
indications now are that it will not be
taken up In the senate before next week.
Mckinley arrives
President McKinley, accompanied by
Assistant Secretary Day, arrived in
Washington at 7:45 o'clock this morn
ing. He was met by Secretary Alger,
Secretary Bliss and his secretary and
driven to the White House. The pres
ident had received two telegrams en
route from Canton reporting the con
dition of his mother, but he was anxious
for later news. In the middle of the
forenoon a message was received from
Abner McKinley at Canton saying that
the president's mother was resting in
about the same condition as when he
left. She might last through the day, or
even one or two days longer, but was
liable to die at any moment.
Arrangements have been made for
the return trip to Canton tomorrow
evening. The president, Mrs. McKinley
and a party of half-dosen close friends
and relatives will leave Washington at
7 o'clock on a special car attached to
the regular Pennsylvania train, arriv
ing in Canton at 10 o'clock Tuesday
morning.
ONE QUESTION SETTLED
It was officially announced at the
White House today on the return of the
president to Washington that Oov. John
Griggs of New Jersey has been ten
dered and has accepted the office of at
torney-general of the United States
which will be vacated by the nominatloi
of Attorney-General McKenna to be
associate Justice of the United States

General Pellieux Lends Aid to Ru

ROME, Dec. s.—General Pellleux, min
ister of war, maintains the attitude he
has taken up in consequence of the ac
tion of parliament in amending the bill
dealing with army promotions against

tion. ,
King Humbert, the Marquis dl Rudlnl,

SCHROEDER SETTLED
Takes a Chair in the Academy at
Muenster
BERLIN, Dec. 6.—Right Rev. Mgr.
Schroeder, late professor of dogmatic
theology of the Catholic university at
Washington, has been appointed by the
ecclesiastical affairs to the faculty of the
Catholic academy at Muenster, capital
of Westphalia.
Mgr. Schroeder's resignation cf his
professorship at Washington was placed
In the hands of the board of directotrs
part of October, the board recei\ed it
on the understanding that he would be
permitted to remain at the university
until the end of the scholastic year,
when the resignation would take effect,
unless he should sooner find auither
post.
The period of grace was given him in
order that he might communicate with
the Peruvian minister of education and
arrange for a professorship In some Ger
man university.
At the time Mgr. Schroeder said that
he had earnestly wished to resign dur
ing his last vacation and had been ad
vised by his physician to do so, but that
he returned to the university because the
holy father had advised him to take that
course. The board of directotrs, there
fore, left the final decision of the matter
to the pope, after an official expression
of its "regrets at the many charges
against Mgr. Schroeder in this connec
tion."
RAPIER'S REASONS
For Refusing to Cease to Be Post-
master at Mobile
MOBILE, Ala., Dec. 6.—Postmaster
Rapier, whose successor has been ap
pointed by President McKinley but who
declines to surrender his office, contends
that the section of the revised statutes
under which second-class postmasters
are appointed provides in terms that
such postmasters are appointed for the
term of four years and can bo removed
by the president only, and with the ad
vice and consent of the senate. The
president on the Ist of October gave to
P. D. Barker, a Republican, a commis
sion as Rapier's successor. Barker, who
was out of the city, did not return until
recently, and, on the Ist of December,
demanded of Postmaster Rapier the sur
render of the office. Mr. Rapier claims
he received no notice of his removal ac
cording to law and will not surrender the
office until the legality of his removal
has been passed on by the courts. Bark
er, the new appointee, was postmaster
at Mobile during the Harrison adminis
tration and served his full term of four
years.

Associated Press Special Wire.
CANTON, Dec. 6.—Mother McKinley
has passed the fourth day of her illness
and enters upon the fourth night with
the spark of life still burning dimly.
There has not been a material develops
merit in her case today. Her condition
has continued one of steady wasting
away. The family watched by the bed
side all day, prepared for the end at any
moment and sometimes feeling that it
had come, as the patient was seized with
sinking spells such as was yesterday
mistaken for a second stroke of paral
ysis. During these attacks she would
perceptlably weaken, almost cease to
breathe and show scarcely a sign of an
imation. For the most part these spells
were limited to half an hour, and when
they were over she would resume the
quiet repose characteristic of the entire
Illness. About the middle of the after
noon, however, a more serious sinking
spell occurred and lasted two hours.
Several times those keeping vigil
thought the last flutter of life's flame
had come. The attack passed away at
last, leaving the patient almost the same
as before it occurred.
There is a possibility that she may
survive the night or even longer, but
those who have been at the bedside most
constantly have the least hope of such
a result. Communication was estab-
lished with the White House as soon as
the president arrived there and a tele
graph wire is constantly open to Wash
ington to advise the president of every
occurrence in the sick room. Besides
this, he had several times talked with
his brother, Abner McKinley, by tele
phone.
Dr. Phillips, the attending physician,
had a number of calls during the day..
This evening he said he could report
nothing new. There had been no notable
change in the patient during the day.
She had continued to grow weaker In
the same manner and at about the same
rate as during the past few days. He was
satisfied that this condition would pre
vail to the end. Asked as to the pros
pects of her surviving the night, he
said: "Yes, there is a possibility of her
living till morning. Indeed, I am in
clined to think she will. But she has
been sinking so long that no one could
make a prediction for the future with
any assurance of certainty. The case
is one in which we must be prepared for
the end at any moment. There will be
no rally, no more conscious periods, no
final struggle."
The patient has taken no nourishment
since Thursday. It cannot be admin
istered by ordinary methods, and the
case is one in which heroic methods of
administering food are not regarded as
justifiable.
A THEATER FIGHT
Leaves Lincoln's Leading Theater
Almost Dismantled
LINCOLN, Neb., Dec. s—The Lansing
theater, the leading playhouse In the
city, was this morning before daylight
dismantled of most of its inside furnish
ings, almost a riot accompanying the
work, and as a result J. S. Lansing, half
owner, L. C. Burr and Roscoe Pound, hla
attorneys, and a score of laborers, were
today arrested. The trouble is the out
come of the sale of the property under
foreclosure a week ago. Mr. Lansing
claimed that there was a conspiracy to
defraud him out of his holdings.
The district court, however, confirmed
the sale on Saturday and declared the
title vested In the purchaser, Wm.
Oliver of New York. Between 2 and *
oclock Lansing, his attorneys and a
number of stage hands, gained entrance
and began to remove scenery and chairs.
Agents of Oliver were notified, and In
the controversy which followed there
was a personal collision between attor
neys of the rival claimants. The police
quelled the disturbance about the time
it began to be interesting. Later war
rants were sworn out and the Lansing
party was arrested, being released un
ball.
Southern Prairie Fires
GUTHRIE, Ok., Dec. 6. —Last night a

swept with lightning speed. It was an
exciting night among the farmers, who
fought like demons to preserve their
crops, the women and children assist

fire but only after serious loss had been
entailed. Many tales of narrow escapes
are told.
