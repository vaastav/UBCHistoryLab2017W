THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT
TaiAii OP Ku KLUX OASES.-TUESDAY,
December 5.-The court convened st
10?? A.M., Hon. Hugh L. Bond and
Hon. George S. Bryan presiding.
The case of the united States va. Allen
Orosby et at., for conspiracy against
Amzi Bainey, end for burglary under
the Acts of Congress of May 31, 1870,
and April 20, 1871, was resumed. Mr.
Stanberry, for the defence, handed in
his authorities, and spoke at some
length in explanation of the grounds of
bis motion to qaash the indictment flied
and argued yesterday. Ho read from
Wharton's American Griminal Law, vol.
3, page 2,290 and page 2,849, the deci?
sion of the Court for the Correction of
Errors in the case of Lambert es. the
People, 9 Gowan, 678, and other authori?
ties, showing that in indictments for
conspiracy, the means by whioh the un?
lawful act was perpetrated should be set
forth, the names of the parties injured,
&o., and that in the present indictment,
such means at least should be alleged aa
would reasonably prevent a person from
exercising the right of suffrage.
Mr. Chamberlain, for the prosecution,
replied in support of the indictment SB
made, taking np eaoh ground of excep?
tion in its order. As to the first ground
of exoeption-that the conspiraos
charged is to violate thc first section of
the Act of May 81, 1870, whioh section
defines no crime or offence and forbids
nothing-he stated that it was through
no disrespect to the eminent counsel for
the defence, but that really it was impos?
sible for him to discern any force in the
exoeption. It would seem, from thc
argnment of the counsel, that every sec?
tion of an Act should contain a prohibi?
tion and affix a penalty to render it
effectual. Suob, however, is not the
caso. Sections are bat arbitrary and
artificial divisions of un entirety, and are
to be considered not singly, but in con?
nection with other seotions with whiob
they are combined. Nothing is more
common in legislative enactments than
that prior sections should assert rights,
declare duties, &c, and some final sec?
tion affix a penalty. In the present in?
stance, tho first section defines tho right
and the sixth section provides a mode el
punishment for a violation of the first.
As to the 8eaoud exoeption-that tho
names of tho parties are not set forth
the answer to that was, that it was unne?
cessary to set forth names ia an indict?
ment for conspiracy. 3d Greenleaf on
Evidence, seo. 89, also in 2d Bussell on
Urimos, page 679, it is shown that in au
indictment for conspiring together on a
certain day, through falso rumors, to
raise the price of the public funds, thc
indictment was held good, though the
oames of the parties injured wero not
?amed. Also in the case of the Com?
monwealth vs. Judd, 2d Mass., page 329,
tin indiotment for conspiring together to
manufacture and sell, with a fraudulent
intent, a base and spnrions compound ss
genuine indigo, was held good, though
the parties injured were col named. The
ubjeots of a conspiracy may be tho pub
no generally, a oertain class or an indi?
vidual. In the case of the Common?
wealth vs. Harlem, 7th Metcalf, an aver?
ment that the parties indioted conspired
to defraud, it was held not supported h?
proof that B, or the public generally,
uave been defrauded, but that tho in'
dtotment would havo been sustained,
had it been alleged that the public gene
rally were intended to be defrauded. Ii
our indiotment, we have not taken tht
latitude allowed us, but instead o
obargiug the fraud against the p ubi ii
generally, as is legitimate, have shoul
dered an additional burden by ohargini
the fraud as against various male citizen
of African descent, whioh allegation wi
propose to sustain by proof.
To the third objeotion to the firs
oonnt, that the means by whioh the un
lawful prevention was effected are no
set forth, the answer was also that it wa
unnecessary. 3d Greenleaf on Evidence
section 95-Where the intontioo is iile
gal, the means to accomplish it are no
necessary. 2d Bussell on Grimes, pag
691, allowa that in an indictment th
words "did conspiro by indirect means
were considered os surplusage, as als
ihe words "by devices, pretences an
auntie means."
Mr. Stanberry-The gentleman doesn
seem to understand the point raised b
the defence here. The statute readi
"if any person shall, by threats, intim
dation and violence," &c, which facti
we claim, it is necessary to allege.
Mr. Chamberlain-The sixth sectio
under whioh this indictment is laid read
"If two or more persons shall band (
conspire together," Seo. No means ai
stated, and none need be alleged. Tl
counsel reads from the fifth sectioi
which refers simply to individuals, ac
has no reference to a conspiracy. As I
the objeotion that no specific electic
was named, we reply that Amzi Bairn
had a right to vote at any and all ele
tious. The offence is a general on
Conspiracy is defined as a oombinatic
or agreement of two or more perBons, 1
concerted means, to do an unlawful nt
or to do a lawful aot by unlawful mean
The conspiracy need never have bei
effected, but the simple intent, by co
oerted means, to deprive Amzi Kain
o? the right to vote at any election ?h?
soever complotes the crime.
As to the fifth objection, that the qti
lifioations of said male citizens to vc
are not set forth. This conspiracy,
we have already stated, is a statato
offence, and the indiotment bas to
drawn nnder tho statute. It becom
important here to refer to somo ru!
From 1st Bishop, in criminal procedo
sect. 359, we read that where offence
purely statutory, having no reference
common laws, it is sufficient to obargo
the essential words of the statute. Tl
is a purely statutory offence. Not tl
conspiracy is but a conspiracy to viol;
the provisions of the 1st section of 1
Aot is, and it is sufficient when we chin
in the essential words of the Aot. 1
statutory offence is in theso wor
"Shall conspiro or band together to \
late the provisions of this Aot," and
have only put a burden on ourselves
osiog the words to deprive oertain m
oitizens, of African descent, of the f
exercise of the right of suffrage;
words aro unnecessary in themseli
and we are, therefore, not required
state the qualifications of the votere
State vs. Oonld, 31 New Hampshire, li
1st Bishop on criminal law, 373; Ea
oase, 2d Lewie, 133. The great i
general answer to all tho foregoing
jeotions is that we are indicting undi
statute, and charge a violation of
provision of the 1st section ; and oil
ditional allegations, suoh as that the ]
ties injured were malo citizens of Afri
descent are simply gratuitous, and I
den us with additional proof, but are
essential to sustain the indiotment.
much for the objections to the
count. Now, let ns oonsider the ot
tiona to the second oount. The first
jeotion here made is that it is not alleged
that Rainey was qualified tc Tots, but
simply steted that he was a citizen of the
United Stater. We say, in th? first
place, thst it substantially set forth
when we allege that he was possessed of
the right of suffrage, scoured and goa
ranteea to him ander the Constitution,
&o., and all additional qualifications are
unnecessary, for they are charged in sub?
stance when we say that he was a oitizon
lawfully qualified, &o. In the second
plaoe, we answer this is a statutory
offence-the words of the /Lot being to
conspiro together with intent to injure,
oppress, threaten or intimidate any citi?
zen of the United States in the free en?
joyment of a right and privilege gua?
ranteed by the Constitution, &o., and we .
have desoribed the offence in the worcta
oi the statute and named the person
Amzi Bainey, as a oitizen of the United
States; which is all that is required.
As to the second objection, that no
day of eleotion is named, all that we
have said in answer to a similar objeo
tion to the first count will apply.
3d. That the unlawful means are not
set forth. To this we reply, that this is
not an offence that depends upon tho
moans, the time, or agni us t what parti?
cular individual directed, but the offonce
is complete short of that, and is per?
fected whon, in tho words of tho defini?
tion, a combination or agreement is en?
tered into, by concerted means, to do an
unlawful act. It is not necessary to
name tho time of an overt aot. I would
that I could draw npon my imagination
only for a ease in hand, and were not
stating a faot that has happened in this
present year of grace. Suppose that
two or three persons should go in dis?
guise at night to the honse of a oitizen
a colored man's honse-shonld smite his
wife to tat floor, ravish his daughter be?
fore bia eyes, and, after knocking him
down, drag him out in the woods; shonld
thereafter, debating the question whe?
ther they will kill or whip him, force
him to take au oath that he will never
vote in a certain way. Now, suppose all
this, and suppose the man to be Amzi
Rainey, and shall it be deemed neces?
sary to namo a day of election? Tho
distinguished counsel say they aro not
disposed to be captious, nor to take ad?
vantage of technicalities, rind yet they
demand of us, under these circumstances,
co show at what election Amzi Kidney
was hindered in the free exorcise of the
?lectivo franchise by that oatt}. The of
fenoo was complete when he waB mado
to take the outh, if there never shonld
JO any election whatever.
As to the objection that the indictment
included a charge of burglary, whioh
was a domestic crime, and cognizable
july under the laws of the State, Mr.
?hamberhxin went on to say that he ac?
corded due force to tho argument of the
lefonce on that point, and agreed that
ibis court cannot take jurisdiction of an
iffenco against the State of South Caro
ina. Section seven of the Aot provides
chat if, in tho aot of violating the provi
lions of section 1 of the Act, any other
felony shall bo committed, the offender
theil be punished in euch manner as is
prescribed by the laws of the State for
mob crime. It was not the intention of
the Government to try for burglary, but
limply upon conviction for tho conspi?
racy, to make the penalty the same as
for burglary nuder the State laws. This
mmes very short of this count taking
cognizance of the crime of burglary.
vVe found that burglary had been com?
mitted, and set it forth in the words of
in indictment in South Carolina, not to
cry tho offence, but to serve as the mea?
turo of punishment as contemplated by
Che statute. Tho sentence will not be
for burglary, but the court will merely
refer to the laws of the State for bur?
glary, and affix that penalty to the con?
spiracy.
Tho first objeotion in the fourth oount
is, that this oount does not allege that
\mzi Rai ney was a citizen of the United
States. Thin count is drawn under the
fifth section, which reads, "any per?
ton," Sec., and not citizen of the United
States. As to the objeotion, "That it is
not alleged that ho WOB otherwise quali?
fied than by the fifteenth amendment,"
we admit that the fifteenth amendment
loes not absolutely grant any right of
suffrage, but practically and really it
loes seonre and guarantee to oolored
persons such right, and wu have simply
followed the chosen words of the Act.
Tho objections to the fifth count being
the same as to the fourth, the same re?
ply is applicable; so also the sixth and
seventh. It was objected to the eighth
aount that tho preservation of the right
to be secure in person and papers
igainst unreasonable searches, seizure,
Sro., was the provinco of the State laws.
Tho Act under which this connt was
mado, was intonded simply to enforce
the provisions of the fourteenth and fif?
teenth amendments to tho Constitution,
[f such power is vested in Congress as
we understood the honorable counsel
yesterday to admit, then we hold that
in this instance, Congress was morely
intending to protect Amzi Rainey and
otherB from unreasonable search, seiz?
ure, &o., rights guaranteed to them by
the Constitution. It is true, that per?
sonal rights are protected by the State
laws; but is it not eminently proper,
also, that Congress should enforce such
provisions of the Constitution as effect
them? Certainly it is in this inBtanoe;
for while it be true that the honorable
counsel-as he says-and I are protected
hy the State laws from personal harm, it
is equally true that Amzi Rainey was
not; and Congress has come forward and
said, we will proteot you.
The objection to the ninth count is,
that we have not specified what laws of
the equal protection of whioh Amzi
Rainey was deprived. Oar reply is, that
it is unnecessary, inasmuch as we have
charged in tho words of tho Aot.
Tho objections io tho tenth count
being tho same ns tho preceding, we |
make the samo reply.
At theoonolusion of Mr. Chamberlain's
argument, the court took a recess of
fifteen minutes. When the court re?
sumed, Mr. Corbin followed at BO tn o
length in support of tho indiotment, ex?
plaining and expounding the views ad?
vanced by his colleague. When he had
concluded, the court, at the request of
Mr. Johnson, adjourned till to-morrow,
at 10 o'olook, when Mr. Johnson will
