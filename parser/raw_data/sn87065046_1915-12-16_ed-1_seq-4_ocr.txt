WEDNESDAY, DEC. 15, 1915.
Approving the President's
Message.
The message which President !
Wilson delivered in Congress last j
week lias attracted more atten- '
tion than any other message to )
Congress during the last thirty j
years.
It is admitted bv all that the j
state papers of President Wilson :
rank very high, but none of the
others equal the last one in the
epoch making events which it in
augurated.
From every location the great
swelling j
,
chorus of approval is
wider and louder; for the coun- j s
try realizes now as newer before!
that the vast and unlimited !
wealth of this great country is
no "longer safe" without ade-!
quate defense.
The American idea of prepar-(y°
edness is to be a citizenry trained i
to arms so that if we are attack- j
1, as some of the nation of Eu
e<
rope has been attacked, we will be
ready to meet the aggressor with
trained men. President Wilson! I
is acting on the same principle asi
anv eitv, which organizes a police i tr
1 1
and fire department for the pro
tection of life and propertv.
The part of President Wilson's
methods which flays the
al citizens" that is the hyphenat-j ^
ed variefv, was most warmly ap- !
plauded by Congress. There is 1
an urgent necessitv for a law mak- j^
ing it an "net of treason" for '
any one to injure the industries j
of* this country with a view of,
conferring any kind of benefit on I
a foreign country. Congress will j
undoubtedly pass a law so dras- j
tic that the hyphenated citizens ;
which have been abusing their !
privileges in this country will be j
shot in the future and their prop-'Get
ertv confiscated if anv more a--1
tivitVis indulged in resulting in j of
or aiming at violence of any sort, 1
for the benefit of a foreign nation. !
A college professor says that ;
spanking leaves no mark except !
on the memory. Radical change!Co.,
in spanking since our day, believe j
j
No wonder so many telephone j
girls are haughty. Thev are con-iy
neeted with the very best fami
lies.

Moat Will Papal* Absorb a Lars#
Proportion of Light, According
to Çetoütiot
It your gu bills are heavy, don't
blame the dark weather or the extrav
agance of your housekeeper. Perhaps
the fault lies with the wallpaper. It is
pointed out by Prof. Syiyanus Thomp>
son,-principal of the City Technical
college, London, that much light is
wasted owing to the use on our walls
of paper which absorbs an unduly
large proportion of light
Before we can look for anything
like a sufficient return for the monoy
we spend on light, all the rich dark
tones, the deep crimson, which is so
popular for dining rooms on account
of the impression of warmth it gives,
and the various shades of brown so
much used in libraries and dens, must
be replaced by pure white or very light
shades which absorb a minimum of
light
Even when the Illumination of a
room is ample, it may be badly lit if
the walls absorb too much of that il*
lumination instead of giving it back
by diffuse reflection. Few people are
aware how much light is thus wasted
and thrown away.
The deep scarlet and crimson wall*
papers waste from 70 to 75 per cent;
brown paper wastes about 85 to 8f?
per cent; even an ordinary yellow or
buff wallpaper wastes 50 to 60 per
cent of the light for which in most
cases, a high price is paid. On the
other hand, white cartridge paper ab
sorbs and wastes only about 20 per
cent of the light, while a white-washed
wall absorbs 30 to 40 per cent
Prof. Thompson strongly recom
mends that, both for economy in arti
ficial lighting and comfort in the day
light lighting of large rooms, the ceil
ings should be invariably white, and
the walls, if not white, should at least
be of the very palest tints.

AN OLD RUSSIAN CHURCH
Remains of a Building and a Few
Relics Still Exist at Fort
Ross, Cal.
At Fort Ross, Cal., some fifty miles
north of San Francisco, there are the
very interesting remains of what was
once a church of the holy orthodox re
ligion—as the members of the eastern
or Greek church call their faith, says
the Youth's Companion. It was in
, 1809 that an expedition of the Rus
sian-American Fur company came
south from Sitka, and made a settle
ment at Bodega bay, which they
called Port Rumiantsof. Two years
later they chose a position for their
main post about twenty miles farther
north, a little beyond the Russian
river, which they called the Slavianka.
At this point, which they named Ros
or Rus. they built a fort with watch
towerf And mounted 40 cannon.
The settlement was ostensibly only
a peaceful trading post and a center
for sealing operatioiis. There was no
reason ; however, in the character of
the Indian inhabitants of the region, i
for a post c ?. such strength to hold the
territory as a Russian colony and, by
gradual settlement farther south, to
offer an effective challenge to the
claims of Spain to the coast region
north of San Francisco.
The fort was built of heavy redwood
timbers. It was about 100 yards
square and contained the quarters
of the officers and men, work
shops, warehouses, granaries, a wind
mill, and, of course, bath houses. The
population varied between 200 and
400, inclusive of some Aleuts who
were employed in the sealing and sea
otter industry. The fur business grew
to be large and very profitable. Sir
George Simpson, the governor of the
Hudson Bay company, who visited
Fort Ross in 1841, reported that up
to that time no less than 80,000 sea
otter skins alone had been taken and
marketed by the Russian-American
company. In 1813 the Russians built
a church, and there the gorgeous rit
ual of the Greek Catholic church was
conducted until the close of the Rus
sian occupation.
