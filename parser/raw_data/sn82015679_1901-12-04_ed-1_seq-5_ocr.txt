SIcKlnley- Resolution Also Adopted ly
the Senate Ofn Word of the Mes
sage Lost by Listeners.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 2 Not in many
years have the members of the House
listened with such rapt attention to the
annual message of a PresMent of the
United States as they did to-day to the
reading of the first message of President
Roosevelt. Every word was followed In
tently from the announcement of the tragic
death of President McKin'ny in the opening
sentence to the expression of the closing
wish that our relations with the world
would continue peaceful.
At the opening of th es?ion the speaker
announced the appointment of the com
mittee on rules as follows: Mr. Henderson,
cf Iowa: .Mr. Dalzcll. of Pennsylvania;
Mr. Grosvcnor, of Ohio; Mr. Richardson,
of Tennessee, and Mr. Underwood, of Ala
bama. The. only change In the committee
w:ij the substitution of Mr. Underwood
f..r Mr. Bailey, of Texas, who is now a
member of the Senate.
Major Pri'dn, assistant secretary to the
President, then appeared at the main en
trance and announced a message from the
President. The message was taken to the
speaker's desk, where Speaker Henderson
broke the seal. "A message from the Pres
ident of the United States." he said as he
handed the document to the reading clerk
and direc ted him to read It.
Ordinarily presidential messages at the
opening of a Conxress are listened to In a
perfunctory fashion, but to-day through
out the reading the keenest interest was
manifested. There was a slight murmur
of applause when In concluding the recom
mendation for legislation to put down
anarchy the clrk read "r.o matter calls
more urgently for the wisest thought of
Congress." The murmurs when this sen
tence was read was followed by a burst
of applause when the clerk read: '"The
American people are low to wrath, but
when their wrath Is once kindled it burns
like a consuming flame." Probably no
other portion of the message attracted so
much attention as that relating to trusts.
The reading occupied two hours, but not
over a dozen members left their seats un
til it was concluded. Several times there
was applause and at the conclusion there
was an enthusiastic demonstration on the
Republican side. On motion of Mr. Uros
venor that portion of the message relating
to the death of the late President was re
ferred to a committee to consist of one
member from each State to Join a similar
committee cf the Senate to consider and
reprt by what token of respect and affec
tion It may be proper for Congress to ex
press the deep sensibility of the Nation to
the tragic death of the late President.
The speaker appointed a committee headed
by Mr. Irosvfr.or. and then as a further
mark of rpect the House adjourned. Mr.
Watson is the In. liana member of the com
mittee. se te riUK i:i:m(;s.

with Interested spectators, many of them
having a special Interest In the message.
Soon after the opening Major O. 1 Prü
den, assistant secretary to the President,
was then recognized, and presented the
message, the reading of which was begun
by Henry M. Rose, chief clerk. Printed
copies cf the document were distributed
among the senators, the majority of whom
followed the reading from their copies.
The reading of the message consumed
two hours and fifteen minutes, and when
it had been completed Mr. Foraker was
recognized to offer the following resolu
tion, for which he asked immediate con
sideration: "That a committee of eleven senators
be appointed on the part of the Senate to
join stich committee as shall be appointed
on the part of the House to consider .and
report by what token of respect and af
fection It may be proper for the Congress
of the United States to express the deep
sensibility of the Nation to the tragic death
of the late President William McKinley,
and that so much of the message of the
President as relates to that deplorable
event bo referred to such committee."
The resolution was adopted and then, as
a further mark of respect to the memory
of the late President, the Senate, on mo
tion of Mr. Foraker, at 2:28 adjourned.
CANADA WANTS SKAGWAY.
Object to Use of Word "Alaska" After
the Town'n Name.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Dec. S.-Ac-cording
to advices from Alaska the Cana
dian government still retains a faint hope
that Skagway 13 a city of Canada and that
some Canadian authorities insist that in
the Canadian customs f,orm Skagway shall
not appear as Skagway, Alaska, but as
plain Skagway, with the word Alaska
omitted, by which action Americans in
terpret to mean that Canada does not pro
pose to recognize American ownership of
that place.
Another move is on foot in Alaska to se
cure a regular territorial form of govern
ment, including a delegate to Congress.
During the present session of the United
States Court at Juneau a proposition is to
b made to the Alaskan Bar Association to
take in hand the matter of calling a terri

The Pnn-Aniprlcnn Conference.
MEXICO CITY. Dec. 3. A great deal de

American conference. If the discussion
should become acrimonious, it is by no
means unlikely that the very existence of
the congress would be Imperiled. Mr.
Baez. of Paraguay, and Mr. Bermejo. of
Argentina, will speak again on the incident
of Monday's session arising out of Mr.
Baez's speech on arbitration. If their re
marks do not call forth a reply from the
Chileans the session will pass smoothly
and regular business be resumed, but if
anything happens to embitter the discus
sion the session will likely be more stormy
than that of last Monday.

TARIFF BILL DEBATE
COOT VON roSADOWSKY-WRHXCIl
SPEAKS I If THE REICHSTAG.
He Say It Is Impossible to Maintain a
i
Free Trade Rasls In Midst of
Protectionist Countries.
COUNT VON BUELOW AEOUSED
HE TELLS LEFTISTS GERMANY WILL
PERMIT NO DICTATION.
Intends to Carry Ont Vier Policy Re
Kardless of Other Nations Many
Idle Worktngmen.
BERLIN, Dec. 3. On the resumption of
the tariff debate in the Reichstag to-day-Count
Von Posadowsky-Wehner, secretary
of the interior, spoke in favor of the bill.
The Leftists frequently Interrupted, tak
ing strong exceptions to his remarks, while
the Rightists responded with cheers. The
secretary contended that Germany was
largely dependent on her export trade,
which must therefore be protected. The
United States had introduced protective
rates, not only against Germany, but
against the whole world, In the interests
of American finance and American Indus
try. It was Impossible to maintain a free
trade oasis in the midst of protectionist
countries, and unfortunately Germany
could not follow the advice that she should
take the lead in lowering duties, as she
had already had such a disagreeable ex
perience with sugar bounties.
In regard to the suggestion that the gov
ernment introduce a radical free-trade
measure, the secretary said it would entail
enormous taxation. The new; tariff was
necessary to build up agriculture, in which
Germany was vitally interested. He
doubted if Germany was able to produce
sufficient grain for her own consumption,
but the authorities wished In any case to
keep out all grain which was not needed.
Germany could supply the domestic de
mands for meat, but it was not true that
the cattle disease laws had been enforced
in order to raise the price. The German
land owners were not like the wealthy
English land owners, they could not stand
a decline In agriculture and the abolition
of the corn laws. Since the conclusion of
the commercial treaties other states had
repeatedly raised their duties. Germany
had a similar right, and the man who
did not look upon the matter from this
point of view lacked sense and national
pride.
The Imperial chancellor. Count Von Rue
low, replying to the criticisms of the Left
ists, said he wished that there should be
no mistake regarding the government's at
titude towards the commercial treaties.
They considered the renewal of the treaties
of long duration to be most desirable, but
Germany purposed arranging them on a
basis satisfactory to herself. The Interests
of other nations would be met in a spirit of
reciprocity and fair dealing, but Germany
was in a position to give effect to her
wishes with the same emphasis as other
countries. She need show no more diffi
dence than they. As for the utterances
of the foreign press the government would
not be driven a hair's breadth from the
path marked out, nor suffer dictation con
cerning Germany's rights and Interests.
Many Unemployed.
BERLIN, Dec. 3. Official investigations,
made by the Municipal Council, as to the
number of unemployed in the various in
dustries of Germany, reveal a rather worse
condition of affairs than had already been
intimated by the German press. These in
vestigations have resulted in showing that
only 20,6" men are employed in the metal
trades to-day, as against 73,100 employed in
these same trades in the month of Octo
ber, 1!0. The working hours have been
reduced in half of the factories. The un
employed in the larger towns amount to
from 7 to 10 per cent, of their populations,
and the aggregate of unemployed in Ger
many reaches 500,000 men, or 4 per cent, of
the total number of artisans in the country.
The Arbiter Markt, which publishes the
foregoing report of the municipal council,
sajs, commenting thereon, that one-twentieth
of the whole number of laborers in
the empire are forced to remain idle, but
optimistically remarks: "Although this
number is terribly large, the unemployed
can be taken care of until prosperity re
turns." Dl'LGARIA IMPUDENT.
Declines AH Responsibility for Miss
Stone's Abdnctlon.
NEW YORK, Dec. 3. The Bulgarian gov
ernment's reply to United States Diplo
matic Agent Dickinson's note has just been
made public by the Austro-Hungarlan for
eign ministry at Vienna, say3 the Vienna
correspondent of the World. It was writ
ten by Mr. Daneff, Bulgaria's minister of
foreign affairs, and concludes with the fol
lowing words:
"I am surprised that you have come to
the conclusion that the United States will
hold Bulgaria responsible for Miss Stone's
death. I must regard it as certain that the
using of violence by the brigands can only
be attributable to your protracted nego
tiations. It was for you to carry the ne
gotiations to a successful end. The Bul
garian government declines all responsi
bility." In Vienna this answer Is considered most
impudent, and the hope Is expressed that
the United States will hold Bulgaria re
sponsible for Miss Stone's safety.
Castellnne's Case In Conrt Again.
PARIS, Dec. 3. The financial affairs of
Count Bonl De Castellane again came be
fore a French tribunal to-day, when the
Court of Appeals began the hearing of the
count'3 appeal against a Judgment obtained
in the Tribunal of Commerce in favor of
Banker Davillier. The judgment In ques
tion ordered Count De Castellane to pay
bills amounting to 2.G00.P"O francs drawn
by the court in favor of Charles Wertheim
er, the Iondon bric-a-brac dealer, and
which were held by M. Davillier. Counsel
for Count De Castellane claimed that M.
Davillier had no direct interest in the bills,
but was acting for Charles Wertheimer!
and that this Invalidated the previous Judg
ment. The court adjourned without ren
dering a decision.

DUEL WITH HIGHWAYMAN
QUEEIl STORY TOLD BY A CHICAGO
PROFESSOR OF OSTEOPATHY.
Attempt to Rob a Man Who Adver
tised for 40O Cadavers and Who
Carried $9,000 in Ills Wallet.
CHICAGO, Dec. 3. A lone highwayman
and Dr. L. C. II. E. Zelgler, professor of
osteopathy, with offices in McVIckers The
ater building, fought a pistol duel on the
prairies west of Garfield Park for the pos
session of $3,000. One bullet flattened Itself
against the doctor's w.atch, just over his
heart, and a second passed through his
silk hat and tore its way through the nine
$1.000 bills that were hidden there in an en
velope. The doctor believes one of his bul
lets struck his assailant in the hand, and
the police are searching for a wounded
bandit.
Some weeks ago Professor Zelgler adver
tised for 400 cadavers, to be used for pur
poses of demonstration at the schools of
osteopathy in Illinois and other States. He
announced in his published request for
bodies that he was willing to spend $21,0u0
for the number of cadavers he required,
and the police believe it was the publica
tion of these figures that led up to last
night's assault. The police also believe
the hold-up to have been the outcome of
a conspiracy, one of the phases of which
was a confidence game, whereby Zelgler
was entrapped into carrying $3,000 in cash
on his person.

Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
SOUTH BEND. Ind., Dec. 3. The last will
and testament of the Hon. Clement Stude
baker was filed with the county clerk and
admitted to probate to-day. The will was
made on May 19 last. The wording of the
will and the unknown value of thousands
of acres of farming and marsh land In

estimate the value of the estate, but it is
safe to say that Mr. Studebaker was worth
several million dollars.
In his will Mr. Studebaker did not make
any bequests to charity. The will, however,
states that Mr. Studebaker did all through
his life make such gifts to charitable, re
ligious and philanthropic purposes as he
felt were due from one in his financial cir
cumstances, and that ho had full confidence
his wife and children would make further
gifts from time to time. Mr. Studebaker
divided his 6.000 shares of stock in the
Studebaker Manufacturing Company equal
ly among his three children Col. George
M. Studebaker, Clement Studebaker, jr.,
and Mrs. Charles Arthur Carlisle. Each
of the children also is given .3J in cash.
To each of his grandchildren is bequeathed
J1Q.QÜ0 to be paid when they severally reach
the age of twenty-five years. All the rest
and residue of Mr. Studebaker's estate,
both real and personal, is bequeathed to his
Tldcw, Ann M.. Studebaker. and his chil
dren. George M. Studebaker, Ann Stude
baker Carlisle and Clement Studebaker. Jr.,
to be held In trust by trustees. Mrs. Stude

along the river front, where the coalmen
tie up their boats and barges and handle
