ing greater and greater forces to
bear upon the Italian lineuntil
' the effect is now regarded by the
. military experts' as the greatest
Germany has made in all the war,
thfc battle for the possession of
the Asiago plateau has settled
down into a' mutual butchery un
paralleled in history. ,
rusiro-jerman envisions are
being thrown 'agains the Italian
lines in wave after wave, under a
terrific barrage, while the Ital
ians, reinforced by British and
French corps, are fighting dog
gedly, pouringvtons of machine
guri .and . rifle bullets into the
masses of gray coats, . mowing
down line after line, only to have
fresh forces thrown into the fight
' ing front. iv ': '-,
TERRIBLE CARNAGE V
' i, Thousands . are . dying hourly,
the carnage on both sides being
described even in the official bul
letins' from Cadorua's headquar-
; The military interest of the
world has now cehtered in this
ghastly, purging Climax of the
. war being battled out for posses
sion of the gateway to' Northern
Italy. The Asiago plateau,
through a deep valley of which
runs the Brehta River, emptying
into the lagoon of Venice, lies al
most in the center of the Italian
line of defense, half way between
the Adriatic and the Swiss bor
der. On .this plateau were linked
the Italianf orces operating
against Trent and those operat
ing with Triesteas their objec
tive, and against it has been
concentrated the main Teuton
army, reinforced, by divisions
from the army recently menacing
Venice and that'.' concentrated
early in the Austro-German of
fensive to strike south from
Trent.
LIVES DISREGARDED
The hammering of the Ger
mans regardless of cost in lives
has gained them some ground,
but nowhere in comparison to the
terrific losses they have sustain
ed. It is admitted that the Ital
ians, in- falling back from their
advanced positions, have lost in
the neighborhood of sixteen thou
sand prisoners, but they have lost
few guns and. have , partially
evened the score of prisoners by
capturing isolated groups of Ger
mans and Austrian, following
the repulses of the main attacks.
The German effort is to force
the passage of the Brcnta Valley
and open the way to the Italian
plains. The Italian object is to
hold the passes and make the
German drive so costly that it
cannot be persisted in. Neither
side has as yet indicated the least
intention of wavering and there
1 practically no cessation in the
slaughter. '
OTHER SECTORS QUIET
There has been little fighting
in any other theater of the war.
At Cambrai there has been wit
nessed practically an ending of
the battle which Crown Prince
Rupprecht had forced in an effort
to shake the hold General Byng
had secured on' this important

VIRTUALLY EXEMPTED
WASHINGTON, Docember 9 (As
sociatcd 1'rcss) Students who are tak
ing engineering courses in recognized
schools and colleges will be grouted
virtual exemption from conscription
aud draft, it was determined jresterJa.v
at a conference between, Secretary of
War Baker and Provost Marsha) Crow
der. Ruch virtual exemptions will be
granted only under certain conditions,
however.
Both Secretary Baker and Provost
Marshal C'rowder have hold consulta
tions with representatives of the lead
ing engineering societies of the country.-
The view point now taken is that
such students will later be important
military assets and of far more value
to the country than if tukcu before they
have completed their courses of study.
They are to be greatly preferred iu
the new classification iu order that they
may complete their studies and will be
urged to prepare themselves for a later
duty.
sector. It is thought that the
quieting down on this front is
only preparatory to the launch
ing of another great attack by the
Germans, who must either regain
the ground wrested from them or
have their own line broken by the
next British offensive. The de
velopments of the next few days
at Cambrai are certain to have an
important bearing upon the whole
winter campaign in France and
Belgium. " ,
Along the French front there
