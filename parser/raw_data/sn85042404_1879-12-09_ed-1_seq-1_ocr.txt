HE WASTED SOKE MONEY.
A Tramp Enters Learned Bro's.
Hardware Store and Demands
Money.
About half past seven last Friday
evening a tramp entered Learned Bros,
hardware store, in this city, and demand­
ed of Manager Barbour, who was alone in
the store at that time, a sufficient amount
of money to carry him to. Minneapolis.
Mr. B. politely informed Mr. Tramp that
lie had no money to give him to which
the ruffian replied that he knew better,
and that he [Barbour] was a liar. Mr. B.
being a man of no small amount of pluck,
as well as a man of considerable muscular
talent proceeded to give the would be
robber a good "bouncing" which he did
in good style. After Mr. B. had succeeded
in getting the intruder out of doors, he
(the tramp) run around to the back end of
the store where he was discovered in the
act* of forcing an entrance. Mr. B.
then informed him that he would shoot
him dead on the spot if he did net get.
It is needless to add that he got.

VOL. 2. JAMESTOWN, STUTSMAN COUNTY, D. T, DECEMBER 9 1879. NO 20
THE HPEXCEK WAVE,
It is apparent that the Spencer "gang'
does not admire the President's message,
which by the way is not surprising, since
it contains a greater amount of common
sense than the majority of his illustrious
followers are capable of digesting. A
leading editorial in the Fargo Daily
Argus, of the 4th inst., headed "The
Annual Message." is a fair sample of the
stock of brains, Spencer has employed to
prepare the way for his coming. We
would take occasion to say if Spencer ever
expects to gain any prominence in Dakota
politics, the best move he can make is to
put split sticks on the tails of his present
hirelings and secure anew and more in­
telligent set of monkeys to crank his
organs.
The Argus is a good newspaper, but it
had better wait until it is old enough to
run alone before it commences to buck
against the Union.
WOULD IT NOT BE A GOOD
SCHEMEV
The chances for fire increases in every
town, city or village, just in proportion to
the increase of its population. The
greater number of buildings we have
around us the greater are our chances for
a disastrous burn out. And in view of the
fact that Jamestown is rapidly increasing
both in population and buildings would
it not be wise on the part of our citizens
to take measure to protect themselves
against fire. Perhaps it would be a good
scheme to extend underground pipes from
some point in the center of the city to the
river from which source an abundance of
water could be forced, by means of a
wind mill, or small engine, to a large cis­
tern from which snyill pipes might be
extended to smaller tanks in the vicinity
of buildings where fire would be the most
likely to originate. Some such an
arrangement could be effected without
great expense and would prove to be a
great benefit to the city. It would be
almost self supporting from the fact that
the most of our citizens would have their
stores and dwelling house supplied with
water which could be done at a very
reasonable price and at the same time pay
a very liberal presentage on the original
investment.
Our columns are open for the discussion
of this sehemeand trust that our citizens
will not be backward in expressing their
views on the subject as it cannot fail to
be of interest to every individual owing
property within the city limits.
N. P. '1 lines.
Is It Another Railroad
The land party with Manager H. A.
Sargent and C. F. Kindred, of the Brain
erd N. P. office, who went north last week,
camping out five days and nights, returned
last Monday. We saw an immense pair of
antlers from an elk hanging out of the
ambulance wagon, and conjecture that elk
steak and venison will drop in the market.
The Argus says that the trip means a
railroad from Valley City north to Totten.
The Argus is no doubt honest in its
opinions regarding the route of this
imaginary road. But it will get its eyes
open about the same moment the Times
man gets through laughing up its sleeves
over the prospect of Valley City's becom­
ing a railroad center. Whenever the N.
P. build a road to Fort Totten it will be
built via Jamestown, and don't you
forget it.
HE TOOK ONE DEUItEE.
A prominent traveling man from St.
Paul, who, by the way, is endowed with
'.inordinary amount of musical ability,spent
the Sabbath in our city. He spent the
afternoon in displaying his musical accom­
plishments and the evening in pursuit of
"wisdom" which we do not hesitate to say
he obtained. As it happened, the L. A.
U.'s meet on Sabbath evening, and the
worthy chaDlaiu, of the order, being an
intimate acquaintance of our musical
friend, cordially invited him to become a
member of the lodge. He consented with
an air of supreme politeness, and as the
hour came for the lodge to convene the
would be member accompanied by the
worthy chaplain fetched up at the door of
the lodge room, and after going through
with the usual ceremony the outside sen
tinel permitted him to enter. What took
place within the sacred walls of the lodge
room, we cannot reveal, but judging from
the appearance of the candidate after he
came out, we presume he wished he h»d
remained at home with his wife
and babies.
—Josh Billings says that the hardest
thing for a man to do is to spark 2 "gals"
at the same time, and preserve an average.
Don't know anything about the average,
but think we could spark four or five these
chilly nights, and not lose our equilibrium
either.
ADDITIONAL LOCAL*.
—Learned Bro's have just opened one
of the finest hardware stDres west of Min­
neapolis, in this city. Both the stock and
store area credit to Jamestown.
—The Jamestown Amateur dramatic
club will play the interesting farce, "We
are all Teetotalers," next Tuesday evening
at the Academy of Music. The best
dramatic talent our city affords will ap­
pear behind the foot lights and we bespeak
for them a crowded bouse.
—Fargo has about 3000 inhabitants. It
supports three large newspapers,twojweek
lies and one daily. We know of cities
the east of 5000 inhabitants, in which one
weekly paper would starve to death.
These western towns beat the world for
enterprise.
—In No. 22, present volume, we propose
to commence the publication of a histori­
cal sketch of Jamestown. commencing at
the earliest period of its existence and
closing at the very latest, together with
a prospectus of its future. In order to
make it interesting and reliable we would
be pleased to receive communications and
notes pertaining to its early history, fiom
those who may be acquainted with it.
—E. P. Wells and wife, of this city,
left tor the east last Tuesday morning.
We understand that they have been visit­
ing in Fargo and Braineri during the
past few flays,but are now in Minneapolis
where Mrs. Wells will spend a few waeks
visitiug her parents and friends. Mr. W
is expected home to day.
—Sundry improvements have been
made at the Dakota House wh ch aie veiy
noticeable. A new calendar clock and
one of Halls' fire-proof safes have been
added to the furniture of the office. The
office counter has also been painted by S.
L. Knapp, of Minneapolis, who is
engaged in painting the residence of E.
P. Wells. All who have noticed Mr. K.'s
work bear notice that he is a skilled
workman.
Bismarck Tribune.
Marshall McClure, wlio has gained so
much reputation of late, both at home and
abroad, because of bis being the proprietor
of the Jamestown ALERT, was in the city
last night. Marsh, is getting up a good
paper,which is recognized and appreciated
by bath the press of this country anl
Europe.
Just so, Jewell but you will remember
that you became a little notorious once
yourself. Let see, we believe you
undertook to inflict upon the Chicago
Tribune, some live years ago, a life-sketch
of all the gray headed men of that city.
You remember, of course, how the little
scheme terminated.
If the recent trip of the righteous editor
of the Jamestown ALEUT to this city had
the same effect on him that it did on the
patent insides of his paper, his stomach
must have been in a terrible unsettled
condition.
We guess that our stomach was in as
good a shape as Bro. Jewell's was after
the recent fire, in that city, if late reports
are true.
Larry Moore was shot in the shoulder
Sunday, at Point Pleasant, by his loving
wife. Not dangerous. 'f^ey were on a
little spree.
Stanley Huntley, who made it so warm
for Dakota journalists, and demoralized
them to that extent that they still see
ghosts of his pen in the columus ol' the
Tribune, is now on the editorial staff of
the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, the largest and
best evening paper in the country.
If Stanley Huntley had a^ more dt
•moralizing tendency, than his unholy
partner, Jewell, who he left behind, may
God help him. Takeaway the ghost aud
give us Stanley.
—Some of our slop bucket exchanges
sneer at the idea of making the James
river n.iviga table aud regard the effort as
being a prodigious undertaking. We
console ourselves, however, with the
knowledge that not one out of ten of the
erresponsible scribes have ever seen the
James river and that their opinions are
wholly based on tlu opinion givm by
those who areas ignorant as themselves.

LITERARY.
The Academy of Music still continues
to be the center of attractions. Nearly
every evening in the week it is occupied
by soaie kind of entertainment. Last
Friday evening the Literary Society
convened, and as usuai every available seat
in the ball was occupied-
Miss Lizzie Wells an& Prof Kindig
opened the exercises of the evening by
fuvorrsg the society and those present
with & fine piece of instrumental music
which was loudly applauded.
The reading by Mr. H. T. Elliott, [sub­
ject, "Love,"l was abely rendered, and
generally appreciated.
Prof. John Kindig favored the society
with a very interesting declamation in
German, wkicli it is said, by those who
could understand it, was one of the
most intelligent features of the program.
The reading by Miss Maggie Elliott
was good, and gave evidenee of superior
dramatic talent.

The representative various churches,
during the past year, have been maintain­
ing union religious services on Sundays.
Measures are being taken to continue'
this union movement through the coming
year. The movement looks towards the
erection and fitting up of an edifice for
public worship, at as early a day
practicenble, for the accommodation of all
^people, of whatever name or denomination
who shall contribute to the expense of
building and furnishing such a structuic.
Such a movement would seem to he in
harmony with go id order, and a proper
observance of one day in seven devoteu to
rest and worship.
The Next New State.
The clear headed quill driver of the Man
n[Mich.]Tribune hashes up the following
concerning Dakota and the James rives
country, in which there is much truth:
The next new state will probably bo
Dakota. Its present territorial boundaries
includes a area as large, nearly, as that of
Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, and more than
twice us great as that of Minnesota. That
portion ot the territory west of the
Missouri river, is rapidly filling up A\ith
agricultural settlers, pouring in daily from
all points of the ccmpas. The laud itsel
is extremely fertile, and the eastern halt'
is capable of producing more breadstuff
and other articles of food, and of m-i
chandise, than any other »f the existing
states, not excepting Minnesota. Another
advantage is that the settlers takes his
land unincumbered by any mort^a^o or
heavy taxations resulting from "cmintv
debts contracted in aid of railroads —a
burden which, unfortunately, we trh.s
heavily upon other western states. Tim

Rev. W. P. Huntington favored our
citizens with two interesting discourses
last Sunday. We understand that our
people have pledged a certain amount, to
aid in the support of Mr. H. during his
visits to our village, which is nothing
more than they should do under the
circumstances. If they encourage Mr.
Huntington's visits they should pay him
