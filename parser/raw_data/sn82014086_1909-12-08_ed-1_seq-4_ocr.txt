THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To those who enjoyed the thrill of
a KoosevelUaa message the message of
President TaXt la a disappointment
It does not ring laud, but it does
ring true. It Is in keeping with his
quiet and persistent manner; and it
' leaves no doubt as to what he stands
for, tout carries full assuranca of his
resolute purpose.
The most Important Issue, tie says,
Is a more economical administration
of the government, and he calls at
tention to tha fact that the adoption
ot new methods will make a saving
wf ver fifty millions, and that a sur
pkia is assnred for the . fiscal yea
ending In June, 1511.
He shows that the postofllce depart
ment's embarrassment Is caused by
the carrying of second class mall mat
ter at a loss of eight cents a pound,
which annually totals a loss of 163,
000,00s; aa he very properly advo
cates an increase of rates there.
He also calls upon congress to hon
or the platform promise of the re
publican party by enacting a law to
prevent the issuance of injunctions
wfthout notice unless it must be done
te prevent immediate and irreparable
injury, and that such injunctions shall
net remain in force more than a week,
unlees an order for extension has been
obtained faom the court
In feehaK of the public he also asks
for reform tn court methods to pre
vent the delays and heavy coBts upon
litigants and to remove what he re
gards as a primary cause for lynch
ings and soob violence' In different
parts of tbe country! and he favors
postal savings banks with a rate of in
terest so loir that they will not at
tract deposits from other banks, de
moralizing conservative banking and
producing financial disaster.
The message is short, and worthy
the attention of every intelligent read
er. The Bulletin prints it in full; and
It la so divided and attractively head
ed up that it may be read In sections
at one's leisure.
THE MACADAM ROAD.
The roads which first bore the name
f Macadam were simply built so deep
with heavy and light stone, and ao sol
idly that they would stand the wear
and tear of travel fer a century no
heavy trucking or automobile speed
ing could knock them out -
The macadam of today is a goat of
another color. It is just as near like
the original macadam as the artificial
alligator skin boots and valises, eta,
are like the real thing. The alliga
tor would not be able to recognize
them as the hides of his departed tri
bal comrades. And these near not
very near macadam roads are not
heavy enough for 1909 tourtag cars,
which are simply heavy road locomo
tives built to beat the cars, and the
road commissioners of the states at
tha front In good road building are
now looking for new road binders
for metal which with a light founda
tion and good drainage will meet the
requirements of this high speeding,
something no roads were ever subject
ed to until this age; and the New
ark News says that "Commissioner
Gttkyson of New Jersey believes he
has found a new road surface which
is destined to completely supplant
eruehed stone. He has been experi
menting ever since he has fceen in of
floe, and he now has eighty-five miles
of road built of the new material, with
pacifications drawn for thirteen more.
Some of these roads have been down
for than a year; have been subjected
t summer's heat, to winter's cold and
t all kinds of heavy carting, light
riding and automobile speeding. They
hare stood all these tests well and are
nat likely to need repairs for several
roars to come.
"Tha new material is crushed stone,
jth an asphalt binder, the best pro
portion of asphalt being the subject of
many experiments and tests of en
durance. The state road law . was
changed last winter to allow counties
to build roads of the new combination
with state aid. The cost of such
roads Is from $1.15 to $1.50 a square
yard, as against $1.90 to $2.50 for tha
best macadam, and it is not only dust
less, but durable."
. Commissioner MacDonald of this
state says:
t'The large Increase In automobile
traffic which Is so trying on the roads
has compelled the adoption of more
solid roadways, that is. the foundation
must be deeper and the surface laid
with better material and so construct
ed as to stand the traffic of this
new element, the automobile. But as
a general principle, I have adhered to
the macadam system, which, when
properly constructed, is, in my opin
ion, the best yet devised for rural
highways. The civilized world has
come to recognize this fact. As to
the possibility of changing this meth
od, I have been thinking that it might
be beneficial, and on this point I am
not quite convinced, to drees the
whole material going into a new road,
from the bottom up, with tar. It
might have the tffect of a better knit
ting together of tha stone and top
dressing. But the Idea that oiling
the surface would improve the situa
tion is illusory. I tried oil on roads
in ihia state before Its present advo
cates knew anything about it, and I
found it a poor palliative, with no
permanent worth. I tried it on the
Wallingford road, for Instance, and
my experience there and in other sec
tions Of the state did not justify me in
spending more of the state's money-ln
the experiment."
The press is not Inclined to hound
the commissioner for the ruin wrought
by automofcllists. The Bridgeport
Standard, commenting upon Mr. Mac
DonaJtTs recent replica to his ques
tioners, says:
"Commisslaner MacDonald meets
all tbe Issues squarely and dodges
none. While there may he aa honest
difference of opmien as to the facts
stated, particularly those with refer
ence to the comparative value of Con
nection state roads and those of other
states, certainly . the commissioner
shoal be in position to knew best
what is right and his categorical an
swers are before the citizens of the
state for examination, further criti
cism er refutation If any critic feels
Inclined and able te continue the dis
cueslen. Tbe commissioner makes a
good ataAssaaal -has decided conylo 1
tlons and the courage of them, and
may well call for proof when derelic
tion of duty Is laid at his door."
This is a fair way of looking at the
matter, and it will impress the people
as. being as just as it is deserved on
the part of the commissioner.
NO LOAFING ON THE JOB.
Those who are crying loudest about
the inefficiency of the state highway
commissioner are the expectants who
were anticipating Immediate appoint
ment as assistants under him because
the legislature empowered him to In
crease his force of assistants and en
gineers. The legislature adjourned
months ago arid they have not yet
connected with the state treasury; and
he does not mean that they shall con
nect until such time as their services
will be equal to the amount of money
they draw from the state. Mr. Mac
Donald explains this most satisfactor
ily for the taxpayers, if it Is not con
sidered satisfactory by those in inter
est' He says, with reference to these
authorised and legalized appoint
ments: - "I have not made those appoint
ments, simply because my first con
cern is the interest and duty . I owe
the state. Like the repairs feature,
the money for the payment of those
men did not come to me until Octo
ber, and they would be of no use to
the state until spring orjwns. All they
would have to do during the winter
months is to draw their salaries. Oh,
I realize that I require help as well
as my critics do, but I contend that no
dishonesty, no inefficiency, even, and,
this I say with due modesty, no neg
lect of duty, no loafing on the job
can he laid at my door and sustained
by proof."
The commissioner realizes his own
responsibility and as tha master of the
situation he regards tbe interests' of
the state and his own standing of
more importance to him than the de
sires or demands of persons whose
self-interest is often their only rec
ommendation. HOW IT AFFECTS THE MESSAGE
President Taft's message has been
In the newspaper offices and the
hands of correspondents two or three
days. This forehandedness enables
newspapers to put the message in
type comfortably and gives the edi
tors opportunity to read it carefully
and prepare intelligent summary and
comment. We think we notice a dis
position here and there to betray the
confidence. No one tells right out
what the president Is going to say, or
reveals the recommendations he is go
ing to make. But there is a good deal
of indirect discussion ot the matters
Involved, so that when the message
appears some of the points will have
been threshed out in advance, and the
president will seem to be dealing in
second-hand goodB. The information
can be found elsewhere, as in some of
the department reports, so that it can
not certainly be charged that actual
violation of the president's confidence
has taken place. But the suggestion
of special interest in the subjects dis
cussed probably comes from a read
ing of the message, which contains
several matters of great interest
Waterbury American.
It is surprising how close some
newspapermen can come to violating
the confidence reposed in them and
still stand technically free of the
charge. It is afcln to genius for a
man to truthfully foreshadow the con
tents of a presidential message with
out quoting it or making use of lan
guage which may be traced directly to
its pages. It has been noticeable that
the discussion of the leading ques
tions for several days past must have
given he readers of some papers the
impression that "great minds run in
the same channel."

The only way to properly hunt deer

In a Wisconsin town buttermilk was

There is little danger of a war be

make a respectable target.
The conclusion has been reached
that the patience of this country with
tho muss-making Latin republics has
been worn about threadbare.
President Taft admits that he can
not do it all in one message, and that
special messages will be convenient
in the future as in the past.
New Jersey has decided that it will
build no more macadam or telford

HER REASONS
"What's the dope you got there?"
queried Miss Maloney, peering into her
companion's plate
Miss Melbourne smacked her Hps
daintily. "Turkey hash," she replied.
"It's great, believe me."
Miss Maloney leaned back In her
chair with an ah- of mingled annoy
ance and resignation. "I might have
known it," she said. "I've Just about
made up my mind that they ain't ev
er goln' to be anything but turkey
in one shape or another for me in
this world."
"What alls you?" asked Miss Mel
bourne, in considerable surprise.
"Well," said Miss Maloney, "I was
out in the country over Thanksglvin'.
One of ma's cousins asked me to come
out and eat dinner With her. She
said in the afternoon we'd ride around
and visit with the other relatives that
live in the neighborhood and then 1
could come hack and sleep at her
house.
"When I told Ma Jones, the lady
that keeps the boardin' ..house, that I
wasn't goln to be there Thanksgivin
day she was awful kind of provoked.
She said she'd been countin' on me
to keep things goln' at her table on
Thanksgivin' day. There's an awful
Jolly crowd at the boardin' hous?,
and Ma Jones Just loves to see th-j
boarders have a good time. She says
to me. 'Now, Miss Maloney, you bein'
the cut-up of the house and all, It's
goln' to queer the whole thing if you
go and ditch us.'
"Well, I was real sorry, so I says,
'Why can't you have your Thanksgiv
in' day dinner the night before? I
ain't goln' till Thanksglvin' day morti
in and we could have our turkey din
ner here the night before and dance
in the parlor and have a pile of fun.'
"Ma Jones was game. She put it up
to the other boarders and they was all
tickled to death. So that was the way
she fixed it for us.
"Well, the noon before Thanksgivin'
I went over to the club to lunch and
they was havln the dandiest bunch of
eats you ever saw turkey and cram
b'ries and everything so I took a big
plateful and ate so much I went to
sleep three times in the afternoon, but
by night I was all ready for another
feed.
"Sure enough. Ma Jones had a swell
dinner and we all et plenty, but she
wound up with some good strong cof
fee, so by mldntgnt we was au wiae
awake and havin' the time of our lives.

and pour a pitcher of ice water on
me before I could remember who I
was even. I didn't have time to eat
any of Ma Jones' breakfast but Just
rushed for the train as hard as I
could. r
"One of the lads met me at the train
and when we got to-my cousin's house
they was Just puttin' dinner on the
table. Well, say, I bet the turkey
weighed twenty-five pounds. Honest
it took up half the table, and all the
rest of the space was filled with veg
etables and bread and biscuits and
Jell and pickles and one thing and an
other, and there was enough for a
whole army.
"I had a funny feelln' when I looked
at that turkey kind of lonesome and
disappointed and like him and me had
met somewhere before, but anyway 1
pitched in and done fairly well con
siderin' the way I'd1 stuffed the day
before. Cousin Julia was worried
about my appetite, though, and kep'
urgin' me to eat, more. I was afraid
of hurtin' her feelin's, so I et till I
began to feel as if I'd swallowd a
cannonball by mistake.
"After dinner we washed , up the
dishes and then Cousin Julia said, "Pa's
got the team hitched up, so ws better
be startin' for Uncle Jake's.'
"When we got to Uncle Jake's the
first thing we heard was one of the
kids hollerin': 'We ben waitin' for you
folks to come and eat Thanksgiving
dinner with us. We're goin' to have
Thanksgivin' dinner for supper here.
Gee, but we're a hungry bunch!'
"Well. I'm livln' to tell about it and
that's about all I can say. After din
ner they took us out to see the tur
keys that hadn't been killed, and, hon
est to goodness, I felt like a canni
ball." Miss Maloney sighed deeply. "I bet
you won't believe me," she said, after
a moment, "but Ma Jones had saved
me the turkey that we left the night
before Thanksgivin', and I had to sit
right down and eat that when I got
home the next night"
Miss Melbourne took the last bite of
her hash and then breathed a sigh of
content "It was a pity you couldn't
have spread them dinners out a little,"
she said.
Miss Maloney laid her hand convuls
ively on her friend's arm. "Say, come
out of this," she hissed. "There's a
feller comin that's got two helpin's
of turkey hash on his plate. He's
aimin' for this table nd I'll die If I
have to sit here and watch, him eat
it" Chicago News.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR,
-- J Ideas.
Mr. Editor: Ideas, like driftwood, al
ways come floating in after a storm.
As you walk along the shore of the
"great pond," it is both interesting
and instructive to view and study, the
strewn wreckage. So it is with ideas;
they also are interesting and instruc
tive. It Is grand thing to have an
idea. A person having several of them
is not very dangerous; that is, provid
ed they are of the right kind.
Since Senator Aldrlch started the
storm on the financal question ideas
appear to have sprung up like mush
rooms in the night Not many days
since I received a letter from a gentle
man,' and he is not a "hayseed," what
ever he may have been In his younger
days, "while sowing his "wild oats."
This gentleman, it appears, has caught
an "idea;" he has one, anyway, how
ever he came In possession of it. And,
would you believe it, this Idea is in
relation to the "money question." He
seems to have gotten into "the right
church," but "the wrong pew." But
let that pass, as long as he is in the
church, he will be under cover. No
doubt but he will find the right pew,
only give him time. He Appears to
have heard of an "elastic currency,"
which he enthusiastically believes in,
or thinks he dVes.'And of what ma
terial do you think he proposes to
make . this "elastic currency?" Why,
"rubber," of course. He calls this- a
"new variety."
He doesn't even insinuate which Is
"new," the "elasticity" or the material.
One thing about it is, it is young, for
he says it is now In an "embryonic"
state, and he fears it has enemies.
This gentleman seems to be ecstat
ically soaring up to dizzy heights over
his new discovery, but I pi'y the poor
fellow, for when the gas oozes out of
the "rubber" balloon, he may "light"
hard. I want to say kindly and sym
pathetically to the gentleman, that his
"confidence" was miscplaced. when he
asks me to "Join issues" with him.
His fatal mistake was in not asking
the Rhode Island senator, instead of
an old-time dealer In "charcoal," for
the senator is well versed in the "outs
and Ins" of an "elastic currency." hav
ing been in the "house of lords" Cor
perhaps more proper to say senate),
for 28 years. That is, he has been
there long enough to know most of
tha outs and ins. But I want to say
to this enthusiastic gentleman, that
I fear he is counting his chickens be
fore they are hatched. He should have
been cautioned to look before he leaps.
Someone of his friends should have
whispered in his ear that the Rubber
trust owns and controls all the rub
ber after it leaves the one-handed
rubber pickers down In the Congo
State, where King Leopold is monarch
of all he surveys.
But perhaps the gentleman does not
mean, literally, to have a "rubber cur
rency," in fact, but simply to use it
as a base, a security for note Issues,
owing to its great lntrlnsio value. No
one will dispute its value(?) or rather
its cost, that ever had occasion to pur
chase a pair of what is called rub
ber(?) boots, as I am Informed that a
pair of such boots contains only about
a teaspoonful of the Congo State fluid.
The remainder is composed of well,
say. shoddy. But then, one should not
complain, for when we part with one
of the five-dollar note Issues for a pair
of these boots, If we have enough
confidence aboard, we know we bave
our money's worth. Valuable goods
