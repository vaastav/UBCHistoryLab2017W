On cur first page, to-day. we copy that
portion of President Johuson's Message
' deroted to Reconstruction, and hope it
may be generally read.' It's " interest
..grows not out cf any originality', but
from its sameness to the tune he played
"around the circle." Tbe people's verdict
is ijnored, its lesson disregarded, and
My Policy" c til 1 claims to stand on its
own bottom." the "circle" of which the
President seems . to think marks the cr
cumferecce of tbe United States,
i Thij entire disregard of ihe expressed
will of Jhe people, ar.d stulborn assump
tion of "My Tolicy,-!! meeu with most
L;Iuvic2 cosaplKseuls from iclel organs
everywhere, but with loyal journals its;
..reiteration cf the condemned "policy"
'.arouses but coateopt for the demagogue
,ho, in his "circle" workr spoke of the
:tyraccy cf the masses" as more to be
. dreaded thaa,4My Policy."
' " Its ' effect ypen Congresi was the least
"Lof any document of the kind ever deliv.
"red, and his suggestions, if any could
; le found in the document,- fell without
weight "or Uror. As the President will
persist in forgetting the will of the loyal j
people, insomuch" is CongTess in duty
louud to ignore and check him;', as the
. : President shows a growing partiality fr
rebels, insomuch should Congress watch
" .Lira with suspicion and thwart' any evil
. ... i
he may attemrs Congress is true, tried
and more carneit ua ever,, as to the
thorough reconstruction of the rebellious
section, &bd will not brook dalliance on
the part or the President or rebels.
t The Prtsident, in the latter portion of
the message, adrises that a Territorial
form of government be established for
the District of Columbia and a Delegate
in Congress allowed it.
. Of loreign affairs the . message says :
"It is a subject of congratulation that no
foreign combinations against our peace
. and safety have'been formed, or attempt
ed. While sentiments of reconciliation,
loyalty and patriotism have increased at
home, a more just consideration of our
national' character and rights has been
manifested "by foreign nations." He
congratulates the country on the comple
tion of the Atlantic Telegraph ; and is
sanguine of tbe early completion of the
. Kamschatka and Russian Telegraph line.
Tiie protest cf Congress t gainst foreign
countries pardoning convicts upon their
removal to this country, he reports duly
forwarded and the practice stopped. The
President has protested against the pro
ject of 'Spanish American adventurers"
"to induce the emigration of freedmeu"

tinued friendship between the two Gov
ernments. On the Fenian raid the
President very naturally defends his ac
tion as made neceujirhy .the existing
neutrality laws, and says he .hit regard
ed "the expedition as not only i pcMllcat
in its nature, but also i a' agril measure j
foreign to the VVited iStates in its cause,'
character and objects." He says "such
representations have been made to the
-Rrit-QftTgmfflent, -in-behftlf--of-the :
convicted persons," was will, it is hoped,
induce-them in these cases to an exercise
of clemency and a.judicial amnesty .to Rll
who were engaged in the movement.'
Of the neutrality laws be says, fso long
as those laws remain upon our statute
JkliJJPHyj faithfully executed,"
and 'nFthey alone can apply, the remedy
is ' their modification : ur repeaL" " He
says on the right of expatriation," this
"Government has claimed for all persons
not connected or accused or suspected oi
crime, an absolute right of self-expatria-tion
and a choice of new national allegi
ance Most of the European States have
dissented from this principle, and have
claimed a right to hold such of their sub
jects as have immigr ated to and been
nationalized in the United States and
afterwards returned on transient, visits, to
their native countries, to the perform
ance of military service in like manner
as resident subjects " As this, question
has frequently caused difficulties between
this and foreigu countries and recently
duriDg the war be. ween Prussia, Austria
Italy and as there is now general peace,
the President urges Copgress to pass a
law plainly defininglhe position of . this
Government ia favor of the right of self
expatriatioo. . . ; L-. x i .. --!

Treasury, accompanying, the President's
Message, states that the public debt on

. The report ' of 'the Secretary cf War
is encoursffinsr in &bowiae tbe easy ' and
quiet translation of our gorernraent from
a war to a peace footing' r gradually and
en rely has the clang of arms ceased, and
this Department taktn again the even

report announces preparations complete
for the payment of -additional bounties,
authorised by the act of Congress passed
last July. "More than 6,000 soldiers

' The report of the Postmaster General
gives the receipts of that Department at
S14.3S6.3SG and the expenditures at
315,352,07, an excess of expenditures of
$765,093 ; this excess was partially sup
plied by an appropriation of 8700,000 bjtt
last Cocgreis,' leaving ' an actual deficit
of $265,093. ' On the 30th of June last

Land Entries
To Chas. G. Dorsey, Register of the
Land Office in this city, we are indebted
for the following statement of entries of
land' made in this, the Nemaha Land
District, during the month of November:
Homesteads,
Ag. Col. Scrip,
Land Warrants,
Cash,:V !.-
10,434 acres,
5.556
956 t

. Total.. 17,746 "
e also informs us that the number of
applications already on file during De
cember indicate that a good business will
be done this month, if the Receiver will
attend to his du'.y.
. Tre St. Joseph Herald, conservative,
highly commends the President's Mes
sage acd says : . .;
"From a perusal of his arguments no
man would gather that there had ever
been any excitement on the subject of
"My --Policy," or any fiercely contested
electibns in which ;ihe. question, of-the
restoration of Southern fctates formed
aa element,'
Thus is he complimented by the Cop
per-johnson press upon the worst feature
of his message the attempt to ignore
the expressed will of the people. This
policy, on the part of the President, be
comes still more contemptible vtiren we
remember with what apparanl candor he
su- ranted .My.jpolicy" to the people for
therr decision, .and the confidence and
even recklessness with which he scat-
tered amons them Constitutions and stars:
Congress has before it the decision clear-
iy ezpressea,. ana win carry it out ae
spite, the ignorance or clap-trap of the
President or his followers. Nothing less
than the Constitutional Amendment will
be accented, more will be bad if it i
rejected.
. From the Union Seniinal, published at
Hiawatha, Ks., just over the line, we
leara that two weeks since-"a desperate
fight. took place ia Nemaha county be
tween four horse thieves and the SherifTs
posse of men who were after them. Two
of the thieves, named Ben Strange and
Wm. Jackson, were arrested and lodged
in jail. Tbe other two. named Mel
LWn,and Sach. Moony, were pursued by
the citizens and overtaken, when they
.turned and fired upon the persons that
were pursuing them, killiog one man and
wounding anothor.' We have heard since,
that the whole neighborhood turned out
and succeeded .ia catching aai hanging
the thieves."-" ' ' ' '
This , is near home, and we hope is
suSciint to;cause bur ' farmers to be on
the alert. " ' ' 1 ' s : '
