Not " True to the South."
The Senior of the Sentinel having com -plained
that J. J. Guthrie, Jr., Esq., of the
Progress, Agent of the Associated Press, had
not sent to him a copy of the President's
Message as promptly as he expected it, Mr.
Guthrie, after explaining the matter satis
factorily, makes this " ten strike'" at the Se
nior aforesaid: -
" Since the Editor of the Sentinel is pleased
to couple the name of the Progress with that
of the Standard, I will remind him for his
sake and the information of the public, that
L, my brother and father, sacrificed ' good
prospects in Washington, to battle in the
cause of Southern" independence, and all
three of us were in the military service, when
he was engaged, during the existence of the
Confederacy, writing articles hostile to the
cause of the South, for the editorial columns
of the Raleigh Standard."
. Every word of the above Is true : Mr. Pell
was as tt hostile to the cause of the South"
as he could be, up to the fall of 1863. ' This
charge upon the Senior is, 'as he would say,
- especially damaging. The Senior does not
care how many fibs are told "upon him ; bat
the truth, as in this case, is more than he can
bear. r . ...
Mr. Pool was defeated, according to the
Sentinel, because he " embarrassed the Con
federacy" in 1864. Mr. Pell did the same
thing in 1863, and the Progress has charged
the fact upon him. Mr. Pell is not " true to
the South:" He is simply an impostor. He
ought not to enjoy any' favors at the hands
of this true blue Southern rights Legislature.
Let him act honestly in this business by re
signing his State Printership and retiring to
private life. It is clear that he obtained the
office by false pretences, as this Legislature
is too "true to the South" to have elected
any one knowingly, who was " hostile to the
cause of the South" during the rebellion.
There are no truer Unionists than those of
the South. We trust our Northern friends
and the Congress will bear this fact in mind.
It was an easy and a profitable thing to be a
Union man in the Northern States during
the rebellion ; but Southern Unionists had
to maintain their principles and they did
maintain them against the bayonet, the
dungeon, and oppressions and contumely of
all kinds. :. Traitors are. " demanding their
rights." . Loyal .men only ask for protection
and for permanentcTvil government on a loyal
basis. It can not be that a loyal and patri
otic Congress will disregard this request.
Moreover, the condition of the finances of
the country and the complication of our Eu
ropean difficulties, look to a probable conflict,
which may restrain the wrath of our ene
mies. Sentinel. :
The report presents a much more satisfac
tory condition of our finances than one year
ago the most sanguine could have anticipa
ted. President Jointoris late Message. -
It is a subject of congratulation that no
foreign combinations against our domestic
peace and safety, or our legitimate influence
among tlw nations, have been formed or at-temptedLrr-Prfisident

. ' !
Grates. A. writer in the Eastern part
ot this State to the Petersburg Express, says:
In Chowan county I met with Mr. Cherry
and Jos. Cannon, two of the largest growers
of grapes in this part of North Carolina. It
is said that Mr, Cannon was offered $12,000
for his grapes, the purchaser to gather them.
While Ido not credit the report, it b very
app (rent that the cultre of the grape is the
most lucrative business that our people can
, pursue.;, la the district of Columbia a piece
of land was pointed out to me that was then
set out in vines. It was very poor, situated
on the side of a hill, and yet the- purchaser
gave $1,000 per acre for it . The firet crop
of grapes showed the good sense and sound
judgment of the vintner, and proved remun
erative. Far better lands can be bought in
North Carolina for $5 an acre, and our soil is
the natural home of the grape. Amateurs
may be gratified to know that Mr. Cannon
; has a new variety f grape,' which he pro
nounces the best in the world.or at least the
best that he ha ever seen. ' It is called the
Mish grape. The demand for it is very great,
far exceeding the supply. . I think it is a na
tive seedling. -, . '. . ..
Mr. Crawford, of Rowan, very kindly pro
poses to "prepare a hell for W; W. Holden
and rhis' friends" ' There is no necessity
for preparing such a place for the Commoner
from Rowan., It is already prepared, and
will give him, in due time, a warm reception.
w
The Sentinel regrets that' action has been
so long deferred by ur Legislature on the
Howard amendment We concur with that
paper in this regret. There, was no good
reason why the Legislature should not. have
adopted it at once, unanimously. ;
The Sentinel adds, " We are ready to sur
render any personal or political feeling to
effect the great object of national tranquility
and Union." That is a very pretty expres
sion, but unfortunately the facts' do1 not sus-'
tain the Editors in making it , The Sentinel
also adds: -: , ' .
: rt But we never can vote for the enlarge
ment of the powers of the Federal Govern
ment or the Congress and Executive,, which
look to the destruction of the old government
as the Howard amendment proposes to do,
or the humiliation and degradation of our
own people. If they are to be disfranchised,
let others do it." ' .
To all which we have no particular objec
tion. It is very refreshing, however, to hear
the Sentinel and its friends praising " the old
government" Every one knows how they
love "the old government," and how they
hate the present one. They went out 'from
the old mansion five years ago, and labored
to the last moment to fire and destroy it
Since they left, many changes have occurred.
They will condescend to return to it, if the '
occupants will beg their 'pardon for having
left it and sought to . destroy it and if, in
addition, they will put every thing in the
mansion in the' same' condition it was
when they left , This is so kind and reason-,
able that any thing else would be "humili
ating and degrading;" and "true Confede
rates," who scorned to "cowardly abandon
the cause of the South,", will suffer any thing,
no matter how terrible or awful, before they
will obey any will but their own. Never
theless, they are as submissive as lambs, and
much more loyal than any other class in the
country. All other classes are common,
when compared with them. They are " the
best!"
Territorial Governments for the South.
The following is the. resolution of Mr.
Broomall, of Pennsylvania, which passed the
House by a vote of 107 to 37 :
- Besolved, That the Committee on Territo
ries be instructed to inquire into the expedi
ency of reporting a bill providing Territorial
Governments for the several districts of conn- '
try formerly occupied ,hy the once existing
States of Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Ala
bama, Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas, and
giving to all adult male inhabitants born
within the limits of the United States, or
duly naturalized and not participants in the
late Rebellion, full equal political - rights in
such Territorial Governments." i;-
The above is a test vote, which ' shows
that the House is not disposed to favor the
proposition for universal amnesty and uni
versal suffrage.
The Washington correspondent of the N.
T. Tribune says :
" It is the opinion of a prominent Senator,
who has had unusual opportunities of obser
vation, that at the present session of Con
gress an enabling act will be passed, reject
ing the present governments of the rebellious
States as nullities, and that the loyal people
of those States, without respect to color, will
be authorized to choose delegates to consti
tutional conventions, and that the conven
tions will be required to submit the consti
tutor thus formed to a vote of the people
for approval or ; rejection. The Senator
makes these statements with so much earn
estness that little doubt can , be entertained
of his source of informatian. He predicts
that the bill will very shortly be presented
for action."
We predicted that the President's message
would disappoint the fire-eaters of the South.
Their organs bestow doubtful compliments
upon it, and some of them receive it with an
" unmistakable" sneer.
The Wilmington Dispatch says :
" As far as he goes he is very conservative, and
Is disposed to do the Booth what he regards as a
service secure for her the admission of repre
sentation. Bnt he does not go far enough by half.
Indeed, we are forced to believe that he is either
insincere, or of weak intellect He ought to tell
Congress that the test oath which it has passed
for the exclusion of Southern men from office is not
only unconstitutional, but an outrage on the coun
try. : He either knows that this is so, or he is no
statesman; and his opinion on any point of Con
stitutional law, in the last case, is utterly worth
legs. If be knows that the test oath is unconsti
tutional, then he shonld say so like a man, and
not in all his public utterances avoid committing
hims ell, like some miserable county cross road's
politician. - He occupies a position in which he
may afford to despise the arts of demagogism,
and should do so. If it is his purpose to be frank,
and he does not believe that the test oath is un
constitutional, he should employ the services of
some one of sufficient capacity to enlighten him
on that point The letter of Gov. Grab am, pun
ished during the last twelve months, might serve
to assist him in bis research after tbe truth In re
gard to this question. Taking the message all in
all, it is a disappointment" , (
" It is a little remarkable that the President
does not recommend in his late message, as
he did in his message of December, 1865, a
modification of the test oath. Indeed, when
he says, as he does, that only " loyal mem
bers" of Congress should be admitted, and
forbears ttt the' same time to repeat his re
commendation that the oath be modified, he
mvplkdly endorses it. This is what vexes the
Dvtpateh'a.n(L others of that ilk. ' ' '. . ' ' ''r
'The real feeling of the "Southern leaders",
towards the President, is shown in the cool
and contemptous manner in which the Dis
patch advises him to employ th-services of
Mr. Graham.1' This is nearly as good in its
way as the opinion of Gov. Swain, that if
Mr. Graham and Mr. Perry had been admit
ted to seats in the Senate they would have''
inducedthat body to adopt " a wiser scheme '
ol adjustment" than any yet presented. '
Post Officii Roctes op ths ' South.
The net postal receipts from the late insur
gent States for the year ended 30th June last,
were only $75,883 lets than the liabilities for
the mail service in that section.' This is a
small deficit" Previously to the war the pos-.
tal service in many of the "Southern States
was an expense to. tha government The
postal service in the South ought to be increased.
.'. The Welcome to Congress. '
, On the 3rd inst, Congress was welcomed
by a large concourse of citizen to the City
of Washington. ' ' -n,
The Southern Loyalists with representa
tives from every State except South-Carolina
were also present j i' ; -
Judge Carter on behalf of the people de
livered the address of welcome. ' -'
, Speaker Colfax replied. He said :
"But four months since we left this Capi
tol, and yet how crowded with events 1 The
bloody and wicked massacre at New Orleans,
the very week after our adjournment and
the extraordinary speech of the President at .
St Louis, palliating the gnilt of the mur
derers, and charging its grave responsibility
on the Congress orttie United States -t the
two great Philadelphia 1 Conventions, one
memorable for the frank' acknowledgement
that those who denounced Congress were
really arm-in-arm with the men who, tramp
ling on broken oaths, had sought to destroy
the nation's life ; and the' other honored by
the presence of -the faithful Loyalists, who,
when the storm of treason swept over their
States, refused to bow tbe knee to Baal : tbe
expulsion from office of thousands, trusted
and commissioned by our martyred President,
to whom, more than any other equal number
of men, the present Administration was in
debted for the power it wielded their crime
being inflexible fidelity to the principles pro
fessed by the successful candidate for Vice
President in the canvass of 18C4 the hun
dreds of speeches of the Presidential tour
throughout the land, and their republication
in millions of copies of all our prominent
presses, bringing tbe issues to - the hearth
stone of every voter the magnificent re
sponse of the people, from ocean to ocean,
condemning the policy of which they bad
heard so much, and attesting their unshaken
confidence in the Congress which had stood
so faithfully, so fearlessly, and so immova
bly, in the pathway of duty and of righl;
ho'w rapidly have we been making history in
these past few months 1 Thank God, in this
this land the people are the only rulers.
Every two years they resume their sovereign
ty, und at the ballot-box given to them by
the dead of the Revolution they make and
unmake Congress; they approve or condemn
Administrations ; they speak their will ;
they command, and Congresses and Presi
dents must obey.
We return, then, to these halls to carry
out and enforce this decision of the rulers of
the nation the people. No man can mis
understand their will. Four points have
been settled by them beyond all controversy.
1. That the work of reconstruction must
be in the hands of those who have been the
friends, not the enemies of the nation ; that
it must be based on the granite of loyalty,
and not the quicksands of disloyalty ; and
that those whose wicked leadership and
guilty repudiation of solemn oaths plunged
a peaceful country into the bloody conflict of
civil war shall not be clothed with the power
to legislate for the widows and orphans
the kith and kin of the men they have slain
in their attempt to slay the nation itself
2. That the promises of Abraham Lincoln,
in his immortal proclamation, that the free
dom of our emancipated millions should be
maintained, must be fulfilled both in letter
and spirit and guaranteed beyond any pow
er of abridgment in our supreme law ; for
bidding interference by any unfriendly State
with the privileges and immunities of the
liberty granted by the whole nation to all its
people. '
3. That no persons shall be disfranchised
in this Republic on account of their race,
nnd yet have their numbers counted to con
fer increased political power on those dis
franchising them.
4. That the national debt, the cost of our
national existence, shall be forever sacred ;
and that all debts or claims growing out of
the rebellion, or the breaking of fetters that
ended it, shall be forever held illegal or void.
And the people also declared as their de
sire and will that Congress should enforce
this decision of theirs by appropriate legisla
tion; But n the contrary, these terms are
spurned and scornfully rejected by those who
control public opinion and wield political
power in the South ; and the recent election
of most conspicuous secessionists in North
Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, &c, with the
hostile messages of their Governor's is their
defiant reply. . .
. Rejecting the Constitutional amendment,
they show that they insist on representation
in Congress and the Electoral College, for all
the four millions ot their former slaves, thus
ascending to enlarged and increased law-making
power in consequence of the rebellion ;
while, at tbe same time, they not only dis
franchise them and refuse tbem the rights
and protection of Citizenship, but by dis
graceful and oppressive laws, pretending to
regulate labor contracts, and to punish va
grancy, reduce those whom the nation made
free, to a subserviency and serfdom, but little,
if any better, than slavery itself.
Yet while we cannot compel them to ap
prove the constitutional amendment our du
ty to the nation, to justice, to liberty, and to
humanity is none the less. - And, exponents
of the people's will as we are, we cannot
avoid that duty. Indeed, we may see in it
the finger of Providence. Like our fathers,
we have, in the past few years, builded bet
ter than we knew.' In the earlier stage of
the war, how willingly would an overwhelm
ing majority of the people have consented to
perpetual slavery in the Republic if South
ern traitors had taken from our lips the
bloody chalice of civil war, which they com
pelled us to drain to its very dregs I But
God willed otherwise ; and at last, when ev
ery family altar had been crimsoned with
blood, and every cemetery and churchyard
crowded with patriot graves, the nation rose
to a higher plane of duty, and resolved in
these halls that slavery must die.
The question naturally arises, how can
this be done f Surrounded by these able ju
rists and patriotic statesmen, returning here,
as they do, crowned with an. unparalleled
popular endorsement, it might not be fitting
to anticipate their arguments on these vital
themes in the session just opening, . But
when the Constitution declares in its ' open
ing sentence, that "all legislative powers
herein granted shall be vested in a Congress
of the United States" when it solemnly en
joins that " the United States shall guaranty
to every State in this Union a republican
form of government" and when it gives to
Congress full authority " to make all laws
which shall be necessary and proper for car
rying into 'execution all powers vested by
this Constitution in the Government of the'
United States, or in any department or officer
thereof 'the duty and its exercise both
seem to have been specifically anticipated by
the framers of our supreme law." . .
Senator Yates of Illinois spoke as follows:
Mr. Yates, in continuation, said some allu
sion had been made to the question' of the'
admission of the Southern Statea. He had
been asked his views of this matter in Illi
nois, and when asked when he was willing
that the South should come in, he said he
was in no hurry. He would hot be willing
until the right of free speech was recognized
on every foot of American soil from the At-,
lantic to the Pacific ; not until every man
can go into all portions of our country and
enjoy all its privileges ; not until constution
al guarantees confer a lasting peace ; hot so
long as skeletons of Northern- men hang
dangling from limbs of trees in the South ;
until these things are changed, they shall
never come in until Gabriel blows his last
trump. Applause. He thought ' he par
tiallv understood his Democratic friends,and
in his State they were all for negro suffrage.
He believed in universal suffrage, and he
would say to his Democratic friends that all
he wanted was a fair race.- He wanted the
same law for all men, and he thanked God
for this country and this government, which
patted him on the back and said he had as
good a chance to rise in honor and dignity
as any-one else in the country. He desired
a fair race for honor in this country, . where
all are citizens, whether they are English or
American, Chinese or African. It's fair race
and a fair fight ; and he would say to his
Democratic friends that no doubt some
of tbem could beat some of these negroes.
Laughter. They can't all be Fred Doug
lasses ; but if they (the Democrats) would
read the Scriptures and join the Republican
party they had a chance of beating many of
the negroes. He sometimes thought, and
his heart was glad at the prospect, that error
and human wrong is drawing to a close. He
was for man, everywhere,; whether his skin
was browned by an American, an African, or
an Asiatic sun. The color of the skin was
nothing to him.' He was for all men. Ap
plause. , ,
Hon. W. D. Kelly of Pennsylvania said :
The majority alone of those who said well
done to Congress, is more than .the entire
white voting population of the ten late in
surgent States ; and with this endorsement
he took the question of the admission of the
Southern States to himself . He would say
when he would admit them. He was will
ing, when Congress shall have disavowed
those bastard organizations which now rule
over the territory of the ten late insurgent
States ; when having disavowed the products
of usurpation, it shall pass enabling acts by
which the whole people of each State shall
elect a convention to form new constitutions,
which shall be submitted to the whole peo
of the State for their ratification ; and if,
when that constitution is thus submitted, it
shall be discovered that any citizen of any
township, though he be black as the the dev
il, is excluded from voting by reason of his
color, it shall be the cause for the rejection
of such constitution. - Applause. When
the States come with constitutions republi
can in form, he (Mr. Kelley) will agree to
their admission.- But until then he never
would agree to the admission of a single one
of them.
At night the banquet was held. In reply
to a toast, complimentary to Congress, Hon.
Thaddeus Stevens said : .
I pray you, gentlemen, to strengthen our
nerves to do all these things, and more. Aid
us to make " treason odious : to seize the
largest estates of traitors and sell them in
small plantations to industrious men, and
. apply the proceeds to pay pensions to sol
diers and the debt of the nation. Do not
permit us to allow these great criminals to
escape with but ample fines as a warning to
future malefactors, as well as indemnity for in
juries inflicted." . Can you not so brace our
nerves as to induce us to give impartial suff
rage to all men within the States now in our
power ? Less than this with my consent
shall never suffice for reconstruction. I have
been mortified to see Republicans profess
that the new Amendment of the Constitu
tion already proposed would satisfy them.
It was never so intended. It is one step, a
very miucing step, in the line ot reform.
But it might be adopted and leave this Gov
ernment a despotism, leach us to do thor
ough work ; not harsh but just work ; and
may disgrace follow those who arc satisfied
with less. We give various excuses for our
shallow work. Some of us have too much
conscience ; some have too much heart ; some
have friends who own Southern plantations ;
I have no personal allusions, as I am not
speaking of what has happened but what
might
I know not what there is in the proposi
tion that captivates sensible men. ' There is
the music of alliteration, " universal amnes
ty for universal suffrage." But that could
only gratify those who are " pleased with a
rattle," " tickled witn a straw." Jjet us not
be content with such puerile work. We are
laying tbe foundation of a new empire, us
ing all the materials of the old that are fit
for service. This empire is to embrace a
continent and during the lives of some men
living it will contain one hundred millions
ot people.
To be enduring, her institutions and laws
must be homogeneous u to be just, they must
be impartial. No man, or sect or race must
be singled out for special legislation. Let
the same laws apply with strict impartiality
to every human being in the Kepubuc, wheth
er it be in Church or State, in civil or mili
tary life. Then we shall have realized the
glorious dream of " liberty and equality."-
We shall have created an empire whose chro
nology shall put China to shame a republic
more perfect and more practical than we im
agined by lato or More.
Speaker Colfax spoke in reply to a toast
requesting speedy action by Congress, as fol
lows: , i .
He knew right well that no indemnity for
the past could be secured; we could not go
down to those cannon-furrowed battle-fields
and bring to life the mouldering bones of our
dead soldiers there; we could not restore
again to the widow her dead husband, to
the father his dead son : but thank God, we
could have security for the future, and, so
help us God, we would have it. We inten
ded to reconstruct this great nation saved by
the heroism of our brave men, upon such a
corner-stone of loyalty, liberty, justice, and
humanity, as shall stand, enduring as the
eternal ages, until, from ocean to ocean, from
the Lakes to the Gulf, every man, rich or
Boor, learned or unlearned, black or white,
shall have that equal justice which was his
birthright and until a government was es
tablished to which every man, however hum
ble, might look for protection against tyran
nv at home. (Applause. On that platform
this Congress stood and the Fortieth Con
gress would stand, and they would be sus
tained by the people, and, sustained by jus
tice and right, would go forward to a glori
ous triumph. ' -- ' "' ' v '" :
' In reply to a toast " The Loyal Press,nCol
Forney of the Chronicle said: . ' u '
; The few Union newspapers that bravely
defend the doctrines of the ;Radical Congress
and still stand true to the original pledges
now so basely broken by Andrew Johnson,
are published in the midst of hostile com
munities, and, without exception, at the im
minent hazards of the lives of their proprie
tors and editors. There is, I believe, but one
such newspaper in Eastern Virginia, but one
in North-Carolina, (that of the gallant Hol
den,) none in South-Carolina, two in Geor
gia the Savannah Republican, which is now
simply a newspaper without opinions, and the
Loyal Georgian at Augusta, in the same State,
chiefly supported by colored men. In ; Ten
nessee there are four the Memphis Post, the
Nashville Press and Times, the Enoxville
Whig, and the Colored Tennesseean. In Ala
bama one, and that conducted by a colored
man ; in Louisiana two, one conducted by
colored men ; in Mississippi none ; in Texas
none; and in 'Florida one. Even in such
border States as Maryland and Delaware a
Union paper is only published under incon
ceivable difficulties. ' In Kentucky, after sev
eral efforts to establish a paper of this kind,
and after a promising enterprise bad been
commenced in Louisville, the effort was aban
doned in despair and the field surrendered to
the rebels and Copperheads.
In reply to another toast Senator King of
Louisana said ; .
It is the desire of all truly . loyal men in
the rebellious States, and particularly of the
loyal people of Louisiana, that Congress pro
vide for them enabling acts, provisional gov
ernments, with loyal men, possessing the
proper nerve, as provisional governors, and
ignore all previous political governments ;
plainly speaking, rubbing out and beginning
anew. .
The loyal people of Louisiana desire and
pray for universal suffrage, with one except
ion, and that is, that rebels shall be disfran
chised, i i
They are, further, in ' the necessitous con
dition of praying that Congress will protect
their lives, liberty and property. - . '
The loyal people of the entire South most
sincerely pray that Congress will immediate
ly grant enabling acts, negro and colored
suffrage, and rebel disfranchisement. One
God, a loyal people, and one undivided
country.
THIRTEENTH TOAST.
43. The Late Rebel States : By their at
tempts to destroy the Government they for
feited the rights conferred by it and cannot
claim the positions and privileges of the loy

take back seats or do without seats.
Responded to by three cheers.
