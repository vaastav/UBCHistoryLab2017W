Special IKtpaUfi to Tht CMeaoo Tribun*-
Washington, D. C., Dec. 15.—Tho discus
sion upon tho Presidential succession in case
of tho death, removal, or Inability of the
President and Vice-President promises to
become general In tho Senate. Yesterday
three of the older Senators road carefully
prepared speeches, in which radically differ
ent views were taken ns to the proper law for
Congress to pass. Tlie discussion was re
newed this morning, and two essays were
read and one was partially delivered when
the Senate went Into executive session. As
tvas the case yesterday, so today tho Sena
tors expressed. vitally different vie w« upon
tho matter. These differences rfro funda
mental, and If in
THE REMAINING SPEECHES,
(vhlch are to be delivered botli at the present
time imd when tho J udlclary Committee shall
have reported, these differences of opinion
are found to remain It will be impossible to
pass any law. At least Senators so t hink at
present. Mr. Garland, for Instance, in his
sitfcch this morning, held a very different
view from Umt entertained by Mr. Maxcy
yesterday. Mr. Garland docs not believe
that Congress has any power to specify
what shall -bo . considered as Presiden
tial. disability, or to proscribe any means
by which such disability shall be
determined. In Ids opinion, if any
court or Commissioners, or body of men,
a single mini,, should have the right, by act
of Congress, to inquire into
THE PRESIDENTIAL DISABILITY,
tho complication which would bo likely to
arise would he Infinltly greater than any
which could result from leaving the matter
where it now stands. Mr. Garland thought
wo had a decidedly severe lest last summer.
Then It was well known by certain public
men whoso duty It was to know that Gen.
Garlleld was as absolutely nimble to perform
Presidential duties for nearly three months
os lie was on the 20th day of September
last—Urn day after ho died. Such an
actual illustration of disability without
any serious resulting evils was, In Air. Car
land’s opinion, as strong a case as we should
ho likely to got Air. Afnxoy and Air. Coke,
If the latter was understood correctly, ex
pressed precisely opposit views. They be
lieved that, under the Constitution,
CONOUEB9 HAD THE LIGHT
to name such officer ns should act us Presi
dent, and that of necessity Congress must
bathe instrument.of determining when a
disability began and ended. Now, these two
.radically different views, If generally enter
tained, make It impossible for any law to
bo passed which would solve the question
that made so much discussion last summer.
Such, at least, Is the opinion of men hero
who have given the matter a good deal of
study. With regard to the proper officer to
succeed to the powers and duties of Presi
dent, or, os the Constitution puls It, u toact
im President until there shall bo a new elec
tion,” an equally radical difference exists.
The weight of opinion, as expressed in the
speeches yesterday and today, however,
seem to bo that the present law Is all wrong.
The Senators find a stumbllng-Dlock to
Tins KNFOUCEMENT OF THE PUF.SENT LAW
In the word " officer,” which appears in the
Constitution. There It Is said: "Congress
may declare what officer shall act as Presi
dent” The Senators soy that neither the
President pro tempore nor the Speaker of
the Douse la un officer of the United States.
Thu difficulty, us appears from, the six
speeches already delivered, does not arise so
much from uny difference of opinion regard
ing the present law. That is generally ad
mitted to bo Inaccurate, if Illsnot unconstitu
tional. Thu great trouble Is to And such of
ficer as, In the opinion of Congress, could
constitutionally bo designated to net as Pres
ident, Air. Garland, with some others, did
nut think that the Chief Justice or any mem
ber of the Judiciary ought to bo designated.
Aside from every other consideration, his
opinion Is that it would ho
A VIOLATION OP THE CONSTITUTIONAL IN-
TENTION
to keep absolutely distinct Uie three depart*
luenls of tho Government, Mr. Garland said
that we had experienced once Uie result of
.committing Uie Judiciary with the leg*
jslutivo functions, and It had been u
very sad experience. Ills reference,
of course, was to tho Kloctorul
Commission. Mr. Garland practically ad*
milled that In Uie bill which he had uttered
there were some objections which might be
serious,, possibly fatal, lie desired to have
the Judiciary Committee and Uie Senate con*
elder them with great care before Uto bill
should become a law, It it ever did. He did
not specify any of these objections. He did,
however, say that the objections which Mr.
Deck made to the bill were unimportant, ami
.were snail us
COUffi) UB VEItY EASILY MET
by adding three or four lines to the bill. Mr,
,l!eck |iad suggested that to designate Uie
Secretary of State or of the Treasury as
Uie officer to act as President might result
in designating an officer who was equally
responsible with the President In violation
of law which led to un impeachment. Uu
also suggested Umt tho Secretary of Statu
or of the Treasury might bounder 85 years
nf age, or might bo an alien by birth. Mr.
JnrJaud said Umt these objections had been
made In tho Sonata thirty years ago, whim
tho same subject was under discussion.
They could ho met by simply adding to Iho
bill the words: •• Provided, that such Secre
tory shall not ho Ineligible under tho Consti
tution.” If, however, such persons wore in
eligible, It would scum to ho
UNNECESSARY to pit any such proviso

Air. Garland made no argument In support
of his hilt, except to suggest that tho Cabinet
officer* met the constitutional rcqultcmeuU
in that tltov were officers of the Govonunnnt.
They were also executive oflicers, and, what
was an equally cogent reason with him, they
were officers In sympathy with the Exccn
ttvc ami with the people, whose vote hod
elected tho Executive. Sir. Garland said
that' ho would Imvo regarded It ns a very
great disaster had President Arthur been re
moved. resigned, or died ami a Democratic
President pro tempore should have assumed

an overthrowing of the wishes of Hie majori

On thin point Senator Jones of Florida

was to provide for a choice of Electors, who
were to elect the President. The Constitu

maintenance of this or that particular man
In the office.,
These points Illustrate the wide and funda
mental difference of opinion among the Sen
ators, and tho speeches that still remain to
ho made will even more strongly express
this divergence of views. The Senators,
however, are determined if they can to pass
a law which will make it impossible for any

occur.
from the “ record.”
To the TTtiUm Auoelaitd Prm,
Washington, i>. C., Dec. 15.—1 n the Sen-
nte tlio dismission of Uie Presidential succes
sion in the contingencies provided for was
resumed, and Mr. Garland addressed tlie Sen
ate. Ho said the President pro tcm. of Iho
Senate and Vbo Speaker of the House had
been held to bo “ officers" In tho sense In
which tho word Is used in the clause of tho
Constitution, inasmuch as they were tho
officers of their Houses respectively. But
enough of doubt had been thrown upon it
to roqniro tho matter to be placed boyomt
further cavil. His answer to Uio objections
of tho Senator from Kentucky (Beck) that
the Cabinet odicers (to wlibni the Hue of suc
cession is Riven by Ids hill) might bo ineligi
ble, ns not possessing Presidential quniillcn
lions, was that n requirement thqt such of
ficers shall have these qualifications could
be added to the bill, also a provision to meet
the possible caso of a Cabinet Implicated ns
jmrttccps crlmfniswlth the Impeached Pres
ident. Ha disagreed wltii that Senator as to
Uuj propriety of vesting the provisional suc
cession in tlie J udges of tho Supremo Court,
as the Presidential duties were beyond ques
tion such ns required au executive rather
than a Judicial or legislative officer. Tho
succession should descend lu that lino which
was indicated by the verdict at the quadren
nial election.
AS TO WHEN PRESIDENTIAL INABILITY
• ARISES,
or ns to who is to determine that inability,
ho said Congress is unable to determine, and
tho only means for the determination of that
question would ho a constitutional amend
ment. The clause of tho Constitution simply
gives to Congress Uio right to say wimt
officer shall act; and neither in that nor
anywhere else Is it empowered to pass
upon inability. The truth Is, it was intended
to be left to Uie President mid Vice-Presi
dent as a matter of comity, to be settled be-
tweon them. If Vice-President Arthur had
hcenlnfuU accord with President Garlleld,
did any one doubt ho would have been
called on to act in the latter’s stead within
ten days after the President was shot, be
cause it was then generally known, notwith
standing the dispatches that were sent out
froth Washington to tho contrary,
Vhattiie president could not survive ?
Suppose Uio idea of the Inability’ of the
President become generally entertained by
the country, and that, upon being wailed on
and Informed of tho popular belief, ho de
nied there was any ground for it, and held on
to Ids office, how could tho remedy bo np-'
plied? There was no remedy, for behind
Uie President was tho military to support
his claim.
TUore-was no means of determining what
constituted inability, ns the constitutional
provision was Intended to be self-sustaining,
without any Intervention by Congress with a
coordinate branch of the -Government. Va
rious instances of Inability might bo sug
gested, one of which was the absence of thu
President at the head of the army, in which
case the Vice-President would act. The
measure ho had proposed, vesting the suc
cession In executive officers, In contrtwlls
tlnctlon with the legislative and Judicial
officers of the Government, although open
to objections that had not yet been suggest
ed, was the best ho could conceive of.
COKE AND JONES.
Air. Coke urged the duty of Congress to
provide promptly for averting complications:
and Air. Jones (Fla.) advocated an amend
ment to Air. Beck’s resolution so as to pro
vide for an Inquiry, whether any additional
provisions of taw or changes in the power of
the Constitution are necessary to secure sta-
bility in the office of President pro tern, of
the Senate when the Vice-President becomes
President of the United States, In the con
tingencies provided for. Air. Jones’ argu
ment was not concluded.

Just five minutes before tho close of tho

This brought up Vest, of Missouri, who In
a brief speech (brief because It was cut oIT
by the expiration of the morning hour) said
somo very severe things on the woman-suf
frage question. Ills Idea was that. If woman
sulfrago was established, it would tre
mendously add to tho volume of Illiterate
sulfrage, and that, while tho women of tho
country might rush to tho polls, not one lady
in a thousand would go there. He intended
to use the words “ woman” and “lady” ns
distinguishing tho Inlulllgent, respectable,
and cultured of tho fumntu sex from those
who are possessed of tho dpposlt of thoso
qualities. Hoar's resolution, It Is thought,
did not need Vest’s speech to bury IU The
galleries wore occupied by several prominent
suffragists, men and women, and Vest now

THREE PER CENTS.
COMMITTER ACTION ON MIF.RMAN’S BILL.
ftofctal DUratcfi to The Chicago Tribune,
Washington, 1). C., Dec. 15,—The Senate
Finance Cammlttoo today reported Senator
Sherman’s Hefundlng bill favorably to tho
Senate, .with important amendments. Tho
committee met ntlOo’clock to hear Uio views
of Secretary Folger, who was invited to ap
pear before the measure was disposed of. The
Secretary did not enter into any argument.
He simply answered tho questions put him
by members of tho committee, and expressed
Ids opinion tliat it would not bo advisable to
refund any portion of tho continued 5s and
Os at ff per cent His reasons were practical
ly the same ns those'enunciated In his an
nual report—that it would,bo more advisable
for tho Government to retain the privilege of
paying the d‘«f per cents at pleasure than to
put $000,000,000 of R per cent bunds beyond
its reach fur live years.
Tin: SECRETARY WAS VERY MODEST
In advancing ids views, and said that it was
simply a question of expediency. He had
no doubt of the ability of tho Govcftuncnt
to Heat the 3 per cents if it was thought ad
visable to Issue them. The most Important
change In tho bill was a reduction of Uio
amount of 3 per cunt bonds to be Issued
from 5300,000.000 to 5300,000,000. Tills re
duction was made for tho purpose of keep
ing a larger amount of the debt at tho op-
tion of the Government for redemption than
was contemplated in the original bill; Thu
National banks hold 5‘M1, 000.000 of tho V> X A
per cents at tho date of tho recently-issued
report of the Controller of tho Currency.
Thu changes made in tno bill allow tho hold
ers of 3>? per cents to exchange them for
now bonds—a privilege of which the' banks
will undoubtedly bo glad to avail themselves.
GUESSES.
It la as yot impossible to predict what sort
of a 3 per cent bill the Senate will pass.
Oho thing, however, is quite probable—viz.:
that the Ways and Menus Committee will
pigeon-hole any bill passed by the Senate,
and will insist on maturing, reporting, und
passing Its own measure. This prospect de
prives the Sherman bill of much of. its Im-
IKirtance. In trnin, its importance lies only
in the fact that Uio Senate Finance Commlt-
tee, including such men as Sherman and Mor
rill, is shown to bo In favor of a 3 per cent
loan.

IN DEFICITSH OF AUTnim.
what this rniicNHs op Tin: imrisiDKNT say
AIIOUT «W INTKSTIOHB.
Sonic of the partlcutur friends of President
Arthur are endeavoring to make U appear
that ho is not under Stalwart influence, and
among these there Is a great dual of talk.
One friend of the President lias been particu
larly loud in his assertion Mint Cameron,
Conkllng, and Grant would not be permitted
to dictate to the Administration. On the
contrary, he said, tbo Stalwart leaders bad
been put oil from time to Utu % and had re
cently been growing very impatient. That
they wore disposed to dictate matters and
control the President this informant does
not deny. He says, however, ttmt lie litis al
ready very strongly intimated that, while lie
Is disposed to listen to their suggestions, lie
will puna It no persona) interference. While
(bis gentleman has no doubt but what the
President is unite willing to accord the Stal
warts alt they ask, he Is indisposed to revolu
tionize things. It must be done slowly tmd
by piecemeal, without shock or salination.
The Cabinet must be changed one at a time.
In a word; the Administration, from the Cab
inet to tho whisky-gagers, must be Stal
wartized, but it must bu. so grad
ually done that no olio will know
they are hurl, and so that the parly
will bo carried with it instead of divided In
angry discussion over tho unices, it Is Imre
where tbo Rosses tlllVer with the-President.
They chafe under tho delay. What they
want they Want right off. They are crowd
ing him for tho spoils, and he refuses to bo
crowded. Tho Pennsylvania Stalwarts are
urging the removal of the Pittsburg Collect
or. urging Oyster for Public Printer, urging
Gillillan for Assistant Secretary of the Treas
ury, and urging twenty other things, and uij
pear to be In an urgent mood; but whirl have
they got V This Is the w.iy Air. Arthur’s
friends meet the accusation that tho Hosses
are running the President. He admits, how
ever. that this will bu atttnlw irt Administra
tion to the backbone, but tho President will
go nt matters in a cautious manner.

Mr. Plumb today introduced a bill author
izing the owners of silver bullion to deposit
it in any mint or assay office muter such reg
ulations os tbo Secretary of the Treasury
may make, and receive therefursilver dollars
or silver certificates up to tbo market value
of bullion. T(iu bill also modifies the Sliver
bill of 18711 by providing that the coinage of
sliver dollars shall contlmicunlll tho amount
of dollars represents bO ppr coat of the sliver
certificates outstanding, and that tho silver
dollar coinage shall be'kept at this propor
tion and outgo beyond it. Plumb says his
Idea Is not only to avoid the accumulation’ of
moro silver dollars than are needed, but to
keep on hand all that are needed; that It is a
useless expense to Keep Urn mints running to
coin money nut needed In circulation or for
tbo redemption ot certificates.

that a court of Intermediate Jurisdiction wilt
