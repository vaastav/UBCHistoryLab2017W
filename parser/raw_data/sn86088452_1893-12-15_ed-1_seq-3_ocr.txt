The last general elections were not
nearly so disastrous totha Third party
as some people would make out In
Virginia for instance tho Democrats
have nothing to brag about as their
victory was tho result of a coalition
with the Ilepublicans and a purchase
of tho negro vote To my mind the

CoL George Washington Jones of
Bastrop while at Waco recently at
tending United States court was
asked some questions by a Dallas News
reporter as follows
Do you like the shape events are
taking colonel the reporter in
quired
I like everything except the re
tarding agencies Col Jones replied
Prom the beginning events have
moved in the right direction as to
general tendency Every day brings
us nearer to the sound money is ue
What is sound money colonel
Money issued by tho government
bearing its fiat Money is only money
by permission of the government
without any regard to its material
Money only means an article receiv
able by tho government in payment of
its taxes
j Would government issue inde
pendent of a gold basis circulate in
foreign countries
Itwould not No foreign money
can circulate in ay country Yhen
it leaves home it departs from tho
money and becomes a part cf the
commercial volume This is thc caso
whether tho stamp of the government
be placed on gold or silver or paper
Hut if paper is the money it could
not join tho commeicial volume1 thc
reporter ventured
Well it would be money working
In the circulation effecting its ends
and it would serve all the purposes ol
money Gold and silver will always
bo in commerce and can always bo
employed as far as they will go for
money Tho money volume must bo
increased to the needs of the > oople
tmd the day is coming when that will
bo tho case
Do you favor free and unlimited
coinage of silver
Public sentiment is formulating on
silver and it will turn to greenbacks
Faper bearing the fiat ol the govern
ment is tho loming money and it will
bo honest money All money of every
nation is fiat money Without the fiat
it is not money Gold is sold as a
commoiity light weight or heavy
weight and s lver the same Neither
of them is money without tho fiat
after which they bring 100 cents on
tho dollar Make paper money bear
ing tho fiat of the government receiv
able for all dues and that will end the
vexations and give tho peoplo rest
What about tho tariffff
Oh the everlasting tariff That is
the great delayer Let the tariff
alono Iet it bo an after considera
tion Tho tariif question should not
bo raised until the people have enough
money and honest money Not money
because of the fiat of Wall street but
money by the gra o of tho govern
ment The tariff is good enough as it
is I beliove however that by means
of tariff agitation the gteat question
of money can be held in abeyance but
in the end and bjfore many years
the true principles enunciated by tho
tfat party will prevail

When one says of anything that it
is not worth a straw one means to
imply that it is worthless for what
can be the valuo of a straw The
older saying was not worth a rush
and this brings out the origin of tho
phrase better In the days before
carpets it was the custom to strew the
floor with rushes Whon guests of
rank were ent rtained rushes green
fresh and sweet were spread for
them but folk of lowor degree had to
be content with rushes that had al
ready been used while still humbler
persons that had to do without any
as not even being worth a rush
