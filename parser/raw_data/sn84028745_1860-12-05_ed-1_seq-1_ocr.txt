Tyrant on Concession to His People. The Dreariness of Mammoth Cave-The
Effect of Music There.
. A correspondent of Jc hC$ Journal of
Jfuttreays:
"Were you ever in the Mammoth Cave?
It is, with all its wonders, the most Uod
forsnken, dreary, gloomy spot, mortal ever
entered Yet there is some strange mystio
power in the place to transfigure the weak
est, most wretched music into harmony fit
for the celestial spherec.
Yon know, in the first picture of Cole's
Voyage of lAf, the gloomy river of the past
from which floats out into life and light the
little boat of the baby voyager. The stream
issues from a dark, rocky cavern, mysterious
and unknown. Such stream is this on
which we are embarked. 8ilent and gloomy.
dark and mysterious, it serves as a typo of the
past and the future of the past mystery
whence all life evolves, of the inscrutable
lulnre whither all lite tends.
" The foclrair of security is not verr great.
The boats sink down almost to the water's
edge, and the perpendicular slippery rock on
cither side oners no ledge on which a ship
wrecked voyager might nnu a temporary
footing. Above, sometimes so low that you
must crouch, to avoid it, and again so high
os to be scarcely visible, rises the rock-roof,
va iv no ri tin tuiuid, iiiwi nuv iw.-ivvt
whileAhe water in which you glide is thirty
feet in depth, and as cold as the brow of a
corpse,. There is no sound but the rippling
made by the boat; not a cricket along, the
shoreless stream; ot a fish to plunge up and
nflbu n uiuuieut lu vuc air ueiuru ruvurutiiK w
its watery home no symptom of life no
sound, no motion, save that inado by our
selves. "-Hark I there is a sound! Far off a
delicate Bhade of music, so taint as to seism
the ghost of some wandering echo. But bye
degrees It increaees. it becomes clearly
dinned. Rich harmony, trembling with
strange sensuous wildness, fluttering around
the rocky protections, swelling m waves ot
uuriuuuv iu ibu Hicut:u ruui nuuvu. nun iv
appears to come one direction, now from an.
other. Anon ahigher note or strain is heard,
like pome clear voice rising above a mighty
chorus. Never did syren sing more magic
songs to listening traveler neves- did the
mysterious maiden of Lurleibnrg chant more
entrancing melody to the unwary boatman
Who floats along the moonlit ithiue.
"Suddenly a turn of the boat brings yon
opposite n break in the perpendicular rocky
hore, ufl, perched upon a moss of broken
rock you see a party ot lour negroes playing
upon vioimsana- a cornet; inose are tne
syrens, these tlio Lnrlincs of Kcho river,
Out on the earth's surface their mmLo would
be merely quaint and odd, but here, in the
Mammoth Cave, it is weird and nnearthly.
11 Floating away, out of sight of the above
minstrels who are, in fact, the barber, boot
black, or waiter from the hotel at the mouth
of the cave their music resumes its super
natural tones and effect, and so, until we
land at the opposite shore of the dark river,
it haunts the ear with its peculiar harmony,
while ever after .it forms the most vivid
reminiscence of a visit to the Mammoth
Cave.1

There is no wt -6f blinking the fact, or

she can not get a good partner, she will

unnecessary to go back and inquire hew this
condition was brought about, or who is re
sponsible. Every body knows that the Pierce
and Buchanan Administrations, aided by
Douglas and otner reckless leaders, must an
swer for the crime. The question now is.
how are we to meet the crisis at hand, and
how dispose of it with the least shock to our
institutions, and tuo least injury to all con
cerned? The conspiracy to combine the' Cotton
States under an indepcudent Government,
with the reopening ot the Atncan slave
trade as its leading idea, is not of recent ori
gin. - It has been progressing crraduallv for
years, and become more compact aud united
as the inevitable loss ot the power so long
directed by that influence, approached its
culmination. If Colonel Fremont had been
elected four years ogOj a demonstration
would have been made. If was all planned

imagine how soon the lust remnant of life

and to add to the sufferings of the lust hour,
a man pinches very tightly the great toes of

Prcfesssor B. Silliman. jr.. hog "recently

find his report at great length in the Xt

to the chemist only, and other portions of it
of general interest. . The products of the oil
ae developed by the retort, were eight. Only
the last two or three appeared at all stiffened

Poetry Not a Progressive Art.
The London Review contends that poetry
is not one of the progressive arts, and gives
a sketch of the processes through which it is
continually revolving :
roetry is not one of the progressive arts.
In the course of a single generation, and that
one of the earliest in a nation's history, it
will often attain to a power and excellence
which no future efforts may Biirpass; and the
accumulation of one age is so far from prov
ing on assistance and benefit to the next,
that it rather enfeebles its successor, induc
ing it to place a false relianoe upon resources
not at its command, and acting as a stimu
lant to extravagance of effort only to pro
duce poverty and perlshableness of result.
' As a general rule, poetry may be said to be
passing mrougii three processes which ever
lastingly repeat themselves. First is the
rough period, when intellect and fancy are
sufficiently awakened to strive vainly with
the obstacles of nndcvcloped lauguage.Then
the era of triumphant genius, which makes
all the material around it flexible to its will.
and of its own Instinct lights njwa tlio com
binations nnd the laws which insure lasting
success. Then follows the age of merely
imitative effort, when men strive rather to
be something like that which their predeces
sors had been than to rival them in new
fields. Soon people find out the way of pro
ducing something which looks so like the
originals bequeathed to them, as to pass cur
rent for a material combining equal excel
lence wilh the advantage of greater ease and
cheapness ol manufacture.
Tins goes on until the imitative invention
bos been curried to utter exhaustion, until
production becomes so easy that every one
can produce; and then tlie natural effect
takes place. The reaction acts in with a

Life and Fashion in San Francisco.
A correspondent of the New York 2'imee
says:
jv ew lork is equally it not n more ex
pensive place to lire in than San Francisco:
rent lor tne same Kina ot a nouse is greater
than in New-York. Servant hire is cheaper,
to be sure, but then marketing here is nuite
as reasonable. There a lady housekeeper
nas ine satisiaction oi seeing her lindgo:
wearing better clothes than she herself pos
sesses, which is of itself a great- -satisfaction
to any lady, tor she knows where she can
borrow in cate of need. There's no use in
talking, women, be they high or be they low,
run as naturally to clothes as a Newfound
land dog takes to water, and In this place
the sole aim and object of their lives appears
to be to out-dress each other. It does me
cood as I sit up at mv window on the corner
commanding a view of our "vanity fair," to
see them sailing along, feeling so good when
they think they have something new no one
Las.
There's such a toss of the head, and even
their very ribbons seem to sny, "Now. what
do you say?" Bridget, who inspects all her
mistress's clothes and tries them on in her
absence, borrows the pattern on the sly, And
has one suade just like it, and then gives
warning ana leaves ner place tor the pleasure
of having two or three days' time to 'sport
ner new garment, mere s a great run here
on a new style of feminine overcoats that are
so terribly ugly and unbecoming, Bridget
won't adopt them even; they seem to be
cross between a Zouave cloak and an over
erown paletot crivinir the wearers a "fkst"
look. They are altogether too masculine to
be becoming. San Francisco follows New
Yoik, and has run very much to purple. It's
all purple, from head to foot. The earliest
birds in the fashions in this country are
set of fast young ladies who havo a great

The word, transcendentalism, is in frequent
use, but is not always correctly uudurutood.

But the true signification is this: The basis
of Locke's philosophical system is that
knowledge is received into the soul through
the medium of the senses, and is to bejudged
of and analyzed by the understanding. This
may be called the sensuous philosophy,
Kant, on tho contrary, denies that all knowl
