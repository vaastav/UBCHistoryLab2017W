sympathy with criminals to weaken our
hands In upholdinB the law; and if men
seek to destroy life or property Dy mob
Violence there should be no impairment
of the power of the courts to deal wfth
them in the most summary and effective
way possible. liut far as possible the
abuse of the power should be provided
against by some such law as I advocated
last year.
"In this matter of Injunctions there Is
lodged in the hands of the judiciary a
necessary power which is nevertheless
subject to the possibility of grave abuse.
It Is a power that should be exercised
with extreme care and should be sub
ject ,to tho Jealous scrutiny of all men,
and condemnation should be meted out
as much to the Judge who falls to use
H boldly when necessary as to the Judge
who uses it wantonly or oppressively.
Cf course, a judge strong enough to be
lit for his office will nJoln any resort
to violence or intimidation, especially by
conspiracy, no matter what his opiniou
may be of the rights of the original quar
rel. There must be no hesTtntion in
dealing with disorder. Hut there must
likewise be no such abuse of the in
junctive power as Is Implied In forbidding
laboring men to strive for their own bet
torment In peaceful and lawful ways;
nor must the Injunction be used merely
to aid some bis corporation In carrying
out schemes for Its own aggrandizement.
It must be remembered thnt a prelim
inary injunction In a labor case. If
granted without adequate proof (even
when Authority can be found to support
the conclusions of law on which it Is
founded), may often settle tho dispute
between the parties; and therefore If
improperly granted may do Irreparable
wrong, let thora are many Judges who
assume a matter-of-fact course granting
f. a preliminary injunction to be tha
ordinary and proper Judicial disposition
of such cases; and there have undoubt
edly been flagrant wrongs committed
by Judges in connection with labor dis
putes even within the last few years,
altho I think much less often than in
former years. Such Judges by their un
wise action immensely strengthen the
hands of those who are strlvinc entirely
"to do away with the power of Injunction;
iflnd therefore such carele3 use of the
llnjunctivo process tends to threaten its
rvery existence, for If the American peo
ple ever become convinced that this
iprocess Is habitu.ly abused, whether in
(matters affecting labor or in matters af
ifectlng corporations, It will be well-nigh
impossible to prevent its abolition."
j The Negro Problem.
The nejrro problem Is giver considera
ble attention, after calling attention to
the fact that no section of the country
fs free from fault., and that no section
lias occasion to Jter at the shortcomings
of any other section, be turns to the sub
ject of lynching, and especially as ap
plied to the negro of the south. He says
the greatest foisting cause for mob law
is the perpetration by the blacks of the
crime of rape, a cflne which he terms
even worse than mirder. He quotes the
admonitions to the white people spoken
by Gov. Candler, of Georgia, some vears
ago. and by Gov. Jelka, of Alabama, re
cently, and then says:
"Every colored man should realize
"that the worst enemy of his race is the
'negro criminal, and above all the ne
gro criminal wh commits the dread
ful crime of rape; and it should be felt
as in the highest degree an offense
eeralnst the whole country, and against
the colored race in particular, for a
colored man to fail to helf the officers
of the law in hunting down with all
possible earnestness and zeal every
puch Infamous offender. Moreover, in
my judgment, the crime of rape should
always be punished with death, as is
the case with murder; assault with In
tent to commit rape should be made a
capital crime, at least in the discretion
of the court; and provision should be
made by which the punishment may
follow immediately upon the heels of
the offense; while the trial should be
bo conducted that the victim need not
be wantonly shamed while giving tes
timony, and that the least possible
publicity shall be given to the details.
The irembers of t,e white race on
the other hand should understand that
every lynching represents by just so
much a loosening of the bands of civ
ilization; that the spirit of lynching
lnevrtably throws into prominence in
the community all the foul and evil
creatures who dwell therein. No man
fin take part in the torture of a hu
man being without having his own
moral nature permanently lowered.
Kvery lynching meivis jut so much
moral deterioration in all the children
who have any knowledge of it. and
therefore just so mui additional
trouble for the next generation of
Americans.
"Let Justice be both sure and ewlft;
but let it be justice under the law,
and not the wild and crookoii savagery
of a nxob.
Need for Nejro Education.
"There is another matter which has
a direct bearing upon this matter of
lynching and of the brutal crime which
(sometimes calls it forth and at other
times merely furnishes the excuse for
Its existence. It Is out of the question
for our people ns a whole permanently
to rise by treading down any of their
own number, liven those who them
selves for the moment profit by such
maltreatment of their fellows will In
the long run also suffer. No more
.shortsighted policy can be Imagined
than. In the fancied Interest of one
class, to prevent the education of an
other class. The free public school, the
chance for each boy or girl to get a
pood elementary education, lies nt the
foundation of our whole political situ
ation. In every community the poor
est citizens, those who need the schools
most, would be deprived of them if
they only received school facilities
proportionately to the taxes they paid.
This is as true ot one portion "of our
country as of another. It is as true
for the negro as for the white man.
The white man. if he is wise, will de
cline to allow the negroes in a mass to
grow to manhood and womanhood
without education. Unquestionably ed
ucation such as Is obtained In our pub
lic schools does not do everything to-
wuius iiniMiis ;i nutu i. goon citizen;
but it does much. The lowest and most
brutnl criminals, those for Instance
who commit ho crime of rape, are In
the great majority men who have had
either no education or very litle; Just
as they are almost Invariably men who
own no property; for the man who
puts money by out of his earnings,
like the man who acquires education,
is usually lifted above mere brutal
criminality. Of course the best type
of education for the colored man. "ta
ken as a whole, is such education as
Is conferred in schools like Hampton
and Tuskegee; whore the boys - and
girls, the young men and young wo
men, are trained industrially as well
as in the ordinary public school
branches. The graduates of these
schools turn out well In the great ma
jority of cases, and hardjy any of them
become criminals, while what little
criminality there is never takes the
form of that brutal violence which in
vites lynch law. Every graduate of
these schools and for the matter of
that every oher colored man or wo
man who leads & life so useful and
honorable as to win the good will and
respect of those whites .whose neigh
bor he -or she is. thereby helps the
whole colored nr? as it can be lumped
In no other way; for next to the negro
h'mself. the man who can do most to
lp the negro is his white neighbor
ho lives near him; and our steadv
effort should be to better the relations
between the two. Great tho the bene
fit of these schools has been to their
colored pupils and to the colored peo
ple. It may well be questioned whether
the benefit hy not been nt least as
great to the white people among whom
these colored pupils live after they
graduate."
Capital and Labor.
On the subject of coital and labor
the president talfes the agitators of Mass
hatred to task and says '"to preacb
hatred to the rich man, as such. . . .
to seek to mislead and Inflame to mad
ness honest men whose lives are hard
and who have not the kind of mental
training which will permit them to ap
preciate the danger In the doctrine?
preached is to commit a crime against
the bodv politic and to be falsa to every
worthy 'principle and tradition of Amer
ican national life." Continuing on this
Abject he says:
. "XL . xiaia v. reopi., jgt& -tyo&nih
mechanics, rarmers, merchants, work
ers with head or hand, the men to
whom American traditions are dear,
who love their country and try to act
decently by their neighbors, owe it to
themselves to remember that the most
damaging blow that can be given pop
ular government is to elect an un
worthy and sinister agitator on a
platform of violence and hypocrisy,
whenever such an issue is raised In
this country nothing can be gained by
flinching from It. for in such case dem
ocracy fs itself on trial, popular self
government under republican forms le
itself on trial. The triumph of the
mob is just as evil a thing as tho tri
umph of the plutocracy, and to havi
escaped one danger avails nothing
whatever if we sucuumb to the other.
Ib the end tho honest man. whether rich
or poor, who earns his own living and
tries to deal justly by his fellows, has
as much to fear from the Insincere
and unworthy demagog. promising
much and performing nothing, or else
performing nothing but evil, who
would set on the mob to plunder the
rich, bs from the crafty corruptlonlt.
who. for his own ends, would permit
the common people to be exploited by
the vjry wealthy. If we ever let this
government fall into the hands of men
fit either of these two classes, we shall
show ourselves fals" to America's past.
Moreover, the demagog and corrup
tlonist often work hand In hand. There
are at this moment wealthy reaction
aries of such obtuse morality that they
regard the public servant who prose
cutes them when they violate the law.
or who seeks to make them bear their
proper share of the public burdens, as
being even more objectionable than
the violent agitator who hounds on
the mob to plunder the rich. There is
nothing to choose between such a re
actionary and suoh an agitator; funda
mentally they are alike in their selfish
disregard of the rights of others; an4
It is natural that they should Join In
opposition to any movement of which
the aim is fearlessly to do exact afld
even Justice to all."
Railroad Employees Hours.
He asks for the passing of the bill lim
iting the number of hours of
employment of railroad employes, and
classes the measure as a very modertc
me. He says the aim of all should ie
U steadily reduce tho number of hoiif3
of labor, with as a goal the general In
troduction of an eight-hour day, but In
sists that on the Isthmus of Panama the
conditions are so different from what i
they are here that the Introduction of an
eight-hour day on the canal would be
absurd, and continues, "Just about as ab
surd as it Is, so far as the lsthmii3 is
concerned, where white labor cannot be
employed, to bother as to whether the
work Is done by alien black men or alien
yellow men."
Investigation of Disputes.
He urges the enactment of a drastic
child labor law for the District of Co
lumbia and the territories, and a federal
investigation of the subject of child and
female labor throughout the country.
He reviews the woei of the commission
appointed to investitive laboe conditions
in the coal fields of Pennsylvania in VM2,
and refers to the wish of the commission
"that the state and federal governments
should provide the machinery for what
may be called the compulsory Investiga
tion of controversies between employers
and employes when they arise." After
referring to the fact that a bill has al
ready been introduced to this end he
says:
"Many of these strikes and lockouts
would not have occurred had the parties
to the dispute teen required to appear
before an unprejudiced body representing
the nation und, face to face, state the
reasons for their contention. Ii most
instances the dispute would doubtless be
iound to be due to a misunderstanding
by eakh of the other's rights, aggravated
by an unwilliigness of either party to ac
cept as true the statements of the other
as to tho Justice or injustice of the mat
ters in dispute. The exercise of a Ju
dicial spirit by a disinterested body
representing the fetleral government,
such as would be provided by a commis
sion on conciliation and arbitration
would tend to create an atmosphere of
friendliness and conciliation between con
tending parties; and the giving each side
an equal opportunity to present fully its
case in the presence of the other woud
prevent many disputes from developing
into serious strikes or lockouts, and in
other cuses, would enable the commis
sion to persuade the opposing parties to
come to terms.
"In this age of great corporate and la
bor combinations, neither employers rsr
employees shou'rd be left completely at
the mercy of the stronger party to a dis
pute, regardless of the righteousness of
their respective claims. The proposed
measure would be in the lino of securing
recognition of the fact that in many
strikes the public has itself an interest
wnich cannot wisely be disregarded; an
interest not merely of general conven
ience, for the question of a Just and
poper pubblc policy must afso be con
sidered. In all legislation of this kind
It Is well to advance cautiously, testing
each step by the actual results; the step
proposed can surely be safely taken, for
the decisions of the commission would
not bind the rarties in legal fashion, and
yet would give a chanco for public opin
ion to exert its full forco for the right."
Control of Corporations.
A considerable portion of the message
is devoted t the subject of federal con
trol of corporations In what he refers to
tho passage at the last session of the
rate, meat inspeotm and food laws, and
say3 that all of these have already justi
fied their enactment, but recommends
the amendment of the meat inspection
law so as to put dates on the labels of
meat products, and also to place the
cost ot" inspection on the packers rather
than on the government. Continuing on
this subject of the control of corporations
by the federal government he says:
"It cannot too often be repeated that ex
perience has conclusively shown the im
possibility ot securing by the actions of
nearly half a hundred different state
legislatures anything but ineffective
cluC'S in the way of dealing with the
great corporations which do not operate
exclusively within the limits of any one
state. In some method, whether by a
national license law or in other fashion,
we must exercise, and that at an early
date, a far more complete control than
at present over these great corpora
tionsa control that will among other
things rrevent the evils of excessive
overcapitalization, and that w:il compel
the disclosures by each big corporation
ot its stockholders and of its properties
and business, whether owned directly or
thru subsidiary or affiliated corporations.
This will tend to put a stop to the secur
ing of Inordinate profits by favored
Individuals at the expense whether of
the general public, the stockholders, or
the wageworkers. Our effort should be
not so much to prevent consolidation as
such, but so to supervise and control it
as to see that It results in no harm to
the people. The reactionary or ultracon
eervatlve apologists for the misuse of
wealth assail the effort to secure such
control as a step toward socialism. As a
matter of fact It Is these reactionaries
and ultraconservatlves who are them
selves most yotent In increasing socialis
tic feeling. One of the most efficient
methods of averting the consequences of
a dangerous agitation, which is SO per
cent, wrong, is to remedy the 20 per cent,
of evil as to which the agitation is well
founded. The best way to avert the very
undesirable move for the governmental
ownership cf railways is to secure by i
the government on behalf of the people :
as a whole such adequate control and j
regulation of the great Interstate com- j
non carriers as will do away with the j
evils which give rise to the agitation j
against them. So the proper antidote ;
to the dangerous and wicked agitation j
against the men of wealth as such is to j
secure bv proper legislation and execu- ;
tive action the abolition of the grave i
abuses which actually do obtain In con- j
rection with the business use of wealth !
under our present system or rather no j
system of failure to exercise any ado- ;
quate control at ail. tome persons speaK
as If the exercise of such governmental
control would do awav with the freedom
of individual initiative and dwarf indi
vidual effort. This is not a fact. It
would be a veritable calamity to fail to
put a premium upon individual initiative,
individual capacity and effort; upon the
energy, character and foresight which
It is so important to encourage In the
Individual. But as a matter of fact the
deadening and degrading effect of pure
socialism, and especially of ita extreme
form communism, and the destruction of
individual character which they would
bring about, are In part achieved by the
wholly unregulated competition which
results In a single Individual or corpor
ation rising at the expense of all others
until hla or Its rise effectually checks all
CQHTpitlrJoa ret'4fiX-f QIITiejl CAeu,
tors to a position" Of utter Inferior Ityana
subordination.
"In enacting and enforcing such legis
lation as this congress already has to Us
credit, we are working on a coherent
plan, with the steady endeavor to secure
the needed reform by tho Joint action of
the moderate men, the plain men who
o not wish anything hysterical or
dangerous, but who do Intend to 6al
in resolute commonsense fashion with
the real and great evils of the present
system. The reactionaries and the vio
lent extremists show symptoms of Join
ing hands against us. Beth assert, for
instance, that if logical, we should go
to government ownership of rallroad3
and the like: the reactionaries, because
on such an issue they think the people
would stand with them, while the ex
tremists care rather to preach discontent
and agitation than to achieve solid re
sults. As a matter of fact, our position
is as remote from that of the bourbon
reactionary as from that of the imprac
ticable or sinister visionary. We hold
that the government should not conduct
the business of the Vatlon- but that 51
6hould exercise such uperv:6lon as wl'd
irsure its being conducted in the inter
est of the nation. Our aim is, so far as
irav be, to secure, for all decent, hard
working men, equality of opportunity and
equality of burden.
Combinations Are Necessary.
"The actual working of our laws has
shown that the effort to prohibit all com
bination, good or bad. Is noxious where
it is not ineffective. Combination of
capital like combination of labor is a
necessary element of our present Indus
trial system. It Is not possible completely
to prevent it; and if It were possible,
such complete prevention would do dam
age to ths body politic. What we need
is not vainly to prevent all combination,
but to secure such rigorous and adequate
control and supervision of the combina
tions as to prevent their injuring the
f)ublic, or existing in such form as inev
tably to threaten Injury for the mere
fact that a combination has secured
practically complete control of a neces
sary of life would under any circum
stances show that such combination was
to be presumed to be adverse to the pub
lic Interest. It is unfortunate that our
present laws should forbid all combina
tions. Instead of sharply discriminating
between those combinations which do
evil. Rebates, for instance, are as often
du to the pressure of big shippers (as
wps shown in the Investigation of the
Standard Oil company and as has been
shown since by the investigation of the
tobacco and sugar trusts) as to the initi
ative cf big railroads. Often railroads
would like to combine for the purpose of
preventing a big shipper from maintain
ing improper advantages at the expense
of small snippers and of the general pub
lic. Such a combination, instead of being
forbidden by law, should be favored. In
other words, It should be permitted to
railroads to make agreements, provided
these agreements were sanctioned by tho
interstate commerce commission and
were published. With these two condi
tions complied with it Is impossible to
see what harm such a combination could
do to the public at large. It is a public
evil to have on the statute books a law
incapable of full enforcement because
both judges end juries realize that Its
full enforcement would destroy the busi
ness of the country; for the result is to
make decent railroad men violators of
the law against their will, and to put a
premium on the behavior o? the wilful
wrongdoers. Such a result in turn tends
to throw the decent man and the wilful
wrongdoer into close association, and in
the end to dr;g down the former to the
latter's level: ivr tlx- man who becomes
a lawbreaker in one way unhappily tends
to lose all respect for law and to be
willing to break It in many ways. No
more scathing condemnation could be
visited upon a law th-n Is contained li
the words of the lnier?tate commerce
commission when. In commenting upon
the fact that the numerous Joint traffic
associations do technically violate the
law, they say: "The decision of the
United States supreme court in the
Transmississippi case and the Joint
Traflic association case has produced no
practical effect upon the railway opera
tions of the country. Such associations,
in fact, exist nov: as they did before
these decisions, and with the same gen
eral effect. In justice to all parties, we
ought probably to add that it Is difficult
to see how our interstate railways could
be operated with due regard to the Inter
est Of tire shipper and the railway
without concerted action of the kind af
forded thru there associations."
This means that the law as construed
by ttw supreme court is such that the
business of the country cannot be con
ducted without breaking it. I recommend
that you give careful and early consider
ation to this subject, and if you find the
opinion of th? interjtate commerce com
mission Justii.ed, that you amend the
law so as to ooviate the evil disclosed.
Inheritance and Income Tax.
It was expected that the president
would refer in some way to his belief
In the necessity' for the curbing of enor
mous fortunes, and he has done so by
recommending legislation for both in
come and an Inheritance tax. He be
lieves the government should impose a
graduated inheritance tax, and. if possi
ble, a graduated indome tax. He says:
"I am well aware that such a subject
as this needs long and careful study in
order that the people may become famil
iar with what is proposed to be done,
may clearly see the necessity of proceed
ing with wisdom and seif-restraint, and
may make up their minds just how far
they are willing to go in the master,
while only trailed legislators can work
out the projecj in necessary detail. But
I feel that in the near future our nation
al legislators should enact a law provid
ing for a graduated inheritance tax by
which a steadiiy increasing rate of duty
should be put upon all moneys or other
valuables coming by gift. Inquest, or
devise to any individual or corporation.
It may be well to make the tax heavy
in proportion as the individual benefited
ts remote of kin. In any event, in my
Judgment the pro rata of the tax should
increase very heavily with the Increase
of the amount left to any one Individual
after a certain point has been reached.
It is most desirable to encourage thrift
and ambition, and a potent source of
thrift and ambition is the desire on the
part gt the breadwinner to leave his chil
dren well off. This object can be attained
by making the tax very small on moder
ate amounts of property left; because
the prime object should be to put a con
stantly increasing burden on the inher
itance" of those swollen fortunes which
it Is certainly of no benefit to this coun
try to perpetuate.
There can be no question of the eth
ical propriety of the government thus de
termining the conditions upon which any
srift or inheritance should be received.
Exactly how far the Inheritance tax
would, as an Incident, have the effect of
limiting the transmission by devise or
gift of the enormous fortunes In question
It is not necessary at present to discuss.
It is wise that pgross in this direction
should be gradual. At first a permanent
national inheritance tax. while it might
be more substantial than any su?h tax
has hitherto been, need not approximate,
either In amount or In the extent of the
Increase by graduation, to what such a
tax should ultimately be.
Inheritance Tax Constitutional.
"This snecies of tax has again and again
been imposed, altho only temporarily, by
the national government. It was first
imposed bv the act of July 6. 1797, when
the makers of the Const; ution were
alive and at the head of affairs. It was
a graduated tax; tho small in amount,
the rate was increased with the amount
left to any Individual, exceptions being
made in the case of certain close kin. A
similar tax w;is again imposed by the
act of July 1. 1S2: a minimum sum of
$1,000 in personal property being excepted
from taxation, the tax then becoming
progressive according to the remoteness
of kin. The war-revenue act of June IS,
1SSS. provided for an inheritance tax on
any sum exceeding the value of J10.0C0,
the rate of tax increasing both in accord
ance with the amounts left and in ac
cordance with the legatee's remoteness
of kin. The supreme court has held that
the succession tax imposed at the time
of the civil war was not a direct tax bi
an impose of excise which was both con
stitutional and val'l. More recently the
court, in an opinion delivered by Mr.
Justice White, which contained an ex
ceedingly able and elaborate discussion
of the powers of the congress to impose
death duties, sustained the constitution
ality of the inheritance tax feature o-f th
war-revenue act of 1SSS.
Is Income Tax Constitutional?
"In Its incidents, and apart from the
main purpose of raising revenue, an
income tax stands on an entirely difter-
cause If IiTvdTves nd question of tli per
petuation of fortunes swollen to an un
healthy size. The question Is in Its
essence a question of the proper adjust
ment of burdens to benefits. As the
law now stands it is undoubtedly diffi
cult to devise a rational Income tax
which shall be constitutional. But
whether It is absolutely Impossible Is an
other question; and if possible It Is most
certainly desirable. The first purely in
come tax law was pfxst by the congress
in 1S61. but the most Important law deal
ing with the subject was that of 1S&4.
This the court held to be unconstitu
tional. "The question Is undoubtedly very In
tricate, delicate, and troublesome. The
decision of th court was only reached
by one majority. It is the law of the
land, and, of course, Is excepted as such
and loyally obeyed by all good citizens
Nevertheless, the hesitation evidently
felt by the court as a whole in coming
to a conclusion, when considered to
gether with the previous decisions on
the subject, may perhaps indicate the
possibility of devising a constitutional
income-tax law which shall substan
tially aeceomplish the results aimed
at. The difficulty of amending the con
stitution is so great that only real ne
cessity can Justify a resort thereto.
Every effort should be made in dealing
with this subject, as with the subject
of the proper control by the national
government over the xise of corporate
wealth In interstate business, to devise
legislation which without such action
shall attain the desired end; but if this
falls, there will ultimately be no al
ternative to a constitutional amend
ment." He makes a strong plea for technical
and industrial education for the masses,
and while the federal government can do
but little in this line, he asks that
schools o,f this character be established
In the District of Columbia as an ex
ample to the various states.
Agricultural Interests.
He appeals for every encouragement
that the congress can give to the agri
cultural interests of the country. He
points to the good that Is being done by
the various forms of gi-ange organlza- I
tlons. and says:
"Several factors must cooperate in the
Improvement of the farmer's condition.
He must have the chance to be educated
In the widest possible sense in the sense
Tiich keeps ever in view tha intimal
relationship between the theory of edu
cation and the facts of life. In all
education we should widen our aims. It
id a good thing to produce a certain num
ber of trained scholars and students;
but the education superintended by the
state must seek rather to produce a hun
dred good citizens than merely one
scholar, and It must be turned now and
then from the class book to the study
of the great bofik of nature Itself. This
is especially true of the farmer, as has
been pointed out again and again ty all
Observers most competent to pass prac
tical Judgment on the problems of our
country life. All students now realize
that education must seek to train the
executive, powers of young people and to
confer more real significance upon the
phrase "dignity of labor," and to pre
pare the pupils si. that in addition to
each developing In the highest degree
his individual capacity for work, they
may together help create a right public
opinion, and show In many ways social
and cooperative spirit. Organization has
become necessary In the business veorld;
and It has accomplished much for good
In the world of labor. It is no less neces
sary for farmers. Such a movement as
the grange mijveme'nt Is good In Itself
and Is capable of a well-nigh infinite fur
ther extension for good so long as It Is
kept to its own legitimate busings. The
benefits to be derived by the association
of farmers for mutual advantage are
partly economic and partly sociological.
"Moreover, while in the long run volun
tary effort will prove more efficacious
than government assistance, while the
farmers must primarily do most for
themselves, yet the government can also
do much. The department of agriculture
has broken new ground In many direc
tions, and year by year it finds how It
can Improve lfs methods and develop
fresh usefulness. Its constant effort is
to give the governmental assistance in
the most effective way; that Is. thru as
sociations of fhrmers ratb?r than to or
thru Individual farmers. It is also striv
ing to coordlrvite its work with the agri
cultural departments of the several
states, and so far as its own work is
educational, to coordinate it with the
work of other educational authorities.
Agricultural education is necessarily
based upon general education, but our
agricultural educational institutlont are
wisely specializing themselves, making
their course relate to the actual teaching
of the agricultural and kindred sciences
to young country people or young city
people who wish to live in the country.
"Great progress has already been made
among farmers by the creation of
farmers' Institutes, of dairy associa
tions, of breeders' associations, horti
cultural associations, and the like. A
striking example of now tho govern
ment and the farmers can cooperate is

offered to the cotton growers of the
southern states by the advance of the
lioll weevil. The department is doing
all It can to organize the farmers in
the threatened districts. Just as It has
been doing all It can to organize them
in aid ot its work to eradicate the cat
tie fever tick In the south. The deoart

such associations, and It must have
their help If its own work is to be
done in the most efficient Ptvle."
He urges the extension of the irriga
tion and forest preservation system, and
asks for an appropriation for building a
memorial tneater at Arlington.
Marriage and Divorce.
As a means of bringing about national
regulation of marriage and divorce he
suggests a constitutional amendment, and
says it is not safe to leave these Ques
tions to be dealt with by the various
state. Continuing on this subject he
says:
When home ties are loosened; when
men and women cease to regard
worthy family life, with all its duties
fully performed, and all its responsi
bilities lived up to, as the life best
worth living; then evil days for the
commonwealth are at hand. There are
reg-lons in our land, and classes of our
population, where the birth rate has
sunk below the death rate. Surelv it
should need no demonstration to show
that wilful sterility is. from the
standpoint of the nation. from me
standpoint of the human race, the one
sin for which the penalty is national
death, rac death; a sin for which
there is no atonement; a sin which is
the more dreadful exactly in propor
tlon as the men and women guilty
tnereor are in other respects, in char
acter, and bodily and mental powers
those whom for the sake of the state
t would be well to see the fathers
and mothers of many healthy children
well brought up In homes made happy
oy tneir presence. No man. no woman
can shirk the primary duties of life,
whether for love of ease and pleasure
or fcr any other cause, and retain his
or her self-respect.
The president asks for the enactment
Into law of a shipping bill that will place
American Interests on the seas on a pa
with those of other countries, and tiroes
especially that something be done that
will establish direct steamship commu
nication with South American ports.
Currency Reform.
Amendments to the present eurrenev
laws ae asked for;- and after showing
that present laws are inadequate because
of the wide fluctuation of Interest
charges, he says:
"The mere statement of these facts
shows that o'.jr present system is serious!-
defective. There is need of a
chang-e. Unfortunately, however, many
of the proposed chinges must be ruled
from consideration because thev are
complicated, are nt easy of compre
hension, and tend to dturb exist!n
rights and Interests. We must also

do not press any special plan. Variouj
plans have recently been proposed by
expert committees of bankers. Among
the plans which are possiblv feasible
and which certainly should receive

Need cf Automatic System.
"I do not say that this Is the right
eystem. I only advance it to empha
e!ze my belief that there Is need for
the adoption of some system which
shall be automatic and open to all
sound banks, so as to avoid all pos
sibility of discrimination and favorit
ism. Such a plan would tend to pre
vent the epusms of high money and
speculation which now obtain in the
New York market: for at present
there is too much currency at certain
seasons of the year, and Its accumu
lation at Now York tempts bankers
to lend it at low rates for speculative
purposes: whereas at other times when
the crops are bins moved there is
urgent need for a large but temporary
lncret.-e in me currency supply. ix
must never be forgotten that this
question concerns business men gen
erally quite as much as bankers; es- j
peclally 1 this true of stockmen
farmers and business mn In the west:
for ot present at certain seasons of
the year the difference in interest
rates between the east and the west Is
from six to ten per cent., whereas in
Canada the corresponding difference is
but two per cent. Any "plan must, of'
course, c-uarn the Interests of west
ern and southern bankers as carefully
as it guards the Interests of New York
or Chlefliro bankers; ard must be
drawn from the standpoints of the
farmer and the merchant no less than
from the standpoints of tho city
banker and tho country banker.
The law should be amended so as to
specifically to provide that the funds de
rived from customs duties may be treat
ed by the secretary of the treasury as
he treats funds obtained under the in
ternal rev.uo laws. There should be
a considerable increase in bills of 6mall
denominations. Permission should be
given banks. If necessary under settled
restrictions, to retire their circulation to
a larger amount than $3,000X00 a month."
He again asks for free trade with this

r'aturaiization of Japs.
President Roosevelt scores San Fran
cisco and other Pacific coast cities for
their treatment of the Japanese, and
makes the following recommendations:
Our nation fronts on the Pacific, Just
as It fronts on the Atlantic. We hope
to play a constantly grot.'lng part in
the great ocean of the orient. We
wish, as we ought to wish, for a great
commercial development in our deal
ings with Asia; and it Is out of the
question that we should permanently
have such development unless we free
ly and gladly extend to other nations
the same measure of justice and good
treatment which we expect to receive
in return. It is only a very small body
of our citizens that act badly. Where
the federal government has power It
will deal summarily with any such.
Where tho several states have power
I earnestly ask that they also deal
wisely and promptly with such con
duct, or else this small body of wrong
doers may bring shame upon the great
mass of their Innocent and right
thinking fellows that Is. upon our
nation as a whorl;. Good manners
should be an International no loss than
an individual attribute. I ask fair
treatment for the Japanese as I would
ask fair treatment fcr Germans or
Englishmen, Frenchmen. Russians 01
Italians. I ask it as due to humanity
and civilization. I ask It as due to
ourselves because we must act up
rightly toward all men.
"I recommend to the congress that
an act be passed specifically provding for
the naturalization of Japanese who coma
here intending to become American cit
izens. One of the great embarrassments
attending th4 performance of our in
ternational obligations la the fact that
the statutes of the Untyd States gov
ernment are entirely inadequate. They
fail to give to the national government
sufficiently ample power, through United
States courts and by the ue of the
army and iavy, to protect aliens In the
rights secured to them under solemn
treaties which are the law of the land.
I therefore earnestly recommend that
the criminal and civil stPtutes of the
United States be so amended and added
to as to enable the president, acting for
the United States government, which is
responsible in our international rela
tions, to enforce the rights of aliens un
der treaties. Even as the law now is
something can be done by the federal
government toward this end, and in the
matter now before mo affecting the Jap
anese, everything that It is in my power
to do will be done, and all of the forces,
military and civil, of the United States
which I may lawfully employ will be
so employed. There should, however, be
no particle of doubt as to the power of
tho national government completely to
perform and enforce Its own obligations
to other nations. The mrb of a single
city may at any tlmo perform acts of
lawless violence against some class of
foreigners which would plunge us Into
war. The city by itself would be power
less to make defense against the for
eign pfwer thus assaulted, and if inde
pendent of this government it would
never venture to perform or permit the
performance of the acts complained of.
The entire power and the whole duty to
protect the offending city or the offend
ing community lies in the hands of the
United States government. It is un
thinkable that we should continue a pol
icy under which a given locality may be
allowed to commit a crime against a
friendly nation, and the United States
government limited, not to preventing
the commission of the crime, but, in the
last resort, to defending the people who
have committed it against the conse
quences of their own wrongdoing."
Cuban Intervention.
The rebellion In Cuba and tho Inci
dents leading up to the establishment of
the provisional government is reviewed,
and the president says:
"When the election has been held and
the new government inaugurated in j
peaceful and orderly fashion of the provl- !
sional government will come to an end. j
I take this opportunity- of expressing
upon behalf of the American people, i
with all possible solemnity, our most ;
earnest hope that the people of Cuba j
will realize the imperative need of pre- :
serving Justice and keeping order in the j
island. The United States wishes noth- j
Ing of Cuba except that it shall prosper
morally and materially, and wishes noth- i
lng of the Cubans save that they snail i
be able to preserve order among them- j
selves and therefore to preserve their
Independence. If the elections become a i
farce, and if the Insurrectionary habit I
becomes confirmed in the island, it is ab- j
solutely out of the question that the i
Island should continue independent; and 1
the United States, which has assumed
the cporsorship before the civilized world j
for Cuba's career as a nation, would i
again have to intervene and to see that
the government was managed in such
orderly fashion as to secure the safety
of life and property- The path to be
trodden by those who exercise se'f-gov-ernment
La always hard, and we should
have eviry charity and patience with the
Cubans is they tread this difficult parth.
I have the utmcit sympathy with, and
regard for, them; but I most earnestly
adjure them solemnly to weigh their re
sponsibilities ar.d to see that when their
new government is started It shall run
smoothly, and with freedom from fla
grant denial of right on the one hand,
and from Insurrectionary disturbances on
the other."
Considerable space Is devoted to the
international conference of American re
publics ar.d the visit of Secretary Root
to South America, and points to the fact
that our efforts in behalf of the nations
of that country are appreciated by them.
