this Government and Japan over the alleged
leged discrimination against Japanese jnCalifornia
California has been reached between thePresident

a new treaty will he negotiated betweenthe
the two Governments which will providethat
that laborers from either country shall notbo

Japan it is declared will recede from itssupposed

There was little else discussed amongSenators

the statements contained in the Presidentsannual

Japanese subjects a square dealIt
It is regarded as worthy of note nt thistime
time by the Administration that Japan hasnever
never made any protest to the UnitedStates
States Government in regard to the treatment
ment o Japanese subject in CaliforniaThe
The fact is that Mr Root the Secretary ofState
State took time by the forelock and on thofirst
first knowledge that there was agitationin
in Japan over the discrimination practisedby
by the San Francisco school authoritiessent
sent instructions to ArnUissador Wrightat
at Tokio to assure the Japanese Government

would do everything in its power to carryout
out its obligations to Japan SubsequentlyViscount
