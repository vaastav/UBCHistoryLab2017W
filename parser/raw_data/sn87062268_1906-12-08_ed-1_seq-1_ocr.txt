Wilson interstate commerce bill re
lating to convict made goods has
tho enthusiastic endorsement of

Vnder the Wilson bill adopted in

active competition with goods made
by free labor and Under the Wilson
law the individual states were unable
to pass a law preventing the ship
Knt into such states of prisonmade
foods from other states The law
adopted today abrogates the inter
state commerce law as now applied
o convictmade goods thereby afford
ing the states a right to inhibit the
Jpplng of convlctrunde goods from

RECOMMENDATIONS
OF THE PRESIDENT
Upon the Japanese Problem in California Considered By
Japanese Residents the Most Rational Solution
of the Difficutly
By Associated Press
San Fancisco Dec 7In an Inter
view published in the Call today
bearing on the recommendations
made in his message by President
Roosevelt on Japanese naturalization
and on the segregation of their chil
dren in schools General K Upeno i
the consul for Japan here says
Sentiment is practically universal I
among the ten thousand Japanese in
San Francisco that the recommenda
tions made by the President consti
tute the most rational solution of
AmericanJapanese problems yet at
tempted The Japanese are not only
pleased with the message but they
regard it as one of the most note
worthy documents on International
questions that has been issued from j
the White House
There is no question but that the I
bonds between Japan and the United
States would be considerably I
strengthened by conferring the privij
lego of franchise on the Japanese in
California There are some fifty odd
thousand Japanese in the state and
while not in a position to say these
would take advantage of naturaliza
tion privileges I do think that the
number would be comparatively large
I think this would be especially so in
the case of the Japanese in San Fran
cisco
Many Japanese have family and
property interests here and they
would naturally regard San Francisco
as their permanent home once they
beliired they had the same privilege
as other aliens
Concerning the school segregation
question a lot is being written and
talked about it that is due to miscon
ception of facts In the case I think
that the entire matter will be solved
I
I satisfactorily and that there Is no
I occasion for believing otherwise The
Japanese are not striving for anything
I unreasonable and are quite willing to
I let the facts in the dispute guide
whatever decision is to be ultimately
rendered
