Our llaint.
We barm', exactly been, to war, but
we Bit a'nost. We bave done that
whioh, less patriotic and perilous, tquir
d many of the implements of war, aUcb
aa guns, powder, ball, tenia, and camp
kettles, and waa aecompabied with some
of the iaoideots of military life, such as
camping out, sleeping in the mad, cfco.
Tbe patty, composed entirely of "green
ets," not a man of whom' could shoot a
a barn door at sixty yarda with a rest, and
eotna of whcln bad to enquire in order to

broken down a locomotive, '
; The first day was spent in large talk
about game, auch as bear and buffalo.?
Tbe only queetiou was aa to its shipment;
considerable doubt waa expressed as to
whether or not there was sufficient roll
ing slook on the railroads in North-western
Ohio to transport our game aa fast
as it Was' slaughtered. Night came on
and we camped. The , dreams o( the
party; coneideriog the bard bed, were not
only enoourageing, but refreshing. Your
humble servaot saw in bis visions droves
of deer, herds of buffalo, and swamps full
ol bear, slaughtered and smoking, ready
for shipment. ' Similar visions blessed
whole party, and daylight found us on
our way hopeful and rejoicing.
The second day was without incidents
save one. A fine eovey of Quail crossed
the road just in front of us; it was agretd
to net thm. ''Nick" and "Gabriel" set
the-net. Your bumble servant seeing
the birds about to re-oross the road,
jnarobed boldly out in front of them and
fully understanding the Datura and hab
ile of tbe bird, shook bis coat tail at them
jmt as be would at a brood of chiokens,
whereupon the exceedingly stupid and
ill-trained covey "flushed." 'Nick"
wore (at the birds of course) pulled
up slakea and we proceeded on our jour
ney, but riot however, until "Gabriel"
bad ahown bimeelf an excellent "wing
eliot" br shooting a corn shock ten teet
to the south of the moel'eoutbeily bird,
and we had ahown ourself an experienced
eportsman by ' letting our gun fall from
our bands without getting a snot, as tue
oovey flew up a second time in our very
face;'. '
The third day it rained hard and blow,
cd cold; "it was delightful to see tie big
trma roma danoinrf to tbe Cttrtll," but
variably "wait for ths wagoo," but the;
win "Jeff" would alwaye pat as off by
the invariably coriect opioion, that tbe
roads wOald get tW io a few rods, and
that it was useless to stop tbe team to
ride that distance," so ws continued to
wslk.
- We reached oar destination on Sunday
evening, after fire days of most delightful
travel. We pitched oar teat on tbe big
branob of Dog Creek, with mud and wa
ter below end woods above and around
endlese and boundless woods. "Jeff"
and "Tom" hauled together a mountain
of logs; "Gabriel" dressed and cooked a
tame duck and chiokerel, (tbe only game
we bad seen, since the chicken bawks
mentioned) while we cut brush for abed.
That night brush and leaves were the
only thing between us and the mud and
water, both of which soon found their
way through limb acd leaf and morning
found us with our heads in the mud.
We now prepared for the bunt. We
had beard glowing de scriptions of game,
"the woods were full," everybody taid;
"haulers are averaging from two to four
deer per day." We went into the woods
not the least shaken in our fuith. The
mountains of smoking deer and bear were
not tbe lent diminished in our visions.
At J 2 we returned from our tramp hav
ing seen plenty of ''deer sign" but with-
"Jeff" tbe fatal
"Jeff," not getting a dosen buck in tbe
three hours ramble through tho woods,
became disoouraged, mistaking the bark
of a ohickerel fur a wolf, became ecared,
told by somebody that there were more
turkey in the aetllements than in the
woods, determined to return to the settle
inenis, jand return Le did tbe whole
green and cowardly party submitting to
him and following his example.' We
bunted in tbe settlements one day, found
no turkey; but your humble servant, more
lecky iban the rent, found a solitary wood
chuck and on the third fire brought him
triumphantly to th ground.
itiie ended our hunting. We came
home about as we went, wiih this differ
enoe, we went out with some monoj and
came back Jiat broke. We left clean and
came back so dirty that our best friends
did not recognize us. Our own babe
stared at ns snd oried I
Our friende may be a little incredulous
of this story but it is true true as gos
pel. Aa we hare to anawer in the future
the only game tshot by the party in the
woods, was one wood-chuck and enc
pheasant.
jCyThe report handed us for publica
tion by Mrs, Bkdbh, of the donations for
Soldiers, has been unavoidably crowded
out of thia weeks issue, bat will appear
in our next.
Appointsiknt. Our friend Dr. Uomsr
C. Shaw, hat been appointed - Assistant
Surgeon of the 10th Ohio Regiment.
This is an excellent appoinment. - Tbe

we went, splashing, dashing, shivering

Libaiov, Kr., Nov. 27, 1861. j
Diab Loo: We started thia morning on
our march again uudur (be most glowing
oircumeunoes, as U began last cigbt
bout 9 o'clock to anow and continued to
snow fur about one ball aa hour, and tbeo
It turned to lain, and I assure you it did
rain; I bed gone to Danville io tbe even
ing to get a Camp stove and hud to wait
until 9 o clock, Tor tbe man to finish it:
and by the time we got to Camp it waa
thundering, lightening and raining. Tbe
Creek thia morning had risen eo high we
had to chop a large tree acroea it for tbe
boys to walk over on. Jt continued to
rain until about II o'clock, and it then
broke away and this afternoon wae a de
lightful one over head, and not eo very
unpleasant underneath as we are marching
on a good pike. It appears as though we
have tbfa luck to march in the worst of
weather, as the. majority of our marches
have been made in the rain and mud, yet
the boys moved off cheerfully with the
understanding that we are going on to
join a column; embracing several Brig
ades under command ol General Thomas.
I m inclined to think if General Thomas
ahould meet tbe enemy, he will ahow
himself to he a General although many
of the papers censure him lor tbe Cum
berland (Jap Expedition. 1 don t think
he ever had men enough to have made an
attaok on the Gap, and for that reason I
inter be did not press the column ae cloae
ae many thought it ought to have been
done, but wben it is known 1 hat be only
had about 3,600 efficient men marching
against an army ot 8,000; bis movements
had necessarily to be very cautious and I
had muoli rather see a General err on the
side oi caution than rashness. I have
never blamed General Thomas fur the
failure to oapture tbe entire army of Zul
liooffer; but it is ths Kentuukiang that
are to blame for tie whole of it. Col.
Garrard's regiment baa been in camp for
weeks, at Wild Cat, and yet wbeo we got
there they knew nothing at all about the
oountry except ou the roads, ak them
what kind is over that knob, oi that hill
or valley, and their invariable reply wo'd
be "I have never been tliar;" and it ap
peared as though we oould gut no one io
give us any information jr guides that
knew ecarooly anything about the coun
try and the Kentucky Cavalry ie not as
good aa common make shift, u6iog the
old woman phrase. Our btfvs know more
about the oountry within 300 yards of
where ihe fight took place in two hours
after we got there than the Kentuck ans
knew or ever will know about it. They
appeared to think the only thing neoessa
ry io know about the ground was imme
diately in front of their works, and that
only so far as they oould see without leu
ving their woiks. They ihought only of
repelling an attack and never apparently
dreamed of following the enemy and cut
ting him to pieces on his retreat. They
should have explored the country all a-
round and known every foot of it, and
then when we ascertained that Zollscoffer
waa retreating we could bavo march-d
through the woods and ruobuahed bim
and made the victory deoisive.
I see some one wrote homo that Co. A,
Capt'. Butteifield, has maiohed 50 miles
further than any other .comp my in the
regiment. This is not the fact, as Capt.
Rickets' company, as also my own have
bi.'on on every march that Co A has, and
I assure you we never start on a march
but we do as niuoh as any other company;
the fict ie Co. B marched from London
to Rockcastle River and back, 14 miles
each way, faster than Capt, Butterfield's
or any other company in the Regiment,
excepting a part of Capt. Wbisaon's boys
wliO a' oompanied n; I only stato this so
that our friends may have the facte.
Ever eince we came within about font
milrs of Mount Vernon we have been
in a most delightful country, the soil ie
very rich, undulating and well watered,
as theie are many email streams with
quite a numher'as largo us Hocking at Lo
gan, ine whole country in tins region
We bare a fine cooking stove now in
oar qaarters, tbe .stove-part made of
sheet iron. We have coffee pot, roasting
pans, cake baker, &o aud yoo ought to
nave see a Lleat. Asbbroolr and I cooking
freah sausage for sapper. I don't believe
yoa eod Mre. Aebbroqk could have beat
tbe cooking.
There are several of my boys aick.ptin

General Sherman's Proclamation to tbe
People of South Carolina.
Ater landing and taking possession of
the forts, General Sh-rmao issued the
following proclamation:
To tbi People or Sooth Caroliha: In
obedieare to the ordere of the President
of the United Steles of America, I bsve
landed on your shores wiib a small force
of National troops. Ths diotates ol a du
ty which, under these circumstances, I
owe to a sovereign State, and to a proud
and hospitable people, among whom I
have passed some of the moot pleasant
days ol my lite, prompt me to proclaim
that wo have come among you with no
feeling of personal animosity; no desiro to
harm your citizens, destroy your proper
ty, or Interfere with any of your lawful
lights, or your social acd local iostitu
lions, beyond what the causes herein
briefly alluded to may render unavoida
ble. .
Citizens of South Carolina, the civilized
world stands appalled at the ouurse you
are pursuing; appalled at the crime you
are committing againxt your own mother,
the beet, the most enlightened and, here
tofore, the most prosperous of nations.
You are in a state of active rebellion a-
gainst the laws of your country. You
have lawlessly seized upon the forts, ar
senals, and other property belonging lo
our common country and within )our bor

The wheel fixed, we were off, not like

the flat oountry we were new traveling

mistake. ."Jeff," the driver thought a

A Two Fold Prophecy.
Mr. Seward, the other night, ucknowl.
edged tbe compliment of a aerenade by
making a speeoh and an agreeable (if true)
prophecy. The ratter was to the effeot
that the publio would bear of something
great within ten days. We do not sup
pose thst ths following Richmond dispatch
whioh appeared in the Southern papers of
the 25lb. bas any othsr than an accident
al eoinoidence with the Secretary a pre
diction, but the resemblance il certainly
very eingnlar:
A aimultaneoua attaok will be mads on
the Confederates io ten days. Model
Ian will probably advanoe in a week, tbe
weather permitting. The 1 roade are iu a
bad oonditlon, bat is reported that Mo
Clellan is already this side of Anandale,
and to day, at several limes I counted 6
to 14 ot the same kiud of hills. But they
must be seen to be appreciated, yet it
looks strange to see a little stream that
oan be stepped over by a fcotman divi
ding two oounties bo vastly diuerent in
appearance. Ibe one .rising not lo ex
ceed ten or fifteen feet sod then extending
back for miles oil a level except that is
rolling enough to make it beautiful farm
ing land; whilst the other rises into hills
or ridges from 60 to 300 leet high, all a-
lonz the road, and all ending within a tew
rods of the road. 1 presume they are tue
commencement of a ridge of mountains
extending east and west through Southern
Kentucky.
Mt. Vernou. unlike Mt. Vernon, Ohio,
is a very poor looking, shxbby town, and
quite a sprinkling of seoebh in it but they
bad all left several weeka before we got
lo it, and for ua it demonstrated the old
saying that it is an "ill wind thst blows
no one any good," ae we got there when
on our march from London, late, tired,
hungry, worn out, wet and oo!d, and we
immediately camped in their vacated bou
ses; so ths absence of seceeh was our
oomfort. Crab Orohard is a much better
town and the Union sentiment muoh
stronger; but Danville is the best town by
odds I have seen in Kentuoky. It has a
population of about 2,300. Has aome
splendid buildings in it, among whioh ie
a College and Deaf and Dumb Asylum.
It has a little of the appearanoe of yan
kee town, in thia it has some enterprise
and publiu spirit, a few years ainos a
railroad waa graded to Danville from
Nioholaaville, bnt some sharper ran away
with 8100,000 of the money and the Ma
nsville Company failed to repay 990.000
worth of iron when the Danville Company
