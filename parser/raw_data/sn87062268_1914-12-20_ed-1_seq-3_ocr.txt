1ALAGA SQUARE
BEAUTIFUL EAST HILL BLOCK
MAY SHORTLY BE CONVERTED
INTO ONE OF THE PRETTIEST
OF THE MANY CITY PARKS.
borhood have been griven to understand
that many improvements are planned,
out whether these will be put in right
away remains to be seen. Lights of
the ornamental t5"pe are to be installed,
it was asserted, at least at each of
the four corners, and one big light,
the citizens hope, will be placed in the
centre. The queenly oaks which fur
nish the delightful shade in the hot
weather, also contribute to make the
park very dark at night. The centre
light, it is believed, will be the one in
stalled first, and the citizens are hop
ing that it will not be neglected any
longer than can be avoided.
This square has been the gathering
place for many delightful meetings in
the past, it being an unsurpassed play
ground in the summer time for chil
dren, and some big things are being
planned in short order.
Mslapa square, on the aouth. side of
Hast Hill oar line between Tenth
aoi Eleventh avenues. Fouth of Thir
fenth street will shortly be converted
nto one of the prettiest of the city's
many parks in the New City section,
ad while all the plans have not yet
made public, it is known that,
from the work which has already
''n done, many improvements are
fanned. Yesterday a double-plow
v"s kept soing in the square, and a
"ree r.r men from the city street gang
kept at work throughout the
a ay.
By dark the entire square had been
''owed, and most of it had been raked

CATHOLIC CHURCHES WILL
LISTEN TO AN A PPEAL FOR
THE ORPHANS OF THE DIOCESE
FOR THE CHRISTMAS COLLfcC-TION.
In all the Catholic churches of the
aiocese, the following letter irom
Bishop Edw. P. Allen will be read to
day:
The Bishop's Letter.
Mobile, Ala., Dec. 19th. 1914.
Dear Reverend Father: The annual
collection for the Orphans of the dio
cese will oe taken up at Christmas.
This collection appeals very strong-
y to every charitable heart, for our
Asylums give a happy home and pro-
ide a Christmas education for a large
number of helpless little ones who
might otherwise be left without a
home or proper training.
During the present year the Boys'
Industrial school. Mobile, sheltered and
provided for 178 boys and there are
now 121 in the Asylum. The Asylum
on Conti street took care of 125 girls,
85 of whom are still in the Asylum.
The Maternity and Infant Home, Mo
bile, received 107 infants and small
children, 41 of whom are still in the
Home. The Bast Lake Asylum shelt
ered 160 children, 115 of whom are still
in the Asylum. There is a debt of $8,
000 for improvements on the Girls'
Asylum and $650.00 on the Boys" and a
deficit in the current expenses of the
year amounting to nearly $1,000. We
arc grateful for a legacy of $250.00
from the estate of the late Felix Mc
Cann and $100.00 from the late Jacob
Pollock.
Although times are hard, we feel
that our faithful people will nut neg
lect the orphans this year. Alms
giving to the poor is a duty that de
volves on every Cchristian. Those who
have much should give generously
from their abundance. Those who
have but little should give cheerfully
a portion of that which they have, for
the "Lord loveth the cheerful giver"
II Cor.IX.7. Remember that in con
tributing to the support of the orphans
you are "lending to the Lord" who will
Himself be your reward exceedingly
great.
This letter is to be read on the Sun
day before the collection and on the
dayitself. Praying God to bless you
and your flock and grant you an abun
dance of His graces during the Holy
Christmas season, I am,
Faithfully yours in Christ.

Bishop of Mobile.
