REVIVED SAVAGERY.
The revolting story of the death by
torture and burning inflicted on a negro
at Maysvllie, Ky., which the press dis
patches relate, cannot be said to be
without its parallel in the history of the
ttions of the two races in the South.
Nor. unhappily, can it be said that the
awful crime In atonement of which the
Incredible punishment was inflicted can
not find more than one parallel on the
part of the negroes of the South.
The Globe, on the occasion of the
•* murder of Mrs. Lashbrook, felt called
upon in these columns to direct Its read
ers' attention to the savage incitement
which id so frequently offered to the
Southern people for wreaking vengeance
on negro offenders in such demoniac
form.
It is impossible to advance anything
which will .suffice to mitigate the awful
crime against humanity and civilization
which the death of this negro represents.
Yet it is true that no account yet fur
nished of the awful event of yesterday
ins succeeded in bringing out in any
thing like its true brutality the crime
committed by the slaughtered negro. As
in the case of another negro who "in
Georgia some months ago met a death
Bimilar to that inflicted on Coleman, it
will evidently need the services of one
or more capable investigators on the
ground to apprise the American public
of the facts, and all the facts, of the
>cious offense which has been followed
by such fearful vengeance. Perhaps It is
best that the full details of that crime
should not be made generally known.
Nothing short of the need of offering
something In pallation of the scenes enac
ted yesterday at Maysville, and in defense
of the character of the Southern people
as a civilized and enlightened race, could
justify the spreading before the American
public or the details of the offense which
this negro so grievously suffered for.
A social problem which presents such
abhorrent features to the world as that
revealed in the crime and the death
of Uii.^ nogro is a fearful one to con
template. Its solution is by such events
made Impossible In any other way than
by the disappearance of either the one
race or the other. It reveals a* rela
tionship existing between the two race 3
which, in point of savagery, finds a fit
ting counterpart in the former relation
ship of master and slave. Nothing in
all the annals of the slave-holding pe
riod, however, would furnish such an ex
hibition of sheer deviltry on the part of
the representatives of either race as is
presented here both by the Maysville
mob and their victim.
The one crime Is the complement of
the other. The murdered negro had
shown himself to be an unredeemed sav
age. He had violated, on his part, every
sentiment and principle of conduct that
distinguish man from the brute beast,
it is indeed a reflection even on the
most degraded and savage of the brute
creation to charge against them the pos
sibility of the commission of the crimes
which lay at the dead negro's door. But
horrible as his crimes were, and great
as may be ;he need of the protection of
the women of the South from the possi
bility of such outbreaks among a race
which maintains many of the traces of
its prisi.ine savagery, the effect of yes
terday's holocaust is none the less a
hideous stain on the honor of the South
ern people. They should hasten to bring
to Justice every man who participated
in the shocking affair. Unless the law
is vindicated in this case, the people of
Kentucky will do well to dispense with
even the semblance of respect for the
usages of civilized society.
The United States Imported all its dolls
until within iecent years, but now there
are three large doll factories in the East
turning out several hundred thousand
dc/ILs annually. This must be another of
those "infant industries" begotten of the
high tariff. Soon there will be a doll
trust.
LET THE COUNCIL ACT.
The action of the commercial club in
withdrawing from tha effort to meet the
cost of maintaining the public schools
during the entire school term through tha
aid of popular subscriptions is entirely
commendable. The success of the under
taking was in every event doubtful.
Nothing short of its regard for the splen
did spirit of local patriotism from which
the proposal of the Commercial club arose
prevented the St. Paul Globe from en
gaging itself in unqualified opposition to
the undertaking. It has seemed to us,
and it still so appears, that it would
be a far less evil to deride upon closing
the schools when the present available
funds are exhausted than to call on the
taxpayers to meet the cost through direct
contribution. The feature of the move
ment which seemed most objectionable
of all others was embodied In the idea
that the school teachers, as such, should
take part in the undertaking to secure
contributions fiom the parents of the
children who are in their charge.
Unless the necessary funds can be
raised through public or quasi-publio
agencies, It is best that the schools should
close in April. On the face of the situ
ation it ought not to be impossible to
raise the necessary amount. There are
various ways in which the council ought
to be able to bridge the difficulty. In less
Important emergencies than this it has in
the past been found practicable to raise
moneys for a present pressing need. Let
the council take up the subject in con
junction with the city comptroller's offieo
and find out whether there are not city
funds sufficient for the purpose which
they can make available to meet the ccst
of keeping th> schools open. If there is
an earnest disposition on the part of our
city officials to keep the schools open the
way can without doubt be found for doing
so.
When we have by charter provision
overcome the constitutional difficulty
which lies in the path of the additional
school levy, we can readily make pro
vision to meet the deficit which will bs
created should the schools be kept op; n.
There surely ought to be a way avail
able in which to raise the necessary
funds In the interval between now and
next March. That length of time exists
in which to devise some public method
by which the moneys may be realized.
It will be a serious reflection on the cdtti
munity should the schools be closed. It
will also be a serious hardship to our
public school teachers, who represent an
important element of local society. But
above and beyond all tKirigl.Tt'frill be a
sore Injustice to the growling* youth of the
city who are in attendance as pupils at
our schools. S
The council should take this matter
under consideration at once snd if pes
sible save the city the discredit of having
to close down our public schools The ad
vertisement which will result to St. Paul
on account of the closing of its schools
will cost us in round numbers very many
times the sum of $'JO,OOO.
STRIKING A POPVLAR CHORD.
It is now over twelve years since St.
Paul inaugurated the system of winter
carnivals which succeeded in directing
the attention of the entire country to
ward us during the winter months. Ex
perience has since taught us that at
least the Ice palace feature of these mem
orable popular festivals was .rendered
impracticable through the uncertainty of
sufficient continued cold weather to se
cure the necessary material for such
structures. But the rare success achiev
ed in every direction by these memor
able celebrations will live forever in the
memory of every man, woman and child
who had the good fortune to reside In St.
Paul during their progress.
Many winters have since passed when
St Paul has been utterly without any
fcrm of public enjoyment during the win
ter months save such as have been the
product of private enterprise and have
been of the nature of private undertak
ings. The city has not gained any by
the absence of such events. It has lost
decidedly, if the truth were known, in
the attachment of its citizens and In the
absence of such facilities for public en
joyment during the cold season as must
appear an especially inviting feature of
local experience to those who might con
template making their homes among us.
It is a positive pleasure to observe the
efforts which are now being put forward
by the Commercial club to restore to
seme limited degree at least the gala ex
periences of 38&6, 1887 and ISBB. What has
been sought by the establishment of pub
lic swimming baths In the summer, and
more, for the health and enjoyment of
cur young peopte, will be accomplished
by the inauguration and maintenance of
public winter sports and outdoor enjoy
ments. The Ice palace feature will, of
course, have to be dispensed with. But
if the Commercial club could get down
to the heart of the great masses of our
people they would find an enthusiastic
eagerness to do everything possible to
promote the establishment of a pro
gramme of outdoor enjoyments In St.
Paul during the winter season.
In some comparatively central section
of the city there "ought to be established
a public skating pond, and from that
point could be made, to radiate all the
oiher forms of popular enjoyment. Como
park Is now much more available to the
mass of our people than It used to be a
few years ago. The establishment of the
Como interurban car line has brought It
almost to the door of every household.
The extent of the patronage bestowed
on Como lake as a skating ground dur
ing the past winter or two shows what a
secure hold outdoor sports have on th«
imagination of our young'people.
The gentlemen of the Commercial club
will find that they have struck a re
sponsive chord in the popular heart in
connection with the enterprise for the es
tablishment of a series of public celebra
tions and outdoor entertainments during
the winter season. Taken hold of In the
spirit which used to animate the leading
citizens of St. Paul during the ice palace
days, the new movement will receive as
cordial support from the people as was

THE m'BOMC PLAGUE.
The stringent measures adopted by tho
United States to prevent the admission of
the bubonic plague at our ports are not
very seriously regarded by the public
generally. The danger is not thought to
be imminent and but little interest is
taken in the work of the health and quar
antine officers who alone realize the im
portance and difficulties cf their ta. jk.
The fact that at Oporto alone, since the
outbreak of the plague in Portugal, there
have been 280 cases and iS deaths is a
sufficient indication of the deadly char
acter of the disease, and throws doubt
upon tha oft repeated statement that
Europeans are not subject to the bubonic
plague. It makes clear that Europeans,
or Americans for that matter, who dwell
in the midst of filth and are uncleanly in
their habits ore as liable to contract the
plague as a Hindoo or a Chinaman, and
that there is no such thing as racial inir
enmity. An effective quarantine, perfect
salutation, especially in centers of popu
lation, and personal cleanliness are the
true safeguards.
MARK HAXSA'S STYLE.
Whoever writes the interviews which
are credited to United States Senator
Marcus A. Hanna should take some pains
to make them fit the man. A stout, pep
pery, brusque man who has not enjoyed
the blessing of a strictly classical edu
cation, such as Mr. Hanna, for instance,
would never think of saying to a repcrt
er:
"It would be an ungrateful thing for
me to discuss whether or not I will ac
cept another term as chairman of the
Republican national committee. It would
be audacious to discuss an offer that has
not been made."
He would state it in this way:
"What, me resign the chairmanship?
Don't you believe it, young man. Some
body has been stuffing you. I'll quit
when my time Is up and not before, and
you can say that for me in your paper,
if you like. And you can say, tco, that
I don't believe Henry C. Payne or any
one else ever said I was too sick to hold
the job. Henry nor anybody else would
talk of me like that, unless I told them
to. No, fir! I have got into this thing
and I'm going tc see It through."
Now that would sound more like Mr.
Hanna's style. It would fit his physique
and newspaper readers would feel more
pntl?fied that it came directly from the
distinguished senator.
A superintendent of schools in Kan

Advertisements That Enlighten.
Philadelphia Record.
An observant writer, who appears to
have been impressed with the power of
persuasive newspaper advertising, says:
"How many times does it happen that
people in reading advertisements sud
denly conclude that they want some
thing which they see described, but
which they had not previously thought
they stood in need of." Clever and in
structive trade notices always have this
effect upon the public, who get interested
in them and curious about the wares
mentioned. On the other hand, there are
many persons who know what they
want, but do not know where to pur
chase it. A perusal of the advertise
ments in their favorite newspaper would
give them all needful information.

WASHINGTON* Dec. 6.—(Special.)—
Now that congress has met more specula
tion than ever.hj being Indulged in re
garding the rfrobable length of this ses
sion The Republican politicians who
have something to gain by an early re
cess are hoping that there will not be
any unusual delay in pushing through ad
ministration measures of moment, so that
the session will not run so far over into
the next campaign that it will injure the
Republican party, not only in the con
gressional election, but In the presidential
contest as well. Supreme efforts there
fore are to be made by such men as
Senators Hanna, Platt, Davis, Nelson,
Hansbrough, Penrose, Allison, Cullom,
Spooner and others of like prominence to
push matters ft the utmost limit in
order that the" Republican measures,
which this congress will enact into laws,
will reach the people before they are com
pelled to vote af'the national election In
November, 1900. The Democrats, how
ever, are not so certain to permit their
Republican opponents to have their own
way about this matter. They can readily
see that if the recess between the two
sessions can be delayed as late as August,
or possibly as late as October in 1900, it
Is going to benefit the Democratic party
more than the Republican. It is stated
upon excellent authority that the Demo
cratic leaders in both houses of congress
are Just now organizing to prevent all
the important measures from slipping
through that the Republicans hope to
hurry through early in the coming year.
at * *
Representative Bailey will, without
doubt, be able to demonstrate to the sat
isfaction of his Democratic associates,
and to the disgust of his Republican col
leagues, that he is much better equipped
to carry on a fight in the interests of
his party than the man chosen for the
minority leadership of the house last Sat
urday. That Mr. Bailey is a strong man
on the floor Is not questionedby his Demo
cratic associates, though, because he is
a yeung man, they have endeavored to
cripple him in every way and prevent him
from becoming the prominent figure that
he later on will be if he has good luck in
congress. Mr. Bailey is well equipped in
every way to assume the leadership of
the Democrats, and it is probably a mis
take of the chamber to have worried him
so much that he is seeking peace and
quietness by attempting to secure a seat
in the United States senate from Texas
in place of Senator Chilton. It is be
lieved that Mr. Bailey will succeed in se
curing Mr. Chilton's seat, and the record
of his life will be made in the dignified
upper branch of congress, a place where
men of Bailey's caliber are always rec
ognized and always given due considera
tion at the proper time. He will probably
show himself to better advantage in the
upper house than in the lower branch. It
is a rough and tumble fight on all oc
casions in the house, while in the senate
nearly all tlje tjme the associations are
so dull that "the}?'drive a majority of the
members to rthe-cloak rooms for consola
tion, and the" spectators to the beautiful
streets of the national capital. If such
men as Bailey, however, talk to the sen
ate there may be,an opportunity for some
of the most ,I>rorainent slumberers in this
branch of congress to be awakened oc
casionally. Bailey may be able to ac
complish this. There are one or two
other men in this* branch of congress who
are able to do this, and among them are
Mr. Wolcott, of Colorado; Chandler, of
New Hampshire, and Mason, of Illinois.
The only great orator in the senate Is
Wolcott. Hejs spen to disappear from
the legislative balls of the government.
Mr. Wolcott cannot return to the senate
from the Centennial state when his pres
ent term expires. This he concedes and
he will probably endeavor to make a for
tune for himself, and may some time in
the future come back to congress much
better qualified than he is at the present
time. He has been a picturesque figure in
the United States senate for eight or ten
years, and the only man who has equaled
him in this peculiar plcturesqueness is no
less a person than John J. Ingalls, who
is now ending his career as a space writer
on a metropolitan newspaper at $20 per
column. Ingalls will not get back to con
gress for the reason that he is too old
a man to make an uphill fight. That
Wolcott may return is conceded by his
enemies. He is a young man yet, not
over fifty, while Ingalls is over sixty.
The advantage, as between the two great
orators in the senate in recent years, now
favors Wolcott, because he is a younger
man. He may come back to make trouble
for his enemies, but it Is doubtful now if
the great Kansas orator is ever permitted
to again occupy a seat in either house
of the national congress. —Van.

DRAMATIC READING.
Leland T. Powers, the impersonator,
who appears tonight at the People's
church for the Y. M. C. A. course, was
only secured by Secretary Grace after
considerable difficulty. At first the Red

Paul, as every date had been engaged
for this season. But so many psnple who
herad him last season in "Lord Chumley"
clamored for his return that last May
Secretary Grace* wrote directly to Mr.
Powers, and finally succeeded in secur

REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF HOUSE!
APPROVE FINANCIAL BILL RE
CENTLY INTRODUCED
SHOULD BE PASSED QUICKLY
Believed That the BUI Will Have
Been Approved Before Christmas
Receflß-Some Important Point*
Added to the Measure—Framen
of the Bill Ar« Congratulated
Upon Its Reception.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—The Republi
can members of the house of representa
tives gave their unanimous approval to
day to the house financial bill, recently
introduced, and recommended its imme
diate consideration and passage. This
was accomplished at the caucus held in
the hall of the house during the after
noon, by the adoption of the following
resolution:
"Resolved, That H. R. 1, entitled 'A bill
to define and fix the standard of value to
maintain the parity of all forms of money
issued or coined by the United States
and for other purposes,' be and the same
is hereby approved, and its immediate
consideration by the house and passage
after reasonable debate is recommend
ed and urged."
In pursuance of this resolution Mr.
Over street, of Indiana, who introduced
and who is in general charge of It, tomor
row will submit a resolution asking that
a special rule be introduced for the im
mediate consideration of this measure.
The terms of the special rule are prac
tically agreed upon, and provide that de
bate begin next Monday, with a final
vote at the close of the week.
The unanimous approval given to the
bill came after two hours of discussion
and the adoption of two amendments, ap
proved by tha framers of the bill.
When the meeting began Mr. Cannon
(111.) surrendered the chair to Mr. Hep
burn (Io.) in order to present his views
en some modifications he thought desir
able. These related to the national bank
ing features of the bill, and Mr. Cannon
gave it as his individual opinion that thia
branch of the subject might better be
modified or omitted. He distinctly stated,
however, that he supported the bill as a
whele, and would vote for it, and this
was further shown when he voted for tha
resolution of approval.
Mr. Cannon's suggestions did not take
the form of a debate, and were not
pressed.
MAIN AMENDMENT.
The main amendment was proposed by
the framers of the bill, to clear up some
ambiguity of tha present law. It i sto ba
a new section numbered F, and is as fol
lows:
"Sec. 9.—That section 10 of an act, ap
proved July 12, 1882, entitled 'An act to
enable national banking associations to
extend their corporate existence,' be and
the same is amended so as to read as fol
lows: 'Section 10—That upon a deposit
of bonds as described in sections 5159 and
51G0 of the Revised Statutes, the asso
ciation making the same shall be entitled
to receive from the comptroller of the
currency circulating notes of different
denominations in blank, registered and
countersigned, as provided by law, not
exceeding the par value of the United
States bonds so transferred and deliver
ed, and at no time shall the total amount
of such notes issued to any such as
sociation exceed the amount at such time
paid in of its capital stock, and the pro
visions of 5171 and 5176 of the Revised
Statutes are hereby repealed.' "
Another amendment is to section 4 of
the bill inserting the word "redemption"
before "fund" to make more plain where
redeemed notes and certificates are to fee
held.
Mr. garner (111.) offered an amendment
relating to that feature known as the Im
pounding of the greenbacks, but he was
satisfied from explanations given that
the amendment was not essential, and it
was withdrawn. There were some oth?r
suggestions and tentative amendments,
but none of them were pressed and tho
resolution of approval was then unani
mously adopted.
Mr. Overstreet and his ar-sociates who
framed the bill were warmly congratu
lated on having been able to command
such completa unanimity and approval,
which is regarded as giving assurance
that the bill will be passed before the
Chiistmas recess.
TREASURY TRANSACTIONS.
They Were of Unusual Magnitude
the Present Year.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—ln hia annual
report, Secretary of the Treasury Gage,
says:
"The transactions of the fiscal year, as
shown by the report cf the treasurer of
the United States, were of unusual mag
nitude, the net ordinary receipts having
been exceeded in any like period but
once, in 1563, and the net ordinary ex
penditures but thrice, in 1563, 1864. and
1565. Inclusive of the amounts involved
in the issue and redemption of bonds,
notes and certificates, the grops receipts,
under warrant, were $1,038,451,310.18, end
the gross expenditures $946,222,148.83.
There was, in consequence, an addition
of $''2,229,191.35 to the general treasury bal
ance, which increase I from $775,751,335. 11
to $8G7,950,559.46. These operations were
conducted through the offices of the
treasury, numbering 10, these of the mint,
increased during the year from 11 to 12,
and the depository banks, of which there
were 172 at ths beginning of the year and
257 at the close. The aggregate of money
handled by the treasury offices alono wns
*2.3P3,109,747 in the receipts and $2,371,283,62)
In the disbursements.
"While there was a deficiency of $89,
--111,559.87 in the ordirary revenues, the ex
cess of receipts over disbursements on ac
count of loans was sufficient to realize a
not surplus of $100,791,521.35 as the result
of the fiscal operations of the year. This
substantial addition to the available re
sources, together with the steady advance
of the receipts from taxation to an actual
excess over current needs, has relieved
the treasury of all danger of difficulty
from sudden emergency. Nor was the
growth of the available cash balance,
which stood at $251.485,516.20 at the C 1033
of the year, more wholesome than the im
provement In the character of the assets,
which were converted into gold as far as
fctatutory and other limitations would
pr rmit.
"The receipt of the proceeds of the war
loan extended from June, ISUB, to April,
1889, although the bulk of the subscrip
tions was fully paJd within ttu> first four
months. Of the total of nearly 1200.000,-
COO, no less than upward of $125,000,000 was
remitted Dy means of checks on banks
in all parts of the country, which were
collected through the Washington office.
This fact, with the further circumstance
that the remainder, which was paid in
rash into the offices of the treasury, was
divided among .them very nearly in pro
portion to their ordinary business, shows
how evenly th-3 whola country was repre
sented in the subscriptions."
SENATE SESSION BHIKF.
Resolution* Providing *««* PolyK
iiniy Inquiry and Boer Sympathy.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—The senate
spent half an hour In executive session
today, but beyond the very prompt t con
firmation of Secretary Root's nomina
tion sent in today and the reference to
the committee of the nominations sent
today transacted little business.
Mr. Rawlins, Utah, offered the follow
ing resolution, and asked immediate con
sideration:
"That the committee on Judiciary is
hereby ordered to investigate and report
to the senate:
"First—To what extent polj'gamy is
practiced or polygamous marriages are
entered into in the United States, or In
places over which they have jurisdiction.
"Second—Have polygamists, or persons
reputed to have more than one wife,
been elected to office by the people of
Utah, and if so, has such election been
for the purpose of encouraging polygamy
or in violation of any compact between
said state and the United States.
"Third—Have polygamists or persons
reputed to have more than one wife been
appointed to office by the president, by
and with the advice and consent of the
senate, or In cases where the concur
rence of the senate Is not required, and
If 30, have such appointments been made
In aid of polygamy or in violation of
the compact between the United States
and the state of Utah with reference to
that subject.
"Fourth—What, If any, steps should
be taken or measures enacted for the pre
vention of polygamy in the United States
and in places over which they have juris
distlon?"
Mr. Wolcott (Col.) objected to immedi
ate consideration, and the resolution was
referred to the judiciary committee.
On motion of Mr. Jones (Ark.) Mr.
Harris (.Kan.) was appointed temporarily
a member of the committee on privileges
and election.
Mr. Mason (III.) offered the following
resolution which he asked be allowed
to lie on the table until he should call
It up:
"VVhereas, from the hour of achieving
their own Independence, the people of the
United States have witnessed with sym
pathy the struggles of other people to
free themselves from European domina
tion, therefore
"Resolved by the senate of the United
States that we watch with deep and
abiding Interest the heroic battle of the
South African republic against cruelty
and oppression, and our best hopes go out
for the full success of their determined
contest for liberty."
BILLS INTRODUCED.
Outline of a Few of the Most Im
portant.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—Several hun
dred bills and joint resolutions were In
troduced In the senate today. Many of
them related to local and personal Inter
ests and many were old bills coming
over from the last session. The most Im
portant were the following:
By Mr. Hale, for the construction of
a Pacific cable by the navy department,
to be operated by the postoffice depart
ment, and appropriating $11,000,000 for
this purpose; Mr. Kyle, for the establish
ment of postal savings banks and a gov
ernment telegraphic system; for the re
striction of immigration and a joint reso

SEXATE CONTESTS.
Cases of Messrs. Quay, Clark and
Scott to Be Considered.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 6.—The meeting
of the senate committee on privileges
and elections has been called for tomor
row to consider the protest against the
seating of Senator Quay upon the ap
pointment of the governor of Pennsyl
vania, and the memorials urging the un
seating of Senator Clark, of Montana,
and Senator Scott, of West Virginia,
because of alleged Irregularities in their
respective elections. It is probable that
in order will be taken the testimony in
the Clark and Scott cases, and that there
may occur some delay in their considera
tion. No evidence, however, will be tak
en In the Quay case, in which only legal'
points will be considered. Both sides of
the controversy will be represented by
counsel.
MR. ROBERTS' PAY.
Not Decided ns to Whether It Has
Been Stopped.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—Whether the
pay of Mr. Roberts, of Utah, is stopped
»s a result of the action of the house in
refusing him a seat, has not been passed
upon by the house, and will not directly
arise until the January pay certificates
are issued by Speaker Henderson, by
which time it is said the case will be
permanently settled. Mr. Roberts drew
his pay up to Dec. 3, the day before con
gress assembled, on the certificate of
Clerk McDowell that he was a member
e'rect.

CUBANS REJOICE.
President's I'lterances as to Their
Future the Can.se.
HAVANA, Dec. 6.—President McT^.n
ley*s message to congress has been re
ceived by Cubans of all classos with sat
isfaction. Even members of the extreme
way of thinking admit that the fact that
there will be no American civil govern
ment has cleared away the clouds.
Gen. Gomez says:
"The message will pacify Cuba. Presi
dent McKinley's statements a.r«> not very
complete. But If congress guarantees
the Independence of Cuba we may not
ask for .my specific time for the removal
of the American troops, but we would
b* glad to see the black troops go, be
es use of the excesses they commit.
'"The Cubans fear the administration,
but they do not fear congress. The ad
ministration represents the trusts. Al
though the Cubans are as good business
men as the Americans, they could not
oomptte with great combinations of capi
tal, and the monopolies would eventu
ally enslave the workin^men. We wish
to see each man own property, enough
at least to make it worth his while to be
a good citizen. Instead of going to the
woods."
Gualbe-rto Gomez said:
"I had expected the message to be en
couraging, but I had not looked for such
clearness of expression. Congress will go
even further and justify the confidence
of the Cubans."
The Discussion says:
"President McKinley's message will fill
the hearts of the peopi 1© with Joy. His
w-ords 'whatever else we may do, we
must see to it that free Cuba becomes a
reality, not a name,' should be written
in letters of gold over each door. On- i
bans are bound to Lincoln and McKin
ley by bonds of love."
The Patria says:
"Hurrah for President McKinley. He
could not have spoken in clearer tones.
It is impossible for the giddiness of con
quest to overpower the deep, natural
Impression of a free and democratic peo
ple."
The Cubano says:
"The message contains the clearest
words yet spoken bjr President McKinley,
and shows that justice is the guiding
principle at Washington. Our hearts,
hitherto bowed down by the tremendous
skepticism, are now relieved, and we may
expect congress to speak still more
ciearly."

GOVERNORSHIP
AT A MEETING NEXT TUESDAY
Hl* Friends Ciet to the Point Where
They Expect to Know Definitely
Whether He Is a Candidate -jr
Xot-Hl« Decision to Have Some
Influence on Gen. Clann'a Ambi
tious.
A meeting of ihe friends of Judge Col-
Una is .scheduled to take place next Tues
day night at the Merchants' hotel At
that time it is expected that the St. Cloud
jurist will mate a statement as to his po
sition in connection with th e gubernatorial
nomination and .state definitely whether
or not ha will enter the race for the Re
publican nomination. Up to date no
authorized statement has been made by
Judge Collins regarding hi* reported can
didacy and, as there has been a disposU
tion to forca matters on the part of the
Van Snnt people, as a matter of protec
tion and to learn upon just what ground
they stand the Sixth district peopl» will
get together at Judge Collins' apanmenta
at the Merchants' next Tuesday night
The meeting will not be one exclusively
of the Sixth district, as all of Judge Col
lins' closest friends have been invited to
be present.
A prominent Sixth district man said
to the Globe yesterday:
t TeX^ Tuesday we will know whether
Judge Collins will enter tho race, and I

The .fathering is for the purpose indi
cated. At the same time the friends of
Congressman Page Morris are becoming
apprehensive of the candidacy o f J. Adam
Bede, which is beginning to assume def
inite outlines. Tha Interests of Judga
CoHlria wlll be taken care of }f
wishes to enter the race, it is certain he
wfU have the unstinted support of his dls-
Z' Ct', .At the same tlm<? Congressman
Morris friends see a chance to do a little
missionary work on the side.
It is said that if Judge Collins declines
to become an aspirant for the guberna
torial nomination that Moses E. Clapp
of St. Paul, will come out openly as a
candidate. This would mako Van Sant
iind Clapp candidates with Evans who
already has the indorsement, of ~the ad
ministration. But it is said that as far
as the Sixth is concerned that Gen. Clapp
would not receive tha united support of
the district. In Duluth it is reported that
Van Sant has been doing gcod work, and
that he will have a good following- in the
Zenith City.
The Sixth district, if Judge Collins be
comes a candidate, have no other candi
date for a place on the ticket. The wheel
horses of the party will go right in and
solidly support their favorite son, and will
at the outset, if Clapp is not a candidate,
have a part of the Seventh district. With
this combination effected, the Sixth will
be in a position to go ahead and make a
winning combination if such a thing is
possible, leaving Van Sant :n control of a
part of the convention representation, but
not enough to nominate him, just as he
had two years ago.
Senator J. D. Jones, of Long Prairie,
left yesterday for Washington in the in
terest of a member of his family, who 13
looking for a consular appointment. He
vill also remain over and attend the
meeting of the League of Republican
clubs and a3sist th-3 committee which
goes from here today to secure for St.
Paul the next annual gathering of tha
organization.
The Fergus Falls Journal lands the fol
lowing: "Col. L. A. Rosing, Gov. L.ir.d's
efficient private secretary, seems to be
the object of vicious attacks from Popu
lists all over the state. It is true that
Col. Rosing is a Democrat, but r. • Is a
very able man and what success G^v.
Ldnd's administration has achieved 13
largely due to his skill in handling af
fairs. He Is courteous alike to all and
seems to have the affairs of the state well
in his grasp."
M. J. Dowllng came from Renville last
night to collect a delegation which will
leave this evening for Washington, with
the avowed determination of securing ihe
next annual convention of the National
League of Republican Clubs for St. Paul.
The delegation consists of M. J. Dowlin?,
Dar Reese. C. C. Whitney, C. M. Wilcox,
Marshall, Minn.; Fred Bryant and Fred
Wright. Minneapolis.
The Minnesota committee will make its
Washington headquarters at Wlllard's,
where the executive committee of the na
tional league will hold a session on Tues
day to determine the date and location
for the next annual convention. The ex
ecutive committee Is composed of one
member from each state and territory,
and is empowered to decide upon the city
In which the 1900 pow-wow will convene.
The last annual convention of the
league was held in Omaha. Mirwaukee
has also hau a session of the league,
though It has never come nearer to St.
Paul. The 1900 convention will be of
particular Interest, since it will be held
previous to the national convention of
the Republican party, at which nomina
tions for the presidency and other state
officials will be made. Mr. Dowiinpr con
siders St. Paul's pro.-pects good. "There
is no reason why the convention should
not come North," said he. "Neither of
the cities have ever had it, while it has
gon* West and South in previous years.
Philadelphia, Galveston, Tex., and Indi
anapolis are St. Paul's competitors. The
delegation will m;ike a strong lisjht for
the convention, and has hopes of secur
ing it."
Afraid of Himself.
John Regan, employed at -101 Jacks >n
street, walked up to Officer Flynn. at
Seventh and Wabasha streets, last even
ing, and requested to be taken in charge.
Tie said he feared his mind was affected.
and wanted to be cared for until the spell
of mental depression passed away.
The young man was removed to the
central station, where City Physician
Rkheson examined him and had him
taken to the county jail. Regan says
he has been drinking hard of late, and
Dr. Hicheson thinks his condition due to
this fact. Regan says his home is at Dea
Molnes, 10.
