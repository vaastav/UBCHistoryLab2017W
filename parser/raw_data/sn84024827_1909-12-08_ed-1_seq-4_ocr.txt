THE MESSAGE.
The message of President Taft was
'-read to congress this morning. "Econ
. omy In expenditure and sufficiency
of revenue- Is the most important.
. question 'confronting tnc present ad
.. ministration In the opinion of the
C president. Concerning the tarifT he
. says 'that nothing more ought to be
" dono along that line, until the tarirf
commission presents reliable data suf
ficient to guarantee Intelligent action.
J The' president notes the increase In
the cost of living, but denies that this
- Increased burden is the result of, the
"recent tariff bill.
The president says that the people
desire -postal' savings baulks and fur
ther says that these banks would bo
a good substitute for guarantee bank
deposit' law3 which he regards as do-
moralizing to conservative banking.
However, he stops short of a -specific
endorsement of the portal banks.
The message is lacking in vigor and
' there are no reforms recommended
which will attract any special attea
vjion. except, perhaps, where he recom
, mends legislation which will effect
' the future issuance of Injunctions by
-United States courts, calling for a law
, which will give to a defendant a rea
sonable chacco to be heard before an 1
'.injunction shall be issued, but here
f- makes numerous exceptions.
Tllb president recommends that Ari- j
zona and New Mexico be admitted as I(:e, and that the success he has
separate states, in accordance with fhleved In the past augurs well for
the future development under his ad
the declaration of tho last republican mjnistraUoa of l branches of tho
national, convention. In this coanec-
tion heTecommends that the constitu
tion be adopted only after an approv-
al of the people of the territories. This
recommendation Is not clear as no
state has ever had a constitution put
into effect until after Its approval by
tho neonle. It has teen confidently 1
expected that the president would re
commend the statehood bill ever since
.his recent visit to the territory. He
" could not omit this -In the face of the
1
- declaration of his party, besides it is
known that President Taft desires
;that the two remaining territories W
J?added to the sisterhood of states.
f. While the president stands pat on
the present tariff bill and on the prin
ciple of protection, he puts that ques
tion far in the future by the state
ment that It will require the now tar
iff board, or commission, several
years to complete the labor assigned
them and declares until that work Is
completed nothing further should be
undertaken in the way of tariff legist
lation.
The' president promises a special
message to congress in which he will
make recommendations regarding the
further conservation of the natural re
sources of the country, lcaludlag wat
erways, reclamation, irrigation, ro-i
foresting, etc. It may be assumed that
the60 recommendations will tc favor
aBlo'io the growing west.
The message may be described as
a. conservative documont, throughout, jjs of a nine-ronnd turkey, plum pud
and thoracis nothing In it to remind jg for.four, mincemeat for three

GENERAL BELL
WILL RETIRE
In the month of April next General
Bell, tho presont chief of etaft In the
war department, will" leave that posi
tion to bo filled by another. There
are several applicants lor this high
military position, but General Arthur
Murray, present chief or coast artil
lery, is said to be well In the' lead .for
tho position. He has been a close
friend of tho president since Mr. Taft
was at the head of the war depart
a.4nL
The appointment or Goneral Murray
it .be chief .of .staff of thearay would
bu most pleasing to Arizona. He Is.
a brother of Mrs. Judge Doan, who
sf present Tesldos at Douglas. He vls
Itsd.' Arizona and is acquainted with
IM conditions and military needs of
the country along the border. Judge
Evan has already written to General
Murray about the ambition of Doug
It bto secure the border pest proppsed
for this section of Arizona, and should
ho become the advocate pf the o3tab
Jshment of a military iost near
Douglas that would bo a powerful ',n-
tftcco In our favor, whetner Rp&eral
Muray Is miide chief of staff or not.
Concerning tho probabilities as to
ic naming of a new chief of staff
toj tho army by President Taft In
April next, a Washington correspon
lent of tho New York Tribune sends
tht following to that papert
That General Arthur Murray, chlei
of coast artillery, will be the choice
st tho President as successor to Gee
eral j. 'Ffanfilln Bell as chief of staff
hen the latter's term of duty ends
next April, is the predlctlqn oftaany
veil posted officers In the war de
partment. The choice of a successor
to General Bell Is a topic of the ut
most interest to officers who realize
that la large measure tho welfare of
the" army depends on the ability of
the" individual assigned to 'this' impor
tant post.
"Tho officers regarded as most cer-'
tain to be seriously- considered are
General Leonard Wood, commanding
the department of the east; General
William H. Carter, commanding tho
department of Luzon; General Wil
liam W. WItherspoon, assistant chief
of staff, and General Murray.
"Thoso who believe General Mur
ray will probably be chosen point to
the' fact that not only did ho enjoy
closo and pleasant relations with the,
president when he was secretary of
war, but that he possesses to a re
markable degree the faculty of ob
taining desirable army legislation
from Congress, and that with high
technical attainments he combines the
ability to get along without friction
with all his associates In the war de
partment. General Murray, It 'nlll be
recalled, wa3 almost solely responsi
ble for the passage by congress of the
army pay bill, and so successful has
he proved In obtaining appropriations
for his own department that there has
been some small degree of jealousy
of the coast defense corps. Those
who advocate the selection of Gen
eral Murray say taht as chief , of staff
his sympathies would be catholic, that
jit would be Incumbent on him to de
vote his energies to the proportionate'
development of every arm of the ser-
IniHtary establishment."
Commentlng on tho probabilities of
a new chief of staff for 'the army the
jf511 Post " tha '"Dowlns:
I Friotion may dev uop between
Pres!dent Taft . Secretary of War
Dickinson over the appointment of
.a successor to General J". Franklin
ce" a3 cn,el sla"- " s not iiKoiy,
however, t be of much consequence,
as the secretary Is expected to defer
to the "clshes of the president.
"President Taft is said to favor
General Arthur Murray, chief of the
coast artillery, for the place, while
Secretary' Dickinson Is desirous of
having General William H. Carter, at
present In the Phlllpplnse, as his chief
adviser, for that is what the chief of
staff really Is. General Murray has
been a close friend of the president
ever since the latter was secretary
of war, while General Carter and Sec
retary Dickinson have known each
other for years. Besides, General
Carter practically made the plans un
der which the staff was organized.
"It has been said by officials at
the war department that the contest
has now narrowed down to these two
men. General Leonard Wood, the
ranking officer of the army, and Gen
eral Clarence Edwards, head of the
bureau of Insular affairs, are still
within the possibility, however, of be
ta gappolnted. But it was said that
it is unlikely that either will be ap
pelated unless there bo real friction
over the appointment of General Car
ter or General Murray."

crease in the cost of living In ten
years had been 49 per cent.
Meantime the Increase In wages has
been small ami the increase In sal
aries has been still smaller. And
1
since, thp increase in pay has not been
nearly so large as tho increase in the
cost of living, how have the masses
adapted themselves to the new sltua-Mess
Uon? The answer is plain. They have
simply and necessarily lowered the
standard of living. The matter of in
come is, after all, measured by what
the income will buy, not by its defin
ition In dollars and cents. The in
comes of the masses will not begin to
purchase now what they did ten years
ago, nor what they did two years ago;
but unless there Is a check in the en
croachments of organized greed, they
still purchase more "than they will
hereafter.
The greatest of all factors in the
Increase of the cost of living is the
protective tariff. The protective tar-
ff, in its extreme abuses, is also tho
chief cause of the concentration of
wealth. And aside from the general
suffering that arises from the inequit
able distribution of wealth through
the tariff protected trusts and the
conditions they create .this concen
tration of wealth is the greatest of
all menaces to the political security
of the nation. Kansas City Times
(Kep).
The people of Cochise county owe
it to themselves to move the county
seat away from Tombstone. If tho
county seat was located here in Bis
bee "the great saving to -the conn
ty would amount to many thousands
of dollars each year. The public build
ings at Tombstone are inefficient and
will soon have to be replaced. The
people of the county will never con
sent to the expenditure of any more
money at Tombstone, unless for some
trivial repairs. The people of the
county should begin now the work of
preparation for moving the county
seat If the shortest way is to have
the present county seat removal law
amended then agitation for that
should be started nd kept up. -.,
What Is the matter with Delegate
Cameron? We note that the statehood
bill for Arizona has been introduced
by Chairman Hamilton, of the com
mittee on territories. Why was not
the Arizona delegate permitted to in
troduce the bill for tho admission of
Arizona? This man Hamilton was the
one who tried so hard to tie Arizona
to New Mexico with the Joint state

CONFIDENCE GAME

HORSE" EXPRESS PACKAGE
GRAFT CF YEARS AGO. i.
Is there a new bunco game being
aorUed throughout the tibuthwest:
TJhis is apparently true when the
facts that at least two well known
men have received postal cards re-
cently telling them of suit cases be
longing to them found on a Pullman
car near New Orleans. In neither
case has the man beep upon a train
in that direction for some time.
s, ' -
The latest receiver of a letter of
this character was R. R. Richardson,
of the Patagonia Commercial com
pany, located at Patagonia, Ariz. Mr.
Rlchardsoa writes as follows:
"Gentlemen:
"I noticed in an Issue of your pa
per a letter which had been received
from New Orleans by a Bisbee malt,
Ltelllng about a suit case being held
there ofr express charges, etc. I re
ceived 'just such a notice saying that
the charges on my suit case were
$3.45, I think, I paid no attention to
ii, as I never lost a suit case. I think
It is a new bunco game and should tie
looked up carefully."
The first notification of this kind
was received about two weeks ago
by Joseph Llppert, the Main street
barber. Mr. Llppert turned the card
over to the Review with the state
ment that he had never lost a suit
case, and It was this statement which
was noticed by Mr. Richardson.
It would appear that a. rather sllcx
bunco game is being worked by
flcial envelop, letterhead and type
vrltteu body of the bogus notifica
tion will ead the "suckers" on. Some
pcopla might be so foolish as to bite
on this game, sending on the money
for charges in hope of getting some
I'.ing for nothing, or nearly nothing.
It maj be taken up bj tt.e postal
department. '
