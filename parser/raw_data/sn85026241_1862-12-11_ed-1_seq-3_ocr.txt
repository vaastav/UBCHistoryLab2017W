The President's Message.
[From the New York Tribune.]
Tn the stormy era In which it has pleased
God to oast nur lot, it is well that a country
so tried ss ours should have one among its
leaders in whose integrity, patriotism, and
uncalctilating devotion to the noblest ends,
all may and doennfiiria. .That man is Abra
ham Lincoln. To disparage his abilities,
criticise his rhetoric, pmnotinue him too fast
here or too slow there, may not be diffionlt;
but thore lives no loyal American who dis
trusts his earnest dosirie to servo and save
the Union. Whon faction. Meaning to stop
just short of treson. affirms that the War
lor tho Union is only prosecuted for the
aggrandizement of contractors and Jobbers
that those whoiuot esrtie.tly snpport the
Fedeml Unvernmuiit areiiite hs responsible
ior tho lldlielhon as tho-e who fomented
inaua-urated. and still uphold it it is con
fronted by the presence in the foreground
of one msn who refused to the last to believe
Treason, Disunion and Civil War to be
seriously nunmscd wlio, in hia Inutiitusl.
condescended to (.lead with the architects
of ruin anil entreat them to pause in their
mad career who hesitated to shod blood,
even in vindication of rightful, essentia
authority, until absolutely forced to do so
by the cotisoirators for Disunion conimnen-
ciug the tray and who, IVouf that moment
to the present, has been unxious only to
secure a return, at the earliest possible mo
ment, to the mild sway of Law, Order, and
reace.
Mr. Lincoln's Message discusses many top
icsof Brave interest, and embodies many im
portant suggestions; but the interest of one
subject therein canvassed overrides all
others, and his expose will be hailed with
heartv annroval or simrrfcd with execration
aa the reader substantially agrees with or
diasents trom his judgment on tbis point.
Essentially, the President sees and pro
claims that Sliii'erti Aim liecomethe imoliica-
blf foe of the American Union, nnd thnt tlte
Slave l ower mutt die in ortler tniit tne Re
public may live. Ane this is. so obviously,
so glaringly true, that th historian will
have difficulty in realizing that it was ever
gravely disputed.
It seems inoredible that human audacity
should be equal to the task of misrepresen
ting the President's position, "Is he not
pledged to prosecute the war to the sole end
of restoring the legitimate authority of the
Constitution and Union?" Most certainly
he is; and that is just what ho is doing.
It is preoisely and only because the Slave
Power is the chief, the fundamental obstacle
to such restoration, that he is compelled to
grupple with it in mortal encounter. It is
Slavery nothing under heaven but Slavery
that unites the lower counties of Mary
land ves, and of Delaware also in bonds
of lively sympathy with the Confederate
traitors, while a great majority of the peo
ple of those States, living unuursod by the
daily clung of human fetters, aro and ever
have been loyal. It is Slavery, and nothing
else, that makes the Old Dominion a den
of treus in, while Witt Virginia, on the con
trary, having few slaves, is stunuhly loyal.
It is Slavery whioh reverses the poles of
Tennessee, making her Kastern division a
oitadel of Unionism, while Middle and West
Tennessee are cankered with treason. Sj
in Missouri, every oounty wherein Slavery
wn predo ninant has swarmed with gurrillus
and -ent in y into toswli tho Ritui armies
win e iis Krue-Liibor communities rally in
stiiiutivtdy under the old flag. Hence,
healthy amount of Unionism in Northern
Alabama and Mississippi, but none is per
ceptublo in Southern; hence Unionism
struggling to thosurfuue in Western Texas,
Imt oowed and dumb in Eastern; hence
Unionism outspokeu in New-Orleans, Mem
i ill is. Nashville, but none to SDeak of
(among Whi'es) on the great plantations
whnraby - tb,nae ouiee - aro stirrouuad.-r-
Who can misread those undeniable facts?
Were Slavery dead to day, we might to
morrow mutter out of service every Union
soldier, and still the Union would be oer
tuinly and speedily restored. Leave Slav
ery where this Rebellion found it, and you
may kill and bury every man now in the
Confederate armies, with every one who
could be induced to serve in those armies,
and still tho Uuion would soon bo again
assailed, and must ultimately fall unless its
mortal foe should be killed first. Secession
is in the blood of the slaveholding caste,
and will never be' expelled while Slavery
remains.
"Blmll uol the Mlf-ssme mnlil
Frodiic Hie H'-miiih men!"
Slavery has been thirty years reaching
the conclusion that she is unequally and in
juriously yoked with Free Labor in our Re
public that her interests suffer, nnd mutt
suffer, from the partnership. She has
summoned all her resources for a life and
death struggle she has violently severed
the ligament that bound hor to tho Free
States she may be temporarily coerced
into submission, but never reconciled to
lovaltv. Ihe South niuy easily here claim
ed to sincere Unionism the Slave Power
never oan be. io it, the Union must ever
be a loathed memory, a symbol of humil
iation ; while by the renovated South it will
bechertshed as her beueooent deliverer
from the hideous nightmare that so long
tottered and paralyzed her. the union
may r.nd will be saved ; the Slave Power
might be : both together never can be.
Whv is it that the ODDonents of the
President's policy do not meet the real is
sue, instead of inventing and interposing
another ? He would gladly have restored
tho Union as it was : but that was not pos
sible, lie might as well be required now to
fill a bushel basket with the dew of last
Fourth-of- July morning. He oan only save
the Union by throttling its ' arch-enemy ;
and they who insist that he shall not do
this, really desire that he should fail, let
the country no to pieces, and trust to their
future incantations to resurrect it from the
witches caldron into which its mangled re
mains will have be on oast. The question is
not between saving the Union in one way
and another, but between savins it in the
practicable way pointed out by the Presi
dent, or not saving it at all. He urges
Emancipation that the Nation may be
. saved : he does not and never did seek to
divert the War for the Union into a War
for Emancipation. He simply proposes to
save the country by the shortest, easiest,
surest way, and let slavery abide tne oou
