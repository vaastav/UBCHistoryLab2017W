WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.— The
agreement between President
Roosevelt and the Smithson-
I: n Institution as to the
president's hunting trip in Africa was
made public today by Charles D. Wol
cott, secretary of the Institution.
The Board of regents of the institu
tion yesterday considered the presi
dent's letter ajid adopted a resolution
entering: into a contract with the pres
ident for certain work. The president
wrote to Dr. Wolcott as follows:
-About the flrst of April next I
Intend to start for Africa. My
plans are, of course. Indefinite, but
at present I hope they will be some
thing on the following order:
May Day in Mombasa
"By May 1 I shall land at Mora
basa and spend the next few
months hunting and traveling, in
British and German East Africa;
probably going through or toward
Uganda, with, the^ expectation of
striking the Kile about tee begin
ning of the new year and then
\u25a0working down It. with side trips
after animals and birds, so as to
come out at tide water, say about
March 1. This would give me 10
months in Africa.
"As you know, I am not in the
least a game butcher. I like to do a
certain "sxnount of hunting, but my
real and main interest is the in
terest of a fauna! naturalist. Now,
it seems to roe that opens the best
chance for the national museum to
get a. fine collection not only of the
big game beasts, but of the smaller
mammals and birds of Africa; and,
looking at it dispassionately, I be
lieve that the chance ought not to
be neglected. I will make arrange
ments to pay for the expenses of
myself and my son. But what I
would like to do would be to get
one or two professional field taxi
dermists of the naturalists to go
with me, who should prepare and
send back the specimens we collect.
The collection which would thus go
to the national museum would be of
unique value. It would, I hope. In
clude specimens of big game, to
gether with the rare smaller ani
mals and birds.
Specimens for the Nation
"I have not the means that would
enable me to pay for the field nat
uralists or the taxidermists and
their kit, and the transport of the
, specimens and curing of same for
the national museum. Of course,
the actual hunting of the big game
I would want to do myself, or have
* my son do so; but the specimens
will all go to the national museum,
save a very few personal trophies
of littlo scientific value, which for
that reason I might wish to keep.
"Now, can you, in view of getting
these specimens for the national
museum, arrange for the services
of the field taxidermists, and for the
care and the transport of the speci
mens? As ex-president I should
feel that the national museum Is
the museum to which my collection
should go."

For Reservoir Site
Englebright Raises Points as to
Transfer of Lands That Are
Quickly Explained
{Special Dispatch' to The Call]
•WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.— The house
committee on public lands today con
sidered the Joint resolution introduced
by Representative Kahn- providing for
the acquisition by San Francisco' of
lands In Hetch Hetchy basin. Secre
tary Garfield of the interior . depart
ment was present. He and City : ' E
ngineer Manson and Supervisor Giannlui
presented the case in behalf of • San
Francisco, while objections were .made
. « * .-•\u25a0\u25a0-.
by Representatives Needham and En
glebrlght.
Garfield Urges Transfer „ -
Secretary Garflcld went .thoroughly
into the history of the permit granted \
by him to San Francisco authorizing ;
the city, to impound 'water at - Lake
Eleanor and Hetch Hetchy, and -ex
plained how the rights of the govern
ment and of the Turlock and Modesto
Irrigation districts had -been :'safe
guarded. He urgently recommended the
passage of the joint resolution which
merely authorized the transfer :6f: 6f cer
tain land: owned by San- Francisco in
the Sierra forest reserve for other
lands required for reservoir purposes.
Representative Needham • suggested'
that , the committee "should ;be.f.yery
careful in recommeridingfanyjlegisia
tlon>:on; the - subject,' His
tftati the city^ hereafter'mjght. abandon
Its project at Hetch r Hetchy and»leave
the way open for. private speculators
to gobble the water < rignts to .t he det
riment of the Turlock ; and -Modesto
districts.. \u25a0\u0084"\u25a0\u25a0• v "J." . :; - ' -v- "• ':)
This objection was explained away
by Manson. and Gianni ni to the ap
parent satisfaction of the. committee.
Would Offset Tax Loss
Representative Englebright's objec
tion to the resolution was that "the
lands now owned by San Francisco In
Tuolumne county, if transferred to the
government, would no longer.be subject
to taxation, thereby . depriving' that
county of revenue. Manson's reply' to
this was that, the large sum to beex
pended in construction work and road
building would more than offset any
loss in taxes. ; 'iVf'*''
The committee finally referred the
resolution to a subcommittee, consist
ing of Smith of California, Galnes of
West Virginia, Howland of Ohio, Rob
inson'^ of "Arkansas and Hammond of
Minnesota. This committee will con
sider the matter further Friday morn
ing.; , \u0084, \u25a0
As congress will adjourn this week
over the holidays ;it is, not expected
that the full committee will have- the
subject befo.re it until January 6.' Man
son and Glanninl will remain here dur
ing the interval doing their best to
convince members of the- committee
that the resolution should be adopted. \u25a0

The supervisors last night . received
the following telegram from Dr..Gian
nini: •: ." .' ". , . •\u25a0 ' / - V • ;:'; :' ;
-"Hearing, before committee this morn

ernment on failure of city, to construct
and utilize reservoirs. -Others desired
•to read grant ; into bill precluding ad
ditional privileges from interior de
partment. Garfield appeared in per
son and made strong appeal for city,
sitting through meeting. for two hours,
an unusual ' occurrence. • Bill referred
to subcommittee, of which Smith of
California is chairman, for modification
as "above 'noted. ' Submission of bill to
subcommittee does not appear to mean 1
delay, or pigeonholing/ but at 'present
writing appears favorable. , . Subcom

Henshaw: had j received the supposed genuine notes before making any ar
rangements for the transfer of the bonds, Henshaw was at a loss apparently
for an answer. .'.-. .
Beseeches Tyler Henshaw '^
confessed the forgery of the four notes and
that they, were: still in the possession of Banker Henshaw developed at a
meeting;of Murray and Henshaw yesterday at the Oakland office of William
,G.\Henshaw.">The latter told Murray that Signor and Ty lor Henshaw were
in San Jose, but it^was; learned later in the day that Signor was in Oakland
beseeching Tylerj Henshaw, who remains loyal to him,, to come, to this side
of the bay and take up the other two notes bearing the forged signature of
Murray, -which Signor gave to two local banks to secure them against loss
on. two checks: indorsed by Mrs. Abbie Krebs, which Signor. unlawfully in
dorsed and cashed after he had been removed from the position of manager
of the Interurban motor express "company.
Faces Double Prosecution
'«. As a result" of .yesterday's development .Murray, through his attorney,
Harry 7 Creswell, ; purposes to present the matter to the district attorney. of
Alameda county. .with, a. \-iew of having the grand jury of. that county indict
Signor. for ; forgery. In ;the meantime the banks on this side of the bay are"
preparing to j have, Signor arrested for embezzlement, and between the two
criminal proceedings \u25a0it is expected that there will be developed one of -the
most sensational : cases -of its. character in the criminal history of California.
. - Sierioris still under surveillance, but strangely he is as hopeful as he was
several, days ago when the forgeries were first exposed that Tyler 'Henshaw
will/come'to his rescue' and get him out of his .serious predicament. Ail he
wouldsay yesterday when confronted with the fact that his confession was
\ known t and -that William Henshaw had denounced him was that he expected
.tnat'»:Tyler;Hehshaw.w6uld_'help him out of .his scrape in a few days. Tyler
Henshaw would not talk, and his brother, William, was equally reticent. !
