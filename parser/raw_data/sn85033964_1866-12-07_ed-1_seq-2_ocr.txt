ties, in the apportionment of members of
the House of Representatives, shall be made
up to such county or counties in the Senate
as near as may be i practicable."
These provisions leave no doubt that the
Cramers of our Constitution intended that
the General Assembly should be composed
of representatives elected by the people
from the several counties and districts all
over the State. Tbey have sedulously pro
vided for the representation of fractions of
counties either in the House or Senate.
They could not have 6howa more explicitly
their deliberate intention that the General
Assembly should represent the whole peo
plo upon whom it is dependeut. It was
never intended that a part of the . State
might alone be represented, or that a domi
nant majority might exclude a minority for,
any cause.
To constitute a General Assembly there
must be representation of the entire State
All the members need not be in attendance,
but all must have the right to attend. If
there be not a full and fair representation,
unless by the wilful act of the electors them
selves, there can be no. constitutional As
sembly. A body, although styling itsel
the General Assembly, which, in violation
of its duty, excludes the representatives o
a pari of the people, either by mere physi
cal force or by unlawfully excluding them
is in fact not a General Assemby within
the meaning of the organic law of this State
The only remaining point to be consid
ered is, whether the Courts can, in the ad
justment of private rights, take notice o
these unconstitutional acts of the Senate and
House in wrongfully excluding their mem
bers. And here the authorities are uniform
upon the principle involved, although no
decision can be found upon the precise state
of facts. The Courts have always said that
however reluctant tbey might be to call in
question the conduct or proceedings of a
co-ordinate branch of the Government, they
would be guilty of a plain violation of duty
if they failed to act in a proper ca3e. They
have lso always said that the enactment o
laws was the province of the Legislature
but whether a particular measure is in fact
a law, must be determined by the Courts
An act may be void because violative of
some positive provision of the Constitution
It may be nulity becsuse not accompanied
by the Constitutional forms which determ
ine its author ily, and yet be held invalid be
cause, in reality, not passed by the Genera
Assembly. : t .
The decision of these points falls clearly
within the jurisdiction of the Courts. To
pass an act is' one thing, and to decide
whether that is a law. of the land,' binding
on the citizen, is. another. When the in
validity turns upon the conduct of the Leg
islature themselves, the task of the court is
indeed a very delicate one, and, fortunately
for our country, without many precedents.
In one of the North-western States, I be
lieve, it has been judiciously decided by its
courts that an act, appropriating a very
large body of land to a railroad was void
it being shown that a majority of those vot
ing in favor of the measure were bribed.
If it were mado to appear that a supposed
law had never been passed by the General
Assembly at all, but had been fraudulently
inserted, in the statute books by the com
bined action of the Speakers of the two
Houses,' and the Secretary of State, can
there be a doubt that the courts could pro
nounce the supposed law a nulity? (Turley
vs. county of Logan, 17 sec. 157.)
If only a fraction of the Legislature, with
its officers, were shown to have forcibly ex
cluded the rest of the members, and setting
themselves up as a Legislature, to have
passed and published what they pleased to
term laws, can there be as little doubt that
the courts could and ought to renounce the
(so-called) acts invalid? And can there be
any different in principle between these
cases and tbs one before us? I can see
none. c; . .
The body .'which undertook to pass the
act now undff consideration had eaaed to
be a constitutional General Assembly by its
wrongful exsTasion of a Dumber of the rep
resentatives of the peoples To hold other
wise would be to put the people at the mer
cy of a dominant faction, and make the
courts, which ourht to be the impartial ad
ministrators of justice', pliant tools of in
justice and wrong.' ' Laws, to be binding,
must be the deliberate act of a regular Gen
eral Assembly, fairly representing every
portion of the State. . .; .
All the representatives, as I have before
said, need not be present, but all must have
the right to be present. If any material
part of them are wrongfully excluded, ii
would not perhaps be going too (tr to say
(although not necessay in this case to be so
held) if any one of them be wrongfully
excluded the body ceases to be the Gen
eral Assembly; and becomes an unauthor
ized mob. " . . .(...,
If I m correct in the foregoing reason
ing, f,he act in question is simplynuH and
void, and all acts done under it illegal.
The proper office of a maodmus's to
enforce the performance of official duty,
aml.it will not be to compel an officer or
other person to do an act which it would
pot have been lawful for him to do without
its command. .(Johnson and others vs.
Lucas and dauber, 14 Hump., 306.) It
therefore becomes the duty of the Court to
dismiss the petition of the relator with
Jcogb Cooper's Opinion. We yield a
considerable portion of our 6pace to-day to
the masterly opinion of Judge Cooper, at
Mtlrfreesboro,' on the Franchise Law. We
have no apology to make for giving eo much
space to this document. It involves a qu8S
tion of such vital importance to the people
at large that we consider the space well oc
cupied, and invite everybody to read it.
Judge Cooper takes bold of the subject with
tl.e nerve of a patriot and dissects it with
the ability of a statesman and jurist; and if J
his decision should be sustained by the Su-
preme Court, that odious blot upon
our statute books, known as the Fran
chise law, will be expunged.
In this decision Judge C. has shown
himself worthy to bear the name of his il
lustrious brother, our able and distinguish
ed Representative in Congress, who is to
day battling so nobly against Radical fanati
cism and in defence of constitutional liberty.
The Hails.
We call upon our contemporaries all over I
the State, says the Nashville Banner, to
aid us in the effort to awaken an interest in
the publio mind,with regard to opening the
mails in Tennessee. We are informed by
the special postal agent for this State, that
one of the reasons why the routes and offi
ces are not opened, is not because persons
cannot be found who can take the oath, but
because of the small remuneration for car
rying . the 'mails, allowed by the Govern
ment. He also informs, us that: he has
in all case 8 instructed the sub-agents to al
low the most liberal construction of the re-
quired oath of office. The law requires
that the applicant shall make oath that he
has not, with intent to aid therein, partici
pated in . the rebellion. It is the opinion
of the agent, that there is not a district
throughout the State where some one or
more citizens might not be found who could
come within the law's provision on this sub
ject. He also advises that where men can
not be procured to act as post masters, that
women or girls of intelligent age, be re
quested to undertake the duty and act as
post mistresses. A number of post mis
tresses have already been appointed, and,
the system acts like a charm
We are satisfied the Government and its
agents desire to give the people all possi-
ble mail facilities, but the people owe it to
themselves to make some effort to eet their
nost offices and mail routes ooened.

in our political affairs, and the approaching
months of the Congressional session are
pregnant with results. The people are
literally blind-folded in afield beset with
dangers, and it is in great part their own
fault. We urge them to make one more
effort, and a dozen efforts, until they get
their mails.

in regard to the disposition of the Radical
Congressmen toward the "Rebel States."
In his dispatch of the 29th ult. he says:
"So far as the views of Congressmen pre

a disposition to give the Rebel States a
reasonable time to show the course they
are determined to pursue regarding the

then to legislate regarding them as if they
