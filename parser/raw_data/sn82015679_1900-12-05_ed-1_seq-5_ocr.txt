NEW YORK. Dec. 4. John. Armstrong
Chanler, former husband of Amelle Rives,
who has been confined in Bloomingdale
Asylum at White Plains, has escaped and
is supposed to be "wandering about the
country in Westchester county. Mr. Chan
ler has been confined in Bloomingdale Asy
lum sinco February, 1S37. He had the free
run of the grounds and could como and go
at will, as he was looked on as a harmless
patient. Dr. Lyon, the superintendent of
the institution, said to-day that a careful
fearch was "being made for the missing man
and that he had no doubt but that he
would be found within twenty-four hours.
He was last seen walking towards Mamro
neek. Chänlcr was well known in this country
nd I'urope as ilrst husband of the Princess
Troubetzkoy, formerly Miss Amelle Rives,
tne authoress. Overcome by anxiety,
harassed by business annoyance to which
he was unaccustomed and disappointed
because of his wife's second marriage,
Mr. Chanltr's health broke down. His
mind became so enfeebled that his friends
decided to place him in the. asylum, where
he could have absolute quiet. For more
than a year previous to the time he en
tered the asylum Mr. Chanler had been
eccentric. His chief delusion seemed to be
that he was a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde.

TROTTING BOARD MEETS.
Considers a' dumber of Appeals
Asaiiitt Fines and Other Penalties.
NEW YORK, Dec. 4. Members of the
National Trotting Association, to the num
ber of a score or more, met at the Murray
Hill Hotel, where they will be in session
for several days. President P. P. Johnson,
of Lexington, Ky., was chairman. The first
work of the day was the taking of testi
mony in the matter of disputed and con
tested races during- the last season, cases
of entering horses out of class, the matter
of fines and expulsions or suspensions from
the association of horses and their owners,
and the matter of reinstatement of their
horses having been under suspension for a
greater or less length of time. The mem
bers of the board present were P. P. John
son, of Lexington. Ky., president; W. II.
Goeher, of Hartford, Conn., secretary; C.
D. Palmer, of Lowell, Mass.; George W.
Archer, Rochester; William Russell Allen,
Plttsfield, Mass.; David Bonner and John
II. Shults. of New York, and E. C. Blake,
of Cedar Rapids, la.
The board ruled against John Kopp &.
Bro. In the case of their mare Jean In
gelow, which they had entered as having no
mark, when she had made a record to
wagon before their purchase, though with
out their knowledge.
Application for a refund of a line of $x0
against the Louisville Driving Association
for failure to report fines and suspensions
made in 1S09 was refused.
No decision was reached in Harry Dev
creaux's appeal on tho ownership of a pri
vate record made on the Cleveland track in
a private trial, not for money or trophy.
The board refused to reinstate James
O'Brien, alias James Reed, expelled for re
fusal to drive a horse at Baltimore after his
name had been changed.
The board awarded to the mare Garnet,
which was alleged to have raced and won
under the name of Foxy S., the purses won
by her during the season. She is owned by
Vernon Miller. George W. Brown, of
Greenfield, who had been temporarily re
instated, had his reinstatement made per
manent. H. A. Pennock, of Minerva, O.,
was expelled for "ringing."
o Decisions at Chicago.
CHICAGO, Dec. 4. Tho Board of Review
of the American Trotting Association be
gan its annual Chicago meeting to-day and
will continue in session several days. The
only cases of interest to-day were one in
which the Cleveland pacer. Octagon, record
2:'X4, was the central figure, and the mat
ter of the pacing race between Anaconda
and Searchlight at the Indiana state fair.
In September last. The charge against Oc
tagon was that the horse had been driven
In a race by a man who had been expelled
from the association.
In the Searchlight-Anaconda matter the
contract between the managers of the
horses and the Indiana State Board of Ag
riculture was submitted, together with an
answer by the board to the application for
an ordT that the second money in the race
be paid to Searchlight, ilrst money having
already gone to him by virtue of the fact
that he distanced Anaconda In the race.
The board took both cases under advise
ment, will consider them in executive ses
sion and render a decision later in the
week.

CHICAGO, Dec. 4. In less than two

B. Dunton. formerly auditing clerk of tho
Union National Bank, was to-day found
guilty of the embezzlement of $15,5o0. Sen
tence was not pronounced. The defense
offered no evidence in the case. Dunton
was an Intimate friend of Assistant Teller
George Forbes, of the First National
Bank, the two having worked together in
the Union National before its absorption
by the First National. Forbes committed
suicide some months ago. His books showed
a discrepancy in his accounts, and It was
learned that despondency over this short
age, which was caused by Forbes loaning
money to Dunton on the latter's promise
that he would repay It, drove him Into tak

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. The annual re
port of Lyman J. Gage, secretary of the
treasury, was sent to the speaker of the
House of Representatives to-day. The re
port is an elaborate review of the financial
operations of the government for the fiscal
year ending June CO, 1000. Besides, it covers
receipts and expenditures, coins and coin
age, engrossing and printing, public moneys,
national banks, loans and currency, cus
toms and the work of all the bureaus con

The secretary says the revenues of the
government from all sources for the fiscal
year ended June 3J, 190), were JC.59Ö, 431.13,
whllo the expenditures for the same period
were 0,008,371, leaving a surplus of $79,

Continuing the secretary says: "Tho
treasurer calls attention to the marked
irregularity in the receipts and expendi
tures, pointing out that while in July, IS)?,
there was a deficiency of $8.5C6.S32.2S, in
June, 1900, a surplus of $17,895,1 5S.S6 was
realized. The greatest difference between
income and outgo on any one day was
$1.047.396.05 in favor of the treasury. The
corresponding maximum deficit ncy was
$2,318.621.42. In the face of such wide fluc
tuations the necessity for ample available
reserves is apparent, and the treasurer
names $50,000.000 as a proper sum to keej.
in the government vaults."
CHANGES IN CIRCULATION. ,
After giving the salient points of the an
nual reports of the treasurer and the con
troller of the currency (published some
time ago) Secretary Gage says:
"The changes in the amounts of the sev
eral kinds of money In the United States
outside the treasury between Nov. 1, 1S99,
and Nov. 1. 1900. are shown in the table
following. The estimated population of the
United States Nov. 1. 1S99. was 76,6.t9.0i0. and
the per capita supply of money outside
the treasury was $25.00. The estimated
population and per capita supply of money
Nov. 1. 190. were 76.S9l.000 and J27.S2,
respectively:

"The estimated population of the Unite!
States. 76,S31,0o0, is based on the census of
1100. The estimate for Nov. 1. 1S99, was
based on the census of 1S90, and was about
1.400,000 in excess of the real population.
The correction of this estimate, together
with the increase during the year in the
voiurae'of money in circulation, increases
the estimated circulation per capita from
J.v.a cs it wa stated in the report for 1S99,
to $27.32. Nov. 1. liu).
"On Nov. 21 the secretary gave public
notice that refunding would be indefinitely
suspended at the close of business on Dec.
31, 19O0. The considerations which Induced
this action may be briefly stated:'
"First Nine months will have elapsed
1
since the passage, of the refunding act.
Thus the holders of bonds will have had
abundant opportunity to make the ex
change authorized.
"SecondTo leave the privilege open in
definitely Is simply to give a continuing
option to bondholders without any sufficient
consideration to the treasury. .
"Third It may be fairly assumed that
with this privilege discontinued at the close
of the year, refunding In the meantime will
bo stimulated, and that the total refunding
to that date will approximate $400,000,000.
"Fourth The sinking-fund law contem
plates the retirement of the interest-bearing
public debt, either bj payment or pur
chase of substantially $50,000,000 per an
num. "Fifth The refunding of J 100,000.000 will
leave outstanding and maturing within the
next eight years, say, 5139.000,000, or an
average of something more than SO.OOO.O'j'J
per year.
"The secretary believes that the suspen
sion of the refunding process will put the
maturing debt under better conditions (the
government's Interest alone considered)
either for purchase from time to time or for
payment when due. It will, of course, re
main open for the department to resume
refunding, should the Interests of the gov
ernment and the general conditions of
finance make such a course desirable.
REDUCTION OF REVENUE.
"From the estimates of receipts and ex
penditures for the fiscal year 1302 there
promises to be an excess of receipts to the
amount of $26,000.000. It Is hardly necessary
to point out that estimates are at best ap
proximate. Exigencies in the public serv
ice which cannot be anticipated may re
quire expenditures not contemplated. Con
gressional appropriations, extraordinary in
character, or failures to realize fully esti
mated revenues, are also Influences which
may operate seriously to derange all ad
vance calculations. A conservative margin
should, therefore, be reserved in forecasting
definite results based on hypothetical cal
culations. "An annual excess of receipts over expen
ditures is the best indorsement of the na
tional credit, while a deficit Is a depressing
factor in public finance. It has been our
wise policy in the past to reduce the public
debt in time of peace, and to this good pol
icy may be attributed, to a high degree, the
low rates of interest, hitherto unprecedent
ed, which now attach to our government
debt obligations. It is true that for a
period of six year?, from 1SD4 to 1S99, in
clusive, annual deficits appeared; but it
may be hoped that this was a temporary
Interruption to a history of twenty-eight
3rears, when each year showed annual ex
penditures less than annual revenues.
"The operation of the act of Feb. 23,
1S62, providing for a sinking fund, contem
plates the payment or purchase and can
cellation of substantially $50,000.000 annu
ally of our interest-bearing debt obliga
tions. Owing to the unfavorable conditions
in the treasury during" the six years just
referred to, the sinking fund was entirely
neglected.
"In the absence of any expression to the
contrary. It may be safely assumed that It
it,- the desire of Congress to observe faith
fully the general requirements of the sink
ing fund act and to provide revenue suffi
cient to meet the charges thus imposed
upon the government. The present and
prospective easy condition of the treasury
Justifies the belief that the fclnking fund
requirement can be met, both for the cur
rent fiscal year and for the next fiscal year,
and still permit a moderate reduction In
taxes imposed by the war revenue act. A
reduction to the amount of $30,000,000 is
therefore recommended to the consideration
of the present Congress.
STANDARD AND CURRENCY.
"The operation of the act of March 14
last with respect to these two important
matters of our finances has well exem
plified its wisdom." Confidence in the pur
pose and power of the government to
maintain the gold standard 1 has been
greatly strengthened. The result is that
gold flows toward the treasury instead of
away from it. At the date of this report
the free gold In the treasury is larger
In amount than at any former period in
our history. Including the $150,000,000 re
serve, the gold in the treasury belonging
to the government amounts to over $242,
000,000, while the treasury holds, besides,
more than $230,000,000, against which cer
tificates have been issued.
"That provision of the act which liberal
ized the conditions' of bank note issue was
also wise and timely. Under it, as pre
viously shown in7 this report, there has
been an increase of some $77,000,000 in bank
note issues. To this may be chiefly at
tributed the freedom from stress for cur
rency to handle the large harvests of cot
ton, wheat and corn. In this respect the
year has been an exception to the general
rule of stringency which for several years
has so plainly marked the autumn season.
"Nevertheless, the measures referred to,
prolific as they have been in good results,
will yet need reinforcement in some im
portant particulars. Thus, as to the re
demption fund provided for in said act.
while the powers conferred upon the sec
retary are probably ample to enable a
zealous and watchful officer to protect
fully the gold reserve, there appears to be
lacking sufficient mandatory requirement
to furnish complete confidence In the con
tinued parity, under all conditions, be
tween our two forms of metallic money,
silver and gold. Upon this point further
legislation may become desirable.
"As to the currency, while the liberaliz
ing of conditions has, as previously noted,
found response In a necessary increase of
baoik note issues, there is under our pres
ent system no assurance whatever that
the volumo of bank currency will be con
tinuously responsive to the country's
needs, either by expanding as such needs
require or by contracting when superflu
ous in amount. The truth is that, safo
and desirable as Is our currency system
In many respects. It Is not properly re
lated. The supply of currency is but re
motely, if at all. influenced by the ever-
chaneinfr requirements of trade and In
dustry. It Is related most largely, if not
entirely, to the price of government bonds
in the market. Between the needs of
trade and commerce for a medium of ex
change and for instruments of credit,
which a proper bank note furnishes, and
the investment price or value of govern
ment bonds, which is at present the most
influential factor in determining the cur
rency supply, there is no discernible rela
tion whatever.
"I forbear at this time. In view of the
many other Important subjects which de
mand attention during the present short
session of Congress, to press these ques
tions for immediate action, but I cannot
refrain from inviting the attention of sen
ators and representatives to a careful con
sideration of the matters thus suggested.
In the act of March 14 a forward step was
taken, to the great benefit of. all our ma
terial interests. Nothing should prevent
timely and well-considered amendments
where necessary to solidify and complete
the work so well inaugurated."

Catarrh
The cause exists in the blood, in
what causes inflammation of the
mucous membrane.
It is therefore impossible to cure
the disease by local applications.
It is positively dangerous to neg
lect it, because it alwajs affects
the stomach and deranges the gen
eral health, and it is likely to de
velop into consumption.
Many have been radically and permanently
cured by Hood's Sarsaparilla. It cleanses tho
blood and has a peculiar alterative and tonic
effv?ct. It. Long, California Junction, Iowa
writes: "1 had catarrh three years, lost my ap
petite and could not sleep. My head pained
me and I felt bad all over. I took Hood's Sar
eaparilla and now have a good appetite, sleep
well, and have no symptoms of catarrh."
Hood's Sarsaparilla
Promises to. cure and keeps the
promise. It is better not to put off
