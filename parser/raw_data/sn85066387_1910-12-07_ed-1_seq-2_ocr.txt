for th*» captain to visit during the
voyage. I also fall to see the necessity
for this imprisonment. There / were
pomp five or six hundred Chinese on the
ship and 5t would have been the sim
plest thins In the -world for the whole
IS to have mingled with the other
Asiatic passengers. It is true that at
frequent Intervals' during the voyage
we mustered t!s Asiatic passengers for
the doctor to look them over. We also
mustered the Chinese crew. When the
passengers were mustered the crew was
below and vice versa, so you can see
that there -would have been no dif
ficulty at all In concealing from the
•hip's officers th© fact that there- were
15 Chinese stowaways on board.
"If they were kept as you say they
c!a.!r3 the room or locker must show it
and if such a state of affairs was dis
covered the matter has not been re
ported to me."
FIRST EXPOSLRE
"William Chlsholm. marine superin
tendent cf the Pacific Mail company,
said last night that he could not think.
of any place on the ship where the
women could have been so shut In and
lived to tell the tale.
"On some trips," he said, "it might
have been possible, but this time the
eh!p was so chock full of freight that
practically *very inch of space, not
needed for passengers was filled with
cargo. If there is such a place it
wouldn't tell us much if we found It.
A thing like this couldn't have been
carried out without assistance from
the crew and whoever is responsible,
if they really did come over on the
Manchuria, would take good care to
have the place cleaned out \u25a0 just as
quickly as they got rid of the stow
aways."
Edsell, however, who spent all of
yesterday listening to the tales of the
girls who had suffered, believes that
they spoke the truth and knows that
they are not the first Chinese girls
who have crossed the Pacific under sim
ilar conditions. It has been known for
a long time that Chinese men and
women were being smuggled Into the
country, -but this is the first time that
the ring's methods of operation have
been exposed.
SLAVES WORTH S3-OCO
Collector of the Port Frederick S.
Ptratton stated yesterday that he felt
certain some of the customs inspectors
were implicated in the attempt at
smuggling the orientals ashore, and
that just as soon as the guilty ones
were determined they would be sum
marily dismissed from the service.
Stratum stated that big bribes were
known to be always awaiting con- 1
scienceless inspectors, especially where
the smuggling ashore of Chinese women
was concerned. Thew omen, who be
come the slaves of Chinatown, bring
down a price to the lucky "owner" of
53,000 apiece.
Purveyor Charles H. Blinn expects to
receive and has requested from Com- i
missioner Steward a full report stat
ing the manner in which the escape
was effected from the steamer. As soon 1
as the details are ascertained Blinn
will confer with Stratton and other of
ficoails lor the purpose of deciding who

HEALTH OFFICERS TO
WATCH IMMIGRANTS
Stricter Quarantine Laws Are
Favored by Doctor Kuser %
[Special Dispatch lo The Call]
SAN RAFAEL, Deo. 6. — "Immigration
from tho disease infected districts and
cities of Europe should be checked en
tirely until foreign officials can give
emigrants a clean bill of health," said
Ur. J. H. Kuser, county health officer,
on the receipt of communications from
the' state board of health directing him
to keep watch on the health of all im
misrrar.ts in this district.
"At present." he continued, "it is the
custom of the immigrant Inspectors to
keep immigrants in quarantine 10 days.
United States officials co-operate with
foreign officials at European ports and
hold the immigrants five days. When
they reach Aemrica they are held five
days longer. The time is not sufficient.
A contagious disease may break out in
the subject after 10 days."
At the recent convention of county
health/ officers of California at San
Diego Doctor Kuser and others advo
cated a general reform,, which they will
place before the state legislature. This
leform embraces a reorganization by
which the county health officers will
Jiave control of their own districts.

JEFFREY OPPOSES
JAPANESE LABOR
Address Before Fruit Growers
Urges Need of Greater In*

[Special Dispatch to The Call]
STOCKTON, Dec. C— Supplementing
his address with the statement that
Japanese were taking'the places of the
California fruit growers and admon
ishing the latter to take greater inter
est In the industry, Jresident J. W.
Jeffer'y opened the thirty-eighth Cal
ifornia state fruit growers' convention
this morning. -
•The state commissioner of horticul
ture laid particular emphasis upon his
statement concerning the grip taken
by the Japanese and declared that tt
behooved the fruit growers to take
more interest in the greatest of Cali
fornia' sindustries.
This statement and the address by
Judge. N. P. Chipman of Sacramento,
In which he predicted great things for
Stockton and pointed out the remark
able development of the San Joaquin
valley, were striking features of the
day's session.
Thursday will be the. big day of the
convention, as it will be devote dto the
subject of standardization, the topic in
which the greatest interest is taken by
the delegates.
President Jeffrey called the conven
tion to order at 10 o'clock at the Con
gregational church.
WELCOMED BY MAYOR
Rev. John Stephens of the Central
Methodist church pronounced the in
vocation, after which Mayor R. R. Rei
benstein delivered the 'address of .wel
come, lr\ which he said:
The. fruit industry of the state
has shown wonderful development
in the last decade and has been one
of the important factors in giving .
to California an increased popula
tion of more than 60 per cent dur
. ing the last 10 years. \u25a0'".
A few years ago large l tracts of
land which are now devoted to
grape's, fruit and berries were
either barren or devoted exclusive
ly to the production of grain.
Blessed as we are with a fine soil, a
climate that is unexcelled, the fruit
industry has turned these grain
fields Into a garden, but the indus
try is only in its infancy, and you
must consider how this infant can
be wrought into a vigorous man
hood.
JUDGE PRAISES STOCKTOX
Judge N. P. Chipman of the district
court of appeals, responded to the
mayor and said:
I have in the past years looked
upon Stockton as the largest em
porium in the interior of the state.
Logically there is no reason why
Stockton should not be the great
est commercial center outside of
San Francisco and the bay cities.
We hear a great deal now days
about the gateway city. Stockton
has been called the gateway city
and other cities* have claimed the
same distinction. I will state, g
however, that Stockton justly
makes such claim.
I am a resident of Sacramento j
and am loyal to my city. At pres
ent Sacramento is looming up in .
fine style and is greatly in advance
of Stockton. I believe that is due
to the people who have awakened
and have encouraged manufactures \u25a0
. to locate there.
The location of Stockton Is with
out doubt . superior to any other'
city outside of San Francisco, and \u25a0
if you don't ?ro to the front it is
your own fault; m ~
I agree with you. Mr. Mayor, in
your statement that the fruit in
dustry is the diminant industry of •
the state. This organization be
gan in 1882. During those early
days there were -very few fruit
growers and wheat was king.' In
1900 the state shipped out 16,000
carloads, of ten tons, of the prod
ucts of the orchards and gardens.
Today we are shipping out 100,000
carloads. -
ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT
The forenoon - session was closed
with the address by President J. W.
Jeffrey, who said in part:
Since I last addressed the annual
convention at Watsonville we have
had one year of adventure in the'
standardization of deciduous fruits,
and two counties have reorgan
ganized for the coming year. - In
this work we have applied some
new economic principles, or" at'
least, revived some old half for
gotten principles that may seem
novel in their application to the
fruit trade. . . •
Did it ever occur to the mem
bers of this convention that Cal
ifornia Is under special moral ob
ligations to send an honest and
uniform fruit pack? All will ad
mit t.hat It pays to do so. but in
our case both moral obligation and
self interest join In the new plan
of improving the fruit: pack, and
I can not see why, under these
circumstances, it should be neces
sary to agitate a matter so conclu
sively established. But it is nec
essary, for out of over three dozen
meetings held in deciduous fruit
counties only five of. these counties
adopted standardization.
As we approach the relationship
of standardization to over produc
tion, I think the subject deserves a.
side, remark upon competition in
the fruit business— justified also by
purposes of this convention, for, we
are not here to consider solely the
methods whereby we . can. grow
more and better fruits. Cultural
matters in horticulture have "been
given relatively too ' much atten
tion — relatively, I say,, because it
follows Inevitably that the elimin
ation of dishonest and destructive
competition in" the > production of
fruits by raising the standards will
do more for better- horticulture
than all other influences combined.
Our subject here "swallows itself
and winks with great agility/Mike
Barnum's famous snake, for how
\can we: advance standardization

ucts of ignorant and inefficient

JHE: SAN FRANCISCO^
horticulture that are flooding the
markets and have their origin so
largely In the orchards that are
planted merely to sell otherwise
unsalable land? This is what I •
mean by unfair competition in the
fruit business.
"It is useless to preach, unless
one lives up to his pronounce
ments. And this" Is Just what hun- j
dreds of, growers are attempting
to do in standardizing their fruits, j
And it is in line with one of the '
chief policies of the^office which I
represent. Those progressive
growers have not ceased to edxj- I
cate themselves toward the prac- <
tice of better cultural metlrods.
But they have gone - futher- and
have tried to substantially Drotect
the results of better orchard prac
tice by adopting a. system that
eliminates unfit and worthless
qualities of fruit. They are putting
into practice the admonitions that
have heretofore been' noticed. only
in the pdeaching. They have tried
in a most practical way to elevate
and make uniform the quality. 1
and the retailing value \
and convenience of selling our
orchard products.
The effect of standardization is
fourfold. First, it excludes all fruit
unfit for profitable trade, and thus
discourages overproduction: second, \u25a0
it increases the demand for. Cali
fornia fruits, and thus makes dis
. tribution wider, more certain and
less in cost of selling; third, it pro
tects and stimulates the grower of
good fruits and makes his land
more valuable by eliminating from
competition lands and fruits of no -«
value; fourth, it enforces better
horticultural practices, -and thus
gives dignity and distinction to an
occupation that is now thought by
many to be of such a low order that
anybody can follow it successfully.
It will help to bring back the right
kind of fruit growers to the land.
NEED FOR CLEAN HANDS
As every new Industrial move
ment must be measured by its
financial success, I will leave that I
subject also to those who have
adopted the standardization plan. '
-Four counties will report upon that ff
subject on Thursday. Let us now
as briefly as possible discuss the
morals and consistencies of fruit
merchandising. The signs of the
timers indicate that the public at
large is being driven by self pro
tection and self respect to enforce
honesty and square dealing in
the monetary and mercantile trans
actions of the country. Upright
ness of dealing, whether involving
the purity -of a food or the probity
of a gigantic deal in stocks;
whether manipulating a false meas
ure in selling molasses or mahlpu- ,
lating fraudulent corner in con
trolling the necessities of life or
what not — uprightnes sof dealing
is the greatest issue of modern
times.
The stability of our very institu- ,
tions demand that the average man
t be given a chance for his life. But
he must make himself worthy of
the square deal. He must come
with clean hands to his
rights. If he "deacons" his ap
ples, places a false bottom in his .
milk measure or hides little, meas
ly peaches .in the center of the box
faced with first class fruit, can he
demand with a clear conscience
that the corporations cease to op
press him or that bribery and graft
cease to absorb his hard earned
, tax money. -r v \u25a0-\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0.
FRUIT AND TARIFF REVISIOX
•\u25a0' There is at' present a great and
increasing determination to revise
the tariffs upon the basis of the
