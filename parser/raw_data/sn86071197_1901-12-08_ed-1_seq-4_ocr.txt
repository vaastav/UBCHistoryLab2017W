Alcohol and u edlolnes containing It are
temporary stimulants and not lu any sense
u true tonK In fact It Is doubtful If any
metlli Ine or drug Is a real tonic
A tree tonic Is something which will re

To cure Indigestion and stomach troubles
It Is necessary to take after meals some
harmless preparation which will supply the

One ot two of these excellent tableta
