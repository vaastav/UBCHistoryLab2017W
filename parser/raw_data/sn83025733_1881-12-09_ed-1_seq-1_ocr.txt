National Cotton rinntcrs' Association.
Atlanta, December 8. Tho National
Cotton Planter' Association continued in
session to-day and transacted its regular
business. F. C. Xforehead was re-elected
President, George M. Kline, Treasurer, and
James N. Ogden, Secretary. United States
Commissioner of Agriculture George
II. Loring delivered an address on tho
'Mutual Relation of American
lndudtries," in tho course of
which he said' " The relution existing
between the cotton plantation and the mar
ket created by American manufacture is
deeply interesting to this association, which
represent that great branch of agricul
ture. 1 learn from the cotton movement
and regulations compiled by It.
P. Saltlg, a member of the
New York Cotton Exchange, that of the

ing the fuel that the lor of cotton sold In
the English ntarkct is nearly two cent per

In IssO Hl In Liverpool was lUs-lnO 'pence
und In New York 11 34-1W cent per

market being nearly two cents a pound to
the producer. This important relation will
continue to increase its value as American
manufacture extends and the home market
is enlarged, and will undoubedly prodme
an iiu-reusa in tho average vield of cotton

in the crop ot the cotton States, allowanci's
being made for difference in climate. This
will lead to a wide diversity of funning,
which will be adopted, and will do much to

OuIUbii's Trial.
Washington, December 8. The court
room again was densely packed. Mrs. Julia
If. Wilson, of I.eadville, Colorado, was the
first witness. She testitled I S'. (luiteau
was her uncle unit she kneWhini from her
earliest recollection. She gave u most feel
ing account of the life und character of
her mother, Mrs. Muvnard, who, it had
been alleged, by the defense, had died in
sane, and who died from pneumonia in
1SC6. Witness was her constant attendant
up to her death and never saw the slightest
indication of Mightiness or insanity.
Guiteau, during the examination of the
witness, became greatly excited and it
terrupted the testimony several times.
At the conclusion of the examination
General C. Maynard was called, and corrob
orated portions of the testimony, and the
court took recess for half an hour.
Several witnesses Were examined, ull of
whom had known Guiteau ill the
West and ' in llnston and none
evsr supposed him insane, though all
thought him lin king iu moral character.
Rev. II. S. McAnhur. pastor of Calvary
Buptist Church, New York, testilied that
Guiteau had been a member of his church
and bad been cited befom tho congregation
for immoral conduct. This witness testi
mony irritated Gnitvuu greatly.
Scoville objected to the ad
mission of this testimony, when
the District Attorney announced
his object was to demonstrate that whut de
fendant calls insanity is nothing more than
devilish depravity.
Questions were put to President Arthur,
and his answers were put in evidence us
follows :
"Do you know the prisoner in this case?"
"Yes."
"How many limes and where did you
ever see him?1'
"I have seen him at least ten times, and
possibly as often as twenty times altogether,
mostly iu and about the rooms
of the Republican Slate . Com
mitee in tho olh Avenue hotel, New
York city, in tho fall of lf.0,
and two or three times in tho streets of
Washington, in the spring of 181,"
"What conversation, if any, did vou ever
have with him?"
"None, excepting to return tho ordinrry
salutations of the day und once or twice in
answer to his request to bo em
ployed in tho campaign as a
speaker by tho Republican State
Committee, of which I was Chairman."
"What services, if ony, did the prisoner
render to the Republican party during the
last Presidential campaign?"
"None that I know ol."
"Was there ever anything to your knowl
edge iu his relations to 'yourself or
to General Grant or to Senator
Logan, or to any other leader of. the
Republican party, socially or politically, to
furnish a shadow for a reasonable claim on
bis part of political preferment?"
"No."
"Did you or not give him any reason to
think that he had or could have any politi
cal or personal inllumicc with you?"
"I never did. I have been requested by
tho counsel for tho defense to pro
duce a letter written ly tho prisoner
and endorsed to me by hi counsel since his
indictment. That letter was re
ceived by me in tho mouth of Oc
tober hist, . but was not preserved,
1 do not .remember its contents partic
ularly, excepting that it contulned some
claim to have rendered important services
to the Republican party in the Presidential
campaign anil an appeal fur a postponement
of his trial to give him time to prepare his
defense."
