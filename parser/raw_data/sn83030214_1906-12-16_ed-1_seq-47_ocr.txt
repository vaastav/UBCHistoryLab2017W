"He wasn't like hlsself that night up at «he Cau
liflower. 'B sat up in the corner and wouldn't
take any notice of anybody, and. It was easy to see
as ho was thoroughly ashamod of hlsself.
" 'Cheer up. Job,' bcs Bill Chambers, at last;
•you ain't the fust man as has made a fool of hls
self.'
" 'Mind your own business,' ees Job Brown, 'and
I'll mind mine.'
" 'Why don't you leave 'im alone, Bill?' pcs Hen
ery 'White; 'you can see the man ls worried be-
CMM the baby can't talk.'
" 'Oh!' ses Bill, 'I thought *c was worried be
cause 'Is wife could.'
"All the chaps, except Job, that 13. laughod at
that; but Job 'c got up and punched the table, end
asked whether there was anybody ag would like to
go outside with him for five minutes. Then 'c sat
down again and paid *ard things acln the drink
which 'ad made 'im the larflng Btock of all the
fools In Claybury.
" 'I'm going to give It up. Smith,' -he sea.
" 'Yes, I know you are,' ses Smith.
" 'If I could on'y lose the taste of It for a time I
could give It up,' ses Job. wiping 'is mouth, 'and
to prove I'm In earnest I'll glvo five pounds to any
body asH prevent me tasting intoxicating likcra
for a month.'
" 'You may as well savo your breath to bid peo
ple "good night" with. Job/ pcs 15111 Chambers;
'you wouldn't pay up if anybody did keep you
off It.'
"Job swore honor bright ho would, but nobody
believed 'lm, and at last ho called for pen and Ink
and wrote it all down on a sheet o' paper and
signed it. and then ho got two other chaps to sign
it as witnesses.
"Bill Chambers wasn't satisfied then. He pointed
out that earning the five pounds and then getting
It out o' Job Brown orterwarda was two such en
tirely different things that there was no likeness
between 'em at all. Then Job Brown cot bo mad
'c didn't know wot 'c was doing, and 'o 'anded over
fivo pounds to Smith, the landlord, and wrote on
the paper that he was to give It to anybody who
should earn it. without consulting 'Im at all. Even
Bill couldn't think of anything to say agin that,
but he made a point of biting all the sovereigns.
"There waa quite a excitement for a few days.
Henery White 'c got a 'eadacho with thinking, and
Jon Gubblns *c got it 'eadache for drinking Job
Brown's beer agin. There was all sorts o" wild
ways mentioned to earn that five pounds, but they
didn't come to anything.
"Arter a week had gone by Job Brown began to
get restless like, and once or twico 'o saM In
Smith's hearing 'ow useful five pounds would be.
Smith didn't take any notice, and at last Job told
'im there didn't seem any likelihood of the five
pounds being earned, and he wanted It to buy pigs
with. The way 'c wont ■ ■■ when Smith said 'o
'adn't got the power to give it back, and \ d got
to keep it in trust for anybody as might earn it
was disgraceful,
"He used to ask Smith for it every night, and
Smith used to give Mm the same answer, until at
last Job Brown Bald he'd go an' see a lawyer about
it. That frightened Smith a bit. and I b'lieve he'd
ha* 'anded It over, buc two days arterwarda Job
was going upstairs so careful that he fell down to
the bottom anu broko 'is leg.
"It was broken In two places, and the doctor said
it would be a long job, owing to 'is drinking habits,
and 'c gave Mrs. Brown strict orders that Job
wasn't to 'aye a drop of anything, even if 'c asked
for It.
"There was a lot o' talk about it up at the Cauli
flower 'ere, and Henery White, arter a bad 'eadache,
thought of a plan by which 'c and Bill Chambers
could 'me that live pounds atween 'em. The Idea
was that Bill Chambers was to go with Hei cry to
see Job, and take 'im a bottle of beer, and jist as
Job was going to drink it Henery should knock it
out of 'Is 'ands, at the same time telling Bill Cham
bers 'c ought to be ashamed of hlsself.
"It was a good idea, and, as Henery White said.
If Mrs. Brown was in the room so much the better
as she'd be a witness. Ho made Bill swear to keep
it secret for fear of other chaps doing it arter
wards, and then they bought a bottle o' beer and
6et off up the road to Job's. The annoying part of
It was, arter all their trouble and Henery "White's
■eadache, Mrs. Brown wouldn't let 'em In. "They
begged and prayed of 'er to let 'em go up and just
'aye a peep at 'lm, but she wouldn't. She said
she'd go ■patalra and peep for 'em, and she came
down again and said that 'c was a little bit flushed,
but sleeping like a lamb.
"They went round the corner and drank the ale
Up, and Bill Chambers isaid it was a good job.
Henery thought '•' was clever, because nobody else
did. As for 'Is 'eadachep, he put 'em down to over
eating.

of them was allowed to go up, and for seven weeks

that 'c 'ad got tha start to keep it, and 'c likewise
pointed out that aa 'c had been without liquor for
over a. month, he could go and. get that five pounds

"Job promised that 'c would give It up; but the
first day 'c felt able to crawl on 'is crutches he
made up 'is mind to go up to the Cauliflower and
see whether gin and beer tasted as good as it used
to. The only thing was 'is wife might stop Mm.
" 'You're done up with nursing me, old gal,' he
ses to Ms wiie.
" 1 am a bit tired,' sea she.
"'I could see it by your eyes,' sea Job. 'What
you want ls a change, Polly. Why not go and see
your sister at Wlckham?'
" "I don't like leaving- you alone,' ses Mrs. Brown,
'else I'd like to go. I want to do a little shopping.'
" 'You go, my dear,' ses Job. 'I shall be quite
'appy sitting at the gate in the sun with a glass o*
milk an' a pipe.'
"He persuaded 'er at last, and, in a fit o' gener

with a crutch and a stick, smiling all over Ms face.
He met Dick Weed in the road and they shook

came, aiong, and by the time they got to the Cauli

"Every man 'ad a pint o' beer, which Job paid
for, not forgetting Smith Msself, and Job closed Ms

to talk about Ms accident, and Job showed 'em Ms
