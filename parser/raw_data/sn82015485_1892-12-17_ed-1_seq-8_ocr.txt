A PARTY OF PRINCIPLE.
WHY YOUNG MEN SHOULD
REPUBLICANS.
BE
Xhe Republican Becord Shows It to Be a
Party That Stands for Every Govern-
- mental Policy That Appeals to Patriot
ism. Organize for 1896.
The adherence of the educated and
intelligent young men of the nation
to Republican principles is indispen
sable to Eepublican victory in 1896.
The work of education and organiza
tion for the next Presidential cam
paign should begin at once and be
carried on with system and th6rough
ness. Few young men appreciate the tre
mendous significance of the Eepubli
can record lor the past thirty-two j
years, says the JSew York Press. They

comprehend,
that the Eepublican party saved the
nation from dissolution, crushed hu
man slavery, restored the finances
and credit ot the country, and enacted !
legislation which has resulted in an
industrial development unmatcnea
in the world's annals. What they
do not realize is the all important
fact that these grand achievements
were accomplished by the practical
application of the very 'principles held
"by the Eepublican party to-day; that
the Democracy, whose specious
pledges have won so many of their
votes, is an old foe with a new face,
whose success is a menace to the
prosperity and progress of the nation
not less dangerous than it would
have been in 1860 or 1864. Eepub
iicanism has not changed its princi
ples. Democracy has not changed its
principles. The faith of Lincoln and
Seward and Grant is still the Eepub
rmblican creed. The economic -dogmas
of John C. Calhoun and Jefferson
Davisarestill the fundamental beliefs
of the Democratic party.
Democratic orators have denied
this on the stump and Democratic
newspapers have systematically ig
nored their own platform in their
editorial columns. The prompt de
mand on the part of Democratic
organs all over the country for an
extra session of Congress and a com
plete overthrow of the protective sys
tem in accordance with the demand
tor free trade formulated at Chicago
shows the deliberate deception prac
ticed on those voters who supported
the Democratic ticket in the belief
that a moderate and careful revision
of the tariff was all that the Demo
cratic party intended. To-day the
Democracy represents the old South
ern idea that the best labor is the
cheapest labor, that the United States
should not manufacture for them
selves, but should grow corn and
pork and cotton to exchange for Eu
ropean manufactured products. The
Democratic party holds that the idea
of a vigorous, united American na
tionality is a sham, that we should
have no navy, no forts, no army, that
our flag represents nothing in partic
ular, that we should allow the monop
olists of Europe to take a mortgage
on the South American continent
and the Governments of Europe to
dictate the policy and trample on the
rights of every Spanish-American
State.
t The Eepublican party stands for
every! governmental policy that ap
pals to patriotism. It rests its case
snot on what it has done in the past,
- glorious though that past has been,
but on what it proposes to accomplish
for the American people in the fu
ture. It believes in the dignity of
jhonest labor. It holds that every
-American workingman should be paid
TOges high enough to live in comfort,
o educate his children and to pre
serve his personal independence. It
would make the laborer not a serf,
tout a sovereign. The Eepublican
party believes in the greatness and
grandeur of the United States. It
believes that the name of America
"and the flag of America should be re
spected in every quarter of the globe.
It believes that the United States
should be as independent of Europe
industry as in politics; that the
yast home market should not only be
preserved to the American people,
Tout that the immensely profitable
markets of Snanish-America should
Sbe wrested from foreign greed and
g. ?'. uj possessed by American enterprise.

That is a question with which the

The rirst Scream of the "Wildcat.
All through the recent campaign
there was a studied effort on the
part of the Democracy to cover up i
and brush aside as an unmeaning bit
oi piaLiorm ouncomoe me abate
bank money " plank. The people
would seem to have seen in the wild
cat, so conspicuously displayed by
the Eepublican press and? speakers
only a spook. The apparition was
treated as merely the ghost of a wild
beast slain bv the war, as extinct
and harmless as the veritable wild
cat of the animal kingdom. In
j pioneer
days this and other wild
beasts prowled about the cabin and
roamed the woods and prairies, cavn
ing a great deal of apprehension and
! some loss of life, but they have dis
appeared, no more to return forever.
Those, however, who thought that
the wildcat of State bank bills be
longed to the past only would do "well
to note this fact: One of the first
acts of the first Legislature to meet
after the election was to take step3
toward the carrying out of the pledge
to repeal the 10 per cent, prohibitory
tax, which would be the uncaging of
the wildcat. In the Georgia Legis
lature, just after the election, one of
the members promptly introduced a
resolution calling upon the Dem
ocracy to fulfill that repeal pledge.
Every Populist voted against it, but
it passed both houses. A Washing
ton dispatch says, in commenting
upon this fact:
There are probably a dozen bills which
have been introduced in the present
Congress for the repeal of the 10 per
cent, tax on State banks. Senators
Daniel, of "Virginia, and Vance, of
North Carolina, have been prominent
in advocating these measures.' At the
coming sessions some of these bills will
be pressed, not with the idea that they
can become laws now, but with the
purpose of pavinjr the way for wild-cat
currency when the Democrats are in
control of all the branches of the gov
ernment. It will be found that the move
ment is not confined to the South.
There is a dangerously large class of
bankers who long for a chance to
make money by issuing a quantity of
bills in accordance with some of the
many State laws still in existence
under which the old ante-war bills
were issued. According to General
Weaver's uncontradicted charge, a
committee of New York City bankers
waited on Mr. Cleveland a short time
before the election in indorsement of
that plank, and to assure themselves
that he would, if elected, sign a re
peal bill. They knew, without wait
ing on him, that President Harrison
would allow his right hand to be cut
off before he would sign any such bill.
The only hope of protection from
such a bill is in the People's party
element in the Senate, and how much
reliance can be placed upon that bul
wark is an open question. Inter
Ocean.
Call That Extra Session.
The Democratic leaders are already
in a quandary. They have appealed
to the passions of the ignorant and
have won a victory far beyond their
own expectations and they are not
happy. What they wanted was not
tariff reform, nor free trade, nor wild
cat money, but office.. They had
hoped that the Senate would have re
mained Eepublican, in which case they
could have proposed the most radical
measures to please the mass of the
party, and these being promptly
squelched by the Senate, they could
have turned to the country and have
exclaimed: "There, you see it is not
our fault! We did our best."
Now, however, the road is clear be
fore them and they must act, and
they are already at sixes and sevens
as to how they shall act The party,
led by the Southern Bridediera, clam
ors loudly for an extra session in or
der, as their leader, Henry Watter
son, said, "to uproot and rip up all
vestige of protection with every cir
cumstances of infamy." The other
party wants to go slow, to be careful
and conservative, and to do nothing
until the next Congress meets in De
cember, 1893. Now, without regard
to politics or partisanship, what is
best "for the country?
Surely to know what the definite
purpose of the Democratic party is
with regard to the tariff.
If the Democrats do not touch the
tariff till the next Congress convenes
it will be late in the spring of 1894
before they can pass any bill. This
means nearly two years of uncertainty
for the business world, and that
means an absolute stoppage of all
enterprise. No man will buy more
than his immediate needs. No man
will start a factory, okler new ma
chinery or take the slightest business
risk. No bank will dare continue
giving accommodation to such of its
customers as are manufacturers. No
j importer wili dare order goods ahead
, except on actaai orders from the
most responsible firms. A contrac-
tionof the volume of business done
will take place such as this country
has never seen before.
If the Democrats wish to avoid
precipitating an industrial panic
within nine months let them call an
extra session and let the country, the
manufacturers and importers know
exactly what they have to expect
Call that extra session.
Already the err comes tip. fro the
South for the immediate revival of

Democracy declared in its platform
this year that the national banks
must go, and the Southern agitators
are determined that it shall keep its
word.
A Modern Belisarius.
An ex-soldier writing" to the Chica
go Inter Ocean, says:
Belisarius was the greatest general of
the Byzantine Empire. m At the age of 25
he won a great victory over the Per
sians and crushed a rebellion against
Justinian. At 28 he conquered Carthage
and carried away captive the Vandal
king. He defended Bome for a year
against the entire power of the Goths,
captured Eavenna, and with it the
Gothic king. So great was his skill and
heroism that the Ostrogoths wished to
acknowledge him "Emperor of the "West."
His loyalty to Justinian never waverea.
He led Justinian's army .in five more
campaiens against the Goths. His own
country being invaded and overrun by
the Northern barbarians he was called
upon to organize art army and drive
thenl back into their own countries.
This he did, and as a reward for this and
other historic achievements Justinian
conGscated the old hero's property and
threw him into prison. Ho was finally
released fiom prison, but his eyes were
put out and fiom that time until his
death he wandered sightless and home
less through tho country that he had
spent his life in defending.
Belisarius is a true symbol of the Re
publican party. The cartoonist should
use his picture instead of the ele
.phant. The Republican party commenced its
career by crushing out a rebellion
against its sovereign the people. It
released and set free 5,000,000 prisoners
of state held for life competing with the
laborers and mechanics of the country.
It crave the people, for the first time in
I the history of the country, a sound, sta
ble currency, as good as gold, it has
stood like a wall between the workmen
of the United States and the almost
pauper labor of the over-crowded coun
tries of England. It has raised up and
organized new fields of industry for the
people. It has given such prosperity to
the country as no other nation in all
history can show. It has compelled
the respect of all foreign countries.
And now, while engaged in completing
the crowning work ot establishing the
commercial independence, its sovereign
the people has stripped it of all
power, and cast it out as unworthy of
confidence as a reward for its heroism
and fidelity.
The sovereign people have chosen that
political giant, that intellectual microbe,
that malignant defamer of the soldier,
to succeed the soldier statesman; and a
political assassin in stead of one of tho
. ablest diplomates of the day.
Mr. Cleveland never loses an oppor
tunity to show dishonor to the soldier of
the Inion. never a chance to exalt one
who fought against the Union. The
people's indorsement of Mr. Cleveland
dishonors every man who wore the
"blue," living and dead. Sons have dis
honored their fathers who gave up their
lives for the country. Treason is ex
alted and loyalty is an illusion.
Belisarius is stripped of all power. It
only remains to assume the payment of
the Confederate bonds and ho is sight
less. An old, blind, battle-scarred vet
eran, the by-word of nations, a subject
for the sneers of all the outcasts which
the slums of Europe have vomited upon
our shores.
Cowards or What?
The Democratic party has a dilem
ma before it from which there is no
escape. If the Democratic press and
orators have told the truth, then it
is the obvious duty of the party to
rescue the country from the evils in
which Democrats say the nation has
been plunged under Eepublican rule.
To shirk such an obvious duty would
be cowardice baser than that of a
runaway from the field of battle.
Assuming that the men who made
gross charges against the Eepublican
party are not a set of knaves, then it
is to be presumed that they believed
what they said to be true. If they
believed it to be true, they would be
guilty of despicable treachery not
to right the wrongs they allege to
exist.
The Eepublican party turns over
the country, as it not only believes
but knows, happy, prosperous, and
flourishing. From the 4th of March
next the Democrats will be in abso
lute control. For any changes for
the worse that party will be responsi
ble. The Democracy has declared
its ability to make changes for the
better. Let it try, or else confess
that the late election was carried by
fraud, bunco, and falsehood, une
qualed even in the annals of Demo
cratic campaigning.
By General Consent.
It seems to be a matter of general
newspaper consent that Mr. Harrison
will leave the presidential chair with
out a stain on his official life. He
has universal respect. His formal
state papers are in an elevated strain,
while his public speeches have gone
on record as unsurpassed in thought
and diction by any predecessor. He
has filled a difficult position with dig
nity and ability. He will retire with
the respect and admiration of the best
men in all political parties. North
western Christian Advocate.
Should Be Held to Its Fledges.
The Democracy should keep its
pledges. If protection is a fraud we
want to know it. If the Democracy
has been lying, as we believe it has,
we want to know it, too, without de
lay. The Democratic party has never
been honest with the people yet. We
want it to be wholly so now. Toledo

to mt that the general conditions affecting the
commercial and industrial interests of the
United States are in the highest degree faror

'with thos3 of the most faro; able period in the
history of the country Trill. I belieTo, show that
eo hih a degree ot prosperity and so general a
diffusion of the comforts of life were nerer be
fore enjoyed by our people
The president then gives statistical statements
of the country's wealth an J adds :
The new industrial plants established since
October 6, 1830, and up to October 22, 1892,
number 45, andthe extension of existing plants
108 ; the new capital invested amounts to $40,
449,050, and the number of additional employes
to 37,233.
During the first six months of the present cal
endar year, 1..5 new factories wera built, of
which lort are cotton mil s, forty-eight knit
ting mills, twenty-six wolen mills, fifteen silk
mills, four plush mills and two linen mills. Of
the forty cotton mills, twenty-one have been
built in tho to jthern sta'es.
The total yaluo of our foreign trade, exports
and mau'actures during tho last fiscal year
was $l,"-57,foO,blO, an increase of WIB.263,604 over
the previous fecal year. 'Iho averaga annual
alue of our impons and exp rts of merchandise
for the ten fiscal yoais prior to K91, was 1,457,
322,019. It wilt be observed that onr foreign trade for
1892 exceeded tins anneal average valuo by $100,
358.391. an increase of 27.41 percent. Tho sig
nificance and value of this increase is shown by
tho fpet that tho oscess in the trade of 1J92 over
4S91 was who'ly in the aiue of exports, for
there was a docreaso ,n the valuo of imnorta of
$17,5r,254.
The vessel tonnage 'passing through the St.
Mary's canal for the fiscal year 1S92 amounted to
9,823,874 tons, and the freight, tonnage of the De
troit river is estimated for that year at 25,000,000
tens against 23, 209,019 tens in lful. The aggre
gate traffic on our railroads for the year 1691
amounted to 7UV$ VjO) tons of freight, compared
with (391,344,437 tons in 1&0, an increase of 13,
054.172 tons: while the total tonnage of the ports
of London and Liverpool during 1890 was but
24.422,53s tons.
The number of depositors in savings banks in
creased from 697.87U in 1EG0 to 4,258,893 in 1690, an
increase of 513 per cent, and the amount of depos
its from$191,277,B04 in 1800 to $1,524,814,508 in 1890.
an increa? e of P21 per cent. In 1891 the amount
of deposits in savings banks was $1,023,079,749.
It is estimated that 91 per cent of these deposits
represent the savings of wage earners.
There nerer has been a time in our history when
work was so abundant, or when wages were so
high, whether measured by the currency in which
they are paid, or by their power to supply the
necessaries and comforts of life. It is true that
the market prices of cotton and wheat have been
low. It is one of the unfavorable incidents of
agriculture that the fanner cannot produce upon
orders,
But while the fact I havestated is true as'to the
crops, I have mentioned, tho general average of
prices has been such as to give to agriculture a
fci!r participation in the geneial prosperity. The
value of our total farm products has increased
from $1,360,616,866 in I860 to $4,5lO,0(X),rOO in 1891,
as estimated by statisticians, an increase of 230
per cent. The number of hogs January 1, 1891,
was 50,6210." and their value $2tr ,193,925; on Jan
nary 1 18P2 tha number was 5,'598,019, and the
valus $241,031,415. On January '. 1891, the num
ber or cattle was 16,7".0i8 and the value $544,

239 and the value $570.749,IV.
If an are discontented with their state here; if
any believe that the wacres or prices, the returns
for honest toil, rre inadequate, they should not
fail to remember that there is no other country in
the world where the conditions that t e im to them
hard, would not be accepted tin highly prosperous.

as in lHol, to the detente of the fiog" when it is
assailed.
1 recommend that the whole subject of tariff
revision be left to the mcomin? congress. It is
n matt r of regrot that this work must be de
layed lor at least throe months for the threat of
treat tariff changes introduces so much uncer
tainty, that an amount not rcsi y e timatod of
busine s inaction and of diminist ed production
will nece sarily result. It is possible, also, tint
this uncertainty mav tesult in de 'rcas'd reve
nues from customs dut es, for our merchants
will mnke cautious orders for oreign roods in
view of the prospect of tariff reductions and
the uncertainty os to when it will t ike erf e t
if a system of customs dnties can be framed
that will set the idle wheels and looms of En
rope in motion and crowd onr warehouses with
foroig'-tnadi goods, and at the same time keep
our own mills busy ; that will give us an in
creased participation in "the markets of the
world" of a greater va'ne than the home market
that we surrender; that will give increase!
work to foreign workmen upon products to be
consumed by our people without diminish nx
the amount of work to oe done here; that will
ennble the American manufacturer to pay to his
workmen from fifty to a hundred per cent more
in wages than is paid in the f ieign mill and
i et to compete ia our markets and in fore ga
markets with the foreign producer; that will
further reduce the cost of articles of wear and
food without reducing the wages of those who
produce them ; that can be celebrated, after its
ettects have been realized, ns its expectation
has been in Europe as well as in American
cities, the author and promoters of it will be
entitled to the highest praise. We have had in
our history several experiences of tho contrast
ed effects of a revenue and of a protective
tariff ; but this generation has not felt them.and
the experience of one generation is not highly
instructive to tho next.
The attention, not only of congress, but of the
country, is again invited to the methods of ad
ministration which havo been pursued, and to
the results which have been attained. Public
revenues amounting to $1,414,079,292.23 have
been collected and disbursed without loss from
misappropriation, without a single defalcation
of such importance as to attract the public at
tention, and at a diminished per cent of cost for
collection. . ...
The complicated and ibrsatemng- differences
with Germany and England relating to Samoan
affairs, with Englaad in relation to the seal
fisheries in Behring sea. and with Chin grow
ing out of the Baltimore affair, have been ad
justed. . .
The following statistics show the increase in
our trade with the countries with which we
have reciprocal trade agreements from the date
when such agreements went into effect up to
September 3u, 1892, the increase being in some
almost wholly and in others in an important
degree the result of these agreements.

while we wait to see whether these criticisms
will take the form of legislation.
In the recomrcendat on of the secretary that
the sinking fund law be lepoaled, I concur. The
redemption ot bonds sinse-ne passage of the
law to June :.0, 1&92, has reaay exceeded the
requirements by the sum of S990.510.681.4t. The

The renenues estimated and actual for the
fiscal year ending June 0, 1893, ate placed by
the secretary at Si63.tJt.C50.44. and the expendi
tures at$ul,33ti,350.44, shotrinr a surplus of re
ceipts over expenditures of $1,000,000. 1 he cash
balance in the treasury at the end of the fiscal
year, it is estimated, will be 5--0,iN2. J77.0L'.
The estimates of revenues to be received are
necessary based upon existmar laws. New rev
enue legislation, or even tbo expectation of it
may seriously reduce the oubJic ravenues dur
ing the period of uncertainty and during the
press oi business ao ustment to tho new condl

Ever sinco our merchant marina was driven
from the sea by the cruisers during tha war of
tne rebellion, the united states thus paying an
enormous annual tribute to foreign countries in
the shape of passage monies. Our grain and
meats have been taken at our own docks and
our large imports there laid down by foreign
ship masters. An increasing torrent of Ameri
can travel to Europe has contributed annually
to the dividends of foreign ship owners. The
balance of trade shown by the books of our cus
tom nouses has been largely reduced, and in
many years, altogether extinguished bv this
constant strain, in the year 1892 only 12.4 per
cone oi our imiort3 were brought in American
vessels. Tho foreign steamships maintained bj
our traffic are many of them under contract with,
their respective governments by which, in time
of war, they will becomo a part of their armed
naval establishments. Profiting by our com
merce in peace, they will becomo the most for
midable destroyors of our commerce in time of
war. I felt, and havo before expressed the feel
ing that this condition of things was both intol
erable and disgraceful. A wliolraomo change
of policy and having so much promise as it
seems to me, was begun by the law of .March 3,
1891. Under this law contracts have been made
by tho postmaster general for eleven ocean mail
routs. The expenditure involved by these con
tracts for the next fiscal year aproximatod $954,
123.33. As one of the good results reached, six
teen American ships of an aggregate tonnage of
57,400 tons, costing $7,400,000 has been built or
contracted to bo built in American ship yards.
The estimated tonnage of all steamships re
quired under existing contracts, is 65,802, and
when the full servico required by these con
tracts is established, there will be forty-one
mail steamers under tho American flag with the
probability of further necessary additions in tne
lirazilian and Argentine service. The contracts
recently let for tho trans-Atlantic service, will
result in tho construction of five ships of ten
thousand tons each, costing nino or ten million
dollars, and will add, with tho City of New
York, and City of Paris, to which the treasury
department was authorized by legislation at
tho last session to give American registry, seven
of the swiftest vessels upon the sea to our naval
rose rre.
I earnestly urge a continuance of the policy in
augurated by this legislation and that the appro
priations required to meet the obligations of the
government under the contracts may be properly
made so that the lines that have entered into
these engagements may not be embarassed.
The agreement which has been made by the
commission is perhaps the most satisfactory that
could have been reached. It will be noticed that
it is conditioned upon its ratification by congress
before March 4, 893. The secretary of the in
terior, who has given the subject careful thought,
recommends the ratification of the agreement and
was inclined to follow this recommendation.
Certain it is that some action by wnich this con
troversy shall be brought to amend and the lands
opened to settlement is urgent.
When the present secretary entered upon his
duties only three modern vessels were in commis
sion. The vessels since pot in commission and
to be put in commission during the winter will
make a total of 19 during his administration of
the department During the cunent year ten
war vessels and three navy tags have been launch
ed. Contracts have been let daring this administra
tioB, under the appropriations' for the increase of
the navy, including new vessels and their appur
tenances to the amount of $.',0u0.iiC0, and there
has been expended during the same period for
labor at navy yards unon similar work $8,000,000
withoat the smallest scandal or charge of fraud
or partiality.
Our army is small, but its organization should
all the more be put upon the moat approved
modern basis. The conditions upon what we
have called the 'frontier,''havo heretofore re
quired the maintainance of small posits, but now
the policy of concentration is obviously the right
one. The new posts should hare the proper strat
egic rotations to the frontiers" we now have,
those of the sea coast and of the northern part oi
our southern boundary.
