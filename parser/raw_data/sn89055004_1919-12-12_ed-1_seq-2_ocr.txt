PRESIDENT URGE8 CONGRESS TO
CONSIDER NATION'S READ
JUSTMENT PROBLEMS.
to
Heartless Profiteering and Machina
tions of Manevolent Reds Are Cited
by Chief Executive in Message
From Sick Bed.
Washington.—General recommenda
tions on legislation to combat the cost
of living, labor unrest, radicalism and
readjustment of the nation to peace
time basis were the features of Pres
ident Wilson's annual message to con
delivered on December 2.
The peace treaty, the president told
congress, will be discussed in a sep
arnte message later, as will the rail
road question.
For the second time only since the
president established the practice of
addressing congress In person his mes
sage was read by the clerks.
The president's principal recommen
dations were:
Establishment of a budget system
for the national finances,
Reorganization of the taxation sys
tem with simplification of the income
and excess profits.
' Readjustment of the tariff system,
If necessary, to meet changed world
conditions and make the system con
form with the fact that the United
States Is "the greatest capitalist In
the world."
Recognition and relief for veteran
soldiers of the world war, particularly
In the way of government farms as
proposed by Secretary Lane.
Proper measures to foster the dye
stuffs industry built up during the
war, to keep the United States inde
pendent of foreign supply.
An enlarged program for rural de
velopment, in recognition of the farm
ers' part in the war.
Measures which "will remove the
causes" of "political restlessness in
our body politic."
At this point the president made his
most extensive reference to the peace
treaty by saying the causes for the
unrest "are superficial rather than
deep-seated," and that they "arise
from or are connected witli the failure
ou the part of our government to ar
rive at a just and permanent peace,
permitting return to normal condi
tions, from the transfusion of radical
theories from seething European cen
ters pending such delay, from heart
less profiteering resulting from the in
crease of the cost of living, and lastly,
from the machinations of passionate
and malevolent ug'.tators. With tue
return to normal conditions this un
rest will rapidly disappear."
The president renewed his recom
mendations for legislation to deal ef
fectively with "those persons who by
violent methods would abrogate our
time tested institutions."
High Cost of Living.
Several recommendations and some
renewals of previous ones were made
by the president to bring down the
cost of living. Among them were ex
tension of the food control law to
peace times for the emergency, regu
lations for transportation of foods In
interstate commerce, a cold storage
law modeled after the law in New Jer
sey, a law requiring marks to show
the length of time foods are kept in
storage and a law to secure "com
petitive selling and prevent uncon
scionable profits" by federal license
of corporations selling food in inter
state commerce.

a
Rights of Labor.
A long portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the condi
tion and rights of labor. "A definite
program to living about an Improve
ment U\ the conditions of labor" and
"brins ..bout a genuine democratiza
tion of industry" was recommended.
"The only way to keep men from
agitating against grievances Is to re
move the grievances," said the presi
dent's message. At another point it
declared "the seed of revolution is re
pression."
"The establishment of the principles
regarding labor, laid down in the cov
enant of the league of nations," said
the message, "offers us the way to
industrial peace and conciliation,
other road lies open to us. * * *
ermnents must recognize the right of
men to bargain collectively for hu
mane objects. » » ♦ Labor no longer
must be treated as a commodity."
" 1'he right of Individuals to strike is
inviolate," continues the message "and
ought not to be interfered with by any
process of the government, but there
Is a predominant right and that is the
right of the government to protect all
of its people and to assert Its

The message closed with a pointed
reference to radicalism and red doc
