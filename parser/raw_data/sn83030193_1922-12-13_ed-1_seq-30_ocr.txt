A PLATFORM MESSAGE.
IN' fTS political aspect, President Harding's
message to Congress last week was a plat
form message more than it was a program of
legislation.
The President was outlining the platform of
1924 and opening the way for discussion and
improvement. On many of the issues he is pre
paring for the nett campaign claims that the
Democrats are "stealing our thunder."
This applies whether the Republican candi
date in 1924 is Warren G. Harding or any other.
L'ut the President is not blind to the appropri
ateness of running a Harding candidate on a
Harding platform.
Good tactics, good politics and good citizen
ship alike point out the duty of the Democrats.
They should not obstruct in a partisan spirit.
They should sift the good from the bad in the
Harding platform, endeavoring to improve on
the good and to offer informative opposition on
the bad.
In the next eighteen months the President
ought to be able to learn a good deal about his
own platform.
In the main, and "in principle," it was an en
couraging effort. In particular, and in detail, it
is fusceptible of great Improvement. That is
the task of an intelligently guided opposition.
A Western Congressman is opposed to broad
casting Congressional debate. It's wiser to send
Judiciously selected and carefully edited ex
rerpts from the Congressional Record.
A FUTILE FIELD.
MANY readers are beginning to regret the
trend in current novel-writing toward
;neering at the commonplace.
The novelist who devotes a whole book to
satirizing the "standardized" dress, table man
ners, social conduct, business activities, opinions
and small talk of the minor citizen of Main
Street may have found a field for cleverness.
But what a futile field!
Satire is one of the great literary forms. The
great satirists of literature, however, the Swifts,
Rabelais. Cervantes and Fieldings, had bigger
Sms and objects. They were not interested in
forming or flattering "superiority complexes."
They were not doing what so many of our
present writers are constantly doing slyly in
viting the reader to look upon a group of char
acters and inwardly say:
"Y.cll, I may not be better or holier than these.
But. thank God, I am less commonplace!"
Older novelists like Dickens and Thackeray
were always ready to find dignity in the com
, monplacc, true worth in hum-drum, "standard
ized" lives.
Instead of forever insinuating that the only
, way to be distinguished is to be different, they
wrote from the deeper conviction that any com
mon habit of belief or conduct that makes life
seem more understandable and better worth liv
ing to great masses of human beings is worthy
of respect.
I f you want to see how a truly large-size, f ull
souled novelist looks a,t plain people, go back
ami ,rcad the words with which George Eliot ends
"Mitldlcmnrch," a masterly story of English pro
vincial life:
"Tho growing good of the world is partly de
pendent on unhistorlc nets; and that things
- are not o Hi with you and me as they might
have boon. Ih half owing to tho number who
Ilted faltbr.lly a hidden life, nnd res, in l'n
vlsited torn Im." '
Thai jhoiiglu alone is worth 10.000 "Bab-bir.."
. THE REAL REMEDY.
AS Till: result of the recent hazing scandal
at the Naval Academy, two midshipmen
Iww been dropped from the service and three
1iae been et back one class in the school.
Oihw' cases remain for decision by the officials.
V;ih all respect lo the authorities, occasional
i!iiisal from service will not stop the hazing.
N trjwill jt serve to burden the taxpayers with
It cost uf another jcar of schooling for those
VI hav'U.
n occaMon.-.l investigation with attendant
publicity is not the remedy. That rests with the
officers on dutv at the Naval AuJemy The
way to break up hazing is by day-to-day dis
cipline, administered by those in charge. The
way to prevent recurring hazing cnndals is to put
in authority officers who will not tolerate hazing
and who will be on the watch to put down the
first signs of the hateful practice.
If such a course were followed there- would
be no occasion for periodical investigations.
THE TIGER GOES HOME.
HAVING accomplished, as he puts it, "the
mission I have not received," the Tiger
sails back to France, leaving Americans to ponder
what he has said.
How many of them will ponder it and how
much?
Of those who closed their cars to anything M.
Clemenceau might say before he said it, we need
not speak. Their isolation is as confirmed as the
isolation they would wish upon their country.
But what about the open-minded? What about
those who would not willingly sec the foreign
policy of the United States congealed into phrases?
What about Americans who are capable of look
ing upon momentous facts and crises of peace,
even as they looked upon momentous facts and
crises of war, as possible calls to duty?
Some of M. Clemenceau's parting words were
as reassuring as any he has uttered during his
visit. In his interview with Walter Lippmann,
for example, he appeared with appealing frank
ness and force as the experienced French states
man only too well aware of the chauvinistic use
French politicans make of whatever points to in
security for France.
He would have no "annexing of Germans," he
"fears the Ruhr," he wants no "protesting popu
lations inside the frontiers of France," he is ready
to be friends with German democracy "let Ger
many be as rich as she likes" all he asks is
present agreement and support among the one
time allies of France to assure reparation and pro
tection for France. "The more agreement we
have, the less force we shall need."
And in his farewell speech last night he said:
"We have been quarrelling too often with Eng
land, and this might have been avoided if America
had been there."
"If America had been there!" Since the war,
out of the abortive conferences, the frustrated ef
forts, the failures, again and again comes that
cry to weigh upon American conscience.
M. Clemenceau has left facts for us to ponder,
lie has also left a profound truth in simple words
that go straight to "the soul of the matter:
"A nation cannot be great one day and small
another."
THROWING THE SWITCH.
IT begins to look as though Congress would. side
track the ship subsidy in favor of rural
credits.
If rural credit measures are passed ahead of
thehip subsidy, then Mr. Lasker's pet measure
will never get off the sidetrack.
More than once we have seen a worth)- legis
lative measure coupled with a bad one and both
have passed on a trading basis. That was what
Mr. Harding evidently proposed tu do. That ac
counts for the brief mention of rural credits in
the special message on the subsidy.
It would have been a disgraceful trade. But
the possibility was menacing.
Supporters of rural credits have power to force
the passage of their measure. They do not need
to trade. Once it is passed it strips the privilege
mongers of trading stock. Farm bloc leadership
will score a real triumph if it can succeed in
winning the good bill without paying with a bad
bill.
The sidetrack is the proper place, for the subsidy
grab. More power to the switch engine.

UNCOMMON SENSE
Kv John Rlalt
' Wtjrrtru. lilt t Itaa Rata.)
ON THE WRONG ROAD.
"JJc sun; you nr: right and then go ahead," is a maxim
which is perfectly .sufe lo follow.
But, "Be sure you are wrong before you htop" is n
maxim which ought to be preached early and often to thrf
class of youths known as "starters" which is a very numerous
class indeed.
A very common habit among beginners in life is that of
deciding that the road is wrong- as soon as it begins to be a
little miry or hilly or hard going.
All roads, right or wrong, arc hard going here and there
- -most always at Hie beginning if thev arc roads through
life.
U is necessary that they should be hard, for mail v. as
never intended for rust-, and it is never good for him.
There arc hundreds of young men who begin with law
or medicine or newspaper work or engineering who turn back
the minute they encounter the very difficulties which arc the
real tests of persistence and ability.
Back they go lo take some other road that seems easier,
only lo find that it, too, has its stretches of bad travelling, and
lo leave that and take still nnolhcr.
Of course, any one will do best in the business or pro
fession for which he is best fitted. Bui there is much non
sense preached and believed by young men about the danger
of getting on th wrong road. Any road that leads In an
upward direction is better thou no road at all and many men
have got very, very far on roads that they travelled because
of sheer pluck, even after they found out that some other
road might have been easier for them.
It is persistence that counts In early life dogged deter
mination to get somewhere, no matter how many obstacles
stand in the waj
Continual turning back and starting over is a waste of
time which will do more mischief even than taking the wronj?
road in the beginning.
Discouragement lies along every way that is open to
young manhood and womanhood. But it is merely a rough
iilaco and not a barrier. And the passing of it will make all
the rough places to come seem easier.

XIII. THE STORY BiOLOQY
TELL8.
Biology la a new study, which haa '
recently found Its way Into the pub
Ho schools. The text books on physi
ology aro now written by biologists.
To study biology hi to study life
that is what It means, tho study of
living substance. Tho old books be
gan with tho birth of tho child; tho
new books go back to the beginning
of tho unborn child.
One of tho great truths of biology.
which our grandparents never sus
pected, la that every animal and every,
plant begins life as a single cell of
protoplasm. It might bo better to say,
that every living organism begins life
as a two-ln-one cell; for before anj
of the higher animals and plants can
be created, two cells ot pre-cxtatlOK
protoplasm have to bo brougfit to
gether and merged Into a single cclL
In animals the mother cell la called
an ovum, the father cell a sperm.
The ovum and the sperm are uselea
unUI brought together. The moment
they aro brought together and unite.
tho united cell constitutes a new In
dividual. At tho moment the parental
cells unite, a new being cOmes .nto
existence
Tho united ceil Brows to a certain
size, then It divides Into two cells, the
two grow and dlvldo and so on until
the unborn child In fully formed. Tho
process of growth and division are
IdenUcal with those ef slnrie-cclled
animals, with this difference Instead
drifting apart, the daughter cells
adhero together.
So a human being ts an assemblage
of cells, a sort of community, wherein
the Individual cells have Trvimftd
through the forces of heredity, to snc-
clallzc In different kinds of work.
Muscle cells, for csample, havo be
come very claBtlc. whereas other cells
have become adept In other kinds of
work, just us In a village soma men

have stamped upon the cells of the
body an ability to do different T.lndi
of work. Among thembelves the cII
have somehow Irarned to apportion
the labor of living, so that each may
do Its part efficient.'.
Another great net learnt b blolo-
clsts baa been cxpivsscd as llio ?o-
cullcd biogenetic law. This law
holds that "each child passes thiotigh
the samo stages or development that
Its race has passed through; In other
words, that each child repeats the
hlstorv of tho human race.
ITy .stiMytng'fhe development of a
child, therefore, we can learn from
It the stages through which the race
has risen. Since u child begins life
as a single-celled organism (tile
fertilized oum). It follows that the
earliest ancestors of tho human race
wero . single-celled animals. Because
human embryo passes through
worm-like, hyra-ltko and gastrula
like stages. It follows from the law
that thero waa a time when our an
cestoru wero no higher than these
forms. The gill-slits on an unborn
child's neck hark back to an aquatle
existence. The lanugo, or hairy coat
ing of hair, which a child sheds be
fore being born or Boon afterward,
suggests furry ancestors. According
to the law, the fact that a child
creeps before walking, and cries before
talking, Indicates an anthropoid ex
istence. Moreover, the Instincts
which ore Inborn with every child
aio supposed to reprebent tho lessons
our ancestors learned us a result of
terrible experience. Children eUII
fear such things, for example, as
their ancestors learned by bitter ex
perience to fear.
If the biogenetic law be true, there
fore, wo can learn from a study of
children more about the human race.
and tho struggles through which our
ancestors learned to walk erect, tnan
wo can learn from books. Is a ootid
re-enacting human history, for exam
ple, when learning to walk? It
crawls here and there, reaching after
things which are Just beyond Its
reach. After many falls, the reachln
leads to standing and finally to walk
ing on two feet.
Many students of human natur taa
lteve we may learn from children that
our anoeatqra, reaching after tempt
ing things, whloh buna; higher than
their heads, literally tan tallied them
selves Into an erect attitude.
