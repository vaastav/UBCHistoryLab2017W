THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
The message which President Wilson
delivered to the congress yesterday ap
pears on page three of this paper.
Strong ground is taken against a stand
ing army and militarism generally, and
in favor of a powerful navy. This is
he well settled Democratic policy.
Read the whole message. It is a great
state paper stated in the clear and
forcible Woodrow Wilson way.
SAFETY FIRST,
The Chicago Tribune and other third
party newspapers are discussing the
question “Where will the Progressives
go?”
It will be even more important what
patriotic men of independent thought
and action do in the primaries of 1916
than what they do at the polls in
November of that year. These men,
who put country before party, often
turn the scale for good in presidential
elections. But unfortunately they only
exercise a part of their citizenship. In
their struggle for self government the
colonies had long been accorded the
right to elect before they won the right
to nominate. At that time Crown ap
pointed secretaries made the nomina
tions : and they could only vote to elect
or reject. Now in many states the
nomination of candidates is hedged
about by laws as well as is the election
of candidates to office. And the nom
ination of candidates is often the more
important part of the work of self gov
ernment. Because unless the names of
worthy men are placed upon the official
ballot they can never be elected.
Under President Wilson’s leadership
the Democratic party is progressing;
while the Republican party, dominated
by Rose Penrose and others, is pulling
backward. Independent, patriotic men
who would do their full share of the
work which devolves upon them as
good citizens should come at this time
into the Democratic party. Their ser
vices are needed to renominate Mr.
Wilson, and to nominote forward look
ng men for senators and representa
tives, and for other offices. The safe
course is to make sure that the Demo
cratic candidates shall be progressive.
TURN ON THE LIGHT.
P. A. Badour, editor of The Oconto
Enterprise and president of the Wis
consin Democratic Press Association,
strongly backs up the demand of The
Milwaukee Journal for publicity in the
matter of receipts and expenditures by
the Wisconsin Taxpayers’ league. The
Enterprise says:
The Milwaukee Journal commenda
bly is asking the Wisconsin Taxpayers’
league some very pertinent questions,
and in view of the fact that the organ
ization was back of Mr. Philipp’s candi
dacy it would interest us very much if
its questions were answered. The main
question is: “Where did the league
get the money with which to carry on
its campaign?” We hope the Journal
will get the information it seeks.
GOOD TIMES ASSURED.
Wherever men of business affairs get
together for consultation good reason is
given for optimism. At the American
Mining Congress at Phoenix, Ariz., on
Tuesday, George Otis Smith, director
of the United States geological survey,
delivered an address in which he pre
sented most favorable conditions for
profitable activity in farming, mining
and manufacturing. Here is an extract
from his address:
Evidence of business betterment is
before ns on every hand, and the rea
sons for optimism are many. The
United States farmer has harvested a
five billion dollar crop and there is a
high-price market for all our surplus
food stuffs. Already our grain is pour
ing across the Atlantic. The millions
of men who are fighting are not work
ing, and yet these hordes of soldiers
must be clothed and equipped as well
as fed. Foreign orders have started
factory operation which at once tends to
relieve the stagnation in the steam-coal
trade, the steel situation has turned
from serious depression to rapid im
provement. and the whole mineral in
dustry may soon expect to share in this
general business improvement.
Today the financial horizon is so
nearly cloudless that the prophets of
bad weather have little upon which to
base their predictions. The new federal
banking system makes the money re
serves mobile as never before, and ex
tension of credit is now possible, with
out the veto power remaining in the
hands of a small group of big men.
Still another reason for belief in busi
ness betterment is the recognition, now
becoming widespread, of the general
interpedence of big business and the
general pnbb>. On the one side, the
people me realizing that ihey are and
have been in reality the silent partner
big business, and now that there has
come the promise of some regulation
that will in large part prevent mono
polistic centralization, the people are
interested in getting their share of re
turns that can come only with opera
tion at a profit. On the other hand,
the managers of the large corporation,
the trustees of the investing public, are
beginning to that a certain financial
security goes with public confidence,
and that the attitude to the public so
tersely expressed thirty years ago by a
pioneer in railroad financing does not
pay dividends today.
While European countries have been
mobilizing their armies and calling to
the field of battle their reserves of sol
diers, America has mobilized its credit
and begun to send forward to the
market place its vast reserves of food
stuffs and mineral products.

PRESS POINTS
Platteville News: The school house
is the place for public meetings and the
best way to bring about the public
meetings at the school house is to or
ganize a Social Center movement and
have all questions discussed
there. If the average citizen gets the
facts correct on any public question he
can be trusted to do the right thing,
Bloomington Record: The big “vic
tory” some Republicans are claiming
at the recent election would have been
given the Democrats a majority of 100
votes in the electoral college in a presi
dential election. So long as the Re
publicans rejoice over that kind of a
“victory” there should be no difficulty
about re-electing President Wilson in
two years.
Blanchardville Blades: All mac
adamized roads constructed in Green
county in 1915 will be oiled before they
are pronounced complete. Avery good
idea. It should be done in every coun
ty in state where these roads are built.
It preserves them to a great extent.
Waterloo Democrat: The city of
Janesville is very proud of the record
made under the commission form of
government which was adopted two
years ago. The tax rate per thousand
dollars has fallen from $18.50 to $9.26,
and this in spite of the fact that more
permanent improvements have been
made than in any 3 years together
previously. The city has three com
missioners who devote their entire time
to the business of the city and who
have charge of all the city business ex
cept the public school management.
Democratic Opportunity.
Milwaukee Journal: The Democrats
in Wisconsin can let the matter of their
next national committeeman go by de
fault or they can face the issue and do
the thing that needs to be done.
The only hope of Democracy in Wis
consin lies in being a Progressive Dem
ocracy. We can see a situation in
which Wisconsin may become a Dem
ocratic state, provided the party is not
in the hands of Tories or Reactionaries.
So far as Democracy is concerned,
much will depend on the course pur
sued by the new governor, Mr. Philipp.
If he goes about the affairs of Wiscon
sin in a businesslike and sensible man
ner, he will appeal to men of all parties.
But if he develops reactionary tenden
cies, of which there are some indica
tions,* he will build up the Democratic
party. An astonishing thing was the
bitterness Mr. Philipp showed in his
speech at Appleton on the tax commis
sion. The Tory Democratic and Re
publican alliance of 1912 to destroy the
income tax is still fresh in the minds of
the people, and if it cannot be destroyed
SOME PRINTING!
NEW TYPE |
The Democrat office is doing more printing this
fall than ever before. With new type, labor sav
ing material, good presses and other machinery
operated with electric power; and with competent
and willing workers; we are turning out first class
work promptly, and at moderate prices. r Work
turned out from this office speaks for itself; The
type faces are neat and artistic, and well arranged.
Good paper stock is used, and ink that is manu
factured: for particular printers.
Give us your orders and we will give you satis
faction. Crawford Brothers, Mineral Point.

VENTILATION.
‘•More deaths are occasioned by im
proper ventilation of train coaches and
waiting rooms than by train accidents.
The noxious gases that fill coaches, es
pecially sleeping cars, in connection
with the peculiar character of dnst
therein are most conducive to germ
breeding where proper ventilation is
lacking.”
The above paragraph is an extract
from a report recently made to a con
vention of railway commissioners at
Washington. Its startling statement is
sufficient to direct the attention of the
public to the matter of proper ventila
tion. Winter’s greatest danger is the
congregating of people in halls or rooms
where the air is foul.

directly, the next point of attack will
be the commission. It is certain that
if through Mr. Philipp, the Tories are
really in power, they will stop at noth
ing in this direction. If he follows the
reactionary course, and it is regrettable
that there are some signs that he may,
the Democrats can come into power, if
they are progressive. For there is no
hope for them if they are reactionary.
A Good Amendment.
Oconto Enterprise: Michigan, at the
last election, adopted an amendment to
its constitution which provides that
traveling men and students may vote
while away from home on election day.
Like Wisconsin, its sister state sub
mitted a number of amendments to its
constitution at the last election, but
this was the only one that carried, the
majority in its favor being about 14,000,
This is a good provision and we believe
every state in the Union ought to follow
Michigan’s example by adopting a
similar amendment.
One of the Reasons.
In a paean of republican thanksgiv
ing the Philadelphia Press declares that
the republican party “does not believe
in ‘White House dictation to Congress
and ‘the tyrannous rule of King Cau
cus.” That is interesting; certainly
one of the reasons why the republican
party went out of power was that it
had for so long submitted to a worse
rule than that of “King Caucus,” —the
rule of Joseph G. Cannon and the pur
blind crew around him. Springfield
Republican.
increase of Food Imports.
Springfield Republican: So much
has been said about the ruinous effects
of the new tariff on American manu
factures that the imports for the 10
months ending October 30 furnish in
teresting information. Let us take it
from the politically colorless Brad
street’s, which says:
Imports for 10 months, it will be
seen, gained $88,000,000, or 6 per cent,
over the like period a year ago; but this
entire gain is more than explained by
the increase of $92,00p,000, or 28 per
cent, in the imports of crude and partly
manufactured food products and ani
mals.
What’s the harm in making easier
imports of food? And where was the
harm to the other industries in an in
crease of food imports?
The Milwaukee Journal; So many
Christmas cards don’t mean anything,
someone complained. That’s easy;
put a Christmas seal on and they’ll
mean health and happiness.
Treatment of Cute.
A finger cut with a clean knife needs
only to be washed with soap and wa
ter before dressing. A wound made
with an unclean instrument ought to
have a cleansing that will be destruc
tive to germs.

TO CURB DRINKING IN ENGLAND
men were members of a delegation
which recently visited Mr. McKenna at
the home office and asked his assist
a nee in battling the wave of alcoholism
among women. Lady Byles, who pre
sented the delegation, explained that
the members represented different
opinions socially and politically, but
were unanimous in the opinion that
the government should take immediate
steps to check drinking among women.
They furthermore believed that any
regulation undertaken by the govern
ment should extend to men as well as
women. The prohibition of the sale of
liquor before noon was suggested as a
regulation that would lessen the temp
tation offered by public bouses. Such
a curtailment of the hours ot public
bouses would permit them to remain
open only ten hours daily.
Mr. McKenna replied that It would
require a netv act of parliament to
enable him to curtail the hours of
liquor aelling further. He promised to
submit the suggestion to the bouse.
Lady French, Lady Jelllcoe and oth
er prominent philanthropists, who have
established what they call Tipperary
clubs, where the wives of soldiers may
meet, have found the need for sneb so
cial centers so imperative and Immedi
ate that a plan has been devised to
turn all public houses into sneb centers
during the war. preventing the sale of
alcoholics and offering only temper
ance drinks, besides food.
In his last days Lord Roberts made
this appeal to the public to cease tempt
Ing soldiers with liquor:
“I feel it my duty to point out to the
civil population that putting tempta

themselves thoroughly fit and healthy.”
