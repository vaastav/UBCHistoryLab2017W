Honesty would have been the best

If the Paynesville Press of lagt vreefc

The Minneapolis Tribune says that
there is small hores cf tariff reform

and democratic victory. But will the

Baltimore News: In the days when
the doom of the Quay rottenness had
not yet been written, Mr. Roosevelt
did nothing that was calonlated to
hasten its downfall. He may have
felt —he doubtless did feel—that other
high considerations precluded his act­
ing toward Quay as some men of a
different kind of strenuousness would
have felt bound to act tbe fact re­
mains that he put no stumbling block
in Quay's path, that he lifted no
straw from the burden which the
people of Philadelphia and of Pennsyl­
vania were bearing and which tbe use
of the federal patronage assisted Quay
to compel them to bear. Render nnto
Roosevelt's—there are plenty of them.

MS. H. GRELL, Pier*
DIED
O. A. Coe, one. of the earliest set­
tlers of Minnesota, died at tbe home
of his sjn, Moses, in Belle Prairie,
Saturday morning about 9 -.15 o'clock,
of the infirmities incident to old
age, agea 87 years and 9 months.
Mr. Coe was a native of Oeauga
county, Ohio. At tne age of 16 years
his mother*
died, and until 1839 he
was employed on farms. In the sum­
mer of 1889 he was employed on
farms in Illinois and Wisconsin. He
was attracted westward by hearing
Rev. Frederick Ayer, a missionary to
the Indians,j father of Lyman Ayer
of Belle Prairie. In the fall of 1839
Mr. Coe came to Minnesota. He
reached Taylors Falls on the first
steamer that ever plied on the S.t
Croix river. The following winter
he was employed in the woods. In
the sammer of 1840 he assisted at the
mission farm at Pokegama lake. In
1841 he returned to Ohio, and in 1844
came baqk to Minnesota, taking
chaige of tbe Indian agency farm at
Red Lake, where he remained for sev­
eral years. In 1853 be settled on a
farm in Belle Prairie, being among
the earliest settlers of that town.
With intervals of visits to' various
places, he had since lived tbere.
Mr. Coe was married April 17,
1844, to Mias Henrietta Qalawa, who
died several years ago. He leaves
three sons and a daughter—Moses of
Belle Prairie, Alanson of Port Or­
chard, Wasnington, A. G., of Helena,
Mont., and Lillian, believed to be in
Ohio.
Tbe funeral took place from the
Congregational churoh Sunday after­
noon at 2 o'clock, Gey. Wallar con­
ducting, and tbe remains were in­
terred in Oakland.
Some years ago an accoant of Mr.
Coe's long and active life,, dictated
by himself, was published in The Her­
ald. It was full of stirring adven­
tures with the Indians, and was a
tiue picture of early days in this
state. Mr. Coe was a man of peace,
but not to be imposed
00.
He labored
among the Indians for years and was
creatly respected by them. He wag
temperate, never having used stimu­
lants, and of high character in every
respect. The old pioneer well re­
tained hi? faculties, notwithstanding
his advanced age, and liked to tell of I
the early days.
