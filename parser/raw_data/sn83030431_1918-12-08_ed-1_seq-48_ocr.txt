Washington-, December 7.
SEVERAL thousand anthuslastlc
Washington citizen and cmo
dlgnined gray pussy cat crowdod
the Union Station Tuesday night to
ay ,"Good-by" to the President, and
Incidentally to a few others who were
about to entrain on the flrststage of
their Journey to Paris. No, Cicely, I
wtu not tho gray pussy cat, though I
flld wear that gray bollvla coat and
niy gray furs. There was another. It
had slipped through tho guards at tho
entrance to the President's prlvato
waiting room, and waited Just lnsldo
the door "all same like me!" But I
Jiad borrowed a poltco badgo for tho
occasion and pussy hadn't.
It was sheer luck my being there.
I had thought of going but had not
Wanted to wait around Indefinitely the
Tvholo evening. And It tiever Is an
nounced Just when a Presidential
party will set forth. It simplifies the
work of the secret service not to do
eoj Calling up Mrs. Lansing to wish
Jisr "bon voyage," I caught her Just
waiting for their motor to take them
to the station. She confirmed casually
my own suspicion that tho party was
going to New York on tho President's
train andwero to rendezvous at tho
station any time after 10. Incidentally
the assured me she would read theso
tatters every week while sho was away
tofln5 out what was really going on In
Washington.
1 Troops Form a Human Lftne
I hastened to the- station, slipped
through and lined myself up alongside
of. Major Pullman, our Chief of Police.
Who Is an old friend, Just before they
all arrived. Details of soldiers and
allors wero on duty and as the party'
passed through the doors several hun
dred stalwart figures In khaki and In
blue formed a human lano through
Which tho Chief Executive, tho First
Lady and her secretary, Miss Edith
Benham, whose .father was a Rear
Admiral, passed. Those were tho only
three who set forth actually from the
lVlilto House on this momentous Jour
ney. Mrs. Wilson was wearing a coat suit
ft dark blue, which she has often worn
around tho Washington, streets, a
Eeml-ftttlng coat with deep cuffs and
wldo rolling collar of sealskin, and a
well cut skirt, not too short, with seal
skin bands edging tho side panels.
Bho woro with this a small 'black hat
with little pointed wings of the aero
plane variety, sticking out at one side
und toward the back. She also was
wearing a lovely slnglo orchid and
a wide smile."
Miss Benham was so completely
done up In a caracul coat that it was
liard to seo what she had on under
neath, and Mrs. Lansing? who was
pacing tho platform for ten or fifteen
minutes while the others wero en
training, was swathed In sealskin.
Diplomats In Other Cars.
Thetje were other cars reserved for
tho President's guests from thp diplo
matic circle, the French and Italian
Ambassadors and their families, with
presumably such olds and secretaries
us they deemed necessary, and yet
others for tho American members of
.he party the Secretary of State nnd
Mrs, Lansing, the Ambassador to St.
James's and Mrs. Davis, Secretary
Baker, Mr. Tumulty tho two latter
went to New York with the President,
though they did not sail with him
and Henry White, former Ambassador
and now peace delegate.
Washington, at least the part of the
population of the national capital that
counts, or thinks It does, turned out
o hear tho President's message lc
ore tho two houses of Congress last
yMonday. Mrs. Wilson, with a large
party of Boilings, was In the front
reats of the Executive gallery. Mrs.
McAdoo came down and joined them,
fitting next to her stepmother. She
was most attractive In a tailored suit
of golden brown, with golden brown
furs that might havo been mink, and
& little fur toque.
Nearly tlm entire group of "Cablnet
eers" wero in that little gallery Mrs.
Marshall, Mrs. Lansing and her most
intimate friend, Mrs. John W. Davis;
Mrs. Daniels, Mrs. Lane, Mrs. Iled
fleld, Mrs. Houston, Miss Agnes Hart
Wilson, whose mother has been too
much of an Invalid to go anywhere,
and Jano Oregory, and Sydney Burle
eon, who camo In together, apparently
representing their mothers.
In the opposite gallery across the
length of the chamber Is tho Speakers
family "pew." but Mrs. Clark had so
many gueqts that sho herself was
crowded out. She wan looking, par
ticularly weH and had on a most be
coming hat, a small round toque with
a black satin crown nnd dahlias In
dark red and purplish tones laid flat
around it, and sho was woarlng a
graceful loose wrap of black watln
with a slight conventional embroidery
design.
To return to Mrs. Clark she is re
suming her "before the war" Wednes
days. Sho was at home Informally
last Wednesday and Is tho first of the
official women to get back onto hci
"before tho war" social basis. "Cubl
net" days, suspended during the war
seem doomed. It was a nice friendl'
democratic sort of an Institution. Bu
I haven't found any ono of them read
to commit herself as to taking up the
burdon again, und It certainly was i,
burden. Most of tho official wotner
would not havo had tlmo for It dven
If they had had tho inclination. Tho
re still knee deep In war work, for
tho aftermath requires scarcely Wh a
effort than did octlvo wnrfare, nnd I
Is much harder to keep the forces to
gether.
You know this business of muster
ing people out of service and of hang
ing around to ree what's going to hap
pen Is very trying. All my best frlenili
are moro or less doing it. and one won
ders who is Kl)ing to may and who t
going tu ! permitted to go home, .lusi
the other iH ti1R Archibald Hurkllcn
Sn'f Uy '.ow,y "Wment here
at Wendell Mansions, Just above Shsri-
dan Circle, on Massachusetts avenue.
Mrs. Barklle expected to be here most
of the winter; Iwr husband whenever
business army business allowed.
They wero here a week ago awaiting
orders. Now Major Barklle Is sta
tioned at Camp Meade just to keep
him busy, apparently and Mrs. Bark
lle has rented her lovely apartment
and gono bock to Inver House 'at
Wayne.
Nobody seems to know what to ex
pect of the Baruch and tho Stet,tlnlus
families. Mr. Biruch has been here
off and on. Mrs. Baruch and Miss
Belle Baruch have scarcely been here
nt all this season. But apparently they
mean to be, for Miss Baruch' figures
prominently on the various commlt-
tees for tho Junior League ball on
Nw Year's Eve. Mrs. Siettlnlus nnd
Miss Isabel wero expected to spend
most of the winter here but so far as
I know have not been here except for
a day or two en route from White Sul
phur Springs to New York. Miss Betty
Stettlnlus was not to have been here
anyhow except for the holidays she's
a college girl.
Tho buds and the brides are having
things pretty much their own way.
But tho brides are uncertain In their
prospects. The three most Inter
esting are Barn Price Collier, who will
marry Lieut. Charles Fellowes Gordon
of H. M. 8. Warrior, next Saturday:
Catherine Harlow, who Is to marry
Ltoutenant - Commander Theodjro
Stark Wilkinson 2d, on Tuesday, De
cember 17, with a matron of honor,
uk bridesmaids, ushers to match, and
all the "trlmmlns" (which Is what you
get Just now for picking an American),
and Eleanora Morgan, whoso engage
ment to Major Mnurlco Fitmaurlco
D.iy of tho British War Mission was
only announced last Sunday, with the
statement that tho wedding would take
place early In December.
Mrs. Price Collier In setting Decem
ber 14 as tho dato for Miss Collier's
wedding, said frankly that it was the
subject to change without notlco. For
Lieut. Gordon Is Admiral Grant's Flag
Lieutenant, nnd If tho Warrior should
gut her sailing orders there might have
to bo ii hurrv up wedding. Mrs. Mor
gan Is In the samo position, M mbcrs
of tho British" War Mission nra being
sent homo every day, and no man
knows when his turn will come. So It
Is probable that Miss Morgan may bo
married nt short notice.
Just ns I'm going to press, word Is
brought of the arrival of another mis
sion. This ono Is from Japan, headed
by H. I. H. Princo Admiral Hlgashl
Fushiml.
In tho absence of tho President tho
Vice-President, who whether ho likes
It or not seems to bo functioning to a
degree at least ns President pro tern,
will havo tho entertaining of them with
tho udvico and assistance of Frank
Polk, Counsellor of tho State Depart
ment and Secretary of State pro tern.
