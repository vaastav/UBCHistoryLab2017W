Perhaps the most important of all
legislation needed for the benefit of the
army is a law to equalize and increase
the pay of officers and enlisted men of
the army, navy, marine corps and reve
nue cutter service. Such a bill has
been prepared, which it is hoped will
meet with your favorable considera
tion. The next most essential measure
is to authorize a number of extra of
ficers as mentioned above. To make
the army more attractive to enlisted
men it is absolutely essential to create
a service corps, such as exists in near
ly every modern army in the world, to
do the skilled and unskilled labor in
separably connected with military ad
ministration, which is now exacted
without just compensation, of enlisted
men who voluntarily entered the army
to do service of an altogether different
kind. There are a number of other
laws necessary to so organize the army
as to promote its efficiency and facili
tate its rapid expansion in time of
war, but the above are the most im
portant.
LARGER NAVY NEEDED.
Appropriation For' Four New Battleships
Strongly Recommended.
It was hoped The Hague conference
knight deal with the question of the
limitation of armaments, but even be
fore it had assembled informal in
quiries had developed that as regards
naval armaments, the only ones in
which this country had any interest, it
was hopeless to try to devise any plan
for which there was the slightest pos
sibility of securing the assent of the
nations gathered at The Hague. No
plan was even proposed which would
have had the assent of more than one
Arst class power outside oft the United
States. The only plan that seemed at
all feasible, that of limiting the size
of battleships, met with no favor at
all. It is evident, therefore, that it is
folly for this nation to base any hope
of securing peace on any international
agreement as to the limitation of arma
ments. Such being the fact, it would
be most unwise for us to stop the up
building of our navy. To build one
battleship of the best and most ad
vanced type a year would barely keep
our fleet up to its present force. This
is not enough. In my judgment, we
should this year provide for four bat
tleships. But it is idle to build battle
ships unless in addition to providing
the men and the means for thorough
training we provide the auxiliaries for
them, unless we provide docks, the
coaling stations, the colliers and supply
ships that they need. We are extreme
ly deficient in coaling stations and
docks on the Pacific, and this deficien
cy should not longer be permitted to
exist. Plenty of torpedo boats and de
stroyers should be built. Both on the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts fortltica
tions of the best type should be pro.'
vided for all our greatest harbors.
We need always to remember that
in time of war the navy is not to be
used to defend harbors and seacoast
citles. We should perfect our system
of coast fortifications. The only effi
dent use for the navy is for offense.
The only way in which it can efficient
ly protect our own coast against the
possible action of a foreign navy is by
destroying that foreign navy. For de
fense against a hostile fleet which ac
tually attacks them the coast cities
must depend upon their forts, mines,
torpedoes, submarines and torpedo
boats and destroyers. All of these to
gether are efficient for defensive pur
poses, but they in no way supply the
place of a thoroughly efficient navy
capable of acting on the offensive, for
parrying never yet won a fight. It can
only be won by hard hitting, and an
aggressive seagoing navy alone can do
this hard hitting of the offensive type.
But the forts and the like are neces
sary, so that the navy may be foot
loose. In time of war there is sure to
be demand under pressure of fright for
the ships to be scatidred so as to de
fend all kind of ports. Under penalty
of terrible disaster this demand must
be refused. The ships must be kept
together and their objective made the
enemy's fleet. If fortifcations are suf
ficiently strong no modern navy will
venture to attack them so long as the
foe has in existence a hostile -navy of
anything like the same size or efficien
cy. But unless there exists such a
navy then the fortifications are power
less by themselves to secure the vic
tory, for of course the mere deficiency
means that any resolute enemy can
at his leisure combine all his forces
upon one point with the certainty that
he cain take it.
Until our battle fleet Is much larger
than at present It should never be split
into detachments so far apart that they
could not in event of emergency be
speedily united. Our coast line is on
the Pacific just as .much as on the At
lantic. The interests of California,
Oregon and Washington are as em
phatically the Interests of the whole
Union as those of Maine and New
York, of Louisiana and Texas. The
battle fleet should now and then be
moved to the Pacific, just as at other
times it sho'i!d he kept in the Atlant-c.
When the Istlmfan ~fdiat Is tl.fr: e
transit of the battle fleet from one
ocean to the other will be comparative
ly easy. Until it is built I earnestly
hope that the battle fleet will be thus
shifted between the two oceans every
year or two. The marksmanship on
all our ships has improved phenome
nally during the last five years. Until
withi.i the lanst two or three years it
was not possible to train a battle fleet
in squadron maneuvers under service
conditions, and it is only during these
last two or three years that the train
ing under these conditions has beconme
really effective. Another and most
necessary stride in advance is now be
Ing taken. The battle fleet is abtut
starting by the strait of Magellan to
visit the Pacific coast. Sixteen bat
tleships are going under the command
of Rear Admiral Evans, while eight
armored cruisers and two other battle
ships will meet him at San Francisco,
whither certain torpedo destroyers are
also going. No fleet of such size has
ever made such a voyage, and it will
be of very great educational use to
-all engaged in it. The only way by
which to teach officers and men how
to handle the fleet so as to meet. every
possible strain and emergency In time
of war is to have them practice under
..lmilar onditioas in time .of .-.
ilE-'eoV6It,the idy way to afnd otfour
actual needs is to perform in time o1
peace whatever maneuvers might be
necessary in time of war. After war
is declared it is too late to find out the
needs. That -means to invite disaster.
This trip to the Pacific will show what
some of our needs are and will enable
us to provide for them. The proper
place for an officer to learn his duty -is
at sea, and the only way- in which a
navy can ever be made efficient is by
practice at sea under all the conditions
which would have to be met if ,war
existed.
NAVAL PERSONNEL.
Promotion of Officers by Strict Seniority
Not a Good Principle.
I bespeak the most liberal treatment
for the officers and enlisted men of
the navy. .t is true of them, as like
wise of the officers and enlisted men
of the army, that they form a body
whose interests should be close to the
heart of every good American. In
return the most rigid performance of
duty should be exacted from them.
The reward should be ample when
they do their best, and nothing less
than their best should be tolerated. It
is idle to hope for the best results
when the men in the senior grades
come to those grades late in life and
serve too short a time in them. Up to
the rank of lieutenant commander pro
motion in the navy should be as now,
by seniority, subject, however, to such
rigid tests as would eliminate the un
fit. After the grade of lieutenant com
mander-that is, when we come to the
grade of command rank-the unfit
should be eliminated in such manner
that only the conspicuously fit would
remain, and sea service should be a
principal test of fitness. Those who
are passed by should after a certain
length of service in their respective
grades be retired. Of a given number
of men it may well be that almost all
would make good lieutenants and
most of them good lieutenant com
manders, while only a minority will
be fit to be captains and but three or
four to be admirals. Those who ob
ject to promotion otherwise than by
mere seniority should reflect upon the
elementary fact that no business in
private life could be successfully man
aged if those who enter at the lowest
rungs of the ladder should each in
turn if he lived become the head of
the firm, its active director, and retire
after he had held the position a few
months. On its face such a scheme is
an absurdity. Chances for improper
favoritism can be minimized by a
properly formed board, such as the
board of last June which did such con
scientious and excellent work in elim
ination.
If all that ought to be done cannot
now be done, at least let a beginning
be made. In my last three annual
messages and in a special message to
the last congress the necessity for leg
islation that will cause officers of the
line of the navy to reach the grades
of captain and rear admiral at less ad
vanced ages and which will cause them
to have more sea training and ex
perience in the highly responsible du
ties of those grades, so that they may
become thoroughly skillful in handling
battleships, divisions, squadrons and
fleets in action, has been fully explain
ed and urgently recommended. Upon
this subject the secretary of the navy
has submitted detailed and definite
recommendations which have received
my approval and which if enacted in
to law will accomplish what is imme
diately necessary and will, as compar
ed with existing law, make a saving
of more than $5.000,000 luring the next
seven years. The navy personnel act
of 1899 has accomplished all that was
expected of it in providing satisfactory
periods of service in the several sub
ordinate grades, from the grade of en
sign to the grade of lieutenant com
mander, but the law Is inadequate in
the upper grades and will continue to
be inadequate on account of the ex
pansion of the personnel since its en
actment. Your attention is Invited to
the following quotations from the re
port of the personnel board of 1906, of
which the assistant secretary of the
navy was president:
"Congress has authorized a consider
able increase in the number of mid
shipmen at the Naval academy, and
these midshipmen upon graduation are
promoted to ensign and lieutenant (Jun
lor grade). But no provision has been
made for a corresponding increase in
the upper grades, the result being that
the 16wer grades will become so con
gested that a midshipman now in one
of the lowest classes at Annapolis may
possibly not be promoted to lieutenant
until he is between forty-five and fifty
years of age. So it will continue un
der the present law, congesting at the
top and cogesting at the bottom. The
country fals to get from the officers
of the service the best that is in them
by not providing opportunity for their
hormal development and training. The
board believes that this works a seri
ous detriment to the efficiency of the
navy and is a real menace to the pub
lic safety."
As stated in my special message to
the last congress, "I am firmly of the
opinlon that. unless the r4 t 'ondi
tron of tie hfglier c6ofirssiibietd per
sonnel is rectified by judicious legisla
tion the future of our navy will be
gravely compromised." It is also ur
,ently necessary to increase the effi
ciency of the medfcal corps of the
navy. Special legislation to this end
has already been proposed, and I trust
it may be enacted without delay.
It must be remembered that every
thing done in the navy to fit it to do
well in time of war must be done in
time of peace. Modern wars are,short.
They do not last the length of time
requisite to build a battleship, and it
takes longer to train the officers and
men to do well on a battleship than it
takes to build it. Nothing effective
can he done for the navy once war has
begun, and the result of the war, if the
combatants are otlhrw\i.se equally
matched, will w 'pll nri upon which pow
er has l~epared best in time of peace.
The United States navy is the besi
guaranty the nation has that Its honor
and interest will not be neglected, and
in addition it osfers by far the besi
insuriance for peace that can by humar
ingenuity be devised.
I call attention to the report of the
ofcelal board of visitors to the Nava
academy at Annapolis, which has beer
-forwarded to the congress. The report
eontains this paragraph:
"nech revision should be made of the
ounses of study and methods of con
ducting and marking examinations as
will develop and bring out the average
all round ability of the midshipman
rather than to give him prominence in
any one particular study. The fact
should be kept in mind that the Naval
academy is not a university, but a
school, the primary object of which is
to educate boys to be efficient naval of
ficers. Changes in curriculum, there
fore, should be in the direction of mak
ing the course of instruction less theo
retical and more practical. No portion
of any future class should be gradu
ated in advance of the full four years'
course, and under no circumstances
should the standard of instruction be
lowered. The academy in. almost all
of its departments is now magnificent
ly equipped, and it would be very un
wise to make the course of instruction
less exacting than it is today."
Acting upon this suggestion, I desig
nated three seagoing officers, Captain
Richard Wainwright, Commander Rob
ert S. Griffin and Lieutenant Com
mander Albert L. Key, all graduates
of the academy, to investigate condi
tions and to recommend to me the
best method of carrying into effect
this general recommendation. These
offcers performed the duty promptly
and intelligently, and under the per
sonal direction of Captain Charles J.
Badger, superintendent of the acad
emy, such of the proposed changes as
were deemed to be at present advis
able were put into effect at the begin
ning of the academic year, Oct. 1 last.
The results, I am confident, will be
most beneficial to the academy, to the
midshipmen and to the navy.
" Foreign Affairs.
In foreign affairs this country's
steady policy is to behave toward oth
er nations as a strong and self respect
ing man should behave toward the
other men with whom he is brought
into contact. In other words, our aim
is disinterestedly to help other na
tions where such help can be wisely
given without the appearance of med
dling with what does not concern us.
to be careful to act as a good neigh
bor and at the same time in good na
tured fashion to make it evident that
we do not intend to beimposed upon.
THE, UAlIJE.
What the Second International Peace
Conerence Accomplished.
The second international peace con
ference was convened at The Hague
on the 15th of June last and remained
in session until the 18th of October.
For the first time the representatives
of practically all the civilized coun
tries of the world united in a temper
ate and kindly discussion of the meth
ods by which the causes of war might
be narrowed and its injurious effects
reduced.
Although the agreements reached in
the conference did not in any direction
go to the length hoped for by the more
sanguine, yet in many directions im
portant steps were taken, and upon
every subject on the programme there
was such full and considerate discus
sion as to justify the belief that sub
stantial progress has been made to
ward further agreements in the future.
Thirteen conventions were agreed
upon, embodying the definite conclu
sions which had been reached, and res
olutions were adopted marking the
progress made in matters upon which
agreement was not yet sufficiently
complete to make conventions practi
cable.
The delegates of the United States
were instructed to favor an agreement
for obligatory arbitration, the estab
lishment of a permanent court of arbi
tration to proceed judicially In the
hearing and decision of international
causes, the pfohibition of force for the
collection of contract debts alleged to
ba due from governments to citizens of
other countries until after arbitration
as to the justice and amount of the
debt and the time and manner of pay
ment, the immunity of private proper
ty at sea, the better dainition of the
rights of neutrals and. In case any
measure to that end should be intro
duced, the limitation of armaments.
In the field of peaceful disposal of in
ternational differences several impor
tant advances were made. First, as to
obligatory arbitration. Although the
conference failed to secure a ý ym
mous agreement upon the details of a
convention for obligatory arbitration,
it did resolve as follows:
"It is unanimous (1) in accepting
the principle for obligatory arbitra
tIon; (2) in declaring that certain dif
ferences, and notably those relating to
the interpretation and application of
International conventional stipulations,
are susceptible of being submitted to
obligatory arbitration without any re
striction."
In view of the fact that as a result
of the discussion the vote upon the
definite treaty of obligatory arbitra
tion which was proposed stood 82 in
favor to 9 against the adoption of the
treaty there can be little doubt that
the great majority of the countries of
the world have reached a point where
they are now ready to apply practically
the principles thus unanimously agreed
upon by the conference.
The second advance, and a very great
one, is the agreement which relates to
the use of force for the collection of
contract debts. Your attention is in
vited to the paragraphs upon this sub
ject in my message of December, 1900,
and to the resolution of the third Amer
ican conference at Rio in the summer
of 1906. The convention upon this
subject adopted by the conference sub
stantially as proposed by the American
delegates is as follows:
"In order to avoid between nations
armed conflicts of a purely pecuniary
origin arising from contractual debts.
claimed of the government of one coun
try by the government of another coun
try to be due to its nationals the sig
natory powers agree not to have re
course to armed force for the collec
tion of such contractual debts.
"However, this stipulation shall not
be applicable when the debtor state
refuses or leaves unanswered an offer
to arbitrate or. in case of acceptance.
makes it impossible to formulate the
terms of submission or after arbitra
tion fails to comply with the award
rendered.
"It is further agreed that arbitratio.1
here contemplated shall be in con
formity as to procedure with chaipte:
3 of the convention for the pacifle
settlement 6o "Wternatiohal ~diputes
adopted at The Hague and that it shall
determine in so far as there shall be no
agreement between the parties the jus
lice and the amount of the debt, the
time and mode of payment thereof."
Such a provision would have prevent
ed much Injustice and extortion in the
past, and I cannot doubt that its effect
In the future will be most salutary.
A third advance has been made in
amending and perfecting the conven
tion of 1899 for the voluntary settle
ment of international disputes and par
ticularly the extension of those parts
of that convention which relate to
commissions of inquiry. The existence
of those provisions enabled the govern
ments of Great Britain and Russia to
avoid war notwithstanding great pub
lic excitement at the time of the Dog
ger bank incident, and the new conven
tion agreed upon by the conference
gives practical effect to the experience
gained in that inquiry.
Substantial progress was also made
toward the creation of a permanent
judicial tribunal for the determination
of International causes. There was
very full discussion of the proposal for
such a court, and a general agreement
was finally reached In favor of its
creation. The conference recommend
ed to the signatory powers the adop
tion of a draft upon which it agreed
for, the organization of the court, leav
ing to be determined only the method
by which the judges should be select
ed. This remaining unsettled question
is plainly one which time and good
temper will solve.
A further agreement of the first im
portance was that for the creation of
an international prize court. The con
stitution, organization and procedure
of such a tribunal were provided for
in' detail. Any one who recalls the in
justices under which this country suf
fered as a neutral power during the
early part of the last century cannot
fail to see in this provision for an In
ternational prize court the great ad
vance which the world is making to
ward the substitution of the rule of
reason and justice in place of simple
force. Not only will the international
prize court be the means of protecting
the Interests of neutrals, but it is in
itself a step toward the creation of the
more general court for the hearing of
international controversies to which
reference has just been made. The or
ganization and action of such a prize
court cannot faill to accustom the dif
ferent countries to the submission of
international questions to the decision
of an international tribunal, and we
may confidently expect the results of
such submission to bring about a gen
:ral agreement upon the enlargement
of the practice.
Numerous provisions were adopted
for reducing -the evil effects of war
and for defining the rights and duties
of neutrals.
The conference also provided for
the holding of a third conference with
in a period similar to that which
elapsed between the first and second
conferences.
The delegates of the 'United States
worthily represented the spirit of the
American people and maintained with
fidelity and ability the policy of our
government upon all the great ques
tions discussed in the conference.
The report of the delegation, togeth
er with authenticated copies of the
conventions signed, when received will
be laid before the senate for its consid
eration.
When we remember how difficult it
is for one of our own legislative bodles
composed of citizens of the same coun
try, speaking the same language, liv
Ing under the same laws and having
the same customs, to reach an agree
ment or even to secure a majority up
on any difficult and important subject
which is proposed for legislation it
becomes plain that the representatives
of forty-five different countries, speak
ing many different languages, accus
tomed to different methods of proce
dure, with widely diverse interests.
who discussed so many different sub
jects and reached agreements upon so
many, are entitled to grateful apprecia
tion for the wisdom, patience and mod
eration with which they have discharg
ed their duty. The example of this
temperate discussion and the agree
ments and the efforts to agree among
representatives of all' the nations of
the earth, acting with universal recog
nition of the supreme obligation to
promote peace, cannot fail to be a
powerful influence for good in future
International relations,
Cuba.
A year ago in consequence of a revo
lutionary movement in Cuba which
threatened the immediate return to
chaos of the island the United States
intervened, sending down an army and
establishing a provisional government
under Governor Magoon. Absolute
quiet and prosperity have returned to
the island because of this action. We
are now taking steps to provide for
elections in the island, and our ex
pectation is within the coming year to
be able to turn the island over again
to a government chosen by the people
thereof. Cuba is at our doors. It is
not possible that this nation should
permit Cuba again to sink into the con
dition from which we rescued it. All
that we ask of the Cuban people is that
they be prosperous, that they govern
themselves so as to bring content, or
der and progress to their island, the
Queen of the Antilles, and our only
interference has been and will be to
help them achieve these results.
TOKYO EXPOSITION.
An Opportunity to Display Our Friend.
ship For Japan.
An invitation has been extended by
Japan to the government and people o;
the Upited States to participate in a
great national exposition to be held at
Tokyo from April 1 to Oct. 31, 1912.
and in which the principal countries
of the world are to be invited to take
.part. This is an occasion of special in
terest to all the nations of the world
and peculiarly so to us, for it is the
first instance in which such a great na
tional exposition has been held by a
great power dwelling on the Paciic,
and all the nations Otf Europe and
America will, I trust, join In helping
to success this first great exposition
ever held by a great nation of Asia.
The geographical relations of Japan
and the United States as the possessors
of such large portions of the coasts of
I the Pacific, the intimate trade relations
I lready existing between the two coun
thes. Tlbe warm i endibjp w*blch bas
been maintained between them with
out break since the opening of Japan to
intercourse with the western nations
and her increasing wealth and produc
tion, which we regard with hearty
good will and wish to make the occa
sion of mutually beneficial commerce,
all unite in making it eminently desir
able that this invitation should be ac
cepted. I heartily recommend such
legislation as will provide in generous
fashion for the representation of this
government and its people In the pro
posed exposition. Action should be
taen now. We are apt to underesti
mate the time necessary for prepara
tion in such cases. The invitation to
the French exposition of 1900 was
brought to the attention of the con
gress by President Cleveland in De
cember, 1895, and so many are the de
lays necessary to such proceedings that
the period of four years and a halt
which then intervened before the ex
position proved none too long for the
proper preparation of the exhibits.
SGerman Tariff Agreement.
The adoption of a new tariff by Ger
many, accompanied by conventions for
reciprocal tariff concessions between
that country and most of the other
countries of continental Europe, led
the German government to give the
notice necessary to terminate the re
ciprocal commercial agreement with
this country proclaimed July 18, 1900.
The notice was to take effect on the
1st of March, 1906, and in default of
some other arrangements this would
have left the exports from the United
States to Germany subject to the gen=
eral German thrifr duties, from 25 to
50 per cent higher than the conven
tional duties imposed upon the goods
of most of our competitors for German
trade.
Under a special agreement made be
tween the two governments in Febrn
ary, 1906, the German government
postponed the operation of their notice
until the 30th of June, 1907. In the
meantime, deeming it to be my duty to
make every possible effort to prevent
a tariff war between the United States
and Germaby arising from misunder
standing by either country of the con
ditions existing in the other and act
ing upon the invitation of the German
government, I sent to Berlin a com
mission composed of competent ex
perts in the operation and administra
tion of the customs tariff from the de
partments of the treasury and com
merce and labor. This commission was
engaged for several months in confer
ence with a similar commission ap
pointed by the German government
under instructions so far as practica
ble to reach a common understanding
as to all the facts regarding the tariffs
of the United States and Germany ma
terial and relevant to the trade rela
tions between the two countries. The
commission reported, and upon the ba
sis of the report a further temporary
commercial agreement was entered in
to by the two countries, pursuant to
which in the exercise of the authority
conferred upon the president by the
third section of the tariff act of July
24, 1897, I extended the reduced tariff
rates provided for in that section to
champagne and all other sparkling
wTneiiiinC puTSuant to wnam tar 6o- I
man conventional or minimum tariff
rates were extended to about 96% per
cent of all the exports from the Unit
ed States .to Germany. This agree
ment is to remain in force until the
80th of June, 1908, and until six
months after notice by either party to
terminate it.
The agreement and the report of the
commission on which it is based will
be laid before the congress for its in
formation.
This careful examination Into the tar
iff relatTons between thie UniTfed S`Tafes
and Germany involved an inquiry into
certain of our methods of administra
tion which had been the cause of much
complaint on the part of German ex
porters. In this inquiry I became sat
istfied that certain vicious and unjusti
fiable practices had grown up in our
customs administration. notably the
practice of determining values of Im
ports upon detective reports never diW
closed to the persons whose interests
were affected. The use of detectives,
though often necessary, tends toward
abuse and should be carefully guard
e'd. Under our practice as I found it
to exist in the case the abuse had be
come gross and discreditable. Under
it instead of seeking information as to
the marl:et value of merchandise from
the well known and respected mem
bers of the commercial community in
the .country of its production secret
statements were obtained from inform
ers and discharged employees and busl
ness rivals. and upon this kind of se
cret eviden'e the values of imported
goods were frequently raised and heavy
penalties wvre frequently imposed upon
importers. wvho were never permitted
to know w:iat the evidence was and
who never !1ad an opportunity to meet
it. It is quite probable that this sys
tem tended toward an increase of the
duties collected upon imported goods,
but I conceive it to be a violation of
law to exact more duties than the law
provides. just as it is a violation to ad
mit goolds upon the payment of less
than the legal rate of duty. This prac
tice was repugnant to the spirit of
American law and to American sense
of justice. In the judgment of the
most competent experts of the treas
ury department and the department of
commerce and labor it was wholly un
necessary for the due collection of the
customs revenues, and the attempt tc
defend it merely illustrates the demor
alization which naturally follows from
a long continued course of reliance
upon such methods. I accordingly
.caused the regulations governing this
branch of the customs service to be
modified so that values are determined
upon a hearing in which all the par
ties interestc:l have an opportunity to
be heard and to know the evidence
against them. Moreover, our treasury
agents are accredited to the govern
ment of the country in which they
seek information and in Germany re
ceive the assistance of the quasi ofi
cial chambers of commerce in deter
mining the actual market value of
goods in accordance with what I am
advised to be the true construction of
the law.
These changes of regulations were
adapted to the removal of such mani
test abuses that I have not felt that
they ought to be confined to our rela
tions with Germany, and I have ex
tended their operation to all other
countries which have expressed a de
sire to enter into similar administrative
relations.
China.
I, ask for authority to reform the
agreement with China under which the
indemnity of 1900 was fixed by remit
ting and cancelling the obligation of
Chitna for the payment of all that part
of the stipulated indemnity which is
in excess of the sum of $11,655,492.60

000.000, and China paid up to and in
cluding the 1st day of June last a little
over $6.000.100. It was the first inten
tion of this government at the proper
time when all claims had been pre
sented and all expenses ascertained as
fully as possible to revise the estimates
and account and as a proof of sincere
friendship for China voluntarily to re
lease that country from its legal liea
bility for all payments in excess of the
sum which should prove to be neces
sary for actual indemnity to the Unit
ed States and its citizens.
Chinese Students.
This nation should help in every
practicable way in the education of
the Chinese people, so that the vast
and populous empire of China may
gradually adapt itself to modern con
ditions. One way of doing this is by
promoting the coming of Chinese stu
dents to this country and making it at
tractive to them to take courses at our
universities and higher educational In
stitutions. Our educators should, so
far as possible, take concerted action
toward this end.
ROOT'S VISIT TO MXICO.
Evidences of Our Cordial Relations With
Our Southern Neighbors.
On the courteous invitation of the
president of Mexico, the secretary of
state visited that country in Septem
ber and October and was received ev
erywhere with the greatest kindness
and hospitality.
He carried from the government of
the United States to our southern
neighbor a message of respect and
good will and of desire for better ac
quaintance and increasing friendship.
The response from the ,overnment and
the people of Mexic6 i'hs hearty and
sincere. No pains were spared to
manifest the most friendly attitude and
feeling toward the United States.
In view of the close neighborhood of
the two countries the relations which
exist between Mexico and the United
States are just cause for gratification.
We have a common boundary of over
1,500 miles from the gulf of Mexico to
the Pacific. Much of it is marked only
by the shifting waters of the Rio
Grande. Many thousands of Mexicans
are residing upon our side of the line,
and it is estimated that over 40,000
Americans are resident in Mexican ter
ritory and that American investments
lini Mexxeo amouni to over *KO000, .
The extraordinary industrial and com
mercial prosperity of Mexico has been
greatly promoted by American enter
prise, and Americans are sharing
largely in its results. The foreign
trade of the republic already exceeds
$240,000,000 per annum, and of this
two-thirds both of exports and imports
are exchanged with the United States.
Under these circumstances numerous
questions necessarily arise between the
two countries. These questions are al
ways approached and disposed of in a
spirit of mutual courtesy and fair deal
ing. Americans carrying on business
in Mexico testify uniformly to the
kindness and consideration with which
they are treated and their sense of the
security of their property and enter
prises under the wise administration
of the great statesman who has so
long held the office of chief magistrate
of that republic.
The two governments nave peen unit
ing their efforts for a considerable time
past to aid Central America in attain
ing the degree of peace and order
which have made possible the pros
perity of the northern parts of the con
tinent.' After the peace between Guate
mala, Honduras and Salvador, celebrat
ed under the circumstances described
in my last message, a new war broke
out between the republics of Nicara
gua, Honduras and Salvador. The ef
fort to compose this new difficulty has
resulted in the acceptance of the joint
suggestion of the presidents of Mexico
and of the United States for a general
peace conference between all the coun
tries of Central America. On the 17th
day of September last a protocol was
signed between the representatives of
five Central American countries ac
credited to this government agreeing
upon a conference to be held in the
city of Washington "in order to devise
the means of preserving the good re
lations among said republics and
bringing about permanent peace in
those countries." The protocol in
cludes the expression of a wish that
the presidents of the United States and
Mexico should appoint "representatives
to lend their good and impartial offices
in a purely friendly way toward the
realization of the objects of the con
ference." The conference is now in
session and will have our best wishes
and where it is practicable our friend
ly assistance.
Bureau of American Republica.
One of the results of the pan-Amer
ican conference at Rio Janeiro in the
summer of 1906 has been a great in
crease in the activity and usefulness
of the international bureau of Amer
ican republics. That institution, which
includes all the American republics in
its membership and brings all their
representatives together, is doing a
really valuable work in informing the
people of the United States about the
other republics and in making. the
United States known to them. Its ac
tion is now limited by appropriations
determined when it was doing a work
on a much smaller scale and rendering
much less -valuable service. I recom
mend that the contribution of this gov
ernment to the expenses of the bureau,
be made commensurate with its In
eeased work.

Washington, Dec. 3.-The annual
message of President Roosevelt was
read today in both houses of congress
and practically no business was at
tempted by either body beyond listen
ing to the message.
The galleries of both senate and
house were crowded at the beginning
of the session of each body, but as
the reading progressed, the attend
ance diminished somewhat. In the
main, however, it was well maintained
until the last sentence of the docu
ment had fallen from the lips of the
official readers.
Both the senate and house ad
journed almost immediately after the
conclusion of the reading of the mes
sage. The house adjourned until
Thursday, when it is probable it will
again adjourn for the week.
SESSION OF THE HOUSE.
Message of Congratulation Received
From Oklahoma Legislature.
Washington, Dec. 3.-The house of
representatives assembled today with
but one object, namely, to listen to
the reading of the president's mes
sage and adjourn. The galleries
showed that the interest of the pub
lic was almost as great as on the
opening day.
Mr. Payne of New York, from the
committee appointed to notify the
president that congress was ready to
receive any communication he might
wish to make, reported that a mes
sage would soon be sent to the house.
The speaker then read a telegram
from the Oklahoma legislature to the
house of representatives:
"Oklahoma's first state legislar
ture," it stated, "just organized, in
spired by the fond reality of local self
government, sends greeting to the
present Sixtieth congress of the
greatest nation on earth and conveys
to her sister states a message of
progress and prosperity and loyal de
votion to the union and the common
good."
As the speaker concluded the house
broke into applause. A recess was
then taken until 12:30 p. m. On re
convening the president's message
was laid before the house and its
reading was begun by the clerk,
Printed copies of the document were
distributed among the members, who
made a close scrutiny of the message
while the reader plodded along.
The reading of the president's mes
sage was concluded in the house at
2:17 p. m. and the speaker announced
his appointment of the committee on
banking and currency with Mr 'ow
ler, its former chairman, continuing
in that position.
Upon the conclusion of the reading
of the president's message, on motion
of Mr. Payne of New York, it was re
ferred to the committee of the whole
and ordered printed. The house ad
journed until Thursday next.
SESSION OF THE SENATE.
Reading of the President's Message
Takes Up the Session.
Washington, Dec. 3.-The annual
message of the president of the Unit
ed. States was received by the senate
at 1:43 this afternoon, and within a
minute Secretary Bennet had begun
its reading. The message was pre
sented to the senate by Assistant
Secretary to the President Latta, who
had Senators Allison and Teller, the
committee which had made the cues
tomary call upon the president "We
have called upon the president," said
the venerable senator, from Iowa,
standing in the center aisle beside
the equally venerable senator from
Colorado, in low and impressive
tones, "and he informs us that he
will communicate with the senate in
writing immediately."
"A message from the president of
the United States," announced Latta,
distinctly, as the committee parted to
permit the introduction of the presi.
dent's report. The document was
brought forward to the desk of the
vice president, and as soon as the
wrapping could be removed it was
laid before the senate.
The secretary read with delibera
tion and distinctness and was followed
closely by many of the senators, who
held printed copies of the message in
their hands. The galleries were
crowded and many of the visitors
also closely listened.
