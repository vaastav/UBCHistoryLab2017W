Tumulty's First Report of
Settlement- Corrected
Contempt Cases Held Over
for One Week.
A United Press dispatch quoting
Secretary Tumulty as saying that a
settlement of the coal strike had been
reached by the convention of the
miners' representativs at Tndianapo
lis this afternoon reached the Missou
rian at 3 o'clock this afternoon. Lat
er dispatches modified the sense of
this message, hut all indications point
to the early acceptance by the min
ers of President Wilson's plan for a
settlement and for immediate resump
tion of work in the coal fields. .
Secretary Tumulty made public this
message to President Wilson from A.
Mitchell Palmer, Attorney General,
now at Indianapoils:
"Contempt, proceedings continued
one week. Miners agree to Presi
dent's plans."
A few minutes after giving out
this message Secretary Tumulty call
ed in the newspaper men and said
the telegram should have read:
"Contempt proceedings continued
one week. Miners meet at 2 o'clock
and in my opinion will accept the
President's plan." .
Miners representatives leaving the
meeting at 3 o'clock said there was
no indication of an early agreement.
Every indication, however, points to a
settlement of the strike today.
To Resume Work at Once.
By United Press.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Dec. 9.
President Wilson's proposal for set
tlement of the strike of bituminous
coal miners submitted here this aft
ernoon to a conference of leaders of
the United iline Workers by Acting
President John L. Lewis contained
ilrtj -following provisions:
Immediate resumption of work by
the miners.
Wage increases of 14 per cent im
mediately effective.
Appointment of a commission with
power to investigate the entire coal
industry and make recommendations
for reorganization, including increas
ed wages and shorter .hours for min
ers and increased prices for consum
ers, if such steps are deemed justified
and necessary.
Hearings on Charges Continued.
Hearings on charges of contempt of
court filed against leaders of the unit
ed Mine Workers of America were
continued today until next Tuesday
in view of the prospective ending of
the coal strike today.
The grand jury investigation of in
formation, charging violation of tne
Lever Act by mine operators and
trnrlrprR nostDoned yesterday, was
continued until December 17".
When the contempt cases were call
ed hefore thefederal court, Judge C.
B. Ames, assistant United States attor
ney general, asked Judge A. B. Ander
son to contlnuue the hearings, be
cause of the meeting of the miners
this afternoon.
Government Expects Action.
"The government confidently ex
pects steps to be taken at this meet
ing wihlch will fully and completely
comply with the court order," he said.
Judge Ames made it evident that
the government had in no way chang
ed its position with regard to pro
ceedings and still believes the facts
justify bringing the charges.
Before the court session opened, at
torneys for both miners and the gov
ernment were in conference with
Judge Anderson.
.The big question before the miners
before the meeting was whether or
not the operators would agree to the
basis of the proposals. Indications
were that the proposals had been
submitted to the mine operators and
that they had agreed to them, although
no public" announcement here has
been made.
Endiof Striie3Is In Sight.
The end of the coal strikers be
lieved in sieht as the executive heads
of the miners gathered to consider
President Wilson's proposal ror set
tlement of the strike. That the men
wIHtart back to work this week' and
that 'thR normal DrodUCtion Of coal
will be resumed next week Is the be
lief of leaders here.

I LODGE PLAN
Wilson Also Claims FalJ Res
solution on Mexico Is
Unconstitutional.
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. Republi
can leaders in the Senate believed to:
day that President Wilson would op
pose any effort to arrange a program
of compromise reservations on the
Peace Treaty and that he would con
sider unconstitutional any attempt to
end the war by he passage of the
Lodge resolution, or the Tinkham res
olution in the House.
Republicans said they saw evidence
of this attitude In the President's let
ter to Senator Fall with regard to
Mexico, saying that It is unconstitu
tional for Congress to initiate any
move relative to foreign problems.
Commenting on the President's let
ter, Senator Lodge said, "President
Wilson went too far."
Senator Fall said, "There is noth
ing in the constitution which requires
that relations with foreign powers
should be limited to the chief execu
tive."
L'AND BRINGS $451 AT ACRE
Tract Near Boonville Sold for Record
Price Recently.
The advance in the price of land' in
this section of Missouri continues,
$454 an acre having been paid for a
tract of land near Boonville recently.
This nrice established a record for
farm land In this part of Missouri.
There was an unprecented land
boom in Boone County this spring
and summer, in the neighborhood of
Centralia especially. While much of
the land brought from $200 to $300 an
acre, .according to fertility, improve
ment and nearness to town, -none of
it reached the figure established at
Boonville.
The Boonville farm which brought
a record price was bought from Sam
H. Hickam by Spieler Brothers, rais
er's of fine Poland-China hogs. The
place is well improved and lies at the
end of the rock road leading to Boon
ville. The sixty-two acres of land in
the farm brought .$28,000.
Dean Isldor Loeb a Delegate.
"Dr. Isidor Loeb, dean of the School
of Business and Public Administra

the week. It will be prepared from
products from the University Farm.
A prize bullock will be killed to fur
nish the beef. The milk, cheese and
Ice cream will be furnished by the
dairy department, fruit by the horti
cultural department and honey by the
entimology department.
Instruction Each Bay.
A school of Instruction or a series'
of short courses will be given ea&i
day from 8:30 o'clock in the morn
ing to 3 o'clock in the afternoon. All
laboratories, class rooms, and work
rooms will be thrown open for the
entire week. All the energies of ev
erybody, In the college will be given
to Instruction and demonstration
work.
There will be special features, one
of which will be a program by the
Short Course students on the subject
of the pruning of trees. "It will be
an excellent opportunity for farmers
to see the work that is being done
by the school, to see at first hand
the equipment and to get personally
acquainted with the men, under whom
their boys are receiving their instruc
tion." said Dean Mumford,
From 3 o'clock to 5 or 6 o'clock In
the afternoon the various state com-l
mlttees will' hold" their,1 meetings amf
programs.
In the evenings the Missouri State
Board of Agriculture offers general
programs in the University Auditori
um. These will be the only meet
ings where everybody will be brought
together. A number 'pi prominent
men are listed on the program. "The
evening sessions bid fair to be the
most entertaining of any that have
been held,' said Dean Mumford.
Large Attendance Assured.
"Indications point to the largest
attendance in the history of Farm
ers' Week, and we have had as many
as 2,800 here. It will be the greatest
gathering of representative farmers
in the state, ,but we will have not
only farmers in general,-but the offi
cers and members of leading associa
tions, such as: the Missouri Corn
Growers' Association, the Missouri
Live Stock Producers' Association,
the Missouri Farm Bureau, the State
Dairymen's Association, the State
Horticulture Society, the State Farm

Four to Five Thousand Bush
els Expected From Clark
Lane Mine.
WAGONS ARE NEEDED
Transportation the Big Prob
lem Now Guitar Build
ing Without Heat.
Local coal mines are beginning to
play their part In relieving the coal
situation here. A yield of from four
to five thousand bushels from the
Clark Lane mine alone was prophesied
for this week by J. A. Hudson, in
charge of the fuel production, this
morning.
No business houses were forced to
close today although the Guitar
Building was without heat, during the
early hours this morning. Some class
rooms in Academic Hall were too cold
for work but the majority of classes
were held as usual.
During the last few days the yield
at all the local mines has increased,
and the fuel administration workers
believe if Columbia was cut off en
tirely from outside help for a short
period, the local coal, with the wood,
would save Columbia from suffering.
The great need today was for trans
portation, and teams were eagerly ac
cepted as they were volunteered to
Isadore Barth, in charge of the trans
portation work. The Collge of Agri
culture got Into the work today when
several of Its students volunteered
to -drive or chop wood. Those doing
this work were excused from all
class work.
The committee today reported Uiat
the sale of coal would probably make
it possible to repay those who had
contributed to the emergency coal
fund, but that in case it became nec
essary to have more money to carry
on the work, there would be a second
call issued in the next few days.
"There are coal slackers now," said
one of the members of the commit
tee, "just as there were national
slackers a little more than a year ago.
The man who isn't willing to be in
convenienced by lending his team
now, when the work that team might
do would save some family from suf-
f ering, is nothing but a slacker. The
comes asking for more' is just as bad!
The thing Columbia people have to
realize is that this thing is serious
and that there Is no more reason for
one of us sacrificing than another.
We'll have to all get in the game."
FUEL ORDERS DRASTIC
Go In Effect Today, as Short
rage Will Continue After
Strike Ends.
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. New and
drastic fuel regulations are effective
today under the order of Harry A.
Garfield, fuel administrator, despite
the expected termination of the coal
strike.
The order was issued, Garfield said,
because the coal shortage will con
tinue after the miners return to work.
The use of coal to manufacture heat
and light for non-essential industries
was made practically prohibitive, but
fuel for homjes was guaranteed.
The order provides that coal is to
be delivered through the railroad ad
ministration only to domestc. buyers
and those who need it In Industries es
sental to human life.
TALKS OX RESEARCH WORK

just work on motors but to any sub
ject that those present want to work
on. aiany good discoveries on tne
laws of physics and chemistry have
revealed there. There Is no central
organization there, but each works on
the sub'ject most interesting to him.
Some of the experiments were told in
detail. A year and a half was spent In
working on one detail of the X-ray.

IHKMJPLY SOON
United States Will Not Agree
solution on Mexico Is
Removes Friction.
By Uulted Press.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. The State
Department expects to receve today
Mexico's reply to the last American
note, calling for the release from the
Puebla penitentiary of William O.
Jenkins, American consular agent.
Officials beleve the trend of the re
ply will be that since Jenkins has
been released on ball, there is no fur
ther cause for friction between the
two countries. The United States
does not agree to tlfts contention.
Secretary Lansing is expected to
make public a strong condemnation
of Carranza's message, if this gov
ernment's investigation, confirms the
report that Mexico arranged for the
payment of Jenkins' ball, and thus
Carranza won his contention that the
consular agent could only be freed
on payment of bail.
The last American note was with
held from publication in the Mexican
press by order of Carranze. Accord
ing to advices here the apparent cause
was Lansing's strong censure of the
government in connection 'with the
Jenkins case.' '' v
Information received heres is that
Carranza is putting his relatives in
command of border troops and sol
diers in the ports of Mexico.

EXPLAINS X-RAY ANALYSIS
Dr. A. W. Hull of the General 'Electric
Company' Describes New. Process.
The advantage of the method of
identifying an element as well as a
compound by X-ray is in its deflnite
iness, said Dr. A. W Hull of the Gen
eral Electrl'c'Company In the lecture
on "X-ray Crystal Analysis" yester
day afternoon.
There are two ways, Doctor Hull
said, of telling an element by X-ray:
either by the spectrum in which each
element is characteristic of Itself or
by the absorption Jjent the element
possesses with the change of voltage.
All known elements have beeni thus
determined and the results show a
perfect uniform curve 'conforming
with the periodical law except three
vacancies where, Doctor Hull believes,
new elements may be soon discovered
with such tests.
But these two methods In no wise
tell the chemical composition of the
substance, Doctor Hull said A third
method is employed by the General
Electric Laboratory, In which a pho
tograph is taken of the wave pattern
of the substance under the X-ray.
(Every kind of crystal, the experi
ment shows, has a definite pattern of
its own, and" compounds of similar
nature showing the same pattern can
be determined individually hy meas
uring the distance between lines In
the pattern. This method of analy
sis is easy and sure of success because
all that is necessary is to compare the
photographs and locate the substance
Int an already constructed chart.
In describing the experiment, Doc
tor Hull said J that it is necessary to
fix only a milligram of the compound
to be analysed on the apparatus and
then leave it alone over night The
next morning the picture of .the pat
ters is taken; It takes another hour
to complete the analysis.
The lecture was accompanied with
slides. Over a hdndred students and
teachers were present
Doctor Hull Is a graduate lot Yale
University and has engaged In the
laboratory work of the General Elec
tric Company for the last three years.
He lectured here in 1910.
