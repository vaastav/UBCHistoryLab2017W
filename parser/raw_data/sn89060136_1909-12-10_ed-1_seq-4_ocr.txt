Congress convened at Washington on
Monday and President Taft’s first annual
message, a synopsis of which will
fonnd elsewhere, was read before both
bouses on Tuesday.
The message, after its editing by the
Cabinet, contained some 17,000 words,
and, it is remarked, leaves more unsaid
than said in regard to lecommendations
for radical legislation. One notable fea
ture, that favoring the establishment of
postal savings banks, a policy much
favored by the people, it is certain will
‘ ltever be carried out as long as the Aldrich
and Cannon stripe of statesmen are per
mitted to shape legislation, and only such
recommendations as find favor with these
worthies will Congress consider.
As our Washington correspondent,
who contributes weekly letters to our
columns, says, a half dozen Senators
and Representatives of the type mention
ed have controlled legislation for the past
dozen years or more, and may be able to
control it a few months longer, but the
progressive wing of the party as repre
sented by the so-called “insurgents” is
fast rallying support to its standard and
cannot much longer be held in check by
Cannon and other obstructionists, wbo
are striving desperately to retain their
grip on Congress, but see their utter and
final overthrow in the not distant future.
John G. Woolley, former Presidential
candidate on the Prohibition ticket, in
an address oefore the Sunday Evening
Clnb, of Chicago, took the ground that
the "dry” party has outlived its useful
ness and that the saloons can only be
driven ont by the united efforts of
Christian people of all parties.
"The Prohibition party did magnificent
work fora while,” said Mr. Woolley, "but
the trouble got to be that there were five
times as many Prohibitionists in the
Democratic party as in the Prohibitiou
party, and several more times as many of
them in the Republican party.
“We are going to win this fight,” he
continued, "and if you men are afraid to
jnmp into politics and tackle the saloon,
for God’s sake enfranchise your women
and let them do it,”
There is much talk about a central
bank system, and the great bankers tell
yon that it is the only thing to prevent
panics. They told you that the credit
strengthening act would prevent panics—
and it didn’t. They told you the demon
itization of silver would prevent panics—
but it didn’t. Then they told you the
gold standard would prevent panics—but
it didn’t. Then they told you various
other fairy tales—but they didn’t work.
Every act has given the banks more
power and greater profits—and that is
what they are working for. This is the
system the Aldrich and Cannon crowd
ase using every means, fair and foul,—
■•mostly foul, —to saddle onto the people,
ahd watch them do it this session of
Congress.
A federal judge has accommodatingly
granted the Standard Oil an injunction
against Oklahoma officials, restraining
them from interfering with piping out the
gas. There is no use of any more state
laws. As well do away with the expense
of state and county officials and turn over
the whole business to federal judges,
who are appointed for life and owe no
responsibility to the people.
The Bel Air Times is not in accord with
the change of program in regard to the
Farmers’ Institutes, as will be seen by
the following paragraph:
“The management of Farmers’ Insti
tutes has been placed in the bands of a
committee of the Board of Trustees of the
Agricultural College and a radical change
of policy inaugurated. A new feature is
to hold Institutes throughout the year
and not at seasons most convenient for
the farmers. Outside speakers are black
listed and the new policy contemplates
drawing on the staff of instructors of the
College to engage in a continual round of
lecture tours. Farmers may well ask,
•Who will instruct our sons at College
while the Professors are on lecture
tours?’ If the management of the Insti
tutes is to be taken out of the bands of
Director Amos the farmers would like to
know at least, why, and further that it
be placed in the hands of practical men
with ideas broader than a pin point.
There is a strong suspicion that the new
order is for junketing purposes more than
the real benefit of the farmers for whom
Institutes have been establish# along
the most approved lines in many of the
progressive States. Marylaud farmers
would do well to keep close tab on this
new move.”
WASHINGTON LETTER,
Speaker Cannon bas returned to Wash
ington prepared to do battle with the In
surgents no matter bow strong or how
numerous they may be. He bas thrown
I down the gauntlet to Senator 'Cummins,
. La Follette and Bristow, to Represen
tatives Gardiner, Murdock and Cooper
p and bas announced that he is ready to
i fight out the issue as to what a real Re-
I publican is. Speaker Cannon bo'ds that
L these Insurgents wbo voted against the
tariff bill and against the Reed rules and
! added to these votes their voices of pro
, test on the stump sboulj no lobger be
known as Republicans. He is strong in
the opinion that these men can r.ot sub
'T scribe to the cardinal principles of the
} Republican party and at the same time
criticize the protective tariff system which
t he believes is the msjor principle. He
( declares further that men who do their
, utmost to disrupt a party should have no
comfortable dwelling place within its
, ranks and for these reasons be has herald.
I ed it broadcast that it is to be a session of
war to the knife.
> The Insurgents on the other hand
r welcome this strife They claim that the
I tariff bill was a measure at variance with
Republican promises, that Uncle Joe and
his House organization do not reflect the
sentiments of the rank and file"bf Re
publican voters, that they the insurgents
i believe heartily in the prptective system
1 but not in prohibitive duties. They as
! sert further that the Republican party
t must rid itself of Speaker Cannon in
- order to be victorious in tbe coming
; Congressional campaign. Representative
f Murdock of Kansas, tbe leader of the In
surgents in the House, declares that there
t are at least forty-five Republicans wbo
t will not submit to the Speaker’s dictation
? during tbe coming session and that they
: will vote with the democrats when it is
1 necessary to overthrow Mr. Canoo#s
f “pet measures.” One of the contests
may come on the qdestion of Postal
: Savings Bank legislation while the
> amendments to the Interstate Commerce
, law are certain to furnish many trials of
1 strength.
V
Officials of the Treasury Department
who have begun tbe work of investigating
1 tbe exorbitant premiums exacted from
1 government employes by fidelity bonding
1 companies declare that a concerted effort
: will be made by these companies to
bring about the defeat of Jas. A. Tawney,
chairman of the House committee pp
Appropriations. Mr. Tawney is tbe
! author of a provision in tbe last Sundry
■ Civil bill which prohibited bonding com
-1 panies from increasing their rates to
government employes. He also is tbe
1 father of a plan to have tbe government
1 bond its own employes. Before Mr.
Tawney’s legislation became effective it
was tbe intention of many of the bonding
companies to double their rates. Because
of this activity on tbe part of Mr. Tawney
F the bonding companies have, it is under
stood, undertaken to rai£e a campaign
fund which will he used against him in
his district.
V
The members of the congressional
[ party, just returned from Panama,
, while intensely enthusiastic at tbe pro
, gress being made on the canal are un
. animous in the opinion that the Isthmus
Cana! Commission should be ablished
, and to this end they will endeavor to
effect tbe passage of the Mann bill at the
coming session of Congress. Represen
tative Mann’s measure will provide for
, abolition of the Commission and the
. appointment of a director general of tbe
’ Canal Zone who will have entire charge
of all departments, administrative, mili
tary and civil. The fact that Congress
i will probably abolish the Commission
> does not come as a surprise to those who
; are familiar with tbe incidents which
! gave it birth. While the Spooner Act,
under which the Canal is being built,
was before the Senate, Mr. Bacon, of
I Georgia, insisted on the adoption of an
p amendment providing for a commission
of seven men. Rather than endanger the
: final passage of the bill Senator Spooner
reluctantly consenUd to this amendment
i- although bis original measure did pot
, contemplate such a body. President
Roosevelt did not believe in the efficacy
of such a commission and in this opinion
President Taft concurs. Both believe
that the Canal Zone should be administer
ed directly by an official and that the
government of tbe Zone should be more
centralized. In fact, for the past two or '
’ three years Colonel Goethals has been I
the real administrator of the work. Of
the seven members of the commission, J.
C. S. Blackburn is the only civilian. The
remainder are army and navy officers
and as such are outranked by Colonel
Goethals. _ The change contemplated will
not affect the progress of the Canal but
will make a material pecuniary saving.

The President has taken op the question
‘‘What is whiskey ?” This question has
been a mooted one for some time and dis.
tillers from every section of the country
have been anxiously awaiting the Presi
dent's decision There is a volume of
testimony and data to which the Presi
dent will give thorough consideration
before announcing bis decision. The
question was discussed at numerous con
ferences during the early portion of the
present administration. Mr. Taft ap
pointed Lloyd Bowers, Solicitor General,
as arbiter in the case but when a decision
was given there was general dissatis
faction.
Why Kidney Disease Is Dangerous.
Kidney disease is dangerous because it
comes on unwares and progresses to a
fatal stage before the sufferer realizes
what the trouble is.
If you begin to run down, feel badly,
have indigestion, inactive Liver* etc , you
have reason to suspect that vour Kidneys
are affected and a special Kidney treat
ment should be taken at once. Delays
are dangerous. Rydale’s Kidney Remedy
is thebest remedy known for the Kidneys,
It never fails to restore them to health.
Rydale’s Kidney Remedy will cure
Bright’s Disease if taken before too much
of the Kidneys are destroyed. The
Remedy can do no barm if your kidneys
are not the cause of your ill-health. It
is the safest remedy if they are the cause

Eli T. Reynolds,
State Road Work.
Two features in the work of the State
Roads Commission have attracted more
than ordinary attention. One is the plan
of selecting widely separated sections in
which contracts are let and the work
carried on; the other is the apparent
difference in cost in the various localities
when it is understood the character of the
work and its dimensions are materially
the same,
In speaking of the divergent sections
now being improved Chairman Tucker, of
the commission explained it by saying
that the commission was eager to show
all the people what was in view. When
it was decided to start the work this could
only be satisfactorily done by letting
favorable contracts as they were submitted,
whether the location was in the eastern,
the middle or the 'western section of the
State.
“We have aimed to work in the begin
ning as close to the county seat as possi
ble,” he said. “We wanted to have
something to show all the citizens of our
purpose, and we appreciated the fact that
all the residents wpuld sooner or later go
to the county seats, either for business’or
pleasure, This would give eyeryone a
chance to inspect whgf had been done and
to pass judgment on it.
“In the contracts it will be noted that
we are working out from one county seat
as a central point and always toward an
other. This is so in every county except
Cecil. Therej we are taking the line of
travel which strikes us as being most
desjrable, and also because some bridge
work is to be encountered which we want
to see hurried along to be in shape for use
when the roads are ready.-
“Eypry section of road let is to be fully
completed and U ot subject £o damage at
either end pending its jpficfure wifh any
uncompleted ppition.-
“We will push the construction SO long
as the weather conditions permit- When
frost or snow comes all labor will have to
be suspended, but we will see to it that
every completed portion is reinforced and
protected from all danger and in perfect
safety for use under any weather condi
tions for either heavy or light hauling.”

New Jersey has decided in future to
build no more macadam roads. State
Commissioner Gilkynson declaring after
a series of experiments, that the only
highway to successfully withstand the
wear and tear of automobile and other
traffic, is one of asphalt binder, stone or
other mixture of this sort
The enormous growth of automobiles
upon the macadam roads of New Jersey
brought to the attention of the road de
partment the great necessity of providing
a new road surface that would be at once
dustless, water proof and hard enough to
stand the destructive effect of rapidly
driven automobiles, and yet resilient
enough to iusure comfort in riding.
New Jersey has 85 miles of bituminous
roads, with specifications drawn for 12
more. This is more than can be found
in any other State. The condition of the
roads which were completed more than a
year ago and which have gone through
the frosts of the winter and the heat of
the summer with the fast soeediug travel,
show that this new method of road con
struction has come to stay. Commis
sioner Gilkvnann contends that from
present indications it will be several
years before these roads will need re
pairing.
