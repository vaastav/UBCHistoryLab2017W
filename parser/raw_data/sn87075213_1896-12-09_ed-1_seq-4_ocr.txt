Christmas Greeting
to You
One and All.
Wo tako It for granted that your
hearts arc in tlio right placo this year,
just as they always have been in tho
past, and that you feol tho same gener
ous deslro to remember those you lovo
with appropriate and desirable Christ
mas gifts this season, as heretofore.
Wo know that in nearly every individ
ual instance there is one obstacle that
seonis to bar tho way to gift making,
and that is the scarcity of money. The
times of late have boon undeniably
hard, aud few, if any, liavo escaped the
ill effects of this unfortunate condi
tion, therefore, tho situation with you
is like this: You feel tho same old de
sire to make your relatives and friends
appropriate gifts; the feeling is just as
strong as ever, but the means at your
command seem to fall short of the
needs of the occasion. That is why we
wish to make our Holiday Announce
ment, this year, particularly a talk to
your pockot books.
Wo arc going to be tho people s San
ta Claus, this season, just as far as the
inexorable laws of business will per
mit, by selling you Christmas gifts of
all ilnds at the lowest scale of prices
known to the trade. We are going to
mako your money far-reaching and
profitable in the exchange for Christ
mas gifts. What though your dollars
aro few wo will make them go farther
than every bofore. Wo want you to
come in and see how little it takes to
securo suitable and appropriate gifts
for those you desire to remember.
For weeks past we have labored in
dustriously to prepare for the Holiday
Trade, and our store is now fairly
shining with a lieautitul array of
Christmas Gifts. Wo are strong in the
belief that every Holiday shopper who
Visits our storo will be sure to iind ir
resistible attractions among our great
variety of pretty and appropriate gifts.
Special pains aud much careful consid
eration was expended to mako the col
lection of Christmas Goods one which
should include something really desir
able for every individual, from the
youngest to tho oldest. Wo have made
it a point to have great variety in goods,
of all prices, ranging from the merest
triile upwards, in order that yon raav
mal:e gooa selections at any price you
may feel able to pay. Having thus j
smoothed the way lor nu classes 01
buyers by grading and assorting our
stock in such u wav as to meet the
needs of those who have little as well
as those who have much to spend, and
having marked nil our goods at the
loweat possible figures, we feel that
wo deserve your patronage.
Hoping to see every reader at our
storo at an early day. wo remain.
Very truly yours.

Left Over From Last Sossion for

Result of the Late Election.

Iminlerntlon lllll In tho Senate Effort
to Secure Kew Untes for ComlUera-
tluu of Special Orders Left Ovor.
Washington-, Dec 7. Roth housos
of congress mot promptly nt uoon nnd
appointed committees to wait upon tho
president aud Inform him that con
gress was ready to recoivo any com
munication he might bo pleased to
make. The senate thereupon took a
recess till 3:30 o'clock.
Tho house adjourned until 2 p. m.,
when tho president's message was re
ceived and read.
Tho messago was dclivcrod to the
senate by Mr. Frudon, one of tho presi
dent's secretaries, and tho secretary of
tho senate, Mr. Cox, began its reading,
but that duty was very soon turned
over to tho reading clerks.
Tho house presented a bright nnd
cheerful appearance Monday morning
when the galleries were thrown opon
to visitors. Tho galleries were crowded
to overflowing long before Speaker
Reed called tho house to order.
Tho members of tho house, liko the
occupants of the galleries, commenced
to put in an appearanco as early as 10
o'clock, athough tho hour of meeting
was 12. Tho republicans from the
west and middle west who secured a
renomination and were not engulfed
in tho wave of free silverism which
swept over tho commonwealth, con
gratulated themselves and each other
upon their good fortune. Mr. Crisp's
desk was draped in mourning.
After the reading of the president's
messago the message was laid on tho
tabic and the senate at 3:35 adjourned
until one o'clock Tuesday.
When tho reading of tho message
was finished in the house, the death of
Ex-Speaker Crisp was announced by
Mr. Turner (dcm.), of Georgia, Suit
able resolutions were passed and the
house adjourned until Tuesday noon.
Washington, Dee. 7. It is not likely
that anything will bo done in cither
house of congress Monday, except to
exchange congratulations or con
dolence, as the case may be, over tho
election and to listen to the president's
message. When tho lastsession closed
tho house immigration bill had, and
now has, tho right of way in the senate.
It is the unfinished business; this will
be called up pro forma at the expirn
titn of the morning hour, 2 o'clock.
Although known as the house bill on
the calendar as reported to the senato
by Mr. Lodge, it is a materially differ
ent measure, all of the houso pro
visions having been stricken out ex
cept the enacting clause and a new bill
substituted. This bill will be called
up on Tuesday by Senators Lodge and
Chandler, who desire to push it to a
vote as quickly as possible.
An eilort will be made to secure new
dates for the consideration of special
orders that were not reached during
last session. 'lhcse measures are:
Senate bill to prevent the desecration
of the American flag; house bill to
amend the act to prevent the extermi
nation of fur-bearing animals of Alas
ka; house bill to reduce tho cases in
which the penalty of death may bo in
flicted and benate joint resolution pro
posing an amendment to the constitu
tion providing for the election of sen
ators by popular vote.
An important bill, over whle'i there
has developed a bitter fight, is the De
troit bridge bill, for a bridge across
the Detroit river. It was postponed
last session until the first Monday in
December.
In addition to tho appropriation bills
there aro several measures that will
contend with others for the right of
way. Prominent among these are the
bills to refund the Pacific railroad
debt, to admit the territories of
New Mexico nnd Arizona, and Mr.
Davis' resolution relative to the asser
tion and enforcement of the Monroe
doctrine.
IN URUGUAY.
A Hoolutloimry r.Iovt-ment Alarm tho
liciveriinu'nt.
Ni;w Youk, Dec. 7. A special cable
dispatch to the Herald from Kuenos
Ay res says:
Tho Herald's correspondent in Mon
tevideo, Uruguay, telegraphs that the
government is now thoroughly
alarmed nt tho momentum which
tho revolutionary movement has
obtained. It has been learned
that tho departments in tho
northwestern part of Uruguay
Salto, Pnysondu and Artig.is, will toon I
declare in favor of the rebellion, and I
that the leaders delegated by the peo
ple of thoso departments will rendez
vous with their forces at Concordia, in
Entro Riop, Argentina, just across tho
river Uruguay.
At this point thero arc many per
sons, including not only Uuruguayans,
but citizens of Argentina, who aro in
sympathy with the revolt.
No further encounters havo occurred
in Uruguay, and it is believed that tho
insurgents aro awaiting tho new in
vasion from the Argentine frontier be
fore again risking a battle.
Tho Krazillan minister of foreign af
fairs has telegraphed assurances that
stiict neutrality will be observed by
Krazil in her sister republic's present
trouble.

ground that they may select," said Mr.
Sherman. "If they are willing to
keep their hands off until after the
mcrabors of tho general assembly havo
been elected and then mako tho
contest before them wholly, I
shall bo perfectly willing to do
that, too. Kut if It is pro
posed to go into tho counties and sot up
delegations for any senatorial candi
dates and have the stato convention se
lect tho candidate of the republican
party of Ohio, I shall meet them on
that ground, too. I am ready for any
thing. No Sherman ever sought to es
