Washington Special—Following Is a
nummary of President Taft's first annual
message which was delivered to both
bouses of congress:
After reviewing, at considerable
length the satisfactory relations be
tween the United States and European
powers, President Taft takes up the
relations between this country and
£atln-America, saying in part:
4 Protect American Capitai.
J,' Today, more than ever before, Ameri
-can capital is seeking investment in for
eign. countries, and American products
are more and more generally seeking for
eign markets. As a consequence, in all
countries there are American citizens and
American interests to be protected, on
occasion, by their government. These
movements of men, of capital, and of
commodities bring peoples and govern
ments closer together and so form bonds
of peace and mutual dependency, as they
must also naturally sometimes make
passing points of friction. The resultant
situation inevitably imposes upon this
government vastly increased responsibil
ities. This administration, through the
department of state and the foreign serv
ice, is lending all proper support to legit
imate ancL beneficial American enterprises
In- forc^gn countries, the degree of such
aupport. being measured by the national
advantages to be expected. A citizen
himself can not by contract or otherwise
divest himself of the right, nor can this
government escape the .' obligation, of his
protection in his personal and property
fights when these tire unjustly Infringed
W a foreign country. To avoid ceaseless
vexations it is proper that in consider

mine the exact truth in relation to these
reports and upon the course in the prem
ises most consistent with Its dignity, Its
duty to American interests and Tts. moral
obligations to Central America and to
civilization.
The Far East.
In tho far east this government pre
serves unchanged Its policy of support
ing the principle of equality of opportun
ity and scrupulous respect for the integ
rity of the Chinese empire, to which pol
icy are pledged the interested powers of
both east and west.
By the treaty of 1903 China has under
taken the abolition of likin with a mod
erate and proportionate raising of the
customs tariff along with currency re
form. These reforms being of manifest
advantage to foreign commerce as well
as to the Interests of China, this gov
ernment is endeavoring to facilitate these
measures and the needful acquiescence of
treaty powers. When It appeared that
Chinese likin revenues were to be hypoth
ecated to foreign bankers in connection
with a great railway project, it was ob
vious that the governments whose na
tionals held this loan would have a cer
tain direct interest in the question of the
carrying out by China of the reforms In
question. Because this railroad loan rep
resented a practical and real applica
tion of the open door policy through co
operation with China by interested pow
ers as well as because of its relations to
the reforms referred to above, the admin
istration deemed American participation
to be of great national interest. Happily,
when It was as a matter of broad policy
urgent that this opportunity should not
be lost, the Indispensable instrumentality
presented Itself when a group of Amer
ican bankers, of international reputation
and great resources, agreed at once to
share In the loan upon precisely such
terms as this government should approve.
The chief' of those terirs was that Amer
ican railway material should be upon an
exact equality with that of the other na
tionals joining In the loan in the placing
or orders for this whole railroad system.
After months of negotiation the equal
participation of Americans seems at last
assured. It Is gratifying that Americans
will thus take their share In this exten
sion of these great highways of trade,
and to believe that such activities will
give a real Impetus to our commerce and
will prove a practical corollary to our
historic policy In the far east.
In one of the Chinese-Japanese con
ventions of -September 4 of this year
there was a provision which caused con
siderable public apprehension in that
upon Its face it was believed in some
quarters to seek to establish a monopoly
or mining privileges along the South
Manchurian and Antung-Mukden rail
roads, and thus to exclude Americans
from a wide field of enterprise, to take
part in which they were by treaty with
China entitled. After a thorough exam
ination of the conventions and of the
several contextual documents, the secre
tary of state reached the conclusion that
no such monopoly was intended or ac
complished. However, In view of the
widespread discussion of this question, to
confirm the view it had reached, this
government made inquiry of the impe
rial Chinese and Japanese governments
and received from each official assurance
that the provision had no purpose incon
sistent with the policy of equality of op
portunity to which the signatories, in
common with the United States, are
pledged.
Our traditional relations with the Jap
anese empire continue cordial as usual.
The arrangement of 1908 for a co-opera
tive control of the coming of laborers to
the United States has proved to work
satisfactorily. The matter of revision of
the existing treaty between the United
States and Japan which is terminable in
1912 is already receiving the study of both
countries.
Department ef 8tate.
I earnestly recommend to the favorable
action of the congress the estimates sub
mitted by the department of state and
most especially the legislation suggested
in the secretary of state's letter of this
date whereby It will te possible to devel
op and make permanent the reorganisa
tion of the department upon modern lines
In a manner to make it a thoroughly ef
ficient Instrument in the furtherance of
our foreign trade and of American in
terests abroad.
The coninilar service has been greatly
Improved under the law of April 5. 1S06.
and«the executive order of June 27, 1906,
and I ccmmend to your consideration the
question of embodying in a statute the
principles of the present executive order
upon which the efficiency of our consular
service Is wholly' dependent.
Government Expenditures.
Perhaps the most important question
presented to this administration is that of
economy in expenditures and sufficiency
of revenue. The deficit of the last fiscal
year, aud the certain deficit of the cur
rent year, prompted congress to throw a
greater responsibility on the executive
and the secretary of the treasury than
had heretofore been declared by statute.
This declaration Imposes upon the sec
retary of the treasury the duty of assem
bling all the estimates of the executive
department's bureaus, and offices, of the
expenditures necessary In the ensuing fis
cal year, and of making an estimate of
the revenues of the government for the
same period and If a probable deficit Is
thus shown, it is made the duty of the
president to recommend the methods by
which such deficit can be met.
The report of the secretary shows that
the ordinary expenditures for the current
fiscal year ending June 30, 1910, will ex
ceed the estimated receipts by $34,075,630.
If to this deficit is added the sum to bo
disbursed for the Panama canal, amount
ing to 138,000.000, and $1,000,000 to be paid
on the public debt, the deficit of ordinary
receipts and expenditures will be In
creased to a total deficit of (73.07S.620.
This deficit the secretary proposes to
meet by the proceeds of bonds Issued to
pay the cost of constructing the Panama
canal. I approve this proposal.
The jpdlcy" of paying for the construc
tion or the Panama canal, not out of cur
rent revenue, but by bond issues, was
adopted In the Spooner act of 1902, and
there seems to be no good reason for de
parting from the principle by which a
part at least of the* burden of the cost
of the canal shall fall upon our posterity
who are to enjoy It and there is all the
more reason for this view because the
actual cost to date of the canal, which
1s now half done and which wUl be-com
pleted by January 1, IMS, ehoWk 'ttuit the
cost of engineering and construction will
be »297.766,009. Instead of S139.706.aoo, as
originally estimated. In addition to en
gineering and construction, the other ex
penses, Including sanitation and govern
ment/ and the amount paid for the prop
erties the franchise, and the privilege
of building the canal. Increase the cost
by 97B,4tS,oS, to a total of 1375,101,000. The
Increase In the cost of engineering and
construction, is due to a substantial en
largement of the plan of construction by
widening the canal 100 feet in the Cule
bra cut and by Increasing the dimensions
of the locks, to the underestimate of the
quantity of the work to be done under
rje original plan, and to an underestimate
of the cost of labor and materials both
of which have greatly enhanced in price
since the original estimate was made.
Low Estimates Made.
In order to. avoid a deficit for the ensu
ing fiscal year,, I directed the heads of de
partments in the preparation off their esti
mates to make them as low as possible
consistent with imperative governmental
necessity. The result has been, as I am
advised by the secretary of- the treasury
that the estimates of the expenses of the
June
overnment for the fiscal year ending
30, 1911—that is, for the next fiscal
year—are less by 155,663,000 than the total
of appropriations for the current fiscal
year, and less by 194,000,000 than the esti
mates for that year. So far as the secre
tary of the treasury is able to form a
Judgment as to future Income, and com-
8sealit
are with the expenditure for the next
year ending June 10, 1911, Including
the payments on account of the Panama
canal, and^ the public debt, there will be
no deficit In the year ending. June SO.
kthe
Iilatform
1911
'but a small surplus of 1714000.
In the present^ estimates the' needs of
the departments and of the government
have been cut to the quick, so to speak,
and any assumption on the part of con
gress. so often made In times past, that the
estimates have been prepared with the
expectation that they may be reduced,
will result In seriously hampering proper
administration.
It has been impossible In the prepara
tion of estimates greatly to reduce the
cost of permanent administration. Ths
can not be done without a thorough re
organization ot bureaus, offices, and de
partments. For the purpose of securing
Information which may enable the execu
tive and the legislative branches to unite
ln a plan for the permanent reduction of
the cost of governmental, "administration.
the treasury department has -Instituted
'ian.. Investigation by one of the most
skilled expert accountants In the United
•tftei,.
^mjgttralt of hls worfc la two or three
1
bureaus, which, lr extended .to the en*
tire government, must Occupy two or
more years, has been to show much room
for Improvement and opportunity for sub
stantial reductions in the .cost and in
creased efficiency of administration. The
object of the investigation is to devise
means to increase the average efficiency
of each employe. There is great room
for improvement toward this end, not
only by the reorganisation of bureaus
and departments and In the avoidance of
duplication, but also in the' treatment of
the individual employe.
Favors Civil Pensions.
More than this, every reform directed
toward the improvement in the average
efficiency of government employes must
depend on the ability of the. executive to
eliminate from the government service
those who are inefficient froin any cause,
and as the degree of efficiency in all the
departments is much lessened by the re
tention of old employes wb« have out
lived their energy and usefulness, it is
indlspenslble to any proper system of
economy that provision be made so tliat
their separation frtm the service shall
be easy and inevitable. It is impossible
to make such provision unless there is
adopted a plan of civil pensions.
Most of the great industrial organiza
tions, and many of the well conducted
railways of this country, are comlntr to
the conclusion that a system of pensions
for old employes, and the substitution
therefor of younger and more energetic
servants, promotes both economy and ef
ficiency of administration.
I am aware that there 1b a strong feel
ing in both houses of congress, and pos
sibly in this country, against the estab
lishment of civil pensions, and that this
has naturally grown out of the heavv
burden of military pensions, which it has
always been the policy of our government
to assume: but I am strongly convinced
that no other practical solution of the
difficulties presented by th^ superannu
ation of civil servants can be found than
that of a system of civil pensions.
Frauds in the Collection of Customs.
I regret to refer to the fact of the
discovery of extensive frauds In the col
lection of the customs revenue' at New
York City, in which a number of the
subordinate employes in the weighing and
other departments were directly con
cerned, and. in which the beneficiaries
were the American Sugar Refining com
pany and others. The frauds consisted
in the payment of duty on underweights
of sugar. The government has recovered
from the American Sugar Refining com
pany all that it is shown to have been
defrauded of. The sum was received in
full of the amount due, which might have
been recovered by civil suit against the
beneficiary of the fraud, but there was
an express reservation in the contract of
settlement by which the settlement
should not interfere with, or prevent the
criminal prosecution of everyone who
was found to be subject to the same.
Criminal prosecutions are now proceed
ing against a number' of the government
officers. The treasury department and
the department of justice are exerting
every effort to discover all the wrong
doers, Including the officers and em
plyes of the companies who may have
been privy to the fraud. It would seem
to me that an investigation of the frauds
by congress at present, pending the prob
ing by the treasury department ana the
department oC justice, as proposed, might
by giving Immunity and otherwise prove
an embarrassment in securing conviction
of the guilty parties.
Two features of the new tariff act call
for special reference. By virtue of the
clause known as the "Maximum and Min
imum" clause. It is the duty of| the ex
ecutive to consider the laws and prac
tices of other countries with reference to
importation into those countries of
the products and merchandise of the
United States, and if the executive finds
such lawB and practices not to be unduly
discriminatory against the United States,
the minimum duties provided In the bill
are to go into force. Unless the pres
ident makes such a finding, then the
maximum duties provided In the bill, that
Is, an increase of 25 per cent ad valorem
over the minimum duties, are to be in
force. Fear has been expressed that this
power conferred and duty Imposed on the
executive is likely to lead to a tariff war.
I b^g to express the hope and belief that
no such result need be anticipated.
The discretion granted to the executive
by the terms "unduly discriminatory" is
wide. In order that the maximum duty
shall be charged against the imports from
the country, it is necessary that he shall
find on the part of that country not only
discrimination In its laws or the practice
under them against the trade of the
United States, but that the discrimina
tions found shall be undue that Is,
without good and fair reason. I conceive
that this power was reposed in the pres
ident with the hope that the maximum
duties might never be applied In any
case, but that the power to apply them
would enable the president and the state
department through friendly negotia
tions to secure the elimination from the
laws and the practice under them of any
foreign country of that which is unduly
discriminatory. No one is seeking a tariff
war or a condition in which the spirit
of retaliation shall be aroused.
Use of Tariff Board.
The new tariff law enables me to ap
point a tariff board to assist me in con
nection with the department of state in
the administration of the minimum and
maximum clause of the act and also to
assist officers of the government In the
administration of the entire law. An ex
amination of the law and an understand
ing of the nature of the facts which
should be considered.in discharging the
functions Imposed upon the executive
show that I have the power to direct the
tariff board to make a comprehensive
glossary and encyclopedia of the terms
used and articles embraced in the tariff
law, and to secure information as to the
cost of production of such goods in this
country and the cost of their production
in foreign countries. I have therefore ap
pointed a tariff board consisting of three
members and have directed them to per
form all the duties above described. This
work will perhaps take two or three
years, and I ask congress a continuing
annual appropriation equal to that al
ready made for Its prosecution. I believe
that the work of this board will be of
prime utility and Importance whenever
congress shall deem It wise again to
readjust the customs duties. If the facts
secured by" the tariff board'are ofsuch
a.-character as to show generally thitt the
rates of duties Imposed by the present
tariff law are excessive under the princi
ples of protection as described In the
of the successful party at the
ate-election, I shall not hesitate to ln-
vlte the attention of congress to this feet
and to the necessity for action predicated
thereon. Nothing, however, halts busi
ness and interferes with the course Of
prosperity so much as the threatened re
vision of the tariff, and until the facts
are at hand, after careful and deliberate
investigation, upon Which such revision
can properly be undertaken, it seems to
me unwise to attempt it. The amount of
misinformation that creeps into argu
ments, pro and con In respect to tariff
rates is such as to require the kind of
Investigation that I have directed the:
tariff board to make, an Investigation un
dertaken by It Wholly without respect to
the effect which the facts may have In
calling for a readjustment of the rates of
duty.
War Department.
In the Interest of Immediate economy
and because of the prospect of a deficit,
I have required a reduction In the esti
mates of the war department for the
coming fiscal year, which brings the total
estimates down to an amount
145,000,000
less than the corresponding estimates for
last year. This could only be accom
plished by cutting off new projects and
suspending for the period of one .year
all progress In military matters. For the
same reason I have dlrecied that the.
army shall not be recruited up to Its.
present authorised strength.
The secretary of war calls attention to
a number of needed changes in the army
in all of which I concur, but the point
upon which I place most emphasis Is the
need for an elimination bill providing a
method by- which the merits of officers
shall have some effect upon their ad
vancement ana by which the advance
ment of all may be accelerated bythe
effective elimination of a definite nraDor
portion of the least efficient. There are
In every army, and certainly in ours. a
number of officers who do not violate
their duty lit any such way as to: give
reason tor a court-martial or dismissal,
but who do not show such aptitude-and,
skill an^c^racter_for_hiKh command.as
iw
on a certain proportion' of their~riyrin
creaslng with their length of service *t
the time of. retirement. There is now a
personnel laW for the navy which itself
-needs amendment and to which I shall
make further reference. Such a law IS
needed quite as much for the arm*.
The return of the battle ship flcet^
its voyage around the world. In more ef
ficient condition tnan when it started,
was a noteworthy event of Interest alike
to our cltlxens and the naval authorities
of the world. Besides the beneficial and
far-reaching effect on our personal and
diplomatic relations In the countries
which the fleet visited, the marked suc
cess of the ships in steaming around the
world in all weathers on schedule time
has Increased respect for our navy and
has added to our national prestige.
Our enlisted personnel recruited from
all sections of the country is young and
energetic and representative of the na
tional spirit. It is, moreover, owing to
its intelligence, capable of quick training
into the modern man-of-warsmen. Our
officers are earnest and zealous in thole
profession, but it is a regrettable fact
that the higher officers are old for the
responsibilities of the modern navy, and
the admirals do not arrive at flag rank
young enough to obtain adequate train
ing in their duties as flag officers. This
need for reform in the navy has been ably
and earnestly presented to congress by
my predecessor, and I also urgently rec
ommend the subject for consideration.
Early in the coming session a compre
hensive plan for the reorganization of the
officers of all corps of the navy will be
presented to congress, and I hope it
will meet with action suited to its ur
gency.
Expedition in Legal Procedure.
The deplorable delays in the adminis
tration of civil and criminal law have
received the attention of committees of
the American Bar association and of
many state bar associations, as well as
the considered thought of judges and
jurists. In my judgment, a change in ju
dicial procedure, with a view to reducing
it? expense to private litigants in civil
oases and facilitating the dispatch of
business and final docision in both civil
and criminal cases, constitutes the great
est need in our American institutions. I
do not doubt for one moment that muoh
ol' the lawless violence and cruelty ex
hibited in lynchings is directly due to
the uncertainties and injustice growing
out of the delays in trials, judgments and
the executions thereof by our courts. Of
course these remarks apply quite as well
to the administration of justice in state
courts as to that in federal courts, and
without making invidious distinction it Is
perhaps not too much to say that, speak
ing generally, the defects are less in the
federal courts than in the state courts.
But they are very great in the
federal courts. The expedition with
which business is disposed of both on
the civil and the criminal side of English
courts under modern rules of procedure
makes the delays in our courts seem
archaic and barbarous. The procedure in
the federal courts should furnish an ex
ample for the state courts. I presume it
is impossible, without an amendment to
the constitution, to unite under one form
of action the proceedings at ommon law
and proceedings in equity in the federal
courts, but it is certainly not impossible
by a statute,to simplify and make short
and direct the procedure both at law and
in equity in those courts. It is not im
possible to cut down still more than it is
cut down, the jurisdiction of the supreme
court so as to confine it almost wholly
to statutory and constitutional questions.
Under the present statutes the equity and
admiralty procedure in the federal courts
Is under the control of the supreme court,
but in the pressure of business to which
that court is subjected, it is impossible to
hope that a radical and proper reform of
the federal equity procedure can be
brought about. I therefore recommend
legislation providing for the appointment
by the president of a commission with
authority to examine the law and equity
procedure of the federal courts of first
instance, the law of appeals from those
courts to the courts of appeals and to the
supreme court, and the costs imposed in
such procedure upon the private litigants
and upon the public treasury and make
recommendation with a view to simpli
fying and expediting the procedure as far
as possible and making it as inexpensive
as may be to the litigant of little means.
Injunctions Without Notice.
The platform of the successful party In
the last election contained the following:
"The republican party will uphold at all
times the authority and integrity of the
courts, state and federal, and will ever
Insist that their powers to enforce their
process and to protect life, liberty,
and property shall be,preserved inviolate.
We believe, however, that the rules of
procedure in the federal courts with re
spect to the issuance of the writ of In
junction should be more accurately de
fined by statute, and that no injunc
tion cr temporary restraining order
should be issued without notice, except
where irreparable Injury would result
from delay, in which case a speedy hear
ing thereafter should be granted."
1 recommend that in compliance with
the promise thus made, appropriate leg
islation be adopted. The ends of justice
will best be met and the chief cause of
complaint against ill-considered injunc
tions without notice will be removed by
the enactment of a statute forbidding
hereafter the issuing of any injunction
or restraining order, whether temporary
or permanent, by any federal court, with
out previous notice and a reasonable op
portunity ro be heard on behalf of the
parties to be enjoined unless it shall
appear to the satisfaction of the court
that the delay necessary to give such no
tice and hearing would result in irrepar
able Injury to the complainant and unless
also the court shall from the evidence
make a written finding, which shall be
spread upon the court minutes, that im
mediate and irreparable injury is likely
to ensue to the complainant, and shall
define the injury, state why it is irrep
arable, and shall also endorse on the or
der issued the date and the hour of the
issuance of the order. Moreover, every
such injunction or restraining order Is
sued without previous notice and oppor
tunity by the defendant to be heard
should by force of the statute expire
and be of no effect after seven days from
the Issuance thereof or within any time
less than that period which the court may
fix, unless within such seven days or
such less period, the injunc»on or order
Is extended or renewed after previous no
tice and opportunity to be heard.
My judgment Is that the passage of
such. an act which really embodies the
besc practice In equity and is very like
the rule now In force In some courts
will prevent the Issuing of ill-advised or
ders of Injunction without notice and will
render such orders when Issued much less
objectionable by the short time in which
they may remain effective.
Anti-Trust Commerce Laws.
The jurisdiction of the general govern
ment over Intentate commerce has led to
the passage of the so-called "Sherman
anti-trust law" and the "Interstate com
merce law" and Its amendments. The
developments in the operation of those
laws, as shown by Indictments, trials, ju
dicial decisions, and other sources of In
formation. call for a discussion and some
suggestions as to amendments. These I
prefer to embody In a special message in
stead of including them in the present
communication, and I shall avail ipyself
of the first convenient opportunity to
bring these subjects to the attention of
congress.
Postoffice Department.
The deficit every year In the post office
department is largely caused by the low
rate .of postage of 1 cent a pound charged
on second class matl matter, which in
cludes not only newspaper* but maga
slnes and miscellaneous periodicals. The
actual loss growing out of the transmis
sion of this second class mail matter at 1
cent a pound amounts to about 163,000.000
a year. The average cost of the trans
portation of this 'matter is more than 9
cents a pound.
It appears that the average distance
over which newspapers are delivered to
their customers is 291 miles, while the
average haul of magazines Is 1,049, and
of miscellaneous peiiodicals 1,128 miles.
Ihus, the avi-rage haul of the magazine
is three and one-half times and that of
the miscellaneous periodical nearly four
limes the haul of the daily newspaper,
yet all of them pay the- same postage
ratei of 1 cent a pound. The statistics of
1907 show that second class mail matter
constituted 83.91 per cent of the weight
of all the mail, and yielded only 5.19 per
cent- of the revenue.
The figures given are startling, and
show the payment by the government of
an'enormous
subsidy to the newspapers,
magazines, and periodicals, and congress
may well consider whether radical steps
should not be taken to reduce the deficit
in ,the post office department caused by
this discrepancy between the actual cost
'of!'transportation and the compensation
exacted therefor.
A tfreat saving might be made, amount
ing to much more than half of the loss,
by Imposing upon magazines and period­|
icals a higher rate of postage. They are
much heavier than newspapers, and con
tain a much higher proportion of adver
tising to reading matter, and the average
dlstsftice of their transportation is three
and a half times as great.
I commend the whole subject to con
not unmindful ot the sDread of in­
1
»v
telligence which a low charge for carry
ing newspapers and periodicals assists. I
very much doubt, however, the wisdom
of a policy which constitutes so largo a
subsidy and requires additional taxation
to meet It.
Postal Savings Banks.
The second subject worthy of mention
in the post office department is the real
necessity and entire partieability of es
tablishing postal savings banks. The suc
cessful party at the last election declared
In favor or postal savings'
vba'nks,
and
although the proposition tinds opponents
In many parts of the country, I am con
vinced that the people desire such banks,
and am sure that when the banks are
furnished they will be productive of the
utmost good. The postal savings banks
are not constituted for the purpose of
creating competition with other banks.
The rate of interest upon deposits to
which they would be limited would be so
small as to prevent their drawing depos
its away from other banks.
1 believe them to be necessary In or
der to offer a proper Inducement to thrift
and saving to a great many people of
small means who do not now have bank
ing facilities, and to whom such a sys
tem would offer an opportunity for the
accumulation of capital. They will fur
nish a satisfactory substitute, based on
sound principle and actual successful
trial in nearly all the countries of the
world, for the system of government
guaranty of deposits now being adopted
in several western states, which with
deference to those who advocate it seems
to me to have in it the seeds of demorali
zation to conservative banking and cer
tain financial disaster.
question of how the money dopos
I Ited in postal savings banks shall be" in
vested is not free from difficulty, 'but .1
I believe that a satisfactory provision for
this purpose was inserted as an amend
ment to the bill considered by the Senate
at its last session. It has been proposed
to delay the consideration of legislation
establishing a postal savings bank until
after the report of the monetary commis
sion. This report is likely to be delayed,
and properly so, because of the necessity
for careful deliberation and close in
vestigation. .[ do not see why the
one should be tied up with the other.
It is understood that the monetary
commission have looked into the
systems of banking which now prevail
abroad, and have found that by a control
there exercised in respect to reserves and
the rates of exchange by some central au
thority panics are avoided. It is not ap
parent that a system of postal savings
banks would in any way Interfere with
a change to such a'system here. Certain
ly in most of the countries in Europe
where control is thus exercised by a cen
tral authority, postal savings banks exist
and are not thought to be inconsistent
with a proper financial and banking sys
tem.
Ship Subsidy.
Following toe course of my distin
guished predecessor, I earnestlv recom
mend to congress the consideration and
passage of a ship subsidy bill, looking to
the establishment of lines between our
Atlantic seaboard and the eastern coast
of South America, as well as lines from
the west coast of the United States to
South America. China, Japan, and the
Philippines. The profits on foreign mails
are perhaps a sufficient measure of the
expenditures which might first be tenta
tively applied to this method of inducing
American capital to. undertake the estab
lishment of American lines of steamships
in those directions in which we now feel
it most important that we should have
means of transportation controlled in '.he
interest of the expansion of our trade.
A bill of this character has once passed
the House and more than once passed the
Senate, and I hope that at this session a
bill framed on the same lines and with
the same purposes may become a law.
New Mexico and Arizona.
The succo.Bsfui party in the last election
in its national platform declared in favor
of the admission as separate states of New
Mexico and Arizona, and I recommend
that legislation appropriate to this end be
adopted. I urge, however, that care be
exercised in the preparation of the legisla
tion affecting each territory to secure de
liberation in the selection of persons as
members of the convention to draft a con
stitution for the incoming state, and I
earnestly advise that such constitution
after adoption by the convention shall be
submitted to the people of the territory
for their approval at an election in which
the sole issue shall be the merits of the
proposed constitution, and If the consti
tution is defeated by popular vote means
shall be provided in the enabling act for a
new convention and the drafting of a new
constitution. I think it vital that the is
sue as to the merits of the constitution
should not be mixed up with the selection
of state officers, and that no election of
state officers should be had until after
the constitution has been fully approved
and finally settled upon.
Conservation of Resources.
In several departments there is presented
the necessity for legislation looking to the
further conservation of our national re
sources, and the subject is one of such
importance as to require a more detailed
and extended discussion than can be en
tered upon in this communication. For
that reason I shall take an early opportu
nity to send a special message to congress
on the subject of the improvement of our
waterways, upon the reclamation and irri
gation of arid, semi-arid, and swamp
lands', upon the preservation of our for
ests and the reforesting of suitable areas
upon the reclassification of the public do
main with a view of separating from agri
cultural settlement mineral, coal and
phosphate lands and sites belonging to the
government bordering on streams suitable
for the utilization of water power.
Consolidation of Bureaus.
1 request congressional authority to en
able the secretary of commerce and la
bor to unite the bureaus of manufac
tures and statistics. This was recom
mended by a competent committee ap
pointed in the previous administration
for the purpose of suggesting changes in
the interest of economy and efficiency,
and is requested by the secretary.
White 8lave Trade.
I greatly regret to have to say that
the investigations made in the bureau of
immigration and other sources of infor
mation lead .to the view that*, there la
urgent necessity for additional legislation
'ana greater executive activity to sup
press the recruiting of the'ranks of pros
titutes from the streams of Immigration
Into this country—an evil which, for want
of a better name, has been called 'nhe
white slave trade." I believe it to be
constitutional to forbid, under penalty,
the. transportation of persons for
purposes of prostitution across national
and state lines and by appropriating a
fund of $50,000 to be used by the secre
tary of commerce and labor for the em
ployment of special inspectors it will be
possible to bring those responsible for
this trade to Indictment ana conviction
under a federal law.
I have thus. In a message compressed
as much as the subjects will permit, re
ferred to many of the legislative needs
of the country, with the exceptions al
ready noted. Speaking generally, the
country Is .'In a high state of prosperity.
There Is every reason to believe that we
are on the eve of a substantial business
expansion, and we nave. Just garnered a
harvest unexampled In the market value
of our agricultural products. The high
prices which such products bring mean
great prosperity for the farming com
munity, but on the' other hand they
mean a very considerably increased bur
den upon those classes in the community
whose yearly compensation does not ex
pand with the improvements in business
and the general prosperity. Various rea
sons are given for the. high prices. The
prooortipnate Increase in the output of
gold, which today Is the chief medium
of exchange and is in tome respects a
measure of value, furnishes a substan
tial explanation of at least part of the
increase In prices. The increase in pop
ulation and the more expensive mode of
ther reason. It is well to note that the
Increase in the cost of living is not con
fined to this country, but prevails the
worl^ over, and that those who would
charge Increases in prices to the existing
protective tariff must meet the fact that
the rise in prices has taken place almost
I wholly In those products of the factory
and farm in respect to which there has
been either no increase in the tariff or
in many Instances a very considerable
reduction. •.
One difference between a pugilist and
a champion football team la that the
latter makes most of its noise at the
I close of the contest.
If there was really room enough at
the top there wouldn't be so many
people falling off.
