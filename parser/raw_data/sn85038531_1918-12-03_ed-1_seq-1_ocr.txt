(Tyinilnn Tlinra.lhll. Lrdn-r Con. Cable.)
London. Dec. I. The demand of
Kurt Eisner, the Bavarian premier,
that Solf. Bcheldemann, David and
other poUtlctnnn who , compromised
their connection with responsibility
fop tho war should leave the govern-
ment him been met by revelations
which show that Eisner himiielf wa
na seriously compromised a any
democratic polltlclun In Germany.
According to Vorwuerts, Erich
Kuttner. editor or the Chemnitser
Volksstlmor, doclarcs KlBner was tho
only socialist In ell Germany who
knew that as early as July 28. 1914.
war had been decided on: that an
the two following days Eisner, who
was In closo touch with the Bava
rian wnr department, telephoned re
peatedly to Kuttner that war wa
impending, that it was entirely the
fault of Hussla; that every effort
must be made to Induce all social
democrats of tho empire to support
tho government and to vote the nec
essary wnr credits.
The revelation will surprise no
body who Is familiar with practically
the whole tSorman socialist movement
In tho yeurs imnuilately preceding
the war. Hut It Is Interesting a
fresh evidence of the futility of any
pretense that there Is any political
Troup In Germany which can Justify
a pl-a of not guilty In regard to re
sponsibility for the war.
Vorwaerta states that the feeling
in Uavnria Is japldly becoming hos
tile to Eisner, who may be replaced
in the near futuro by some one less
inclined to create friction with Ber-

Vienna, Monday, Dec. 3. (A. P.)
Travelers arriving . from Lenaberg
state that Ukrainian troops are pre
paring to surround and starve out
the city, of which the Polish forces
are la control. The Ukrainians are
said to have already cut the railroad
and nro being reinforced by sufficient
troops returning from the Italian
front to ' make a fight against the
Poles.
The Ukrainians deny they are bol-
shcvlsts, but say when the Austrian
empire was broken up they felt they
had a right to the, capital city I of
Lemberg, . the Poles having other
capitals. Difficulties are also antici
pated between the Poles and Czechs
over the possession of Oderberg, a
town In Austrian Silesia. . '
Conditions in Gallcla and Silesia
are said to be worse than they were
during the .war. The several newly
organised republics are gaining re
cruits from soldiers returning from
the various fronts and are paying
them several dollars a day for fight
ing. Officers are also being well paid
for engaging in hostilities.

Germans Willing for Release
at Onc-e Train to Be Sent
for Them.
Washington, Dec. 3. Twenty-three
hundred American prisoners of war
at Camp Raslatt, Germany, were re
ported "well ' organized, well clothed
and morale excellent" In a cablegram
today to the American Red Cross
from Lern O. Levy, of the prisoners'
relief section, who has just visited
Rastatt.
The German authorities, Mr. Levy
reported, are willing to release the
prisoners at once under charge of
nineteen American officers to be
transferred from the prison at
Karlshrue, and he recommended that
a train be ordered sent for them.
This message from Mr. Levy
brought the first definite news re
ceived on this side of tho situation
at the big Rastatt camp since the
signing of tho armistice. Hs favor
able nature was regarded as par
ticularly gratifying in view of vary
ing reports concerning the treatment
accorded prisoners by the Germans.

THE NAVY IN BATTLE
Pollew's Review May Cause Hot Con.
troveray,
(London Ttmca-I'hlt. Lodfffr Cop. fable.)
London, Nov, 30. A. H. Pollew's vol
ume, "The Navy In Battle," hitherto
held up by the censor, was published to
day. Jt seeiim likely, .says the Daily
SInll, it will lead to a controversy, but
the judgment of most will depend on the
so far undisclosed signals which passed
during the battle of Jutland.
Keferring to tho approach . of the
grand fleet under Jnlllcoe to the scene
of action, Pollew writes:
"Had all divisions of the grand fleet
kept on their course Ut full speed Until
reaching the track of Beatty'a squadron,
the line might have been formed exaetlv
In Beatty's track. Had this line fol
lowed him as he closed down, the enemv
would have been completely outflanked
on both ends of his line and even sur
rounded at its head. There would have
been hnlf an hour between the grand
fleet getting into action and the failure
of light, for It la difficult to suppose thai
at ranges of 11,000 yards the 8.000 Rims
of the (fraud fleet could not have beaten
the high seas fleet decisively.
"Von Seheer could not have turned.
His choice would have been between
annihilation or flight pell mell.
"Not only does It seem that some
such development as this was manifest
ly possible, but It looks as if It was ex
actly this deployment that Beatty had
expected."
The author 'points out that the dis
patches are fellent about Jellicoe's plan,
but the information they contain as to
A
happened: The grand licet came up In
six divisions, placed abreast or each
other, steering straight for the Germans.
Then "'all tha leading ships turned eight
points, or at a right angle to port, so
that In a very few minutes after the
leading ship had turned the fleet would
be in line at right angles to its former
course, and If the leading ship continued
on a new course the fleet would then he
heading away from the enemy. The
grand fleet had not formed up astern of
the battle cruiser fleet, it had not come
into action as a unit simultaneously; It
had not deployed either on the enemy or
on the British fast division."
Pollew asserts that "very little Is ac
tually known as to what happened in the
course of the night," and expresses sur
prise that the damaged and battered
Germans "were not brought into action
on the following dny." He adds: "Com-mander-ln-rhlef
Jelllcoe does not tell us
of any search being made for the enemy
at all." Pollew says he Is driven to the
conclusion that If "the commander-in-chief
assumed It was not our business,
hut the Germans' business, to resume

President Wilson will sit in the

expected, will replace him later. Secretary o. State Lansing, by virtue ol Ills

Poles having captured the city, end
ing' a remarkable intrigue, half Ger

Kuthenians and the Toles. Austria

tho extent of German intrigues to
keep the poles out of Lemberg, but
i a remarkable thing happened.
I Four boys attacked a Ruthenian
Boldler with fists, captured his motor
car and drove to the munition de

volvers and made off. Other boys
joined until sixty-four boys, mostly
15 and 16 years old, had barricaded
themselves in the schoolhouse, ul.so
making raids on tho depots and
seizing weapons. They made a des

Ruthenian army was an undisciplined

the boys scored their first big victory

Where the Ruthenians were in con

fighting lasted many days, being

PROVE VEHICLES
OF SOME DEBATE
Believed to Be Purpose of
Resolutions Regarding
President's Trip.
NOT CONSIDERED SERIOUS
President's Message Not a
Complete Disappointment
to Republicans.
Washington, Dec. . U. N. S.)
Forgetting all other tasks before It,
the senate centered its attention to
day on two resolutions connected
with President Wilson's trip abroad.
The first, the Cummins resolution,
would send a select senate commit
tee to Paris to watch the peace con
ference and report upon It to the
senate.
The second, the Sherman resolu
tion, would declnro the presidency
vacant, and call upon tho vice-president
to annum the otHco of the
chief executive for the remainder ol
President Wilson's term.
It was believed today that neither
of these resolutions would pass th.
senate, but both will prove vehicles
of debate that will allow senators U
give expression to many sentiments
they have entertained, but not dis
cussed during the war period.
Refused Recognition.
Vice-President Marshall refused to
recognize Senator Sherman, when he
sought to Introduce his resolution
yesterday. The resolution will be put
in today, and will be sent off with a
speech by the Illinois senator. Sen
ator Knox is expected to solso the
opportunity to doliver a speech upon
the responsibility of the senate for
tion ever since the last session ad
journed. The insistence of democratic sena
tors upon adjournment Immediately
after the president read his message
to congress yesterday, has given re
publicans time to think over the
president's statements, with the re
suit that some who were expected
to speak yesterday will not enter into
the debate Others who wlsn to air
partisan views have come to the
conclusion that all the speech-making
should not be done on one day.
Today's debate, therefore, will be
only a starter.
Promises Early Report.
The Cummins resolution Is before
the senate foreign relations commit
tee today. Senator Hitchcock, chair
man of the committee, has promised
Senator Cummins that the committee
will make some kind ot a report upon
it. probably) on Wednesday.
iatlons com fhittte l simply pu the
i resolutions Vp to the senate, repdrt-
jng upon it 'neither favorably nor un
favorably. Senator Cummins said
today that he had not canvassed the
committee, and was not prepared to
predict what the committee would do.
"I believe, however, that you will
find a majority of the senate for this
proposal," he added. "Home senators
hold that it would be undignified for
a senate committee in Paris to wait
at the kitchen door of the peace com-
1 missioners to find out what had oc
curred at the conference. However,
I believe I can convince them that
there Is nothing undignified about
the proceedings I propose.
"It goes without saying that I con
ferred with many republican leaders
before I prepared my resolution. I
know that practically all prominent
republicans are for It,
and that a
leaders will
good many democratic
favor it.
Fever of Rebellion.
Administration leaders in the sen
ate who have not caught the fever
of rebellion that is in evidence til
some democratic quarters at the
capitol, are a little concerned over
the Cummins resolution. They be
lieved It will bo voted down on Its
merits but at the same time, they
will go out and work actively against
it.
The amendment proposed by Sena
tor Plttman that the committee be
sitlon by making it appear ridiculous
in the eyes of the country.
The Sherman resolution Is drawn
in such form that it is evident Its
author never expected it to receive
serious consideration by the senate.
This Im similar to the Kodenburg bill
in the house, except that tho house
resolution would have the vice-president
assume the office of chief execu
tive, only during tho absence of
President Wilson. The house has no
interest in the Cummins resolution,
and there will be no discussion in
that body unless the senate commit
tee on audit and control finds there
Is insufficient funds in the contin
gent fund of the senate to meet the
expenses of the proposed Junket. 1
is interested in the Sherman-Itoden-burg
resolution, however.
Republican leaders in tho lower
body, Mnnn, Gillette, Mondell and
Longworth, have Indicated their in
tention of inquiring, whenever a bill
is on the point of being passed,
whether It should actually be deliv
ered Into the hands of the president,
or whether, under the constitution,
delivery of the bill at the White
Hon so meets the requirements.
This discussion may lead to more
serious developments than are now
expected after the president leaves
the country, If the passage of emer
gency legislation is necessary.
Notwithstanding their statements
to tho contrary, President Wilson's
message was not a complete disap
pointment to republican leaders of
the house and senate. Most of fiem
hold to the view that the railroads
should be returned to private owner
ship. They were greatly pleased to 1
find that the president "has an open I
mind" on this subject. They had be- I
Ueved he was firmly convinced of the
necessity of permanent government
operation. Public ownership men, on
the other hand, were bitterly disap
pointed by those sections of the
president's message dealing with the
railroads.

The advantage of personal contact
with Mr. Wilson, adds the Times, Is
expected to bo Immense. There Is
no disposition to ask him to accept
such conclusions as the allied gov
ernments may have reuched, or to
prejiidlre In uny way the freedom ot
his decision. There will be no at
tempt to rush him or to foist Ku

understood he moy wish to look

as to Im able to maKe tip his own

Attitude Toward Separate
Peace in Bavaria Under
goes Change.
London. Dec. 3. Kurt Eisner, the
Bavarian premier, Is losing prestige
according to Munich advices re
ceived here by tho way of Amster
dam, Copenhagen and Berne. A
Copenhagen dispatch says Elsnor
was hissed by his own partisans at
Munich during a celebration In honor
of returning soldiers. Later a sup
porter of Eisner was not allowed to
make a speech and was obliged to
flee from an angry crowd which re
moved the red flags along the streets
and stormed the ministry of the In
terior, shouting: "Down with Eisner."
Guards fired over the heads of the
crowd, which dispersed.
A Borne dispatch to the Mail says
It Is believed that Bavaria Is gradu
ally reaching a conclusion to retain
its unity with the rest of Germany
rather than seeking a separate peace.
This message also reported evidence
of growing hostility toward Eisner,
adding that there are signs in Mun
ich that a crisis Is approaching and
that action favoring some form of
