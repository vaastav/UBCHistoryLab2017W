"THE LAW OF CONTEMPT.
Right' or Appeal from file Order ofn
Chancellor Important Decision by
the .Supreme Court.
From tho Knoxvillc Press and Herald, Dec. 7.
The decision of the Supreme Court,
yesterday, in the cases of Brooks vs.
Jflcming, has attracted no little atten
tion among the members of the bar
now in the city, and will doubtless be
of interest to Lawyers throughout the
State.
The cases originated in the Chancery
Court at this place, over a yearago.and
the proceedings therein were published
in our columns in full at the time. "We
now briefly recapitulate.
In 1863, Brooks filed his bill in Chan
cery here to dissolve the law-partner-sship
of Fleming & Brooks, and ob
tained an injunction restraining Flem
ing from collecting any fees due the
firm. About four years afterward,
Brooks presented his affidavit, charging
Fleming with contempt of court, in vi
olating the injunction by collecting two
partnership fees, one from John J. West,
and one from Hugh Martin, of Kings
ton", and moved that he be committed
or otherwise punished therefor. Atthe
sainc tinielie entered a motion to strike
the name of Col. Fleming from the roll
of solicitors of the court for the alleged
offence of perjury, charged to have
been committed in his answer to his
'original bill. An answer was filed and
both motions heard together.
Aftcrhearing a mass of testimony and
elaborate arguments, the Chancellor
adjudged the respondent not guilty of
the perjury and denied the motion to
strike his name from the roll of solici
tors from his court; but being of opin
ion that he had violated the injunction
:ml svns in contempt,- -fmctl hiirr fifty
dollars therefor. Respondent Fleming
prayed an appeal, which was granted,
and subsequently the relator Brooks
took a writ of error to the judgment of
the Chancellor in refusing to strike
Col. Fleming from the roll of solicitors.
Both cases were heard together in the
Supreme CourtJ hist week. Four ques
tions arose in the case:
1. Had Fleming the right to appeal
from the order of the Chancellor ad
judging him in contempt and fining
Lint therefor?
2. If so.Jwas he guilty of the eon
tempt charged?
3. "Was Brooks entitled to an appeal
or writ of error, from the decree of the
Chancellor adjudging Col. Fleming not
guilty of perjury and refusing to strike
his name from the roll of solicitors ?
i. If so, was he guilty and should tho
Chancellor's decree be overruled ?
Yesterday; Judge Tumey delivered
. the opinion of the court in the cases,
holding;
1. That an appeal would lie from the
order of a Chancellor adjudging a par
ty to be in contempt, and punishing
him therefor, when such contempt is
not "in the face of the Court."
2. That in this case, Fleming was not
guilty of the contempt charged.
3. That a relator or person seeking
to disbar an attorney, has no right to
an appeal, or writ of error, from a de
cree denying his motion,
As a consequence, the Court had no
jurisdiction over the inotion to disbar,
and declined to pass upon the testi
mony, though requested so to do by
Col. Fleming's counsel. "Want of space
forbids the publication of the full text
of the opinion.
Judge Freeman dissented from the
third proposition, and held that the re
lator had the richt of appeal in such
cases. Judge MeFarland was also of
oninion. that, if taxed with costs, the
relator might appeal.
The friends of Col. Fleming will re
joice at his complete vindication at the
hands of this supreme tribunal.
GIUOTSIJHIEF JUSTICE.
A General IVclinsr or Disgust Over
Williams' Noiiiiuntion The Repub
lican Lawyers In the Senate Ursinff
the WillHlranal of Williams.
From the New York Sun.
Washington, Dec .5. One of the most
cjnist ic remarks on tho President's message
was made to me to-day by a licpublican
member in good standing with his party
It was to this ellcct:
" In the opening paragraph of his message
the President regrets the failure of Jay
Cooke and Henry Clews, and neglects to
pay a decent tribute to the late Chief Jus
t.iro? Chase.
"That was a shunilar omission," I re
marked: '-how do you account for it?"
"Probably because he did not wish to
inmost anv comparison between the late
.ifMiiiiiniit of the bench and the centlcman
he has selected as his successor," replied
mv frip.nil.
Anronos of this it can be safely said that
nf hll President Grant's appointments, not
one has created such profound disgust as
the elevation of Williams to the Chief Jus
ticeship. I have not heard a lawyer, wheth
er Democrat or Republican, who docs not
ri l.miiili.iifld. It is said also that there

The Unilcd Slates &oim4, bV ifaw"
York publishes ill its issue of the Ctli inst.
reports of an extensive industrial revival in
the manufacturing districts in New En
gland and the Middle States, and hiakes
the following editcrial comment: v
"Our information is very full and pre
cise, especially from the Kew England
States, and relates chiefly, though not en
tirely, to tcxile industries in which our
readers are more particularly interested.
From these reports, to which wo invite par
ticular attention) it appears that the cotton
and woolen iliills are everywhere very gen
erally resuming operations. A large num
ber which had stopped, it was feared for 'the
wintcr,rcsumcd work on half or thretquar
ters time on the 1st of BeCeiriber; others
which have not yet resumed will do so on
Monday ltcxl, and mills which had bccii
running half time, or even less, arc work
ing full time. The great Lowell factories
are now nearly all working full time. The
Fall River mills, whose cutlro stoppage so
lately seemed imminent, have considerably
increased their operations Some of them
are now working full lime, aud there is
scarcely a doubt ih:it all of them will do so
en the 1st of January. From the manu
facturing centers in Maine and Xew Hamp
shire the accounts iire almost invariably
favorable. Inl'eiiusylvahia the tcxilo fuc
to'rics are again starting up, and even from
Patterson, 2s. J., we have the good news of
tho resumption of some of the silk factories
at that place.
"This revival of industrial activity is at
tended for the most part by a reduction of
wages of from 10 to. 20 per eentt To this
reduction, lioweverj there nre some excep
tions, the extensive "Wamsutta and New
York Mills, and some others having in
creased their operations at former rates of
wages. Rut, as was recently shdWn in the
i'coiiomisf, a reduction of wages was in
evitable, as goods could not be replaced at
tho prices at which they are now saleable.
it the lonuer cost oi production. It is
creditable to thegood sense of the operatives
that they generally acquiesce in this reduc
tion of wnges as a necessity of the times.
And it can be easily shown that it is to
their interest to do so, because it is not so
much the amount ns the Hurcliasiug power
u)f wages tliat is important. Owing to the
general reduction in the price ot commodi
ties the workman will probably be able to
save as much, if not more money than be-
lore, and Without the loss of any comforts,
or even luxuries, to which they may have
been accustomed.
"From the vcrv full and accurate inform
ation now at our command, We feel fully
waiTanteil in anticipating, under ordinary
circumstances, a complete and entire re
sumption of the textile industry of the
country at the commencement of the new
year now only three weeks hence. And,
considering the magnitude of this industry,
and its relations and influences upon other
branches of trade and on general business,
this must .be regarded as an event of nation
al importance. It lias long been remarked
that when the dry sooils trade is good every
branch of business is prosperous, and this
liolds goodat the present time more than
ever. It is surely a hopeful feature of the
future that this great industry, which was
the last to feel the affects of the pauic, is
the first to recover from it. There is not a
commercial or industrial interest in any
part of the country which will not speedily
experience the beneficial affecta of a restor
ation of the great woolen and cotton man
ufactures. It is the first and best sign of
returning prosperity to the whole Ameri
can people."
THE SALARY REPEAL BILL.
Character or the Jllll to be llcnorlcd
A Sharp Contest Over the I'rcsi
dent's Grab.
From the St. Louis Republican.
Wasihis-gtox, Dec 0. The special
committee appointed by the back-pay cau
cus to draft a salary repeal bill, agreed to
night to report the bill introduced the other
day by Niblack, of Indiana, with some
modifications. The bill provides for the
repeal of so much of the salary act as re
lates to the oav ol members. Senators, the
Vice President, Speaker, and other ollicers
cl the House and Senate, thus reducing
the salaries to the original figure. The
salaries of the President, Supreme Judges
1 1 1" . 1' f IT i ...
aim umix'is ji uiu iaumui remain as in
creased last session.
There was a sharp fight over the question
of the President's salary, the two Demo
crats and one Republican on the committee
m favor of reducing it and the other five
Republicans voting against it. Kasson of
Iowa is the Republican who had the nerve
to vote for the reduction of the President's
salary. The caucus itself was in favor of
reducing all the salaries, but when the
committee came to act, and the responsi
bility was narrowed down to the shoulders
of a few, that few proved imcqual to the
Presidential pressure and succumbed.
They hid behind the clause in the consti
tution which provides tliat tho President's
salary shall not be changed during his term
of ofhee.
From the Louisville Courier-Journal.
Wamiizsotox, Dec 7. It is understood
to-night that the House committee on the
salary' question h ivc agreed on a bill repeal
ing the salary law so tar as- it allecls mem
bers of Congress, but without any retroact
ive features. 1 Ins will leave m iorce the
old law providing $5,000 icr annum and
ten cents per mile for mileage as the com
pensation. . l lie question oi lite rrcsiiient s
salary was discussed, but nothimr on the
subject is incorporated in the bill. It is ar
ranged that by consei.lt of the committee
Mr. Jlale.-ol Jlaine, will oiler a resolution
providing for an amendment to the Consti
tution, providing that any increase oi pay
hereafter shall not be retroactive in its op
eration. The assent of the Senate to tlie
bilf is vcrv doubtful. Mr. 4Jeck will offer
his bill as an amendment, if Mr. Rlaine
will give him the opportunity to do so.
. THE VILLA I)U HAVRE.
The liot-li Earn Abamloiicu nl Joa
SfiiU'iueiil in Reference to the Col
lision with the Villa Jn Havre.
Loxno.y, Dec 7. The crew of the Loch
Earn, which ran into arrd sunk the Villc
du Havre, lravc arrived at Plymouth. They
were brought rnto port by the iintish
Queen, which took them oil' the Loch Eain
nn tlm 27th ult.. at which trine she was in
a sinkiiur condition.
The account of the Ville du Havre disas
ter, given by the rescued crew, represents.
that the Captain and fteconii Jiate oi me
steamer came on board the Loch Earn
shortly after the collision, and did not as-
sist in savrii!r anv ol the passengers, anil
that the majority ot the J; rencn crew cxinu-
ited lamentable cowardice.
The Cantain of the Loch Earn makes
the following statement of the circum
stances attondiiur the collision with the
steamer:
After first sighting, and seeing that sue
was coming dangerously near, the Captain
of the Loch Earn rang the ship's bell and
nut his helm to port. The helm ol the
steamer w;is put to starboard, but she came
- . t , . -i-. ' . i. ri'i .
right across tne i-iocu .cams uu. xnu
people in the first boat from the French
steamer did not say that she was sinking,
hut. t hn Cantain of the Loch Earn, observ
ing that the steamer was settling down,
,fnt. out his boats. Neither the first French
boat nor the second one, which arrived
shortly afterwards, bringing the first and
second captains of the Ville du llavre, at
tempted to return, but, in spite of the ex
postulations of all the crew who were left
on board the Loch Earn, and the threats of
her mates to fire upon them, they remained
alongside the Loch Earn. The clothing of
tho French ollicers who reached the deck
of the Loch Earn was very dry, showing
no sicrns of their bavins been in the water.
Finally some Englishmen seized and
manned one of the French boats, aird went
lo tho resaie of those stnisclniK m the sea.
Onlv one of the French boat's crew assisted
in the rescue. The Captain of the Loch
Earn considers that the great loss of life
resulted from the fact that his vessel drifted
such a Jong distance from the steamer alter
the collision, belorc it wa-spossiore to snon.-
n sail, from the tardiness of the s learner
..in showbiz signals of distress, and from the
misconduct of her crew.
The Clarksville Chronicle of the Cth has

Aflirnicd.
From tho Knoxvillo Press and Herald, Dec. '
The case of W. O. Kaui vs. E. T.
Hall, determined in tho Supreme Court
'yesterday, presents some questions of
interest.
Kain had been sued in ejectment in
18o9, in the Circuit Court of Knox
county, Judije Brown presiding. The
court was closed by war before a trial
was had. Military Governor Johnson
appointed E. T. Hall judge in 1801, be
lorc tho term ot Judge Jrown ex
pired. Pending the war, he held
a term ot court and tried the
suit m defendant s absence, and gave
judgment against him. Cain, ignoring
the trial and insisting that Jtiall s com
mission was void, appeared in court m
1871 .and moved the court to try tho
cause. This was refused, and he ap
plied to the Supreme Court for a man
damns to compel the Circuit Judge to
try it, but the writ was rcinscd.
In an elaborate opinion by Judge
Sneed, the court affirmed the right of I
a 'conquering power to establish courts
for the trial of controversies among the
citizens of the conquered territory, and
sustained the validity of the appoint
ment by Gov. Johnson.

MEAT,
From the St. Louis Globe.
New Toek, Dec. 5. At present
thousands of working women here are
out of employment, and the mstitu
tions to which -hey can look are few,
The local and general governments will
perhaps give work to a large number of
men the coming winter, but it can nnd
none ior women, and they must there
fore by necessity be dependent upon
outside aid. It is a singular feature of
the labor crisis that a large number of
women employed in making umbrellas
ana parasois nave taken tms time to
inaugurate the strike because a reduc
tion of wages has been made by their
employers. It would seem that at such
a time work at any price would be prc-
ierable to idleness, iiut there is a
Parasol and Umbrella Makers' Union.
embracing about 1,100 women, and they
have funds in their treasury to the
amount of 2,500. Doubtless this seems
a large sum to guis whose average
earnings do not exceed 7 a week; but
it will go only a short way toward keep
ing the wolf trom the door. Une
hundred and fifty members are -now on
a strike; and, it other dealers iollow
the example already set', to reduce their
scale of prices, their employes will be
compelled by tbo Union to strike, and
m less than a month then iunds would
be exhausted.

The RrcndslntTs Trade.
From the New York Bulletin.
The market for breadstnfis for the week
ending Dec 4hasbeencliaracterized by ex
treme dullness, and for the most parta noin-
jnal market until the close, or near the
close, when holders gave way, and the mar
ket declined quite rapidly, cpnsrderiirg tire
season ot the year, without stimulating de
mand to any extent except in com, which
is the only article on the whole list in
which even a fair birsrness was done on the
closing day of the week to fill freights, and
the activity is likely to prove only momen
tary while the general market Is iu such a
weak,. lifeless condition, lhis turn in the
market from the strong position and active
market of last week and the week before is
generally a surprise to the trade, who
looked for a still stronger market alter nav
igation had definitely closed. But the re
sult shows that its effects had been largely
drscounted by the shrppers and receivers
both beforehand, aud that the former lrad
made more liberal purchases m anticipa
tion, while the receivers had crowded the
market up under this shipping demand
faster than foreign markets could be made
to respond. Hence a lull, if not momenta
ry stagnation, was almost inevitable, so
long as so many of our receivers are com
polled to sell their receipts on arrival, or
nearly so, because they lrave not the ability
to carry any stock.
