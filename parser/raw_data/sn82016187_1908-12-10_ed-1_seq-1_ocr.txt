ONE DOLLAR A YEAH
BE INSURRECTION WAS A REVOLUTION
ANOTHER ADDED TO THE LONG LIST OF HAITIS BLOOD
BROILS-
Gen Simon a Full Blood Negro Seizes the Presidency but He Will
Have Contestants Haitis 104 Years of Sanguinary History An
Overturning on an Average of Less Than Four Years
Insurrection Becomes Iteiolutlon
Tho insurrection In Haiti has ended
more promptly and with less bloodshed
than could have been anticipated The
venerable President Nord Alexis main
tained his courage to the end and tho
he was about 90 years old was firmly
resolved to fight but he found that his
supporters lacked his determination
They were cowardly and treacherous
or else having got all they could out
of his administration hoped for some
thing better ii a change
There Is one trouble that always at
tends Governments based upon force
It was what ruined Napoleon The
men around him and who had fought
valiantly for him did not see a prospect
of getting any more and either were
lukewarm or absolutely rebellious
Nord Alexiss veteran divisions and
A sSSst trusted officers weakened as
the insurgents approached the Capital
and gave up all thought of fighting
Then the robber element in Port au
Prince came to the front and began
regular robberies and incendiaries
They were only estopped in this by the
energetic action of the more substan
tial citizens of the town who organized
a home guard under a resolute officer
and coming upon the robbers In the
midst of their outrages without warn
ing fired a deadly volley into them that
killed eight This was followed by an
other volley which killed four more
and then all the heart of the robbers
turned to water and they fled
The warships in the harbor sent land
fcig parties to protect their consulates
and If necessary restore order but they
Csund that the citizens were quite
Gen Simon Enters Port na Prince
A delegation of the citizens of Port
au Prince went out to meet Gen Simon
and his army said to be 5000 strong
and ask him to come immediately into
the city and take possession to restore
order to save lives With true negro
superstition Gen Simon refused to ad
vance because it was Friday He made
his entry with a great deal of fanfaron
ade on Saturday when he was ac
claimed the President and going to the
cathedral a high mass was celebrated
and the Te Deum sung with the Arch
bishop officiating
He made all sorts of agreeable prom
ises as to the future but this is the
customary thing with the revolutionary
leaders who are successful He said
that ho did not want to be King and
he would submit his candidacy to a
vote of the people This is a ludicrous
formality since we know that as long
as he can hold his army together no
body within gunshot of It will be al
lowed to vote against him
The so called Congress will be called
together and his election made formal
that is if his competitors cannot pre
vent it While the dispatches repre
sent tht Gen Simon is exceedingly
popular thtse must be taken with
much allowance Apparently he is a
negro of the coarser kind and conse
quently popular with the more ignor
ant Haitians but is repugnant to the
mulattos and the more educated Hai
tians Some strong competitors have
already appeared among them being
Gen Firmin who has been the leader
In many of the insurrections and has
for come time been an exile at St
Thomas Danish West Indies Imme
diately upon hearing of the outbreak
Gen Firmin chartered a vessel and Is
now on his Tray to Haiti via Kingston
Jamaica Another prominent aspirant
Is Gen Celestln Fouchard who has
long been seeking the Presidency and
who was in exile at Kingston Jamaica
He at once chartered the Cuban Rall
TOad Companys steamer Oteri and
with 30 of his followers sailed for Port
au Prince Ho has a great deil of
strength among the better class of Hai
tians and he says that he is confident
of being elected President and that
I am a roan of means and I will
not allow any boodling My policy will
bo liberal and my watchword will be
progress I m going to consolidate
the debt of the country float a big loan
call in all the paper money and estab
lish a cold currency
8UH further what were left of Nord
Alexiss veteran divisions re
treated with their arms toward the
north where it is not improbable they
will set up a separate Government and
will be Joined by tho members of Nord
Alexiss Cabinet who have succeeded
In making their escape This may re
vive an old sore because Haiti has al
ways been divided between tho north
and the south and several times there
havo been separate Governments exist
ing in the two sections and clashing
with one another
The regular elections for President
are due next May but it is expected
that a special election will be ordered
within a few weeks to confirm Gen
filmouH accession to power and then
we ian look for more disturbances and
a trial of strength with his powerful
pponents

naltla nintory
Haiti was discovered by Columbus in
December 1492 and here at Isabella
on the north shore was founded the
first Spanish colony in the New World
Santo Domingo was founded Aug 4
1496 For nearly half a century these
settlements received much attention
and rose to great prosperity but as
other parts of America were discovered
the population was drawn off and the
natives having been extirpated the
island became almosta waste
In 1585 Admiral Drake seized Santo
Domingo City for which he received a
ransom of 25000 ducats About 1632
the French took possession of the west
shore and their numbers increased in
a certain measure by the buccaneers
who had established themselves on the
island of Tortuga and on the northwest
coast of Haiti multiplied so rapidly
that the Spaniards were unable to cope
with or banish them and by the treaty
of Ryswlck Sept 20 1697 the western
portion of the island was guaranteed
to France
Cultivation in Haiti as the French
now called their part of the island
rapidly extended under the new rule A
large proportion of tho cotton and
sugar consumed not only in France but
in all Europe came toward the end of
the 18th century from Haiti which by
that time had become one of the most
valuable possessions of the New World
The boundaries between the two colo
nies were not fixed till 1777 In the
meantime the eastern or Spanish por
tion made little or no progress
In 1790 the population of the western
colony numbered about 500000 of
which number 38360 were of Euro-

We of this which give3 some hopes of
better things in Haiti
The aged President was rescued from
the mob Which beset him and with the
Trench flag thrown over his shoulders
was escorted on board of the Frencli
gunboat He was pursued by a howl
ing mob which actually struck him
and a woman attempted to stab him
hut the French marines managed to get
him safely on board
All of those who had been associated
In his Government at once sought safe
ty in flight and from what can be
learned from the dispatches were all

juc uc peuiHe coior were mostly
mulattos and some of them had re
ceived a liberal education in France
and possessed large estates Still they
were excluded from all political privi
leges anu were not eligible to positions
of authority or trust
The great revolution in France was
heartily responded to by the whites of
the colony who sent Deputies to the
National Assembly at Paris and pro
claimed the adhesion of the colony to
the principles of liberty equality and
fraternity The application of these
principles however it was intended
should be confined exclusively to the
whites But the mulattos demanded
their extension to themselves and this
appeal being treated with contempt
and indignation they resolved to resort
to arms Accordingly some 300 of
them rose In insurrection in October
1790 under one Vincent Oge who had
been educated In France but he was
defeated captured and with his broth
er broken on the wheel and 21 of his
followers were hanged
Much Indigation was expressed in
Paris against the colonists and by the
Influence of the Society of Les Amis
Des Noirs the National Assembly May

the people of color born of free parents
were entitled to all the privileges of
touch slavery or meddle wltli the slaves
out it excited to the inchest pitch the
Jealousies and apprehensions of the
planters who forced the Governor of
the coloney to suspend its operations
until they could appeal to the homo
Government
A Servile Insurrection
The refusal opihelr caused
much commotio among the mulattos
and civil war again appeared inevita

and for a time there seemed some pros
pect of tho restoration of peace But
on Sept 24 the National Assembly at
Paris moved by the remonstrances
which had been received from the
white colonists repealed the decree of

arms and the civil war continued with
Increased ferocity on all sides for sev
eral years Commissioners wore re
peatedly sent from France but could
eifect nothing
The whites themselves were divided

was Invaded by the Spaniards and by
the English and the insurgent blacks
and mulattos under able chiefs Tield
strong positions in the mountains and
defied ail efforts to suoaue them
The French Commissioners Involved
in difficulties on every hand at length
decided to conciliate the blacks and in
August 1793 proclaimed universal
freedom In apprehension of an Eng
lish invasion which took place in the
following month In February 1794
the National Convention at Paris con
firmed this act of the Commissioners
and formally guaranteed the freedom
of all the inhabitants of the French
colony Meantime tho English con
quered the whole western coast of the
islapd took the Capital Fort au Prince
and besieged the Governor Gen La-
veaux in Port de la Pair the last
stronghold of the French who ware
reduced to extremities of famine and
disease

At this Juncture the blacks led by
Toussaint lOuverture relying on the
proclamation of emancipation came to
the aid of the French Governor The
siege of Port de la Paix was raised the
Spaniards were driven bacK ana alter
a long contest during which Toussaint
was appointed by the French authori
ties of tho army
the English In 1797 were expelled from
the island the whole of which by the
treaty with Spain concluded at Basel
July 22 1795 now belonged to Franco
Under the energetic administration
of Toussaint lOuverture peace was re
stored commerce and agriculture re
vived the whites were protected and
their estates restored to them and a
constitution for the colony was adopt

France but making no distinction be
tween the citizens on account of race
or color
Attempt to Relmpoie Slavery
In 1801 however Napoleon Bona
parte then First Consul resolved to
restore slavery in Santo Domingo the
French Legislature at Paris decreed its
restoration and an expedition under
Gen Leclerc was sent to enforce the
decree The army landed at Samana

There were tho usual first day crowds
at tho Capitol tho opfrningday of the
session of Congress only they were not
quite as numerous The interest Is less
keen for the opening of a short Besslon
partakes more of formality The Representatives-elect
do not come to be
sworn in till tho next Congress begins
This year there wore chly Ti handful of
members to walk up to tho Speakers
desk and take the oath of office They
were men elected Co fill vacancies
caused by death or resignation since
the last session adjourned The Sena
tors to be sworn In were only three
ex Gov Cummins of Iowa to succeed
the lato Senator Allison 11 r E D
Smith of South Carolina to succeed
the late Senator Iatimer and ex Gov
Carroll Page of Vermont to succeed
tho late Senator Proctofe
As a matter of fact the statesmen
came in very tardily for attendance at
the session They arrived in big bunches
Sunday and even Monday They felt
there was little to hasten their coming-
and were generally satisfied if they
were on hand by Tuesday when the
Presidents message was received
The Representatives are keenly in
terested in the Speakership question A
Speaker however IsJnptto be elected
till the extra session begins in March
The loyalty to Speaker Cannon is most
marked on every side It has been very
gratifying to him He will go into the
Spoakers chair for another term by the
unanimous caucus nomination Repre
sentative Townsend of Michigan who
at one time was given prominence as an
aspirant has been very1 emphatic in
declarations for Mr Cannon
The Important Appropriations Commit
tee I
But all the gossln about tho Speaker
ship and about tho modification of the
rules belongs more to the opening
months of tho new year than to the
early days of the approaching session
Tlie Houso Appropriations Committee
has the center of the stage right from
the start Thero is oJ seneral eager
ness for the annual budgets Probably
one or two big bills -will be reported
and passed by the Honse before tho
holidays One of thctnOis -the legisla
tive executive and Judicial appropria
tion bill a bulky measure -which pro
vides the annual salariesfor about 30-
the operation and maintenance of the
Departments
very little work is expected the first
week The Presidents annual message
Is a formality which always precedes
legislative activities Themeeting Mon
day was very brief -The Senate ad
journed Immediately after the roll call
out of respect for tho memory of tho
late Senator Allison fiXhat made the
receipt of tho PresdenCs3acesgre that
day impracticable Fornerore the mes
sage Is Bent tho PresfdplTrmust be offi
cially notified that CQiferess Is in ses
sion A cwnmilteo JM Senators arid
members must not only be appointed
but have time to travel tho mile be
tween the Capitol and thq White House
and back again Accordingly while
they wero appointed Monday they did
not report on their visit to the Presi
dent till Tuesday
Postal Savings JInnk
Tha Senate may have some lively
times before tho holidays There Is
much Interest In the bill for postal
savings banks which by agreement
last Spring will bo taken up the sec
ond week of the session Stoutly as
that legislation was opposed at tho
Capitol it will probaWy be enacted
The Republican Party Is now commit
ted to It by the Chicago platform No
conclusion Is yet posslblo as to how
strong tho support forjthe bill will bo
in Senate or House The fact that It Is
an Administration as -well as a party
measure should insure good majorities
In both branches
There is almost no interest now that
tho elections are over in the bills for
tho restoration of the Tiegro soldiers
who wero at Brownsville to their old
places In tho army Senators would be
glad to find some way to free them
selves of the consideration of those
measures but a dafe was fixed by
agreement at the last session Senator
Foraker has given assurances of a ring
ing speech In defense of himself which
will likely bo delivered in connection
with tho Brownsville bills That event
will give tho Senate an interesting day
or two It may lead to spirited debate
The prevailing sentiment as was to
havo been expected is that Congress
will have time only to attend to the 14
or 15 appropriation bills and that gen
eral legislation must In tho main go
over to the next or 61st Congress
Thero Is nlready considerable activity
In connection with a river and harbor
bill which is a biennial not an annual
measure The rivalry will bo keen to
secure generous appropriations thereon
for numerous rivers and harbors and
thero will be the usual struggle on the
part of Senate and House leaders to
keep tho total from assuming too great
proportions Aiany communities win
send delegations askliyr for a hearing
For a time these delegations will be
quite as conspicuous in Washington as
those that have been comng on tariff
revision missions
Tue Vice Prcxiacnt Eleet
But Washington tills week of the
opening of Congress Is favored not
alone with the presence of the President-elect
Vice President elect James
Schoolcraft Sherman of Utlca is In

of Congress from tho Utlca district and
a member of Speaker pannons Com

His Winter will bo full of activity
and ho is going about his duties just
like any other business man of the
IIou3e of Representatives and as he
has been doing for the last 20 years
Among other things sir Sherman Is
Chairman of tho Committee on Indian
Affairs He has a committee room on
the ground floor of theC Capitol where
there Is a long tableland where 18
other Representatives are soon to gath

the most troublesome bt all tho annual

begun speedily Ha ifin have tho bill

aioit Connplcnooa Member
From all appearances Mr Sherman
will be the most conspicuous member
of tho House during tho short session
barring only the Speaker The Rules
Committee will have few battles to
fight this Winter but Mr Sherman al
ways enjoys the confidence of the
Speaker in fact has been a prominent
lieutenant in recent years and will par
ticipate more prominently now than
ever in tho councils touching legisla
tion His presence after March 4 as the
presiding officer of the Senate will pro
mote good will between the Senate and
the House leaders who are altogether
too prone to demonstrations of force
one side against tho other It is a very
long time since a veteran member of
tho House was Vice President Mr
Fairbanks tho present incumbent of
the VIco JPrcefdency never served In
the House but put off his toga on
March 4 1905 to take his present office
He had been prominently identified
with Senatorial councils but had been
little in touch with House affairs
Of course Representative Sereno E
Payne of New York will be a more
prominent man than ever this Winter
at the Capitol He has In charge the
framing of the new tariff law The
work on that measure is going ahead
vigorously The Ways and Means Com
mittee Is still conducting hearings and
will bo for two or three weeks perhaps
They are tryiny to get at the facts as
to the scheduler before holding execu
tive meetings for writing tho language
of the prospective law
Hundreds of people are coming to
Washington for a few words with the
Chairman They want to give him In
formation that will further their own
interests and wishes with regard to the
tariff Mr Payne however is not con
ducting his work in a corner Hitherto
there has been much secret and pri
vate work In the preparation of a tariff
law Men have gone to tho apartments
of the Ways and Means Chairman and
told him there what ought or ought not
to bo done Mr Payne has decided to
eliminate that form of procedure He
wants all the testimony pro and con to
be givon publicly that ail the commit
tee members and the people may bene
fit from It
Where the BUI Will Be Written
Tho bill will be written in executive
meetings of tho Republican members
of the committee Tho Democratic
members will be excluded therefrom It
was thatTvay when the Dingley law was
framed It Is not exnected that tho
minority would agree with the majority
aoout tno rates of duty to be fixed
Accordingly they could not render any
assistance wnen tne Bin has bcon all
made up there will be a meeting of the
ontiro Ways and Means Committee and
theyDemocrats will bo shown tho
work of their Republican colleagues
Then they will have opportunity for
criticism and opposition but it will not
be till after the extra session which
will be tho first session of the 61st Con
gress has assembled
The impression grows that the House
Intends to give the country a very
thoro revision of tariff schedules The
Republicans of Ways and Means are all
talking that way Including the stanch
stand patters Tho latter take the
ground that thero seems to be a very
general demand thruout the country for
a real revision and that the country is
entitled to have what it wants as long
as ample provision is made for suffi
cient revenues with which to run the
United States Government It does not
yet appear what the attitude of tho
Senate Is going to be DUt that will de
velop later
President elect Taft Is on record as
favoring a very thoro revision which is
another reason for the House taking
tho same attitude During his Visit here
this week Mr Taft Is discussing tariff
matters with many Senators and Rep
resentatives They are getting his ideas
about it in more detail and are learn
ing what schedules he particularly
wishes to be reduced and what ones he
wants rafscd
Somo interesting evidence about the
making of the Dingley law and the op
erations thereof are expected before the
Ways and Means Committee concludes
Its hearings President elect Taft is
watching tho testimony of the wit
nesses and is understood to have sent
certain men to appear there He has
been anxious for the consumers to have
ample opportunity for a hearing and
when he was in Washington about a
month ago said their side of the caso
should not bo neglected H E Miles
of the National Association of Manu
facturers was one of the recent wit
nesses before the committee after he
had been In consultation with tho President-elect
WHnoaieit to I5e Subpenncd
It Is expected that the committee will
be authorized by the House this week
to compel the attendance of witnesses
by subpena whereupon a number of
those who have refused to appear will
be summoned There havo been somo
rather disagreeable charges about tho
way the duties on wools and woolens
were made up by tho Senate Committee
on Finance in 1897 It has been brought
out that S N D North now Director
of tho Census Bureau but then Secre
tary of tho American Woolen Associa
tion with headquarters In Boston came
to Washington as a clerk of a Senate
subcommittee wlgrc he was in aposi
tion to aid thoso who wanted high du
ties imposed on wool tops and woolen
manufactures Mr North has protested
that he had no guilty connection with
the making of the Dingley law but the
Ways and Means Committeo Is disposed
to inquire into the part that some other
people played during the rewriting of
the tariff bill In the Finance Committee
12 years ago There is also talk of
summoning several newsptjer editors
and others who have been critics of the
Dingley law to ascertain whether they
can give the committee any light
It is a prevalent cpnvictlon with
members of tho Ways and Means that
a vast deal of unreliable testimony has
been delivered regarding the necessity
for duties They fiavo done their ut
most to persuade manufacturers and
the representatives of manufacturing
Interests to tell a straightforward story
but these men are very eager to retain
the present high duties and havo pro
ceeded on the theory that it would be
better to claim they needed much In
the belief that they would get -more In
tho end thereby than by stating what
tho conditions actually arer t
So the real sifting process may come
when witnesses aro brought to Wash
ington who can tell the other side The
complaint has been that the averago

The Presidenfs Message
Another Vigorous State Paper On the
Affairs of the People
President Roosevelt sent to Congress
Tuesday the lost annual message of his
two AtlrnlnlstriTtlons If Tpa speeded
to the Capit61Uri tfmo for presentation
to Senate arid Houso as soon as the
committees to notify the President for
mally that Congress was In session
had reported Pamphlet copies were
then distributed to Senators and -Representatives
who occupied the hour arid
more In which the reading clerks were
voicing its contents to a stiidled perusal
of the pages
All In all the message was eagerly
awaited both because It Is always the
first thing at the beginning of a session
of Congress and because of its bearing
upon the plans of the Administration
and to a degrecrupon the plans of the
next Administration It furnished the
Congressmen no particular surprises
altho the exhaustive discussion of seven
topics finances corporations labor
protection for wage workers the courts
forests and Inland waterways was of
very great Interest to the Congressmen
at this time
There Is no direct mention of the re
cent campaign in the message but the
President devotes much attention to
several questions that were prominent
In that struggle In a long discussion
of the courts he alludes to Judges wjio
are the real bulwark of the courts--the
Judges of the stamp of the President-elect
who have been fearless In
opposing labor when It has gone
wrong Ho says succinctly much that
he said during the campaign regarding
tho efforts to pwing the labor voto to
Bryan declaring that tho wage-workers
the worklngmen the laboring men
of the country by the way in which
they repudiated the effort to get them
to cast their votes in response to an
appeal to class hatred have emphasized
their sound patriotism and American
ism
Topics SIscunsciI
The seven topics mentioned which
are first treated by the President com1
prlso two thirds of the entire message
There are 10 other topics such as Na
tional parks -denatured alcohol
pure food the Indian Servlce
census e ducatou redistribution of
bureaus and fisheries Foreign
affairs which usually comprises a
good portion of a Presidents message
Is disposed of In half a dozen lines
that this Nations foreign policy i3
based on the theory that right must be
dono between Nations precisely as be
tween individuals He devotes as
many pages to forests as lines to foreign
affairs and further emphasizes the im
portance of preserving the forests by
describing numerous photographs of the
results of deforstration In north China
It thus becomes the first of illustrated
annual messages to Congress altho a
few years ago the President sent in a
special illustrated message on the Pan
ama Canal
Mr Roosevelt writes a vivid descrip
tion of a recent Investigation into con
ditions in north China by Frank N
Meyer of tho Bureau of Plant -Industry
of tho Department of Agriculture tells
how reckless deforestation is prac
tically extending the Mongol desert
eastward how the level of tho Sun
garl River In northern Manchuria has
been sensibly lowered and makes the
situation thero a forcible object lesson
for tlie people of tho United States
In every topic the President charac
teristically hits straight out from tho
shoulder His message begins with a
discussion of finances in which Con
gressmen see an answer to the wide
spread criticism of the excessive cost of
Government during his seven years in
cumbency and to the occasional warn
ings regarding an embarrassing Treas
ury deficit Ho says tho financial man
agement of tho Nations interests dur
lns the last seven years iias shown the
most satisfactory results but asks
Congress to establish a thoroly good
currency system which will do away
with existing defects One reads be
tween the lines something of tho Presi
dents personal pride that between July
1 1901 and Sept 30 1908 which cov
ers nearly the entire period ho has been
in office the net ordinary receipts ex
ceed the net ordinary expenses by
992S341354
About Corporation1
Much that he says about corporations
has been said In his previous messages -or
In other utterances He asks that
the railways of the country be put
completely under the Interstate Com-
mcrce Commission and removed from
the domain ot the anti trust law- Ho
wants legislation to prevent 3wlndlingi
stoqk speculation He also recommends-that
telegraph and telephono
cpmpanejnlnterstaceaujlness be put
under theInterstate Commerce Com
missions jurisdiclidn
The message teems with economic
discussion both under the topics of
corporations and labor It barely
refers to a progressive Inheritance tax
on large fortunes The President de
clares there- should rjjJonger be any
paltering with the qucstfoETTif takine
care of the wage workers who under
our present Industrial system ara
killed become crippled or worn out aa
part of the regular incidents of a given
business He recommends that the
Government employers liability act bo
strengthened in several particulars at
once and extended to all Government
employes especially peace officers
This Nation he says is singled out in
Europe a3 the most belated in respect
to employers liability legislation
The President never before devoted
so much of an annual message to tho
courts It was quickly noted at the Cap
itol that his tone In dealing with Fed
eral Judges is far lcs3 critical than for
merly Congress raised the salaries of
all Federal Judges about five years ago
The President recommends a still fur
ther advance He would double tha
salaries of the Supreme Court Judges
which would give them 25000 a year
The protests of organized labor against
the courts and the Judges are referred
to and -much is said about what the
conduct of Judges should be in the in
terpretation of the law The decisions
of tho courts on social and economic
questions runs tho message depend
upon their economic and social philoso
phy and for the peaceful progress of
our people during the 20th century wo
shall owe most to those Judges who
hold to a 20th century -economic and
social philosophy and not to a long
outgrown philosophy which was Itself
the product of primitive economic con
ditions Tho President thinks that
anyremedy applied from without 13
fraughfwith risks
MoreCcntrnllatlon
The centralization idea- pervades tho
message which the President says is
one of the prime purposes If not tho
prime purpose for which the Consti
tution was founded He recommends
that the National Soldiers Homes bo
