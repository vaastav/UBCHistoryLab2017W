nel. The tract of ground known as tho old
I Union dopot site, bounded by Ninth and
Tenth avenues, and Seventh and Tenth
strocts, Is looked on with such favor by the
Oroat Western as a location for the road's
depot that an offer of $20,000 has been
j maim ijjt iiic tiKtiuB oi me rniiroau company
tor mt property.
For some time the comnnny has been
willing to pay $lS,00fi for the tract, but the
ownoM have held out for a higher figure
and In the meantime there haa been talk of
condemnation proceedings. Tho Great West
ern people, however, are of the opinion that
J peaceful methods are to be preferred and
I have Increased tho ofTor. Tho figure now
I offered by tho railroad company Is Fatlsfac
I tory to the owners of the land and the con
tracts have been drawn and the deal prac
tically clostd.
Heviral years ago these three blocks of
ground were bought by an organization of
local capitalists, who then contemplated
tho eractlou oi a union pa88cngr station.
The location Is regarded as an excellent ono
for a paascngcr station and In securing It
the (Jreat Western feels It Is putting Itself
on a footing to compete with other roads
entering tho city.
Tho point of entrance of the new road Into
the city has not been announced, but It Is
generally believed that neither tho Indlin
creek route nor the tunnel route will bo
utilized, but that tho new road will come
"around tho horn."

Doyle Files an , niemleil Petition

Wiiuts f ioiii Hums,
Tho trial of tho Doyle-Hums case mada
good progress In the district court yester
day afternoon. Attorney Hughes for Doylo
concluded his nrgument nt 3 o'clock In tho
nftcrnoon nnd Congressman Wnlter I. Smith
entered upon the opening argument for
Hums. Mr. Smtlh talked until thu hour
of adjournment and then Intimated to tho
court that ho was nearly through nnd
would probnly finish within an hour or two
this morning.
On tho reconvening of court In tho morn
ing Mr. Hughes did not resume his argu
ment until Judge Rreeii had taken time
to pass on slxty-threo interrogatories sub
mitted by the attorneys for thu defendant.
Of tho cntlro number Judge Orcen left
standing less than a dozen of tho Interroga
tories. Theso Included a question as to
whether Doylo and Hums did really enter
Into a partnership on February 2, 1S;2, ns
claimed by Doylo. Throe of them nsk tho
Jury to find whether Doylo owned an In
terest In tho Iiohtnll No. 2, the Tidal Wave
nnd tho Devil's Own respectively. Another
Inquires Into whether Doylo and Hums
inado nn exchungo on tho Portland and
Prof. Orubbs, Hums taking a half In
tcrost In tho Portland In exchnngo for a llko
Interest In the Prof. Orubbs. Other ques
tions left tn bo anowercd by tho Jury
born on tho share that Hurnrf nnd Doylo
ench contributed tn thu fund of $2.".000
paid to llernlcn C. Heed for Mb services In
making tho consolidation of tho properties
posslblo.
In concluding his nrgument Mr. Ilugheti
outlined to tho Jury whnt the plaintiff Is
contending for, nnd according to his com
putations tho amount asked closely ap
proaches $1,000,000.
Judge Smith began his argument by In
quiring Into tho rcasofiH for the bringing
of tho suit by Doylo in this county. Mr.
Hughos had said on Doylo'u behalf that thuy
hnd come hero with the suit berauno this
was the homo of tho Portland Oold Mining
company ami because they had nn absolute
right to do ho. Judgu Smith In reply
charged that tho reoson tho suit
was brought here was becnusu Doylo
feared to try It among his nclghbora In
Colorado, nnd declared that the only thing
tho Portland company having Iti head
quarters hero had to do with the suit being
brought hero was that to sue Hums hero
Doylo had to catch hi in hero nnd that ho
did this when Hums canio to tho city '
to nttend un nnnunl meeting of tho corpo
ration. This lino of thought wns kept
beforo tho Jury In thn trentmont of tho va
rious witnesses tnken up by Judge Smith
nnd tho question frequently naked If theso
woro not witnesses tlint Doylo might well
prefer to tnko beforo n strnngo Jury to
taking thorn beforo men who knew them.

former partnors In huslncBS nnd each spo

othors. Pnrtlculnr nttcutlou wns pnld to
the vltncsses Klldny, Fife, Wash, Finn,
O'Hnlro, Mrs. Stedmau and Doylo himself.
Judge Smith charged that Doylo had on alx
different occasions stated under oath that ho
had no Interest In tho claims In which ho Is
now claiming a half and cited ench of tho
instances. With both parties to tho suit
thus tiwearlng that Doylo has no Interest in
theso claims Judgo Smith called on tho
Jury to tell "what aro wo hero for?"

ATLANTIC, In.. Dec. 1G. (Special Tele
gram.) At n met'tlng of the republican
county central committee In Atlantic a
set of primary election rules has been
adopted nnd Cass rounty republicans will
hereafter name their candidates for county
olllce, delegates to tho state, congressional
and Judicial convention, also the members
of tho county central commltteo by direct
vote Instead of through tho old delegate
convention plan.
Tho rule governing Cass county primaries
Is copied from tho many now In use in
other counties, the best points of several
different sets of rules being adopted, whllo
several new fentures of an original nature
aro added. It Ih thought by the party lead
ers throughout tho county that thu primary
system will mid much strength to the party
In tho county nnd will nssuro such nominees
as tho rank and file of the purty will sup
port nnd prevent such general wholesalo
scratching of tickets as the party has had
to contend with for severnl years owing to
tho combinations made In the conventions
and the nominating of candidates who could
not poll the party vote at the election.
