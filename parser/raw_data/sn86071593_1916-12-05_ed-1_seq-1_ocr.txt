the invading armies are moving with
out clfective oppo.sit ion. I'loesei is on
the lino of the only railroad route of
retreat for the Rumanians operating in
the vicinity of Bucharest. The threat
to Ploesci seemingly means the speedy
abandonment of Bucharest, if the I J 11 -inaniaiis
hope to make an effective re
treat over the railroad line toward Mol

NEGOTIATIONS FOR
PEACE DISCUSSED
i Newsnaiiflr Kavs flermanv Should Ac
cept the Services of President
Only as Messenger.
LONDON, Dee. .". An article predict
ing the approach of peace negotiations lias
appeared in the Berlin Tageblatt and i
quoted in an Amsterdam despatch to the
Kxchangi? Telegraph company. The
Tageblatt .says: "The moment is near
uhen a business peace will be possible, a
peace which the allies and the central
powers cafl discuss in view of the securi
ties they possess. Of course those who
consider such a propo-al miibt not be al
lowed to return home empty handed.
The status quo ante helium is impossible
since the independence of Poland is pro
claimed, but it i.s remarkable that the
number of Germans who wish to annex
Belgium has shrunk recently to almost
nothing while many pan-Germans are
teady today to listen to the words 'pa
citism' without, protest."
The Yosfischo Zeitung also prints an ar
ticle discussing the possibility of jieace. It
says that "probably Ambassador Gerard
is retaining to Germany with some peace
proposal." If such i.s the case, the paper
goes on. "America is an unsuitable media
tor and if warned Germany will accept the
services of President Wilson only as a
messenger and not as an arbitrator."

CHICAGO, Dec. 5. Chicago 's diet

the present prices of foodstuffs it is
practicable to live well on 40 cents a
day, Dr. .John D. Hobertson, city health
commissioner, asserted today the final
day of the health department's two
week's test. "The exact cost will not
be known until after dinner tonight,"
lie said, "but from tentative figures
compiled 1 believe the average expen
diture per day for each of the members
of the squad will be about "0 cents.
All but one of the persons taking the

that the experiment has been a suc

J. D. Archbold Faited to Ral
ly. Following Operation
for Appendicitis
ONE OF ORIGINAL
TRUSTEES OF TRUST
It Is Estimated That His Fortune, Made
Almost Entirely by Oil and its By
products, Was Nearly $100,000,000
Gave Syracuse University $400,000.
TAPRYTOYVX, X. Y., Dec. 5.-John D.
ArchlH)ld, president of the Standard Oil
company of New .Jersey, died in his home
here about 4 o'clock this morning. Mr.
ArthlM.krs death followed an illness of less
than two weeks.
He was oimted upon for appendicitis
Nov. Si, and at first he seemed to rallv,
but later he suffered a relapse, lilood
transfusion was resorted to, Mr. Areh
bold's chauffeur volunteering as the sub
ject of this operation. Mr. Archbold
showed increased strength and physicians
were optimistic that the improvement
would be jiermanent.
Funeral services will be held here
Thursday forenoon. While the services
are taking place Tarry-town industries will
suspend operation as a memorial to Mr.
Aichbold's democracy in tlie village of his
resilience. Mr. Archbold is survived by
his wife, a son, John F. Archlndd, and
two daughters. Mrs. M. M. Van lfuren
of Newport, 11. I., and Mrs. Armar D.
JNiundeiMm of Lyndhurst, England.
John D. Archbold was almost as clisely
identilied with the history of the Standaiil
Oil as John 1). Rockefeller himself. Of
the first nine trustees of the "trust"
formed in ls;- he alone mnained in this
capacity until its dissolution in 101 1 at
the order of the I'nited States supreme
court, and it was lie who was named to
ei.gincer the dissolution, after which ho
U'came president ami director of the Stan
dard Od company of New Jersey. He was
the most active and aggressive tighter in
the oil combine, and invariably represent
ed the Standard Oil on the witness stand
in the numerous hearings in connection
with the governments suit to dissolve it.
This publicity was still further height
ened by the publication of a score or
more of letters from Mr. Archbold to .lo
scph 11. Foiaker, then senator from Ohio,
Representative Joseph C. Sibley of Penn
sylvania and other statesmen showing tlmt
large sums of money had been distributed
for the alleged purpose of influencing fa
vorable legislation, at Washington. Mr.
Archbold eonsideied them as attorneys'
fees. The publication of these letters ex
posed Mr. Archbold to attack from eveiv
quarter.
John Dustin Archbold was born at
Leesburg, (., July 'Jtl, 1S4S, and was work
ing in a country store at Salem, (., when
ho heard of the wonderful oil regions in
western Pennsylvania where men were be
coming rich over night. In 1M1 he went
to the oil fields and became a refiner and
buyer at Titusviilo. He became the agent
of a new company, the Acme company,
which proved to be an offshoot of the
Rockefeller interests, and from that time,
in 1S75, until his death he was an associate
of the Rockefellers.
It has been estimated that his fortune,
made almost entirely in oil and its by
products, was nearly $lim,HMi,0f)0.
Mr. Archbold was one of the lxst in
formed of men in the details of the oil
business in all its branches, and he held.
according to Ins own statement, that all
the practiced of the Standard Oil company
were nonorauie. ami. he iielieved. in con-
'ormity to law.
'"1 stand unouestionablv." ho said in de
fending the trust idea, '"for eo-ojierative
volution. I believe that the Lucre enc-
porations of the present day represent
more nearly this co-operation than anv
ther sytem yet undertaken."
Although Mr. Archbold was not nartio-
ulnrlv eiincniciioiis as :i luinofui.tm tm
made many large gifts, including a sum of
Moo,ooo to yracnse I niversity in one
lump, besides annual donations of (smaller

no demonstration either from floor or
galleries.

three months in the house of correction
