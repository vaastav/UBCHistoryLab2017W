t LAND DKPAIITMENT.
There was a brief - session of the
state land board yesterday. They
fixed 4 o'clock p. in. as the hour at
which surveyors shall close their
books of reri:try on the day prior to
the ten days bt-l'oro the board meets
to consider applications from land
purchasers.
The board, by resolution, required

The board tacitly agreed that where
a party has bought his quota of land
under former laws ho will not be en

THE NEW CAPITOL WORK.
The question as to whether the cap
itol syndicate can take possession of
the lands set apart for the contract to
build the stale capitol, hits been re
ferred to the attorney-general for his
opinion. On general principles it
would seem that the contractors
should have a quantum uiernit ior
their work as it progresses, unless the
contract provides to the contrary.
Tho letter from Architect Myers,
relative to the resignation of Superin
tendent Clark, has been received, but
is more of a personal than public mat

Mr. O. Marble, architect of the New
Orleans cotton exchange.
TUB LEGALITY GF "BRIDGE BONDS"
QUESTIONED.
Attorney General Templeton fur
nishes Gov. Ireland the following im
portant opinions as to the legality of
"bridge bonds" issued by the counties.
The object of Gov. Ireland's inquiry
doubtless is with reference to the
board of education investing school
funds.
Austin, Texas, Dec. 3. 1883.
Ills Excellency John Ireland, Governor and
President board o Education:
Sib: I have the honor to acknowl
edge the receipt of your letter of the
30th ult., calling for my opinion as to
111C t3fUlltJ Ui. tUQ UUQ (lUU tUC V(U1U"
ity of negotiable bonds issued by cer
tain counties for the purpose of rais
ing f untls wherewith to build bridges
and known as "bridga bonds." Ac
companying your letter is ai argu
ment, or an opinion, by II. II. Iler
m;ui, Esq., in support of the validity
of such bonds, citing quite a number
of authorities, most of which I have
examined with all due care. I have
concluded from an examination of
our constitutional and statutory pro
visions, and from a careful considera
tion of the authorities, that the com
mlssioneis courts of the counties are
without authority to issue such bonds
having all the Incidents, elements and
immunities of negotiable paper, pass
ing from hand to hand with all in
quiry into their consideration and the
honesty and good faith of thoir issu
ance cut off and precluded in the
hands of purchasers for value as the
'case with such paper.
' Section 21, article 16, of the consti
tution, quoted in Mr. Herman's argu
ment, provides that "the legislature
shall make provision for the laying
out and working public roads, for the
building of bridges, and for utilizing
hnpfl- frirfpirnrpa Arm pnnvipr. lidinr tr
all these purposes." If this section
supplies authority to issue bridge
bonds it is authority as much for issu
ing bonds, both for laying out public
roads and for working them. But I
have never heard of its being claimed
for it that it gave any color of authori
ty for issuing bonds for the two last
named purposes. Indeed the section
itself seems to me, in phun terms, to
deny the idea that it intended to con
fer such power, for it says that the
fines, forfeitures, and the county con
vict labor are to be utilized for all
these purposes; and, in fact, without
" legislation it meant nothing, for it
only imposed a duty on the legislature
to make provision for building
bridges, public wonks and laying out
roads.
I do not mean to say (for it does not
enter this question) that it takes from
the legislature the power to clothe
county commissioners' courts with
the authority to issue bonds for such
a purpose; I only say that it does not
per" se do it.- It is not un
worthy some consideration that this'
section is not found in that part
of the constitution relating to the
matters of taxation and revenue,
where the taxation for the state,
county and cities is to some, extent
provided for and regulated.
It is attempted to derive the author
ity to create such debts and issue such
obligations with their consideration,
and whether or not they were issued
in corruption, peculation and fraud
and for which the counties may have
received nothing, sacredly beyond
question, after having passed into the
hands of bona tide purchasers for
valued; "from article 4431, revised
statutes, conferring on the county
commissioners courts full power "to
cause all necessary bridges to be built
and kept in repair," and" "to make ap
propriations of the money of the
county therefor;" and from article
4133, providing that when bonds have
been ls3ued or may thereafter be
issued for the purpose of building
bridges, it shall be lawful for the com
missioners courts of the county or
counties interested to assess and col
lect tolls on said bridges sufficient to
pay the interest and principal on the
bonds so issued.
Article 4 !3i wa3 taken by the codi
ficrs from stction 4, chapter 55, laws
of 1870, the same being "an act to o
, ganize commissioners courts and to
deline their jurisdiction and duties
and to provide for vacancies therein."
, The rest of this section, but little
change is found in article 1514 of the
Itevised Statutes, relating to the
powers and duties of the comiuisson-
ers court, where among other things.
ic is autnorizeu to "establish lemes,
lay out and '.'establish roads, provide
, and repair court houses and jails, pro
vide for the support of paupers and
such idiots and lunatics as cannot be
admitted to tho asvlum," and to "pro
vide for the burial f paupers." Thi3
collocation and mere change of ar
rangement was not intended to oper
ate as a new enactment, or to change
the meaning of these provisions of
the said chapter E3 (final title 11. S.,
section 19). having for its purpose
the organization, etc., of the commis
sioners' court; and if then the article
(1131) is authority to put in circula
tion these bonds for the building of
bridges, article 1514 the remainder of
- the original section will be equal au
thority to issue specific bonds tor all
the purposes (specified therein- At
any rate I confess to an inability to
work out tho authority for one of
these descriptions of bonds without at
the same time working out like power
to put in circulation bonds for the
others. , . '
It is not believed that anyone coull
claim for the court any such power.
But tho article (4431) provides that
these bridges are to tie buiit and kept
in repair by appropriations from line
county treasury, this of itself pointing
to the source whence tho money is to
come which may be needed to execute
the power conferred by it. Then,
taken in connection with acts 4430 32
'33 and '34 revised statutes, itreems to
clearly show that it was not intended
to say that negotiable bonds could be
issued for sucn a purpose, tor it ap
pears that bridges are to be built by
the labor of the people in the different
road precincts where situated, subject
to road duty, and by appropriations of
money from the county treasury.
1 will only remark on act 4Ua, that
if such bonds have been issued under
any valid law of the state, it has ref
erence to them, and should any such
bonds be hereafter issued, it win also
have reference to them. It is not
usual for the legislature to leave such
extraordinary authority to far-fetched
mlluences. It has not done so in tne
matter of cities bonding themselves
(acts 420, 421, 422, revised statutes),
and it would hardly be less watchful
of the welfare of the counties.
It seems to have deemed it neces
sary to pass an act speciflcially author
izing the emission of bonds for the
erection of the most important and
indispensable of all public buildings
the court house an I it saw proper
to prescribe the maximum rate of in
terest and time the bonds should run
(chap. 9, session laws of 1881, page 5.)
J5ut if these bonds can be issued there
is no such limitation on the exercise
of the power that I have been able to
find. If, as Chief Justice Willie says,
in Brown vs. Graham, 58 Tex., 256, the
power to levy a tax must be plainly
and unmistakably conferred by the
the commissioners' court, "either by
exriress words or bv necess.irv impli
cation," is it not at least equally nec
essary to look for as definite authority
"for all our limited territorial boards
charged with certain objects of neces-
sary local administration to become
the fountains of commercial issues,
capaple of Moating about in the finan
cial whirlpools of our large cities,"
which may, indeed, most necessitate
the levying and collection of a tax for
their payment for such period of time
as the court may see proper to allow
the bonds to run.
The supremo court of the United
States, in discussing just such a ques
tion in the case or. I'onee J ury vs. urit
ton, 15 Wallace, pp. 571-2, say: "It
seem3 to us to be a power" (to issue
commercial paper) "quite distinct from
that of incurring indebtedness for im
provements actually authorized and
undertaken.the justness and vality of
which may always be inquired into.
It is a power winch ought not to be
implied from the mere authority to
make such improvements. It is one
thing for county or parish trustees to
have the power to incur obligations
for work actually done in behalf of
the county or parish, and to give
proper vouchers therefor, and a totally
different thing to have the power of
issuing unimpeachable paper obliga
tions which may be mult iplied to an
indefinate extent. If it be once con
ceeded that the trustees or other local
representatives of townships, counties
and parishes have the implied power j
to issue coupon bonds, payable at a
future day, which may be valid and
binding obligations in the hands of
innocent purchasers, there will be
no end to the frauds that
will be perpetrated." (p. 571-2). Tho
court conclued (and it is well
known the length to which that
court his gone in sustaining the au
thority to issue such paper,) that the
duty of making certain specified im-
Erovements and of collecting money
y taxation to defray expanses there
of did not imply the authority to issue
negotiable paper to raise the funds to
pay for the improvements. The case
seems to be directly in point, and is
well worthy of a careful reading by
county oflicers attempting to exercise
such power.
It is not necessary to consider
whether or not counties may issue
certificates or vouchers evidencing
their indebtedness for such service,
leaving it open always to the counties
to inquire into their consideration and
validity in any hands into which they
may come. If that can be done, it
does not follow that negotiable bonds
discharged of all defences can also be
issued. I have the honor to be
Very respectfully

Got Caught.
Our readers will remember that
some time ago one William Shelley
was arrested for horsa stealing, on a
warrant issued by Justice von Rosen
berg. One Alf Swank was the princi
pal witness against him, and it was
expected that his evidence would send
Shelley into the service of the state
for a number of years. He told the
justice of the peace a wonderful tale
of what he knew in regard to Mr.
Shelley, and his peculiar ideas of the
rights of possession of personal prop
erty, particularly that kind of
property the horse. It was upon
the prospects of his telling his
blood-curdling tale in court
that Shelley was put under
arrest. A day was fixed for trial ana
Mr. Shelley was held for examina
tion. At this interval facts came to
light that seemed to indicate that Mr.
Swank might be mistaken and per
haps he was in error as to the identi
ty of the man who had stolen the
equines instead of its being Shelley
it probably might prove to be. a man
by the euphonious name of Swank.
Of course any man is liable to make
a little mistake like that. It seems
that Mr. Shelley himself doubted the
identity of his man somewhat and
when a friend of his informed
him that the justice had
his suspicions on the subject of the
identification of the horse thief his
extreme love of justice prompted him
to migrate. He had been subpoenaed
to appear and testify at the prelimi
nary trial of Shelley, and to disobey
would subject him to a punishment
for contempt of court; but when a
man, from a sence of duty, makes up
his mind to migrate he cann-t pay
much attention to a trifle like
incurring the contempt of
a court. Mr. Swank thought
the matter all over and he came
to the humane conclusion that if he
had made a mistake as to the identifi
cation of Mr. fchelley, in justice to
Mr. Shelly he ought to visit some
friends who very much desired to see
him on the day set for the prelimina
ry trial; and the more he thought the
matter over the more he became con
vinced that it was his duty to migrate.
He migrated. ' ;
The day for the examination of
Shelley came. and with it
came not Mr. Swank. It
came - out more fully at
that examination that it realy was a
case of mistaken identity and that
the absent witness had actually mis
taken Shelley for a man by the name
of Swank, against whom there were
grave grounds to suspect he had mis
taken a neighbor's horses for his own.
Shelley was discharged as a matter of
course, and here the matter dropped.
bwanK alter ne nad visited his mends
and waited, as he thought, a sufficient
length.of time for the matter to cool
concluded he would pay a visit to
Austin and ascertain what had been
the fate of the unfortunate man who
had been the victim of his careless
ness. He walked into Von Rosen
berg's office yesterday and inquired
what had become of the case against
Shelley. The justice gave him the
desired information and Swank was
about to depart, happy, when the
strangest part of the remarkable epi
sode occurred. Justice Von Rosen
berg thought he discovered a striking
resemblsnce between the real horse
thief and the man before
him, and so he ordered Mr. Swank un
der arrest, and the man who had come
out of curiosity went hence in the
custody of an under sheriff to the
county jaii. He was greatly surprised
at the action of the justice of the
peace, and stoutly protested that he
was not the man wanted. ; but he is
the man, or it is another case of mis
taken identity.
Many persons wiil take medicine

assistance require!. Try them.
CITY MATTE KS IX BRIEF.
Another span of the bridge almost
finished.
Tho total vote cast in the city Mon
day was 1981.
The case of C. D. Johns vs. the city
wllL without doubt, be carried to the
supreme court, we learned yesterday.
The president s message will be
found in full in to-day's issue. It is a
lengthy document, but will be found
to be interesting reading.
Rev. Dr. Smoot, of this city, left
yesterday for Georgetown to attend
the funeral of Rev. Hilary Mosely,
pastor of the Presbyterian church,, of
that place.
We are in receipt of an invitation
to attend a grand ball and enjoy re
freshments to be given by the young

contract growing out of a shipment of
cotton was tried before a jury in the
district court yesterday. Verdict,
$14.45.
"Uneasy lies the head that wears a

new city council for a continuance of
their tenure of office.
At the game of foot ball, played
vesterdav between the University
boys and the Bickler school boys, the
hLtter trot awav with the silk-hat
fresh-men lively. So say the Bickler
boys who reported to The States
man office.
Now that we have a new council it
is to be hoped that something liberal
will bo done in the way of fixing the
streets of the city. The new board
can cover themselves with immortal
glory by acting promptly in this mat
ter. Let there be no delay.
The mayor celebrated his re-election
by taxing Geo. Malone five dollars for
an election drunk. Peter Erza five
dollars for another of the same species,
James "Alexander five dollars for dis
turbing the peace and Ed. Montgom
ery 25 for carrying a pistol.
The totals vote on the school tax is
826, of which 597 , are for and 229
against the tax, giving a majority of
308. The tax in order to carry had to
receive two-thirds of the votes cast,
which would be 550. so it has carried
and has 57 votes more th:in the law
requires.
If the county purchase the new
bridge, as it is said it certainly will,
and a lino of street cars is extended to
the other side of the river, quite a
number of prominent citizens indicate
their intention of building magnifi
cent residences on the showy bluffs
across the river.
Mr. Chas. McXeal, the telegraph
operator who took the president's
message for this paper yesterday, de
serves a special compliment. Every
word was fully reported and written
in a bold, legible hand. It was the
most creditable piece of telegraphic
reporting that has come under our no
tice for a long while.
In justice to Mr. Heidbrink it should
be stated that when about forty votes
had been cast in the Ninth ward Mon
day, he withdrew his name and pub
lished a circular requesting all his
friends to vote for one of the other
candidates. This accounts for the
smallness of the vote he received.
Mr. R. M. Johnston, Austin man
ager of the Houston Daily Post, has
been solicited to become a candidate
for clerk of council. It is not known
whether he will accept the position or
not. He would undoubtedly make a
good clerk if appointed. It is under
stood that T. L. Purnell is also a can
didate for the appointment.
In the county court yesterday, Ben
Williams said he was guilty of taking
a small amount of another man's pro
perty and using it as his own, for
which Judge Fullmore fined him 50.
Joe Hawkins and John Anderson
committed the same error, for which
oversight the judge rewarded them by
a month's board at the county's ex
pense. It is reported that the gobblers lost
by Major Joe, were taken by Budd
Driskill and L. M. Crooker while the
major was absent looking after elec
tion matters. One thing is certain,
the major lost his gobblers, and these
men when asked failed to deny that
they had been gobbling while the
major was off attending to his patri
otic duties.
The Ladies' Reading Room Sewing
society will meet to-morrow (Thurs
day) evening at 2 o'clock in the parlor
of the Avenue Hotel, to prepare pretty
and useful article for the reading room
fair. Those who cannot come at that
hour will please be welcomed later,
and it is hoped that without further
invitation the room may be filled.
The enterprising ladies in charge of
the entertainment at the opera house
the night of the 8th December, for the
benefit of the Women's exchange as
sure us that they are preparing some
novel and interesting features for the
occasion, in addition to the fine mu
sical programme which will be pre
sented. Due announcement will be
made in The Statesman.
From the report of the city sexton,
found elsewhere, it wm oe noticed
that during the month of November
there were thirty-six deaths in thi3
city, of which twenty-two were males
and fourteen females. Fourteen or
almost half were under five years of
age and three bet wen live and twenty,
showing a large mortality among the
little folks. Two were from the coun
ty, outside the city, and two were
brought from elsewhere, to be interred
in Austin, making the actual total in
the city thirty-two.
A very interesting case was called
last night in the district court and is
now on trial, entitled J ane urm and
husband vs. the Houston & Texas
Central railroad. It is a cuo for per
sonal injuries for which tli 3 plaintiff,
Jane Bnn, claims $20,,uO damages,
Walton & Hill, of this city, and Col.
Harrison, of Houston, are the counsel
for the plaintiffs, and Judge Uolu-
thwaite, of Houston, the well known
railroad attorney, is the advocate for
the defendant corporation. The case
will be hotly contested.
The council did not meet last night
and it is said will not until Saturday.
There are several reasons why the
newly-elected gentlemen postponed
their inaugural. In the first place it
will require ten more desks to accom-
date the extra members and they
could not be provided before that
time; again they wished to have a lit
tle time in which to allow the candi
dates for appointment to prepare
their minds as to the proper choice to
be made; and last but not least, they
deemed it prudent to take a little
respite after the fatigue, consequent
upon an aldermanic election.
The entertainment at Turner nail
last nicht passed off auite creditably.
The instrumental solo by Miss Julia
Palm was well received; the song by
Mr. G. P. Warner won applause; the
performance by Mrs. M. Townsend
was skillful; the Magnetic Waltz song
by .Miss tsimpson w:is highly delight
ful; Miss Odom's instrumental solo
was excellent; Miss Nita Smith's
"Moonlight, Sweet Moonlight" was
well rendered: and the quartettes bv
Misses Simpson and Preston and
Messrs. Edwards and Warner good.
The other features or the entertain
ment were all well received.
Justice Von Rosenberg yesterday
handed his resignation to the com
missioners' court. He is a candidate
for city recorder before the new
council, and as he cannot hold both
offices he has resigned the one he now
holds. This would seem to indicate
mat J usuce v on ltosetaoerg has re
viewed the troops and knows just
now the battle is to end so tar as that
office is Involved; else he would not
surrender his present office. Well, he
has made a good justice and will, no
doubt, tax the offenders of the city
ordinances equally satisfactorily if he
is to ce recorder.
Jim Organ and a woman of color,
Fannie Whipple, had a lively time
yesterday. Jim worked hard all day
Monday and got his patriotic nature
so wrought up that he took a stick
and began to pound the dark skinned
Fannie ovr the head .and shoulders
with the aforesiaid club, inflicting
several severe wounds upon her neck
and breast. Miss Whipple did not
fancy being whipped .with that sort
of stick, nor did she like the kind of
music that sort of Organ gave her, so
she forthwith went to the fat justice
and tiled a criminal charge against
Jim Organ aforesaid. Justice Tege
fcpf will tune him up lively this morn
ing.
The old and well known stationery
house of B. J. Kopperl, on Congress
avenue, failed last evening. An as
signment wa3 made to A. P. AVool
d ridge for the benefit of the creditors
cT the house about six o'clock last
night. Mr. Wooldridge, the assignee,
was seen by a Statesman represen
tative and he stated the assets to be
about 827,000 and the liabilities to be
23,500. Mr. Kopperl has turned over
ail of his property, and the assignment
ij said to be thoroughly an honest
one. For some time it has been
rumored the condition of the house
vas getting shaky, and not a few
have been looking for the crash; still
the failure will take the city generally
by surprise. The assignee stated that
ail of his creditors dealt very kindly
towards the unfortunate merchant
and he is of the opinion that by a
judicions handling of the assets he
would be able to settle with the credi
tors so as to save something. It de
pends, of course, upon ihe liberality of
the creditors.
CHUliCII NOTES.
The Presbyterian church, of which
Rev. R. K. Smoot is pastor, is one of
the most progressive in the city. The
building itself is of good size, wen
located and comf rtably arranged.
There have been spent upon it, in
construction and improvements, over
81(5,000. The register shows about
240 members, who more or less con
tribute to the support of the church,
paving last year S666i.il as the cur
rent expenses, including pastor's sal
ary and required payment on the
church debt. Tne debt has been so
reduced as to make its liquidation a
much easier matter in the future. All
this speaks well for a membership
composed largely of persons of moder
ate means.
The church was established here in
1850 by Rev. William M. Baker. The
war produced some differences in the
following of the pastor, who at first
sided with the South, but owing to
the action or the Northern presbytery
many adopted the Northern idea and
were alienated trom the hock, out Mr,
Baker himself changing with them
they returned to his congregation.
Then those following the bouthern
branch of the church took offense at
the prayer which was adopted
praying for the president of
tha united states. The result
was that only about a dozen of the old
members remained on the roil or tne
Southern adherents when the war
closed. From this nucleus has grown
tho present congregation of the
Southern, as distinguished from the
Northern Presbvteeian Church, of
which Dr. Smoot and Dr. Wright are
the respective pastors.
The officers of Dr. Smoot's church
are A. H. Cook, R. E. Grant and J. II.
Hutehins, elders; B. S. Pillow. Dr.
Burt, Judge Fullmore, M. Mclnnis,
J. M. Brown,L. Shackelford and Clark
Red. deacons: superintendent ot Sun
day school, John M. Brown. When
Dr. Smoot bec ame the pastor in ii
there were 72 members and a debt
of about $10,000 which is now reduced
to about 1200, while the membership
has increased as stated to 210. The
Sunday school has an average attend
ance tt about 100 out or leu on tne
roil, who are faithfully instructed by
a dozen teachers. The church choir
is a good one, composed of the follow
ing ladies and gentlemen: C. M. Sta
ples, leader; Miss Lillie Staples, or
ganist, and the Messrs. Kreisle, and
Misses Kosa staples and sister, miss
Shipman, Miss Lillie Erwin and Miss
Sophia Kreisle, singers.
At one end of the church is to be
seen a portrait of Dr. T. D. Manning,
a former superintendent of the Sun
day school, who fell a martyr to the
yellow fever at nolly Springs, Miss.,
where he went to assist and died in
humanity's work.

Among those who attend the church
are Gov. Ireland, Judge Walker, Pro
fessors . Dabny and Hamphries. and
other prominent persons. Prof. Gould
is a member of the church.
Dr. Smoot, after reading snd com
menting in his usual off hand and orig
inal manner upon the eighth chapter
of Romans, adopted the thirty-fourth
verse as the text of his discourse Sun
day. His sermon, preached entirely
without notes or manuscript, was a
learned and eloquent presentation of
the tenets of the church and especial
ly the doctrines which are largely
based on this chapter. As a pulpit
orator Dr. Smoot is regarded by many
as equal, if not superior to any in this
city, aud perhaps in the state. Those
who hear him never fail to be edified
and delighted with his ministrations.
Alluding to tho querry of the text,
"Who i3 he that condemneth?" he
likened the censorious to the culprit
who, despite his consciousness of
guilt, boldly declares to the jury "I
am not guilty," and seeks by the very
finesse of his audacity to impress
them with the idea that he is inno
cent. The man who slanders the
church and traduces God s people was
no worse han the one who circulates
slander. The Scriptures are terrible
in their denunciation of slander and
falsehood. When a man feels that
he has been acquitted of guilt in the
eyes of God, his spirit may well be
stirred up at the condemnation of men,
for he feels that he has been pur
chased at a great price by the death of
Christ.
God's intentions were misunder
stood and men misinterpreted his
scriptures, who sneered at his scheme
of redemption. This part of his ser
mon was elaborated by Dr. Smoot in
the strongest terms. When he spoke
to his people and told them of his plan
of salvation he wantrd it to stand be
yond the possibility of failure. This
was good sense and good Presbyte
rianism. "If," said he, "I believed
that there was any probability of the
children of God being lost UDder the
scheme of God's sedemption, I should
prefer some surer plan for our salva
tion. If Christ lives, as tho Bible
saith he ever does, to make interces
sion for us, then we live in Christ. If
Christ lives, his people will live, and
this was the latitude and longitude of
religion that Christ will save every
sinner who comes to God by him, be
cause he ever liveth to make interces
sion for us. It is My will, He saith,
that my people be with me. Their
will is one. God and Christ cannot be
divided."
This was the basis of the argument
which Dr. Smoot elaborated from his
teXt. r
All of Oue Mind.
Dr. It. "Wilson Carr, of Baltimore,
says "he has used llosadalis in cases
of scrofula and other diseases.
Dr. T. C. Fugh, of Baltimore, re
commends Rosadalis to all persons
suffering with diseased blood, saying
it is superior to any other preparation.
Rev. Dabney Bail, of the Baltimore
M. E. Conference, says he has been so
much benefited by the use of Rosa
dalis that he cheerfully recommends
it to all his friends and acquaintances.

Cures diseases of The Liver in all its
Varions frrma.
Sucli as Dyspepsia, Headache, Jfeural

any Irregularity of the Bowels.
This is a combination of Saline and
vegetable materials, and contains no ;
mercury or any drastic vegetable ca
thartic, such as mandrake and aloes,
and is far superior in its action, as it
never debilitates or produces any un
pleasant e jects, it will remove all dis
eases incidental to a disordered state
of the liver and is therefore recom
mended in all liver complaints. It
will act thoroughly on the liver in
from two to four hours time and does
not produce nausea cr griping pains

Drs. J. J. r W. II robin:
Dear Sirs Your Hepatozone has
had a rather extended trial in this in
stitution, among officers and pupils;
it hes proven a safe and certain reme
dy in affections of the liver. It is
also a valuable and cheap aperient.
It removes constipation of the bowels,
relieves indigestion, and can be taken
at any time without any bad effect.
I cheerfully recommend its use in all
cases involving derangement of the
functions of the liver, and in many
cases where the stomach and bowels
are involved. Truly yours.
Joiin Foed, Supt.
From a piuminent physician .of
Travis county
Dr. W. II. Tobln, Austin, Texas:
After having made numerous trials
of Hepatozone I am induced to recom
mend it. It is without doubt a most
valuable remedy. I have been satis
fied with the results obtained where
I have used it. I find that it acts
very promptly in arousing the secre
tions and relieving engorgment of
the most important organs of the
, body. When its medical virtues are
more generally known 1 believe it
will be' kept in most families.

Drs. Tobin :
Your Hepatozone" a3 a gentle
purgative has no equal. It moves
the. bowels without making the pa
tient feel sick, weak or languid. It
is often the case that we feel a little
bilious, have some headache perhaps,
and are feeling unwell generally, and
only need an easy purgative to relieve
us; your "Hepatozone" is the medi
cine for that condition. I relieved a
case of dysentery with it in a very
short time. We use it largely in this
institution. Frank Rainey,

Dr. Tobiu:
Dear Sir You will remember that
some time ago I remarked to you that
I suffered from an uneasy, painful
feeling In my right side, caused by a
congested condition of the liver,
which prevented ma from riding on
horseback and engaging in violent
exercise of any kini. You then told
me that you had suffered from a smi-
lar affection of the liver, and had
cured yourself by using certain medi
cinal herbs which you had discovered
and urged me to try them. I did so
and am now well. These medicinal
1 herbs in conjunction with salines you
have since presented to the public
under the name of "Tobin's Hepato
zone. In domar so vou have con
ferred a great boon on people living
m a not. semi-tropical enmate liKe
ours, where diseases ot the liver are
so prevalent. It is the daily expe
rience of every physician to find peo
ple ruining their constitutions by the
excessive use or strong mercu
rial purgatives. A still larger
number constantly use so-called "liver
regulators," mostly composed of
aloes and other drastic purgatives,
which only tend to produce piles and
other troublesome affections of the
lower bowels. To all such sufferers
your medicine will be an invaluable
aid in restoring them to health again
and 1 feel assured lhat it only re
quires to be known to be appreciated,
and that people will ceas e destroying
their constitutions by the reckless and
dangerous abuse of mercurials now
in voirue. Hepatazoae . contains no
hurtful drug. and vet it is signally ef
ficient as a liver medicine. I may re
mark just here that I am not violat
ing medical ethics in truthfully giving
vou my opinion ot a meaicine wnicn
I have used myself with benefit, the
formula of which you did not hesi
tate to show to me. Above all, it af
fords me great pleasure to know that

If Democracy wins at all it must
win on principles. The mere bandinage
of words is a game which the Repub

of at 'once espousing its opposite
would be an exhibition of shameful
trickery and deceit which the people
would not be slow in rebuking. Here
is something for those Democrats to
