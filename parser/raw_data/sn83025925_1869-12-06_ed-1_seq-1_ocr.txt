(spirits.
In considering the large Increase of revenue from
distilled spirits for the last six months of the fiscal
year ending June 1)0, 1869, the subjoined facts should
be remembered. There were In bonded ware
houses on 1st July, isos, as shown by the accounts
kept in this oillce, 27,278,420 gallons of spirits.
This included all claims for leakage then outstand
ing, and a large quantity claimed to have been de
stroyed by the burning of several bonded ware
houses, as well oh certain amounts which had pre
viously been withdrawn upon fraudulent bonds and
were still unaccounted for.
Under the provisions of the act of July 20, 18CS, as
amended, all spirits in bonded warehouse at the time
of the passage of the act were required to be
withdrawn ami the tax paid thereon prior to July 1,
1869; and by this requirement 24,383,951 gallons of
spirits were necessarily forced upon the market
during this fiscal year, and served, to that extent, to
Increase the revenue irom this source; while on the
1st of July, 1809, there remained in bonded ware
house of the new product only 16,643,833 gallons.
It thus appears that the quantity of spirits in bond,
to bo withdrawn and tax paid during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1870,1s less by nearly eight million
gallons than the quantity which was compelled to
be withdrawn and tax paid for the llscal year ending
June 30, 1K09.
The following table shows the receipts for dis
tilled spirits and fruit brandy for the four years end
ing June 30, iw9:

Referring to the comparative statements of re
ceipts for di Heron t periods so far as the samo relate
to tobacco, I havo to say that, during tho first six
months of the fiscal year 1809, the gain In cigars
over the corresponding period for tho year 1808 was
lifty-slx per cent.
The loss on chewing and smoking tobacco for the
same period was Ufteen per cent. ; the increased
revenue from these articles under tho la of July
20, 1868, not being realized until after January 1,
1869, while on cigars tlie appreciation commenced
Immediately after the passage of the law.
The number of cigars returned for taxation during
the last seven years is as follows:
1863, at an average tax of 12-31 per 1000. 199,283.21
1864, at an average tax of ti 37 per looo. 492,780,700

189, at a uniform tax of (5 per looo rvjo,3:tr,,o.vj
1809, at a uuiform tax of f.l per looo 991,030,931
It will be seen that during I860, when thn tax was
t a uniform rate of ten dollars per thousand, only
847,443,894 cigars weru returned for taxation, while
under the present law there were returned for the
year I860 nearly three times the quantity, with the
tax at the uniform rate of five dollars per thousand.
The amount of tax collected on cigars was for the
fiscal year 1809 $1,9.17,079

This dhows an Increase in revenue, from stamps,
l niiii g this six months, of nearly one million dollars.
This increase, though considerable, is by no means
reckoned satisfactory. It has resulted mainly from
the policy of this oillce, in April last, requiring all
stamps to lie so placed ou thu Instrument of writing
as to exhibit the entire face of the slump, and pro
hibiting tho practice which had obtained oxleu
slvely of covering the supposed half of one stamp by
the attachment of another, when in fact the stamp
was cut In two, and one-half used to represent a full
stamp In another Instance.
Tho gross receipts from stamps for the last fiscal
year were 16,4?t710. For the current year they are
estimated at $17,Nio,000, but It la believed that this
tax ought lo yield at least I .lu, 1100,000.
Incomes from Individual.
The total amount collected on the annual
list of incomes for 107 was 127,417,907
For 1808 23,390,373
For 1869 up to November 2.1,293,630
This last sum will bo increased to an amount over
twenty-six millions.
As this tax expires with the assessment for 1870,
it will be for Congress tu dotcriulno whether we can
part entirely with the receipts from this source of
revenue; and, If not, whether any substitute van be
devised more Just and equitable, and less burden
some to taxpayers.
If the Income from this source cannot ba spared
from the general receipts, and other objects cannot
be lound more acceptable as a substitute, it Is for
Congress to determine whether or not the tax shall
be renewed.
In considering this nuectlon, after determining the
total amount which ouuht to be realized from Inter
nal revenue sources, and considering carefully what
will lie realized by the present system, without re
sorting to lucernes, the question will present Itself,
whether the entire income tax, as now assessed,
shall be revived, or whether it shall be renewed at a
less rate of taxation. My opinion is that, so long as
a large Internal revenue is required by the financial
necessities of the Government, a portion of that
revenue should be collected from Incomes. Tho
reasons for this seem apparent and forcible. This
tax reaches simply the prollts of trade and business,
and the Increased wealth of individuals from invest
ments. If the tax were paid as these prollts and
accumulations accrue, it Is believed that It would be
thonght objectionable, tint, lining required to lie paid
all at one time, and often Bfter the Income has been
reduced by the expenses of tho taxpayer, or lein
vested In business, it seems more onerous, and is
more seriously complained against.
The objection most frequently and earnestly made
against this tax Is that It leads to a system of espi
onage Into private affairs that Is not only offensive
but sometimes Injurious to Individuals.
I do not see why this objection mny not, with
equal force, be urged against all taxes upon personal
property. Such taxes cannot be collected without
ascertaining tho amount of taxable property pos
sessed by the tax-payer. The law imposing a tax
upon incomes does nothing more than this, If so
much. It simply requires a truthful and honest
statement of the actual Income of the tax-payer
during the preceding year, which can be compfled
with us easily, and wiih as little exposure of private
affairs, as any other law national, state, or muni
cipal which seeks to raise revenue from the per
sonal estate of tax-payers.
After all. It Is but a tax upon the increased wealth
of the nation; and when It Is understood that Gov
ernment securities are exempted from taxation,
and that the interest on these securities produces a
large amount of the Income of taxpayers, I sulVaiit
if it will be wise to abolish the Income tax so long
as the labor, Industry, and business of thn
country are directly or indirectly subjocted to any
considerable taxation.
Expenses of foiled Ing the Revenue.
There were paid for expenses incident to
the collection of the revenue for 1803 js, 770,814
For 1N69 17,394,395
Deduct the amount paid to store
keepers, act of July 20, 18CS 603,018
Leaving for this year on the basis of the ac
count for 1808 6,785,477
Decrease In favor of 1869 $1,991,337
By an amendment to the act of July 20, 1803, passed
March 4, 1869, the compensation of storekeepers Is
to be repaid to the Government by the manufactu
rers of distilled splrltB aod owners of warehouses.
These repayments are found to be (lilllcult to collect,
and I am of opinion that this mode of paying store
keepers should be abolished at once. Only 1175,785
of the amount expended by the Government for this
purpose had been repaid on the 80th of June, 1809.
The accounts of this bureau do not show precisely
the expenses of collecting the revenue for each year,
because the amounts charged during each year em
brace expenses actually Incurred in the preceding
year.
The expenses or the bureau for the year 1868
were 1567,214
Deduct the cost of printing stamps, and for
tent 150,000
Actual expenses of the bureau for 1868. . 417,214

Deduct for printing stamps, etc 250,000
Actual expenses 400,395
Decrease In favor of 1809. 16.819
Prior to the act of July 20, 1868. no stamps for dis
tilled spirits and tobacco were required. This ex-
5ense bus now become an Important item,
'ho commissions allowed ou the sale of
stamps for 1869 were f 915,217
For 1868 83.1,633
Increase for 1809 109,579
These commissions were at the same rate during
each year, and the increase is due to the larger sale
of stamps during the year 109.
THE INTERIOR.
Annual Report of Secretary Cox-
Operations of His Department
During the Year The In
dian Question and its
Present Aspect.
From the lengthy report of General Jacob D. Cox,
Sccretaiy of the Department of the Interior, which
was transmitted to Congress at noon to-day, we take
the following extracts, embracing the most material
portions of the document:
During the last fiscal year public lands were dis
posed of, by cash sales, ami by grants for home
steads, railroads, etc, to the amount, of 7,6iiO,Ml-97
acres, a quantity greater by 1,010,409-47 acres than
was disposed of the previous year.
An appropriation of $,'s4,420 for tho Patent Oillce
the coming year is asked for.
It is estimated that, exclusive of the amount
chargeable to the navy-pension fund, 30,ooo,ooo
will be required for the pension service during the
next llscal year.
In the matter of the new policy towards the In
diau tribes, the Secretary suggests the following
I unoerstaud this policy to look to two objects:
First, the locatlou of the Indians upon fixed reser
vations, so that tlie pioneers and settlers may bo
freed from tho terrors of wandering hostile tribes;
and, second, an earnest effort at their civil i.miou, so
that they may themselves be elevated lu the sealo of
humanity, and our obligation tu them as fellow-men
be discharged.
In carrying out this policy a great practical diffi
culty has arisen from the fact that in most instances
a separate reservation was given to each tribe.
These reservations have been surrounded and gra
dually Invaded by tho white settlers, and the Indians
crowded out of their homes, acd forced to negotiate
for a new settlement, because their presence, tlielr
habits, ami their manners were distasteful to their
new and more powerful neighbors. 1
It is believed that the only remedy for this condi
tion of things is to encourage the Indiana to as
semble upon larger reservations, where their num
bers will be aggregated, and where the more civi
lized of them vtill iniluence the others in striving to
progress In the arts of peace. Congress has already
passed an act to enuble the civilized Indians of the
Indian Territory, properly so called, to form a gene
ral organization, with most of the elements of a ter
ritorial government; but the requisite appropria
tions have not been made to carry the plan Into
effect. 1 would earnestly recommend that no
further delay be made in this matter. Tho associ
ated tribes, of which the Chorokees have taken the
lead, aie those best fitted for a fuller experiment In
self-government. They are already familiar with
mostjof the forms of executive, legislative, and ju
dicial action in use among us, and 1 believe them
well prepared to dispense with the tutelage of our
agents, if they may havo a dologiite of ftielr ovy,i
upon the iloor of thu House of Hcpre.senlatlves to
speak for them,
JJoto they and we ore suffering for tho lack of such
direct representation. The white constituencies
which are nearest to thorn are tho ones of all the
nation whose interests are most lu opposition, and
whose personal tendencies are most host ile to lnoirs.
The representatives of such constituencies would be
more tliau human If they were not tntlueuccd by this
fact, ltcprcsentatlon chosen by tho tribes tlieiu-s-dves,
aud responsible to themselves, is the only
mode of making tho country acquainted with their
condition aud with our obligations to them, lu such
a territory the tribal organization would easily
merge into thu county, and the territorial legislature
would not bo very different from the grand councils
at present in vogue among them.
The Indians north of the Platte river are not yet
prepared lor a similar concentration; but the time
cannot be far distant when two or three principal
ludiun territories may properly embrace all the
tribes cast of the Kooky Mountains. Without such
a system they will Inevitably go through the old
processor being first surrounded aud then over
whelmed and destroyed by the white immigration.
As they advance in intelligence they will need no
urging to adopt this plan, for they will see as plainly
as we that the existence of their race depends
upon it.
The same policy of concentrating tho tribes will
apply to tho country wcBtof the Kocky Mountains,
and will be equally necessary whenever aud wher
ever the feuds existing among them can be so far
settled that they can live together in peaceful neigh
borhood. I'pou such permanent reservations farms
should be allotted in severalty as soon as any dispo
sition to agriculture Is awakeued, aud every induce
ment offered to stimulate the desire for property of
a fixed character.
The late peace commission negotiated trtSa'los
with all the principal tribes east of the lto ky
Mountains, and were guided in their action by the
general views stated above, which, Indeed, may
be said to have been accepted by all disinterested
persons who have had any opportunity of examining
the subject. The treaties were duly ratified, and so
became the solemn contract between tho United
States and those tribes. It is rteeplv to be regretted
that specific appropriations were not made to carry
out strictly the terms of the treaties ; for.allhough tho
general appropriation of two millions has tieen used
as far as possible in thn fulfilment of the obligations
incurred, the .Commissioner of Indian A (lairs
has been met at every step by distrust of the
good faith of the Government, aud all pro
mises regarding the future have m?en doubtingly
received and ai swered by the Inquiry, whnt agree
ment could be more blurting than that mado under
the authority of Congress by so distinguished
Eersonages as the ambassadors of the United Stata7
verythlng attending tho Peace Commission was of
a nature to excite the Imaginations of the Indians,
and to Impress them wltn the belief that now, more
than ever belore, we were thoroughly In earnest lu
our negotiations. The disappointment is propor
tlonally great, and the comparative quiet whicn has
l een maintained throughout the year could only
have lioen secured by greatly increased care and un
tiring effort on the part of the officers of the Indian
Durcau and of the army officers, who have co ope
rated with the greatest zeal la acrrylng out a peace
ful policy.
The report shows that the sum of 12,075,892-89 was
requisite to defray the expenses of tho Courts of the
I'inted States for the llscal year ending June 30, I38.I.
In addition to the estimated receipts from lines,
penalties, and forfeitures, tl,2on,noo will he required
for tills service during the next liscal year. This
snm Is less by 1300,000 than that appropriated for tho
present year.
in relation to appointments In the civil service the
Secretary remarks: The first measure of reform Is
to raise the standard ol quiillilcatlon, make merit as
tested by the duty performed the solo ground of
promotion, and secure to the faithful incumbent the
same permanence of employment that Is given to
officers of the army and navy. Under the present
system, the general conviction among the clerks and
employes is that the retention of their places depends
much more upon the political iniluence they may
command that npon energy or seal In the per
formance of duty. After a careful examination of
the subject, I am fully persuaded that the measure
I have suggested would have enabled this depart
ment to do the work of thepaxt llscal year with a
corps of clerks one-third less in number than were
found necessary.

From the annual report transmitted to Congress at
noon to-day by tho lion. J. A. J. Creswell, Postmaster-General,
wo take the following extracts, which
embrace all the points or general Interest :
The ordinary revenues of the Postal Department
for the fiscal year ended June 80, 1809, were
$18,344,510-72, and the expenditures t23,098,i31'60.
The estimated expenditures for the year
ending June 80, 1371, are 12.1,581,093

Standing appropriations for free
matter 700,000

Leaving a deficiency of 4,702,132
The lore going estimates do not Include tho special
appropriations in the nature of subsidies for mail
Bteamship service between ton Francisco, Japan,
and China; for like service between the 'United
Slates aud Brazil; and for like service between Ban
Francisco and Sandwich Islamls.
The total number of postage stamps, stamped en
velopes, and newspaper wrappers was 502,722,bG0, of
the aggregate value or l.o7S,001-fo. Tho amount
expended for new mail bags of all kinds was vj,42i,
or 131,4 13-13 more than the amount expended the
preceding year. Tho cost of mail-bag catchers, re
cently introduced into the service for delivering and
receiving malls from and on railway trains at full
speed, was tiooo. Tills anion ut does not appear lu
the table last mentioned, but is included in thu item
or mall bags.
"Since the completion or the railroad line to the
Pacific, arrangements have been made to have re
cords kept showing the time occupied iu the transit
or malls rrom Washington, New York, Boston,
Chicago, Cincinnati, and St. Louis to Denver City,
Salt Lake City. Sacramento city, and San Francisco
and back. The records or arrivals on the Atlantic
side during tho month or October havo reached the
department. They show that malls are carried
through rrom San Francisco to Washington in 6
days, 23 hours, and 15 minutes; to New York in 6
days, 15 hours, and 20 minutes; to liostou In 7 davs,
4 hours; to Chicago in & days, 7 houri, anil 30
minutes; to Cincinnati In 5 days, 22 hours, aud 30
minutes; and to St. Louis In 5 days, 1 hour, and 30
minutes. The above figures show the time of the
shortest trips.
The total number of letters passing between the
United States and foreign countries (Canada ex
cepted) during the lost year was 12 590,054, of which
6,638 858 were sent from, and 6,957,796 received In,
the United States. The increase over the number
exchanged in 1868 is 1,403,122. Estimating the num
ber exchanged with the Dominion of Canada, or
which no accurate account is reported, at 3,000,000,
the whole number or letters exchanged lu tne mails
Willi foreign countries exceeded 15,5o0,000. Tile total
postages on letters exchanged with foreign coun
tries, estimating tho postage on letters to aud Iroin
Canada at $350,000, amounted to $2,014,1S3,15.
The free-delivery system has been In operation
during the year in forty-eight of the principal cities,
with the following aggregate results:
Number of letter-carriers 1,248
Wail letters delivered 80,071,nw
Local letters delivered 18,3-.0,027
Newspapers delivered 21,9.14,898

Total domestic letters ". 8,7.ij,670
Foreign letters 103, lbO
Whole number 8,952,802
The largely increased use of stamped envelopes
bearing "return requests," that Is, requests that they
be returned to the writers al ter a stated number of
days, has operated to decrease lu a considerable
degree the number of dead letters. While the num
ber and value or money letters received are about
the samo as those or tho preceding year, the per
centage or decrease In letters containing other
valuables ranges as follows;
IVr cent.
Letters containing bills of exchsngo, drafts,
hecks, deeds, and other valuable pupeis... 19-85
Letters containing Jewelry and other property 63-94
Letters containing articles of small value,
postage stamps, photographs, etc nr,
Ordinary letters without lnclosures 11-92
Ordinary letters and circulars destroyed 74-14
The whole number of money order Post Offices lu
operation during the last llscal year was 1408. Two
or these were discontinued, aud 219 new meney
order offices were established July 12, 1809, making
the present whole number 10-6:
The number or orders Issued during the
year was 1,264,143, or the aggregate valuo
or $24,848,060
The number paid was 1,218,874,
amounting In value to $24,447,377

The Postmaster-General mentions the fact that no

service, and makes the folia in? tetnarks:
Propositions have been made to this department

department should bind Itself for a long term or
years, mbject to the approval f Ciiigre; and some
nave offered In thM 1 ounociion to fix the rate or sea
postage at two cents per half ounce Hut, at the
general law relating to contracts for carrying the
malls on the seas expressly limits the authority of
the department to a term not exceeding two year, I
have declined all propt s.iU to contract for a longer
time, not desiring In any manner to forestall tho
action or Congress upon a subject or so much im
portance. If It be possible, I should greatly prerer such legis
lation by Congress us would so far revive and en
courage our own ship-building Interests as to en
able American builders and mechanics to enter into
active compeilt'.on in the construction and equip,
ment of steam vessels with the builders and me
chanics of other countries. If, however, it should
be decided that this cannot be done, then I would
respectfully suggest tho propriety of so modifying
our navigation laws as to authorize the Issuing of
American registers to such foreign-built steamers as
may be purchased aud employed by citizens of the
I 'nited States under contracts with this department
in the transportation of our foreign malls.
Should either of these recommendations bo
adopted, and authority given to the I'osimastr
(eneral to contract ror the conveyance or 11111II3 by
cea for a term of ten or fifteen years, at a compensa
tion not to exceed the ocean postages, It la believed
that lines of first-class American steamers w nld be
speedily established for the conveyan -e of our mu'U
and freights across the Atlantic, and that there. v
great bcncilts would Inure to the commercial anil
other Interests of tho United States.

Notwithstanding tho Inclement weather a goodly

of tho spectators were ladies. Senators com
menced coming lu on tho floor about 11 o'clock, and
hearty congratulations were exchanged between
those who had been parted for so many months.
Hie vacant chair of Mr. Fcssendcn was often
glanced at, and a sad expression swept across the

who was gone rrom among them roicvcr. One thing
was particularly nottceable.and In marked contrast to
the opening or the sessions ror last four veara Then
Senators met each other with Btern aiid contracted

Senate.
W'AsrtiNOTON, Dec. ft. The Senate met at noon,
with tifty-tlve members present.
The resignation of Senator Crimes was received.
Mr. Ixit M. Morrill was sworn In as Senator from
Maine.
The credentials of the Virginia Senators were pre
sented and laid on the table.
A committee was appointed to inform the House
and the President or the Senate's readiness to
proceed tv business.
A large number or bills were introduced and
ordered to bo printed, among them bills by Messrs.
Drake and Sumner, restricting appellate powers or
United States Courts in tho late rebellious States,
and by Mr. Morton to provide ror the reconstruction
or (ieorgla. on motion Mr. Kditrand's bill on the
same subject, reported last session, was mado the
special order ror next Wednesday. The Senate at
12-50 took a recess ror half an hour.
House.
The IIousc was called to order by the Speaker at
noon, when the proceedings were opened with
prayer by tho chaplain, Rev. Mr. Butter.
The roll or mcmiiers was then called by States by
the clerk, and a large majority answered to their
names. The roll having been completed the Speaker
announced that there were 180 members present.
Mr. Brooks (N. Y.) presented as a question or
privilege the credentials or S. S. Cox, member-elect
rrom New York.
The Speaker stated that there were several gentle
men present, Including Messrs. Cox, or New York,
Harnum, or Connecticut, li rooks, of Massachusetts,
and the members-elect from Alabama, who had not
been sworn in; and he invited all or them whose
rights to Beats were unchallenged to present them
selves and take the oath at the same time.
Mr. Paine suggested that perhaps tho better mode
would bo to make a rormal reference or the creden
tials or all those members to the Committee on Elec
tions. Tho Speaker remarked that his suggestion had
been that only those members whoso credentials
were absolutely unchallenged should present them
selves, and that he would not administer the oath to
any member against whom ail objection should bo
made. The usage had always been to allow mem
bers to be sworn in against whom thero was no ob
jection, without rurther ceremony.
Mr. Brooks remarked that iu point or fact the cre
dentials of Mr. Cox had been presented early in
March last, unchallenged, aud Mr. Cox had been ac
tually appointed by the Speaker as a member or the
Committee on Hanking and Currency.
Mr. Paine said he did not object to any individual
member. He had only suggested a general rule
which ho thought ought to be adhered to.
The several members elect then presented them
selves at the bar to take the oath or oillce.
Mr. Kelley objected to the swearing in or Mr.Sher
rod or Alabama, and Mr.Whittemore objected to the
swearing in or Mr. Dox or Alabama, and those
gentlemen were directed to stand aside.
The oath was then administered to Mesirs. Bar
num, or Conn. ; Brooks, or Mass. ; Cox, or N. Y. ;
Burchard, or III., and Buck and Barclay or Ala.
On motion or Mr. Schenck, the Clerk was directed
to inform the Senate that a quorum or tho House had
assembled, and that the House was ready to proceed
to business.
On motion or Mr. Schenck, a committee or three
was ordered to join a similar committee or the
Senate to wait npon the President or the United
States and Inform him that Congress had assembled
and was ready to receive any communication ho
might he pleased to make.
The Speaker appointed as such committee Messrs.
Schenck, Dawes, and Woodward.
Mr. Schenck then moved that the House take a
recess until half-past one o'clock.
Hesuld It had formerly been the usage for Congress
to wait until it heard rrom the President before pro
ceeding to any legislative business, and he thought
it well to return to that old custom, and to observe
that same deoorom and courtesy which had formerly
prevailed. There had been reason;durluga few years
past more satisfactory to gentlemen for changing
that pructl e, and It had fallen Into disuse, but he
trusted that they would go back to the old land
mark. During the delivery or these remarks there were
symptoms on the Democratic sido or a readiness to
get up a discussion. Just then a message was re
ceived rrom the Senate that it had appointed a com
mittee to wulton thy President.
Mr. Schenck, ichiunlning the floor after tho mes
sage from the Senate was delivered, said that, for
fear the House might get Into a discussion as to the
reasons ror departing rrom that custom or bite years,
he would move the previous question. (Laughter.)
The previous question was seconded, and the mo
tion was agreed to..
The House thereupon, at 12V o'clock, took a re-cc-fiH
till hair-past 1.
