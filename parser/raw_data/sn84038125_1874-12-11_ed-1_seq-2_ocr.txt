FRIDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1874.
-The Bozeman Avant Courier is out
again full size, after several weeks suspen
sion and contraction, and looks better
than ever.
-Miraclesl have not ceased: The tele
graph did bring the President's Message
on Monday and it was issued in Helena at
10:30 Monday evening.
-In view of the increasing interest in
Spiritualism in Montana we hope to see
ample appropriation for the care and cus
tody of insane persons made at the next
session of the Legislature.
-The cases of John. D. Lee and Bishop
Dame, indicted for participation in the
Mountain Meadow Massacre, and held for
trial at Beaver City, Utah, have gone over
until the February term of Court.
-The Senate Republican Caucus on
Tuesday developed the fact that there is a
wide difference of opinion on the Louisiana
and Arkansas questions and there is an
indisposition to meddle with the latter
when they did not with the former.
-A feature of the quartz representation
law which may not have presented itself to
parties owning quartz on which application
for patent has been made, is explained in
an article on the first page entitled " Look
Out for Your Claims." Interested persons
should read it.
-On the 3d t, November it was the
"tidal wave " that shook up " Old Essex"
Massachusetts. On the 25th it was an
earthquake that pitched around real estate
and chattels in Essex and Beverly. The
next thing in order is " the still small voice"
of Butler crying for vengeance.
-Mrs. Minnie Myrtle (Joaquin) Miller
is writing a drama, in which she will be
one of the characters, taking the part
herself, Joaquin another, and others will
be distinguished Oregonians. She thinks
that appearing in propria persone in her
own character will be a novelty on the
stage-and it will be.
-President Grant in a conversation in
which the causes of the recent political
reverses were alluded to said: "I do not
"think it worth while to insist upon a
"verdict as to the responsibility for the
"recent reverse. Would it not be better
"policy to harmonize differences and to
"agree upon the best method of regaining
"lost ground."
-The Helena papers say the initial steps
were taken in the Capital suit, on Thursday
of last week, by serving on the Governor
at Gaffney a notice to answer on the first
day of the next session of the Supreme
Court, to be holden in Virginia City in
January. But the Governor went on to the
States. We are not sufficiently versed in
the law to know whether or not his absence
will effect the case.
-The colored men of Washington City
are said to be determined in their efforts to
secure the passage of the Civil Rights Bill
with the school clause in it, and to that end
have called a convention to be held this
week. They proscribed, printed in a black
list and worked against Republican candi
dates who opposed the bill. If they want
to defeat the Republican party in 1876 they
are pursuing the proper course.
-The type, presses, subscription lists,
good will, building and lot of the Sacra
mento Union, once the most powerful and
largest circulated newspaper on the Pacific
Coast, is offered for sale, with the unusual
announcement that if not sold at private
sale before that day, the whole property
will be offered at public auction, in front
of the office, Dec. 28th, 1874. The only
cause assigned is the poor health and desire
to retire from active business of H. W.
Larkyn.
well understood that Hon. Fernando Wood
is laying his wires for the difficult and
dangerous honor: of the Speakership, and
it is considered that he will be a formidable,
and, very likely, a successful candidate.
He is experienced, very rich (an admirable
qualification) and has a handsome wife;
lastly, he is one of the few men who have
survived the Mayoralty. An Ex-Mayor,
like an Ex-President, is usually employed
for nothing but funeral processions."
-Governor Potts left for Washington
last week. He says he is going on private
business and to do what he can to secure
favorable legislation for the Northern
Pacific Railroad and intimates he is not
going to make war on Judge Knowles.
Well; all right, Governor. The people
blocked that little game of yours, if there
is any merit in universal wish, and if you
really had influence to accomplish it; but if
you want to look after your own affairs
and do some good for the Territory without
doing evil, and are sorry you put your foot
in it, why may you have a good journey
and good luck.
-It is the design of the publisher of the
NEW NORTH-WEST. after January 1st,
1875, to print the addresses of subscribers,
with the date to which their subscription is
paid, on each paper going out to the differ
ent offices in Montana. The advantages of
this are: a legible address, avoidance of
"skipping" names, a saving of much
writing, keeping subscribers advised each
issue of the status of their subscription
accounts and their speedy rectification in
case of error and advice. That the ad
dresses so printed may be gratifying, and
that there may not be so frequent revision
of the type addresses after the adoption of
this method we would respectfully urge
those in arrears to remit before the end of
the year.

THE PESIDEINT' Z EBAS3.
In a supplementary sheet, enclosed to
Territorial subscribers in this issue, we
present the Message of President Grant to
Congress on last Monday. It is longer and
more argumentative on the Financial and
Southern States government questions than
his preceding messages. On the financial
question the President takes strong grounds
in favor of a certain and speedy return to
specie basis, the endorsement of his position
last session by the money influences of the
country having evidently determined him
to prominently identify his administration
with the specie payment theory and "fight
it out on that line." In the argument
offered to support the recommendation for
early legislation fixing a method whereby
a return to a specie basis shall be accom
plished there are many practical facts sub
mitted, and, as a whole, the matter is pre
sented in a strong, compact and forcible
manner. Its weak point is in failing to
suggest a practicable "method." It would
have been desirable to have maintained
the currency at a par with gold during the
war and since. But it yielded to the inex
orable logic of events and depreciated.
Since the war it has risen to almost gold
value, and will, without forcing legislation,
under a wise and economical administration
of governmental affairs steadily approxi
mate to, and reach in reasonable time, that
standard. Realizing that there are many
advantages in a currency of specie value, it
is not clear to us that the nethod of com
pelling it by legislation, unless it shall be a
gradual, unoppressive and auxilliary pro
cess, is as desirable as such an economical
administration of the country as shall give
the currency an enhanced value in the
commercial world. It took England thirty
years to return to specie payment after her
great wars, and in less than ten succeeding
ours we have nearly reached that point.
Acknowledging that the difference now
existing is still a public detriment, it is to
be hoped that the legislative remedy, if
one is determined upon, shall not bring
greater ills than those existing. On the
question of the volume of currency the
President is sagacious and prudent, and
his recommendation for free:banicing,under
such regulations to make the issue secure
as Congress may determine, is likely to be
the plan finally adopted as the compromise
on the currency volume question which has
been and will be violently agitated in Con
gress.
Another considerable portion of the
Message is devoted to an explanation of the
condition of affairs in the South, especially
in Louisiana and Arkansas. In reviewing
these matters the President is temperate,
candid, liberal in his views, and firm in the
intention to perform his duties under the
law as Executive. To all reasonable men
this portion of the Message must commend
itself favorably, and we believe will go far
toward disseminating a fuller knowledge of
the facts and the purposes of the adminis
tration toward the South, and in bringing
about a better understanding and more
cordial feeling between those people and
the general government. The frank expla
nation of affairs in Louisiana. and Arkansas
and the action of the administration relative
thereto, the showing that there are but
4,082 soldiers in all the garrisons south of
the Delaware, the appeal to the people to
dispassionately and patriotically consider
the facts and be just, the avowal of the
President that" the better citizens of the
Southern States are not responsible for the
violences that have occurred, his sympathy
with their prostrate condition and in their
having to submit to some oppressive and
unjust governments, and the earnest desire
that they shall administer their affairs
without interference from the national
Executive is as manly and noble an appeal
to the better natures of the governed as
was ever made by a ruler to a people.
A rather important intimation in the
Message is that in rlation to Cuban affairs.
While expressing profound sympathy with
the government of Spain in its internal
dissensions, there is certainly evidenced by
the Executive a dis ls_
footing in their war for independence. The
President may mean more than that; but
he certainly indicates that he will go to
that extent at least if there is not a decided
success by the Spanish before the adjourn
ment of Congress.
Another notable feature of the Message
is the allusion to Chinese immigration, and
especially in relation to their women. The
tone of the remarks is so at variance with
former expressions on the Chinese question
from Washington as to lead to some hope
ful anticipation that the practical ideas in
relation to this element on the Pacific Coast
are at last supplanting the hallucinations
that have existed in the East about China
men. If the Chinese population of San
Francisco could be put in Washington
during one session of Congress there would
be some restrici ve legislation in regard to
the ravages of Yellow Jack.
The interest manifested in reviving the
American shipping business should be
shared by Congress, and also the disposition
to establish the civil service rules, in which
we trust the President incIihe the rule
published by his authority in 1872, that
residents of 'the Territories would be given
preference for appointment to the Territo
rlal offices. The relations of our govern
ment with foreign powers are amdocble and
ausprilous. These are some of the prinel
pal points ofinteresttn the Message. Itis
fully up to his pre~dinM g state papers as a
whole, in somie features is superlor, and
geerials y will eommand itself favorably to
the nation.

part to a aectle apparent injustice of the

general education among the people of the

of such a course seems to us calculated to
win universal and immediate approval. * *
But our principal purpose in this paper
was to notice for the encouragement of our
people the creditable relative standing of
Montana among the other States and Ter
ritories. In the table that shows the pub
Ii c school expenditures of all the States and
Territories per capita of legal school age,
Montana stands second among the Territo
ries, Colorado alone being ahead, and ninth
among all the States and Territories com
bined. So that we have the great honor,
unaided by any school-fund, as all the
States have, to see ourselves out-ranking
thirty sovereign States in the provisions
that we make for the support of our schools.
This expenditure in Montana is $9.43 per
capita, Colorado being $17.50 in the same
table, and North Carolina standing at the
foot with only $0.55, and Georgia being but
little better. Indeed, all the Southern
States stand disgracefully low; while some
of the Northern States, as Maine, standing
at $4.27 in the scale, are discreditably defi
cient. Massachusetts, as might be expect
ed, stands at the head of the list, expend
ing $21.74 for every person of school age
within its borders.

ments, which were sent out on double
quick, and after a short skirmish four
negroes were killed and three wounded.
The negroes retreated last night. The
negroes drove in the white pickets from
the fort and it is said have entrenched
thei'e. They are receiving large reinforce

them. They fired into a funeral procession
yesterday wounding one white man. The
fire was returned and three negroes were
killed.
