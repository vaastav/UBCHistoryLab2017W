This procedure ie favored by ebany
Congressional leaders as- the most
practical method of securing the

who have evaded the alien enemy act

New York has already published
such a list. but the names were se

its publication the authorities were

yesterday notified the naturalization
office to suspend work on naturalis

taken by Congress on the President's
message.
Drastic amendments to the espion

will be probably passed directly after
the declaration of war is made
against Austria.

Bohemians who called at the otflce
of the United States marshal yester
day claimed that while they are Aus
trian subjects they bore intense ha

such discrimination will not be made
by the government.
There are believed to be 600 Aus

of legislation that brands them as
alien enemies and 1.000.000 such men

Preparations were made at the

guilty of offenses against the United
States will be confined in peniten

MURDER TRIAL
Defense Claims District At

By DAVID 1. CHURCH.

Court House, Concord. N. C., Dec.
5.-"The papers" was the gist of the
afternoon's work in the trial of Gas
ton B. Means, charged with the mur
der of Mrs. Maude A. King.
For long hours there was a legal
skirmish about the papers. The de
fense fought bitterly to show the de
fendant is unable to present a proper
defense for his life because Assistant
District Attorney Dooling, of New
York, has illegally seized "the pa
pers." The defense contends that
among "the papers" seized were the
full accounts of transactions carried
on by the defendant and Mrs. Maude
A. King. The defense contends these
papers were taken by Dooling and
have not been seen since.
Solicitor Clement and Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Dooling declare the
papers were taken legally with the
consent of Afton Means. They de
clare they have never seen these ac
counts.
The storm today beat around Afton
Means, brother of the defendant. He
swore that he left Concord for New
York at the direction of the defend
ant to "get the papers" in the New
York apartment. He declared that
on the night of his arrival "Mr.
Dooling, Detective Wood and a po
liceman" entered the apartment and
seized papers. He declared it was
over his protest that the papers were
removed.
Tells e sheeting.
Afton Means, previous to this, had
told of the fatal shooting of Mrs.
Maude A. King. He told of the ride
to Blackwelder Springs and the shoot
ing while he was "down the road."
On cross examination he became con
fused as to the position he had found
the defendant in when he returned to
the scene of the shooting but he
thought his brother was on the left
side of Mrs. King. He also testified
that he had often seen Mrs. King
shoot the pistol with which she was
tilled.
Cross examination brought out that
Afton Means had not worked for two
rears previous to beginning work for
uis brother, nor since. lie declared
lie work he did for Mrs. King was
'adding up long columns of figures."
For this work he received a salary of
