land's uuuual message, delivered to con
gress Moiuluy, In as follows:
To the Congress of the United Stales:
Ah represent-t lives of ttio people In llio
legislative hiatieliof their government yon
have assembled nt n time when the
strength and excellence of our free Insti
tutions nud the Illness of our el 11 xu lis to
enjoy popular rule linvo lieen again inililc
manifest. A political eoutcst involving
momentous consequences, fraught with fe
verish apprehension und creating iiggirs
?Iveucs* hi Intense ns to ii|i|iroueli bitter
t)e.? anil passion, litis been waged through
out our laud anil ileteruilued by llie deereo
of free anil Independent suffrage without
disturbance of our tranquillity or the least
Sign of weakness In our national struc
ture.
In obedience to a constitutional require
ment, I herein submit to the congress cer
tain Information concerning national af
fairs Willi the suggestion of such Icglsln
lion as in .my Judgment Is necessary ami
expedient. To secure brevity ami avoid
tiresome tlnrrutlou, I shall omit many do
tulls concerning mutters within federul
control which, though by no means unim
portant, ure uiorc profitably discussed In
departmental reports I shall also further
curtail this communication by omitting a
? Minute recital of tunny minor Incidents
connected with our foreign relations
which have heretofore foiiml a place lu
executive messages, hut are now contain
ed lu a report of the secretary of state,
which Is herewith submitted.
Itl.lcou* Mud llloody.
At tlie outset of a reference to the more
Important matters alfecting our relations
with foreign poweis. it would ultord mo
satisfaction If I could assure the congress
that the disturbed condition in Asiatic
Turkey had, during the past year, as
sumed a less hideous und bloody aspect,
and that either us a consequence of the
awakening of the Turkish government to
the demands of humane clvlllzuiIon, or as
the result of decisive action on the part of
tile great mi I Ions having the right by
treaty to interfere for the protection of
those exposed to the rage of mad bigotry
uihI cruel fanaticism, the shocking fea
tures of the situation hail been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcoming a sofi
cued disposition or protective interven
tion. we have been iillllcled by continued
?nd not {infrequent reports of the wanton
destructloiiof homes and the bloody butch
ery of men, women and children, made
martyrs to their profession of Christian
faith. \\ bile none of our cltlr.chs lu Tur
key have thus far been killed or wounded,
though often in the midst of dreadful
Beetles of danger, their safety In the fu
ture Is by no means assured. Our govern
"lent at linmeuiid out minister atConstan
tlnople have left nothing undone to pro
tect our missionaries In Ottoman territo
ry, who constitute nearly ull the Individ
uals residing there who have a right t
claim our protection on the score of Amer
ican citizenship.
Our effort* In this direction will not lie
relaxed; but the best, feeling ami sympa
thy that have been aroused among our
people ought not to so far blind their rea
son ami Judgment as to lead Ihem lo de
mand Impossible things. The outbreaks of
blind fury which lead to murder and pil
lage In Turkey occur suddenly and wit'
out notice, mid nn attempt 011 our part'
force such a hostile presence there
might be effective for prevention or pi.
lection would not only be resisted by the
Ottoman go\ eminent, but would be re
gn riled us 1111 Interruption of their plans
by the great tuitions who assert their ex
clusive right to Intervene In their own
lime und method for the security of life
snd property lu Turkey.
Tiling* and Drat ruction.
Several naval vessels are stutloned lu
the Mediterranean as a measure of cau
tion mid to furnish all possible relief und
refuge In ease of emergency. We have
made claims against the Turkish govern
ment for the pillage ami destruction of
missionary property at Hurpoot mid M11
rasli during uprisings at those places
Thus far the validity of these ili-mumls
has not been admitted, though our minis
tcr, prior to such outrages and In antici
pation of danger, demanded protection for
the persons ami property of our mission
ary Citizens In the localities ntioned
und notwithstanding that strong cvlileiicc
exlsts of actual complicity of Turkish sol
diers lu the work of destruction ami rob
bcry. Hie facts, as they now appear do
not permit un to doubt the justice of these
claims, and nothing will be omltlcd to
bring about their prompt settlement,
A 'number of Armenian refugees having
arrived at our ports, 1111 order has lately
been obtained from the Turkish govern
ment permitting the wives mid children
of such refugees lo Join them here. It |H
hoped that hereafter 111. obstacle will lie
Interposed lo prevent I he escape of all
those who seek to. avobl. tlie perils li 1.-I1
threaten them lu Turkish dominions
Our recently appointed consul to Krzc
runi Is at his post discharging the du
ties of his oflicc. though for some unac
countable reason his formal exequatur
from the sultan has not been Issued.
I do not believe that the present somber
prospect In Turkey will be long permitted
to offend the sight of Christendom. It so
mars the humane and enlightened civilisa
tion thai belongs to the close of the nine
teenth century that It seems hardly possi
ble that the earnest demand of good peo
ple throughout the Christian world for lis
corrective treatment will remain 11111111
swereil.
The Cuban IimirreetIon.
Tlio Insurrection In Cuba still continues
with nil Its perplexities. It Is difficult to
imrcolvo Hint iiny progress tins thus ^:ir
been imido to wind tin* puciUcat ion of the
Isluiifl. or that the sltuntion of affairs its
Mopli'tcd In my last annual iiicKsnxc litis In
the lea81 Improved. If Spnin still holds
Havana and the seaports and all the eon
Blderabie towns, the Insurgents still roam
at will over at least two-thirds of tlie In
land country.
If the determination of Spain to put
down the Insurrection \ vmus but to
strengthen with tho lapse of' time, as
evinced by her unhesitating devotion ?f
largely Increased malltary and naval
forces to the task, there Is much reason
to believe that the insurgents liavo gained
in point of numbers, and character, and
resources, ami art* none the less indexible
In their resolve not to succumb without
practically securing the great objects for
which they took up arms.
If Spain lias not yet re-established her
authority, neither have the Insurgents yet
f.iade good their title to be regarded as an
Independent state. As the contest goes
on the pretense that civil government ex
ists on the Island, except so far as Spain
Is about to maintain it, has been practi
cally abandoned. Spain does keep on foot
auch a government, more or less Imper
fectly, hi tlie large towns and their Imme
diate suburbs. llut, that exception being
made, tho entire country Is either given
over to anarchy or is subject to the mili
tary occupation of one or the other party.
It Is reported, Indeed, on reliable au
thority that, at the demand of the com*
inandcr-luchlef of the insurgent army,
the putative Cuban government has now
given up all attempt to exercise Its func
tions, leaving tliat government confessed
ly (what there Is the best reason for sup
posing It always to have been in fact) a
government merely on paper.

Hut while such seejm'd tlio original pol

lago to tlio enemy.
It Is tothe suineend that,In pursuaneeof
general orders. Spanish garrisons are now
being withdrawn from plantations and
the rural population required to concen
trate Itself III the towns. The mire result
would seem to be Hint the Industrial val
ue of the Island Is fast diminishing and
that unless there is a speedy and radleal
change In existing conditions II will soon
disappear altogether. That value consists
very largely, of ionise, in lis capacity to
produce sugar, a capacity already much
reduced by the lulcrrupllnns to tillage
which have taken placo during the last
two yearn.
It Is reliably assorted that should these
Interruptions continue during the current
year, and practically extend, as Is now
threatened* lo llie entire sugar-producing
territory of the Island, so milch lime and
so much money will bo required lo restore
the laud to Its normal productiveness that
It Is extremely doubtful if capital can bo
I ml need lo even make llie attempt.
The spectacle of llie utter ruin of an ad
Joining country,by nature one of llie most
fertile and charming on llie globe, would
engage the serious attention of the gov
ernment and people of tin* United Stales
in any circumstances. In point of fact,

The result Is < lint this government Is
constantly culled upon lo protect Ameri

ed at many millions of dollars, anil lo nsk
explanations and apologies for the acts of
Spanish olllclals whose zeal for Iho sup
pression of the rebellion sometimes blinds
them lo llie Immunllles belonging to the
unoirendlng citizens of a friendly power.
It follows from the same causes that the
United States Is compelled to actively po
lice a lone line of seacoast against unlaw
ful expeditions, llie escape of which the
u I most vigilance will not always sulllee
to prevent.
]*onlllvn Intervention.
These Inevitable entanglements of tho
17riI(?*?1 States with tlio rebellion In Cuba,
the largo American property Interests af
fected. and considerations of philanthropy
nml huniaiilty In general, have led to a
vehement demand In various quarters for
some sort of positive Intervention on the
part of the United States.
It was at first proposed that belligerent
rights should be aeeorded to the Insur
gents a proposition no longer urged be
cause an untimely and Impractical opera
tIon clearly perilous and Injurious to our
owii Interests. It has since been and Is
now sometimes contended that the Imlc
pcudcnce of the Insurgents should be ree
ok nixed.
Hut Imperfect and restricted as the
Spanish government of the Island may be.
m> other exists there, unless the will of
the military otllcer In temporary command
of a particular district can he dignified as
a species of government. it Is now also
suggested that Me United States should
buy the Island?s suggestion possibly wor
thy of consideration If there were any
evidence of a desire or willingness on the
part of Spain to entertain such a proposal.
It is urged, finally, that, all other moth
ods failing, the existing Internecine strife
In t'uha should be terminated by our In
tervention, even lit the cost of war be
tween the United States and Spain?a war
which Its advocates confidently prophesy
could lie neither large in Its proportions
nor doubtful In Its Issue. The correctness
of this forecast need lie neither ullirmcd
nor denied. The United States has, nev
ertheless, a character to maintain as a na
tion, whlrh plainly dictates that right and
not might should be tin* rule of Its con
duct
Further, though, the United States Is
not a nation to whlrh peace Is a necessi
ty. it Is In truth the most pacific of pow
ers ami desires nothing so much as to live
In amity with all the world. Its own am
ple and diversified domains satisfy all pos
sible longings for territory, preclude all
dreams of conquest, and prevent any cast
ing of covetous eyes upon neighboring re
gions, however attractive.
Our Conduct Toward Spain.
That our conduct towards Spain and her
dominions has constituted 110 exception to
this national disposition I* made manifest
by the course of our government, not only
thus far during tlie present Insurrection,
but during the ten years that followed the
rising at Vara lu ISfW.
No other great power. It may safely be
said, under circumstances of similar per
plexity. would have manifested tin* same
restraint and flu* same patient endurance.
It may also 1m* said that this persistent
attitude of the United States toward
Spain hi connection with Cuba unques
tionably evinces no slight respect and re
gard for Spain on tlu> part of the Amer
ican people.
They iu truth do not forget her connec
tion wlfli the discovery of the western
hemisphere, not* do they underestimate
the great qualities of the Spanish people,
nor fall t.? fully recognize their splcmlhl
patriotism ami their chivalrous devotion
to the national honor. They view with ,
wonder and admiration the cheerful reso- ,
lutloii with whlr h vast bodies of men are i
sent across thousands of miles of ocean,
and an enormous debt accumulated, that
the costly possession of the ticm of tin*
Antilles may still hold Its place 16 the
Spanish crown.
And yet neither the government nor the
people of the United States have shut
their eyes to the coursc of events In t'u
tiu, nor have failed to rcall/.c the existence
of conceded grievances which have led to
tho present revolt from the authority of
Spain grievances rccognlzcd by the queen
regent and by the corfes. voiced by the
most patriotic ami enlightened of Spanish
statesmen without even regard lo party,
ami demonstrated by reforms proposed hy
the executive and approved hy the legls
latlvc branch of the Spanish government.

tion of tl]e Spanish government to remc's
those grievances, fffrtlflctT T?y InnuenlfiTT

licntilnn Autonomy.
It would seem lluil If Hpiiln should offer
to Ciil;a genuine autonomy, lioiu? rule
which, while preserving the sovereignly
of Spain, wouhl satisfy all rational re
quirements of her Spanish subject*), there
should bo no Just reason why the pacifica
tion of the Island might not bo effected on
that basis. Such a result would appear lo
bo in tiio true Interest of ail couccrncd.
It would at once slop the conflict which Is
now consuming the resources of the Island
and making It worthless for whichever
party may ultimately prevail. It would
keep Intact the possessions of Spain with
out touching her honor, which will bo con
sulted rather than impugned by the ade
quate redress of admitted grievances.
It would put the prosperity of the Island
nnd the fortunes of its Inhabitants within
their own control without severing the
natural and ancient ties which bind them
to tlie mother country, and would yet en
able them to test their capacity for self
government under the most favorable con
ditions. It has been objected on the one
side that Spain should not promise auton
omy until her Insurgent subjects lay down
their firms: on the other side, that prom
ised autonomy, however liberal, Is lusuOl
dent, because without assurance of the
promise being fulfilled.
lint the reasonableness of n requirement
by Spain of unconditional surrender on
the part of the Insurgent Cubans before
their autonomy Is conceded Is not alto
get her apiuironl. IJ Ignores _ I moor taut
teafurcsor f.*?e s.'duitfoii?the stability two
years' duration has given to I he Insurrec
tion, the feasibility of Its Indefinite pro

shown by past experience, the utter and
Imminent ruin of the Island unless the
present si rife is speedily composed; abovo
all, the rank abuses which all purties In
Spain,all branches of her government and
all her loading public men concede to ex
ist and profess a desire to remove.
During such circumstances to withhold
the? proffer of needed reforms until the
parties demanding them put themselves at
Its mercy by throwing down their arms
has the appearance of ncglcctlng the
gravest of perils and Inviting suspicion as
to the sincerity of any professed willing
ness lo gram reforms. The objection on
behalf of the Insurgets?that promised
reforms can not be relied upon?must of
course be considered, though we have no

Ing thai anything Spain undertakes to do

l*roponltlon to Spain.
Nevertheless, all realizing that suspi
cious and precautious on the part of the
weaker of two combatants are always
natural ami not always Justifiable?being
sincerely desirous in the interest of both
as well as on Its own account that the
Cuban problem should be solved with the
least possible delay?It was Intimated by
tills government to I fie government of
Spain some months ago, if a satisfactory
measure of home rule were tendered the
Cuban Insurgents and would ho accepted
by them upon a guaranty of Its execution,
the Culled Slates would endeavor to find
a way not objectionable lo Spain of fur
nishing such guaranty.
While no <!?'iiiilto response to this Inti
mation has yet been received from the
Spanish government. It Is believed to be
not altogether unwelcome, while, as al
ready suggested, no reason is perceived
why it should not be approved by the In
surgents. Neither party can fail lo see
the Importance of early action, and both
must realize Hint lo prolong the present
slnte of things for even :i short period
will add enormously to the time and labor
and expenditure necessary t?> bring about
the Industrial recuperation of the Island.
II is. therefore, fervently hoped on nil
grounds that earnest efforts for healing
the breach between Spain and the Insur
gents. upon the lilies above indicated,
may be sit once Inaugurated and pushed to
no Immedinte and successful Issue. The
friendly ollices of the Culled Stales, ell her
in the manner nliove outlined or in any
oilier way ronsistont with our eoustltu
Hon ami our laws, will always he at the
dlsnosal of either parly.
Whatever circumstances may arise our
policy nnd our Interests would constrain
us lo object to tIn? acquisition of the Isl
and or an Interference with Its control by
nny other power.
Our I'ntidnnfl Muy llo ICxIiannted.
It should be added that It cannot be rea
sonably assumed that the hitherto expect
ant attitude of the Cnlted States will be
Indefinitely maintained. Willie we are an
xious to accord all due respect to the sov
erelgnty or Spain, nvo cannot view the
pending conflict in all Its features, and
properly apprehend our Inevitably close
relations to I', and Its possible results,
without considering that by the course
t>f events wo may bo drawn into such an
unusual and unprecedented condition a:i
will fix a limit to our patient waiting loi
Spain to end the contest, either alone an
In her own way, or with our friendly co
operation.
When the inability of Spain to deal suc
cessfully with the Insurrection has be
come manifest and it Is demonstrated that
her sovereignty Is extinct hi Cuba for all
purposes of its rightful existence, and
tvlien a hopeless struggle for its re-estab
lishment has degenerated into a strife
which means nothing more than the use
less sacrifice of human life and the tiller
destruction of the very subject-matter of I
the conflict, a situation will be present* <1 ;
In which our obligations to the sovereignty
of Spain will be superseded by higher ob
ligations which we can hardly hesitate to
recognize and discharge.
Daly of United State*.
Deferring the choice of ways and meth
ods until the time for action arrives, w
should make them depend upon the pro
eise conditions then existing; and I hey
should not lie determined upon without
giving careful heed to every consideration
Involving our honor and Interest, or the
International duty wo owe to Spain. Until

Our Public I.and*
originally amounting to 1,S 10,000.000 acres
have been so reduced that only about
800.000.000 acres still remain in government

being by far the most .valuable portion,
has been given away to settlers, to now
states and to railroads, or sold at a com

The patenting of land In execution of

during the year, and since the lth day of

TIib Total Indian I'opiilat Ion
of the United States Is 177.235. according
to a census made In 1S95, exclusive of
those within the State of New York and
those comprising the five civilized tribes.
Of this number there are approximately
38,000 children of school age. During the

that In every particular the improvement
of the Indians titular government care

Tl??? I m.Kloi. Knit.
The diminution of our enormous pension
roll and the decrease of pension expend
itures. which have been so often i.-onti
dcutly foretold, still fail In material
realization. The number of pensioners
on the rolls at the close of the fiscal veat
ended Juno :iO. ISOu. was 07O.O7S. This Is
the largest number ever reported. The
amount paid exclusively for pensions dur
ing the year was $I3S,2M.7C1.9I. a slight
decrease from that of -he preceding vear.
while the total expenditures on account
of pensions, including t::e cost of main
taining the department and expense at
tending pension distribution, amounted tc '
$142,206.6f?0.f?9. or within a very small frac
tion of one-third of the entire expense oil
supporting the government during the
same year. The number of new pension ?
certificates issued was ?0,010. Of these!
40.371 represent original allowances of

Th? I)f p ?rtinei?t of Agrlcit't ure

of our people and the prosperity of out
nation that It should constantly rccelve
the care and encouragement of the gov

grown to b? the center of agricultural in
telligence and the source of aid and en
couragement to agricultural efforts. I?arg:
Minis of money are annually appropriate )
for tin* maintenance of this department
and it must be confessed that the legisla
tion relating to It has not always beer
directly III the Interest of practical fann
ing or properly guarded against waste
and extravagance. So far. however, at
public money has been appropriated free*
ly and sensely to help those* who actuall>
till 'the soil, no expenditure has been more
profitably made or more generally approv
ed by the people.
In my opinion the* gratuitous dlstiihu

prcs?2tf conducted ouuht to be discontin
ued. No one can road the statement of
tho necictary on this auoject and J0ut>t
the extravagance and (pie-atlcr Ado rvMtltft
of this practice. Thd professed fri?ud<; of

Civil Service It* farm.
- The progress made In civil service re
form furnishes u cause for the utmost
congratulations. it has survived the
doubts of Its friends, as well ??.% the rancor
of its enemies, and has gained a perma
nent place among the agencies destined
to cleanse our notifies and to Improve,
economize and elevate the public service.
There are now in the competitive classi
fied service upward of eighty-four thou
sand places. More? than half of these
have been lnclude-d from time to time,
since March i. 1S03. A most radical and
sweeping extension was made by executive
order dated Gth day of May, ISfKJ, and if
fourth-class posCitiastershlps are not In
cluded in the statement it may lie said
that practically all positions contemplated
by tho civil service law are now classified.
Abundant reasons exist for including
the*se post masterships.
Tin? Turin*.
I desire to recur to the statements else
where made concerning tin* government's
receipts and expenditures for the purpose
of venturing upon some suggestions
touching our present tariff law and Its op
ei a i ion.
This statute took effect on fhe 2Stli day
of August. ISO I. Whatevi r so may be it:'
shortcomings as a complete measure of
tariff or tariff reform, it must be conced
ed it has oncncd the way to a freer anil ,
greater exchange of commodities between
us and other countries, and thus furnish
ed a wider market for our products and
manufactures. The only entire fiscal year
during which this law has been in force
ended on the .'101 h day of June. IStMJ. In that 1
year our imports Increased over those of
tho previous year more than SG.fiOO.OOJ.
while the value of 1 h? ? domestic products
we expected and which found markets
abroad, was nearly $70.0r.o.U00 more than
during the preceding year.
1 believe our presi nt tariff law. if al
lowed a fair opportunity, will, in the near
future, yield a revenue which, with rea
sonably economical expenditures. will
overcome all deficiencies. In t'.ie mean
time the deficit that has occurred, oi
may occur, need not exi lie or disturb us.
Dcft'clt anil Siirplun.
To meet any such deficit we have in tl
treasury In addition to a gold reserve o?
one hundred millions, a surplus of more
than one hundred and twenty-eight mil
lions of dollars applicable to the payment
of the expenses of the. government, and
which must, unless expended for that
purpose, remain a useless hoard, or If not
extravagantly used, must in any event
bo perverted from the purpose of Its ex
action from the people. The payment,

Political Kuonoiny.
Ail Individual living beyond his Incom
and embarrassing himself with debt or
drawing upon his accumulated fund ? '
principal, is cither unfortunate or im
provident. The distinction is between a
government charged with the duty of ex
pending for the benefit of the people and
for proper purposes all the money it re
ceives from any source, and the individual
who is expect* d to manifest a natural de
sire to avoid d'-bt or to accumulate as
mueli as possible and In live within the
Income derived from such accumulations,
to the end that they may be Increased or
at least icm.-lii unimpaired for the future
use and cnjovment ?i himself or the ob
jects of his love and affcctlou who may
survive him.
Our Financial .Method*.
This reference to the condition and pros
1 pec:.- of our revenues naturally sugge.-It
an allusion to the weakness and vi? ? s of
our financial methods. They have i,t 11?
frequently pressed upon the attcn.ion ? ? f
congress in previous executive commutii
I cations and the inevitab'c danger of th.fr
cou;!nui<l tolerat'oa pointed out. Without
now repeat ng these details, I cannot re'
frain frcm again earnestly presenting the
necessity of he prompt reform of a sys
tem opposi d .o c\< ry rule of sound finau ;?
and shovvn by experience to be fratig.
| with Us? greatest p? >11 and perplexity. Tli
terrible civil war, which shook the foun
dations of our government more than
thirty years ago, brought in Its train the
de*truction of property.the wasting of our
country's substance and the estrangement
of brethren. These are now past and foi
j gotten. Kven the distressing loss of life
the conflict entailed is but a sacred mem
ory, which fosters patriotic sentiment and
keeps alive a lender regard for those who
nobly died. And yet there remains with
us today. In full strength and activity,
as an incident of that tremendous strug
! gle, a feature of Its financial necessities,
j not only unsulted to our present circum
stances. but manifestly a disturbing men
ace to business security and an ever-prcs
ent agent of monetary distress.
Tim fSold Standard.
Because we may be enjoying a tempor
ary relief from Its depressing influence,
tills should not lull us Into a false se
curity. nor lead us to forego the sudden*
ness of past visitations. I am more con
vinced than ever that we can have no as
sured financial peace and safety until tin
government currency ohl:guticns, upon
which gold may be demanded from the
treasury, are withdrawn from circulation
anil cancelled. This might be d .ne, a?
has been heretofore recommended, l?>
their hange for long-term b??nds, bear
Irg a Sow rate of Interest, or by their re
de mptioii with the proceeds of such
bonds.
Iiiuo of Hand*.
Kven if only the United States notes,
known as greenbacks.were thus retired.it
i.^ probable that the treasury notes, issued
iu payment of silver purchases under the
act of July 14. 1890, now paid In gold wlun
demanded, would not create such disturb
ance as they might, from t^ue to time,
when received in the treasurjPby redemp
tion In gold or otherwise, be gradually
and prudently replaced by silver coin. This
plan of issuing bonds for the purpose of
redemption certainly appears to be the
rnos; effective and direct path to the need
id reform. In default of this, however, it
would be a step in the right direction il
currency obligations, redcemab.e iu gold
whenever so redeemed, should be can
celled Instead of being re-Issued. Thi*
operation would be a slow remedy, but it
would improve present conditions.
National banks should redeem their own
notes. They should be allowed to Issue
circulation to the par value of the bond*
deposited as security for its redemption
and the tax on their circulation should
be reduced to one-fourth *>t 1 per cent.
Hctiring United States Hand*.
In considering projects for the retire
ment of U. S. notes and treasury notes
issued under the law of 1S90. 1 am of the
opinion that we have placed too much
stress upon the danger of contracting the
currency and have calculated too little
upon the gold that would be added to our
circulation it* invited to us by better and
safer financial methods. It Is not so much
a contraction of our currency that should
be avoided as Its unequal distribution.
This might be obviated and any fear of
harmful contraction at the same time re
moved by allowing the organization of
smaller banks and In less populous com
munities than are now permitted, and
also authorizing existing banks to estab
lish branches In small communities under
proper restrictions.
Tru*!* and Combiner,
Another topic in which our people right
fully take a deep interest may be here
briefly considered, I refer to the exist
ence of trusts and other huge aggrega
tions of capital, the object of which |? tc
hocure the monopoly of some particular
branch of trade. Industry or commerce
gnd to stifle wholepomo competition.
NVhen these are defended it Is usually on
the ground that though they increase
profits they also reduce prices and thus
benefit the public. It must be remem
bered. however, that a reduction of prices
to the people Is not one of the real objects
of these organisation?, nor Is their tend
ency necessarily In that direction. If It
occurs In a particular case It Is only bo
cause It accords with the purposes or In
terests of those managing the schemes.
When, however, it Is considered that j
those \yho bear.the.bnrder\s of tiixnt^yj
TTHVC no irunrnnty or nonwt care save m
the fidelity of their public servants, the
duty of nil possible retrenchment le
plainly manifest.
When our differences are forgotten, and
our contrasts of political opinion are no
longer remembered, nothing In the retro
spect of our public service will be as
fortunate and comforting: as the recollec
tion of official duty well performed and
the memory of a constant devotion to the
Interests of our confiding fellow-country
men. OROVER CliEVELAND.
