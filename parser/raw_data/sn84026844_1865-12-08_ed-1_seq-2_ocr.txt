The Praldenl'a Wnwwif < Hlw Kollry
of."Kefomilpurt Ion."
The distinguishing feature of Presi
dent Johnson's message", and tlie ono
which, anticipated, excited most expec
tation, and, now before the country,
will elicit most discussion, is the enun
ciation of hia policy respecting the States
lately in open rebellion. According to
the President's theory, the work to be
done is not a work of "reconstruction,"
accurately speaking, but of rehabilita
tion. lie holds that it is not in the pow
er of any State to secede, and that the
Union therefor baa never been dissolved
and does not need to be reconstructed.
Tho elaborate and able arguuieut with
which the message seta out to show that
in constituting the Federal Union, states
were intended to and do possess a dis
.tinctivo individual character as subor
dinate parts of the Union, and that in
that character they are as iiwJestructiblo
as tho Union itself, is designed, unless
we mistake its purpose, to overthrow
the theory entertaiued by Mr. Stephens,
of Pennsylvania, Senator Sumner and
others, who hold that the rebellious
States no longer possess any distinctive
character as States, but simply form an
area of conquered territory subject like
any other territory of the United States
lo the legislation of Congress. This
proposition can only be reached by
conceding that the rebel Suites did in
reality withdraw from tho Union ; that
they thus became a league of foreigu
powers, and as such wero conquered
and are uow held by a power which un
der this theory cannot be tho Federal
govornuient, becauso the Union having
been broken up by tho withdrawal of a
portion of tho States, that government
then ceased to oxist. Until difficulties
like these are cleared nw^ from Mr.
Thud. Stephens' torritoriaUtheory, we
cannot adopt or commend it.
Tho President's definition of tho re
lations between tho Oeueral Govern
ment and tho State Governments could
scarcely have been rendered more sim
ple and lucid.
The maintenance of the Union brings
with it "tho support of the State Gov
ernments in all their right;" but it is
not one of the right* of any Stale Gov
ernment to renounce its own place in
tho Union, or to nullify the laws of tho
Union. ? ? ? * ? * *
"The sovereignty of the States" is the
language of tho Confederacy, and not
tho languago of tho Constitution. The
latter contains the emphatic words:
"The Constitution, and the laws of the
Cuited States, which shall las made in
pursuance thereof, and all treaties made
or whieh shall 1h> made under the au
thority of tho United States, shall be
the supremo law of tho land; and the
judges in every State shall bo bound
thereby, anything in the constitution
or lawa of any State to the contrary
notwithstanding."
Certainly the Government of the
Culled States is a limited government;
and so is every State government a
limited government. With us, this
idea of limitation spreads through
every form of administration, general,,
State, and municipal, and rests on the
great distinguishing principles of the
recognition of tho rights of men. The
ancient republics absorl>od the individ
ual in tho State, prescribed his religion,
and controlled his activity. The Auier
lean system rests on tho assertion of
the equal right of every man to life,
liberty. and the pursuit of happiness; i
to freedom of conscience, to the culture
and exercise of all his faculties. An a |
consequence, the State Government is
limited, as to the General Government ]
In the Interest of Union, us to the indi- :
vidua! citizen in the iuterest of free- j
tloin.
States with proper limitations of pow
er, arc essential to the existence of the j
Constitution of the United States. At
the very, commencement, when we as
sumed a place among the Powers of the j
earth, the l>eelaration of 1 independence !
was adopted by States; so also were the
ArticlosofConfcderation;nnd when "the
People of the United States" ordained
and established the Constitution, it was
the assent of the Slates, one by ono,
which gave It vitality. In the event,
too, of any amendment to the Constitu
tion, the proposition of Congress needs
the confirmation of Stales. Without
States, one great branch of tho logisln
lative government would be wanting.
Upon these definitions of terms, the
President founds tho enunciation af
his policy of restoration. To our peo
ple, at least, his theory is uot a novel
one. It is that upou which the Govern
ment of Virginia was rehabilitated, by
tho Convention held in this city in the
an turner of 1861. That laxly, by what
now seeina to have been a happy in
spiration, exemplified for the first time
in tho history of tho coantry, the re
sumption by a State of suspended pow
ers of government. Their theory was
that the State of Virgin la, aa an abstract
government, and as a subordinate but
distinctive member of the entire Gov
ernment of the Union, was coexistent
with that government, and that neither
could be destroyed by force; that the
persons exercising the functions of the
State, in making war on the General
Government necessarily made war ou
the source whence they derived their
own powers, and thereby abdicated
their functions; that tho powers of
government Incapable of annihilation
returned for exercise to those who were
willing to exercise them. They held
that tho powers of tho State were in
herent and its relation to the Central
Government unchanged; that tho exer
cise of these powers was simply sua
pcuded by the abandonment on the
part of the agents; that it was ouly no
cessary to rcclothe tho powers of gov
ernment belonging to the people repro
sented in the Convention, by appoint
ing new agents for their proper exer
cise; and this they did.
Tho Government of the Uuited States,
in its several departments recog
nized tho legality of these proceed
ing*. by acts so complete and bind
ing thai they can never be undone;
and this policy, net ouly rccoguized as
valid, but deliberately adopted, by the
government under the administration
of Mr. Lincoln, has since been pursued
and U now officially declared bv Presi
dent Johnson.
If It Is agreed that the States are to lie
restored in a particular mode. It i* *till
a question how rapidly or how cautious
ly tho work is to be done, a discretion
equal to the demands of public safctv
must vest somewhere; and it does vest
in Congress. The President affirms
this when he says to Congress that thev
are to judge for themselves of the elec
tion,returns and qualifications ot mem
bers applying from the lately rebellious
States. The work of rehabilitation in
tho State may go on to completion ex
cept as to the admission to representa
tion in Congreeis, and when representa
tives are admitted to both Houses the
State is fully restored to the sisterhood
of States.
But Congress, as representing the na
tion, has a right to be satisfied that the
public safety will not be endaugered,
before admitting representation rrom 4
Slate even if reorganized; and iu the dis
cretion vested in it, clearly bus this pow
er. It is only a question as to how long
the functions of particular States shall
be suspended; anil that question is. to
be answered by tho question of safe
ty. It may bo deemed safe and expe
dient to admit the delegates from Ten
j nesseo this winter, while it might be
I deemed unsafe' and inexpedient to ad
| mit representation from South Car
olina, though it had gone as far in the
? forms of reorganization as Tennessee,
i The President buys his policy is at
! tended with some risk. If he means
; tliat a State would have a right to c/e
itaand representation iu Congress as
soon as it had gone through the forms
of a reorganization, and Congress had
i no power to deny it, theu wo agree
there would be risk, and a good deal of
it. But we understand the president
himself coneedes this power to Con
gress, and think if it is exercised with
moderate statesmanship there is but
little risk.
We believe, therefore, there is no sub
stantial difference or. this questidn be
tween tho President and the majority
in Congress; for we take it the territo
rial theory men are a minority. There
may be differences as to the rate of pro
gress, but wo think not as to the mode
of procedure. Upon this point
tho President does not even take
tho liberty of making sugges
tions, much less of attempting to
dictate, but leaves the entire question
with Congress, where it belongs.
There are other points In tho message
closely connected with the general
policy of restoration, to which we shall
take occasion to refer hereafter.

We are }?ermitted to make the follow
ing extracts from a letter written by
| lion. C. 1>. Hubbard, our member
! of Congress, tinder dato of 4tli Inst.:
? * ? ~ "j V
"The House was organized without"
much delay, Brooks, of New York,
I making an ineffectual effort to have the
I names of tho u'u*niben* from Tennessee
I and Virginia placed on the roll. 1 am
not fully satisfied with tho resolution
adopted in reference to thesecededStates.
There seemed to Ik; no alternative, how
ever, and those entitled to seats may
more readily obtain them through the
Committee than by a direct api>eal to
tiio House. I fear, however, that
Stevens, who is the author of the reso
lution, and others, have not given up
their territorial idea, and that there is
more behind it.
"Some of our friends are n little anx
ious as to the status of West Virginia,
in case the territorial theory prevails.
But I contend we are equally safe on
either theory. If the seceded States
I aro regarded as conquered territory,
i then we are a State erected out of that
j territory, as Stevens indicated in his
speech on the admission of tho now
I State, which Congress could of righldo.
! If the States aro still States in the
| Union, and have never been out, then
| wo must stand by the restored govern
| ment of Virgiuia'and claim our legiti
macy through that.
"The lirst theory, \vh!ch would regard
' us as conquered territory, is not very
complimentary to our loyalty and de
votion to the 'Union on which we have
provided ourselves, ami which history
will accord to us; nevertheless it caunut
deprive us of our integrity in thoUnion.
* . * * There is a delegation here
from Frederick county trying to get
some legislation that will transfer them
to tho now State. I wotdd l>o glad to
help them, if possible; but it seems to
mo out of tho power of Congress to in
terfere, except on tho territorial theory.

"There is not a man or woman who i

ishos whatevor uuly he the vicissitudes
Of ita editors, Is perhaps worth noting
from time .to time. jA. recent number
contains n communication, signed
"Junius," conspicuously placed in the
editorial columns. It berates the Union
men of the South after this fashion
"Many of them?yen, the most of
them?were men of no.cliarpcterrf and
of no position in the South. Many of
them were disappointed oflice .seekers,
who, like Miyawber, yet without his
honest maniless, were ever 'waiting for
something to turn up.' Many of them
?*1 speak that I do know, and testify
that I have seen'; many of them were
men that made their living at the ex
pense of the confederate government.
They say now, it was not from love of
the cause, but through necessity. Itath
i er a strange doctrine to preach at this
day, and one that only deepens their
: former hypocrisy. Many of them were
1 moneyless adventurers, who gathered,
as the buzzards gather around the car
cass of a dead animal, to feed and . fat
ten on the ruins of once noble und opu
lent people. In any case they are men
that have been confessedly actuated by
supreme selfishness. They ure lost to
all sense of patriotism and philan
thropy. They are totally devoid of
every generous impulse of a noble
manhood, aud they are recreant to
every trust that God and man had im
posed upon them...
"And, as an honest man, I must as
sert that np man .can take that oath in
the South who is worthy of oflice : and,
for myself, I had ruther see a regular
Yankee imported for every such oflice
than to see them given to our Union
men."
This tirade is worth nothing except
to show the animu* of the writer and
the character of the paper. The con
current testimony of those who have
traveledjat theSoutli since the war, goes
to show thftt those men who have been
in the Southern army are now most to
bo trusted, while those who staid at
home and fattened on government con
tracts are still the most bitter against
the Union.

General Grant's report to the Secre
tary of War is dated July 22, 1K>5. It
does not contain anything new, there
foie, and is chiefly valuable as contain
ing a succinot and brief olGcial history

are already well known to the public,
! and need not l>e repeated; but his opin
ions of Homo of his Generals are fresh
and not very llattcring to Rosecrans,
Butler, and the Gen. Smith who com
manded at the battle of Petersburg.
His opinion of Sheridan is rather j
graphically expressed. j
"Fearing to telegraph the order for j
. an attack without knowing more than |
I 1 did of the General's feelings as to what |
i would I bo the probable result, 1 left
City Point on the 15th of Septeml?er, to
visit him at his headquarters, to decide,

that tho result was such that I have I

the expense of all his property. 'He
thought there were not "over one Hun
dred men in the country who could be
trusted as Union men; he was very cer
tain the President ought not to pardon
Howell Cobb, and reckoned it would
have been a good thing if Gen. Wilson
had strung him up the first time he got
eves on him; he wanted South Carolina
blotted out of existence as a State,
and allowed it would suit every
Union man in tho South it she was
turned over to the niggers; he could
never vote for a man who was a seces
sionist, and liadu't voted at the recent
congressional election; he was glad the
president had paroled Alexander Ste
phens, though he wanted a man to 1k?
one thing or t'other, nothalf Uniou and
half secesh, and he hoped C. C. Clay
would Boon Ihj paroled; as for Jeff Da
vis, he didift "know, though he reck
oned the old fellow might as well beset
