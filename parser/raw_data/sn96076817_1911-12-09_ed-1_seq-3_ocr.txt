PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Taft Comes Out As the Champion of
the Sherman Law.
President Taft's third annual nies
Rape' to congress, devote I exclusively
to Ihe Sherman antitrust act and the
trust question In genera I, was read In
congress
The president defended tho Sherman
act as interpreted by tho supremo
court of the I'ldted States. Indicated
plainly his opposition to the repeal or
amendment of this statute, hut sug
gested that congress pass a federal
incorporation law and supplemental
legislation that "would describe and
denounce methods of inmpetltlon that
ate unfair."
To superle corporations chat ten i
under federal law. President Taft ;,o
posed the formation of an executive
bureau, or commission, with powers
akin to those of the' inters ale com
ment' commission.
Speaking of the di. xdiil ion o; he
tobacco ttusl, the president ih-c tied
that in his opinion "uot in the M ti.iy
of the Aniet 1( ;ui l;iw has a !.cic
more effective for such a piupox teen
entered by a court. '
The supplement egisJ:,rroa the presi
dent desires is explained In a paa
graph: "Ti e attempt and puipte n
Sllpptes.- a coinpet ',or by unde--
selling him at a price so unptolitablo
as to drive him out of business o
the making of exclusive contracts with
customers under which they are re
quired to give up associations wl'h
other manufacturers and nunieirns
kindred methods t;f stlMtng competi
tion and effecting monopoly, should
be described with sufficient accuracy
In a criminal statute on the one hand
lo enable tho govemn -'lit to shorten
its task by prosecuting single misde
meanors Instead of an entire conspira
cy, and on the other hand, to sorxe th
purpose of pointing out more hi detail
to tho business community what must
be avoided."
The president warns business mn
that the Sherman law Is timed at only
dishonest methods. He tbmands a
federal Ineot pot ation law; proposes a
commission to help courts dissolve
trusts and recreate the parts Into le
gal concerns ami warns ngalnst Social
