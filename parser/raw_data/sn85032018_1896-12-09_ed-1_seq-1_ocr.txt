HIS LAST MESSAGE.
President Cleveland Reviews tbe Work of
the Yarlous Department of Government.
Washington, Dec. 7. The Fifty
Fourth congress assera lied for the short
session at noon to-day and soon after
committees from the house and
senate waited on the president and in
formed him that they were ready to
receive any communication he misht
have to laake and the president then
sent the following" communication:
To the Congress of the United States:
As representatives of the people In the legis
lative branch of their government you have as
sembled at a time when tbe strength and ex
cellence of our free institutions and the fitness
of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been
again made manifest. Apolitical contest in
volving momentous consequences, fraught
with feverish apprehension and creating ag
gressiveness so intense as to approach bitter
ness and passion, has been waged throughout
our land and determined by the decree of free
and independent suffrage, without disturbance
of our tranquility or the least sign of weakness
in our national structure. When we consider
these incidents and contemplate the peaceful
obedience and manly submission which have
succeeded a heated clash of political opinions
we discover abundant evidence of a determi
nation on the part of our countrymen to abide
by every verdict of the popular will and to bo
controlled at all times by an abiding faith in
the agencies established for the direction of
the affairs of their government. Thus our peo
ple exhibit a patriotic disposition which en
titles them to demand of those who undertake
to make and execute their laws such faithful
and unselfish service in their behalf as can
only be prompted by a serious appreciation of
the trust and confidence which the acceptance
of public duty invite. In obedience to a con
stitutional requirement. I herein submit to tb
congress certain information concerning na
tional affairs, with the suggestion of such leg
islation as in my judgment is necessary and
expedient. To secure brevity and avoid tire
some narration, I shall o:nit many details con
cerning matters within federal control which,
though by no means unimportant, are more
profitably discussed in departmental reports.
I shall also curtail this communication by
omitting minute recital of many minor inci
dents connected with our foreign relations
which have hitherto found a place in executive
messages, but are now contained In a report of
the secretary of state, which is herewith sub
mitted. The Armenian Question.
At the outset of a reference to more impor
tant matters affecting our relations with foreign
powers it would afford mo satisfaction if I
could assure the congress that the disturbed
condition of Aslatlo Turkey had during the
past year assumed a less hideous and bloody
aspect and that either as a consequence of the
awakening of the Turkish government to the
demands of human civilization, or as the re
sult of decisive action on the part of the great
nations having the right by treaty to interfere
for the protection of those exposed to tbe rage
of mere bigotry and cruel fanaticism, the
shocking features of the situation had been
mitigated. Instead, however, of welcoming a
softening disposition or protective interven
tion, we have been afflicted by continued and
not unfrequent reports of the wanton destruc
tion of homes and the bloody butchery of men,
women and children, made martyrs to their
profession of Christian faith. While none of
our citizens in Turkey have thus far been
killed or wounded, though often In the midst
of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety In
the future Is by no means assured. Our gov
ernment at home and our minister at Constan
tinople have left nothing undone to protect our
missionaries In Ottoman territory, who consti
tute nearly all the individuals residing there
who have a right to claim our protection on
the score of American citizenship,
Several naval vessels are stationed in the Med
iterranean as a measure of caution and to fur
nish all possible relief and refuge in case of
emergency. We have made claims against the
Turkish government for the pillage and de
struction of missionary property at Harpool
and Marash during uprisings at those places.
The Insurrection In Cuba.
The Insurrection In Cuba still continues with
all Its perplexities. It is difficult to perceive
that any progress has thus far been made to
TOPEKA, KANSAS,
wards the pacification of the island or that the
situation of affairs as depleted in my last an
nual message has in the least Improved. If
Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and
all considerable towns, the Insurgents still
roam at will over at least two-thirds of the in
land country. If the determination of Spain
to put down the insurrection seems but to
strengthen with the lapse of time and Is
evidenced by her unhesitating devotion
of largely increased military and naval
forces to the task, there Is muoh rea
son to believe that the Insurgents have gained
in point of numbers, and character, and
resources, and are none the less inflexible in
their resolve not to succumb, without practi
cally securing the great project for which they
took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established
her authority, neither have the insur
gents yet made good their title to be regarded
as an independent state. Indeed, as the con
test has gone on, the pretense that civil gov
ernment exists on the island, except so far as
Spain is able to maintain it, . has been practi
cally abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such
a government, more or less imperfectly, in the
large towns and their immediate suburbs.
But, that exception being made, the entire
country is either given over to an
archy or is subject to the mili
tary occupation of one or the other
party. It is reported, Indeed, on reliable au
thority that, at the demand of the commander-in-chief
of the insurgent army, the putative
Cuban government has now given up all at
tempt to exercise its functions, leaving that
government confessedly (what there Is the
best reason for supposing It always to have
been in fact) a government merely on paper.
Were the Spanish armies "able to meet their
antagonists in the open, or in pitched battle,
prompt and decisive results might bo
looked for and the immense superiority
of the Spanish forces in numbers,
discipline and equipment, could hardly
fail to tell greatly to their advantage.
But they are called upon to face a foe that
shuns general engagements, that can choose
and does choose its own ground, that from the .
nature 01 me country is visiDie or invisioie at
treasure and that fights only from ambuscade
.nd when all the advantages of position and
numbers are on its side. In a country where
all that is indispensable to life in tbe way of
food, clothing and shelter is so easily obtain
able especially by those born and bred on the
soil it is obvious that there Is hardly a limit to
tho time during which hostilities of this sort
may be prolonged. Meanwhile, as in all
cases of protracted civil strife, the pas
sions of the combatants grow more and
more inflamed and excesses on both sides
become more frequent and more deplorable.
They also are participated in by bands of
marauders, who now in the name of one party
and now in the name of the other as may best
suit the occasion, harry the country at will
and plunder its wretched Inhabitants for their
own advantage. Such a condition of things
would inevitably entail immense destruction
of property' even if it were the policy of both
parties to prevent It as far as practicable But
while such seemed to be the original policy of
the Spanish government, it has now apparent
ly abandoned it. and is acting upon the same
theory as the Insurgents, namely, that the ex
igencies of the contest require the wholesale
annihilation of property, that It may not
prove of use and advantage to the enemy.
It is to the same end that in pursuance of gen
eral orders. Spanish garrisons are now being
withdrawn from plantations and tbe rural pop
ulation required to concentrate Itself in the
towns. The sure result would seem to be that
the industrial value of tbe island is fast di
minishing and unless there is a speedy and
radical change in existing conditions, it will
soon disappear altogether. That value con
sists very largely, of course, in its capacity to
produce sugars, a capacity already much-reduced
by the Interruption to tillage, which
have taken place during the last two years.
It is reliably asserted that should these In
terruptions continue during the currant year,
and practically extend, as It Is now threat
ened, to the entire sugar producing territory
of the island, so much time and so much
money will be required to restore the land to
Its normal productiveness that it is extremly
doubtful if capital can be induced to even
make the attempt. Tbe spectacle of the utter
ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one of
the most fertile and charming on the globe
would engage the serious attention of the gov
ernment and people of the United States under
any . circumstances. In point of fact, they
have a concern with It which la ' by
no means of a wholly sentiment!

or philanthropic character. It lies so near to
us as to be hardly separated from our territory.
Our actual pecuniary interest in it is second
only to that of the people and government of
Spain. It is reasonably estimated that at least
from 130,000,000 to I iO.O 0,000 of American cap
ital are Invested in plantations and in railroad,
mining and other business enterprises on the
island. The volume of trade between the
United States and Cuba, which in 1889 amount
ed to about 104,000,000, rose in 1393 to about
Il03,oc0,000, and in 1891, the year before the in
surrection broke out, amounted to nearly 9fl,
OOO.ocO. Besides this large pecuniary stake in
the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds
Itself inextricably Involved in tho present oon
test in other ways, both vexatious and costly.
Many Cubans reside in this country and directly
promote the insurrection through the press by
publio meetings, by the purchase and shipment
of arms, by the raising of funds and by other
means which the spirit of our institutions and
the tenor of our laws do not permit to bo made
the subject of criminal prosecution. Some of
them, though Cubans at heart and in all their
feelings In interests, have taken out papers as
naturalized citizens of the United States, a
proceeding resorted to with a view to possible
protection by this government and not unnatu
rally regarded with much indignation by the
country of their orlgia
These inevitable entang loments of the
United States with the rebellion in Cuba, the
large American property interests affected
and considerations of philanthropy and hu
manity in general have led to a vehement de
mand in various quarters for some sort of pos
itive intervention on the part of the United
States. It was at first proposed that belliger
ent rights should be accorded to the Insur
gents -a proposition no longer urged booause
untimoly and in practical operation clearly
perilous and injurious to our own
Interests. It has since been and
Is now sometimes contended that tho
independence of the insurgents should be
recognized. But imperfect and restricted as
the Spanish government of tho island may be,
no other exists there, unless the will of the
military officer In temporary command of a
particular district can be dignified as a
species of government It is now suggested
that the United States should buy the island, a
suggestion possibly worthy of consideration If
there were any evidonce of a desire or
willingness on the part of Spain to en
tertain such a proposal It is urged, finally,
that all other methods falling, the existing in
ternecine strife in Cuba should bo terminated
by our intervention, even at the cost of war
between the United States and Spain, a war
which its advocates confidently prophecy could
be neither large in its proportions nor doubtful
in its issue. The correctness of this forecast
need be either affirmed nor denied. The United
States has nevertheless the character to main
tain as a nation, which plainly dictates that
right and might should be tbe rulo of Its con
duct
It would seem that If Spain should offer to
Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home
rule whlch.whlle preserving the sovereignty of
Spain would satisfy all rational requirements
of her Spanish subjects, there should be no
Just reason why the pacification of the Island
might not be effected on that basis. It was in
timated by this government to the government
oj Spain some months ago thit if a satisfac
tory measure of home rule were tendered
the Cuban Insurgents and would be ac
cepted by them upon a guaranty of its
execution the United States would en
deavor to find a way not objection
able to Spain of furnishing such guaranty.
' It should be added that it cannot be reasonably
assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude
of the United States will be indefinitely main
tained. While we are anxious to accord all
due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we
cannot view tbe pending conflict In all its
features, and properly apprehend our Inevita
ble relations to it and its possible results with
out considering that by tbe course of events
we may be drawn into such an unusual and
unprecedented condition as will fix a limit to
our patient waiting for Spain to end
tbe contest, either alone and in
her own way. or with our friendly co-operation.
When the inability of Spain to deal success
fully with the insurrection has become mani
fest and it is demonstrated that her sover
eignty Is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its
rightful existence, and when a hopeless strug
gle for Its re-establishment has degenerated
into a strife which means nothln? more than
the useless sacrifice of human life and then
utter d"tructlon of the very subject matter of
the confll t. a situation will be'preieitel In
$1.00 A YEAR
which our ohiigations to the sovereignty of
Spain will be superseded by higher obligations
which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and
discharge.
The Venezuelan Moundary Question.
The Venezuelan boundary question has
ceased to be a matter of difference between
Great Britain and tho United States, their re
spective governments having agreed upon the
substantial provisions of a treaty between
Oroat Britain and Venezuela, submitting the
whole controversy to arbitration. The provi
sions of the treaty are so eminently just and
fair that the assent of Venezuela thereto may
confidently be anticipated.
