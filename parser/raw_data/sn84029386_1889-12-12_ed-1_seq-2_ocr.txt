3U'S"iA is so vast and certain remote
corners of it are so utterly unknown to
most Ilussians themselves that the
most astounding facts are constantly
made known. It was supposed that
tleils were liberated in 1S61. But
that is an illusion which the journal,
1a Caspienne, has removed by saying
that the Government delays, for some
reason or other, the freeing of the Kal
mouk seifs attached to the estates of
the steppes. A proprietor has recently
been sent toSibcria for inflicting excep

A prominent freight man estimates
that there are 600,000 box cars in use
by the railroads ot the country. His
estimate is founded upon the fact that
there are about 150,000 mile of railroad
in the United States and at a moderate
average he estimates four freight cars
to each mile of track. The freight
cars, if placed in one solid tram, would
stretch across the continent from New
York to San Francibco. The average
of four cars to the mile is doubtless
low as some roads are known to have
many more. The Cincinnati, Hamil
ton & Dayton road, 300 milea long, has
ltf.OOO freight cars.

SALT TARIFFS.
The Kansas Railroad Commissioners Ad
just the Rates.
Topeka, Kan., Dec. S. The Rail
road Commissioners have rendered
their decision in the matter of the com
plaint of the Board of Trade and salt
producers of Kingman of unfair dis
crimination in railroad rates on salt
The Board, after reviewing the facts in
the case, say:
"We are of the opinion that the salt
tariffs to local points need revision in
the interest of all those concerned.
But this involves so many ad justments,
not only as it respects the salt interests,
but as well those that concern the car
riers, that its final consideration will be
entered upon at another time, and
further notice to parties in interest.
"Upon the complaint before us wo
find and decide that the rate on salt
from Kingman, Anthony and Welling
ton should be the same to all Missouri
river points as the rate on like com
modities from Hutchinson, Nickerson
and Sterling, and the board directs and
orders that such rates be made uniform
from all the points above named.
"The board also finds that the fuel
used in the manufacture of salt is slack
coal supplied from the coal mines of
Southeastern Kansas. The cost of this
per ton delivered at Wellington is $2.45,
and the freight rate is $1.70; at King
man, $2.65, and the freight rate $2; at
Anthony $2.75 per ton, and the freight
rate $2, and Hutchinson S2.40 per ton
and freight rate S1.S0. We think that
in justice to so important an industry
as the salt manufacture in this State a
concession should be made on these
rates as follows:
"Rate on coal slack to Wellington
$1.30 per ton and to all the other points
of salt manufacture in the State 51.50
per ton. And believing under existing
circumstances that these rates would
be fair and reasonable the board or
ders and directs that these rates on
coal slack, together with uniform rates
on salt to Missouri river points, be
adopted and made effective upon all
railroads operating to any of the points
named by December 15, 1SS9."

MONEY SAVED.
What the Missouri State Hoard Has Saved
to the People.
Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 8. Mr.
Downing, of the State Railroad Com
mission, says that a single decision of
the Commission rendered in a coal case
several months ago, in which this city
was interested, saves to the city $750,
000 a year. The figures weregiven him
by George 31. Nettleton, who is one of
the most thorough railroad ac
countants in the country. Ac
cording to the decision the
coal rate was reduced from 55 to 35
cents per ton. Mr. Downing claims
that the State Railroad Commissioners
have saved the people millions of dol
lars since the body was called into ex
istence. As to the effect of Missouri
river transportation upon freight rates
he was not prepared to talk, but
thought the importance of the enter
prise has been greatly overrated. lie
said if it saved to merchants $500,000 a
year it would be a grand success.

A THIEVING OFFICIAL.
The Cashier to the Sergeant-at-Arms of
the National House of Representatives
Absconds With 872,000 Probably Gone
to Join the Canadian Colony.
WASnuN'GTON, Dec. 6. From present
appearances Edward Silcott, cashier of
the sergeant-at-arms of the House of
Representatives, has fled, carrying off
$72,000 of the funds entrusted to his
care.
Silcott was a trusted man who came
here from Ohio, and was appointed by
Mr. Leedom when that gentleman as
sumed office six years ago. He had
good business qualifications and soon
possessed himself of the unlimited con
fidence of his superior.
Last Saturday he notified Mr. Leedom
that he was going to New York and
would be back Saturday night. A
message was received from him dated
New York Monday morning saying
that he had been detained but would
return Monday night. A similar mes
sage reached his wife in this city.
As he did not appear Tuesday Mr.
Leedom was fearful that he had been
overtaken by some accident, but to sat
isfy rising suspicions began an investi
gation. The information that Silcott
had drawn his bank balance deepened
the suspicions and the inquiry was
pursued. The enormous office safe
could not be opened at the moment, as
Silcott had the combination, but when
an entrance was finally effected it was
found that some $30,000, set apart for
the use of the paying teller was intact.
The next inquiry was made at the
Treasury Department and Mr. Leedom
was stunned by the result. He was in
formed that Silcott had called there
Saturday and had drawn about $72,000.
It was possible for him to draw this
large sum without exciting comment,
as lie had for a long time been charged
with the duty of collecting the money
with which the salaries of the Repre
sentatives aie paid.
Silcott is under bonds in the sum of
$50,000, his bondsmen numbering about
fifteen persons. This is, however, an
indemnity bond given to the sergeant-at-arms
and Mr. Leedom, who is him
self bonded in the sum of $50,000, is
directly responsible for the shortage.
Mr. Lc'edom says that he would have
trusted Silcott to any sum of money.
Mr. Leedom says that it was within
Silcott's powci to cany off not less than
$150,000 instead of the $72,000 which is
missing. It was suggested by a person
standing near that to have
carried off the balance would have
changed the nature of the crime from
embezzlement to theft and have sub
jected the perpetrator to extradition,
even in Canada, whither it is already
rumored the missing man has lied.
It is stated that Mr. Leedom was
victimized once before by the immedi
ate predecessor of Silcott, but to an
amount insignificant in comparison
with his present loss.
JEFFERSON DAVIS DEAD.
Death of the Noted Confederate Leader
Sketch of His Life.
New Orleans, Dec 6. Jefferson
David died at 12:45 o'clock this morn
ing at the residence of his friend, J. U.
Payne. From the beginning of his
fatal illnessMr. Da
vis had insisted that
his case was nearly
or quite hopeless,
though the dread of
pain or fearof death
never appeared to
take the slightest
hold upon his spir

brave and even
buoyant from the
beginning of his at
tack. In vain did
the doctors strive
to impress upon
JEFFERSON DAVIS.
him that his health was improv
ing. He steadily insisted that there
was no improvement, but with Chris
tian resignation he was content to ac
cept whatever Providence had in store
for him.
After death the face of the deceased,
though looking slightly emaciated,
showed no trace of suffering, more
nearly resembling that of a peaceful
sleeper than df the dead.

Einln Pasha Fatally Injured.
Zanzibar, Dec. 6. After enduring
the hardships of many years of resi
dence in the interior of Africa and the
fatigues and dangers of his journey to
the sea it has been the fate of Emin
Pasha to receive an injury which is
likely to result in his death. The
Pjisha is very nearsighted an habit
ually wears glasses. Yesterday he at
tempted to go about his room without
them and unconsciously walked out of
a window, falling some distance to the
ground, fracturing his skull and inflict
ing fatal injuries.
Internal Revenue Collections.
Washington, Dec 6. The total col
lections of internal revenue for the first
four months of the present fiscal year
were $46,7S3,350, an increase of $4,039,
364, as compared with the collections
during the corresponding period of last
year. The increase has averaged over
51,000,000 a month, and was principally
due to the increased consumption of
spirits, tobacco and fermented liquors.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Harrison's First Messoge
to Congress.
Our Cordial Foreign Relations Recom
mendations as to TarlETRevlsIon The
Sarplus, Pensions and Other
Matters Discussed.
Washtsoton, Dec. 4. The President's mes
sage was received in both hr.uses of Congress
yesterday at noon and is pi:ncipally as fol
lows: To the Senate and House of Iieprttentaticet:
Few transactions in the administration of
government are even temporarily held in
the confidence of those charged with the
conduct of public business. Every step
taken is under the observation of an intelli
gent and watchful people. The state of the
Union is known from day to day and sugges
tions as to needed legislation And nn earlier
voice than that which speaks in these an
nual communications of the President to
Congress.
Good will and cordiality have character
ized our relations and correspondence with
other Governments, and the year closed
leaves few international questions of impor
tance unadjusted. No obstacle is believed
to exist that can long postpone the consider
ation and adjustment of still pending ques
tions upon satisfactory and honorable terras.
The dealings of this Government with other
States have been marked by frankness and
sincerity, our purposes avowed and our
methods free from intrigue. This course
has borne rich fruit In the past, and it is our
dnty as a Nation to preserve the heritage of
good repute which a century of right dealing
with foreign Governments has secured to us.
It is a matter of sign ill cance and no less of
congratulations that tlio first year of the
second century of our constitutional exist
ence finds as honored guests within our bor
ders the representatives of all tiie independ
ent States of North and South America met
together in earnest conference touching tlio
best methods of perpetuating and expand
ing the relations of mutual interest and
friendliness existing among them. That
the opportunity thus afforded for pro
moting closer international relations and
the increased prosperity of the States repre
sented will be used for the mutual good of
all I can not permit myself to doubt. Our
people will await with interest and con
fidence the results to fiowfrom so auspicious
a meeting of allied and in largepart identical
interests.
Recommendations of this international
conference of enlightened statesmen will
have the attention of Congress and its co
operation in tiie removal of unnecessary bar
riers between the Nations of America. But
while the commercial results which it is
hoped will follow this conference are worthy
of praise and the great interest they have
excited, it is believed the crowning benefit
will be found in the better securities which
may be devised for the maintenance of peace
among all American Nations and settlement
of all contentions by methods Christian
civilization can npprove. While viewing
with interest our National resources and
products, the delegates, I am sure, will find a
higher satisfaction in the evidences of un
selfish friendship which everywhere attends
the intercourse with our people.
An international marine conference, hav
ing great possibilities for good, has lately
assembled and is now in session in this cap
ital. An invitation was extended by the Gov
ernment, under the aet of Congress of July
9, 1SSS, to all maritime nations to
send delegates to confer touching the
revision and amendment of the rules
and regulations governing vessels and to
adopt a uniform system of marine signals.
The. response to this invitation has been
very general and very cordial. Dele
gates from twenty-six Nations are
present in the conference and
they have entered upon their useful
work with great zeal and with an evident
appreciation of its Importance. So far as the
agreement to be reached may require legis
lation to give it effect the co-operation of Con
gress is confidently relied upon. It is an in
teresting and unprecedented fact that the
two international conferences have brought
here the accredited representatives of fihirty
three Nations. Bolivia, Ecuador and Hon
duras are now represented by resident en
voys of the plenipotentiary grade. All the
States of the American system now maintain
diplomatic relations at this capital.
KEIATIONS WITH CIIIN'.V.
Our relations with China have tho atten
tintive consideration which their magnitude
and interest demand. The failure of the
treaty negotiated under my predecessor for
the further and more complete restriction of
Chinese labor, immigration and with it the
legislation of the last session of Congress
dependent thereon leaves some questions
open which Congress should now approacli
in that wise and just spirit which should
characterize the relations of two great and
friendly powers, while oursupreme interests
demand the exclusion of a laboring element
which experience has shown to be incom
patible with our 'social life. All steps
to compass this Imperative need should
be accompanied with a recognition of the
claim of those strangers now lawfully among
us to humane and just treatment. The acces
sion of the young Emperor of China marks,
we may hope, an era of progress and pros
perity for the great country over which he is
called to rule.
SAMOAN APFAIIW.
Tho present state of affairs In respect to
the Samoan Islands Is encouraging. The
conference which was held in this
city in the summer of 1SS8 between
the representatives of tho UnitPd States,
Germany and Great Britain had been ad
journed because of the persistent divergence
of views which was developed in its delib
erations. The subsequent course of events in
the islands gave rise to questions of a seri
ous character. On the 4th of F'ruary last
the German Minister at this capital in behalf
of his Government proposed a resumption
of the conference at Berlin. Tills proposi
tion was accepted, as Congress in February
last was Informed. Pursuant to the under
standing thus reached commissioners were
appointed by tne, by and witli the advice and
consent of the Senate, who proceeded to Ber
lin and the conference was resumed. The
deliberations extended through several
weeks and resulted in the conclusion of a
treaty which will be submitted to the Senate
for its approval.
mtmsn affairs.
The questions which have arisen during
the past few years between Great Britain
and the United States are in abeyance or in
course of adjustment.
On the part of the Government of the Do
minion of Canala an effort has been ap
parent during the season just ended to ad
minister the laws and regulations applicable
to the fisheries with as little occasion for
friction as was possible, and the temperate
repressions of this Government In re
spect of cases of undue hardship or of harsh
representations have in most cases been met
with measures of transitory relief. It is
trusted that the attainment of our just rfghtit
under existing treaties and by virtue of the
concurrent legislation of the two contiguous
countries will uot be long delayed and that
all existing cause of differences may be
equitably adjusted.
OTHER FOHEIGS QUESTIONS.
The importance of the commerce of Cnba
and Porto KIco with the United States, their
nearest and principal market, Justifies the
expectation that the existing relations may
be beneficially expanded. The impediments
resulting from varying dues on navigation
and from the vexatious treatment of our ves
sels on merely technical grounds of com
plaints In West India ports, should be re
moved. The progress toward an adjustment of
pending claims between the United States
and Spain is not so rapid as could be desired.
Questions affecting American interests in
connection with railways constructed and
operated by our citizens in Peru have claimed
the attention of this Government. It is urged
that other Governments in pressing Peru to
the payment of their claims have disre
garded the property rights of American citi
zens. The matter will be carefully investi
gated with a view to securing a proper and
equitable adjustment.
A similar issue Is now pending with
Portugal. The Delagoa Bay railway in Africa
was constructed under a concession by
Portugal to an American citizen. "When
nearly completed tho road was seized by the
agents of the Portuguese Government. For
mal protest has been made through our
Minister at Lisbon against this act and no
proper effort will be spared to secure proper
relief.
In pursuance of the charter granted by
Congress and under the terms of Its contract
with the Government of Nicaragua the Inter-Oceanic
Canal Company has begun the
construction of the Important water way be
:weer the two oceans.
Tho traditional good feeling between this
country and the French Eepnblie has re
ceived additional testimony in the participa
tion of onr Government and people in the
International F-xposItion held at Paris dur
ing tho past summer. The success of our
exhibitors has been gratifying. The report
of tho Commission will be laid before Con
gress in due season.
With Germany the most cordial relations
exist. The questions arising from the return
to the Empire of Germans naturalized In this
country are considered ixnd disposed of in s
tempcrate spirit to tho entire satisfaction of
both Governments.
A mixed commission is now In session In
this capital for settlement of long-standing:
claims against tho Republic of Venezuela,,
and it is hoped that a satisfactory conclusion
will be speedily reached.
Questions continue to arise at ourrelations
with seTeral countries in respect to the
rights of naturalized citizens. Especially is
this the case with France, Italy, Russia,
and Turkey and to a less extent with Switzer
land. From time to time earnest efforts have-
been made to regulate this subject by con
ventions. An Improper use of naturallzatioir
should not be permitted, but it is important
that those who have been duly naturalized
should everywhere be accorded recognition
of the rights pertaining to citizenship ot the
country of'their adoption. The appropria
tions of special conventions for that purpose
is recognized in treaties which this Govern
ment has concluded with a number of Euro
pean States, and it is advisable that the diffi
culties which now arise in our relations with
other countries on the same subject should
be similarly adjusted.
The recent revolution in Brazil In favor of
the establishment of a republican form of
government Is an event of great interest to.
the United States. Our Minister at Rio
Janeiro was at once instructed to maintain
friendly diplomatic relations with the Pro
visional Government and tho Brazilian
representatives at tho capital were instruct
ed by the Provisional Government to con
tinue their functions. Our friendly inter
course with Brazil has therefore suffered no
interruption. Our Minister has been further
instructed to extend on the part of this
Government a formal and cordial recogni
tion of tho new republic so soon as Wto
majority of the people of Brazil shall have
signified their assent to its establishment
and maintenance.
Home Matters.
Within our own borders a general condi
tion of prosperity prevails. The harvests of
the last summer were exceptionally abun
dant and the trade conditions now prevail
ing seem to promise a successful season to
the merchant and the manufacturer and gen
eral employment to our working people.
the TKEAsnirr.
Tho report of the Secretary of the Treasury
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1SS3, has
been prepared and will be presented to Con
gress with the fiscal operations of the Gov
ernment, and I avail myself of it to obtain
some facts for use here. Tho aggregate re
ceipts from all sources ftf the year were
WS7,030,as.S4. It was derived as follow : From
customs, Rr.B,5.r7il.G3; from internal reve
nue, $mjSS2li&l; from miscellaneous
sources, .:,3J3,S0.5.23.
The ordinary expenditures for the same
period were faiJSXfilo.m, and the total ex
penditures. Including the sinking fund, were
$3.9,5;'J4).t.23. Thu excess of receipts over
expenditures was, nfter providing for tiie
sinking fund. $37,470,129.39. For the current
fiscal year the total revenues, actual and
estimated, are $.5S5,O0O,O0O, and the ordinury
expenditures, actual and estimated, are
$.1U,000,000, making, witli the sinking fund, a
totnl expenditure of Ul,321,lli.!0, leaving an
estimated surplus of $4.l,G7H,SSI.01.
During tiie fiscal year there was applied to
the purchase of bonds, in addition to these,
for the sinking fund $90,436,172.33, and during
the first quarter of the current year the sum
of $:;7,S3S,M7.77, all of which was credited to
the sinking fund.
The revenue) for tho fiscal year ending
June 30, l-yi, are estimated by the treasury
department at $JS3,000,(00, and the expendi
tures for the same period, including the
sinking fund, at $3U,4.!0,477.70. This shows
an estimated surplus for that year of $4J,
3CU,3J?.30; which is more likely to be increased
than reduced when the actual transactions
are written up.
the srurnus.
The existence of so large an actual and an
ticipated surplus should havo the immedi
ate attention of Congress witli a view to re
ducing the receipts of the treasury to the
needs of the Government as closely as may
be. The collection of moneys not needed for
public uses imposes an unnecessary bdnlen
upon our people and the presence of so largt
a surplus In the public vaults is a disturbing
element in the conduct of private business.
It has railed into use expedients forputtimr
it into circulation of very questionably pro
priety. We should not collect revenue for
the purpose of anticipating our bonds be
yond the requirement of the sinking fund,
but any unappropriated surplus in the treas
ury should be so used, as there is no other
lawful way of returning the money to cir
culation, and the profit realized by the Gov
ernment offers a substantial advantage.
The loaning of public funds to the bank
without interest, upon tlXs security or Gov
crnment bonds, I regard as an unauthorized
and dangerous expedient. It results in a
temporary and unnatural Increase of the
banking capital of favored localities and
compels a cautious and gradual reeall of the
deposits to avoid injury to tho commercial
interests. It is not to be expected that the
banks having these deposits will sell their
bonds to the treasury so long as the present
highly beneficial arrangement is continued.
They now practically get Interest both
upon the bonds and their proceeds.
No further use should bo made of
this method of getting the surplus.
Into circulation, and the deposits now out
standing should be gradually withdrawn
and applied to the purchase of bonds. It is
fortunate that such use can be made of
the existing surplus, and for some time to
come of any casual surplus that may exi-t
after Congress has taken the necessary step
for it reduction of the revenue. Such legis
lation should be promptly but very consid
erately enacted.
TnE TARIFF.
I recommend a revision of our tariff law,
both in its administrative features and In
the schedule. Tho need of the former I
generally conceded, and an agreement upon
the evils and inconveniences to be remedied
and tne best methods for their correction
will probably not be difficult. Uniformity
of valuation at all our ports U essential, and
effective measures .should bo taken to secure
it. It is equally desirable that questions
affecting ratci and classifications should bo
promptly decided.
The preparation of a new schedule of cus
tom duties Is a matter of great delicacy, be
cause of its effect upon the business
of the country; of great difficulty, by
reason of the wide divergence of opinion
as to the objects that may be promoted by
such legislation. Some disturbance of busi
ness may perhaps result from consideration
of this subject by Congress, bnt this tempo
rary ill -effect will be reduced to a minimum,
by prompt action, and the assurance which
the country enjoys that any necessary
changes will be so made as not to impair
the Just and reasonable protection of our
home industries. The Ineqalities of the law
should be adjusted, but the protective prin
ciple should be maintained and fairly ap
plied to the products of our farms as well aa
of our shops. These duties necessarily havo
relation to other things besides public rev
enues. We can not limit their effects by fix
ing our eyes on the public treasury alone.
They have a direct relation to home produc
tion, to work, to wages and to the commer
cial independence of our country, and the
wise and patriotic legislator should enlarge
the field of his vision to include all of these.
The necessary reduction in our public rev
enues can, I am sure, be made without mak
ing the smaller burden more onerous thau
the larger by reason of the disabities and
limitations which the process of reduction
puts upon both capital and labor. The free
list can very safely be extended by placing
thereon articles that do no; offer injurious
competition to such domestic products as
our home labor can supply. The removal of
the internal tax upon tobacco would relieve
an Important agricultural product from o
burden which was Imposed only because our
revenue from custom datiea was insufficient
for the public needs.
If safe provision can be devised, the re
moval of the tax upon spirits used In the
arts and manufactures would offer an un
objectionable method of reducing the sur
plus. the cntccuMOir.
A table presented by the Secretary of the
Treasury showing the amount of money o
all kinds In circulation each year from 1378 U
the present time is of interest It appear
that the amount of National banknotes Is
circulation has decreased during that period
$114409,729, of which $37,799,223 Is chargeable to
the lost year.
The withdrawal of bank circulation will
necessarily continne under existing condi
tions. It Is probable the adoption ot th'
aggeations made by the ComptroUr, Tif
