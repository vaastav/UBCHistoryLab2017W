UnprecedentedAttack on the Ameri^can Socialist Party by Immac^^ulate Leader of Smart Set
'a pi fa I mm triumphant has spoken,^fttrenuosity ha^ pawed down the drop^pinga of its benevolence and wiadom^to tall the ^governed^ what to do.^The president 'a message representa the^frantic and futile attempts of the re^^gime of a decaying class to stay the^tide of its rapidly ebbing degenera^^tion. An ancient regime grabs at any^straw to keep itself afloat. It becomes^^liberal,^ ^|^opular^, promises any^^thing. Koosevelt is the incarnation of^a decadent ideal. His mouthings are^empty and silly to the philosophic and^scientific mind. They are opposed to^the positions of modern scholarship on^economics, social customs, labor, and^to all ideas of individual justice taken^out of its artificial and unjust class^netting He talks of peace and is the^most beastly promoter of war. He^babbles of justice and yet takes every^means of showing that he means it^only for his class^the rich, the idle,^the supercilliouM, the useless, the lilies^of the hot house, that toil not, neither^do they spin, and yet Solomon in all^bis glory was never arrayed like one^of them.
ProsperityRacket.
Hissalaams uro paid to the ^un^^precedented prosperity^ fetish. The^republicans must prostrate themselves^before the gods of their household be^^fore they can make the gullible public^take them seriously; and ^prosperity^^is the chief totem of the republicans^^prosperity for the wealth takers, not^the wealth milkers. The only little^dark cloud on the horizon is ^ reck-^fnliric is built on this ^reckjess^speculation^. Mr. (lallery-Player, and^fabric is built on this ^reckless spec^^ulation^. Mr. Callery-Player, and^there is no such thing as legitimate
businessmethods. The best ^busi^^ness^ is the beat robbery, thievery,^and unscrupulousneaa.
CorporationCampaigns
Ofcourse there's a lot of sense in pro^^hibiting corporations from contributing^to political campaigns. What differ^^ence does it make whether Mr. Rocke^^feller elects his government henchmen^to make laws for his companies from^money labeled John D., or Standard^Oil. Buch hypocrisy ought to disqual^ify a man from any position of public^trust
KeepInjunctions.
In the injunction section he goes^over the old palaver of calling all^strikers criminals, promoters of de^^struction to life and property and
''mob violence.'' Legislation to abol^^ish injunctions would be ineffective be^^cause it wouldn't stand the test of the^courts. Of course if the courts say^we can't do anything it's foolish to^talk about the people governing them^^selves in the way they want to. And^the just ami righteous judge (who is^such of course, or he would not have^been elected) must be careful that^there shall l^e no ^violence,^ ^intimi^^dation,^ or ^conspiracy.^ He means^on the part of the working men. The^violence, intimidation and conspiracies^of the villainous mine owners' associa^^tion have never troubled Theodore's^unruffled placidity.
Thewuhle passage, like the reat^of the message, wherever a chaneo^occurs, is an insult to organized labor.^The ways of the ^laboring men ^ must^be ^peaceful and lawful^^nothing^about employers being ^peaceful and^lawful^; oh, no^they make the laws.
Theconsistent Teddy exalts the^judgeship to omnipotence. ^The judge^has a power over which no review can^bo exercised.^ Oh, democraev, thou
LatestElection Returns.
ArizonaReport from twelve coun^^ties show a vote of 2,223. 1994, 1,304.
CaliforniaReturns are meager, but^show a thirty per cent decrease from^the Debs vote. The probable vote is^about 19,000.
ColoradoThe vote for Haywood for^governor was 16,192. In many places^the socialists were beaten out of their^votes by fraud, and are in possession^of an abundance of facts to warrant^the statement. Considering that they^went into the campaign with paretical-^ly no organization, the results may be^regarded as gratifying, all things be^^ing considered.
IdahoThe vote was about tl,000, be^^ing an increase of more than 1,000^votes.

PennsylvaniaThe vote of the so^^cialist party in this state average*
about16.000 as shown by the official^returns, while the opinion expressed by^socialists is that such a showing is^out of all reason and that the vote^was tampered with in the counties be^^fore retunrs were sent in.

Union Sentinel.
Oneof the most surprising facts in^connection with the growth of social^^ism is the information from a student^in the College in the city of New York^to the effect that a majority of the^.1,000 scholars in that institution are so^^cialists. It is stated that 9.1 per cent^^^f the scholars, whose ages range from^HI to 2H years, are Jews, native and^foreign born. The one live topic among^the students is socialism. There art) a^number of clubs in existence and^books, papers and pamphlets are widely^circulated. Many of the moat active^workers in the New York aocialiat^movement were students of the college.
artbut a vanished vision! The cream^of the whole matter though is the ' care^^fully guarded^ admission that the^^common people^ might possibly cri^^ticize a judge, if they did it ^temper^^ately, '' but not as ' unworthy agita^^tors.^ Socialists, stand bark, You^are agitators. You agitate Teddy and^his gang of parasites. We'll agitate^the whole social fabric on which they^stand, and they'll all come down with^the rest of the debris. He don't like^that; and he has cause not to. The^very idea that he would dare to insult^the American people by presuming to^say anything about he way they criti^^cize shows that he has forgotten that^he is a servant and not a monitor.^Bluffl on Lynching*
Hemakes a big blow about lawless^^ness and lynching, but lie never under^^takes to establish t^nited States gov^^ernment in the south. With his whole^army and navy it never occurs to him^that he can restore or^^er there. The^reasonf Because the entire capitalist^^ l.ii. north and south, have the mu^^tual interest of keeping the working^class in subjection. The form is some^^what different in the south, but they^all ^wink the other eye,^ and then^talk piously about the ^square deal.^^Yes, the blacks ought to love Teddy.^He ate with one of their half-black^meo once.
Warningto the Working Class.
Thesection on capital and labor^though caps the climax in its threat^^ening attitude towards the rising sense^of power in the working class. The^master monitor starts out with a warn^^ing against the ^preachers of discon^^tent.^ Oh, yes. be contented. If^you're dying. starving, rotting. be^contented. ^A thinking peasant^makes a quaking throne.^ Teddy and^his class don't care To have this feel^^ing of insecurity. He talks about the^^men who seek to incite a violent^class hatred against all men of^wealth,^ about their opposing ^wi*e^and proper movements,^ hysterical^campaign*,^ ^linflaming Ko madness^the brutal passions of mankind,^ ^sin-^; inter demagogues, and foolish vision^juries,^ who ^ masifnerade as reform^I ers. ^ He says these people may have^a ^temporary political success,^ con^^demns the ^agitator^ again, and la^bels the agitation ^squalid anarchy.^^He devotes one whole paragraph to^^Beware of the Agitator!^ tries to^pat the ^dear, plain people who love^their country,^ on the head, hyster^^ically shrieks against all hysteria, and
goeshitmvulsions that would make
acynic smile.
Thereis no question that the whole^undignified tirade refers to the social^^ists; not because any sane man would^find them guilty of nil the nameless^crimes he ascribes to this formidable^and nameless outfit, but because thev^are the only opposers of present forms^of government that aspire to, and have^acquired iiny political iiroininonce.^Moreover, the president's misplaced^oiliciousucss in sending Root to New^York to offset the Hearst boom, and^Taft to Idaho to squench nny senti^^ment in regard to the Western feder^^ation officials that might crop out, al^^lows no possihiltiy of misapprehension^ns to his attitude towards the new^political tide that is rising to sweep^him and his kind into oblivion. He^is too cowardly to come out and say^what he means and takes this under^^hand way of attacking what Is now^the third political party of the country.^Through the entire message the same^sinister note runs. What does it pre^^sage^ Does Roosevelt think to recom^^mit the Rismnrckian follyf Will the^American government dare to tamper^with the shoaj* of repression^ No^^thing would more unify Amorlenn so^^cialism. In the meanwhile other gov^^ernments look on his temerity with^amusement. The London News states
tint^the president seems to be wrestl*^ing with forces he comprehends, but^cannot control.^ The Daily Expreas^says that in England and America the^main currents of the national life are^sweeping forward in the struggle of^nationalism against anti-nationalism,^and of the state against socialism.^Roosevelt rushes at the new foe Don^(Quixote-like. But as one mine man^^ager said to his superintendent ^Don't^fire the socialists; they'll be here when^we are both dead and gone.^ What^else could be expected though of the^man Friday of capitalismf He does^the stunt his masters set him.^Eight Hour Law^In a moderate and qualified endorse^^ment of the eight hour law he takes^pains to discriminate ^against com^^munities like the tropics where the^people are not far enough advanced^fur eight hours' work to be for their^good. ^ Of course because a man is^weak and ignorant that is all the more^reason he should be imposed on.^S^piare deal, truly.
ChildLabor.^In M labor comes in for the usual^veneering, but the matter must be left^to the individual states. We know^about what the southern states will do^with child labor. Profits, profits^chil^^dren are of infinitely less consequence^t.i capitalism.
CoalLands.
Thewithdrawing of the coal lands^from public settlement, while operat^^ing immediately to the interest of the^big companies, will eventually end in^facilitating the socialist program.^With the coal lands in the hands of^the government, when the socialists^own the government there need be no^waste time talking about how to ex-^| ropriate the private owner.
Bustthe Trusts.
Thecorporation regulating talk is^so nauseous to a serious thinker, to^one who understands the principle of^business combinations that it is need^^less to waste spare on this infantile^hypocrisy.
IndustrialTraining.
Inthe recommendation for indus^^trial and technical training Mr. Roose^^velt is striking at the heart of the ap^^prentice system in the skilled crafts,^and through that at the invulnerabil^^ity of the trade unions. The school^^room . raftsman, the ^white shirt^mcchauir.^ will overflow from the^doorways of educational institutions^lie will be the ^hern scab^ that will^multiply the fierce competition among^the workers for jobs, cheapen labor for^the capitalist. ami eventually break^down the defenses of trade organiza^tion. The ^school for the trade^ will^be the proper wny to lenm it in the^fair days under socialism. Till then^it will increase the misery and the^helplessness of Inbor. Well, so it^comes to its final revolt. The mills^of the gods grind slowly.
Marriageand Divorce.
Of course it wouldn't lie Rosy if^he didn't stick his finger into every^^thing, including people's domestic af^fairs. Think of making congress mar^^ry and divorce people. That is nbout^ski limit of crushing out individualitv^in the place of places where it should^reign pre eminent. Talk about social^ism destroying individuality; if peopli^cannot have it in regard to the natural^instincts of mnting it will be dead in^the human race. There is the now far^famed Roosevelt ian command to in^crense nnd multiply. You working class^mother bowed with anxiety over every^meal will doubtless hear this with edi^flcation. But then it is economies thnt^run the world, nnd not Roosevelt, only^he doesn't know this yet. He is but^the spokesmnn of the Interests of tho^ruling clnss. Whnt will tighten their^power more firmly on those that slave^for them, he tries to incorporate In^government.
EMISSARIESOF CRIME
Attackthe Only City Administration^in Montana That Upholds the^State Gambling Law
Oneof the most dastardly and brutal^assaults ever committed in the state^was perpetrated Monday evening, Dec.^3, upon Comrade Austin, the mayor of^Red Lodge, the county seat of Carbon^county. The villainous deed was com-^mited about 8 o'clock, in the dark^^ness of the winter night. The assail^^ants were two brothers-in-law, Paddy^Doran and Lewis Thomas, who were^accused lately of running a gambling^game in the saloon of the former, and^brought to justice by his honor, the^mayor. Mayor Austin, as was his cus^^tom, had closed his barbershop for^the evening, and was walking up the^street in the direction of the Red^Lodge state bank. At this corner the^thugs accosted him. shoved him off^into a side street, knocked him down,^beat him unmercifully, kicked him in^the face, forehead and sides, stamping^and disfiguring him and otherwise in^^juring him seriously by crushing in^his ribs. Had it not been for the^fact hat some hoys happened to make^their appearance on the street a bloody^crime would have undoubtedly been
ommittedas the murderous intentions^of the attempted assissins were plainly^demonstrated. When Dafsp discov^^ered that the boys were watching him^he became frightened and fled. The^mayor struggled to his feet, and suc^^ceeding in breaking loose from his^remaining would he slayer, ran down^the street calling for the marshal. He^was followed by Thomas, and Night^Policeman Youngholter running to the^NM uttempted the arrest of the inur^d,Tons criminal which wn^ vigtiruiisjv^resisted till Sin-riff Potter came, when^the thug was taken to jail. Tlause
ofthe heinous attack waa the policy^adopted by Mayor Austin in enforcing^the state gambling law. In pursuance
ofthis determined purpose of the so^^cialists laat July Mayor Austin had^Dorau arrested. He was convicted of^the violation of the law, and fined a^hundred dollars in the justice court for^disturbing the peace. Doran was ar^^rested with Thomas and jailed. The^next morning a warrant charging third^degree assault was issued against both^men by Judge Lucas' court. To show^the grit that resides in the breaata^of those that have the guardinsship^of the interests of the proletariat,^though suffering severely from bis in-^injuries, the next morning Mayor Au^^stin served the saloon firm of Mi tiara^^ Doran with a notice revoking their^saloon license, whereupon Doran sold^out his interest U^ Miliars At 6^o'clock in the evening ^'omrade Austin^summoned the chief of police, and de^^manded the keys to the saloon. On^being refused lie ordered the doors^nailed up by the officers.
Suchis another chapter in the his^^tory the socialists are making in the^struggle for justice and decency. Red^Lodge is the only town in Montana^where an attempt is made to enforce^the law against gambling. Every she^^riff ami oflieinl entrusted with its en^^forcement in every other county and^city in the state is using it as a means^of blackmailing the gambler*: and^the corrupt and vitiating fcritne ia^as nourishing as before any legisla^^tion was passed.
Thekissing bug of eastern Mon^^tana, otherwise known as the Carbon^founty Republican, is silent in regarl^to the diabolical conspiracy, thus sig^^nifying its approval of the crime.
FinnishSocialists.
ANational convention of the Fin^^nish socialists was held at llibhing,^Minn.. Aug. 5th.
Onthe question of closer alliance,^they took certain action and offered^suggestions which are herewith report^^ed for your consideration:
Theproposition of the National Fin^^nish Socialist convention was to the!^following effect:
Thata National translator's office^be established in Chicago, with the ob-'^Met of getting in closer connection^with the American movement, and a^National Party office.
Onmatters of importance to their^organization, not on conflict with the^National Party platform, or policy, re^^ferendum shall be bandied by the^i ranslator's office.
Thetranslator is to maintain a cor^^respondence office between state sec^^retaries and the Finnish locals in the^respective states, and in like manner^between the National office and all^Pinnish locals.
ThoFinnish organization through^the translator's office is to direct agi^^tation in connection with a general^propaganda committee, already chosen,^composedof one member for each five^locals, in any state
TheNation hns been divided into^three districts: Eastern, Central and^Western. The members of said prop^^aganda committee, constitute, accord
ingto their localities the District Prop^^aganda committee.
Thereare at present about 7^^ Fin^^nish locals, with an est in,ate.I momlier-^ship of about .'t.OHi located ns follows:^Michigan. 12: Minnesota, b^; Massa^^chusetts, 14; Ohio. 2; Pennsylvania, 2;^Wisconsin, li; and scattering 22. Ia^Michigan, the Finnish cumades in point^of numbers, predominate, and in Min^^nesota they represent one half or near^^ly one-half of the membership.

Itis estimated that one fourth of the^entire apple crop of Illinois has been^permitted to rot upon the ground this^year.
