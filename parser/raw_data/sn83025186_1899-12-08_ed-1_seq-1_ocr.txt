GEORGIA DISFRANCHISE
MUST BILL DEFLATED
Last week the Hardwick Bill
which wfas introduced to disfranchise
the Negroes of Georgia, met its just
defeat at the hands of the Georgia
Legislators, by a vote of
137
igainst
and only 3 for it. Tnis act alone is
commendable, and to meet su
overwhelming defeat shows that there
are yet some concientious good
white men of the Sunny South.
Those redeeming features and signs
of justice coming to us away up
North is indeed very consoling to uf,
and we may yet sing with a universal
spirit, "M Country 'Tis of Thee
Sweet Land of Liberty", but when
we reflect and think, the first gover
nor of Georgia during the Colonal
period, that much beloved James
Oglethrope opposed slav ry and the
slave trade and would not tolerate it,
and many years after he left Georgia
slavery was prohibited. We con
gratulate the Georgia legislature for
taking such a bold stand, also much
credit must be given the leading
colored men and colo-ed newspapers
for their effective work, epecially
Col. J. H. Deveaux, and Col. Piedg
er, who worked hard both night and
day. Below is a copy of the bill:
"The Hardwick bill provided that no
person should be a competent voter un
less he Was able to read and write any
paragraph of the Constitution of this
State to understand any paragraph of
such Constitution, and to give a rea
sonable interpre atiou thereof provid
ed, however 'hat no male person who
was on January 1. 1SG7 or at any time
prior thereto, entitled to vote under
the laws of the State wherein he then
resided, and no lineal descendant of
such person, bd denied the right to
register and vote at any election in this
State, by reason of his failure to pos
sess the educational qualifications re.
quired therefor."
The defeat of this bill with the de-
company the order, nor ..

PRES1DENTS MESS A GE.
As required by law President Mc
Kinley submitted his annual message
last Tuesday morning to the fir&t
session of the 56th U. S. Congress.
was a very lengthy jnd in many
lespects quite interesting, it was
longer perhaps than most of ihe
former documents, ^et when re
flect and think of the newly acquired
territory and the relations that the
islands of Cuba and Philippines sus
tains to us, it would necessarily have
to be longer than the or ry mes
sage. He takes up and deals in a
clear statesmanlike manner the ques
tion of the Philippines, slating that
every effort is made to preserve
peace in the island, and that the
future of the islands rest with Con
gress, which is urged to act prompt
ly. Of Cuba he says that the pledge
ot Independence is one to be sacred
ly,kept by the U. S. Than he takes
up a deal with each logically, Porto
Rico, Hawaii, Samoa, Currency,
Trusts, Boer war, Foreign relations,
English relations, German relations,
Lynching of Italians, Spain, Turkey,
Japan, Chinese affairs," Mexico,
Nicarague canal, Reciprocity treaty,
Peace conference, Paris Exposition,
MerchKnt marine, Volunteers, Reg
ular army, Pensions, Postal services,
rsavy, Agricultural, Alaska Civil
service, Treasury surplus, which is
40,00,000 for this year. He also
takes up that which is very imp r
tant to our race the lynching ques
tion. He takts a strong stand
against lynch law in the following
words:
"The love of law and the sense of obe
dience and Submission to the lawfullv
constituted judical it ibunals are embi
ed id the hearts of our people, and any
violation of the sentiments aud disre
gard of their obligations Justly aroust
public condemnation. The guarantees
of life, liberty and of civil rights should
bj faithfully upheld the right of trial
by jury respected and defended. Ttic
r»f Ihrt, pr.nrfK fchnii l/l
public of the prompt trial of
charge with criminal offenses, and up
on cottvii tion the punishment should be
commensurate wiih the enormity of ttie
crime.
Those who, in disregard of law and
the public- peace, uuwilling to await
the judgment of court and jury, cons
titute themselves judges aud execution
ers should not escape the severest peu
alties for their crimes."
What I said in my inaugural address
of March
4, 18(J7.
I now tepeat:
"The constituted authorities should
be cheerfully and vigorously upheld.
^Lynchings must not be tolerated in a
gre.it and civilized country liUe the
United States. Courts, not mobs, must
execute tue penalties of the laws. The
pi eservation of public order, the right
of discussion, the integrity of courts
aud orderly administration of justice
must continue forever the rock of safe
ty upon which ourgovernment securely
rests."
