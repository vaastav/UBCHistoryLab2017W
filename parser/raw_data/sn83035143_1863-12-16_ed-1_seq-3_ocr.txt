mould and direct the fiction-reading of the

gularly prolific authoress. The book now be
fore as li characteristic of her. True, we
have no bigamy, nor even murder in it, but
there it enough of crime, dark intrigue, and
complex plot and counterplot to stock a half
dozen modern fictions. Mist Brad ion be
longs eminently to the sensational tchool of
novelist. Exeitement-seekers will always
find food for their paction in her melodra

in a fearfully large stock of orime and an

ing books that sell, and her readers are, to
day, more numerous than those of Thackeray.

A Fcsst Scesi. Yesterday, as a stal
wart fellow was plodding hit way across the
Square, he met a lady rigged in a orinoline
of fabulous dimensions. In endeavoring to
pass her, his foot caught in the iron-work
of the aforesaid orinoline, whioh tripped him
up and pitched him headforemost abaut tea
feet upon his hands and knees, at the same
ma whirling her of the crinoline three-
fourths around. The woman commenced a
voluble scolding at the luckiest wight, and
he replied by giving her a broadside of very
profane ejaculations. It was decidedly fun
ny, to say the least, to the bystanders.

SPECIAL DISPATCHES.
FROM WASHINGTON.
Committee of the Union League
Waits on the President.
They Demand the Removal of
Blair, Bates, Halleck and
Schofield.
[To the Cincinnati Gazette.]
WASHINGTON, December 14.
'
of
be
of
Within a few dare after General Bose-
orans sad been removed from the com
mand of the Arm? of the Cumberland,
Seoretary Chaso, Governor Denni.on, and
other prominent men, mainly from Ohio,
urged upon the President the policy of re
moving (teneral rJchoneld from the com
mand of the Department of Missouri, and
the appointment of General Rosecrane in
bis stead, and represented the importanoe
of doing this before the Missouri election.
The President, however, refused to listen
to the appeals for the removal of Schefiold,
and decided to ignore the demand of the
Missouri Radical, and retain him. Go the
matter stood until the recent meetin g of
the Loyal League National Council. This
body appointed a committee, consisting of
John Covode, James M. Ashley and ex-
Uovernor Boutwell to present to the Pres
ident objeotions to his course, and nrge
upon him the speedy removal of Haileck,
Blair and Bates here, and of Bhcofleld in
Missouri, and to represent that the loyal
sentiment of the country considered
he had made a grave mistake in not sus
taining the Radicals. This representation
produced a marked effect, ft was easy for
i he President to maintain the position he
had chosen to take against a delegation
from a single State, and representing as
he considered, only a fraction of that
State ; but thii Committee had a most
potential voice, and spoke with an author
ity to which Mr. Linooln, in his present
circumstances, deemed it the better polioy
to yield. 8enator Grata Brown was
speedily sent for, and as the result of an
interview with him and the Leyal League
Committee, an order was at onoe trans
mitted directing General Schofleld to re
port at Washington in perron. Meantime
the President arked the Missourians how
they would like General Roseorans as
commander of iheD -par.mentif a change
were made, and the reply was that the
appointment would be entirely satisfacto
ry. The affair, of oourse, will remain in
this shape until Schofield comes. Com
plaints have been made from Kansas
against him, whioh amount to charges.
When he comes here the President will
confront him with his accusers.
If General Schofleld should bs removed
and General Roseorans made his snciessov,
the appointment or the latter otticer will
be by the President direct, and in spite of
he determined hostility of the War De
partment and the General-in-Chiei. This
hostility, however, begins to be somewhat
less bitter than it was a month ago.
The statement that the Kidicala in Mis
souri, or their Representatives here, for
any grounds, favored the confirmation cf
General Sihcfleld, is unfounded. The par
agraph to that effect wa interpolated in
these dispatches without the knowledge of
your regular correspondent.
mere is a general expression of satis
faction at the oast of the Committees of
the House. While they are of unusuil
strength, it is noticed in most coses that
there -ia a peculiar aptitude in the men ap
pointed for the respective places. Thus
the Military Committee contains two Major
and two Brigadier-Generals who have seen
much native service in the field. The Com
mittee on Agriculture is headed by Brutns
J. Clay, perhaps the most noted practical
rarmer in the nest. Ihe Committee on
Patents is headed by a noted Rhode Island
patent lawyer. The Committee on Manu-
r.3tttTCW I." keadeA -r ri&pyl V nnKnail
for many years a practical civil engineer.
Many similar illustrations might be se
lected. The Democrats make no complaint
of their treatment. Mr. Pendletou, who
was last year on the J udioiary, wrs raised
to the Ways and Means, the moat import
ant place any Democrat in the House could
have under an Admiuistration organiza
tion. Cox retains his old place.
The Committees were duly announced
in both Houses to-dry, whereupon an im
mense number of bills and resolutions
were introduced. The West came in for a
large proportion of them.
John W. C. Home, of Kentucky, filed his
papers to day before the new Committee
on elections, contesting the seat of Teoman,
the present Representative.
The Missouri radicals are making anoth
er pressure on the President for the re
moval of Schofield. It is not believed thoy
will succeed,
The Conscription Law was proposed to
be amended by bills, to day, as follows :
Repeal of the $100 olause, and exemption
of all clergymen from liability to military
service.
Senator Hale's bill,, introduced to abol
ish slavery, provides that hereafter all
parsons within the United Stales are equal
in the eyes of the law, and all claims to
persona service, except these founded on
contract and claim of parent to minor
guild, and sentence for punishment of
crime shall be forever abolished, any thing
in the constitution and laws of any State
to the contrary notwithstanding.
Senator Wilkinson proposed in Senate
to-day, to extend the benefit of the pen
eion law of last year to sufferers by the
massacres in Miesouri.
The new bounty bill for the army, be
fore the Senate Committee oa Military Af
fairs, proposes the payment of four hun
dred dollars to those who have served nine
months, and those who have yet another
year to serve; and to all ether persons
three hundred dollars, lwenty-nve dol
lara premium is then paid for the enlist
ment of eacn veteran volunteer, ana ni-
teen dollars for every other volunteer,
Seventy millions of dollars is appropria
ted for these bounties.
Ihe pay of non-commissioned officers
and privates is fixed as follows, per month:
All cavalry uaartermaster Sergeants and
Sergeant Majors, 3.T6: Sergeants or in
fantry, artillery and cavalry, $20; First
8ergeant of same, $43; privates, first class,
fit; second class, 10.
This bill puts negro soldiers, who nave
been, or may be enliBted, on eracily the
same looting, us every reetteot, bus wiuk
troops.
All apportionments for the draft are to
be made for wards, counties, Suites, Ad.,
on the basis of those liable to do military
duty.
A select committee of ntne will pe an
nounced, to-morrew, in the House, on a
Uureait of umaneipauon.
It is learned that r rank Blair will be
here in a few days ; whether to take his
eeat in the House is not kno-rn.
It is stated that W. K. Sebastian, of Ar
kansas, who never seceded nor resigned
hi seat in the Senate, is on his vay her. ta

this re-admission will be decided. ' He

referred to the appropriate committees.
air. i-ane, of Indiana, introduced a bill
to amend the act entitled an act to define
and punish conspiracies, passed July 31st,
1861. Also the 24thBeotion of the act for
enrolling and calling out the national
lorees, passed JlarchiJJ, 1863.
air. Hendricks introdnoed a bill to ex
tend the time in which States may avail
themselves of the grant of land for Agri
cultural and Industrial Colleges.
Davis, of Kentucky, called un the res
olutions in relation to the exchange of pris
oners, arguing vehemently against the
policy of refusing to exchange our euf
feriug white soldiers the languishing,
starving, diseased white, because ths reb
els refuse to exchange the negro captives.
ne oenouncca, at length, the policy of
the Administra'ion noon the several points
t wmca me negro is unectej, uu.r.v..
ing its position as monstrous, and re
ferring to the present era as the reign of
Abraham I. He avowed that his own
loyalty was unspotted, that he hated with
undying vigor the crime of secession.
It was evident that this polioy was only
part of that design to perpetuate the
party power of the Administration. He
closed with an indignant and earneet pro
test against the refusal or the Adminis
tration to liberate thousands of starving
and dying white men for the sake of a few
negroes.
Mr. Johnson deemed it perfectly clear
that humanity, which is the highest polity,
demands the continuance of the exchange
of prisoners. He prooeeded to combat the
opinion of the Senator from Kentucky,
Davis, that these men should not be protect
ed; corrected his views of the power of
the President by quoting from the Consti
tution relative to the executive and legis
lative powers.
Mr. Davis replied by saying that the pre
amble Of the Constitution confers no pow
ers on the Government; the Supreme
Court had so interpreted It,
He also claimed that the President had
no right to suspend the writ of habeas
corpus, which was a legislative, not an ex
ecutive funotion. The powers to be exer
oieed are to be conferred by the constitu
tion alcne and there are no powers vested
in the Government whioh are not confirmed
by the constitution. Hence the President
cannot raise troops or armies, nor haa he
the power to organise any measure to put
down insurrections without the assent of
Congress. It was the determination of the
party in power that the war shall continue
till the next Presidential election. The
war would have been brought to a close
long ago if the Administration bad singly,
and in good faith, devoted itself to the
principles announced lo the Crittenden
resolutions, and if the commanders of
armies had not been selected, not because
of their hostility to the rebels but because
of their opposition to slavery.
Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire, rose to in
dignantly deny that it was ths desire of
gentlemen on this floor to continue the war
in order to influenoe the next Presidential
election. A more atrocious aliegation
against honorable men never was listen
ed to from the beginning of time to the
present moment, if the allegations of the
Senator were true, he would sooner take
Into his own hands the hand of a man
from the char oel house, reeking with pes
tilence, thn the hands of those around
him.
If the allegation was true that every
Snator was stamped with the foulest trea
son and perjury, the destinies of the coon
try have been submitted to the gentlemen
around him who are bound by their oath
to sustain the Country and the Con
stitution and to defend the firesides and
homes threatened by invasion, while the
Senator from Kentucky says they are hypo
crite, and do sot mean to sustain these
objeots.
Senator mvis explained that he had re
ference to these in power.
Mr. Hale replied that Ihe Senator bad
made an allegation whioh embraced every
Senator. It was an allegation which, if
true, would disgrace the inmates of a Pen
itentiary. The character of the President
was also included in tfcu allejation. He be
lieve, one thing met everybody s assent,
that Llnoln is eminently an honest, pat
riotic man. To day, for the first time, he
had heard the honesty and patriotism of
the Executive questioned.
If Mr. Stanton has o&llsi) tor black sol
dlers to take up arms and calls them out to
fight the battles of the country it is bound
to protect them at all hazards Ly every
agency it aan patrons, iue novernment
having used them, and they having be
come prisoners, and if they are abandoned
to their fate It ia guilty of baseness un
heard of ia history. The) party in power
hat one aim and that aim is the country ;
but one purpose and that ia the salvation
of the country.
The idea that th Administration and
its supporters desire the continuance of
the war-, in order to eontrol taaiext Pita.
llenual election desire this cruel war
with its cries of anguish, our sons given to
slaughter, our widow, mourning and ear
ainarea to destitution, is an insinuation
so base that he wondered it found its way
even to the fertile biain of the Senator
from Kentucky. Applause ia the eat
eries. Line, of Indiana, remarked that he nn.
derstood the Senator from Kentucky to
say that a Major General had declared it
was proposed by the President to retain
his power, even though the eleotions ko
against him. If that bs true the Ad
ministration does not d-serve the confi
dence of the country, if false the officer
should be mustered out of service as un
worthy the oemmand he bears. Ha should
like to know the name of the officer.
Mr. Davis replied the Senator was mis
taken. A gentleman who was formerly a
member of the other House had informed
him that there was a Msior-General who
said if Lincoln was defeated in the next
Presidential eleotion he (Lincoln) would
cot surrender the office. If the Senator
from Indiana ( Lane) would come to him
(Davis) in the strictest confidence he would
give him the name of the Major-General
ana mat or nis informant.
Mr. Lane had only to sav that any Ma-
jor-uenerat wno would make such a state
meat was unworthy the honor of the Gor-
ennenl. lr true, the Government was un
worthy of the confidence of the humblest
supporter of the government.
He denied that any such remark was
true.
The pending resolution of Mr. Davis was
referred to the Military Committee.
Aajiurned,

The Speaker laid before the House
message from the President cordia'.ly
reoommending Captain John Rogers, who
oaptured the Fingai, for his distinguished

of the resignation of Thos. Coltman, a

named does not appear on the rolls of the
House the communication was not laid be
fore the House. .
Mr. Stevens of Pennsvlvania. intro
duced a series of resolutions, referring
various branches of the President's Mes
sege to the appropriate Committees, and
that part with reference to the treatment
and condition of the rebellious States to a
select Committee of nine, to be appointed
by the Speaker.
Mr. Davis of Maryland, offered aa a anH.
stitute, that so much of the President's
Message as relates to the dutr of the Uni.

Republican form of Government, and to
those States in which the Government has
been abrogated or overthrown, be referred
to a select Committee of nine, who shall

Mr. Brooks, of New York, said If tie
proposition of Mr. Davis should be persist
ed in he should be disposed to add that this
special oommittee also inquire whether

NASHVILLE, Dec. 15.
There Is a rumor here that General
Sheridan, commanding a column in pur
suit of Longstreet, encountered the rebel
rear-guard east of Knoxville, and sus
tained a heavy repulse, in whioh it is said
that General Sheridan was badly wounded.
The rumor i. not generally credited at
General Rosseau's headquarters, but the
rumor is triced to eeveral distinct sources.
Unless corroborated by dispatches from
Chattanooga of this date, the story may be

General Palmer resigned the eemmand

A cermpondent of the New York Times,
