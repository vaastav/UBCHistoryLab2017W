If all preachers could read the
Bible as well as Mrs. Fenetta Sar
gent Haskell reads the story of Da
vid and Goliath, . homilies would be
superfluous.
New Mexico might as well remain
a territory, if the Federal govern
ment is to take charge of the public
schools and other local affairs - of
the states.
Mrs. Haskell rightly . places the
Bible at the head of literature. There
are too many books and sermons
ABOUT the Bible and not enough
reading of the Book itself.
If the President is upheld In his
plan to centralize all power in the
Federal government, there will be
enough states involved in the next
secession move to make it a suc

I Did you ever go into the store of
Price & Co., and fail to meet Mr.
Price within five minutes. That is
one secret of his success as a mer
chant. He is acquainted with 'his
customers and is always glad to see
them.
Teddy is certainly going some on
the home-stretch. The Record is now
convinced that he meant it when he
said that he would not run again. His
proposition to centralize all power
in the Federal government, finally
settles the matter.
PROBABLY A JOKE.

Of their uncommon consequence.
Oh, Home-Folks, you're the best of all
At ranges this tereschul ball
But, north er south, er east er west,
It's home is where you're at your

It's home it's-home your faces shine,
In-nunder your own fig and vine
Your family and your neighbors 'bout

THE GROWTH OF NEW MEXICO
From Santa Fe New Mexican.
The growth of New Mexico especi
ally in the eastern portions of the
Territory is attracting favorable at
tention and tnis will aid towards its
continuance. This is especially the
case in the counties of Union, Quay,
Guadalupe, Roosevelt, Chaves, Eddy
and Torrance. The homestead entries
which have been made in these coun
ties during the year 1906, are more
numerous than those in any of the
other land, offices of the United States
in the west and for that matter any
where where there are public lands
subject to homestead or desert land
entry. The El Paso Herald notices
this very satisfactory state of af
fairs properly, remarking thereon that
in the United States, there is no re
gion that has progressed or prosper
ed more, or gained more population
in proportion, during the last twelve
months, than the Pecos Valley of New
Mexico and the territory adjacent to
the valley railroad along up toward
the Panhandle. Homeseekers by the
thousands have poured in there, and
towns have sprung up all along the
way.
Banks and newspapers have made
firm roots as swiftly as the saloons.
churches, and schools. It used to be
that the saloons came first and the
others trailed along, considerably lat
ter. But these towns of the newest
New Mexico are all there when they
arrive, and the better element in com
munity life takes control from the
start and maintains it.
It is about as jolly a lot of news
papers and as fat a lot of -banks over
there as the young wes,t affords. The
newspapers are filling the banks with
others " people's money and doing a
great work to spur the unsettled pop
ulation of new and necessarily raw
communities into concerted and vig
orous action toward building towns:
fit for permanent homes in paradise.

the Southwestern Savings, Loan &
Building Association on the easy
payment plan, and who are to-day,
living under their own roof, Instead
of a landlord's house, a payment of
$15.00 or $20.00 per month will pay
for a home thru this association In
