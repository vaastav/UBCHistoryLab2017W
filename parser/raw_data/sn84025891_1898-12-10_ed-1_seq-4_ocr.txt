FALSE REPORTS.
If there is anything which
should be condemned and if possi
ble abated in our city, it is the pro
pensity and attempt of the evi
minded persons to manufactureand
circulate false reports concerning
persons whose reputations are
above reproach. The man or wo
man who maliciously puts in cir
dilation, by enuendo or direct state
ment a rumor which is false and
calculated to injure the fair name
of a person ought to be hunted
down, prosecuted and ostra.
cised by all decent people. There
seems to be an increase in the hab
it of scandalizing deoent people.
Too often our best men and wo
men are scandalized by those whose
intelligence and standing m the
community would imply the con
trary. Often a fellow preacher, a
school teacher, or a business man
will with astounding audacity cir
culate a rumor the authenticity of
which he knows to be doubtful if
not absolutely wanting. This un
fortunate condition should not ex
ist. The race has enemies enough
who can discover a sufficient num
ber of our actual weaknesses and
shortcomings to feed their abuse
without being assisted by morbid
gossip and scandal mongers of our
own race. When a rumor is heard
which reflects upon the character
of our people, we should not give
it currency unless the authority is
unquestioned and its drastic
treatment demanded in the interest
of the public and especially of the
race. This habit of washing our
dirty linen before the public is
small and indicates the absence of
race pride., and those who indulge
in it whether high or low ought to
be stigmatized as enemies of the race
and treated accordingly, The time
has come when the moral and pro
gressive people should weed out
these meanest and most cowardly
marplots. Whenever we hud one
who is disposed to spread that
which he is not certain of, let us
set him down as a knave for the
chances are" that we will not be
mistaken. As a rule they belong
to a class whose reputaiions are
shady and they are anxious to have
company.
THE PLOPLE WHO BELIEVE
SCANDALS.
It may seem strange, but the
class of people who are more in
clined to believe scandals are of
two kinds. First, we have the sus
picious class or persons who belong
to the doubtful class or those of
easy virtue. The second class
who will believe scandals may be
found among the jealous lot. We
meau those persons who are social
ly ignored or those who are not
permitted admission into the re
fined and cultured society. This
class of people will believe a lie
sooner than if the truth were told.
This is a hard class to convince.
You will find them among the easy
virtue crowd.
People who are jealous of the
success of others will resort to any
thing to degrade them. This was
fully demonstrated some few weeks
apo in a mithical raid that was
claimed to have taken jalace on T
frPt.. The Bee as well as hun-
dreds of other people know that
thii whole i caudal was contrived by
WWI VV - -
malicious persons.
Respectable people and people
who are not themselves under a
cloud, are not inclined to believe
1 scandals.
LET THE SOUTH NA3IB THE
MAX.
The Post is eminently correct.
The Democratic party, as a whole
is evil. It has lived and thrived
on crime. It has thrown the
weight of its powerful influence
against all legislative designed to
promote tho welfare of the country
and bring peace and prosperity to
a majority of is citizens. The
great majority of the party are at
the South and there the constitu
tion and amendments are laughed
to scorn and the Jives of human
beings are considered no more than
that of beasts. The northern wing
of the party should give away and
permit the southern to names heir
next presidential candidate. Then
the party would have a leader who
would be a true exponent of its
ideas. Tillman or McLauriu
wouldj be most acceptable to the
South, to the Post and to the Bee.
Let the South name the man.
EEGISTEK LYONS.
We have the most profound re- J
spect for a brave and manly man,
but we have no respect for a cow
ard and scycophant. The letter of
Register Lyons in last Sunday's
Post was the utterance of a true
and honest man. It was manly,
brave and pointed. He did not
descend to he level of an apologist
and trimmer. If more men like
Register Lyons would speak out
the condition of affairs among the
negroes would be better.
We have always had the most
profound respect for Register Ly
ons. He is unlike many negro rej
resentatives we have. Aside fro
the manhood he always manifes 3t
he is honest, noble and uprig .
He speaks the truth and when this
can be found m a public man he is
bound to succeed.
IS IT BLACKMAIL?
A city contemporary remarked
last week that '"blackmail may
make a paper sell among the sensa
tional incline, but it is not jour
nalism." TheBEE agrees with the
apostle of reform and begs leave to I
add, that it is not blackmailing, if
a scandal is exposed to the moral
people in a community for expos
ing a man who deserts his wife and
ordering her arrest because she
objected to his throwing his money
away on prostitutes. Of course our
contemporary wouldn't object to
such a publication and we don't
think it would say that it would be
a case of blackmail if such a person
were exposed.
Now that the Philippines are
about to be ours the alarmists of
the Vest ilk are beginuing-to spread
the news that it wont do to guaran
tee the dark inhabitants a republi
can form of government. If the
republican form is so well adapted
to others, why not to them. It is
tile same old fear of f nigger .domi
nance' albeit it is to be 8000 miles
away.
No wonder the howlers do
not want to guarantee it a home.
Itjserms that Kelly Miller's star
of hope is eclipsed and life has lost
its glitter. All the same he may
not decline to accept a bid to con
tinue his vaporings to the satisfac
tion of the enemies of the race. We
may hear more from Kelly.
If the report of The Secretary of
the Treasury means anything, it
means that the country is financial
ly prosperous and that the tenta
cles of the octopus are growing
while the erstwhile apostles of free
silver are growing microscopically
s f
All the same the document was a
good one and we may hope for
vigorous treatmeut of the latter
subject in the near future. Surely
our friends are not all dead.
It would have strengthened and
encouraged the friends of "a free
ballot aud a fur count" if
he had I
paid some attention to the riots
and bloodshed in the Oarolinas.
One of the strongest and brav
est colored men in this country is
the Hon. J. P. Green, of Ohio. He
has never been recreant to a tru-t
and manifests elements of leader
ship which promise to bring him to
the fore front. He is truly a race
man, but does not belong to that ra
bib class that are always burning
when there is no need offire. He
knows how and when to speak and
then he is heard by the best thinkers.
If we could only oust scandal,
mongers and race traducers from
high places we would effect a need
ed reform. Those who think that
they can elevate themselves by drag
ging others down will sooner or
later receive there just deserts.
n When will Prof. Kelly Miller and
his disciples discover that the black
man's participation in politics is
not the cause of his -persecution by
the whites of the South? The whole
question hinges upon the white
man's jealousy of the negro's mate
rial prosperity. They love the poor
darky who lives from hand to
mouth, but they utterly despise
the intelligent and thrifty negro
who does not need their advice or
assistance.
Congress has convened and the
colored citizens of the country await
with much anxiety its action with
respect to the recent outrages at
the South.
Mr. Magnus L. Robinson has
joined the small band of negro
apologists. He is welcome to his
company. The host of anti-slavery
workers, now dead, never dreamed
that thirty years of freedom would
produce ajcrop of black Benedict
Arnolds.
Mrs. Langhorn, Lexington, Va.,
is evidently a good christian woman
an oasis in the desert that; sur
rounds her. In her letter in Sun
day's Post she says; speaking of
colored preachers; "They will urge
their hearers to spoil the Egyp
tians.' '
If Mrs. Langhoru will rise up and
explain why negroes are slaughtered
just about election time we will
probably reach an agreement.
For the benefit of the coward
who sent that anonymous letter to
11C9 I streeet northwest request
ing certain things to be done, will
please tak notice that he or she
or whom he or she may be is a
pusilanimous poltroon; knave and
scoundrel.

MUSICAL NOTES.
The recent production of Gilbert's
and Sullivan's comic opera "The Pir
ates of Renzance" by the choir of Mt.
Zion M, E. Church, Georgetown, at
Grand Army Hall was an artistic as
well as financial success. Prof. R.S.Par
rott deserves great credit indeed. The
male chorus was superb and Mr. J.
Townsend Beason the tenor was heard
to great advantage. Hoffman's Or
chestra assisted.
Newark, N. J. has a good male cho
rus known as the Adger Glee Club.
The "Trocha" a Cuban dance which
is being played all over the country
was composed by Wm. H. Tyers an
Afro-American composer and pianist.
Mr. Tyers is connected with the big
publishing house of F. A. Mills in New
York City and receives a handsome
salary for his compositions.
The services of Mr. Frank Whiting
the celebrated mandolin pla3er of this
city is in great demand.
Miss Nelle Freeman of the Plymouth
Church choir and Miss Elenor Jackson
of Shiloh Church choir bcth possess
voices of unusual good quality.
Mr. Joseph H. Douglass by his fine
playing this season has scored a big
hit.
The Asbury M. E. Church choir now
ranks with the best in the city.
What has become of that promising
voung singer Miss Helen Adams?
Coleand Johnson's "ATrip to Coon
town Co " may not appear here at all
this season on account of their failure
to secure a suitable Theatre. This
troop is undoubtedly the brst colored
show on the road today. Lyod Gibbs
the Baltimore tenor is with the com
pany. It seems as though no concert is
complete without a number or two
from our own Amphion Glee Club.
The resignation of Prof. T. L. Fur
by has been accepted by the board of
trustees of Metropolitan Wesley Zion
Church.
The Layton testimonial was a big
affair. Majr u. A. -Fleetwood is in
the front rank as a concert manager.
'Tis said that Maior Arthur Brooks
left Bandmaster Elzie Hoffman word
that he has a fine banl for the next
annual High School Cadet competi
tive drill.
REV. GRIMKE'S SERMON.
The condition of the negro in
america. a sermon that touch
ed the. hearts of the people.
self-appointed white masters,
through the darkest cloud,
there is a silver lining fred
erick Douglass memory applaud
ed. And I want to tell you this morn
ing what the ground of this hope is.
Before doing so however, I may be per
mitted to say in passing, I do not think
there is much ground for hope through
national interposition. Whether the
general government has power or not
the simple fact is, it lacks the
disposition. I refer to no particular ad
ministration, but to the general gov
ernment as such. It doesn't seem to
make anv difference who is at the
head of affairs, the same indisposition
is found, the sam; timidity is manifest
ed, the same let-alone policy is pur
sued. I do not at this point raise the
question as to whether that is a right
or wrong policy. I am simply noting
the fact, and saying that through
that source, is little or no ground of
hope so far as I can see, and yet, I
have sometimes felt that if we could
have had in the presidential chair
a succession of men like Thaddeus
Stevens of Pennsylvania, that that
stern old commoner, that man of iron
will, and of deep heart-felt sympathy
for the oppressed, the spirit of law
lessness in the South would long since
have been stamped out. He would
have found a way, just as President
Cleveland found a way to suppress
the labor riots in Chicago. Where
there is a will, there is a way.
We have a civil service law, but it
doesn't stand in the way, when there
are personal or partisan ends to be
subserved.
The old pro-slavery power never
found any difficulty in finding in the
constitution and laws of the land a
warrant for whatever it wanted to do;
why should we find any difficulty in
finding a warrant in the constitution
and laws of the land for suppressing
mob violence and revolution, rooting
out the band of murderers and trai
tors that infest the Southern
section of our country? If the ene
mies of freedom found a way to
do what they wanted, why should we
find any difficulty in protecting inno
cent anil loyal black citizens of the
Republic, who have been true to the
nation in every crisis of its history,
and who are today as true and as pa
triotic as any other class of citizens ?
Why, I ask,"should there be any dif
ficulty? I s.mply raise the question;
I shall not attempt to answer it. So
far, as I am concerned, I see no
ground of hope through national
interposition.
Nor do I see any hope through the
action of either of the great political
parties. We have nothing to hope for
from the democratic party, neither
have we anything to hope for from the
republican party. Neither party is
going to concern itself about the
rights of the neero, except so far as it
can use him. Neither party
feels any interest in him; both would
be glad to get rid of him. In the
South the democratic party would
eliminate him entirely, and in the
North, it is only where he holds the
balance of power, that any attention is
ever paid to him. I am not speaking
for or against either party, I am simp
ly stating a fact, which you know, and
which I know, and which every man
white or black knows to be true. The
democratic party his always stood in
the way of the negro's advancement,
that is its record. And the republi
can party, at least, the time was when
it stood squarely on the platform of hu
man rights, when hs great strong arm
was stretched out in protection f the
negro, when it felt as Lowell has so
nobly .expressed it:
"We owe allegianceto the State; but
deeper, truer, more,
To the sympathies that God has set
within o-ir spirits core;
Our country claims our fealty, we
grant it so, but then
Before men made us citizens, great
Nature made us men.
"He's true to God who's true to
man; wherever wrong is done,
To the humblest and the weakest,
neath the all-beholding sun,
That wrong is also done to us; and
they are slaves most base,
Whose love of right is for them
selves and not for all their race."
That is where the republican party
once stood, when it was dominated by
the influence of such men as Sumner
and Wilson, Chase and Giddings,
Morgan Stevens and a host of other
champions of Ireedom; but it is not so
low. It is so absorbed with matters of
the tariff and the currency that it does
not seem to hear any longer the cries
of the oppressed millions of negroes
for protection against lawlessness
and brutality. I do say this, witli a
view of including a single representa
tive of our race to abandon the grand
old party; we owe it much; all that we
have, freedom; citizenship, the ballot,
came to us chrough it. We never can
forget it. We never will forget it.
No and it is, because of the
love I bear it, and of what it has
been, that it grieves me to find it so
lukewarm and indifferent now to the
interests which once stirred it so pro
foundly. Nor is there, so far as I can see,
much ground of hope from an appeal
to force. The odds are against us.
Even in the South, the whites out
number us, are superior to us in intel
ligence and in resources. It is also
morally certain that if there should be

While all this may be true, and yet I

EX SENATOR DEMAS, OF LOUIS
IANA. From the New Orleans, La., Republican.
The following letter of ex-Naval
Officer Henry Demas, of Louisiana,
late naval officer, speaks for itself.
His republicanism and patriotism is
above self, and should be an example
to Mr. Wanamaker and other disgrun
tled Republicans. It is commonly
known that Senator Quay opposed
Demas' confirmation, and yet this stal
wart Republican refuses to traduce the
Senator or join with his enemies m
denouncing him. This act must place
Demas high up in the estimation of
Senator Quay and every other loyal
Republican. We congratulate the Sen
ator upon his wisdom and liberality
which cannot fail to win for him friends
should the President be as true to him
as Cleveland was to Mathews and
send his name again to the Senate for
confirmation. 'J o be consistent De
mas' name must be sent in again or
Wimberly's name withdrawn, unless
the color line is obtained, both at the
White House and in the Senate. They
both must stand or fall together, be
ing under the same indictment, by the
New York World, Warmoth, Kellogg
and other anti-McKinley agencies.
We expect to see the President do the
right thing, and stand squarely by De
mas and give him a renomination. He
has been reindorsed by the people of
his district by a re-election as chair
man, of the district committee. We
hope that Senator Hanna, always true
to his friends, will urge the renomina
tion of Senator Demas for the position
of naval officer.
DEMAS WAS FOR QUAY
Hon. H. C. C. Astwood,
Bryan Mawr, Pa.
My dear friend Astwood:
Through the columns of thz Defend
er I am apprised of your safe return
to the States from Santiago, Cuba, the
site where American arms and valor
achieved victory in the recent war
waged against Spain, in the interest of
humanity and Cuban independence.
It affords me pleasure to resume our
correspondence that was temporarily
suspended by your departuie, First,
I must congratulate you on the ably
edited paper you are issuing and on
the gallant fight you are making for
the Regular party nominees and the
defense of Senator Quay, against his
political enemies and traducers; al
though the Senator, when it was his
opportunity to do me the kindness
and party act, dealt me the meanest
blow in the matter of my confirmation
for the naval office, 1 say meanest
blow, and a blow that was keenly felt by
me, for the reason that it had its direc
tion from one whom I had always re
garded as one of the ablest and fairest
in the party and the truest friend of
the colored man, yet while he found it
probably a pleasure to injure me, I
would rather have him triumph in his
present struggle over the malicious
practices and mean advantages that
his adver;aies are endeavoring to take
of him, than to learn of his defeat. I
am a republican with all Republican
tendencies, and for this reason alone I
am for Quay and his success. I fin
any way I could be instrumental in
contributing to his success, I would
gladly and willingly do so. Convey to
him my honest Irishes and deep inter
est for his political welfare and tri
umph, and hope that you may succeed
in having our people in Pennsylvania
do their duty to themselves and party
by standing by Senator Quay and the
regular Republican nominees.
Respectlv vours.
HENRY DEMAS.
