SIZING UP HARRISON.
Caustic Comments of tho Proas on
tho President's First Message
to Congress.
The Chicago Herald says that free
whisky and tobacco are to bo given the
people in the place of free blankets, coal,
lumber, etc.
Chicago Times: "President Harrison
opens with acoti pie of columns descriptive
of the slate of affairs with foreign landp,
in all of which, Bince we are at peace
with the world, there is little of genuine
interest."
Chicago News: Perhaps the most strik
ing feature of President Harrison's flrat
annual message to Congress is the dum
ber of new ways for spending money
which it points out."
New York Herald: "President Harri
son's message is a plain business docu
ment, well written, and making recom
mendations strictly in the line of the
Republican platform."
Chicago' Globe : " Curiously enough
President Harrison follows almost exact
ly in the line of Cleveland's last message
in declaring that the collection of moneys
not needed for public uses imposes an
unnecessary burden upon the people.
The similarity ends with this frank ad
mission, and in the President's recom
mendations there is neither reason nor
statesmanship."
The Chicago Tribune, " while rinding
much to commend,in thePresident's mes
sage, confesses its disappointment that
the President advocates the repeal of the
internal revenue tax on tobacco. The
Tribune does not believe that the revenue
released by the government would benGt
in any appreciable degree any one but the
middlemen in the tobacco trade, and
urges that the tobaco tax be continued as
a fund to pay pensions."
NewYork Times: "Itis natural enough
that a mind capable of composing so dull
a message should be incapable of rightly
appreciating its own work. As a mere
reference index to the public business,
the message may have some value in
Congress and in newspaper offices, but if
it records the events of the times it throws
no light upou them, and while it refers
to acknowledged evils, it suggests no
proper remedies. No other motive than
fear could have restrained tho President
from making clear and specific recom
mendations of tariff reform."
The New York Sun's comment is the
most caustic yet seen. The Sun says :
"For oriinality,gra8p of public questions
and sense of perspective In the statement
of the condition of National affairs, Gen
eral Harrison's mesaago compares un
favorably with the first message sent to
Congress by Mr. Hayes twelve years ago.
The weakest man that ever occupied the
White House had more to offer Congress
in way of information and suggestion,
and offer it with a more vigorous individ
uality of thought and expression, than
the present chief executive of the United
States can exhibit or command. Nobody
would be gladder than the Sun to discover
in tho President's first important state
paper the faintest sign of intellectual
promise, tho least indication of a powor
to rise above the deadly dull line of
mediocrity. Where is there such a sign?
Take fn.m the President's message those
parts which merely repeat or paraphrase
the ideas and recommendations of his
cabinet olUcors aud what remains? Tho
rest is a scrap-book of omparatively un
important facts.
The Frankfort Capital will be iesuid
daily during the session of the Legisla
ture, and as it 'will give a full ropoit
daily of tho proceedings of the General
Assembly, it is well worth the one dollar
asked for it.

Geo. H. Tiiobk has at last gotten his
reward for his despicable work in contest
ing Hon. John G. Carlisle's election a
faw years ago. Republican Congressmen
have elected him Third Assistant Ser-geant-at-Arms
of tho House.
It was the worst element of the Re
publican party, backed by tho Pacific
Railroad rings, that placed Reed in the
Speaker's chair of the present Congress.
Watch him and Bee if he doesn't favor
the monopoly crowd at any and every op
portunity. TnoiiAs H. ConnBTT, Register of the
Land Office, saya tho boom in Eastern
Kentucky has put his department upon
almost a self-sustaining basis. Ho and
his clerks are weeks behind in their
work, and they are busy" till a lato hour
almost every night. Such activity in
tracing up titles and looking through old
gra'nts was never known before. This in
creased business of the Land Office is
-pretty conclusive evidence that the boom
in Southeastern Kentucky is of the sub
stantial sort. ..Audit, ia nothing to wbt
