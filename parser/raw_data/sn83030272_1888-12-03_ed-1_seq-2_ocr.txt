WinisoTox, Dec. 2 Tho canvass for the
BpeakersblD of the rifty.flrst Concrete has
begun boroln jurt as lively nnd determined a
m manner as n too iiohsc was iu uq oraanizeu
next month. The several candidates feel that
thero Is grea likelihood of nn extra session In

1 Ono of theso geutlemen In eonTersatlon this
' 1 Tenlnc struck the lor note of tho canvass
'1 Whan ho said that it Is to be n war of the West
jf against the East, and that tlio West will win.
J Tbo main struggle, he said, would be betweon
f Iteed nnd McKlnlor, and that like all such
'ft flshts a compromise candidate would be apt to
II get the prlro. Cannon and Burrows, therefore.
IK have out their lightning rods, nnd each hopes
Ik to be struck when the Maine man and his Ohio
!K competitor have killed each other. There Is
s one matter In the coming contest ovor
IB the organization of the Ilouse that
'1 Is coins to cau tho Republican leaders a
lis. hsattnf trnuhla. Thll Is tha nuoallon of how
Jo dispose of Judge Kelly, the father of the
louse. They want to put the old man on the
IB helf, but be won't agree to this arrangement.
1 Word has alreadr come to the llepubllcans
1 that the great i'ennsylvanlau protectionist
n ROt onlr expects to te Chairman of the
f K Ways and Means Committee, but that he will
! H Bake matters docldedly uncomfortable lor his
Ij celleaffuee if ther attempt to rob him of the

It Speakership tha most natural thing to do
if lrouM bo to make him Chairman of the Wars
S and Means Committee. This cannot be done,
m however, while holly la In the way, and there is
H alio another barrier to suob A programmo In
II tha rjarson of Gen. Tom Brown of Indiana.
a Committee promotions are made according to
!m a long-established custom in rotation, and
It so happens that the turn of Oen.
I Brown comes next to that of Judge Kelly, and
ft thellooeler Is therefore ahead of both Iteed
jl and MoKlnley In the line of promotion. The
I General isnot modest, either, and It has come to
(1 the ears of the llepubllcans that It they should
( auooeed In ahelrlng Kelly they would not hare
if bo easy a tank with Brown. If trie first man
I yields his rights to the chairmanship, the eeo-
II end one will not. To show howatrongly mera
1 bers are disposed to Insist on observing the
If rule ol promotion, thecoaeof MoKlnley Is cited.
m A. few years ago bis name stood near the head
cf the list ot the membership on the Ways
and Means Committee. His election was
ij contested and a Democratic House unseated
if bun. When he returned as a member of the
t sext Congress It was proposed to put him In
II his old place on the committee. The mem
? hers who hsd been promoted by his absence
it obieoted, and Mr. McKlnley's name went to the
fg foot of the list. There Is only one same lower
IS than bis now. that of Julius C Burrows. It.
J therefore, Messrs. Kelly and Brown Insist on
i J their rights, it will be impossiblo to trlvo the
Sf consolation prize of the committee Chairman
I ship' to either of the defeated candidates for
m the Bpeaxerehlp. Thi fact will serve to make
Iteed and McKlnlor flcht each other to the blt
J terend.
There ha been a rumor going about for
ome tlmo that Mr. Iteed docs not want to be
Speaker. The other candidates say this is a
groat mistake, and that he Is especially de
sirous ol securing the honor.' They all feel
The friends of Burrows say that he will do-
welop moto strength than in thought of now,
and that If he does not win he will cause some
troublH to the other candidates. It is glren

Senator Flumb of Kansas does not think

iaternl issues which Jed to Democratic defeat,
n munufatturlnc districts tho Democratlo

dlstrictstbo Kopubllvana made thvir greatest

gains in manufacturing districts was due to a
feeling of hostility toward the tariff on the part
lf woTKincmen, hut rather bocuusu of feeling
on the part or many of the men against their
emnloreiR, because, perhaps, they believed
their wages wero vot eulllclently great. One
of the causes which in mr judgment led to Mr.
Cleveland's defeat was the administration of
the 'Interior Department. The management
of the Land Office under Mr. (Sparks ere
nted a hlttcrnea of feeling against Cleve
land In the uBt thut one unfamiliar with
the Western people could Imagine. Another
cause of discontent and dlsatUlu'tlon was the
administration of the Tost Office Department,
Which, until within a short time, has been lis
' graceful. Then the President's pension vetoes
were, many of them, brutal. They showed a
1 total lack of sympathy on his part with the
pen who played nuch an important cart In the
history ot this country a quarter of n century
ago. Beyond all. howeor. there was a deep

The proceedings of the House to-morrow

The inaugural ooromltteo has appointed a

with the Washington committee. In New York
Oen. Horace Porter, Mr. Jesse fiellcrann. nnd

nominal, but will take up considerable time.
A good deal of the Inauguration Is prepared In

supper for the inaugural ball is cooked there. ,
These gentlemen are not exactly oxpected to I

District la Intuited.
Neither Mr. John J. O'Brien nor any of bis
friends are troubled over their coming misfor
tunes. They expect the County Committee to
turn them all out when It meets next week.
This Is the only body that can turn them out.
The County Executive Committee, of which
ex-Assemblyman Brodsky Is member from the '
TCtlrhth illfltrtef trtll hnlri n fcaprnf mntfhrv In
the early part of the week, probably on Tues
day, and will likely recommend tbo expul
sion of Mr. Brodsky, Mr. Ooetz. and the other
members of tho committee. As is well known.
Mr. O'Brien and Mr. O'llourle have no official
connection with the party to sever. The lle
publlcans of tho Eighth district intend to make
no fight over their expulsion. If the County
Committee wants to turn them out It may.
Mr. Brodsky belongs to the County Committee,
and will be their spokesman when the County
Committee meets. Ho will recite the good
work that hl9 district has done for the Bepub
llcan national and State tickets, and will tell
the other committeemen that II they want to
turn them out for having given Harrison 876
majority, or about twice aa much as he received
In all the other districts in the city, they can
go ahead and do it
It is possible that at tho same time the woes
of the Eighth district may be recited. It is
not generally known that tho Republicans ot '
tbo Eighth district have political grievances
against the llepubllcans of the neighboring
districts, but such is tha case. The iivjiubiu:- i
ansof tbeJUlghtb district, which is the only I
ltepublican district on the eust side have not
been allowed a candidate on a local ticket for I
years. They have not beeu periultt-d to nom- I
Inato a Senator, a Civil Justice, a Congreix- ,
man. or oven a coroner, xne xentn, tne
Twelfth, the Fourteenth, and the hlxtli dis
tricts, their neighbors, and the districts joined
with them In judicial, (ienntorial. and Congress
districts have taken all the nominations. The
last time the J-.lchth had a candidate, some
years ago. ho was slaughtered in tlie Teuth
district, the one right above where Police Jus
tice Patterson is leader. The kightb district
evened up accounts when Henty C Botty. a
friend ot Justice Patterson's, ran for Justice,
nnd when Frederick P. Doer, nnother friend of
J ustlco Patterson's ran for Senator. Mr. Doer
got just forty-five votes from the Eighth dis
trict, where Harrison had over 5,000. and
Botty had only a few hundred.
Christian Ooetz. Alderman elect from the dis
trict, and several other friends ot Mr. O'Brien's,
said yesterday:
" Vt hen Judge Patterson and Coroner Nugent
eold out our candidates we did not go to tho
County Committee and ark to have them ex
pelled, but we waited for ourownopuortuulty
to get even with them We did not go around
like babies and cry, but took the chance wo
hod to get square. Now. these men. who never
did anything for us. and who would not (sup
port any candidate from this district, are going
to have us expelled because wo did not support
their candidate for Coroner. The Tenth dis
trict, where Judge Patterson Is the lender, was
formerly a strong Republican district, but the
Democratic majority now Is up In the thou
sands, and the Tammanv candidate for As
semblyman bad a majority of tho votes in the
three-cornered fight.
"Ihey talk about organizing this district
against us. There Is no man here who would
take the leadership against Mr O'Brien. Mr.
Brodsky is one of Mr. O'Brien's personal
friends. Assemblyman Smith gets alone bat
ter oa Mr. O'Brien's friend than ne could out
Rldo. Alderman Qontz could never Qght
O'Brien. Barney Rourke. the strongest man In
the district outside of Mr. O'Brien, could not
be Induced to organizo the district. If they
want anybody to run this district except us
ther will have to send somebody down here,
and we would like to see bow many votes ho
could get.
"They talk, about the party In the Eighth
district being built up bynattonage. The lle
publlcans ot the Eighth district have had no
patronage for four years. Even tbe clerks in
the Bureau of Elections, of whloh Mr. O'Brien
Ischler, are policemen detailed for that pur- i
pose. Of the tfalrt-pne election district Cap
tains, not one Is an officeholder. Tbey are in
dependent gentlemen who tako an Interest in
politics Tbey could not be Induced to start
an organization hostile to themselvesund their
friends. The only one of them who could bold
his district against Mr. O'Brien is Barney
Ilourke. who controls two or three districts
along Hester street. He would not set up op.
position to Mr. O'Brien on his own account.
With the Federal patronage given to some
others than one of Mr. O Bricn's friends, and
with all the money that the Union League i
Club would put In this district, not over H00 '
votos at the most could be taken from Mr. I
O'Brien. If they want to expel him to simply
throw out bo many voteB they will be thankful
enough to come around again nnd ask for them
at the next election. This is not the kind ol a
State where 4,0(10 or 6,000 votes will be thrown I
away before election, no matter how these
peonlo talk every fall after election day. Last ,
fall they were as bud as they ure now. But Mr. I
O'Brien was elected a a delegate to the Re
publican National Convention, though ne was
an expelled member of the county organiza
tion, and Mr. Quay was grateful enough for the
b70 majority Harrison bad In this district.
Jacobus refors to 1HS5 to complain of his
treatment here. Barney Rourke and several
other election cartalns wore for White, but the
regular organization in the district did what It
could for Jacobus, and he carried the district.
These people talk about tbe Republican or
ganization. There is one Assembly district In
this town the Third In which there Is not ono
election district Republican captain, If tbe
other Twenty-three Assembly districts were as
well organized as the Eighth is. tbo Republi
cans would have two Senators, two Congnss.
men, and eight or nine Assemblymen Instead
or nn Congressmen, one Senator, mid five As
sercblytnen, wclcn in more than they usually
get."
The Eighth Is perhaps tbo most thickly
settled district In the world. It has forty
one blocks from Division street north, and
from tbe Uiweryto Norfolk street about six
blocks by seven. These forty-one blocks bold
between 9.000 nnd 10.000 votes, or about 210
votes to the block, Thero are thirty-one elec
tion districts, or an average of a block to a dis
trict, a
htle tbe County Committeemen nro pitch
Into the Eighth district, it nmy be noticed that
n if preventative nf the Eighth dlsti let received
an invitation to tbe Republican jubllet dinner,
and that o far as the national organization
goes, nothing but praise tor Harrison's major- i
Ity has been beard. Mr. O'Brien does not
think there will beany trouble in the Eighth I
district securing Its share of the IVderai '
patronage, especially if Mr. Piatt has charge
of tbe distribution in New York rlty nnd Mr.
(Juay's friend Wanainaker is uppolntoil Pom-master-General.
The leaders of the district
ratherenjoy tbe fuss that Is being made about
thftn. as thev- say It calls intention to the
claims tbey will have upon Oen. Harrison.
Mr. O'Brien has an Alderman In the next
Bonnl who will have n vote when Iti'omes to
electing a President In the place of George H.
Forster. nnd an Af-semblyman whom It ruin be
bandy for somelody to have when It monies to
passing bills in tbe Eeglslaturn or attempting
tr oveiridp tho Governor's veto. Altogether
the Republican politicians of the Eighth dls.

of the postal service for the fiscal yoar ended

with previous (ears, showing a remarkable ex
pansion of business and a largo increase In ex

The like 'deficiency for 18S6 was S7.1&G.594. In

In tbe railway mall service an increase of
about HOuO miles Is shown, as against the
previous year's estimated increase of 6.000
miles. There Is an increasoof 17.077.999 In tbe
number 'of miles travelled per annum, and a
decrease of 72 percent. In the rate of cost per
mile travelled, and an increase of 3.3 J per cent. '
in the avefnge number of trips per week. I
The total Yolume of business in the money '
order division tor the year Is upward of S143.
000.000. and shows a net profit to the Govern
ment of about S50 CUM. The 'volume of ordinary
mail matter has largely inorcased. and It is
estimated that tbe revenun on the number of
Eleces handled during the past year would
ave been without reductions of postage up
ward or 70.(iOO.OCO. Tho business of the regis
tration division has increased during the year
8.7 per cent, over that of tbe previous rear.
Carefully prepaied tttatistic are submitted
In overy branch of the service, demonstrating,
the reports says, lucreased efficiency over pro- '
vlous jean. I
The report submits elnborato schedules of ,
railwa) mail connections in tLo South and be- '
tven tlieorthwest and outh, showing con- 1
stantly Increasing business and need ot more
attention nnd menus for its proper care, with n
showing that the subject has received marked
consideration during the put fiscal year.
Tho Postmaster-Cietieral submits that appro- I
Eriation-vtor special pay to railroads should be '
cttsr distributed, or. If need be. increased, it
the policy of special appropriations for In- 1
creased nay Is to be continued, if e colls atten
tion to tbe bettleii appli ation of such appro
priations to the payment of one or two lines ot
road, and the aosence of any such means to
secure byScontrsct Letter connections between '
New York and New England and with the new
commercial t-outh. He says that by special
appropriations to a le-r of tbe railroads 1
the Impression is given that the depart
ment hHR tlio disbursement of a fund for
all. and dissatisfaction is created by Increased
pay to some for service no better or more
, needed. If so much, as that on the lines of
others who receive no such special lavors.
Nothvrltb3randlng the absence of any such
. funds, he nioceeds to show. In nddltlon to
I mnny special additions of improved service
upon shorter lines, that many through fast
mails have been added by negotiation and con
' tract The through last malls east nre the first
, in the history of the department.
1 Statistics are snbmltted contrasting our ser
vice with that of Great Britain. Germany, nnd
Franco, demonstrating that in cheapness of
postage, grossi revenue and expenditures,
number ot Post Offices, oxtent ot mall routes,
mileage of mall service, and volumo of mall
matter transmitted, tbe postal svatem of tbe
United States Is the leading one of the world.
'ihe total cost of the foreign mall service was I
$490 007. of which 1404.910 was for trans- I
1 porting mails of United States origin. Of this '
amount there was paid for transatlantic ser- 1
' vice, $353,262: for trans-PucItlc snrvlce. 142,533, I

average of a number of trips as reported by
tbe steamship companies. The fastest time
from New York to Loudon via Queonstown was
made by tho C'unard steamship I'mbrla viz..

Havana, Not. 24. Tho Bafludo murder af
fair still drags on. as deep a mystery over.
The daughter, Soflora Dofla Maria de Regie
Ssfludo de Mufioz. through her counsel, asked
that the house, 19 Inqulsldor street, bo turned
over to her. aa well as the money found In the
safes. The Court denied the petition, alleging
it was essential that tho scene of tho assassin
ation befcept preclsoly In the same condition
as when the deed was committed until tho
pollco had completed their Investigations. To
judge by appearances, the greatest activity is
I being displayed to unearth tho criminals.
Many persons haro beon arrested, only to be
t-et at liberty alter a few hours' detention. But
tlio real motive of this apparent activity Is.
exposed by the fact that Instoad of allowing the
ense to go to tho Judge in whoso district
tbe murder occurred, the Government has
named n special Judge to conduct the investi
gation. This is u favorite way with the Spanish
Government when It does not wish anything to
bo discovered. Witness tho Santiago and
Bejucal highway assault and murder. 'J lie
moment I beard a special Jndge had been
natnod I said tbe asaslns would go tree, nnd
the facts have fully borne out my prophecy.
The latest reports affirm that a specfnl proso-
tuilUK mtuiucr uuu 11 Flticini pntrtiu ueirtina
have also beon assigned to the case. The ac
cused may escAie with his llfo. but I doubt if
tbe same may bo said of his money. So many
special officers, whose only object Is to niuko
money out of the cae, aio quite able to ex
I haust any fortune. This case Is a fair sumplo
. of how justice is administered in Cuba.
The follow, ne story, only ope of mnny. will
I give an idea or another phnso of life iti Cuba
under the present Span'sb rule. Some dnys
ago a well-known n-siiitnt of this city re
ceived an anonmotm nolo demanding $500 as
th price of hie child'ei head, which, nc-cord.ng
to tbo letter, would be cut off 11 Ihe monevvtero
not that very evening plsced at the unknown
writer's disposal, 'ihe letter contained minute j
1 particultrsns to how tbo money was to be put
1 under a pile of stones, a few yards from tbe
father's house. The letter closed, as u-unl in
these cases, threatening the lather with dlro '
punishment in case ot disobedience or of his
giving any Information to the police. Tbe de
posit having been made according to lust Mic
tions, the gentleman saw a colored voman
emerge from behind a wall on the opposite sldo
of tho street, and cautiously nppioach tho ;
stone pllo where tho money had been hidden. '
As she was about tn grasp the roll of bills the
rattle of carrlago wheels frightened her. and I
she scampered away. After several hours of ,
anxious watching, ns tho colored woman did
not make her reappearnnco. the gentlemnn re
gained his money and decided to uwalt further
Omars.
On tbe following day another letter, demand
ing thnt ho again place the money In the sama
place and at the same hour, readied hltu. The
father complied, and the same colored woman,
rapidly approaching the stone pile, grasped
tho packet and strodo rapidly away. But things
did not end hero. The next day the same
anonymous hand informed blm tbnt the sum
was short of tbo amount demanded by 1'2, and
tn cnastlse .his carelessness ho would be
obliged to pay f 200, under the following condi
tions: Tho sum was to be handed to the
writer's representative nt a certain corner in
Prndo street by a man who should vvoar a blue
kerchief around his neck. The Indignant
father, losing all patience and having by this
time recovered from the shock the flrt letter
occasioned blm. Informed the police, and, ns
the same colored woman of the previous occa
sions advam-od to meet the boarer of the
money, the officers arrested her. She wns taken
to the station bouse, where she gavo her name
us Pari d ad Sariol,
The bandits are converting the fields Into a
Bort of hunting ground, in which they are tbo
shooters and the Cuban country folk nutl land
owners tho game. Lust week, ns Seftor Luis
lernnndoTrovejo wns passing fiom his farm
"San Francisco." situated in Las Mangns. to
the district ot Mnjanga. he was set upon by
two white men, wh i demanded his money and
jewelry. Not having anything of vulue about
1 him. Trevejo proposed that thpy should goto
bis house, where he would satisfy his captors"
demands. But the handtts were wary and in
sisted on tbo old gentleman following tnem to
their camp, to be hold osaho-tage. Seflor
Trevejo stoutiy refused, and one of the bandits
struck him a violent blow that knocked him to
the ground, unconscious. Nhenho recovered
the ruffians had gone.
Seflor t-ranclsco Hidalgo Gato was assas
sinated at his farm at Caraballo. and SeQor
Francisco Oberto was assaulted and danger
ously wounded on tho high road between
Mariel nnd Guanatay last week.
The Machln brother. who recently escaped
from tha Castillo del Prineipo. where they were
confined, are out with a band, eight strong, ot '
well-mounted and thoroughly armed men,
domineering the Guanatay district The Gov- I
ernment newspapers say bandits no longer ex- '
1st. and of course tbey ought to know. There '
are so many of them In tba Administration's 1
emplov, the official organs should be acquaint

Bonlanclata Parade,
Pabis, Dec. 2. A host of sigliteers gath
ered around the Baudin monument nt the en
trance to the Montmartre Cemetery this morn
ing. The municipal parade started from tbe
Hotel deVllle at 1:15 P. M.. and slowly pro- j
ceeded through tho streets, reaching tho come- 1
tery at 3 V. M. The police stopped all carriage J
traffic nleng the route at noon, and, as far as
possible, formed a cordon in order to keen I
back the crowd. No incident occurred that
impeded the march. On passing tho Northern
Bailway station thero were cries of " Vive la
Bepublliiuel' mingled ultli hissing. On the
Boulevard Magenta 11 man who tried to break ,
through tbe line of panniers wan arrested.
The procession, in point of numbers, wns a I
failure, not more than 30.1.00 being In line, and
half of J hose taking part were delegates from
the provinces. At tbe Boulevard St. Denis the '
students' delegation, which was greeted with
criesof '"WvelaBcpublbiue!'' responded with t
'A basBoulanger!" A trophy of tbe journal
La iMuternt evoked shouts of ' Down with the .
Jowsl" The appearance of a group composed I
of persons proscribed in the coud d diat of 1851 1
or wounded in tne revolution of 1818 every-
where elicited fervent choers.
, On arriving nt the monument. M. JJarlot,
President of tbe Municipal Council, delivered
nn oration. He said the object of the demon
stration was to commemorate Bandln's in
trepid defence of the republic's rights against
Casnnsm.and to honor those who bad been
proscribed or bad fallen at the time of the coup
d (tat. Alter a vigorous attack upon Boulnng
lam. ho said:
"Tbedemoeracy.acqulringronowed strength
in the example of the glorious dead, is pre
pared to, lace Casarism. which is again daring
to raise its head."
The speech was received with cries of "Vive
la Iteptililhiue." The procession filed past the
monument and then returned, singing the
Marseillaise." In tbo evening the city re
sumed its normal aspect.
The Uotilanglst Committee, In its manifesto, I
declares that although it refrains from the
Battdln demonstration, it venerates the memo,

On the return of tbe profession to the Qunr

IXDIANAPOLIS, Df?c. 2. Th VfpsbU In.tho
saddle. Ever since election day the llepubll-
can raiders Irom everywhere west of Penn
sylvania have been riding down upon Indian ,
anolls, making obeisance to tho President eleot 1
and casting defiance nt the effete East. The 1
sound of their tom-toms has been echoed In
tho Republican press of the' West, and tho
I clamor of their 6olls-demnncrag arms has
I rattled about Indianapolis like the fterco clash
j of swords In n singe battle. All this lime the
Eastern politicians liavo kept nnay. abso
lutely not a flnslo ltopubllcan of nolOft'Ou
, Now York, Pennsylvania, or New England lias
j put In nn appearance here since cloctlon. Ex- .
1 Benntor William J. fcowell of New Jersey did
I stop off on his way tin ough the Stale, but his
visit was purely incidental. There has been j
much talk of contemplated visits of New York
politicians here, or or Gen. Harrison going to ,
New York, and two or three men who might 1
be assumed to be close to tho Presidentelect
hnvo visited Now York recently, but to all ap
pearances there has not been anv approach to
direct discussion with Gen. Harrison of the
question of the share of the East in his Admin
istration and in the patronage ot tho Govern
ment. Probably no l'resldeut elect ever before
wan for a full month alter election let so se
verely nlono by Now York politicians.
The Indiana statesmen, from being aghast
nt the pro;pect of tho Invasion nnd capture of
Ben Harrison by the wicked politicians of Now
York and the East, bnvo drifted Into a state of
concorn because those snm'j politicians nro
studiously stnylng nt homo. Tho abs-enco of
representatives of Now York llepubllcans from
among the political pilgtlms begins to strike
the Uoosler Intellect as something slgnitlcant.
and they Hre wondering what It menus. New
York llepubllcans are not wont to be late nt
any spoils bantiupt. and their tardiness In
coming to the least of which tbe Indiana poll- j
ticlans bav 0 been sniffing ever rlnco election I
day surprises the Hoosiere, and makes them I
suspicious of a trap of some sort. They do not I
believe that New York and New England In- I
tend to sit quietly by nnd let the 'Western ele
( ment of tbo party get complete dominance in
the Administration,
But if that Is tho intention of Now York Ko
publicans, the Westerners feel themselves
fully etiunl to tho tusk 'of tilling all the ofllces.
One effect of tho absence of Now Yorkers has
been to enlargo the fluid of vision of the Jndl
, ana olllce seekers. At flrct the Treasury via?)
. conceded, without tue-tlon. to New lork, but
latelj tho fcollng has dcveloied hero that the
I reported differences between tbe Now York
, leadorsgive an opportunity for bringing that
, prize to tho West, and Indiana, true, as usual,
to tbo principle of clnlmlng everything in eight,
has boen -uying that John L. New was the man
forthe plan1. Kealli-.howevcr.no one thinks
New Is of Treasury calibre, and Allison is re
ally the candidate of tho West.
Tho stories thut u formal tender of that port
folio to tne Ioua Senator bud been made
through James S. Clnrkson have been revised
since Allison's visit here lust week. Senator
Allison's own expression on the matter was
guarded enough to moan thnt ho would like
the place If ho could get it. but was lnleron
tlally a denial that it had boen tendered to
him. It is piettj certain that the Treasury is
the only place that Allison would tako in tho
Cabinet, and it Is also oiettj certain that to bo
able to llnd In 1 iiuturel between tne New York
leaders an opportunity to place the Tieasury
In the hands 01 the Iowa tarllT reformer would
I tickle the next Prosident Immensely.
Allison is just tho kind ol a man to suit Har-
rlson for thut place. With tlie Treasury thus
provided for the Western politicians would
willingly gtvu up two minor Cabinet places to
New lork. and would plead that that course
would give the President an opportunity to
satisfy both tactions in New York, and would
therefore be good politics, as well as very con
venient tor the ambitious West.
Tho Post Offlcj Department the West also
wants, for its far-reaching Influence in local
polities. The Government Printing Ofllce an
other long-armed political machine, the West
Is bound to get. With these departments of
the Government, nnd with tho Northwestern
Territories admitted to Statehood, tbe West
ern politicians feci confident of wielding a
power in the future that will dominate tlie nn
tion and count New York out as 11 prepondera
ting Inlluenco in nominating nnd electing
President.
Tbe influence and manipulation of theTroas
ury Depenmeut will bringahout tariff changes
that will meet the demand of Western senti
ment. By tho Post Offices, the leaders will get
a fresh grip iu ever little town thtotich the
Western States. By tho Government Printing ,
Ofllce, an ardent set of wotkers selected from
the biightest and most intelligent employees
of ltepublican netvspapers through Ibe West
will have given to them fat plHces at.Washing
ton.vvlth vacations convnientlvarmnged with
regard to local connections. W ith aids such as
this tho Western politicians calculate that they .
cin brace up nnd f-olldify their power so that '
the Slates west or Pcnnsylvnnl.1 and north of
Missouri will remuln a- solidly Republican as
the bo'itb has been Democratic, while they ex- 1
pect also lomakea good rake In of additional I
power when the south goes to pieces politi
cally, as they expect that it will within a few I
years. The Hepubllcat.sof Missouri, Kentucky,
and Arkansas lire malnlygraduatos of the In
diana school ol hustlers, and their allegiance
will drift westward If they ever get theirstates
weaned away from Democracy.
'J he fact Is. the Western llepubllcans are fig
uring out a scheme for establishing within the 1
net lour ears a great national bossocrn-y, j
with headquarters In Indiana. It's a very good .
scheme if It works. It must be said Unit thus '

I Wo will havtinnjeeiilnc of the committee In a

I " 80 far ns the co-jalnct of the case before the
Commission Is conorrnd. I havo every ennfl-
1 dence In Mr. rnrnellitftl Sir Charles llnssell. 1
lielleve tbnt thoy will get n ralr verdict, too.
I The case may be unduly protracted, and n good
1 de.il of Immaterial testimony will doubtless get
In tinder the great latitude allowed tho com-
. mission. But the Judges will hne to go upon
I flio rcnl evidence, and I believe thut this is
vfbfst thev will do."
I bctiool Commissioner Miles O'Brien said that

"Thev are riniply trying to swamp Mr. Par-
, noil's financial lesouroes, said Mr. O'Brion.
1 "They haven't prodveed n stnglo tot of evi
dence implicating him at oil. It Mr. Parnell
1 should decide tn wlthdrnw from the case till
such evidence Is prodm-ed, he would bo warm
ly supported by ns. AVo intend to call a meet-

I Dr. William B. Wnllaco nnd other members

A Bleb Old Gentleman In Raltlmore Bobbed
oraswo.
I Baltimore, Dec. 2. A prominent retired
merchant was very neatly fleeced by confidence
men yesterday. Ho could only bo per
Auuded to lay tbe case before the police au
thorities late Inst night upon the understand
ing tbnt his name should not bo given out by
1 them until tbe rascal who -victimized him was
caught. Ho was robbed in a room In a board-
!inc houso on Pearl street, and Is now suffering
from nervounprostratlon. tho 1 esnlt of a violent
fistic encounter with one of tho men who was
I in tbo game.
! About IU o'clock cjeiday morning the old
gentleman started to leave hLs residence when J
lie was hailed by a young man who was driving
, a horso and buggy. A conversation followed,
and the stranger said his name was Uoberts
and that be was a nephew of a noll-known citi
zen and a son-lu-law of another, fie also said
ne was a clerk In n national bank, ana nad re-
I cently arrived from Colorado, where be repre
sented his lather-in-law In certain mercantile
transactions. Ho peistiaded the old gentle
man to get Into tne buggy ami rldo down nf far
as tho bank. While in the carriage Jio
young man told him thnt liu had lru
copies of Bancroft's History of the1
United States to cull for. One was Ills own
1 and the other hi lather-ln-liiw's. 1-urther, he
said his father-in-law already had one copy,
and ho would ttiru over the other to the old
' gentleman if he would go to the ngent's ofllco.
t Tbe bait was a good one and tho pair went to
' 121 Pearl street. Lnterlngthe Pivrlnr. they met
man No. 2. who said that the books wcru not
tbore, but would bo sent to their addiess on
Wednesdav. The couple gavo their names.
No. 2, addressing No. 1. then eaid that his
book bad dinwn a prize of SSI. No. 1 asked for
tbe money and got $50 He asked for the re
maining dollar, when No. i snid tbnt for this
amount he was entitled to two more tickets in
another drawing nothing to lose nnd all to
gain. No. 1 let the SI go lor tbe chances. The
old gentleman sat by all tbe while nnd took it
In. No. 'I then counted out eight cards, which
when added up counted thirty-three. No. 2
. said he bad drawn tli'. The other ticket he
presented to the old gentleman and asked him
tn draw. He did so, and tlie cards counted
thirty-nine. Nn. 2 then said it bad drHwn a
prize of J5.000. but he must have evidence that
the men were responsible or else be could not
pay them. They must have nn equal amount
, to show before It could be nald over. The old
gentle muii snid he could not draw a check, but
would get It,
He sent a friend to his home, who got fli.OOO
worth of bonds and then advanced t5fflj on
them. The money was turned ovor to the old
gentlemnn in the presence of No. 1. They then
went back to see No. 2. The money was tied
up and placed on tho table. No. 1 had the
money. No. 2 said ho must see if it was all
right, and started to count It with his back
turned. Suddenly he snid the amount was as
represented, and tying up tho bundlo replaced
It on the table,
Tba old gentleman did not tumblo to the
fact that a spurious roll had been shoved In
front of him, but appeared jubilant over his
drawing. No. 1 put the r.ill In his pocket, and
was so elated thnt he bOkJn to thumr the old
gentleman on tlie ohect nti'l congratulate blm
on his success. Finally tho ild gentleman be
came oxhaustod, his high hat Teas knocked on
the floor, and when ha recovered tho two men
wore gone. So were both bis nOney and the
spurious bundle of notes.
