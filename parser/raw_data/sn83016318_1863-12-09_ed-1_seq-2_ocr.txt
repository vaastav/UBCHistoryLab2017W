The W hile 3Ian In America.
TLc lecture of Chancellor JJavt-a, tQ this ub
jtct, on Wednesday ever.ing last, was a complete
euxe-n. lieore the Lour announced for the kc
lure, trj eat in the Representative Hill was
filled, and many came afterward and wer.t away.
A introductory to Li, subject, the lecturer
'.focM:d the 'ligation of the unity of the hu
man race, and came to the conclusion, on scien
tific ground exclusively, that there had been
but one creation of man, and that all the races
which exint, and which naturalist. Lave various
ly estimated frcm three to ixty three, or more,
in number, have arisen from individual differen
ce! in the original ancestors, modified by clima'e
and ether exterriil ir.fhje'.ces. lie showed the
immense variety existing throughout the animal
and vegetable king lorns; and that more varie
ties are constantly appearing, not by creations of
new leedi or animals, but by modification of
placU and animal already existing. New breeds
of ca'.tle, and of all domestic animals, different
from any known to our ancestors, are now com
mon all over the country; whih; gardeners and
fruit growers arc presenting us with specimens
almo't without number, of new fruit and flow
er. All varieties of wheat, he thought, must
have come from one a-ed ; and so of other
plant.
from the-e analogic, the lecturer argued that
ail the varieties of lueii, a wi li an of the plants
and animuN, ii.ust Lavi come from one Mock :
but aa som- of the. varieties were a distinctly
marked, 1 'Oo vc:irs ago, a they are now, a
shown by the paintings on the Egyptian tomb,
he admiu. d that the uiu.kiiid must have livd
on earth rii'i'h longer than is getiera'v pup
posed. Th; white- men of America came from Europe,
which I. inhabited by whit-: men exclusively :
an 1 the white meti of Kurope had their origin
in the neighborhood ot the Himalaya mountains.
This he argued from the similarity of plant, do
niestic animal and language. He regarded the
S.mscript a the original language of the Lite
man : and distinct traces of it were found in the
Latin and (ireek languages, a, well a thoe of
modern Europe.
The two principal varieties of the white men of
Europe were the Celt and the Teutons ; and al
most every white person in America was deacon
ded from one of these. Each of these vai ietics
have peculiar and, in same respects, opposite
trait of character. The Celts are impulsive,
volatile, move in masse, cluster together, love
to be ruled by a strong arm, and have great at
tachmcnU to individual men. The Celtic race
had produced O'Cuiinell and Napoleon. The
Celts are Catholic by nature, having great rev
erencc for authority : and tho Celtic nation of
Europe are all Catholic. Had Washington been
a Celt, he would have made himself Emperor :
had our fathers been Celts, they would have ia"
sisted on making him an Emperor.
The Teutons love individuality and personal
iudependeuce ; have less attachment to leaders;
will not follow them in great masses ; are jealous
of supreme sutho-i'v, and withdraw their allegi
ance, and divide up into small communities
Hence all Germany is cut up iuto little States :
and Eu gland retains her immense possessions, by
giving to each part an individuality of action
which amounts almost to independence. The
Teuton are Protestants by nature, and believe
ia individual judgment on religious matters.
The Teutonic nations of Europe are Protestants.
Everywhere the Teutons carry with thrin trial
by jury and religious toleration. They have also
a great repect for women; and the race ha
produced more noble women than all other ra
ces combined. Through the progress of these
two races, Europe for throe centuries, ha been
the heart and brain of the world.
The lecturer argued that these two leading
varieties of the white man will fuse together,
and produce a new rare, combining the charac
teristics of both, in a country having greater
natural advantages for human development than
any other. The new race he considered as al
ready established in its traits, o much so that
an American is immediately recognized in Eu
rope by hia characteristics. This raco will be
taller than others, more muscular, nervous, en
during, long lived, shrewd, enthusiastic, active,
prompt, practical, confident, deciding readily on
everything, and ready to give an opinion on any
abject. The lecturer touched very lightly on
the lartTs of Jonathan's character : and conclu
ded, that as every age has had but one leading
nation which has stamped its impre on that
ge, so this new race, thus formed by the union
of the Teuton and the Celt, will by it peculiar
traits, take the lead of all others.
Mr. Haven spoke an hour and a quarter, and
the discourse contained as great an amount of
facU, arguments and ideas, as could well be con
deosed into that period. He seems to know no
thing at all of the " spread eagle " style of elo
quence, or the art of using n-any words to say
nothing; and the promptness and confidence
with which be gave lus views on the numerous
topics presented, proved conclusively that be
had at least that characteristic of the rew race
of men which he described.

A Gold Watch for rtsiri5T Lirtcot v.
Mr. Hoes, of Chicago, offered a prize of a $50
gold watch to the largest contributor to the
great Sanitary Fair. It turns out that President
Lincoln was the largest contributor, his proclama
tion havirg brought $3,(v5 for the benefit of the
Fair. Accordingly, Mr. Hoes decides that the
the priie belongs to -v 3 President, and he sent
oa the watch last Saturday not a 50 watch,
but a magnificent one, worth $15t with this in
scription upon it: "Presetted to Abraham Lin
coln as a memorial from the Northwestern Sani
tary Fair, ia consideration of bis being the larg
est contributor to the enterprise."

ia wheir denunciation of underground rail

institution. Their tdares were wont to use

same holes in the ground that their slaves have
taken before them. How circumstances will
change one's opinion of things.

in the last days of the last session reqn'rk.g the
Clerk to place upon the roll of the House no
name save those which are certified to him a
having been d'.ly elected under the laws of the
State and of the Unit.-d States. The object of
this law was to prevent the possibility of tiiiii g
the House with bogus member from S juthera
States, who had never b-.cu really elected, but
might nevertheless present certitic it- s of Svrae
sort, and gala aJin'r-lo:. ia sull'jie:.. !:um'ers to

law required him to insist that cieh cert.2c.ite
should specify in this given forui that the mem
ber was elected according to the 1 1 of the .UA
and of the United Mat-.-s. No th: certiLca'es

the evils of an immense exo L.s of their people,

impossibility to provid- occupation f..riheiu, the
low price of !alor, and the scarcity of territory.
Compare i with our own oe.ritry, they pos,ssvd
slight room for future development ; they were
settled in every pirt, arid no vast territory lay
invitingly open to encourage enterprise and set

self support in countries like our own, whe'e an
illimitable territory waits to be developed, and
whore incalculable resources invite industry and

26th. sjieak of its being the twelfth day of the
siege Long-treet wa threatening an assault,
and the sice was causing some inconvenience
iu getting forag-. and considerable labor in for
tifying the po-itioii. No panic retreat, sana
tion, assault or investment had occurred. The
s'ege was cor.sid-red another rebel failure.
Th- in-tal f the m-n f both sides had b-n
b-s-ted. and our Western boy had 110 awe o'
Loug-treet's veterans. The daily skirmi-hing
was spirited and on several occasion very se
vere, with lively .h-!ling on both ',. n r
troop b.haved splendidly throughout. Our
I .,-' - had not -xc-ed. d three hundred in all.
Many of th- slightly wotindei! were returning
to duty.

ing party, led by the ICth and 17th Georgia
and lSt'u Mississippi, under cover of our own
retreating men, came to the asa!t. ap.
proach' d to within one hundred yard of th
fort unhaimed. Then ensued a scene of des
perate daring, stubborn resistance, death,
carnage urA horror, scarcely equaled during
the war. These men. veterans of the Roto
mac and the flower of Longtrcet's army, con
fident of the prorni-ed victory, plunged into
a hailing hell of lead. Wires Lad been stretch
ed from stump to stump, in front of the works,
by Capt Roe. Over these the advancing en

wounded around them. Our artillery meu
hurled shell by hand forward upon the fallen
and doomed rebel.
Hot and hotter came the storm of shells.
The ground over which they pased wa car
peted with the sla'n. The ditch was filled
with the dead, wounded and dying. Not one
