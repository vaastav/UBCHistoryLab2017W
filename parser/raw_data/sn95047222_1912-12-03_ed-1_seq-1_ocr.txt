The State department, an ar
c haic and inadequate niacin no, at
the beginning of this admin ist ration,
the president says, has become a new
organization, with highly socialized'
bureaus and experts dealin; with ev
ery phase of American trade and di
plomacy. Holding that the essencj
. . r . I
of this reorganized service is iuumu
in the merit system, which President
Cleveland is credited with having
introduced, President Taft makes A
strong appeal to Congress to make
this machine permanent, by givinj
the force of statutory law to the ex
ecutive orders governing admission
to and promotion in the diplomatic
and consular services.
To show that these appointments
are already largely non-partisan, tha
president points to the fact that
three of the present ambassadors are
hold overs; that of the ten he has
appointed, five were by promotion
from the rank of minister; that of
the thirty ministers appointed, elev
en were promotions; and that in the
consular serTice no less than 35 per
cent of the consuls appointed by him
were from the southern States.
"The diplomacy of the present ad
ministration has sought to respond
. . . i. .
been a vigorous assertion, aiso, lie
savs. of the equal right of the United
States to a voice in all questions per
taining to Chinese loans and devel
opments.
President Taft makes the direct
charge that the terrible events re
corded in Nicaragua recently, the
useless loss of life, the devastation of
property, tho bombardment of the
principal cities, the killings and tho
tortures and suffering, "might hava
been averted had the department of
State, through approval of the loan
convention by the Senate, been per
mitted to carry out its now well de
veloped policy."
"In central America the aim has
been to help such countries as Nic
aragua and Honduras to help them
Hhes," says President Taft.
While they are the immediate,
beneficiaries, the profit to the United
Slates is two-fold, be adds. The Mon
roe doctrine is more vital in the
neighborhood of the Panama canal,
and such countries should be re
lieved of the jeopardy of heavy for
eign debts likely to provoke inter
national complications.
Thp financial rehabilitation of
these countries by American bank
ers and the protec tion of their cus
toms houses from being the prey of
would-be. dictators, says the presi
dent, would remove the menace of
foreign creditors and revolutionary
disorder. Furthermore, the Cnited
States would profit largely in a busi
ness way through the development
o' the great natural resources of
Central America.
Comtmending the successful results
of the application of the new neu
trality laws to Mexico and other
troubled countries, the president sug
alter all. a good one.
