The Alternative ta the Heath-The Deafer* nf
Detajr.
The idea*, we are inclined to think, which
carried the Southern Statea into their late re
bellion, and for which they fought through four
disastrous years of civil war with an earnest
ness, unity and tenacity of purpose without a
parallel in the history of revolutions, are ideas
which will control the publio mind of those
States at least until the existing generation
shall have passed away. The vicissitudes of
nations, dynasties and parties back to the
twilight of tradition will justify this opinion.
The evidence before us In regard to the pre
vailing tone and temper of Southern sentiment,
from the Potomac to the Rio Grande, leads also
to this conclusion. It would Indeed be absurd
to suppose that the political dogmas, sectional
and class distinctions and prejudioes of caste
and oolor assiduously cultivated for two hun
dred years have, to any great extent, been
eradicated from the Southern mind with their
overthrow in an appeal to arms against the
conflicting ideas of the North; bnt it is utterly
preposterous to suppose that the triumphant
party in this war of ideas and this revolution
can be persuaded to surrender the legitimate
fruits of the victory it has achieved.
In laying down their arms the insurgent
States submitted to the fortunes of war and the
law of necessity; bnt they made no surrender
not exacted by necessity. From the generous
terms of Southern restoration flrst proposed
by President Johnson he doubtless expected
the best results; but in estimating the under
lying forces and the issues of the rebellion too
lightly he expected too much. His well meant
diagnosis, too, In which he treated the recon
quered States as provinces wrested from a
foreign power, while holding them as States
reverting to their status before the war, cre
ated most of the confusion regarding them
which has followed. Thus it has occurred
that only by the intelligent popular
verdict of the Northern Sta tes in the
recent elections has even Congress been
brought to a broad and consistent understand
ing of the case. Hence, however, with the re
assembling of Congress, not only is a resolu
tion reaffirming the ultimatum of the constitu
tional amendment passed by an overwhelming
majority, but other measures are initiated,
looking at the excluded States as unorganized
Territories, in consequence of their rebellion.
Now, with the abundant proofs resulting
from President Johnson's policy of confidence
in the South, that the minds of that people
have been alienated by the late war from the
government of the United States, that they do
not like it, that they do not want it and that
they do not intend to accept the easy terms of
the constitutional amendment, bat that they are
combined against it because they supposed
their consent to he essential to ita ratification,
what are we to think ? Does it not appear that
the Southern managing politicians still expect
thus to bring about in the North, with the aid
of the copperhead faction, snob a conflict of
parties and factions and such a state of politi
cal confusion and demoralization aa will give
them another and a golden opportunity, In
some new shape, for the re rival of their
Southern confederacy f
In several of the Southern journals now be
fore as not only Is this broadly suggested, bnt
also the quarter from which this relief is to
come. The Charleston Mercury of the 5th in
stant, for example, in discussing the President's
message, touobing upon "the policy of the
radicals to rule the Southern States as pro
vinces," says "it is perfectly plain that this
policy cannot be oarried out in the South,
so long as President Johnson is faithful to the
principles he has avowed. Laws made by two
thirds of Congress, to be of any avail, must he
enforced. The President alone has the
power of executing them. If he thinks them
unconstitutional, and they are passed
nevertheless over his veto by Congress,
he has then to judge and determine whether
it is his duty to enforce unconstitutional
laws." From this and similar hints from other
quarters we are left to infer that a conflict be
tween Congress and the President is waited
for by the ruling Southern politicians- as their
opportunity for a great deliverance. We be
ltevo that this conflict will not occur?that the
President will not make himself a party in the
creation of another civil war, notwithstanding
the apparent desire and purpose of the more
violent radicals, as well as of Southern implacs
btcs and Northern copperheads, to push him to
this extremity.
Pleading still only the law of necessity, we
must yet again repeat to the responsible people
of the excluded States that Congress has their
destiny in its hands; that their plain policy o(
safety is the constitutional amendment; that
delay involves the harsher remedy of a Terri
torial treatment; that the war has settled this
fact?that in the work of reconstruction the
Southern ideas must give way to the practical
application of the Northern ideas of the war:
that the late elections have indicated the duty
of the President, and that there is no danger
that be will provoke a conflict in which he
would have nothing to gain but everything to
lose; and, Anally, that neither President nor
Congress, if so inclined, could shake the fixed
purpose of the Union soldiers of the war under
fltjigral Gram to h^ld the l|tely Insurgent
States at least to ttt terms of the constitu
tional amendment. That, or something much
worse, is the manifest destiny of the Houth,
because it is the fixed purpose and the right
result1 ng to the North from a four years'
bloody war upon the comprehensive issue
whether African slavery and its appendages,
or the Union and its restraints, should be broken
to pieces.
Tax Govkrvou or Alabama on ma Sitba
Ttoa?StoNtncAKT Chakqk or Base.?We per
ceive that tome of the Southern Governors are
l?eginning to look intelligently upon the con
stitutional amendment Governor Patton, of
Alabama, who was rigidly set against the
amendment a short time since, baa now, it ap
pears, sent a special message to the Legislature
of that nuts recommending its adoption. He
takes the general view so frequently urged by
us?that the South had better accept the proposal
of 0?ngre?s as embraced in the amendment in
lie-i of harsher terms which may yet be im
posed. He looks to the future action of
flat 'hern representatives in Congress to
rnlt gate its severity, list vert wisely read*
in the pn-se.it ronsiiiutlon if that body
and the verdict of the North at the
recent elections an evidenoe that oo milder
alternative will Ire offered. But Governor
Patton. like many other Houthefn politicians,
m u.'-ud jm-j'*.'of ?t ug *?!?at it
requires three-fourths of the vote* of oil the
States to ratify the intendment, where** three
fourths of the Stow* represented in Congress
are sufficient; therefore when Governor Pnttoa
talks about a concurrence on the part of all
the Southern States being necessary to give the
measure praotioal effeot, he evidently does not
fiilly understand the question.
Unfortunately the Alabama Legislature has
not viewed the interests of the 3outh in the
Bame light as Governor Patton, nor has it kept
pace with his progressive convictions thst the
constitutional amendment is the beet and final
offer that will be made to the South; for both
houses hsve decided in a rash and hssty man
ner that the amendment shall be rejected by
Alabama.
The change of base which Governor Patton
has annonnood may yet be adopted by other
Southern leaders. It is at least a significant
sign that the subject is being entertained in
the light of common sense by men of promi
nent standing, however stupidly the Legisla
ture of Alabama may deal with it.
Tka Nattaint Deb* sad Our National Taxa
tion*.
No motions have yet been introduced in
Congress relating to financial aftdrs, and we
are therefore in Ignoranoe of what measures
may be adopted upon that most important sub
ject. It is stated that members of the Ways and
Means Committee and of the Finance Com
mittee of the Senate have recently been in
council with the Secretary of the Treasury, and
that a majority of both committees will proba
bly concur with such financial measures as Mr.
McCulloch may propose. The oommittees,
however, do not essentially govern the action
of Congress. It would appear from our pre
sent immense revenue that, even under the
loose financial system of the Treasury Depart
ment, the public debt, which has been reduced
to a little over two thousand millions, could be
paid off within a period of fifteen or eighteen
years; but it becomes questionable whether
the present generation should have to bear the
whole burden of the debt thus incurred by any
hasty legislation of Congress. The war for
the suppression of the rebellion was fought not
alone for the benefit of the existing generation,
but for those who are to succeed the men who
bore the brunt of the fight and made great
personal sacrifices to maintain the government
against its enemies. It seems but fair, then,
that the weight of taxation should be dis
tributed so as to bear to some extent upon
those who are to come after us, and for whom
the present generation saved the country
from perdition. We are now not only paying
heavy taxes npon everything that we consume,
and taxes upon our incomes, but we have to
submit to a system of fraudulent prices in
every item of domestic use?provisions and
textile fabrics which comprise the necessaries
of life. These prices were created by
the war, and they must be regarded as a
portion of the burden which the war has im
posed upon us. The quality of the materials
furnished to the people at these exaggerated
values has also deteriorated at the rate of some
thirty-five per cent, making the grievance still
less endurable.
Under these circumstances it seems more
equitable that the period for the full liquida
tion of the public debt should be extended, so
as to lessen the pressure of taxation. With
such vast resources as the Treasury has at its
command there is no necessity fbr overloading
the people with national taxations in the thou
sand shapes which at present embarrass
them. It would be better to defer the final
liquidation of the national debt to fifty years
hence than to maintain the aystem now recom
mended in order to liquidate it within fifteen
or twenty years?a system which offers constant
Inducements to fraud, aa the proceedings in
our courts are every day developing. We trnat,
then, that Congresa will take a fair, liberal and
sagacious view ot our financial affairs in any
legislation which they may adopt npon the
subject.
The Evacuation or Mexico.?The doubts in
spired by the change in the French programme
in regard to Mexico, and which led to the long
cable despatch from the State Department to
Mr. Bigeiow. have been set at rest by the
answer of that gentleman. He states that he
has it in writing from the French Minister ol
Foreign Affairs that there is no change in the
Emperor's resolution, but that upon military
considerations he has deemed it expedient to
substitute one comprehensive evacuation for
an evacuation in several parts. All the French
troops, he adds, will leave Mexico in the month
of March. It is well to have this definite
assurance. Although the peculiarly critical
situation of the French, spread as they arc
over a considerable extent of territory, was
in itself a sufficient motive for a change in the
plan, the absence of a specific explanation to
that effect had excited doubts in the minds of
many as to whether there were not other
and more equivocal reasons for the delay.
It was indeed openly asserted that his im
perial Majesty was waiting for something
to turn up to render the fhlfilment of his
pledge unnecessary. A difficulty with England
in regard to the Alabama claims, the probable
execution of the Fenian prisoners in Canada
and the malcontent condition of the South
were each and allt suggested as influencing
this hesitation. More recently still the de
parture of Miramon for Mexico was dwelt
upon as a fact significant of trouble. We
ourselves entertained no anxiety on the
subject. However much Napoleon might
have liked to profit by the eventualities in
question, and admitting even that they had
modified his arrangements, we felt satisfied
that the result would be the same. There was
nothing sufficiently substantial in any of them
to justify the belief that a shrewd mind like his
would allow Itself long to be influenced by
them. But leaving out of the question any
lingering hopes that the Emperor might have
entertained on these points, there is really, it
seems to us, good ground for the exfeosion of
time which he claims. Were be to push for

Two Mobs Nbw .Status.?A caucus of repub
Iroan Senators took piaoe on Friday last, oalled
expressly to oonsult with regard to the admis
sion of Colorado and Nebraska into the Union.
Although no formal question was taken-it was
agreed that the bills for this purpose should
be called up early this week. Nebraska has
already the population requisite for admission
as a State, and inasmuch as the alleged de
ficiency of Colorado in this respect is being
supplied by the dally influx of emigration, and
particularly as she presents herself at the doors
of Congress la no questionable shape?at least
not in a shape likely to be challenged rudely
by a republican majority, fbr she has already
elected two Senators, and a member of the
right stripe?there is little doubt that this
flaw in her title will not long delay her ad
miasoa.
Besides these two new States, Colorado and
Nebraska, it is probable that at least Ave
more?Washington, Idaho, Dakota, Arizona
anfl New Mexico?will be added to the Union
before the expiration of two years. As to
Utah, it must wait a while longer, until
thoroughly purged of lurking treason, the'
mysteries, superstitions and alleged abomina
tions of eoclesiastical despotism, and particu
larly the poison of polygamy. Secret assasi
nation must also be abolished. The Saints
must lean that murder and architecture are
not the only fine arts, and that till the gronnd
and kill your (Gentile^ neighbor is not the
only commandment. When Utah shall thus
have become purified sod enligthened ita
population will reap unmixed advantages from
their admirable system of organized emigra
tion and industry. Moreover, its position as a
State lying on the line of the great Pacific
Railroad will insure to it incalculable ad
vantages.
The erection of these vast Territories, one
after another, into mighty and populous States,
together with the rapid development of their
agricultural resources and untold mineral
wealth, are astonishing illustrations of the
expansive grandeur of our American empire.
And they significantly suggest to the student
of our political history how speedily the hour
is approaching when, slavery and other irri
tating causes of antagonism betw een the few
Southern States and the few New England
State having been wholly removed, even
these extreme sections will forget their old
fanatical whims and hates, and, shorn of the
strength which used to be the arrogant boast
and the temptation of each, will modestly
wheel into harmonious union with the other
States. Neither the Southern States, however
reconstructed, nor the New England States
will then be able to dispute the supremacy of
the Central States and the States of the great
West, which mast hold the balance of power,
ahaping the policy and directing the destiny
of oar imperial republic.
Women's Rights.? During the war we heard
bat little of the women's rights movement.
The reason, we presume, was that if the theory
of equality of rights with the men had been too
energetically pushed it might have bean as
sented to on the oondition that the fair sex
should do its share of the fighting. Now that
the war is over and that there is no danger of
this disagreeable preliminary being insisted
upon, there are indications of an intention to
actively commenoe the agitation again. This
is hardly fair. Rqual rights imply equal obli
gations, and we see no reason .why If the one
is to be ooncoded the other should not be en
forced. But perhaps the fair leaders of the
movement think they are fully qualified in this
regard, on the ground that they do all their
flghting at home. If tiioy do they should let us
know it, inasmuch as it will enable us to recon
cile an apparent inconsistency in their* posi
tion.
