SPIRIT OF JUFFERSON.
CHAH1.18TOWN, JBTFXHSOU COOHTT, W. Va.
TUESDAY HORNING. DECEMBERII. 1888.
It may be that our friends have
concluded that a newspaper can be
run without money, and we must con
fess that present appearances do make
it look as if they had really come to
that conclusion. We would like to
disabuse their minds in this regard,
however, and would seriously remind
them that it does take money to run a
newspaper, also a good deal of it, and
that cash down every week. Just at
this time we need a little more than
usual, but our receipts are working
just the other way, and we are getting
less. Our people have been blessed
with good crops of all kinds, and in
their prosperity should not forget
therr obligations to the printer. We
therefore hope they will heed this gen
tle reminder, and call at the Spirit
office and settle their dues.
The question of adopting a registra
tion law in this State is being advo
cated.
The Wheeling Register sends out a
Yery handsome mammoth calendar
for 1889, for a copy of which we re
turn thanks.
Thanks to Capt. Jas. H. O'Ban
non, Superintendent of Public Print
ing of Virginia, for a copy of his
Annual Report.
Major-General Romeyn B. Avers,
of the U. S. Army, died on Tuesday
at Ft. Hamilton, N. Y. He married
a daughter of our former countyiuon
R. Hume Butcher.
The Republican commissioners of
Kanawha county, have thrown out
enough Democratic votes to clecf
McGinnis, Republican, to Congress
by 23 majority. The matter will be
taken to the Circuit Court by the
Democrats.
The Martinsburg Statesman has
been sold to Messrs. D. C. Westen
baner and C. W. Boyer. We extend
our best wishes to the retiring editor,
Capt. W. B. Colston, and extend to
the new purchasers a hearty welcome
to the journalistic circle.
Col. Samuel Spencer has been re
elected President of the Valley Rail
road, which extends from Harrison
burg to Lexington. At his own sug
gestion his salary was reduced from
$2,000 to $100! Col. W. M. Clements
of the B. & O. was appointed man
ager at $300 per annum.
The United State J government has
ordared several^^^ftr war steamers
to proceed back the de_
seized at Port ai
tien provisional
Hrce by the Hay
criunent. ?
Arrests by the Federal authorities
for illegal voting still continue in
?Wheeling. So far eight persons, all
Republicans, have been tafcea into
custody, and many additional war
rants are out. In Mercer connty,
where the Republican majority
reached proportions plainly indicating
fraud, the grand jury has returned
700 indictments for illegal voting.
In"another column will be found a
tableof the popular vote for President.
It will be seen that Cleveland has a
total of 487,617 votes; Harrison has
?473,054. Were the President elect
ed directly by the people instead of
by the electoral college, President
Cleveland would be his own succes
sor by 14,063 plurality; but as it i9,
Mr. Harrison is the President-elect
by a majority of 65 electoral votes.?
It isn't always the majority that rules,
you see, as 14,063 more votes were
cast for Cleveland than for Harrison.
The President's message is a strong
document, and is sound on the tariff
question. He not only fails to indi
cate a single regret for his previous
course on this subject, but fortifies
and reiterates what he has before
enunciated, and declares that '? any
intermediary between the people and
their government, or the least delega
tion of the care and protection the
government owes to the humblest cit
izen in the land, makes the boast of
free institutions a glittering delusion
and the pretended boon of American
citizenship a shameless imposition."
The Canadian fisheries question, the
Sackville case, the Haytien outbreak
and other matters, are treated in an
able aud statesman-like manner.
The Mouroe Watchman thinks ** The Dem
ocrats of the West Virginia House of Delegates
should honor themselves by electing Col- R. P,
Chew, of Jefferson county, to the Speakership
There is not a more courageous, able and hon
able man in the Legislature, nor one so well
fitted to discharge the duties of this important
position. He h:\f> always been on the side oj
the people, and at the last session of the leg
islature was conspicuous among the supporter!
of the bills prohibiting discriminations iti rail
road charges, prohibiting the free pass bribery,
and providing for the reform of our tax laws.
AUof these measures, in which the welfare ol
the State" is profoundly interested, were suspi
ciously defeated in the last Legislature. Thcj
will be re-introduced at this session, and it ii
important to the people that one of Colone'
Chew's stamp and known convictions should
preside during their consideration. Elect Chew
Speaker by all means." The Jefferson people
will b? gratified by the complimentary tcrmi
in which the naUhman refers to Col. Chew anc
would be pleased to see him elevated to th<
Speakership of the House of Delegates. He ii
a man of ability and has the courage of hii
convictions, and would dlguify the Chair.

An Atrocious Lie.
[From the 3bepberdstown Register.]
The following article appeared in
the Phiadelpkia Press of Friday last:
Siiephekdstowx. W. Va.. Not. 38.?TbUU
one of the places In West Vlrgluia where it wau
dangerous for a Republican to rote. The town
and county are entirely under the control ol
the Democrats. Before the election they made
threats that they would allow no negroes tc
vote unless thev voted the Democratic ticket,
or at least for Free-trader William L. Wilson,
for Congress. On election day James Roblnc
[Robinson], who bad a little more courage than
other members of his race, went to the polli
and said be would vote despite their protests.
One of the Democrats caught bim by the back
of the neck and jerked him away. He was
driven from the place and colored men gener
ally made themselves scarce after that. A
number of heelers from Baltimore and Wash
ington were brought np on the train and after
voting stood around and solicited votes from
the residents of the town. Thomas R. Ray
fJohn R. Ray], one of the oldest Republican!
a Jefferson County, watched these people vot
ing. During the daj' he took the names ol
twenty-five men whom he knew to be residents
of Baltimore and Washington. The friends ol
Free-trader Wilson threw thousands of dollars
into the district and Shepherdstown got con
siderable of this.
The night before election twenty men were
picked up on the streets by the Democrats,
taken to the office of a prominent gentleman
and kept drunk until after the polls closed on
election day. Five of these men have since
declared their willingness to make an affidavit
to the effect that they were locked in the room
until it was too late to vote. A band of moun
taineers who rode up to Harper's Ferry voting
district came here aleo and in the same man
ner put in their votes. They came from the
direction of Shenandoah, and it is alleged that
they voted there, as there are only a few voters
ill that district, but the vote was 95 Democrats
and 4 Republicans. This district has thirty
colored men, yet only four Republican ballot's
were cait.
At the Shepherdstown votlne place before
the polls closed some of the ballot-boxes were
removed ro the office of Joseph Bragonler. a
Democratic lawyer, and the contents counted
there. H hen the polls closed the rest of the
ballots were taken over and counted. James
D Favman. one of the clerks of the board, in
speaking of the matter said: *' The board left
about twenty ballots in the box. so that, if
there were too many ballots they could easily
dispose of thorn. When we finished counting
there were five ballots more than there were
voters, and five Republican votes were thrown
out."
Mr. Faj'man. John R. Roy and J. 8. Fleming
have made affidavit to the fact that the ballot
boxes were removed.
United States Senator Faulkner lives at Mar
tinsbure. Berkeley county. The night before
the election he had a number of colored and
white Republicans from the city taken out to
a house in the country, where a dance was
given them. They were kept there until the
next, morning and liquors of all kinds flowed
freely As a result there were a number of
Republican votes missing the next day This
ruse did not. however, prevent Mr. Faulkner's
county, hitherto Democratic, el vine a Repub
lican plurality, thoueh the United States Sena
tor stood at the polls all day and worked for
his ticket.
A more outrageous set of lies were
never perpetrated on a community
than are contained in tlio above arti
cle. It is false in its statements and
false in its implications. There was
never a fairer, a more quiet or a more
orderly election held in Shepherds
town than that of the Bth of Novem
ber last. Not one person who de
sired to vote was intimidated or re
strained from doing so, and every
one legally entitled to the privilege
was allowed to cast his vote to suit
himself. The article is a lie in full,
and it is a lie in detail.
The following card, written by Mr.
J. S. Fleming and endorsed by
Messrs. Fayraan ajid Ray, is certainly
all the denial necessary so
arc concerned:
especially my Den
[ fullyv traduced. 8<
scarcely a scintilla ol WUWTOi the w
It is stated that Jas. P. Fayman. John
and myself made affidavit tbut the t.?Uot boxes
were removed. The facts are as follow? : Jas.
D. Fayman made an affidavit before me as No
tary. substantially as follows: That be bad
challenged five persons as non-residents, who
were allowed to vote by the Commissioners, and
that the ballot boxes were taken to the office of
J. S. Brafconier and counted. .Ttio. R.'Rsiyand
myself certified to the correctness of that ?
Nearly every voter knows that tit every election
here since we have had a Board of Cauvassers
the ballot boxes have been taken to another
place and counted. I served as a canvasser at
three different elections. The ballots were al
ways counted at another place. I was present'
at tho la?t election, and when the count was
finished there wan only two (2) ballots In the
box, when the number equal to the votes had
been couuted; these were uot unfolded at the
time.
As to the threats made or the statement that
it was dangerous for a Republican to vote, I
only have to say that J hare lived here nearly
50 years and every one knows I am a Republi
can. but the article abQve mentioned is the first
I heard of any threats. There was no intim
idation. no violence, and 1 am satisfied every
one entitled to vote had the privilege of doing
po unmolested. There were no mountaineers
who rode from Harper's Ferry or any where
else and voted here. The statement about Jas.
Robinson being jerked back and driven from
tho place is entirely without foundation, ns is
also the statement that twenty men were picked
up on t!i^i streets before election by the Demo
crats and kept in durance until too late to vote.
In conclusion let me say that the other gon
tlcmcn. both Commissioners and Canvassers,
need no vindication at my hands. They are
gentlemen above reproach, and would not be
a party to any snch proceedings referred to in
the article of the Press.
There was a differenceof opinion among the
Commissioners as to the qualification of a few
voters. I supposed the affidavit of Mr. Fay
inan to test, that question, or I should not have
certified to it. although the facts as there Ftated
arc known to all.
Respectfully Yours. ttc..

It gives us pleasure to print, in
addition to the above, the following
letter from Towner Schley. Esq., a
life-long Republican, but a gentleman
who cannot see his home slandered
without entering his protest:
Mr. Editor? I suppose my loyalty and polit
ical proclivities are established beyond cavil as
a pronounced working Republican, and the
further fact that I was present the entire day
at the late election in 8heplicrdstown. working
and voted for Harrison. Morton. Flick, and the
gallant Goff. and while a Republican from
principle, I cannot remain dumb to the gross
misrepresentations and prevarications of truth
published in the Philadelphia Prt*s of the80th
ultimo, regarding the actions of my Demo
cratic friends and neighbors at the late'election.
I: is true that the canvassers counted the votes
in J. S. Bragonier's office, but the same thing
lias been done at every erection held iu Sbep
herdstown fo* several years, and it is well
known that the gentlemen conducting the late
election arc men of irreproachable characters
and would not be gallty of intentional frand.
As to the charge of th?*ats and driving voters
from the polls, it is a dc.iberate falsehood. X
never saw a fairer election >j0 voter was in
terrupted from casting his biotas hedesired.
Good order prevailed tho entire ?\ay# As to the
charge of 20 voters being kept night in a
prominent man's office and kept fnwtj voting,
it is equally false and absurd. IfS^trne %
number of voters from Baltimore und ^MW
ington came here to vote, some of whom v^tgl
the Republican ticket, and the same pmrtTV^
have been voting iu Shcpherdgtown at past
elections. In conclusion I condemn in totothe
article alluded to as slanderous, unmanly and
a gross misrepresentation of facte.
Yours, Ac..
Towkkr 8chl*t.
