evildence That D'. Graves Intimltated
Mle. larnaby and MIad Absolute.
Mastery Over Her.
Dravaa, Dec. 10,--Is the larnaby trial
to-day Mrs. .r 5; Worrell ias .alled to the
stand, tihe became acquaittd wdth Mrs.
Barltiby in ldinburgh, S0otland, in 1884.
She 'accompanied her on ter OCaliforhia
tour at the letter's request. Witness went
on 0 q tatethat he arived int Denver with
Mrs. Barnaby in July, and both attended
tIre wedding of young Barnaby. From here
they, went to San Francisco and from this
place witness returned to' Denver alone,
April 9. Mrs. Barnaby was met by a woman
in San Francisco who recommended her to
a doctor. The witness thought it very
strange and spoke to the clerk of the hotel
about it, but Mrs, Barnaby decided to re
main and be treated by this doctor. Wit
ness left her with Mrs. Fisher and departed
for Denver, arriving here April I. Witness
told that there was a package here for
Mrs. Barnaby. After they returned from
the ranch on the day they took the fatal
fluid, Mrs. Barnaby said she was tired and
thought a little fine old whisky would help
her. She made two toddies and witness
took one and drank it. She exclaimed,
"It's vile stuff," but Mrs. Barnaby drank
here and finally said, "it is poor stuff."
Then witness became ill. Her son hurried
in and told her she should not have drank
before dinner. Witness vomited and be
came unconscious until two o'clock next
morning. She could not keep anything on
her stomach. Witness was able to take solid
food when Dr. Graves arrived from the east,
and'when Mrs. Barnaby's body was taken
east a few days later, she was able to go to
the depot with the party. She knew when
Mrs. Banaby was here in January that she
received medicine from'Graves,. which came
through the mail, and which was for rheum
atism, and when they were in California
she had on various occasions received let
ters and papers. She first met Mrs. Barn
aby in Eurons, in 1884, and traveled with
her three months. She afterward visited
her at Providence on several occasions, un
til three years later, when they had a slight
misunderstanding' and their relations ceased
for a short time, after which their friend
ship was renewed. -
When witness made her last ,visit to
Providence she noticed that relations be
tween Mr. and Mrs; Jrnab;"wer9 ,yvery
much strained;, a'id.ndeavored to make
pace between- them, but iailed.'" hq" tqld
this toa reporter for one of, the Boston
papers, and also ihformed him that Mrs.
Barnaby had left in her will $50,000 to Dr.
Graves. She admitted that Mrs. Barnaby
told her that Dr. Graves was the one who
advised her to contest her husband's will,
and on one occasion she said if she did not
take her business out of the doctor's hands
she soon would be ruined. When Mrs.
Barnaby and witness were traveling through
California she used to write to Dr. Graves
regularly, sending him her kindnest regards
and expressing satisfaction at everything he
did, and aled keeping him informed as to
her movements. Witness left California
before Mrs. Barnaby, who arrived in Den
ver two weeks later, and found .the bottle
supposed to contain whisky awaiting her.
Mrs. Worrell then related the story of the
death of Mrs. Barnaby, heretofore given in
these dispatches.
Evidence was then introduced by the
introduced by the prosecution to show that
Graves always intimidated Mrs. iarnaby
and threatened to have a guardian ap
pointed to take care of her unless she did
absolutely what he said. The execntors of
the estate denied that they advised D'.
Graves to take this course. William H.
Wood, one of the executors, was called and
stated that Mrs. Barnaby had been left
$100,000 by her husband's will. Several
sums were paid to Mrs. Barnaby, but the
creater part had been paid to either Dr.
Graves or Mr. Ballou.
Hanged Himself by the Neck.
GRnAND RAPins, Dec. 16.-Henry Marshal
1 Kinaman, until recently vice--president and
cashier of the First National bank of
Chicano, committed suicide here to-day by
hanging. He was compelled eighteen
t months ago to give up business on account
of ill health, aoide to Alma, Mioh., for
treatment. In September last friends pre
vented an attempt to out his throat with a
razqr. iecently be. had been living with
his cousin, Mrs. Frank Chanin, here. The
remains will be taken to Dubuque, Iowa,
for interment, the deceased having been
born there. It is thought his brain was
affected by his disease, nervous prostration.
The Driver Suspected.
C oAno oDec. 16.-To-day brought only
faint clues to the perpetrators of last night's
sensational mail robbery. The booty is
now estimated at $2,500. An interesting
statement was made by a woman who was f
attendina a wake in the house on the corner 1
of the alley where the robbery was com. 1
mitted. She says she saw the mail wagon
tunn into the alley, but saw no robbers.
The inference is that Driver Creighton
went into the alley of his own accord. The
police accept this as evidence that Creigh- I
ton was not altogether ignorant of the am- I
bush.

sainful they are not dangerous. Judge
Clark is the commander of the G. A. 1. de

Interview With the Pope.
ROME, Dec. 16.-The Temps prints an ac
count of ah interview with the pope on the
French ecclesiastical question. According
to the account the pope said his aim was to
encourage the policy of conciliation, and e
he would have been better pleased if the
letter of the archbishop of Aix had been an
isolated manifestation of opinion. He was
much affected by the attacks made on the
French pilgrims in Rome and pained to 8
learn that the pilgrimages of French Catho
lics were stopped by ministerial order. The
French government, he thought, erred in d
prosecuting the archbishop of Aix. Minister
Falliers ought simply to have written a n
trenchant reply. Pmosecution of the arch- a
bishop, instead of promoting peace between 8
the state and church, tended to cause A
enmity. tl

COMMITTEE ON RULES.
A lSeturn to Foriher Practice-Excellent
Selections by the Speaker.
t WAsmNrob, Dee. 16.--The appointment
3 of the house committee on rules is regarded
by members of the hous, as a return to the
former policy of appointing the members of
this committee without reference to their t
I other committee assignments. MoMillin,
D one of the new members of the rules com
e mittee, is` prominent as a tariff reformer
I and was one of the most active members of
t the ways and means committee, ie says,
n however, that he is in favor of the appoint
ment of Mills as chairman of the last
named committee. MoMillin's selection I
as member of the rules committee is
ascribed to his parliamentary ability, his I
effectiveness as a debater and the fact that n
he personally is very well liked by meambers
of the democratic side, and will, therefore, I
3 be of great assistance in securing the har- n
mronious adjustment of any differences
which maiy eripe aq to the party policy. Y

tempt to put down public sentiment, but
the whole matter will be inforumally under
stood and acquiesced in before the conven
tion gets down to work." In regard to a
letter of declination from Blaine, Colonel
Conger said there is nothing in it. "Theie
is no reason why Blaine should write a let
ter now," he continued, "or until the nom
ination is tendeled him, and in that event,
under the 'plan on which the committee
proposes to work, he certainly could not de
cline. Neither could Harrison nor any
other man who may be selected."
Chairman Clarkson, of the national re
publican committee, and members of the
committee spent the day looking over the
exposition building and consulting with the
architect as to its remodeling to meet the
needs of the convention. Clarkson said
Blaineis feeling better than he had in many
years. As to whether Blaine would run
again he declined to be quoted. He
thought the defeat of Mills settled Cleve-"
land a chances. Iowa, he said, is republi
can on national issues.

.IT'rn,, Dec. 16.-f 8peciai,]-For hours
to-day it looked as though a mob of deter
mined citizens would march en masse out
to Meaderaille and tear to pieces the works
of the Boston and Montana company. The
ofty struggled between riot and law, but
law finally won the day. Last night dodgers
flooded the city calling people to a mass
meeting to be held in front of the city hall
at nine o'clock this morning. Knots of
men began gathering in the streets as soon
as the light faintly shone through the pall
of smoke that illed the city--for the sun
did dot rise in Butte to-day, and was never
seen. The feeling was intensely bitter and
mutterings were heard on every hand against
the company. But the city authorities had
already taken the matter in their own
hands, and late last night, having received
no satisfactory answer from President Bige
low, of the company, at Boston, Mayor
Muelier engaged Contractor Winters to
begin the work in the morning of covering
the five heaps, whose sulphurous smoke has
for a week been killing people in Butte.
unndreds of people filled the -streets in
front of tbe city bhal at ine ;'olook this
Beford anytiing;ash had bea4 decided

were already twork bovering `the heaps.

a and (heir neighbors. George W, Irvine,
ex.United Stats.e arshal, ýexhorted the
crowd to let the city government
N act, expressing the utmost confidence
a. that the smoke' would be disposed of as
soon as possible. Representatives of the
); Boston and Montana had, meanwhile, been
exhorting the mayor to cover up the heaps
as soon as possible, for if the mob once
started for their works not a building would
t be left standing. The mob decided to give
the mayor three hours in which to get to
work, and meanwhile adjourned. One
hundred and thirty-six men are at work to
s night covering the heaps with dirt and
work will codntinue day and night until all
e are covered.
o It is estimated that 75,000 tons of ore are 1
e burning. The state of feeling may be im- 1
agined from the fact that eight deaths oc- t
ourred in the city to-day and there were 1
five funerals. During the first nine days of I
this month, when there was no heap roast
ing and no smoke, there were eleven deaths,
while during the past six days, with the
heaps burning, there have beeli*twenty-one
deaths.
In the district court to-night Judge Mo
Hatton granted a permanent injunction re
straining the Boston & Montana company
from roasting ore in heaps,. The judge said g
all people have the right to pure air. The i
comoany was cited to show cause why it I
should not be punished for contempt for a
not abating the nuisance under the tempo
rary injunction.
