MORE MAY BE FOUND ALIVE

Briceville, Teun., Dec. 13.—Stricken
Insane, probably from fear Inspired by
their plight, two miners who had been
with the jarty of five rescued alive,!
are now dashing wildly in and out of I
channels in the far recesses of the
the
Brioeville
mine in which it Is
lieved, 100 victims of Saturday's ex
plosion are still entombed. All night
long men of the rescue squad chased
the maniacs, but just as soon as the
would-be rescuers couid get close on
their trail the madmen dash away
screaming wildly. First they scurry
like rats down the main entry, theu
scamper away into black recesses of
the mine at the approach of men from
the outside.
The maddened miners are believed
to be John Duff and John Smith. News
of their plight is being kept from their
families, who have given them up for
dead.
Additional signs of life have been
discovered in the mine. On the walls I
of the mam shaft were
scribed these words:
"We have gone to 23,"
Hope to Find Missing Men.
Immediately the rescue squads re
doubled their efforts to reach cross
section No. 23 ot the mine. Ft is be
lieved several of the blast victims will
be found there.
At first the inscription was believed
to be the grim humor of one of the
trapped miners, but a crudely drawn
'index hand" alined at entry No.
pointed out the way.
Spurred on by the discovery of sur
vivors of Saturday's dust blast, fresh
rescue squads went Into the entries,
hacking and digging with redoubled
energy. Their only reward, however,
was the discovery of a corpse strewn
chamber far back In the mine Six
more bodies were recovered
The rescue party penetrated into
cross entry No. 23. No miners were
air conditions. The rescue squad
pressed on in the direction indicated
by the chalk marks.
A total of thirty bodies have been
recovered.

AMID SCENES OF

King George enf Queen Mary
Become Iters of India.
CROWDS AT CEREMONY
Event Far Outshone Durbar of 1903,
When King Edward Was Proclaimed
Emperor—Crowning Followed by An­
nouncement of Large Donations to
Promote Popular Education.
Delhi, India, Dec. 13.—King George
V. and his consort, Queen Mary, have
been proclaimed emperor and em
press of India. The culminating act
of the English monarch's accession to
the throne of his vast Indian domin
ions took place amid a scene which
for richness of color and magnificence
of decorations probably has never
been surpassed in modern times.
The crowning was followed by an
act of generosity on the king-emper
or's part, of which a slight hint had
already been given. The viceroy pro
claimed that the king-emperor was to
donate a large sum of money to pro
mote popular education and that fur
ther handsome gifts would be made.
The huge amphitheater which had
been erected in the durbar camp was
thronged from an early hour. The
bright tissues and sparkling of gems
of the many Indian princes and the
smart uniforms of the soldiery con
trasted strongly with the white dresses
of the European ladies and the sober
garb of civilian officials.
The event far outshone the durbar
of 1903. when King Edward wa3 pro
claimed emperor.
The great feudatory princes and
rulers of India, with the leading Brit
ish officials occupied seats of honor
near the pavilion located in the center.
Screened from the gaze of tiie curious
by a lattice framework, a number of
Maharanis and other Indian ladies of
high rank occupied two sections of the
front gallery. The interval of waiting
was beguiled by the playing of mili
tary music. The soldiers played a
large part in the durbar and a guard
of honor composed of one hundred
men was drawn up before the central
pavilion. Troops of every arm sur
rounded the arena in a compact mass
and Hues of soldiers extended along
the route of the royal approach.
