We have evtry confidence that the Union
party, so generously endorsed by the people,
•nd having unlimited capabilities for good,
will be found equal to the expectations of
the oottnfry $nd world, and that it will go
forward boldly in the accomplishment of its
high and holy mission.
But while the Union party have the res
ponsibility of the conduct of public affair.
for the next four years, and while they havi
no rieht and no disposition to shirk that res
ponsibility, they have a right to expect all
factious opposition on the part of the oppo
sition, heretofore justified by the exigences
and demands of politics, to cease. There
would, indeed, seem to be no justifiable mo
tive on the part of the opposition, to do
otherwise. The politics of the country are
settled for fom years. After a canvass the
most thorough in our history, the people by
an-overwhelming majority, have decided in
favor qf the Union Patty upon the issues
presented, and the will of that immense ma
jority should be respected by members of
all parties as the law of the land. All oppo

A Traireda-Depiiiy Sheriff Nor
ton and Albert Wilter Shot!
HEBALD Orrici, OSKALOOAA, TOWA,
Dec. 3d,« p.
Tlie following are tha particulars of the
tragedy which occurred an hour or two ago.
A man calling himself George Jackson, from
Springfield, Ills, knocked down Francis
Hodge, and rob»ed him of his pocket-book.
Some accounts say they had been drinking
together previously—both were apparently
very mueh under the influence of liquor.—
Deputy Sheriff G. W. Norton was notified
of the robbery and attempted to arrest Jack
son, who drew a revolver and shot Mr. Nor
ton in the right jaw. This occurred near
the jail. Jackson ran and a number of men
after him. He ran up near the Christian
church—on the way shooting at Mr. Sweeny
who was driving along the streot.
Albert Witter, a young man 18 years o^
age, son of widow Witter who recently set
tled here, was chopoing wood in an alley,
and the men in pursuit cried out to him to
stop Jackson who was then near him. Be
fore Witter had time to comprehend what
was wanted of him, Jackson shot him, the
ball entering the right temple and going in
to the brain. Jackson was soon surrounded,
arrested, and lodged in jail. Before he gave
up he was wounded pretty severely in the
head. M.. Norton's wound though painful,
is not thought to be dangerous. Witter,
though insensible for a time, was when we
saw him, abfe to talk. His wound had not
been thoroughly ?rammed, but the bad «p
peared to have lodged in tha front part of
the brain. His physician is of the opinion
the wrund wi'l proye fatal.
Jackson's pistol was a small revolver. He
had also on his peraan a rmalt dirk knife.

The Late Battle ut PrtnktlM.
^AdmniLK, Dec. 2.—I have received full
accounts of the late battle at Franklin. It
is one which must be chronicled as one of
the most brilliant of the war. For three

afternoon of the 80th the rebel annv esvers

Dick Taylor's coraraau 1, numbering in all
extending from one end to the other of the

infantry command took position.
