PROJECT EXPLAINED
G.E. Minor, of Washington,
Tells of Plans for National
Route,
G. E. Minor of Washington. D. C,
talked for a short time on the propo
sition of running a national highway
from Washington. IX C, to San Fran
cisco, Cal.. at the Court House last
uiglit. The crowd was not thought
sufficiently large for the hearing the
matter deserved, and it was decided by
J. P. Hetzler and other members of
the Commercial Club to have him
speak again at the regular Thursday
dinner of the Commercial Club today.
Mr. Minor said the road planned
would be I'd feet wide, made of con-
Sirete. and would follow the Old Trails
would bring the route through Colum
bia. The com. of the road is estimated at
$500,non,iioi-50.000 miles at ?10,000 a
mile. As there are about thirty miles
of the road crossing Boone county,
$300,000 would be spent in this county
alone. The highway association, after
investigation, figures that 90 per cent
of the machinery now being used on
the Panama Canal could be used in
building this road.
Mr. Minor stated that forty-one gov
ernors and fifty-four engineers have
indorsed the plan, many of whom are
in the slates through which the road
will not pass. These men realize, Mr.
Minor said, that the national highway
is the only feasible way in which a
start may be made toward permanent
national roads.
The road will be in the hands of the
government, which means that it will
kept In first-class condition for all
tnre. After tins road is built, other
roads will be built to it, and the sys
tem extended much more efficiently,
the speaker said, than if the money
were to be apportioned to the differ
ent states, and by them in turn to
the various counties.
Mr. Minor" is speaking in the vari
ous towns through which the pro
posed road will pass. When the prop
osition is understood, he feels there
will be little trouble in bringing the
proper influence to bear on congress
men to get them to act favorably on
the road bill when it is brought up
before Congress next March.
TVX ON TOK.UTO FOR ROADS!
Minor Would I laic National Ilitrliiiuy
Witliotit Direct Federal Aid.
G. E. Minor, the representative of
.the National Highways Association,
.'-R'niilrt nc. n cvtnm nf u'nr tnY nn to
bacco and would not agree to Federal
aid to obtain funds for building a
national highway. This was what he
said at the Commercial Club luncheon
today when he addressed the business
men.
In discussing the methods of pro
curing funds for the giant proposition
he said: "The money will be raised
in a way that the people will never
notice. Our plan is to get the tobacco
tax raised the same as it was during
the Spanish-American War. During
that time the price of tobacco was ap
parently no higher than it is now or
as before. The manufacturers sim
ply took out one-thirty-fifth of the to
bacco they put in a cigar or package
and no one knew the difference. This
tax will raise about $90,000,000 a year.

INJUNCTION SUIT
READYJOMORROW
Formal Notice Served on
City by J. W. Schwabe
. Today.
GIVES HIS REASONS
Shoe Company Not Only
Concern Not Re-Imbursed
by Columbia.
J. W. Schwabe served formal notice
this morning on the members of the
city council and Mayor W. P. Moore
that he would make application in the
Probate Court for a temporary in
junction tomorrow to prevent any pay
ment to the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co.
The council voted Tuesday night to
pay $278.25 of $3278.25, that, it is as
serted, is owed to the company for a
sewer built in 190". The temporary
injunction will be effective until the
January term of the Circuit Court
when the case will be tried before
Judge David H. Harris.
"The city of Columbia is not bound
either legally or morally to pay one
cent to the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co.,
said Mr. Schwabe tills morning. "The
people of this city have already done
enough for the company and there is
no reason why we should give them a
sewer gratis. A. D. Brown deeded the
sewer to the city and never made
any attempt to collect this money.
"There never has been any prese
dent in the history of the city that
would warrant the payment of this
money. Other private persons have
built as much and have never been
reimbursed one cent. Judge J. A.
Stewart built Stewart bridge at a cost
of $0500 and deeded it to the city.
He has built sewers in Westwood and
Westmount and has never been paid
for either the bridge or the sewers
The Hamilton-Brown Company should
receive no more consideration than
any other individual.
"If the city must pay this money
let the council first examine the vouch
ers, checks and receipts that the com
pany should hold to show that they
really did pay $3278.25 for this sewer.
This contract was not put up for the
highest bidder but was let privately.
The city council at that time should
have either issued bonds or establish
ed a sewer district so that they could
have collected a sewer district tax
from the company.
The Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company
was given a bonus of almost $100,000
to place their factory in Columbia.
There was no reason for this gift nor
is there any reason now why the city
should further give them this $327S.25.
S. H. Levy who was the chairman
of the water and light committee of
the city council at the time the sewer
was built, says that the city is mor
ally but not legally bound to pay this
money. At the time the city council,
not being able to pay for the building
of the sewer, passed an ordinance to
the effect that if Mr. Brown would
build the sewer, the city would at
some later date pay for it.
CLAY TIGER CAPTAIN
M Men Select Right Guard
for Their 1914
Leader.
James A. Clay was elected captain
this afternoon of the 1914 football
team.
Clay plays right guard and has been
one of Missouri's most consistent play
ers. In the two years he has been
playing he has missed two games, the
Nebraska and Drake games of last
year. Clay was sick at the time with
tonsilitis. "Liz" that'? how the root
ers know him has a record of only
being removed once from a game dur
ing his Varsity career. That only
time was in the game with Rolla this
year .when he was injured.
Clay played on the Plattsburg High
School team one year before coming to
the University. He made the freshman
team and has been an M man the last
two years.
Telephone Inquiry Fnt Oft".
The State Board of Public Utilities
was to have met in Columbia this af
ternoon to investigate a complaint
of excessive rates entered against the
Columbia Telephone Company. The
hearing was postponed until January
S, at which time a second continuance
probably will be asked for, because of
the fact that Circuit Court will be in
session and the lawyers will be busy.

count of the expenses of the city for
each month from the beginning of the
fiscal year, published in the University

ARE -CAPTAINS ELIGIBLE?
Kaiisus and Nebraska Authorities
Doubt if Stiiene and Towle Can Play.
The three-year rule for athletics is
bothering the eligibility authorities
of Kansas and Nebraska universities.
Because there is a doubt as to
whether Edward W. Stuewe. star
player on the Kansas team, has an
other year in football, the members
of the squad did not follow the usual
custom by electing a captain at the
annual banquet given for the team
Tuesday night.
Stuewe played in two non-conference
games in 1911. but was com
pelled to drop out on account of sick
ness. His case will be considered at
the meeting of the Missouri Valley
conference this week. After the con
ference has decided on the question
of his eligibility, the election will be
held.
At Nebraska .Max Towle is the captain-elect,
but R. G. Clapp. physical
director, says that he is ineligible.
According to Doctor Clapp, Towle
played baseball in the university in
1911 and 1912. This would make him
a three-year participant in athletics,
although he has been on the football
team but two years. It is generally
believed that he has played his last
game with the Cornhuskers.

STUDENT RELIGIOUS
LIFE IS HIS WORK
Rev. A. C. Zumbrunnen in
Charge of New Department
of Methodist Church.
MOVEMENT GROWING
Increased Attendance at Ser
vices Makes it Necessary
to Rent Rooms.
A new religious movement was
started in Columbia last September,
and during these three months it has
developed to large proportions. It is
the organization and direction of the
religious life of the Methodist students
in the University and colleges under
the supervision of a man especially
appointed for that work, the Rev. A.
C. Zumbrunnen, student pastor of the
Methodist Episcopal Church.
This department of church work was
designed to fill a need not met by the
University, which as a state institu
tion is not allowed to give any definite
leligious training. The work is new
to Columbia and comparatively new in
itself. It has been carried on for a
short time in a few other state univer
sities and is strongest at Michigan and
Illinois. Its purpose is to guide the
religious life of the student, who". jiT5t
freed from home surroundings and
placed on his own responsibility, is in
danger from the new things he meets
and from the change in ideals and
standards that come to him.
The Missourian a short time ago
published an account of tho work
which the Rev. Mr. Zumbrunnen
bad accomplished in organizing new
classes for special study for the stu
dents of his personal work among
them. The enrollment of the Sunday
school has passed the 300 mark and
is increasing. With the church al
ready so crowded that rooms in one
of the business buildings had to be
rented for class purposes, Mr. Zum
brunnen is confronted with the prob
lem of room, for there are still some
three hundred Methodist students in
town who are not regularly attending
the classes.
In his report for the first quarter,
which Mr. Zumbrunne has just sent
to. the church boards, he outlines his
plans for the rest of the year. In
order to perfect the work here as
much as possible, he is going to visit
some of the other schools where this
work is being done and get ideas from
them. He also intends to organize
new classes under the leadership of
prepared teachers, and next year hopes
to start a four years' course in Bible
study. An appropriation has been ask
ed for to carry on the work, and he
is making an effort to get more room.
