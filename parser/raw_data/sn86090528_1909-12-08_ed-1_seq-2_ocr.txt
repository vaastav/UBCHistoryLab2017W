Yi)u to Know tliat a t liiroi'nuior in
in town, and that I am lion? la stay;
so if your health is not Rood, r do not
caro what the doctors of the various
tlieiupiilic schools have called your di
ease, 1 know it romes from abnormal
pressure on nerves, and by a Kciontifie
skeletal adjustment and securing iiri
cr articulation of the vertebrae, re
moving this pressure from the nerves,
allowing a normal flow and distribu
tion of nervous impulses, or nerve
energy to the various tissues of the
body, health is the inevitable result;
for nature's laws are inimitable; there
fore, it the channels through which
nerve energy or In other words, trans
formed life-iuimiiml, or vitality, are
obstructed, the tissues dependent up
on them for their supply of vital it y
are left weakened and ns a result we
have abnormal functions, or disease
named; and varying 1 name accord
ing to the degree and by grouping
numerous symptoms, i. e. Nervousuess,
Insanity, Insomnia, Indigestion, Fevers
of various kinds, all kinds of disease
relative to sex, low vitality, Appendi
citis, Constipation and others too num
erous to mention.
I especially invite those who suffer
with constipation, and ladies
wbo Buffer with disease Ja'cu
lLar to them to come and
let me make them well; for Chiro
practic will do it where all else falls.
You need not submit to local examina
tion, cie., for my work Is principally
on the spine. 1 locate and remove the
CAUSE of your trouble. Come today;
do not witlt. The various symptoms
or outward expressions of disease, are
nature's warnings and must not be ignored.
No douldil you have heard of
Chiropractic, and perhaps, have heard
sorao one "knocking" the profession;
but, we find "knockers" who knock at
everything and everybody, so do not
listen, but come and see for yourself.
H will only take a few minutes' ex
planation to convince you that I know
what I am talking about. If you are
in doubt, come and be examined. Ke
member, it costs you nothing to inves
tigate. .
I understand that there has been
one or two "pseudo" Chiropractors
here, but an individual who is a
"pseudo" in any profession is unprinci
pled and no surprise can be manifested
at their conduct, but I request the
people of Chlekasha and vicinity as
broa vmlnded people not tii associate
them, or connect them in anyway to
the profession of Chiropractic, there
by becoming prejudiced and depriving
yourself and frier of something as
indispensable to every community as
is the science of Chiropractic.

Europe.
The American rights In the fisheries
! on the north Atlantic coast uuder the
fisheries article of the treaty of 1818
have ;een a cause of difference be
tween the United States and Great
Britain for nearly seventy 5vrs. The
Interests Involved are of great impor
tance to the American fishing industry,
aud the final settlement of the contro
versy by the permanent court of ar
bitration at The Hague will remove
a source ot constant Irritation and com
plaint This is the first case Involving
such great international questions
which has been submitted to the per
manent court ot arbitration at The
Hague. .
Negotiations Jor an International
conference to cousider and reach an
arrangement providing for the preser
vation and protection of the fur seals
in the north Pacific are in progress
with the governments of Great Britain,
Japan and Russia. Tho attitude of
the governments Interested leads me
to hope for a satisfactory settlement of
this question as ths ultimate outcome
of the negotiations.
The Near East.
The quick transition of the govern
ment of the Ottoman empire from one
of retrograde tendencies to a consti
tutional government with a parlia
ment and with progressive modern
policies of reform and public improve
ment is one of the important phenome
na of our times. Constitutional gov
ernment seems also to have made
further advance in Persia. These
events have turned the eyes of the
world upon the near east. In that
quarter th? prestige of the United
states has spread widely through the
peaceful influence of American schools,
universities and missionaries. There
is every reason why we shonld obtain
a greater share of the commerce of the
near east since the conditions are
more favorable now than ever before.
Latin America.
One of the happiest events in recent
pan-American diplomacy was the pa
cific, independent settlement by tbe
governments of Bolivia and Peru of a
boundary difference between them,
which for some weeks threatened to
cause war and even to entrain im
Mtterments affecting other republics
less directly concerned.
Our Citizens Abroad.
This administration, through the de
partment of state and the foreign serv
ice, is lending all proper support to
legitimate and beneficial American en
terprises in foreign countries, the de
gree of such support being measured
by ths national advantages to be ex
pected. A citizen himself cannot by
contract or otherwise divest himself
of tho right, nor can this government
escape the obligation, of his protec
tion in his personal and property
rights when these are unjustly In
fringed in a foreign country. To avoid
ceaseless vexatious it Is proper that In
considering whether American enter
prlso should be encouraged or support
ed In a particular couutry the govern
ment should give full weight not only
to the national a opposed to the indi
vidual benefits to accrue, but also to
the fact whether or not the govern
ment of the country in question is in
1t administration and In Its diplomacy
faithful to the principles of modera
tion, equity and justice upon which
alone depends international credit in
iiplotnucy as well as in nuance.
The Monroe Doctrine.
The pan-Ameri.-an policy of tl-'i
government has long been fixed in Its
prin iples and remains unchanged.
Willi the changed circumstances of the j
United States and of the republics to
the south of m. most of which have ;
irreat natural resources, stable govern- j
ment and jnot'ivninj Ideal., the ap- !
I'rel-iiislou which ave tiso to the
i.TT Monroe doctrine may bo said to have
" nearly disappeared, and neither the
doctrine as It exists nor any other doc
trine of American policy should be
j permitted to oicrtite for the peipetua
1 tlon of irresponsible government, the
escape of Just obligations or the Insidi
ous allegation of dominating ambitions
on the part of the United States.
My meeting vvllh Presidutit Diaz and
the greeting exchanged on both Amer
ican and Mexican soli served. I hope,
to signalise the close and cordial rela
tions which so welltblud together this
republic and the great republic imme
diately to the south, betweeu which
thpro is so vast a network of material
Interests.
I am happy to soy that all but one
of tho cases which for so long vexed
our relations with Venezuela have
been settled within the past few
months and that, under the enlight
ened regime now directing the govern
ment of Venezuela, provision has been
made for arbitration of the remaining
case before The Hague tribunal.
On July 30, 1000, the government of
Tanama agreed, after considerable ne
gotiation, to Indemnify the relatives of
the American officers and sailors who
were brutally treated, one of them
having, Indeed, been killed by the
ranaman police this year.
This government was obliged to In
tervene diplomatically to brlug about
arbitration or settlement of the claim
of the Emery company against Nica
ragua, which It bad long before been
agreed should be arbitrated. A settle
ment of this troublesome case was
reached by the signature of a protocol
on Sept. 18, 1909.
Many years ago diplomatic Interven
tion became necessary to the protec
tion of the interests in the American
claim of Aisop & Co. against the
government of Chile. The govern
ment of Chile had frequently admitted
obligation In tbe case and had prom
ised this government to settle it. There
had been two abortive attempts to do
so through arbitral commissions, which
failed through lack of jurisdiction.
Now, happily, as the result of the re
cent diplomatic negotiations, the gov
ernments of the United States and of
Chile, actuated by the sincere desire
to free from any strain those cordial
aud frieudly relations upon which both
set such store, have agreed by a proto
col to submit the controversy to defin
itive settlement by his Britannic majes
ty Edward VII.
The Nicaraguan Trouble.
Since tbe Washington conventions of
1907 were communicated to the gov
ernment of the United States as a con
sulting and advising party this gov
ernment has been almost continuously
called upon by one or another and in
turn by all of the five Central Amer
ican republics to exert itself for the
maintenance of the conventions. Near
ly every complaint has been against
the Zelaya government of Nicaragua,
which has kept Central America iu j
constant tension or turmoil. The re- i
sponses made to the representations of
Central American republics as due j
from the United States on account of ,
Its relation to the Washington couven- j
tlous have been at all times conserva-
tlve and have avoided, so far as possi
ble, any semblance of Interference, al
though it is very apparent that the
considerations of geographic proximity
to tbe canal zone ami of tbe very sub
stantial American Interests in Central
America give to the United States a
special position in tbe zone of these
republics and the Caribbean sea.
I need not rehearse here the patient
efforts of this government to promote
peace and welfare among these re
publics, efforts which are fully appre
ciated by the majority of them who
are loyal to their true interests. It
would be no less unnecessary to re
hearse here the sad tale of unspeak
able barbarities aud oppression alleged
to have been committed by the Zelayu
government. Recently two Americans
were put to death by order of Presi
dent Zelaya himself. They were offl
cers In the organized forces of a rev
olution which had continued many
weeks and was lu control of about
kalf of the republic, and as such, ac
cording to tne modern enlightened
practice of civilized nations, they were
entitled to be dealt with as prisoners
of war.
At the date when this message is
printed this government has termi
nated diplomatic relations with the
Zelaya government for reasons made
public in a communication to the for
mer Nicaraguan charge d'affaires and
is Intending to take such future steps
as may be found most consistent with
its dignity. Its duty to American In
terests aud its moral obligation to
Central America and to civilization. It
may later be necessary for me to bring
Ibis subject to the attention of the
congress in a special message.
In the Far East.
In the far east this government pre
serves unchanged its policy of support
ing the principle of equality of oppor
tunity aud scrupulous respect for the
Integrity of the Chinese empire, to
which policy are pledged tbe Interest
ed powers of both east and west.
By the treaty of 100.1 China has un
dertaken the abolition of likin with a
moderate and proportionate raising of
the custom' tariff along with currency
reform. These reforms being a mani
fest advantage to foreign commerce as
well as to the Interests of China, thit
povernmeut l endeavoring to facili
tate these measures and tbe needful
acquiescence of the treaty powers.
When It appeared that Chinese likin
revenues were to be hypothecated to
foreign bankers Iu connection with a
(treat railway project It was obvious
that the governments whose nationals
hehl ihlt I' .! would have a certain ,
direct Interest in tbe question of the j
carrying out by China of the reform
in question. The administration deem- j
ed American participation to be of j
ervnt uatinual Itit.ne-st. Happily, when j
