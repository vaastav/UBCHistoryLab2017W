The President of the Senate is now
receiving the electoral votes cast by
the several States the 3d Inst.
General Swann, in resorting to
every little technicality to turn aside
the force of the evidence against him,
is not disposing the public in his
favot. _________
Vice-President-elect Hendricks is
still the recipient of congratulations
from his Indiana admirers. The
noble veteran Democrat deserves
them all. '
Polygamists are having a bard
time of it in Arizona. Judge How
ard's sentences will cause many of
them to lose their appitite for more
than one wife.
Texas gave 128,000 majority for
Cleveland and Hendricks. Accord
ing to Montana Republican theory
the evidence is overwhelming that
Texas is Republican.
A new candidate for the New York
Senatorship appears in the person of
Chafrman Warren of the Republican
State Committee. Mr. Warren will
not occupy Senator Lapham's seat
unless the Stalwarts so will it.
For the first time since 1879, the
public debt statement shows an in
crease instead of a diminution. The
truth is that the revenues have fallen
off, although some of the Republican
organs will probably attribute it to
the election of Grover Cleveland.
The Irish temperance societies in
New York City have reeolved to
erect a monument to Father Mat
thew, the great apoetle of temper
ance. It is to be hoped they will not
take as much time over it as the Bar
tholdi statue people have taken with
the Fre nch gift _
The attempt of certain nawepapers
to marry off Governor Cleveland in
spite of himself is looked upon in
some quarters as an underhanded
way of killing him. The Governor,
probably, would like to be killed, if
be is to be put out of the way
after the manner proposed.
It is given out at Washington that
Mr. Hurd will not contest the seat of
his Republican opponent in the To
ledo district. Everybody may be
quite sure that the distinguished.
Toledo Democrat will not contest a
seat which he does not know in ad
vance to be his on unquestionable
proof,
It is no longer denied that Gover
nor Cleveland was sold out in New
York at the November election on
account of the local offices, to the
tune of not less than 15,000 to 20,000
votes. The fact is causing a strong
movement to have city and county
elections take place in the spring in
Presidential years.
The annual report of Brigadier
General George Crook, on matters in
«he department of Arizona, shows an
agreeable condition of affairs among
the Indians in the Southwest. The
great peacemaker has fulfilled his
mission, and people of that section,
savage and civilized alike, are reap
ing tbe benefit of it.
The "divine right to bolt" received
Its latest and best vindication in the
late election, which seems to have
bolted fifty thousand Irishmen into
the Blaine party, and sixty thousand
Republicans into the new Demo
ortic party. The former went to
Blaine to stay over night, and the
latter came over to the Democratic
party to stay because "the regulars"
will not allow any mugwumps to
vote their ticket hereafter.
Opinions of leading men in Con
gress concur that there will be no
tariff legislation this winter, but
pending trade treaties and interests
with Mexico and the Spanish Amer
ican islands, which are brought for
ward in the President's message,
will lead to high debate and the fore
shadowing of the lines upon which
tariff reform will be undertaken In
earnest by the new adminstation
and tbe Forty-ninth Congress.
The Enquirer opposes making
Ohio a November State, because this
would cause it to lose its prominence
as a political force in tbe Union.
This view is narrow and selfish. It
invites Federal corruption and frauds
in every presidential year, and
makes tbe election of President in
many other States largely depend
upon the result in a single State.
Ohio has loet two Presidential nom
inations because it is an "October"
State. __________ *
President Arthur asks for a pen
sion of the first magnitude for Gen
eral Giant. A good idea, but would
it not be well to place the stipend in
the bands of trustees, with a perpet
ual succession clause in the condi
tion? General Grant's inordinate
greed for money has lost him much
of the respect of the country, but we
hope a Democratic administration,
which he^o largely assisted to pre
vent eight years ago will treat his
oase with favorable consideration.
Mr. Lowell states be will "stick"
in London until his successor is ap
pointed and presents his credentials.
Then he will oome back. Our Brit
ish-American Minister at the Court
of St. James is learning wisdom in
his old age. It was to be feared that,
Mr. Blaine having been beaten, Mr.
Lowell would hold out and refuse to
he removed by President Cleveland.
What a calamity it would have been
if Mr. Lowell and tbe British lion
kid deolared war upon us.
WAR AGAINST SHYER.
The fact that President Arthur in
bis message and Secretary McCul
lough in his report recommended the
suspension of silver coinage has open
ed up a fresh discussion of tbe whole
subject matter. In response to tbe
recommendations, Senator McPher
son has given notice that be would
introduce a bill to suspjend tbe coin
age of silver dollars and to provide
for the issuance of silver certificates
upon the deposit in tbe United States
treasury of silver bullion stamped
with tbe market value of that metal
Other bills of a similar character will
probably be introduced in the House
Tbe war against the metal is fairly
opened. That it will be a bitter and
obstinate one no one wbo knows tbe
strength of the forces arrayed upon
either side will deny.
Those who are informed upon the
subject know tbe cause of this crusade
against the metal. They have no
need to look beyond or outside of
National banks, National bond
holders and their strikers to find
tbe instigators of it. Their prime
object is to make money dearer and
interest higher. By suspending tbe
coinage of silver they hope to degrade
the metal, force it out of. Circulation
and make gold tbe only measure oi
values. The arguments used to effect
this end are patent to leveryone. We
are told that tbe people will not use
our standard silver dollars, that for
eign nations will not take them,
that they are accumulating in large
quantities in the treasury vaults and
that they are driving gold out of the
country.
In answer to these propositions, we
hold that facts disprove them. The
people do accept the standard dollars
and accept them without complaint
That if the coin was objectionable
to them petitions would come up from
every quarter protesting against their
further coinage ; that a silver dollar
will buy as much, pay as much and
cost as much to get as a gold dollar ;
that the certificates issued upon them
circulate side by side with gold.
Government legal tenders, and
national bank notes are as readily
accepted by the people ; that gold has
not been driven out of tbe couutry
since the remonitization of silver;
that on tbe contrary our annual
gold imports are in excess of our gold
exports; that it makes no difference
so far as our prosperity as a nation is
concerned whether any foreign power
takes onr standard dollar or not ; that
there United States are too great, too
populous and too wealthy to be forced
to regulate its currency by that of any
foreign nation ; that tbe coinage of
tbe standard silver dollar is in the
direct line of the interests of the
people in that it furnishes an abun
dance of money and this keeps down
the rate of interest and that the enact
ment of the Bland bill marked tbe
beginning of tbe most prosperous era
on
the
in
in
an
to
to
beginning of tbe most prosperous era
the country baa ever enjoyed.
We have but little fear that Con
gress will be led into any legislation
radically affecting silver coinage by
tbe rabid utterances of monometal
lists. The Republican Senate might
feel disposed to suspend tbe coinage of
the standard silver dollar, but we do
not believe the Democratic House
will seriously entertain tbe proposi
tion. President Cleveland's ad
ministration is pledged by the Demo
cratic platform to maintain tbe
money of tbe constitution "gold
and silver,'' and for the next
four years silver will be
safe, provided the silver producing
states and territories of tbe country
stand firmly by tbe metal and enter
into no compromise with its enemies.
There are two cr three newspapers
in the west, which embrace every op
portunity to give the metal a deadly
stab. They should! be seen to. Net
that their ill-digested arguments have
weight with the communities in
which tbe papers are published, but
should a copy of them find its way to
Washington it might be used with
some effect against tbe metal. It is
generally suppose^ that a newspaper
published in a silver producing sec
tion, reflects, in part, at least, the sen
timent of its readers upon so grave a
matter as the suspension of silver
coinage, and when one is found op
posing the interests of the people
upon whose patronage it exists, it
should be made to feel their displeas
ure at its course. Tbe enemies of
silver will take every advantage of
its friends, and will not hesitate to
quote tbe drivel of every crank in a
silver mining section, wbo is permit
ted to air bis opposition to the metal
through the local press. Our evening
contemporary should heed this fact
and hereafter truly represent tbe
views of our people upon a question
which so intimately affects their pros
perity.
MORE RAILROADS WANTED.
Men wbo decry railroads as con
sumers of tbe public vitals, instead
ot being the most potent wealth mak
ers in the world, forget facts that are
as indisputable and familiar as night
and day. Secretary McCullough
states one ot them in a single sen
tance when he says in his recent re
port : "The cost ot transportation has
been so cheapened (by railroads in
the west) that farming lands far «vest
of tbe Mississsippi have become near
ly as valuable as lands in the sea
board states. To the rise in the vaine
of lands resulting from tbe construc
tion of railroads tbe wonderful in
crease of the national wealth is
attributable."
The Miner still continues to want
more of these " consumers of tbe
public vitals''for Montana. It would
like to see one built from Anaconda
to the great Bitter Root valley. It
would favor one from Butte direct to
the great grain and coal fleldsjof Gal
latin County. It would like to see
the Territory grid-ironed with rail
ways. It needs several more for its
easy settlement and development
It
THE FRANCO-CHINESEWAR.
During the past few weeks there
appeared a lair prospect that the war
between France and China would be
brought to a close by peaoeful nego
tiations. But events are now shaping
themselves in ju»t tbe opposite direc
tion. According to the tenor of re
cent advices there now arenas to be
little prospect oi a peaceful solution.
Tbe French have demanded more
than tbe Chinese Government will
concede, the latter looking upon
tbeae demands as exhorbitant beyond
precedent.
It is evident that the Chinese are
well informed on tbe political condi
tion of France. The French people
are grumbling at tbe prolongation of
tbe war and at last accounts a Min
isterial crisis had ceme. A number
of Ministers were ready to resign
t eir positions, but retained them for
a time at tbe earnest request of the
Prime Minister.
Recent estimates put tbe costof tbe
war thus far at about $100,000 000 That
is only the beginning of tbe trouble.
The Chinese evidently understand
that It tbe contest be prolonged, a
criais will be brought about in France
and that ultimately better terms will
be conceded. Tnc French, besides
holding the territory, already seized
in Tonquin, propose to hold the Is
land of Formosa as a lien until the
controversy is settled. The new
Chinese tactics will enlist fresh in
terest. The plan evidently is to
worry the French by prolonging the
war indefinitely. Admiral Courbet
recently demanded twenty thousand
more troops, and threatened to resign
if they were not promptly forwarded.
Tbe cartridge manufacturers of this
country have recently filled large
orders for account of the Chinese,
and there have been conaiderable
shipments of small arms for the same
account. It is certain that the
French at home are reluctantly back
ing ud tbe present Administration,
and would be glad to see a wsy out of
the present difficulty without a long
and exhausting war.
SECRETARY CHANDLER'S REPORT.
In his report Secretary Chandler
admits wbat has been charged, for
years, by Democrats against the
management of tbe navy department.
And tbe most singular part of tbe
document is that portion of it in
which it appears tbe Secretary has
just discovered what has been known
by everyone else in tbe country,
which is—using his own language—
that "instead of making our navy
yards for the advantage and benefit
of our ships, tbe ships have dragged
out a protracted existence for the
benefit of the yards."
In explaining tbe disproportion
between expenditures in tbe navy
yards snd tbe results accomplished
tbe Secretary says: "It is to be found
iu tbe policy ot attempting, at a
great cost, to rejuvenate worn out
s'iuotures under the name of re
pairs." This fact has also been
known to every one wbo has taken
tbe troui le to inform himself upon
tbe subject and Democratic members
of Congress have repeatedly opposed
making appropriations for these ob
jects and as often been held up to tbe
world by the Republican press
of
world by the Republican press
enemies of our navy.
It is quite likely, however, that if
Mr. Blaine bad been elected these
discoveries would not have been
made,- at this time, by toe Secretary
of tbe Navy. Millions upon mil
lions of tbe people's money have
been thrown away upon worthless
old bulks for tbe benefit of contrac
tors, an 11 yet, according to Mr. Chan
dler's own statement, our navy em
braces only three iron-dads which
will be fit for cruising sei vice fifteen
years hence. These frank admis
sions are due to tbe election of Cleve
land and the certainty that under
bis administration a radical change
will be made in tbe administration
of toe nuvy department. The people,
however, are thankful for the hints
thiuPthrown out by tbe Secretary.
Tbe next Secretary of tbe Navy will
doubtless profit by them. That they
were not thrown out long ago is due
to that system of addition, division
and silence which has prevailed in
tbe management of the navy depart
ment for years. But thank God, tbe
country will soon be relieved of tbe
services of tbe Robesons, Chandlers
and Roaches of the Navy. Turn the
rascals out.
In regard to tariff legislation at
this session of Congress, Speaker Car
lisle recently said to a correspondent
of one ot-tbe leading New York dai
lies, " The fact that a new adminis
tration* is about to come in makes
Democrats and Republicans alike dis
inclinéd to attempt anything like a
general revision of the tariff now.
There will be some tariff legislation
this session, because tbe question of
enacting tbe necessary legislation to
carry the Mexican treaty into effect
will come before the House, and
should the Senate ratify the treaty
with Spain, the House will be called
upon to enact the legislation neces
sary to carry that treaty into effect."
Among those mentioned as the
probable successor of Mr. Lowell as
Minister to England, is Mr. Abram
S. Hewitt Mr. Hewitt would do
nonor to the position if be were called
to it, and if tbe opportunity were
offered, no man mentioned for tbe
place would be more likely to uphold
tbe dignity of the country and the
rights of its citizens than he. Mr.
Hewitt is one of the best equipped of
our public men for any public service
and all, wjthout regard to party, re
spect him for his honorable character
and abilities.
New York Truth: Behind Mr.
Stanley in bis Congo business and
development of tbe African Conti
nent, there is, it seems, a pretty tall
American. Certain American capi
talists, for whom one of our minis
ters—Mr. Sanford—spoke, want to
run a railroad through that inter
esting country. Wonder if Jay
Gould is at the bottom of the scheme?
What a magnificent field Africa pre

A CHANGE OF HEART.
The eagerness of the Republican
Senators to oome to the support of
Mr. Vest in his resolution calling for
an investigation in the recent leases
of land by the Indian Territory
shows that they have experienced
a radical change of heart since the
election. It is one of tbe open secrets
in Wa-bington that Senator i'lun
and at least one other Republican
Senator are stockholders in pros
perous cattle companies whose aui
ma's fiad very cheap grazing land
in the Indian Territory. Tbe leases
were made in open violation of law
The Secretary of tbe Interior could
have put an end to them In a day if
be had felt so inclined, but tbe West
era Senators have been influential
enough to make him at least wink at
t e process which wtuld in a few
years have captured all of tLe best
lauds in the Indian Territory for
mere song.
At various times there has been an
endeavor made to investigate these
leases in tbe Senate, but the Repub
lican Senators fiaVe always thrown
water upon the scheme or discour
aged it. Now that a Democratic Sec
retary of tbe Interior is certain to
open up the matter after tbe 4th of
next Marcb, they are anxious to fore
stall bis action by putting themselves
on record m favor of tbe investiga
tion. A rigid investigation of tbe
cattle companies now illegally oc
cupying public lands would uuoover

LOGAN'S FIGHTING CHANCE.
A recent dispatch says the decision
in the Brand-Leman case has caused
great rejoicing among Geo. Logan's
friends, as they frei now that tbe
Senator has a good fighting chance.
It now appears that the opposition to
the Republicans is not wholly made
up of Democrats. Two are Inde
pendent Greenbackers. One of them
Haynes, was originally a Republican
and voted for Gen. Logan in his last
election. Tbe other a Greenbacker,
until bis last election, had always
been a Democrat. If Haynes, wbo
was an original supporter of Logan,
should merely stay away from tbe
Legislature, Logan can be elected, as
be bas already leceived assurance of
tbe caucus nomination. The Re
publicans of Illinois think Logan was
set up as an object of slaughter this
year, and as one of tbem put it
"Gen. Logan's course since the elec
tion has convinced us that he should
not be still further crucified."

Referring to the bill introduced by
Representative Taylor, of Ohio, pro
hibiting tbe dismissal from Federal
offioe of honorably discharged sol
diers, sailors and marines, except for
cause, a contemporary says : " Mr.
Taylor will doubtless agree with us
that the prospects indicate that it
will be a severe winter for legislation
of that character." We cannot see
why it is so. The rules of the civil
service should be properly enforced
But men in tbe emi-loy of the Gov
ernment, who have been contributing
money to tbe support of the Repub
lican party, should be treated as vio
lators of the Civil Service law and be
compelled to step down and out.
Preference should be shown to sol

thousands of good Democratic sol

made victims of prejudice. Give
them a cbauce.
THE ANNUAL STEAL.
Eight million, dollars, we are told
from Washington, is the sum asked
for rivers and harbors in this Con
gress. This bill is one of the most
notorious jobs and swindles which is
annually enacted into law, and
should be closely watched. No one
will of course object to tbe improve
ment ot real harbors and real rivers
where sueh improvements are needed
in the interest of navigation or in the
preservation cf life and property, but,
as a witty Congressman once re
marked, half tbe alleged rivers should
be improved into macadamized roads
As for some of the harbors, they ex
ist only in the imagination of the
Congressmen iu whose " deestricts "
they are supposed to be situated. The
bill should oe closely watched.
The New York senatorial fight bids
fair to be a protracted and bitter one
Several caudidates are in the field,
among them President Arthur. Tbe
latter, however, professes to take no
m erest in it, and disclaims a desire
to ran unless he can secure tha united
Republican vote. This, according to
the statements of his wat mest friends,
he cannot secure, as ail the acti-slal'
wart element in tbe legislature is op
posed to nim. It is thought the Pres
ident may obtain the prize by making
a severe fight, but bis friends think
such a fight would disrupt the Re
publican party in that state, and are
therefore uncertain how to act. There
is fun ahead among tbe New York
Republicans.
. Under an act of Congress the con
stitutional term of a large uumber of
administrative offices is limited to
four years. This law the civil ser
vice reformers want .repeal, so
that good men may be continued in
office Indefinitely. Every good Re
publican now in office, and who ever
heard of a bad one in office, will
heartily approve of this movement.
But what shall be done with the
thousands of good Democrats who
deserve their places ? 1 ntegrity and
capability are not confined to one
party. Give the Democrats a chance.
A New Haven lady advertises for

THE KENTUCKY PESTILENCE.
The news from the region on
the Kentueky-Virginf* border is
too conflicting to indicate tbe
source of the plague which has
resulted in so many violent deaths
and the distressful stoppage of all
business and work, the dead out
numbering the living. It has been
supposed that the frightful disease
could be traced to impurities in the
water drank, but whether this be
so or not seems doubtful. An ex
change says that evils resulting from
tbe use of contaminated water in the
ordinary sense are not as a rule de
veloped suddenly ; and though bad
water can do a great deal of barm,
vet it acte commonly by tbe produc
tion of low and fatal fevers and no«
by «he production of an acute and
rapid disease. There is some irritant
poison, perhaps, involved in this
rare, and as the region is one where
there are mineral springs, some sub
stances not commonly contained in
tbe water may have receutly found
their way Into ir.
DEPRESSION IN BUSINESS.
Our Eastern exchanges record con
tinual stagnation in business, but
especially so in regard h» the iron
and steel manufacturers in Ohio and
Pennsylvania. How much further
the trouble will extend before the
limit is reached, no one cau calculate
definitely. A week ago E «stern
financiers said the end had come.
Still the bottom appears out of sight
yet. Every day notes tbe closing
down of other manufactories aud the
cutting down of wages in those that
continue open. Yet all these indus
tries are sufficiently protected by the
tariffand are unhurt by foreign com
petition. Tbe question naturally
suggests itself, bave they not bred
tod much protected? Have they not
been fostered until their products
have glutted tbe market and brought
thousands of poor laborers, wbo have
been engaged in other work, to thé
verge of starvation? It looks as
though the present embarrassment
is a reaction that has resulted from
too much manufacturing for which
tbe morbid stimulai. t has been a
very high protective tariff.

It is said Mr. Cleveland is opposed
to an inauguration display exceeding
such as is usually indulged in on tbe
occasion. He is averse to posing be

another evidence of that sound com

he has been so justly distinguished.

Tbe Republican politicians are en
deavoring to stir up strife among the
negroes in Virginia. They want
them to emigrate to some State
where the g. o. p. is in a small mi

best thing the Virginia negroes can
do is to remain at home ; but if they
must move let tbem go to Maine,
where, under tbe wing of the great
waver of tbe bloody shirt, they may
find that protection which the Re
publican press assert is denied them
at their old homes.
Senator Hoar says the President

Mr. Hoar feels badly over this. It is
just a little strange that Mr. Arthur

suggestions" in his firet message. He
was then in a position to carry them

Monometallists in their crusade
against silver ignore the fact tha'

it was the measure of value iu this

united States until silver was de
monetized by the trickery of a few
gold standard men in Congress. Tbe

its currency was in a healthy condi

A message being received from tbe
House announcing tbe non concur
rence of that body in tbe Senate
amendment to tbe bill forfeiting tbe
unearned, Unds granted to tbe At
lantic A Pacific railroad. The Sen
ate insisted upon its amendments and
ordered a committee of conference.
The Chair appointed as such a com
mittee Morgan, Blair and Plumb.
Bil s were introduced and referred
by Blair, for the appropriation of
$5i),UOO to promote tbe colored peo
ples World's exposition to be held at
Chicago during September, 1885.
By Ingalls to amend tbe revised
statutes so as to make tbe day of in
auguration of a president of the
United States a legal holiday in tbe
District of Columbia.
Harrison contented (be bill as cov
ering that class 'ot legislation prop
erly telongiug to tbe territories. From
tbe number of branches provided for
by tbe bill be thought it likely tbe
company could monopolize all passes
through tbe mountains, and from tbe
other provisions it seemed tne com
pany could leave land enough to ab
sarb the public domain as well as
railways in tbe two ter; i tories named.
Dolph defended the bill as containing
only customarv provisions. Platt
said it had ceme to be tbe fashion in
the Uibited States to build railroads
without any cash capital, and that
tbe fashion of building railroads on
paper was making infinite mischief.
Wben railroads were so built people
were taxed twice as much for fares
and freights as they would be if roads
^ere built for casta in order
that roads may pay dividends on
tbe amount of capital stock. Vest
enquired if W. H. Armstrong, named
in tbe bill as «nie of the incorporators,
was a railroad commissioner instates.
Dolph replied be did not know.
Amendments, proposed by Hamou,
were agreed to, cutting off companies
right to consolidate with other roads
and branches Further cousidera
tlou was postponed by limitation o
time Executive session anjourned.
Allison submitted a joint resolution
which passed extending the time
fixed t«»ra submissi n of tbe report
of the joint commission appointed t *
consider tbe organization of the sig
nal service, and of other bur<aus«'f
the government. Dolph called up a
reported from the committee
bill
upon railroads at tbe last session,
providing for the incorporation of
the Spokane Falls and Cœur De
Alene railroad Company in ihe tei
ntories of Idaho and Wa-bington.

Washington, Dec. 7.— Three meas
ures of importance are mentioned as
likely to come up this week for dis
cussion in the senate. On Monday
Senator Slater intends to call up the
house bill to declare forfeited certain
lands granted to aid the construction
of à certain railroad, known as the
Oregon & Cali'ornia railroad bill. On
Tuesday Senator Harrison will call
up the bill for tbe admission of south
ern Dakota as a state The measure
is expected to give rise to considera
ble discus-ion, which will probably
be of a political character. On Thuie
day Senator Cullom will, if possible,
call up the interstate commerce bill.
It is probable tbe regular <»rder will
be temporarily laid aside early in tbe
week to give Senator Hill an oppor
tunity to make a speech on his "silver"
résolu t loi I r offei ed last week.
In the house Reagan intends press
ing his inter state commerce bill, the
discussion on which was begun last
week. It is thought a vote will be
taken on this measure by Thursday.
When the interstate commerce bill i*
out o£ the way. Representative Hew
itt will ask that the bill to carry out
the provisions of tbe Mexican reci
procity treaty, reported from the
ways and means committee last ses
sion. be considered.
Representative Payson intends to
urge the consideration of his bill to
restore to tbe public domain all the
lands held within tbe indemnity lim
its for railroad and wagon road coin
panics. He says tne passage of this
measure by congress Would open for
settlement, under tbe public land
laws, more than 120,000.000 acres.
The committee on public buildings
will make an effort to pass a number
of bills providing for the ereetkn of
buildings in various cities.
The Journalist.
Burlington Hawkeye: " I do not
see," remarked tbe Journalist, "how
I am going to get through my work
to-night. Iam wearied,overstrained,
and exhausted alretuiy.
And be sank wearily into a chair
and essayed to place his feet upon
the table.
"You look tired," said the news
paper man, looking up from bis
work. "You mast uot attempt to do
three men's work every day."
And there was a pitying accent in
bis voice that touched the wearied
Journalist deeply.
"You are right," he' said. "I
should not do it, but I must. So
much is expected of me now; so many
eyes are fixed upon the journal, every
line is scanned with ciitical intent,
every word We say is weighed, every
idea We aavance is discussed; Our
friends are expecting and demanding
much of Us. Our enemies are vigi
lant and aggressive. $ need rest;
without it I may die at my desk; b it
wbat can I do? I must really ask
you to help me out with the paper
to-night."
"I think i may be able to help you
a little," said a newspaper mao,
hanging a handful of copy on tbe

a little," said a newspaper mao,
hanging a handful of copy on tbe
hook. "I am a little busy just now
on that convention article, and i
have an appointment with Gov.
Snerman and Senator Allison* this
evening and expect to complete a
financial article beiore midnight, if
the telegraph matter does't take too
much of my time; hut i have three
columns of editorial already written,
and that, with other articles now
under way, and a few editorial
paragraphs 1 can make do for the
editorial page, aud then, after i look
over the markets and get up the com
mercial review tor the week i can do
something for You, What have
You to dn?
"I?" asked the Journalist, holding
bis throbbing temples with his hands.
"You may well ask what. I have to
go down and get the real estate trans
fers, and find out, what boat goes
down the river to-night.'*
If it wasn't for the assistance he is
compelled to render the Journalist, a
newspaper man wouldn't have
enough to do to keep b>m awake.
