IDE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
URATTLEBOKO!
fmdat, BnonMDnn
1883.
8 etrator Edmonds, In n recent letter to tbe
National League, stands by Ills Mormon lav,
and myt lie believes it to be operating favor
ably unit promises to Introduce another bill
similar to tbe one reported at tbe last Beesion
to supplement it. He adds that "with good
administration, without which all laws are
ueeleee," be has no doubt "wo shall gradual-
ly eitirpate this crime." i
The secretary of war and the secretary ot j
the naTy have united in a memorandum to I
Congress to the effect that it is nnadrisable, j
because extra-hazardous, to send another ei. ,
pedllion to the relief of Lieut. Qreely and j
his party this year. At the same time, it is 1
pointed out that Lieut. Qrcely's case is by no i
means hopeless, and that there is reasonable I
prospect that he will be able to take oare of ,
himself and bring his party out all right. i
We hope It was not with malice aforethought
that the Boston Adrertiser correspondent pub
lished his little yarn about Mr. Edmunds
"standing sponsor" for Col. Hooker and just
waiting for a chance to lift him into "the cov
eted sergeant-at-arms position." No surer
method could havo been devised to make Mr.
Edmunds coolly fold his arms and retire with
in the armor of his own dignity. If thero is
any one thing on which he prides himself it
is on standing sponsor for nobody and being
nobody's "man." Moreover, as the Itutland
Herald suggested last week, Col. Hooker
wouldn't thank tho Advertiser man, or any
body else, for intimating that he needs to be
"looked out for,"or is not abundantly ablo to
tako care of himself.
To tlu CongrtM of the Vnitfd State :
At the threshold of your deliberations I con
gratulate yon upon the favorable aspect of
the domestic and foreign affairs of this gov
ernment urn ronr.KiN helationh.
Our relations with other countries continue
to be upon a friendly footing. Witb the
Argentine Itepublic, llelgium, Hrnr.il, Den
mark, Ilayti, Italy, Banlo Domingo, Hweden
and Norway no Incident has occurred which
calls for special comment. The recent open
ing of now lines of telegraphic communica
tion with Central America and Brazil permit-
established at 22 stations under one flag,
which offers freedom to commerce and pro
hibits the slave trade. The objects ot tho so
ciety are philanthropic. It does not aim at
permanent political control, but seeks the
neutrality ot tbe valley. The United Blates
cannot be indifferent to this work, nor to the
interests of their citizens involved in it. It
may become advisable for ns to cooperate
with other coiumreisl mwors in promoting
the rights of trade and residence in the Congo
i alley free Iroui tbe interference or political
control of any one nation.
In view of the frequency of invitation from
foreign governments to participate in social
and scientific congresses for the discussion of
important matters of general concern, I re
peat tbo suggestion of my last message that
provisions be tnaue jor me exercise oi uiscre.
led the Interchange of messages of friendship tionary power by the executive in appointing
The annual message of l'residont Arthur,
which was laid before Congress on Tuesday,
is a concise, unpretentious, sensible docu
ment. Its summary of our relations with
foreign countries shows that they are all of a
favorable character. It discusses lucidly, and
at some length, questions relating to our cur
rency, and deprecates any "radical revision
or sweeping modification" of existing revenue
laws. The President thinks our sea-coast
cities and harbors should be suitably protect
ed from foreign invasion. He gives civil
service reform sympathetic recognition, fa
vors government aid to primary education,
and advocates heroic treatment for the Mor
mon evil. The message is of very moderate
length and few intelligent readers will choose
to omit its careful perusal.
with the coventors of those countries. Dur
ing the year there have been perfected and
proclaimed consular and commercial treaties
with Bervia and a consular treaty with ltou
mania, thus extending our intercourse with
the Danubian countries, while our Eastern re
lations have been put upon a wider basis by
treaties with Cores and Madagascar. The
new boundary-survey treaty with Mexico, a
trades-mark convention and a supplementary
treaty of extradition with Spain and conven
tions extending the duration of tho Franco
American claims commission have also been
proclaimed, Notice of '.bo termination of
the fisheries articles of tbe treaty of Washing
ton was duly given to tho British government,
and tbo reciprocal privileges and exemptions
of the treaty will accordingly cease on July
1, 1885.
Tbe question has arisen touching the depor
tation to the United States from the British
islands, by governmental or municipal aid, of
persons unable there to gain a living and
equally a burden on the community here.
Huuh of these porsons as were under the pau
per class as defined by the law havo been sent
back in accordance with tbe provisions of our
statutes. Her majesty's government has in
sisted that precautions have been taken be
fore shipment. There have been, however,
so many recent instances of needy emigrants
reaching our territory through Canada that a
revision of our legislation upon this subject
may be deemed advisable. Correspondence
relative to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty has been
continued, and will be laid before Congress.
The legislation of France against the im
portation of prepared swine products from
the United States has been repealed. That
result has been due no less to the friendly rep
resentatives of this government thau to a
growing conviction in France that the restric
tion is not demanded by any real danger to
health. Germany still prohibits the introduc
tion of all swine products from America. I
extended to tbo imperial government a friend
ly invitation to send experts to tho United
States to inquire whether the use of these
products was injurious to health. This invi
tation was declined. I havo believed it of
such importance, however, that the exact
facts should ue ascertained and promulgated,
delecatea to such conventions. Able special
ists are ready to serve the national interests
in such capacity without personal profit or
other compensation thau the defrayment of
expenses actually iucurred, and this n com
paratively small annual appropriation would
suffice to meet.
I havo alluded in my previous message to
tho injurious and vexatious restrictions suf
fered by our trade in tho Spanish West Indies.
Brazil, whose natural outlet for its great na
tional staple, coffee, is in and through tho
United States, imposes a heavy export duty
upon that product. Our petroleum exports
aro hampered in Turkey and other Eastorn
ports by restrictions as to storage and by ou
erous taxation. For theBo mischiefs adequate
relief is not always offered by reciprocity
treaties like that with Hawaii or that lately
negotiated with Mexico and now awaiting the
action of the senate. Is it not advisable to
provido some measure of equitable retaliation
in our relations with governments which dis
criminate against our own 'I It, for example,
the executive wcro empowered to apply to
Spanish vessels and cargoes from Cuba and
I'orto ltico the same rules of treatment and
Bcale of penalties for technical faults which
are applied to our vessels and cargoes in the
Antilles, a resort to that course might not be
barren of good results.
THE COCNTOX'S FINANCES.
Tbe report of the Secretary of the Treas
ury gives a full and interesting exhibit of tbe
financial condition of the country. It shows
that the ordinary revenues from all sources
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1883,
amounted to $3'J8,287,581.;5, whereof there
was received from customs, $214,700,4!IG !3j
from internal revenue, 6H4,7i;o,3li8 !8 j
from sales of public lands, $7,055,804.42 s
from tax on circulation and deposits of na
tional banks, $0,111,008.85 j from profits on
coinage, bullion, deposits and assays, $4,400,-
sult bas been a reduction of one-third, the
number at present being but 83.
THE VtAtl PETAIITMENT.
From the report of the secretary of war It
will be seen that In only a single instance has
there been any disturbance ol the quiet con
dition of our Indian tribes, a raid from Mex
too Into Arizona by a small patty of Indians
which wbs pursued by Oen. Crook into the
will not agaJ occur and that the Indian 'ft'ffii
acting should be made more'effective by tbe
Incorporation of some such stringent mess,
ures as they recommend, and as were Includ
ed in bill No. 2M8 on tbe calendar of the Sen.
ate at its last session. I am convinced, how
ever, tbat polygamy has beootue so strongly
intrenched in the territory of Utah that It is
profitless to attack it with any but the stout-
est weapons which constitutional legislation
can fashion. Iftvor, therefore, the repeal of
tribes which havo for so many years disturb,
ed tbe west will hereafter remain in peacea
ble submission.
I again call your attention to the present
condition of our extended sea coast upon
which are so many large cities whose wealth
and importance to tbe country would, in time
of war, invite attack from modern armored
ships against which our existing defensive
works could givo no adequate protection,
These works wero built beforo tbe introduc
tion of modern heavy rifled guns into mari
time warfare, and It they are not put into
efficient condition we may easily be subjected
to humiliation by a hostile power greatly in
ferior to ourselves. As germane to this sub
ject, I call your attention to tbe importance
of perfecting our submarine torpedo defenses.
On several occasions during the past year
officers of tbe army havo at the request ot
the stato authorities visited their militia en
campments for inspection of the troops.
From the reports of these officers I am in
clined to believe tbat tho encouragement of
Mature of the entire political control of the
territory, and the establishment of a commis
sion with suob powers and duties as shall be
delegated to it by law.
ACIMCULTUBE.
The department of agriculture Is accom
plishing much in the direction ot the agricul
tural development ot the country, and the re
port of the commissioner giving tbe results of
his investigations and experiments will be
found interesting and valuable. At his in
stauoe a oouventlou of those interested in
tbe cattle industry ot the country was lately
held at Chicago. Tho prevalence of pleuro
pneumonia and other contagious diseases of
acimals was one ot the chief topics of dis
cussion, and a committee of tbe convention
will invite your cooperation in investigating
tbe causes of these diseases, and providing
methods for their prevention and cure.
ALASKA.
I trust that Congress will not fail at its
present session to put Alaska under the pro-
tamlfnn nt law flat tiannla Viavn taonn tA f v an.

gratifying results and afford it in sudden
emergencies tbe aid of a large body of volun-
teerB educated in the performance of military
duties. '
TUE NAVI.
The secretary of the navy reports tbat un
der tbe authority of the actsot August 5, 1882,
and March 3, 18811, tho work of strengthen
ing our navy by tbe construction of modern
vessels bas been auspiciously begun. Three
cruslerB are in process of construction, the
Chicago, of 4 MX) tons displacement, and the
Boston and Atlanta, each of 2500 tons. They
are to be built of steel and in combination of
speed, endurance and armament, are expect
ed to compare favorably with the best unar
mored war vessels ot other nations. A fourth
vessel, tho Dolphin, is to bo constructed of
similar material and is intended to serve as a
fleet dispatch boat. Tho double turreted
monitors Puritan, Amphitrito and Terror,
havo been launched on the Delaware river,
and a contract has been made for the supply
ot their machinery. A similar monitor, the
Monadnock, has been launched in California.
Tho secretary urges the immediate creation
the maintenance and protection expressly
guaranteed ty me. terms or me treaty wbero
by that territory was ceded to tho United
States. For 1U years thoy have pleaded in
vain for that which they should have received
without asking, They have no law for the
collection of debts, the support of education,
tbe conveyance of property, the administra
tion of estates, or the enforcement of con
tracts. Nono, indeed, for the punishment of
criminals, except such as offend against cer
tain customs, commerce and navigation acts.
The resources of Alaska, especially in fur,
mines and lumber, aro considerable in extent
and capable of large development, while its
geographical situation is ono of political and
commercial importance. Tbe promptings of
interest, therefore, as well as tbe considera
tion of honor and good faith, demand imme
diate establishment of civil government in
tbat territory.
THE BAILBOAD QUESTION.
Complaints hare recently been numerous
and urgent tbat certain corporations control-
frequent deliberations in tbat body. It Is
greatly to lie hoped tbat tneae momentous
questions will find speedy solution lest cmer-
fancies may arlee when longer delay will be
mpossible and any determination, alMt tbe
wisest, may furnish cause for anxiety and
alarm.
THE VETO POWER.
For the reasons fully stated in my last an
nual message, I repeat my recommendation
that Congress propose an amendment to that
provision of the constitution which preeortbes
the formalities for the enactment of laws,
whereby, in respect to bills for the appropri
ation of publio moneys, the executive may be
enabled, while giving bis approval to partic
ular items, to interpose bis volo to such oth
ers as do not commend themselves to his
judgment.
TUE CIVIL MOOTS BILL.
The 14th amendment of tho constitution
confers the rights of citizenship upon all per
sons born or naturalized in tho United States
and subject to tbe jurisdiction thereof. It
was tbo special purpose of this amendment to
insuro to members of tbe colored race the full
enjoyment of civil and political rights. Cer
tain provisions intended to insure the enforce
ment of those rights have been recently de
clared unconstitutional by the supreme court.
Any legislation whereby Congress may law
folly supplement tbe guaranties which tho
constitution affords for tho equal enjoymont
by all the citizens of the United States, of ev
ery right, privilege and immunity of citizen
ship, will receive my approval.

Washington, D. C, December 3, 1883.
I Thfi PoilHsiler Unrrsl'i llrporl.
j Postmaster-General (Jresbam reports a to
tal postal revenue for tbe year of $15,508,
' 0'J2, being $1,001,281 in excess of all ex
pendltnres. In the fiscal year ending June
' 30, 1885, be anticipates a deficiency of about
! $8,000,000 on account of the reduction of
postage, to be supplied by appropriation,
i The wholo number of post-offices is now 47,
i 803, a net increase during tbe year of 1032
' There have been 12,502 appointments made
I during tbe year, or about 40 a day. The
postal service all told numbers 00,020 em
t ployes. Mr. Oresham recommends that the
unit of weight be raised for lettere carrying
single postsge from one-balf ounce to one
ounce, to correspond to the Euglish rate ; al
so tbat the rate for transient newspapers be
made one cent for three ounces instead of
one cent for two ounces as at present, be
I cause newspapers of large size tail to bo
transmitted because of deficient postage, thus
, causing vexation to tbe public. As to lotter
ies, be recommends tbo passage of an act
Last Tuesday, when a caucus of Bepubli
can senators was held, and a reorganization
of tho senate offices was proposed, Senators
Edmunds and Plumb blocked the movement
by announcing that they were opposed to a
change and should not vote for one. Mr. Ed
munds said that, under a government which
had declared for civil-service reform, he did
not believe Democratic officials should be re
moved simply to make room for ltepublicans;
the present Democratic senate officials were
good ones and should remain. Mahone and
ltiddleberger had Bent word that they would
act with the ltepublicans in choosing new offi
cers, but Mr. Edmunds evidently means to
havo no complication with them. This un
compromising action of tbe senator is tbe
worst blow yet at that venerable corner-stone
of Democratic political doctrine, "To the vic
tors belong tbe spoils." It will be observed
that none of the House Democrats show a dis
position to follow Mr. Edmunds's example.

! The coronation of the czar at Moscow af
I forded to this government an occasion for
j testifying its continued friendship, by sending
a special envoy and a representative of the
i navy to attend tbe ceremony. While there
I have arisen during the year no grave ques
! tions affecting the status in the Hussion cm
1 pire of American citizens of other faith than
I that held by the national church, this govern
ment remains firm in its conviction tbat the
! rights of its citizens abroad should be in no
' way affected by their religious belief,
i At no time in our national history has there
been more manifest need of close and lasting
relations with a neighboring state than now
exists with respect to Mexico. The rapid in
flux of our capital and enterprise into that
country shows by what has already been ac
complished tbe vast reciprocal advantages
which must attend the progress of its internal
development. Tbe treaty of commerce and

Carlisle for Sipeaker.
What seemed Drobable a week aero has
transpired in the election of John G. Carlisle I due citizens in Mexico now depend upon the
of Kentucky as Speaker of the House of ltep-
resentatives. At the Democratic caucus held
Saturday evening he received 104 votes
against 52 for ltandall and 32 for Cox of
New York, was declared the nominee, and
was elected on tbe assembling of tho House
on Monday by tbe solid vote of his party.
An analysis of tbe caucus proceedings shows
that he had 72 of the 02 Southern votes, sup
plemented by those of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa
and Michigan, while ltandall drew his
strength mainly from his own state, Ohio,
New York, New Jersey and Maryland.
The significance of Mr. Carlisle's election
is in tho fact that he is a pronounced tariff
domestic statutes of that republic. There have
been instances of harsh enforcement of tbe
laws against our vessels and citizens in Mexi
co, and of denial of the diplomatic resort for
their protection. Tbe initial step toward a
better understanding has been taken in tbe
negotiations by the commission authorized by
Congress, of a treaty which is still before the
Senate awaiting its approval The provision
for the reciprocal crossing of the frontier by
the troops in pursuit of hostile Indians have
been prolonged for another year. The oper
ations of the forces of both governments
against tbo savages havo been successful and
several of their most dangerous bands have
been captured or dispersed by the skill and
valor of United States and Mexican soldiers
fighting in a common cause. The convention
reformer and that the advocates of free trade, ; for the resnrvey of the boundary from the
South and West, secured him tbe office. The i Bio Grando to the Pacific having been ratlfi-
declaration in bis inaugural address that sud
den and radical changes in the laws and reg
ulations affecting the commercial and indus
trial interests of the people ought never to be
made, unless imperatively demanded by some
public emergency, is not consistent with his
course in the House where he has favored tho
most radical changes in the tariff, and were he
as conservative as his utterance indicates, he
could not control the hot-beads of his party.
The ltepublicans are complacent over the
event, while the Northern Democrats are
alarmed at tbo possible course which the
again dominant Southerners may pursue.
Tho leading Democratic journals deprecate
the election. The New York Sun calls it a
ed and exchanged the preliminary reconnois
sance therein stipulated has been effected. It
now rests with Congress to make provision
for completing the survey and relocating the
boundary monuments.
Our geographical proximity to Central
America and our political and commercial re
lations with tbe states of that country, justify
in my judgment such It matsrial Increase of
our consular corps as will place at each capi
tal a consul general. The contest between
Bolivia, Chili and Peru has passed from the
stage of strategic hostilities to tbat of nego
tiation, in which the counsels of this govern
ment have been exercised. The demands of
Chili for ab6oluto cession of territory have
been maintained nnd accepted by tbe party
of Gen. Iglesias to tbe extent of concluding a
treaty of peace with the government of Chili,
misfortune and declares that it means free I in general conformity to tbe terms of the pro
i.aI .-.! n . i i t- i . 1 4 a i. nuii:..
trado and nothing less, nnd the World finds
consolation in the fact that a Republican Sen
ate and President will prevent the Speaker
and his party from doing much harm. i
Mr. ltandall is a conservative, a firm be- .
liever in proteotiou for American industries, I
a born party leader, and when in the chair
has had the power of holding his party in
check and of restraining it from unsafe legis
lation. No man would have been so likely
as he to have led bis party to victory in 1884.
This election and that of Southern men for
Clerk and Doorkeeper evinces a determina
tion by the South no loujer to follow, but
hereafter to lead the Democracy as in ante
bellum times. Tbe Northern Democrats evi
dently are not pleased with the present pros
pect ot following.
Oonffren,
The Forty-eighth Congress assembled at
noon on Monday. As is stated above, the
Democrats of the House elected Mr. Car
lisle speaker. The ltepublicans "vindicated"
Keifer of Ohio by making him their candi
date and giving him 112 votes. The Demo
crats ran upon a snag at the outset in the
Chalmers-Manning contested election cose in
tbe Second Mississippi district and did not
complete their organization until Tuesday.
Tho Senate was called to order by Mr. Ed
munds and tne new Senators were Bworn in.
On Tuesday the Uoubs sent the Mississippi
election case to the Committee on Elections
and completed its organization by electing
John B. Clark of Missouri clerk, John P.
Ludon of Ohio sergeant-at-arms, and J. G.
Wintersmith of Texas doorkeeper. The
drawing of seats was then proceeded with.
At 1:50 tbe President's message was laid be
fore both houses.
In tbe Senate no less than 227 bills were
introduced, Tbe four most important were
brought forward by Senator Edmunds, and
were for a postal telegraph, for the further
protection of colored citizens in their oivil
rights, for the improvement of American
commerce, and for the suppression of polyg
amy. Tbe leading feature of tbe last-named
bill is a provision abolishing woman suffrage
in Utah. The civil rights bill provides for
the transfer from state to United States courts
of all cases where any question shall arise
affecting the civil rights of any person on ao
count of race, color or previous condition of
servitude. Tbe postal telegraph bill contem
plates four trunk lines crossing the country
diagonally, constructed by a government
board and officered entirely under the civil
service law, Tbe working and operation of
the lines are to be under the direction and
charge of tbe postmaster-general, and noth
ing in the act is to be construed as prohibit,
ing individuals or corporations from operat
ing telegraph lines.
On Wednesday, In tbe Senate, Senator
Morrill made.a speech on the silver coinage
and certificate question, taking strong ground
against tbe further coinage of 85-cent dollars.
Tbe House adjourned over to Monday to per.
tocol signed in May last between the Chilian
commander and Gen. Iglesias. As a result of
tbe conclusion of this treaty, Gen. Iglesias
has been formally recognized by Chili as
President of Peru and his government install
ed at Lima, which has been evacuated by the
Chilians. A call has been issued by Gen.
Iglesias for a representative assembly to be
I elected on the thirteenth of January, and to
meet at Lima on the first ot March next.
Meanwhile, the provisional government of
Gen. Iglesias has applied for recognition to
the principal powers of America and Europe.
When tbe will of the Peruvian people shall
be manifested, I shall not hesitate to recog.
nize tbe government approved by them.
1 At the recent coronation of his majesty,
1 King Kalakaua, this government was repre
sented, both diplomatically and by tbe form
al visit of a vessel of war. Tbe question ot
terminating or of modifying tbe existing reci
procity treaty with Hawaii is now before Con.
gress. I am convinced that the charges of
abuse and frauds under tbat treaty have been
exaggerated, and I renew the suggestion ot
last year's message, that the treaty be modi
fied wnererer its provisions nave proved
revenues. $10,008,432.73 , for oxpcnditureB
on account of District of Columbia, $3,817,
028.48 ; for interest on the public debt, $511,.
100.131.25: leaving a surplus revenue of
$132,87'.,444.41, which with an account
drawn from tbe cash balance from tbe treas
ury of $l,2H0,312.5.i makes $134,178,750.00.
Tbe revenue for the present fiscal year, ac
tual and estimated for tbe quarter ending
September 30, 1883, is $217,033,082 07. The
actual and estimated expenses for the same
period are $258,000,000.
If the revenue for the fiscal year which
will end on Juno 30, 1885, be estimated upon
tbe basis of existing laws, the secretary is of
tbo opinion that for that year tbe receipts
t will exceed tne ordinary expenditures du.-
000,000, including tbe amount devoted to the
sinking fund. Hitherto the surplus as rapid-
ly as it has accumulated, has been devoted to
j the reduction of the national debt. As a re
sult, tbe only bonds now outstanding which
! are redeemable at the pleasure of the govern
ment aro tbo 3 per cents, amounting to about
$305,000,000, tbe 4 per cents amounting to
$250,000,000, and the $737,000,000 4 per
cents which are not payable until 1801 and
1007 respectively. If the surplus shall here
after be as large as tbe treasury estimates
now indicate, the 3 per cent bonds may all
be redeemed at least four years before any of
tho 4 cents can be called in. The latter at
the same rate of accumulation of surplus can
be paid at maturity, and the money requisite
for tbo redemption of tbe 4 per cents will be
in tbe treasury many years before tbeso obli
gations become payable. There are reasons,
however, why tbe national indebtedness
should not be thus rapidly extinguished.
Chief among them is tbe fact tbat only by ex-
i cessive taxation is such rapidity attainable.
In a communication to Congress at its last
I session I recommended that all excise taxes be
abolished except those relating to distilled
Bpirit6, and that substantial reductions also
be made in tbe revenues from customs. A
statute bas since been enacted by which the
annual tax and tariff receipts of the govern
ment have been cut down to tbe extent of at
least $50,000,000 or $00,000,000. While I
have no doubt that still further redactions
may be wisely made, I do not advise tbe
adoption at this session of any measures for
large diminution of tbe national revenues.
Tbe results of the legislation ot the last ses
sion of Congress have not as yet become suf
ficiently apparent to justify any radical re
vision or sweeping modification of existing
law in tbe interval which must elapse before
the effects of the act of March 3, 1883, can
be definitely ascertained. A portion, at least,
of tbe surplus revenues may be wisely ap
plied to the long neglected duty of rehabili
tating our nary and providing coast defen
ses for tbe protection of our harbors. This
is a matter to which I shall again advert.
THE CCEEESOV.
Immediately associated with the financial
subject just discussed is the important ques
tion, what legislation is needed regarding tbe
national currency. Tbe aggregate amount of
bonds now on deposit in the treasury to sup
port the national bank circulation is about
$350,000,000. Nearly $200,000,000 of this
amount consists of 3 per cents, which, as al
ready stated, are payable at the pleasure of the
government, and aro likely to be called in
within less than four years unless, meantime,
the surplus revenues shall be diminished.
The probable effect of such an extensive re
tirement of the securities which are the basis
of the national bank circulation, would be

can withhold his oonsent.
tue tost orricE ceimmment.
The report of the posttuaster.general con
tains a gratifying exhibit of the condition
and prospects of this interesting branch of
the public service committed to his care. It
appears that on June 30, 1883, the whole
number of post-offices was 47,863, of which
1032 were established during the previous fis
cal year. The number ot offices operating
under tbe system of free delivery was 154.
At these latter offices the postage on local
matter amounted to $1,105,230, a sum ex
ceeding by $1,021,801 the entire cost of tbe
carrier servioe of the country. The rate of
postage on drop letters passing through these
oflioes 1b now fixed by law at two cents per
I balf-ounue or fraction thereof. In offices
where the carrier Bystem has not been estab
I lished, tbe rate is only half as large. It will
bd remembered that in 1603, wneu free deliv
ery was first established by law, the uniform
single rate postage upon local letters was one
cent, and so it remained until 1872, when in
those cities where carrier service was estab
lished it was increased iu order to defray the
expense of such service. It seems to me that
tbe old rate may now with propriety be re
stored, and that too, even at the ruk of di
minishing for a time at least the receipts
from postage upon local letters.
Tbe postmaster-general devotes much of bis
report to the consideration in its various as
pects of tbe relations of tbe government to
the telegraph. Such reflection as I have been
able to give to the subject since my last an.
nual message has not led mo to change tbe
view which I there expressed in 'dissenting
from the recommendation of the postmaster
general tbat the government assume the same
control over the telegraph which it has always
exercised over the mail. Admitting tbat its
authority in tbe premises is as ample as has
ever been claimed for it, it would not, in my
judgment, be a wise use of that authority, to
purchase or assume tho control of existing
telegraph lines or to construct others, with a
view of entering into general competition
with private enterprise. The objections
which may be justly urged against either of
these projects, and indeed against any system
which would require an enormous increase in
resorted In their dealings with tbe public
divers measures unjust and oppressive in their
character Iu some instances the state gov
ernments have attacked and suppressed these
evils, but in others they have been unable to
afford adequate relief because of tho jurisdio- !
tional limitations which are imposed upon
them by tbe federal constitution. Tbe ques- '
tion how far the national government may
lawfully interfere in tbe premises and what,
if any, supervision and control it ought to ex
erciso, is one which merits your careful con
sideration. Whilo we cannot fail to recog
nize the importance of tbe vast railway sys
tems of tbe country and their great and ben
eficial influences upon the development of
our material wealtb, we should, on the other
baud, remember tbat no individual and no
corporation ought to be invested with abso
lute power over tbe interest of any other citi
zen or class of citizens. Tbe right of these
railway corporations to a fair and profitable
return upon their investments and to reason
able freedom in their regulations must be reo
ognized, but it seems only just tbat, so far
as its constitutional authority will permit,
Congress should protect the people at large
in their interstate traffic against acts ot in
justice which tbe state governments are pow
erless to prevent.
PROTECTION Or THE FORESTS.
In my last annual message I called atten
tion to the necessity of protecting by suita
ble legislation tbe forests Bituated upon the
public domain. In many portions of the
west the pursuit of general agricul
ture is only made practicable by resort to ir
rigation, while successful irrigation would it
self be impossible without the aid afforded
by forests iu contributing to tbe regularity
and constancy of tbe supply of water. Dur
ing tbe past year severe suffering and great
loss ot property have been occasioned by
profuse floods, followed by periods of unus
ually low water iu many ot the great rivera
of the couutry These irregularities were in
a great measuro cansed by the removal from
about the sources of the streams in question
of the timber by which tbe water supply had
been nourished and protected. The preser
vation of such portion of forests in tbe na
tional domain as essentially contribute to the
equable flow of important water courses is
of the highest consequence. Important
tributaries of the Missouri, tbe Columbia and
the Saskatchewan rise in the mountains of
Montana near tbe northern boundary of the
United Slates, between tbe Blackfeet and
i Flathead ledum reservations. This region is
I unsuitable for settlement, but upon tne riv-
era which flow from it depends in the fu
i ture the agricultural development of a vast
tract ot couutry Tbe attention of Congress
I is called to the necessity of withdrawing from
public sale this part of tbe public domain
and establishing there a forest preserve.

to some of the plans which have lately pro
voked public comment and discussion. It
has been claimed, for example, that Congress
might wisely authorize tbe postmaster-general
to contract with some private persons or
corporation for tbe transmission of messages
at specified rates and under government su
pervision. Various such schemes of the
samo general nature, but widely differing in
their special characteristics, have been sag.
gestedin tbe publio prints, and the arguments
I by wnicn tuey nave peen supporiec and op.
posed have doubtless attracted your atten

be considered by you at tbe present session,
i In the nature of things it involves so many
i questions of detail tbat your deliberations
I would probably be aided but slightly, if at '
1 all, but any particular suggestions which I
might now submit. I avow my belief, how.
. ever, that tbe government should be author
ized by law to exercise some sort ot super
I vision over interstate telegraph communica-
tion, and I express the hope that for attaining
that end some measure may be devised which
will reoeive your approbation.

Early Monday morning Salmon, the mur
derer of Mrs. Ford and tbe Buddy father and
child, sent for tbo sheriff, who found the
prisoner in a broken condition. He told the
sheriff be wanted to make a clean confession.
He said be killed Mrs. Ford at 0 o'clock SaU
nrday morning. He did not attempt to out
rage ber. She was killed in a drunken squab
ble. She showed signs of life five minutes
and he made several attempts to bring her to
lite. Failiug, be became frightened, cut the
body at tbe knees, put it into a trunk and
started out with it on a wheelbarrow to try to
contrive some way to conceal It. His first
thought was to hide tbe body somewhere and
then drown himself. After starting upon
the road it occurred to him to go to Buddy's,
lie had no intention then of injuring the
Buddy family. Further than taking the
trunk into Buddy g house he had formed no
j plan to dispose of tbe body At night, after
I all bad retired, Salmon became so nervous
and frightened that he could not sleep, and
got up and waiaed about tne bouse. Tbe
Buddy family did not know what was in tbe
trunk. They got up and dressed. Salmon
imagined the house was surrounded by peo
ple. "I walked about the bouse," be says,
"until about 3 o'clock, when it occurred to
me I might kill the whole of them and burn
the bouse. Tbe very moment tbat thought
' came to me I struck Buddy. His wife ran
out. There was a light on the table. When
I she came in the room I grabbed at her, and
I struck her with the hatchet. She screamed.
The child was screaming also. I took him
off the bed, but do not remember cutting
bim with the hatchet At this time the trunk
bad not been opened. I chopped tho trunk
and turned tbe body of Mrs. Ford oat on tbe
floor in some way I pulled tbe bed-clothing
around every way and poured kerosene over
it and set it on fire. Tben I ran out into the
street and started for Plymouth." Up to the
timo of this confession Salmon had protested
bis innocence. Mrs. ItudJy is recovering
from her wounds.

We seek no monopoly of Its commeroe and

nient tne utter course is far preferable. 1
commend to your attention the very interest
ing and thoughtful suggestions upon this sub
ject which appear in tbe secretary's report.
The objections whicb be urges against the
acceptance of any other securities than tbe
obligations of tbe government itself as a
' foundation for national bank circulation seem
to me insuperable.
For averting the threatened contraction,
' two courses have been suggested, either of
which is probably feasible ; one is the issu
ance of new bonds baring many years to
run, bearing a low rate of interest, and ex
changeable npon specified terms for those
now outstanding. The other course, which
commends itself to my own judgment as the
tion have confided in this repnblic,we cannot I better, is the enactment of a law repealing
regard with indifference any encroachment tbe tax on circulation, and permitting the
on their rights.
China, by the payment of a money indem
nity, has settled certain ot tbe long pending
claims of our citizens and I have strong hopes
tbat tbe remainder will soon be adjusted.
There is good reason to believe that tbe laws
restricting the immigration of Chinese have
banks to issue notes for an amount equal to
00 per cent of tbe market value, instead of
as now the face value of their deposited
bonds. I agree with the secretary in tbe be
lief tbat the adoption of this plan would af

The same considerations which prompted
Congress at its last session to return to Japan

quire at Its hands like action in respect to the

vision of the foreign treaties of Japan has
been considered in an international conference
held at Toklo, but without definite result as
yet.
The rich and populous valley of the Congo
is being opened to commeroe by a society
called tbe International African association.
of which the King of tbe Belgians is president
and a citizen of the United Slates the chief
executive officer. Large tracts of territory
have been oeded to tbe association by native
chiefs. Koads have been opened, steamboats
ascertained by its weight and fineness. It
never bad a legal tender quality. Large num
bers of these coins entered, however, into
the volume of our currency. By common
oonsent their circulation in domestic trade
has now ceased, and tbey have thus become
a disturbing element. They should not be
longer permitted to embarrass our currency
system. I recommend that provision be
made for their reception by tbe treasury and
mints as bullion, at a small percentage above
the current market price of silver of like fine
ness. The secretary of tbe treasury advises a con
solidation of certain of the customs districts
of tbe country, and suggests tbat tbe presi
dent be vested with such power in relation
thereto as is now given him in respect to col.
lectors of internal revenue by section 3141 of
tbe ltevised Statutes. Tbe statistics of this
subject, whicb ure contsined in bis report,
furnish of themselves a strong argument in
defense of bis views. At tbe adjournment of
Congress tho number of internal revenue col
lection districts was 120. By executive order,
dated June 25, 1883, I directed that certain
mit Mr. Carlisle to make up his committees. placed on the river, and the nuclei of states I of these districts be consolidated. The r-
ney-general in the belief that tbe statutes
should be revised by whicb fees are regulat
ed. So, too, should tbe laws which regulate
tbe compensation of district attorneys and
marshals. Tbey should be paid wholly by sal
aries,instead of in part by fees.aa is now the
case. The change would prove to be a meas
ure of economy, and would discourage tbe
institution of needless and oppressive legal
proceedings whicb, it is to be feared, bavs in
some instances been conducted for the mere
sake of personal gain.
TUE rNTEMOB DEPASTHXNT.
Much interesting and varied information is
contained in the report of the secretary of
the interior. I particularly call your attention
to bis presentation of certain phases of the
Indian question, to his recommendations for
tbe repeal of tbe preemption and timber cul
ture acts, and for more stringent legislation
to prevent frauds nnder the pension laws.
The Btatnes that prescribe tbe definitions and
punishments of crimes relating to pensions
could doubtless be made more effective by cer
tain amendments and additions which are
pointed out in the secretary's report.
I have previously referred to the alarming
state of Illiteracy in certain portions of the

TUE UTAH QUESTION,
The Utah commission submitted to tbe
secretary of tbe interior its second annual re
port as a result of its labors in supervising
tbe recent election in that territory, pursuant
to the act of March 22, 1882. It appears
that the persons by that act disqualified, to
the number of about 12,000, were excluded
from the polls. This fact, however, affords
little cause for congratulation, and I fear it is
far from indicating any real and substantial
progress toward the extirpation of polygamy.

The annual report of tbo civil-service com
mission, which will soon be submitted to Con
gress, will doubtless furnish the means of a
more definite judgment than I am now pre
pared to express as to the merits of tbe new
system. I am persuaded that its effects have
thus far proved beneficial. Its practical meth.
ods appear to be adequate for tbe ends pro
posed, and there has been no serious difficul.
ties in carrying them into offect. Since July

appointed to the public servioe, in tbe class!,

ments, or at any of tbe post-offices and cus

conformity to tbe rules.
FBESIPENTIAL SUCCESSION
At tbe time when tbe present executive en
tered upon bis office, bis death, removal, res.
ignation or inability to discharge his duties,
would hare left the government without a
