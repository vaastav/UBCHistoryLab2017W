THE HOUSE COttXlTTEES.
Kpmkrr 'nrllle to Appoint the Very
Be I On lor the .
,X Washington special says: In regard
to the formation of committees, it is under
stood Speaker Carlisle will, without regard
to support in his canvass or ersoi!al pref
erences, assign, as far as possible, the very
best men to tho several committees. The
Klcction Committee will.as far xs in his
power, te made up ol the unrest men,
Mr. Carlisle being oposed to making it
stronglv partisan. Mr. Springer, of Illi
nois, was the last Democratic t liairnuui of
that committee. ;
The Ways and Means w ill be formed of
IVmocrats whose views ore in accord with
those of the niajoritv. Naturally the
name of Mr. William li. Morrison is asso
ciated with the position of chairman. He
tilled this position in the Forty-fourth Con
gress, but was prevented from bringing
tho committee labor to an end
by the death of Speaker Kerr ami
the election of Mr. Randall at the short
session, when the turmoil of the Presi
dential count also contributed its share
to defeat the .proposed tariff revision.
There is little prospect of New Unlaud
having IVmoeralie representation upon
it. Mr. Morse, of Boston, it is said, would
prefer I hi) chairmanship of Naval Affairs
to being on the Ways und Means. The
New York member wlil l either Mr. Cox
or Mr. Hewitt. Mr. Hurd, of Ohio;
Blount, of (ieorrria; Tucker, of Virginia;
Hancock or Mills, of ToxitS, with two
members from the Northwestern States,
will prohablv make up the eight Iemo-
crats. Mr. Mills was a member ot that
ienmmittec In the Forty-sixth Congress,
while Mr. Johftllancock was the mcmK-jr
in the Foity-ionrtU Congress. Of the live
Republicans on the Ways and Means Mr.
Anderson, of Kansas, who is for revenue
reform, will probably lie associated w ith
Mr. telle v, Mr. Keiler, Mr. Kasson and
Mr. Newt.'
To the ApprociuC'oNS Committee is as
signed Mr. Randall and mui Democrats
as can harmoniously assist him. It is
likely the formation of this" committee
will give Mr. Carlisle much anxiety.
Mr. Bnekner, of Missouri, formerly
chairman of the Banking and Currency
Committee, will not decline the leader
ship of that committee, nor will Mr. James
W. Throckmorton, of Texas, tlie chairman
ship of tho Pacific Railroad Committee,
held by him in the Forty-fifth Congress.
The Commerce Committee will naturally
go to Judge Reagan, its chairman in the
Forty-lifth and Forty-sixth Congresses,
and the Public Lands to Mr. tieorge L.
Converse, of Ohio, who had it in the
Forty-sixth Congress. The Postotlices and
Postroails might still be claimed by Mr.
II. I). Money, who was its head two ses
sions ago.
The Judiciary will lie one of strongest
committees in the House. Messrs. Cul
Issrson, of Texas, Hammond, of Georgia,
and Hurd, of Ohio, served on that com
mitteo in the Forty-sixth Congress. Mr.
Scales, of North Carolina, would no doubt
be glad to resume the chairmanship of
Indian Affairs, which he has held three
times, as would Mr. Cox of Foreign Af
fairs, Mr. Muldrow of Territories, and
Cabell of Railways and Cana'.a. Gen.
liosecrans is assigned to Military, and
Ieopold Morse to Naval Affairs. Casey
Young will look for Public Buildings and ,
J rounds ; Bland, of Missouri, for Coinage,
Weights and Measures; Willis, of Ken-:
tucky, for Kducation and Labor, on which
he served in the Forty-fifth, Forty-sxth
and Forty-seventh Congresses, and Hatch,
of Missouri, the Committee on Agricul
ture, of which he is an old member.
So fur, therefore, as the chairmanships
of important committees are concerned,
Mr. Carlisle will have but little trouble in
rewarding his friends by giving them
places they have hitherto occupied in the
Forty-fourth, Forty-fifth and Forty-sixth
Congresses. The composition of the en
tire list will not be so easily arranged,
there being over a hundred new Demo
cratic members to provide for in making
up the niajoritv list on each committee.
The Elections, Ways and Means, Appro
priation, Judiciary(of which Mr. Black
burn will probably be the head), Banking
and Currency, and one or two other com
mittees will have the strength of the
Democratic side. The unimportant com
mittees will give chairmanships to a num
ber of ambitious members. How soon
Speaker Carlisle may be able to formulate
this work will depend upon those whose
wishes will be consulted in assigning them
to duty with the several committees.
APPROPRIATIONS FOR 1SS5.

the Nerretnry of tbe Trewtury.
Washington, December 5. Tho Secre
tary of the Treasury has transmitted to
Congress estimates of the appropriations
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 18vS5.
The amount estimated as required for all
the expenses of the government is 28:!,
l'.'5,:;05, which is $2-',3J3,2s2 less than the
aggregate appropriations for the present
fiscal year, and So7,154,S57 less than the
sum called for in the estimates sub
mitted last year. The appropriations
for tbe present fiscal year, includ
ing deficiencies and miscellaneous, are
$:J05,44H,.")87. The estimates upon which
these appropriations are based called for
S J10,2S0,1G2. Tho estimates submitted to

ment, $22,04-3,003; foreign intercourse,

214; the postal service, 2,9.38, 112; miscel
laneous, S2-3,:;93,ft!-3 ; permanent annual
appropriation, sll.3,147,0:J7. The esti
mates in the above cases, except pen
sions, foreign intercourse and permanent
annual appropriations, are for larger sums
than those appropriated fo? the present

sions for the present fiscal year amount e 1 to
(,570,287; ioreignintercoursel$2,177,.'S4 ;
permanent annual appropriations, (-'117,-r2'.l,521.
Some estimates which show in

ia.tycar are as follows: Increase in the
military establishment, ?1. 001,05.3; naval
establishment, Si,707,:iM ; Indian affairs,
$2, 127,473 ; public works, $11,78!,303;
postal service, $2,942,087 ; miscellaneous,
1,102,1)17. The increase in the estimates
for the naval establishment is due to pro
visions for completing steel cruisers, mon
itors and dispatch-boats. The increase in
the estimates for public works is owing,
principally, to tbe item of $8,02.3.500 for
improving rivers and harbors, nnd the in
crease in the estimates for public build
ings fioin $1 ,.301,:;00 to j:!,S47,'.)ii7. The in
crease in the estimates for the ' postal
service is to cover the deficiency in the
revenues. The estimates for rivers and
harbors are as follows: Kxaminutions and
surveys oi tbe South Pass of tho Missis
sippi river, 17,-300; ganging the waters
of tho lower Mississippi and its tributa
ries, iOOOO; gauging the waters of the
Columbia rivur, $j000; improving rivers
and luirbors, to bo expended on such
works authorized by Congress, $8,000,000.

He thought that if the free trade question was

.Mr. William It. Yandcrbot was seen jnst as he
wn e&torinic his carriam to go to the oiiera. V.x
eusing himself for his haste, ho said he thontcht
the election of Mr. Carlisle an eminently wise
one.
Mr. Henry Clews, the banker, said: I regard
the election ol Mr. Carlisle a an excellent choice.
I do not tt;!UK the question of lroo trade was
taken into consideration w-hen the selection was
made, but that the gentleman wu cho-.cn for his
Mtiierior ability ami fitness for the position. He
is ti man who treads on nobody's toes, and by his
i'airnt-ss and g.md will for all lias made a host of
friends, so that, when the time arrives to plaoe
him in an exalted position, those friends clus
tered around him."
Several brokers, among thetn E. L. Clarke and
I.. It. Itiuleau, expressed themselves a highly
pleased w ith the choice and all were unanimous
lu declaring they did not think Mr. t-ajji.le's
freo-tradc principle, would be brought out during
his administration.
"There are oilier men." said Mr. Clarke, "who
are less outsHken on the subject and who would
have been much iitore dangerous in tiie chair
than Mr. Carlisle. The time will come and er
hap not many years hence, w hen free trade will
Ik- an established fact, and to that time the wh.de
linaucial world is looking forward with trembling
fear, as disaster, to a greater or less t-xlout, will

Mr. Ksterbrook. the pen nianuf:tcturcr. who is
IHTsvnally aciuninted with Mr. Carlisle, said be
mrw the SKakcr was not a free-trader at heart,
but for the sake of indiey.- lie regarded the cry
of free trade as a party measure, inaugurated and

President and Senate he will not be in a position
to do much."
Yioe-Presiilcnt-Fahnestuck, of the First Nation
al Bank, said : ''Carlisle's election is not a mat
ter that will affect commercial interesU either
way."
President Cox. of the Mechanics Bank, said:
4I am pleased with Mr. Carlisle's election to the
Speakership. I think it is the best selection that
could have been made. His election will have no
bearings on the financial Question."
President Hatch, of the Stock Exchange: "I
don'( think Mr. Carlisle's election will have an
unfavorable effect on finances, 'the new Seaker
is a very Tir, honest and conservative man, who
apires to be a statesman rather than a dema
gogue, so that so far as his personal influence
goes I don't think he will further any very radi
cal legislation or any legislation which bis judg
ment could be convinced was calculated to be
injurious to the country. Knowing Messrs. Car
lisle and Randall both, personally I shonld not
have felt that there would have been any great
difference so fur as the business interests of the
country are concerned, by the election of either
of them."
President Randolph, nf the Continental Bank,
said: "The measures Mr. Carlisle hasoriginatea
in Congress nffecting national banking, have not
always been such us the b&nktr could applaud;
but, apart from that, he undoubtedly possesses
eminent qualifications for the Seakersbip."
President Baldwin, of the Fourth Nationnl
Bank, said: "I regard Mr. Carlisle as a man of
great ability, who will feet tbe responsibilities of
is position and act with a conservative regard to
the wants of the country. I feel satisfied that be
has informed himself to a very great extent upon
the financial question, and I regard his election
as fspenkeras quite satisfactory from a financial
point of view. I think he will go very -carefully
on the financial question ; be very conservative,
and give neither of tho political parties cause for
complaint, but he governed by what he thinks is
to the best iuterest of the country rather than to
a party."
President Tanpan, of the Gallatin National
Bank, said: "1 don't think Mr. Carlisle's elec

The Tonqnln Question.
Pahis, December 5. The yellow book
upon tne lonooin affair was distributed
among the Deputies to-day. It contains
the Chinese memoranda, which Prime
Minister Ferrv on the 28th ultimo gave to
the Tonquin Credits Committee. Marouis
Tseng regrets that France regards the oc
cupation of Sontay and Bac Ninh as indis
pensable to tne settlement of the question
at issue. He also fails to see the necessity
of France occupying those places which
she is aware the Chinese hold.
Marquis Tsens comments uion the state
ment made by M. Ferry in the Chamber
of Deputies, on the ulst of October, that
the French government did not believe
that China "would declare war, nor had
r ranee any intention ot doing so; that
France was desirous of firmly establishing
herself in the lted river delta by gaining
possession of Sontay and Bac Ninh ; that-
wnen tnat was acnieved nobody would le
able to drive her out ; that with patience,
long froid and her forces she would be
proof against everything, and that a prut
dent policy would lead to the settlement
of the Tonquin affair. The marquis ob
serves that this statement produced a pow
erful impression in Tonquin. Ii it became
question ol the possession of Tonnntn.
further negotiations would bo useless, as
it will be impossible for China to agree
thereto. On November 30th M. Ferry
declared that the ideas of the French gov
ernment had not changed in the last three
years; that the French policy was guid
ed by the principles which "formed the
basis of the treaty of 1874. The govern
ment desired consolidation, a F'renchpro
tectorate, the free navivatio of the Tong
koi river and security for its commercial
relations in Tonquin. The Marquis Tseng
having renewed the proposal to fix the
line of demarcation between the armies in
the cantonments of Hanoi and at Sontay
and on the banks of Red river. Ferrv
pointed out that Marouis Tseno- iIk-Iuco,"!
on the 1st of August that there were no
Chinese troops in Tonquin, whereupon
Challemel Laeour, then French Minister
of Foreign Affairs, replied that there was
consequently no danger of a conflict. II
tiie Chinese forces aimroached the
fortresses against which the Fiench were
advancing they would run the risk of
being considered Anamite auxiliaries.
Since then, added Ferry, the situation re
mained unchanged by our acts. Our plan
of the camoai-'ll is not modified, nnd can.
not be modified. It is not with us that
theesponsibility for a conflict will rest.
Active negotiations between Marouis
Tseng and Ferry have been suspended
since the latter's note of November oOth.

livered a long lecture. here last evening

emigration, and expatiated upon the mar
velous progress by tho various towns.
Ixird Lome concluded bv savins that the
Canadian people were thoroughly devoted
to their connection with the mother Court-
try, otherwise they would long ago have
discarded their allegiance, of which they
are proud. With the Dominion of Canada
and the A ustralian colonies in close rela

Irishman had the choice of a government
situation who had not first become a

D. Sullivan, member of Parliament, re
ferring to the action ot the govern

had not been tke custom for the
Nationalists to interfere with Orange cele

UREAT EXCITEMENT

president ol the txcliantre Bank, and feel
ing is tuuitod completely jroin the groftt
defaulter to the directors, who allowed
him to escape, and some of whom are
alleged to be at least privy to his de
linquency. The condition of the huk is
considered far below that represented by
the statements yesterday, and some men
consider that it will be double the liability
paid up, and there will still be adt-li: iency
of twenty-five or thirty per cent, toward
liquidating the liabilities. Depoitors and
other creditors and shareholdcio are or
ganizing to resist the directors being ap
pointed liquidators, as they are elected by
their own votes. His wife writes that the

Western Nail Association met to-day, and
after a protracted session tiie resolution
passed it the last meeting, ordering
general suspension of nail-mills for five
weeks from the 22d instant, was rescinded.
This action waa brought about by a num
ber of manufacturers refusing to shut
down, as they did not consider a suspen
sion at this time advisable. The discussion
of the subject was heated. Trade was re
ported fair, with stocks still low.
THE FIELD TRIALS.
Menspbla Setters. Oath and Kne, to Con
tend for First Money To-Day. '
Fine Field for tbe Derty-Sew OIBeers
of the Kennel Clnb.
Yesterday was the third dav of tbe
Field Trials at Orand Junction. The con
test was for the All-Age Stakes. This stake
has been open for contest during the past
three days, and is now confined to two
Memphis dogs, and the last trial for it will
be run this morning. Then will come the
Derby Stakes, and after that the Champion
Stakes, to be contended for by the first
class prize winners.
There is a good attendance of first-class
dog-fanciers. The judges are three of the
most competent Capt. Jarvis, of New
Hampshire; Patrick Henry, of Clarksville,
and Capt. W. H. Key, of Florence, Ala.
Among the dog-fanciers well known to the
country are Charles Lincoln, Detroit,
Mich. ; J. R. Hendrix and T. K. Slavton,
of Pittsburg; J. Palmer O'Neill, Pittsburg,
and C. B. Whitford, of the .American Field,
one of the best posted dog-fanciers in tbe
country. Mr. Hendrix and Mr. M. D.
Walters, of Indianapolis, have your re
porter's thanks for favors in making his
investigations. Mr. Lincoln left last night
for New Orleans, where he will superin
tend the bench show whicn commences
there on the 18th instant. He stated that
tiladstone and Oath would be sent to that
show. Mr. Short, who has been so
successfully handling the Memphis
dogs, is a prominent figure among
the dog-fanciers. Although named Short,
he is considerably over six feet high. His
successes certainly mark him as one of the
most competent trainers in the eountry.
He was in nearly all the heats yesterday,
and in the last one handled both Sue and
Gath. These two were taken up at night,
without deciding the final heat for the
All-Age Stakes, which will be finished. It
is now a sure thing that a Memphis dog
will have first money, and many think
that both first and second will be taken
here. After the All-Age Stakes have been
decided, the trial will commence for the
Derby. The entries are numerous, and a
splendid show of hunting is predicted by
the knowing ones.
An election for officers of the National
Kennel Club, held at Grand Junction on
Tuesday night, resulted as follows :
President J. Palmer O'Neill, Pittsburg.
First Vice-President J. H. Trezevent,
New Orleans.
Second Vice-President W. B. Gates,

secretary and Ireasurer U. Bryson,
Memphis.
Mr. J. 11. Hendricks has with him one
of the best bred animals in the country
Queen Laverack, by Tory, one of the most
famous English dogs. She goes to the
New Orleans bench show.
Yesterday being a dark day, the hunters
claimed it would lie a good day for hunt
ing, as the scent of game would be strong.
The birds, however, were scarce, some of
the trials were long, and all very close.
yesterday's trials.
The first was between Loudon, owned
by II. P. Harrison, of Canada, and Carrie
J., owned by W. B. Gates, of Memphis.
Carrie J. discovered a covey, but Loudon,
coining up, flushed them. The sedge
grass was again drawn, and Loudon
pointed. Carrie J. soon pointed short,
flushed, and the bird was killed. Both
dogs then secured a point. Loudon then
Hushed a single bird. .Loudon Boon
pointed, and Carrie then flushed. A cotton-field
was then drawn, and Loudon was
declared winner of the heat.
OATH AND KKI.LY U.
were then put down in a sedgc-lield, which
was drawn bluntrr trath soon got a point
in a jtiece of woods, and Nelly a Hush.
Gath got another point, and was declared
winner ot the lieat.
st'E and Pox
came next. This heat was watched with
great interest. Don was the only pointer
in tne contest ana is considered one oi
the best iu the United States. A bird was
soon flushed and went to the woods,
where it was pointed by Sue. Don next
pointed a single bird. After being taken
up and removed to another point, Sue
pointed and was declared winner of the
heat.
GATH AXD LOUDO.W
This was the third heat for these two
famous (logs, and every attendant mani
fested a lively interest in it. The winner
of it would be the one to contend the
final heat with Sue. The whole field was
gone over without result. A new field
was visited, where .Loudon pointed a
covey and flushed three birds. Loudon
then pointed a single bird, and Gath also
pointed. Soon after Gath pointed, and
Loudon, instead of backing, ran forward
and flushed. This gave the heat to Gath.
Sl'K AND OATH
were then put down to run the concluding
heat. Thev both worked rapidly, but with
ill-luck. Gath false-pointed, and Sue, after
a good deal of running, pointed a covey.
She next flushed a covey. Gath then
pointed a single bird and Sue flushed one.
It was so late, and growing dark so rap
idly, the judge had the dogs called up to
finish the heat for first money this morning.
