THURSDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1887.
The full text of the Blaine interview
appears in the Herald. Our contempor
ary mangled it by striking out important
parts. _
A more orderly city of twelve thou
sand inhabitants nowhere exists than Hel
ena. yet on what seems the slightest ap
pearance of disturbances that seldom come
the police force is increased a third in
number. A regular force of ten first class
men is all sufficient to patrol the city and
protect person and property, Reduce the
police, keep up a good electric light sys
tem, and everybody will be sale and con
tent. _
The bill that Senator Far well proposes
to introduce, making State and municipal
bonds the basis of banking under our na
tional system seems to be a good
measure, and with proper protection
deserves to be adopted. The proba
bility is that State debts will soon
disappear with the national debt, but
municipal debts for construction of water
works, sewerage system, etc., are increas
ing rapidly, and if they could be made
available for a basis of banking the result
would be that more favorable rates of
interest would be granted to the borrowing
municipalities._
Secretary Fairchild's report is much
superior to the President's message, but it
Iia< some very weak points. As one of the
argument for the repeal of the internal
revenue taxes, he says it will enable us to
abolish the offices and officers necessary to
collect them. That is not a very powerful
argument. Any kind of tax involves some
expense in collection, but our revenues are
collected as cheaply as those of any coun
try. Again the Secretary says the inter
nal revenue taxes are unpopular at the
South. So are any kind of taxes, and this
is one that the S'n*h can relieve itself of
to any extent it chooses by limiting its use
of whisky and tobacco.
We still have hopes that our government
will undertake to supply the country with
a telegraph service. To make it a success
beyond all peradventure, it should operate
the telegraph exclusively, just as in the
until service. For this reason it would be
essentially unjust to drive the present com
panies out of service and not take their
property off their hands at some fair val
uation. We would not pay fancy
prices for watered stock, but at a fair ap
praisal. and in payment therefor govern
ment bonds should be issued. As the
service increased and extended the cost of
the additional plant should be supplied in
the same way and the service should be
charged to pay the interest on the debt.
The same buildings used for postoffices
should be used for telegraphing, and dis
patches should be sent and delivered by
the mail carriers.
The National Republican Committee
has fixed the time and place of holding
the next Republican convention. Chicago
is the place and the 19th of June the time.
The contest for place of meeting was
strong and well sustained by Cincinnati,
St. Lonis, Minneapolis, Omaha and Fargo
Chicago deserved the honor by a record
that the whole country is proud of. We
have no reason to question the justice of
giving Dakota extra representation in the
covention, but Montana is as justly enti
tled to the addition as Washington. It
comes as near being Republican and is as
justly entitled to Statehood. Our chief
interest in the convention is to see the can
didate nominated who can lead the Repub
lican party to victory upon a policy of pro
tection to home manufactures and labor,
and spirited foreign policy that shall aim
at no less than the mastery of the seas and
the control of the world's commerce.
A PROMPT REPLY.
The wool growers and manufacturers
are on hand with a prompt reply to the
onslaught of the President. Their
answer is complete and Mr. Blaine's is
to the same effect. It is shown by the
experience of reduction made in 1883
that the result is a large increase of im
ports and revenue. The complaint is
that we have too much revenue now,
but the course recommended by
the President is a!»olutely certain to in
crease that revenue. Under the tariff of
1867, the revenue from imports of wool
was less than two millions, but under
the reduced tariff of 18S3 this revenue
has been over five millions. It is a purely
false assumption that the President's
plan is for reduction of revenue. It is
for the -ole benefit of foreign wool grow
ers and manufacturers, and a direct at
tack upon one of the most important in
dustries in this country.
The reduction of the duties on wool in
1883 has been followed by a reduction in
the number of sheep and the production
of wool. A further reduction would
destroy the interest entirely and ruin a
business in which $500,000,000 is invest
ed. The worst enemy this country has
could not have aimed a more fatal blow
at a vital interest. It is folly to say as
some do that this industry is strong and
prosperous and doc- not need protection.
The facts disprove it. The industry is
fast declining under the reduction made
in 1SS3. Another blow of a similar kind
would utterly ruin it.
And with this industry destroyed, is it
imagined that our people will get any
cheaper or better goods from the Eng
lish manufacturers? No! the only
material and possible result would be
that we should pay more and get poorer
goods. The man who puts his head into
a lion's mouth may possibly get it out
again, but he is none the less a fool fur
taking such desperate chances.
BLAISE'S REPLY.
The extended criticism of Mr. Blaine
on President Cleveland's message will
be read with greater interest by the
public generally than the message itself.
Though written on foreign soil, it is
American in every word and sentiment.
The President having rested three years
of his term on the top rail of the fence,
for fear of demoralizing his party on the
tariff'is:-ue, now that he is the accepted
standard bearer of his party for another
contest and compelled to join issue on
something besides civil service reform
which has been dragged in the mud and
torn to tatters, proceeds to get down on
the wrong ssde of the fence in the worst
possible place and in a very demoralized
condition.
There was a time when this issue of
protection against revenue tariff would
have been much more doubtful than it
is to-day. That was before the war and
the abolition of slavery, when the greater
part of our public domain was still un
occupied and when we had a large and
powerful commercial class and interests.
But that time has gone by. The South
is no longer exclusively interested in
raising raw material ; our com
merce has faded from the seas
and our public domain, or the
better portions of it are occupied.
Driven from the oceans our capitalists
have turned their attention to inland
commerce and to manufactures, with the
results that have astonished the world
and ourselves. There has never been a
period of our history when we prospered
so greatly as since the war, under Re
publican policy with protection to our
manufactures. We have paid off the
greater part of our war debt, more than
doubled our national wealth and have
an overflowing treasury. We have be
come the greatest manufacturing nation
in the world.
Nothing but stark madness should
induce us to change a policy that has
borne us such good fruits. In a few
years more of the same policy we shall
be out of debt, with more wealth than
ill the nations of Europe combined.
Bv cultivating and encouraging home
manufactures we have become the most
independent, self-supporting nation in
the world. If war should come now,
and we were cut off from all foreign na
tions by sea, we could get along very
comfortably and not lack for any of the
necessaries and lack iur but few of the
comforts and luxuries of life.
No one could state more clearly and
forcibly than Mr. Blaine has, the folly
of directing all our energies to the culti
vation of the soil, creating a glut in
home and foreign markets and wearing
out our soil and wasting our strength for
the benefit of foreign manufacturers and
ocean freighters. By turning our atten
tion to manufactures we have created a
home market for the products of our
soil, which is all our own and
worth more to us than all
the markets of the world besides.
It has enabled us to place and use
to advantage all the vast foreign immi
gration that over-crowded Europe has
sent us in increasing volume. But for
the construction of our railroads and the
operation of our factories and mines this
could not have been done. If all had
been compelled to work the soil, compe
tition in a single employment would
have reduced wages to almost nothing.
No ! we have made no mistake in choos
ing the policy we have and it would now
be the extreme of folly to change in any
other way than by reciprocal treaties
that would give us a full equivalent in
market favors.
Mr, Blaine only speaks of one feature
of our policy, because the message only
contained one idea. We know well
enough that this matter of protection is
but one position of Mr. Blaine's general
policy, which would include the con
struction of a navy and the estab
lishment of a commercial union oi
all the • nations on this continent.
That is a policy worthy of our strength,
and ambition as a nation. It would re
quire the expenditure of a large revenue,
all that we have now or are likely to
have through a tarif of the most ap
proved protective kind. We would not
even remit the tobacco tax, which Mr.
Blaine favors, and any surplus we have
or are likely to have we would apply to
the extinction of our war debt. As
long as this debt remains or any portion
of it, there is as much reason as ever
there was to retain war taxes, if any one
prefers the use of that term.
The recent decisions ot the Supreme
Court in the case of the Virginia bond
holders is a very important one. It sus
tains State sovereignty to an extent that
will to many seem dangerous. A State
debt is only a debt of honor. There is ab
solutely no way to enforce it. The Virginia
creditors may as well take what they can
get and make the best of it. It will be
found in the end that repudiation does not
pay, even though it may be successfully
practiced. In view of this decision it be
comes a duty still plainer that the general
government should assume and pay that
portion of the old State debt fairly belonging
to West Virginia.
With the disappearance of oar old court
house, we are all glad to see so much of
the old debt extinguished that has hung
over us ever since the old court house was
built with money borrowed at 3 per cent,
a month and subsequently bonded in 15
per cent, bonds. Bat we doubt the pro
propriety of attempting to redeem so large
a share of the debt in any one year. It
makes the taxes higher than they should
be, especially to city residents, who have
to pay the heavy city tax as well. Our
county warrants should be kept at par, and
there is no good policy in redeeming 6 per
cent, bonds, if we incur the liability of
having to pay 7 per cent, on registered
warrants.
THE AMERICAN NAVY.
The report of Secretary Whitney gives
an opportunity to speak of what we hope
sometime to be substantial fact instead
of a fiction. It is a melancholy fact that
the chief constructor of the navy reports
that in six years more there will be only
four of the present cruiser ships fit for
service. At that time we shall be a na
tion of seventy millions, the strongest,
richest nation on earth, undisputed dic
tator of the destinies of one en
tire continent and heir apparent
to the commerce of the world,
. The fact stated by Secretary Whitney
that since the close of our civil war we
haye spent $75,000,000 on our navy and
have little or nothing to show for it, in
stea d of being a discouraging and de
terring fact, ought to stimulate us to
exertions to remedy the defect. It is
something higher than politics for the
creation of a first-class navy is to de
termine our rank as a power in the
world and also our control of the com
merce of the world.
We have little use for a large stand
ing army, and with the best navy in the
world, we would have still less need ot
it. Again we are confronted with the
necessity for suitable coast defenses for
the largest seaboard that any country in
the world possesses. Build a navy and
it will be all the coast defense we need.
If we set about building a navy, it
will build up a plant that will soon en
able us to build ships of commerce as
cheaply as England does it now. When
the transcontinental railroads were pro
vided for and the rails were required to
be of American manufacture, it gave
an impetus to the business of making
rails so that we have ever since been able
to hold our own against the world. It
will be the same if we construct a navy
and require all the work and material to
be of American manufacture.
It will be an expensive undertaking.
Admit it. The cost may be five hun
dred millions. At least with that sum
we could build a navy that would be
superior to any at present in existence.
But what are the stakes ? They are no
less than the control of the world's
commerce, and the profits of that com
merce are worth ten times the cost at
the highest figures.
With a controling navy, all the weaker
nations of the world would become our
ready allies and patrons of our com
merce and manufactures. We should
not have to solicit their alliance and
trade. These would be urged upon us.
Foreign nations would stop picking up
and annexing the islands of the oceans,
and abandon what they could not hold
in ai.y event of war.
In event of a general war in Europe,
which is conceed to be only a matter of
time, even England would be necessarily
a party thereto, and the United States,
if prepared with naval equipment to
furnish protection could easily regain
at a single step the control of all the
ocean commerce. The question would
not thus be the cost of construction but
the power to command respect to the
Hag that would float over the vessel.
Secretary Whitney even seems to have
become a convert to the policy of subsi
dizing steamship lines that in the emer
gency of war could be commanded for
that service. It is a most sensible and
prolific conception. We could thus ex
tend our commerce, encourage ship
building in the United States and always
have a reserve force for war purposes.
The era of railroad building is so far
advanced that it would not be checked,
only supplemented by fleets of steel
ships. We are now so far advanced
towards the developement of our vast
interior domain and its settlement that
it is prudent to be looking abroad. Eng
land, without a tithe of the interest that
we have in the case, is subsidizing lines
of steamships between Australia and
Puget Sound.
We could and ought to have three or
four such lines on the Pacific and a doz
en of them on the Atlantic to the vari
ous countries of South and Central
America.
The construction of a navy and the
announcement that we would make and
maintain it superior to any other in the
world, would of itself be the adoption of
a national policy in every way suitable
to our strength and proper ambition.

CONVENTION CALL.
Chairman Jones, in his call for the
National Republican Convention, has in
a few masterly strokes outlined a policy
that should unite the Republicans of the
country and arouse them to score a vic
tory that would advance the country an
other quarter of a century to power and
prosperity. It will not only rally those
who have been Republicans, but it ap
peals to the intelligent self-interest of
all good business men in all parts of the
country, and it appeals with especial
force to the young men of the nation,
ambitious to see their Country command
an influence proportionate to her mighty
resources.
The call appeals to those who would
protect American manufactures and
labor in preference to foreign. This ap
peal is enforced by the unexampled pros
perity of the United States under the
operation of the protective system, by
the aid ot which we have piled up
wealth as no nation before has ever done,
enabling us to pay off a large share of
our debt, giving us an overflowing treas
ury, filling our land with railroads,
factories and paying mines. Contrast
this with the effects of the Democratic
revenue tariff of '46, which left us almost
in a condition of bankruptcy at the out
break of our civil war.
We are aware that there are some who
are good Republicans on other issues
and general principles, who have fallen
into the errors so persistently taught by
the Cobden free trade advocates, a poli
cy suited perhaps to the present condi
tion of England, but a policy that Eng
land did not adopt till after her manu
factures had grown to maturity and
had acquired strength to compete suc
cessfully with the world for supplying
foreign markets, a point which we
have not yet reached by a long way.
We may reasonably expect that when
this issue of protection is clearly under
stood and its practical operations traced
in our own history, there will be very
few if any who have ever been Repub
licans who will refuse its hearty support.
We have greater reason also to expect
that there are thousands of Democrats
in every part of the country who will re
fuse to support a policy that can be
shown to favor England at the expense
of the United States. Especially will this
argument address itself with great force
to those who have been forced by this
English policy to become exiles from
their own homes. i his low revenue
tariff that Carlisle and Cleveland advo
cate would render the United States as
poor and dependent as Ireland is to-day.
If the Irish in America once come to
comprehend the fact that the success of
the Democratic policy will send them
back to grind in the mills of their old
oppressors there will be a grand break
from the party they have trusted only to
be betrayed. Nor will the South be any
better willing to give up their new am
bition and pleasant taste of the wealth
and prosperity that come from the intro
duction of diversified industries and the
application of skilled labor and mechan
ical contrivances operated by steam
power.
If the Democracy is sincere in its ex
pressed desire to reduce the revenue,
they must abandon the purpose of re
ducing the tariff duties, for any reduc
tion except entire abolition will certain
ly raise the revenues. A reduction of
the duty on wool made in 1883 over the
rates fixed in 1867 resulted in an in
crease of revenue from that source of
150 per cent.
If President Cleveland had been sin
cere in his desire to deplete the treasury,
why did he not recommend the reduc
tion of the sugar tax, which pays fifty
millions into the treasury, rather than
the wool duty, which only yields one
tenth as much. Most all of our sugar
comes from abroad, aud a reduction of
the duty will count nearly a full equiva
lent to the consumer. And in connec
tion with this reduction on sugar, the
Republicans propose to encourage sugar
production at home by a liberal bounty.
The convention call is equally sound
and clear in favor of "a system of naval
and coast defenses that will enable the
country to conduct international negoti
ations with self respect. On this point
we have recently said something and
propose to say a good deal more.
Especially worthy of commendation is
that portion which emphasises the in
justice of the continued, unreasonable
exclusion of rapidly growing territories.
That means Dakota, Washington and
Montana. If there is a spark of justice
and manhood in the people of the L nited
States, they will emphatically repudi
ate the party that refuses to allow the
claims of new States from undisguised
narrow partisan motives.
All the youth, vigor, energy and man
hood of the nation will unite in the de
sire to adopt and proclaim a foreign
policy that is suited to our strength, re
sources, interests and ambitions. It is
the outline of a policy that forgets not
the services of those who have won our
victories in the past, while it
calls upon another generation to
organize greater and happier conquests
on the seas. We have no internal ene
mies, none that we can possibly fear on
this continent. We must go on ship
board for future conquests, and the
islands of the seas and the commerce of
all nations is the grand stake to play for.
This Republican call ought to quicken
the pulse of every man in this country.
Every fibre of it thrills with the throb
of a great coming awakening and vic
torv.

Frison Sensation.

at the county jail are said to be mnch wor
ried over the discovery of the possession of
contraband articles by the prisoners. Fol

inals in jail was discovered the other day
to have in his possession a revolver and
arnmnnition. The jail authorities sup
pressed all information, but it is asserted
there was a well conceived plot to arm sev
eral noted criminals in jail, when the plan
would be carried out for escape by shooting
down the gnards if necessary.
ELKHORN ECHOES.
Activities of the Camp Reviewed«»»
Elkhorn .Mine and Flam..j m .
portant Improvements-..
Resumption of Active
Operations.
Elkhorn, Mont., December 9.—[Special
correspondence of tDe Herald.] On the
12th of hist June the Elkhorn mine, hav
ing become flooded, and what ore there was
used up, it became necessary to shut down
the mill, and for the 178 succeeding days
silence reigQed about the works instead of
the clatter of the stamps which sent their
echoing roar down the Elkhorn canyon
afar. During this long enforced rest ol the
mill, and much of the time of the mine
also, many and important changes have
taken place, some of which had been in
contemplation before the flood, though the
majority of them have but recently been
taken into consideration.
The new 30x60 foot machine shop, well
equipped with all that goes to make up a
first-class establishment of the kind, the
need of which was hardly felt before, while
now the only wonder is how the mill and
mine were ever run without it, is an inno
vation. The shaft of the mine—
which is on an incline—has been retracked
with iron T rails from the
surface to the bottom, or to the 750-foot
station. The new track is laid on hea\y
timbers and the shaft straightened in
places, all of which will now admit of a-,
rapid hoisting as can be done in any shaft.
A new assorting room has been added to
the shaft extending lrom it to tue ore
house, where ten men are employed, who
by the use of the hydraulic method, as
well as hand sorting, bring the ore to
a much higher grade for milling than it
has been possible to do heretofore.
Nor are the improvements confined to
the hoisting works. In the mill two addi
tional amalgamating pans have been in
troduced, which, wflth an additional settler,
will greatly aid in amalgamating the silver
as well as reducing the amount which in
evitably goes out with the tailings. The
old 48-inch chloridizing cylinder has been
removed and a new Howell & White
chloridizer 60 inches in diameter put in to
take its place. To accommodate this an
addition has been built to the mill which
will increase the area of the cooling floor
by about oue-third. Much praise is due
Mr. J. W. Pender, the superintendent,
for prosecuting these improvements in face
of the fact that the company has been six
months without a farthing's income, and
with an expenditure equalling and some
of the time far exceeding that of running
the plant at full blast. During the past
two months, or since the draining of the
mine from water, mining has been steadily
going on in the upper slopes, till the ore
house is filled and a large amount extracted
and lying in the levels, ready to be hoisted
and milled—sufficient, in fact, to run the
mill for several months.
The ground between the 650 and 730
foot levels is yet virgin ground, no ore hav
ing as yet been taken from this region,
though a fine body has been opened in the
750 foot level. It is however, the purpose
of the company to commence sinking again
at once and go down to the 1,000 foot sta
tion. This will show up the ground, and
give the management a better opportunity
of assorting and milling the ore. increasing
the output of bullion and keeping its pro
duction at a uniform rate.
And now, as the needed improvements
have been made, and the mill again is ad
ding its busy hum to the otherwise toler
ably quiet camp, Elkhorn will take on a
new lease of life and feel all the younger
for having been asleep for the six months
last past. Dudley.
WORKING THE W 1RES.
Powderly in Favor ot a Government
System of Telegraphy.
Philadelphia, December8.—The third
of tbe aeries of letters addressed by Pow
derly to the Knights is published. It is
confined to an attack on the Western
Union Telegraph Company, with the recom
mendation that the United States Govern
ment control all the telegraph lines. The
plan of placing the stock of one telegraph
system, the Union, in the hands ot for
eign capitalists, Powderly thinks, is omi
nous of impending danger, and cites the
recent crisis in France as an example of
monarchical interference in Republican in
stitutions. He argues that the government
can do the telegraphing of the country as
successfully as it does the mail carrying, and
ridicules the idea that it would amount to
anything as a political factor, because, as
he says, there are only about 17.000 tele
grapers in the United States.
TERROR STRICKEN.
Earthquake Effects in Mexico.
Nogales, A. T., December 9.—A gentle
man writing from the scene of the recent
earthquakes at Bauispoe, Mexico, says:
The entire town has been destroyed and
many persons killed. Earthquakes have
been of daily occurrence, except during an
interval of two weeks, during which time
the people built temporary shantit- of re
fuge on a hill. Since the cessation some
adobe houses have been erected, but they
were soon destroyed. The people are wild
with terror and are starving. The provis
ions and supplies provided by the State
and private sources are exhausted, and the
entire vicinity is destitute of provisions
and clothing, and unless aid is furnished
soon they may starve. The streams opened
by thj first great shocks are still flowing,
bat the continued shocks and terror of the
people prevent the utilization of the
abundance of water for raising crops.
