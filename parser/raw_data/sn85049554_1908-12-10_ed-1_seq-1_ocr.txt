J. W. Van Cleave Points Out In

BRAZIL'S RIVERS

Washington, Deo, 10,—Prominent
Speakers, among them Joseph G. Can
non, Joaqulm Nabuco, the Brazilian
ambassador 2 Conner Senator Higgins,
of Delaware James W. Van Cleave,
president' of the National Association of
Manufacturers f. A. Ockerson, Gov-,
ernor Deneen, and Senator Owen, of
Oklahoma, addressed today's session of
the national rivers and harbors con
vention.
Van Cleave for Lakes-torGulf Scheme.
As preliminary to his remarks,
Mr. Vaii Cleave had no hesitation in
declaring a preference for the lakes-to
tlre-gulf project by way of the Mississ
ippi river to all other, local water, way
schemes, because, he said, it had a
larger region, not only In area, but in
population and' in natural resources,
than any other, single enterprise. Be
sides, he said, it would contribute more
to the country's prosperity and wealth
than would any other project which
was confined to one section. ,BEe was
aware, however, of the jealousy of .lo
cality 'and of thei desire of each section
to give priority to its own particular
scheme. For that reason, he said, the
national rivers and harbors congress,
which took the entire country into its
calculations, bad a mission which made
a powerful appeal £o all men who
"think continentally." Those who were
Interested in the extension of manu
facturing and the lengthening of the
United States' lead over the other in
dustrial countries In 4hlB 'field must
also think and plan continentally.
Mr. Van Cleave, In giving the r-eas
^obs whs manufacturers all ever the
country had a. profound concern in the
•v^ork the congress aimed to accom
plish, said that with the progress of
Invention and the adoption of labor
saving devices, production In fce *ac-'
torles. to a steadily increasing degree,
outran home consumption, He declared
that In order that the operation of mills
in periods of trade stagnation as well
as in periods of trade activity may be
continued, the (prices of American pro
ducts at the great centers of consump
tion, both at home and abroad, must
be lowered, and that the cheapening
of transportation would help to do
that. The readiest and most effective
way to do that and at the same time
quicen the transit between .producer
and consumer, he said, was to put the
navigable waterways of the country In
a shape In which they could do their
share of the work. He pointed- out why
the manufacturers Shad a large stake
in the work which the congress aims
to' promote. "The country's mills and
factories," he said, "represent a capital
of $15,000,000,000. They employ 6,000,
000 of persons, give them $3,500,000,000
In wages annually, and fashion $10,000,
GOO.OOO of materials yearly into products
worth $17,000,000,000. The exports of
manufactures in 1908 reached $750,
000,000. In the amount of money in
Tested in it and in the number of per
Bons which it employes, manufacturing
is the second greatest of the country's
interests, agriculture being first. In the
volume and the value of its manufact
ures the United States nearly equals its
three nearest competitors combined—
Great Britain, Germany and France."
Speaking from the national side of
the question Mr. Van Cleave said that
the organization of which he was pres
ident was In hearty sympathy -with the
aim of the national rivers and harbors
congress to obtain asi annual govern
mental appropriation of $50,000,000 for
river and harbor improvement thruout
the country. "My own experience as
well as that of every other manufac
turer In the country," he said, "shows
the harm which comes from the inabil
ity of the railways to handle the traf
., flc promptly. During the past ten or
twelve months we have had no com
plaint on this score, for the traffic has
fallen oft, but the rapidity with which
the number of idle cars is falling off
warns us manufacturers that the old
traffic congestion at our business cen
ters will soon return. Under the im
pulse which trade has received in the
past few weeks we must be prepared
to see the old embargo at our big rail
way stations by crop moving time of
1909 at the latest." He gave as an im
peratlve reason why the manufacturers
must use all -their influence to get a
greater Increase in transportation fa
cilities, the fact that in the last twen
ty years the volume of 'the country's
manufacturers had increased 100 per
cent while the mileage of th* railways
had gained but 45 per ceht. Many of
the railway chiefs, he said, acknowl
edged that the rolling stock and the
terminal facilities could not grow fast
enough to meet the demand. "Thus,"
he declared, "we are compelled to bring
the waterways into requisition to sup
plement the work of the roads." The
railroad companies, he said, would not
oppose the project. In fact, he said,
some of the railway officials would
probably 'help. He maintained that
there was mo necessary antagemism
between the fivers and the railways,
and he argued that waterway improve
ment not only would expand and di
versify the country's activities, but
Would furnish more iwork for the rail-

Rivers and Ports of Brazil.
The following speech was delivered
by Joaquim Nabuco, Brazilian ambas
sador, at the rivers anil harbors con
gress ^.his afternoon, on the subject,
"Rivers and Ports of Brazil." He said
in part:
"I am supposed to speak abmit the

which explains the loan made by the

Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 10.—The wreck

last night, may be considered one lucky
in the annals of railroading, according
to railroad men. The fact that almost
an entire train, going at ithe rate of
fifty miles an hour, containing more
•than 200 people, could turn over and
go down a ten foot embankment with
out killing anybody, is marvelous. The
train struck a broken rail. The hard
packed snow saved the train from de
struction. Eleven passengers were
seriously injured, while many were cut
by broken glass, and bruised by those
on the upper side falling on them.

Des Moines, Dec. 10.—The
board of agriculture has
hold of the weed problem in
with gauntleted gloves and
posfs to make a start toward cleaning
up the highways and by-ways of the
state. Today the committee appointed
two years ago to devise a plan and a
bill reported. While the reported mcas-

pro-
ure did not meet the entire ap'proval
of ail, it showed the way to make a
beginning. A law is proposed to cre
ate a state weed commission of five,
including the director of the state ex
periment station, the state botanist,
the secretary of the agricultural
board and two others. To this com
mission will be given extraordinary
powors with regard to defining noxious
weeds and giving notice of the neces
sity for their eradication, failure to

The plan is, in fact, In conformity
with a plan propounded fully six years
ago by Professor MacBride of Iowa
City, who at that time lectured in Des
Moines. He prepared a map showing
the state house and surrounding land.
He then urged that for the aesthetic
appearance Of the capitol land should
be secured on all sides of it. The plan
urged by the association is practic
ally the same as he suggested then.
He is yet heartily In favor of the
scheme. The property, the members of
the association urge, should be bought
before Its price becomes any greater.
The association also recommended
that .the legislature pass a law creat
ing a state forestry commission,
whose duties it would be to look to
ward the preservation of trees and en
couraging the growth of the proper
kinds. The association passed a res
olution commending national legisla
tion to preserve the forests of the
country. The forestry commission was
especially urged by Professor Mac
Bride, who is a member of the present
commission appointed by Governor
Cummifts to investigate. the needs of
Iowa without compensation. Mr. Mac
Bride delivered a lecture on the subject
last evening Illustrating his points
with sterioptian views of frees of
Iowa.
The state board of control will soon
file with the governor its annual re
port and among other interesting date
is that concerning the products of the
state farms. It is remarkable the
amount of fruit, vegetables and food
stuffs produced on these farms. To give
an idea of something of the size of this
output the fallowing are some of the
figures:
Four hundred and ten thousand flve

8,800 gallons of sauerkraut 70,991

drastic one, but the committee reported
that in this way. only can the state
hope to accomplish results. A com

A short course in agriculture will be
one of the features of the next state
fair if the plans made by the newly

Special to Times-Republican.
Clarinda, Dec. 10.—George and Henry
Dyke, twin brothers, aged 70 years,
were burned to death early this morn
ing at Hepburn, a small town eight
miles north of 'Clarinda.
George Dyke had been living in a
dugout on the railroad right-of-way,
but had just completed a small house
from lumber furnished him -by the cit
izens of the community, who had pro
vided him also with a lot and who had
objected to Dyke's mode of -living.
Henry, the twin brother of George, who
had been making his home with
Charles Frane in Hepburn, went to
make his brother a visit yesterday, and
to remain all nighit. In the shanty
home had been placed a small stoVe,
the pipe from which was extended thru
the roof, and it is believed that the fire
started from the stove or pipe.
About 5 o'clock this morning when
Frank Ramsey, a mall carrier, discov
ered the house to be on fire, he broke
in the door and window and attempted
to rescue the two men, but the flames
drove him back.
The Dyke brothers were the remnant
of a family which was prominent in
ies of the two men were burned to a
crisp.
