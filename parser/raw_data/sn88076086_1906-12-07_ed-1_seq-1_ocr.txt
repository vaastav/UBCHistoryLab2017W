MURPHY GUILTY
Verdict of Jury at Fargo was
Against the Major.
After being out for a period
of 48 hours in the district court
at Fargo, the jury in the case
of the state against Major John
S. .Murphy of Minot, one of the
best known men in North Da
kota, charged with uttering
forged road tax receipts, re
turned a verdict of guilty at
9:15 Monday evening.
The defendant and counsel
for the state and defense were
notified that the jury had ar
rived at a verdict at 9 o'clock.
They repaired to the court
room, the defendant accom
panied by his faithful wife,
who has been his companion
during the long trial. The maj
or "bore up well when the ver
dict was announced, but ap
peared greatly disappointed.
After the verdict had been
announced by Judge Pollock,
Judge W. S. Lauder, of counsel
for Mr. Murphy, moved for a
stay of sentence in order that
papers might be prepared ask
ing for a new trial. The court
granted a stay of sentence un
til -the first day of the January
term of court. Judge Lauder
also made a brief oral argu
ment for a new trial.
The trial of the action against
Major Murphy attracted atten
tion throughout the state, as
the defendant was at one time
one of the leaders of the repub
lican party in North Dakota.
At the first trial of the case,
which lasted four weeks, the
jury disagreed, the twelve men
being equally divided as to the
guilt and innocence of the de
fendant. The first trial cost
Ward County in the neighbor
hood of $10,000. The second
trial was started at Fargo Nov.
•8, and consume*! about the
same length of time rs ^did" the
first trial. It is estimated that
the second trial will cost the
taxpayers of Ward county about
$11,000.
The complaining witnesses
in the cases against Major Mur
phy were William Crowder of
Ross and Harry Harry Hardy
of Manitou township. The com
plainants were road overseers
and alleged that Major Murphy,
who in the year 1904 was road
tax agent for the Great North
ern railroad in Ward county,
had forged their names to re
ceipts and turned them into the
railroad company as having
1een paid, when, as the evi
dence showed, the money had
never been paid by Mr. Mur
phy to the complainants.
The case was vigorously pros
ecuted by Assistant United
States District Attorney W. D.
Townsend and States Attorney
•G. A. McGee of Ward county.
Major Murphy had excellent
•counsel and he was ably repre
sented by Judge Lauder, Wah
peton^ Attorney Callahan, Cas
selton and Attorney Richardson
of Fargo.

Not the Law, But its Enforcement
The thing that has had more
to do with the disruption of the
republican party in North Da
kota than any it|ier is the* per
nicious prohibition law that
has been on o^ statute books
for the past fifteen years. Dur
ing all these y?ars the law has
been a farce, and will continue
to be one as lipng as it remains
in force. Nine-tenths of the
younger and^ more progressive
element of the^-epublican party
is in favor of resubmission,
and the reptiblfcan party should
long ago have declared in favor
of resubmitting the prohibition
question to the people of this
state. Resubmission will un
doubtedly come up at the next
session of the legislture, and if
Gov. -elect Burke wants to make
himself the most popular man
in North Dakota he will labor
for the enactment of such a law
as the people demand.—Bis
marck Palladium.
The present law is one of the
best the legislature could have
enacted, and "if Gov.-elect
Burke wants to make himself
the most popular man in North
Dakota'' he will work for the
enforcement of that law. The
trouble with North Dakota's
laws is we have not had men
in' office who have had the
courage of their own convic
tions and come out in the open
and do their duty. It is very
true the prohibition law is be
ing violated as no other law
ever has. If it cannot be en
forced, then give us high li
cense. The cry is that high li
cense would help build up the
towns, give us good streets,
electric lights, etc., but if the
present law was enforced, that
money wouldt go to build up
homes where it should go—to
help improve the farms and in
directly coming back to the
town, thereby helping it more
than all the saloons possible.
However, saloons are prefer
able to "blind pigs" at any
time.—Bowbells Bulletin.
Sunday Trains.
An., effort is being made by
some of our citizens for a Sun
day train service on the Bottin

considerable increase of busi
ness on this brach in the past
year, and Sunday trains would
be a great convenience, one the
citizens generally would appre
ciate if it should be put on.
VOL. XXII. NUMBER 29. BOTTINEAU, BOTTINEAU COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, DECEMBER 7, 1906.
THE BOTTINEAU COURANT
Died at His Old Home In Glen
gary, Ontario.
Many citizens of Bottineau
from 1895 to 1898 will remem
ber Donald McRea, and his
daughters, Mary, Edith, Eliza
and Donella, and will regret to
learn of the death of Mr. Mc
Rae, which occurred at his old
home in Glengary, Ontario,
about a month ago.
While here Mr. McRae was
choir master of the Presbyter
church, and the whole family
were noted as singers and mu
sicians of rare abjlity.
A late issue of the Winnipeg
Free Press has to say of him:
In the person of Donald Mc
Rae, who died on Sunday at
the residence of his son-in-law,
A. G. McArthur, 103 Ross av
enue, there passed away the
man who inspired the charact
er of the precentor in Ralph
Connor's famous novel, "The
man from Glengary." In fact
he was more than the object
which inspired the author, as
Ralph Connor says that every
word in the description of
"John Aleck" and his wonder
ful voice was nothing more
than a truthful description of
Donald Aleck McRae over
whose remains Rev. C. W.
Gordon (Ralph Connor) read
the solemn funeral service on
Monday afternoon.
Donald McRae's voice has
been listened to in the fervor
of religious enthusiasm by
thousands, while many thous
ands more have heard that
voice in imagination as they
read, the vivid descripti9n of the
author, as hue told of the early
days and doings in his father's
church in Izidian' Lands^ Glen
gary, and they ffelt the thrill of
the stains of "Old IJunsLred''.
as they ,-read ,the pages that
made Ralph Connor famous.
And Ralph Connor has a large
audience to speak to with the
strokes of his pen.
The McRaes were a" large and
important family in the district
of Indian Lands, Glengary, the
district in which Ralph Connor
was a minister for twenty years.
It was there that he was born
and lived until he was eleven
years of age. There is a block
of Scotch people there and the
McRaes are a large family who
go a long way toward making
up this block. The particular
branch to which Donald be
longed was associated with the
Sinclairs, another large and im
portant family in the district,
and it was into this family that
Donald married.
Read the Masterful Message of President Roosevelt, Publish ed in th is Paper.
DONALD MCRAE
Both families were musical
ly inclined, and Donald became
the teacher of singing in all
that district. They were all
farmers and the long evenings
were spent in singing. Sing
ing parties were held in the
houses of the neighbors and a
larger singing school was held
in the church. On winter
nights the whole community
would turn out.
That was at the time of the
discussion as to whether in
strumental music should be
admitted into the service of the
Presbyterian church. The pas
tor was opposed to it, and
strenuously talked against it.
One day one of those who fa
vored the instruments in the
church came and heard the
congregation sing. "Well,
Mr. Gordon," he said, "I don't
wonder you oppose the organ,
but is it not unfair of you, with
such singing to take such a
decided stand against it? If
we all could get such music
the question of the organ in
the church would never be sug
gested.
McRae left Glengary and
since toured western Canada,
the United States, and he held
important positions in many
churches, including Knox at
Toronto, and Knox at Gait, and
Bottineau. Because of his
singing and his qualities as a
leader he joined an evangelist,
and really did very fine service.
His voice developed sweetness
as well as strength, and was a
powerful rotund baritone. He
gave his services freely to the
church and a great many Man
itobans who heard him still
speak of his voice.
Personally he was.v4' very

fine man, warm hearted, gen
erous of nature and possessed
of a high sense of honor. He
was in fact a fine type of High
land gentlemen.
Mr. McRae leaves four daugh
ters, three of whom are in Win
nipeg. These are Mrs. A. G.
McArthur, wife of the princi
pal of Gladstone school, who
used to accompany her father
at concerts and evangelistic
meetings Mrs. D. Munro of
Nelson, B. C., and the Misses
Eliza and Donnella, trained
nurses in Winnipeg.
School Notes.
A very interesting program
has been arranged for Friday
evening of this week. We
would like to have everyone
interested in the school attend.
Charlie Patching started in
the high school this week.
Harry M. Britton returned
this week from a visit with his
relatives in Mohall.
Bella Nordsletten started to
school this week in the high
school room.
A week ago- Prof. Kemp
started a singing school for the
boys, but that was as far as it
got. We are wondering if the
first night scared him out.
Oliver Gorder is a new pupil
in the Eighth grade.
There is considerable tardi
ness of late. This is a bad
habit to form as it will hang on
as you grow older.
The pupils were not in favor
of having school last Friday as
it was given out at first there
would be no school. There
fore the attendance was small.
Among the new pupils this
week in the lower grades are
"Nellie Bacod, Jioris Bacon,
J2hn Elvion, Kenneth Bowers,"
Maggie Beaton and.' jdseph
Caldwell.
On account of Thanksgiving
there were i*o school notes last
week.
GRAND PIANO
The First One to Come into Bot
tineau County.
What is believed to be the
first grand piano ever brought
into Bottineau county was sold
this week by Emil Johnsgaard
to Mrs. Dr. Johnson, who
bought a new Lester Grand
piano for her home in Bot
tineau.
This is one of the best in
struments manufactured, and
is used by the best musicians
everywhere. The instrument
is endorsed by Prof. Caldwell
as one of the best he ever saw.
Mr. Johnsgaard has sotd a
large number of Lester pianos
this season, and hopes to close
deals soon for two more of the
Grands before Christmas.
These pianos are made of the
best materials and in the best
manner known to the piano
makers art. They are not to
be compared with some that
are sold with dealers' names,
made to sell, but are sold di
rect from the factory and fully
guaranteed to be everything a
piano should be.
Comes to Bottineau.
F. L. Bohn, of Fargo, who
for the past twenty years has
been on the road with A. O. U.
W. order, has accepted k posi"
tion with the Northern Tele"
phone company, and moved
his family to Bottineau.
Mr. Bohn is one of the best
posted men in the northwest on
fraternal insurance, and has
made it a success. He leaves
so he will be able to be at come
more and on the road less.
We take pleasure in welcom
ing Mr. and Mrs. Bohn to Bot
tineau.
The Correct Analysis.
Senator Hansbrough has pro
nounced recent political events
as an indication of "industrial
retrogression." Some brjght
genius has diagrammed the
now famous phrase as follows:
Industrial means work, retro
gression means going back.
Thus the senator figures that
political signs portend "going
back to work."—Milton Globe.
mm
tvaainrigton, Dec. 3.—The following is
the full text of President Roosevelt's
message to the second session of. the
Fifty-ninth congress:
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives: As a nation we still continue to
enjoy a literally unprecedented prosper
ity and it is probable that only reckless
speculation and disregard of legitimate
business methods on the part of the
business world can materially mar this
prosperity.
No congress in our time has done more
good work of importance than the pres
ent congress. There were several mat
ters left unfinished at your last session,
however, which I most earnestly hope
you will complete before your adjourn
ment.
I again recommend a law prohibiting
all corporations from contributing to the
campaign expenses of any party. Such
a bill has -already past one house of con
gress. Let individuals contribute as they
desire but let us prohibit in effective
fashion all corporations from making
contributions for any political purpose,
directly or indirectly.
Another bill whicti has Just past one
house of the congress and which is ur
gently necessary should be enacted into
law is that conferring upon the govern
ment the right of appeal in criminal
cases on questions of law. This right
exists in many of the states It exists in
the District of Columbia by act of the
congress. It is of course not proposed
that in any case a verdict for the de
fendant on the merits should be set
aside. Recently in one district where
the government had indicted certain per
sons for conspiracy in connection with
rebates, the court sustained the defend
ant's demurrer while in another juris
diction an indictment for conspiracy to
obtain rebates has been sustained by
the court, convictions obtained under It,
and two defendants sentenced to impris
onment. The two cases referred to may
not be in real conflict with each other,
but it is unfortunate that there should
even be an apparent conflict. At pres
ent there is no way by which the gov
ernment can cause such a conflict, when
it occurs, to be bolved by an appeal to
a hifcher court and the wheels of justice
ar» blocked without ,any rear decision of
the question. 1 can not too strongly
urge the passage of the bill in question.
A failure to pass will result ip seriously
President Roosevelt.
hampering the government in Its effort
to obtain Justice, especially against
wealthy individuals or corporations who
do wrong and may also prevent the
government from obtaining justice for
wageworkers who are not themselves
able effectively to contest a case where
the judgment of an inferior court has
been against them. 1 have specifically
in view a recent decision by a district
Judge leaving railway employees with
out remedy for violation of a certain so
called labor statute. It seems an absurd
ity to permit a single district judge,
against what may be the judgment of
the immense majority of his colleagues
on the bench, to declare a law solemnly
enacted by the congress to be "uncon
stitutional," and then to deny to the
government the right to have the su
preme court definitely decide the ques
tion.
Criminal Prosecution*.
It Is well to recoliecc that the real
efficiency of the law often depends not
upon the passage of acts as to which
there is great public excitement, but
upon the passage of acts of this nature
as to which there Is not much public
excitement, because there is little pub
lic understanding of their importance,
while the Interested parties are keenly
alive to the desirability of defeating
them. The importance of enacting into
law the particular bill in question is
further increased by the fact that the
government has now definitely begun a
fiolicy of resorting to the criminal law
n those trust and interstate commerce
cases where such a course offers a rea
sonable chance of success. At first, as
was proper, every effort was made to en
force these laws by civil proceedings
but it has become increasingly evident
that the action of the government in
finally deciding, in certain cases, to un
dertake criminal proceedings was justi
fiable and tho there have been some
conspicuous failures in these cases, we
have had many successes, which have
undoubtedly had a deterrent effect upon
evil-doers, whether the penalty inflicted
was in the shape of fine or imprison
ment—and penalties of both kinds have
already been inflicted by the courts. Of
course, where the judge can see his
way to inflict the penalty of Imprison
ment the deterrent effect of the punish
ment on other offenders is increased
but sufficiently heavy fines accomplish
much. Judge Holt, of the New York
district court, lti a recent decision admir
ably stated the need for treating with
Just severity offenders of this kind. His
opinion runs in part as follows:
"The government's evidence to estab
lish the defendant's guilt was clear,
conclusive and undisputed. The case was
a flagrant one. The transactions which
took place under this illegal contract
were very large the amounts of rebates
returned were considerable and the
amount of the rebate itself was large,
amounting to more than one-fifth of the
entire tariff charge for the transporta
tion of merchandise from this city to
Detroit. It is not too much to say, in
my opinion, that if this business was

that basis—that is. If this discrimination
in favor of this particular shipper was
made with an 18 instead of a 23 cent
rate and the tariff rate was maintained
as against their competitors—the re
sult might be and not improbably would
be that their competitors would be driven
out of business. This crime is one which
in its nature is deliberate and premedi
tated. I think over a fortnight elapsed
between the date of Palmer's letter re
questing the reduced rate and the answer
of the railroad company deciding to
grant it, and then for months after
wards this business was carried on and
these claims for rebates submitted month
after month and checks in payment of
them drawn month after month. Such
a violation of the law, in my opinion, in
its essential nature, is a very much
more heinous act than the ordinary
common, vulgar crimes which come be
fore criminal courts constantly for pun
ishment and which arise from sudden
passion or temptation. This crime in
this case was committed by men of
education and of large business experi
ence, whose business standing in the
community was -such that they might
have been expected to set an example
of obedience to law, upon the main
tenance of which alone in this country
the security of their property depends.
It was committed on behalf of a great
railroad corporation, which, like other
railroad corporations, has received gra
tuitously from the state large and valu
able privileges for the public's conven
ience and its own, which performs quasi
public functions and which Is charged
with the highest obligation in the trans
action of its business to treat the citizens
of this country alike, and not to carry on
its business with unjust discriminations
between different citizens or different
classes of citizens. This crime in its
nature Is one usually done with secrecy,
and proof of which it is very difficult
to obtain. The interstate commerce act
was passed in 1887, nearly 20 years ago.
Ever since that time complaints of the
granting of rebates by railroads has been
common, urgent, insistent, and altho
the congress has repeatedly past legis
lation endeavoring to put a stop to this
evil, the difficulties of obtaining proof
upon which to bring prosecution in these
cases is so great that this is the first
case that has ever been brought in this
court, and, as I am informed, this case
and one recently brought in Philadelphia
iare the only cases that have ever been
brought in the eastern part of this coun
try. In fact, but few cases of this kind
have ever been brought In this country,
eiast or west. Now, under these circum
stances, I am forced to the conclusion,
in a case in which the proof is so clear
and the facts are so flagrant, it is the
duty of the court to fix a penalty which
shall in some degree be commensurate
with the gravity of the offense. As be
tween the two defendants, in my opinion,
the principal penalty should be imposed
on the corporation. The traffic manager
In this case, presumably, acted without
any advantage to himself and without
any interest in the transaction, either
by the direct authority or In accordance
with what ho understood to be the policy
or the wishes of his employer.
"The sentence of this court In this ease
is. that the defendant Pomeroy, for each
of the six offenses upon which he has
been convicted, be lined the sum of $1,000.
making six tines, amounting in all to the
sum of Jti.OOO and the defendant. The
New York Central & Hudson River Rail

of which it has been convicted, be fined
the sum of $1S,000, making six fines
amounting in the aggregate to the sum
of $108,000, and judgment to that effect
will be entered In this case."
Evasion br Technicalities.
In connection with this matter, I would
like to call attention to the very unsat
isfactory state of our criminal law, re
sulting in large part from the hab't of
setting aside the judgments of inferior
courts on technicalities absolutely un
connected with the merits of the case,
and where there is no attempt to show
that there has been any failure of sub
stantial justice. It would be well to en
act a law providing something to th*
effect that:
No judgment shall be set aside or new
trial granted In any cause, civil or crim
inal, on the ground of misdirection of the
jury or the Improper admission or re
jection of evidence, or for erroi as to any
matter of pleading or procedure unless,
in the opinion of the court to which the
application is made, after an examina
tion of the entire cause, it shall affirma
tively appear that the error complained
oi has resulted in a miscarriage of
justice.
Injunctions.
In my last message I suggested the en
actment of a law In connection with th»
issuance of injunctions, attention hav
ing been sharply drawn to the matter
by the demand that the right of apply
ing injunctions In labor cases should be
wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful
whether a law abolishing altogether the
use of injunctions in such cases would
stand the test of the courts In which
case of course the legislation would be
Ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would
be wrong altogether to prohibit the use
of Injunctions. It is criminal to permit
sympathy with criminals to weaken our
hands in upholding the law and if men
seek ta destroy life or property by mob
violence there should be no impairment
of the power of the courts to deal with
them in the most summary and effective
way possible. But so far as possible the
abuse of the power should be provided
against by some such law as. I advocated
last year.
In this matter of Injunctions there is
lodged in the hands of the judiciary a
necessary power which is nevertheless
subject to the possibility of grave abuse.
It is a power that should be exercised
with extreme care and should be sub
ject to the Jealous scrutiny of all men,
and condemnation should be meted out
as much to the Judge who fails to use
it boldly when necessary as to the judge
who uses it wantonly or oppressively.
Of course, a Judge strong enough to be
fit for his office will enjoin any resort
to violence or Intimidation, especially by
conspiracy, no matter what his opinion
may be of the rights of the original quar
rel. There must be no hesitation In
dealing with disorder. But there must
likewise be no such abuse of the In
junctive power as Is implied in forbidding
laboring men to strive for their own bet
terment In peaceful and lawful ways
nor must the Injunction be used merely,
to aid some big corporation in carrying
out schemes for its own aggrandizement.
It must be remembered that a prelim
inary injunction in a labor case, if
granted without adequate proof (even
when authority can be found to support
the conclusions of law on which It is:
founded), may often settle the dispute
between the parties and therefore If
improperly granted may do irreparable
wrong. Y«t liiti't are many Judges whor.
