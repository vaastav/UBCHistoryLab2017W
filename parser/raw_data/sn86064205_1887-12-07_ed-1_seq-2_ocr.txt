the people should select some one road

TEE MESSAGE
The Presidents message delivered yes
terday deals with the question of the
tariff and the revenue exclusively Noth
ing more clearly indicates the urgent
need of a reform that will prevent the
hoarding of money in the national treas
ury by methods that indicate the duality
of the tariff evil the many are forced to
contribute to the profit of the few and the
national treasury drains the country of
its circulating medium
Mr Cleveland wastes no time or words
in laying before Congress the needs of the
public but tells the representatives of the
people in the few word3 that he utters
that the condition of the national Treas
ury imperatively demands immediate and
careful consideration Mr Cleveland
insists upon the Democratic idea that
revenues in excess of an economical
maintenance of the government is inde
fensible extortion and a betrayal of the
popular rights This making of the na
tional treasury a hoardingbox for
moneys collected through a robber tariff
cripples our energies suspends develop
ment nrevents investments threatens
financial disturbance and invites schemes
of public plunder
The remedy proposed by the President
is plainly expressed and must prove the
shibboleth of his party That remedy is
to diminish the tax on necessaries rather
than on luxuries Mr Cleveland is no
violent free trader but he says
the present tariff laws the vicious in
iquitous and illogical source of unneces
sary taxation ought to beat once revised
and amended
The people demand the relief the Pres
ident has recommended it as of para
mount importance now let Congress an
swer to the people m its response to the
Presidents timely recommendations

Special Correspondence of the Gazette
Washington Dec 3 President
Cleveland wrote the greater ptrt of his
message himself using a steel pen and
scratching off his thoughts in a fine Ital
ian hand He is a rapid writer and cor
rects his rranuscnpt very little The
printers have been instructed to use the
greatest precautions and I am told that
when the copy goes to the government
printing office it is cut up into little
pieces no one of which contains more
than a sentence These are handed to
different typesetters and no one but the
foreman of the office has the making up
of the matter
The message has been in course of
preparation all summer and Mr Cleve
land hod begun to formulate it before he
went on his western trip He has tailed
with the leading statesmen of the party
in regard to certain parts of it and some
of it was gotten up with Speaker Carlisle
while sitting on the porch of his country
home
President Cleveland is o very prolific
message writer His vetoes were all
written by himself and he penned his last
Thanksgiving proclamation He does a
great amount of clerical work and he
writes letters which other Presidents
give to their private secretaries
President Lincoln dictated the most of
his messages and what he did write he
wrote in a small hand easily read He
did not spcil his manuscript by revising
it and such of his writings as are in ex
istence Iook as thongh they had been
written by a lady
Johnson dictated all hi3 messages and
he could talk much better than he could
write His forte was on the stump and
in conversation and not at the desk He
thought very fast but wrote very slowly
A great part of hi3 messages were gotten
up in conversation with Jere Black and a
Tennessee friend Judge Milligan and
speaking of these a large part of every
Presidents messaae is inspired by other
than himself A part of the S cretary cf
the Treasurys last report which accom
panied Clevelands message last year was
supposed to have been writtpn by Msnton
Marble and not by Daniel Manning
When Cleveland was nominated it was
said that Manton Marble Mid Dan Lock
wood wrote his letter of acceptance but
his messages since then show that he
amply able to do his own writing and
that he can think rs well as he can write
The Presidents message 5s read in Con
gress at the first of the session The
Senate and the House of Representatives
have each a copy in manuscript
and this is read out by the clerk in a
droning voice Print < copies of the same
document lie on the defcks of the mem
bers and they follow the clerks reading
The message i3 brought to the Capitol by
Mr Pruden tre executive clerk and he
is received at the doors of the Senate and
House and anrounces that he has a mes
sage from the President in writing This
is the solemn form in the Senate where
the old greyhairea messenger Captain
Issac Bassett tak = s the message from
Pruden and carries it to the VicePresi
dents chair The VicePresident hands
it to the clerk and the clerk reads
At the beginning of tne government all
messages were delivered by the presi
dents in person and George Washington
rode in great state to the capi ol in a
fourhorse coach with servants in red
livrry In a day or two Congress
called UDon him and replied to
nis address and it was per
haps the bitterest time in Washingtons
life when Congress refu ed to do this
He was very unpopular at the time on
accountof the Jay treaty and he was
persecuted so by the newspapers and by
his entmies in Conaress that he swore
5y g that he would rather be in his
grave than in the presidency He would
rather be on bis farm than the Emperor
of the world and yet they were cnarging
him with waning to be a king
When he retired Congress refused to
pass resolutions complimentary to him
and Giles of Virginia said that he felt
no regard or the President and hoped he
would retire John Randolph of R > aa
ofce at the same time gave this toast at a
dinner
George Washington may he be damn
ed and upon outbursts of indignation
following he added the words if he
doesnt sign the Jay treaty
George Washington delivered thirteen
mfsages dnring the eisbt years he
served and Jefferson delivered twenty
three Maieon twentvflve Jackson
peventeen and Monroe thirteen Both
Jickson and Washington delivered fare
well addresses and Washingtons fare
well address is said to have been written
by Alexander Hamilton and James
Madison
Jacksons best messages are said to
have been pl3giaTlzvd Major Lewis and
Henry Lee wrote his first Inaugural and
Edward Livingstone wrote the famous
nullfication proclamation
Daniel Webster revised Harrisons in
augural and he tried to dictate to Tyler
what to write
Harrisons was the longest inaugural
address ever delivered and it contained
over 8000 words Polk wrote the nex
longest containing fully 20C0 word3 less
and the shortest ever delivered was that
of George Washington at his second term
and it contained only 134 words The
character of a President can be sometimes
told by his use of the personal
pronoun The conceit of Van Buren
makes him use the word I thirtyeight
imes in his inaugural and Franklin
Pitrce used it twenty five times Wash
ingtons first inaugural contains twenty
egus and his second only six President
Cleveland was tne most modest of the
Presidents He used I only five times
in his inaugural whereas Garfield used it
fen Hayes sixteen Grant twentyfour
Buchanan thirteen John Quincy Adams
f jurteen and Monroe nineteen
The greatest of our Presidents have
been the modestest and Lincoln at his
second term delivered an Inaugural in
which only once was a personal pronoun
ued
The Presidents messsges have often
been stolen in the past and one of
Grants messages was read by the coun
try a day before Cot giess met A syndi
cate of newspaper men paid a govern
ment printer 1000 for a copy of one of
Hayes messages and the correspondents
in tne syndicate were to py him 500
each for it One of the correspondents
however was beaten by the message be

other towns to which it was fur

It will be read in Congress this morning
You can all sit down now and copy it if
you want it
The message was already in the hands
of the Associated Press and of course the
correspondents did not want it They
considered it a cood joke and laughed
heartily over it and they liked Grant all
the better f jr havingptayed it upon them
Grant guarded all his subsequent mts
siges carefully and President Arthur had
nis set ud with closed doors He eve
them to the printers the Sunday of the
week before Congress met and one of the
printers who put them in type tel s me
that they were sent back to the White
House on Friday and Saturday
and corrected and recorrected a
half dozen times in proof before
the final copy w s taken On the
Sunday night preceding the opening of
Congress the forms were locked up the
doors were lecked and the greatest of
care was tfken to keep the men who had
been working upon them employed so
that newspaper correspondents could not
get access to them Most of Arthurs mes
sages were sent to the printers in his own
handwriting and he wrote as a rule r
short message
The Presidents mpssage is considered
very valuable not only to newspapers
but to brokers as well It outlines the
policy of the administrations and it may >
cause a rise or fall of stocks During
Johnsons time a NewYork brnker offered
25000 for an advai cs copy of the Presi
dents messaae His effir wos rejected
and one of Hsyes messagesjwas sold for
500
Grants messsges were nearly all auto
graph ones He dictated well but wrote
clearly ana fluently He seldom revised
his manutcriDt and his messages read as
wll as his memoirs Surrogate Rollins
aded President Arthur in the preparation
f his messsges and it is said that many
of the ideas which crept into them came
from him
Chevalier WikofE was perhaps the first
correspondent who ever stole a Presi
dents mecsage and he telecraphed one
to the New York Herald in 1862 A great
fuss was made about the matter and a
Congressional investigation followed
Wik ff was cal ed to a meeting of the
H use and asked of whom he had gotten
the document He replied that it
was given to him under an ob
ligation of secrecy and he was
oblised to decline to answer Wikft
moved in the best crcles of Wasbinnfon
society and was a cldm friend of Mrs
Lincolns and it was supposed at the
time that she gave him tae meesase and
the charge annoyed President Lincoln
very much After a time howeverWikoff
told the committee that the message was
given him bv a man named Watt whose
wife was Mrs Lincolns maid and this
explanation was final y accepted
Just now the correspondents are on the
qui jive as to what President Cleveland
will my in his message and how he will
say it Whether they will be able to buy
the printers or by the aid of some such
mindreader ns Bishop learn his thoughts
remains to be seen
