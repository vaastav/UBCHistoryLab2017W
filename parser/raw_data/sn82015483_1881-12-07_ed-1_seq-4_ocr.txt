The report of the Secretary of the Navy

for its improvement I call your especial at

of the advisory board, which he convened to
develop suitable measures for increasing the
efficiency or tne navy ana particularly iuo

fact that compliance with the suggestions of
the head of that department and of the ad
visory board must involve a large expencu-
tnrn of xrablio moneys. 1 earnestly recom
mend such appropriations as will aceompnau
an and which seems to me so desirable.
Nothing can be more inconsistent with true
public economy than withholding means nec
essary to accompusn tne oojectB outrun, uj
tha onnstitution to tne national leKimntuxo.
One of those objects, and one which is of
parttUlUUllb uiiWiwuiM'I " j

essential to the defense of the United States
and of all our people than the efficiency of
our navy.
We have for many years maintained with
Torsion governments the relations of honor
able peace, and that such relations may be
permanent is aesirea d.v every pwariunu om
zen of the republic, but if we read the
teachings of history we shall not forget that
in the life of every nation emergencies may
arise when a resort to arms can alone save it
from dishonor. No danger from abroad now
threatens this people, nor have we cause to
distrust the friendly professions of other
governments, but for avoiding as well as re
pelling danger that may threaten us in the
future we must be prepared to enforce any
means which we think wise to adopt. We
must be ready to defend our harbors against
aggression ; to protect, by distribution of our
Rhinn of war over the highways of com
merce, the varied interests or our ioreign
trade, and the persons and property of our
citizens abroad ; to maintain everywhere the
honor of our flag and the distinguished
position which we may rightfully claim
among the nations of the world.
THK POSTAL 8EJ1VICE.
The report of the Postmaster General is a
Gratifying exhibit of the growtn ana emci-
ency of the postal service. The receipts
from postage and other ordinary sources dur
ing the past fiscal year were $36,489,816.58 ;
the receipts from the money order business
were $295,581.39, making a total of $336,-
85.397.97. The expenditure for the fiscal
year was ijioszoi, .. xno ueueit sup
plied out of the general treasury was 2,401,
129.35. or 03 per cent, of the amount. The
receipts $3,469,918.63 in excess of the pre
vious year, and $4,878,397.97 in excess of
the estimate made two years ago before the
present period of business prosperity had
fairlv beeun.
The whole number or letters mailed m this
country in the last fiscal year exceeded one
thousand millions. ine registry system is
reported to be in excellent condition, having
been remodelled during the past four years
with good results. The amount of registra
tion fees collected during the last fiscal
year was $712,882.20 an increase over the
fiscal year ending June so, is8, of $345,
445.40. The entire number of letters and
packages registered during the year was 8,
338,419, of which only 2,061 were loBt or de
stroyed in transit. The operations of the
money order system are multiplying yearly.
Under the impulse of the rapid development
of the newer Statesjand Territories, and the
consequent demand for additional means of
intercommunication and exohange during
the past year, three hundred and thirty-eight
additional money - order offices have
been established, making a total of 5,499
in operation at the date - of this re
port. During the year the domestic money
orders aggregated in value S10i,075, 769.35.
A modification of the system is suggested,
reducing the fees for money orders not ex
ceeding five dollars" from ten cents to five
cents, and making the maximum limit $100 in
place of $50. Legislation for the disposition
of unclaimed money orders in tne possession
of the Postoffice department is recommend
ed, in view of the fact that their total value
now exceeds one million dollars. The atten
tion of Congress is again invited to the sub-
iect of establishing a system of savings de
positaries in connection with the Postoffice
department. The statistics of mail transpor
tation show that during the past year rail
road routes have been increased in length 6,
249 miles, and in cost $1,114,382, while
steamboat routes have decreased in length
2,182 miles, and in cost $134,054. The so
called Star routes have been decreased in
length 3,949 miles, and in cost $304,144.
Nearly all the more expensive routes have
been suspended by the railroad service. The
cost of the Star service must therefore rap
idly decrease in the western States and Terri
tories.
The Postmaster General, however. calls at
tention to the continually increasing cost of
the railway mail service as a serious difficulty
in the way Of making tne department self
sustaining. Our postal intercourse with for
eign countries has kept pace with the growth
of the domestic service. Within the past
year several countries and color-as have de
ciared their adnesion to the Jrostal union.
It now includes all those which have an or
ganized postal service, except Bolivia, Cos
tanco. New Zealand and the British colonies
in Australia.
THE STAB EOUTES.
As has been stated, great reductions have
been made in the expense of the Star route
service. The investigations of the Depart
ment oi justice ana tne I'ostolhce depart
ment have resulted in the presentation of in
dictments against persons formerly connect
ed with that service accusing them of of
fenses against the United States. I have en
joined the officials who are charged with the
conduct ot tne cases on tne part of the gov
ernment, and upon the eminent counsel who.
before my accession to the Presidency, were
called to their assistance' the duty of prose
cuting with the utmost rigor of the law all
persons who may be found chargeable with
frauds upon tne postal service.
- THB DEPARTMENT OP JUSTICE.
The acting Attorney General calls atten
tion to the necessity of modifying the pres
ent system of courts of the United States, a
necessity due to the large increase of busi
ness, especially in the Supreme Court. Lit
igation in our federal tribunal became great
ly expanded after the close of the late war.
So long as expansion might be attributed to
the abnormal condition in. which the commu
nity found itself immediately after the re
turn of peace, prudence required that no
change be made in the constitution of our
judioial tribunals. But it has now become
apparent that an immense increase of litiga
tion has directly resulted from the wonderful
growth, increase and development of the
country. There is no ground for belief that
the business of the United States courts will
be less in volume than at present Indeed.
that it is likely to be much greater is gener
ally recognized by the bench and bar. In
view of the fact that Congress has already
given much consideration to this subfect. I
make no suggestion as to detail, but express
nope mat your deliberations may result in
such legislation as will give early relief to
our over-burdened courts. The acting At
torney General also calls attention to the dis
turbance of the public tranquillity during the
past year in the Territory of Arizona, where
a Dana or armea aesperaaoes Known as "cow
boys," probably numbering from 60 to 100.
have been engaged for months in committing
acts of lawlessness and brutality which- the
local authorities have been tumble to
repress. The depredations of these
"cowboys" have : also extended into
Mexico, to which marauders escape from the
Arizona frontier. With every disposition to
meet the, exigencies of the case I am embar
rassed by lack of authority to deal with them
effectually. The punishment of crimes com
mitted within Arizona should ordinarily, of
course, be left to the territorial authorities,
but it is worthy of consideration whether
acts which necessarily tend to. embroil the
United States with neighboring governments
should not be declared crimes against the.
United States. . Some of the- incursions al
luded to may perhaps be within the scope of
the law (section 5,zsb, .Revised (Statutes) for
bidding military expeditions or enterprises
against friendly states, but in view of the
speedy assembling of your body I have pre
ferred to await such legislation as in your
wisdom the occasion may seem to requires It
may, pernapa, do tnougnt proper to pro
vide that the setting on foot within our
own ; territory - of , . brigandage and
armed marauding expeditions against
friendly nations and their citizens shall be
punishable as .an offense against the United
States. I will add that in the event of a re-
quest from the territorial government for pro !
taction by the United States against domestio
violence this government would be powerless ,
to render assistance. The Act of 1 795, chap- :
ter 36, passed at a time when Territorial gov- ,
ernments received little attention from Con- ;
gress, enforced this dutj of the United States
only as to state government, dot tne act oi
1807, chapter 89, applied also to territories.
This law seemed to have remained in force
until the revision of the statute when the
provisions' for the territories was dropped. I
am not advised whether this alteration was
intentional or accidental, but, as it seems to
me that the territories should be offered the
protection which is accorded to States by the
Constitation,I suggest legislation to that end.
It seems to me, too, that whatever-, views
may prevail as to the policy of recent legisla
tion, by which the army has ceased to be a
part of tbe posse oomitatus. an exception
might well be made for permitting the mili
tary to assist the civil authorities in enforcing
the laws of the United States. This use of
the army would not seem to be within the al
leged evil against which that legislation was
aimed. From the sparseness of the popula
tion and other circumstances it is often quite
impracticable to summon a civil posse in
places where tne othcers of justioe require as
sistance and where a military force is within
easy reach.
THE XOTEXtrOB DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Secretary of the Interior, .
with accompanying documents, . presents an
elaborate account of the business of that de
partment. - A summary of it would be too
extended for this place. I ask your careful
attention to the report itself. Prominent
among the matters which challenge the atten
tion of Congress at its present session is the
management of our Indian affairs. "While
this question has been a cause of trouble and
embarrassment from the formation ' of the
government, it is but recently that any effort
has been made for its solution at once serious
ly determined, consistent and promising suc-
lt has been easier to resort to con
venient make-shifts for the tiding of tem
porary difficulties than to grapple with the
great permanent problem, and accordingly
the easier course has almost invariably been
pursued. It was natural at a time when the
national territory seemed almost illimitable,
and containedmany millions of acres far out
side the bounds of civilized settlements, that
a policy should have been initiated " which,
more than aught else has been the source or
our Indian complications. I refer "of course
to the policy of dealing with the various In
dian tribes as separate nationalities, of rele
gating them by treaty stipulations to the oc
cupancy of immense reservations in the
West, and of encouraging them to live a
savage life undisturbed by any earn
est and well directed efforts to bring
them under the influences of civilization.
The unsatisfactory results which have sprung
from this policy are becoming apparent to
alL As the white settlements have crowded
the borders of the reservations, the Indians,
sometimes contentedly and sometimes against
their wills, have been transferred to other
hunting grounds from . which they have
again been dislodged, whenever their new
found homes nave Deen descried by the ad
venturous settlers. These removals, and tbe
frontier collisions by which they have often
been preceded, have led to frequent and dis
astrous conflicts between the races. It is .
profitless to discuss here which of them has
been chiefly responsible for- the disturbances
whose recital occupies so large a space upon
the pages of our history. We have -to deal
with the appalling fact that though thousands
of lives have been sacrificed and hundreds' of
millions of dollars expended in the attempt
to solve the Indian problem, it has, until
within the past ten years, seemed scarcely
nearer a solution "than it was half a century
ago ; but the government has been, cau
tiously but steadily, feeling its way to the
adoption of a policy which has already pro
duced gratifying results, and which in my
judgment is likely, if Congress and the Ex
ecutive accord in its support, to relieve us
ere long from the difficulties which have
hitherto beset us.
For the success of the efforts now making
to introduce among the Indians the customs
and pursuits of civilized life, and gradually
to absorb them into the mass of our citizens,
sharing their rights and holden to their re
sponsibilities, there is imperative need for
legislative action. My suggestions in that re
gard will be chiefly such as have been already
called to the attention of Congress and have
received, to some extent, its consideration.
First, I recommend the passage of an act
making the laws of the various States and
Territories applicable to the Indian reserva'
tions within their borders, and extending the
law's of the State of Arkansas to the portion
of Indian Territory not occupied by the five
civilized tribes. The Indian should receive
the protection of the law ; he should be al
lowed to maintain in court his rights of per
son and property ; he has repeatedly begged
for this privilege ; its exercise would be very
valuable to him in his progress toward civili
zation. Second, and of even greater impor
tance, is a measure which has been frequently
recommended by my predecessors in office,
in furtherance of which several bills have
been, from time to time, introduced in both
houses of Congress the enactment of a
general law permitting tbe allotment in seve
ralty, to such Indians at least as desire it, of
a reasonable quantity of land, secured to
them by patent, and for their own protection
made inalienable for twenty or twenty-five
years. This is demanded for their present
welfare and their permanent advancement.
In return for such considerate action on the
part of the government, there is reason to
believe that the Indians in large numbers
would be persuaded to engage at once in in
dustrial pursuits, knowing that their tribal
days are over and that it is now for their best
interests to conform their manner of life to
the new order of things. By no greater in
ducement than the assurance of a permanent
title to the soil can they be led to engage in
the occupation of tilling it. The well-attested
reports of their increasing interest in hus
bandry justify the hope and belief that the
enactment of such a statute as I recommend
would be at once attended with gratifying re
sults. A resort to" the allotment system
would have a direct and powerful influence
in dissolving the tribal band which is so
prominent a feature of savage life, and tends
so strongly to perpetuate it.
Third, I advise a liberal appropriation for
the support of Indian schools, because of
my confidence and belief that that course is
consistent with useful economy. Among
the most uncultivated Indian tribes there is
reported to be a general and urgent desire
on the part of the chiefs and older members
for the education of their children. It is an
unfortunate instance of this fact that during
the past year the means which have been at
the command of the Interior department for
the purpose of Indian instruction have proved
to be utterly inadequate. The success of the
schoolswhich are in operation at Hampton,
Carlisleand Forest Grove should not only
encourage a more generous provision for the.
support of those institutions, but should
prompt the establishment of others of a
similar character. They are doubtless much
more potent for good than the day schools
on the reservation, as the pupils are separat
ed from the surroundings of savage life and
brought into constant contact with civiliza
tion. There are many other phases of this sub
ject which are of great interest, but which
cannot be included within the becoming
limits of this communication. They are dis
cussed ably in the reports .of the Secretary
of the interior and the Commissioner of In
dian Affairs.
THB MOBMONB.
For many years the Executive in his annu
al message to Congress has urged the neces
sity of stringent legislation for the suppres
sion of polygamy in the territories, and
especially in the Territory of Utah. The
existing statute for the punishment ef
this odious crime, so revolting to the moral
and religious sense of Christendom, has been
persistently and contemptuously violated
ever since Us enactment. Indeed, in spite of
th commendable efforts on the part of the
authorities who represent the United States
in that Territory, the law has in very rare
instances been enforced, and for a cause to
which reference will presently be made is
practically a dead letter.
The fact that the adherents of the Mormon
church, which rests upon polygamy as its
corner stone, have recently been peopling
in large numbers in Idaho, Arizona and
other of our 'Western Territories, is well
calculated to excite the liveliest interest and
apprehension. It imposes upon Congress
and the Executive the duty of using against
this barbarous system all the power which,
under the Constitution and law, they can
- wield for its destruction. .
Beference has been already made to the
obstacles which the United States officers,
have encountered in their efforts to punish
violations of law. Prominent among the ob
stacles is tbe difficulty of procuring legal evi
dence sufficient to warrant a conviction, even
in the case of the most. notorious offenders.
Your attention is called to a recent opinion
of the Supreme Court of the United States,
explaining its judgment' of reversal in the
case of Miles, who - had' been convicted of
bigamy in Utah. The court refers to the
fact that the secrecy attending the celebra
tion of marriage in that Territory makes the
proof of polygamy very difficult, and the
propriety is suggested of a change in the
law of evidence which now makes : a
wife incompetent to testify against her
husband. ; This suggestion is approved.' ; I
recommend also the passage of
an act providing that in the Territories of the
United States the fact that a woman has been
married to a person charged with bigamy
shall not disqualify her as witness upon bis
trial for that offense. I further recommend
legislation by which any persons solemnizing
marriage in any of the Territories shall be
required, under stringent penalties for neg
lect or refusal, to file a certificate of such
marriage in the Supreme Court of the Terri
tory.. If Congress may devise other practi
cable measures for obviating the difficulties
which bare hitherto attended the efforts to
suppress ims iniquity, a assure you or my
determined purpose to co-operate with you
in any lawful and discreet measures which
may be proposed to that end.
PUBLIC XDUOATION.
Although our system of government does
not contemplate that the nation should pro
vide or support a system for the education of
our people, no measures calculated to pro
mote that general intelligence and virtue
upon which the perpetuity of our institu
tions so greatly depends have ever been re
garded with indifference by Congress or the
Executive. A large portion of the public do
main has been-, from time to time, devoted to
the promotion of education. There is now a
, special reason why, by setting apart the pro-
ceeds of its sales of public lands, or by some
other course, the government should aid the
work of education. . Slany who now exercise
. the right of suffrage are unable to read the
ballot which they cast. . Upon many who had
I just emerged from a condition of slavery
, were suddenly devolved the. responsibilities
of citizenship in that portion of the country
I most impoverished by war. I 'have been
1 pleased to learn from the report of the Com
. missioner of Education that there has been
: lately a commendable increase of interest and
, effort for their instruction, but all that can
i be done by local legislation and private gen-
erosity should be supplemented by such aid
l as can be constitutionally afforded by the
national government. I would suggest that
jf any funa be dedicated to this purppse it
may be wisely distributed in the different
States, according to the ratio of illiteracy, as
, by those means those locations which are
' most in need of such assistance will reap its
especial benents.

increase of oar population, and the consequent ad
dition to the number of those engaged in the pursuit
of husbandry, are giving to this department a grow
ing dignity and importance. The Commissioner's
suggestions touching its capacity for greater useiul
. neas. deserve attention, as it more and more com
mends itself to the interest which it was created to
promote.
FUSIONS.
it appears from the report of the CommlssioneB of
Pensions that since 1860 789,063 original pension
clainis have been filed ; 460,949 of these have been al
lowed and inscribed on the pension rolls ; 72,639 have
been reported and abandoned, being 13.6 plus per
oent. of the whole number of claims settled. There
are now pen din? for settlement 266.575 orisical pen
sion claims. 237,040 of which were hied prior to July
1, 1880. These, when allowed, will Involve the pay
ment of arrears from the date of discharge in case of
an invalid, and from the date of death or termination
of a prior right in all other oases. From all the data
obtainable it is estimated that nlteen per cent, oz tne
number of claims now pending will be rejected or
abandoned. This would show the probable rejectl n
of 34.040 cases and the probable admission of about
193,000 claims, all of which involve the payment of
arrears of pensions With the present foroe em
ployed, the number of adjudications remaining tbe
same and no new business intervening, this number
of claims (193,000) could be acted upon In a period of
six years; and taking January 1st, 1884, as a near
period from which the estimate ii based on the aver
age amount of arrears, it is found that
every case allowed ' would require fo
the first paymettt the sum of $1,350. Multiplying
this amount by the whole number of probable ad
missions elves 250.000.00 as the sum required for
first payments.. This represents the sum which must
be paid upon claims which were filed before July 1,
1880, and are now pending and entitled to the benefits
of the arrears act. From this amount $250,000,000
may be deducted, from $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 for
cases where the claimant dying there is no person
who under the law would be entitled to succeed to
the pension, leaving $235,000,000 as the probable
amount to be paid, in these estimates no ao
oount has been taken of the 38.500 cases filed.
since June 30, 1880, and now pending, which must re
ceive attention as current business, but which do
not involve the payment of any arrears beyond the
date of filing the clalmB. or this number it is esti
mated that eiffhtv-six per cent, will be allowed. It
has been stated that with the present force of the
pension bnreau (625 clerks) it is estimated that it will
take six years to aispose ox tne claims now penning.
It is stated by tbe Commissioner of Pensions that by
an addition of 250 clerks (increasing the adjudicating
force rather than the mechaxtical) double the amount
of work could be accomplished, so that these cases
oould be acted upon within three years. Aside from
the considerations of justice which may be urged for
a speedy settlement of the claims now on the files of
the pension office, it is not less important on the
score of economy, inasmuch as fully one-third of the
clerical force of the office is now wholly occupied in
attention to correspondence with the thousands of
claimants whose cases have been on the files for the
last eighteen years. The fact that a sum so enor
mous may be expended by the government to meet
the demands for arrears of pensions is an admonition
to Conaress and the Executive to crive cautious con
sideration to any similar project in the future. 3 he
great temptation to present fictitious claims afforded
by the fact that the average sum obligated pon each
application is $13,000 leads me to suggest the proprie
ty of making some special appropriation for the pre
vention of fraud.
INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.
I ad vis e appropriations for such internal Improve
ments as-the wisdom of Congress may deem to be
necessary and of public importance. The necessity
of imrrrovinc- the navigation of the Mississippi river
Justifies a special allusion to that subjeet. I suggest
the adoption of some measure for the removal of ob
structions which now impede the na igition ox tnai.
great channel ox commerce.
THE CIVXI, SERVICE.
In my letter accepting the nomination for the Vice
Presidency I stated that in my judgment no man
should be an incumbent of an office the duties of
which he is for any cause unfit to perform, who is
lackinct in the ability, fidelity or integrity which
proper administration of such office demands. This
sentiment would doubtless meet with general acqui
escence but opinion has been widely divided upon
the wisdom and the practicability of tae vari
ous reformatory schemes which have
been suraested and of certain proposed regulations
governing appointments to public office. The effi
ciency of such regulations has been distrusted main
ly because they have seemed to exalt mere education
and -'abstract tests above general business capacity
and even special fitness for the particular worx in
hand. It memi to me that the rulB which should be
applied to the management of the public service
may proporly conform in the main to such as regulate
the conduct of successful private business. Original
appointments should be based on ascertained fitness.
Positions of responsibility should, so far as practica
ble, be filled by the promotion of worthy and efficient
officers. The investigation of all claimants and the
punishment of all official misconduct should be
prompt and thorough. The views expressed in the
foregoing letter are those which will govern my ad
ministration of the executive office. They are doubt
less shared by all intelligent and patriotic citizens,
however divergent in their opinions as to the best
methods of putting them into practical operation
For example, the assertion that oginal appoint
ments should be based upon ascertained fitnsss is not
open to dispute, but the question how in practice
such fitness can be most effectually ascertained has
for years excited interest and discussion. The
measure which, wltn slight variations in its details.
has lately been urged upon the attention of Congress
and the Executive, has as its -principal feat
ure a scheme of competitive examination.
Save for certain exceptions which nee 3
not be - specified, this plan would . give
admission to the service only in its lowest grade
and would accordingly demand that all vacancies in
higher osltions should be filled by promotion. In
these particulars it is in conformity with the existing
civil service system of Great Britain, snd indeed the
success which has attended that system in the coun
try of its birth is the strongest argument which has
been urged for its adoption here. The fact should
not, however, be overlooked that there are certain
features of the English system which have not gene
rally been received with favor in this country, eveu
among the foremost advocates of civil service reform
Among them are : First, a tenure of office which is
substantially a life tenure ; second, a limitation of
the maximum age at which an applicant can enter
the service, whereby all men in middle life or older
are. with some exceptions rigidly excluded ; third, a
retiring allowance upon going out of office. These
three elements are as important factors of
the problem as any of the others. To elim
inate them from the English system would effect
a most radical cnange in its tneory and practice.
Continuing his remarks upon the subject of the civ
il service the President expresses doubt whether it
would be for the best interests of the public to fix
upon an expedient for immediate extensive applica
tion which -embraces certain features of the English
system but excludes or ignores others of equal im
portance.' He calls attention to the defects of com
petitive examinations, and also to the defects of
rigid system of promotion. He points out that the
work or correcting the evils complained ox must be
gradual, ana says : "it may be tnac before we
confine ourselves upon this important question with
in the stringent bounds of a statutory enactment we
may profitably await the result of further inquiry
and experiment. He suggests that the submission of
a portion of the nominations to a central board of ex
aminers, selected solely for testing the qualifications
of applicants, may perhaps, without resort to a com
petitive teitjrot an end to the mischief which attends
tne present system ox appointment, ana it may
be forcible -to vest in such a board a
wide discretion to ascertain the characteris
tics and attainments of candidates. He thinks that
a majority of the employes of the government do
tneir duty in a manner deserving or high commenda
tion. Concerning the deplorable condition of our mer
chant marine, he thinks that if we had given to our
navigation interests a portion of the aid and pro tec
tin which have been so wisely bestowed upon our
manufacturers the former would now be In better
condition.
He recommends legislation concerning ths super
vision and transitory care of immigrants at the ports
ox .ae oar jcation.
He recommends giving Alaska such a form of gov
ernment as will promote the education of the people
and secure the administration of justice.
He gives attention to the need of a building for the
library of Congress, and to the need of doing some
thing to make the Potomac marshes less unhealthy
for the people of Washington. . Other District im
provements, are also spoken of.
He urges that something be done before another
presidential election about tne electoral count. The
concluding portion of the message is as follows :
P RESIDENTIAL DISABILITY.
Questions which concern the very existence of the
government ana tne uoercies ox tne peopte were sug
gested by the prolonged illness of the
late President, and his consequent incapacity
to perform the functions of his oflta.
It to provided by the second article of the Constitu
tion, in tne nrtn clause oi iw nrst section, tnat in
case ef the removal of the President from office, or of
his death, resignation or inability to discharge the
powers and duties of said office, the same shall de
volve on the Vice President. What is the interpreta
tion of the Constitution of its specification of "inabil
ity to discharge the powers asd duties of said office
as one of the contingencies which calls the Vice
President to the exercise of the Presdential functions?
Is the inability limited in its nature to long contin
ued intellectual incapacity, or has it a broader im
port T What must be its extent and duration T How
must its existence be established ? Has the President
whose -inability is the subject of inquiry any voice in
determining whether or not it exists T Or is the de
cision of that momentous and delicate question con
fided to the Vice President? Or is it contemplated
by the Constitution that Congress should provide by
a law precisely what should constitute inabili
ty and how and by " what tribunal
or authority it should be ascertained ? If the inabil
ity proves to be temporary in its nature, and during
its continuance the Vice President lawfully exercises
the functions of the Executive, by what tenure does
he hold his office ? Does he continue as President for
the remainder of the four years term ? Or would
the elected President, if his inability should cease in'
the interval, be empowered to resume his office, and if
having s-ich lawful authority lie should exercise it
would the Vice President be thereupon empowered to
resume his powers and duties as usual ? I cannot
doubt that these Important questions will receive
your early and thoughtful consideration.
Deeply impressed with the gravity of the responsi
bilities which have so unexpectedly devolved upon
me, it will be my constant purpose to co-operate with
you In such measures as will promote the glory of the
country and the prosperity of its people.

Appended are a few testimonials, want of space for

the Doctor's office. Case 1 is that of a lady whe was
pronounced by three of the most prominent physi
cians of her native oity to be in the last stage of con
sumption, and told that her case was helpless snd
hopeless. After being restored to sound health by
Dr. Lyon ahe sent the following letter, earnestly re
questing that it should be published In the hope that
It might reach others similarly afflicted :
To ail who may be afiUoted with that common dis
ease. Consumption, or any Weakness of the lungB, I -would
appeal to them to immediately oonsult Dr. John
L. Lyon, of New Haven, Conn., feeling sure that by so
doing they may be restored to health. For several
years I was troubled with a oough, hemorrhage of the
lungs and the usual symptoms of Consumption. 1
consulted and was treated by some of the most emi
nent physiolans the country afforded, without derlv
lng any permanent benefit whatever. In theeprlng
of 1863 the disease nude such rapid progress that my
attending physician and friends gave np all hopes of
my recovery. On the 16th of May, 1863, I odnsulted
the above named Doctor. I was at that time reduced
to a perfect wreck of my former self, coughing In
cessantly, and it would seem just on the verge of the
grave. After the usual examination, ha kindly but
plainly Informed me as others had done, that my dis
ease wss Incurable ; that I had but a few months to
live. Having great oonfidence In his skill, I Insisted
upon his treating ray case. He did so. and with as
tonishing success. In twenty days from the time I
oommenced Che use of his medicines, my oough wss
less frequent, I suffered no mora from hemorrhage of
the lungs, and day by day found the terrifying symp
toms of Consumption disappearing, and was gradual
ly regaining health. I was treated by him one year
at the end of that time I oan truly say I was restored
to perfect health. It is now March, 1866, and no
symptoms of the disease are felt. I have reason to
feel sure that I shall suffer no return of the disease,
and it is not only a pleasure to me, but a duty I feel
that I owe to hundreds of sufferers who are being
dally earned to the grave by Consumption, to urge
upon them the neoeesity of seeking relief where 1
may b found. Very respectfully, D. M. 8.
The lady who wrote the foregoing continues In ner
feet health.
The following Is an extract from a letter receiv
ed from a patient treated and oured.of rin weak
ness: Db. Ltos Dear Sir It is impossible for me to ful
ly express my gratitude to you concerning the effect
which your medicine has produced upon my system.
I have just finished the medicine you put up for me
and oan truthfully say that I feel a different being.
My appetite is very regular, and I am not troubled
with that dull headache that 1 onoe had, and Bleep
never was so refreshing, as I am not disturbed with
dreams. Before I came to you it was difficult for ma
to eonnne my thoughts for any length of time to any
subject, undoubtedly owing to that complaint, and
the oentrast is quite noticeable. If I ever know one
troubled with that complaint, I shall Immediately di
rect them to yon as an effectual means of boss ours.
for it seems to me thst I almost owe my life to you,
for if It had been allowed to grow upon me the time
oould not have been far distant when that incurable
disease (consumption) would have been deepljaBaated
in my system. Plesse accept my sincere thanks for
your treatment thus far. I remain, yenrs truly,!
