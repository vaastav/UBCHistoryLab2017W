Monterey, Va. December & !3D3.
The contraction of business b
pretty plainly shown bv tbe vast
yoi time of idle money in thc east.
The Dioney is still piling np in
the New York hanks, anti pi csu ra*
ably in the hunks ot' al! tho money
centers.
Among Port Monmouth'* indus?
tries is a bologna sausage factor}'
which grinds np tn average of ten
horses 4 (lay together with a littl**j
pork and beef. The sausage.? are
shipped to foreign con nt rios.
The Herald says: '?H-.erc is no
rscare1 anywhere, and in Wall street
which is the most sensitive test'
there has been a decided improve?
ment in the values of railroad stocks
and Louds since the term
pi the proposed new law
were made known. True, there has
been a howl from tho Sugar Tru*i
and the price of its certificates lats
been marked down, and a variation
of a few points in these volatile
speculative counters is a matter oi
daily occurrence when there is no
tariff discussions. The people have
known for a year that the tarin
was to he revised. They elected
the present national administra?
tion for the purpose of doing thal
very work, ami thc changes propos?
ed are scarcely as sharp and radical
as many people expected.
Tue World discourses as follow
on a timely topic:
Two distinguished members cf
the Cabinet, the .Secretary of War
and the Secretary of tho Navy, are
profounly considering the question
pf whether cr not long hair is es?
sential to good foot-ball playing.
There is a rule in the Academies
at Wast Point and Annapolis that
the hair of the ca-lets and '?mid?
dies" shall be worn shott?close
cropped, in fact. It is proposed to
enforce this rule even at the sacri?
fice of the pi ide and protection i-f
the heroes of tito football held.
The hviys protest against such
cruel violation of the sacred tradi?
tion of the game that is impossible
to play without long and matted
hair. They not only object to the
rape of their locks on aesthetic
grounds, but insist that logo info
a pigskin battle witli exposed scalp
would be most hazardous. Thc
boys are determined. There can be
no hair-splitting in thc question,
lt is a matter of long hair or no
football.
A Point for Business Men.
When the free silver lunacy was
being harped upon' the country
over, it will be remembered that
the business men of thc country
argued that the men wanted free
silver were ignorant of Quautial
itel's and that the men who rc
icw fnun daily study of the
r, knew that free silver did
mean free money. Thc point
was wei] made.
Now wc come to the tariff mat?
ter. This new bill is the work ol
.men who have given years to the
study of the tariff question. Thai
has been their business. They
know the resources of the govern?
ment. They know what portion ol'!
the people are taxed, how they j
ari taxed and for whose benelit]
they ure taxed. Theirs is, then,
exp ni testimony, just as the busi?
ness man's opposition to the free
silver policy was expert opposition.
The manufacturer whose profit i
marked down by the new tariff,
measure mu-t bear in mind that j
the bill is for the benefit of the ma-1
ny and nut for his benefit alone.
Tite men having tho matter iii j
han 1 have at ted as experts. The
manufacturer must, therefore, now
practice what he n few months ago
preached -trust tho matter to these
who ni lerst tn 1 it.?-State.
X'mkd Wilson Bili
Prom The St. Louis Republic, Dem . I
No disturbed feeling appears in j
justness circles. The democratic!
misses feel that the plejge-i of the"
party are redeemed by a bill which \
pandie-) irons and woolens jut-t
ah.. .'l '-Secretary Waiker handled j
the :. ; .iicilulc ?' of the hill of j
lt \i a bill capable of producing a
-__- -: awmsmi irmr r mw ??aii__at_a??w_-aB-we?
j surplus revenue, under strict demo
: eratic administration of expendi
j cures, as the Walker tariff did. lt
is a bill which will prepare the way
for the lowering of duties that was
made in 1857. The bill of 1857
was passed without objection from
tiie manufacturing classes. They
hal adjusted themselyes to low
tariffs and were not dissatisfied with
the prospects of a tariff for revenue
only. So it will be with them
after the Wilson bill gets into op
oration.
WASHINGTON LETTER,
| From our Regular Correspondent,]
Washington, D. C. Dec. 4,?
President Cleveland's message to
Congress is unusually long, but the
number and importance of the sub?
jects with which it deals made it
necessary that it should be. Like
all of his utterances it is straight?
forward and to the point and even
the republicans admit that it is an
abie presentation ofilemocratic pol
icy. Tariff reform as em bod.
ied in the Wilson bill is commend?
ed language that carries conviction
and Congress is earnestly urged to
[>:;ss the bill at the earliest possible
moment in order that the business
of the country may be adjusted to
the new conditions.
The opening of the regular ses?
sion of Congress finds the dem?
ocrats in much better condition
than did the opening of the extra
session. A few democrats repre?
senting districts that may be tem?
porarily injured by some of the
proposed tariff c hinges are dissat?
isfied wih the Wilson bill, but as
ti rule the democrats take the same
view of the hill that was so aptly
expa-essed by Representative Tars
ney, of Missouri, who is a member
<>[ the Ways and Means committee
It is not simply a revision of the
larill?it is a reform of the tariff.
Time will develop that it contains
no clement of prejudice or animos?
ity against any particular industry
or attack upon the manufacturing
industries; on the cotrary, it is in?
tended and will speedily result in
the rapid growth, develcpement
and expansion of our industries
upon a broad national basis, and
not upon a narrow basis of selfish
personal, local or sectional ii.t-r
e'sts. While taking aw.ay from the
manufacturer much of the so-call?
ed protection found in the schedule
of rates on manufactured products,
by giving him untaxed raw mate?
rial essential in his manufactures,
wc leave to him all that should be
required to enable him to compete
with the world in the disposition of
his products.
Thc delay caused by theprepara
i ion of estimates by the Treesury
department, showing in detail the
difference there would be in im?
port duties received by the govern?
ment under the Wilson bill as com?
pared with those paid under the
McKinley law, has revived among
democrats the talk of submitting
[he Wilson bill to a democratic
caucus before it is reported to the
House. It is argued by those who
favor this pian th.tt it would be
Letter to have it determined by
caucus whether the bill should be
amended than to have the demo?
crats try to get amendments adopt?
ed on tlie floor of the House and
that it would also save time in dis?
posing of the bill. The question
his not been decided but judging
Irom the talk of members, the
chances appe.tr .against the bill be?
ing submitted to a caucus before it
is aoported. and it will not be after?
wards, unless there shall he much
more democratic opposition to it
than has yet been shown.
If a hint from an official source
be founded on fact President Cleve?
land has succeeded in accomplish?
ing something that will make his
administration one of the most dis?
tinguished in American history and
one of the most popular, making a
new treaty with China, under which
the government of China, agrees to
purchase annually silver produced
hy American mines to the value of
?51>,< "-0.000 -- abo a t our entire pro- j \
linet?and to throw its markets
open to our manufacturers. It has
been the dream of the European
statesmen for many years to get
the valuable Chinese trade for their
respective countries, and if Presi?
dent Cleveland has succeeded he
has gained the greatest interna?
tional commercial triumph of the
century, one worth untold wealth
to the people of the United Stales, I ?
and enc that will soon give us the [
commercial supremacy of the J
w .rid. i
So much has been said, not only j (
by republicans but even by some ?
democrats, about the enormous cost '?
of the special examiners who have : (
been employed for some months to
investigate suspected frauds on the
petition roll that Secretary Smith's
statement on the subject, in his an?
nual report, is decidedly interesting
as well as timely. Thc much talk?
ed of special examiners have un?
earthed actual frauds in Iowa, Now i
Mexico and Virginia alone, which i
saved the government more money
than the entire cost of salary and
maintaianance of all thc special ex?
aminers employed by the Penson
Bureau, and to Say nothing of eas
elsewhere. So the special examin?
ers are money savers for the gov?
ernment instead of money wasters.
Secretary Smith also calls atten?
tion to the fact that in making
suspensions he has simply follow?
ed the policy that has always guid?
ed the Pension Bureau in dealing
with similar cases. Tho report en?
dorses the application ef Arizona.
New Mexico and Utah for state?
hood.
MACON MYSTIFIED.
Macon, Ga., December 1.?(Spec?
ial.)?Macon experienced a sensa?
tion this morning that has thrown
the whole city into a fever of ex?
citement.
It was certainly a strange mystery
that this city had to think over for
a long time and surpass all under?
standing or explanation.
It is not exactly a ghost story.
but by those inclined to besupersti
tious the spirit of some departed cit?
izen is charged with responsibility
for the mystery.
This morning about nine o'clock
Mr. Will Ervin of the Georgia Mu?
sic house, with several em ph-yes of
ti.e store w.as in the tuning room
in the rear engaged in tuning scv
eral instruments, when their atten?
tion was attracted by u pepperinj
noise of something falling on the
floor like rain pattering on a roof.
The men all stopped and began to
investigate. The result of the in?
vestigation soon had the hair of ev?
ery man present standing porcupine
fashion, and their f.acecovered with
a thousand little hamps raised by
sheer fright.
It was raining shot. A sterdy
shower of No. 0 bird shot was rain?
ing from toward the ceiling all
over thc room.
The shot came peppering down
thick and fast, from whence no oue
could tell, and rattled on the expos?
ed string boards of the open pian?
os and stiff hats making a noise that
tended, under the circumstances, to
further increase the fears of the
frightened men.
The most thorough investigation
revealed the fact that there was no?
one up-stairs and the upper floor
was swept clean of everything. The
ceiling is sound and tongued and
grooved so as to render it even wa?
ter and air proof.
Several well-known people were
telephoned and culled from the
street to witness the strange phe?
nomenon. All were mystified be?
yond expression.
For more than two hours the)
shot shower continued unabated.
During that time a large number
of people, who had heard the strange
story, visited the scene. The ver-'
diet of all was the same, that is was
the strangest mystery in the histo?
ry of Macon and surpassed ail un?
derstanding and explanation.
As soon as' the afternoon paper
wine out with the story the visitors
to the scene began to increase and
the room is continually full. Sev?
eral people havegnthered up hands

A Lawyer's Stratagem.
i
A Well-known Kansas citizen {
tells this story:
Fifteen years ago Judge Mc?
sweeney was a famous criminal ;
lawyer of Southern Michigan. Rt
was called upon to defend a young
woman from the charge of bavin:;
poisoned her old husband, it was
t question of whether or not she
iud placed poison ia a cake of which
'he old man had eaten. A portion
)i the cake had beeen analyzed by I
t chemist and found to contain a ;
great deal of deadly poison. The;
shemist testified to this in court.
)ther witnesses succeeded in mak
ug a chain of damning eviden ?
.goinst the pretty young widow.
The time came for the summing
ip speeches ot the attorneys, i \ i
prosecution began and finished and
ill looked hopeless for the prisoi
ti the bar. Judge McsS*weeny,
>nly speaker for the defence,
maid breath ie- . ? tom
vas crowded ir,! til wera lisienii
)ne could almost hear the quiet it
,vas so intense. He began in a low
one to sum up the evidence
n defence of the prisoner. He had
jeen allowed an hour in which to
}lead his side of the case. He
lealt with everything hut the cake.
lt rested upon the t.able just at his
?ight hand, where it had stood dar?
ug all the weary trial. Thirty
minutes passed and the people wore
?itIII motionless, charmed by the
iweet eloquence of the gruff old
lawyer. Three-quarters of an hour
passed by, then another ten min?
utes.
When the clock over the big
lesk told him, there were but five
minutes left, he reached his hand
jut to the cake, half of which stood
upon the table, and broke off a
ragged chunk. He held this in his
hand and between sentences took
?reat mouthsfuil of it. During
those five minutes he calmly ar?
gued the case and ate cake. He de
molished more than half of it.
The chemist had declared that
there was poison enough in it to
kill fifty men. The good people
looked at him in amazement and
the jurors turned to each other and
whispered. McSweeny wound ap
his speech, took .mother chunk of
cake and walked quietly from thc
court room eating it. He closed
the door behind him, ran into a
small room close hy and locked the
door. Two physicians stood ready
with a stomach pump, and in ten
minutes the cake was all in the slop
jar. The jury returned a verdict of
"not guilty'' without leaving the
courtroom.
