TIW WAR 11KV1VED
After tho lull of a fow days Uiclr arm
istice expiring tho Sorvlans and Hulgar
taus lmvo resumed hostilities and tho
peace of Kurope la now moro threatened
tlian over AK Mrs nro In such a tangle
that It does uot scorn possible for them to
be settled without engaging Ititssla and
Austria and probably Tinkoy In war
As a dependency on Turkey llulgarla
called upon tho porto for protection when
Invaded by Servla That government
gave no response and Prlnco Alexander
took tho field drovo tho Invading eiioiny
from his dominions and was In position
to dictate a peace when his suroraln tho
cowardly Turkish govcrhmeut which
had declined to protect Its do
pendencies forbade tho victor
ous prlnco to enter Into treaty
of peace for lack Of autonomy Austria
Intervened In behalf ol tho Servians and
threatened to occupy Hulgarla in case
Alexander pursued tho retreating Serbs
Into Servla Now llussla comes forward
and proposes to support Bulgaria even to
tbo extent of giving military aid If this
news Is true thcro Is no doubt that the
llulgarlaus will at onco march Into Scrvia
Such n move cannot but bring Austria
into tho war It that government keeps Its
threat to expel tho llulgarlaus from Ser
vla nnd such a combination against Hul
garla will bring llussla Into tho conflict
Tho only way to keep out of tho trou
ble In for Austria to bid down from Its
threat or llussla to violate Its promise of
assistance to Alexander It Is nothing
unusual or unexpected for either of those
powers to break faith with Its neighbors
but lu this case It seems that the desire Is
moio or a pretext of war than Its avoid
ance Tho pretext Is easily found and if
there Is to bo general war lu tho Dast wo
will probably know It In a week or two
i i
ioir srin run hystem is

Tho president makes a fearful arraign
ment of tho abuses of tho present system
of conducting tho fed el ill judiciary
United States marshals ami district attor
neys are paid by fees for their services
and this system tbo president declares
offers direct Inducocwlit for them to
make their fees In criminal cases s large
as possible In nn effort to reach the
maximum sum permitted As an entirely
natural consequence unscrupulous mar
shals aro found encouraging frivolous
prosecutions arresting people on petty
charges of crime transporting them to
distant places for examination for the
purpose of earning inlleago and other
fees A case appositely Illustrating the
truth Of those remaiks occurred a week
ago In this state A cowboy at 1ort
Heno In tho Indian Territory stole or
was charged with stealing n pair of worn
out pants worth about twentylive cents
A United States marshal from Dallas
went after tbo culprit and brought him
to Dallas by way of Kansas Twenty
witnesses vvero summoned from
Texas Indian Territory and Kan
sas The prisoner was upon their
testimony discharged Tbo government
will bavu to pay tho mileage of tho mar
shal from Dallas to Fort lteno and back
by way of Kansas tho fees of n cloud of
witnesses and other fees and costs
amounting it Is computed to 1500 nil
to convict n man of stealing a pair of
fruyedout pants and after nil hu was
not convicted And tho end Is not yet
for the federal nttorncy caused tho wit
nesses to enter In bond for nppearanco at
tho next term of tho United States dis
trict court to give their evidence before
the grand jury Tho case wllf then be
retried tbo costs doubled and tho
government will pay probably S000 In
tho effort to convict a man of appropriat
ing L5ceut pair of pants which tho
owner would probably have given him
for a chew of tobacco
Mr Clevelands head IsMovcl Abolish
the fee system and prevent such abuses
by removing tho incentive lo them
