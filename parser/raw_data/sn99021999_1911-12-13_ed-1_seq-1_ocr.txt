SCENE OF GREAT SPLENDOR
New Sovereign Signalises Event by
Assoaielng Large Gifts for
Popular Education Cheers
for Veteran Soldiers,
DELHI, India. Deo. 12 KJg George
V and hla consort, Queen Mary, were to
day proclaimed emperor and empress of
of Induu The culminating act of the
Kngllsh monarch's accession to the throne
of hla vast Indian dominions took place
amid a acene which for richness of color
and magnificence of decorations probably
never has been purpassed In modern
time.
The crowning was followed by an act
of generosity on the klng-emperors part,
of which a alight hint had been given.
The viceroy proclaimed that the king
emperor was to donate a large sum of
money to promote popular education and
that further handsome gifts would be
made.
The hug amphitheater which had been
rooted la the Durbar oamp was thronged
from an early hour. The bright tissues
and sparkling gems of the many Indian
prlncea and tm smart uniforms of the
soldiery contrasted strongly with the
white dresses of the European women
and the sober garb of civilian officials,
The great feudatory princes and rulers
of India, with tne leading British offi
cials ocoupled seats of honor near the
pavilion located In the center. Screened
from the gase of the curious by a lattice
frame work a number of Maharans and
other Indian women of high rank occu
pied two sections of the front galleries.
Cheers for Veterans.
Cheers heralded the arrival of a little
band of veterans, the survivors of the
armies which had made the present Dur
bar possible. The old fighters In their
weather-beaten uniforms strove to keep
up a show of military formation as they
marched to the privileged place allotted
them, but generally It was Impossible,
aTMa many of them limped to their aeats.
Then the booming of an Imperial salute
announced the approach of the emperor
and empress. The royal carriage drawn
by four magnificent horses, was almost
bidden from view by the gaily caprl
oned escort. The emperor wore a robe
of imperial purple with white satin
breeches ' and silk stockings. He was
decked with the color of the orders' of
the trarter - and' the 'star of India and
also with the star of the latter order.
The imperial crown consisted of a band
of diamonds studded with large eraer
a!ds and saphlres with rubles In the
center and a cap of purple velvet trimmed
wltn ermine.
Empress Wears White Sat I a.
The queen-empress dress was of white
satin embroidered with a design of roses,
thistles and shamrocks, with a border
of lotus flowers. The star of India was
embroidered on the front of her dress,
Her majesty's imperial robe was of pur
pie velvet trimmed with ermine and with
a border of gold brald.She wore the
orders of the garter arid the star of
India. Her ornaments were a diamond
and emerald necklace and brooches.
The combined processions proceeded
lowly to the great central tent where
their majesties stood to receive the hom
age and congratulations of governors,
ruling princes and other representatives
of British India.
, When this gorgeously uniformed line
had filed past the imperial and vice regal
parties apeared before the vast assem
blage In the Durbar amphitheatre. When
they took their aeats on the crimson dais
the strains of the national anthem were
heard and the people rose as one per
son and stood in profound Bilence.
It was a pretty group around the four

hand?"
"No, air."

pushed her down the hall and into her

she reached Into an open drawer behind
her and got the revolver with which she
shot him.
When I got the pistol out," continued

fore he got the gun away from me. i
don'? know Just when I fired.

Miss Conrad said she was 19 years old.
She first met Lillian Graham last April.

KANSAS CITY. Dec. 12.-Contrary to
the plan announced yesterday, the Jury

Hyde, accused of murdering Colonel

Porterfield decided late today that he

Waldron has been missing since Mon

whereabouts after he fled has been
found. That came today when Mrs.
Reldy Werby, who lived a short distance

started, although officers place little con

WASHINGTON, Dec. IJ.-tPpcclal Tel.

the pliu-e which the national republican
committeeman from Nebraska occupied In
the hearts of members of the rt-publlcua
national committee It hh dixlaUd to
day when Victor Ilosewuter, edllur ol
Tho Vic, received tho two most Important
committee assignments within the powei
of the committee to glvo places on tht
subcommittee, on call for national con
vention and on the subcommittee on ar.
rangemcnts for the' republican national
convention, which will be hold In Chicago
on Juno 18 next year.
Early In the morning session of the re.
publican national committee. Mr. Rose
water moved to accept the realisation of
Postmaster General Frank A. Hitchcock
as chairman of the national committee,
with the thanks of the committee for thu
untiring and devoted work which Mr.
Hitchcock had given to the organisation.
With the time and place of the next
republican national convention settled,
the question of the call for the convention
came up, a dlvlshlon In the committee as
to the optional primaries becoming appar
ent following discussion.
Messrs. Ward of New York, Capers of
South Carolina. Rosewater of Nebraska,
Borah of Idaho and Lowden of Illlnolc
were named as a committee to draft the
call and Jhraeh out the question whether
there xhould be state primaries to select
delegates to the convention In states
where primaries are not recognized by
state laws.
Two Reports Snbmltted.
As a result of a long conference two
reports were submitted to the convention,

optional primaries. Senator .Borah of
Idaho presented a minority report, but
eventually eliminated one cause of die-
between members of the committee as to
whether state committee! should be
enabled to call primaries for selection of
delegates if they desired.
With certain objectionable features re
moved from the Borah report, Mr. Rose-
water voted with the Idaho senator, aa
did representatives from Colorado, Idaho,
Delaware, Oregon, South Dakota and
Wisconsin. t
The Borah report perntlttcd state or
ganisations to lmrpovlse primaries to
elect national convention delegates in the
absence of any state law, while the report
as overwhelmingly adopted authorises
primary election of national convention
delegates only In states that have such
I .
primary laws.
While the convention call provides that
delegates to the republican national con
vention must be elected, thirty days be
