The art of baking was carried to a
high perfection among tho Egyptians,
who are said to have baked cakes i
many fantastic shapes, using several
kinds of flour. The Romans took up
tho art of baking and public bakeries
were numerous on tho streets of Rome.
In England tile business of the baker
was considered to bo ono so closely af
fecting the interests of the public that
in 1260 an act of Parliament was passed
regulating the price to bo charged for
bread. This regulation continued in
operation until 1822 in London, and un
til 1836 in the rest of tho country. The
art of making broad has not yet reached

made, but rye cakes that aro baked

It is less than a century ngo teat bread

people of every class living on barley
bannocks and outon cukes. Owing
to the fact that bread is sold very cheap

country are a poorly paid class of la

use of child labor to such an extent
that parliament in 1863 passed a. law

THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
Constant and Rapid Growth of tho i'i
pies Using It.
In an article, "The Future of the
English-Speaking races,'' Mr. Glad
stone computes that tlig habitual apeak
era of English have increased from 15,
000,000 to 105,000,000 during the last
one hundred years, that they will num
ber 120,000,000 by the year 1900, and at
tho rate of increase, seven limes in a
century, they will include 840,000,000
people by the year 2000.
The increase during the last century
lias, of course, been duo chiefly to th<
growth of the United Stales. Sinn
1787 our population has been multiplied
twenty times, while that of the British
kingdom itself has only a little more
than doubled.
Wo huvo increased
from about 3,000.000 to raora than 60,
000,000, and England, including all the
British isles, hits increased front I I.
000,000 to 3.5,000,000,
while this country contained only one
fifth of the total of English-speak
people a century ago, it now con
tains three-fifths.
The increase during the next century,
computed by Mr. Gladstone, must
he in the United States in ohiei
part. If the present rate of grow th,
about 3 per cent, annually, should con
tinue, our population 100 years hence
would bo 700,000,000, or nearly twice

assuming tho gradual fall of the ratio

Mr. Barham Einclce, a weil known
writer, astonished tho world in 1883 by
estimating that in 100 years from that
I lie aggregate of the English-speak
races would bo 1,000,000,000. Ot
these he gave the United States 800,

can reasonably be estimated for the

Whether the present rato of inoroaso
this country continues during the

question that here is tho great seat, o
