Found Dead.?The Cabell Prat states
lliat Michael Ansel, au old and highly inspected
citizen of that county, was found
dead on his farm over on the Ohio river
Friday week. He went out to cut firewood,
and in felling n tree it fell on him,
completely breaking his skull. The same
paper says n man named Adam Lymbold,
a stone cutter from Mason City, employed

signify their desire tlmt Mr. Faulkner
shall cnntiuuc a counsel in the ease, anil
limiting it advisable to take some action
in the premises in anticipation of what
they hare no doubt will lie the action ol
the Legislature: Ordered, therelore, by
Hit Board that the county, concurring
with 'the action of the county ol
Jetreraon, doth employ C. J. Faulkner
ns the attorney of this county,
to appear on bclinlf of its citizens
and on behalf of West Virginia; and it i>
ordered that the sum of Ave hundred dollars
be appropriated and paid to tlio said
0. J. Faulkner on lielmlf of the county,
which sum is paid in advance of the appropriation
cxuecled to be made by the
Legislature, and when made this sum is
to lie lefunded to tbo county.
_ In further explanation ot the case we
extract from the IkrMey Union :
Virginia appropriated ten thousand
dollars to carry on the suit, and employed
Mr. Hunter, of Jefferson county, and Mr,
Curtis, of Massachusetts, as her counsel.
Ill February, ltMiS, llio Legislature of
West Virginia appropriated soven thousand
live hundred dollars, for costs and
counsel Tecs, to defend the suit, und, if we
mistake not, Hon. licvcrdy Johnson, Hon.
B. Stanton, and Judge Leo, were employed
as counsel for West Virginia. The
case was argued upon a demurrer to the
bill, and the Judges upon the Bench
were equally divided in opinion, thus
leaving the question undecided. Souio
lime alter that (if we mistake not it was in
Jauuary, 1809,) Mr. Faulkner ivent to
Washington to look after the caw apIiolnted,
aa wo undcretood, at the time,
upon his own proposition to giro bis services
free ol charge. For our pari wo
honor this gentleman for that, and at the
same tiiue think tbo State of West Virginia
ought to fool his bill. Ilo is undoubtedly
an able lawyer, and would
have influence and weight in the case,but
we certainly do object to Berkeley county
Pitying anything for the privilege of paying
money into tho Statu 1 reunify of
West Vlrgiuia.
The Union then discussing the appropriation
made by llio county to pay Mr.
Faulkner, continue:
"Wo beg loavo lo differ with those gentlemen
who voted for the appropriation,
and wo are informed they all did, cxccptinL'
Mr. Ballinger. The principle is wrong;
West Virginia In the defendant and not
the county of Berkeley. It la a part ol
the Bute territory that la claimed, and it
Is tlieduty of the Suite to protect that territory
.Berkeley county pays annually into
the Treasury something near $20,000. It
is the duty ol the Attorney-General of the
State to defend all suits against the State,
and not the rtutyof the Prosecuting Attorney
of Berkeley county. It Is the duty of
the Governor to employ additional counsel
when the exigencies of the case requires
it, and not the duty of the Board
of Supervisors so to do. Therefore the
Governor is sot hound to recommend, nor
the Legislature to appropriate tunds to reimburse
the county, liecausc the officials
of tho county cannot make contracts binding
on them. It may be claimed that the
original appropriation Is exhausted, and it
may he, that it all has been paid to Messrs.
Johnson, Lee and Stanton, still having
received their fees, they arc counsel in the
ease, and bound to attend to. It. Granting
even that they arc not counsel anil there
are no special funds appropriated, we hold
that the Govcrnoi has the right In attending
to tho civil interests ol the State; the
apparent exigencies of the case requiring
It, to appoint, retain, and contract with
attorneys to defend the State and lacking
said appropriation there is a contingent
fund out of which lie may pay the same.
It certainly is the business of the State
to look after the suit, especially as these
two arc among tho largest revenue paying
counties of the State. They are also counties
in which the State has not expended
and probably never will expend a dollar
lor public buildings or the like. The
|40,000 or #30,000 a year whlcli they pay
lit Cabell C. II., was rouuu Clean aunaay
evening (27th ult.) about & mile and a
halffrom thai town, with the appearance
of suicide, to which it was supposed lie
had been driven by domestic infelicity.
The Meeting or Congress.
Congress will meet at 12 ji. to-day. As
lwtli houses arc fully organized there will
be no necessary delay in receiving the
President's message. Of that message
we have had tho usual forcshadowings,
and as usual, they come from those who
know nothing about it, yet feci under
none the less obligation to say something
about it. The ingenious rejiortcr who
had an interview Willi .Senator Si'MNEk'h
two trunks could doubtless read the message
by leaning over the railing ot tho
White House grounds. The committees
of the House hold over, and it is not usual
to makeany changes In the Sonata committees
at an adjourned session. The law
requiring the Executive reports to be presented
in time to be laid before Congress
has been promptly complied with. The
estimates of the Treasury has been prepared,
and everything indicates that Congress
may enter, at once, upon active business,
und make good progress before tho
holidays interrupt the session.
The Berkeley nnd Jefferson Salt in
the Supreme Court,
The following paper was recently passed
by the Supervisors of Berkeley county:
Wiikhkas, There is a suit now pending
in the Supreme Court of the United
States, in which the Stale of Virginia is
complainant and the State of West Virginia
is defendant, the object of which
suit is to recover jurisdiction over the
counties of Berkeley und Jefferson anil
whereas, the Board of Su|iervlsors ol
Berkeley county deem it expedient to give
an expression to what they believo to be
the sentiments and wishes ol the people
of the county, and also to adopt such
measures as are proper on our |?rt-to
maintain and defend the sentiments nnd
interests of the people ol the county.
Jiaotmt, That in our opinion It Is the
wish and desire of the citizens ol Berkeley
"> county, nlmint unanimously to remain
with and continue a part of the Slate of
West Virginia.
Jtauleni, Thai we heartily approve ihe
action ol lhe Legislature Of West Virginia
in appropriating-, by a joint resolution
passed I'i'bruary 2;i, ISfW, the sum ol
$7,500 to defray ihe expense- ol the suit on
lieliaH 01 the biate and for the payment
ol counsel employed in its defense.
IIooImI, That we earnestly recommend
to the Legislature of the Slate to make
such additional appropriations as it may
deem expedient, especially that it make an
appropriation that will place Hon. C..).
> aulkner upon an equal footing as to the
compensation with the other counsel who
have been employed and paid in the case;
and it being brought to the notice of the
Board that an early day has been fixed
lor the hearing of the case before the Supreme
Court that the appropriation heretofore
made has bueu expended, and that
Mr. Faulkner has been employed 011 the
into the treasury is clean revenue. 11 no
provision exists for the employment of
counsel to defend the interests of the State
it shows either neglect or want of Intelligence
on the part of the Legislature. Yet
in the circumstances, wo sec no reason
why it may not be both proper and wise
for the counties interested to remedy the
lault. It would not be exactly as the
Union puts it, "paying for the privilege of
paying money into the treasury of West
Virginia." If Virginia succeeds in the
suit, Berkeloy and Jetferson will lave the
privilege of paying money into the treasury
of Virginia, and perhaps double cacli
year what they would to West Virginia.
The Supervisors of Berkeley Bay tho people
of that county almost unanimously
want to stay where they are; and in appropriating
f"00 to pay counsel they aro
but paying that much to secure "Utejr
choice into whicli treasury they will pay
their money for all time to come. Wo
conceive; the exiienditure is judieious,
even ir not refunded by the State.
Fihe is tiib State House;?On
Monday .night last, uirattompt was made
by some one to burn the State House
building at this place, that is now nearly
completed. There was a largo pile ol
rags on the floor of the third stury in tho
District Coilrt Room, used by the painters
to clcan the Iramcs before painting,
which were fouud at daylight tho next
morning to be almost consumed, while
tho tire was still burning very brightly in
the tloor. It was immediately extinguished
without material injury to the floor,only
having burned a hole a or 4 feet sqnarc.
It is thought by some that it was the work
of an incendiary, and by others to have
caught through* the ncgligcnce of some of
the hands. The (acts in all probability
will be brought out?Kanauha Journal
It the rags were saturated with oil or
turpentine, we should suspect the foregoing
was a case of s|xintaneous combustion,as
it is well kuown a pile of rags will
spontaneously combust tinder such circumstances.
Not a Democrat.?All tho Democratic
papers have been claiming the member
elected to the House of Delegates from
Morgan county ns u Domocrat. The
claim is contradicted by the following
card, which we clip from the Berkeley
Union:

Lewisbdimi, W. Vo., Nov. 30, '70.
To the Editor of tfu WhttUng InU\Hqencrr.
In your issue of the 23d instant, in an
article under the caption or "Democratic
Reign?How it Begins in Greenbrier," in
addition to your lalsc statements with
reference U> tin; cliargu u|x>u which certain
of) the lUi/iiiJkd mimliersyj the Board
of Suiiervisora of Greehbrler'county wero
arrested and imprisoned upon warrants
issued by United States Commissioner
Sperry, you charge that "on tho 2d and
8th insts, gross insults were offered by the
crowd present, whenever the Board made
any ruling that displeased them; that
after an adjournment on tbe 8th instant,
an assault" was made otrDr. J. F: Caldwell,
one of the Supervisors, an old man of
near seventy, and that ho was beaten
over the head with a dab, the crowd crying
out "Hit him again ! hit him again 1"
and that this occurred in the (iresunco of
a number of the special police appointed
to preserve order In the town, and they
used no effort to prevent it."
Being one of quite a number of Uio citizens
of Lewlsburg who have volunteered
to perform police duty, with a view to tho
preservation of good or^er in our town,
and being present at tho time tho assault
was made on Dr. Caldwell, I arrested the
blows which a drunken man, quite as old
its the Uoctur, was awkwardly attempting
to place on this pld sinner s cranlam,
and thereby prevented Ills "knot" from
receiving several blows?none of which,
however, would have done him an iqjtuy,
)uul lie rtcaced them. I, therefore, unhesitatingly
pronounce this, with tho other
charges contained in your article, as falso
as are tho affidavits which you claim
were "presented to the authorities at
Charleston, setting forth the facts (?) attending
these difficulties," and thpy are
as falsa as the individuals whose names
are subscribed thereto are meanly dtnigninu
la replying thus to your falsehoods I
am prepared tosnstaln myscll by the testimony
of reapcctable ixiraons, who wero
present during the meeting of the Board
of Supervisors, and also at the time the
assault was made on your pet.

DR 8CIIENCK ADVISES CON
SUMPTIVES TO 00 10 FLORIDA IN
WINTER.
Having for the last thirty-five years devoted
my whole time and attention to the study of lung
diseases and consumption, I feel that I understand
folly the course that ought to be pursued to
restore a tolerably bad case or diseased lungs to
healthy soundness. The first and most important
step is for the patient to avoid taking oold,
and the beat of all places on thia continent for
this purpose in winter, is Florida, well down In
the State, whero the temperature is regular, and
uot subject to such variations as in more Northern
latitudes. Palatka is a point I can recommend.
A good hotel is kept there by Petertnan.
Last winter I saw several persons there whose
lungs had been badly diseased, but who, under
tbeliealing influence of the climate and my medIcinea.
were getting well.
One hundred wilts further down the rirer is a
KInt which I would prefer to Palatka, aa the
nperature is more even and the air dry and
bracing. Mellonville and Enterprise are located
" * -w?u liiuilil^ nmruninM l*
Mellonvllle. It Is tiro miles from river or lake,
and it seems almost impossible to take cold
itblto. < The tables in Florida might l>e better,
and patients complain at times, but that in a good
| sign, as it Indicates a return or appetite, and
when this is tbe case they general! y increase in
; flesh, and then tbe lungs must heal.
Jacksonville, Hlbenua, Green Cove, and many
, other places In various parts of Florida, can be
safely recommended to consumptives in winter.
My reasons far saying so are that patients ore
less liable to take cold the/e than where there is
I a less even temperature, and it is not necessary
I to say that where a consumptive person exposes
hlmpelf- to frequent colds he is certain to die
shortly. Therefore my advice in, go well down
| into tbe St4te out of the reach of prevailing east
winds and fogs. Jacksonville, or almost any
otbfr of the localities I have named, will benefit
those who are troubled with a torpid liver, a disordered
stomach, deranged bowels, soro throat
or congh, but for those whose lungs aro diseased
a more southern polut is earnestly recommended.
For fifteen years prior to 1809, I was professionally
in New yorl^.JJoston, Baltimore and
Philadelphia, every week, where I saw and exI
amined on an' avriraga five hundred patients a
week. A practice so extensive, embracing every
Dosslblq phase of lung disease, has enabled me
!1o understand the disease tally and hence, my
caution in regard to taking cold. A person may
take vast quantities of ''Schenck's Pulmonic
Syrup, Seaweed Tonic andVandnkc Pills," and
yet die if he does not avoid taking cold.
In Florida, nearly everybody is using Schcnck's
Mandrake Pills, for.the climate is more likely to
produce billions habits than more uorthern latitudes.
It is a well established fact that natives
j of Florida rarely die of consumption, especially
1 tho*e or the southern part. On tbe other hand,
| in New England, one-third, at least, or the population,
die of this terrible disease. In the Middle
States it does not prevail so largely, etill
there are many thousands of cases there, what
a vast pdrtontage of lite would be saved if consumptives
were as easily alarmed in regard to
taking fresh cold as they arc about scarlet fever,
sraoll pox, Ac. But they are not. They take
! what tney term a little cold, which tbey arecred|
ulons enough to believo will wear on in a few
days. They pay no attention to It, and hence it
I lays the foundation for another and another still,
; until the lunge are diseased beyond all hope for
icare.
I My advice to persons whose lungs are affected
! even slightly is, to lay in a stock or Schenck's
Pclmonic Syrup, Schenck's Seaweed Tonic ami
i Schenck's Mandrake Pills and go to Florida. I
, recommend these particular medicines because I
am thoroughly acquainted with their actlou, I
1 xnow that where they are u*ed In strict accordance
witn my directions they will do the work
that is required. This accomplished, nature will
I do the rest. The physician who prescribes for
cold, cough or nightsweat* and then advices the
I patlentto walk or ride out every day, will be suru
to have a corpse on his hands before long.
My plan is to give .my three mcdiclues, in acIcordanco
with the printed.directions, except in
I some cases where a freer nse of the Mandrake
Pills is necessary. My object is to. give tone to
tbe stomach?to get up a good appetite. It is
i always a good sign when s patient begins to
grow hungry. I have hopes of such, with a
! relish for food and the gratification of that relish
comes good blood and with it more flesh, which
is closely followed by a healing of tbe Jungs.
Then the cough loosens and abatis, the creeping
1 chills and clammy night-sweats no longer prostrate
and aunoy, andthe patient gets well, provided
he avoids taking cold.
Now there are many consumptives who have
not the means to go to Florida. The question
may be asked, is there no hope for such T Certainly
there is. My advice to such Is; and ever
has been, to stay in a warm room during the winter
with a temperature of about seventy degrees,
which should be kept regularly at that point, by
means of a thermometer. Let such a patient
take hit exercise within the limits ol the room by
walking up and down as much as his sfrength
I will permit In ordur to keep' up a healthy circulation
of the blood. I.have cured thousands by
this system, and can do so again. Consumption
is as easily cured as-asy other disease if it id
taken in time, and the proper kind ol treatment
is pursued.- The' fact- stands undisputed on record
that Schenck's Pulmonic Syrup, Mandrake
I Pills, and Seaweed Tonic have cured very many
or what interned to be hopeless cases or consumption.
(Jo where you will, you will bo almost certain
to find some poor consumptive who has boon
rescued from tho laws of death by their use.
So for as the Mandrake Pills are concerned,
everybody should keep a supply of them on
hand. .They act on the liver better than calomel,
and leave none or its hurtful effects behind. In
fact they are excellent In all cases where a pnrgative
medicine is required. If you have partaken
too freelv of fruit and diarrhea ensues, a
dose or the mandrake* will cure yon. If yon
are tubject to Rick headache, take a done or the
Mandrakes and they will reliove yon in two
hours. If yotx would obviate the effect of a
change or water, or the too freqnent indulgence
4n fhut. take one Tor the Mandrakes every night
or every'ivthcr night, and yon may then drink
water and cat watermelons, pears, apples, plums,
peaches or corn, without the risk or being made
sick by them. They will protect thosowhollvo
in damp situations against chills and fevers. Try
them. They areperfectly hannloaa. They can
do yon good only.
1 have abandoned my professional visit* to
Boston and New York, but continue to see patients
at my office, No. 13 N. SIXTH Street, Phil*
udelphla, every Saturday from 0 a. m to,31>, u.
Thoso who wish a thorough examination with
the liespirometer will be chtrgcd five dollars.
The liespirometer declares the exact condition of
the longs, and patients can readily learn whether
they are cucablo or not. But I ilcairn it distinct*
ly understood that the value of mv medicine de:
pends entirely npon their being taken strictly according
to directions
Iu conclusion, I will say that when persons
take my medicines and their systems are brought
Into a heilthy condition thcrcoy* they are not so
liable to take cold, yet no one with diseased
lungs can bear a auddon chance of atmosphere
without the liability bf greater or less irritation
of the bronchial tubes.
