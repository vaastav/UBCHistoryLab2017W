WAR INEVITABLE!
Such i the heading of the dispatches
yesterday in reference to the Cuba difficulty.
We give elsewhere the terms of the accom
modation agreed upon between the Spanish
government ana Secretary Fish. The first
step in that agreemont is the surrender of the
Virginius to the United States. The Spanish
authorities in Cuba refuse to execute the
order of the Madrid government to that effect
Captain General Jovellar indignantly resigns
rather than execute the order, and holer, the
Colonial Minister, also resigns.
The Cuban Spaniards say they would not
object to the temporary delivery of the Vir
ginia to some other foreign power, 1 ranee
or England, for instance, but not to America
they M ill die first in the last ditch !
The government at Washington is exceed
ingly puzzled.' It is possible a temporary
arrangement may .bo fixed up to waive the
delivery of the Virginius to the U. S. by sub
stitutiug some other power, but it is doubled
whether congress will sanction such shiifll
ng.
It looks as if the only course left for our
government is to ignore Madrid and deal
with Cuba direct.
Congress.
Congress met on Monday and the House
organized by re-electing the old officers
Maine for speaker, Ordway for doorkeeper,
Ac. The democrats cast their votes fur Fer
nando Wood for speaker, except 2 for Cox and
one forA.. If. Stephens. In the senate Vice
President Wilson occupied the thalr, appar
ently in excellent health. The first day was
"pent in organizing, and the second in reading
Tie Message
While we should have been inexcusable
lor omitting to publish President Grant's
message, and while everybody ought to read
it, thero is no doubt that its length is greater
than thero was any need of, and that upon
the whole it will prove very dry reading. The
President "touches upon" a great many im
portant subjie's, but just when you come to
the interesting point where you want to
know what wise course he has to recommend,
you are baffled by the naicc statement that ' I
have not reflected enough on this subject to
make any positive recommendation, but your
attention is invited to it."
The matter of most immediate interest, o
course, is, what Uie President has to say
about tho Cuba question. It any one expects
in his utterances on that subject even a mod
icum of the ring of Gen. Jackson under like
circumstances, he will be sadly disappointed.
The President deplores what he is pleased to
call the sad condition of Cuba in consequence
of the existence of slavery there, and the help
lessness of Spain in consequence, and then
details how he and Secretary Fish and the
!Manisb minister Polo have succeeded in
temporary patching up the Virginius dilll
culty. If anything serious is to grow out of
it hereafter, he prefers to let congress shoul
der the responsibility.
In references to the next important qucs
tinn, the national finances, the President is
even more wordy and non-committal. Wheth-,
er he is in favor of contraction or inflation
of the currency to help us out of tho present
lifllculty no one can tell from what he says,!
though he seems decided in the opinion that,
our currency needs greater elasticity, and
that the true way to attain thai elasticity is to
return to specie payment.
On the subject of cheap transportation, the
President seems anxious to rid himself of the
mutter and leave it in the hands of the senate

Thursday a large number of bills were intro
dueed. but us speaker lllaiue refuses to an
r.otincc the standing committees no business
'an be done, and after a short session on
Thursdiiv. both houses adjourned over to
Monday.
Anions the innumerable bills introduced
in both houses are at leant half ii dozen to re
peal the back salary grab, three or four (one
by Senator Logan) to repeal the bankrupt
law and others to modify it, and not less than
twenty five to regulate the finances, to issue
more greenbacks, abolish the national banks,
establish free banking, fie, A;c., and also
bills to recognize Cuba belligerency, to build
national canal, railroads and so on.
It is understood that the republican cau
cus, after a fierce contest, has agreed on a
bill to repeal the salary grab except as to
President Grant and the supreme judges.
After Grunt's term expires, however, the
president also goes back to the old salary.
President Grant, on Thursday, sent to the
vnate the nomination of Attorney General
Williams as Chief Justice of the I'. S., to fill
the vacancy caused by the death of S. P.
Chase. The nomination, it seems, dot s not
give general satisfaction. Mr. Williams is
not regarded as qualified for the place, hav
iug sprung but lately from obscurity, and
never having exhibited anv of those legal
attainments necessary for such a position.
Geo. If. Williams is a native o New York,
born in I !?,:!, but at an early age follow ed Mr.
Greeley's advice and went wist, where he
irrew up with the country. He first settled in
Wisconsin, where he became a local judge.
J 'resident Pierce appointed him chief justice
d Oregon, and Iluehanan retained him in the
place. 1'p to fhis time he had been a
thorough democrat, an enthusiastic admirer
of Judge Taney, and regarded the Pred Scott
decision as the acme of judicial wisdom,
iiut when the rebellion broke out he became
a patriot joined the republicans, got into the
1'nit-d States Senate iind thence into the cabi
net, from which he now mounts to the sent
made ii'ii-trious by the names of Maishall,
Taney and Chase. Few politicians have
njoyc 1 n better streak of luck.
Th- IV:;:i-ylvHiiia Steel Association have
held a meeting and agreed to ask Congress
for an advance of some per ton in the tar.
if!' on pig iron. Not that they arc troubled
with foreign competition, but if they should
put up tlieir present price higher foreign com
petition might bother them. The pig iron
:nen don't complain that it cost, more to
make iron now than two years ago, mnl they
.vlmit that the business has been profitable ;
but thev say they have met with heavy Ios,c,
if late by the bursting of the Jay Cooke and
Tom Scott railroad bubbles, ami they want
to make up their losses by a general levy on
'he people.
Th re is a good deal of f ault found with
.ludr- Craig, f ihc Supreme Court, by many
papers that earnestly supported his election,
because, in spite nf his denial while u candi
'ate that he carried free passes on man- of

Clair flats and the Illinois and Mississppi

Is the President in favor of repealing the
salary steal ? The subject is very remotely
alluded to in his recommendation of such
a constitutional amendment that the Presi
deut can hereafter vote u part of the bill,
without killing the whole of it.
Is he in favor of lrce hanking? "it is a
question for the consideration of congress,"
he telis us.
What about the extensiou of our dilapidat
ed American commerce? He thinks an ex
ploration up the Amazon might open new
fields in that department of enterprise.
How about the tariff? He thinks the tariff
laws should be so codified that the common
people can understand them, und that con
gress must decide whether or not the tax
ought to be restored on tea and coffee.
In regard to war or navy matters, the re-
ports of the heads of these departments are
simply referred to The Postmaster General's
recommendation of a system of postal savings-banks
is dryly endorsed, but his postal
telegraph scheme is apparently given the
cold shoulder.
"With "brief mentions" of a dozen of other
subjects, iu regard to which no new informa
tion is imparted or action suggested, the
President closes wiih the curious recommen
dation that residences be erected at Washing,
ton for each cabinet officer, und that the states
be invited to erect in the same city residences
for their senators! We submit that the
recommendation is incomplete without also
including barracks or common hoarding'
houses for the representatives. Such estab
lishments ought to be placed under military
surveillance, so as to protect the members
perfectly from all contact with the abomina
ble lobby.
The Oughton Trial
While the report we gave last week of the
evidence and incidents connected w ith the
trial of George Oughton before our Circuit
court f..r murder has been commended
by both sides for its fairness and entire accur
acy, our reporter, in the necessity he was un-
ler of condensing as much as possible, had
ess opportunity thnn perhaps desirable for
ringing out many of tho.se dramatic fleets
which added so much to the interest of the
trial ill the eyes of the spe( tutors. The pres
ence of the families of" both the murdered
man and the man on trial, the ability of the
attorneys engaged and the intense fee in?
which they manifested ill the conduct of the
trial, and the strong Icidinir i.rn find en
among the witnesses an. audience, all
were accessories to fill the trial with count
less incidents of gr id dramatic force.
Mr. Oughton n-maincd in Ottawa but k
day a two after the trial, and on Monday
started with hi, family back to hi, ,M home
in Lnglan I.
In connection win, this trial we notice ti
despatch in the Chicago 77, 7, .., of Saturday
which is in "tic important p-irticular. im-or

AWFUL CALAMITY AT SEA!
Out on the broad Ocean, 500 miles from the
nearest laud, at two o'clock, of n clear Htar
light morning November 2'Jd the splendid
French steamship Ville du Havre, with J13
precious human lives on board, was struck
amidships by a miserable frigate, the Loch
Erne, and in 12 minutes sank to the hott:n
of the sea. Only 87 of the 313 were save!,
and most of these by the boats of the Lah
Erne, which after sailing a mile beyond
sinking steamer bethought itself to turn ana
see what damage was done, and thus was able
to pick up the waifs clinging to floatiug frig.
ments ol the once proud steamer.
The Ville du Havre was, with theseqifhy.i
of the Great Eastern, the largest feamff that
ever crossed the Atlantic. She was 430 feet
long and 48 feet in breadtlL Her carryin
capacity was 3,fiOO tons, and her engines were
of 3,200 horse powower. Her main saloon
was fitted up with marble wainscotting of
three varieties, her upholstery was in silk
velvet, and her woodwork carved in the most
unique designs.
Among the saved were the captain, mate
and 51 of the crew, so that of 200 passengers
on board less than 35 wcie saved. Among the
passengers were halt a dozen of European
delegates to the Evangelical Alliance, among
whom we are most happy to note as in the
list of the saved the ucv. Mr. Lorriaux,
brother of Mr. Lorriaux of this city,
and who visited his brother here
a few weeks ago and preached here. There
were also among the passengers from Chicago
Mrs. I), (food win and two children, Master
Willie I). Culver, son of Ii. F. Culver, and
Mrs. II. O. Spafford, threechildren and nurse.
Of all these the name of Mrs. Spafford alone
appears in the list of the saved.
"It w as nobody's fault." It was, as we (-aid,
two o'clock in the morning. The passengers
were all asleep; the captain had been on deck
but a few minutes before the accident, and,
so far as any one knows, each watcher w as at
his post, iet it does seem that (he ocean'
STEALING EAILBOADs.
The science ol building and gobbling rail
roads without money litis made immense
progress iu the west in the last twenty years.
In 18"l-2-3 and along, w hen the Rock Island
and some other Illinois roads were built, it
was deemed a sharp tiling to have the towns
along the line of the road raise money enough
by private subscription or by voting town
bonds to grade and tie the road, and then to
pay some heavy eastern capitalist double
price In stock to iron and equip it. Thus the
jnotiey was raised to grade and tie the Rock
Island road, and then the contract let to
Henry Farnam at, we believe $32,000 a mile,
then about double price to build and equip it,
the contractor agreeing to take all Uie rest of
his pay in stock. Mr. Farnam, after advanc
ing the money to build the road, sold his
stock ut from 50 to 75 cts. on the dollar and
made a good thing of it, while such towns or
private subscribers as could hold on to their
stock long enough, nearly got back Its first
cost
Wouldn't a modern credit tnobiher railroad
contracter shake his sides to hear Henry
Farnam boast of the sharp dodge by which
he made a modest little fortune building the
Rock island road? Some idea of the extent
of the innocence and simplicity of the Farn
urns and Litchfields of those days may bi
formed from a brief contemplation of the
facts recently brought to the surface before
Judge Tipton of the McLean circuit court,
in a suit involving the construction of the
Oilman, Springfield and Clinton railroad.
The facts connected w ith that road are vo
precisely like those involved in the construc
tion of the Fox Hiver Valley road that we
briefly rehearse them as a matter of local
interest. The road is about 100 miles long,
extending from Oilman, Iroquois county, via
Clinton, DeWitt county, on a bee Ijnc to
Springfield. Towus anil individuals along
the line of the road subscribed about $i!00,
000 stock towards building the road. The
company consisted of eleven directors, prob-

The democratic congressional caucus last
Saturday evening did all in their power to
justify the Chicago Tiw iu designating the
party as the "rotten reminiscence." It has
been the custom from time immemorial for
the minority in the lower house of congress
at the biennially recurring election of Speak
er, to compliment one of their number with
their vote for that office. When the caucus
met lsst Saturday evening to select the can
didate for this h nor, a preliminary resolu
tion was olfered by Mr. llolman, of Indiana,
to exclude from the list members daubed
with the credit mobilicr or back pay pitch.
This raised a tremendous row. The back pay
grabbers could see no justice in punishing
them for an act for which the republican par
ty as the majority alone should be held respon
sible. A vote was taken and Fernando Wood,
a back pay grabber, received 30 votes, Hob
inson, a ditto, IS votes, and Cox of New
York, who had rejected the back
pay, 20 voles. Then Cox and llolman
left the caucus in disgust, and the compli
mentary nomination was given to Wood.'
It is the curse of the domocratie party that
its representatives in congress participated
in ol! the bad legislation of the last session,
showing themselves as big thieves as the rad
icals, when by determined opposition they
could have defeated so lie of the most Iniqui
tous steals; and now that the voice of the peo
ple has si signally condemned these iniqui
ties, they still have the effrontery to adhere
to their folly. Whether the democratic par
ty shall survive or not may be debated, but
that it can survive and retain such leaders is
not debatable a minute.
con
tract to build the- road to ,i Philadelithi.i
company known as the "Morgan Improve
ment company," the director themselves, or
a portion of them, being let Into flic company
s partners in the job. The price was ns
follows: $d,000 per mile in local subscrip
tions (equal to cash;) $23,00) per mile in ten
per cent, bonds of the company ; and 114,000
per mile in the company's stock, or about
f 4-1,000 per mile. The contractors were to
have the privilege of loosing the road, when
done, for !!) yesrs'o the Pennsylvania Central
railroad company, und an additional mort
gage on the road bf $10,000 a mile, or $1,000,-
000, was given to- Vom Scott, or the Pa. Cent
ral, for equipping the road. There was also
in the contrsct a side agreement with the
Vermillion no, we mean the I Sure lay coal
company, owned by the directors, by which
the railroad was bound to purchase all its
coal of them and carry their coal nt special
ates. As in the case of the Fox Hiver Valley
the money to build thej road was really
advanced by the C. B. & Q , so in this case
all the money was advanced by the Pennsyl
vania Central, except the local ..subscriptions.
When the road was finished, in this as in the
other case, the lease was made to (he big
monopoly for 90 years, and all the stock and
mortages turned over to it in such a way that
the Pa. Central, or Tom Scott, could any day
shut down on the mortgage and thus kick out
all the local stockholders.
In the case of the Oilman road, the local
stockholders resisted the robbery by com
mencing a suit before Judge Tipton, and on
the above facts being made toappear Judge
T. decided substantially as follows :
1. That under the law of Illinois, railw ays
are highways, and the directors are simply
trustees charged with the faithful and honest
management of them.
2. That if the directors mismanage their
trust by making fraudulent contracts or by
misapplying the property or earnings of the
road, they may be divested of their truvt and
a receiver appointed to act under and report
to the court.

EICHAED YATES.
Yesterday witnessed the funeral obsequies
of the Hon. Richard Yates. Thou.-unds of
citizens came out, though but a small portion
cou'd gain entrance to Strawn's Opera House,
where the exercises were held. An appropri
ate discourse was preached by Kev. A. S. Mc
Coy, pastor of the Methodist church. Of that
church, some 23 years ago, Yates was for tw o
years a member. After the discourse Gov.
Beyeridge, who was present, spoke a few a p.
propriato words of eulogy on the deceased's
record as War Governor of Illinois. "This;
he said, "is the brightest period of all his
history. He sent over one hundred regiments
to the front; he visited and cared for the
poor soldier. He defied treason, nud brought
our state up to the front to protect the old
flag. Whatever you may say of Governor
Yates, he was true to his country, to the flag,
and to the soldiers in the field."
There is no disposition to cover up the sad
fall from virtue, purity and manhood in the
case of poor Dick. But I have been plea.scd
to hear many of the best citizens say in mlti
gat ion in his case: "His father and bis
grandfather w ere so before him." "He inher
ited his disposition and proclivities."
In his humanity, his sympathy with suffer
ing, his genuine human love, lay not a little
of his power over men.
In hm day he has done some splendid
things, and his name goes Into permanent
history. But if he had conserved himself; if
he had well used his sacred endowment of
sympathy and genius, how much greater
had been his real value, and how far shining
his lustrous name. His vices were constitu
tional, vices of appetite and lust, inhering
in the physical organism rather than vices of
the mind, such as avarice, envy, jealousy. Xo
"back salary grab" er Union Pacific thefts
are charged upon him. A man may have de
fects, but the studied and cultured vices of:
his nature the nobler and better part of it
degrade him most.
It is samcthin ' . , 1hi, ju Ui
o -v -
day, that he is not charged with public rob
bery in the way of salary taking or congress
ional appropriations, that he might live in
greater ease and luxury
Drunkenness nnd bea.siiahty are crimes
great enough, and they appear greater or
worse as when lifted so high in society
that their glare and hideous leer are seen
from places of power and trust, and eminent,
God-given faculties, in vantage ground trod
den by a few only. But frauds or thefts in
excessive taxation, in railroad grants for in
dividual emolument are the results not of
passionate impulse, but of deliberative and
Cultured meanness and selfishness; the study
of depravity, the ingenious devisings of de
termined and purposed villainy.
Yates is gone. "Pool fellow," sighs his
friend. "What a life-long conflict, what cruel
and protracted battle, what humiliating, in
glorious defeats, what years of shame."
Ought there not to be some help for man
against himself? Over his place of sepulture
pity and love will drop many a tear.

THE CUBA TROUBLE.
Tho President's Message confirms the re
ports previously received, that a protocol had
been signed between Secretary Fish nnd the
Spanish Minister at Washington, by which a
basis had been agreed upon for the settlement
of the difficulty arising out of the capture of
the Virginius and the murder of a portion of
her passengers. That agreement is substan
tially: The immediate delivery of the Yir
giniiis to the V. S. with all her surviving pas
sengers and crew ; a salute to our Hag on the
21th of December, unless in the meantime
Spain shall satisfy the I'nited States that the
American Hag was improperly borne by that
vessel, and, further, that she had no right to
the American Hag or American papers; if
Spain so satisfies 'lie C. S., then the I'. S.
shall institute proceedings against the vessel
and the surviving parties for violating the
laws of the P. S. ; if not, then Spain is to in
stitute proceedings and bring to punishment
(Jen. Burriel and those concerned in the San
tiago outrage; and lastly, the matter of dam
ages to be left for future consideration.
The weak point of the agreement is here:
suppose the Virginius is shown to have been
regular in all respects and entitled to the
protection of this government, is the author
ity of Spain suillcienily respected in Cuba to
enable her to have the Santiago murderers
tried and brought to punishment ? Lvery
hody knows that with the feeling now in Cu
ba such a trial would be a farce. In short,
it is notorious that the authority of Castelar
