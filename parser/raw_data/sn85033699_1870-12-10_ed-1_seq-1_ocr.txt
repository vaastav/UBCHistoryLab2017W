WASHINGTON.
Hott Grant Lotm Porter.
Nek Toss, Dec 9. The Tribune's
"Washington correspondent telegraphed
last night as follows:
It is reported here to-night that the
President and Admiral Porter have been
reconciled, and that Gen. Sherman has
been acting as peace maker. It is argued
by Admiral Porter's friends that, as Gen.
Sherman was promoted before the rank of
General of the Armj was abolished, so
Admiral Porter should be allowed to suc
ceed to the office made vacant by the
c death of Farragut, before action is taken
on Gen. login's joint resolution.
Much curiosity has been evinced in re
gard to the original manuscript of Por
ter's letter to Welles. It is now on file in
the Navy Department, but it is asserted it
has been recently put there. It is marked,

Gov Wo.lItr on tuo AdmlaJatstlon.
Gov. Walker, of Virginia, in his annual
.messago of yesterday, shows the way in
which Grant sends Federal troops over
the South, and pays his respects to him as
V!ollow :
"I fori bound to say that, in view of
dl the circumstances, the sudden with
drawal of thtso troop while in the midst
of the performance of tho delicate duty to
vrhica thayhod been aligned of sustain
ing the civil authorities in Norfolk county
ia removing negro squatters, in accord
ance with an order from the President
himself, without any notification to, or
consultation with me, endangering, as it
did, the lives of our-efllccrs and citizens
and the peace of the community, was, in
iny opinion, an act of official discourtesy,
and a manifestation of an indifference to
possible consequences, of ths gravest
character, without a parallel in ths his
tory of the country. If tha original order
for the assignment of Federal troops to
this duty were right, then its revocation,
under the circumstances, was an inexcus-
able wrong."
Work of tho Court of Ctultnt.
From tbe annual statement transmitted
to Congress it appears that the Court of
Claims during tho year ending Dec. 5,
1870, rendered judgment in 1G4 cases.
The aggregate amount claimed by the par-
ties bringing these suits against the United
States was about $3,1(00,000. The total
amount awarded was $931,387 all in
favor of the claimants, except in one
case where suit was brought against the
United States for damages to tho amount
of $100,500, resulting from an alleged
violation of a contract by the military au
thorities in Virginia. The govern
mcnt ect up a counterclaim

was awarded $1,649. The largest
claim was for the amount of $73f,04-t,
and interests from March, 1805, for the
net proceeds of some 4,000 boxes of to
bacco converted and destroyed by the ar
mies of the United Slates during the late
war. This suit was dlsrnifsed, but, like
most of tho others so decided, has leen
appealed to the Supreme Court Among
the awards is one of $58,000 in favor of
tho Rothschild Brothers for the net pro
ceeds of 180 hogsheads of tobacco cap
tured by the United States military forces
in Richmond, and mid by the Treasury
under stipulation. The total amount of
the judgments against the United States
in tue suits brought for the recovery of
the proceeds of captured cotton and su
gar is, in round numbers, $295,000.
Distiller Decision.
The Acting Commissioner of Internal
Revenue has decided, in reply to a letter
frcm tho Assessor, of the First district
of Illinois, that no objection is seen to
the use of water through closed pipes
into the refining or purifying tubes, for
ths nurnoso of refining spirits while in
the process of continued distilla'ion; but
the arrangements for introducing it into
thn tubes, however, must be so con
structed as to preclude the possibility of
obstructing the spirits lrom unrtuues, or
f thereby introducing any Other material
than water into the spirits. With this
view the nines should be constructed
with a stopcock controlling the flow of

Cuban Patriots and Cuban Plunder
ers. New Yoek, Dec. 9. Senor Domingod
Rinz jointly accused with Gen. Thos.tj
Jordan of violating ths neutrality laws,
will surrender himself at the United States
Circuit Court before Judge Woodruff for
the purpose of furnishing bail to appear
at the February term of that court to
answer the indictments which have been
found against him. It is said the dis
closures of evidence in the case, will de
velop tho fact that a bitter quarrel exists
among the Cuban leaders in this city, and.
that several of them are engaged in col
lecting money for tbr own use under the
pretense of using it for the Cuban cause.
It is reported that a number of wealthy
Cbban leaders in this .city sold their
jewelry in order to provide money te carry
on the war against Spain, and that the
proceeds fell into the hands of adventur
ers who converted it to their own use.

A motion wa3 made to reconsider the
action of yesterday in regard to internal
trade, and a resolution was passed in
structing the Executive Board to continue
its efforts for the removal of all restric
tions on internal trade and the abroga
tion of such local laws as interfere with
the general system of free trade.
Mr. Shyrock, of St. Louie, offered a
preamble and resolution to the effect that
as the Legislatures f the several States
would soon hold their annual sessions, it
wa3 important that they be apprised at
once of the action of the National Board
in regard to State and municipal taxation
levied on non-resident traders, and that
the Secretary be Directed to forward to
the State Legislatures, and to tho Boards
of Trado and Chambers of. Commerce

on this question was ably conducted by

Tbe I'nbllcCands.
A long discussion followed on a pro
position from the Newark Board of
Trade discountenancing tho granting of
the public lands to railroads and ether
corporations.
A substitute was offered in favor of
such grants in special cases under strin
gent restrictions, but this failed to receive
a two-thirds vote on its naal passage, ana
was therefore, lost.
Tlio Tarif r, etc.
Several propositions relating to the
tariff were postponed by a vote of 32 to

A resolution was adopted looking to
the securing of uniformity in appraisal of

The Customhouse Frauds Trial ot
Perry Fuller.
New York, Dec. 9. A correspondent
writes from New Orleans on the 2d, that
on that lnoininff. in the United States
Court, Judge Dwcrcll presiding, United
bta'es District Attorney, J ill. Beckwitfl,
called up the case of Percy Fuller, ex-
Collector of New Orleans, against whom
nineteen indictments had been found by
the grand jury for fraudulent entries of
sugar and coffee during his term of of
fice.
The civil cases wcie tried last year, re
sulting in every case in the verdict of con
fiscation against the consignees, August
E. Contourie & Co. The wholo amount
involved was some million of dollars.
Tho cases have sinco been compromised
in Washington by the payment of tho
duties, but the criminal charges against
Lthe officers of customs through whose ac
tive connivance tho frauds were perpe
trated, remained on the docket. The
United States Attorney endeavored to
bring these to an issue. The result is
seen. Perry Fuller was called twice on
his bond and failed to appear. His
sureties, Alexander M. McDonald, United
States Senator from Arkansas, and E. G.
Ross, United States Senator from Kansas,
were then called upon to bring the body of
Perry Fuller into court. They failed to
make answer. District Attorney Beck
with moved for an alias capias, stating
that the bonds were taken in Washington
and seemed te be very imperfect if not
worthless.
Tho Case of TVaddy Thompson.
Waddy Thompson, against whom in
dictments of similar character had been
found, was then called on his bail and
also failed to appear. District Attorney
Beckwith stated that the bond of the ac
cused had been stolen at Memphis.
Tnompson had been several times arrested
at Memphis, near which city he has a
magcilbent plantation, but ha3 always
been released by obliging courts on writs
of habeas corpus.
How Uncle Sam Compounds ivith
Crime.
The correspondent after firing one of
thirteen cases found against Perry Fuller
and associates, to illustrate the heinous
nature of the charges, says the prosecu
tions of these cases in the Circuit Courts,
cost the Govemment $100,000, and af
ter confiscation had been decided in every
case, a compromise has been effected by
the simple payment of the duties which
the party wa3 willing to pay from
the first. The main argument on trial
was that it was officers of the United
States Customhouse who were really
guilty offenders. They have been releised
on straw bail, or at least, upon informa
recognhanccs, and thus this much vaunt
ed vindication of the integrity of the
revenue law3 ends in a costly fizzle.
There is a mouse in the mealhouse some
where, and United States Senators to
gether with a distinguished Congressman
from Indiana, could probably give infor
mation on the subject.
THE HAPPY FAMILY.
A Lively Scene In the Radical Sena
torial Caucus.
Washixgton, Dec 8. It has been
stated by a Radical Senator that the
President had declared that it seemed to
him unfair that one of tho principal com
mittees of the Senate, that on foreign re
lations, should be so oig$nized as to be
against one of the most important ques
tions of the administration's foreign
policy. An attempt was made in the
RepubltDin caucus this morning to rci
model it by displacing Mr. Patterson and
appointing Mr. Conkling, as a strange
counter-irritant to 3Ir. Sumner s well-
known opposition to tbe San Dominszo
annexation scheme. Although Mr.
Conkling voted against it at the last ses
sion, it is said that he now supports tne
new plau of annexation proposed in the
message, and hence the contemplated
change. Mr. Sumner flared up at once
and very warmly denounced the proceed
ing as a censure on the past action of his
committee. Mr. Wilson took the same
view. The caucus committee said that
Mr. Patterson had been given the
chairmanship of the District Committee,
which was a compensation for the
change. Mr. Sumner did not agree to
tbat, Mr. Patterson, he said, desired to
remain with the Foreign Relations Com
mittee, and the change looked like an at
tempt to pack the committee in advance
in favor of San DomiDgo. The debate at
this point bocame very excited, Senators
Morton and Chandler stepping forward
and warmly defending the change. Mr.
Trumbull thought it was a small matter
to produce such an excited discussion,
and counseled moderation and harmony
between Republican beoators themselves
and with the administration. Mr. Wilson
said that Mr. Patterson felt aggrieved a.
the reported change, and desired to re
main, for personal ieason, on his .eld
committee, and he (Wilton) therefore
moved to recommit the subject to the
Caucus Committee, with instructions to
report the old Foreign Relations Commit
tee. Mr. Patterson here jumped up tnd
said he did not propose to take a single
crumb frcm the administration through
the hands of Mr. Chandler. Wilson's
motion was carried by two to one, and
subsequently the caucus reassembled, re
ceived the report, ratified it, and after
ward tho whole list of committees was
reported in open Senate and adopted.

thority of the Pope. Mr. Gladstone says
Her Majesty's government has not inter
fered with any changes in Rome since

to make, and has made provisions for ar

French mismanagement on the
Loire.
A correspondent telegraphs from Tours
on the 7th inst. that the Government
states tLat he army of the Loire is at its
old quarters, but the losality is not given.
Despair has seized Eome here and the
spirits of others have risen to meet the
desperate condition of affairs. The Gov
ernment declares that the reverses were
only of temporary importance. Many
railway trains loaded with cattle, sheep
and provisions, had been concentrated
near Orleans for the succor of Paris.
They were all saved. Most of the gun.s
taken by the Prussians were mounted
navals.
The evacuation of Orleans was caused
by the demoralization of some new
rreufh troonj and the mistaken stratecv
and indecision of Gen. D'Aurelles d Pal-
ladinca, who allowed two corps to be
overwhelmed by the whole Prnssian ar
my, although he had 200,000 men within
reach.
Official returns state that the aimy of
the Loire consisted of 300,000 men with
1,000 guns in the engagements of the 3d
and 4th. Only 00,000 French fought
against 150,000 Germans. The plan of
the Campaign was devised by Gambetta,
aided by Deuerre, a young officer of the
engineers, and was either not carried out
by Daurells, or the plan itselj wa3 fatally
erroneous.

A Valuable Invention.
We were shown yesterday a new self
rake, the invention of Wm. B. Wootton,
of Hopkinsville, Ky., that bids fair to take
the ptflce of all others in maike. It is at
tachable to any rear-cntting machine, and
is so situated that it prevents nil tendency
to side draff, as we wero assured by the in
ventor, that tha entire self-raking appara
tus will not exceed CO (sixty) pounds in
weight, when made strong and very dura
ble. It is tho only ruke in the market that
delivers tho gavel by a pare side delivery,
and it seems to ns surprising that a ma
chine so simple and yet effective, had not
long since been discovered. Mr. Wootton
has properly secured bis invention, and
we learn expects to go North at an early
day, to make arrangements for its manufacture.

TRADE OF ASIIVIEI.E.
Happy Diffusion of Buslncsi.
The vear that is just closing has been a
highly .prosperous one to Nashville, in
many ctner regards man tne gigantic
strides she has made, in tbe way of pub
lic and private improvement?, and tbe
opening and grading of streets. Business
in every department has flourished. In
the shape of manufactories and manufac
turing, the business has been enormous,
far surpassing that cf any previous year in
her history. This of itsell is an encour
aging and hopeful sign for tha future, into
which it requires no supernatural sagacity,
or prophetic ken to penetrate and seo the
time, when every articlo needed by the
husbandman and tha artisan in our own
Stats, and the vast back country tributaiy
to ns as a Southern rustropolis, and a focal
point of railroads, will be manufactured
and supplied at home. In this regard our
skies are emphatically brightening.
But it is more especially to our trade in
commercial ,and mercantile transactions, as
exhibited during the year, to which we de
signed to call attention. The aggregate
trade of Nashville, has been unprecedent
edly heavy. Larger stocks, and, perhaps,
more varied and better selected stocks of
goods were brought to the city by our mer
chants last spring, aud the earlier part of
the fall, than had ever been before. Tho
excellencies of the articles and their cheap
ness havo impressed country purchassrp,
who do business on moderate capital, to a
greater extent than ever before, of the im
portant fact that they can buy their stock
ss cheap in this market, taking the cost of
transportation, etc., into the account, as
they can anywhere north of a?, and that
they can receive them much more expedi
tiously. In tho mean time our wholesale
merchants havo been romuLerated for the
heavy outlays in purchasing extensive
stocks, to say nothing of the enhanced
reputation given to their business and
to tho city, M an improved basis fcr future
operations. Tho sales during the year have
been very large as a cursory glanco at the
Revenue Collector's books will indisputa
bly show. Thoy have had liberal custom
ers throughout the Statu, and their ex
panding lines of trado gone down through
Alabama, diverged to the Southwest and
tho Southeast, and penetrated to the sun
kissed shores of the Golf. The railroads,
our great and activo commercial nerves,
leading from this point into those regions,
have daily been burdened with the wares,
the merchandise and products of our city
and our dealers. Groceries and grains and
implements and farm ntondls have been
forwarded from hero in vest quantities.
Generally business men are satisfied thus
far with the year's business. Probably in
some instances, the sales of firms may not
have attained the magnitude they had rea
son to anticipate; yet in most cases trade
has been good and remunerative.
There is one fact in this con
nection that we regard as ono of
the most hopeful signs of the times.
It cannot have failed to have impressed
the must casual observer. That ia, that
whatever may be the transactions of old
established firms, increase a3 thoy may
and as they should, there is now more
business and a greater diversity of busi
ness carried on in Nashville than ever be
fore. In other words, there is a greater
diffusion of bnsinet s observable than at
any previous timo since wo wero a city,
and we confidently assert that thero are
more men doing business on their own
hook, and with their own means, than
there are in any other city of the sama
popnlation in the land. Herein lies the
.substratum of onr future commercial
prominence, and we note the fact as one
of the moat healthful business indications
of the year 1870. 5

THE GREAT PILLOW CASE.
Riddle, Coleman & Co. vs. Gid
eon J. Pillow-and Others.
The Chargo of Judge Emmons
Verdict for tho Plaintiff.
From the Memphis Appeal, Dec. a
The arguments of counsel ia the great
damage case of Riddle, Coleman & Co.
vs. Pillow et al, was concluded before
Judge Emmons in the United States Cir
cuit yesterday. In the afternoon the
Judge gave his charge to the jury.
JTJDOK BMMOSS' C7IARGE.
He said that in cases where the facts
have bscn much contested by opposing
counsel it was his habit to collate them.
The very signal ability displayed in the
conduct of this case left him vuy li tie to
say in the way of elucida ion. He should
forbear all reference to facts save in so
far as they may b8 necessary in showing
tho application of plain principles of law.
The first question they would try to
dispese of was did the plain iff own the
property in debate in such sense as to
authorize him to maintain this action.
The plaintiff, it is grantfd, owned prop
erty in coal and bargts. It is put in, in.
defense, that in April, "61, Packard, the
agent of the plaintiff, received ltttcrs or
telegrams authorizing him to sell this
property. Itjshould be borne ia rnlnd that
those instructions did not constitute a sale
or transfer of tho property.. There m
no proof ilia, any actual transfer of the
right in the property txk place in pursu
ance of those instructions. The gentle
men of the jury wouId?herefore, en
tirely d s.'a:d ibis part of the evidence, "f
and pass it over as ot no value in uettc
mining the question befoic them. It
appears that on the 28 ih of the ramie
monh, Packard received laaothcr let
ter which contained offers for coal, the
piy to be made by notes filing
due 4, 8 and 12 months after the pro
posed negotiation. It is said that the
telegram which the- plaintiff sent wia ih
icply to that letter, and not to the previous
communication. You will Lave to con
sider' whether that was a reply to tlu let
ter or communication of the 25th or 28!li.
I will give you no charge on that point);
that will be left wholly to your qm dis-
creti 13. The ibtcnsj set up tha'. if even
a liabd ty .:.3 rrattd on ih; part of the
deicmljuts for these goods, alleged to
have been seized, yet they iehl certain
acceptmccs agniuit plaintifTaiA tct-off
which r-ive them a lien on lhat property.
The Judge h Id tbat the fact of the lien,
if it were admitted, could have no in
fluence in the case, and resting the de
fense on that view aljnc it would be the
duty of the jury to award a vcidict to the
plaintiff. The next question they would
have to consider waj: Is there any proof
that the defendants havetaktn the prop
erty as alleged in the bill of c impkint. The
Court charges that if the defendant, Pil
low, ordered, either verbally or in writ
ing, and mat piaintitt was nounca ot ine
intended seizure, then the order so given
was of such effect that the plaintiff was
catitled to damages for trespass. The
actual nmovcl, or even the formal taking
of possession, waj not necessary to fSfc
validi'y cf an action fot trespiss. If a
sheriff levy on a span of horses in your
possession as being the property of a third
party, while they really belonged to you,
that i3 trespass. The fact of asserting
dominion over the property, when tbat
assertion is recognized as of power, con
stitutes ground for damages without any
removal or taking of formal possession.
If it shall appear plain that Murphy, one
of the defendants in the case, notified
tbe agent, Packard, cf tbe seizure,
that constitutes just grounds for
faction for trespiss. The fact of
Pillow being commander of the army,
and actinrr under instructions from the
authorities of the S'ate of Tennessee, 3s
set up in defense as a justification of tbe
transaction. The plea is not of value.
His brother judge, who had heard this
case argued before, held that such plea
was of no account as justification. He
saw no reason for departing from that
opinion. It i3 to be looked upon as one
citizen, without the color of law, appro
priaring the property of another.
THE EXTENT OF UEIXIGERE5T RIO UTS.
One of the learned c uasellois held, in
an able argument, that the belligerent
rights of the powers or forces arrayed
against each were equal. That argument
ha3 some color, but will not stand the
test of invrstigation. If the learned
counsel, who held that view, were
sitting aj a legislator, he would not
vote to make such a law. It Is held,
that when any people rise in re
volt, then the sovereign or po
litical power has the right to
confiscate the property and take
the life of the rebeL This is the belwg-
eient right nf tbe sovereign or political
power, rt equal ngnts be accordeor to
both parties, then the persons in revolt
have the right to confiscate the property
and take the lives of those who remain
attached to the sovereign or political pow
er. Such a proposition appears to be ab
surd. That view was never held by any
court. Neither i3 it true that the sover
eign power, in the event of rebellion, is
reduced to the alternative, on the one
hand, of confiscating the property of
those in revolt, and of slaying them to
shco. hanir and exterminate indiscrimin
ately and by wholesale or, on the other,
to allow perfect equality of belligerent
rights with the political power, which has
the discretion to say what measure of bel
ligerent rights it should allow those in
revolt. This is regulated by the necessities
of tho case. The United States Courts
have not laid down, as yet, any general
rule which would allow action for dam
ages against Generals who seized property
all over the country during the war. He
would bo slov? to charge for thcr plaintiff
in a cass where action for damages
should be brought against a General who,
in dire necessity and for the sole purpose
of feeding or affording shelter to his men,
had seizsd what was needed. However,
there are none of the United States
Caurts that have laid down any rule on
that point yet. A defense of tbat sort
cannot be set up in this case There is
no army in the field no dire necessity;
the General was not actually in the field.
The Judge then referred to cases de
cided in the Supreme Court of the State
as bearing upon tho question, and an
swered the objection of counsel made in
previous argument as to the authority of
tbe court, inasmuch as political disabili
ties were spoken of in connection there
with, that tbe decision of the Supreme
Court should be taken n of force. No
attention could be paid by him to hearsay
or newspapers reports. He must look
upon all defacto courts as couits da jure,
until the contrary bo proven. The Court
in question was certainly de facto the
Supremo Court of the State, and there
wa3 no reason to doubt their entire legal
ity. Another point of defer so offered
was that the military committea in this
city, after application to have the prjp
erty restored had been made, ccn'ented
that it should be restored to Packard if
he would give bond to the effect that the
proceeds of the property should be ap
propriated to the use of tha Confede
rate government- Now the fact that
tho property was seized being admitted,
then the restoration of some of it to
Packard due3 not authorize the jory to
abate any of the damages claimed for the
whole loss sustained by the seizure. Let
us illustrate: You are on your way home
and stop at an inn, your horccs are seized
on an execution issued aga'nst the land
lord of ihe inn, subsequently, when the
Sheriff finds out hi3 mistake, he hastens
to return tho horses to you, but on the
way one of them receives an injury and
is so restored to you. This "s not a rci
toration. It cannot bo said that the prop
erty that was received was returned, for
one of the horses at least, is eo the same,
and an action for damages for trespss3
couid be maintained. The plaintiffs are
not required to credit defendants with
any value, lave in to far as they may
have received money for some of Ihe
proceeds of tho property taken.
DAMAGES.
The question of damaces will occupy
your attention and that of tha interest in
conccciion therewith. The damages are
to bo the bate value of the property, and
in vour discretion, interest thereon. No
more delicate subject could Hie brought
unaer tne consiaeratton oi ttic tourtthan
that of interest I must say that it is the
general usage of juries, and you will
please to remark in connection with thi?.
that I do not charge you particularly on
this pointl lint it has been in myrvids ex
perience the rwtge of juries r.o: to allow
the whole interest, particulirly if the case
had'rnn on as long as'tbl?, iave in Ihe,
oharactcrof damigc3 for punity, or what
may more explicitly be called vindictive
damages. And the right to . claim
this sort of. damages is. based. ripen
the conduct of the defendant ard
the moiivc for the seizure. There are
three ways in which vindictive damages
may arise wantonness, malicious motive,
and when the alleged wrcng comes under
the characterise of an tutragtr. You
will more clearly understand tbe nature of
"wantonness" if you allow me to txpla'n
a little. A number of gsy: young fellows,
under the influence of champagne or other
more vulga- stnng tiiink, go about
knocking down signs, damaging fences,
and overturalug frail' buirdingi for what
is called "sport;" thi3i3 wantonness, and
a claim for vindictive damages might bo
set up. It is not the province of juiies to
sit on the moral conduct of defendants in
civil cases, or inflict punishment. Do not
mingle any collateral injury, which plain
tiff may have sustained in cmrequence of
theeeizure, with your deliberations. All
that is before you is tho dry amount of
the value of the coal and the barges. The
plaintiff may have lest $100,000, or gono
into DacKiuptcy. ai a result of tneseiznre.
That is n t for ycu to consider. If you
tnnK mat the defendant, Pillow, hsnestly
bexeved that lie was riehL and that he
did not act in vrantonness or mailer,' and
tnere was notuiog m his conduct
would iuitifvvoa In lookinir upon
the seizure as aa outragr, then you can
not alloy "vindictive dimsgrs." One
ofghs counsel claims those damages on
tuc ground lint tae act was an outrage.
It i3 necessary for vou to be wpII infoim-
cd as to- the essentia! characteristics of
an outrage Everything1 commonly all
ed outrageous could not so be considered
in law. If a man conscientiously b5
lieves he 13 right in doing' a thing, then
mat act cannot be called aa outrage, ate
jjioimons, ror instance, migut conscien
tiously tight for the niainteninca or
spread of their principles. Such a thing,
no ilonb', would violate our seost of-pro-pricty
and right, ami won'd lcok
outrageous; but when wc corns to
find out that these men were acting from
con:cientious convictions, then their ac
tions could not be catted outragoou?. He
nad been brought up m a school himielf
which taught the necessity of Etrong
governments, and hii own convictions
rau in f''Vo thereof, yet having come
down here vld mingled among thcrpcople"
who were cummonly accused in other
sections of having hstu guilty of an out
rage, her fclt-ccrtsin- lhat hundreds of
thousands of litem hsiDacted from co
viciioq3 tif-rigirt. TneSfc does cot appear
any proof to sh tain the charge that Gen.
Pillow was actuated by any other than
strong convictions of right- Yon cannot
give vindictive damages uolcsl you find
ma, tne manner 01 seizure was outraire-
ou, that the motives were malicious, or
mac iim act was done in mere wantonness.
Ia the case of" tha defendant, 3Iurphy,
yr u will have to exercise your best judg
ment. Ii appears tbat he was concerned
as au agent in the seizure of the coaL If
you fitd thst he had nothing to do with
the barges or boir, then you will have
cither to bring in a verdict against Pillow
and Murphy for the coal alone; or you
wui nave to nring m jour verdict agaioat
Pillow alone for ihe whole property. You
cannot connect Murphy in your verdict
witn tne seizure of property, with which
tbe testimony may show he had nothing
to do. If, tucrtfoie, you include Murphy
in your verdict, you can. only return fw-r
coal. If you return -for c al, barges and
bodt, you must exclude Murphy.

To the Editors ot the Unkra mj Americas :
Skunq Hrrx, Dec t, 1870. Oar people
are rejoicing in tha abundant yield s-f tho
past year, ineir granaries and barns are
full to overflowing, and truly it may bo
said, "the goose hangs high." The cool
weather has been favorable .tor slaughter
ing hogs, and largo numbers havo found
tceur way to tne smokehouses of the toun
try. While lha past U saf6f tho future is
equally so aa regards "hog and hominy"
to this favored regior.
The Enropeaa war or Something else
has so depiesssd your city fieaj that tha
great body cf our prodccers?tre dieinciinsd
to "force tha market!" doKn by sending
forward their surplus, and aj holding on
for a change i&pfiairs. In the meantime
the extraordinary weather f the fall and
winter so far has been taken; advantage of
by all classes to prepare for anoth year
and with reasoiiible seasonshe crops will
ba greater than any previous year since
the war. The colored "man and brother"
is doing well. Those who have been most
industrious and economical, and behaved
themselves, are in comfortable condition,
with a wholesome little sum of money to
boot, and assured employment for another
year. Those who have been idle and pro
fligate, who have nothing and no prospects
ahead, are pieparing to go to Nashvilia or
some other town or city and failing in
that, will pilfer in tho neighborhood, and
finally land in the Penitentiary, to learn a
trade and compete with the skilled white
men of the country. By the way, the next
time a proposition is made to" move the
Penitentiary, or build another, let 'em do
it. Lst it go to Massachusetts with tho
condition that ail the criminals go with it,
I cannot omit to mention one of the
most happy "occasions" that we haveliad
in this locality for many years. It was the
marriage of Mr. Wm. Cheairs and Miss
Mary ll Pointer, daughter of Sam. Poin
ter, Esq. The marriage took place at tho
rcsidecco of the brides father, and a re
ception was given at the residence of the
groom's father on Wednesday evening.
The "company comprised some of the fair
est daughters and gdlant sons of Giles,
Manry and Williamson, with a Bprinkling
of beanx from your city. The hospitality
of the host and hostess was entirely sump
tuous, and the good cheer woa accompa
nied with dancing, wit and humor of the
highest ordy. Ine ladies were dressed in,
tbe beauties of tha Litest fashions, which,
with their Iovelinees and intelligence,
mado the 6cone a very brilliant one, in
which the bride and groom shono re
splendent. If ycu had had a Jenkins hero
ho would have mentioned Misa P. of
Maury, and Misa P. of Giles, and Misses
6. of Maury and Miss B. of Maury as re
splendent, and a host of others, each and
all as bright particular stars, etc., etc.
But Jenkins wasn't present, and all that
can be said is that it wpa a magnificent af
fair. L It. E.
The McMinnvmeCytw Era of the Sth
inst. says: "On last Tuesday, as a ser
vant of Col. Donnell was driving his
team through the woods three miles west
of town, a huge bear made an attack up
on the horses, causing lhsm to run SJvay
and putting upon tie negro one of th
"biggest scares" possible his eyes were
all white. Deeming "discretion the bet
ter part of vator," the negro left the
neighborhood soon after the horses, and
made hi3 way to town, reporting his ad
venture. A party of yqucg men imme
diately started in pursuif, but ths bear
could nowhere be found. This is the
first bear tbat has made his appearance in
our neighborhood, exercising his own
will, in a great while."
Jail deliveries, or at least attempts to
break jail, seem to be quite frequent
lately in several parts of the State. At
Jackson, last Sundiy, a desperate negro
confined in the county jail, endeavored to
escape by overpowiog the jailor, and aa
the negro was very powerful, no doubt he
would have succeeded in his design if the
jailor hail not called upon the sheriffs
son, who was near with a gun in his
haauV, to shoot, which he did, wounding
the prisoner severely in the chest The
negro then surrendered, ami was returned
to his cell.
A little daughter of Mr. finndlnir at
Livingston, met an accidental and awful
death at the hands of her sister about a
week smce. The children were playing,
and entered a room in which there w.oa
loaded shot gun. Oae of the sisteis took
the, gun in her hands, whila the other
loowjci in at tne muzzle, when the gun
was discharged, tearing away almost the
entire head of the little one, causing ic
ttant death.
A mao, or- rather ono who bore the
form of mm, without his soul, me, a
lady on the street in Memphis the other
day, aud commenced using abusive lan
guage. Tho lady picked up a brickbat,
when the cowardly scoundrel, mado off.
He was pursued and finally arrested.
After leaving -twenty dollars as a forfeit,
he left for St. Louis.
