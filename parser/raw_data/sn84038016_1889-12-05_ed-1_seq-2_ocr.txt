Ko attention Is paid to ancoymcua eoamuslr
ttum. Speaker Used recognizes the siWer
question as ona of the most important
matten that will oonae before Congress,
and in making up the Committee on
Coinage says that he intendi to have the
different views folly represented.
Mb. Gladstone is a believer in the
wisdom and Jnstioe of looal option. In
the great speech which he delivered at
Manchester Monday he advocated grant
ing to the English County Councils the
power to regulate and control the liq
uor trams.
The annual report of Secretary Win
dom shows the total revenue of the
averntnent from all sources during the
year ending June 30, 1889, to be $387,
050,053 81. The expenditures for the
same period were 1281,996.615 60, leav
ing a net surplus for the year of 157,
470,129 59.
The annual report of the Superin
tendent of Public Instruction ot this
State shows that during the year 13,253
teaohers were employed in the sohools,
121 of whom were oolored. There are
9.928 school-houses. The white males
in school numbered 356.822; oolored
males. 9 893; white females, 364,527;
oolored females, 9.633. The total enu
meration of ohildren of school age was
770,875. The report shows that the
average number of pupils in attendance
upon the schools was but 350.752 less
than half the enumeration.
In commenting on the President's
message the Chicago Inter Ooean says:
"It is truly Republican. It is the yoioe
of an exeoutive who feels bound to exe
cute the laws as they are interpreted
by the sense of the Nation whioh eleoted
him to oflioe. The message has none
of that offensive "my policy," none of
that aSsotation of mental superiority to
the people, whioh was apparent in the
mesa-ages oi President Cleveland. Gen
eral Harrison does not aspire to be
wlaa bo, that whiab la written" in
the platform ot the party which nomi
inated him. and whioh was read anc
approved by the people who eleoted him
The President's first message is a dec
laration of his intent to do that which
the people elected him to do to wit
to carry out a soundly Republican pol
ioy.
Apparently the Damooraoy means
to cling to its soul remaining issue of
free trail uatll it is haoimered out of
it by the Republicans as it was ham
mered cut of its farmer stubborn adhe
renco to the oaispsnion doctrines oi
free trade the dogmas of slavery and
secession. Not eatiafiad with obi'i
natcly rumraisg its head tgint the
stono wall of publio opinion in the na
tional election of 18SS, it must needs
again formally commit itself, through
the action of the D?mooratio caucua at
Washington, to the issue of tarifl smash
ing "aa embraced ia President Cleve
land's message to the last Congreaa
upon that subject, and in the platform
and principles adopted by the last Dem
ooratio National Convection at St,
Louts." For this prooedure the hearty
thanks of the Republicans are due to
the Democratic leaders. These gentle
men have once more been at great pains
to expressly declare to the country at
large that their bitter hostility to the
protective tariff whioh has built up our
industries is nowise abated; and in so
doing they have rendered a signal ser
vice to the party whioh is the unswerv
ing ohampioa of protection principles.

DEAD FLIES.

Otherwise.
To tt Editor of the Piulwdi-m :
"Dead fLea caoe tha ointment of
the apthocry to send forth a ttiokiag
savour, as data a little folly ot him that
i in reputa-ioa tor wUdom and hon
our." V hen these word were uttered,
many hundreds ci $era ago, the oint
ment ot the apothecary was much val
ued lor it healiog properties. It was
not the a?e ot cure il remedies, corner
drug stores and phyaioians by telephone,
but the apothecary with his sweet
smellinc ointment and preparations was
an important tunetionary.
A fly on the wing, in the sunlight, or
on the wall where he belongs, is a very
tnfliDg thing and of little oonoern in
the affairs ot life, but let the hungry fly
alight on your noae, or bald head, when
you are tired and sleepy, or fiod a rest
ing plaoe in your soup or oofiae, and it
is altogether another affair. He is mag
nified to the proportions of a crocodile
or an elephant. He smells aloud to the
heavens, and causes you as much worry
and bother as he did the apothecary
whose ointment was in danger ot being
spoiled by his adhesive atiok-to-you-tive
nature.
Dead flies, of a putrid, decaying,
loathsome charaoter, oauie society to
emit an aroma not conduoive to moral
health. Fumigation is powerless to
prevent the spread. The flies vary in
sii3 from a oommon house fly to a regu
lar old blue-bottle.
We are not surprised at the notions
of a fool. "Yea also, when he that is a
fool walketh by the way, his wisdom
taileth him and he sayeth to every one
that he is a tool." He is a fly that is
not muoh in the way, and is rather to
be pitied than blamed. But when a
man "that is in reputation for wisdom
and honor" displays a little folly, then
he is a fly that begins to be trouble
some. Wben be makes a genuine tool
of himself, then he is a dead fly that
sends forth a savor that would spoil all
the ointment in oreation.
One ot the blue bottle dead flies is
profanity. This is a tolly that is inex
cusable, disgusting and nauseating in all
its details. You run afoul of this dead
fly in every public and even private
plaoe, for the swearer will obtrude his
bar room ways and vile profanity every
where. It the usages ot polite sooiety
prevent him from swearing aloud he
will tweir under his breath. It's aea-
i ond nature, and a great relief to him
evidently. It a sorrowful tear from
Heaven ooald fall for every oath,
thoughtlessly and without excuse, ut
tered, the earth wculd be deluged. And
yet it I were to tell one of these swear
ers that he was no gentleman, he would
knock me down, and witn an oatn no
doubt. I could have more respect for
the burglar or eneak thief, because he
might have the excuse of hunger or
neoessity; but the swearer is not en
titled to any respect, because he has not
the slightest exouse under the sun.
When 1 go out tuning and bait my hook
with a good healthy worm or other bait,
and a sly old oat after several feints
makes a mistake and thinks the worm
is not loaded, like lots of folks, and I
proudly haul him out. As I take the
kaok oni ot Win blaaaina . ailla and . ai-
mire his proportions, a teeliog ot com-
paaaion comes over me when 1 think
that he was lured from his home by
hunger and deceived by my bait. He
was a hard one to land, and though he
is but a fiih he receives my admiration
and pity. But when 1 cast in my hook
without the aa.picion . ot a bait on it
and some silly representative ot the
fiany tribe soaps it up, and he is landed
without even a decent tusle, then
lose all respect tor the poor silly thing.
So it is with thnawearer. He gobbles
up the hook that do no have even
the smell ot a bait on if. You don't
have to bait tor this silly representa
tive ot the a.aicine tribe. You fiad thia
aticking fl everywhere, and he has lit
tie regard for other folks' feelings. He
is a hard one to stomaoh, but you have
to run the gauntlet of his billingsgate
on almott every oocasion.
There is only a tew lucky mortals
that are exempt from hearing profanity.
and they are deat as a post. 1 am an
ardent admirer ot baseball, when we
oan get it square. When I think the
proipeot is lair for a pretty good artiole
1 go. 1 secure a seat all by myself, bat
when the orowd gathers one of the
stinkingest kind of a dead fly oooupies
a seat just below me. When the first
man aroee to bat be swears. When he
goes out on a foul he swears. When
the next man makes a single and steals
seoond he swears. When the pitcher
makes a baulk, or the short stop a muff
he swears. When the right fielder
makes a fine catch, and the boss slugger
a home run, and everybody oheers, he
reserves his breath expressly to swear.
He is there to cuss, and every inning is
his inning.
If St, Peter should relax his vigilance
for a moment at the Pearly Gates and a
man who had taken the name of his
maker in vain, willfully and without
excuse, from his youth up, should by
the merest aooident sneak into Heaven,
the angels would raise their handa in
holy horror and forget their humility
long enough to kiok him back into his
native element. I hold no pessimistio
views, nor am 1 an optimist. The world
is not rapidly going to the bad. neither
is the public morals improving evil and
good is about evenly weighed in the
balanoes but it is necessary to turn
some very good, heavy-weight Christ
ians loose in a oommunity to add to
those ot a lighter calibre, or else the
dead fly end of the scales would have
the drop on their enemies. Yes, they
must be enemies, good and evil, and it
has been a regular see-saw, or like the
tug ot war game, between them for
aces. The rules and regulations ot one
side are golden rules of love and har
mony. Its limits and opportunities of
elevation are as vast as space Its found
ations as firm as the eternal hills. Its
mighty men ot Christian valor are
the heroes of time, and have erected
tor themselves monuments more endur
ing than marble, mat tower to the
heavens in sublimity. Ua the other
side it is a kind of a go-as you-please,
don't care-if I-do, walk up and take
something policy that govern. The
wages are poor and there is no chanoe
ot promotion.
Unless you should happen to desert
and go over to the other side, where the
food is better, the raiment cleaner and
the drink purer, and higher wages pre
vail, you will find yourself eventually so
low down in the scale ot humanity that
your former companions in sin will
have no use for you and oblivion is your
refuge, unhallowed and unsung. You
have been a general and led the host
of sin in many fierce conflicts of right
and wrong. The recruits that have
flocked to your standard have been
many, but when you drop out ot the
ranks your memory will only be a blot
jour future worae than a blank. Alas,
the dead fiiea ot humanity !

We meet young ladies in society with
lovely faoes and sylph like forms. They
are as lair as Helen ot Troy. They
have every advantage that indulgent
parents oan give them. They are
equipped by nature and art to be
the adornments ot society. Man, who
is in search ot his ideal like Japhet in
search ot a father, thinks he has at last
found this divine she. This is not
always a difficult disoovery to the ear
nest seeker, sinoe the ideal is but a
vague and indefinite image (outlines
merely), waiting the skillful hand of
woman, who has ingenuity to disoover
his peouliar vanity, to give them a local
habitation and a name. Much that
seems perfect is double. Eaoh taoe has
its two profiles, each coin its two sides.
But let us take a peep behind the home
curtain and see her who was last even
ing the very im personification of Area
dian simplicity and amiability. The
bewitching smile has faded into a petu
lant irown. Jibe pretty truisms no
longer tall from her lips as when sur
rounded by a throng ot admirers. The
words of disrespect that she speaks
to a gentle and patient mother
would make the hair ot her most
ardent admired stand upon his head
like quills upon a poroupine, and would
oure the most desperate case ot love
sickness. Lavater says: "A great

And he might have added that it a girl
was smothered with accomplishments
and did not know how to treat her
mother respectfully and reverently, she
lacks that whioh tends to consolidate
a firm system of charaoter that whioh
tends to form a friend, a companion and
a wife. Hermes must have taken the
respectful daughter as his ideal when
he paid such a glowing tribute to noble
womanhood: "A beautiful and chaste
woman is the perfeot workmanship of
God. the true glory of the angels, the
rare miraole ot earth, and the sole won
der ot the world."
And to suoh we say: All honor to
woman! The hand that hath made you
fair, hath made you good I
We hear young boys speak disrespect

itch to wring their silly little necks tor

then the thought at on je coours that it
is a mystery how he esoaped the tool
killer so long.'
Respeot and reverence are forces
latent or entirely deficient in his char
aoter. it you rub the fur ot such a
man the wrong way, the little veneering
of civilization will disappear, and you
will have the loud mouthed, intolerant
savage of oentunes aeo. This is the
chap that goes to church to misbehave,
ot course tie would not contribute
the one hundredth part ot what he
spends for oigars to support an institu
tion ot that charaoter. When the con
tribution box comes his way he will be
intent on something in the opposite di
rection, or chip in a rlugged nickle or a
button. Its true to his giddy, disre
spectful nature. Among the numerous
unsavory dead flies is that ot intem
perance. There is a time, at least, in
every man's lite wben he is in a period
of ionooeooe and purity. Mankind is
not iustantaneocsly oorrupted. No one
without one single deviation from a so
ber and even tenor of conduct, ever
plunged into the depths of a drunkard's
career. Evil ia always progressive. We
decline from right not suddenly, but
step by step. An habitual drunkard is
not made in a day, or a month, or a
year. He goes down the ladder by de
grees. His first drink is taken not be
cause he is urged by an unoon-
ilil-l a. . m
trouaoie appetite, out through a
spirit ot mere malicious mischief and
without any excuse whatever. Like the
poor moth be hitter about until he
gets singed. After the shame ot the
first few drunks has subsided into a
don't oare feeling, the descent down the
parachute is rapid and easy.
The so-called moderate drinker is also
conscripted, and sooner or later is
graduated, lower down. The man who
uses intoxicants as a medicine is onlv
deluding himself, or is an advocate ot
the worst kind of quack remedies. A
man who commences a habit totally at
variance nh bis own nature, and with
no reasonable incentive whatever, with
numerous examples ot the general re
sult before him, must endure the legiti
mate conclusion that he carries a tew
ounoes ot lolly to his grain ot wisdom.

When we see the so ion of a noble
house, bearer ot an illustrious family
name, who has had every advantage in
lite that wealth oould cive. and is en
dowed by nature with talents to cauio
him tor any position, descend by his
own folly so low as to act in the capao
lty of a menial to those who are his
interiors in intellect and ability, then
we are led to exclaim, alas, dead fiiet!
