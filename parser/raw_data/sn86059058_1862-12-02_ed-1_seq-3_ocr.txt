House. The Chiipltiin returned thanks
for the brightening nrospeets for the lib
erty of the slave, tor emancipation from
a system which had involved us in sor
row and shame.
The roll was called by States. A quo
rum was present.
A message from the Senate announc
ed that a quorum hud assembled, and it
was ready for business.
A similar message was sent to the
Senate.
A committee of both Houses was ap
pointed to wait on the President, an
nouncing that they were ready to receive
any communication.
Concklin, of New York, offered a reso
lution, which was adopted, instructing
the committee on naval affairs to inquire
and report the brat mode of placing ves
sels of war on Lake Ontario when an
exigoney may arise, and establish water
communication from other waters to the
lakes, and report which of the various
modes a most reliable.
Vallandigham, of Ohio, offered the fol
lowing resolution, which was adopted:
Resolved, Thar the Committee on Ju
diciary be instructed to inquire and re
port to the House at an early day by
what authority of the Constitution or
laws, if any, the Postmaster General un

Cox, of Ohio, offered the following:
Whereas many citizens of the United

and without any opportunity being al

charge made or alleged to be made
aga'nst them;
Whereas, certain arrests have been
made in the States where there is no in
surrection or rebellion, or pretense there

Whereas, It is the sacred right of ev

lle$hed, That the House of Repre

Headquarters Army Totomac, )
Nov. 30th, 1862.
Considerable excitement is occasioned
by the circulation of a report here that a
proposition has been made by the rebels
for an armistice of thirty days, and that
Lee was already in Washington arrang
ing terms of the agreement. No cre
dence is put iu this rumor, however.
The rebels arc working with redoubled
vigor on their fortifications, and their
cavalry of late have been very active and
have captured a number of our pickets
along the fords of the river, besides the
two companies of the 3d Pennsylvania
cavalry at Harwood Church.
Longstreet commands the right and
Hill the left of the rebel forces confront
ing us. Deserters coming within our
lines rejort that a large body of their
forces have been detached and sent off
either to Richmond or to rf lnforee Stone
wall Jackson. These reports must lie
received with great caution. Our caval
ry have captured a number of rebels on
the river below this place.
A Fight Kxpceted.
New York, Nov. 29. The armv cor
respondent of the Philadelphia 'Lnquirer
from Acquia Creek, says, daily, hourly,
iu fact momentarily, we expect to hear
the first gun fired that will inaugurate
the first grantl battle of this campaign,
for it is in that vicinity that the entire
rebel army almost is concentrated, 100,
000 strong.
A dispatch to the Philadelphia Press
says that last night Rurnside's army
woultl soon move and that we are on the
ave of one of the greatest battles of mod
ern times.

Washington, Nov. 29. It is under

Highly Important from Richmond.
Washington, Nov, 30. To-morrow
the Philadelphia Inquirer will contain a
Washington dispatch, professing to Jhave
reliable information direct from Kieh
mond. The substance of its information
which is probably of average reliability,
or more is as follows:
'"The people of Richmond have been
having another panic for the past two
weeks. The removal of McClellan and
the rapid movement of Hnrnside were
the first causes. At the time of Burn
side's movement, Longstreet was in Rich
mond on his way to Nrth Carolina, the
campaign in Virginia being supposed to
be over for the winter. A part of his
corps were with him. They were put in
to the works around Richmond at once,
while he took the cars for Fredericksburg
to hold the Rappahannock line if possi
ble; and if not. to retard our movements
till Lee should come up. There are
now twenty to twenty-five thousand in
the works around Richmond, and but
80,000 north ofithtt place, including
Lee's and Jackson's forces.
Jackson has been recalled, with Hill
and Stuart, from the Valley, to form the
left flank of Lee's army. Jackson was
opposed to coming, and wanted to keep
up a division of our forces by raids into
Maryland and Pennsylvania, but was
overruled b' Lee and Davis. The Cabi
net at Richmond have ordered Lee to
throw his whole army on the Rappahan
nock, and dispute every foot of ground
thence to the rebel capital. They have
plenty of raw provisions, and millions of
pounds of beef, pork and flour are accu
mulating at Richmond. Vessels with
clothing are running the blockade every
week, but their army is still suffering
terribly. Numerous recent events serve
to inflame the Richmond panic, such as
Lee's suddenly changing from the offen
sive to the defensive; his telegraphing
daily for more men to save the Capital,
piteous appeals of their army for clothes,
(Jen. Dix's capture of their pickets on
the Chickahoininv, the discoverv that
they've lost G0,000" to 100,000 in the last
UOdays in battle, by sickness and deser
tion, and indications of slave insurrec
tions during the holidays; Burnside and
the Government are believed to have lull
acquaintance with these facts. Rurnside
regards his present force as ample for
the work before him."
Complaints against thr; administration
of the (iuarteruiaster's Department grow
louder. Rurnside is un.-leratood to have
made the strongest representations on
tliissubiect to the Administration during
his recent visit here. It is ascertained
on all hands that if Meigs had furnished
the necessary articles at the proper time,
there would have been no delay at Fal
mouth. Meigs admits the failure, but
charges it on the Engineer Corps. Ru
mors are rife to-night that Meigs either
is removed or is to be speedily, but they
can hardly be well founded.
TAX REVENUE.
Stories current for some weeks, of a
belief that two or three blind red mi 11 io US
would be realized from the Internal Rev
enue bill are characterized by Mr. Chase
as gross exaggerations.
Mr. Morrili, of Vermont, whose offi
cial position makes his opinion also
trustworthy, says the revenue from taxa
tion up to July next is sure to be less
than one hundred millions.
CABINET MEETING BCRSSIDE PRESENT.
An important cabinet meeting was
held this afternoon, to consider, as is
supposed, certain jenints in the forth
coming message, and also matters be
fore Fredericksburg. Gen. Rurnside's
visit there to-day is supposed to have
have had some connection with the
Cabinet meeting. Rurnside has return
ed to the army.
THE FEDERAL OAVALRX TAKEN PRISONERS.
The battalions of a regitneut of Illi
nois cavalry, under Capts. Johnston and
Hess, comprising detachments of Com
panies F, C, G aud M, while out on a
reconnoissance westward from Freder
icksburg, yesterday, were surprised by
an overpowering force of rebel cavalry,
and, after a brisk little fight, were all
taken prisoners. We lost one hundred
men and five commissioned officers.
Several were killed and wounded before
our men surrendered. This regiment is
the one which cut its way out of Har
per's Ferry before the surrender of that
place.
EXPLOIT OF GEN. STAHL.
Gen. Stahl attacked a superior force
of rebel cavalry at Snicker s Ferry yes
terday, and drove them within four miles
of Winchester. Fifty rebels were killed,
and forty taken prisoners. Union loss
was but fifteen. A large amount of com
missary stores, ordnance, eighty horse3,
eighty head of cattle, three stand of col
ors, and other rebel property were cap
tured. BANKS' EXPED1TIO.V.
There is great anxiety for the speedy
movement of Ranks' expedition.
Washington Items.
Washington, Dec. 1. The attendance
in Congress to-day was not very large,
either of Senators, members or specta
tors. No diplomats were present. It is
well understood that the message fore
shadows Chase's financial scheme, so far
as it relates to a national banking sys
tem. The Republican of to-day has an elab
orate article, said to be inspired from
official quarters, arguing against any
further advance of Burnside, for fear
that Washington might he attacked.
Rebels Whipped In Arkansas.
Springfield, Dec. 1. General Rlunt
with five thousand federals attacked and
routed about eight thousand rebels under
General Marinakuke, at Cone Hill, Ark.,
ou the 20th, killingjtgixty, and driving
the balance some twelve miles. General
Rlunt telegraphs that the euemy is badly
whipped and will not probably return
north of Boston Mountains again this
winter, and as they have consumed all
subsistence in the valley of the Arkansas
they must retreat into Texas.
Arrival of the Hibernla.
Cape Race, Nov. 29. The steamer
Hibernia from Liverpool with dates to
the 20th, and Londonderry 21s', passed
this morning.
Breadstuffs steady and quiet, Corn
upward.
Provisions dull.
Consols 93 for money.
It is reported thaa steamrr similar to
the Alabama, has left Liverpool and an
other will soon follow.
A Brief Abstract.
New York, Dec. 1. The President, in
his Message, gives a summary from the
Secretary of the Treasury's Report He
refers also to the Reports of the Secreta
, rics of the Navy aud of War, and says,
' though lengthy, they are only brief ab
stracts. I He says there is a decided improve
I meat in the financial condition of the
' Post Office Department compared with
j the preceding years. The Secretary of
1 the fnterioa reports the public lands have
j ceased to be a source of revenue. Spcak
! ing of Indian affairs and the recent trou
i bles he says I submit to your especial
! consideration whether our Indian system
' shall not be remodeled. He suggests
the earliest completion of the Pacific
I Railroad and also the favorable action of
Congress on the projects for enlarging
the Great Canals of New York, Illinois,
and Michigan.
Cincinnati, Dec. 1. River fell two
