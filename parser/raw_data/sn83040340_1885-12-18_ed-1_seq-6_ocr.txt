Wabhikutoit. December 8. Ib the
course of his annual report, Comptroller of
the Carreaey Ca&Bon, referring to the sil
ver question, says that he believes, aa was
stated a year age, that the operation of the
present law which compels the coinage of
3,000,000 standard silver dollars per month,
would eventually bring financial disturb
ance upon the country, and continues: As
the sliver question is more unsettled than it
was at the time the foregoing was written,
not only In the United States, bnt else
where. It seems doubtful It this Government
should attempt to Issue a circulation based
upon silver, even at its bullion value, until
the relative value of this metal is
more definitely settled throughout the
world. The discontinuance of the
coinage of the sliver dollar by our
Government might perhaps have a ten
dency to bring about some agreement with
other nations, and the fixing of a standard
for a series of years; it is, however, evident
that the coinage of the standard silver dol
lar under the present law is in excess of the
requirements of the country, and should be
discontinued. If we continue to add these
dollars to our circulating medium, and they
continue to accumulate in the Treasury, the
Government must of necessity pay some
portion of its obligations in that coin; and
if the Government should pay Its interest
and other obligations and redeem its bonds
In standard dollars, the business of the
country would immediately go to a silver
basis. What effect this would have it is
difficult to predict It wonld appear, how
ever, that gold would goto a premium,
which would compel its being held, to
a certain extent, as an article of mer
chandise, and it woutd not circulate as
money. This would probably occasion
contraction in credits and financial dis
turbance. The effect upon the legal tender
notes, which, by the terms of section 12 of
the act of July 12, 1882, appear to be re
deemable in gold, can not well be foreseen,
but It would be difficult for the Government
with its present stock of gold to redeem the
outstanding legal tender notes or such por
tion of them as might be presented if gold
was held at a premium. Inasmuch as the
national bank notes are redeemable in legal
tender notes, their position would bo deter
mined by tho status of the latter. The
substitution of tho standard silver dollars
and silver certificates based thereon, in
place of bank notes, which is takimr place
under the provisions of law now In force,
evidently requires consideration and appro
priate legislation.

of third parties. Senator Van
Wyck, on behalf of many of his
constituents recently mado inquiry of Gen
eral Sparks hi regard to the matter and was
informed Mint the decision would, unless
reversed by higher authority, be
a guide for tho future action of
land officers, but thnt the Com

actions of his predecessors nor interfere
with claims which have already been
secured under former rulinzs of the Land
Office in this respect unless fraud should

PiTTSBVBon, Pa., December 1L Piae
Run was the scene of another riot yester
day morning between striking coal minora
and men working at reduced wages. Aboas
3:30, when twenty-five miners were on their
way to work, a squad of 900 masked men
met them and demanded that they return
home. This they refused to do, and, toe
mob made an attack upon them with clubs
sticks and stones. The riot lasted two hours.
Ten men were injured. One Newton Camp
bell was beaten insensible and his injuries
are believed to be fatal. Richard Hall and
Samuel My ford were also seriously Injured.
The others got away wkh slight cuts and
bruises after standing their ground for
nearly two hours.
The non-unionists were finally driven off
and fled to places of safety. The strikers
stayed in the vicinity until after daybreak,
watting for more miners to come to work,
but none made their appearance.
The mob then wedged the switch of the
private coal road running to tho mine and
disappeared over the hills. A train com
ing along a short timo after was thrown,
from the tractc and the engine upturned,
but no one was li'irt. Sheriff Gray, with a
posse, has gone to the scene. There
was no further trouble at Pine River dur
ing the day, but another outbreak is
looked for. Sheriff Gray returned to this
city yesterday afternoon and reported every
thing quiet He is holding himself in
readiness, however, and will start for the
miners if there is any indication of another
assault The strikers are camped in
the woods some distance from the
mines, but will not allow any one
to approach them. The people living
in the vicinity are greatly alarmed, and an
ticipate a general raid along the river. Su
perintendent O'Ncll, of the Pine River
mines, says he believes the mob will attack
tiie mines again, and that an effort will
be made to bum the tipples and engine
house.
The movement seems to to have been a
thoroughly organized one, as secret meet
ings of the strikers have been held daily for
over a week. It is believed that tho Alle
quippa mines will be tiie next point of
attack, as suspicious looking men have
been hanging around there all day. Last
evening fifty regaling rifles were
shipped to tho Allequippa mines to bo dis
tributed among the iion-unio.i men.
They will be supplied with fitly rounds of
ammunition and bloodshed is quite proba
ble if the strikers attempt to disturb them
on their way to and fiom the mines. It

a visit to Walton's mines, near Elizabeth,

What ts Attorney Orams Has to Soy
Ateaat Bis Department.
Washthgtox, December 10. The annual
report to Congress of Attorney General
Garland gives a tie tailed succinct statement
of the operations of that department
throughout the country during the past
year, including the business of the Supreme
Court, the Court of Claims, and the Court
of Commissioners of Alabama Claims.
During the year 1,058 civil snlts and 11,977
criminal prosecutions were terminated in
the various United States Courts, leaving
2,146 of the former class and 3,808 of the
latter class pending at the dose of the jesr.
The aggregate amount of judgments ren
dered in favor of the United States in civil
suits during the year was 8677,383, and the
amount actually collected on these judg
ments was 870,457; while 837,028 was ob
tained doling the year on judgments as
. rendered in former years for the United
btates, and 8144,453 was otherwise realized
in civil suits. The aggrecate amount of
fines, forfeitures and pennlties Imposed dur
ing the year in criminal prosecutions was
8481,750, and the amount of these fines,
forfeitures and penalties collected during
the year was 802,124, while 86,187 was
realized on fines, forfeitures and penalties
inqiosed in former years. The aggre
gate amount of court expenses paid dur
ing the year was 82,874,733. The Attor
ney General suggested the advisability of
building jails at each place in the country
where the United States courts are held.
The necessity of building a Government
penitentiary, where all persons convicted
of United States offenses could be con
fined. Is strongly urged. "Such conviits,"
he says, "could he employed in the manu
facture of supplies exclusively for the Gov
ernment which work would assist in mak
ing the institution self-sustaining." Ho
also suggests the propriety of erecting on
the grounds adjoining the Department of
Justice a proper building for the accommo
dation, in addition to the department of the
Supreme Court and other proper courts and
commissions of the United States. The
Attorney General makes a number of other
recommendations, among which are the fol
lowing: That the fees of Marshals in
Montana, Idaho and Wyoming be doubled;
that the salaries of Marshals be revised:
that thn compensation of the United
States Attorney for New Mexico and Arizo
na be increased and that tho compensa
tion of clerks of the United states Courts
in California be reduced; that attorneys
and marshals be required to make
returns by fiscal instead of cal
endar years; that the accounts of chief
supervisors of elections be taxed in open
court under the instructions of the District
Attorneys; that the penalty for the punish
ment of persons resisting officers be made
more severe; that increased provisions be
made for the protection of United States
witnesses and that a suitable United States
jail be built at Fort Smith, Ark. The re
port closes with a brief statement of the
Union Pacific Railway litigation and sas
that a motion will be filedfby the Govern
ment in the Supreme Court in a few days
to advance the appeals in the dockets so as
have a speedy determination of them. The
Attorney General adds that the motion will
doubtless be granted and the matter be dis
posed of an early date.
EXPLOSIONS.
Tho Kanniu City Gnu Works Totally
Wrrckcd Gas Explosion In I'ennnylranU.
Ka?sh City, Mo., December 10. At
1:10 o'clock yesterday morning a terrible
explosion occurred at the works of the Kan
sas City Gas Light and Coko Company,
corner of First and Campbell streets, on
the East levee. Tho shock was plainly
felt in all parts of the city. Windows were
broken and doors wrenched from theii
hinges blocks away from the scene of the
disaster. The explosion occurred in the
purifying house and was heard for miles
around, bouses fifteen or twenty blocks
away being rocked as by an earthquake.
The shock and terrible report created the
greatest excitement in the city. Although
the hour toas late and the night very dark
and stormy, people turned out hurriedly
in all sorts of costumes. Many thought
that an earthquake had occurred, while
others declared that a dynamite explosion
of the most dating and gigantic character
had taken place. As soon as the alarm
sounded all the nptown fire companies
rushed tothescenoof the disaster, and in
cry few moments a largo force or fire
men, policemen, gas house employes and
others were ac work on the piles
bcr
ot broken oricn nnu splintered tim-
to get at the wonnded
if any had been engulfed in the ruins. A
large crowd had already gathered about the
works, ami both the night shift at the
works and those of tho day shift who lived
near aHd who had turned ont in all sorts of
hurriedly donned costumes, were already at
wore use neroes. oeverai streams oi water
were turned on the blazing ruins. The
workmen were called together and
counted, and it was found that all of the
night force could be accounted for except the
engineer. Julius W. Slosson. Soon groans
were beard issuing from a pile of brick and
lumber where the boiler room bad formerly
stood, and the engineer was dog out He
was found to be badly injured, bnt
hopes are entertained of his recov
ery. The works are a total wreck
and the loss is variously estimated at
from 8100,000 to 8150.00. The officers of
the Gas "Company feel positive that it was
not a gas explosion, but the result of dyna
mite. This theory Is only based on the
fact that the company have for sev
eral weeks past had trouble with and dis
charged several employes.

It is a good plan to milk cows regnlarly

every time. Regularity of hour m com
mencing the milking of tho herd is aa ad

animals, as well as men, are greatly the

For Cow Itch: Keep animals ont in

ing food anil avoid crowding; oil the whole
surface of tho body with raw linseed oil,
and a few li"-irs later wash clean, breaking
all tho scun or scales. Then take eight
pounds of tobacco, boil thoroughly, strain
it and set aside; take one pint of oil of tar,
one-half pound of pure carbolic add, two
pounds of soft soap and dissolve in boiling
water, add this to the tobacco decoction
and add water to make a mixture of 35
gallons. If this is too much for number of
