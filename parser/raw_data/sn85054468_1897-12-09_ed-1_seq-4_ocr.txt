Nevertheless, let u give Mr. MeKiuley
euchcrMltas is involved In the tact that,
in one roajwot, he has liuwn a f-f.litary
sciutiH-litin oJ good Ait.erieaniiii. A far
aswcemi jHSge frm W wonls, he really
is aaxlaus for Hawnhaii annexation, and
.for reasons which, wliether personally
ingexmousor imt, art- ov national reascus.
Jfetbing could he utre evident than that,
If wewje not to annex Hawaii, the Angio
Japucse alliance would before we knew
-wfcat had hit us Tiurinically, the Ha
waiian Iflands, nuTt under our ld pro
tectorate are i.w-essarv Ui ir Comnierciai
and naval positHn in the Pacific Ocean.
By all recognized authorities, it is ad
nutted that the control or Hawaii is the
control of the trade of that great expanse
ofTvaters, and that it includes tho paci-
. mount position, in. the future trade of the
world, if the nation holding the group also
psntrols the tatute major avenue of the
world's commerce between the Atlantic
and Pacific. That avenue it is our amhi
tlon and oar business to build, own and
hold agamifc all creation.
It 1. a very Mihplc proposition, from anj'
point coiiMdered: The rapid growth of
our population, the Hilt more rapid trans
latiou of out reHiurees into surplus products,
and the struggle for life which such socio
logical and economic facts confront us
with, render it vital and necessary that we
should seize every advantage of position
or influence which nature anil God have
placed within our reach. Unless we can
secure to ourselves the benefit of our
Hituatiou and posses ourselves oT the terri
torial and other facilities requisite to its
future maintenance and expansion, we
bhall be surrounded and sterilized by the
policies and power of rival nations, and
indeed become the producer only of raw
materials the "hewer of wood and the
drawer of waer" for more astute, enter
prising and vigorous: rivals.
As the first grand step in tlie march of
American progress toward the goal of
commercial supremacy in Uie twentieth cen-'
tury, the arijuMtlou of Hawaii is an abso
lute condition precedi-nt. The Senate will
be rulfo to duty and to country If it does
not take the i-arliest action possible to
make it 'un lait accompli."

Perhaps it was not iiilicieul greediness
that put it into the head of Mr. Bingley to
insist that all Uie financial features or the
President's message should be referred to
the Committee of Ways and Means. Prob
ably it wa something else; but whatever
it may have been,-it failed to work, be
cause Mr. v.'alker, of Massachusetts,
chairman of the Committee on Hanking
and Currency, insisted that must of such
matters belonged to his tea party and
not to that of Mr. Diugley. Being suc
cessful in 'his coutcntitiu, it only remains
to wonder what the reason was that the
Illustrious author of the trust and deficit
tanf was x anxious to deprive the ap
propriate committee of Its right to ex
cogitate and to digest the financial rec
ommendations of the Executive.
We do not feel much hesitation In con
cluding that it was because -Mr. Diugley
feared the Hanking and Currency Com
mittee woulo try to do something; whereas
there appears to be a common understand
ing that nothing whatever is to be done.
A cold chill indeed appears to have af
fected tue Administration in conneetioti
with "currency reform," since the autumn
elections. Many campaign debts of ;S9G
are still outstanding, and they are alnv.wt
entiiely due to Wall street Influences. Hut
tlie piesent chance for paying them
through t tie retirement of nationalcurrency,
ant the .substitution for it of national bank
notes, bnsed on a billion dollars f new
bonds, as undoubtedly was agreed ipon
before tlie sixteen million dollar il.inna
fund was contributed, is seen to be hope
less, and, of course, I he ueKt best thiugto
d- is- t saw wood and say nothing until
after the Oougressioual elections of next
year.
Some or the strongest of Mr. McKiuley's
supporters in Congress are frank enough
to confess that the probable result of a
present agitation of the Gage scheme
would be a free silver bill, and, most
likely, its passage. A political buzz-saw
of that kind is to be avoided irpostible.
and there is- not a doubt t hat orders have
been issued to and accepted by Speaker
Rued, providing for prompt suppression of
any d:sire to piecipitate a general cur
rency discussion. It mty be difficult to
prevent it, since, already, the leading gold
organs are sjjwiug their teeth and growl
ing; but ir Mr. Heed has made up his mind
the ouestion is settled.
Queer for nil Old Soldier.
When Major McKinley delivered his In
augural address he remarked upon the pub
lic necessity Tor legi-latiou -which would
fill the Treasury of the country. He said:
"Ample revenues mul be -upplied, not only
for the ordinary expenses or the Govern
ment, but for the prompt payment of
liberal pensions.' In view of this strong
utterance at the outset of his Administra
tion, it is regarded as extremely peculiar
that tin' 1 resident did not write a word on
the subject of pensions from the beginning
to the end of his message.
Jut now this is unusually strange since
for weeks the press of the country has beea
calling govrn mental attention to the
strange picture presented in .1 pension list
annually glowing longer, a whole genera
tion after the end of the war. This fact
and the furtl.ei one that the cost to the
people 1ms risen until practically It now
equals the receipts, from internal revenue
taxation, hae led to a widespread and
urgent demand for light on the subject.
One would suppose that Mr. McKinley
-would have at least a word or two to say
to Congress upon a matter of such na
tional irte rest and convent; but on the sjb
ject of pensions' his message is as dumb as
a drum Tilth a hole in it.
It occurs to us to suggest to the dis
tinguished and punctilious minister of the
Queen of Spain near this Government that
he is not getting the worth of his money.

In discu'-slng the Hawaiian annexaiion
matter, it will be -well foi the purists of
the Senate to remember that a lithe uioney
is on the anti-annexation side.

But above and beyond these victories,
the Emperor has succeeded nt home In

neatness and a gjlttellng eye to diama'ic
effect, Wilhelm now comes back at hfs
Reichstag vrtth his naval program, and
once n.ore asks for 40,000,000 m.uks

Members of the Austrian Rcichsrath can
pass the lie in thirteen different lan
guages. Keiituckians use but one. Bad
luck, however, usually marks the inci
dent. The Hon. Hannis Taylor, lately minister
at Madrid, has published a statement cm
liodyliig his views of the portion of Mr.
McKpilcy'e message relating to Cuba. It is
a masterful arraignment of the cold-blooded
and "serenely cynical" attitude adopted
by the Administration. Mr. Taylor points
out the utter njpocrisy of the assumption
that tin- publication of a royal decree by
the Queen Regent is anything better than
so much waste paper, as far as legally
giving any measure of self-rule to Cuba
even ir the Cubans were willing to accept
and act uuder It. Mr. Taylor states that
this action on the part of theSagasta gov
ernment In Spain has been widely denounced
as without warrant In lav.- and revolution
ary, which undoubtedly it is. The decrje
of autonomy assumes to abrogate whole
books t, existing national laws, and to
erect In thei: place an entirely new and
totally antagonistic code. Under the con
stittitioi of the kingdom that alone can be
doue by an act or acts of the Cortes, ap
proved by the sovereign. Until that has
been doi e the decree is worthless humbug
an executive promise made for roreign
effect; lying and treacherous. The Cortes,
which A ill pass upon Uie matter if
it chooses to, will not even be elected until
March of nest year. We Join with Mr.
Taylor In Ids surprise that the President

autonomy delusion at considerable length,

It was hardly complimentary to the es

The President's Mother.
To the Udltor of The Times:
Allow me to appeal to you for soma
explanation of the outrage committed by
nearly all of our newspapers in their per
sistent allusion to the President's dying
mother as "Mother McKinley." It seems
to me this flippant familiarity Is both
ill-timed and vulgar. During Mrs. lie
Kinlcy's visit to the White House, at the
time of her son's inauguration, no one
would have dared to address her as
"Mother McKinley," therefore, why should
the newspapers do so now? B. B.
j IWe quite agree -with our correspondent
as 10 uie jacK. 01 ueucaoy in reiernng 10
this venerable lady except as Mrs. Mc
Kinley. It is an error -which the young
men who write headlines for the Ameri
can press explain by a well-authenticated
remark of the President himself.
During the week following his inaugura
tion he was asked hy a reporter at the
White House just how he thought his
mother should be addressed, to distinguish
her from his wife, and his reply was: "Oh,
call her Mother McKinley: that is what
she will like best." This conversation
was naturally printed far and wide.)

CAPITOL GOSSIP.
1
Congressman Cannou, of Illinois, cluiir
man of the House Appropriation Commit
tee, is oik of several of the veteran legis
lators who thinks Congress at tills session
In order to reduce the expenditures of the
Government durijig the fiscal year, should
not pass a general river and harbor bill.
He strongly urges this policy, expecting,
of course, the projects which have hero to
fore been provided for under the con
tinuing procw, and for which appropria
tions necessarily will have to be made
annually to protect the work already
done. Senators and Representatives, as
a rule are In favor of a river and harbor
blll, and inquiry proves that they will
go ahead with the measuio regardless
of the warnmgs that the expenditures
must he greativ reduced. This hill, hov
ever, will not carry as large an aggregate
sum for the improvement of the water
ways as that passed in the last Congress,
as there is no necessity for it. But it
will pass, and opini.m at the Capitol is
that it could be passed over the Presi
dent's veto, as was the case during Mr.
Cleveland's last term, when the Exe
cutive interposed ids objection.
Being asked ir he thought many of the
Democrats would vote with Gen.-Grosveiior
and other prominent Republicans who want
the civil service law wiped off the statute
liooks, Hon. Benton McMilliu or Tennessee
said he opposed the measure when it was
passed in Congress, and, at the time, de
nounced it as the worst humbug that had
ever ,becn put upon the people, lie tlu'ii
predicted that, no matter which party
mlght be la power, the law would be
openited to catch either the gmt or tins
camel, according to the exigency of the
situation. President Harrison, Air.McMillin
said, had men. work nights and Sundays
to suspend the Cleveland regulations so
thathecould cram the rail Way mall service
lull of Republicans, and then, when Cleve
land came In again, he juggled with the
law, and finally went further and nailed
things down so that the Republicans have
been howling ever since. "I do not thin':,''
added Mr. McMUlin, "that I will vote
now to help the Republicans out of their
diffitulties."
Gen. Giosvenor says the fight agilnst
the law will get hotter as the weeks roll by.
Ii Is claimed that most of the Southern and
Western Republicans will vote for its
icpcal, and the repealers look for votes
alsi. iu the New England, .Middle and
Noithcrn States.
The opinion has been expressed by
Iemouiatlc members of the House Com
mittee of Foieign Afrairs that the ma
jority members of Uie committee will
not permit the Morgan Cuban resolution
to be leported. AS it would do no e,oid
they do not propose to make any motions
at the meetings, .but Mr. Diiumore, of
Aikansas, thinks the Democrats are quite
llkelyl precipitate a discussion incidentally

Since his return to th.' Capital Mr.
Mills has finforpied a number of his
Senatorial associates that all of Uie ean
UldLtes forj(his seat will submit the ques
tion of preference to t he voters ot the
State through a primary election, to be
held some Mine- m the spring :ir early
summer. Gqv, ,Cnlherson and ex-S-nator
Reagan, the ather avowed candidates,
aKi agree ttt it. ami Mr. Mills wlleves
there vyltt 4e4ral.air ..expression of the
I'emocratlt- voters.
Qultt a number or Senators, regardkss
or iJolitieal fairji, hold that the primary
is the true plan, and they think it .s
becoming more popular every year. They
contend, also, that If they were gcnerally
hdd there would not be soraanydendlo ks
in legislatures and failures to elect, which
was tlie tnse with the Oregon leglsJnlare
that last met. Within recent years Wash

the legislatures could not elect.
- 1 tie attack on the civil service reform law
has begun. Mr. GaUlnger, jne of the bit
terest opjKHients or civil service, yesterday
iiifouuced and will press to a conclusion, a
bi.l amending the civil service rermn law
so an to provide that hereafter there shall
be m classified service, except la the
clerical positions In the executive depart
ments, as classified by section l53,ol the
reused statutes, to like clerical appoint
ments in the customs and postal service of
th- United States, iu o'uch offices as shall
employ nrty or more Clerks, and to letter
carriers anil postal clerks or the 1'ost
orrice Hepartnent.
It is fuither provided that every person
appo'.iitt t to any other office or official
position by any hadof a department shall
b.-1 examined oj to his qualifications as
such head of the department shall di
rect, 110 permanent appointment is to be
made until after such appointee shall have
served in the position at least three months
and then onlv when hisofficial record shall
show proper qualification and efficiency.
A great ffort is bj be made this session
to eiadicate some of the evils that r.ave
crept into the pension laws. One of the
amendments to existing laws that will
be enacted will prevent the marriage of
oi 1 soldier to young women for the pur--pose
of -enabling the wives to dm sv the
pension the present law allows. There
are today but three veterans-or the war
of 1S12 on the pension rolls, and yet
there are more than 3,000 widows. The
sulx-.cmimitteg or the House committee
having the pension appropriation In charge
has piovided an amendment with this end
in view, and yestotday in the Senate Mr.
GaUlnger from the - Pension Committee,
introduced a bill which provides that no
pension under, any law' of the United
States- shalMie paid to the widow or any
old soldleiv or. sailor whose marriage is
subequentstrjthe.-ias.s.igo or the ace.
There will be no joint restaurant at the
Capitol. Hieie was some talk of con
verting tlie 'looms occupied by the Con

but the Senate has sat down upon the
proposition. There is no body in the

It will be remembered that Gen. Grant
while President, favored the annexation of
San Domingo, and there was. a great stir
in Congress over the Question. Gen. Grant
seriously thought that it would be an
ixeellent idea to either annex or buy that
country, and send the negross of the United
States there so that they could have a
better chance as a race. One of the mast
effective opponents of that proposition
was Senator Morrill. He made a strong
.and ratbei humorous speech. Some of the
Senators have- rescued it from the Record,
and their purpose now is to use a portion
of the Vermont statesman's argument
against tlie annexation of Hawaii.
T,he opposition Senators cluim that no
vote can be reached before She Christmas
holidays. They also claim, as matters now
stand," they have the annexationists whip

GAGE'S REPLY TO SPAIN.
Secretory Gage sent to the Department of
Stateyesterduy.a report showing the jpe.-a-tions
of this Government for the suppr 4,1011
or filibustering as a direct reply to the com
plaint of the Spanish governmentror. more
speciricnlly set rorth in .1 recent brief jf
Mr. Caldeiou Carlisle, the attorney f-jr
the Spanish legation in thWcity.
Among the points- nude by Secretary
Gage are: In the past two years and a
half six American vessels, aggregating
1,331 registered tons, were alleged to
have landed expeditions. None of tlue
were capable of landing material forces
or stores.
Threi foreign vessels, with an iggre
gate tonnage of 1,772 were alleged to
have passed the hlockadc, the Leon, N'or
wegian; tne ITorm, Danish; and the Bcr
muda, BilUsh. The Secretary suggest.,
that an Inquiry be made as to whether the
Spanish authorities had taken precau
tious to guard against infraction of the
neutrality laws by consuls of foreign
nations here, under whom the crc.Vo of
the tlneo vessels named were shipped.
If these vessels escaped American au
thorities, they also escaped foreign countries'
attention. There were about fifty small
vessels, tugs, lighters, etc., alleged to be
associated with the expeditions.
The Secretary shows thai there were
only C out of a total of 13,533 Amerlciii
vessels available -for filibustering expedi
tions. "As to I he vigilance of this Government, he
says thateight revenue cutters, with crews
or 317 men, armed with fifteen, guns, have
cruised 73,7GS miles, occupying 1 29 mou. lis
in the aggregate, patrolling the coast to
prevent 'illbusteriug expedtllons. They
have captured seven vessels and 115 men:
have broken up two expeditions and liave
held under .surveillance thirteen ves.jels
uniU r susplclou.
Out. of sixty alleged expeditions c nly
rour have been broken up by Spain.
He says significantly that if the Sp.i iWi
patrol of 2,200 miles of Culian coast had
frustrated one-half the number of expe
dftions which were frustrated by Uie
United States authorities along a coast
lln- of 5,470 miles, not one man nor one
cartridge would liave been illicitly landed
In Cul from the United States.
No successful expedition Is reported as
having originated at Key West, which is
only ninety miles distant fiom Culta.
Secretary Gage has looked into sixty al
leged expeuitions, and reports that twenty -eight
have been frustrated hy the Treasury
Department, five by the Navy, four by
Spain, two have been wrecked, one driv -n
back b storm and one failed from a
combination of causes.
The case of the Delaware he regards
as simply a violation ot the English en
listment act. Forty-three were tins
failures.
Secretary- Gage then examine-1 in detail
the seventeen alleged successful expedi
tions. The case of the SIKer Heels is Included,
as the vessel may have beensuccessful,
though nothing has been heard or her since
her depart .re, six weeks ago; she may
have perished in the severe storm a few
days after her departure. Concerning
that case, howeyer. It is to le oLserved
that the collector or New Tork reports:
"Mr. Hand, representing the Spanish con
sul, stated to me that he did not desire the
vessel detained at dock, but seized arter de
parture thererrom. Mr. Hand and Mr.
Thormhlll stated t me that they proposed
that the Pinkerton Detective Agency have
the watching of the pier, and they would
advisethe tnited States marshal promptly
ortuedeparture of the sloop. They seemed
most anxious that this part orthe affair be
left entirely to them, and it impressed me
at the time that they feir, first, that
there would be less chance of a failure if
theirowumen were assigned to this partlcu
larduty; and. second, that they feared their
planof allowingthe vessel to leave the dock,
might be interrered with irthis detail were
in chargeor a customs officer. I made the
suggestion that the ve-vsel could no doubt be
detained at the dock, and that we might
seek advice on this point from the United
States district attorney. Mr. Hand ob
iected to this, and stated unqualifiedly that
they desired the vessel to be taken after
shehad left her berth."
And tho- burveyor orthe port adds:
"Investigation shows that instead ".f
the iurormatiun being teiephcaied direct
to the Barge Office, which would have
takf-n less than five minutes, it was firat
sent to No. 57 Broadway, the office of
the rinkerton agency, from Catherine and
Market streets, and thence to the Barge
Office by messenger. Tills proceeding con
sumed ah mt twenty minutes, during which
time the tug and sloop, having the wind
and tide in their favor, secured sufficient
lead to prevent their being overtaken."

Decision of Interest Rendered uy

Among a large number of decisions ren
dered by Assistant Secretary of the Intorior
Webster Davis, yesterday wa.sone of peculiar
interest, involving the question of de
pendent wnlows, under the act of .Time
27, 1&90.
Tlie case is that of Mary Ann, widow i.f
Daniel Spatz, late Company Er Fourteenth
Pennsylvania Colmiteers, and is rejected
by Assistant Secretary Davis, on the gromd
"that the rating provided Tor hi che
statute under the provisions of .vhich
claimant seeks a pension of $8 per iio.i.h,
and it is not shown bu' that the pro
vision made in the will of the soldier Is
fully commensurate with the rating under
the laW,'T and, therefore, she has otlur
means of support than her daily labor.
Dull Day in Diplomacy.
The State Department and the Whit?
House were both yesterday devoid of in
terest. The President had signed before
he left the city lor his hom all the paji"rs
demanding immediate attention by Con
gress. As to the Haitian shake-up, the
State Department officials have informa
tlon only that the Haitian trouble is
over, tlat is, that the little black re
public has yielded to the gigantic German
Empire.
What Congress Will Do.
fFrom the New York Evening Post.)
The question here Is not whether a ma
jority of the Representatives desire certain
action, but what Tom Reed proposes to
have done. The control of the Speaker
over legislation in the House is today
greatei than was ever before known in
our history-. He can force the passage
ot one measure, and prevent the pas-sage
of another, even although reeling- in his
own party may he strongly in favor of
carrying it through. The dictator of the
House has thus far given no indication
as to what he proposes to have done and.
not done at this session.

The members oT the committee Were

that a lull ought to be prepared as soon is
possible and presented to she House .or
action. It was said after the meettn.,
that in all probability iwo bills will lie
ready Tor the House by trie middle of Fe
ruary.
Chairman Walker said in regard to
this that one of these bills would doubtless
embody the recommendiUons of Secretary
Gage and the other would bein the nature
of a minority repcrt and would recom.a nd
a general bill of different character.
Before adjourning the committee adopted
a resolution as lollows:
"Resolved, That, the committee take up
II. R. 313 amend the title so a.- ti re id
'A bill to increase the circulation
of national banki," and cousider the
(first tuiee sections and atner.d them in ac
cordance with the recommendations of tlie
President on the respective subjects re
ferred tc therein, and report the same in
form as a separate raeu-'-are."
Purlng the meeting the debate became
pretty warm ami was precipitated by
the presentation of the resolution quoted,
b-Mi. Hill, of Connecticut. The three
sectloBs covered by It provide 'nuik etw
latiof up to the par value of bond de
posited, reduction of the tax on circulation

C. S. N.. and Mrs. Peary paid a vlsicthis
afternoon to the British museum, where
they were met by the director. Sir William
Fowl-jr, ant Curator Fletcher, of the
mineralogteal department.
Mr. Fletcher examined a specimen at
the Cane York meteorites, discovered awl
brought to Sew York hy Lieut. Peary,
and ui.eesitatingly declared that it was
certainly a meteoric origin. He added
that no specimen in the British museum
had meteoric characteristics mure sh irply
or more clearly shown than those of tr
Cape York meteorite.
This is the opinion ot one ot the fore
most authorities or the world, and It has
so thoroughly convinced Dr. Keltic secre
tary or the Royal GeographlCRl Sociesy.
that It is considered by him to have
settled the controversy as to the genuine
ness of the Cape York meteorite-.

Opposition to the LTuwnilnii Aniiexn
tion Treaty Soinevrlmt Stroimr.
The Hawaiian annexation treaty did not
ecu 1 up yesterday. The Committee on
Foreign Relations discussed the matter at
its session jesterday informally, in an f
Tort to reae-h a program, hut tin conclusion
was reached. The treaty was reported tothe
Senaceat the close of the last session and Is
now on the calendar. None of the nntl
Hawaliai annexationists appeared berore
thecoinmlttee.aud.so far as can be learned,
they have not laid their side of the case be
fore the individual members.
The committee has ascertained that thi
present standing of Senators ts such as to
warrant the belief that the vote on rati
fication will be daneerously close. Should
ratification prove to be impossible the
joint resolution will betaken up, but that
has not been discussed.
The fommlttee ordered a favorable report
on a bill to piohibit pelagic sealing.

Some Anxious Incpiiries.
To the Editor or The Times:
First--As a business proposition, viewed
in the light of 1 joint stockcornpany ,yvhen
a favored minority attempts to dictate i
a majority, what becomes of the constitu
tional guarantee of equal rights?
Second When applied to civil govern
mpnt, Gen. B. F. Butler said It tended
to the breaking up of party lines, and tlie
formation of hut one party, when the father
of our country said that two parties
v.vie necessary Tor the perpetuity of jur
republlc.
Third Viewed along military lines. If
a commander or an army should surround
himseir with a start of military experts
without considering their patriotic loy
alty to the cau.se Tor which he is con
tending, how many battles would he win?
Fourth When a President can extend
civil seivlce protection to thousands of
Government employes, by promulgating
an arbitrary ultimatum or decree, yvith
out a certified examination, how is the
system jutt?
Fifth Where docs our civil service sys
tem apply lo any but a monarchial Torm
of government, where it can be con
sistently applied to all from the cro.vn
down to the smallest official?
