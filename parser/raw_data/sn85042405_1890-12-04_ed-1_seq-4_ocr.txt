IT IS being told that prices of real es­
tate and residence property in the Twin
Cities have lately dropped with a dull
thud. That residences of modern con­
struction in desirable locations are
offered for cash at prices less than the
lots cost. That much business property
is paying but a small interest on
fhe
in­
vestment and scores of stores not paying
anything. A visit to the leading hotels
shows a Sabbath-like quiet of rest and
recreation prevailing there instead of
the once inspiring and excited train of
strangers and speculators. Every at­
tempt to realize in cash for the greater
portion of this over-boomed property
only shows more clearly the shrinkage.
There are more people in the Twin
cities than there is business for them,
and many have already left.
Not only in St. Paul and Minneapolis
are these things observed, bat it is the
same in Omaha, Kansas City and other
places that have witnessed phenomenal
and brilliant growths. The cities are
ahead of the country surrounding them.
The towns in the Pacific northwest are
now only closing up their records of
mushroom expansion to await the in­
evitable reaction. There is an outcome
to all of this of course, but it will be a
slow one and will leaye many indiscreet
investors in the lurch, pending its ar­
rival.
In the meantime good farming lands
in North Dakota are now sold at prices
much below their relative value. The
first revival of property values will be
noted in this kind of real estate. North
Dakota stock and grain lands are the
best and cheapest on earth. Their steady
rise in value cannot be doubted for a
moment. The next purchasers of these
fertile lands will not be non-producing
speculators. The farms will be worked
for a profit that has not been possible
for years. Th6 prices of farm produce
are on the rise as well as the farms.
THE impression seems to prevail that
Senator Pierce made a pretty strong case
of citizenship in his reply to the charges
that he paid no taxes, and that he was
not a bona fide resident of the state. The
senator shows that for 1888 he paid taxes
to the amount of $140 on Bismarck prop­
erty and $1*23 for the following year. For
1890 they are about the same as ia 1889.
His interests at Jamestown are almost as
much, and by the organization of the
Jamestown loaning company he brought
$1,000,000 capital to the state. He has
been paying taxes at Jamestown since
1877. He went out of the governorship
in January, 1887, and has never thought
of moving from the state since that time.
Senator Pierce owns a residence at Bis­
marck which cost six or eight thousand
dollars. He has also aided his son
Gerald to start a horse and cattle ranch,
in which the investment is several thous­
and dollars- After fully disproving the
charges of not being a resident or tax
payer, the senator says:
"I do not believe that any ha man be­
ing who has ever had dealings with me
can or will point to an instance of dis­
honesty on my part, and I say in all
frankness and sincerity that my reputa­
tion in this respect is worth more to
me and my wife and children than any
office on earth.
For nearly seven years I have been the
persistent advocate of North Dakota, her
interests and her people. All I have in
world is here. I hope 1 have not been a
bad citizen. I certainly have not intend­
ed to be. Whether I shall represent the
people at Washington is for them to say.
But at least I hope it may be vouchsafed
to me to live in the state and not be
driven out because for two years out of
the seven I happened to serve as gov­
ernor of the territory."
Six of the principal postoffices of the
state yet remain in the hands of demo
crate. They are Fargo, Grafton, Grand
Forks, Hilsboro, Mayville and Valley
City. The terms of office in nearly all of
them do not expire for over a year or
more. There is a growing sentiment in
both parties that as these positions are
awarded on the result of politics, their
tenure should not extend beyond that of
the administration that is responsible
for the appointment. President Harri­
son is evidently in accord with this pol­
icy and will follow the advice of leading
party men ia this matter. If the demo­
crats win in the next election it is ex­
pected that they will do the same as
soon as possible. The position of post­
master in any office of any salary or in­
fluence is certainly not a civil service
one.
ELSEWHERK is published a card relat­
ing to the sensational and criminal
charges made against Dr. Harcourt of
Steele, Kidder county, some time ago. It
will be seen that the accusations made
against the character of the doctor are
wholly retracted. It is understood that
after the first excitement had died out
Dr. Harcourt returned to Steele, where
explanations followed that convinced
the accusing parties of their mistake,
and exonerated the doctor, whose friends
consider that he has been harshly treat­
ed, and who desire publicity given to the
truth which has been sifted from tlje con
fusion and exoitement attending the
the event. Dr. Hurcourt announces that
he will hereafter practice his profession
in Bismarck.
CANADIANS are quick to foresee the
benefits the American tariff bill will con­
fer upon the Americau farmers. Nat­
urally, in the Domiuion, the McKinloy
bill is not at all popular, for the old time
profits of many articles that have been
going into Canadian coffers will now be
received by the industrious producer on
this
Bide.
In retaliation Canadian far­
mers threaten to feed barley to their
cattle instead of buying western corn, of
which that country imports annually
some threo million bushels. American
traveling men are required to pay a li­
cense in Victoria: and various other
measures are being considered to get
even. But the American producer is
going to be way ahead on the deal.
IF Jay Gould gets control of the
Union Pacific it will be good-bye im­
provements and railway progress. Gould
is the arch enemy of railroad competi­
tion in this country. People living
along the Northern Pacific can rejoice
that Henry Villard is in power and that
his liberal policy is likely to retnaiu not­
withstanding the stock raids on the
company. To the observers of the tre
mendous business this road is doing
there is no warrant for the falling off in
its stocks. Through trains are loaded
both ways and the cars for hauling out
wheat are not to be obtained. The road's
business is the largest in its history.
THE re-election of President Muir as
the chief officer of the Farmers' alliance
was complimentary enough forauy body.
The platform and resolutions were
fervently in line with the national war
whoop of the organization, but under
President Muir's faithful guidance the
North Dakota alliance will not skin alive
any other political party, neither will it
drop into an abysmal tomb of oblivion.
The president and the newspapers will
save it from that. The alliance has done
well in its choice of chief for lfe!)l.
WASHINGTON and Oregon farmers are
feeling the oppression of the elevator
wheat monopoly even worse than their
Dakota brethren. The crop in those
states is a large one. It is claimed there
is an elevator and railroad combine to
secure the bulk of it and move it after­
wards. Prices at the principle points
are 42 to 43 cents a bushel. The pro­
ducers cannot get cars and the elevators
treading upon their necessities are low­
ering the prices until there is nothing
left for the farmers.
IN the Burleigh county legislative dis­
trict the seats of both members of the
house will be contested. On the face of
the returns, Ward, rep., and Yegen, ind.,
were elected. Tuesday Philbrik, de­
feated republican, served notice of con­
test on Yegen, victorious independent,
and within two hours Hare, independent,
filed a contest against Ward, the repub­
lican elected. These are the only two
house contests so far reported. It is
said that six seats in the senate will be
contested.
THE official returns show a total vote
in round numbers of 36,500. Johnson
received 21,365 votes and Benton 14,830
—Johrson's majority, 6,535 Burke's
plurality, 6,439 Allin's majority, 11,696
Flittie's, 1,969 Bray's plurality, 8,054
Booker's majority, 10,236 Spencer's 3,
670 Ogden's, 3,697 Helgesen's, 12,280
Carey's, 12,039. For railroad commis­
sioners, Harmon received 19,058, Walsh
18,590, Slotten 25,531, Low 11,965,
Stevens 16,796, Kinde 12,500, and Turner
4,601.
EVEKY Twin city newspaper is against
Donnelly and will attempt to defeat his
election as president of the Minnesota
Farmers' alliance. This is because the
papers forage on the corporations, who
in turn demand the services of the press
in insisting that no surplus authority or
influence among farmers be rested in the
able champion of the alliance. The far­
mers have many foes in the big cities,
but none more relentless and powerful
than the big newspapers.
THE North Dakota legislature is ex­
pected to do something handsome for the
World's Fair exhibit. Everybody here is
interested, or should be, in obtaining the
best display of cereals at the fair. North
Dakota can take the honor if she tries.
It is thought that 825,000 in addition to
whut the railroad companies will con­
tribute will not be an unDrofitable in­
vestment. The appropriation should be
made this session iu order to obtain the
oest results.
THE St. Paul bar has spotted some at
torneys who have been instigating law
suits, and officiously inter-meddling for a
"divy." Cases where lawyers take fees if
they win personal damage suits against
railroads are the most frequent. The
statement is made that this class of at­
torneys is not exclusively confined to
Minnesota. Every reputable lawyer de­
clines to go foraging around among the
ignorant, vicious, or avaricious for legal
business.
IN his message President Harrison
points with evident pride to the success
of the anti-lottery law. The vigor of its
prosecution, is, no doubt, a presidential
fad. But the president seems to think
that himself and congress were responsi­
ble for this moral renovation. It may be
unkind to rudely disturb this little fancy
but the people of the United States
understand that all the credit for the
law belongs to the St. Paul Pioneer
Press.
THE coming democratic house in con­
gress promises to be a gorgeous public
benefactor in its way. Every species of
free lunch legislation is to be passed,
knowing it can never get by a republican
senate KIHI president. "Anything that
anybody wants" will be the democrats'
rallying cry until the next presidential
election. It is already about decided to
pass a free coinage bill. The next move
will bo fiass an in't gi\ing every man a
mine.
13 lesions buying up about all the sheep
offered for sale in Montana, North Da­
kota is furnishing that state feed. The
Northern Pacific has made a special
tariff rate on hay of 30 couts per hun­
dred from Dickinson to points in Mon­
tana. This is large reduction from the
old tariff rate, says the Dickinson Press,
and is a matter of considerable interest
to that section, as large amounts of hay
are constantly being shipped west.
IGNATIUS DONNELLY desires to be presi­
dent of the Minnesota Farmers' alliance
For along time Mr. Donnelly has worked
hard for the farmers of his state, and has
been a notable leader. The corporations
fight him to the death, but he still sur­
vives,—the endurance of brains against
force and money and monopolistic skill.
The farmers of Minnesota can happily
afford to take the Sage, as a flattering
unction, to their cause.
CONGRESS began its winter term yes­
terday which will close the session
March 4th. The general impression pre­
vails that the republicans will not craw­
fish on legislation enacted and planned
for future passage. This, with the ex­
ception of the federal election bill, is the
only thing to do. The veil before the
temple of democratic tariff sophistries
will be rent long before two years have
expired.
PKESIDENT SPRAGUE of the state uni­
versity is a candidate for the United
States senate. He takes the position
that this office should not be haggled
over and obtained by disreputable wire­
pulling. He is a candidate for the high
office on a platform of political princi­
ples of equal altitude. His views on this
subject are given elsewhere.
PRESIDENT OAKES assures the public
that the Villard management of the
Northern Pacific is not endangered by
Jay Gould, and that the Kockefellers
have no control of the stock. Mr. Oakes
says that Villard is stronger than ever in
the directory—all of which is good to
hear.
THE president's message in substance
will be found elsewhere in The Alert. It
is a straight republican document. It
reviews the situation clearly and can not
but convince republicans of the strength
of the party's position before the coun­
try. It should be read by every citizen.
THE North Dakota Sittings is running
a big paper now. The Alert is glad to
see that it is able to do so—without the
lottery ad. A good many papers were
nnable to do that with Dauphin's as­
sistance. Editor Sheppard must have
made a haul out of the campaign.
THE usual incompetency in the Indian
department seems complicating the In­
dian "war." The differences between the
war and interior department, over the con
duct of the campaign may result the
nearest approach to bloodshed that has
yet been promised.
STATE AUDITOR BKAY desires to notify
all concerned that the joint commission
appointed to settle the affairs of the late
territory of Dakota will hold their last
and final meeting at the capital in Bis­
marck, Dec. 8, next.
THE Fargo Sunday Argus contained a
great deal of valuable information about
North Dakota, given by counties. The
facts were creditably and thoroughly
presented and the issue ought to have a
wide circulation.
THE preachers have begun to explain,
elucidate, elaborate and punctuate the
Messianic craze. The substance of the
sermons seems to be that the poor Indian
has interpreted the scriptures too liter­
ally.
THE official count in the Twenty-sec­
ond legislative district—Eddy, Foster
and Wells counties—gives Patch a ma­
jority of 12 over Wellman and Walton a
majority of 13 over Sanford.
IN his message the president comes
out strong for reciprocity.
Catarrh Can't lie Cured
with LOCAL APPLICATIONS, as they
cannot reach the seat of the disease.
Catarrah is a blood or constitutional
disease, and in order to cure it you have
to take internal remedies. Hall's Catarrh
cure is taken internally, and acts directly
on the blood and mucous surfaces. Hall's
Catarrh Cure is no quack medicine. It
was prescribed by one of the best physi*
cians in this country for years, and is a
regular prescription. It is composed of
the best tonics known, combined with
the best blood purifiers, acting directly
on the mucous surfaces. The perfect
combination of the two ingredients is
what produces such wonderful results in
curing catarrh. Send for testimonials

How Old Hull Keeps Tiling* Stirrcil
Up in the Indian Camp.
The quiet that has xong prevailed at
Ft Lincoln is bioken by the arrivul of
infantry and cavalry. The troops will
no doubt bo kept there to watch the In­
dians and prevent any possible uprising
next spring. Two more companies from
Ft. Keogh arrived Tuesday bring rations
for 80 days. Besides these there are one
battery of artillery fourcompanies of in­
fantry and two troops of cavalry. One
company numbers 51 the other three
companies of infantry rtuch average 40
soldiers while the number of cavalry­
men is 110.
The large building used as a commis­
sary department at the fort was destroy­
ed by fire yesterday evening. Most of the
movable proper was saved. The other
buildings had a narrow oseapo. The tire
caught from an over-heated slove.
Speaking of the miscarriage of Buffalo
Bill's mission, theMandan Pioneer says:
While Buffalo Bill and the other mem­
bers of his party have very little, indeed
to say, it has leaked out that they came
to Mandan instead of stopping at Stand­
ing llock because this is the only avail­
able point that affords an unprejudiced
telegraph office through which they can
send their reoorts and receive their
orders. They believe that Major
McLaughlin used all his influence
against the arrest of Sitting Bull, and
that it is largely due to his advice that
Col. Cody received the orders he did.
Major McLaughlin admits that the ar­
rest should be made, but from the course
he has pursued it is generally believed
that he wants all the credit himself of
handling the unruly old chief, and at the
same time is afraid to take the proper
steps. From »11 that can be learned, and
most of the information comes through
reliable authority, it looks as if things
were getting somewhat mixed at Stand­
ing Rock, and that before long there will
be some very interesting developments.
When the party reached Mandau last
night Col. Cody was feeling somewhat
indisposed from his long ride in the
snow storm, on top of a hurried trip
from the Atlantic coast and a long sea
voyage just prior to that. Ponv Bob
was started out at midnight to see a
doctor and procure necessary medicine.
This morning the colonel was feeling a
little refreshed but seemed to prefer a
comfortable seat by a warm stove to a
promenade out of doors.
While in conversation with a Pioneer
reporter this morning Dr. Powell said:
"One rather strange coincidence oc­
curred on Saturday. While we were on
our way to Sitting Bull's camp, we met
one of his young warriors, whom we
stopped and interviewed. Among other
things he told us that Sitting Bull was
giving all this fine weather to the In­
dians and he wanted to know why the
big white chiefs didn't always give the
whites weather which was good. Buffalo
Bill told him to tell his chief that side
of 24 hours he (Buffalo Bill) would send
a snow storm upon the Indians. That
same night the snow came.
The Pulpit and the Stage.
Rev. F. M. Shrout, pastor United
Brethern church, Blue Mound, Kansas,
says: "I feel it my duty to tell what
wonders Dr. King's New Discovery has
done for me. My lungs were badly
disease:], and my parishioners thought I
could live only a few weeks. I took five
bottles of Dr. Kings New Discovery and
am sound and well, gaining 26 lbs. in
weight.
Arthur Love, manager Love's Funny
Folks combination, writes: "After a
thorough trial and convincing evidence,
I am confident Dr. King's New Discovery
for consumption, beats 'em all, and cures
when everything else fails. The greatest
kindness that I can do my many thous­
and friends is to urge them to try it."

Specimen Cases.
S. H. Clifford, New Cassel, Wis., was
troubled with neuralgia and rheumatism,
his stomach was disordered, his liver was
affected to an alarming degree, appetite
fell away, and he was terribly reduced in
flesh and strength. Three bottles of
Electric Bitters cured him.
Edward Shepherd, Harrisburg, 111.,
had a running sore on his leg of eight
years' standing. Used three bottles of
Electric Bitters and seven boxes of Buck
len's Arnica Salve, and his leg is sound
and well. John Speaker. Catawba, O.,
had five large fever sores on his leg,
doctors said he was incurable. One bot­
tle Electric Bitters and one box Buck
len's Arnica Salve cured him entirely.

Significance In Mourning Color*.
In some portions of the world yellow
and red are the mourning colors the
Orientals generally adopt blue and white,
the Persians wearing a deep indigo, and
the Chinese a somewhat dingy, yellow­
ish white. Pure white was at one time
worn by royal widows in France, but it
afterward fell into disuse. Purple is
the mourning color relegated to the
church. Just at what period black be­
came the fashionable insignia of woe it
Is difficult to determine, but for several
centuries past it has been generally ac­
cepted as such by civilized nations all
over the globe.

"Wanted—A Change.
Old King Solomon" said: "Thero is
nothing new under the sun."' Probably
he made the remark in a fit of disgust
after vainly endeavoring to quiet some
hair-pulling discussion among the thou­
sand ladies who each claimed a share in
him as a husband. At any rate, the
mind of man is so constituted as to de­
sire change, variety, something new. The
world is built on that plan, too. No two
mountains are just alike. No two days
are just the same. No two faces in all
the world's millions are exactly similar.
Shakespere said of one of his characters:
"Age cannot wither or custom stale his
infinite variety." No man likes to have,
or should have, his life always bounded
between four walls. We all like to have
a change of scene now and then to see
new faces, to travel to far countries. The
United States has a greater variety of
climate and scenery within its borders
than aoy of the Old World states. About
now is a good time to plan a journey to
the south—the land of delightful winter
resorts. Low rates are made for excur­
sionists, and "The Burlington" is the
route par excellence, to all points south.

Advice to Mothers.
Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup has
been used by mothers for children teeth­
ing for over fifty years with perfect suc­
cess. It relives the little sufferer at
once, produces natural, quiet sleep by
freeing the child from pain, and the lit­
tle cherub awakes as "bright as a button"
It is very pleasant to taste, soothes the
child, softens the gums, allays the pain,
relieves wind, regulates the bowels and ia
the best known remedy for diarrhoea
whether arising from teething or orther
causes. Twenty-five cents a bottle.
Gratifying to All.
The high position attained and the
universal acceptance and approval of
the pleasant liquid fruit remedy Syrup
of Figs, as the most excellent laxative
known, illustrate the valne of the quali­
ties on which its success iB based sod
are abundantly gratifying to the Cali­
fornia Fig Syrup Company.
