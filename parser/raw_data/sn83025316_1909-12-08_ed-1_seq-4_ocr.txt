ThE MESSAG.
hose .of. us who guessed that the
fIt regular message of President Taft
would be brief were wrong: it slee up,.
as to lenth. with the official com-,
monioattona of Mr. Roos-eelt. Those
of us who have been certain that the
nesawge would be conservative and
eao alteatly republican in Its utter
ine are compelled to make no re
o'f4. of opnion this morning. Two
14e.a are conspicuous in the message;
t hy pe:vrde Its every section. The
pside4.t is for economy In adminis
tretlqi, and he is for the enforcement
t .the law. That the laws may be en
feted with Justice to all. certain
ohknges are urged; that there may be
epeancoy In the administration of the
ountry' affttairs., a buiness-like policy
of .oeducting the nation's busIness la
demanded. Beyond the fact that the
mesiste calls for the fulfillment of re
publit.n pledges, there I. little in It
that is partisan: It breathes the spirit
of broad patrlotism and good citlren
ship. It is the sort of message that
the country expected from Mr. Taft.
who Is. more and more, becoming
recognsled as the presldent of the
whole people.
(UARANTINI REI ULATIONS.
It developed at the conference held
yeste.day In tissoula that the loeo
tealth officers are anxious to enforce
thb health laws, and that their under.
nladhtig is that the smallpox quaran
ttie law is still in full effect and will
be until the end of this month, when
the state board of health proposes ts
abolish the quarantine a. far as it at.
foots smallpox cases. There has beer
considerable local misunderstanding
regarding the situation, and In this
mliunderstanding. it appears. several
of the local doctors have shared to the
extent that they have not thought ii
eaesesary to report to the health offil
ears the existence of smallpox when
they knew it existed. This has re
autted in the unfortunate state of af
fairas which exists In Mis.oula today,
and which may exist in any other
Montana city as soon as the state
board's new regulation goes into ef
fect. It is unfortunate that Missoula
doctors or any of them should have
discounted the future to the extent of
abrogating the quarantine before the
new regulation went into effect; for
the rest of the month we should have
atrict enforcement of the law. and this.
happily. is what we are promised. As
to the state board's new regulation.
there is but little satisfactory defense
of it: certainly there is nothing that
satisfies the average citizen, and he Is
the one most concerned. The MIs
soulian has quoted the Billings (Ga
sette in this matter: here is what the
Litingston Post has to say:
"The reason for the abolishing of
this quarantine is said to have tben
the desire on the part of some of the
health officials to frighten obstinate
persons of tiose who do not believe In
it into belng vaccinated. In other
words, because some officials do not
believ' with the health officials in re
spect to the efficiency of vaccination
as a preventative of small pox and re
fuse to submit to it the rest of the citi
seas are to be placed in danger of con
traetisg the dread disease.
"We can hardly conceive sane think
tag men taking such action as that
taken by the state board of health.
Their action is criminal in the ex
tree. and if a smallpox epidemic.
abould result from failure to quaran
tie any case the blame would rest
with the state board of health.
Ts board under the law has the
rigst to provide msasures for the pro
tection of the health of the people.
That asal~e sad other contagious
diseases sheeld be segregated all wll
aeJs. As to the rvalue of vaccination
tLhoa Is a doubt. and the state board
at health or anyone etle will have a
hard time forcing people Into being
vaccinated. The board can protect the
Ipeogle by quarantining. however, and
it sbould."
HONOR FOR MARCONI.
The statement is made from seem
ingly authentic sources that the next
Nobel prise for physics will be divided
between Signor Marconi and Professor
'Ferdinand Karl Braun of Strassburg
university. Officlal announcement of
the awards for the year will be made
by the 4orwelian storthing day after
tomorrow. The honor will come to
Signor Marconi. who Is equally well
i known on both sides of the Atlantic,
in recognition of his achievements with
wireless telegraphy. Professor Braun
is to share the honor, it is said, because
of his invention of various Improve
ments in the Marconi system of wire
less telegraphy. No authoritative in
timation has been given as to who is
to receive the peace prize or the an
Snual awards for literature, medicine or
chemistry.
The Nobel prises, numbering five, of
the average value of $40,000 each, are
given annually to those who have done i
the most useful work during the year
In literature, physical science, chemis
try. physiology or medicine, and for
the propaganda of p .ace.
K The Nobel foundation, which has the
awqerds in charge, was established by
the Inventor of dynamite, the Swedish
scientist. Alfred Bernhard Nobel, in a
will which he made in 1095. The in-!
ventor's fortune of $9.000,on0 was de
voted to capitalizing the prizes, and
the administration of the foundation
and awards of prisea are in the hands
of th HSwedish learned academies; and,
for the peace prise, a committee of the
Norwegian storthing. The prizes r ere
first awarded in 1901. the distribution
taking place annually on December 10,
the anniversary of Nobel's death.
The prises may be divided and ntry
be given to women, Mme. Curie beinF'
a former winner of the chemistry prc- r
in 1900 President Roosevelt was
awarded the prise for the propaganda I
of peace in recognition of his efforts in
bringing to a" lose the war between
Russia and Japan.
THE STATE UNIVERSITY.
Whatever concerns the state univer-,
sity la of interest to Missoula. There-'
tore, the annual report of President
Dluniway to the state board of edu-,
cation, presented this morning in The!
Missoulian's news columns, nhould
receive consideration In this city. The
development of the university, as re
flected In the president's report has
been dutilg the past year along lines
which ledd to a higher standard of
scholarship and wpore effective student i
work: this has led to something of a
sacrifice as to numbers but In the long
run it will result in the immense bet
terment of the institutlon. It requires
moral courage to chop Into the enroll
Iment figures in an Institution as young
Ias the state university but it is like'
pruning a young tree and ultimately
the wisdom of the course will appear.
There is no doubt that the university!
work is upon a higher plane than ever
before In its history and that is the
main thing.
1'e who believe in vaccination and
who try to comply with sanitary regu
SIlations are. under the plan of the state
board of health. compelled to suffer'
for the error of those who disregard all
these provisions.
The a nd and the snow and the fire
light glow are quite proper things for
December; the man who wants June at
this stagi of the moon should have
sailed south some time last September.
With only about four days for prep
aration. President Taft produced a
message fourteen columns long. It's a
good job for the newspapers that hli
didn't start any earlier.
'Personal liberty in thel matter of
smallpox must be restricted when it lan
terf,'res with the rights of others. Just1
as in any other Infection.
The attitude of the mtate loard of
health toward smallpuo will not tend'
to popularise the official school text
book issued by the board.
The, local health officers say they
are anxious to enforce the laws: doe
tors who do not report contagious dis
eases should be punished.
The pilgritms a ho sought to escape'
winter by going to aos Angetles will
have to journey on to Nicaragua,
where it is always warla,,
Moreover. It appears that James W. (
'offruoth over-estimatedl his masticat- a
ing powers when he bit off the J.-J. t
prise tight.
The proteat of the booster club and
of the city council served at least to n
bring out information as to where we
are at.
While President Taft regrets that the
sugar frauds existed Ire la in no way
sorry that they have I~-wnt found out.
t'tah won't have' it. and California
doesn't want the- big tight. The west I
