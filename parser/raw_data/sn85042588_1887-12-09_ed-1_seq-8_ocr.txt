of Blaine?

as to a candidate

ideas?

any reduction of taxation
Mr. Nelson replied:

present
3. Yes, I think his message was well put
and right to the point, and it dealt on the
most prominent and important and popu­
lar questions of the day.
4. Just as far as it is possible to go. I
would like to have as many of the neces­
saries of life put on the free trade list as
possible ana have the taxes retained on
whisky and tobacco.

Which
Some Recently Discovered Fact*
Make Him Unpopular.
CINCINNATI, Deo. 8.—'The close of the
government's testimony in the Harper trial
came just after two sensational revela­
tions, that of the attempt to bribe District
Attorney Burnett and the publication of
Harper's and Miss Josie Holmes' love let­
ters. The result of the first was to lead
the attorneys for the defense to require a
statement in court from Mr. Burnett, exon­
erating them from any connection with
the attempted bribery. There was no de­
nial of the fact, only the shifting of the
burden to other shoulders. The love let
ters make a world of sympathy for poor
Mrs. Harper, but create a correspondingly
hard feeling against Harper. The jury
has been cautioned against reading news­
papers, but not commanded to let them
alone.
