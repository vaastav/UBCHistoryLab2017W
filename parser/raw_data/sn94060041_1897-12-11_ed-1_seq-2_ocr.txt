Accomac Court House, Va.
Saturday, December 11, 1897.
Entered at the Postoffice at Accomac
C. K., Va., as second-class matter.
The members of our present Legis?
lature have gotten down to work
earlier this session thau usual and
there seems to be no question of
their purpose to respect the demands
made and pledges given to their
constituents, to do all in their power
to cut down the State expenses, if
the number of bills introduced by
them looking to that object furnishes
any criterion by which to judge them.
There is indeed no reason to doubt
their willingness to apply the prun?
ing knife in that respect, but it looks
as if their labors might be in vain,
tinless their schemes to that end are
better matured and there is more
concert of aetioujamong them. Hasty
legislation is often bad legistation,
and more is likely tobe accomplished
if they proceed with more delibera
tion, instead, of making two much
haste as many of them now seem
to be doing in their zeal for retrench
inent and reform. Among the plans
presented, one is for placing all the
expenses upon the counties, another
is for each county to bear the expense
of prosecuting all misdemeanor cases
and still another is to require all
charges for criminal expenses to be
approved by the Board of Supervis.
ors before they are sent to the audi?
tor for payment The suggestion
which seems to meet with most fa?
vor is lor the cities and towns to bear
all the expenses of misdemeanor
cases and the commonwealth those
for felonious.
Hon. S. W. Matthews has intro?
duced into the Legislature, a bill to
regulate the size of barrels used for
the shipment of agricultural pro?
ducts, commonly called trucks. The
measure provides that it should be
unlawiul for any person to use in
such shipments a barrel of less size
and dimensions than as follows:
Heads and ends not less than sever
teen inches, staves not less than
twentyseven and one half inches,
inside measurement at bulge not less
than eighteen and one hatf incite;'
and height of barrel not less than
twenty-six inches. Any person vio?
lating the above provisions shall be
lined not less than one nor more
than three dollars, and any person
cr coiporation manufacturing or of
fering for sale, after August 10, IS'jS,
shall be liable to the same punish?
ment. The same 'bill was before our
last Legislatur.-1 and defeated under a
misapprehension of some of the rep?
resentatives from the appie districts*
This year, it is stated, that no objec"
tion will be raised Irom that quarter,
and the losses incurred by most of
cur farmers, in not having a barrel
of uniform size for several years past,
will certainly cause them to approve
the bill and favor its passage.
The fifty fifth Congress met in reg?
ular session at noon on Monday, and
t he President's message submitted to
that body and read, is generally ac?
cepted as a very creditable S^ate
paper. At least the republicans are
pleased with it and praise it as an
able document and the democrats, if
it does not suit them, seem for the
most part to have witheld their eriti
cisms, because of the patriotic senti
ments it contained. The subjects
treated by him are such, as were ex?
pected?and his views on many of
them are two much in accord with
those of many democrats to be very
severely criticised by them. Of
course, they differ with him in bis
views on the currency question and
condemn that part of the message,
indicating an intention on the part
of the President 'to give gold a fur?
ther superiority over silver as money.'
A summary of the message is presen?
ted in another column.
Hon. John W. Daniel, as was ex?
pected and as all Virginia demanded,
will succeed himself as United States
Senator from Virginia. He was
unanimously renominated by the|
democratic legislative caucus on the
third day of the session and has since
shown his appreciation of the honor
conferred upon him by the following
telegram to the General Assembly:
"I pray you present my heartfelt
gratitude to my Democratic brethren
of the General Assembly, for the le
Dewed and signal expression of their
confidence implied by my nomination
to succeed myself in the United
States Senate. That honor gathers
its greatest charm in the generous
manner in which it has been bestow?
ed, and renewing to all who tender
it, and to our beloved Commonwealth
the pledges of my devotion, I accept
it with the deepest sense of obliga?
tion and the hishest inspiration to
faithful endeavor."
The appointment of Professor F.
P. Brent, as secretary, of the State
Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion, is a just recognition of the East?
ern Shore and very gratifying to our
people. It ought to be the steppiug
stone later to the position of Super?
intendent,and will be.if his qualifica?
tions have the recognition they de?
serve.
The vote cast in May last on the
question calling a constitutional
convention has been canvassed by
the Legislature and is as follows:
Total vote, 121,779; for amendment, j
58,336; against amendment, 83,453. i
Summary of President's Message
Tho message opens with .in expre?^
sion of satisfaction "at the growing
spirit of fraternal regard and unifica?
tion in all sections of our country,
aud the lifting of great public ques
tious above party prejudice."
The subject, of greatest importance
is the revision of the currency, anil
President McKinley discusses it at
length. He says, that Congress
ought not to hesitate now to enter
upon a reform of the currency which
will make our demand obligations
less onerous to the government and
relieve our financial laws from ambi?
guity and doubt. It is manifest, he
says, that we must devise some plan
to protect the government against
bond issues for repeated redemptions.
If this evil is nor correct oil
by legislation, the President suggests
that the Secretary of the Treasury
be authorized by Congress to sell
bonds at long or short periods bear
ing a less rate of interest than is now
authorized by law. The President
also recommends that, as soon as the
receipts of tho government are sufli
L-ient to pay all its expenses, all Uni
ted States notes, after their redemp?
tion in gold, shall be set apart aud
only be paid out again for gold.
The President invites careful con?
sideration by Cougrtss of Secretary
Gage's plan to protect the gold re?
serve, and concurs with tho Secretary
rbat national bauks be allowed to is
sue notes to the face value of their
bonds deposited; that the circulating
tax be reduced to one- half of one per
cent-., and that national banks may
he established with a capital of
$2f).000. He also recommends that
the issue of national bank notes be
restricted to the denomination of $10
aud upward, aud that they bo re
quired to redeem their notes in gold.
The President devotes much space
in his message to a consideration of
the Cubau question. He outlines bis
recent instructions to Miuister Wool
ford, which were to impress upon the
Spanish government the sincere wish
of the United Stutes to aid iu t-rmi
uatiug the war by peaceful methods,
accomplishing a resuit which would
be just aud honorable to Spaiu and
to t he Cuban people. It was also
made known to the Spanish govern?
ment that the United Stares could
not contemplate an indefinite i eriod
tor the accomplishment of this result
Sptiiu's response was an announce
ineut of its change of policy, the re?
call of Weyler aud the proposition to
bestow autonomy upon the Cubans,
lie says that it is honestly due to
Spain that it be given a reasonable
rime iu which to test its new policy.
Present conditions iu Cuba do not
justify the recognition of the bellig?
erent rights of the insurgents, nor of
their independence. The President
declares, in conclusion, that "the
uear future will demonstrate whether
a righteous peace is likely to be at?
tained; if not," be adds, "the exigen?
cy of further and other action by the
L'uited States will remain to be
taken.1'
He heartily approves the annex?
ation Of Hawaii, aud says that, while
abrupt assimilation of the immature
elements of its population should be
avoided, just provision sLould be
made for self rule in local matters,
with the largest political liberty to
rhe Hawaiians. The dispute betweeu
Japan and Hawaii over the immi?
gration question he declares to be in
a satisfactory stage of settlement bv
negotiation without the intervention
of the government of the United
States.
While the international monetary
commission failed to secure an agree
uieut for international bimetallism,
gratification is expressed at the action
of France, and it is said the negotia
tions are still pending. The Presi?
dent expresses rhe hope that the
labors ot the commissions may bring
about an agreement.
The opinion is expressed that by
reciprocity arrangements under the
tariff act the volume of our commer
cial exchanges may be enlarged. The
President earnestly hopes for the im
provement of our merchant marine,
? he inferiority of which, he says, is
humiliating to our national pride;
International arbitration is indorsed
by the President and declared to rep?
resent the best sentiment of the civi
lized world. A liberal appropriation
is urged for a creditable exhibit at
the approaching Paris Exposition.
The President urges speedy legis
lation to procure armor for the three
battle ships now building, and says
that for a time any increase in the
naval equipment should take the
form of increased facilities for our
vessels. He urges that three or four
ol the largest docks should be pro?
vided on the Atlantic coast, at least
one on the Pacific coast and a float
ing dock in the Gulf. He indorses
the proposed increase in the number
of officers and enlisted men, and
recommends an appropriation for
only one more battle ship. He thinks
several additional torpedo boats are
required.
Attention is called to the need for
prompt legislation as to Alaska and
the extension of civil authority with
in the Territory. The President ap
proves the suggestion of. the Secre?
tary of the Treasury for an extension
of the quarantine laws, aud also rec?
ommends the appointment of a
special commission to ascertain the
cause of yellow fever. Referring to
the pendiugsale of the Kansas Pacific
Railroad, the President states that
the Secretary of the Treasury has
been instructed to bid at the sale a
sum equal to the principal of the
debt to the Government.
Referring to the civil service law,
the President says the system has
the approval of the people, and it
will be his endeavor to uphold aud
extend it. At the same time the
President declares that he shall Dot
hesitate to exempt cases which he
thinks have been improperly includ?
ed in the classified service, or to in?
clude those which, in his judgment
will best promote the. good of the
service.
In conclusion the President urges
Congress not to encourage the in?
crease of the estimates for the main?
tenance of the government. On the
other hand, these estimates, he
thinks, will admit of a decrease in
many branches, and be adds that it
is a commanding duty to keep the
appropriations within the receipts of
the government and thus avoid a
deficit.?Baltimore Sun
