A VERY TEMl'TIXV OFFER AXD A
GREATER (J LORY.
Tho Rev. Mr. Ik'rry,of Wolvcrhaiiiplon,
England, who waa recently called to takft
tho placo in tho Plymouth Church. Brook
lyn, vacated by tho death of tho lamented
Jlcochrr, IIikIs It more diflicnlt than ho at
first thought It would lo Ut never hia re
lationa with tho people to whom ho is yet
a beloved pastor. Tho Congregational
Church of England alno makes a claim to
hia wrviees in tho conduit which all men
confess cannot now be much lonjpT do
layed -tho discKtabliiilinient of the KukImIi
Church. : Every InWnter of anility will,
when that eontcHt cornea, bo needed to
counteract tlio iufliteneea of the IXahliHh
ment which will only amrendor ita polit
ical prerogatives nt thn end ot a death
atrn'le. A eakcr of clixiuenco an
commanding ami perHtuutivo aa Mr.
IVrry, would bo a tower if atrength
in audi a war, and England will need him.
It w ill be a war in which tho "Iorla apir
itual" of the IfoiiNO of Iorda will find
tliemnclvca weighed, for all that they arc aa
dignitaries usurping places and function
It would havcliecn better for tho Knglmh
Church they had voluntarily aurrendered
yearn ago. Tho place of theao blHhopa in
the State baa always horn a falae one, but
there was perhaps aotne rxcuau fur it iu
tho days when England was atruggling
for national unity and Htrrngth and while
men Mill believed iu "tho Iirila' anoint
ed." There is noue now. Ever ainco
Catholic ciuanclpatinn, when it was
mado plainer thatl ever that the
voluntary principle was the true
one fur church supiort and HiiKtcnauce, it
has been evident to thinking men that it
was only a ipiiMtiou of time when thn I
tahliidicd Church would have to lie cut ofl
from the corrupting inlbieiiees uf politic,
partica mi l the court, when Iho trade iu
"living" would havo to come to an
end, and the scandal of a church governed
in its economic by nou-lK'lievcr
and even scoib ra at its muxt n:ic red tli inga
m UN t forever bo aupiireiwi'd. The Free
Climvli movement in.S-olland was a noble
rlliirt at n lcaao from this degrading thral
dom, and tliediHeatalilihliment of the Iriah
Church by Mr. (ila Intone In 1H7(71 mado

Hie protravt of helping in such a work is
enough to stir tho blood of a hermit, and
we wonder that Mr. Ilcrry hesitated a mo
ment between tho plulfurmof Plymouth,
wotld-liotorious though It la, and the
whole field of England and Wale with the

lieing a fair-minded ami honest-spoken
man, he ennunt say or do leas for us than
recommend n continuance f tho work
which has brought about these results and

factory preaentod lo Congress, and beaidei
iuvahinblo information, conveys aomo
crpially invaluablo suggestions, which no
doubt Congress w ill ad uikui. As to tho
Court of Claims, he says that to tho ordi

disponition of f 13,20,000, nro now pend
ing), have been added 1,81'J cases under
tho Bowman act, involving $SO,000,(KH3,

claimant ask for about $!0,000,000.
Elghty-ono of these last named eases havo

recommends that the court ahull lie em

action of Congress, and that tho parties iu
such suits shall have tho right to appeal
from tho court's decision to tho Supreme
Court.

R. G. DUN & CO.'S REVIEW.
STATE OF TRADES DURING THK WEEK
IN ALL BRANCHES.
Legitimate Business Fairly Aotlve,
Though Somewhat Embarrassed by
Fluctuation In Speculative Market
Effect of Tariff Agitation.
New Yohk, Dec. 0. R. G. Dun A Co.'s
weekly review of trade says legitimate
trade continues fairly active for the season.
though embarrassed in some branches by
thu fluctuations in speculative market.
Speculation in products, after a few days
of wild advance, baa taken a turn down
ward, ns tho natural result of enormous
sales to rcnlizo. With rapidly expanding
currency, money is generally easier than
a week ago, though rates are still high at
many points, and complaints of slow
collections do not diminish. Agitation of
the tariir question already begin to
cause revision of calculations for tho fut
ure, in some department. Tho sharp de
cline, in real estate speculations and price
nt some southern nnd western point tends
to check developments there, and subjects
investors to some financial strain. Ijirge
Rales of botscmcr iron at $18 50 arc re
