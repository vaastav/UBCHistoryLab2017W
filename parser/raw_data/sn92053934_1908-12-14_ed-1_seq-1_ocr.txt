IX STATE OP DEFENSE.
Caracas, Dec. 13. (Delayed.) News
of the capture of the guardship Alexis
by a Dutch cruiser Saturday became
known in Caracas this morning. A
big crowd at once assembled in the
Plaza Bolivar and demonstrated in sup
port of the government. A decree is
sued by Acting Presiderit Gomez pla.ces
the republic in a state of defense.
Within ItlKhtn In Selaure. '
The Hague, Dec. 14. The govern
ment of the Netherlands is satisfied it
was quite within its rights, from the
standpoint of international law, in
seizing the Venezuelan coast guard
ship Alexis off Puerto Cabello last Sat
urday. The Alexis was suspected of
carrying munitions of war from one
Venezuelan port to another.
Rumors that war had been declared
today are denied.
MnkfH First Capture.
Willemstad, Island of Curacao, Dec.
14. The Dutch cruiser Celderland
came into this port yesterday morning,
towing the Venezuelan coast guard
ship Alexis; with the Dutch flag flying
mid a Dutch crew on board.
The Celderland captured the Alexis off
Puerto Cabello on Saturday. At that
time the Alexis was lying close in shore
and, notwithstanding the threat which
the Venezuelan government had made
to fire upon any of the Dutch warships
committing a hostile" act the t&ldef
land steamed at speed to the guard-
ship and sent an officer and guard in
a launch to seize it. This they did
without resistance and no shots came
from the forts on land,
The crew of the Alexis was put ashore
and the Dutch officer and marines re
mained on board, the Celderland final
ly taking the Alexis in tow and steamin
away with the prize.
Follow Holliinil'M Plan.
The seizure of the Alexis was in ac
cordance with the plans of the Hol
land government when instructions
were issued to the three Dutch war
ships now in these waters to make a
demonstration off the coast of Vene
zuela and to capture any Venezuela
ships of war or guard vessels that they
might find.
The arrival of the Celderland at Wil
lemstad was greeted with unbounded
enthusiasm by those who noticed the
cruiser's approach, and soon the en
tire population was down to the wa
ter's edge to welcome the return of
the Celderland, towing the first of the
enemy's ships, as though from a great
conquest. ,
Cripple the Republic,
Naturally the people of Curacao, who
have long been clamoring for activity
on the part of the Dutch government,
are greatly rejoiced over this evidence
that Holland has at least begun active
been forwarded by the Dutch govern
ment to the German minister at Car
acas." Deinonatration In Expected.
It is learned from the officers of the
Gelderland that the battleship Jacob
van Heemskerk and the cruiser Fries
land are now off La Guaira and that
further captures may be expected at
any time. These two vessels left here
Friday, cleared for action, and it was
believed at that time that the intention
was to make a forcible demonstration
at La Guaira.
The opinion is held here that the
Venezuelan government, in the ab
sence of President Castro, will not go
so far as to fire upon the Dutch war
ships, whichv in view of the fact that
Venezuela is practically with a
navy, hold the Venezuelan ports at
their mercy.
Enter a Froteat.
Caracas, Dec. 11. (Delayed.) For
eign Minister Paul sent a note today
to members of the diplomatic corps
here protesting against repeated viola'
tions of the territorial rights of Vene
zuela by the three Dutch warships that
have been cruising in Venezuelan
waters since Dec 2. No blockade had
been declared, so it is set forth, but
continued interference with coastwise
shipping is having a detrimental ef
feet upon cemmerce of neutral powers.
llolilx Dutch to Account,
In conclusion the foreign minister
says: Venezuela protests witn energy
against these aggressions upon terri
torial sovereignty of the republic
and she holds Holland responsible for
all consequences."

Milwaukee, Dec. 14. Judge Ludwig

'resident Completes Special Message
Dealing With the Panama
Canal Scandal
MAKES ANSWER TO CHARGES
Demands Full Investigation of Story
That Americans Participated
in Profits.
ashington, Dec. 14. Secretary of
Arglculture James Wilson, in his 12th
annual report to President Roosevelt,
declares farm products of 1908 make a
new record in the country's history.
American farms are reported to have
exceeded the mines fourfold, albeit
oil and precious metals are included
in the showing of the latter.
Corn is declared king in the detailed
account of cereals, staples, tubers, and
the dethroned monarch cotton. Cot
ton takes second place in value.
The hay yield makes a new record
is the greatest ever reported and thus
helps the remarkable showing of agri
cultural products in. general.
Near Eight Billion Yield.
In its resume of values, the secre
tary's report shows the farm value of
all farm products to have reached "the
most extraordinary total in the nation's
history 17,778,000,000. The farmer,1
It is added, "contributes 87 per cent of
the raw materials used in those manu
facturing industries which depend most
ly or considerably upon agricultural
materials, and these industries use 42
per cent of all materials used in all
industries.
"Greatest of all crops is Indian corn
whose production this year is 2,043,000,
000 bushels. The value of this crop is
$1,015,000,000. Compared with the av
erage of the preceding five years the
quality is 2 per cent higher and the
value 43 per cent higher.
Cotton Ahead of Hay.
"It seems likely that the cotton crop
is one of the highest three ever, pro
duced, but with a value next to the
highest or perhaps more, and although
the farm price of cotton this year is
below the price of last year by more
than 1 per cent. For the first time in
the history of this country's agricul
ture the value of the cotton crop, in
cluding seed, has apparently exceeded
the' value of the hay crop, which has
heretofore held second place.
"The greatest hay 'crop in history
has been gathered this year, 68,000,000
tons, or 12 per cent above the average
of the preceding five years. Its price
is $Z per ton less than it was a year
ago, but still the farm value of the
crop is $621,000,000, or 6 per cent
above the five year average.
"Wheat Is lk per cent above the
five year average in production and 23
per '.cent above in total value. The
660,000,000 bushels of this crop are es
timated to be worth $620,000,000 to
the farmers, or $66,000,000 more than
the most valuable wheat crop hereto
fore produced.''
Washington, Dec' 14. President
Roosevelt yesterday completed the
final draft of a long statement on the
subject of the Panama canal contro
versy and sent it to the government
printing office to be put in type. It is
expected that it will go to congress in
the form of a special message at oiice.
In this the president is understood
to answer all the allegations which
have been made against the regularity
and propriety of the purchase of the
canal, including the statements that
Americans participated in sharing the
purchase money. He wants the full
est light thrown on the matter. It is
his desire that no one should be shield
ed. If he cannot get at the facts by
a trial for criminal libel he wants them
brought out by a congressional investi
gation. But he wants the truth known
and is confident it will confound the
critics.
At Work for n Week.
The document is the result of nearly
a week's incessant work by the presi
dent and his advisers. The final con
ference was held yesterday, when the
president summoned the White house
attaches, from Secretary Loeb down
and also Invited Secretary Root and
Senator Lodge to meet him. . All call
ers were informed that the offices were
closed and that no one would be ad
mitted. The president and Secretary
Loeb denied themselves to all callers.

Washington, Dec. 14. President
Roosevelt today submitted to the sen
ate the report of H.erbert J. Browne,
employed by the government in in
vestigating the Brownsville affair.
The president says:
"I enclose herewith a letter from
the secertary of war transmitting a
report of 'the investigation made by
Herbert J. Browne, employed by the
department in conjunction with Cap
tain W. G. Baldwin to investigate as
far as possible what happened at
Colon, Dec. 14. A giant blast of
dynamite, already prepared for firing,
exploded in the canal workings at Bas
Obispo Saturday afternoon. At least
10 men were killed and 50 injured.
Bas Obispo cut is about 30 miles from
Colon and the shock of the explosion
was distinctly felt here.
Numerous reports are current as to
the cause of the. accident, but the offi
cial version from Culebra, which gives
the estimate of 10 killed and 50 wound
ed, states that during the loading of
the last hole of the blast the dynamite
in -this cutting "'Was discharged" and
the remaining 22 tons were exploded
by concussion. The holes had not
been connected electrically as the dis
charge of the blast was set for 5
o'clock in the afternoon. The last
hole was being loaded under the super
vision of one of the most efficient
powder men in the employ of the commission.
