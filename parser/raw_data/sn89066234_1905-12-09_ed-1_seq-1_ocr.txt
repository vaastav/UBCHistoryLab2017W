CONVICTED AGAIN.
For the second time the Honorable
Joseph Itnlph Burton, lawyer nnd
statesman nud United States Sena
tor from Knnsns, has been convicted
jof boodllng. '
Hut the Honorable Ralph Im not in
prison.
Oli, no I
To the contrary the Honorable
Balph continue towenrgood clothes
mid eat good grub while such honor
able men us Richard C. Kerens go his
bondduringthcnppeulto"tnamnm."
And you know "mamma." She's
good to the big rascals.
Now let im examine this Hurton
Kerenn nffuir a bit. Ai a representa
tive of the people of Kansas Mr.
Burtoodrew 93,000 a year nnd ex
pense from tlie public treasury.
Mind you, this mentis about $10,000
a year.
Such men ride on railroad passes
and charge the trip up to you.
They have "Franking" privileges
over telegraph, telephone and ex
press nnd charge it up to you.
They luie postal and other prlv-1
lieges that are charged up to you
And I want to inject here that a
United Stnto senator cannot plead,
ns Sum Cook did when he was caught
with the "goods on him," thnt he
was proprietor of a country paper
and was riding on a pass on that
account and not ns a Btate official.
Ham says he is n Democrat and
Ralph In a Republican. I would as
HiKin loan to one a quarter as to the
other. Hither would pay it back if
he thought In1 could get me for fifty
cents the next time. If he expected
no further favors I don't know what
would happen.
Hut let us return to Mr. Hurton.
He was drawing a salary from the
people to look after their interest
ami protect them. At the same time
he imnuiitcd n most lawyers do
that he had a right to accept a "fee"
on the side to promote some individ
ual enterprise.
A get rich-quick concern known ns
the Itiiilto (irain and Investment Co.
started up in St. Louis. The capital
stock of such u concern is mail facil
ities. If they can get their gullible
stuff before the public through the
mails their success is assured for the
time being at least.
The St. Louis concern employed as
their attorney United States Senator
Hurton, of Kansas (tium Shoe Hill
hud just emerged from a baking
powder scrape, with a tainted repu
tation). Mr. Hurton received $300
per mouth as "uttorney fee" from
the Rialto company to work the
"rabbit's foot" over the postal de
partment in a way that would cause
' the postal department to not inter
fere with the Rialto Co. In its hold-up
of the people.
Senator Burton played his part
and drew his ",00 per month from
the get-rich-quick concern, and ev
erything worked well until the gen
eral upheaval caused by the "an
archists." But Burton is no worse than nine
ty per cent of the men in the United
States Senate. Quite all are there for
some purpose other than serving the
people.
The United States Senate is the
highest law-making body in the na
tion. .It is composed chiefly of very
rich men and is known as the "Mil
lionaires Club."
We flud there the Honorable
Chauncey M. Depew, president of the
New York Central Rullway and a di
rector in several hundred other cor
porations. As a director of the
Equitable Life Insurance Company
-we find him loaning himself two dol
lars on one dollur's worth of securi
ty, and then letting the company
:tuke the security.
Then we had as a United States
.. Senator the Honorable Thomus C.
Fhitt, boss of the express business of
-.the United States. And yet people
-wonder wliy express companies are
permitted to rob them.
And if I had the time nnd space
and thought you were sufficiently in
terested 1 could tell you why the va
rlous ducks that are styled "honora
tie" occupy preferred positions
among you.
I have always said nnd still
tick to it that you can unearth
nothing anywhere that I cannot do
plicate right here In Scott county
only in a smaller way.
Take the men in whose favor the
hardest fights have been made in
Scott county and-were they not rep
resented as tbe "only fit men ?"
For the most part these tneu were
good neighbors and good men so far
' a the affairs with which-they were
familiar were concerned. It was be
cause of this good reputation that
t they were centered on by the pollti
lions who had no motive beyond that
61 betas able to ADVI8E them.
At object leeeone I point, to such

RAILROAD RATE NONSENSE.
There has lieen a great hub-bub all
over the country about Roosevelt
going to regulate railroad rates go
ing to "fix" rates. Even Mr. Bryan
has been shouting "Hooray for Ted
dy 1" and patting the president on
the back.
Hut there are some of us who favor
the public ownership of railroads
that could see through the farce
from the beginning. As they always
do when they want to carry a point,
the ruilronds have pretended to be
bitterly opposed to this "fixing" of
rates where, in reality, they are the
only ones really clamoring for it.
The Dunklin Democrat says:
Old Senator Moriran. of Alubamn.
known as a great constitutional law
yer, says that the constitution will
not permit oi sucn rauroau rate leg
islation us President Roosevelt sug
gests. It is probably true. It is
most pronaoiy also a met mat tne
president knows it. All talk of regu
lating railroad rates by the federal
government is mere buncombe stuff
to be fed to innocent voters. And
when the states attempt regulation
of freight robbery, there is always a
convenient federal judge reddy to is
sue an injunction.
To support his contention that
"there is always a convenient federal
judge ready to issue an injunction"
the Democrat points to the recent
decision of Judge Bethea, In tbe
Federal court at Chicago. It seems
that Missouri railroads have been
carrying dressed meat for the pack'
ers at a much lower rate than live
stock for the farmers, and t.h Inter
state Commerce commission ordered
the rate on stock lowered to corres
pond with the rates on dressod meat
Of course the railroads appealed
to "mamma." And, oh, how good
mamma Is to the railroads. In sum
mlng up the case, Judge Bethea de
clared that there was no evidence of
collusion on the part of the railroads,
und that the rates on live stock was
not a discrimination.' He held, fur
ther, that the interstate commerce
decree was not binding on the rail
roads and thnt the commission had
not the power to compel the railroads
to obey their rulings.
There yon are a federal judge says
that the interstate commerce
commission has no power to
"compel railroads to obey their rul
Inge." Now I would like to ask the
learned judge why the. people are
taxed to keep up the bunch of inter
state commerce commissioners it
they have no power and are therefore
useless?
But, then, these judges are "soup-
ream" ana aon t nave to answer iooi
queetlone.

THE PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE.
On the second page of this paper
appears a synopsis of the President's
message to congress. President's
messages are becoming so "windy"
that newspaper space is too valua
ble to print them in full and a
great majority of the people cure
little or nothing about them.
In fact, there is but little infor
mation to be gained by'one not fam
iliar with "reading between the
lines," nnd the stuff rends more like
milk and cider political stump
speech than nn important docu
ment.
Let us take, for instance, the Pres
ident's review of railroad rata regu
lation. This seems to be the "para
mount issue" just now. The present
trouble is that the Inter-State Com
merce Commission is supposed to
stand between the people and the
railroads, but has no power to en.
force its commands. The commis
sion can decide that railroads must
do this or that, but the roads apply
to their Federal judges and enjoin
the commission from interfering.
In other words, the commission can
demand that railroads do certain
things, but has no way of enforcing
its demands.
And now comes the President and
recommends "a competent adminis
trative body" with power to go
nfter tho railroads, and that their
decree is to go into effect, "subject
to review by the courts."
Why, bless you, Mr. President,
that is exactly what we have now;
uu Interstate Commerce commission
(cull it a "competent administrative
body" if you think it will help to
coufuse) whose acts ure "subject to
review by the courts.
And so long as the railroads cau
appeal to "mamma" they wont
mind what your "competent admin
istrative, body" does.
THE SOUTHEAST.
Hayti Argus: The way that courts
are conducted in the stateof Missou
ri oftimes works great hardships on
witnesses. A docket for all cases to
be tried at n term of circuit court is
made out, appointing a time for
each case. The sheriff is given sub
poenas for the witnesses und far and
near, each must attend that day. If
the case is not tried, or not even
called," the witnesses are bound In
law to attend upon the court with
out further notice day after day,
and even year after year, until the
case is disposed of, or if not, subject
tnemseives to a nne. mere never
was a bigger piece of injustice prac
ticed upon law abiding people. A
citizen, no matter how urgent his
own business or how pressing the
needs of his family, must neglect all
nnd give himself, body nnd soul, to
the caprices of courts nnd litigeuts.
The witness must pay his own ex
fienses and devote his time to hang
ng around the court house door.
Irs an expense, besides, to the coun
ty and state, and often works injus
tice to one side or the other by
"freezing out" witnesses, the trial
being forced into court on a day not
at first set. If all cases were tried or
disposed of on the day and time set,
it would save much needless expense
and worry. It could and should be
done.

BIG FIRE AT ORAN.
Oran, Mo., December 4.
The prediction that it was only a
mutter of time until Oran would be
swept by fire was verified Thursday
night. Owing to the construction of
many of the buildings, being mere
fire traps, the only wonder is that the
lire had not taken place earlier.
At 10:10 Thursday night the alarm
'of lire was sounded and smoke was
iseeii coniiiiL' from the T. A. Cooksy
I saloon building. From this build
j ing the light frame structures to the
least and north were soon on fire and
J only added fuel to the Humes. Not
I until all the buildings fronting on
lltadcliffe street up to and including
the hotel property of Rev. M. Helm
buohernnd on the I. M. Ry. north
to the Letnp Brewery Co.'s ice house
were consumed, was the Are In
that part of town got under control.
At first it was thought, that all the
buildings south of Radcliffe street
might be saved, but the heat from
the burning buildings was so intense
that these buildings were soon de
stroyed. The buildings burned and
the los, as near ns can now be ap
proximated, is about as here given:

MOHLEY STAYS DItY.
It was u warm time the people of
Morley had in Denton last Monday.
The saloon petition of .lohusou und
Frohuse came up for hearing before
the county court and it is evident
that a majority of the people of
Morley are in earnest about keeping
out a saloon.
In huge numbers the Morleyites
arrived and ail seemed to have their
"tiirhting clothes" on.
Attorney .1. Val linker, of More
house, ably assisted by ltev. Howie
and others, stood up against the
petition, and Judge O'ltryan, of
Chariest ou, represented the peti
tioners.
It was somewhat surprising to see
Judge O' Bryan occupying the place
of the uttorney-general for the Re
tail Liquor Dealers Association, but
this was explained when it was an
nounced that the attorney-general
had engaged in a 'steen round con
test with Prof. Uooio and got very
much the worst of it.
It was shown to the satisfaction of
the court that the petition was ir
regular nnd the matter was dismiss
ed.
There is reason to believe that
Morley will remain a "dry" town.
In that event what will they do
