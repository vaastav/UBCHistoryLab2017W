TELEGRAPHIC MARKET LETTER
Chicago, Dec. 9.—Wheat: Cables
were higher in response to our ad%
vance Saturday.. Our market opened
%c lower and on very heavy selling
the market became weak and sold l^jc
below Saiburdaiy's high point.
There has been some rainfall in the
winter wheat belt and this was what
caused the selling. The selling has
been mostly by local traders though
and the country holds on. The vis­
ible shows an increase of only a little
over two million bushels "Which has
served to help the market. Wheart
recovered some of the early loss and
sold up to 7814 for May but another
selling movement set in and it was
knocked down, to TTOc at which point
some suport was given the market and
^prices stiffened up considerably. This
decline in wheat is but natural and we
look for another boom and think it is
a purchase on any recessions for good
stiff profit During the last hour
•wheat made up the loss of the early
trading and gained l.^c over the open­
ing selling at 79%c.
Coorn has been weak also, selling off
l%c from Saturday on heavy selling.
At the low point some buying orders
•came in and/the price worked up %c
where it held steady, then sold up lc,
closing a trifle lower than yesterday.
Oats have shared the weakness of
wheat and corn and sold off l%c.
Around 46c there -was some good buy­
ing and the market became strong and
took a shoot up.
Provisions were some lower on early
realizing, but a decided strong under­
tone developed and- May pork sold 10c
higher than yesterday in sympathy
with the strength shown in the last
liour in coarse grains.
FINANCIAL SUMMARY.
New York, Dec.
9.—The
stock
mar,
keffc was weak today. Money rates
were marked to 7 per cent in the early
trading and stock values suffered
sharply. Enormous liquidation fol­
lowed calling off loans. Later the
money rate eased off and a more cheer­
ful feeling-followted, stocks advancing
all through the list. Copper shares
were well bought and it begins to look
as if the liquidation in this class of
securities was over. We do not ex­
pect much bulge in the stock market
until after January 1st
CLESWS' WEEKLY LETTER.
New York, Dec. 8.—The situation in
some respects is very remarkable.
Never before were stocks so highly
concentrated and the steadying power
resulting from this process is*'highly
significant Apparently the powers In
control -are able to hold the market
impregnable against all ordinary as­
saults and white this situation lasts
judgment must be directed according
ly.§ ,Aft theeame time stocks are being
slowly scattefled, and the large sums
off monies seeking investment may en­
able the market leaders to successfully
lighten their burden if prosperity con­
tinues sufficiently long as some axe
bold enough to believe it will. But
the business situation is spotty. Great
activity is apparent in the iron trade
where the physical revolution in rail
-t road standards is causing an abnormal
demand for iron. There is also great
prosperity in the coal trade, and an a
\,-X tive demand at profitable prices

Prices tor these are the highest In ten
years, and people are spending: vastly
more on luxuries and commodities ap­
pealing to aeethetic tastea than usual.
Elconamy is the exception and extrava
ganoe thefule, and how long this will
continue no one knows. There arei
signs off reaction which only- theblind
will not see,-andtheydemand caution.
We will soon begin to visibly pee the
effect off the com crop failure and the
consequent loss off freight tolhuea

south. High prices and scarcity are
not conducive to continuous prosperity
in spite off a delusion to the contrary
which some people entertain. Still
another unfavorable feature has been
the declines in our exports, which,
though perhaps not permanent, indi­
cate a cessation of the excessive trade
balances which have been a fruitful
source off selfcongratulaition. Our
exports of copper declined about $23,
000,000 during the first ten months of
1901 and our exports off iron manu­
factures showed a loss of $24,000,000
in the same fferiod. Such factors as
these cannot be ignored. They are
signs off oui" being at or near the top,
and common prudence dictates caution
in transactions entering into the fu­
ture.
A HEARTY.LAUGH.
The Wonderful Effects I Has Upon
tbe Human System.
"Laugh and grow fat" is a saying as
old as the hills. It has long been an
accepted fact that humor is a promoter
of digestion and merry words the dead­
liest foes of disease. Dr. J. E. Kenne­
dy, editor of the Iowa Health Bulletin,
writes an interesting article on the val­
ue of laughter, in which he shows it is
not only a remedial agent, but is also a
valuable preventive against a host of
diseases. The physical effects of laugh­
ter are thus put down by Dr. Kennedy:
Laughter increases the blood circula­
tion.
It enlarges the heart
It expands the lungs.
It jiggers the diaphragm.
It promotes the dioculation of the
spleen.
In other words, laughter stirs up tin.
vital regions of the body, gives them
healthful exercise and produces a men­
tal exhilaration which acts upon the
system much as a brisk walk in a crisp
atmosphere does upon the appetite. As
strong allies to laughter Dr. Kennedy
gives the following directions for men­
tal peace of mind:
Beware of theologians who have no
sense of mirth. They are not altogeth­
er human.
Keep your chin up.
Don't take your troubles to bed witt
you. Hang them on a chair with your
trousers or drop them in a glass of wa­
ter with your teeth.
Dr. Kennedy has surely hit the nail
on the head. If his prescription and
advice are followed, his own bills will
be decidedly cut down. Burlington

LURED BY SCENT.
Rats Caught In Numbers by an In­
genious Means.
Rats are very susceptible to the odor
of certain drugs, and any ordinary trap
set in their haunts is likely to be suc­
cessful if dressed with these scents, the
attraction of which, rat catchers affirm,
they cannot resist. An example is:
Powdered assafetida, eight grains oil
of rhodium, two drams oil of aniseed,
one dram oil of lavender, one-half
dram. Shake together in a bottle and
use a very small quantity to dress the
bait.
To catch rats, cover a common barrel
with stiff, stout paper, tying the edge
round the barrel. Place aboard so that
the rats may have easy access to the
top. Sprinkle cheese parings or other
food for the rats on the paper for sev­
eral days until they begin to tjiink that
they have a right to their daily rations
from this source. Then place in the
bottom of the barrel a piece of rock
about six or seven inches high, filling
with water until only enough of it
projects above the water for one rat to
jlodge upon.
Now replace the paper, first cutting a
cross in the middle, and the first rat
that comes on the barrel top goes
through into the water and climbs on
the rock. The paper comes back to its
original position, and the second rat
I follows the first Then begins a fight
for the possession of the dry place on
the stone, the noise of which attracts
the othere, who share the same fate.—

Attorneys Appear before the Supreme
Court today to Argue Habeas
Corpus for West
Attorney John Cochrane Appears for
the Defendant and States
Attorney Opposes.
Facts in the Case Presented by Both
Sides to Sustain Contentions
Pro and Con.
In the supreme court today is being
argued an application for a writ of ha­
beas corpus for the release of W. E.
West, who shot and killed Frank
March at Grand Forks, on bail. The
application is being argued by J. M.
Cochrane of the firm of Cochrane &
Corliss for West, and is being resisted
by States Attorney Wineman, who ap­
pears for the staite. The particulars
of this application are familiar to
readers from the proceedings had at
Grand Forks, where the application
for bail was made before Judge Fisk,
who refused to admit West to bail.
West's attorneys claim that the case
is such a one as should entitle the'de­
fendant to be admitted to reasonable
bail. His attorneys claim that the
elieimenit of self defense enters into the
crime committed, and that there was
a lack off premeditation on the part
of West in shooting March, who, they
claim, was the aggressor in the unfor­
tunate affair which resulted in his
death. The state does not admit the
contentions off the defense, and claims
that West had thorough knowledge off
what he was doing at the time he fired
the shot, and that he was at that par­
ticular time, not in danger off violence,
as the men had been separated.
The case will be taken under advise­
ment by the count

that an application will be made for

"SHE BURNS GREEN."
The Discovery «f Borax In Death
Valley by Aaron Winters.
The greatest discovery of borax in
the United States was made in the ter­
ribly hot region known as Death val­
ley and in a most romantic way. The
Chicago Record tells the story.
In 1880 Aaron Winters lived with his
wife, Rosie, in a gulch known as Ash
Meadows, not far from the month of
Death valley. He was so fond of
his wife that he would not allow her to
be long absent from him, although
their little hut on the side of the moun­
tain was a hundred miles from the
nearest neighbor, in a wild, rugged
forsaken country.
One day a desert tramp came along
and spent the night at the Winters
home. He told the hunter about the
borax deposits of Nevada. When be
went away. Winters thought that he
had seen deposits of the same kind on
his explorations into Death valley.
Accordingly he and his wife went to­
gether to make the search, having pre­
viously provided themselves with cer­
tain test chemicals, which when com­
bined with borax anil ignited would
produce a green flaftie-
Having procured a piece of the sub
sl&nce which he believed to be borax.
Winters and his.wife waited for night­
fall to make the test. How would It
burn?
For years they had lived like Piutes
on the desert entirely .without luxuries
and often wanting for the very necessi­
ties of life. Would the match change
all that?
Winters held the blaze to the sub­
stance with *a trembling hand, then
shouted at the top of his voice: "She
burns green, Rosiel We're rich! We're
rich!"
They had found' borax. The mine
was sold' for $20,000, and Winters took
his Rosie to a ranch in Nevada.

HARMFUL BATHING.
Too Mnch Soap and Water Is
Good For the Skin.
Vol
it is a familiar boast of English peo­
ple that we are above all others a
washing nation. Soap and water is a
standing dish in Great Britain, but so
little were we disposed to credit the
habitual cleanliness of foreigners that
a piece of soap in the valise was till re­
cently the habitual companion of an
Englishman on his travels. All kinds
of theories have been raised to account
for this national tendency to ablution,
and most diverse qualities have been
attributed to its possession.
The familiarity of islanders with wa­
ter and the use of it occasioned by the
national custom that led the ancient
Britons to paint their bodies are sol­
emnly urged as the foundation of the
English proneness to washing, and the
fresh complexions and smooth skins of
young Englishmen are held to replace
the more dusky and hirsute counte­
nances of the Latin races because of
their closer and more frequent ac­
quaintance with the articles of the
washstand.
It is quite obvious that even in Eng­
land there are people who wash too
little. It is not so generally recognized
that some people wash too much. The
skin is not well adapted to frequent
applications of water accompanied by
even the least irritating of soaps. A
tendency arises to maceration of the
superficial part of the epidermis, which
is too frequently removed and occa­
sions probably too rapid a proliferation
of the cells of the Malpighian layer.
There is no doubt that many cases of
roughness of the skin of the face come
from the frequent applications of wa­
ter. It is a good thing to rub the face
with a soft, clean, dry towel two or
three times a day. If, in addition, wa
tec is used in the morning and at night,
the skin will be kept in -a sounder,
smoother and healthier state than if.
as is often the case, soap and water are
Used three or four times a day.
Men are not often offenders in this
respect, most men sparing little time
for the refinements of the toilet. ^Vom
en and children, whose skins are the
most easily affected by superfluous ab­
lution, are the very persons in whom
such excess is too common. They
should be taught that there are dry
methods of cleanliness as well as wet
ones.—Lancet
A BURSTING BOILER.
Bow It Looks When a Locomotive la
Blown l*p.
"I am one of the very few persons
who ever saw a locomotive blow up,"
remarked an old railroad man to a re­
porter the other day. "Generally the
men who witness the explosion of a
steam engine are so dead when the
smoke has cleared away that they are
never able to give an account of the
disaster.
"Like many other accidents, the one
I saw was the result of carelessness—
low water in the boiler—for the engine
had just come from the shops and was
in complete repair. It was on the Bal­
timore and Ohio railroad in West Vir­
ginia a number of years ago. I was on
a locomotive some distance behind the
one which exploded and was looking
ahead out of the cab window, so that
the ill fated engine was Immediately
before my eyes. Suddenly I saw the
machine rise in the air. It seemed to me
to be about as high as the telegraph
pol beside tbe track, which, as you
doubtless know, are not so high as tel­
egraph poles in the city. Then came a
cloud of dense black smoke and dust
which hid the engine from view, and
almost simultaneously I heard the roar
of the explosion.

"Both theengineer and the fireman
were killed, and the locomotive was fit
for nothing much but^ the scrap heap
when it fell to the ground. The crown
sheet over the firebox had blown out.
"The stt^nge thing about the explo­
sion was tiUlt no white steam wtus seen.
Yon know that perfectly dry steam is
invisible, being like the air, and before
It had time to condense It was proba­
bly smothered by tbe cloud of smoke
and dust raised by the bursting of the
boiler."'-Baltimore Sun.
M. L. McCormack, former Territorial
Secretary, Back to Spend the
Winter at Home.
Tells of His Mining Interests at Cape
Nome, and the Richness of the
Country.
How Mining is Done in His Section is
Interesting.y Described by
Mr. McCormack.
Grand Forks, Dec. 8.—Captain M. L.
McCormack has returned from Cape
Nome for the winter. The mine in
which Capftain McCormick is interested
is situated about five miles Crom Nome
city on Anvil creak. It is known as
No. 5 'up the creek," and in that con­
nection he told how mines were num­
bered there. The first mime in a lo­
cality is always known as "Discovery"
mine, and the other mines on the same
lead or creek are numbered in consecu­
tive order in both directions.
The claims contain twenty acres,
being 1.350 feet long and 050 feet wide.
No. on Anvil creek is now well de­
veloped.
It is what is known as a free gold
mine, and the dirt is ridh from beneath
the roots of the grass to the stratum of
solid rock which is about 23 feet from
the surface, where they have been
working this summer. When they
first started to develop the mine the
water used for sluicing was all pumped,
but now the natural fall off the water
in Anvil creek is utilized. They are
now working in a cut at right angles
to Anvil creek, and running back from
it several hundred feet The com­
pany built a dam where Anvil creeik
enters the boundaries of their Cjlaim,"
and conducted the water from there to
any point on the claim they wish
through ditches, and from there into
the sluice boxes, as they are called,
which in turn empty into the creek
again at a point further down the
stream. The owner of any claim may
use the water passing through their
property provided it all finds its way
back into the same stream again.
The sluice boxes are made of three
12-inch boards, making a sort off
trough which the water runs through.
In the bottom of the trough a false
bottom is laid, which is corrugated,
and as the dirt is shoveled into the
trough, the water washes the dirt and
gravel to the end off the sluice way,
while the free gold, being very heavy,
settles to the bottom and remains in
the corrugated false bottom. Brus­
sels carpet and pieces of blanket are
placed in the lower end of the sluice
way. and the finer gold is caught in
this manner, while the very finest of
it is caught by means of quick silver
which is placed at the extreme end of
the sluice way. and the gold and quick
silver is later separated in boiling ket­
tles and the quick silver used over
3gain.
The sluice ways are clewed every
other day. and there is one crew that
has nothing else to do. Captain Mc­
Cormack says that the daily "clean
up" on their property this summer has
been about 100 ounces, and the mar­
ket value of this amount is from
$l.fitX to $2,000. While this seems
like a very large amount per day, it
must be remembered that the expenses
are heavy. A crew of from 75 to 100
men have been employed all summer
and not a man on the job received less
than per day. and board. The
board there is a more important item
than it is here, though the captain says
that he did not think it cost the com­
pany more than 35 cents a meal to feed
the men.
He says that where "rock bottom"
is struck, it is cleaned up as clean as a
kitchen floor, and it is at such places
that very rich strikes are frequently
made. Every article off the dirt Is
put through the sluice way and it will
be seen that it takes a great deal off
time to work a twenty acre mine in
this manner. Great care is taken
that not an ounce off the gold is lost,
as aside from the carpet and blankets
that are placed in the sluice way, to­
gether with the quick silver, a tub is
placed at the end off the trough when
the men are cleaning up, and there is
no chancefor any of the gold to get
away. THe carpet and blanket are
washed carefully after each cleanup.
The mining season, that" is for this
class Of mining, opeqra up generally
during the early part off June, though
it was somewhat later this season.
From that time for a period off about

three months the sun is shilling day
and night and shift crews are worked
to make the best of the sunlight dur- ,vs
ing the brief period. This year the
mines were worked till about the first
off October, when the formation off ice
stops further procedure till next year.
During his stay at Nome Capt. Mc­
Cormack secured many views,- from
that section of the country, and the
workings of the mines can be well un­
derstood by an inspection off the pic­
tures. He also has many views of
dog trains, etc., which are used by the
company to transfer goods from Nome
cilty to the mines, a distance of five
•miles, though they also have horses,
the horses being used principally to
scrape the dirt away after it has been
washed down and the gold freed from

in Alaska, and while many who so
there have not made money, a great
many more have, nearly all in fact,
who have been willing to settle down
and work hard, instead of wandering
about looking for something immense,
which is not found on every creek, but

gold all through the country, and it is
destined to be one of the richest min­
ing countries in the world.
ISOLATION OF ACTORS.
Conditions Which Slake the Profes­
sion a World by llsel".
This condition, which from some im­
portant points of view is fortunate,
from others unfortunate and from near­
ly all inevitable, is unique indeed.
Here we have the only large class of
workers which keeps the world at
arm's length. Clergymen, physicians,
lawyers, architects, merchants, trades­
men and laborers of all sorts, by the
very terms of their toil are brought
into constant personal contact with
parishioners, patients, clients or cus­
tomers. Even painters and sculptors
must needs be in touch with their pa­
trons.

blazing lamps which rims the front of

From the more important social gath­

both actress and actor are necessarily

acquire a residence and contrive to be

it is impossible that he should take
any active part in politics or partici­

BEAVER TAIL SOUP.
A Michigan Lumber Camp Delicacy
That Amaied a Mary lander.

want to tell you that I'll have to take
off my hat to the lumber camp cook of

of the beaver, maHed like an armadillo,
took from it the underlying bone and

perhaps better on the Eastern Shore,
