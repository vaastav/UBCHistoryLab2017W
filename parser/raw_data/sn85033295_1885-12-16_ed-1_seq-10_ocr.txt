silver coin in circulation, but the fact that a
large share of tho limited amount thus put out
has soon returned to the public treasury in pay
ment of duties, leads to the belied that the peo
ple do not now desire to it on hand, and
this, with the evident disposition to hoa'd gold,
gives rise to the suspicion that there al
ready exists a lack of confidence among
the people touching our financial processes.
There is certainly not enough silver now in cir
culation to cause uneasiness, and tho whole
amount coined and now on hand might, after a
time, be absorbed by the people without appre
hension ; but it is the ceaseless stream that
threatens to overflow the land which causes fear
and uncertainty. What has been thus fur sub
mitted upon this subject relates almost entirely
to considerations of a homi "nature, unconnected
with the bearing which the policies of other na
tions have upon the question, but it is perfectly
apparent that a line of action in regard to our
currency cannot wisely be settled upon or per
sisted in without considering the atti
tude on the subject of other coun
tries with whom we maintain inter
course through commerce, trade, and travel.
An acknowledgment of this is found in the act
by virtue of which our silver is compulsorily
coined. It provides that: “The President shall
invite the Governments of the countries compos
ing the Latin Union, so called, and of such
other European nations as he may deem ad
visable, to join tho United States in a conference
to adopt a common ratio between gold and sil
ver fur the purpose of establishing internation
ally the uses of bimetallic mepev and securing
fixety of relative value between these metals.
This conference absolutely failed, and a simi
lar fate bas awaited all subsequent efforts in the
same direction, and still we continue our coin
age of silver at a ratio different from that of any
other nation. The most vital part of the Silver
Coinage Act remains inoperative and unex
ecuted, and without an ally or friend we battle
upon the silver field in an illogical and losing
contest. To give full effect to the design of
Congress on this subject, I have made careful
and earnest endeavor since the adjournment of
the last Congress.
To this end I delegated a gentleman well in
structed in fiscal science to proceed to the finan
cial centers of Europe, and in conjunction with
uur Ministers to England, France, and Germany,
to obtain • a full knowledge of the attitude and
In Lent of these governments respecting the es
tablishment of such an international ratio as
would procure free coinage of both metals at the
mints of those countries and our own. By my
direction our Consul General at Paris has given
tlose attention to the proceedings of the Con
gress of the Latin Union in order to indicate our
interest in its objects and report its action.
It may be said in brief as the result of these
efforts that the attitude of the leading powers
remain substantially unchanged since the Mon
etary Conference of 1881; nor is to be questioned
that tho views of these Governments are in each
instance supported by the weight of public opin
ion. The steps thus taken have, therefore, only
more fully demonstrated the uselessness of fur
ther attempts at present to arrive at any agree
ment on the subject with other nations. In the
meantime we are accumulating silver coin based
upon onr peculiar ratio to such an extent, and
assuming so heavy a burden to be provided for
in any international negotiations, as will render
us an undesirable party to any future monetary
conference of nations.
It is a significant fact that four of the five
countries comprising the Latin Union men
tioned in our coinage act, embarrassed with
their silver currency, have just completed an
agreement among themselves that no more
silver shall be coined by their respective gov
ernments, and that such as has been already
coined and in circulation shall be redeemed in
gold by the country of its coinage. The resort
to this expedient by these countries may well
arrest the attention of those who sup
pose that we cau succeed without shock
or injury in the attempt to circulate, upon
its merits, all the silver we may coin under
the provisions of the silver-coinage act.
The condition in which our Treasury may be
placed by a persistence in our present course is
a matter of concern to every patriotic citizen
who does not desire his Government to pay in
silver such of its obligations as should be paid in
gold. Nor should our condition be such as to
oblige us, in a prudent management of our
affairs, to discontinue the calling in and pay
ment of interest beai'ing obligations which we
have tho right now to discharge ani thus avoid
the payment of further interest thereon.
The so-called debtor class, for whose benefit
the continued compulsory coinage of silver is in
sisted upon, are not dishonest because they are
in debt, and they should not be suspected of a
desire to jeopardize the financial safety of the
country in order that they may cancel their
present debts by paying the same in depreciated
dollars ; nor should it be forgotten that it is not
the rich nor the money-leneer alone that must
submit to such a readjustment, enforced bv
the Government and their debtors. The
pittance of the widow and the orphan, raid
the incomes of helpless beneficiaries of
all kinds, would be disastrously reduced.
The depositors in savings banks and in other
institutions which hold in trust the savings of
the poor, when their little accumulations are
scaled down to meet the new order of things,
would, in their distress, painfully realize the de
lusion of the promise made to them that plen
tiful money would improve their condition. We
have now' on hand all me silver dollars neces
sary to supply the present needs of the people,
and to satisfy those who from sentiment wish
to see them in circulation, and if their coinage
is suspended they can be readily obtained by
all who desire them. If the need of more is at
any time apparant, their coinage may be re
newed.
That disaster has not already overtaken us
furnishes no proof that danger does not wait
upon a continuation of the present silver coin
age. We have been saved by the most careful
management, and unusual expedients by a com
bination of fortunate conditions, and by a confi
dent expectation that the commerce of the Gov
ernment in regard to silver coinage would be
speedily changed by an action cf Congress.
Prosperity hesitates upon our threshold because
of dangers and uncertainties surrounding this
question.
Capital timidly shrinks from trade, and invest
ors are unwilling to take the chance of the ques
tionable shape in which their money will be re
turned to them, while enterprise halts at a risk
against which care and sagacious management
do not protect. Asa necessary consequence,
labor lacks employment, and suffering and dis
tress are visited upon a portion of onr fellow-cit
izens especially entitled to the careful consider
ation of those charged with the duties of legisla
tion. No interest appeals to us so strongly for a
safe and stable currency as the vast army of the
unemployed.
I recommend the suspension of comyulsory
coinage of silver dollars directed by the law
passed in February, 1878.
STEAMBOAT INSPECTION SERVICE.
The steamboat inspection service on the 30th
day of June, 1885, was comqosed of 140 persons,
including officers, clerks and messengers. The
expenses of the service over the receipts were
$138,822.27 during the fiscal year. The special
inspection of foreign steam vessels, organized
under the law passed in 1882, was maintained
during the year at an expense oi $30,041.63.
Since the close of the fiscal year reductions
have been made in the forces employed, which
will result in a saving during the current year
of $17,000 without affecting the efficiency of the
service.
MARINE HOSPITALS.
The supervising Surgeon General reports that
during the fiscal year 41,714 patients have re
ceived relief through marine hospital service, of
whom 12,003 were treated in hospitals and 28,911
at dispensaries.
PROTECTION FROM CHOLERA AND SMALL-POY.
Active and effective efforts have been made
through the medium of this service to protect
the country against an invasion of cholera,
which has prevailed in Spain and France, and
the small-pox which recently broke out in
Canada.
THE LIFE-SAVING SERVICE.
The most gratifying results have attended the
operations of the' life-saving service during the
last fiscal year. The observance of the provision
of law requiring the appointments of the force
employed in the service to be made “solely with
reference to their fitness, and w ithout reference
to the political or party aftiliation,” has secured
the result wdiich may confidently be expected in
any branch of public employment where such a
rule is applied. Asa consequence this service
is composed of men well qualified for the per
formance of their dangerous and exceptionally
important duties.
The number of stations in commission at the
close of the year was 203. The number of disas
ters to vessels and crafts of all kind within their
f Id of action was 371. The number of persons
t angered iu such disasters was 2,439, of whom
2,428 were saved and only 11 lost. Other lives
which were imperiled, though not by disasters
to shipping, were also rescued, and a large
amount of property was saved through the aid
of this service. The cost of its maintenance dur-'
tug the year was $828,473.43.
THE COAST SURVEY.
The work of the coast and geodetic survey
was, during the last fiscal year, carried on wTith
in the boundaries and off the coasts of thirty
two states, two territories, and the District of
Columbia.
In July last, certain irregularities were found
to exist in the management of this bureau,
which led to a prompt investigation of its
methods. The abuses w'hich were brought to
light by this examination and the reckless dis
regard of duty and the interests of the Govern
ment developed on the part of some
of those connected with the service,
made a change of Superintendency and
a few of Its other officers necessary.
Since the bureau has been in new hands, an in
troduction of economies and application of busi
ness methods have produced an important sav
ing to the Government and a promise of more
useful results. This service has never been
Regulated by anything but most indefinite legal
frpaetmenta and the most unsatisfactory roles.
It was many years ago sanctioned, apparently
for a purpose regarded as temporary, and relat
ed to a survey of our coast. Having gained a
place in the appropriations made by Congress,
it has gradually taken to itself powers and ob
jects not contemplated in its creation, and ex
tended its operations until it sadly needs legis
lative attention.
DISCONTINUING A BUREAU.
So far as a further survey of our coast is con
cerned, there seems to be a propriety in trans
ferring that work to the Navy Department. Tho
other duties now in charge of this establish
ment, if they cannot be profitably attached to
some existing department or other bureau,
should be prosecuted under a law exactly defin
ing their scope and purpose, and with a careful
discrimination between the scientific inquiries
which may properly be assumed by the Govern
ment and those which should be undertaken
bv State authority, or by individual enterprise.
'lt is hoped that the report of tho Congressional
Committee heretofore appointed to investigate
this and other like matters will aid in tho ac
complishment of proper legislation on this sub
ject.
THE ARMY. *
The report of the Secretary of War is here
with submitted. The attention of Congress is
invited to the detailed account which it contains
of the administration of his department and his
recommendations and suggestions for tho im
provement of the service.
The army consisted, at the date of the Inst
consolidated returns, of 2,154 officers,, and 24,705
enlisted men. The expenses of the departments
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1885, including
813,104,394.00 for public works and river and har
bor improvements, were 845,850,909 54.
Beside the troops which were dispatched in
pursuit of the small band of Indians who left
their reservation in Arizona and committed mur
ders and outrages, two regiments of cavalry and
one of infantry were sent last July to the Indian
Territory to prevent an outbreak which seemed
imminent. They remained to aid, if necessary,
in the exjiulsion of intruders upon the reserva
tion wbo seemed to have caused the discontent
among tho Indians, but the Executive procla
mation warning them to remove was complied
with without interference.
Troops were also sent to Rock Springs, iu Wy
oming Territory, after the massacre of Chinese
there, to prevent farther disturbances, and af
terward to Seattle, in Washington Territory, to
aAert a threatened attack upon Chinese laborers
and domestic violence there. In both cases, the
mere presence of the troops had the desired ef
fect.
DESERTIONS.
It appears that the number of desertions bas
diminished, but that during the last fiscal year
they numbered 2,927, and one instance is given
by the Lieutenant General of six desertions by
the same recruit. lam convinced that this num
ber of desertions can be much dimin
ished by better discipline and treat
ment, but the punishment should
be increased for repeated offenses.
These desertions might also be reduced by
lessening the term of first enlistments, thus
allowing a discontented recruit to contemplate a
nearer discharge, and the army a profitable rid
dance. After one term of service, a re-enlist
ment would be quite apt to secure a contented
recruit and a good soldier.
COURTS MARTIAL.
The acting Judge Advocate General reports
that the number of trials by general courts
martial during the year was 2,328, and that 1,851
trials took place before garrison and regimental
courts-martial. The suggestion that prob
ably more than half tho army has been
tried for offences great and" small, in
one year, may well arrest attention.
Of course, many of these trials before garrison
and regimental courts martial ware for offenses
almost frivolous, and there should, I think, be a
way devised to dispose of these in a more sum
mary and less inconvenint manner than by
court martial. If some of the proceedings of
courts martial which I have had occasion to ex
amine present the ideas of justice which gen
erally prevail iu these tribunals, I am satisfied
that they should be much reformed, if the honor
and the honesty of the army and navy are by
their instrumentality to be vindicated and pro
tected.
SEA-COAST DEFENSES.
The Board on Fortifications or Other Defenses,
appointed in pursuance of the act of Congress
approved March 3, 1885, will in a short time pre
sent their report, and it is hoped that this may
greatly aid the legislation so necessary to reme
dy the present defenseless condition of our sea
coasts.
SIGNAL, SERVICE.
The work of the Signal Service has been pros
ecuted during the last year with result of in
creasing benefits to the country. The field of
instruction has been enlarged, with a view of
adding to its usefulness. The number of sta
tions in operation Juno 30, 1885, was 489.
Telegraphic reports are received daily from 490
stations. Reports are also received from 75 Ca
nadian stations, 375 volunteer observers, 52 army
surgeons at military posts, and 333 foreign sta
tions. The expense of service during the fiscal
year, after deducting receipts from military tel
egraph lines, was 8797,592.97. In view of the fact
referred to by the Secretary of War, that the
work of this service ordinarily is of a scientific
nature, and the further fact that it is assuming
larger proportions constantly, and becoming
more and more unsuited to the fixed rules,
which must govern the army, I am inclined
to agree with him in the opinion
that it should be separately established.
If this is done the scope and extent of its opera
tions should, as nearly as possible, be definitely
prescribed by law, and always capable of exact
ascertainment.
WEST POINT ACADEMY.
The military academy of West Point is re
ported as being in a high state of efficiency and
well equipped for the satisfactory accomplish
ment of the purposes of its maintenance. The
fact that the class which graduates next year is
an unusually large one, has constrained' me to
decline to make appointments to second lieu
tenancies in the army from civil life, so that
such vacancies as exist in these places may be
reserved for such graduates, and yet it is
not probable that there will be' enough
vacancies to provide positions for them
all when they leave the military school.
Under the prevailing law and usage, those not
thus assigned to duty never actively enter
the military service. It is suggested that the
law on this subject be changed so that such of
those young men as are not at once assigned to
duty after graduation may be retained as Second
Lieutenants in the army, if they desire it, sub
ject to assignment, when opportunity occurs,
under proper rules as to priority of selection.
The expenditures on account of the Military
Academy for the last fiscal year were §290,712.07.
PRIVATE-PROPERTY CLAIMS.
The act approved March 3, 187(>, designed to
compensate officers and enlisted men for loss of
private property while in the service of the
United States, is so indefinite in its teians, and
apparently admits so many claims, the adjust
ment of which could not have been contemplated,
that if It is to remain on the statute book it
needs amendment.
BRIDGES OYER NAVIGABLE WATERS.
There should be a general law of Congress
prohibiting the construction of bridges over
navigable waters in such manner as to obstruct
navigation, with provisions for preventing the
same. It seems that under existing statutes
the Government cannot intervene to prevent
such a construction when entered upon without
its consent, though when such consent is asked
and granted upon condition, the author! L y te
insist upon such condition is clear.
Thus it is represented that, while the officers of
the Government are, with great care, guarding
against the obstruction of navigation by a
bridge across the Mississippi River at St. Paul,
a large pier for a bridge has been built just
below this place, directly in the navigable chan
nel of tht3 river. If such things are to be per
mitted, a strong argument is presented against
the appropriation of large sums of money to
improve the navigation of this and other im
portant highways of commerce.
NAVAL AFFAIRS.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy gives
a history of the operations of his departments
and the present condition of the work com
mitted to his charge. He details in full the
course pursued by him to protect the rights of
the Government in respect of certain vessels
unfinished at the time of his accession to office,
and also concerning the dispatch boat Dolphin
clr’med to be completed and awaiting the ac
ceptance of the department.
No one can fail to see, from the recital con
tained in this report, that only the application
of business principles has been insisted upon in
the treatment of these subjects, and that what
ever controversy has arisen was caused by the ex
action on the part of the department of the con
tract obligations a.' they were legally construed.
In the case of the Dolphin, with entire justness
to the contractor, an agreement has been entered
into providing for the ascertainment by a
judicial inquiry of the complete or partial com
pliance with the contract in her construction,
and further providing for the assessment of any
damages to which the Government may be en
titled on account of a partial failure to perform
such comract, or the payment of the sum still
remaining unpaid upon her price in case a full
performance is adjudged. The contractor by
reason of his failure in business, being unable
to complete the other three vessels, they were
taken possession of by the Government in their
unfinished state, under a clause in the contract
permitting such a course, and are now in pro
cess of completion in the yard of the contractor,
but under the supervision of the Navy Depart
ment.
Congress in its last session authorized the
construction of tw T o additional new cruisers
and two gunboats, at a cost not exceeding in the
aggregate £2,(W0,000. The appropriation for this
purpose having become available on the Ist day
of July last, steps were at once taken for the
procurement of such plans for the construction
of these vessels as would be likely to ensure
their usefulness when completed. These are
,of the utmost importance, considering the
PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE—SUPPLEMENT.
constant advance In tne art of build
in .r vessels of tills clmraotov, and
the time is not lost which is spent
in their careful consideration and selection.
All must admi the iiui ortance ot an efft ctivo
navy to a nation like ours, having such an ex
tended sea coast to protect. \ twe have not a
single vessel of war that could keep the seas
agamst a first-class vessel of any important
power. Such a condition ought not longer to
continue. The nation that can not resist aggres
sion is constantly exposed to it. Its foreig i pol
icy is of necessity weak, and its negotiations
are conducted with disadvantage because it is
not. in a condition to enforce the terms dictated
by its sense of right and justice.
Inspired as I am bv the hope, shaved by all
patriotic citizens, that the day is not far distant
when our navy will bo such as befitk our
standing among the nations of the earth, and
rejoiced at every stop that leads in the direction
of such a consummation, I deem it my duty to
especially direct the attention of Congress to
the close of the report of the Secretary c f the
Navy in which the humiliating features ojf the
present organization of this department s ex
hibited, and the startling abuses and the waste
of its pi'esent methods are exposed. The con
viction is forced upon us, with the certainty of
mathematical demonstration, that before we
proceed further in the restoration of ana r y, we
need a thoroughly reorganized Navy Depart
ment.
The fact that within seventeen years more
than §75,000.000 has been spent in coustrc ction,
repair, equipment, and armament of vessels,
and the further fact that, instead of an ell active
and creditable fleet, we have only the discontent
and apprehension of a nation und fond jd by
war vessels, added to the disclosures now made,
do not permit ns to doubt that every altempt
to revive our navy has thus far, for the most
part, been misdirected, and all oi r effo :ts in
that direction have been little better than blind
gropings, and expensive, aimless follies.
Unquestionably if wo are content wi:h the
maintenance of a navy department simply as an
ornament to the Government, a constant watch
fulness may pro nt some oi the scandal and
abuse which haw. for.n I their way iutoou 1 pres
ent organization, and its incurable wash may
be reduced to the minimum. Bui if we it sire to
build ships for present usefulness irst *.d of
naval reminders of the days that are pc st, we
must have a department organized for tiu work,
supplied with all the latest and best ingenuity
our country affords and prepared cy take
advantage of the experience of other notions,
systematized so that nil efforts shall uni 5o and
lead in one direction; and fully imbued wth the
conviction that war vessels now are useless un
less they combine all that the ingen lity of
man has up to this day brought forth r dating
to their construction, I earnestly commt ml the
portion of the Secretary's report devoted to this
subject to the action of Congress, in tl e hope
that the suggestions touching the reorganization
of his department may bo adopted as the first
step toward the reconstruction of our navy,
TEE POSTAL. SERVICE.
The affairs of the postal service are ex ribited
by the report of tne Postmaster General w hich
will be laid before you. The postal rt venue,
whose rates of gain upon the rising prosp ?rity of
1882 and 1883 outstripped the increasing ex
pense of our growing service, was checked by
the reduction in the rate of letter postage which
took effect with the beginning of Octobe • in the
latter year, and it diminished during the
two fiscal years $2,730,003, in the pro
portion of 82,27.1,030 in 1881 to §520,000 jin 1885,
Natural growth and development have, in the
meantime, increased expenditure, resulting in a
deficiency in the revenue to the of the
department of §5,250,000 for the year 1884, und
$8,333,333.33% in the last fiscal year. The an
ticipated and natural revival of the revenue
has been oppressed and retarded jy the
unfavorable business condition of the country,
of which the postal service is a faithfrl indi
cator. The gratifying fact is shown, h iwever,
by the report, that our returning prosperity is
marked by a gam of §380,000 in the revenue
of the latter half of the last year oyer the
corresponding period of the preceding year.
The change in the rate of first-class matter
which may be carried fer a single rate of post
age from a half-ounce to an ounce, and the re
duction by one-half of the rate of newspaper
postage, which, under recent legislatior, begun
with the current year, w ill operate to restrain
the augmentation of receipts which otherwise
might have been expected to such a degree that
the scale of expense may gain upon the revenue
and cause an increased deficiency to bp shown
at its close ; yet after no long period of< rewak
ened prosperity, by proper economy, it iis confi
dently anticipated that even the present low
rates, now as favorable as any country affords,
will be adequate to sustain the cost| of the
service. |
The operation of the Postoffice Department is
for the convenience and benefit of the people,
and the method by which they pay the 'charges
of this useful arm of the public service, so that
it be just and impartial, is of less importance
to them than the economical expenditure of the
means they provide for its maintenance, und the
due improvement of its agencies, so t rat they
may enjoy its highest usefulness. A pioper at
tention has been directed to the prevention of
waste or extravagance, and good results appear
from the reports to have already been accom
plished.
DOMESTIC MONEY ORDERS.
I approve the recommendation o? tire Post
master General to reduce the charges oa domes
tic money orders of 85 and less from 8 tq 5 cents.
This change will materially aid thosp of our
people who, most of all, avail themselves of this
instrumentality, but to whom the element of
cheapness is of the greatest importance. With
this reduction the system would still remain
self-supporting.
THE FREE-DEIiTVEBY SYSTEM
has been extended to nineteen additior al cities
during the year, and 178 now e rjoy its
conveniences. Experience has commended
it to those who enjoy its benefits, and
further enlargement of its facilities] is duo
to other communities to which it is jadapted.
In the cities where it has been established,
taken together, the local postage ex seeds its
maintenance by nearly §1,303,000. The limit to
which this system is now confined by law has
been nearly reached, and the reasons given
justify the extension which is proposed
FOREIGN-MAID SERVICE.
It was decided, with my approbatioi i, after a
sufficient examination, to be inexpedient
for the Postoffice Department to contract
for carrying our foreign mails under die addi
tional authority given by the last Congress.
The amount limited was inadequate fi > pay all
within the purview of the law the fi ll rate of
50 cents per mile, and it would have been unjust
and unwise to have given it some and denied it
it to others. Nor could contracts bavfi been let
under the lav/ to all at a rate to have) brought
the aggregate within the appropriation without
such practical pre-arrangement of berms as
would have violated it. Tne rate of sea and in
land postage which was proffered unde c another
statute clearly appears to be a fair compensa
tion for the desired service, being ttajee times
the price necessary to secure transportation by
other vessels upon any route, and much beyond
the charges made to private persons fo r services
not less burdensome.
Some of the steamship companies, upon the
refusal of the Postmaster General to attempt,
by the means provided, the distribution of the
sum appropriated, withdrew the services of
their vessels, and thereby occasioned slight
inconvenience, though no consider able in
jury. The mails have been <1 spatched
by other means. Whatever may be thought
of the policy of subsidizing any line of
public conveyance or travel, I am satisfied that
it should not bo done under cover of ai expendi
ture incident to the administration oi a depart
ment, nor should there be any uncertainty as to
the recipients of the subsidy or any disc ration left
to an executive officer a to its distribution.
If such gifts of public money are to be made for
the purpose of aiding any enterprise ir the sup
posed interest of the public, I cannot >ut think
that the amount to be paid and the beneficiary
might better be determined by Congress than in
any other way.
THE POSTAL UNION.
The International Congress of deleg ites from
the postal union countries convened £,t Lisbon,
in Portugal, in February last, and af ;er a ses
sion of some weeks the delegates signed a con
vention amendatory of the present Postal Union
Convention in some particulars designed to ad
vance its purposes. This additional act has had
my approval, ahd will be laid before you with
the departmental reports.
I approve the recommendation of the Post
master General that another assistant bo pro
vided for his department. I invite yo ir consid
eration to the several other recount endations
contained in his report.
DEPARTMENT OP JUSTICE.
The report of the Attorney General contains a
history of the conduct of the Department of
Justice during the last year, and a number of
valuable suggestions as to needed legislation,
and I invite your careful attention to ino same.
The condition of business in the courts
of the United States is such that there
seems to bo an imperative nec issity for
remedial legislation on the subject.
Some of these courts are so overburdened with
pending causes that the delays on determining
litigation amount often to a denial of justice.
Among the plans suggested for relief : s one sub
mitted by the Attorney General. Its main
features are the transfer of all the original juris
diction of the Circuit Courts to the District
Courts, and an increase of Judges for ;he latter
where necessary; an addition of Judges
to the Circuit Courts and constituting
the exclusive courts of appeal and reason
ably limiting appeals thereto; further
restrictions of the right to remeve causes
from the State to Federal Courts, permitting
appeals to the Supreme Court from the courts of
the District of Columbia and the territories
only in the same cases as they are allowed from
State Courts, and guarding against a;i unneces
sary number of appeals from the Cirduit Courts.
I approve the plan thua outlined, and recom-
mend the legislation necessary for its applica
tion to our judicial system.
The present mode of compensating United
States Marshals and District Attorneys should,
in my opinion, be changed. Th ly are allowed
to charge against tho Government certain fees
for service, their incomes being measured by tho
amount of such foes within a fixed limit to their
annual aggregate. This is a direct inducement
for them to make their fees in criminal cases ns
large as possible in an effort to roach the
maximum sum permit.e . As an entirely
natural consequence unscrupulous Marshals
are found encouraging frivolous prosecu
tions, arresting people on petty charges of
crime and transporting them to distant
places for examination and trial, for the
purpose of earning mileage and other fees,
and District Attorneys uselessly attend criminal
examinations far from their places of residence
for the express purpose of swelling their ac
counts against tho Government. Tne actual ex
penses incurred in these transactions are always
charged against the Government. Thus the
rights and freedom of our citizens are outraged,
and public expenditures increased for the pur
pose o f furnishing public officers pretexts for in
creasing tho measure of their compensation. I
think Marshals and District Attorneys should be
paid salaries adjusted by a rule which will make
them commensurate with services fairly ren

PUNISHING MISDEMEANORS.
In connection with the subject, I desire to sug
gest the ad visibility, if it bo found not obnox
ious to constitutional objection, of investing
United States Commissioners v ith tho power to
try and determine certain violations of law
within the grade of misdemeanors. Such trials
might lie made to depend upon the option of the
accused. The multiplication of small and tech
nical offenses, especially under tho provisions
of our Internal Revenue law, renders* some
change in our present system very desirable, in
tho interests of humanity as well as economy.
Tho District Cour.s arc now crowded with
petty prosecutions, involving a punishment, in
case of conviction, of only a slight fine, while
tho parties at cased are harassed by an en
forced attendance upon the courts held hun
dreds of miles from their homes. If poor and
friem loss, they aio obliged to r. main in jail,
and mouths, perhaps, elapse before a session
of the court is held, and are finally brought
to trial surrounded by strangers, and
with but little opportunity for defense.
In tho meantime frequently the Marshal hu.s
charged against the Government his fees for an
arrest, the transportation of the accused and the
expense of tho same ; and for summoning wit
nesses before a Commissioner, a Grand Jury
and a court, the witnesses have been paid from
tho public funds large fees and traveling ex
penses, and the Commissioner and District At
torney have also made their charges against the
Government. This abuse in the administration
of our criminal law should be remedied, and if
tho plan above suggested is not practicable,
some other should ho devised.
INTERNAL AFFAIRS.
The report of the Secretary of the Interior,
containing an account of the operation of this
important department and much interesting in
formation, will be submitted for your considera
tion. Tho most intricate and difficult subject in
charge of this department is the treatment and
management of
THE INDIANS.
I am satisfied that some progress may bo noted
in their condition as a result of a prudent
administration of the present laws and
regulations for their control; but it is sub
mitted that there is lack of a fixed purpose of
policy on this subject which should be supplied.
It is useless to dilate upon tho wrongs of the In
dians, and as useless to indulge in the heartless
belief that because their wrongs are revenged
in thoir own atrocious manner, therefore they
should be exterminated.
They are within the care of our Government,
and their rights are, or should be protected
from invasion by the most solemn obligations.
They are properly enough called the wards of
tho Government, and it should bo borne in mind
that this guardianship involves on our part ef
forts for tho improvement of their condition and
the enforcement of their rights.
There seems to be general concurrence in tho
proposition that the ultimate object of their
treatment should be their civilization and citi
zenship. Fitted by these to keep pace in the
march of progress with the advanced civiliza
tion about them, they will readily assimilate
with the mass of our population, assuming tho
responsibilities and receiving the protection in
cident to this condition. The difficulty appears
to lie in tho selection of the means to ho at pres
ent employed toward the attainment of this re
sult.
Our Indian population, exclusive of those in
Alaska, is reported as numbering 230,000, nearly
all being located on lands set apart for their use
and occupation, aggregating over 131,003,000 of
acres. These lauds axe included in boundaries of
seventeen reservations of different dimensions,
scattered in twenty-one States and Territories,
presenting great variations in climate and in tho
kind and quality of their soils. Among
Indians upon these several reservations
there exists the most marked differences
in natural traits and disposition, and
in their progress toward civilization.
While some are lazy, vicious, and stupid, others
arc industrious, peaceful and intelligent. While
a portion of them are self-supporting and in
dependent and have so far advanced in civiliza
tion that they make their own laws, administer
ed through officers of their own choice, and
educate their children in schools of their own
establishment and maintenance, others still
remain in squalor and dependance almost
in the savagery of their natural state.
In dealing with this question the desires mani
fested by the Indians should not be ignored.
Here again we find a great diversity. With
some the tribal relation is cherished with the ut
most tenacity, while its hold upon others is con
siderably relaxed. The love of home is strong
with all, and yet there are those whoso attach
ment to a particular locality is by no means un
yielding. The ownership of these lands in sev
eralty is much desired by some, while by others
and sometimes again the most civilized, such a
distribution would be bitterly opposed.
The variation of their wants growing out of and
connected with tho character of then* several lo
cations should be regarded. Some are upon
reservations most fit for grazing, but without
flocks or herds, and some on arable land have
no agricultural implements, while some of the
reservations are double the size necessary to
maintain the number of Indians now upon them.
In a few cases, perhajis. they should be en
larged. Add to all this tho difference in the ad
ministration of the agencies, while the same
duties are devolved upon all, the disposition of
the agents and the manner of their contact with
the Indians have much to do with their con
dition and welfare.
The agent who perfunctionarily performs his
duty and slothful] y neglects all opportunity to
advance their moral and physical improvement,
and fails to inspire them With a desire for better
things, will accomplish nothing in the direction
of their civilization, while he who feels the bur
den of an important trust and has an interest in
his work will, by consistent examples, firm, yet
considerate treatment, and well-directed aid and
encouragement, constantly lead those under his
charge toward the light of their enfranchisement.
The history of all the jirogress which has been
made in civilization of tho Indian, I think, will
disclose the fact that the beginning has been
religious teaching, followed by or accompanying
secular education, while the self-sacrificing and
pious men and women who have aided in this
good work by their independent endeavors have
for their reward the beneficent result of their
labor and consciousness of Christian duty well
performed. Their valuable services should be
fully acknowledged by all who, under the law,
are charged with the control and management
of our Indian wards.
What has been said indicates that in the
presexjt condition of the Indians no attempt
should be made to apply a fixed and unyielding
law of action to their varied and varying needs
and circumstances. The Indian Bureau, bur
dened as it is with this general oversight, and
with the details of the establishment, can
hardly possess itself of tho minute particulars
of cases needing treatment, and thus the
propriety of creating an instrumentality auxil
iary to those already established for the
care of the Indians, suggests itself.
I recommend the passage ox a law authorizing
tho appointment of six'commissioners, three of
whom shall be detailed from the army, to be
charged with the dpty of a careful inspection
from time to time of all the Indiana upon our
reservations or subject to the care and control
of the Government, with a view of discovering
their exact condition and needs, and determin
ing what steps thall be taken on behalf of the
Government to improve thoir situation in the
direction of their self-support and complete
civilization. That they ascertain from such
inspection what, if any, of the reservations may
be reduced in area, and in such cases what pai*t,
not needed for Indian occupation, may be pur
chased by the Government from tho In
dians and disposed of for their benefit;
what, if any, Indians may, with their consent,
be removed to other reservations, with a view
of their concentration, and the sale on their be
half of their abandoned reservations ; what In
dian lands now held in common should be al
lotted in severalty ; in what manner and to what
extent the Indians upon the reservations can
be placed under the protection of our laws and
subjected to thoir penalties, and which, if any,
Indians should be invested with the right of
citizenship. The powers and functions of the
Commissioners in regard to these subjects
should bo clearly defined, though they should,
in conjunction with the secretary of the In
terior, be given all the authority to deal definite
ly with the questions presented, if deemed safe
and consistent.
SURVEYING INDIAN LANDS.
The expense of the Indian Bureau during tho
last fiscal your was more than §8,500,000. I be
lieve much of this expenditure may be saved
under the plan proposed; that its economical
effects would be increased with its continuance ;
that the safety of our frontier settlers would be
subserved under its operation, and that the na
tion would be saved through its results from the
imputation of inhumanity, injustice, and mis
management. In order to carry out the policy
of allotment of Indian lauds in severalty, when
deemed expedient, it will bo necessary to have
surveys completed of the reservations, and I
hope that provision will be made for the prose
cution of this work.
They should also be charged with the duty of
ascertaining the number of Indians who
might properly bo furnished with imple
ments of agriculture, and of what kind;
in what cases the support of the Gov
ernment should be withdrawn; where the
present plan of distributing Indian supplies
should be changed; where schools may bo
established, and whore discontinued; the
conduct, method and fitness of agents in
charge of reservations ; the extent to
which such reservations are occupied or
intruded upon by unauthorized persons, and
generally all matters relating to the wel
fare and improvement of the Indian.
They should advise with the Sccuetaiyof the
Interior concerning these matters of detail in
management, and he should be given power to
deal with them fully, if ho is not now invested
with such power. This plan contemplates the
selection of such persons for commissioners
who are interested in the Indian question, and
who have practical ideas on the subject of their
treatment.
INDIAN TROUBLES.
In May of the present year a small portion of
the Cniricnhna Apaches on the White Mountain
Reservation in Arizona left the reservation and
committed a. number of murders upon settlers
in that neighborhood. Though prompt, and en
ergetic action w r as taken by the military, the
renegades eluded capture” and escaped into
Mexico. The formation of the country through
which these Indians passed, their thorough ac
quaintance with the same, the speed of their
escape and the manner in which they scattered
and concealed themselves in the mountains
near the scene of their outrages, put
our soldiers at a great disadvantage in their
efforts to capture them, although tho expecta
tion is still entei'tnined that they w T ill ultimately
be taken and punished for their crimos.
INDIAN RESERVATIONS PROTECTED.
The threatening and disorderly conduct of the
Cheyennes, of the Indian Territory, early last
summer, caused considerable alarm and un
easiness. Investigation proved that their threat
ening attitude was due, in a great measure, to
the occupation of the land of their reservation
by immense herds of cattle, which their
owners claimed were rightfully there
under certain leases made by the Indians.
Such occupation appearing, upon examination,
to be unlawful, notwithstanding these leases,
the intruders were ordered to remove with their
cattle from the land of the Indians by the Ex
ecutive proclamation. The enforcement of this
proclamation had the effect of peace and order
among the Indians, and they are now quiet and
well behaved.
By an Executive order issued on February 27.
1885, by my predecessor, a portion of the tract
of country in tho territory known as the Old
Winnebago and Crow Creek Reservations was
directed to be restored to the public domain and
opened to settlement, under the land laws of
the United States, and a large number of per
sons entered upon those lands.
This action alarmed the Sioux Indiana, who
claimed the territory as belonging to their res
ervation under the treaty of 18GB. This claim
was determined, after careful investigation, to be
well founded, and consequently the Executive
order referred to was, by proclamation of April
17, 1835, declared to be inoperative and of no ef
fect, and all persons upon the land were warned
to leave. This warning has been substantially
complied with.
OUR PUBLIC LANDS.
Tho public domain had its origin in cessions of
land by tho States to the General Government.
Tho first cession was made by the State of Now
York, and the largest, which in area exceeded
all the others, by the State of Virginia. The ter
ritory, tho proprietorship of which became thus
vested in the General Government, extended
from the western line of Pennsylvania to the
Mississippi River. These patriotic donations of
the States were incumbered by no condition,
except that they should be held and used “for
tho common benefit of the United States.”
By purchase with the common fund of all tho
people additions were made to this domain un
til it extended to the northern line of Mexico,
the Pacific Ocean, and the Polar Sea. The origi -
nal trust “for the common benefit of the United
States” attached to ali. In tho execution of that
trust the policy of “many homes rather than
large estates” was adopted by the Government.
That those might be easily obtained and be the
abode of security and contentment, the laws for
their acquisition were few, easily understood,
and general in their character.
But the pressure of local interests, combined
with a speculative spirit, has in many in
stances procured the passage of laws which
marred the harmony of the general plan and en
cumbered the system with a multitude of gen
eral und special enactments which render the
laud laws complicated, subject the titles to un
certainty and the purchasers often to oppression
and wrong. Laws which were intended for tho
“common benefit” have been perverted so that
large qxiantities of land are vested in single
ownership. From tho multitude and character
of the laws this consequence seems incapable
of correction by mere administration.
It is not for the common benefit of the United
States that a large area of the public lands
should bo vested, directly or through fraud, in
the hands of a single individual. The nation’s
strength is in the people. The nation’s prosper
ity is in their prosperity. The nation’s glory is
in tho equality of her justice. The nation’s per
petuity is in the patriotism of all her people.
Hence, as far as practicable, the plan adopted
in the disposal of the public lands should have
in view the original policy, which encouraged
many purchases of these lands for homes and
discouraged the massing of large areas.
Exclusive of Alaska, about three-fifths
of the national domain has been
sold or subjected to contract or grant.
Of the remaining two-fifths a considerable por
tion is either mountain or desert. A rapidly
increasing population creates a growing demand
for homes, and accumulation of wealth inspires
an eager competition to obtain the public land
for speculative purposes. In the future this
collision of interests will be more marked than
in the past, and the execution of the nation’s
trust in behalf of our settlers will be more diffi
cult. I therefore commend to your attention
the recommendations contained in the report of
the Secretary of the Interior with reference to
the repeal and modification of certain of our
land laws.
RAILROAD LAND GRANTS AND SUBSIDIES.
The nation has made princely grants and sub
sidies to a system of railroads projected as great
national highways to connect the Pacific States
with the East, it has been charged that these
donations from the people have been diverted
to private gain and corrupt uses, and thus public
indignation has been aroused, and suspicion en
gendered. Our great nation does not begrudge
its generosity, but it abhors peculation and
fraud, and the favorable regal'd of our people for
the great corporations to which these grants
were made can only be revived by a restoration
of confidence, to be secured by their constant,
unequivocal and clearly manifested integrity.
A faithful application of the undiminished pro
ceeds of the grants to the construction and per
fecting of their roads, an honest discharge of
their obligations and entire justice to all the
people in the enjoyment of their rights on these
highways of travel, is all tho public asks, and it
will be content with no less. To secure these
things should be the common purpose of the
officers of the Government, as well as of the cor
porations. With this accomplished, prosperity
would be permanently secured to the roads and
national pride would" take the place of national
comp laint.
THE PATENT OFFICE.
The operations of the patent office demon
strate tho activity of the inventive genius of the
country. For the” year ended Juno 30, 1885, the
applications for patents, including reissues, and
for tho registration of trade-marks and labels,
numbered 35,088. During the same period
there were 22,928 patents granted and reissued,
and 1,429 trade-marKs and labels registered.
The number of patents issued in the year 1875
was 14,387. The receipts during the last fiscal
year were §1,074,974.35, and the total expendi
tures, not including contingent expenses, §934,-
123.11.
There was 9,788 applications for patents pend
ing on the first day of July, 1881, and 5,785 on the
same date in the year 1885. There has beep con
siderable improvement made in the prompt de
termination of applications and a consequent
relief to expectant inventors. A number of sug
gestions and recommendations aro contained in
the report of the Commissioner of Patents which
are well entitled to the consideration of Con
gress.
POLYGAMY.
In the Territory of Utah the law of the United
States passed for tho suppression of polygamy
has been energetically and faithfully executed
during the past year with measurably good re
sults. A number of convictions have been se
cured for unlawful cohabitation, and in some
cases pleas of guilty have been entered and
slight punishment imposed upon promise by tho
accused that they would hot again offend
against the law, nor advise, counsel, aid, or
abet in any way its violation by others.
Tho Utah Commissioners express the opinion
based upon such Information as they are able to
obtain, that but few polygamous marriages have
taken place in the Territory during the last
year. They further report that,” while there
cannot bo found upon tho registration lists of
voters the name of a man actually guilty of
polygamy, and while none of that class' are
holding office, yet, at the last election in the
Territory, all the officers elected except in one
county wore men who, though not actually living
in the practice of polygamy, subscribed to tho
doctrine of polygamous marriages as a divine
revelation and a law unto all, higher ,
and more binding upon the conscience j
than any human law, local or national, j
j This is the strong spectacle presented by a com
-1 munijy protected by a republican form of gov
■ eminent to which they owe allegiance, sustain
j ing by their suffrages a principle and a belief
j which sets at naught that obligation of absolute
, obedience to the law which lies at the founda
! tion of republican institutions. The strength,
the perpetuity, and the desciny of the nation
rest upon our homos established by the law of
God, guarded by parental care, regulated by pa
rental authority, and sanctified by parental love.
These are not the homes of polygamy. The
mothers of our land who rule the nation as they
would the characters, and guide the actions of
their sons, live according to God’s holy ordin
ance, and t ch, pure and happy in the exclusive
love of the father of her ‘ children, sheds
the warm light of true womanhood,
unperverted and unpolluted, upon all with
in her pure and wholesome family circle.
These are not *he cheerless, crushed, and un
womanly mothers of polygamy.
The fathers of our families are the best citi
zens of the Republic ; wife and children are the
sources of patriotism, and conjugal and parental
affection beget devotion to country. The man
who, undefiled with plural marriage, is sur
rounded in his single home with his wife and
children, has a stake in tho country which in
spires him with respect for its laws and courage
for their defense. Those are not the fathers of
polygamous families. There is no feature of
this practice or cho system which sanctions it
which is not opposed to all that is of value in
our institutions.
There should be no relaxation in the firm but
just execution of the law now in operation, and
I should be glad to approve such further dis
creet legislation as will rid this country of this
blot upon its fair fame. Since the people up
holding polygamy in our Territories are re-en
forcod by immigration from other lands, I rec
ommend that a law bo passed to prevent the
importation of Mormons into the country.
ANIMAL DISEASES.
The prohibition of the importation into several
countries of certain of our animals and their
products, based upon the suspicion that health
is endangered in their use and consump
tion, suggests the importance of such
precautions for the protection of our
stock of all kinds against disease as
will disarm suspicion of danger and cause
the removal of such an injurious prohibition.
If the laws now in operation are insufficient to
accomplish this protection, I recommend their
amendment to meet the necessities of the situ
ation, and I commend to tho consideration of
Congress the suggestions contained in the report
of the Commissioner of Agriculture calculated
to increase the value and efficiency of this de
partment.
CIVIL-SERVICE REFORM.
The report of the Civil-Service Commission,
which will be submitted, contains an account o£
the manner in which the Civil-Service law has
been executed during the last year and much
valuable information on this important subject.
I am inclined to think that there is no senti-i
ment more general in the minds of the people
j of our country than a conviction of the correct
ness of the principles upon which the law en-
I forcing civil service reform is based.
In its present condition the law regulates
only part of the subordinate public po
sitions throughout the country. It ap
plies tests of fitness to applicants for these
places by moans of a competitive examination
and gives large discretion to the commissioners
as to the character of the examination and many
other matters connected with its execution.
Thus the rules and regulations adopted by the
commission have much to do with the
practical usefulness of the statute and
with the results of its application.
The people may well trust the commission to
execute the law with perfect fairness and with
as little irritation as is jjossible. But of course
no relaxation of the principle which underlies
it and no weakening of the safeguards wldch
surround it can bo expected. Experience in its
administration will probably suggest an amend
i ment of the methods of its execution, but I vent
ure to hope that we never shall again be remit
ted to the system which distributes public posi
tions purely as rewards for partisan service.
Doubts may well be entertained whether our
Government could survive the strain of a con
tinuance of this system, which, upon every
change of administration, inspires an immense
army of claimants for office to lay siege to the
patronage of the Government, engrossing the
the time of public officers with their importun
ities, spreading abroad the contagion of
their disappointment, and filling the air
with the tumult of their discontent.
The allurements of an immense number of
offices and places exhibited to the voters of the
land, and the promise of their bestowal in
recognition of partisan activity, debauch the
suffrage and rob political action of its
thoughtful and deliberative character. The
evil would increase with the multiplication
of offices consequent upon our extension,
and the mania for office-holding, growing
from its indulgence, would pervade our popu
lation so generally that patriotic purpose, the
desire for the public good and solicitude for thp
nation's welfare, would be nearly banished from
the activity of our party contests and cauab
them to degenerate into ignoble, selfish and dis
graceful struggles for the possession of offied
and public place.
Civil-service reform, enforced by law, came
not too soon to check the progress of demoraliza
tion. One of its effects, not enough regarded,
the freedom it brings to the political action of
those conservative and sober men who, in fear
of the confusion and risk attending an arbitrary
and sudden change in all the public offices with
change of party rule, cast their ballots against
such a change.
Parties seem to be necessary, and will con
tinue to exist. Nor can it be now denied thafc
there are legitimate advantages not disconnected
with offlceholding which follow party supremacy.
While partisanship continues bitter and pro
nounced, and supplies so much of motive to seh
timent and action, it is not fair to hold publi6
officials, in charge of important trusts, responsi
ble for the best results in the performance <A
their duties and yet insist that they shall rely, ijj
confidential and important places, upon the work
or those not only opposed to them in political
affiliation, but so steeped in partisan preju
dice and. rancor that they have no loyalty
to their chiefs and no desire for their suc
cess. Civil service reform does not exact
this, nor does it require, that those in subor
dinate position who fail in yielding their
best service, or who are incompetent, should
be restrained simply because they are in place.
The whining of a clerk discharged for indolence
or incompetency, who, though he gained his
place by the worst possible operation of the
spoils system, suddenly discovers that he is
entitled to protection under the sanction of
civil service reform, represents an idea no less
absurd than the clamor of the applicant who
claims the vacant position as his compensation
for the most questionable party work.
The civil-service law does not prevent the dis
charge of the indolent or incompetent clerk, but
it does prevent supplying his place with the
unfit party worker. Thus in both the phases
is seen benefit to the public service.
And the people, who desire good government,
having secured this statute, will not relinquish
its benefits without protest, nor are they un
mindful of the fact that its full advantages can
only be gained through the complete good faith
of those having its execution in charge, and this
they will insist upon.
I recommend that the salaries of the Civil
Service Commissioners be increased to a sum
more nearly commensurate with their important
duties.
THE GOVERNMENT LIBRARY.
It is a source of considerable and not un
natural discontent that no adequate provision
has yet been made fox the accommodation of
the principal library of the Government.
A consideration of the fact that the library of
the Capitol has twice been destroyed or dam
aged by fire, its daily increasing value and its
importance as a place of deposit for books under
the law relating to copyright make manifest the
necessity of prompt action to insure its proper
accommodation and protection.
DISTRICT MATTERS.
My attention has been called to a controversy
which has arisen from the condition of the law
relating to railroad facilities in the city of
Washington, which has involved the Commis
sioners of the District in much annoyance and
trouble. I hope the difficulty will be promptly
settled by appropriate legislation.
THE PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION.
The present condition of the law relating to
the succession to the Presidency in the event of
the death, disability, or removal of both
the President and Vice President, is such
as to require immediate amendment,
This subject has repeatedly been con
sidered by Congress, but no result
has been reached. The recent lamentable
death of the Vice President and the vacancies
at the same time in all other offices, the incum
bents of which might immediately exercise the
functions of the Presidential office, has caused
public anxiety and a just demand that a recur
rence of sucha condition of affairs should not be
permitted.
CONCLUSION.
In conclusion, I commend to the wise care and
thoughtful attention of Congress the needs and
the welfare of the American Nation. To sub
ordinate these to the narrow advantages
of partisanship or the accomplishment
of selfish aims is to violate the people’s trust
and betray the people’s interest. But an in
dividual sense of responsibility on the
part of each. of us, end a
stem determination to perform our duty
well, must give u; place among those who have
added, in their day and generation, to the glory
and prosperity of our beloved land.
(Signed) Grover Cleveland.
Washington, Dec. 8,1835.
When a fellow is pretty well on in
years, and certain portions of him have
dropped away, such as hair and teeth*
why can't he confess it ?
