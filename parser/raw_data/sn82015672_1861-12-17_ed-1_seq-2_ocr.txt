Geo. Zollicoffer, when last beard from,
was in the vicinity of Somerset, Pulaski
county, m route for Danville. GeD. Mar
shall is moving in a direction so as to form
a speedy junction with Zollicoffer, and an
immediate attack npon Lexington and
Frankfort, together with the capture of the
Federal Legislature now in session may
with some confidence be looked for.
gea. Marshall has, it is understood, issued
ajn-oclamation to the citizens of Kentucky,
iff which be states that the Home Guard of
the different counties must join him Or fight
bits, as they will not be left in hi3 rear.
The whole country is awakening, and num
bers are daily flocking to the standard of
both Generals. It is their design 3 stated,
to advance upon Lexington and Frankfort,
no opposing force will be left in front of
the column here, and an attack upon it,
front and rear, will certainly resuu in toe
Sewa from the South.
The Norfolk Day Book of the 9th has an
article upon the peace proposition of Mr.

eopy of the Xashvillo Union and American
of December 10th. It is a dingy, hard-
looking FaPcri containing among other
things Mr. Lincoln's message .in fall. It
lacks space to comment on tne message, dui
asserts that it exposes " imbecility of intel
lect, and at the same time, a deep laid
schema cf villainy and rotbey -ef the
South."
We learn from a communication dated
Richmond, December 3rd, that on the Sun
day evening previous, Henry A. Wise, jr.,
preached a sermon fromtthe text "Give us
this day our daily bread.'' A more appro
priate subject could not have been selected
by Henry. He eontondi-d that a special
providence had been manifest from the mo
ment the Star of the West turned her prow
out cf Charleston harbor until now, and
predicted an ultimate and glorious triumph
for the rebel cause.
The same correspondent says considerable
snow fell the night before, and considerablee
speculation w:is afloat as to its effect on
army movements. He thinks of the long
delay ot the mails likely to follow, and
roundly asserts that he " 13 not satisfied t
get his TJnijn and American once a week
as the Confederate Poit Master General and
railroad men are." Speaking of Kentucky,
be expresses thi wish - that she had been
more largely represented in her sovereignty
convention, bat concludes that "half a loaf
is better tL.ui no bread," and "expects large
additions to the present slice when .the
riflts cf Tcnneaeceans brgin to ring In the
great day at Columbus."
Tie same correspondent learns from an
authentic source " that President Davis baa

in all probability, result in the resiggfltiajg

A True Man tn the Kentucky Legis
lature. On the 11th inst., a resolution was intro-
duced in the lower House of the Kentucky
Legislature, returning the thanks of the
General Assembly to the brave and loyal
volunteers who were aiding the government -in
expelling the invaders from the state.
The resolution was adopted, but a clique of
secessionists eleven in number, voted nay,
whereupon Mr. Richard T. Jacob, the bold
and feariess member from Oldbaro county,
introduced the following :
"Resolved, That a select Committee be in
structed to inquire why gentlemen in this
House eive aid and comfort to the invaders

It is the desire of .11 to Dress Neatly, Taatarully, Oeateelly, and as Economical!
.1 possible.
Now, "let ns reason together," and endearor to ascertain what will be the propi
coarse to pursue, in order to attain the desired end.
First. We should purchase Good Article! of Apparel, that will retain their col
and glow, as .11 inferior, cetton-mixed clotbi will, in a very short time, loan the!
color and glow, aad give the wearer a superannuated appearance, and cause nim to io
as though the sun of his prosperity was on the wane.
Secondlo. A Good Fitting Garment, properly adjusted to the fo'js end prop
tions of the wearer, ii much more Bervicble .nd latiifectory than . graceless flttf
article. And Clothing properly made, cut in good style, .nd trimmed durably af
neatly, will wear fully twice as long, look much better while it does wear, and cost
little more then common Machine-made, Slop-Shop Goods.
Thirdly. In order to obtain Clothing- combining the qualities .dot. mentlotl
we recommend the citiiens ot Vanderburgh .nd the adjoining counties, auo also
friends in Kentucky, to call at
nee "L1 ""T " yy,Km Clothing and Furbishing Good! err day, by
