ganjCounty Republican, Chicago Inter

We suppose that the Bulgarian
nations, who have so quickly and com
pletely whipped Turkey, (something
like the licking the Progressives gave
the Taft Republicans) when they make
a treaty of peace will leave the fort
ifications, ammunition and offices with
the Turks that would be civil service
they having held these, some of them
a long time, and know how. It seems
that Taft has put the Democracy in
that kind of a fix by placing many
thousands of postmasters into the civil
service, and without the postofficcs
what't the use?
We make a specialty of expert
watches repairing, and our prices are

Most farmers arc done gathering
their corn and it is a fair yield.
Farmers in general are not alarmed
over the howl about hard timea under
the Democratic Adminstrtaion. It is
hoped that Prof. Wilson has the back'
bone to prevent such calamities but
we belive such calamities can come
under the Republican adminstation
as well under the Democratic admin-
stration. It takes a man, with back
bone like I eddy to tell the money
power keep your money, I'll issue
bonds.

We hear and icad so much about
good road movements, our roads have
mostly been worked lately, the writer
thinks roads that are worked or grad
ed late in the fall and left with a sweet
potato row in the middle is money
squandered. Raod working mustjbc
more systemmatic, not too big a ter
ritory. Also elect township officers
such as townsdip trustee. It is natura
that people are mostly interested in
their road at home and not three or
five miles from home. The township
trustees should meet every month to
make plans for building culverts and
to purchase nassary tools to work the
roads and to hire such road supcrten-
dento that know how to work the road
and then let him make it a business.
Poll tax should all be worked out
by July 1st either by hauling gravel or
open clogged ditches, cut down hedge
rows. A culbert or amall bridge that
costs only $50. should be turned over
to the county commissioner and let
the county pay such costs. A dirt
road should absolutly not be graded
late in the fall, but if so it should be
well harrowed down, ditches opened.
We know this plan would work
wonderou? on our, roudf in Morgan
county.
