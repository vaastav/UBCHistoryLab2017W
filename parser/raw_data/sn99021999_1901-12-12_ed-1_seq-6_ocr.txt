With inoro than SL'.'O.QOO on deposit In
tho city depositories, the condition of
Omaha's treasury does not justify any
apprehensions of llunuclnl embarrass
ment In the conduct of tho city govern
ment. A woman's missionary society Is said
to have decided to undertake the refor

"pastor of Chicago." Now watch tho

The Incorporation of projected rail
roads does not always assure their con
struction. If all the railroads that have
been Incorporated In this state had been
built, no new roads, branches or exten

during the remainder of the twentieth
cuntury.
Tho early announcement of the house

Mayor Moores will never be able to

as a tool of monopoly and an obstructor
of Omaha's commercial development.
Now that he has signed the ordinance,
ho Is accused of trying to pose as "anil
monop." '
Now Is tho time for those heavy prop
erty owners to get In their work for a
reduced city tax rate. Waiting until
the levy ordinance Is before the council
nnd then muklng grandstand talks about
economy will not accomplish half as
much as insisting on the return, of uu
taxed corporate franchises on the as
sessment lists at something like their
proper valuation.

to Introduce Industrial enterprises and

Tho Klfty-seventh congress promises.
bo far at least as tho house of represent
atives Is concerned, to make as good a
record as a business congress as did Itw
predecessor. The prompt annolntiiu.nt
of the house committees by Speaker
Henderson clearly Indicates his Inteo-
Hon to have tho work of the session
pushed as rapidly as practicable aud In
this he will doubtless have tho suiumrt
of tho majority. .Mr. Cannou, chairman
of tho committee on appropriations, has
already named the sub-committees,
which will begin at onco the prepara
tion of the several appropriation bills.
-Mr. Cannon has expressed the onliilnn
that all the work on appropriations
could be disposed of so that congress
could adjourn by .June 1. The house
Judiciary committee will meet today to
begin consideration of such iiuestlons
as It has charge of. The chairmen of
other house committees are manifesting
a like zeal for pushing business, so that
there Is every assurance that in the
house the work of legislation will tint
be unduly delayed.
Huslnoss cannot be urged forward In
tho senate as in the house, but tlm in.
Mentions are that the minority In tho
senate will not go to an extreme In
using Its privilege of obstruction and de
lay, so that there Is reason to expect
that in tne senate also the work of loir-
lslatlon will proceed mote rapidly at this
session than usual. There Is a great deal
to be done, much of It of the highest
Importance and demanding the most
curet til consideration, but If congress
men win apply themselves with dill-
genie they ought to accomplish the work

There are differences of a more or
less Important nature between the canal
bill Introduced In tho house of repre
sentatives by .Mr. Hepburn and the one
introduced In tho senate by .Mr. Mor
gan. Knch provides that the limit of
cost sharl be !?1KO,000,(HM), which is less
than the estimate of tho canal comm!
slou, but the house bill makes $10,000,
000 available for Immediate use, whllo
the senate provides for only half that
amount. The senate bill provides that
tho control of the canal and the terri
tory through which It passes shall bo
vested In a board of eight citizens of
the United States in addition to tho
secretary of war, while the house bill
places the whole control of tho con
struction of the canal in charge of the
secretary of war. These are perhaps not
vital dlll'erences and doubtless no dllll
culty will be found In arranging them
between the two houses.
The senate canal bill appears to be
the more complete and comprehensive
of the two measures, but It contem
plates a largi annual expenditure for a
commission the necessity of which Is
not apparent. If a commission to con
trol the canal Is required It would seem
that half the number provided for In
this bill, with tho secretary of war,
t.F.l
Would bo sutllcleiit. It Is a question
whether the canal, at least for some
years, will pay the expense of manage
incut and therefore congress should au
thorize no expenditure not absolutely
necessary. There Is no doubt (hat the
enterprise will cost a great ileal more
than the limit Ilxed In the bills, which
Is about .I0,0(KMMK) below tho sum esti
mated by the canal commission, so that
while a reasonably liberal policy Is do
slrable there should be no extravagance
In old lay.
Neither of these measures will bo
acted upon at once, but will await the
ratlllcatlon of tho caunl treaty and In
the meantime there will be opportunity
for their public discussion.
MAXItEST FA VOlllTlSU.
The action of the Honrd of Hevlew In
reducing the assessments of the street
railway and gas company nearly ?700,
000 below the valuation fixed by the tnx
commissioner will scarcely meet the ap
proval of the Individual taxpayers of
Omaha. Tho assessment of the gas
company at .f.'ISO.OOO Is the same ns last
year, although far below the relative
assessment of other taxablo property.
The assessment of the street railway
coiupany Is raised to $4"r,000, or $1!5,000
more than last year.
In their undue zeal to favor these
corporations the members of the Honrd
of Ilevlew seem to have overdone the
thing altogether. If the Increase of
?i.",000 in the street railway assessment
represents thu extensions and better
ments made by that company within
the past year, why should not the Im
provements and extensions made by the
gas company during the past year also
be appraised and returned at their pro
portionate value?
The presumed basis of assessment Is
10 per cent of tho actual or market
value. At that ratio the actual value
of the gas company would bo ?!.'0,000
and of the street railway company
!?1,1S7,"00. A low estimate of the mar
ket value of tho gas company's prop
erty Is $11,000,000 aud of the street rail
way In Omnha at least $.'1,000,000. In
other words, the ratio of assessment for
these corporations, Instead of being -10
per cent, Is less than 'JO per cent of the
very lowest estimated value.
Such discrimination against the great
body of tuxpaylng citizens is Inexcus
able. Tho properties of these corpora
tions are productive and their value Is
enhanced largely by the franchises nnd
contracts that give them practically a
monopoly of public patronage. The use
of the public thoroughfares Is capital
ized by them and their revenues enable
them to pay handsome dividends on this
capitalization.
With all these advantages and privi
leges, It Is surely not unreasonable on
the part of the city to exact from them
their due proportion of taxes for main
taining the municipal government.
The ltlll Introduced tiy Congressman
Mercer granting the right to n South
Omaha company to build a railway,
street railway, motor, vehicle and foot
bridge across the Missouri river, be
tween South Omaha and south Council
Bluffs, has tho aspect of a connecting
link between the air lino system of elec
tric suburban railroads for which Mr.
Mercer's man Friday recently sought to
procure a half-century franchise from
the Hoard of County Commissioners.
Whether there Is any more capital be
hind the projected bridge between South
Omaha aud south Council Hlutl's than
there was behind the multiplex subur
ban electric road franchise Is not yet
apparent to the ordinary observer. It
Is simply another Ingenious scheme for
handling franchises on a brokerage
basis to be bought up by existing street
car and bridge companies. At any rate
no sane capitalist would be reckless
enough to expend over a half million
dollars upon such a bridge with thu full
knowledge that the bridges already In
operation can accommodate all the
tralllc between the twin cities for years
to come.
The Italian government has Instructed
Its consuls In this country to look after
the interests of the immigrants killed
In the recent Michigan railroad wreck.
Nothing more pitiful can be Imagined
than the condition of these helpless Im
migrants In a strange land whoso tongue
they are unable to speak suddenly be
reft of father, mother, relatives or
friends in such a horrible manner. The
railroad company will naturally II ml
Itself called 'upon to make good In dam
ages a part of the Incalculable loss.
The promptness of tho Italian govern
ment In Instructing Its representatives
to take care of tho victims of that na
tionality, notwithstanding the fact that
they have Just renounced their rest
deuce If not allegiance to their coun
try, Is certainly commendable.
Ceneral Manager Webster of the Hast
Omaha Hridge anil Terminal company
feels sure no opposition from any source
will bo encountered by the bill giving
permission to his company to put In a
steel draw span in place of the present
wood piling of tho western portion of
the terminal bridge. In this General
Manager Webster Is eminently cor
rect, but there Is a great deal of oppo
sition In this community to the attempt
to evade local taxation on this property
merely because It Is being used by Inter
state railroads. Hy the same reasoning
the Douglas street bridge should be ex
empted from local taxation because It
Is used by an Interstate street car line
between Omaha and Council Hlull's.
Instead of censuring the Chicago pa
pers for printing alarming reports about
the condition of Omnhu's tluancial Insti
tutions, the Commercial club should di
rect Itself to tho local paper that sought
to create a sensation by publishing
lurid statements of impending collapse
of one of our loan companies which
brought on a run on a city savings bank.

Tho bill to establish a United States
branch mint in Omaha has again bien
Introduced In the lower house of con
gress by the non-resident representative
from this district. When this bait wos
tlrst thrown Into tho congressional tlbh
pond thirty years ago It caught some
suckers, but nobody Is so silly now as to
even nibble at It. Hvory well-Informiil
person knows that the existing branch
mints can coin all the silver bullion for
which there Is a demand without work
Ing more than hnlf time, nnd there Is
not tho remotest probability that the
demand will come up to their full cif-
paclty within the next fifty years.
One of the features of King Kdward's
coronation festivities is to be it gigantic
naval demonstration, to which each In

competition for the distinction brisk.
Had such an exhibition been planned for
the coronation of the king's Illustrious

New bids for tho winter supply of

And now the furniture makers of the

The American Federation of Labor

Secretary Oago recommends for repeal all
tho miscellaneous war taxes. Thcsu Items,
which do not Includo tho tea duty and the
Incrcosed taxes on fermented liquors, to-
hacco and mixed flour, produce about $27,-
000,000. They are, as tho secretary cor
rectly says, "In their naturo vexatious, In
somo Instances oppressive and separately
considered yield hut small rovenue."
Thorcfore, these taxes should by nil means
bo repealed forthwith. Tho surplus will
bo reduced somewhat. Thu taxpayers will
uso this 27, 000,000 to bettor ndvnntagn than
congress will. It will not bo dltllcult for
congress to find taxes which enn ho scaled
down to such an extent as to maku tho re
maining $22,000,000 which tho sccrotnry nf
tho treasury thinks tho government can
safely got along without. Tho clangors of
a surplus havo been forcibly stated by
Speaker Henderson. Tho republicans In
congress cannot safely disregard his warn
ing. Hy lotting tho taxpayers havo this
$50,000,000 which tho government does not
nerd, and which thoy do, congress will onru
their thanks and will not bo exposed to the
temptations of so great a surplus.

During tho session of congress It Is more
than likely that an effort will bo mailo to
secure legislation looking toward tho adop
tion ot tho postal bavlngs bank system
In tho United States.
Tho argumonts which tho friends of this
proposed mpasuro make In Its behalf aro
worthy of consideration. In tho first placo.
It Is claimed that tho system will Inspire
confldenco on tho part of small depositors,
slnco It will havo back of It tho resources
of tho federal govornnient, ond that, on oc
count of tho nbsoluto security which It
offers, It will provo an incentive to thrift.
In tho second place, It Is claimed that the
system can bo maintained without any very
great expense to the government, slnco It
Is only necofcsary to provldo for nn exten
sion In each postotllco.
If tho system Is put into effect It will
relieve In largo measuro tho pressure
which Is now brought to henr upon tho
money order department of tho government
and what will be saved In this direction
will contrlbuto largoly toward defraying
the expenses of tho system proposed.
Most of tho Kuropcan countries havo
adopted tho system with good results and
If It works satisfactorily abroad, there
scorns to bo no rt-aaon why It should nut bu
put on trial at home.

well as that which stands for actual prop
erty. It has found means to make Its will
law, In tho most literal senso. Congress

Yet sugar Is strnngcly cheap In comparison

growth. Its ofllcers rcallzo that If they ilo
not smother new rivals In their Infancy
thero will soon bo altogether different con
ditions In tho sugar trade.
licet sugar Is tho true cattfe ot lower
prices for tho products of the American
Sugar Refining company. It Is the solo
reason why tho sugar trust has been unablo
to sharo In tho general movemont tqwnrd
higher prices for food staples. And tho
extreme cheapness uf sugar, In comparison
with other products. Is tho evidence of
unfair,, cut-throat competition with the new
refiners who make sugar from beets.
Tho trust is trying to kill nn American
Industry which Is full of promise for tho
future. It Is striving to smother ono of tho
greatest enterprises ever undertaken In the
way of substituting domestic for foreign
products. A notable expansion of Ameri
can ngrlculturo will be prevented If tho
trust has Its way, nnd In tho end the people
will pay tho cost.
Unnaturally low prices for refined sugar
will surely bo followed, If the beet sugar
Industry can bo smothered, by abnormally
high charges. Tho trust will get even with
Its customers for all tho advantage It fecl3

certain.
Tho real causo of cheapness In n trust
product Is tho new competition with tho

snys ho was received with much rejoicing,

ho begins to fuel ns though ho had never
wandered awny from thu homo of his youth.
Hut this distinguished anion still cherishes
ideas about expansion which aro not popu
lar with tho party to which ho acknowl
edges allegiance and Is wont to lllustrnto
his point of view by the following story:
"Out In my country nn old fanner In
vested In somo hogs ono spring, paying
therefor 3 cents a pound. After keeping
the nulmnlu nil Miinmcr nnd feeding them
ou thu best he had ho sold them In tho nil
tumn for exactly what ho paid for them, .1
cents n pound.
"'How In nil creation do you expect to
ninko any money selling hogs nt that rato?1
asked a neighbor who hoard of tho trans
action. " 'I've no renson to comph In ns 1 enn

ciety of tho hoga nil summer?' "
Harry Slnclntro, a MIssourinn viewing tho
sights nt Washington, talked about census
statistics to a Washington Pout Intorvluwer
nnd gavo his story a Missouri valley flavor.
"I am not Informed," ho snld, "as to how
tho cities of thu cat fared, but I can statu
thnt throughout tho west thero Is hardly n
town of over 10,000 population but get tho
worst of thu cuiibus leturns, Thu only city
I can think of Just now that was overrated
is St. Joseph, in my tate. In 1S90 tho fed
eral census gavo St. Joseph about 00,000 In
habitants, 1 believe. Last year St. Joseph
was recorded as having n population of
103,000. Everybody In Missouri who does
not llvo in St. Joseph ndmits thnt tho city
got many thousands tho best of It.
"That reminds mo of a rather good Joke
on Omnhn. When tho federal census of
1890 was taken Omnha wns In the mldt of
Its first boom. Tho promoters wanted thn
town to show up as well ns possible, so
they got out nnd helped tho enumerators,
quietly, ot course. Whllo I don't remember
tho exact returns' nt that tlmu, yet I hnow
they wero in excess of tho correct figures.
Well, Inst yenr, no particular nssletnnro
was given tho enumerators, nnd tho results,
ot course, was that tho population fell oft
about 15,000 from 1890. As n matter of
fact, Omaha Is bigger In every way and
has a greater population than It hod ten
years ago."

Philadelphia Hecor.l.
Plnns of nmbltlous nrcliltirts for nn ar
tistic reconstruction of the White House nt
Washington havo been put forward moro
ur less insistently ever slnco the Cleveland
Incumbency and the subsequent Harrison
Installation made it clar that the execu
tive mansion had been outgrown. Many n
time nnd oft has it been demonstrated by
experts with tho pencil and T-squnro thnt
nothing but tho lack of a fat appropriation
by congress prevented them from making of
tho White House a palace for nfllclnllsm, a
parndlse for dnimsllclty nnd a noble ex
cmplnr of the house beautiful for genera
tions yet to rome.
With the Roosevelt family, domiciled In
this classic llttlo structure, nrtlstlc and
ncadopile discussion mtut be suspended for
a reason, No Amerlrnn gentleman with
half n dozen growing children could find
the comforts of home la n building so do
voted to official purposes ns Is the present
executive mansion. Hut tho relief desired
by Mr. Rocsevelt Is not In line with current
nrchlteclutnl schemes for transforming the
historic Whlto House Into an unrecognized
single block In n v.'ibL mosaic of modem
construction. His notion Is to keep tho
Whlto House lntncl and unchanged nnd to
construct a now executlvo budding on land
adjacent to tho splendid structure devoted
to tho Trnnsury department. Hero might
be held the great hnnquets, balls and re
ceptions nrrnnged nt the Instance ot thi
president, nnd hero nlso tho ofllclnl and
clerlcnl work of tho executlvo olllco might
bo cnrrlcd on In Its entirety. The old
Whlto Homo would then, after due Interior
remodeling and refurnishing, serve ad
mirably for many years yet to como ns n
prlvato domicilii for nny citizen intrusted
with executive authority.
A hill to provldo for tho proposed new
executive structure has already been In
troduced In tho sonnte, nt tho request of
tho president, nnd it is quite possible. In
the.se days of llghtnlng-IIke construction,
that Mr. Roosevelt In his own person mny
derive official nnd Individual ndvontngo and
satisfaction from tho finished edifice. Thoro
Is no good renson why tho executive busi
ness olllco should lio in tho president's
house, contrnry to prevailing practlco In
every other official quarter. Should Mr.
Roosevelt succeed In reforming this prac
tice, while retaining Intact and unmutllntcd
the time-honored homo of so many Ameri
can presidents, tho grateful appreciation
of the nation would bo his to command.
Tho White Houso Is for tho president's
family; executive business is but a lusty
and overgrown Intruder. .
