low who throws his sweetheart a

DaSsel Anchors- Very soon the
state board, of .control will be a

cratic machine owned and controlled
by the "kitchen kabinet." The legis

control idea and start all over again
to. make it a business instead of a
political organization.
Indianapolis News: Lively times
ahead if there is really to be a
"scrap" between MF:. Taft and the
Cannon-Aldrich outfit. It is easy to
guess on which side the people will
be ranged.
Morris Tribune: El W. Randall
has been signally honxired by being
elected president of the Minnesota
Mutual Life Insurance- Company of
St. Paul/ and has already taken up

Windom Citizen: Andrew Carne
gie has made the startling statement
that1 pur "infant industries" no long

oilr thread, svtgaf and steel should

is significant coining from the form

cents for paper, press work, binding

bound in "boards" with a split
leather back, which sells for $1,
costs not more than .20 cents.
Midway News: To say that a
man is "grouchy" because he did not
realize upon a given ambition, or to
charge another with being: "vindic

unpardonable, injury, or to impugn
one's motives in the discussion of 7
