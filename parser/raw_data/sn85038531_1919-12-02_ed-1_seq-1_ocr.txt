General recommendations on
legislation to combat the cost of
i living, labor, unrest, radicalism
, and a readjustment of the nation
to peacetime basis were the fea
... tureftPresidenl, Wilson's nn
' nual messlgi tftVtdngress deliv

The peace, treatyy the presi
dent told congress, would be
discussed in a separate message
later, , as will the railrpad ques
tion. .
For the second time only since
, the ' presfdent established the
-iractice of addressing congress
; m person his message was read
todav by the clerks. '
'- Principal Recommendations. '
The president's principal recom
inendations-were:
Establishment of a budget system
f for the national finances.
Reorganization of the -taxation sys
tem with (simplification of the ln
come and excess profit. ,,
Readjustmenrttf the tariff system
if necessary," to meet chanped Vorld
conditions and make the system con
from. with 4he fact that the United
States is ."the greatest capitalist in
me world-" , ;,. , -. ... . .
,; Uecognitlon and relief for veteran
soldiers of the world war, Dartlcu-
laify in the way of ajoyernment farms
. ua propunea ny necreiary, l-nne.
Proper measures to fostr r the dye
. stuffs industry built up -d-ticing- the
war. to keep the United JTfntes inde
pendent of fprv I fflPy. '
' velopiwnt, In recognition of the
i? tormers' part in the war.,, ,
' Measures which "will remove the
'y 'causes?' of "political restlessness in
bodyjTiolitic."
A. V Causes Not Doop-Ssated.
-! fi-At, WTls point the president made
'. his most extensive reference to the
'. Peace treaty by saying the causes for
the unrest "nro superficial i rather
'than deep-seated," nnd that they
"rise from, or ore -connected with,
,' tlj failure on the part of our R-overn-ment
to arrive speedily at a'just and
permanent pence permitMosr return to
I'ormnl conditions, from the transfu
.' r'nn of radical theories from seething
Kuroneari centers pending such de
J li.v from heartless profileerinR, re
4: snltinjr from lite increase of the cost
of livinjr, and lastly from the ma
" I'hinatlons of pixwiunato and ,mnlo
" vort nKit"torn. XYith the return to nor
ma? conditions this unrest will rapidly
v uir-.i ,icui .
i The president renewed his recora
: ; mendntions for legislation to deal ef
j fnottvelj" with "those persons who, by
violent methods, would abrogate our
f time-tested institutions."
Several recommendations, some re
: rewnls of previous ones, v(r? made
' lv the president to bring- down the
cost of living1. Amomr them were ex
tension of the food control law to
! neuce times for the emergency; regu-
l.ttions for transportation of foods in
interstate commerce; a cold storage
law modelled after the law in New
.Jersey; a law requiring; marks to
' show the length of time foods are
kept in rtoratje and a law to secure
" 'competitive selling and prevent un-
-eonscipnablc profits" by federal li
cense of corporations selling food in
Interstate commerce.
A long portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the con
dition and rights of labor. "A deli
ni program to bring about an im
provement in the conditions of labor
nnd bring about "genuine democrati
zation of industry," was recom
mended, "The onlv way to keep men from
agitating against grievances is to
remove the grievances," said the
president's message. At another point
it declared "the seed of revolution is
repression."
"The establishment of the prin
ciples regarding labor, laid down in
th- covenant of the league of na
tions." said the message, "offers us
the way to Industrial peace luid con
ciliation. No other road lies open to
us. Covcrnments must rec
ognize the right or men to bargain
collectively for humane objects.
'. Labor must no longer be
treated as a commodity.
'The light of Individuals to strike
is inviolate," continued the mesage,
"and ought not to be interfered with
by any process of government, hut
there is a predominant right, and
that is the right of the government
to protect all of its people and to as
sert its power and mujesty against
the challenge of any class."
The president was referring to
. ,the government's recent injunction
against the coal strike.
The message closed with a poinfed
refernce to radicalism and red doc
trines and referred to "Russia today
with its blood and terror" as a
"painful object lesson of the power
of minorities."
"There are those in this country,
said the message, "who threaten di
rect aMon to force their will upon
a majority, It makes little
difference what minority it is;
whether capital or labor, or any
other class;, no rort of privilege will
ever be permitted to dominate this
country" Orderly proces-jos, the njea
sage declared, were the only ones
by which relief and reform could be
obtained.
"Tho who would propoe any
other method or rerorm are entrain
this country," the mesage said.

Text of President's
Message to Congress
(By International News Service.)
Washington, Dec. 2. President
Wilson's message to the Sixty-sixth
congress was in par V as follows: .
To the Senate and House of Representatives:-
, i
I sincerely regret that I can-,
not be present at the opening of
this session of the congress. I am A
inus prevemea irom presenting;
in as direct a way as I could
wish, the many questions that
are pressing for solution at this
time. Happily,- I have had the
advantage of th8 advlcs of the
heads of the several executive
departments who have kept In
closa touch with affairs In their
detail and Whose thoughtful rec
ommendations I earnestly second.
In the matter of the railroads and
" the readjustment of their affairs
growing out of federal control, I
shall take the liberty- at a later
date of addressing you.
I hope that congress will bring
' to a conclusion at this session
legislation looking; to the estah-
Mshhient of a budget system. That
'there should be one single" au
thority responsible for the mak
ing of all appropriations and that
approprWWMls HtWiltf' be made
not Independently of each other,
but with reference to one single
comprehensive plan of expendi
ture, properly related to the na
tion's Income, there can be no
doubt.
I believe the burden of pre
paring the budget must, in the
nature of the case, if the work Is '
to be properly done and responsl-
bllity concentrated Instead of
divided, rest upon the executive.
The budget, sot prepared should,
be' submitted Iq, and.approved or
amended by a single committee
of each house of congress and no'
single appropriation should be
made by the congress, except
such as may have been included
in the budget prepared by the
executive or added by the partic
ular committee of congress
charged with the budget legisla
tion., ; . ,
- . Would Provide Auditing.
Another, and - not less impor
,' tant., aspect jf .the problem la
the ascertainment ofihfi economy
.And eWcTehVrTrjhkJaL-.tM-moneys
' appropriated are ex
pendod. Under existing taw the
only audit Is for the purpose of
ascertaining .whether expendi
tures have been lawfully made
within ' the appropriations. No
one is authorized or equipped to
ascertain whether the money has
been spent wisely, economically
and effectively. The auditors
should be highly trained officials,
with permanent tenure in the
trcassry department, free of ob
ligations to or motives of con
sideintion for this or any subse
quent administration, and au
thorized and empowered to ex
amine into and make report upon
.the methods employed and the
results obtained by the executive
departments of the government;
their reports should be made to
the congress and to the secretary
of the treasury.
' I trust that the congress will
give its Immsdiate consideration
to the problem of future taxa
tion. Simplification of the in
come and profits taxes has be
come an immediate necessity.
These taxes performed indispen
sable service during the war.
They must, however, bo simpli
fied, not only to save the tax
payer inconvenience and expense,
but in order that his liability may
be made certain and definite.
With reference to the details
of the revenue law, the secretary
of the treasury and the commis
s'oner of internal revenue will
lay before you for your consid
eration certain amendments
necessary or desirable in connec
tion with the administration jf
the law recommendations whicV
have my approval and support,
.1. is of the utmost importance
that in dealing with this matter
the present law should not be
('istiu'bed so far as regards tuxes
for the calendar year 1920, pay
able in the calendar year 1921.
The congress might well consider
whether the higher rates of in
come and profits taxes can in
peace times be effectively produc
tive of revenue, and whether they
may not, on the contrary, be de
structive of business activity
and productive of waste and in
efficiency. There Is a point at
which in peace time high rates
of income and profits taxes dis
courage energy, remove- the in
centive to new enterprise, en
courage extravagant . expendi
tures and produce industrial
stagnation, with consequent un
employment and .other attendant
evils.
Not Easy Problem.
The problem is not an easy
one. A fundamental chanjf has
taken place with reference to the
position of America in the
world's affairs. The prejudice
and passions engendered by
decades of controversy between
two schools of political and eco
nomic thought the one believers
in protection of American indus
tries, the other believers in taritt
for revenue only must be subor
dinated to the consideration of
the public interest in the light
of utterly changed conditions.
Before the war America was
heavily the debtor of the rest of
the world and the interest pay--ments
she had to make to foreign
countries on American securities
' held abroad, the expenditures of
American travelers abroad and
the ocean freight charges she had
to pay to others about balanced
the value of her pre-war favor
able balance of trade. During the
war America's exports have been
greatly stimulated, and increased
prices have increased their value.
On the other hand, she has pur
chased a large proportion of ths
American securities previously
held abroad, has loaned some
19,000.000,00 to foreHn govern
ments and has built her own
ships, ' Our favorable balance of .
. trade has thus been greatly. In
Fore;
to Be Dealt
President
creased and Europe has been de
prived of the means of meeting
i it heretofore f -inting. Europe
can have or '. tree ways of
meeting the ible balance of
trade in pel jj'.ne; by Imports
into this c . $ of gold goods,
or by est ' j. mg new , credits.
Europe if '.o' position at the
present J $ o ship gold to us,
por cow w contemplate large
further . ,-ts of gold into this
county ., .hout concern. The
time iw arly passed for inter
natlo ; ' jvernmental loans and
I'- V e time to develop in
thlsTv. iry a market for foreign
securities. Anything, therefore,
which would tend to prevent for
eign countries from settliuc for
; our exports by shipments of goods
into this country could only have
the fit-fect of preventing them
from paying for our exports and
therefore of preventing the ex
ports from being made. The pro-
. ductivity of the countrj greatly
stimulated by the war, muBt find
an outlet by exports to foreign
countries, an any measures
taken to prevent Imports will in
evitably curtail exports, force
curtailment cf production, load
the banking machinery of the
country with csedits to carry un
sold products, and produce indus
trial stagnation and unemploy
ment If we want to sell, we must
be prepared to buy. Whatever,
therefore, may have been our
views during the. period of growth
of American business concerning
tariff legislation, we must now
adjust our own economic life to
a changed condition growing out
of the fact that American busi
ness is full, grown and that
America is the greatest capitalist
in the world.
Isolation Can't Satisfy.
"No policy of isolation will sat
isfy the growing needs and oppor
tunities of America. The provin
cial standards and policies of the
paat. which have held American
business as If in a straightjacket,
must yield and give way to the
needs and exingencles of the new
I'days in which we live, a day full
.'of hope and promise for American
i business, if we will hut' take ad
vantage of. the, opportunities that
isare oura for ilj iiUng" 'The re'.
! ctffl aT"- hajljm1tJonx-tsolat1on'
and thrown upon us a great duty
and responsibility. The United
States must share the expanding
world market. The United States
desires fot "itself only equal oppor
tunity with the other notions Of
the world, nnd that through the
process of friendly co-operation and
fair competition the legitimate in
terests of the nations concerned
may he successfully and equitably
adjusted.
"There are other matters of im
portance upon which 1 urged action
at the last session of congress,
which are still pressing for solu
tion. I am sure it is not necessary
for me itgnin to remind you that
there is one immediate and very
practicable question resulting from
the war which we should meet in
the 'most liberal spirit. It is a mat
ter of recognition ,u nd relief to our
soldiers. I can dd no better than
to quote from my lust message,
urging this vffvy action:
"We must see to it that our re
turning soldiers are assisted in ev-.
ery practicable way to Ibid the
places for which they are lilted in
the daily work of the country. This
can be done by developing ami
maintaining upon an adequate
scale the admirable organization
created by the department of la
bor for placing men seeking work;
and it can also be done, in at least
one very sreat lield, by creating
new opportunities for individual en
terprise. The secretary of the in
terior has pointed out the way by
which returning soldiers may be
helped to find and take up land in
tht; hitherlo undeveloped regions of
the country which the fedural gov
ernment has already prcffired or
can readily prepare for' cultivation
and also on many of the cut-over
or neglected areas which lie with
in the limits of the older stated;
nnd I once more take the liberty
of recommending very urgently
that his plans shall receive the Im
mediate and substantial support of
congress.'
"In the matter of tariff legisla
tion, I beg to call your attention to
the statements contained Jn my last
message urging legislation with
reference to the establishment of
the chemical, and dye-stuff industry
in America:
" 'Among the industries to which
special consideration should ' be
given is that of the manufacture
if dyestuffs and related chemicals.
Our complete dependence upon Ger
man supplies before the war made
t lie Interruption of trade a cause
of exceptional economic disturb
ance. The close relation between
the manufacture of dyestuffs. on
the one hand, and of explosives
and poisonous gases on the
other, moreover, has given the in
dustry an exceptionable signifi
cance and value. Although the
Unitrd States lill gladly nnd un
hesitatingly join In the program
of international disarmament, it will
nevertheless be a policy of obvious
prodence to make certain of the
successful maintenance of many
strong and well-equipped chemical
plants.
Promote Industry.
The German chemical industry.
Which we will be brought Into com
petition with, was, and may well
be again, a thoroughly knit monop
oly, capable of exercising aVonipc
tition of a peculiarly insidious and
dangerous kind. "Inning the war
the farmer performed u vital and
willing service to the nation. By
materially Increasing the production
of his land he supplied America
and the allies with the increased
amounts of food necessary to keep
their immense nrmies in tin Held.
He indispensably helped to win the
war. Hut there is now scarcely less
need of increasing the? production in
food and the necessaries of life. I
ask the congt ess to consider means
of encouraging effort along these
lines. The importance of doing
everything possible to promote pro

warded it to Mr. Wheelock. who is in
charge of the situation here. The
message isis follows:
"We have forwarded to you by

put into effect by -regional coal com
mittees where the pinch of necessity
has been felt today, were extended
throughout the nation under un order
of the federal fuel administrator. Ths
most extensive shut-down of Indus
try In history was in prospect and
domestic consumers were preparing
to endure privation and discomfort
as the strike ot the bituminous coal
miners entered Its second month,
Only In Kansas, where volunteers
worked the strip pits under protec
tion of state and federal troops, and
In the New River field of West Vir
ginia, was there prospect today of in
creased production. In Kansas seven
pits were worked and In West Vir
ginia operators said normal produc
tion was in sight by the end of the
week. Throughout the remainder ot
the country, however, miners appar
(ntly remalneu steadfast In their de
termination not to return to work
under the 14 per cent, wage Increase
ordered by the federal government
and acceded to by the operators, in
Wyoming new laiior troubles threat
ened to decrease the small amount of
coal being brought out. Except .for
brief shutdowns at the beginning of
the strike and twice since, the, mines
in mat state generally naa main
tained operation.
' Members ot the railroad brother
hoods In Kansas today were expected
to act on a resolution adopted last
night to request authority to refuse
to handle coal mined, by nonunion
workers.
To Essentisl Consumers,
. Under thesweeping order of Fuel
Adovinlatrutor Garfield, limttini
livery of fuel or power only to HIW1
tial consumers in the first five classes
of the war priorities list, curtail
ment of production was In prospect
in factories turning out boots and
shoes, brass and bronze manufacturers,-
clothing, machinery (except
where specifically exempted); Iron
and steel; Jewelry, marble and stone
production, musical instruments,
paper Jfoods (news, print excepted);
rubber goods,., cigars, wagons and
carriages, wood manufacturers, sheet
phdlograpnie supplies and miscel
laneous nonessentials.
7'heaterS, motion picture shows and
all other places of amusement, faced
complete shutdown. Churches and
schools also were Included in that
category, although efforts were being
made to postpone closing schools as
long as possible. .
Hukerles, except those producing
only bread, also fell under the ban,
as did confectioners and certain
packing plants.
2iW8ome of those Industries, hfrti?'
ever, an Immediate shutdown might
be forestalled If the regional coal
tommittees permitted them to operate
until their present supply ot fuel was
exhausted.
Little Actual Suffering.
Despite low temperatures that have
spread over the west for the last few
days, little actual suffering because
of the fuel shortage had been re
ported today. In Nebraska, where
near zero weather prevailed, Kilgore
had been without coal ten days.
Western Kansas, ulso without coal
several days, was to obtain an emer
gency -supply today, the first taken
from the strip pits of that state.
Suspension of nil traffic over the
St. Louis & San Francisco railroad
lines out of Oklahoma City today,
was said to be only a mntter of hours
unless coal was supplied. All railroad
traffic might be tied up at Oklahoma
City by the end of the week railroad
officials there said.
In Indiana, state officials expressed
the hope that enough coal could be
mined immediately to furnish state
institution", with fueJ;
