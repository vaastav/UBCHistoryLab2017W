Wash'iigton. Dec 4. Declaration of
wa,. w'h Austrfa-Hungary was rec
ommended to congress today by Pres
ident AVilson.
Immediate war with Turkey and
Hu'hKh. '"rcrmany's other allies, the
president told congress he did not be
1 eve necessary at this time because
they do not yet i-tand in the direct
path of necessary action.
Immed;ate war against Austria,
even tho she only be Germany's vas
sal and not her own mistress, the
president declared was necessary be
cause the central powers must be con
sidered a one and because the war
can be conducted successfully in no
other way.
Ciiving plain warning:, however, that
he would not hesitate to ask for de
claration of war on Turkey and Bul
garia when he considered it necessary,
the president said:
'Ve shall go wherever the neces
sities of this war carry us but it
seems to be that we shall go only
where -immediate and practical con
siderations lead us and not heed any
others."
Not I'ntil Militarism Is Beaten.
Peace, the president told congress,
can come only when the Prussian
military autocracy is beaten down;
with the world thru rulers the world
can trust, when they make repara
tion for the wrongs their present rul
ers have done and when the enslaved
people of Belgium, Northern France
and the Balkans have been set free.
Germany's declaration that she is
fighting a war of self-defense against
deliberate aggression, the president if'
ringing words declared "wantonly
false," and he reiterated anew that
no one is threatening the existence of
the independence of the peaceful en
terprise of Germany.
Of those who speak of peace with
out the overthrow of Germany mili
tary autocracy, the president declared:
"I hear men debate peace who un
derstand neither its nature nor the
way in which we may attain it with
uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits.
But T know that none of these speaks
for the nation. They do not touch the
heart v.t anything. They may safely
be left to Ftrut their uneasy hour and
be forgotten."
Defines Our War Aims.
Declaring anew that the United
States has no war on Germany's skill,
enterprise or commercial achieve
ments, the president declared that the
United States became Germany's ene
my only when she started out to domi
nate the world by force of arms, gat
ing again the war objects of the Uni-
.tcd States and tnose wnicn ne be
lieved to be those of the allies, the
president declared:
"I believe t"at I speak for the
when I say two things:
'First, that this intolerable thing of
which the masters of Germany have
shown us the ugly face, this menace
of combined intrigue and force which
now see so clearly as the German

Washington, Dec. 4. President Wil
son delivered to congress today an
address considered so important in its
relation to international affairs that
it has been transmitted in advance by
the government to practically every
capital in . the world.
Text of Message.
The president "P"1 gfiifnUBif' ?i
Gentlemen of the Congress:
Eifiht months have elapsed since I
last had the honor of addressing you.
They have been months crowded with
events of immense and grave signifi
cance for us. I shall not undertake to
recall or even to summarize those
events.
The practical particulars of the
part we have played in them .will be
laid before you in the reports of the
executive departments. I shall dis
cuss only our present outlook upon
those vast affairs, our present duties
and the immediate means of accom
plishing the objects we shall hold al
ways in view.
I shall not go back to debate the
causes of the war. The intolerable
wrongs donet and planned against us
by the sinister masters of Germany
have long since become too grossly
obvious and odious to every true
American to need to be rehearsed. But
I shall ask you to consider again and
with a very grave scrutiny our objec
tives and? the measures by which we
mean to attain them; for the purpose
of discussion here in this place, is ac
tion and our action must move
straight toward definite ends. Our
object is, of course, to win the war
and we shall not slacken or suffer
ourselves to be diverted until it is
won. But it is worth while asking
and answering the question, when
shall we consider the war won?
All Know Purpose of War. i
From one point 'of view it is not
necessary to broach this fundamental
matter. I do not doubt that the
American people know what the war
i.s about and what sort of an outcome
they will regard as a realization of
their purpose in it.
As a nation we are united in spirit
and intention. I pay little heed to
those who tell me otherwise. I hear
the voices of dissent who does not
I hear the criticism and the clamor of
the noisily thoughtless and trouble
some. I' also see men here and thera
fling themselves in impotent disloyalty
against the calm, indomitable pow
er of the nation. I hear men debate
peace who understand neither its na
ture nor the way in which we may at
tain it with uplifted eyes and unbrok
en spirits. But I know that none of
these speaks for the i.ation. They do
not touch the heart of anything. They
may safely be left to strut their un
easy hour and be forgotten.
But from another point of view I
believe it is necessary to say plainly
what we here at the seat of action
consider the war to be for and what
part we mean to play in the settle
ment of its searching issues. We are
the spokesmen of the American peo
ple and they have a right to know
whether their purpose is ours. They
desire peace by the overcoming of evil,
by the defeat once and for aJl of the
sinister forces that interrupt peace and
render it impossible and they wish to
know how closely our thought runs
with theirs and what action we pro
pose. They are impatient with those
who desire peace by any sort of com
promiseddeeply and indignantly im
patient, but they will be equally im
patient with us if we do not make it
plain to them what our objectives are
and what we are planning for in seek
ing to make conquest of peace by
arms.
Stamp Out German Intrigue.
I believe that I speak for them when
I say two things: First, that this in-
tolerable thing of which the masters
of Germany have shown us the ugly
race, tms menace or combined intrierue
and force which we now see so clearly
as the German power, a thing without
conscience or honor or capacity for
covenanted peace, must be crushed,
and if it be not utterly brought to an

GRANT RATE HIKE
Western H. K.'s Get Increase on
Steel and Iron Goods.
Ranges as High as 40 Per Cent
Affects K. C. Territory.
Washington, Dec. 4. Increases in
freight rates on Iron and steel articles
ranging as high as 40 per cent were
allowed to western railroads today by
the interstate commerce commission.
The increases, however, were not so
great as the railroads asked.
The railroads had asked to cancel
commodity rates and apply fifth class
rates which would have caused in
creases varying from 20 to 50 per
cent. The commission held, however,
that these were too high and allowed
a varying scale of increases ranging
up to 90 per cent of the fifth class
rate.
Former rates on iron and steel
articles were entirely too low in west
ern trunk territory, the commission
held.
The new rates which may be filed
shortly would apply principally from
Chicago, Peoria, 111., St. Louis, Kan
sas City, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Du
luth and Mississippi river crossings to
various western destinations.
Were Abnormally Low.
No increase is proposed in present
rates from Chicago to St. Louis and
other west bank Mississippi river
cities, and the commission specifies
that the new rates must not disturb
the present relationships in commodity
rates from Kansas City and St. Louis.
In explanation of the abnormally
low rate heretofore prevailing on iron
and steel products in this territory,
the commission's decision said:
"If the difference between class rate
levels in central freight association
and western trunk-line territories may
be taken as representative of trans
portation conditions generally the pro
posed rates are not relatively high."
Shippers of western territory had
protested1 quite generally against the
proposed increases.
Slilit Increase on Live Stock.
Washington, Dec. 4. Applications
for increased rates on live stock in less
than carloads east of the Mississippi
river were denied today by the inter
state commerce' commission but per
mission was given to make new mini
mum weight rulings which would re
sult in small increases.
The increases allowed amount to an
average of IS per cent and apply
mainly to shipment of breeding ani
mals. The commission also ordered
eastern railroads to cancel proposed
rates 1- roviding charges on ordinary
live stock, dependent upon value.

Fall in a Big Battle.
Extent of American Losses
. There Not Yet Announced.
FIERCEST FIGHTING OF WAR
German Charged Machine Gans
in Fifteen Waves.
One British Gunner Fired 70,
000 Rounds in a Day.
BY WILLIAM PHILIP SIMMS.
With the British Armies in the
Field, Dec. 4. Americans were again
in action around Cambrai with the
British .today.
They were members of the same
army engineering units who on Sat
urday and Sunday were caught be
tween the lines and who threw down
their tools to grab British rifles.
The American have suffered some
losses, but their detachment is proud
of the opportunity to do its bit and to
be the first American unit to suffer
in a great battle.
Battle Continues Unabated.
The battle out of Cambrai continues
with unabating ferocity today. Fight
ing like wild cats, the British have
been stemming the enemy and where
they have been forced to give way,
they have only done so in their own
good time, after repulsing all aiiacKs.
This plan held at Masniers. It has
been followed elsewhere.
The fields near Queant, around
Byng's new salient, down to vend
huile are piled with dead Germans
today. Fifteen waves deep the enemy
came to the attack. In these solid
phalanxed-like columns British artil
lery, machine guns and nries aia tear-
rexecution. - -
West of Bourlon. one British -ma
chine gunner fired 70,000 rounds on
one gun in a single day ana all at a
range of not more than 1,300 yards.
It was usually less than that.
This was only one rapid fire gun out
of many directed at the solid masses
of the enemy. But they never seemed
to make an impresion on the fifteen
waved lines. The dead dropped in
piles, but other gray coated fighters
filled the gaps.
A Lieutenant's Brave Exploit.
The exploit of a certain tank lieu
tenant is an example of the British
spirit of battle. The lieutenant's cap
tain, in charge of the tank, was killed
early yesterday morning. The subal
tern took command, a few hours
later at 10:30 in the morning his
tank was hit squarely by a German
shell. The lieutenant got his men
out of their steel, wagon and had
them entrench nearby.
Then alor.e, he clambered back into
the tank and personally worked the
Lewis guns that stuck out of its bar
bettes in front. He worked them so
rapidly that they got red hot and he
ran out of ammunition. He had to
leave the tank.
But the lieutenant was still anxious
to fight. He and his men found -a
German machine gun nearby and with
it attacked 200 Germans. They held
the enemy until British infantry pant
ed up and grabbed the enemy posi
tion. British officers who have been thru
the war mill declare today there nev
er has been any heavier fighting than
that which the "Cambrai seotor has
seen in the last few days. Attacks and
counter-attacks succeed each other
endlessly bringing the action into
one vast battle.
Today the most violent spot in the
fight was apparently around Lavac
querie. Field Marshal Hinder.burg is giving
Crown Prince Rupprecht fresh divi
sions. ,They have been pouring in
from all directions. Probably some of
them-are fnom Russia. .
The Bavarian prince is flinging
them into the struggle in the old Ger
man fighting styles masses upon
masses.
Before Americans Get In.
From prisoners' it seemed apparent
that Germany is exerting her utmost,
desperately anxious to force a decision
before the Americans arrive.
Germans, Bavarians, Prussians and
the grenadier guards the very pick of
the Teutonic forces are in the Ger
man assault.
AX.Ii KXVY THE ENGINEERS.
First to Join in Big Battle With
Boches C amp Is Aroused.
American Field Headquarters in
France, Dec. 4. Every dough boy,
every marine, every other sort of an
American fighting man now, "some
where in France," wished to heaven
today he had been an army engineer.
.The American camp, from head
quarters to the most remote village,
buzzed feverishly with news of tl:e
engineers exploits at Cambrai. Every
man envied their lot, speculated oi
the glory of getting a chance at tht
boches in the oend and wished they'd
hurry up and let the real fighting
men get into action. The engineers
can command the best the camp has
from now on they are real heroes.
News of the way American rrmy en
gineers jumped into the fray side by
side with British Tommies did not
reach the American camps, until Mon
day evening. Then special newspaper
editions deluged the countryside and
were feverishly devoured by the Sam
mies. Headquarters remained "silent on the
whole matter.
INSIST BRITISH
JOIN IN A TEST
OF NAVY POWER
Growing Sentiment in Ameri
can Jfavy for Sea Action.
Chief of. Operations Opposes
Xaral Drive by Britain.
ALL THREE NATIONS JOIN
Hnrl British, French and U. S.
Warships for Knockout.
Believe It Might Bring Quicker
Decision Than by Land.
BY CARIi O. GROAT.
Washington, Dec. 4. The British
hand is gradually being forced in the
matter of a more digressive offensive
naval policy.
Despite the opposition of Admiral
Benson, chief of operations, subtle
pressure is being exerted which, it is
believed, will eventually cause Great
Britain to depart from her defensive
program.
Prominent government officials in
formed the press tbday there is reason
to believe the growing sentiment in
the American army and navy for of
fensive measures to supplement- thel
terrinc land drives is having its ef
fect. "While the present plan of scour
ing: the seas with destroyers and
keeping the British battle fleet intact
cannot be immediately changed, the
coming year will probably see a shift
which may have a vital effect on the
allied fortunes of war.
Younger Heads for Action.
While Admiral Benson believes a
naval offensive is doomed to failure,
younger officers insist that unless
naval power is tested, the bloody see
saw on land will go on almost indefi
nitely, whereas a single blow Btruck
hyithe British, -French- and American
navies might be the knockout punch
of Germany.
What its advocates most fear is that
the British, yielding to American pres
sure, will go at the task half-heartedly.
No half way measures should
be attempted, for that would be worse
than avoiding a test.
Meantime the navy is swamped with
submarine-curbing inventions. Offi
cials declared today that gradually a
method of checking the U-boats is
being evolved and that, with this ex
pected cure, the naval offensive can
be the more safely tried.

URGE CUT IN BREAD
Bakers Council Recommends Reduc
tion Under Gov't License Dec. 10.
Washington, Dec. 4. Immediate
reduction in bread prices wherever
possible has been recommended to
bakers thruout the conntry by the war
emergency council of, the baking in
dustry. Bakers will go under govern
ment license December 10, using a set
formula and producing a standardized
loaf required by the food administra
tion. In announcing recently that the
baking industry was to be put under
license, the food administration de
clared there is no reason why bread
prices should not be sharply reduced.
The information that a reduction has
been recomtrtended came to the food
administration today in a telegram
from Henry Stude of Houston, Texas,
president of the National Association
of Bakers. The telegram was similar
to one sent by the war council to the
bakers. It reads:
"The council calls attention to the
various recomr. endations in the United
States food administration's report
suggesting a reduction in prices, with
government control of raw material
used by the baker, and a reduction in
operating expenses. There should
wherever possible be an frnmediate
reduction in price to the retailer.
SOLDIER POSTAGE FREE
BUI to That Effect Is One of First To
Be Introduced This Session.
Washington, Dec. 4. Free postage
to soldiers, sailors and marines as
signed to active duty in the United
States and its dependencies, as well
as for those on duty in foreign coun
tries in the war, was proposed in a
bill introduced today by Representa
tive Lunn of New York.
2 WOMEN CLUBS
IN BIG ROW OVER
THE GOVERNOR
Both Want Chief Executive All
to Themselves Jan. 29.
Each Invited Him To Deliver
an Address.
HE ACCEPTED INVITATIONS
Now Native Daughters and Kan.
Day Club Women Scrap.
Neither Is Willing To Share
Honor With the Other.
Topeka club women have not pre
cipitated a new row in a. week. Now
they are cooking a new one. It con
cerns and interests prominent wom
en's club leaders in all sections of
Kansas. And the row concerns the
right, title and Interest of the women
to one or more speeches by Governor
Capper Kansas Day January 29.
Since the club women and inci
dentally a few church organizations
went to the mat concerning the vile,
evil and deadly cigarette, a turbulent
calm existed on the surface. But
away down at the grass roots the
leaders were hatching a new source of
trouble to be added to an extensive
repertoire of troubles. There isn't
a bit of foolishness about this new
row, either. The new trouble is devoid
of camouflage, barrage and smoke
screen maneuvers. It is an out in the
open, hand to hand eombat with the
state's own beloved and native born
governor as the unwilling victim re
gardless of ultimate results.
How Row Started.
It all happened this way. Two
separate, distinct and more or less
antagonistic female organizations
asked " Governor Capper to- make
speeches ' Kansas Day. He accepted
both invitations, just as any perfectly
obliging, unselfish and ambitious
governor might. Now both female
organizations are determined the gov
ernor shall make just one speech.
They are determined that speech shall
be before their clu&. And if the gov
ernor makes just one speech, he is
certain to guess wrong so far as one
side of the row is concerned. If he
makes two speeches, he must exercise
wonderous tact and diplomacy In
breaking up at least one prolonged
luncheon party. And two speeches
may not prove better than one.
You see it was like this.
The Women's Kansas Day club is
an old established and very formidable
and dignified organization. Each
Kansas Day it holds an afternoon ses
sion. Many nativo daughters come to
the meeting from all sections of the
state. Until this .year the club has
flatly, firmly and sometimes rather
abruptly refused to permit a mere
man to talk at one of the meetings.
This year the women decided to honor
Governor Capper, the state's first na
tive son governor. So he was invited
to speak.
While the Women's Kansas Dav
club was busy with these plans, the
Jative Daughters of Kansas were in
executive session. Their membership
is composed of Kansas born women.
Being the native daughters of Kansas,
members of the club decided they
should in right, justice and proper
spirit l.old their meeting Kansas Dav.
They also decided they should honor
tne governor with an invitation.
Governor Equal to Task.
So the Native Daughters invited the
governor to epeaic. He accepted. The
Women's Kansas Day club also in
vited the governor. Having made as
many as fifteen speeches a day in a
campaign, the governor didn't regard
the second invitation as an unusual
test. So he accepted the second in
vitation also.
. That night members of Native
Daughters told their friends. The
women of the Kansas Day club told
their friends. The two sets of friends
compared notes. The next day the
Native Daughters "froze" the women
of the Kansas Day club. And the
women of the Kansas Day club came
right back "freezing" the Native
Daughters.
Of course the governor didn't mean
any narm. Alter all, a governor is
only human. And when a governor
desires to graduate from the gover
nor's chair to thi. United States sen
s' te. he would rather speak twice than
once. Somehow, tho, the club women
couldn't get the right view of the
matter.
Now both sides are making strategic
retreats an d -ances.
, Mrs. DeWitte C. Nellis, command
ing the forces of the Native Daughters
is driving toward the first trenches
of the women's Kansas Day club in
massed formation They assert they
inwited the governor first. It's their
meeting, anyhow. And some other
things. - .
Have Endurance Contest.
With Mrs. A. Marburg commanding
the ranks of the trained and carefully
organized women's Kansas Day club,
the club has sent word it is ready for
battle. In fact Mrs. Marburg has led
a flanking movement that seems to
have cut off the Nellis forces. Under
Mrs. Marburg's command, the women's
Kansas Day club has increased its
talent. The plan, as outlined by first
trench observers, indicates an endur
ance speaking and eating contest
with the club's members and guests
doing both the eating and speaking.
If the flanking movement is a suc
cess, the women's Kansas Day club
will begin Its operations about an hour

SWEDEN DENIES IT
Legation Did Not Offer To Mediate
Between BolHUevikl and Germany.
Stockholm, Dec. 4. The Swedish
foreign office authorizes the Associat
ed Press to deny the report published
in Paris and elsewhere to the effect
that the Swedish legation in Petro
grad offered or is about to offer Its
services as intermediary between the
Bolsheviki government and Germany.
The Swedish minister to Russia, it Is
explained, joined with other neutral
diplomatic representatives in ac
knowledging the receipt of M. Trotz
ky's note regarding an armistice and,
peace negotiations, but this was mere
ly an act of courtesy and no wise in-
vplved recognition of the Ieninites.
The foreign office refuses to discuss
the academic question whether Swe
den is likely to recognize the Bolshe
viki , at some future time. It is
learned in well informed circles, how
ever, that there is no likelihood of
such recognition unless the entente
powers should take the lead.
