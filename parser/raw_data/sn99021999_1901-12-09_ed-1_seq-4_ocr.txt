The highest salaried woman employe In
any government department In Washington
Is Miss Lillian A. Norton of Massachusetts.
She has Just bee i appointed superintendent
of pobtal finance In the Postolllcc dopnrt
ment In place of n man, Albert W. Bing
ham, who died a short time ago, after
holding, tho post for more than thirty years.
It Isn't n wonderfully high-salaried post
after all, though, compared with some of
those held by men. It pays $2,250 n year,
but that U excellent pay In Washington for
a woman, and Miss Norton U envied,
naturally, by her sUler employes of Uncle
Sam. Sho has been In the government
service for fifteen years, beginning s a
stenographer lu the dead letter otllco, At
Mr. Bingham's death Bhe was the chief
.clerk tif the nuance division and she suc
ceeded to this post simply becauso sho knew
moro about tht work of tho division than
any person In It,
Sho has accepted her elevation In a
modem, sensible way. Speaking to a re
porter about It sho said:
"Of courso 1 am very much pleased. 1
feel that It is a great compliment that
General Madden has paid me, I am the
highest-salaried woman lu tho employ of
the executive departments here and that la
a distinction to bo proud of. There may bo
assistant postmasters of my sex who re
celve a salary as high or higher, but no
other woman In the government depart
ments can rival me."
There lr a possibility, however, that Miss
Norton's Incumbency may be only tcmpq
rary. So good a post Is greatly In demand
and a man had been chosen to fill the post,
For so.uo reason his appolntmont at this
time wus not deemed advisable, but It may
be made early In the new year.
Miss Norton's father Is postofllce In
spector In Texas and her appointment l
charged to that state, though she comes
from Maitachusetts,

The Art or Cnttlnc nml 1'iillslilnK
lllubly lln eloi-il.
Long centuries before the wewtem world
had nwnkened nt the trumpet call of civili
zation when tho ancient empires of Greece
and Rome were yet unknown, when the
stones that form the pyrumlds were still
embedded In the granite hills of Kgypt. the
deft fingers nf Indian workmen were hew
Ing with marvelous skill and dexterity
massive blocks of eastern grnnlle. Hero In
tho crr.dle of the human race, says tho
Stono Trades Journal, the arts of granite
cutting and polishing first were mastered,
and even yet human Ingenuity has Improved
but little the handiwork of those ancient
craftsmen. So wonderful was their skill
that many centuries afterward, when the
older civilizations had passed away, not
only tho native tribesmen, but visitors from
foreign lands, regarded those granite tern
pies and statues as the handiwork of tho
god. In tho early years of the Christian
era Fa Hlnn. a Christian pilgrim, visited
India. "In tho city," he says, "Is the royal
palnre, the different parts of which Asoka
commissioned, the genii to construct by
piling up the- stones. The walls, doorways
and the sculptured designs arc no human
work." Another Christian pllgrm of tha
same perlodHouen Ts.-hng describes, not
without n touch of awe, the sculptured
stones of the Innd. and nlso what can only
"have been a pillar of polished granite. He
saw. he says, "a stone pillar, bright and
shining as a mirror, its surface glistening
nnd smooth as Ice."
Oldest of all these ancient buildings are
fortresses and pagodas. The earlier pago
das, however, were not the "stone-built
towers and mansions with a thousand pll
lart." mentioned In the Rig Veda, but un
derground temples hewn from 'the solid
rock under the shadow of some lofty east
ern mountains. To this period (and per
haps most ancient of all) belongs the
famous pngoda In tho Island of Klephante,
near Bombay. Halfway toward the moun
tain top a spacious hall. 120 feet square, Is
hewn out of tho heart of the mountain.
Massive pillars, finely carved, are left here
and there at regular Intervals for the pur
pose of supporting tho roof and the weight
of the great hill abovo It the whole form
ing a striking plcturo of rugged strength
and beauty. Coeval with those underground
temples arc tho famous fortresses of Dow
letabad and AtseorRur, two gigantic gran
ite strongholds situated so advantageously
that even In these latter days It would be
no mean feat of arms to capture them by
force. Dr. Kennedy, who has given n life
time study to these matters, says the only
tools the Hindoo artisan used In those gi
gantic undertakings were a small chisel
and an iron mallet. The chisel tapered to
a fine round point and the face of ho mallet
had n deep hollow, lined with lead. "With
such simple tools," he adds, "they formed,
fashioned and scooped the gpnhlte rock
which forms tho tremendous fortress of
Dowlatnbad nnd excavated the wonderful
caverns of Elorn, for it seems by no means
probable that the Hindoo etnne nittrra I
u'nrljiH will, ftnv nflin. Innla I

Granite, agates, bloodstones and crystnls
wore fashioned with such primitive instru
ments Into cups and other hollow articles
ns delicately shaped as those of tho most
plastic porcelain. King Solomon, it will be
remembered, received from the enst n ruby
cup containing the "elixir of life." So at
least runs tho legend. In forming tho cav
ity of the cup small holes? n quarter of an
Inch In depth, were first bored all over tho
surface with a diamond-tipped drill. Tho
remaining portions around tho holes wero
then chjpped nway and the process repeated
time nfter time, until Uio desired form and
depth wero obtained. Infinite labor be
stowed on every detail characterized all the
products of ancient Indian art. With the
fall of the ancient Hindoo kingdoms the
art and craft of masonry died gracefully
away. Whether It will again bo resusci
tated one hesitates to say, yet none the less,
In centuries yet tn come, the architects and
artisans of tho west will turn with wonder
und delight to view those enduring monu
ments of human Industry reared long ageB
ago by the builders and sculptors of the pa
tient east.

An organized fight for better sen Ice an J
more reasonable rates Is on In Chicago
against the telephone company, which en
Joys a monopoly. According to lofat ac
counts the concern Is at present operated
on the principle of taking all the traffic
will bear nnd giving an Indifferent equiva
lent. A few yenrs back the service was
satisfactory, the rates reasonable, nnd the
holders of telephone stock raked In as high
as 10 per rent In dividends. But they were
not satisfied with their profits. They
hankered for Standard Oil "melons." To
get them a reorganization was effected, a
new manager Installed and ordered to push
dividends soveral notches higher. The
Chicago Tribune says Ihe new manager
showed wonderful genius In curtailing
privileges enjoyed nnd "soaking'' telephone
patrons to the limit The result of (ho per
sistent sweating process Is n suit Instituted
by thirty business firms asking the courts
to restrain the Chicago Telephone company
from all Interference with tho telephones
of subscribers who offer to pay the fran
chise rate of $12." a year Instead of the
$175 charged by the company for business
telephones, This suit Is a movement of
the Illinois Manufacturers' association
against the telephone company's alleged
excessive rates.
It Is alleged-ln the bill that the exaction
of a greater sura than $125 a year from
the subscribers Is against public policy and
In violation of the terms and conditions
tinder which the company obtnfned tho
right to construct and maintain Us tele
phone system.
Concerning the business of the telephone
company, the bill recites:
"That nt the timo of Its organization in
1S8I, Ihe capital stock of the tolephone com
pany was $500,000; that from tlrao to time
nald capital stock was Increased to $5,000.
000, and again, on or about January 17,
1S00, was further Increased to $15,000,000;
that the total capital stock of the telephone
company now issued and outstanding Is, as
your orators are informed nnd believe, and
stato the fact to he, $l).000,000, divided Into
0,000 shares of tho par value of $100 each
the market value of which slock In now
$275 per share, or au aggregate nf $24,750,
000; that the business of the telephone com
pany has been Htid Is now a large and grow
ing ono; that In 1830 the telephone company
employed In Us service 7.70G telephones
and 15,430 miles of wire; that In 1900 the
telephone company employed In Its service
30,414 telephones and 110,605 miles of wlrvN
that nt the time of filing this, your orator's
bill, the telephone company owns ami has
in service over 45,000 telephones; that In
1P00 the gross earnings of the telephone
company were $3,129,328.18 nnd Its net
earnings $870,157.01."
Klretrletty ami 1'opuliitlou.
It Is noticeable to those who study the
statlsttis of the census, says the Electrical
Review, that the rate of increase of our
larger cities is becoming Icni, and, while
the latlo' of urban population is larger
than It ever was before In the history of
the country, yet If one puts aside the fale
data due to the enlargement nf city bound
aries and. the absorption of suburban dis
tricts within municipal limits. It Is very
noticeable that the rate of increase of pop
ulation In the denser centers has become
less.
The reason for-this Is found In the gen
eral extension oi two applications of 'elec
tricity, while a third has played no Incon
siderablo pari. The trolley car has been
perhaps tho largest agent In the redis
tribution of population, making it possible
for the people who work In the crowded
districts of cities to live at considerable
distances away nnd enjoy the very great
advantages of suburban life. This Is par
ticularly noticeable In cities of the Inter
mediate size. Twenty years ago cities of the
second class were much condensed In nren,
for the reason that practically every one
walked to and from his place yf work, and
for this reason tW residence areas ciowded
upon th business districts as closely as
possible. The horse car of those days was
at best a poor thing, and It was not until
the coming of the swifter trolley that It was
possible for the ordinary man of hualncss
or laborer to live more than half a mile,
or such a matter, from tho scene of his
dally task. Today all this Is changed. nnd
as a consequenco the residence district In
all such cities has vastly extended, and
pooplo not uncommonly live anywhere from
ten to twenty miles nway from their places
of business".
To double the radius of a city means to
Increase Us area four times. The trolley,
by its duplication and triplication of the
city radius, has epabled very laree terri
tories to ba Included lu th suburban dis
tricts of towns, with the result that houses
havo plenty of room around them, tho
people aro no longer compelled to live close
together, and to this degreo a very Im
portant social revolution has been wrought.
and, Indeed, Is still in process of extension.
No one can deny the benefits of a freer
life and the Immonse social, sanitary nnd
other advantages which have followed the
Introduction of the trolley ear. and tha
consequent extension of residence neighbor
hoods.
But another agency has .not been Idle.
Tho principal objection to country life has
been Its loneliness and tho absence of those
conveniences which differentiate the city
houso from tho country residence. The
loneliness, by which Is meant the lack of
Intercourse with neighbors, has been In a.
great degreo removed by tho telephone,
perhaps the best work that the Inde
pendent telephone movement has accom
plished has been the popularization nf the
telephone and Its introduction at low rates
Into sparsely settled neighborhoods, thus
removing the bugbear of isolation which
has been so long a complaint of tho rural
resident. But the telephone has done more
for those living In the country and In Ihe
country districts surrounding cities than to
furnish them a meamj for social conven
tion. It has proved Itself a very practical
and valuable addition to tho farmer's
means for making a living. By putting
him in Immediate touch with his markets,
whether for selling or for buying, It en
ables him to conduct his business in a
much more huslnessllko way than formerly,
when the Isolated gardener or truckman
loaded his vehicle In the early hours of
tho morning and drove to town without the
lightest Idea what he would rerelvo for It
or whether he could sell It at all.
With the telephone nullifying the isola
tion of the country districts and the trolley
car providing quick and inexpensive means
of transit, the suburbs have become. In a
sense, part of the town. It Is no longer a
caso of ru In nrbe. but rather the reverse,
for the lown has gone Into tho country and
carried with It thoie to Important agen.
cles, while not far behind rom's the eiec
trie llRht. making at once more pleasant
and more safe the highways w lanes of
the country districts
Whllr Isolation was annoying under th
older r'Klme It sln had ll dangers on ar
count of the exposure of valuable property
In suburban dlstrkis :o the attacks of those
who plow I by night. Everybody know s that
one arc light Is as good ns two policemen
nnd thus the extension of electric light in
tho suburban districts has mndo them better
places of resldcnco In twollstinct ways.
It Is unnecessary to seek further the ten
sons for the decentralization of population
or the extension territorially of cities or the
Increasing army of people who have left the
town for tho country so fnr as their places
of abodd are concerned. And yet It Is con
cehable that we have seen only the begin
ning of the changes which Inevitably will
follow tho extension of electrical utilities
and we may even look forward to th" pra.
tlcal disappearance of cities as places of
residence In tho future and tho redistribu
tion of population In a more satisfactory
sanitary and altogether desirable waj
through the effect of the electrical ngctuie
referred to above.

The cable dispatches to the New York Sun
announcing the success of tho cxperlmonts
on the military railroad In Germany are of
Interest to all whose comfort has been
enhanced by electrical traction. During tho
experiments tho rale of speed has been
gradually increased until early this month
the cars were running at eighty-five miles
an hour. The engineers arc confident th.it
they will attain a speed of 125 tulles tin
hour.
Both popular and scientific attention In
Germany hao been closely ccnterod In the
preparation for tho present experiments.
The preparations were practically com
pleted early In September nnd the trials
have been In progress more than a month.
The great slgnlllcance of these experi
ments Is obvious. If an electric motor car,
taking its current from overhead wires and
running upon an ordinary standard gauge
railroad track, cati carry with snfety fifty
or sixty passengers nt a speed of 125 miles
an hour It is evident that the next few
yenrs will see the means nf travel between
many cities nd districts practically rcvo
lullonlzed. Of course many problems are Involved.
Rxpcrts have realized that a speed of even
eighty miles an hour with a single car In
voles questions of nlr resistance, weight,
form and balance of vehicle, electrical
transmission at high voltage with easy con
version to lower potentiality and other
equally important points which have not
yet been settled In actual practice. Th
study of all these questions Is InvnHed
In the experiments on the German road.
Tho track, 1I.2H miles In length, extends
from Marlenfeble. a suburb of Berlin, to
Zossen. It Is of standard 'gauge, level nnd
nearly straight, theie being but one curve
with a radius of 1.100 yards. Track, ties
nnd ballasting were put Into the best possl.
ble condition beforo tltc experiments began.
Tho conductors are ordinary copper wires,
nbout three-eighths of an Inch In thickness,
so hung that the trolley can make full con
tact from beneath.
We are likely to hear any day that higher
speed has been attained. The program pro
vides that, if the experiments Justify tho
undertaking, a speed of from 125 to 135
miles an hour shall bo attempted. The aim
was, therefore, to make the electrical ap
paratus sufllclnntly strong nnd heavy to
achieve an extreme speed of 150 miles an
hour without danger of overheating. Tho
passenger cars were built with a special
view to very high speed. Each of the
four car's carries four motors, which aro
attached to tho front and rear uxles of
each track, the middle pnlr of wheels run
ning free. The ends of the cars are pointed
to minimize wind resistance. The wheels
are provided with the most Improved pneu
matic brakes. The cars are, therefore,
quite different from any others In use.

monument to Amerlcnn valor.
On tho morning of April IS, 1S6. Captain
W. A. Fuller left Atlanta In chnrse of the
psfeenuer train on the Western .t
Atlanta railroad. When he reacheil
Marietta n party of strntiijers,
dressed in citizens clothes. boarded
the train nml pair their fores In
different points. Tney claimed to be refu
gees from the Yankee lines Joining the
confederate army, but were disguised ho'
dlers. volunteers from Sill's brlKnde, Mitch
ell's corps, r. ri. A., commanded by Captain
Jumen J. Andrews.
At UIk Shanty the trtlu stopped for
breakfast and most of the passengers anil
train crew lift the train. The passenger
had tnkMi their seats nt the table, Captain
Kulier facing tlie train. He saw through
the window some strangers get on the en
gine in au excited manner and start off
rapidly He remarked to ills engineer. Jeff
Cain, and Aiithony Murphy, then foreman
of tho Western & Atlanta shops, "that
some ono who has no right to do so has
pone oft with our train." All three arose
and hurried out of tti house Just aa tho
englno passed Jilt of sight.
Captain Fuller, Murphy and Cain com
menced pursuit on foot. They soon secured
a hnndenr. nnd. in spite of the obstructions
placet! on the track by the raiders, made
rapid progress. At Etowah they found the
engine "Vonnli." and the pursuit then wns
at such a rapid pace that serious damage
to the railroad by the raiders was Impossi
ble. The "(iencral" was nbandoned by the
raiders at a point nbout half way between
Itlnggold and Graysvlllo, on account of l.ick
of fuel nnd the close pursuit of Fuller nnd
his party. When tlie fugitives abandoned
the engine their leader suld. "Kvi'rv 'inn
take care of himself." and they left in
squuds. Four of them were run down In
the fork of the Chlckamaiiga river at
(Jraysvllle, and one was forcibly persuaded
to tell who they were. Uiter there was a
trial by military court, and right nt tlie
number were executed in Atlanta as splfn,
six wre exchanged and eight escaped from
T.lhln nrlsnn.
The objectn of the raid wiik to burn Ihe
