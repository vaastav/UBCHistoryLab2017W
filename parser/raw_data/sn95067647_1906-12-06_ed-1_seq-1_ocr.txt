No Congress in our timo has done
more good work of importance than
' th.e ?present Congress. There were

i most earnestly bone yon' will com

one house of Congress. . bet individ?

let us prohibit in effective fashion all
corporationa from making contribu?
tions for any political purpose, di?
rectly or indirectly.
Another bill v.Jiich has past one
house of the Co?jrraa?' which it is
urgently aeoanary should be enacted
into t?w is that .coaferrlng ttpon the
Government I lie right of appeal in
criminal .?ase? on questions of law.
The \r?resid.ent ?says i.bat the wheels

On the* subject ol injunctions Mr.

?the offense; while the trial should be
onducte'd that the victim need not

timony,' and that the least possible

tails.
Next, President Roosevelt discusses
! capital and labor. On this subject
i he wrltres:
In .dealing with boiii labor and
?capital' with the questions affecting
: both corporations and frades unions,
there is one matter more important
to remember -than auaht else, and
that Is the infinite arm done by
preachers of mere discontent. These
are men who seek to excite a violent
class hatred ' agalnsi all men of
wealth. They, seek toxurn wise and
proper movements for the better con?
trol of ~colorations and for doing
away with the.abases connected with
wealth, in-fco %' campaigu of hysteri?
cal excitement and falsehood in which
thi\aim is to inflame to madness the
brutal passion^, of mankind. The sin

as the purveyor? of sensational slan?
der in newspapers or magazine arc
the worst' enemies of all men who
are engaged-* ir? an honest effort te

To preach haired of the rich man
as such, to cairy on a campaign oi

to seek to mislead and inflame tc

aparatara wid minera, to inquire into,
consider, and pass upon the questions
in controversy in connection with the
strike in the anthracite regions of
Peaaeylraata and la the caaees out of
which the controversy arose,"in their
report, findings, and award exprest
th^ belief "that the State and Feder?
al governments should provide the
machinery for what may be called
the compulsory investigation of con?
troversies between employers and
employes when they arise."
This expression of belief is deserv?
ing of the favorable consideration
of the Coagreea and the enactment
of its provisions into law. A bill
baa already been introduced to this
end.
The message, after stating that all
remaining coal lands have been with?
drawn from sale urges that their
ownership and control remain with
the Government.
The present Congress, observes the
President, has taken long strides in
tin? direction of securing proper su?
pervision and control of. the National
Government over corporations en?
gaged in interstate business?^and
the enormous majority of corpora?
tions of any size are engaged in Inter?
state business. The passage of the
railway rate bill, and only to a less
degree the passage of the pure food
bill, and the provision for increasing
and rendering more effective nation?
al control over the beef-packing in?
dustry, mark an important advance
in the proper direction. In the short
session it will perhaps bo difficult to
do much further along this line; and
it may be best to; wait until the laws
have been in operation for a number
of months before endeavoring to in?
crease their scope.
On the subject of agriculture the
message says, in part :
The only other.persons whose wel?
fare is as vital to the welfare of the
whole country as is the welfare of
the wageworkers are the tillers of the
soil, the farmers. There must be open
to farmers the chance for technical
and scientific training, not theoreti?
cal merely but of the most severely
practical typ?. Organization has be?
come necessary in the business
world; and It has accomplished much
for good in the world of labor. It
la no less necessary for farmers. Such
I movement as the prange movement
^ good in itself and is capable of a
well-nigh infinite further extension
for good so long as it is keut to its
own l?gitim?t-? business. The bene?
fits to be derived by the association
Of farmers for mutual advantage arc
partly economic and partly sociolog?
ical.
The President states that in his
judgment, the*whole question of mar?
riage and divorce should be relegated
to the authority of the National Con
greea. At present the wide difference
ij tftjgflaws of the different States on
this'-SH?ject. result in scandals and
abuses; and surely there is nothing
so vitally essential to the welfare, of
the nation, nothing around which the
nation should so bend itself to throw
every safeguard, as the home life of
the average citizen. The chant.
would be good from every standpoint.
In particular it would be good be?
cause it would confer on the Congress
the power at one.? to deal radically
and efficiently with polygamy; and.
this should lie done whether or ?or
marriage and divorce are dealt with.
