Dascrlptlan—'The Words ef Ilia
Bvlnir Man- Nlorj of the Crime—
Other Executions al Elklou.
Through the dispatches of our special
correspondent yesterday, our readers
have been informed of the hanging of
the colored man, Medford Waters, at
Elkton ; but in order that general in
quiry may be satiefied we give the fol
lowing; interesting letter, wherein he
recites more fully the incidents of the
hanging, a story of the crime, and a
history of previous executions ;
Elkton, Mo., Dec. 5.
It has been nigh unto 30 years since
the execution of the man Swift. With
in thuse decades the moral state of the
community has not improved one whit.
The generation that whooped and
howled then in the exuberance of their
youthful spirits are to-day stepping
the streets of the town with a sover
eign feeling of masculinity, some pa
tronizing bars arid booths, others wan
dering around listlessly, but all actua
ted with one uxauimmis deeire : to wit
ness the execution of another fellow be
ing. The generation of which they are
the prototypes, iu its youthful mind
less fortunate, is imprisoned in school
houses aud its desire to witness the
eventful scene which takes place to-day
on a neighboring bill outside the town,
is at war witli juvenile duty prescribed
by pedagogical rules and regulations.
Elkton quiet and sedate by nature, is
not Elkton when unnaturally excited.
Like a full Hedged bantam-cock it is
swelled and puffed, big with its own
importance. Hangings don't come every
day, and such luxuries must be en
joyed to their fullest extent.
It the victim is a negro it doesn't
matter; he is giveu just as heavenly a
boast as though he were white; hut gen
erally that doesn't affect the business
in band; tbe people iu Elkton are not a
community to grumble, and such tri
vial matters as color don't lay heavy
on their understandings.
This morning when Medford Watters
awoke and heard the confusion of voi
ces there may have been a feeltng of
pride in his bosom. For him was all this
confusion and it was for his sake that
the country had turned from towns and
hamlets just for the sole purpose of
giving him a respectable fuueral. He
may have had such thoughts we say,
it would have been reflecting upon the
proverbial good beartedness of the
Cecil people had he not. But he didn't
show it. lie wasn't that kind of a
man. "A hardened creature!" says one
Puritanic individual. "Aye verily,"
piped} another. Hardened! Hardened
just because ho hadn't a gumelastio
conscience, because lie wouldn't be
dosed by this and that kind of theolo
gical physic; because he wanted a pure
aud simple answer to a pure and sim
ple creed; and had hisown ideas about
how he was to glide from a trap door
Into eternity.
However he sat ou the edge of his
cot with his elbow on bis knee, aud his
broad black palm balancing hts heavy
aohiug head, and thus he pondered
upon his situation. Not wanting dig
nified deacons, he instead took a citi
zen, one l'erkins, a big brawny Esto
nian, and through him received spirit
ual advice and consolation. He ate
his breakfast. lie received several
minist-rs of iiis own color, and witli
them held religious services. The news
paper men iu the corridor outside, and
the prisoners iu the calls adjoiningwere
the sole audience.
At a few minutes of tan o'clock the
turnkey significantly whispered 'time's
up." The prisoner heard the whisper
aud stared vacantly at the intruder.
A minute after the Sheriff entered with
a bundle. It contained new clothes,
from undershirt to overcoat, purchased
by the county. " Here's a new suit,"
says the Sheriff. The turnkeys crowded
around but no emotion of thankfulness
crossing the dark countenance of the
victim, they drew back with a sigh, and
the prisoner passed silently out into
the corridor.
Going from one cell to another he
bade every prisoner good-bye anil be
fore leaving them made each promise to
meet him in heaven. "Gad bless you
says, one." "Hope to see you among
the angels," says another. "Make a
full confession," advises a third. Only
one was silent aud that one was a wo
man. Crouched iu the corner at her ceil
door, with her face buried iu her hand,
she was the picture of despair. She
was colored. Her attenuated frame
shook with emotion, while big tears
trickled through her fingers and fell
upon tatters that had not been wet for
many a long day. "Dear Aunie, lie
good," sayB he, "me an my God hah
got it fixed. 1 tells you I'm happy.—
I'se no moah leali dan if I wuz agoin
home. My home's in Heben, hope to
see yer dab; will yer cum. Say dat
yer'U meet me in Heaven Annie!" A
in
of
murmered "l will" came from the
quivering figure. The Sheriff touched
the victim on the shoulder. One fond
lingering look at the weeping girl and
then the prisoner turned his hack up
on her for the last time.
As he was going out,the Sheriff hand
ed him a cigar. He took the weed, and
biting the end, put the cigar in his
mouth and lighted it by a burning
match held by the Sheriff. As he step
ped on the steps iu front of the jail in
full view of the populace, he waved his
hat. A thrill of admiration rau through
the impatient crowd. He was grateful
thou. Probably it was the sight o' the
militia drawn up to receive him that
opened the floodgates of his emotional
nature. It may have been this or it
may have been the l«ng rows of smil
iug faces ; but however it is immater
ial which ; the prisoner smiled, and it
, was sufficient to the people of Cecil to
know lhat tUeir efforts had been appre
dated.
At a few minutes after ten o'clock
the procees.on started, the low heavy
atmosphere being torn by the monoto
nous and doleful beat of the company's
drum. The cortege zig-zagged itself
over the old plank road in the direction
of Cherry Hill. As the prisoner's eye
glanced at the long line of oarriages iu
the prooession, the end of whioh was
laboriously emerging from tbe edg. of a
copse a mile distant, ho oould not but
note the fact of there being too
much levity for a funeral and hard
ly enough for a parade. The un
unappropriate jests aud jeers from the
tribe of rag tag which pottered perslat
entljaiii the rear dietar^d whatever
retlection the victim may have been in
dulging in.
A tew minutes after eleven o'clock,
the ground was reached. The scaffold
stood in a corn field. It there was any
virtue in dismal surroundings the spot
had been well selected. The scaffold
was in charge of a guard of soldiers,
who were pacing to and fro aloag the
front,the sides and the rear of it. A rope
attached to stakes kept hack the swell
ing crowds. Evidently the curions
people had been gathered since early
morning. Vehicles of every description
were backed up against fences or stand
ing diseriminately—confusedly arouud
the fields, while the horses securely
tethered, impatiently pawed among the
dry leaves in adjoining thickets.Strange
to say in several places were seated
parties engaged in taking their dinner.
Everything bore more the appearance
of a fair than an eaecu ion.
The prisoner seemed to take no notice
of the preparations that L ad been made.
He was taken from tbo wagon, his
feet untied and led between a cordon
ot soldiery to the steps of the soatfold,
up which he walked with a firm tread,
followed by his religions advisers. After
appropriate services the Sheriff began
to prepare for the final act, Up to this
time the prisonei had preserved a sto
ical indifference. Only once did he be
tray emotion. That was when be
stepped forth to apeak to the crowd.
Ills face lighted up and his whole fig
ure became lithe and actually expres
sive. la the dispatches yesterday we
gave the gist of his remarks. In full
they are:

dark night a man was found murdered

with this unpleasant combination of
deviltry,faithlesness and crime,coursing
through his veins, Medford progressed
toward manhood.

sticking heavenward. And the youth
who witnessed the deed from a distance
was made richer by several pennies
which Watters paid as the price of his
silence. So he went on growing nearer
A SKETCH OF THE VICTIM.
Medford Watters, the deceased crimi
nal,it seems had a very bad reputation.
Of that we say nothing at present. But
one dark aud blustery St. I'atrick's day
some seventeen years ago spread its
gloom over the farm of William Wil
uier near the village of Chestertown is
the county of Kent. Under the chill
auspices of that day was born Medford
Watters the offspring of Mary aud Clin
ton Watters. The disturbing elements
which graced his natal day seem to
have followed him through life, lor
shortly after his birth his parents
separated and the mother started out
to battle with life, burdened down with
Medford and an infant daughter.
The father relieved her of any aux
iety concerning the daughters future
life, by stealing her before she readied
her fourth year. The woman retired
to Sassafras neck as a servant,still care
ing for her youthful son. He remained
with her until he reached his twelfth
year when he was apprenticed to farm
ing and like a du'iful .son repaid his
mother for her care by giving her all
the profits arising from his industry.
Small they must have been, but such
as they were he cheerfully rendered
them to her.

and nearer to that ideal of
"born to be hanged."
He grew reckless, and his reputation
made men charry of correcting
him until he fell under the disci
yriineoftman connected with John
Lockwood ae foreman. To biin this
young man, flushed with a lODg
course of uninterrupted mischief, came.
At the first transgression Mr. Lockwood
proceeded to chastise Watters which he
did most effectually. The spirit of the
youogmau was broken and he henoe
forth confined himself to rows among
his own people, which were many and
His mother eudeavered to
persuade him to reform, and with bowed
head lie listened to her words and
promised better things; aud then with
a lie deep in his heart, went into the
cornfield, quarrelled with his victim
aud murdered him.
HIS ESCAPE, CAPTURE AN0 TRIAL.
After killing Whaley he left and go

ed by several citizens of Sassafras Neck,
who, one day, overtook him. He recog
nized them aud lied. As he was fleeing
the pursuers fired two shots at him
which took - fleet. He escaped however
but was subsequently captured in the
barn of his employer and taken in
charge of soon after by Sheriff Boulden.
His trial began on Monday, January
6th. On Wednesday the jury retired
and returned on Friday with a request
to he discharged standing one for
quittal and eleven for conviction. On
January Kith the case again came up
and Watters was convicted and sen

PREVIOUS EXECUTIONS
It has frequently been asserted tliaf
no person,except Robert Swift,who wa.s
hung ou Red Hill, in April, 1855,
ever executed in Cecil county. But
there is reason to think that several
others have been executed. From in
formation furnished us by H. R. Tor
bert, of Elkton, we learn that on June
9 th, 1724, John Hack, who was then
Sheriff, presented a petition to the
Court, stating that a certain Robert
Dutch, then in hi3 custody, was sen
tenced to be hanged ou the 19th of that
month and being fearful he might es
cape through the insufficiency of the
jail, he besought the court to order
guard to watch the prisoner and also
to summon the constables of the vari
ous districts to be present aud assist
at his execution. The petition was
granted aud no doubt the man was
hanged.
At this period the couuty seat was at
Court House Point, and there is no
doubt that at least two other criminals
were executed there. One of them is
said to have been drawn and quartered,
and part of his body exposed ou each
side of the river. He was a slave and
had murdered his master, one Mr. Saw
in, who lived in Elk Neck, opposite
Court House Point. The other one was
executed for the murder of Hugh Ma
haffey, which occurred on the 18th of
November, 1749. Mahaffey lived on

restored to full turf privilege. She had
been suspended by the Galen Driving
Park Association for a non-payment of
entrance on the part of her owner. This
fee Mr. Morrison refused to pay simply
because its payment was conditional
upon his mare winning the race, and
the race was disputed. The Board of

man
1 lie Harris Ejectment Case on the
Drag—Counsel Mill Arguing Ibe
Case.
Specially Deported lor the Befu
Niw Castle, Dec. 5.
Mr. Cummins in continuing his argu
ment said that they were not trying
the case on supposition; the arguments
of learned Counsel are not proof in the
case but mentioned merely to draw the
minds of the jury to some important
fasts which are proofs in the case and
it is for the jury to decide whether the
the facts have been proven.
At 1.40 p. m. Mr. Cummins conclud
ed his argument and the Court took a
recess until three o'clock.
A FTERNOOS SESSION.
Court re-assembled at 3 o'clock.
Mr. Spruance for the plaintiff in the
Harris ejeotment case than began his
argument, ou addressing the Jury he
said we may all congratulate ourselves
that we can see the end of this case. It
has been a long and tedious trial and
we are exceedingly gratified to you for
your attention as it is a very unpleas
ant thing to summon men from their
business aud place them in a small
box. Mr. Spruance said that it was
his duty to perform the last act iu this
drama so far as it concerns party or
parties and when he was done he said
it would be for the Jury to consider
what is right in all that you have
heard. The speaker said that he did
not want anything hut tbe right and if
they were entitled to the land he urged
the Jury then to so render the verdict.
Mr. Spruance said that the counsel for
defense had said "that you must estab
lish a verdict beyond a doubt." He
contended that there was no such
principle in this case. This is not a
criminal case, hut a civil case, and
you give that verdict to the party
which has as a whole the preponder
ance of truth, you balance the testi
mony on either side against the scale
and the side that tips the beam you
give your verdict in their favor. If
after listening to the case for eight days
you are satisfied that the defendant is
not entitled to the land rightfully then
you should render a verdict for the
plaintiff. Mr. Spruance said that the
plaintiff claimed the land; that they
had laid before the Jury a legal title
which is older and better than the de
fendants. Mr. Spruance said that it
is a presumption of law that the parties
having the oldest legal title is entitled
to the land, unless it is proven that the
defendant has had the property a suf
ficient length of time to deprive the
plaiutiff of the right.
Mr. Spruance in hi; remarks alluded
to an article published iu the "Gazette"
a few days ago, in which it is stated
that he could not fnrnish him (the wit
ness Mr. Moore,) with brains."
That statement coming from whatever
source it may is utterly false. Some
people imagine that dog fights are on
the same level with the proceedings of
the court. Mr. Spruance said he came
to try the case as a gentleman and did
not propose to ridicule any of the wit
nesses.
Mr. Spruance commented at some
length on the decrepancies in the
Messrs. Moore's statement and iu
speaking of Mr. Moore'3 evidence he
said, without impeaching his veracity
at al), he must question his entire ac
curacy, as it was impossible for one to
fix dates at as early an age as he then
was. At 6.10 Mr. Spruance had not
concluded his argument and the Court
adjourned until 9 o'clock to-morrow
morning. ,

Doctor West was sitting in his office,
606 King Street, last night answering
the questions of of a Rev. friend iu re
ference to dyspepsia and dysentery,
mumps and bumps, physic and physio
logy, when in stepped Sutterly the
phisiognomy photographer and exhibi
ted some very fine pictures. While
this was going on, the pattering of feet
might have been heard going up and
down the hall stairway and had the
doctor beenj exercising his heading fa
culties as much as he was then exer
cising his brain, he might have also
heard even through his office doors,
titterings and whispering, forebodings
of the surprise that was in store for
him.
When the party about 40 in number
got seated in the parlor the doctor was
informed that an urgent ease awaited
him down stairs. Breathless with haste
the doctor descended the staircase and
entered his parlor only to be met by
the pleasant congratulations of a house
full of friends on reaching his 36th
birthday, while following him cams
Rev. Mr. Maun, running over with new
ly acquired information on dyspepsia,
aud Sutterly displaying his pictures.
The doctor admitted that he was com
pletely "done for," and yielded to the
force of circumstances as gracefully as
his surprised condition would allow and
became the guest of the evening.
Social conversation then ensued,
while some of the party took posses
sion of the dining room and soon the
table was spread and loaded with pyr
amids of fruit and cake. The centre of
the table was ornamentally decorated
with a beautifully iced cake, on the
top of which was the word 'West,' a
present by the Smoot Sisters. A riDg
from the door bell announced the arri
val of Gardner with ice cream, instead
of a messenger for the doctor.
It is only necessary to state the re
freshments were served in abundance,
until the most fastidious appetite waa
satisfied. Upon the return to the par
lor a proposition wa3 made to have a
little through of blindman's buff, when
a festive bald headed youth, who had
passed the half century mile post
was blindfolded. A regular stirring
up ensued aud stoves chairs and tables
were just right where they should not
be whenever the " boy" was on the
point of catching somebody. As luck
would have it however several more
were blindfolded aud know how it was
themselves.
Following this came the real literary
treat of .he evening when by request
Mias Ida Carpenter read a most admir
able aud ably written essay in "Ambi
tion." The production being her own
origina'ly, reflected great credit of Miss
Carpenter aud displayed a deep and
penetrating mind. The conclusion of
the reading of the essay merited and
was received with hearty applause.
Rev. J. B. Mann also addressed the
audience pleasantly alluding to his ac
quaintance with Dr. West and the
great service he had been to him as a
family physician.
Dr. West thanked his friends for the
boLor shown him, an honor which he
appreciated none the less, that it was a
complete surprise. Other addresses
were made aud at a reasonable hour
the company separated and wound
tluir way to their respective homes
well pleased with the evening's enter
tainment. Quite a number of rare and
valuable presents were left with the
doctor as appreciations of the esteem
aud confidence in which he is held by
his friends.

An error crept into our artiole on the

up of the late members of the City

Rev. John Gray, James Budd and
others are the prime movers. They
hold their first public services to-mor

which the charch organization will
