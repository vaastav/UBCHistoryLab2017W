Ye Local's Soliloquy.—To write—and what
to write, that is the question;
Whether'tis nobler for the reporter to make
up
All sorts of dots and local paragraphs,
Thrilling accounts of accidents and things in
general
Without the shadow of a fact whereon
To base a single paragraph or dot;
Or by the lack of a good local column
Lose fifty thousand of our subscribers;—
There's the part
That makes calamity of being a newspaper
paragraphist;
For who could bear the sneers and jeers oj
men
And here them say, "This paper ain't worth
a cent;
It ain't got a bit of local news,
And I'm goin'to stop it?"
Oh! for a marriage or a runaway,
A circus, or a dynamite explosition ;
Oh! for a fight, a horrible, fearful fight
Whose narrative might make our pencil go,
And harrow up the soul of eve ry man
Who pays two dollars a year for this paper,
In order that he might get the worth of his
money
And cause each Individual's hair to stand on
end;
Like frills upon the fretful porcupine!
Oh, Cordelia! how sharper than a serpent's
thanks it is
To run a local column !

Fires Near Fishsrsville.—On last Friday
night about 12 o'clock two stables belonging to
Dr. Dold of Fishersville were destroyed by fire #
The stables were used for storing hay and farm
ing implements. The amount of loss is not
known. The origin of the fire is unknown, but
was doubtless the work of an incendiary, whose
object was plunder; and whose hope and ex
pectation was that by firing the small and some
what remote building which was first set on
fire, that the family would be drawn from the
l)OUse, leaving it and the valuables it contain
ed, unprotected. The alarm however was too
soon spread and an immense crowd was too
soon upon the ground, forthettyieves to accom
plish their purpose.
The buildings were insured in the East Au
gtjsta Mutual Insurace Company.
Central Point School-house, in South River
District took fire on last Tuesday morning at 9
o'clock, but the fire was discovered in time to
prevent any great damage. It caught from the
stove because of a defective Hue.
Greater care should be exercised in fixing the
flues in our country School-houses.

Resolutions of the Staunton Bar Endorsing Judge
Wm. McLaughlin.
At a meeting of the Staunton Bar, which was
attended by all the members who were present
in the City, Capt. Geo. M. Cochran was called to
the Chair, and Charles Grattan appointed Sec
retary.
The Chairman explained the object of the
meeting to be, to take such action as seemed
best, in view of the approaching election Of
Judges, in order to secure to this Circuit a con
tinuance of the services of its present efficient
Judge, Wm. McLaughlin.
The Chair under the resolution appointed
Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, Capt. T. D. Rauson and
Maj. T. C. Elder, who retired and in a short time
reported the following resolutions :
Resolved, That we, the me mbers of the Bar of
the City of Staunton and County of Augusta,
in view of the approaching election of Judges
by the General Assembly and of the proposed
opposition to the re-clection of the present
Judge of the Thirteenth Circuit, deem it not
improper to give some public expression to
our viewi and wishes in tnat regard.
Resolved 2, That this Bar is unanimous in the
opinion that the reelection of Hon. William
McLaughlin, of Lexington, to the olllce which
for eight years past he has filled with so much
credit to himself and such general satisfaction
to the people of his Circuit, will be a tribute
justly due to him for laborious, faithful and ef
hcent service.
Resolved 3, That in our judgment his re-elec
tion will promote the best interests of the cli
ents whom we serve, and his defeat would be
looked upon, in this part of the Circuit, as a
public misfortune.
Resolved, 4, That in his marked judicial abili
ty, his extensive and varied inuormation, his
deiigent attention to business, his promptitude
in disposing of controversy, his well known in
tegrity, impartiality and independence of char
acter, his watchful supervision of trust fuuds,
his remarkablelpowers of memory and tolirough
familiarity with the business of the Circuit,
we recognize qualifications for the office which
we could ill afford to dispense with, and which
it would not be easy to supply.
Resolved, 5, That a committee of livemembers
of this Bar be appointed by the chair, whose
duty it shall be to communisate to our Sena
tor and Delegates the resolutions of this meet
ing, and to represent the body in all proper
measures to promote the object desired.
Upon offering which, Mr. Stuart the chairman
said that he had been at this Bar and others in
this State for a period of more than half a Cen
tury, and all that time, he had never met a
gentleman on the bench, who combined more
diligence, more caution, more correctness and
more firmness than Judge McLaughliri, and
that he should regard it as a public calamity if
his services were lost to the Circuit and the
State.
Mr. J. Addison Waddell said it gave him
great pleasure to attend this meeting and that
he concurred heartily in its object and cordially
endorsed the resolutions reported.
The motion for the adoption of the resolutions
as a whole wss made by Mr. Wm. Patrick and
seconded by Capt. D. S. Young, whereupon they
were unanimously adopted.
The chair under the sth resolution appointed
Maj. T. C. Elder, Capt. Jas. Bumiardner, Jr.,
Meade F. White, Esq., W. A. Hudson, Esq.,
! and G. M. Harrison, Esq.
On motion of Mr. Stuart the meeting adjourn

Pkof. Jok Turner.—On Sunday afternoon of
last week in St. James's Cathedral, Toronto,
Canada, a sermon was preached specially for
deaf-mutes, by our former citizen, Prof. Job
Turner. The sermon, which had oeen written
by Mr. Turner, was read by another, and trans
lated into the sign language by Mr. Turner for
the benefit of the deaf-mutes.
The Toronto Globe says"The service was in
no way different from that observed on ordinary
occasions, only that as the reader proceeded
with the various lessons there was a pause so as
to allow the translator to keep pace with him.
The deaf mutes, a large number of whom were
present, occupied seats immediately in front of
the pulpit. They observed with eager eyes the
movements of the translator, and in the pray
ers many of them made the signs after him.—
The sermon preached was written by the trans
lator, and was based on Psalm ciii. 8: —"The
Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger,
and plenteous in redemption." During the
service a letter was read giving some interest
ing information regarding the progress of reli
gious teaching among the deafanddumbin the
States. The communication stated inter alia
that Rev. Mr. Turner is an earnest and faithful
missionary among those of his fellow-country
men who like himself are deaf-mutes. Jt also
stated that thereare forty stations in the States
where deaf-mutes, numbering altogether three
thousand, receive religious teaching from deaf
mute missionaries. At the close of the services,
which were of a most interesting character, a
collection was taken up on behalf of deaf-mute
mission work."

Free Fight in Craig.—There was a tem
porary revival of the "good old times" at New
Castle, on the Btli instant-county court day.—
Hon. James W. Marshall, who was theopposing
counsel in a case pending in the court against
Mr. C. T. Steele, was approached by the latter
with a big stick, with which, after some warm
words, he.struck Mr. Marshall. This occurred
in the Court-house yard, and immediately af
tervrards the.scene of conflict was chanaged to
the street, Mr. Marshall insisting on Mr. Steele
to "come on."' Steele failed to accept the invita
tion, but kept rather quiet untii Mr. Marshall's
attention wa3 attracted elsewhere, when he
struck him with a stone, on the head. At this
a friend of Mr. Marshall, with a blow with his
list, laid Steele out on the ground, and for a
time things were quite lively. Mr. Marshall's
conduct was approved throughout by his
friends, and the people were highly indignant
at the manner of the assault upon him.—Fin
castle Herald.
Hon. James W. Marshall is State Senator
from Craig, and is well-known to many of our
citizens. He was born and raised in Augusta
county.
Death of Rev. Geo. G. Bkooxe.—The Rev.
Geo. G.Brooke, one of the oldest and most es
teemed ministers in the Baltimore Confeience,
M. E. Church South, died suddenly at his resi
dence in Berry ville, on Sunday last, of paralysis.
He was apparently .in excellent health, and
unusually cheerful, and was preparing to leave
his home to "attend to his ministerial duties,
when disease attacked him. He died before
medical assistance could reach him.
He had been in the ipinistry for oyer fifty
years, and was widely known and highly es
teemed throughout the bounas of Ihe Confer
ence. within which he had labored so long as
one of its most useful and devoted ministers.
He was pastor of the Methodist Church here
in Staunton in 1858 and 1859, when the present
edifice was begun and held services in the
Court-house, during which time he conducted
a most successful revival, which resulted in
over a hundred additions to the church.
His kind benignant countehance and noble
head silvered over by the frost of years, will
long be remembered by many who attended
the Sunday School Convention of the M. E.
Church South here last Summer.

Death of Dr. IJenry Leach.—Dr. Henry

but did not take his bed until Monday evening,
from which time his illness grew \porse and
worse unt}l his death, which was caused, we
learn, by inflammation of Itye braiq.— Tfythe

It will be remembered by many of our citi

A Runaway—A Man Run Over and Se
riously Injured.—On last Saturday morning*
as three wagons, loaded with whiskey from the
distillery of J. Bumgardner & Sons, were un
loading at the warehouse in this city, one of ]
the teams became frightened by a passing j
freight train and ran off. The driver seized the j
bridle of-tlie»leader, and Mr. Ben. Strickier, an 1
aged man, caught the off-wheel horse, but the
bridle on the leader breaking gave the leaders a
chance to run, and, as they did so, Mr. Strick
ier was thrown down and the wagon wheels
passed over him. The wagon was loaded with
nine barrels of whiskey, weighing* over three
thousand pounds. Mr. Strickier had the larger
bone of his left leg broken a short distance
above the ankle, and was painfully bruised
about the hip- and head.
He was taken to the American Hotel, where
he was promptly attended by Drs. Waddell and ;
Gibson. His injuries are serious, and it is fear- ,
ed may prove fatal. He is a worthy but poor j
old man, and will receive the best of attention
that Messrs. Bumgardner &, Sons can give him.
Since writing the above, we learn that his in
juries are not so serious as at first ap, pehended. j
He was removed from the Amerlcun Hotel to
his home in West End onSunday evening, and, ]
though he is sixty-five years old, is doing very
well, and stands every chance of recovering.

countered a deer a few days since whilst out
riding on horseback, and with a presence of

with the aid of a dog, in bringing the deer to a
stand-still, until assistance arrived, when he
was quickly dispatched.
A serious accident occurred at the residence
of Mrs. Sallie McGlaughlin, on Jackson's IMv
er, eight miles from here, on Sunday morning
last. It appears that a young man named
Newman Pritt, who lives with Mrs. McG., and
Hull Kramer, son of Conrad Kramer, Esq., of
Crab Bottom, were playing with a loaded re
volver, which, by some means, was accidently
discharged in the hands of the former, the ball
entering the body of young Kramer, near the
groin, inflicting a painful, but it is to be hoped,
not dangerous wound.
From'the Grant County Gazette of the 6th
inst., we learn that W. F. Dyer, Esq., of Peters
burg, Grant county, W. Va., formerly of Pendle
ton couuty, met withapainfuljand,'most serious
accident, on Monday, 25th ult. It seems that
whilst out gunning in his attempt to cross a
fence, his gun was accidently discharged, and
a full load of bird shot lodged in his right arm,
near the shoulder, rendering amputation neces
jsary.

Social Cluh.—A number of the young ladies
and gentlemen of our city have formed an or
ganization for social entertainments and dances
during the winter. It is a re-organization of
the former (we were just going to say "T. B. Ts,"
but fortunately remembered, in tline, a dire
threat from a fair member should we dare to
do so.) Not knowing the nomenclature of the j
present organization, we must content our
selves with calling it a "Social Club," organiz
ed for the purpose of holding social gatherings,
once a week, at the residence of the respective
members.
Wo cannot refrain from expressing our
hearty approval of this.movement, as nothing
has sogreat a tendency to improve young men
and ladies, both morally and socially, as fre
quent social, joyous, happy meetings together.
To the young men especially it is highly bene
ficial in removing the rough and inelegant ten
dencies of man'sanature, and developes that
easy bearing and gracefulness so characteristic
of those who seek the refined association of
ladies' society.
We wish the club much success and happi
ness in their efforts to pass many pleasant
evenings in each other's; society during the
winter months.

place, would respectfully inform the young la

they have made arrangements for an extensive

A Remarkable Run.—On Thursday night of
last week, Mr. Dorsey Hanger's saddle horse got j
out of the stable, this side of the tunnel, and
wandered off until he got on the railroad in a
cut near Mr. Harper's residence. Shortly aftert
the Express came puffing along. The horse
struck out in a long trot and followed the rail
road, just in front of the engine, which had
checked up, through the tunnel and down as
far as Afton. where he left the track and saun
tered out, apparently unconcerned, upon the
commons, where he was found by the owner
next morning. The tunnel is nearly a mile
through, and it is one mile from the eastern
end to Afton, yet this horse kept the track the
whole way, and never stumbled.—Waynesboro

Burnt to Death.—Last Friday
eveniDg a little colored child, about 3
years old, the daughter of John Wood
son, the barber, was playing near the
fire, when her clothes caught, and she
was so badly burned before the flames
were extinguished, that she died In a
few hours afterwards. The mother of
the child had just stepped out of the
house for a few moments to attend to
some household matter, when the acci

but could afford no relief.—Mountain

Science has accomplished no more wonder
ful or gratifying result than the perfection of
an antidote to the chilling signs of approaching
age, something to obliterate the tell-tale
tracks of time, and preserve natural adorn
ments of youth to ripe old age. Hall's Hair
Ren ewer does all this, and its praise resounds
in cottage and palace. The dwellers among the
snows of Norway and the peasants of sunny
France and Spain, find use for it, and find
means to get it, and it does not disappoint
them. The whitening locks again resume their
youthful color, the thin, dry, and faded hair be
comes bright and glossy. Tbe whole appear
ance is changed as if by my magic, and the
man or woman, who, before was called aged,
now appears as one in the prime of life. Such
wonderous changes cannot pass unnoticed,
and they have produced the unprecedented de
mand that now exists for the first and only ar
ticle ever compounded that can produce them
in a pleasing and satisfactory manner.—New

A Gentle Hint.
In our style of climate, with its sudden
changes of temperature,—rain, wind, and sun
shine, often intermingled In a single day,—it is
no wonder that our children, friends and rela
tives are so frequently taken from us by neg
lected colds, half the deaths resulting directly
from this cause. A bottle of Boschee's German
Syrup kept about your home for immediate use
will prevent serious sickness, a large doctor's
bill, and perhaps death, by the use of three or
four doses. For curing Consumption, Hemor
rhages, Pneumonia, Severe Coughs. Croup or
any disease of the Throat or Lungs, its success
is simply wonderful, as your druggists will tell
you. German Syrup is now sold in every town
and village on this continent. Sample bottles
for trial, 10 cents. Regular size 75 cents. For
sale by Dr. N. Wayt ift Bko., or G. W. May &
