THE PRESIDENT'S CALL TO
CONGRESS
DUG OUT BY MOOT
President Harding, in his message has
sent a clarion call to Congress, together
with a constructive program of proposed
legislation. It remains to be seen
whether Congress will abandon its aimless
bickering and partisan buncombe by ac
complishing the major part of the bene
ficial legislation which the President pro
poses. The President suggests that there is
need to begin with the co-ordination oi
transportation facilities and he asserts
that "public interest demands that ample
power be conferred upon a labor tribunal,
whether the present board or the stig

He wishes American citizens who are
tearing down the moral fibre of the Re
public through their easy contempt for
prohibition to realize that they are setting
an example and breeding contempt for law
which, if not checked, will ultimately de
stroy the nation. He declares pointedly
that there are conditions relating to pro
hibition enforcement "which savor of
national scandal," and he adds, "It is
the most demoralizing factor in our pub
lic life." He scorns the idea that the
Eighteenth Amendment ever will be re
pealed, but if the statutory provisions
for its enforcement are contrary to de
liberate public sentiment, which he doesi
not believe, "the rigorous and literal en
forcement will concentrate on any re
quisite modification." For the purpose
of a more definite policy of national and
state co-operation the President proposes
a conference of governors.

As the People View It
Albuquerque, N. M., Dec. 11, 1922.
Judging from articles appearing
in tho papers regarding the impos
ition of fines for violations of the
parking ordinance, one would be
led to suppose thut citizens were
violating those laws deliberately
and maliciously, instead of inno
cently, as in my case.
The ordinance that 1 have, or
know anything about, reads:
"Sec. 61. That it shall be un
lawful for any person to park or
place any autovnobilo or other ve
hicle in that part of the City of
Albuquerque known as designated
as the Second Street Park Zone,
which zone is described as being
nil of that part of Second street
from the southern boundary of the
alky on Second street, between
Central avenue and Gold avenne,
and the northern boundary of the
alley on Second street between
Central avenue and Copper avenue."

Decision Has Been Reached
by Secretary Wallace
After Long Study of the
Packers' Proposal
Washington, Dec. 12. The gov
ernment will take no action at this
time on the proposed acquisition
of Morris and company physical
assets by Armour and company of
Chicago, it was formally announced
today by the secretary of agricul
ture. This decision was reached by
Secretary AValk.ce after long study
of the proposal and conferences
with President Harding and Attor
ney General Daugherty. There wo
no Indication In AVashington whe
ther Armour and company would
proceed with their negotiation for
tho Morris establishment which is
a competitor and ono of the "Big
Five" packing establishments.
o Occasion for Action
Secretary Wallace declared there
appeared to bo no occasion for ac
tion at this time under the packers
and stock yards act in connection
with the proposal informally laid
before him by J. Ogden Armour.
.Mr. Wallace also transmitted this
information and additional data
on the proposal to tho senate in '
response to a resolution of Senator'
La Follette, r publican, of AViscon
sin. In a formal announcement, Mr.
AS'allace- declared there was no
thing in the packer and stockyards
act which specifically prohibits the
purchase by one packer of the
physical assets of another. An
opinion by Attorney General
Daugherty made public with the
announcement, said the act is es
sentially a regulatory ono and that
the duties and powers of the sec
retary of agriculture thereunder
are to regulato the Industry.
The attorney general declared
neither tho act itself nor the reg
ulation provided for therein con
templates of requires that the sec
retary of agriculture Ehould advise
the industry In regard to such a.
transaction as proposed by Mr. Ar
mour in advance of its consumma
tion. Mr. Daugherty said the act
vested Mr. Wallace with broad
Powers of inquiry -and ho was of
Ihe opinion Mr. Wallace might
make sueli inquiry.
"Tho language of the packers
and stock yards act," said Mr.
Daugherty. "makes It clear to me
that the act does not require you
to tako any formal action unless
you have reason to believo that the
iaw has been violated or is being
violated. To constitute a violation
of the law within the meaning of
this act, there must be something
more than a mero statement or
what a person or corporation con
templates. CUcs Court Decision
Citing a. decision of the supreme
court involving the act, Mr. Daugh
erty quoted from Chief Justice Taft
as follow-s: '
"Its provisions are carefully
drawn to apply only to those prac
tices and obstructions which, in the
judgment of congress, are likely
to affect interstate commerce pre
judicially." Briefs of Armour and company
presented to Secretary Wallace and
transmitted to tho senate contend
ed that the consolidation would not

THE SERVICE CROSS OF PEACE
One of the greatest wars that have
been carried on in behalf of humanity is
that which is being waged by the National
Tuberculosis Association. Silently, but
perseveringly and against overwhelming
odd.4, the work of saving lives and exterm
inating the dread "White Plague" goes on.
Millions of people are enlisted in the war
to destroy tuberculosis, which yearly reaps
a ghastly harvest of human lives.
But in this, as in all Avars, ammunition
is needed, if the enemy is to be routed.
Money is needed. You gave in a Avar to.
TODAY'S IB1OT THOUGH
We complain of the want of many things; we
want votes, wo want liberty, we want amusements,
we want money. Which of us feels or knows that he
wants peace? There are two ways of getting It, if
you do want It. The first is wholly in your power;
to make yourselves nests of pleasant thoughts . . .
None of us yet know, for none of us have yet been
taught in early youth what fairy palaces we may
build of beautiful thought proof against all ad
versity. Bright fancies, satisfied memories, noble
histories, faithful sayings, treasure-houses of prec

from us, houses built without hands, for our soult
to live in. '

brief said, "is in n, different situa
tion from any other private in

a governmental agency, tho secre
tary of agriculture, who is given
power to investigate and prevent
in the packing industry unfair
methods of competition, unreason
able restraints of fcraTle or mono
polies, and should it appear to him
at any time that any such situa
tion exists so far ns this company
is concerned, or any oilier paciunb
company, ho is empowered to in
vestigate and correct it, so that
our statements of what the results
of this acquisition will he may be
accepted with the confidence and
assurance that if in the future a
different situation should develop,
the secretary of agriculture will
promptly use powers vested in him
to correct it." '
