authoritatively, that she will grace the
Academy boards in Minneapolis some

THE next legislature of Minnesota,
which will be known as the twenty-sec

THE "Waseca Radical is again under
the editorial control of its owner, \V. G.

is anything but high-toned under his
management, lie is fighting Dunnell as
vigorously now as before election.
TIIE Presidential electors met in all the

As WE intimated last week, the at
tempted burglarizing oi Gulbrundson's
safe at Albert Lea proved to have been
"co Ued up" by a detective. The Stand­
ard gives the facts as follows: '"On Mon­
day last the man who was arrested for at
tempting to burglarize Gr.lbrandson's
store was discharged from custody, lie
proved to be one A Wi»d, a noted de­
tective {in the emp'oy of Pinkerton's de­
tective agency in Cliic ig sand the sup­
posed burgiaiy was a ruse to get him into
jail in connection with the Riley case."
The Text Book Act to Stand.
Judges Giltill tn and F. 11. E. Cornell,
of the Supreme Court, and Wilkin and
Bi ill of the District court, with the Sec
retary of State, made the canvass of the
vote cast on the text book law. The vote
as cast is 4-1,739 in favor of continuing
the law and 45,465 against it. But the
law under which the question was sub­
mitted required that a majority of all the
xotes cast at said election shall be against
the law to suspend its provisions, and as
there were 120,000 votes polled in the
counties authorized to vote upon the prop
osi'.ion, aud the negative votes.lacking
about 15,000 of a majority, the declara­
tion is that the law shall continue for
five year9 more, when it will require
two thirds of all the votes cast to suspend
the law.
Examination of John Riley.
HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS.
The ground on which the writ of habeas
corpus was issued, which was sued out
by John Riley last week Wednesday, was
argued before his honor, Judge Farmer,
on Thursday, and on Friday a decision
given. Judge Farmer refused to quash
the writ on the motion of Page. He also
refused to discharge the prisoner, but
ruled that the crime was a bailable one,
and fixed the amount of bail at $5,000 for
the appearance of Riley ai Dexter Dec.
6th. He ruled that the choice of jails
rests with the committing magistrate, and
•when that officer decides upon that, it is
final and conclusive,
and he (the Judge)
could not review it upon a writ of habeas
corpus.
THE EXAMINATION.
It wa9 nearly seven o'clock Monday
evening before court opened at Dexter.
An affidavit of prejudice and bias of Jus­
tice Gaskill was made by Riley, and the
case was transferred to Kelley, another
justice in same town. Court then ad­
journed to 9 A. M. Tuesday.
'J'lie first witness sworn Tutsday A.
was Sherman Page, who was on the stand
about three honrs. Page introduced some
letters In evidence from the Warden of
the Wisconsin state prison showing that
Riley had been an inmate of that institu­
tion, and that his brothers, Tom and
Frank, were there when he was released.
A. E Cox testified as to some matters
connected with the shooting.
These two witnesses cousuuitd the fore­
noon.
In the afternoon Larry Nugent and Geo.
Rapp were sworn. They saw the pris
oner in Austin during the summer. Did
not know whether it was before or after
the shoo'ing.
Some man who works for Jim Patch in
Nevada was sworn. He said he was a
guard in the Wisconsin prison at a time
when John Riley was there.
Amos Hill was sworn. He met a man
the night of the shoting running towards
town from the direction of Page's house.
The night was so dark that he could not
tell who It was.
The detective, Wood, was on the stand,
when our informant left Dexter.
There area large number of witnesses
yet to be heard, and it is thought the
examination will not close before this
(Wednesday) evening.
The Chinese Tr**4t«a.
Two treaties have been negotiated with
China. The first relates mainly to the
question ot Chinese emigration and the
other is a commercial treaty. In the first
the Chinese government practically leaves
the subject of regulating emigration to
the decision and control of the United
States. Th« commission which was sent
to China found much lets difficulty in
treating upon this branch of the subject
than had been anticipated, owinf to the
tact that the Chinese government have
sever been anxious to have its citicens
emigrate to any country in such numbers
as they have to this. China held that,
under the treaty between the two nations,
the right of Chinese citizens to come to
the United States was clear, as was the
4«ty of our authorities to protest them.
Still, as there seemed to be so much trou­
ble over the matter in certain quarters,
aud such strong opposition to the pres­
ence of ChinameM, the settlement of ihe
terms upon which they could hereafter
enter the country was left almost entirely
to the United States. In return for this
concession, some new and important com­
mercial privileges have been granted in
the second treaty, which regulates the
whole subject of commercial intercourse.
Hereafter Chinese shipping will be placed
on the same footing as that of the most
favored ualions. It is expected that the
duties paid last summer under protest on
the Chinese vessel which put in at San
Francisco will be refunded within a week.
A second Chinese vessel will arrive at
Sau Francisco, and will be allowed to
enter that port upon the same terms that
are imposed upon ships of other nations.
These two treaties, while separate instru­
ments, will be considered together, and
be treated as virtually one by the execu­
tive. It is expected that the president, in
his annual message, will make a general
statement of the nature of these treaties,
and transmit them to the senate in execu­
tive session, with a full statement of the
work of the commission in negotiating
them. Then prompt ratification at the
hands of the senate is expected. The
Chinese authorities have already been ex­
erting their influence through the consu­
late officers ot Havana to check any fur
tlier emigration of Chinese labor to the
South. Strong efforts have been made
for some time past by the sugar-planters
in Louisiana to import Cliiuese labor
from Cuba, but thus lar it has met with
little success, owing to the opposition
of the Chinese consul, and hereafter it is
likely to be almost entirely stopped. It
is believed that the new treaty of com­
merce with China will give a great im­
petus to the trade between the two coun­
tries.
Vulgar Words.
What can be more vile than vulgar
words? What habit can be more utterly
without excuse than vulgar talking, more
meaningless or more degrading?
We think so well of our women that
we cannot lay this charge of vulgarity at
their door. We know there are vulgar
women, but we are proud to say that we
think ihe great mass ot them are cleau
speaking. May God have mercy on a
vulgar woman—for we never will! We
have no language with which we can fitly
characterize this vile habit in men and
when itcouies to talking about it iu wo
men, words are meaningless. A vulgar
woman unfit company for the beasts.
And a good woman who will in any way
encourage a vulgar-speaking woman,
commits, we think, a most heinous sin.
It' the good woman can do no more she
can rebuke the vulgar word with a silence
that is withering. No vulgar person,
man or woman, should iu any way be en­
couraged iu the utterance of a vulgar
word.
But in this article we address ourself
chiefly to men. It was among men the
habit of vulgarity was born aud it is
among men that it rankly flourishes.
And we wish we could say something
here that would have a tendency to cuie
this vile, vicious aud most unnecessary
abit.
A vulgar word never means anything
in common conversation—never. Aud
what sense is there, or comfort can there
be, in pouring out a lot of stuff that
simply befouls yourself, and every body
el.-e within hearing of your voice? A
man who does this, must know, if he ever
gives the matter a thought, that he is de­
grading himself that he is absolutely
poisoning the world with filth.
We take great care of our victuals. We
want them clean. Our water must be
pure and clean. We want our houses
kept cleanly. We want our clothing
clean. Good women may work them­
selves to death to keep our food, our
homes, our clothing clean, and we call
them good house-keepers. But what do
we ourselves do to keep the man himself
clean
Do you ask: What standard would you
set up for men's speech
Just this. Speak so that if your speech
at any time—and all unknown to you—
should be overheard by a number of wo­
men whom you most respect, and that it
the doors which separated you from them
should be instantly thrown open, you
could face them without a blush. What
a !gnificeut man is he who thus orders
his speech! And what earthly reason is
there why all meu should not do so?
We sny to fathers: Always speak so
that you will have no occasion to blush
should your wives and daughters over­
hear you. Fathers kuow that this is a
good and true test. How many are will
ing to square their speech in accordance
with it? We say to youns feptak
so lhat you will never be ashamed to
know lhat your good mother, or jr»ur sis
ter, or your &weel-heart has overheard you.
How many young men are willing to ap­
ply this test lo their speech?
How many fathers do say things they
would not like to have their wives aud
daughters hear. How many brothers say
things they would not like to have their
sisters hear. How many men, who style
themselves as gentlemen, say things thev
would not like to have their lady frieuds
hear. How many young men say things
they would be ashamed to have their
sweet-hearis hear. And what a sorry
thing that this is so and how conclu­
sively it proves the wickedness and dir­
tiness of vulgar words. A word that is
unfit for a pure woman to hear is unfit
to use.
Men may talk upon matters which
should not be subjects of conversation in
the presence of women, but such matters
can be discussed iu pure, clean language.
There is no occasion for the use of filthy
words any where, at any time, or in talk­
ing npon sny subject.
In this article we only plead decen­
cy. Wby should not every well disposed
man give heed to our words? A. man ac­
tually thinks more of himself if he keeps
his clothing sad his
body clean. He will
think iufinitely more of himself if he
keep* bis mind and his mouth clean.
Old man, middle-aged man, young man,
try this, and be surprised to see what a
charm it adds to your life. The atmos
phere around you will seem purer because
you are purer within.
We waat fathers to show this article to
Ifaeir eons 'twill do them food. We
want wivea to show thia article to their
husbands it can do them no harm to read
it. Wc waat mothers to show it to their
sons 'twill do them good. We want
sisters to put it before their brothers
'twill do them good. We want young
women, who have sense and bravery
enough to do so, to call the attention of
the young men who are waiting upon
them, to it 'twill do them good.
Aud men, let us all, for the sake of
ourselves, for the snkc of our mothers, and
our wives, our sisters, our daughters, for
the sake ot all the "little children every
where, for the sake ot all humanity, let
us do just as little vulgar talking as pos­
sible—aud that is just none at all.
Dliiiiu-sota Sugar.
The Faribault refinery gives evidence
)f profitable business for the farmer who
raises amber cane. The Democrat has
the following in regard to the refinery and
its results:
"The small amouut of sugar already
refined, although by an imperfect ma­
chine, aud consequently not Well cleaned
of molasses, was a fine article and highly
satisfactory, the crystals feeing large and
firm aud entirely free from foreign mat­
ter, the polariscope test showing a purity
ot 95 to 98 per cent. It is estimated that
the sugar product this season will be
about ten tons, valued at nine cents per
pound. But the production of sugar is
but a very small portion ot the business
of the refinery this season. There were
about 400 tons of cane worked up at the
refinery and the amouut of crude syrup
produced elsewhere aud refined here will
reach at least 1,000 barrels, of which Mr.
Seth Keuney, of Morristown, the most
successful cane grower of the State, furn­
ished 250 barrels. The relined syrups are
pure and free of adulteration, have a
heavy body aud are of a rich, delicate
flavor. Orders for this syrup are pouring
iu from all quarters and there is uo trou­
ble iu disposiug of it the principal
trouble being to t.ell judiciously and let
the test of the goods be as widespread
as possible. Eastern dealers have begged
for the entire product ot the refine.y, but
this has been refused, as the object is to
let the people know that the Faribault,
Minnesota, refinery is not only producing
a first class article of syrup, but a perfect­
ly pure article—facts already admitted by
New York experts.
In response to a request of Governor
Pitlsburv, Dr. Wilheiin has written anil
caused to be published in pamphlet form,
tiie results of his experiment in the Far­
ibault refinery and yives the cost of pro­
duction at about 15 cents per gallon, the
yield from 1G0 to 200 gallons per acre, aud
the profit over all expense from $18 to $20
per acre. The l)r. urges the central re­
finery system as the uiont satisfactory, and
issks lhat ihe planters consult him and Mr.
!ly in reference to methods by which
they can produce the best results. The
capacity of the refinery is to be greatly
increased and there is no lousier the leas'
question but what cane-growing and su­
gar making on ail extensive scale is now
an assured fact in Minnesoia.

The new American Newspaper Directory of
Geo. P. Row ell & Co. is a volume of more than
a thousand pages, and undoubtedly the most
elaborate and complele work of the kind ever
issued. The arrangements of the lists by
States and in alphabetical order, is such as to
make reference easy and besides there is
for every town in which a newspaper is pub­
lished, a statement of location, population,
lines of communication, and distinguishing
characteristics that is very valuable to all who
seek information of a general nature. The
mechanical execution ot the work would be a
credit to any publisher in this country,
From business relations with Messrs. Rowell
& Co., extending over about a dozen years,
and a tolerably familiar acquaintance with
their publications, we never have been in"
clined to—and do not now—believe they are
actuated by any but the most commendable
motives in the compilation of their Directory.
They have shown admirable independence
and determination in the prosecution of their
task but as was inevitable they have incur­
red the displeasure of some who. don't kno*
why and more whose attempts to swindle in
the matter of circulation have been to some
extent thwarted. In an age when knavery is
so prevalent an honest man is often compell­
ed to chose between his own conscience and
some of the highest moral pretenders, whom
he will serve in other matters than publish­
ing Newspaper Directories.—Fulton (JV. Y.)

COPYING- AND ENLARGING A SPECIALTY.
Rupture
Dr. J. A. Sherman—And The Only Tr. Sherman known to the public for the
past 35 years or more for hie successful method of treating Rupture without the annoyance and injury
trusses inflict, may be consulted at his office, ST. LOUIS, MO., UNTIL TBE 30TH OF DECEMBER, after tkat
at his New York office. Office address is in the St. Louis city newspapers.
Mr. B. F. George, Attorney-at-Law, Sent, Union Co., Iowa, treated by Dr. Sherman at his St. Louis office,
writes: "Havingused your Rupture treatment, and having been permanently cured, I have spoken highly
of its merits and recommend it to my friends.'*
Or. Sherman is the discoverer of the only known cure for Rupture by local external treatment.
No man is safe who has a rupture, no matter how insignificant he may consider it, for every man who has
died from it once fluttered himself that it was but a trifling ailment and every man who now suffers from it
and the injury of trusses, to such an extent that life has no enjoyments, once regarded it as unworthy special
attention. It is not a stand-still affliction it is steadily progressive, even unto death and he is wise who takes
the necessary steps to be relieved of it before the day of suffering and gloom comes upon him.
Patients from abroad can receive treatment and leave for home the same day. During treatment any kind of
active exercise or labor can be performed without interfering with the treatment, and with safety from the
dangers of strangulated Rupture. His Book On Rupture gives the most reliable proofs from
distinguished professional gentlemen, clergymen, and merchants of his successful practice and popularity
therefrom throughout this country and the West Indies. The afflicted sh«nld read it and inform themselves.
It is illustrated with photographic likenesses of extremely bad cases before and after enre, and mailed to
those who send 10 cents.
