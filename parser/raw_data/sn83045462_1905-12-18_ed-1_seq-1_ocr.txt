BIG BANK FAILURE
Three Chicago Concerns Are
Forced to Quit Business.
CONTROLLER'S ACTION
DIFFICULTIES DUE LARGE LOANS
BY JOHN B. WALSH,
Who Dominated Affairs of the Chicago
National, the Homes Savings and
Equitable Trust Company.
CHICAGO, December 18.?Action has
bten taken by Controller of the Currency
William B. Ridgely that will compel the
three large financial institutions?the Chi
cago National Bank, the Home Savings
B.ink and the Equitable Trust Company?
dominated by John R. Walsh of this city
to wind up their affairs.
The other national banks of the city have
come to the rescue, and It is declared on
the authority of the clearing-house asso
ciation, the controller and also by the offi
cers of the Chicago National Bank that
not a single depositor ?will lose a cent.
The difficulties of the three banks, which
are practically branches of the same In
stitution, are attributed by the controller
of the currency to the large loans made
by the Chicago National Bank to the rail
road, coal mining and other private enter,
prises controlled by Mr. Walsh.
Some time ago the controller called the
attention of the officers of the bank to
the fact that they were making loans to
these enterprises of Mr. Walsh which. In
his opinion, were too largo for the safety
of the Institution. Repeated promises wore
made that the situation should be recti
fied, but no action satisfactory to the
controller was taken. Three days ago he
came to Chlc:igo for the purpose of making
an investigation into the affairs of the
three banks, and found them in such a
condition that he judged immediate action
to be necessary. Some trifling delay had
ensued because of the inability of Mr.
Ridgely to meet the officers of the bank
and officials of the state auditor's office.
Two Under State Supervision.
rl he fact that the Home Savings Bank
fiid the Equitable Trust Company are
tinder state supervision made the pres
ence of the latter official necessary. Offi
cials of the different Chicago banks were
told of the situation, and a hurried call
was sent out for a meeting of representa
tives of the Chicago Clearing House As
sociation, as well as the officers of the
city banks. The meeting was called to
order in the office of President Forgan>>f
the First National Bank at 3 o'clock yes
terday afternoon, and was In continuous
session until 5 o'clock this morning.
A careful canvass of the situation re
vealed that the Chicago National Bank
had deposits to the amount of $16,000,000
the Home Savings Bank had savings de
posits to the extent of J4.000.000, divided
among about 8,000 depositors.
liabilities of the two banks and of
the Equitable Trust Company were
roughly estimated at l'JG.000,000. The as
sets of the three Institutions made up
about $20,000,000 of this amount and the
directors and officials of the Chicago Na
tional Bank came to the front with secu
rities amounting to about *.'{,000,000 more.
A Deficit of Three Millions.
This left a deficit of about $3,000,000 to
be faced, and the Chicago banks repre
sented at the meet'-'g declared at once
that they would meet the situation and
care for the deficit. If it proved neces
sary to advance any more than $3,000,000
to meet all demands the banks pledged
themselves to make up the amount what
ever It might be.
The great difficulty confronting the
bankers in the meeting was to arrange a
legal settlement of the case In the piti
fully short time at their disposal before
the hour of commencing business this
morning. 1,118
It was finally arranged that. In addition
to winding up the affairs of the three
financial institutions, the allied bankers
should take all of Mr. Walsh's private
enterprises, Including his coal mines and
railroads and stone quarries.

ised capital of $.'100,000, Increased to $000 000
in 1887 and to $1,000,000 In 1801.
Its resources, according to one of the
Jatsst reports made to the controller of
ths currency, are $21,000,000. of which near
ly $11,000,000 are loans and discounts, with
$4,000,000 cash on hand. The liabilities in
clude nearly $14,000,000 in individual de

000 Is reported as being held in municipal
railroad and other bonis. The savings

teclude $2,707,063 of deposit* in trust, $4?4,
S23 certificates of deposit, and |401,574
through various trusts.
A Tremendous Surprise.
To the public at large, which was not
acquainted with the magnitude of Mr.
Walsh's enterprises, the news of the difti
cultTes surrounding his banks came as a
tremendous surprise. Not a word of the
difficulty had rcached the public Saturday
night, and the first information was con
veyed by extra editions of the morning
lepers.
Two hours before the time for the open
ing of the bank larse crowds of persons
who had money In the Chicago National
and the Home Savings Bank gathered In
front of the bank waiting for the doors 'o
open that they might withdraw their funds.
Inside tlie t anks ample provision had been
made for the impending run. Money wr-.
laid out in large piles, additional clerks
were stationed at the paying window? anl
arrangements were made in other parts or
the bank to pay out the money as fast as
It was called for.
Bush Began at 10 O'Clock.
G. C. Johnson, a messenger for another
bank, who had J10 In the Home Savings
Bank, was the first at the door. He held
the head of the line when the doors were
opened, and the rush began at 10 o'clock.
It was announced by Vice President
Blount of the Chicago National Bank that
all demands would be paid as fast as they
were made, both at the Chicago National
Bank and the Home Savings Bank. The
latter has the right under the state law to
demand sixty days' notice before with
drawal from all depositors, but It was de
cided not to Invoke thus rule and to pay
every account as soon as called for.
Personnel of Institutions.
John R. Walsh has been for years a con
spicuous figure In the life of Chicago. He
was born in Ireland, August 22, 1837, and
came With ljis parents*to the United States
when ten years of age, settling in Chicago.
He soon found employment with J. McNal
ly, a news dealer, proved very energetic
and Intelligent, and in 1861 established a
news business of his own, including a book
and stationery store on onp of the most
prominent corners of the city.
Later he consolidated his news business,
which consisted of the circulation of daily
and weekly newspapers and periodicals,
with the American News Company, Mr.
Walsh becoming president of the Western
News Company, which wa3 affiliated with
the American News Company of New York.
Mr. Walsh was also a director of the
American News Company. The business
proved exceedingly profitable and Mr.
Wals'a achieved a large fortune. He be
ca-?? a director of the National Bank of
Illinois, ;;n.d in 3SV' founded the Chicago
National Bank, of which lie lias been presi
dent down to the present :ime. In 1S--2 he
also purchased a controlling Interest in the
Chicago Herald, which some jeir.s later
he sold to his associate, .James W. Scott.
Ujvon Mr. Scott's death the paper p issed
Into the hands of H. H. Kohisaat, and was
subsequently reorganized as the Chicago
Record-Herald. Mr. Walsh then founded
the Chicago Chronicle, of which he has
been the controlling spirit for nine years.
Mr. Walsh is n man o; Impulsive tempera
ment and extraordinary energy. His banks
passed "safely through tiie financial panic
of 1 and weie regarded as institutions
of g'eat strength.
Tiie officers of the Chicago National
Bank are:
President. John K. Walsh; vice presi
dent. Fred M. BloiUit; cashier, T. M. Jack
son. The directors are: F. G. McNally,
John K. Walsh. F. M. Blount. John M.
Smyth. W. Best, C. K. G. Billings, Maurice
Rohonfeid.
The officers of the Home Savings Bank
are: W. J. Onahan, president; Charles E.
Schick, cashier. The directors are: C. K.
G. Billings. Maurice Rosenfeld, John M.
Smyth. W. J. Onahan. William Best, F. G.
McXally. John R. Walsh.
The officers and directors of the Equi
table Trust Company are practically the
same as those of the two banks.
Walsh Declined Interview.
Mr. Walsh stayed home this morning
and declined to see anybody. He has not
been well for a number of days, and
neither yesterday nor today would he
leave his room. Callers at his residence
were referred to the bank for informa
tion, and to the request for a statement
which was sent to him Mr. Walsh sent
back word;
"I have nothing to say. Any statement
that is to be made will come from the
Clearing House Association."
The excitement over the suspension of
the two banks had largely subsided by
11 o'clock. * There was no crowd around
the Chicago National Bank, and except
for the number of visitors and possibly a
larger number of people In the lobby of
the bank than usual it would not have
been known that any but the regular con
ditions existed.
The offices of the Home Savings Bank
are In the same building as the Chicago
National, and here a line of depositors
was formed reaching out to Monroe street
and fifty feet west to the corner of La
Salle street. A large detail of policemen
was present, and the assurances of those
who had recelvod their money that the
officials of the bank declared that every
body would be paid allayed excitement.
All claims were paid as quickly as pass
books were presented.
Money Withdrawn Rapidly.
In the Chicago National Bank there was
no outward evidence of a run, although
money was being- drawn out with great
rapidity. Many business men who called
were told that checks for the amount of
their balances would be accepted as de
posits at other banks, and they departed
without drawing out the actual currency.
The small depositors asked for their
money, and In every Instance It was handed
to them at once. It was announced at 11
o'clock that Controller Ridgely would In
a short time issue a statement declaring
that the Walsh assets would be liquidated,
and "should cover the Indebtedness."
At other banks there was no apparent ex
citement and no evidence- of a run upon
them. The statement was made at nil of
the banks that they were guaranteeing the
deposits of the Chicago National and Home
Saving?, and there was not the slightest
ground for apprehension.
Dawes on the Situation.
Cliarles G. Dawes, former controller of the
currency, and now president and manager
of the Central Trust and Savings Bank of
this city, said this morning there was abso
lutely no danger of any other Chicago
bank being involved, nor Is there any other
bank in financial difficulty. Similar state
ments were made by Charles L. Hutchin
son, vice president of the Corn Exchange
National Bank; James H. Eckels, president
of the Commercial National, and 1). R.
Forgan, president of the First National.
The city of Chicago had $2,800,000 on de
posit with the Chicago National Bank and
the Equitable Trust Company. No official
Information was given the city treasurer,
F. W. Block!, of the difficulty, although
nearly every bank In the clearing house Is
on his bond. As soon as he read the morn
ing papers he called upon these banks and
they assured him that the city would be
amply protected, that he could draw checks
against the city's balance In the Chicago
National and Equitable Trust Company and
that the clearing house would see that they
were paid.
Officers and Directors Resigned.
At noon It was announced that all the offi
cers and directors of the Chicago National
Bank had resigned and their places taken
by men selected by the Clearing House As
sociation. President Walsh's place was
taken by Bank Examiner C. H. Bosworth,
and the places of the retiring directors were
taken by the following men:
J. B. Forgan, president of the First Na
tional Bank: Orson Smith, president of the
Merchants' Loan and Trust Company; James
H. Eckels, iiresident of the Commercial
National Bank; Byron L. Smith, president

Revolutionists in Russia Busy
With New Plans.
SECRET MEETING HELD
TENTATIVE DECISION TO STRIKE
IE COMMITTEE ACCEDES.
Railroad Men Warned Against Acting
Rashly ? Mutinous Leaders Ar
rested at Moscow.
ST. PETERSBURG, December 18, 2:30 p.
m.?The revolutionary organizations are
making"feverish preparations to light the
government's policy of repression. The new
workmen's council, representatives of other
proletariat organizations and also the
League of I.eagues met secretly in the out
skirts of St. Petersburg today and dis
cussed ways and means until almost morn
ing. The great majority of the members
favored the immediate proclamation of the
general strike which had been planned for
January, but It was agreed that succcss de
pended on whether the railroad men would
participate.
It Is understood that a tentative decision
was arrived at to strike on Wednesday,
provided the central committee at Moscow
consents. There is' a division of sentiment
in the ranks of the railroad men and the
government has made a special effort to
redress some of the grievances, dreading
above all things a suspension of traffic on
the railroads, which would make It Im
possible to transport troops.
A railroad man said to the Associated
Press today: "We have a majority of our
demands granted, besides the people in
the small towns along the railroads were
so enraged at the last strike that they
are likely to kill any railroad man they
can catch In the event of another strike."
A Grim Warning.
However, the government's note practical
ly notifying the railroad men that If they
strike the authorities will be unaible to
afford them protection is regarded as grim
warning thatT they will be abandoned to
the mercies of the "black hundred" and
another note has been Issued threatening
them with "exceptional measures," If the
legal means do not suffice.
The revolutionary agitation Is adding oil
to the flames. The Russ, which appears un
der the name of Slolva ("Fame") today in
a stirring editorial, summons all the or
ganizations to sink their differences and
present a solid front to the advancing hosts
of reaction. The paper says: "Wltte is at
last unmasked and has shown himself a
worthy successor of Von f'lehve and Tre
foil by tearing up the government's prom
ises. But every blow of fraction Is like the
blows of a hammer which welds flrme> the
sword with which ihe nation will win free
dom."
TRIAL OF EDITORS.
Will Not Occur Until After Holidays
Tyranny Resented.
ST. FETERSBL'RG, Saturday, December
16 (night), via Eydtkuhnen, December 18.?
The public prosecutor informs the Asso
ciated Press that the trial of the editors
whose papers were suspended yesterday
cannot occur before the holidays owing to
the legal formalities. Most of the publishers
will have recourse to the old trick used In
the days of the censorship of appearing un
der a new name. Under the law, however.
It requires a fortnight to secure a franchise,
during which the government will enjoy
Immunity from the daily harpooning.
The publishers' union tried vainly to in
duce the Novoe Vremya and the Slovo to
print the workmen's manifesto in order
that all the papers be in the same boat,
whereupon the workmen's council coolly
stepped in not with a request, but the com
mand- that the papers publish it with the
alternative of calling a strike In their of
fices. Thus the matter stands.
The resentment against the tyranny of
the socialist organizations is illustrated by
the reply of M. Roditcheff, one of the mocrt
prominent liberals in Russia, to a deputa
tion 'of social democrats who served a notioe
on him xls the representative of the consti
tutional democrats that they would regard
the latter as traitors unless they renounce
?the monarchy.
MUTINEERS SURRENDERED.
Ten of the Ringleaders Arrested?Re
forms Acceded.
Special Cablegram to The Star.
MOSCOW, December 18.?The Rostoff
Grenadier Regiment, which mutinied on
Saturday and fortified itself in its barracks,
surrendered today, and ten of the ringlead
ers, Including SchaharofC. the chief of them,
were arrested. The less<4mportant demands
of the soldiers were granted, Including pri
vacy of their letters, an Increase of rations
and regular payment.
Besides the demands above mentioned the
grenadiers made many of a political charac
ter. When they mutinied they freed by
force such of their comrades as were under
arrest and seized the arsenal. Their colo
nel sent them a message, offerings g.ve all
proper grievances his consideration.

street fighting at Mitau, the capital of
Courtland, three hundred persons were
killed.
At Lennewarden. in Southern Livonia,

Is reported that 00,000 rebels, well armed,

A dispatch to the Central News from

SERIOUS EIOT AT SHANGHAI?
BUSINESS SUSPENDED.
?
MEW YORK, December 18.?A serious riot
among coolie laborers, resulting in tlie death
of twenty Chinese and injury of several
foreigners, occurred at Shanghai, China,
today, according to a cablegram received
ky Kearon. Daniel & Co. of th's City from
their Shanghai office.
The cablegram says: "Rioting by coolie
ciassos. Business suspended. Two police
stations burned. About twenty Chinesi
killed, few foreigners Injured. Marine vol
unteers restoring order. Further trouble
and fires anticipated tonight."
American Vice Consul Injured.
Special Cablegram to The Star.
SHANGHAI, December 18.?There was In
cipient rioting here today, organized by the
leaders of the anti-foreign boycott.
The German consul was stoned by the
rioters, and the American vice consul was
injured. The foreign warships are landing
men, and the volunteers have been called
out. Chinese shops have been closud.
The State Department has been Informed
that a dangerous condition exists in Shang
hai, growing out of the strike there and of
a conflict between 'the international mixed
court and the municipal authorities. There
has been much rioting and two foreign??
have been killed. A naval force, supposedly
from the British squadron at that port, has
been landed and Is guarding the consulates*
and foreign settlements. Two United States
cruisers are on their way to Shanghai.
The State Department's information of
these events was contained in several dis
patches from Shanghai, the last of which
was received about 3 o'clock this morning
from Consul General Rodgers. It Is gath
ered that the moving cadses for the riots
were the anti-American boycott and a gen
eral feeling of hostility toward foreigners
such a3 preceded the dreaded Boxer upris
ing of 1900. So it appears that If any trade
competitor of the UnJted States did, as was
at one time intimated, secretly encourage
the anti-American 'boycott In the hope of
profiting thereby they have overshot the
mark aud now share in the Chinese feeling
of aversion toward foreigners equally with
Americans.
Mr. Rodgers' statement was th&t all busi
ness was suspended among the Chinese;
that as an Incident to the general strike a
number of foreigners had been assaulted.
Volunteers had been called out, presumably
from the people tn the foreign settlements,
whose efforts at maintaining order were
seconded by English marines. The war
ships In the harbor were cleared for action.
At the time of the sending of the first dis
pntch, probably some time last night, two
Chinese had been killed In the riots and the
United States consul general had telegraph
ed for help from the United States naval
vessels.
A later dispatch from the same source re
ported the continuance of the riotous con
ditions, adding that the police stations had
been burned and a number of people killed,
prcbably about thirty, including some for
Mfrners. No Americans, however, had been
harmed up to that moment, and the streets
were being guarded by the volunteers and
the naval forces. Mr. Rodgers' last word
was that he expected the United States
cruiser Baltimore, which was yesterday at
Chinkiang. about a day's run from Shang
hai, to reach that place tonight.
Promoted by Boycotters.
SHANGHAI, December 18.?The incipient
riot here was promoted by boycotters on
account of an Incident involving the mixed
court. The German consul was stoned and
the American vice consul arid several other
foreigners were attacked and injured.
The Chinese clo?<(*3 their shops when the
rioting began. The local volunteers were
called out to restore order and detachments
of blue Jackets were landed from the war
ships to assist In restoring peace.
Mobs Looting in City.
LONDON, December 18.?A dispatch to
the Evening Standard from Shanghai says:
"During the rioting carriages and motor
cars- were smashed. Mobs are looting In
several parts of the city. There are sounds
of shan' firing in the neighborhood of the
town hall and on the Shanking road, which
bisects the central district of the foreign
settlement."
An Anti-Foreign Boycott.
LONDON, December 18.?A cable dispatch
received by a business house in London this
afternoon said that the anti-foreign boycott
disturbances at Shanghai, which were said
to have resulted in the stoning of the Ger
man consul and the injuring of the Ameri
can vice consul, had been suppressed.
TURNED HOSE ON FIREMEN.
; *
Exciting Time at New York Factory
Fire Today.
NEW YORK, December 18.?Firemen
were forced to turn the hose on their own
comrades in order to save their lives at a
factory fire which did $30,000 damage to
day to a six-story building at 58 Center
street. The fire burned away the three top
floors of the building almost completely,
but did not touch the lower floors. In order
to fight the blaze the firemen carried their
hose up fire escapes till they reached tha
fourth and fifth floors. Six firemen who
were on one of these escapes were sudden
ly exposed to a back draft, which blew the
flames through the windows all about them.
The firemen in the streets below immedi
ately turned the streams of water from
three lines of hose upon the escape where
the imperiled firemen were huddled. The
water saved them, for after the draft sub
sided every member of the party was able
to climb down to safety without assistance.
CHICAGO'S LATEST TBAGEDY.
Victim of Shooting Dead and Young
Woman Dying.
CHICAGO, December 18.?William Nie
mann, Jr., vice president of the William
Niemann Table Company, who was shot
during a quarrel with Miss Luclle -McLeod
in a room In the Empire Hotel Saturday
night, died yesterday without regaining con
sciousness. .
Miss Mcl.eod, who was found with a bul
lef hole In her breast, lies at the point of
death at,the Chicago Emergency Hospital.
If she lives she probably will be paralysed.
It Is the police theory that the man was
shot by the woman in a moment of Jealousy
caused by her discovery that the man, who
had held up the hope of marriage to her for
a year, was about to forsake her and marry
Miss Meta Fiedler.
PHILADELPHIA'S SUBWAY.
New Enterprise Opened to Traffic To
day.
PHILADELPHIA, December 18.?The new
subway under Market street, from 15th to
2Sd, a distance of about a mile, was put in
operation today. During the early hours
every car, both cast and westbound, was
crowded to its capacity. Nearly all of the
cars made the- trtp in two minutes. Many
of those who rode through the subway did
so out of curiosity.
When completed the subway will extend
from the Delaware river on the east to the
Schuylkill river on the west, a distance of
two miles, through the heart of the business
section. It is being built by the Philadel
phia Rapid Transit Company,

Addresses the House on th?
Insurance Scandal.
CONTROL BY THE STATE
RECOMMENDS INCORPORATION IIT
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Young Indiana Representative Male?
His Maiden Speech and is Heartily;
Congratulated by Associates.
With a program of speechmaking until
Thursday, many members of the House left
for their homes Saturday, and the attend
ance today on convening was small.
The canal emergency appropriation bill
was received from the Senate and read.
Mr. Hepburn explained, at the request of
Mr. Williams, that the bonding provision la
the bill was onroltted and that the other
amendments were minor. He moved to send
the bill to conferenae.
Mr. Williams pointed out that the bill still
contained the provision to rcimburso the
treasury the amount appropriated from the
sale of bonds. If that had been omitted he
should have moved to concur In the Senate
amendments.
Mr.' Bartlett (Ga.) said the testimony be
fore the Senate committee had developed
that Mr. Bishop was employed as a presa
agent, at $10,(MX) a year. He wished to
know if the bill contained an amendment
cutting down this salary- The reply was
that the bill contained no such amendments.
An attempt to make the Senate committer
hearing a part of the record was bio.ied,
and the bill sent to conference, with Mr.
Hepburn (Iowa), Payne (N.Y.) and l.:\-lng
ston (Ga.) as conferees.
Remedy for Insurance Evils.
The insurance debate was then begun.
Mr. Frederick Landis (Ind.), being the first
speaker. Mr. Landis was a member of the
last Congress, but made no set speech on
the floor, although ho did good and ef
ficient work just the same.
The fact that Representative Fred l^india
shares with his brother "Charlie" Landis
of the ninth Indiana district, the affection
and regard of the House memtierslilp, was
demonstrated today when Young Landis
took the floor for his maiden effort. Al
most every seat on the republican side waa
filled and many democrats were likewise
In attendance. He was frequently inter
rupted by outbursts of applause and when
he had closed his remarks the republican*
lined up in the aisles and marched by Ida
desk, each one giving the young Indianlan
a congratulatory word ami handclasp.
Mr. Landis proved to lw. an entertaining
and a forceful speaker. He contended tluu
to remedy the insurance evils which have
recently come to light th?rti should be fed
eral supervision of insurance.
Incorporation in the District.
The only way he could think of to attain
this end was to compel all insurance cor
porations to obtain their charters in the
District of Columbia. Then, he said, incor
poration in the District of Columbia under
government supervision would constitute a
guarantee and confidence in the insurance
concerns, now badly shaken, would be re
stored.
The jam in the aisle near Mr. LandlB'
seat became so noisy after the young orator
had taken his seat that Representative But
ler of Pennsylvania, who was in the chair,
asked that "gentlemen in the reception line
will please preserve order."
Widespread Interest in Insurance.
Mr. Landis said there were in this coun
try 10,000,000 policy holders, 20,000.000 pollr
cics and at least 40,000,000 persons inter
ested In insurance. The amount of insur
ance now in force, he said, was tlli.000,
ooo.ooo.
The suggestion, he said, that a lew should
be passed declaring insurance interstate
commerce, confronted the objection of con
stitutionality, and it would take longer to
amend the Constitution than to build a
battleship. He reviewed the time-consum
ing process of gctiing judicial action on
such a law, and skid: ."Time has a fine
'.omernpt for everything except a crisis, and
in her potters field rest the forms of many
impulses more imposing than this."
Then there would be the opposition to
federal control of more than one-fourth of
the states. The benefits of federal control,
Mr. Landis believed, would be accomplished
by the blil he has introduced.
"Subject these corporations to national
supervision," he said, "and the eagle will
keep the vulture from plucking the bodies
of the dead."
Mr. Ames Has a Remedy.
Mr. Butler Ames (Mass.) said he had a
method of federal control of Insurance
which President Roosevelt had indorsed.
It was a code of laws that would embrace
all that is best in the laws of several
states. He claimed his plan would black
list any company which did not do a legit
imate business.
Mr. Underwood (Ala.) discussed immigra
tion, which he said was of mora importance
than the insurance question.
INQUIRY AT ANNAPOLIS.
Board Investigating Illegal Customs
Among Mirshipmem.
Special Dispatch to Tbe Stnr.
ANNAPOLIS. December 18.?The board of
investigation, detailed upon the recommen
dation of Superintendent Sands, resumed
its sessions at the Naval Academy thl?
morning behind closed doors.
It is not generally understood that tills
board was not assembled for the purpose
of Investigating particularly the case of
the hazing of Midshipman Kimbrough, but
was designated before the discovery of that
case and for the purpose of "inquiring into
every illegal custom among the midship
men."
As a matter of fact, this board had noth.
ing to do with the Kimbrough case except
that' the testimony given by him before
it undoubtedly brought on the haling.
The superintendent's recommendation for
the expulsion of Coffin and Van Derveer 1M
not causing anything like as much excite
ment among the midshipmen as is the ap
prehension of what the board may report.
It is known that they are inquiring into
matters which occurred when the present
fiwt class was the third and second class.
It Is the inquiries of this board and not thi
cases of Coffin and Van Derveer whlofc
ha* called forth the midshipmen's threat
thnt they will confess hating in a body.
In regard to this threat It waa said ?n
a semi-official way this morning that the
midshipmen will be welcome to come for
ward and give specific Instances of hutaf
and dismissal would surely follow. No gen
eral confession of hazing, however, would
be allowed. Any united attempt to take
such a stand would be considered a breaca
of discipline, however, and would be putt"
ished accordingly.
Cooper, in whose case hazing Is suspect
ed was released fr<>cn the hospital today.
Kimbrough will be discharged during the
day. It Is thought that they will be called
before the inveetlgiulng boefd.
Midshipman George F. Keene of Howard,
n. I.j a member of the first class, baa been
dropped from the Naval Academy on a?
