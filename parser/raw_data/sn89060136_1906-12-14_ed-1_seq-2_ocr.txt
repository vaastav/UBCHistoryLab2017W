Prize On Him.
HOW HE WILL USE THE CASH.
President’s Cablegram, on Being For
mally Notified of His Selection, Ex
pressing His Gratification and De
claring His Purpose to Endow a
Permanent Fund.
Washington (Special).—President
Roosevelt was notified that the Nobel
Peace Prize has been awarded to
him. He has accepted the high hon
or, and decided that the income from
the cash prize of $40,000 shall be
“devoted to founding at Washington
a permanent industrial peace com
mittee.”
The President was confldentiallly
advised by Chairman Loveland, of
the Nobel committee of the Norwe
gian Parliament, of his selection, not
to be made public until officially an
nouncedin the Storthing Monday.
This action was communicated to the
President in the following message:
Christiania, December 10, 1906.
President Roosevelt, Washington:
Nobel committee today signified
Storthing its decision. Accept our
hearty wishes, expression high es
teem.
(Signed) LOVELAND, Chairman.
Minister Peirce was directed by the
President to read the following mes
sage to the Storthing:
The President’ Cablegram.
I am profoundly' moved and touch
ed by the signal honor shown me
through your body in conferring upon
me the Nobel Peace Prize. There is
no gift I could appreciate more, and
I wish it were in my power to ex
press my gratitude. I thank you for
myself and I thank you on behalf
of the United States, for what I did
I was able to accomplish only as
the representative of the nation of
which, for the time being, I am presi
dent. After much thought I have
-oncluded that the best and most
fitting way to apply the amount of
‘be prize is by using it as a founda
:ion to establish at Washington a
permanent industrial peace commit
tee. The object will be to strive for
better and more equitable relations
among my countrymen who are en
gaged, whether as capitalists or
wage-workers, in industrial and agri
cultural pursuits. This will carry out
the purpose of the founder of the
prize, for in modern life it is as im
portant to work for the cause of just
and righteous peace in the industrial
world as in the world of nations. I
again express to you the assurance
of my deep and lasting gratitude and
appreciation,
t. (Signed)
t THEODORE ROOSEVELT.

pended for bringing together in con
ference at Washington, especially
during the sessions of Congress, rep
resentatives of labor and capital for
the purpose of discussing industrial
problems with the view of arriving

promoting Industrial peace. The
President, with their consent, will
appoint as trustees of the fund the
Chief Justice of 'the United States,
the Secretary of Agriculture, the Sec
retary of Commerce and Labor, . a
repreesntative of labor and a repre
sentative of capital.”
WORSTED IN FISH DEAL.
Britons Admit Americans Drove Good
Bargain In Newfoundland.
London (Special).—Only a few of
the London newspapers comment on
the correspondence between Great
Britain and the United States in the
matter of Newfoundland modus vl
vendi regarding the fisheries ques
tion.
The Tribune says it feels sure that
if anything is possible by bargaining
to free Newfoundland from this on
erous diplomatic legacy, Sir Edward
Grey, secretary for foreign affairs,
will wish to attempt it. The paper
suggests that Great Britain might
perhaps purchase, as a concession,
what it may be difficult to extort as
a right.
The Standard publishes a heated
editorial, in which it complains of
the dictatorial tone of the United
States, declares that the Americans
had all the best of the deal, and asks
when the British government will
realize that it first duty is to its own
people.

SOUTHERN HAS
, ANOTHER WRECK
‘ Two Killed and Four Injured at
Danville.
FLAGMAN BLAMED FOR ACCIDENT.
' Similar to the Disaster at Lawyers
Which Resulted in the Death of Presi
dent Spencer and Six Others—En
gineer Kinney and Brakeman King
Met Instant Death.
Danville, Va. (Special).—Follow
ing close upon the disaster of Law
yer, 57 miles from here, on Thanks
giving Day, which resulted in the
death of President Samuel Spencer,
of the Southern Railway, and six
others, another wreck horror on the
Southern occurred in the railway
yards here early Saturday morning.
Two persons met instant death, an
other was fatally wounded and three
others were injured.
The accident happened about 4
o’clock, when northbound train No.
34, a mixed passenger and Pullman
train of about 10 coaches, crashed
into No. 82, a freight train of 30
cars, which was standing on the
main line. All of the passengers es
caped injury of any consequence,
though all were shaken up.
The list of the dead comprises En
gineer George C. Kinney, of Thomas
ville, N. C., and Brakeman W. B.
King, of Danville, Va. Robert Ford,
the negro fireman, sustained injuries
which will no doubt result in his
death.
The following is a list of the ser
iously injured, who were taken to
the General Hospital here: O. P.
Mull, of Columbia, S. C., flagman;
H. M. Patterson, of Chatham, Va.,
brakeman; Robert Ford, colored,
fireman, and O. O. Mailer, of Wash
ington, postal clerk.
Both of the trains were running
behind time, and the freight train,
after passing the block station, three
miles south of here, was detained
in the yards on account of other
trains. The freight had been stand
ing on the main line for nearly an
hour when No. 34 came around the
curve at a rate of about 25 miles an
hour. The engine plowed through
the caboose of the freight, and like
a giant bull hurled it over its head.
Engineer Kinney stuck to his post
and was instantly killed. Fifty yards
above the scene of the accident the
negro fireman, realizing what was
going to happen, jumped from the
locomotive and landed on the
ground, unconscious.
As soon as the collision occurred
fire followed. Four cars were burn
ed up and other damaged by the
flames. The fire department was
called out, and after several hours
had the flames under control.
Next to the engine on No. 34 was
the postal car, which was demolished,
and a number of clerks in it were
injured. The injured clerks left on a
northbound train, and their injuries
are not regarded as serious.
All of the passengers in the Pull
man and day coaches escaped.
The body of Engineer Kinney was
found pinned under the wrecked en
gine. It was not mangled, and indi
cations showed that he had been
scalded to death by the steam es
caping from the boiler.
The death of W. B. King, who was
on the caboose of the wrecked
freight train, was frightful. King
was learning the business of rail
road brakeman, and his body was
burned to a crisp. Only body
from the legs to the neck was ex
tricated from the wreckage, and this
was merely a pile of ashes and co
agulated blood. The head, arms and
legs were missing, and the ashes
was placed in a mail bag and carried
to an undertaker’s shop.
KILLED BY AN AUTO.
An Aged Italian Woman Dies As She
Predicted.
New York (Special).—ln the par
lor of her little four-room flat, two
flights up in the tenement house at
328 W. Twenty-sixth Street, “Grand
ma” Seraflna Macalsko was laid out
Sunday afternoon to begin her long
sleep. "Grandma.” as everybody in
the neighborhood called her, was
one year less than 90. Until two
days ago she went up and down
stairs and about the neighborhood
as spry as a woman one-third her
age. She had one dread.
“Some day I will try to cross the
street and an automobile will kill
me,” she said often. “In Italy we
had no such things when I was young
and happy, but just before I came
over three years ago, they had them
there, too. Why should men and
women rush like mad. most of
them with nothing much to do when
they get there?”
Friday afternoon she put her
daughter’s baby to sleep and started
out for a short visit to a son nearby.
Just as she got in front of the house,
and about half way across the street,
an electric brougham, running fast,
pulled around the corner and bore
down upon her. She stood still in
her terror. The heavy car hit her
and threw her 15 feet right into the
doorway of the house where she had
lived. She never regained conscious
ness, and died at 10 o’clock Sunday
morning.
“She was never ill a day, and yet
she was killed, as she said, by an
automobile,” said the daughter,
Francesca.
Captain And Crew Rescued.
Nassau, N. P. (Special).—Captain
Fredericksen, of the Norwegian bark
Wellington, his wife and 15 mem
bers of the crew of the vessel, were

ed condition, by the Elder-Dempster
steamer Sokoto, in latitude 35 north,
longitude 65 west. The Wellington
which sailed from Gulfport, Miss.,
November 12, with a cargo of lum
ber for Rosario, Argentina, was
water-logged w’hen deserted. The
Sokoto will take the rescued per
sons to Havana.
AT THE NATION’S CAPITAL
( Some Interesting Happenings Briefly
Told.
t
The Ship Subsidy.
General Grosvenor, chairman of
the House Committee of Merchant
’ Marine and Fisheries and most ar
dent of ship subsidy advocates, took
1 the first step to compromise with the
• opposition, which has hitherto been
. successful in holding up the Senate
, measure in the committee.
’ General Grosvenor announced to
the committee that he had prepared
important amendments to the Senate
Subsidy Bill. It makes clear that the
■ subsidies are to be applied only to
lines from the South Atlantic Coast
, to South American republics, and
from the Pacific Coast to the Orient.
The subsidy for the South African
line is eliminated, also the one for
1 the short line on the Northern Paci
fic to the Canadian Coast.
The committee will meet again
Thursday to consider the Grosvenor
amendments. These propositions in
a degree meet with the objections of
Speaker Cannon and Representative
Watson, of Indiana. The latter pre
vented action on the matter in the
last session. Now he declares that
he will favor a bill providing subsi
dies for South American lines and
not more than two lines to the Philip
pines. Such a proposition, he be
lieves, will pass the House. This is
as far as the Speaker will go, accord
ing to the subsidy authorities.
Transport Reserve Fleet.
With a view to securing an ade
quate transport reserve fleet for the
United States Army, General Hum
phrey, in his annual report, states
that the department might advantag
eously begiven authority of law, to
gether with an adequate appropria
tion, to take options for the charter
of American vessels suitable for
transports, paying therefor a reason
able yearly rate, fixing the charter
price if called into service, and giv
ing the department first right to the
sevice of such vessels when needed.
Looking For A Lumber Trust.
Senator Kittredge wants an inquiry
into the operation of the manufac

of the present high prices of lumber,
and particularly to discover whether
a trust exists.
Meat Bill Amendment.

bill to amend the meat inspection act
by requiring that the cost of inspec

Another amendment requires that the
date of inspection and packing or
canning shall be placed upon each

New Child Labor Law Bill.
Senator Lodge introduced a bill
designed to prevent the employment
of child labor by prohibiting inter
state commerce in any article in the
production of which a child under
14 years of age has been employed
and the prohibition extends to chil
dren under 16 years of age who can
not read and write. The violation
of the law is made a misdemeanor,
punishable by fine of SSOO and im
prisonment for one year.
Senator Beveridge introduced a
bill very similar in its provisions.
Appeals In Criminal Cases.
Chairman Clark, of the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary, was au
thorized by the committee to request
the return to it of the bill passed by
the Senate last session which gives
the government the right of appeal
on questions of law in criminal cases.
This is a measure which the Presi
dent urges as being very necessary
to strengthen the hands of the gov
ernment in the anti-trust cases.
Attacking the Panama Canal pro
ject, Senator Morgan says the United
States was in the shipping business
under the sea flag of a dummy cor
poration.

TERRIBLE FATE OF
FOUR CORNELL MEN
Athletes Risk Lives To Save Their
Comrades.
SEVERAL ARE SEVERELY BURNED.
One of Finest Fraternity Houses in
the World Destroyed The Uni
versity and Town of Ithaca in
Mourning—-Fire Breaks Out Early
in the Morning.
Ithaca, N. Y. (Special).—Cornell
University and the city of Ithaca are
paralyzed by the worst catastrophe
which has ever occurred in this com
munity. By the burning of the Chi
Psi Fraternity lodge at an early hour
in the morning, seven lives were lost,
$200,000 worth of property was de
stroyed and the finest fraternity
house in the world was practically
demolished.
Seven men are killed. Six of them
died almost immediately; the other
lingered until evening.
The dead are:
William Homes Nichols, of Chica
go, 111., a member of the senior class
of Cornell University, and a son of a
wealthy commission merchant in Chi
cago. He was a member of many
clubs and societies and an editor of
the Cornellian, which is the college
annual. A charred body has been
found in the ruins, but it is not yet
known whether it is his or that of
Frederick W. Greele, of East Orange,
N. J., who also perished in the
flames.
Oliver Leßoy Schmuck, of Han
over, Pa., a senior in Cornell Univer
sity, a member of many clubs and
very popular among his classmates.
He died in the Cornell Infirmary
within a few hours after the death of
his roommate, Nichols.
Frederick W. Greele, of East Or
ange, N. J., a member of the fresh
man class. His body has not yet
been recovered.
James McCutcheon, of Pittsburg,
Pa., a member of the sophomore
class, substitute halfback on the Cor
nell football team and very popular
among his classmates.
The city of Ithaca has lost three
gallant firemen —Alfred C. Robinson,
an attorney and a member of the vol
unteer fire department; John Rum
sey, son of a prominent hardware
merchant and a member of the vol
unteer fire company, and Estey J.
Landon, foreman of the Empire State
Furnishing Company and a member
of the volunteer fire department. All
of these men were killed by the fall
ing of the north wall of the building
while they were engaged in the act
of stretching a hose on that side.
Just how the fire started will pro
bably remain a mystery, but at 3.30
A. M., S. S. Decamp, of New York
City, a sophomore of Cornell and a
member of the Chi Psi Fraternity,
was awakened by the smell of smoke.
He rushed to the door of his room,.but
found his escape cut off. Running
to the window, he slid down the
vines and reached the ground in safe
ty. He ran to the nearby fraternity
houses and sent out the alarm. It
was fully 30 minutes after the fire
had started before the department
reached the scene. The campus fire
facilities were utterly inadequate,
and it remained for the city com
panies to make an attempt to check
the flames, but it was too late.
DEATH WIPES OUT FAMILY.
Demise Of Father And Four Children
Followed By Mother.
Chicago (Special). Mrs. Rose
Vrzal, of 153 West One Hundred and
Fifty-eighth Street committed sui
cide because, it is believed, of ru
mors circulated regarding the num
erous deaths in her immediate fami
ly within the last ten months. Her
husband, Martin Vrzal, died, and
then, within nine months, her four
children died, the cause of each
death being given by the attending
physician as “stomach trouble.”
An anonymous telephone message
was sent to the peliee department
saying it was advisable that an in
vestigation be made, as all the mem
bers of the family were insured a
short time before death. An investi
gation was commenced, but it de
veloped nothing definite. It is be
lieved by the police that either de
spondency over the deaths of her
family or dread of the investigation
caused Mrs. Vrzal to take her life.
Late on the strength of statements
made by Mrs. Emma Niemann, daugh
ter of Mr. Vrzal, the police arrested
Hermann Billeck, said to be a fortune
teller and hypnotist
ENTOMBED MINERS RESCUED.
Carelessness Had Caused Explosion
Of A Lot Of Dynamite.
Houghton, Mich. (Special) .—Four
teen boxes of dynamite exploded in
the Quincy Mine, cutting off from
escape over 40 miners who had gone
down the shaft before the explosion
occurred. Rescuing parties believed
them dead until they were found in
a sheltering level, where they had
fled after the explosion.
One man, William Gogin, was
blown to pieces, and three others
were wounded. Over a score of
miners were half-suffocated from
smoke and were resuscitated with
much difficulty.
A careless miner let fall some
burning grease in a powder box and
the explosion followed.
A Battle At Leyte.
Manila (By Cable). —A column of
constabulary troops encountered a
band of Pulajanes between La Paz
and Terragona, on the Island of
Leyte, December 5. In the battle
that followed four soldiers were kill
ed and eight were wounded. Among
the wounded was Lieut. Ralph P.
Yates, Jr. His wounds are not seri
’ ous. Thirty Pulajanes were killed
and many were wounded and cap
tured. No details of the fight have
been received.
EXPLOSION IN A FACTORY TOWlf
| Eleven Persons Hurt, Fourteen Build*
ings Burned.
Lynn, Mass. (Special).—The ex*
plosion of- a boiler in the four-story
factory building of the P. J. Harney
Shoe Manufacturing Company, on
Alley Street, and the fire which im
mediately followed destroyed 14
buildings in the West, Lynn manufac
turing district, causing a total loss
estimated at about $520,000.
Eleven persons were injured, one.
Miss Celia Tradenburg, an operative
in one of the burned factories, being
in a critical condition at a hospital.
In addition to the direct loss the
shoe manufacturers will suffer se
verely from the interruption to their
Christmas business.
The properties destroyed and dam
aged are:
P. J. Harney Shoe Company.
Tufts & Friedman Shoe Company.
H. P. Hood Creamery.
Boston and Maine West Lynn Rail
road Station.
Jacobs Leather Stock Company.
M. J. Worthley Shoe Company.
Eight dwellings.
The explosion occurred just before
7 o’clock, when the employes were
assembling at their benches. There
was a roar and the building, a five
story wooden structure, was torn apart
heavy machinery dropping from floor
|to floor. Almost immediately the ,
ruins took fire.
Fortunately for those in the build
ing. or a majority of them, the stair
ways held for the most part, as did
the fire-escapes, and to this fact the
absence of a large loss of life is due.
In the other factories nearby the ef
fect of the explosion was felt, win
dows being smashed and holes torn
in the walls. The Boston and Maine
station, immediately across the rail
road tracks, was wrecked. Debris
from the Harney building piled on
the track 10 feev high and blocked
all traffic over the Eastern division.
The scene of disaster in West
Lynn bordering on Charles and Alley
Streets was well fitted for a big fire,
and the weather conditions—a high
southwest wind and hard going—
were also against the firemen. The
district is the newer factory section
of the town, and dates back to the
great fire of November
when, because of the passage of the
fire limit law, cheaper factories than
brick were sought for, as well as
cheaper land. The factories were
built close together, and to a great
extent filled with inflammable ma
terial.
FIGHT AT BEAUTY CONTEST.
Free-For-All Fight In Pennsylvania
District School.
Washington, Pa. (Special).—East
Finley township, 10 miles from this
city is in a turmoil over a free-for-all
fight in the district school during a
beauty contest and as a result many
residnets of the township are carry
ing bruises. The trouble was started
when Samuel Teegarden and John
Sampson, who were buying votes for
the leading contestants in the beauty
contest, were informed that they
were $3 in arrears in the payment of
the votes, and all votes cast after
their money had become exhausted
would be thrown out, Teegarden and
Sampson are said to have resented
this action and endeavored lo destroy
the ballot box. A general firjit fol
lowed, in which the lights in the
schoolhouse were put out. Many girls
and women were trampled upon, but
none were seriously injured. War
rants have been issued for the arrest
of all involved in the fight.
ITALY TO ADMIT U. S. MEATS.
Will Accept Government Stamp As
Sufficient.
Washington (Special). Restric
tions upon the entrance into Italy
of American pork products have been
removed by the Italian Government.
Heretofore Italy, in common with
