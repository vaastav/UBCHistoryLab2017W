TIIE INDIANAPOLIS JOURNAL, EH I DAT, DECEMBER 7. 18S8.
PROCEEDINGS OF. CONGRESS
The Senate Publicly Discusses the Man
ner of Receiving Electoral Returns,
And Continnes the Work of Reading and
Amending the Tariff Hill Opening of the
House Debate on the Direct Tax Bill.
Washington, Dee. 6. In the Senate, to-day,
statement from the Director of the Mint, In
response to Senator Stewart's resolution of last
session, as to the amount cf eilrer bullion of
fered monthly to the gorernineat sines 1578,
was presented and ordered printed.
A communication from the Secretary of State,
with a certified copy of the final ascertainment
o! presidential eiectori in Kansas, w&i pre
sented. The presidio? officer asked the opinion of the
Senate (this being an entirely new proceeding)
as to the disposition to be made of the papers
rhether they should be entered in the journal
or placed in tne archives of the Senate. He
added that similar certificates from the States
of Mazyland. North Carolina and Georgia bad
been also transmitted by the Secretary or
State.
After some su?eesticn. the provision of tne
law of February, 1SS7, was read, and was found
to require the Secretary of State to transmit
copies of such certificates to the two houses of
Congress.
Mr. Sherman mored to refer the papers to
the committee on privilege and election, and
called attention to the novelty of the proceed
ing. He expressed the opinion that the proceed
ing is not an infrinsernent of the Constitution,
but -was extra constitutional. The Constitutioa
plainly required each State to provide under its
own laws for the election of presidential elec
tors, and that their action should be certified
to the President of the Senate. He doubted
whether Congress had any authority to require
States to send certificates to the Secretary of
State, but that waa a question for considera
tion. Mr. Edmcnd3 said that it vras a very simple
matter, and that Con cress had, in the law of
3837, limply enlarced the degree of security and
certainty in reeard to the transmittal of these
certificates. It was a' precaution acainst the
loss of papers or other contingencies.
Mr. Hoar suggested that it was alto intended to
cave the matter put on record promptly, so that
there should be no tampering with it under the
stress or political temptation.
Aftev further discussion, the papers were re
ferred to the committee on privileges and elec
tions. Mr. Plumb gave notice that ha would, at an
earlr day, ask the Senate to consider the Des
Motnes' river land bill.
The resolutions for continuing the select commute-.,
on meat products and relations with
Canada wero reported back from tne commit
tee on contingent expenses, and adopted with
amendments.
Numerous bills were introduced and referred,
including the following:
By Mr. Stewart: To open to actual settlers
the abandoned military reservations in Nevada.
By Mr. Manderson: For the establishment of
a national biological laboratory.
By Mr. Blair: To orca'nize government
bureaus of information relating to employments,
occupations, wants, means of livelihoods and
homes.
Mr. Plumb offered a resolution, which was
agreed to, calling on the Secretary of the Treas
ury for information as to the expenditures on
the publie buildings at Wichita, Kan.
The Senate at 1:05 resumed consideration of
the tariff bill, beginning with Schedule B, which
covers earthenware and glassware.
Mr. Plumb called attention to the paragraph
&s to silvered glass (No. 115), and said that sueh
glaes was largely used by furniture manufactur
ers, and was almost entirely of foreign make,
because the silvering of sueh class in the United
States was not durable. The duty, he said,
added two or three dollars to the cost of a bu
reau, and if the artiele was not made here he
did notf ee why the duty should not be reduced.
Mr. Allison did not know why such glass could
cot be properly silvered in the United States,
and suggested that it might be on account of
the duty being too low, it being only equal to 10
per cent, ad valorem. The Senate substitute
does not increase that rate.
No amendment, except as to two fortral
changes of phraseology, was. made to-8rhedu!e
B, and the Senate proceeded to consideration of
Schedule C, relating to metals.
Mr. Plumb called attention to the paragraph
as to beams, cirders and joists; spoke of tho
iron and steel combinations in this country, and
instanced the eases of the covernment buiiding
at Wichita, Kan., which had effected a large
Tsaving by contracting for such work abroad,
and of ' the State-houso of Texas, where the
eating, he had been informed, amonuted to
, $200,000. He moved to amend by reducing the
rate from 1 1-10 cent per pound to S-10 cent.
Mr. McPherson called attention to Schedule
B, and said that, to bis mind, the rates of duties
provided in the Senate bill were an increase on
the existing rates. He believes that the pro
visions, in both bills, to prevent undervaluation
. would result in increasing the protection on
I glass and pottery ware more than 10 per
cent His own State was largely inter
ested in those industries, but he did
sot believe that they needed the amount
of protection proposed. The Mills bill, he
thought, aoeorded to them all the protection
they needed to compete with foreign countries,
althonzh he nicht require some changes of
classification. He reserved the right to offer
some amendments hereafter to the glass and
pottery items.
Mr. Hoar also reserved the right to offer some
amendments to the glassware paragraphs.
Mr. Harris called attention to the fact that the
existing duty on these articles was equivalent
to an ad valorem rate of 102.75 per cent; that
the rate of 6-10 cent per pound, proposed in the
House bill, was equivalent to 49.32 percent;
and that the rate proposed in the Senate substi
tute was equivalent to 90.42 per cent, lie
moved to amend the amendment by fixing the
rate at 6-10 of a cent per pound.
Mr. Allison opposed Mr. Harris's amendment,
saying that it went to the root of the whole iron
and steel schedule. He bad no doubt that if
the present rate of duty were maintained, the
competition would be sufficient, in a very short
time, to break down tho prices.
Mr. Aldrich aljo opposed Mr. Harris's amend
ment, and remarked that if there was any one
item in the House bill more indefensible than
another, it was the rate of six-tenths of a cent
?er pound on structural forms of iron and steel,
'he adoption of the amendment would necessa
rily involve the recommittal of the bill, or its
abandonment. It would certainly be an aban
donment of the protective feature of the bilL
The prices of structural forms of iron and steel
were not excessive now, and the state of affairs
to which the Senator from Kanras referred re
lated to some years back.
Mr. Harris asked whether the Senators from
Iowa and Rhode Island were prepared to main
tain that a duty of over 00 per cent, was neces
sary to enable people in this country to convert
- blooms and billets into joists and beams.
Mr. Reasran advocated the amendment. The
people of the United States, he said, were in
terested in being rescued from the grasp and
oppression of monopolies, but the Senate substi
tute aided the monopolists.
The disecssiou; was continued by Senators
Aldrieh, Harris, Hoar, Butler, Plumb and
Payne, but no vote was taken on the pending
amendments and the bill was laid aside the
procress during the day being about 8 pages.
Mr. Butler introduced a joint resolution pro
posing a constitutional amendment enlarging
the presidential term of ofiice to six years. Laid
on the table.
Mr. Blair asked Mr. Cockrell whether he had
yet reeeired the long-loosed for information
from the War Department in reference to tho
bill for army nurses.
Mr. Cockrell said be had not; that he bad de
spaired of receiving it, and that he would offer
no objection to the consideration of the bill
when regularly reached iu the calendar.
Adjourned till Monday.
Discussing the Direct-Tax IlilL
Washington, Nov. C The speaker stated
that he had received a communication from
Hon. Perry Belmont informing him that he
had sent to the Governor of New York his resig
nation as member of Congress from the First
congressional district of New York. The Clerk
was directed to drop Mr. Belmont's name frcm
the roll of the Hoose.
The resolution for the distribution of the
Presidents message to the appropriate commit
tees was reported from the committee on ways
and means by 31 r. McMillin, of Tennessee, and
adopted by the House, the only debate upon it
being a sarcastic query from Mr. Grosveoor. of
Ohio, as to what portion of the messaze had
been referred to the committee on civil-service
reform, and the reply from Mr. Spinola, of
New York, that that subject would bo referred
to the Chinese.
Tbe order relative to the consideration of the
direct-tax bill was so mod ills J as to make tne
measure a special order fr to-day, Tuesday and
Wednesday next, it being the desire of many
members that an adjournment be taken over
Saturday. Aa effort was made to reach tome
agreement touching the offering and pendency
of amendments, but it proved futile; and, with
out any understanding on this point, the House,
on motion of Mr. Caswell, of Wisconsin, went
into committee of the whole Mr. Springer, of
Illinois, in the chair on the direct-tax bill.
31 r. Caswell explained that the simple purpose
of the till was to refund to the States and indi
viduals who pail the tax that portion of the
direct tax that was collected. After a careful
deliberation, he was able to state that the bill
carried 915.227,032. This did not include the 15
per cent, commission allowed the States or par
ties who paid the tax. The amount to be can
celed, now uncollected, was ?2.5C2,401.
31 r. Oates, of Alabama, said that the first
ground of his opposition to the measure was
that there was no authority conferred upon
Congress by the Constitution to pass the bill or
to make the appropriation provided for. He
contended, not for a strict construction of the
Constitution, but for an observance of it. The
only way the Constitution could be preserred in
its original integrity was for Congtess to keep
carefully and squarely within its grant of power.
When the limitation was disregarded and the
unbridled will of Cougrens substituted for it,
the people no longer had any guarantr of the
rights reserved to the States and people. The
money collected under tne act of 1SGI had been
legally collected and expended for the legal pur
pose of the common defense, and the bill was
therefore a donation unjustified by the Consti
tution. His second objection was that it was
unjust in its provisions. Money collected from
the people could never be returned to those
who paid it; and at thin late day it
was impossible to restore it to those from whom
it was taken. It was urged as a reason fr re
imbursing the states that some ot the States
never paid the tax. If it was the intention to
pass this bill in order to equalize taxation, then
he insisted that Congress should go further and
refund the cotton tax and correct other abuses
more glaring than had ever arisen under the
act of 1SC1. He sent to the Clerk's desk and had
read, for information, a series of amendments
which he propoaod to offer at the proper time.
The first refunds the cotton tax; the second per
mits persons who paid that tax to tring suit in
the Court of Claims to reeorer the amount paid;
the third revives the right of action in thja
Court of Claims under the provisions of the
captured and abandoned property act, and the
fourth directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in
making payment and settlement of the direct
tax. to take into acconnt and set off any amount
duo by any State to the United States under
tho act cf June 23, 1830. to regulate the de
posits cf pu&lic money.2'
31 r. Barnes, of Georgia, said that the purpose
of the billl was to execute a release as to the
tax uncollected and to refund tho tax collected
to those who had paid it. Considered in this
mere statement c! the question, without regard
to constitutional principles, there was an ap
pearance of equity in the scheme. Ho wanted
to call attention to the cotton tax. In 1SG2 a
tax of one-half cent a pound was placed on cot
ton; in 18G4 it was increased to two cents, and
in 1SGG It was further increased to three cents,
and a great bulk of the cotton tax was paid under
this last act. The direct tax of 18G1 was a land
tax, a legal tax, a general tax, a constitutional
tax. laid in accordacco with the forms and roles
prescribed by the Constitution. The tax on cot
ton was a special tax, an illegal tax,
an unconstitutional tax. It was a special
land tax on the cotton lands of the
South. He proceeded to make an elaborate
legal and constitutional argument to show that
the tax on the product of the land was a tax
upon the land itself, and be quoted from decla
rations by the f ramers of the Constitution to
prove that, in their opinion, a direct tax was a
tax upon land and a per capita tax on slaves.
If the labor which gave fruit to the land was to
be taxed as a part of the realty, the conclusion
was irresistible that the product which was the
joint fruit of the land and the labor was a part
of the realty. Land was of no value without its
product, and a tax on tho product was a tax on
the land.
Mr. Caswell inquired what was the distinc
tion between the tax on cotton and the tax on
tobacco.
' Mr. Barres replied that there was no dis
tinction whatever. So far as raw, unmanu
factured tobacco was taxed, the tax was illegal
and unconstitutional. He did not believe that
it had ever been contemplated by the f ramers of
the Constitution that the products of the land
should ever be taxed. It was proposed by the
pending bill to refund the direct tax on account
of certain inequalities, and yet gentlemen re
fused to refund a tax which was clearly an il
legal, unconstitutional and special tax, a tax
imposed on the cotton lands of the South, over
and above the land, tax of 18 51.
31 r. Enloe, of Tennessee, sent to the Clerk's
desk and bad read for information a proposed
amendment refunding the cotton tax. and pro
viding that such an amount as cannot be paid to
the persons who paid the tax shall be turned
over to the school funds of the States interested.
Mr. Kerr, of Iowa, said that one of his ob
jections to the refunding of the cotton tax was
that during the years when the tax was collect
ed the producers received so large a price for
their cotton that the tax was really to their ad
vantage. 31 r. 3Iilliken could seo no analogy between the
cotton tax and the tax which it was now pro
nosed to refund. The cotton tax had teen paid.
There was co default about it. If it fell upon
one section more than upon another, it was be
cause cotton was produced in that section. As
far as the direct tax was concerned, either those
States which failed to obey the law should now
come up and pay the tax, or the States that did
pay it should be reimbursed.
Mr. Stewart, of Georgia, regarded the pending
bill as unwise legislation. Ho suggested that
were there not a surplus in the treasury, the
measure would never have been brought op. It
was one of the great schemes to t.te money
f rpm the treasury and to fix the charge of prod
igality on the Democratic administration. There
was no publie exigency now existing which could
justify Congress in resorting to such unconstitu
tional leei?lation. Nowhere in the letter of the
Constitution, nowhere in its spirit, was there a
word or sentence to justify this vicious legis
lation, which was nakedly and boldly a gift and
donation by the general government. It was
fraught with danger, and as a precedent would
prove pernicious.
An informal recess for about five minutes was
taken, to enable 3lr. Caswell and Mr. Oates to
canvass their respective sides and fiod some
gentlemen who desired to sneak on the measure.
Mr. Caswell was unsuccessful in his search, but
finally Mr. Hooker, of Mississippi, took the
floor in opposition to the bill. He was not sur
prised that no gentleman on the other side was
prepared to give any reason for advocating the
extraordinary proposition to take from the
treasury back taxes paid by the citizens and dis
tribute them among the several States. The
income tax had been repealed years ago. There
were men in the section which had not paid the
direct tax who had not paid the income tax; and
he raised the note of warning that if Congress
passod this bill, it would not be long before it
would be said that in order to equalize taxation
the income tax would have to be refunded to
those who had paid it. If Congress was going to
enter on the work of equalizing taxation, it
ought not to begin with a tax which was consti
tutionally levied and collected; it ought to begin
with that tax which the common consent of
mankind and the judgment of every fair-minded
man coccoded to have been illegally and uncon
stitutionally laid.
Pending further debate, the committee rose
and the House adjourned.
Miss Corson's Chicken Fie.
New England Farmer.
Cut up the chicken and cover with water,
season with salt and pepper, and stew slowly
while the crust is being made. To make the
crust ue either the best lard, white and firm,
or the best butter. Allow half as much short
ening as Hour by weight; that is. half a pound
of flour to a quarter of a pound of butter. Avoid
melting the shortening and heating the pastry
by handling it. Sift the flower; mix it with just
enoozb cold water to make a dough which can
be rolled out without sticking to the bands or
the pastry board. Use a little extra flour in
rolling out the pastry. Boll it out square and
half an inch thick; lar the shortening on it in
rather large slices, leaving a clear margin
around the outer edge of about an inch; fold
this in toward the center, and then double the
pastry together so as to inclose the shortening;
roll and fold the pastry quickly several time?;
each fold makes a fresh layer in the pastry;
work rapidly; do not melt the shortening; bake
the pastry in a rather quick oven and it will be
light and tender.
Either line an earthen dish entirely or only
half way down the sides with the pastry; put in
the stewed chicken and gravy, cover the pie
with a top crust, wetting the two to make them
adhere. Do riot pinch or press the outer edges,
bucause that will destroy the layers, but cut
them sharply of with a keen koifo. Cut several
apertures in the top crust If the top crust is
prettily cut or ornamented with figures of flow
ers and leaves cut from pastry and then brushed
with beaten egg before it is baked, the pie will
be very inviting in appearance. It should be
baked in a moderate oven until the crust is
done. If there is any sign of burning, a large
sheet of thick pacer should be rubbed with bat
ter or lard and laid double over the pie to pro
tect it. Tho pie should bake in less than an
hour, and be served hot in tho baking dish; as
the chicked is already cooted, only the erust
has to be baked, and the more cuickly that is
done tho more palatable will be the pie.
Horses can, of course, stand more exposure In
cold weather than men, but the same kind of ex
posure that produces colds, rheumatism, etc., in
men, will be liable to affect horses in the same
way. It is therefore apparent that warm stables,
good blankets and protection from severe weath
er are aecessarj.
AFFAIRS OF THE RAILWAYS.
The Commission Question.
New York. Dec G. At the meeting of the
joint committee of the trunk lines, to-day, the
following resolutions were adopted:
Whereas, It is asserted and believed that certain
lines in the territory of the johit committee hare re
sumed the payment of commissions for the sale of
Sassenjrer tickets, contrary to the agreement of these
ne, with their competitors: and.
Whereas. It is believed that unless these lines can
be induced to top the payment of commissions other
lines competing with them will, for their own protec
tion, feel obliged to resnma the practice, thus b"ng
ing back upon the railroads of the country all the
evils of the commission svstem from which a l.nre
number of them have "wholly or in part freed
themselves; therefore.
Resolved. That the matter be presented to the ex
ecutive committee, with the earnest recommendation
that they proceed without delav to lay the subject be
fore the managing ofticers of all lines in the territory
of the joint committee supposed to pay commissions,
and endeavor bv every reasonable means to secure
assurances from them that they -will immediately dis
continue and hereafter refrain from such payments.
Whereas, Certain lines competing for the through
business deem it impracticable to secure a fair pro
portion of the traffic at current rates; therefore,
Resolved that wo recommend that the managing
officers take np the question of differential fares,
with a view of affording such Hr.es opportunity to
secure a reasonable proportion of the through busi
ness, and thus remove th motive of commissioa
paying or other irreglarities.
Could and the A., T. & S. F.
Boston', Dec. C On inquiry at the headquar
ters of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Rail
road Company, concerning the rumor that 3Ir.
Gould had gained control of the company's road.
Secretary 3Ianchester stated, positively, that
nothing whatever was known of the matter to
the Atchison people hero; that various rumors
to this effect were known to have been floating
about, but those who were in a position to know
eay that, though considerable stock has been
recently purchased in New York, there is noth
ing whatever to show that Jay Gould, or anyone
in his interest, was a purchaser, and there was
no foundation for the rumor.
New Yokk, Dec. 6. In regard to the report
that Jay Gould had obtained a controlling in
terest in tho Atchison. Topeka & Santa Fe rail
road, a gentleman connected with 31 r. Gould s
ofiice said, to-night:
"I have heard it at intervals during the past
month. It is my experience that very few peo
ple will know who controls the road until the
books are closed."
Itates to lie Restored.
New York, Dec C President Chauncey M.
Depew to-night denied the report that a con
ference was held to-day, with reference to the
restoration of west-bound freight rates. Ho
added, however, that west-bound rates would
soon be restored, and that, in all probability,
notice of the change would be sent out within a
week. "I have seen all but one of the presi
dents." said 3Ir. Depew, "and all are in favor of
restoring the rates. We are entirely harmoni
ous, and east-and-west matters were never in
better condition. Whatever irregularities may
have been committed have not been committed
with their approval. The ten days' notice re
quired by law will, of course, be given, and
the differentials will be maintained as hereto
fore." Personal, Local and State Notes.
II. W. Hibbard, general freight agent of tho
Yandalia, is in the city on official business.
J. J. Henderson, general agent cf the Adams
Express Company at this point, is seriously ill
again.
One road yesterday had calls for ever eight
hundred cars to load with corn at points on
its own line, and could furnish but 123 cars.
The transfers over the Belt road, on Wednes
day, reached 1.9G0 ears, and yesterday 2.000
cars. All effects of the strike have passed off.
Austin Corbin, president of the Ohio, Indiana
& Western and a dozen other railroad, has
purchased the fine residence of James Gordon
Bennett in New York city.
The east-bound tonnage out of St. Louis over
the Yandalia, this year, it is stated officially, is
largely in excess of that of any year since the
road was opened for business.
S. P. Pierson, vice-chairman of the Trunk
line Association, has been elected chairman of
the New York State Passenger Agents' Associa
tion, vice 1. S. Emery, resigned.
From all quarters comes up the cry of a
scarcity of cars, and the present condition of
things promises to exist until . aftar.ths Ilta,
when the advance In rates takes effect.
William Leland, of the Lake Shore road, has
been appointed traveling freight agent of the
C, B. & Q. road, with headquarters at Cleve
land. The position is a newly created one.
Several of the Western roads which have, in
the past, been in the habit of paying commis
sions to scalpers on any tickets they may sell,
will, on Jan. 1, cut loose entirely from scalpers.
General Passenger Agent 3Iartin, of the Bee
line, says that be has a mileage book which will
be used on the Bee-line next year, which it will
be quite difficult for the scalpers to use in any
manner.
The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe people have
made a move in the right direction by taking off
the ticket collectors on their passenger trains
and advancing the pay of the conductors
$15 per month.
General Manajer Greene, of tho C, I.. St. L.
& ;., was in the city yesterday on official busi
ness. Ho says that the volume of trade on the
line at th i present time seems to be limited only
by the cars which it can command.
The Wabash road has several fine mogul en
gines, or ten-wheelers, which were built to haul
their fast stock trains. They are now using
these engines on their heavy fast passenger
trains, and they are performing very satisfact
orily. The action of the C, B. &. Q., theC. & N.
W. and the C. & A. roads in refusing to enter
the Southwestern plan mixes things worse than
ever, and indications are that during the winter
low freight rates are to rule in the territory
they cover.
Tho Lake Shore and the Nickel-plate roads
have advanea the pay of their switchmen. at
Cleveland voluntarily, and they are now paid
the same as the switchmen at Indianapolis, $G0
and $G5 for the day men, and $70 and and $75
for the night men.
The C, II. & D. people are using the heavy
passenger engine No. 123 hauling freight trains.
The engine falls short of expectations as a pas
senger engine, while engine No. 129, of the same
build, is considered ono of the best passenger
engines in the West.
The Stockholder says that the worst enemies
which the Southwest plan had were the Chicago
& Northwestern, which encouraged the scheme
in its incipiency and then sat down on it, and
tho Chicago & Alton, which betrayed the con
fidence of its associates.
The idea is steadilv gaining friends that if
the management of the Western roads was con
centrated through the deposit of the controlling
interest in the stock, enough money could be
saved to place every important Western line on
a solvent dividend-paying basis.
It is stated that there is not a road in the
country on which the passenger conductors are
so well paid as on the Cincinnati, Hamilton &
Dayton lines, and since such good wages have
bean paid the company has had no occasion to
discharge a conductor for dishonesty.
The Cincinnati Times-Star says that the high
taxes of Cincinnati are driving capital and man
ufacturers outside of that city, and the local
railroad stocks, such as those of the C, I,
St. L. & C. and tho C, H. & D., are turned
over to foreign mvesters to escape taxation.
N. E. Springteen, who has represented the
Erie road in Michigan for some years, has re
signed, and the duties of his position, after Jan.
1, will be looked after by F. 31, Caldwell. The
Erie shows a disposition to cut down the ex
penses of its passenger department in all quar
ters. The freight men have adopted the old plan of
the passenger men to secure business by paying
a rebate. A freight man drops in on a shipper
who he knows has some business to forward,
and bets him ?3 a car that he will not forward
the'freight over the line he, the freight man,
represents. The shipper takes the hint, ships
over the line and gets a five-dollar bill as a re
bate on every car.
The Corbins and Maxwells, who control the
Philadelphia & Reading, the Jersey Central and
Lehigh Navigation companies, have, this week,
secured control of the Lehigh & Hudson River
road. This will give there roads a short route
East by the way of the bridge now in process of
construction over the Hndeon river at Pough
keepsie. Mr. Corbin and the two 3Iaxwells
have been elected as directors of the Lehigh &
Hndson River road.
Thu day that the Yanderbilt lines cut west
bound rates, the stockholders of the New York
Central lost $2,012,130 in the market values of
their holdings in a day, those of the Lake bhore
$1,073,000. of 31ichigan Central $CG2.146, of Can
ada Southern, &37.oG0, and cf Northwestern
$1,241,100. an aggregate of $G.13t,G32 for these
five Vanderbil- properties alone, to say nothing
ot the depreciation in the shares of the Penn
sylvania, Reading, Erie and other prominent
companies.
The 3Iobile & OMo road has become a very
valuable feeder for the eastern lines out of St
Louis, and the business is growing with a re
markable rapidity. In the year 1887 the M. &
U brought into St. Louis only 20,000 bales of
cotton; this year it will bring in fully 80,000
hale?, and freight of other classes shows equally
baodsome gams. The Yandalia, the I. & St.
L., the Wabash, and O. & 31. roads are turning
a good deal ot Southern and Southwestern busi
ness over to the M. & O., in return.
Miscellaneous Items.
The Baltimore fc Ohio has cut passenger rates
from Chicago to Buffalo 75 cents.
The Wagner Pa!ace-car Company, in the year
closing Oet. 31. earned $2,595,209 gross, and
$0.10,204 net.
The story has been rovived that a railroad
bridge is to be built across the Mississippi river
nine miles above New Orleans.
The Argentine Republic has placed an order
with the Baldwin locomotive-works for thirty
locomotives, early 1SS9 delivery.
The Chicago, Milwaukee Ss St. Paul road
earned in November. $2,015,000, a decrease aa
compared wiih the earnings of November, 1837,
of $23,2131
President Adams, of the Union Pacific, says
that the company desires a tide-water line, but
the time to secure it to advantage has not yet
been reached.
Tho Northern Pacific is still rushed with busi
ness and is steadily increasing it equipment.
It is now receivir g 2,000 new freight cars and
sixty-eight locomotives.
The Chicago. Burlington & Northern, for the
first time since opened for business, is said last

About Turkeys.
Philadelphia BecorJ.
Although the esgle only is recognized as our
national bird, yet the turkey holds the first
place among birds in the estimation of the
American people. In no other country is the
turkey grown in such large numbers as here,
and as all the improved varieties originated in
this country, the English and French annually
import large numbers for breeding purposes.
The parent of our domestic turkey is the wild
turkey, and the wild variety is still used for im
parting fresh blood to our domestic breeds in
order to secure vigor and hardiness. The largest
number of turkeys is raised in Kentucky, the
blue-grass section being as well adapted for the
production of superior turkeys as of horses.
There are six recognized breeds of turkeys
the bronze, Narragansett, white, black, buff
and slate. The former is the largest, and can
be made to attain the weight of forty-five
pounds when two years old, while yearling
males often exceed twenty-five pounds. The
Narragansett is nearly as large, but not as
numerous. The others are smaller, deriving
their names from the color of their plumage.
Not over one-fourth of the turkeys batched ever
reach maturity, as they are very lender when
young and quickly succumb to exposure. Lice
are their great enemies, especially when the
young ones are hatched by hens instead of by
the female turkey. After they reach the age of
three months they are then very hardy, and
require bat little care. To be successful with
turkeys they should have full liberty to roam at
will, as they will not bear confinement. They
are excellent foragers, however, and destroy
hundreds of insects, and also feed upon certain
grasses and tender herbage.
The turkey can be made fat in a week or ten
days. In faet, if the bird is confined over ten
days it will loose weight, owing to its aversion
to confinement. The coop for the purpose should
be large, and the food should be given four
times a day. to consist of a variety, but corn
should be fed liberally. If a flock of turkeys
are to bo made fat they may be fod all the corn
they can eat three times a week. The small
turkeys (not exceeding twelve pounds) are in de
mand more than the very large 6izes, as they
aro more suitable for small families, and especi
ally by the working classes. The fat turkey,
however, always commands a high price per
pound, irrespective of weight, as quality is an
important factor. Considering the small amout
of labor required in raising turkeys they pay
well, despite the large mortality among them
when young.
The estimated loss to the cotton, apple and
potato srops from insects is $40,000,000. Yet
the farmers tako no precaution to protect the
birds. Every bird killed adds just the work it
would perform to the labor of tho farmer, who
conseacently has a greater number of insects
to destroy.
Thero is no dodging the fact that the Ameri
can arbor vita) is the best all-around tree for an
evergreen hedge. Its hardiness, density ob
tained by shearing, and its rapid growth alone
recommends it for the general-purpose hedge
above all coniferous competitors.
