losing saloons to the fact that "gal-

Farmers' Meeting'.
The State Board of Agriculture,
organized by the State tor the pro
motion of agriculture, will hold a
Farmeis1 meeting at Laddonia, Wed
nesday, December 15, which will
contiuue in their sessions at 10, '2 and
7 o'clock. Practical farm talks on
stock breeding, feeding, how to farm
successfully, crop growth, diseases
of animals, and othei such practical
questions will be discussed.
Dr. Paul Paquin, State Veterina
rian aud professor of eterinary
Science at the Agricultural College
will advise, as a part of his presenta
tion of the subiect of Animal
Diseases, free of charge, regarding
any diseased animals that may be
brought to the door of the hall.
Farmers are invited to bring in, for
examination, any farm products or
material of merit, and join in the
discuss'ons of the meetings.
ivtp ise parties are not so numer
ous as of yore, and kissing games
are not so popular as dancing. Their
indulgence is rare, but at one, the
junior female element insisted on be
ing permitted lo show their brethren
something new. They had founded a
new order, it was explained, and
wished to initiate the hove into its
mysteries. They took possession of
the front parlor and closed the fold
ing doors, leaving one of their num
ber to guard. The gentlemen found
one of their crowd a beardless
youth, Tom Bolton had disappear
ed, and wondered what had become
of him ; they learned to their sorrow.
The lodge being in readiness for the
reception of candidates, one of the
vouujr men was escorted into the
room. He found four blushing
maidens standing in a row in the cor
uer of the room, with a chair in front
of them.
Upon this he was seated and blind
folded, and then told that one of the
girls would kiss him, if he could
guess her name he would be privileg-
d to repeat the osculation. Of
1 1
course, no tuaae a miserauie iaiiure,
but instead of being allowed to retire
was compelled to occupy a seat on
the opposite side of the room. Just
imagine his feelings when the next
victim had been led in and had been
prepared for the sacrifice, to see the
missing, beardless youth, Tom Bol
ton, rise up ghost-liko from behind
the girls, imprint a good, sound
smack on the uplifted and expectant
lips of the candidate, and then dodge
back to his place of concealment,
One after another the young men
were victimized. The fun of it was,
though, to hear some of them de
mand more than one trial before the
removal of the hoodwinks one, a
well-known physician, Dr. Dedman,
not being content with less than
three kisses. He was enthusiastic
over their sweetness, until the sweet
was turned to gall as he saw the
boy salute his successor on the
throne of mystery.

To the Peo!l of the State of Mbisourt and
I liruuglioui (he I ultra Males:
St. Louis, Missouri, December
6. No. 720 Chestnut Street. The
undersigned Committee on behalf
of the "Price Monument Asso
ciation," by appointment of the
Board of Directors, is charged to
present to you the consideration of a
duty, cherished for years in our
hearts, and held sacred in all our
memories. It is the duty we ac
knowledge and recognize, to erect a
suitable monument in honor of Gen
eral Sterling Pi ice.
At the outset of our address, we
can express the congratulation, that
after delays which could not be
avoided, the hour has come when
every one who holds in grateful re
memurance me virtues ana Heroism
of General Price may take part.
The following statement will ex
plain :
In the month of December last,
the "Price Monument Association"
was organized aud regularly incor
porated under the laws of the State
of Missouri. In the intervening
months there have come to the
ollicers, largely from our own State,
but in scarcely less degree from the
neighboring and distant States and
from the Territories, the most en
couraging words ; in every instance
the expression of an earnest desire
that the great work go forward.
t the Re-union of the Ex-Confed
erate Association of the State of Mis
souri, held at Marshall, on the 31st of
August and 1st of September last, a
public and hearty endorsement of
the movemeut was made by the
thousands of Ex-Confederates then
and there assembled.
On the first Monday of October,
1SS6, according to the requirements
of the Charter, there was an annual
election of officers : and on the 14th
day of October was held a full meet
iug of the official Board. At this
meeting the resolution of action was
adopted, and the appointment of ap
propriate committees to carry out the
purpose of the organization were
made. The Charter provides that
every man, woman or child who sub
scribes and pays the sum of 1 shall
become a member of the Association.
The meeting of the Board provided
that every such subscriber should be
given a Certificate of Membership
bearing, in minature, a portrait of the
great man we propose to honor, and
further resolved that all members of
this association contributing not less
than $3 to the Monument Fund shall
receive a Life Size "Certificate Por
trait" of General Price, size 25x31,
inches, reproduced in colors from the
original oil painting made by the cel
ebrated artist, J. R. Stuart, in 18G8.
The painting shows the General in
full uniform, and is a faithful likeness
as he appeared during the latter part
of his life. The work, has been in
trusted to the Compton Litho. Co.,
of St. Louis, and is now being exe
cuted under the personal supervision
of members of General Price's fami
ly, thereby insuring the only authen
tic and accurate portrait extant ; and
will be to every holder a memorial at
once precious and perpetual. A
Certificate of Membership will ap
pear beneath the portrait (as shown
in the fac simile on the other side of
this) with the name of member beau
tifully engrossed upon it. This Cer
tificate Portrait will be issued to
members only, and will not be for
sale at any price, consequently the
only way it can bo obtained is to be
come a member of the Association.
The Charter further provides for
the selection of Vice-Presidents in
every County of Missouri, and one
for each State and Territorj', with
power to organize Auxiliary Associa
tions. The Board will address itself
at once to the performance of this
duty, and in this it asks the prompt
assistance of prominent Ex-Confederates
in the State of Missouri and else
where. These Vice-Presidents, and
such assistants as they may desig
nate, will be provided with Subscrip
tion books, Certificates of Member
snip, ana with all necessary instruc
tions to carry on the work to
prompt and successful conclusion,
and so, it will be fully equipped
Need we add anything more?
We have known ihe man who more
than a half century ago, emigrated
from his native State of Virginia and
became a citizen of Missouri, a pion-
eer in our great State, then on the
very frontiers of our civilization. We
have known him as a law-maker at
an early age, representing the county
of bis home in the State Legislature.
Forty years ago he was elected a
member of the Lower House of Con
gress, discharging worthily and well
the duties of a National Legislature.
We have seen him resign his seat in
Congress to lead his neighbors in the
Mexican war ; seen him striking the
last blow which culminated in the
victory of that eventful struggle, and
which wrung from our adversary im
perial wealth and breadth of States
and Territories. We have seen bim

miring fellow-citizens to the office of

military abilities, there was added
the badge of a true and honorable
statesmanship.
We have marked the conservative
attitude he held to extremity when
the struggle between the States was
impending, and have seen bim ex
hausting all efforts that a national
patriotism, a love for home and State
could prompt, and at last reluctant
ly but honestly accepting the alterna
tive of war. During four eventful
years he stood by the cause of the
South with a devotion unsurpassed
in the annals of warfare, and with
capabilities which rank him among
the foremost of his equals. He peril
ed everything, and lost all save
honor, and whether or not he receives
the testimonial his countrymen now
propose, his memory will remain in
the hearts and affections of those
who followed him to the end ; follow
ed him through privation and hard
ship, and even to final disaster. He
was the type of a manhood which all
men admire, and he remains to us as
another in the roll of heroes, without
fear and without reproach. In honor
ing the memory of such a man we
honor ourselves.
