JToboily Is Snfe.
It seemB that no man's good name, and no
k corporation Is safe from calumny. It now
' turns out that the auditing committee makes
charges of irregularity In the management of
the late State dispensary. A man that would
make charges against suoh an Institute as the
State dispensary might go off and commit
suicide. If we are to lose confidence In the
late 8tate dispensary, In whom could we put
our trust? The first thing anybody knows- (
m somebody might assail the character of a
blind tiger and dlsporage the purity of hla
goods.
Put np Tour Rifle.
The city council has taken in band the promiscuous
shooting of parlor rifles on the l
streets by boys. This practice Is not only an-'
noylng, It Is very dangerous, and the counoll
will put a stop to It Immediately. The po1
lice have been notified and under a reoent
ordlnanoe a fine of 85 00 will be Imposed for
* every offense. J
