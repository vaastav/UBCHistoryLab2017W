SATURDAY MORNING, DEC. 7, 1878
THE MESSACE.
President Hayes' second annual
transmitted to Congress
message was
Monday. It is not a lengthy doc
ument for a President's message, but.
like the boy's butter, "it is mighty
good what there is of it, and there is
enough of it such as it is. '
After the customary mention that
we are at peace with our neighbors.
abundant harvests are attended
to and it is believed that "general pros
perity is at last within our reach."
The yellow fever epidemic is reviewed
and Congress invited to give quaran

the South is discussed at considerable
length and the re-ords of the elections
in South Carolina, Louisaim and some
Congressional districts in other States
to compel the conclusion that
**?eem
the rights of the colored ^voters have
been over-ridden and their participa
tion in the elections not permitted to
he either'genernl or free." Congress
is asked to look into «his matter, hut
only the mildest measures
mended. Returning Boards] are not
alluded to, as the President no doubt
feels it a too delicate T subject''to dis
cuss. After a review of our foreign
relations the public finances are taken
up, but no financial legislation is
recommended. On the contrary, he
thinks the "welfare of legitimate bus
iness will be best promoted by abstain
ing from all attempts to make radical
changes in the existing financial legis

lightly and several recommendations
of the Secretary of War are appended
After going through with the remain
der of the departments, the President
turns his attention to agriculture and
urges upon the attention of Congress
and the people the importance of an
increase of our agricultual production
and quotes a passage from Washing
ton's eighth annual message. He tells
us that about one-half the population
of the United States are engaged in
agriculture and that the value of the
agricultural products of the country
for the year 1878 is estimated at three
thousand millions of dollars. Our ex
-
ports of agricultural products iu 1877
were flattering, yet, notwithstanding
our advantages of soil, climate and
intercommunication, we import an
nuatty from foreign lands many mil
- n . ,
bons of dollars worth of agricultural
products that we could raise at home.
On agriculture the President is sound,
and his good suggestions under that
head help to make up for his silence
. 1 . » TT ,
on civil service reform. Upon the
whole, the message has little iu it that
any one can object to, hut on many
things that received careful attention
„ „„„„ _ _
a vear ago the .President is now as
° ,
silent as a grmdstone. Perhaps a
year's experience has taught him-(he
value of saying little when he h a s lit
"^ïTtolâÿl^ .he hft^earned more
J . .... . . ,
in oue year than Grant did in eight.
None can object to his condemnation
of election frauds but he should have
directed attention to other sections of
the country as well to the South. The
, „ , , .
message glides along from one head to
another as smoothly as an old time ser
mon and winds up with "District of
Columbia affairs," a subject in which
Traveling on the "iron trail" from
Wilmington to Delmar one gains a
pretty good idea of the Diamond State,
her soil, lie*- productions, the "lay of
her land," her towns and villages and
perhaps, trorn association, some little
about her people ; hut to know Dela
wareans a « Delawareans ; to know
them as a social, hospitable and unos
tentatious people woe needs to çross
the thresholds of their cyiiet, comfort
able homes, where the stranger is al
ways welcome and is soon made to
feel as much at home as though he sat
hy his own fireside. In truth, the
hospitality of Delawareaus is prover
bial, but that is not what your corres
pondent started out to write about.
In the by-ways of our State, lying
beyond the shrill shriek of the loco
motive, are many'quiet, happy, culti
vated and prosperous communities
where the financially solid, though un
pretentious and hospitable Delawarean
may be seen in all his glory. Up and
down the State such communities are
to be found, but it is only of one of
these that we are now going to treat
and that ifl Frederica. It is six miles
from the r railroad at Felton to this
quiet, cozy village—six miles through
a level stretch of pretty farm-lands to
the narrow main street that, after one
or iwo uncomfortable bends, goes
down to the spacious warehouses on
the hanks of the Murderkill, out of
which the grain-ladetied vessels have
sailed for almost a century. Here, six
miles from the bay and six miles from
the "neigh of the iron-horse' we find
a neat, ( we cannot say prettv) quiet,
pleasant and prosperous village ofi
eight hundred inhabitants, who
no one is interested save the President,
Congress, the lobbyists and residents.
The message is hy no means an ag
gressive document; rather, it is as
mild as a hoy's first composition on
temperance, and neither Democrats
nor Republicans will find much in it
to condemn.

would seem to argue that there might
be a lively competition for the trade
that centers here, and the handsome
residences of several of the merchants
show them to be financially well fixed.
Two neat and well stocked drug stores
(one of them presided over by a pleas
aut and communicative gentleman
who believes in enterprise and rail
roads) supply the community with
pills, powders, castor oil, etc. Some
of the buildings here show that they
have passed through many changing
seasons, and there are many evidences
that the village belongs to the long
list of Delaware's early settlements.
Recently,however, it has been improv
ing at quite a healthy rate, among the
recent improvements being a hand
some brick Methodist Church and a
number of commodious dwellings on
the street that leads "toward the
bridge."
Frederica's industrial enterprises are
Here is a phos
a
quite noteworthy
phate factory where many tons of fer
tilizer are annually turned out, a fac
tory for preparing husks for matresses,
a ship-vard where not only old hulls
are put in a seaworthy condition but
where trim and staunch new vessels
built and launched on the bosom
of the Murderkill ;Ybut Fchief among
the enterprises of the village, and per
haps the most important of them all, is
the canning factory of Mr. S. W
Hall, where no less than 570,000 3-lh.
of tamatoes and many thousand
of peaches, corn and apples
put up during the past season.
The whole process of putting up
fruits and vegetables in air-tight caus
is very simple, and, outside of the
manufacture of the enus, requires
very little machinery.
Mr. Hall, as we stepped upon a large
plat form in front of the factory, " is
where the tomatoes are received from
the wagons and weighed, then just
here at the entrance of one wing of
the factory they are poured into scald
after -vliich they are skinned and
cored by women who stand in front of
these long troughs. Next, the water
is carefully strained from them, they
dipped into the cans piled around
the operators ready to receive them
and carefully capped and soldered up.
Now r comes the bath—an immersion in
boiling water. This is done by placing
the caus in large racks and sinking
them in tubs of water—kept constantly
boiling by steam pipes. For tomatoes,
from ten to fifteen minutes is consid
ered long enough for the bath, while
requires about three hours boil

ing.'
After the bath the cans are low
ered to the testing room and carefully
examained by au expert who tan tell
a leaky can just as you would test a
watermelon before pulling it—by a
simple tap. The testor does this with
little stick, and those cans that do
not have the "right ring" are sent to
the soldering room, carefully exam
ined and the leak stopped. Now the
cans are ready for labeling and box
ing,which is done by boys who handle
the cans and labels' like chain light
In the tin room of Mr. Hall's

mutr
factory are to be seen all the most ap
proved machinery for the manufacture
calis - Here the several parts cou
, prising a can are cut out at a single
frow.lnd the soldering done with the
greategt rapidity. The cans are made
up during the winter, and last season
3,000 boxes of tin were used iu this
department. Mr Hall contracts for
his tomatoes in the fall, giving out
about 300 acreB to be p i ante d. Last
season he paid forty cents per hundred
pounds, and as the average crop per
acre * s 10,000 lbs. the reautf will see
that tomatoes pay much better than
as , J - , , . . T .,
cor«'üoes at 40 cents a bushel. Iu the
a height of the season two hundred
hands are employed in the factory
lit- and turn out 31,000 cans of fruit or
vegetables per day The annual clis

t' ac tory must be considerable, and, as
j t m0 etly goes among the farmers and
laboring people, it may be safely said
of that it is put where it-will do the most

This canning factory, an enterprise
of which Frederica is justly proud,
was established by Mr. Hall about six
years ago, and the proprietor, though
putting up other goods, has made a
leader of tomatoes and earned a repu
tation for his goods second to none in
the country. His brands are now to be
fouijd upon almost every grocer's
shelves,and when the can is opened and
the contents poured into a dish they look
and taste like fresh tomatoes from the
vine. The factory stands close by the
j hank of the Murderkill, and the ship

not of special interest in either House.
Senator Blaine made an inquiry into
the subject of equal rights of voters at
elections, and Representative Hood
sharply critized that portion of the
President's message which assumes that
voters in the South were intimidated
at the November election. He called
attention to the fact that there was
intimidation by Government officials
unconstitutional officials—in New V ork
City, and that Mr. Hayes had omitted
to condemn them. Nothing was done

that, unless the radicals precipitate
such investigation, the Potter Commit
tee will, at an early day, undertake
the work. There is, as heretofore said,
a disposition on both sides to evade
the discussion of disturbing questions
until later in the session.
Mr. Thurman stated
truth wheu saying that under our form
of Government there had been and
must ever be two parties one a party
of the people and the other cf class
and privilege Any candid man who
reads the annual ' message of Mr.
Hayes, or tue reports of his Secretaries,
will not fail to see that the party which
is not of the people, but of cläss and
privilege, is the party to which those
gentlemen belong. Even Mr. Schurz,
red republican as he was, and tlieoret
ical Democrat as he thinks he is, in
vents new Federal offices and ask*
Congress to appropriate money
them. The Secretaries of War and
the Navy cling to the old abuses and
the old excrescences. The Attorney
General asks for money to pay
legion of officials unknown
spiritJirJfitter of the Constitution. In
all the messages and reports ordered
printed by Congress yesterday there
is not a suggestion that any superflu
ous officer may be dropped, that any
dollar of money may be saved to the
that the methods of

Government may in any way be sim

ing at a time like this from Seymour,
Bayard, Hendricks, Tilden, Thurman,
and the Cabinet Officers they would
have around them ! To consider this
is to see the difference oetweeu a party
of the people and a party of class and
privilege—between Democracy and
Republicanism.
Secretary Sherman recommends,
and the recommendation deserves con
