I iiim Germany.
Chicago, Dec. 6.—When President
Springer had called the convention of the
National Live Stock association to order
i-Jay he said the program for the day
was one of exceptional interest to cattle- j
men. lc comprised papers from Dr. J. H.
Si-ntMr of New York; Professor Andrew j
K. Soulo of the Tennessee Agricultural j
college, Hon. P. E. Wanvu of Wyoming;
A. P. liortmus, state engineer of Utah
and Colonel G. VV. Simpson of Texas. Mr.
Soule's paper was the first one heard by
the convention and told of the cattle busi
ness in the Middle south. He presented
statistics to show that the potential stock
productive capacity of the middle south
would soon become an important matter
to the stockmen of the United States.
To lie Asked of C'oiiKreNK.
Senator aWrren of Wyoming read a
paper in which he enumerated needs which
ho said s-trlemen would present to con-
First, defeat of the Grout oleo bill; second,
legislation to prevent deceit, and fraud in
manufactured articles; third, legislation ta
provide for .tho opening of forest reservations
where practicable for live stock grazing;
fourth, legislation providing for taking an j
annual live stock census; fifth, amendments j
to the 'land laws to permit settlers to ex

Debate on Grout Bill.
The recommendation of the executive j
committee that resolutions condemning I
'ho Grout aml-oleo bill be adopted gave
iise to a spirited debate. Leonard Pear
son, of Pennsylvania, speaking for the'
dairy interests who upheld the Grout bill.
led with the plee that with oleo selling
under Its own colors, butter could hold its
own. "You cattlemen," said he, "insist
that the coloring of oleo should be al
lowed, yet you Insist that the wool inter
ests should be protected against shoddy
masquerading as wool."
Former Governor Packard, of lowa,
moved that the whole question be de
ferred, when Judge Cowan rose and said'
that paokers had as much right to color
oleo as dairymen have to color butter.
Judge Cowan brought the speaking to an
end by moving the previous question.
The resolution against the Grout bill was
adopted, but over a good-sized minority.
Paul McCorinick, of Montana, Lo Ful
len, of New Mexico, and W. E. Bolton, of
Oklahoma, spoke of conditions in their
respective states and territories. Henry
Wade, registrar of live stock, of Ontario,
Canada, read a paper on the live stock
business of Canada.
Bills to be urged upon congress to pro
vide for tagging cloth goods to show its
exact composition and to provide for a
classified assessment of cattle were ap
proved by the convention. The committee
was divided over framing a bill providing
for the exchange of public lands, as men
tioned in Senator Warren's paper, and a
minority report referring the matter to
a committee of five to report at the next
meeting was adopted.
Executive committeemen for 1902 were
appointed, including M. B. Gwynn, Idaho;
J. J. Furlong, Minnesota; Paul McCor
mlck, Montana; R. M. Allen, Nebraska;
F. M. Stewart, South Dakota; J. F. Geer,
Washington state.
the: GOVERNOR IS there
Van Sant Glorifies Minnesota Before
a. Hits Crowd.
Aw lurk Sun Special Service
Chicago, Dec. 5. —Samuel R. Van Sant,
governor of Minnesota, is here visiting
the live stock show, accompanied by Dr.
Richter, state veterinarian. He will
visit different points of interest in Chi
cago, and will be the guest of personal
friends here. He would not commit him
self upon the subject whether or not he
would call an extra session of the legis
lature on account of the proposed con
solidation of the roads. Asked about the
president's message to congress. Governor
Van Sant declared that he was still read
ing It and was not prepared to give out
FOOD FACTS.
• How to Properly Feed the Body.
Physicians nowadays realize how neces
sary it is that the food contain the right
elements that the body requires to rebuild
itself, and replace the loss that occurs
each day from activity and energy.
If one lifts an arm, that means the ex
penditure of a small amount of energy,
and the burning up, so to speak, of certain
deposits from the food. This means a cer
tain loss, and this .loss must be made up
each day from food. If the food does
not contain the things required nature
hoists a flag of distress; aches, ails,
sickness of some sort sets in, meaning
that there is something lacking in the
food.
The reason physicians so generally ad
vise the use of Grape-Nuts .Breakfast
Food is that they know from what it is
made and what it contains. The medi
cal journals in various parta of the world
have given the analysis. The famous
"London Lancet" went so far as to make
a very careful analysis by its own chem
ist. Its remarks are worth repeating.
"The preparatory process undoubtedly j
converts the food constituents into a much i
more digestible condition than in the raw j
cereals. Thi3 is evident from the remark
able solubility of the preparation. No less
than one-half of it being soluble In water.
The soluble portion contains chiefly dex
trin and no starch. According to our
analysis the following is the proportion:
Moisture 6.02 per cent.
Mineral matter 2.01 "
Fat 1.60 " "
Proteids 15.00 " "
Soluble Carbohydrates ....49.40 " "
Unaltered carbohydrates..2s.97 " "
The features worthy of note in this
analysis are the excellent proportion of
proteids and mineral matter, and solvable
carbohydrates.
The mineral matter is rich phosphoric
acid. Our analysis shows that it is a nu
trititive of high order, since it contains
the constituents of a complete food in
the right proportions, and in an easily
assimilable state."
Notice the carbohydrate total is about
"5 per cent. These produce energy and
warmth. The phosphoric acid in the min
eral matter comes, as do all of the
other Ingredients, from the field grain,
not one particle being introduced as a
drug.
FTtysicians know that the soft matter in
the brain and nerve centers throughout
the body are made from the elements of
albumen acted upon by phosphate of pot
ash. Albumen is a very common article
in almost every food, but phosphate of
potash does not exist in all foods, nor is
It found in easily digestible form always.
However. ■*> Grape Nuts these elements
exist, and «i£ presented to the body .In
an easily digestible form,- and explain
the reason why users feel the new spring
of life, the brain ana nerve power in
crease, after they have been using Grape-
Nuts for a time. There is a reason for
it. c Th doctors know it, therefore they
prescribe Grape-Nuts
an interview on the subject at this time.
Ho said:
I came down here to attend this great live
stock show, which is a marvel, aud I just
want to "whoop things up" for Minnesota
live stock and for our Minnesota boys. Our
state university's agricultural branch has, I
am pleased to cay, done very well so far at
this exposition. Minnesota is a great state
for live stock, and don't you forget it. We
are getting nearer to the front each year.
Last night closed "Governor's day."
Facing a throng that packed the big pa
vilion, the heads of four of the leading
live stock and farming states of the mid
dle west told how.the farmer is the "back
bone of the nation.".! The four governors
whose addresses brought the fifth day of
the show to a close, were: Van Sant of
Minnesota, Shaw of lowa, Bliss of Michi
gan . and Savage of Nebraska. ' When
Governor Van Sant got the platform the
crowd greeted him as the man who has
opened the fight on the recent combina
tion of railroad interests.
"Hit 'em hard! Give it to the octopus!"
was the cry. But the- governor side
stepped any reference to the anti-cor
poration fight and confined himself to re
citing the glories of Minnesota.

London, Dec. 5. —Tbe chaotic condition
of the liberal party never was more no

tional liberal federation at Derby. A
resolution calling on the government to
announce the terms on which they were
prepared to conclude peace in South
Africa was not passed without a noisy
scene occasioned by differences of opin

Lord Milner. Mr. Emmott objected to
words declaring it essential with a view
to the conclusion of peace that a special
commissioner should be dispatched to
South Africa. Cheers and groans greeted
his statement that he would accept no
vote of censure of Lord Milner, and the
chairman was compelled to intervene to
restore order.

CASH AND SUPPLY DRAINS STOP
Radical Action That May Contribute
Largely to the (/lowing
* of the War <
Manila; Dee. s.—General Chaff cc has Is
sued orders'for closing" all ports' in the
Laguna and Batangas provinces. The
quartermasters there will cease paying
rents' to the Filipinos for buildings' used
for military purposes, as it is known that
a large proportion of the money finds its
vay to the insurgents In the shape of
contributions and General Chatfee intends
that no more government funds shall find
their way into the hands of the enemy.
The reason for closing the ports is that
too many supplies are found to be getting
into the possession of the Insurgents.
ACJIIXALDO .NOT t MIX Kit
Government ICdut'tttionul Method !■
Ueulared Faulty.
Sun Francisco, Dec. v.Congressman
Edgar Weeks of Michigan, who arrived
from Manila on the transport Hancock,
when asked about conditions in the Philip
pines, said:
1 saw Aguinaldo and spent half a day with
him. He is not an intelligent man, and, I
think, feels that he is inferior in intellect
to the Americans. He seems to me not clever,
but cunning. The general opinion among the
iailitary men is that Aguinaldo should be
allowed to escape. He is a dead issue and
is no longer a menace to the Uuited States.
It is supposed that he does not want to run
away, as he would at once be assassinated by
the friends of General Luna, whom he or
dered to be killed.
The new method of educating the natives,
us adopted by this government, is wrong.
Refined, handsome young ladies from Vas
sar and other colleges went down to the
Philippines to educate these natives. They
have had to put up with all kinds of priva
tions and to eat native food, and in Some
places their live 3 have been in danger. I
think this is entirely unnecessary. In place
of thesa young ladles, discharged soldiers,
of education, who had become acclimated,
should bo appointed and the young ladies
should be sent home.
VITAL TO WORKERS
Problems Confront American Feder-
ation of Labor.
NANY INTERNAL DISSENSIONS
Delicate Queationit to Be Settled at
the Annual Convention Which
Opened To-day.
Scranton, Pa., Dec. 6.—The twenty-first
annual convention of the American Fede
ration of Labor was called to order this
morning by President Samuel Gompers
and the greatest labor convention that
probably has ever 'been held in this coun
try was under way. It is estimated that
275 delegates are in attendance from this
country and Europe representing 1,503,000
working people.
The credentials committee has several
complaints to consider. Chief among
these protests is that of United Hatters of
North America againsta the seating of
Gaibriel Joseph, cigarmaker, the delegates
sent by the United Labor League of Phil
adelpihia. He is being protested on the
ground that the United Labor League per
mits the Philadelphia Hat Makers Union
to retain its membership, although it has
been suspended by the national organi
zation. Protests have been filed against
the representative of the Richmond Cen
tral Labor Union by some of the colored
delegates who assert that that organiza
ltno has discriminated against colored
working people by refusing to admit the
colored trade unions to membership. A
protest has been filed against seating tho
representative of the Chicago Central
Labor Union.
The convention will be asked to take ac
tion on many disputes between trades
that are affiliated with the federation. The
International Association of Machinists
has demanded that the charter of the
English Amalgamated Society of Engi
neers, machinists, etc., be annulled. It ia
said the brotherhood of carpenters will
demand the annulment of the charter of
the Amalgamated Woodworkers' union.
There will be a general contest over the
question of trade autonomy. The larger
unions will insist upon right to form
mixed unions, under their own control,
whore the workers in other trades are
employed.

Washington, line. o. —Census Director
Merrlam to-day gavo out a preliminary

In the cities of Minneapolis, St. Paul and
Duluth. It shows that in the state there
have been substantial increases since
lfcliu in all items reported. In Minneapolis
there was a 13 per cent decrease in num
ber of establishments, due, it is said, to
the fact that a number of Brma in build
ing trades went out of business after
the boom times of 1890 and previous
years. The value of products in Minne
apolis, however, showed the substantial
increase of 35.1 per cent; capful em

TAWNEY^DEMURS
Thinks the Senate Is Encroaching
I pon House Prerogative.
Washington, Dec. 5. —Members of the
house of representatives are showing
some opposition to the origination of
Philippine revenue legislation in the sen
ate and in particular to Senator Lodge's
bill, which deals with this subject. Rep
resentative Tawney of Minnesota
holds that the constitutional
provision "that all bills for raising rev
enue shall originate in the house of rep
resentatives" applies to Philippines meas
ures; and the Minnesota member will op
pose any senate bill on the subject as an
invasion of the prerogatives of the house.
Mr. Chamberlain, the commissioner on
navigation, has Issued a circular in which
collectors of customs throughout the
United States are directed to exempt ves
sels from the Philippines islands arriving
In this country from tonnage tax levied
under authority of the act of 1886. Ves
sels arriving from foreign ports via the
Philippines or visiting foreign ports while
on a voyage from the Philippines to the
United States are still subject to the tax.
ALUANcTiREWING
Will the Rock Island and Atchison
Get Together*
Special to The Journal.
New York, Dec. s.—The main reason for
the recent advance in Rock Island rail
road stock is found in the fact that there
has been talk between the principals of
an alliance between the Rock Island and
Atchison. The Rock Island is understood
to have intimated its intention to seek an
outlet to the Pacific coast and Incidentally
to compete more vigorously with the
Atchison on the completion of its south
western extension. The Atchison is un
derstood to have suggested closer rela
tions between the two properties as the
best way of making the most of their in
dependent position and the idea is be
lieved to have commended itself to the
Rock Island. The Atchison would gain
materially by an aliance of this character
with the Rock Island, especially in view
of its being now the only independent
transcontinental line.

TAWNEY WAS LEFTI
Rivalry With McCleary in Intro
ducing Oleo Bills.
S.D. MEASURES BEFORE CONGRESS
Senator Cullom Emphasizes the Pop
ular Belief Regarding Reci
procity Treaties.
From The Journal liter Kooin 46, fast
Building, Washington. ••.•r*T>:
Washington, Dec. s.— There has been a
pleasant rivalry between Representatives
Tawney and McCleary, of the Minne
sota delegation, as to who should get the
post of honor with a' bill -fixing a tax of
10 cents a pound on oleo. colored as but
ter. McCleary came out ahead, as was
stated in, these dispatches on Monday.
He arranged the matter last spring, after
the adjournment, of congress, while Taw
ney took the matter up only on Friday of
last week, too late to do anything. It
is uncertain which bill the committee on
agriculture will report or whether it
will report either; it may write a bill of
its own; but in some form the old Orout
bill of last session seems sure to be
come a law at this session.
This Is No News.
Senator Culloni doubts whether there
can be any reciprocity treaty ratification
at this session of congress. He says that
the senate committee on foreign relations
will consider all of the treaties carefully,
and that It may report several of them fa
vorably; but there is still a long road
ahead before favorable action can be se
cured in the senate. The senator admits
frankly that there are too many special
interests at stake. This probably means
no ratification.
South Dakota Concerns.
The bill to provide free homes on the
old Fort Randall military reservation, in
South Dakota, was introduced in the last
congress, but did not get out of the com
mittee on public lands. Judge Lacey, of
lowa, an Influential member of the com
mittee, opposed the bill in the last con
gress, holding that the lands were too
valuable to be placed under the free
homes law. But the friends of the bill
will ureg it again in this congress, and,
they hope, with a better chance for suc
cess.
The public building bill for Pierre, S. D.,
was defeated in the last congress because
no public buildings bill was passed. There
will probably be such a bill in the pres
ent session, and so Pierre stands a good
chance of getting something. It may not
be $200,000, but it will be enough to pro
vide a very acceptable place for the trans
action of the government's business.
John H. McLaughlin was custodian of
buildings at old Fort Randall before
Its abandonment. He continued to care
for the buildings foj a long time while the
abandonment was being discussed, and
afterwards, but received no pay for this
work. He put in a claim for $2,680 in the
last congress, and the committee recom
mended that he be paid $1,000. The bill
did not reach a vote. It was introduced
last Monday by Representative Burke, for
the full amount, and another effort will
be made to get it through.
President Favors Statehood.
Bernard S. Rodey, republican, delegate
from New Mexico, called on the president
to express his .great disappointment,
which he says other westerners share, in
the president's failure to recommend ad
mission to statehood of New Mexico and
Oklahoma. Mr. Roosevelt replied that he
passed over this subject because of the
conflicting opinions in Oklahoma as to
whether Indian Territory should be joined
to it before admission to the union and
other unsettled questions in that quarter.
He told Delegate Rodey that he was firm
ly of opinion that New Mexico should be
admitted.

TWINE WILL BE CHEAPER
IF MANILA HEMP COMES IX FREE
"Fourteen Diamond Rings" Decision
Means It Will UaleM Con
gress Takes Action.
There is apparently little connection be
tween diamond rings and manlla hemp,
I but the recent decision of the supreme
| court admits all articles from the Philip
| pines to the United States duty free, and
Minnesota Imports large quantities of
hemp fiber every year to be made into
binding twine.
Unless congress cuts off the effect of
the decision by speedy legislation, bind
ing twine will be far cheaper next year for
the Minnesota farmer. A large part of
the supply comes from the Stillwater pen
itentiary, which gives the twine to farm
ers at about cost, and will give consumers
the benefit of any drop in prices of the
raw material.
Warden Wolfer of the Stillwater peni
tentiary has gone to South America to
look up a supply of hemp for next year.
He left before the decision was announced,
but the state board of control has wired
him of the decision.
A drop in hemp will also reduce the
price of sisal.
IRRIGATION'S URGENCY
Chairman Maxwell Appreciates the
President's Recommendations.
Chicago, Dec. s.—George H. Maxwell,
executive chairman of the National Irri
gation association, in speaking of the
president's message, said:
The president's message recommends to
congress a national policy for the storage of
the waters that now go to waste in the arid
region and the reclamation and settlement
of the arid public domain, which, if carried
out, will result In practically doubling the
wealth, resources and population of the United
States within a generation. The president's
familiarity with western conditions enables
him to speak with authority when he says
that the problems must be solved by th«
national government *aud not by the states.
This nieseage will electrify the west because
it opens up such gigantic possibilities for
Increasing population and prosperity in that
region. It will have the support of every
thinking man, and the .business men of the
country who have loyally supported the na
tional irrigation movement will be more than
gratified that it has received this indorse
ment. The president ha* answered every ob
jection to the policy and demonstrated that
its inauguration would benefit every section
[ of the country and every class of the Ameri-
I can people.
