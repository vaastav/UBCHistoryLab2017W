of Aug. 5, 1882, and March 30, 1883. Of
the four vessels under contract one, the Chi
cago, of 4,500 tone, is more thun half
finished the Atlanta, 3,000 tons, has been
ruccessfully launched, and her machinery is
now fitting the Boston, also of 3,000 tons,
is ready for launching and the Dolphin, &
dispatch steamer of 1,500 tons, is ready for
delivery. Certain adverse criticisms upon
the designs of these cruisers are discussed by
the secretary, who insists that the correct
ness of the conclusions reached by the ad
visory board and the department has been
demonstrated by recent developments in ship
building abroad. The machinery of the
double-turreted monitors, Puritan, Terror
and Amphitrite, contracted for under the
act of March 3,1883, is in process of con
struction. No work has been done during
the past year on their armor, for lack of the
necessary appropriations. A fourth mon
itor, the Monadnock, still remains un
finished at the navy yard in California. It is
recommended that early steps be taken so
complete these vessels, and to provide aluo
an armament for the monitor Miantonomah.
The recommendations of tbe naval advisory
board, approved by the department, com
prise the construction of one steel cruiser of
4,500 tons, one cruiser of 3,000 tons, two
heavy-armed gunboats, one light cruising
gunboat, one dispatch vessel armed with
Hotchkifw cannon, one armed ram and three
torpedo boats. The general designs, all of
which are calculated to meet the existing
wants of the service, are now well advanced,
and the construction of the vessels can be
undertaken as soon as you shall grant the
necessary authority.
THK ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS.
The act of congress approved Aug. 7,1882,
authorized the removal to the United States
•of the bodies of Lieutenaut Commander G.
W. De Lotig and his companions of the Jean
nette expedition. The removal has been suc
cessfully accomplished. The remains were
taken from their grave in the Lena delta, in
March, 1883. but were retained at Yakutsk
until the following winter, the season being
too far advanced to admit of their immediate
transportation. They arrived at New York
Feb. 20, 1884, where they were received
with suitable honors. In pursuance of the
joint resolution of congress approved Feb.
13, 1884, a naval expedition was fitted
out for the relief of Lieut A. W. Greely,
United States army, and of the party wfo
had been engaged under his command in
scientific observations at Lady Franklin
bay. The fleet consisted of the steam
sealer Thetis, purchased in England the
Bear, purchased at St. John's, Newfound
land, and the Alert, which was generously
provided by the British government. Prep
arations for the expedition were promptly
inadc bv the secretary of the navy, with the
active co-operation of the secretary of war.
Commander George W. Coffin was placed in
command of the Aiert, and Lieut. W. H. Em
ery in command of the Bear. The Thetis
was intrusted to Commander Winflcld S.
Schley, to whom also was assigned the su
perintendence of the entire expedition. Im
mediately upon its arrival at Uiiernavik,
the fleet began the dangeious navigation of
Melville bay, and in spite of every obstacle,
reached Littleton island on June i22, a
fortnight earlier than any vessel had be
fore attained that point. On the same day it
crossed over to Cape Sabine, where
Lieut. Greeley and other survivors of
his party were discovered. After taking on
board the living and the bodies of the dead,
the relief ships sailed for St. John's, where
they arrived on July 17. They were appro
priately received at Portsmouth, N. 11., on
Aug. 1, and at New York on Aug. 8. One of
the bodies was lauded at the former place.
The others were put on shore at Governor's
island, and with the exception of one,
which was interred in the national cemetery,
wore forwarded thence to the destination in
dicated by friends. The organization and
conduct of the relief expedition reflects
great credit upon all who contributed to its
success. In this, the last of the state mes
sages that I shall have the honor to transmit
to the congress of the United States, I can
not too strongly urge on its attention the
duty of restoring our navy as rapidly as pos
sible to the high state of efficiency which
formerly characterized it. As the long peace
that has lulled us into a sense of fancied se
surity may at any time be disturbed, it is
plain that the policy of strengthening
this arm of the service is dictated by consid
erations of use, economy, of just resrard for
Dur
future tranquility and of true apprecia
tion of the dignity and honor of this repub
lic.
POSTAL,
AFFAIRS.
THE REDUCTION IN LETTER POSTAGE.
The report of the postmaster general ac
quaints you with the present condition and
needs of the postal service. It discloses the
gratifying fact that the loss of revenue from
the reduction in the rate of letter postage, as
recommended in my message of December,
1882 and effected by the act of March 3,
1883, has been much less than was generally
anticipated. My recommendation of this
reduction was based upon the belief that the
actual falling off in receipts from letter post
age for the year immediately succeeding the
shange of rate would be $3,000,000. It has
proved to be only $2,275,000. This is a
trustworthy indication that the revenue will
soon be restored to its former volume by
natural increases of sealed correspondence.
I confidently repeat, therefore, the recom
mendation of my last annual message, that
the single rate of postage upon drop letters
be reduced to one cent wherever the pay
ment of two cents is now required by law.
The double rate is only exacted at offices
where the carrier system is in operation, and
It appears that at these offices the in
crease in tax upon local letters defrays
the cost not only of its own collection
and deli *ery, but of the collection and deliv
ery of all other mail matter, and this is an
irregularity that ought no longer to exist.
approve the recommendation of the post
master general that the unit of weight in the
rating of first-class matter should be one
ounce instead of one-half ounce, as it now is.
in view of the statistics furnished by the de
partment, it may be well doubted whether
•the change would result in any loss pf
revenue. That it would greatly promote the
convenience of the public is beyond dispute.
The free delivery system has been lately
applied to five cities, and the total number
Df offices in which it is now in operation is
159. Experience shows that its adoption
ander proper conditions is equally an accom
modation to the public and an advantage to
the postal service. It is more than
self-sustaining, and, for the reasons
arged by the postmaster general, may
properly be extended. It is the opinion of
that officer that it is proper to provide
means whereby exceptional dispatch in
dealing with letters in free-delivery offices
•nay be secured by the payment of extra
Drdinaiy postage. This scheme may be
made effective by the employment of a
special stamp, whose cost shall be commeu
«urate wth the expense of the entire extra
•service. In some of the large cities private
express companies have undertaken to out
strip the government mail carriers by afford
ing, for the prompt transmission of letters,
better facilities than have hitherto been at
the command of the postoffice. It has
always been the policy of the government to
fliacouragt) such enterprises, and in no better
way can that po icy be maintained than in
supplying the public with the most efficient
service that, with due regard to its own best
interests, can be furnished for its recom
mendatics.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
PBOPOSKD BEFOBKB.
The attorney general renews the recom
mendation contained in his report of last
year, touching the fees of witnesses and
jurora He favors radical change in the fee
bill, the adoption of a system by which at
torneys and marshals of the United States
should be compensated solely by salaries,
and the erection by the government of a
penitentiary for the confinement of offend
ers against ito laws.
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
SECRETARY TELLER'S RECOMMENDATIONS.
Of the varied governmental concerns in
charge of the interior department, the re
port of its secretary presents an interesting
summary. Among the topics deserving par
ticular attention I refer you to his observa
tions respecting our Indian affairs, the pre
emption and timber culture acts, the failure
of railroad companies to take title to lands
granted by the government and the opera
tions of the pension office, the patent office,
the census bureau and bureau of education.
Allusion has been made already to the cir
cumstance that both as between different
Indian tribes and as between the Indians and
tbe whites, the past year has been one of
unbioken peace. In this circumstance the
president is glad to find justification for the
policy of the government in dealing with the
Indian question, and confirmation of views
which were fully expressed in his first com
munication to the Forty-seventh congress.
The secretary urges a new enactment of a
statute for the punishment of crimes com
mitted on Indian reservations, and recom
mends the passage of the bill now pending
in the house of representatives, for the pur
chase of a district of 18,000 square miles
from the Sioux reservation. Both these
measures are worthy of approval. I concur
with him also in advising the repeal of the
pre-emption law, the enactment of statutes

UTAH.
STRINGENT MEASURES SUGGESTED.
The report of the Utah commission will bo
read with interest It discloses the results of
recent legislation looking to the prevention
and punishment of polygamy in that terri
tory. I still believe that if that abominable
practice cannot be suppressed by law, it can
only be dealt with by the most radical legis
lation consistent with the restraints of the
constitution. I again recommend, therefore,
that congress assume absolute political con
trol of the Territory of Utah, and provide
for the appointment of a commission, with
such governmental powers as in its judg
ment may justly and wisely be put into their
hands.
FOREIGN TRADE.
HOW TO EXTEND IT.
In the course of this communication refer
ence has more than once been made to the
policy of this government as regards the ex
tension of our foreign trade. It seems
proper to declare the general principles that
should, in my opinion, underlie our national
efforts in this direction. The main conditions
of the problem may be thus stated: We are
a people rich in mechanical pursuits and
fertile in invention we cover a vastoxtent of
territory, rich in agricultural products and in
nearly all the raw materials necessary for
successful manufacture. We have a system
of productive establishments more" than
sufficient to supply our demands. The
wages of labor are nowhere so great.
The scale of living of our
artisan classes is such as tends to secure
their personal comfort and the development
of those higher moral and intellectual qual
ities that go to the making of good citizens.
Our system of tax and tariff legislation is
yielding a revenue which is in excess of the
present needs of the government These
are elements from which it is sought to de
vise a scheme by which, without unfavora
bly changing the condition of workingmen,
our merchant marine shall be raised from its
enfeebled condition and new markets pro
vided for the sale, beyond our borders, of the
manifold fruits of our industrial enterprise.
Tbe problem is complex and can be solved
by no single measure of innovation or re
form. The countries of the American conti
nent and the adjacent islands are for the
United States the natural market of supply
and demand. It is from them that we should
obtain what we do not produce, or do not
produce in sufficiency, and it is to thorn that
surplus productions of our fields, our mills,
and our workshops should flow, under
conditions that will equalize or favor them
in comparison with foreign competition,
four paths of policy seem to point to this
end. First, a series of reciprocal commercial
treaties with the countries of America which
shall foster between the United States and
them an unhampered movement of trade.
The conditions of these treaties should bo
the free admission of such merchandise aj
this country does not produce, in return for
the admission free or under a favored scheme
of duties of our own products, the benefits
of such exchange to apply on those goods
carried under the flag of the parties to the
contract tbe removal on both sides from
vessels so privileged of all tonnage dues
and national imports, so that their vessels
may ply unhindered between our ports and
those of the other contracting parties,
though without infringing on the reserved
home coasting trade. The removal or
reduction of burdens on the exported
products of those countries coming with
in the benefits of tbe treaties, and the
avoidance of the technicalities, restrictions,
and specialties by which our intercourse
with those countries is at present hampered.
Secondly, the establishment of the consular
service of the United States on a salaried
footing, permitting the relinquishment of
consular fees for not only as respects vessels
under the national flag, but also as respects
vessels of the treaty nations carrying goods
entitled to the benefits of the treaties.
Thirdly, the enactment of measures to favor
the construction and maintenance of a steam
carrying marine under the flag of the United
States Fourthly, the establishment of an
uniform currency basis for the countries of
America, so that the coined products of our
mines may circulate on equal terms through
oat the whole system of commonwealths.
This would require a monetary union of
America, whereby the output of the bullion
producing countries and the circulation of
those which yield neither gold nor silver,
could be adjusted in conformity with the pop
ulation, wealth and commercial needs
of each.
As many of the countries furnish no bullion
to the common stock, the surplus production
if our mines and mints might thus be utilized
and a step taken toward the general remone
tization of silver. To the accomplishment of
these ends, so far as they can be attained by
separate treaties, the negotiations already
concluded and now in progress have been
directed, and the favor with which this
enlarged policy has thus far been received
warrants the belief that its operations will,
ere long, embrace all or nearly all the coun
tries of this hemisphere. It is by no means
desirable, however, that the policy under
consideration should be applied to these
countries alone. The healthful enlargement
of our trade with Europe. Asia and Africa
should be sought by reducing tariff burdens
on such of their wares as neither we nor tbe
other American states are fitted to produce.
•J1 '.U'iJ.113

and thus enabling ourselves to obtain in re
turn a better market for our supplies of
food, of raw material and of the
manufactures in which we excel. It seemc
to me that many of the embarrassing ele
ments in the great national conflict between
protection and free trade may thus be turned
to good account that the revenue may be
reduced so as no longer to overtax the peo
ple the protective duties may be retaiuec
without becoming burdensome that oui
shipping interests may be judiciouslv en
couraged, the currency fixed on a firm basis,
and above all such a unity of interests estab
lished among the states of the American sys
tem as will be of great and ever increasing
advantage to them all. All treaties in the
line of this policy which have been nego
tiated, or are in pi ocess of being negotiated,
contain a provision deemed to be requisite
under the clause of the constitution limiting
to the house of representatives the authority
to originate bills for raising revenue.
THE CIVIL SERVICE.
WORK OF THB LAW AND COMMISSION.
On the 29th of February last I transmitted
to congress the first annual report of the
civil service commission, together with com
munications from the heads of the several
revenue departments of the government,
respecting the working of the law under
which the comission has been acting. The
good results therein foreshadowed have been
more than realized. The system has fully
answered the expectations of its friends in
securing competent and faithful public ser
vants, and in protecting the appointing offi
cers of the government from the pressure of
personal importunity and from the labor of
examining the claims and pretensions of
rival candidates for public employment The
law has had the unqualified support of the
president and of the heads of the several de
partments, and the members of the commis
sion have performed their duties with zeal
and fidelity. Their report will shortly be
submitted, and will be accompanied by such
recommendations for enlarging the scope of
the existing statute as shall commend them
selves to tbe executive and the commission
ers charged with the administration.
MISCELLANEOUS.
BANKRUPTCY—THE CHOLERA.
In view of the general persistent demand
throughout the commercial community for
a national bankrupt law, I hope that the
differences which have hitherto prevented its
enactment may not outlast the present ses
sion. The pestilence which for the past
two years has been raging in the countries of
the East recently made its appearance
in European ports with which we are in con
stant communication. The then secretary of
the treasury, in pursuance of a proclamation
ot' the president, issued certain regulations
restricting, and for a time prohibiting the
importation of rags and the admission of
baggage of immigrants and of travelers ar
riving from infected quarters. Lest this
course may have been without strict warrant
of law, I approve the recommendation of the
present secretary, that congress take action
in the premises, and I also recommend the
immediate adoption of such measures as
will be likely to ward off the dreaded epi
demic, and to mitigate its severity in case it
shall unhappily extend to our shores.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
The annual report of the commissioners of
the District of Columbia reviews the opera
tions of the several departments of its mu
nicipal government, and I ask your careful
consideration of its suggestions in respect to
legislation, especially commending such as
re ate to a revision of the civil and criminal
code, the performance of labor by persons
sentenced to imprisonment in the jail, the
construction and occupation of wharves
along the river front and the erection of a
suitable building for district offices. I rec
ommend that in recognition of the eminent
services of Ulysses S. Grant, the general of
the armies of the United State* and twice
president of the nation, congress confer upon
him a suitable pension. The measures that
seem to me necessary and expedient I have
now, in obcyance to the constitution, recom
mended for your adoption. As respects
ethers of no less importance I shall content
myself with renewing the recommendations
already made to the congress without result
ing the grounds upon which such recommen
dations were based: The preservation of
forests on the public domain the granting
of government "aid for popular education
the amendment of the federal constitution
so as to make effective the disapproval by
the president of particular items in appopri
ation bills the enactment of statutes in re
gard to the filling of vacancies in the presi
dential office, and the determining of vexed
questions respecting presidential inability,
are measures which may justly receive your
serious consideration. As tbe time draws
nigh when I am to retire from the public
service, I cannot refrain from expressing to
the members of the national lecislature,
with whom 1 have been brouirht into per
sonal and official intercourse, my sincere ap
preciation of their unfailing courtesy, and
of their harmonious co-operation with the
executive in so many measures calculated to
promote the best interests of the nation and
to ray fellow citizens generally I acknowl
edge a deep sense of obligation for the sup
port which they have accorded me in the ad
ministration of the executive department of
the government

WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 1, 1884.
A VERITABLE MASCOT.
The special correspondent of the Buffalo
Courier has discovered a mascot which he
describes as follows: During the trial of the
great grape sugar suit of John J. Alberger'
and Horace Williams against Cicero A. Ham
lin and others, which under a change of
venue came before the courts of Genesee
countv in December, 1880, President-elect
Cleveland spent ten days in Batavia as one
of the attorneys for the plaintiff. Mr. Cleve
land stopped at a local hotel, and during his
stay was given a seat at one of the
dining-room tables which he retained at
every meal. One of the dining-rooin girls
took particular pains to see that he was
served promptly and well, and whenever
Mr. Cleveland's" name has been brought be
fore the public as a candidate she has been
enthusiastic in his support In October,
1882, when the adjourned judicial district
convention was held here, the Hon. L. L.
Lewis of Buffalo, one of the candidates
for the
nomination, made the hotel his headquarters
during the deadlock that ensued,and occupied
the same seat at the same table that Gov.
Cleveland had retained, and was waited upon
by the same girl. The result of the conven
tion was Judge Lewis' nomination and sub
sequent election. During the recent Repub
lican congressional convention here Land
lord Collins, of the St. James, was telling
Judge Sawyer of Orleans, whose name
was presented for nomination, of the good
fortune of the gentlemen who had occupied
the seat referred to in bis dining room, and
though Judge Sawyer's chances of receiving
the honor did not seem to be great, he was
given tbe cbair at the table that had seated
tbe other gentlemen. Tbe days of the con
vention wore away without any perceptible
improvement in Sawyer's chances, until the
577th ballot, when the long and acrimonious
contest was brought to a close by the selec
tion of Judge Sawyer, and he has been elect
ed by a round majority. This dining room
grl, considering the good luck that has at
tended the aspirants to office who have oc
cupied the seat at her table, lays claim to
being a mascot Good fortune has surely
attended the three genUetpen whose nam*,.,
are mentioned.
