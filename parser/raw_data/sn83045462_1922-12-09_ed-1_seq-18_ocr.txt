NEW YORK. December 9 ?Today's
stock market was a mixture of fresh
buying in some directions and profit
taking in others. The result was a
mixed series of price changes, with
no great amount of change either
way. Prices went higher at the
opening, hut fell hack somewhat in
the last hour of trading.
Tt could not be raid that outside
matters cut much figure in the various
movements of the day. The
gathering of premiers at London to
discuss German reparations and inlet
allied debts was regarded in financial
circles rather hopefully in view
of the reported modifications of the
French attitude. Tin se certainly
xnake it appear that the present conterence
has much better chance of
accomplishing something more than
any of its predecessors. Hut as an
influence in the market, thgse opti
niistic anticipations were scarcely
noticeable.
Sterling: exchange sold about 54.57
again today and the continental exciiangcs
were steady.
l eader* In Karly Trading.
In the advance during the first
hour in the stock market the leaders
were the motor' shares, equipments
and sugars. Along with the motors
went the rubber and tire stocks, the
expectation here being that other
companies will follow the lead of the
K? lly-Sprlngfleld and raise prices before
the end of the year. A better
appreciation of the return to profitable
condition^ In the. sugar industry
was obviously back of the rise m the
sugar stocks, ail of which reached
ine highest prices they have touched
in the last three months.

The strength in Lima Locomotive,
which carried it hack ;o-ver a great
part of the ground lost in the recent
decline, was due to reports of a
merger " with Baldwin Locomotive.
While there ha* been nothing official'
regarding such a comoination. the
street Js taking the report' rather
seiioucly. Lima, in comparison with
the other locomotive concerns?Baldwin
and American-?showed just as
good earnings as its two competitors

today. The flrst 4??s and the third I
4lis Wot up to 33, the high quotations j
, for so-me time. Government Issues
have been slowly advancing all the
f Week, but the movement today was
more noticeable. Generally speaking
other high-grade securities were firm
to strong. It Is. of course, time for
some suck development preceding a
so-called January reinvestment demand.
Among the Issues to show gains today
were I,. & N. unified 4s nnd Great
Northern 7s of the railroads and IlltuoIh
Steel 4'la of the Industrials. Buffalo,
Koohcster and Pittsburgh General

Further Weakness la fit. Pants.
Among speculative Issue* the features
were further weakness In the
obligations of the St. Paul and a recovery
In those of the 8t. Ivoula-San
Fraliclsco. All the St. Paul bonds
tvtrs again offered In heavy volume,
with consequent losses In price. The
j recovery In the St. L,ouls-9an Fran
cisco issues was most marked In the
adjustment 6s, which were up more
than 2 points, but the Income ds also
Rained sharply. Chicago Railway* 5s
advanced a point on very small transactions.

N'KW YORK, December 9.?Creditors i
of the bankrupt stock brokerage firm !
of Kardos & Burke, who had been j
.assured they would receive dollar for j
dollar, were thrown into a panic at j
a joint bankruptcy and creditors' )
meeting yesterday, when Charles H. j
Lobell, expert accountant, testified j
j they might get very little. j
When the firm failed, eight months j
ago, the creditors, scattered'over the j
country, but chiefly in New York and )
Chicago, had been told in a circular
bearing the name of the flrm'a attorney
that the assets were ample to pay
100 cents on the dollar and that business
would be resumed in a few
months. Testifying before Iteferee
Peter J. Olney, the accountant declared
yesterday the firm's liabilities
would total about $2,000,000, with assets
of about $200,000, and Its books
were in such complicated condition
that it would take fifteen bookkeepers
an entire year to straighten them
out.
The three-score or more creditors
clamored to know how the assets had
disappeared, and their anger was Intensified
when it was brought out J
tlfat the books showed an item of!
$&#4.U09 owed to the firm of Max |
Goodney. j
Louis M. Kardos, jr., young mem- I
i her of the firm, pressed to tell who I
Goodney was. said he knew him as i
. a trader, but had no idea how he J

ing teller.
Lob ell testified the books showed
that. Kardos had withdrawn more
? than $400,000 of the firm's money as
? "advance*" In answer to the charge,
; Kardos presented canceled checks to!
taling $345,928, which he declared
! were loans he had made to Kardos
; & Burke. !
John M. Burke, former treasurer of I
the United States and Governor of i
: North Dakota, did not invest one cent i
, when he became a member of the

1 of money he was accused of having p
! withdrawn in the advances was too i
much. |

ENGLISH TELE TREES SCARCE
LOXDOX, December p.?Christmas
trees will be scare in England this
year. The trees have b.een cut in
[such large numbers of late that it
[has been found necessary to reduce
ithe supply in order to save them from
[extermination. Ynletide fruits and
nuts, imported rrom me colonies, are
I particularly plentiful, however, and
j the prices are the lowest since the
war. Covent Garden is already floodI

and for the moment I.as drawn attention
from all the other business per-*
formancee. This is natural, for Christ,

performance. There no doubt that
it will exceed in volume and in do Lar

year since the post-armistice boor.,
and bids fair to equal those free
spending: days of If IS and If 19.
In the meantime a number of basi
industries are in the midst of a Jul
due less to inabtivity of demand tha
to seasonal causes and the approach
of the inventory period. Raw wool,
cotton and silk for the moment arc
in lees demand.

! temporarily. This is indicated by tic
| fact that wages in many of the buiLc
jing trades will be advanced again ??
J January 1. These advances, ft is ir
jtere.stingr to note, apply for the mo*"
J part to unskilled or semi-skilled
workers rather than to master workmen.
Building materials are less a tive.
but with prices still firmly maintained
at previous ievels.
Further evidence of the trend of
wages is; to be seen in the voluntary
increase of 2 cents an hour awarded
to Pennsylvania railroad maintenance
of way men. This will add $1.800.?><H
annually to the pay rolls of the roae
Another aevelopment was announce
ment by the Union Pacific of ad op
tion of a system of wages from 2 cent*
to 10 cents an hour higher than tho*.t
established by the Uailroad Labor
| Board.
| These advances were arrived at by
negotiation with ao-caJled "eompar.
unions" and mark* determination of
the roads to deal individually in future
with labor questions. This po'icy
was still further emphasized by

of Railroad Executives would with

FARMlMSfTUATION
SLIGHTLY IMPROVED
t
Department or Agriculture
Notes Some important Increases
in Prices.
The general agricultural sitna.on
In the United States has improved
slightly, as Indicated by the monthly
agricultural review of the Department
of Agriculture. Cotton, grain
and live stock products prices, as well
as prices of things farmers have to
buy, have risen slowly, the October
price index on ten farm products being
110. compared with 100 for 1913.
! "This hes put a little money ii-.to
i the pockets cf some farmers, put
5 heart into many more, and has dor.a
both for those who carry farm products
through the channels of trade."
the review says. *
( The prices the farmer pays for other
j than food products, according to the
) wholesale price index, has risen u>
|1<>P. compared with 100 in 1913. Thus
i a unit of farm products will purchase
j 35 per cent less of other commodities
than it would in 1013.
Maay Peeplr Reaving Fanita
November figures indicate an abnr..
mal movement of population from
farms to towns.
Agricultural conditions in the ea%i
arc 1n relatively poor shape. Potato. .
apple, haj* and truck growers arc
thoroughly discouraged, the report
says. S<?me poultr.vmen are doing
fairly well, but most dairymen are
having all they ear do to break even.
The cotton belt shows the best general
recovery of any r? gion as a
whole. Cotton is very poor in many
areas, but those having cotton t?? se"!l
feel fairly good at present prices.
General business has been much stimulated.
I a? P?lt r>r?Dror?J
[Farmers in the corn belt are somewhat
encouraged at the rise in grain
] prices. A heavy fall run of hogs to
I market, as well as heavy movements
of feeder cattle and sheep to farms,
is reported. Winter grains show-good
stands.
Wheat belt shippers have been
hampered by an almost unprecedented
shortage of freight cars. Winter
wheat stands are reported generallv
fairly good. Sheepmen in the range
country feel fairly good at sheep,
lamb and wool prices, and the outlook
for next year is generally considered
favorable. Pacific coast shipj
pers have been hampered by car
I shortage. Apple growers have been
hard hit by low prices in eastern
markets.
