rill began today tbo discussion of the tat ME
question. Many of (be politicians hero be
lieve that the tarllt Issue will provoke ivgreat
deal of important discussion this winter.
Tim political inilucnccs which a long debate
may *lovclup are regarded as likely to be of a
mure immediate consequence limn any effect
sm*h debate may have on the TarllT bill. A
distinguished member of tho House, a Demo
crat, and a farmer candidate for Speaker,
eatne up to tho seiinto today fur
tho purpose of hearing- Air. Morrill's
Hpeeeli. (’ailing Senator Bayard to him,

ocratic party, and that Hendricks is getting
ready to follow him. Von are not going over

’ SENATOR RAYAltll'S REPLY
was Unit bis roots are 100 deep down on Hint
subject to permit of any change now. This
little conversation is a mere sample of a
great deal of talk that ono may hear any day.
Air. Alorrill’s speech was not expected to bo
a very powerful argument In favor of pro
tection. Alorrill’s views on tho tarllt are as
well known ns those of I’ig-lion Kelley,
and are largely embodied in what is known
tw the Alorrlll Tariff bill. Bntltwn4 under
stood that tho Senator hud spent a great deal
of time in tho preparation of ids speech, and
tiiat it was designed more fora popular read
ing than for a technical and abstract defense.
If Air. Alorrlll were a public speaker lie
doubtless would have had a much larger
audience. He Is a graceful gentleman,
writes pleasantly and at times keenly, but
ills speeches full flat, largely because he con
iines himself closely to manuscript, and lias
not a single oratorical grace. Notwithstand
ing his well-known defects ns a public
speaker, some of the
PUOMINENT CONOItES.SMKN OF BOTH HOUSES
listened with tho closest nttenilon until tbo
speech was finished. More of the Demo
cratic Senators did Mr. Morrill the honor
than of Ids Ilepubllcan associates. Mr.
Vonrhces took a seat near to AlorrlU’s desk.
Ho had prepared pads upon which ho took
numerous notes, some hooks of reference,
whoso leaves ho occasionally opened, and
when not thus encased sat wljh Ids eyes
llxud steadfastly upon the speaker. Mr.
Voorhees’ recent announcement of
certain (views on the thrill have
not only caused a great deal of
comment, but have also resulted In a good
deal of personal correspondence, some of
which has not been pleasing to Air. Voor
bees. He Is said lobe thin-skinned—to bo
more easily touched to tho quick by publlo
criticism than many other prominent men in
public life. Ho has refused to muko any
special statement of Ids views since ho has
been here, but it Is known that he expects,
Indore tho session closes, to muko a speech
which a friend of ids says
WILL CAUSE A SENSATION.
Senator Beck, of Kentucky, Hanked Senator
Morrill ontho other side. He sat In Don
Cameron's sent. Air. Cameron appeared to
tako a greater Interest In practical politics
than in a question which is said to bo pecul
iarly Important to tho people of his Stale.
Mr. Beck listened with mi attention which
was tireless to (ho three hours ot speaking
which Air. Morrill required. A little further
along in the front'row Senator Joe Brown,
of Georgia,' sat stroking his long beard and
looking very wise. He, 100, did not Icavo
his place until Clio speech was linlshml, while
Senator Sluter, of Oregon, Senator Cockrell,
of Missouri, and Senator i'omlteton, of Ohio,
without leaving the Democratic side of tho
Chamber, listened to every word.
OF THE HKPUm.tOAN SKNATOIIS
only three paid any intention. John Bher
man hoard every word of tho Bpuech, mid
boemud to like It. Senators* Mitchell, of
Pennsylvania, and Anthony, of ilhodo Jsland,
also did Morrill the honor of hearing him
through. Senator Edmunds, for whom tho
question has no charms at nil, retired nsaoon
ns Ida colleague began to apeak, a proceeding
very unusual with him. Tho Interest that
the speech attracted on tho Democratic side
was very noticeable. This Interest arises,
not by reason of any special merit which
Senator Morrill may nave In treating tho
question, but becuusu anything that any pub*
Ho man says now upon this question Is
looked upon as largely directed to the Demo*
crutio party.

were Instructed to move Tor n rehearing of this

,to withdraw that Itwtrumlon, and I think I

nil tho ru%pect mid weight to which tho well

Imupt entitle It, It become* my duty to state, In

Thoprinclplc upon which tho Iluzzl case rests,
stated simply and brlolly. Is this: that tho com
mission bus tho right to go behind the certificate
of imtunilbuiUon to decide, nut whether tho
court which Issued H was of competent Juris
diction, not whether u cartllleato of naturaliza
tion hns been granted to tho claimant, but
whether It has been property granted. In short,
time the commission Is a court of appeal, with
tho right to review tho duly-ren
dered Judgment of tho courts of
tho United States. This Issue, which
affects the very essence of tho agreement, has
been made before. In In the ease of Del
gado, Mr. llarthuldi. Minister from France, their
umpire, decided: "That tho claimant bus been
naturalized an American citizen according to
tho laws of United States: that the Judge who
ordered him to ho admitted a citizen of tho

many cases by tho Supreme Court of tho United

THE CASK OP I’ORTUANUO,
tbo same umpire decided that, “us to tho tra
veled allegation of American citizenship of tho
deceased, competent and sulllcieut proof there
of, n* required by tho agreement of Feb. Ilf, 18T1,
1* given by bis eertiUuaiu of naturalization,such

such ground* of Impeachment, upon which any
certiliento of naturalization may bo declared al
together void, nut being found la ibis case, tbo
umpire culled upon tu rcsolru such conlllct
about tho alleghmco of the deceased must, fol
lowing previous adjudications by um
pires of this commission, and lu
tbo absence of any treaty between Spain
and tbo United States, restricting the power of
the United States to grant naturalization in ac
cordance with municipal law, us Interpreted by
tbo municipal courts, give full fureo to the
naturalization ol tbo deceased, oven against
Spain.”
THIS GOVERNMENT HAD THE RIGHT
to consider tbeso decisions ua final and conclu
sive of tbo moaning of tbo agreement under
them. From tbo (Into of tbo opening of tbo
commission, by a succession of umpire* 107 eases
bavo been tried aud decided. forty cases re
main nn tbo docks. 'lf tho decision of formor
umpire* Is to bo rovnrsed, then tbo forty cases
tiro to bo Judged upon entirely different princi
ples from tbo preceding oases. In tact, tbo 107
cases will bavo been decided under an agree
ment meaning nn entirely ditferent and even
contradictory thing. Two claimants presenting
cortltlcntos of naturalization of tbo same ditto,
Issued from tbo sumo court, would be tbo ono
received and tbo other rejected, not on any fixed
principle, but according ns the u urn tier of bis
claim un tbo ducket brought bis ease under tbo
consideration of ono or tbo otbor umpire.
WHAT EFFECT
should bo given to tho oercllicnte of naturallzn
don, ns ii Is understood by tho contracting par*
ties and declared in tho ttlpulutlons of tho
agreement, uud wlmt power the commission
Itself may have to extend or limit ibis olfoct by
construction. I will not now discuss; but It is
evident that, If tho commission bos or pus uot as*
Homed tho power to decide this question, which
U one uot of fact hut of coustruuUon of tho in
tent of the agreement, ouco decided It must bo
considered as settled forever, for It Is obvious
that no settlement can bo reached Just to tho
claimant where tho ndo of construction varies
with every change which may occur In the per
son of tho umpire.
AND THIS fIOVKUNMIIST MUST INSIST
that all claims shall bo tried'by tho sumo rule,
and under the sumo construction of the agree
ment-between Hjmlu and tho United glides. Tho
commission Is not a proper tribunal to which
should bo submitted tho argument of tho
United States in this regard. Whether this
course Is Juutllled by tho circumstances, or
whether our Interpretation of the agreement bo
tho corrcot one, nro questions, upon tho failure
of tho commission, to bo discussed aud decided
by tlm two Governments themselves. For tho
present* (t Is suilloicnt that 1 refuse to
recognize tbo power of the commission
to denationalize an American citizenship. When
u court of oumnetont Jurisdiction, administer
ing tho law of (ho land, Issued Its regular coni It
cute of naturalization to Piodro Uuzzl bo was
made a citizen of tho United Status, and no pow
er resides In tho Executive Department of this
Government to reverse op review that Judgment,
and what tbo power of (ho Executive cannot do
In itself It cannot delegate to a commission,
which Is tho racro creature of tho Executive
agreement.

Washington, D. C., Dec. B.—Tho friends
of William Penn Nixon have privately ad

itly informed them that ho cannot support

to recommend another man. Who that
man Is ho has not yet stated, but the Chicago
Congressmen are of, Uio -opinion that Dun
Shepard Is tho man. Whether Davis Ims a
second choice after A. M. Wright Is not
known. Farwell’s llrat choice still Is William
Henry Smith, ho says, but Nixon's friends
claim him for them os his second choice.
Whether their claims tiro well founded does
not appear. Mr. Aldrich does not seem to
be taking any part In the light, and says that
not a single person in his Congressional dis
trict has osked him for his support for that
position. * •
THE ILLINOIS MBMIIBIIB,
outside of Chicago, of course, take no Inter
est In It. It is not known that Logan's rec
ommendation will prevail, but It Is pretty
certain that nobody will be appointed who Is
especially hostile to Senator Logan, for tho
Senate is so constituted uud there Is such an
element of Freemasonry in tlmt body that a
man who Is tho political enemy of Senator
Logan could probably not bo confirmed.

* Washington, D. 0., Dec. B.—The time of
tho Senate was mostly occupied today with
the ultra-radical speech of Senator Morrill,
ofYormont, in favor of a lilgh protective

llvery occupying over two hours. At its
conclusion, tho Chamber being' almost
emptied of members, a motion to adjourn
wits readily carried. This speech, which
contained tho hackneyed protective argu
ment, Is the opening of the turltf discussion.
Desides Morrill’s speech there wus tho usual
amount of bills, resolutions, and memorials
for reference. Among them was tho old bill
to pension tho veterans of tho Mexican War,
Joint resolutions of the Missouri Legislature
presented by Senator Cockrell for tho re
moval of the salt tux, mul fur providing

that a great portion of the time of the Senate
between this and the holiday recess
will bo devoted to tho consideration of

cases of Daphnni nml .Miller, of Now York.
No actlonwas taken, but tho feeling in tho

cases, as they Hnd nothing In them. The at
tempt to cast a cloud upon the titles of the
new New York Senators was at beat a piece
of apUc-work.
SUNSET CON.
Mr. Hnndall Is discovering Hint ho will not
be able to unite the Democratic party on a
proposition to abolish tho Internal revenue
system. Mr. Cox, referring to tho Handail
proposition, says: “ Certainly, taxation
ought to be reduced, Tho Internal revenue
system should be modllled, not now
abolished, and Uio tariff should bo revised.*
Uur legislation should bo In a more conti
nental spirit, not in a narrow spirit, not in
tho interest ahum of tho seaboard, or of a
section, but of tho country and tho continent.
.Most certainly should wo build up a navy
ami a merchant marine. 1 have‘Just re

ATKINS, OB’ TRNNBSSRB.
HIS VIEWS ON THE PiIESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
Sfvdnl to Ctuelninill Commereiiil,
Washington, D. C„ Dec. 7.— “ What do
you think of X’resldent Arthur’s message?”
asked your correspondent of llepreseututlvo
Atkins, of Tennessee, today.
“ X have not rend the whole of It, but as far
as 1 have read X have found it a lucid,
modest, statesmanlike document. 1 was
greatly pleased to llnd thnt Grant had nut
been ablo. to give it a bloody-shlrt cast, as 1
had feared ho would do.”
“Xt appoars to bo tho general Impression
that tho X’lesldent did nut ask Ucu. Grunt's
advice ns to what should bo said in the mes
sage,” remarked the correspondent.
•• Wall, that Is my own Impression, and I
begin to think that Arthur means to bo I’res-
Ideut himself, and of tho whole country.”
** What do yon think of his recommenda
tions respecting tho tariff mid llnances ? ” .
” Oh, of course, X do not agree with him
there. X am for a tariff for revenue only,
ami cutting .down the duty on every article
until the blood is drawn. No protection, is
my motto. Then X am for the unlimited
coinage of silver and the abolition of tho
National banking system.”
“ What about the question ot
polygamy?”
/ “Well, I think I am with tho President
there, at- least so fur as the making of a
polygamous wife a competent witness against
her polygamous husband Is concerned. That
Is all Congress can do, mid X nm in favor of

Wasiiixoto.v, 1). C., Dec. B.—The Commis
sioner of Intenml Revenue, In his annual
report, recommends an Individual stamp for
cigars, on tho ground that It wonld.alford
tho highest proof of tho payment of tho tax,
ami would prevent tho fraudulent rellllingof
stamped boxes, which Is believed to be a
means of toss to the Ciovernmcnt. lie
Is of opinion that Urn system of
stamping each cigar with a stamp
prepared for general use, without reference
to the number packed In the box, can be In
troduced to great advantage to the Govern
ment. (len. John D. Hawley, of Illinois, Is
hero in tlio Interest of n client who thinks he
has Invented a device which will meet tho
reiinlromcnts of tlio Internal-revenue break.
It will ho u matter that Congress will have to
pass upon before any stamp can bo adopted.

dressed the Senate at considerably length
upon Ids Tarllf Commission bill. Thospuult
cr said onr nearest approaottps to free trade
had been seasons of national disaster, us
■were the years of 183 d, 1847, and 1867, and the
further we had receded from free trade the
bolter had labor fared, and the greater had
been the material and educational advance
ment of the'country. Thu evidences that the
Iree-trude prosperity of Great Britain was
on the wane were apparent lii the 5,000 houses
InShollhddand the 10,000 In Birmingham
now marked '‘To Let.*’ Jly contended that
the British policy hud been everywhere re
jected. Asa result of this pulley, British
agriculture was now threatened with ruin
by foreign competition, and land Derby, In
u late speech to the Lancashire tanners, had
suggested the desperate remedy of the emi
gration of some 500,000 of thorn, so that (hose
who remain might farm on better terms.
Moreover, there wero recent evidences of u
change of British opinion to the extent that,
while free trade would bo tho best thing for
England, if other notion* would follow her
example, t was not tho best thing for her If
