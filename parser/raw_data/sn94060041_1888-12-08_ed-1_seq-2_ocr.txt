ACCOMAC COURT-HOUSE, VA.
SATURDAY. DKCKMBEK S, 18SS
Entered at the Postoftice at Accomac
C. H..Va.. as second-class matter.
The claim made by the Repub?
cans soon after tho election of a
majority from twenty to twenty
five in the House of Representa
tives hi the fifty first Congress has
been assuming smaller proportions
daily since, until it has dwindled
down to a majority ranging from
three to seven. Coutrary to their
predictions also, the Democrats
have not attempted to steal the
House, by withholding certificates
of .Republicans elected in the
Southern States. Their majority
on the contrary is due to the elec?
tion of Representatives iu the
South from districts heretofore
Democratic. Beaten as they have
been in some'districts by apathy,
indifference and by Democrats so
called, who "tor personal reasons?
have voted for Republicans, they
have made no effort to pervert the
people's will. The Republicans,
tbercfoie, are in control of every
branch of our Government and will
be responsible ior all legislation.
Antagonized as they will be, how
evei'jhy astrongDemocratic uiinor
ity,serious apprehensions need not
be entertained that dangerous sec?
tional measures introduced by them
will prevail.

Accoiding to a table published by
the New lurk Tribune, the lead
n g Republican newspaper of the
(vuiiiry, Cleveland would have
been elected President by nearly
one liundud thousand plurality
? ver Gen. Harrison, bad the vote
uT Presto cut in November been a
direc one instead of for prcsideu
t nil elect ois? and t he colored voters
out ol the question his plurality
would have amounted to nearly a
million and a quarter. Tariff re?
form does not stem therefore to
uave deleated Air. Cleveland. It
was due to ignorance, represented
by a million cbior^tl votes aud
money at the command of the Re?
publicans, lavishly expended in
the doubtful States. Another sig
nificaut fact iu connection with the
vote in 1888, is that the Demo
oratio increase over the Republi?
can, compared with 1884,amounted
to ueaily eighty thousaud votes.
Virginia Republicans, it is said,
will be accorded great considera?
tion iu the patronage to be dis?
pensed by the incoming adminis?
tration, in the hope thereby of
gathering the old Commonwealth
into the Republican fold. The
close vote in the late election, it is
thought, entitles them to that con?
sideration and it is needless to add
that they fully appreciate the situ?
ation, and stand ready to accept
the loaves aud fishes which will be
parcelled out to them. Prominent?
ly meutioni d in that connection is
ex Attorney-General Blair, of "hon
or won't buy a breakfast" fame
and the office cf Solicitor of the
Treasury, it is said, will be his re
ward for distinguished services to
tbe g. o. p. The henchmen of Ma
boue will be served first and until
tbey are satisfied, of cuurse the
more respectable Republicans ueed
not apply.
A joint resolution has been in
trod need in the House of Repre?
sentatives, providing for the elec
tiou of President and Vice Presi?
dent bv a direct vote of the peo?
ple A The .measure, will, of course,
bo opposed by the Republicans, as
their success in a presidential con
test depends upon a judicious use
of "boodle" in the closely contested
Slates?aud as they soon will be
in power it will probably never be
heard of again.
THE HtlSIDENT'S atESJSAGE.
Tai?iff lUfurii. Stroiiif'jr Ucccwm.n?

Washington, D. C, Decem
ber 3.?Tb.? President's message
was presented to Congress shortly
utter that body convened today.?
It is a. lengthy document, making
15S pages of letter paper. The
following is an abstracto.*'its most
prominent subjects:
The President commences his
message by reminding Congress
that with the expiration of the
present session tue> firs'; century
of the constitutional experience of
the United States as a nation will
be complete. On this point he
says: When theexperiment of our
Government was undertaken, the
chart adopted tor our guidance
was tho constitution. Departure
from the lines there laid down is
failure. It is only by a strict ad?
herence to the direction they nidi
cate, and by restraint within the
limitation they fix, that we can
furnish proof to tho world of the
titucss o* the American people for
self government.
The President strongly urges the
necessity for tariff reduction, and
calls attention to the growing pow?
er of trusts, monopolies and coinbi
nations of capital at the expense
of the toiling masses, lie says:
rlhe necessity of the reduction of
utir revenue is so apparent as to be
generally conceded. Put the means
by which this end shall be accom?
plished and the sum of direct ben
etit which shall result to our citi?
zens, present a controversy of the
utmost importance. There should
be no scheme accepted as satisfac?
tory by which tho burdens of the
people are only apparently re?
moved. Extravagant appropria?
tions of public money, with all
their demoralizing consequence..-,
should not tie tolerated as a means
of relieving the treasury of i;s
present*surplus, or as furnishing
pretext, for resisting a proper re?
duction in tariff rates. Existing
evils and injustice should be bor?
est lv recognized, boldly met and
effectively remedied. There should
be no cessation of the struggle un?
til a plan is perfected fair and con?
servative, to reward existing in?
dustries, but which will reduce the
cost to consumers of necessaries of
life, while it prov'des for our man?
ufacturers the advantage of freer
raw material and permits no in
jury to the interests of American
labor. The cause for which the
battle is waged is comprised with?
in lines death and distinctly de
lined. It should never be Comoro
mised. It is the people's cause.
On the subject ot foreign rela
ticus, the Presideut reports that
since his last annual message such
relations have been strengthened
and improved by new and re?
newed treaties of amity. Refer
ence is made to the fishery dispute
with Canada, and to the occur?
rence which resulted in his de?
clining to hold intercourse with
the British Minister. Referring to
the subject of naturalization, the
President strongly urges the re?
vision of stich laws. Speaking of
the surplus in the treasury tae
President says:
j scnrtffl Kueiu to 3*. ...
excessive and unnecessary '^L*a
tion is continued and the Govern?
ment, is forced lo pursue this policy
?d' purchasing its own bonds at the
premium winch it will be necessary
to paj, the loss to the people will
be hundreds of millions of dollars.
Since the purchase of bonds was
undertaken as mentioned nearly all
that have been offered were at last
accepied. It has been made quite
apparent that the Government was
in danger of being subjected to
combinations to raise their price,
as appears by-the instance men?
tioned by the secretary of the
treasury.
The President, after giving var?
ious informal ion iu reference to
foreign and domestic affairs, and
making numerous recommenda?
tions, thus concludes his message:
The consciousness that I have pre?
sented but an imperfect statement
of the condition of our country and
iis wants occasions uo fear that
anything omitted is not kuowu and
appreciated by the Congress, upon
whom rests the responsibility of
intelligent legislation in behalf of
a great nation ami a confiding peo
pie. As public servants we shall
do our duty well if we constantly
guard the rectitude of our in ten
tious, maintain unsullied our love
of country and with unselfish pur?
pose strive for the public good.
