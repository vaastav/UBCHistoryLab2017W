A. J. Durland has begun a test in
roadmaking In front of his houses on
South First street , which may bo of
value. Over the foundation of pulver
ized brickbats , he placed a coating of
lime secured at the old sugar factory.
On top of this lime a layer of gravel
has been placed. The brick and lime
will form a solid foundation to rest
the gravel on and It Is thought by
many driving that way that the exper
iment will prove that the gravel needs
a solid foundation. "In my opinion , "
said Charles Dudley , who drives on
that route , "the gravel will need a
solid foundation to make it perma
nent and this is being furnished by
the lime and brick. "

THREE BATHS A DAY.
Comedian In the "Prince of Pllsen"
Takes to Cold Water.
The following llttlo story of Jess
Dandy , leading man In the "Prince of
Pllscn" company , who played hero
last year , Is clipped from the Sioux
City Journal and will bo appreciated
In Norfolk oven It Norfolk can not
see Mr. Dandy do his stunts again
this season :
Three times n day and four times
on matinee days does Jess Dandy
bathe , and he Is known In the profes
sion as the cleanest man on the stage.
Mr. Dandy told all about it In his
dressing room at the Now Grand the
ater last evening just before ho went
on In the second act of "Tho Prince
of Pllsen" to take his dip In the foun
tain. Ho said ho always liked cold
water , anyway , so it was no punish
ment for him when ho took the part
of Hans Wagner , which necessitates
his frequent appearance in the foun
tain shower. Ho says ho never catch
es cold ns a result of his dousings. He
wears ordinary clothes for his soaking
stunt , with the exception of his boots ,
which are of rubber.
This was Mr. Dandy's third visit to
Sioux City. Upon the first presenta
tion of the opera here John W. Ran-
some appeared as Hans Wagner. In
January Mr. Dandy will celebrate his
1,000th performance In the part. Dur
ing all his time with the show ho has
never missed a performance and ho
has never missed a cue. That is a
record of which few actors can boast.
Mr. Dandy is blessed with much
geniality. As he painted his face last
evening he recited in an original man
ner some of the trials of the profes
sion. He told how It had taken the
company nine hours to get from Lin
coln to Sioux City and how all would
have to arise early in the morning to
catch a train to Omaha.
The "bogus prince" thinks well of
Sioux City because of the cordial re
ception It Invariably gives him. He
said : "This certainly Is a great show
town. "

COULD RUN POSTOFFICE.
John R. Hays Believes Private Con
trol Would Result in Economy.
John R. Hays , postmaster In Norfolk ,
believes that the private parties who
have made a proposition to take over
from the government the operation of
the postofllcc , and who claim that un
der private management the postofllce
department could bo operated more
economically than under government
supervision , has the right theory concerning -
corning the matter. Mr. Hays said In
this regard :
"Nobody can tell cortalnlv. I am
Inclined to think private parties could
operate the postofllco cheaper than
the government is doing but I can give
no data on which to base such an opin
ion. "
The new typo of postage stamps
promised for next year , on which It
is claimed the names of cities will
appear , will have no particular effect
upon tlio receipts of the Norfolk post-
ofljco In the eyes of the department.
Mr. Hays said , speaking of this sub
ject , "This would not affect this ofllco
except possibly where stamps are pur
chased to enclose In letters in lieu of
small change and this would make
such small difference that It would not
bo worth mentioning. "
The names of issuing offices will ho
printed on stamps next year , It Is
said , In order to check postofllco rob
beries and In order to detect padded
postal receipts.
The proposition of private parties
to take over the postofllco 1ms caused
government ownership agitators to
tnko notice and has nmdo the public
realize that tlio deparlmonl'H determi
nation to increase the nuwnpaper post *
ago rate , which must Inevitably In
crease newspaper rates , Is unfair.

ARRIVED AT NOON TO LOOK OVER
INSANE HOSPITAL.
FIRST VISIT SINCE TROUBLE
The Governor Snld That Ho Would
Make Number of Recommendations
to the Coming State Legislature Re
garding Matters Needing Attention.
( From U'oiliU'Hilay'H Dully. )
Governor John H. Mickey arrived In
Norfolk at noon from Lincoln , to look
over the affairs of Iho Htnto IIIHIIIIO
hospital at this place , llo was driven
dlroctly to Iho Institution where hoiito
luiioli with Iho new Huporlntoiidoiil ,
Dr. Young. Over the telephone Gov
ernor Mickey said :
"I have jimt oomo to Norfolk for the
purpose of seeing how things are run
ning In the slate Institution. I shall
return to Lincoln Thursday morning ,
I think. I have not yet gone through
the wards out here , so ( hat I do not
know whether the Institution Is over
crowded or not. Everything seems to
be running nicely. I am looking over
the reports at the present timo. "
Asked If ho would make any roconi-
meiidatloim to the state legislature In
regard to the needs of the Norfolk hos
pital , the governor mild : "I oxpectlo
make some recommendations ! < > the
legislature In regard to niutteni of the
state on which 1 doom Information Is
advisable. I am not giving out any
thing of the substance of what I shall
say. I am not prepared to say what I
may Include In the report regarding
the Norfolk hospital. "
Governor Mickey said that ho Is
now closing up the dudes of his olllce
but that ho has not yet determined
where ho will make his future homo
It may he In Lincoln and It may be In
Omaha. For the remainder of this
school year , however , ho will remain
In Lincoln , for the bandit of his chil
dren's schooling.
This was the governor's first visit to
Norfolk since the day when ho called

on their part to leave the Institution
at that lime. Since then both have
resigned and the new olllclals , Dr.
Young as superintendent and Dr. Sing
er as assistant superintendent , have
been placed In charge of the Institu
tion.
WRETCHED JAIL SERVICE
Towns West of Norfolk buffer Miser
ably Since Train Was Extended.
There Is something radically wrong
with tlio railway mall servlco between
Norfolk and Clmdron on I bo newly
oxtc'iidcd Northwestern train , NOR. 1
and 2. Apparent lack of sufllclont
help on the mall cars to handle the
bulk of business carried In that train ,
has so crippled the service that there
Is practically no dependence to bo
placed upon It at tlio present time.
People living In all towns west of
Norfolk on that line are complaining
and the complaints are Retting loud.
On several occasions bundles of mall
have been taken past Battle Creek ,
Nellgh , Ewlng and perhaps other
towns. One one day last week , In
stead of bringing back the delayed
bundle on the early morning train ,
the package was not 'returned to Nc-
llgh until the next forenoon. A train
was missed In Its return.
The old time postal clerks on that
line have long been hard pressed In
getting out the mall. The additional
territory between Long Pine and
Clmdron has not In any way lightened
the burden. A helper has been added
but the force of workmen , apparently ,
Is still Infwmclent because the most
wretched service yet experienced Is
now being received.
The postal clerks are working till
they are black In the face to handle
the mall , but tlio load Is too heavy.
The people west of Norfolk want
and demand a better service.

NEBRASKA AND OTHER STATES
TAKE THREATENING ACTION.
MAKING DESERTION A CRIME
The Divorce Colony at Sioux Falls ,
According to a Dispatch , Is Liable
to bo Broken up at Any Time by
New Laws Throughout Country.
Pierre , S. D. , Dec. ) . The divorce
industry of Sioux Falls Is likely to
receive a severe jar If a few moro
states follow the lead of Now York ,
Nebraska and Virginia and declare
abandonment of wife or minor chil
dren to bo a felony. He-sides the
three states named , the governors of
several other states have recommend
ed the same laws.
This action makes the offense an
extraditable one , and already Govern
or EIrod has granted several extradi
tion warrants on that charge , and has
several pending. In some of the ap
plications It Is alleged that the person
wanted Is In this state for the pur
pose of securing a divorce , and this
is what will make the "colonies" rus
tle.
tle.With
With an unsympathetic sheriff like
ly to appear to take the divorce appli
cant on a criminal charge , the gai
eties of the colony are likely to bo
rudely broken In upon at any time.

Case of Negro Troops In Philippines
Much Like the Texas Affair.
Washington , Dec.J. . President
Roosevelt has had brought to his at
tention another case in which a com
pany of negro soldiers has refused to

tures the now case is on a parallel
with that which resulted In the dis
charge of Companies D , C and D of

8 last.
First Lieut. Robert B. Calvort , of

a negro regiment , was murdered while

termaster Sergeant Taylor , who has
been twenty-one years In the service ,

vert shortly before the crime was
committed. Ho Is , so far as known ,
the last to see the ofllcer alive. Whllo
ho was In the tent loud words were
heard and shortly afterwards five
shots were fired , all of them striking
Lleot. Calvort , and ono of them pierc
