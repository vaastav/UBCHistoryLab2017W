out on the spot to cattle and hogs.
One man is handling $80,000 worth of
hogs. The farmers are receiving big
prices for corn fed to hogs and cattle,
and the money wXich has already
been paid In has relieved the farmer,
the mechanic, the' manufacturer,
and the merchant, so business is ac
tive. The farmers of that county
believing from present experience
that good rail roads arc profitable in
stitutions, vote almost unanimously to
tax themselves to raise $150,000 in or
der to secure a more direct line east to
Qulncy. It is fearful to contemplate
the heavy tax the farmers of Nebras
ka are paying for the want of railway
communication, the amount of which
can only be realized by comparing the

Hon. Isham Reavis, U.S. Associate
Justice, for Arizonia, arrived at this

that it is as healthy a locality as he

NUMBER THREE.
We present thi9 week a letter from
Jacob K. Bear. It is full of Instruc
tion to the children. We have said
something before to you concerning
the habits yon are now forming, and
of the pertinacity with which they
follow you and control your action as
men erown un. We hone you will
read that letter and ponder over it,
Mr. Bear was a good business man,
He graduated at a commercial school
in Chicago. He was an expert in his
business ; understood it thoroughly in
all its details, and at the time of leav
Ing was making more clear money
with less capital than any other one
man in Brownville. He was receive
Ing a large salary as Telegraph Opera
tor. The U. S. Express Company and
the various Railroad Companies were
paying him well for the transaction of
their business. He was forming bad
habits and going In dissolute and way
ward company. The desire to con
tinue this course grew upon him daily
When remonstrated by his friends, he
said : "Oh ! there is no danger of be
ing led estraj" At this time he
could have easily reformed, and per
haps would have done so, had he real
ly felt that there was danjrer. His
self-confidence led him to disregard
the advice of others. Like too many
others, they think they can drink in
toxicating liquors, chew tobacco, gam
ble and go In company with lewd
women to-day and reform hereafter at
pleasure. In so doing tney underes
timate the power of continued habit
over mankind. We will have less
power of resistance to-morrow than
we have to-day, although the differ
ence may not be perceivable. It was
so with Mr. Bear. He indulged his
passions when, as he says, he knew
he was doing wrong, until the warn
ing of prudence, right, justice and
friends failed to stop him in his down
ward course. This habit thus formed ;
the Indulgence of this passion by
him Impelled him to gamble away
over $2,500 of the funds of the Express
Company. The discovery of this
could not be avoided ; and as he now
sajs, ne plainly saw mat to stay was
but to go to the penitentiary, and to
embezzle more of the funds and leave
would'result In nothing more, aud so
he decided to take the chances of es
cape, rsow, lr you can neiieve mm;
his punishment as an outlaw' from
family, frk nds and society, with the
fear of arrest before his eyes night and
day, Is setting his brain on fire. How
rj porta nt that all our young readers
should form correct habits, avoid bad
practices and bad company. They

most certain to end in ruin.

Qulncy, nrovrmille and Paci
fic Railroad.
The chief Engineer of the survey
ing corps of the Qulncy, Missouri &
Pacific Railroad, has been in town a
portion of the week. Up to Monday
the corps had made a survey of that
road from the west to a point within a
mile or so of this place, striking Big
Creek about three quarters of a mile
above the old "Brady Mill."
The present survey will run on the
ridge south of this place, something
like a half mile from the court house.
The survey progresses very slowly,
the party now having been some
eight or ten days coming from the
west line of the county, and since the
Cth of August coming from Brown
ville. Mr. Smith seems to be a thor
ough and practical surveyor, and Is
determined to make a survey that will
stick.

the road were at Milan, Sullivan

The Capital Removal.
A Washlnfiton dispatch says : The
prospect of removing the capital out
West would appear to have more
strength than the Washingtonians be
lieve. The western members are
pretty well united on the subject, and
it is gaining favor. From ail that I
can learn about the subject, it is very
likely that a trial of strength between
the removers and anti-removers will
come up at next session of Congress.
An appropriation of $3,500,000 is to be
asked for to put up a new building for
the State and War Departments, and
the Western members, It is said, will
nht the proposition at every stage.
The Western men assert that every
additional dollar expended on federal
works in Washington will be made
an argument against removing the
capital, and they are determined to
furnish no more arguments on that
side.
Ben. Butler said to-night that all
sensible men would govern themselves

John Erown.
Ten years ago yesterday, the spirit
of John Brown, which had been
marching on this earth, took its flight
to another world. He was hanged on
the secorid day of December, 1S39. A
mighty work was that done by Brown.
He did not have a world at his dispos
al, neither did he want any of it in
lands or flesh at the disposal of others.
He committed a crime against civil
law, and was hanged for it ; the law
was satisfed, and we doubt not that
John is in Heaven, praying for some
who appear to begoingto--destruction.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Senate and House of Itepre
sentatives: In coming before you for
the first time as the Chief Magistrate
of this great nation, it is with great
gratitude to the Giver of all good for the
many benefits we enjoy.
'
Emenrinir from a rebellion of gl
gantlc magnitude, aided as it was by
the sympathy and assistance of na
tions with which we were at peace
eleven States of the Union were four
years ago left without legal State gov
ernment, a debt had been contracted
American Commerce was almost driv
en from the sea, the industry of one
half the country had been taken from
the control of the capitalist and placed
where nil labor rightfully belonged
in the keeping of the laborer. The
work of restoring State government
loyal to the Union, of protecting and
fostering free labor and providing
means for pavine the Interest on the
public debt, has received ample atten
tion from Congress, although your
labors have not met with the sue
cess in all particulars that might have
been deserved; yet on the whole they
have been reasonably nnticinauu.
Seven States, which passed ordinan
ces of secession, have been fully re
stored to their places in the Union
The eighth, Georgia, held an election
at which she ratified her Constitution
republican in form, elected a Gover
nor, Members of Congress, a State
Legislature, and all other officers re-
ouired. The Governor was duly in
stalled and the Legislature met and
performed all the acts then required
of them by the reconstruction acts of
Congress. Subsequently, however,
in violation of the Constitution which
they Jiad just ratified, as since decided
by the bupreme uourt or the btate,
they unseated the colored members of
the Legislature and admitted to seats
gome members who are aisquaiinea
by the third clause of the fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution, an
article which they themselves had
contributed to ratify. Under these
circumstances I would submit to you
whether it would not be wise, without
delay, to enact a law authorizing the
Governor of Georgia to convene the
members originally elected to the
Legislature, requiriner each member
to take the oath prescribed by the re
construction act, and none to be ad
mitted M ho are ineligible under the
third clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
.
Among the evils growing out of the
rebellion and not yet referred to, is
that of an irredeemable currency: it
s an evil which I hope will receive
your most earnest attention. It is a
duty, and one of the highest duties,
of the Government to secure to the
citizens a medium of exchange of
fixed, un arying value. This implies
a return to a specie basis, and no sub
stitute for it can be devised. It should
be commenced now and reached at the
earliest practical moment consistent
with a fair regard to the interests of
the debtor class, immediate resump
tion, if practicable; it would compel
the debtor class to pay beyond their
contracts the premium on gold at the
date ol their purchase, and would
bring bankruptcy and ruin to thou
sands. Fluctuations, however, in the
paper value of the measure of gold, is
detrimental to the interests of trade.
It makes the man of business an in
voluntary gambler, for in all sales,
when future payment is to be made,
both parties speculate. As to what
will be the value of the currency to
be paid and received, I earnestly rec
ommena to you sucn legislation as
will insure a gradual return to specie
payment, ond put an immediate stop
to nuctuanon in the vaJu of currency
The methods to secure the results are
as numerous as are the speculators in
political economy. To secure the lat
ter, I see but one way, and that is
to authorize the Treasury to redeem its
own paper at a hxed price when
ever presented, to withhold from
circulatiou all such currency redeemed
until sold again for gold.
The Freedmen, under the protec
tion which they have received, are
making rapid progress in learning,
and no complaints are heard of the
lack of industry on their part when
they receive fair remuneration for
their labor.
As the United States 13 the freest of
all nations, so, too, its people sympa
thize with all people strucrKliner'or
liberty and self-government; but,
while sympathizing. It is due to our
honor that we should abstain from en
forcing our views upon unwilling na
tions, and from taking an interested
part, without invitation, in the quar
rels between different nations or be
tween Rovernments and their sub
jects. Our course should always be in
conformity with strict justice and
law, international and local.. Such
has been the policy of the adminis
tration in dealintr with these Ques
tions for more than a year. A valua
ble Province of Spain, and a near
neighbor of ours in whom all our peo-
I)le cannot but feel a deep interest,
las been strupelincr for independence
and freedom. The people and the
Government of the United States en
tertain the same warm feelincrs and
sympathies for the j eople of Cuba In
their pending struggle that they man
ifested throughout the previous struer-
gle between Spain and herformer col
onies in behalf of the latter, but the
cante6t at no time assumed the condi
tions which amount to a war in the
sense or International law or which
would show the exestence of a de
facto political organization of the In
surgents sufficient to justify a recog
nition or bengereucy. The principle
is maintained, however, that this na
tion is its own judge when to accord
the rights of billigerency, either to
people struggling to free them
selves from a srovernment thev
believe to be oppressive or to Inde
pendent nations at war with each
other. The United States have no dis
position to Interfere with the existlne
relations of Spain to her colonial pos
sessions on this continent. They be.
lieve that in due time Spain and oth
er European powers will find their in
terests In terminating these relations,
and establishing the present depen
cies as independent powers and mem
bers of the family nations, the depen
dencies are no longer regarded as sub
ject to transfer from European power
to another. W hen the present rela
tions of the Colonies cease they are to
be independent powers, exercising the
right of choice and self control of their
future condition and relations with
other powers. The United States, in
order to put a stop to blood shed in
Cuba, and in the interest tfa neigh
boring people, proposed their good
offices to bring the exist ing contest to
a termination. The offer not being
accepted by Spain on a basis which
we believe could be received by Cuba,
was withdrawn.
Sensitive people conscious of their
power, are more at ease under a great
wrong wholly unatoned than the re
straint of settlement which satisfies
neither their ideas of justice nor their
grave senses of the grieviences they
have sustained. The rejection of the
treaty was followed by a state of pub
lic feeling on both sides which I
thought not favorable to an Immedi
ate attempt at renewed negotiations.
I, accordingly, so instructed the Min
ister of the United States to Great
Britain, and found that my views in
this regard was shared by her Majesty's
Minister. I hope that the time may
soon arrive when the two Govern
ments can approach the solution of
this moment us question with an as
surance of what, is due to the rights,
dignity and honor of each, and with
the determination not only to remove
the causes of complalntin the past, but
lav the foundation of a broad prlnci
pal of public law, which will prevent
future differences aud tend Xo firm
and continued peace and friendship
This is now the only grave question
which the United States have with
any foreign nation. The question o
a treaty for reciprocity the between U
S. and the British Provinces, on
this continent has not been favorably
considered by the administration
The advantage of such a treaty would
be wholly in favor of the British pro
ducer : "except, possibly, a rew enga
ed in the trade, between the two sec
tions, no citizens of the United States
would be benefitted by reciprocity
our internal taxation would prove
protection to the British producer.
almost equal to the protec ion which
our manufacturers now receive from
the tariff. The same arrangement
however, .for the regulation of com
mercial intercourse between the
United Slates and the Dominion of
Canada may be desirable. The com
mission for adjusting the claims of the
Hudson Bay and Puget's bound Ag
ricultural Company upon tee United
States has terminated its labors. The
award of six hundred and fifty thous
and dollars has been made, and al
rights and titles or .the company on
the Territory of the United States
have been extinguished. .Deeds for
the property of the Company have
been received, An appropriation by
Congress to meet this sum is asked.
Our manufactures are increasing
with wounderful rapidity under the
encouragement which they "how te
ceive with the Improvements in 'ma
chinery already effected and stifi in
creasing, causing machinery to taKe
the place of skilled labor to a large
extent. Our imports of many articles
must fall on largely within a very
few years. Fortunately, too many
manufactures are not confined to
few localities, as formerly, and is to be
hoped will become more aillused, ma
king the interest in them equal In all
sections. They give employment and
support to hundreds of thousands of
people at home, and retain with us
the means which otherwise would be
shipped abroad. The extensions of
railroads In Europe and the East is
bringing into competition with our
agricultural products like products of
other countries ; self-interest, if not
self-preservation, therefore dictates
caution against disturbing any indus
trial interest of the country. It
teaches us, also, the necessity of look
Ing to other markets for the sale of
our surplus. Our neighbors south of
the United States and China and Ja
pan should receive our special atten
tion. It will be the endeavor of the
administration to cultivate such rela
lations with all these nations as to en
title us to their confidence and make
t to their interest as well as ours to
establish better commercial relations
through the agency of a more en
ighteoed policy than that heretofore
pursued toward China. Largely due
to the sagacity and efforts of one of
our own distinguished citizens, the
world is about to commence largely
ucreased relations with that populous
and hitherto exclusive nation. As
the United States have been the ini
tiatory in the new policy, so they
should be the most earnest in showing
their good faith In making It a suc
cess. In this connection I advise
such legislation as will forever pre
clude the enslavement or the Chinese
upon our soil under the name of Cool
ies, and also prevent American vessels
from engaging in the transportation
of Coolies to any country tolerating
the system. I also recommend that
the mission to China be raised to one
of the first class.
On my assuming the responsibilities
of the Chief Magistrate of the United
States it was with the conviction that
three things were essential to our
peace, prosperity and the fullest de
velopment. First among these is
strict integrity in fulfilling all our ob
ligations. Second, To secure protec
tion to the person and property of the
citizen of our common country, wher
ever he may choose to move, without
reference to original nationality, re
ligion, color or politics, demanding of
him only obedience to the laws, and
proper respect for the rights of others.
Third, Union of all the States with
equal rights, indestructible by any
unconstitutional means. To secure
the first of these, Congress has taken
two essential steps ; first, in declaring
by joint resolution, tha the public
debt should be paid, principle and in
terest, in coin : and second, the means,
however, could not secure the object
desired with proper administration of
the laws for the collection of the reve
nues and economical disbursement of
them. To this subject the adminis
tration has most earnestly addressed
Itself with results I believe satisfacto
ry to the country. There" has been
no hesitation in changing officials iu
order to secure efficient execution of
the laws. Sometimes, too, wherein a
mere party view, undesirable political
results were likely to follow. For any
hesitation in sustaining efficient offi
cials against remonstrances, wholly
political, it may be well to mention
here the embarrassment possibly to
arise from leaving on the statue books
the so-called tenure of office act, and
earnestly recommend Its total repeal.
It could have not been the Intention
of the framers of the Constitution,
when providing that appointments
made by the President should receive
the consent of the Senate, that the
latter should have the power to retain
In office persons placed there by Fed
eral appointment against the will of
the President. The law is inconsis
tent with a faithful and efficient ad
ministration of the Government.
Whht faith can the Executive put In
officials forced upon him ; and those,
too, whom he has suspended for rea
sons? How will such officials be
likely to serve an administration
which they know does not trust them?
For the secoi.d requisite to our growth
and prosperity, time and a firm but
humane administration of existing
laws, amended from time to time as
they may prove ineffective cr prove
harsh and unnecessary, are probably
all that are required. The third can
not be attained by special legislation,
but must be regarded as fixed by the
Constitution itself, and gradually ac
quiesced in by force of public opinion
from the foundation of the Govern
ment to the present. The manage
ment of the original inhabitants of
this continent, the Indians, has been
a subject of embarrassment and ex
pense, and has been attended with
continuous experience up on the fron
tiers and the Indian countries. I do
not hold either legislation or the con
duct of the whites, who come most in
contact with the Indians, blameless
for those hostilities. The past, how
ever; cannot be undone, and the ques
tion must be met as we now find it.
I have attempted a new policy towards
these wards of the nation ; they can
not be regarded in any other light
than as wards, with fair results so far
as tried, and which I hope will be at
tained ultimately with great success.
The Society of friends is well known
as having succeeded in living in peace
with the Indians in the early settle
ments of Pennsylvania, while their
white neighbors of other sections were
constantly embroiled, they are also
known for their opposition to all strife,
violence and war, and are generally
noted for their strict integrity and
fair dealing. These considerations in
duce me to give the management of a
few Reservations of Indians to them,
and to throw the burthen of selection
Of agents apon the society itself. The
result has proven most satisfactory.
It will be found more fully set forth,
in the report of the Commissioner of
Indian athurs. For teuperintenaenis,
and Indian agents, not on the iteser-
vations, officers of the army were
elected. The reasons for this are nu
merous. When Indian agent3 are
sent there, or near there, troops must
be sent also. The agent ana tne
commander of troops are independent
of each other, and are subject to orders
from different departments of the
Government. The array officer holds
a position for life, the agent one at the
will of the President. The former is
personally Interested in living in har
mony with the Indians ana in me es
tablishment of a permanent peace, to
the end that some portion of his life
may be spent within the limits of a
civilized section. The latter has no
such personal Interests. Another rea
son is an economical one, and still
another hold which the Government
has upon a life officer to secure a
faithful discharge of duties in carry
ing out a given policy. The building
of railroads, and the access thereby
given to all agricultural and mineral
regions of this country, is rapidly
bringing civilized settlements into
contact with all tribes of Indians. No
matter what ought to be the relations
between such settlements and'theabo-
riginees, they do not harmonize well,
find one or the other has to give way
in the end. A system which looks to
the extermination of the race is too
horrible for a nation to adopt without
entailing upon itself the wrath of ail
Christendom, and engendering in the
citizens a disregard for human life
and the rights of others dangerous to
society. I see no substitute for such a
system except in placing all the In
dians on a large reservation as rapidly
as can be done, and giving them ab
solute protection there. As soon as
thev are fitted for it they should be
induced to take their lands severally
and to set up Territorial Governments
for their own protection. J? or full de
tails on this subject I call yeur especial
attention to the reports of the Secre
tary of the Interior and the Commis
sioner of Indian Aiiairs.
I desire resnectfull v to call the atten-
tion of Congress to the inadequate sal
J y

them, but will specify only the Justi
ces of the Supreme Court, rso change
has been made in their saleries for
fifteen years. Within that time the
