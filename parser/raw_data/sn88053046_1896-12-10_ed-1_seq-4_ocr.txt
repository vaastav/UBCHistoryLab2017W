e President's Message.
President Cleveland's message, print
ed elsewhere, is one of the most' able
and interesting State papers ever sent
to Congress. Ita completeness of tone
is admirable,and its calm, conservative
sentiment worthy of ail praise. The
consideration given the Cuban situation
in the message is peculiarly gratifying
in its trend and conclusion. There, is
nothing of tho jingo about it It
describes the situation as it exists, and
points out with judicial impartiality
the course that this government should
pursue. "When the inability of Spain to
deal successfully with the insurrection
has become manifest," writes Presi
dent Cleveland, "and it is demonstrated
that her sovereignty is extinct in Cuba
for all purposes of its rightful exist
ence, and when a hopeless struggle for
its re-establishment has degenerated
into a strife which means nothing more
than the usoioss sacrifice of human life
and the utter destruction of the very
Bubject-matter of the conflict, a situa
tion will be presented in which our ob
ligations to tho sovereignty of Spain
will be superceded by higher obliga
tions, which we can hardly hesitate to
recognize and discharge. Deferring the
choice of ways and methods until the
time for action arrives, we should make
them depend upon the precise con
ditions then existing; and thoy should
not be determined upon without giving
caroful hoed to every consideration
involving our honor and interest,or the
international duty we
Until we face the contingencies sug
gested, or the situation is by other
incidents imperatively changed, we
should continue in the line of conduct
heretofore pursued, thus in all circum
stances exhibiting our obedience to the
requirements of public law and our
regard for the duty enjoined upon
by the position we occupy in tho
family of nations. "
And then President Cleveland adds
that when tho time arrives, the exi
gencies of the situation "will constrain
onr government to such action as will
subserve tho interests thus involved
and at the same time promise to Cuba
and its inhabitants an opportunity to
enjoy the blessings of peano. "
The financial and economic opinions
expressed in tho message are also admir
able in sentiment and sound in
elusion. The President expresses faith
in the Wilscn Tariff bill, and a
fidence that ita operations will produce
a revenue ample for the needs of tho
government, if
extravagantly wastod. " Ho points out
that tbo operations of the measure have
boeti fairly satisfactory, even under
the most unfavorable conditions, and
that good results may bo expected in
the futuro. There is small comfort for
the radioal "tariff rippers" in this
portion of the message.

The
kly »otter of Hsmbleton &
Co., bankers, of Baltimore, which is
always clear, poeitivo and interesting
in ita review of national affairs, takos
on a very pleasant and enuouiaging
tone last week. It bb.vb:
After the first of the year we look for
a foreign demand for our securities and
improved prices. This is because we
that Congress will bo more
believe
conservative than is generally
pected. Before and after the election
is a very different affair. Before the
oloction Congress was going around
with a chip
Bomeono to knock it off, W
going to fight England about a phantom
boundary line between British Guiana
and Venezuela, we threatened to tako a
hand in the Armenian question and to
force the passage of the Dardanelles
with a diminutive gunboat; and, as for
tho Spanish-Cuban difficulties, we
proposed to give Spain notice that she
must conquer the rebels in sixty days
or else we should want to know the
reason why.
It is needless to say that all this was
an exhibition of jingoism of the Bom
bastes Furioso style and only meant that
a Presidential election was at hand.
Well, the election is over and
expect. our law-makors, with the
exception of those of tho Morgan-Till
man stripe, to join in the Christmas
refrain of "Peace on earth, goodwill
to man."
The tariff and currency questions
will largely occupy the next Congross,
and there is also anothor question of
almost equal importance which should
receive the earnest consideration of our
law-makers, and that is economy. Wo
hear a groat deal about a deficiency in
the revenue, but very little of tho reck
less and extravagant appropriations
which have so largely increased the
expenses of the government. While the
statement of

000,000 greater than for tho same
months last year, 811,000,000 of it is
duo to increased expenditures, so that
when Congress tackles tho question of
an insufficient revenuo, we hopo the
other end of the consuming candle- the
expenditures, will not bo overlooked.
The demand for economy on tho part
of Congress is becoming national in
its scope. The people aro directing
their attention to the real cause of the
deficit in the treasury, and aro not
pleased at tho suggestion to continue
the extravagances and covor the doficit
by means of increased taxation.
The path of economy is the path that
Congross should tread. This policy,
coupled with sound financial legisla
tion, will give relief to tho country,
restore confidence and make tho times
prosperous. It will be well for Con
gress to give heed to these things.

St Mt« Grange.
SpodalCommpondeuce of Gamut* and Jmirtiai
Dec. 9.—The 22d annual
meeting of the Delaware State Grange,
Patrons of Husband;y, opened In the
Kent county Court House yesterday at
noon, with Worthy Master S. H. Mes
sick of Bridge villa in the chair and
representatives present from all but
two or three granges in the State.
The delegates from New Cnstle county
Charles W. Day, Cecil Hopkins,
Arnold Naudain, Jr., and Dr. T. A.
Neal.
Most of the officers made verbal re
ports, all of which were encouraging.
The annual address of Worthy Master
Messick was decidedly interesting. In
tho nourso of his remarks he stated
that ignoranco and prejudice in this
State are being superseded by intelli
gence and judgment. Men and women
being better trained in tho culling,
lie urged a united effort to promote
tho welfare of 1119 order in-the State.
Tho work of tho yeur was reviewed.
Among other things ho suid :
"An earnest effort was made last
winter to revive the order, especially
in tho central and lower part of the
Htato. In Kent county M. T. Newton
canvassed tho neighborhood where
mootings were to bo held and advertised
thorn, aud in Sussex county Wesley
Webb was au esteemod colaborer in the
field. Milford Grange has boon reor
ganized during tho year. Efforts were
made in other places, some of which
give some promise of success. 1 am
firmly improHEod that the groat need in
Delaware is a thorough canvass by
officient organizers in order to secure
meetings in which the work and
mission of the order shall be plainly
and intelligently sot forth.
"Our co-operative buBinesB arrange
ment have Buffered much because of tbo
stringency of the times, though many
patrons still appreciate the advantages
of co-operative buying. I am informed
that in the State whoie tho order
flourishes most, special importance i
attached to tbo cause of education
the grange.
"Competition in foreign products
nevor
would entor tho competition should
know that farming is becoming more
anti more a scientific business. He who
would capture and hold the most profit
able market must be able to produce
tho best aud the cheapest. A thorough
discussion of tho very question of farm
management by practical farmers in tbo
grange must develop tho strong and tho
weak points ami should present many
expensive blunders which may bo
infinitely more healthful than tho sav
ing of a small per cent in purchases ;
and thiB is in line with the pecuniary
advantages of the grange,
"The advantages offered by Dolawnre
College should be kapt before the
peopln of our Stale. A satisfactory
appreciation of the bulletins of tbo
oxperimont station and the scientific
discussions often found in farm papers
.'ell as profitable appreciation of tbo
discussion of many of our grango aud
other farm meetings depends upon just
such knowledge us is offered at Delà
Cullege. Members of our order are
not unmindful of the benefits
receiving of the work from tho Experi
mental station.
"It would
nary prudence for a Rtate to protect by
suitable legislation its interests from
speedy destruction by contagious dis
eases Increased legislation for the
protection of domestic animals from
deadly disease and our fruit interests
from such dangerous foes as the peach

imperatively to be needed.
"A reduction of tho salaries and
fees of many of our officials to conform
more neurly to the profits of those
engaged in tho ordinary pursuits. Tbo
purification of our elections seems to
be sorao of the other subjects that
should receive tbo most serious
attention of our people aud the coming
Legislature.
"Tho people of our State in tbdir
growth and expansion beyond their
fermer limit of material wealth and
intelligence are seeking higher
dations of development and have de
clared themsolves in favor of changes in
their organic law.
"Allow
that tbo new Constitution should as a
matter of just and right explicity pro
vide that the Legislature may submit
the question of licensing tho sale of
intoxicating liq
tho vote of tho peopl
"I believe the new Constitution
should be submitted to the people at a
special election for their ratification
and tbut a denial to the people of that
right would bo dangerous inprecedent
and revolutionary in itilluenoe, and I
am impressed that it should bn so sub
mitted that part might be ratified and
other parts rejected.
"It would

weil
agitatioo. With such opportunity for
usefulness with such momentous
questions to be settled for tho futuro
prosperity of the State, tho grnnge
should not come to a stand still for
something practical to do."
The following committees were ap
pointed by tho worthy master:
Credentials— O. C. Hopkins, U. R.
Wilson and James Brown.

necessary, and it is likely that before
the adjournment of the
several important
will be made.
