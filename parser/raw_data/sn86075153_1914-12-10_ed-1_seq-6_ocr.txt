F OLLOWING is President Wil
son's annual message, deliver
ed at the beginning of the
short term of the Sixty-third
congress:
Gentlemen of the Congress—The ses
sion upon which you are now entering
will be the dosing session of the Six
ty-third congress, a congress, 1 ven
ture to say, which will long be remem
bered for the great body of thoughtful
and constructive work which it has
done in loyal response to the thought
and needs of the country. 1 should
like in this address to review the nota
ble record and try to make adequate
assessment of it, but no doubt we
stand too near the work that has been
done and are ourselves too much part
of It to play the part of historians to
ward it
Moreover, our thoughts are now more
of the future than of the past. While
we have worked at our tasks of peace
the circumstances of the whole age
ha ve been altered by war. What we ha ve
done for our own land and our own
people we did with the best that was in
us. whether of character or of intelli
gence. with sober enthusiasm and a
confidence in the principles upon which
we were acting which sustained us at
every step of the difficult undertak
ing. But it is done. It has passed from
our hands. It is now an established
part of the legislation of the country
Its usefulness, its effects will disclose
themselves in experience. What chief
ly strikes us now. as we look about us
during these closing days of a year
which will be forever memorable in the
history of the world, is that we face
uew tasks, have been facing them
these six months, must face them in
the months to come—face them without
imrtisan feeling, like men who have
forgotten everything but a common
duty and the fact that we are repre
"WE NEED SHIPS; WE HAVE
NOT GOT THEM."
The United Statee, thie great
people for whom we speak and
aet f should be ready as never
before to serve itself and to
serve mankind; ready with its
resources, ite energies, its forces

distribution. * • * We ere

sources at once. We are not

which we have stunted and hin

we need ships, we have not got

sentatlves of n great people whose
«bought is not of us, but of what Amer
ica owes to herself and to all mankind
in such circumstances as these upon
which we look amazed and anxious.
War has interrupted the means of
trade not only, but also the processes
of production. In Europe It Is destroy
ing men and resources wholesale and
upon a scale unprecedented and ap
palling. There is reason to fear that
the time is near, if it be not already at
band, when several of the countries of
Europe will find it difficult to do for
their people what they have hitherto
been always easily able to do—many
essential and fundamental things. At
any rate, they will need our help and
our manifold services as they have
never needed them before, and we
thonld be ready, more (It and ready
than we have ever been.
AMERICA FACES NEW
MARKETS FOR TRADE
Merchant Marin« Must Ba Built Up to
M««t Opportunity.
It is of equal consequence that the
nations whom Europe baa usually sup
plied with Innumerable articles of man
ufacture and commerce of which they
are in constant need and without which
thair economic development halts and
stands still can now get only a small
liait of what they formerly imported
and eagerly look to na to supply their
all but empty markets. This is partic
ularly true of our own neighbors, the
states, great and email, of Outrai and
Booth America. Their lines of trade
have hitherto ran chiefly athwart the
seas, not to our porta, hut to the porta
of Great Britain and of the oider con
tinent of Europe. I Be not atop to in
qoh» why or to make any eomment on
prob a b le causes. What interests na

kets which we must supply, and we
must find the means of action. The
United States, this great people for
whom we speak and act, should be
ready as never before to serve Itself
and to serve mankind, ready with its
resources, its energies, its forces of
production and its means of distribu
tion.
It Is a very practical matter, a mat
ter of ways and means. We have the
resources, but are we fully ready to
use them? And, if we cau make ready
what we have, have we the means at
band to distribute it? We are not
fully ready; neither have we the means
of distribution. We are willing, but
we are not fully able. We have the
wish to serve and to serve greatly, gen
erously. But we are not prepared as
we should be. We are not ready to
mobilize our resources at once. We are
not prepared to use them immediately
and at their best, without delay and
without waste.
To speak plainly, we have grossly
erred in the way in which we have
stunted and hindered the development
of our merchant marine. And now,
when we need ships, we have not got
them. We have year after year debat
ed, without end or conclusion, the best
policy to pursue with regard to the
use of the ores and forests and water
powers of our national domain in the
rich states of the west, when we
should have acted, and they are still
locked up. The key is still turned
upon them, the door shut fast at which
thousands of vigorous men, full of
initiative, knock clamorously for ad
mittance. The water power of our nav
igable streams outside the national
domain also, even in the eastern states,
where we have worked and planned
for generations, is still not used as it
might be, because we will and we
won't; because the laws we have
made do not Intelligently balance en
couragement against restraint We
withhold by regulation.
I have come to ask you to remedy
and correct these mistakes and omis
sions, even at this short session of a
congress which would certainly seem
to have done all the work that could
reasonably be expected of it The
time and the circumstances are ex
traordinary, and so must our efforts be
also.
Fortunately two great measures, fine
ly conceived, the one to unlock, with
proper safeguards, the resources of the
national domain, the other to encour
age the use of the navigable waters
outside that domain for the genera
tion of power, have already passed the
house of representatives and are ready
for immediate consideration and ac
tion by the senate. With the deepest
earnestness I urge their prompt pas
sage. In them both we turn our backs

as a whole, and we as c learly owe the
other in fulfillment of our repeated
promises that the water power of the
country should in fact as well as in
name be put at the disposal of great
industries which cau make economical
and profitable use of it, the rights of

vented. To have begun such measures
and not completed them would indeed
mar the record of this great congress
very seriously. I hope and confidently
believe that they will be completed.
SELF
GOVERNMENT FOR
FILIPINOS IS URGED.
President Says Senate Should Pass
Measure Now Before Senate.
And there is another great piece of
legislation which awaits and should re
ceive the sanction of the senate. 1
mean the bill which gives a larger
measure of self government to the peo
ple of the Philippines How better in
this time of anxious questioning and
perplexed policy could we show our
confidence in the principles of liberty
as the source as well as the expression
of life; how better could we demon
strate our own self possession and
steadfastness in the courses of justice
and disinterestedness than by thus go
ing calmly forward to fulfill our prom
ises to a dependent people, who will
now look more anxiously thau ever to
see whether we bave indeed the liber
ality, the unselfishness, the courage,
the faith we have boasted and profess
ed? I cannot believe that the senate
will let this great measure of construc
tive justice await the action of another
congress. Its passage would nobly
crown the record of these two years
of memorable labor.
But 1 think that you will agree with
me that this does not complete the toll
of our duty. How are we to carry our
goods to the empty markets of which
I have spoken if we have not the
ships? How are we to build up a great
trade If we have not the certain and
constant means of transportation upon
which all profitable and useful com
merce depends? And bow are we to
get the ships if we wait for the trade
to develop without them? To correct
the many mistakes by which we have
discouraged and all but destroyed the
merchant marine of the country, to re
trace the steps by which we have, it
seems almost deliberately, withdrawn
our flag from the seas, except where,
here and there, a ship of war Is bidden
carry it or some wandering yacht dis
plays it, would take a long time and
involve many detailed items of legis
lation, and the trade which we ought
Immediately to handle would disap
pear or find other channels while we
debated the items.
The case is not unlike that which
confronted us when our own continent
was to be opened up to settlement and
industry, and wé needed long lines of
railway, extended means of transpor
tation prepared beforehand, if develop
ment was not to lag intolerably and
wait interminably. We lavishly sub
sidized the building of transconti
nental railroads. We look back upon
that with regret now. because the sub
sidies led to many scandals of which
we are ashamed, but we know that
the railroads had to be built, and if
we had it to do over again we should
of course build them, but in another
way. Therefore I propose another
way of providing the means of trans
portation. which must precede, not
tardily follow, the development of our
trade with our neighbor states of
America. It may seem a reversal of
the natural order of things, but It is
true, that the routes of trade must be
actually opened—by many ships and
regular sailings and moderate charges
—before streams of merchandise will
flow freely and profitably through
them.
SAYS
SHIPPING BILL
IS VERY IMPORTANT.
It Should Be Paaaed to Profit by Open
ed Gates of Trade.
Hence the pending shipping bill, dis
cussed at the last session, but as yet
passed by neither house. In my judg
ment such legislation Is imperatively !
needed and cannot wisely be postpon- !
postpon
ed. The government must open these
gates of trade, and open them wide,
open them before It is altogether profit
able to open them or altogether rea- I
sonable to ask private capital to open 1
them at« venture. It is not a question
of the government monopolizing the
field. It should take action to make »

of
a
1
it certain amt twutepnrtanon at rea
sonable »tee will be promptly pro
vided, even where the carriage la not
at first profitable, and totjgu when the
carriage haa become sulfitientiy profit
able to attract and engage Private cap
ital and engage it to abundance, the
government ought to withdraw. I
very earnestly hope that the congress
will be of this opinion and that both
houses will adopt this exceedingly im
portant bill.
The great subject of rural credits
still remains to be dealt with, and it
is a matter of deep regret that the dif
ficulties of the subject have seemed to
render it impossible to complete a bill
for passage at this session. But It can
not be perfected yet, and therefore
there are no other constructive meas
ures the necessity for which I will at
this time call your attention to, but
I -would be negligent of a very manl
iest duty were 1 not to call the atten
tion of the senate to the fact that the
proposed convention for safety at sea
awaits its confirmation and that the
limit fixed in the convention itself for
its acceptance is the last day of the
present month- The conference In
which this convention originated was
called by the United States. The rep
resentatives of the United States play
ed a very influential part indeed In
framing the provisions of the proposed
convention, and those provisions are in
themselves for the most part admira
ble. Tt would hardly be consistent
with the part we have played in the
whole matter to let It drop and go by
the board as if forgotten and neglect
ed. It was ratified in May last by the
German government and in August by
the parliament of Great Britain. It
marks a most hopeful and decided ad
vance in international civilization. We
should show our earnest good faith to
a great matter by adding our own ac
ceptance of it.
COASTS OF ALASKA
SHOULD BE SURVEYED.
Present Dangers to Navigation Ought
to Bo Removed by Chart«.
There (s another matter of which 1
must make special mention, if I am to
discharge my conscience, lest it should
escape your attention. It may seem a
very small thing. It affects only a
single item of appropriation. But
many human lives and many great en
terprises bang upon it. It Is the mat
ter of making adequate provision for
the survey and charting of our coasts.
It is immediately pressing and exigent
in connection with the immense coast
line of Alaska, a coast line greater
than that of the United States them
selves, though it is also very impor
tant Indeed with regard to the older
coasts of the continent
We cannot use our great Alaskan
domain, ships will not ply thither, if
those coasts and their many hidden
dangers are not thorough ly surveyed
and charted. The work is incomplete
Ot almost every point Ships and lives
have been lost in threading what were
supposed to be well known main chan
nels. We have not provided adequate
vessels or adequate machinery for the
survey and charting. We have used
old vessels that were not big enough
or strong enough and which were so
nearly unsea worthy that our inspectons
would not have allowed private own
ers to send them to sea. This is a
matter which, as I have said, seems
small, but is In reality very great Its

GOVERNMENT ECONOMY
IS VERY IMPERATIVE.
Urges Systematic Reorganization to
Gain Greater Efficiency.
Before I close may 1 say a few
words upon two topics much discussed
out of doors upon which it is highly
Important that our judgments should
be dear, definite and steadfast?
One of these is economy in govern
ment expenditures. The duty of econ
omy is not debatable. It is manifest
and imperative. In the appropriations
we pass we are spending the money
of the great people whose servants we
are—not our own. We are trustees and
responsible stewards in the spending.
The only thing debatable and upon
which we should be careful to
-our thought and purpose clear is the
kind of economy demanded of us. I
assert with the greatest confidence
that the people of the United States
are not jealous of the amount their
government costs if they are sure that
they get what they need and desire for
the outlay, that the money is being
spent for objects of which they ap
prove and that it.is being applied with
good business sense and management
Governments grow piecemeal both
in their tasks and in the means by
which those tasks are to be performed,
md very few governments are organ
ized, I venture to say, as wise and ex
perienced business men would organize
them if they had a clean sheet of paper
to write upon. Certainly the govern
ment of the United States Is not I
think that it is generally agaoed that
there should be a systematic reorgani
zation and reassembling of its parte
so as to secure greater efficiency and
effect considerable savings in arpm»
But the amount of money saved in that
way would, I believe, though no doubt
considerable to itself, running, it may
be, into the millions, be relatively

of the country itself, there must come,
of course, the Inevitable increase of ex
peuse. The sort of economy we ought
to practice may be effected, and ought
to be effected, by a careful study and
assessment of the tasks to be per
formed, and the money spent ought to
be made to yield the best possible re
turns in efficiency and achievement.
And. like good stewards, we should so
account for every dollar of our appro
prtations as to make it perfectly evi
dent what it was spent for and in
what way it was spent.
It is not expenditure but extrava
gance that we should fear being criti
cised for. not paying for the legiti
mate enterprises and undertakings of
a great government whose people com
mand what It should do. but adding
what will benefit only a few or pour
ing money out for what need not have
been undertaken at all or might have
been postponed or better and more
economically conceived and carried
out. The nation is not niggardly: it Is
very generous. It will chide us only
if we forget for whom we pay money
out and whose mouey It is we pay.
These are large and general standards,
but they are not very difficult of appli
cation to particular cases.

Speak« Plainly and Directly on Quae
tien of National Defenses.
Tbe other topic I shall take leave
to mention goes deeper into the prin
cipies of our uatioual life and policy
It ia tbe subject of national defense.
It cannot be discussed without first
answering some very searching ques
tions. It is said In some quarters that
we are not prepared for war. What is
meant by being prepared? Is it meant
that we are not ready upon brief no
tice to put a nation In the field, a na
tion of men trained to arms? Of
course we are not ready to do that,
and we shall never be in time of peace
so long as we retain our present polit
leal principles and Institutions. And
what is it that it is suggested we
should be prepared to do—to deféud
ourselves against attack? We bave al
ways found means to do that and
shall find them whenever it is neces
sary without calling our people away
from their necessary tasks to render
compulsory military service in times
of peace.
Allow me to speak with great plain
ness and directness upon this great
matter and to avow my convictions
with deep earnestness. 1 have tried
to know what America is, what her
people think, what they are, what they
most cherish and hold dear. I hope
that some of their finer passions are in
my own heart—some of the great con
ceptions and desires which gave birth
to this government and which have
made the voice of this people a voice
of peace and hope and liberty among
the peoples of the world, and that,
speaking my own thoughts. 1 shall, at
least in part, speak theirs also, how
ever faintly and inadequately., upon
this vital matter.
We are at peace with all the world.
No one who speaks counsel based on
fact or drawn from a just and candid
interpretation of realities can say that
there la reason to fear that from any
quarter our Independence or the integ
rity of our territory is threatened.
Dread of the power of any other na
tion we are incapable of. We are not
jealous of rivalry in the fields of com
merce or of any other peaceful achieve
ment We mean to live our own lives
as we will, but we mean also to let
live. We are. indeed, a true friend to
all the nations of the world, because
we threaten none, covet the posses
sions of none, desire the overthrow of
we
I
I
sions of none, desire the overthrow of
none.
Our friendship can be accepted and
is accepted without reservation, be
cause it is offered in a spirit and for
a purpose which no one need ever
question or suspect. Therein lies our
greatness. We are the champions of
peace and of concord. And we should
be very jealous of this distinction
which we have sought to earn. Jnst
cow we should be particularly jealous
of it, because it is our dearest present
hope that this character and reputation
may presently, in (rod's providence,
bring us an opportunity such as has
seldom been vouchsafed any nation,
the opportunity to counsel and obtain
peace to the world and reconciliation
and a healing settlement of many a
matter that baa cooled and interrupt
ed the friendship of nations. This is
the time above all others when we
should wish and resolve to keep our
strength by self possession, our influ
ence by preserving our ancient princi
ples of action.
From the first we have had a clear
and settled policy with regard to mili
tary establishments. We never have
bad, and while we retain our present
principles fnd Ideate we never shall
hav«f » large standing army. If asked,.
Are yon r ea d y to defend yourselves?
we reply. Moat assuredly; to tbe ut
most And yet we shall not turn
America into a military camp. We
will not ask.our young men to spend
the beat yeas» oi their fives making
soldiers of themselves. There is an
other scat of energy In ns. It will
know how to declare Itself and make
itself effective.should occasion arise.
And especially when half the world is
on fire we «ball be careful to make our
' moral Insurance against the spread of
the conflagration very definite and cer
, tnln and adequate indeed.
: Let us remind ourselves, therefore,
; of the only thing we can do or will do.
We must depend In every time of na
tional peril., in toe future as In the
past not upon « standing army nor yet

POWERFUL NAVY IS

United Statee Will Continue to Remain
Strong on the Seat.
A powerful navy we have alway«
regarded as our proper and natural
means of defense, and It bas always
been of defense that we have thought,
never of aggression or of conquest
But who shall tell us now what sort
of navy to build? We shall take leave
to be strong upon the seas In tbe fu
