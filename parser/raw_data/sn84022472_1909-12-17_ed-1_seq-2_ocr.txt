SCORES TAFT FOR
GOING BACK ON
TEDDY'S POLICIES
Mladlaon. Wis.. Dec 17. "If the
President expects to advance the
Roosevelt policies he will do well to
go bout it promptly and not leave
Congress and the public to infer, as
they well may after the experience of
the extra session, that he is awaiting
the program of Aldrlch and Cannon."
In these words. United States Sena
tor - LaFollette closes an editorial
sharply criticising President Tait and
his recent niesrage In this week's is
sue of LeFolette's Magazine.
The editorial, referring to the Pres
ident's message to the tariff session,
says, in part: 1
"Everywnere thoughtful men were
anticipating a great statement. Sena
tor and Representatives sat with fix
ed attention as the clerk began to
read President Taft's first message to
Congress. At the end of two minutes
the clerk stopped. It was over. Men
looked Into each others faces In
amazement.
"The one thing especially emphasis
ed ' In the brief executive note waa
that with regard to the bualnesa In
terests until the tariff bill shou'd be
passed. The exactions from which the
people sought escape though revision'
continue upon the more Important
articles of general use the rates were
Increased and prices are steadily ad
vancing. '
"The people elected Mr. Tart In the
belief that he would hold fast to all
that Roosevelt had gained for the pub
lic. , The people were anxious to see
In definite official form bis declaration
for legislation. A feeling of uncer
tainty preval'a. The tariff was a bad
Job and the Ballinger situation grows
more and more tense, as the truth is
known. - -
"On Tuesday. ODwc 1, President
Taft's message on general legislation
waa presented to Congress and the
country. The message is allent where
it should have been vlgorona
"For the 'Roosevelt p" Idea Con
gress and the people must await his
(Taft's) further action. Until then, let
ua hope that now. as when ha pre
pated his speech of acceptance, he Is
giving his beat thought to the prac
tical constructive work of devising
ways and roeana by which the high
level of businexa Integrity and obedi
ence to law" which Mr. Roosevelt has
established may be maintained."
