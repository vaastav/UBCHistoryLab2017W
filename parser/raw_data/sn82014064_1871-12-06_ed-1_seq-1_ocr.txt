ton wn r ' TBB SENATE COMMITTEES.
takni ■Washington, Dec. 6.—The Republican mom
cm . sof the Senate will hold a caucus to-morrow,
prcf; reorganize the standing committees. Inas
much as these committees were overhauled last
spring, there will be but few changes made, and
these mainly to accommodate newly-elected Sen
ators. The movement to restore Sumner to the
Chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Commit
tee is practically dead. Cameron Is so vain of his
new position that bo desires to keep it, and he
will be sustained by tho same votes which
elected him last spring. Senator Trumbull has
Buggestedlhat the Retrenchment Committee be
revived, and there is considerable talk of
adopting this suggestion and putting Schurz in
.as Chairman. There has been considerable com-
plaint, lately, against tho Pacific Railroad Com
■ miuoc, and its abolition is recommended. It is
asserted that the necessity for this committceno
pn. longer exists, and that its reputation for fair
all pub...mg is not so good that it can he continued
selves. 3Jyas an ornament.

quired oi the troops. Such a measure would add
very much to the efficiency, and would rarely, if
ever, carry the aggregate strength of the active
army above the standard of SO.ooomennow tlxed

POSTAL BILLS.
jßfclr. FABNSWORTH ,from the Post Office Com
mittee, reported a bill to revise, consolidate ami
amend the statute relating to the Post O r -ie De
partment. He stated that it was the same bill
which passed the House at the lust Congress
The postal laws had never been codified since the
organization of the department, and many of
them had become obsolete, while others were
contradictory and difficult of explanation. The
clerk proceeded to read the hill, which is very
voluminous.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The reading of the bill was interrupted by the
expiration of the morning hour, when the House
went into Committee of ihe Whole on tho Presi
dent's message. The usual resolutions distribut
ing poitlons of the message among appropriate
comi .ixteess were offered by Mr, DAVIS, and
adopted.
Before a vote was taken, Mr. WOOD inquired
whether tliere was any such committee as the
Committee on Insurrectionary States ?
. Mr. DAWES replied that there was a committee
which went by that name, and which was raised
last-session for the purpose of considering tho
subject which it was now proposed to refer to it—
HieKu-Klux outrages,
_ - Yr. WOOD said this committee was brought
iu-iri-dl.-iHxistenco for the purpose of visiting ihe
States to do certain things. When that
had reported to tho House it hud no
Xo/hluin-.-f functions. He was, therefore, opposed to'
hgit for a whole Congress in this eurrep
comm k-i manner.
.Tip EoF-DAWES stated, to reply to Mr. Wood, that
iirrrh °®' UlUii toe was coustltut-
JljTi,. It should vouUnue during tho
dci'.i: hut even it that were notso,

who pad expired. .
< pci-h*? WOOD protested against the continuance
„ clunmitlee which was not only useless hut
, /.’. Ajotive of disorder and distraction through
\ jfbc country.
k -'. uaM-- RANDALL thought tho question of the
ICCVJ .IV’B of the telegraph and postal service and all
i:.*'! . lotions of subsidies should go to the Committee
■ i- i- ’ommerce, er the Post Office Committee, in
i i .\t ' select committees. He had seen enough
[j.« in ii select committees to consider special
i .Vo '/m w He remembered that when tho urat
'.! rut apl
YOLTJME 25.
Pacific Baflroad committee was CRtablished. tha
Speaker of the House made it up iu. the interest
of the road, and that the committee traa prepared
to give asray all the land of the nation. p cparc<l

L, S? l i!V;; T t0 . CB ?' iltl " 11 rully, It was this subject.
Mr.MBLACK suggested that the project would
cntalllmioeneepntronage on the administration,
“Avo, the appointment of at least
%take charge of tho telegraphic
ousmesi, wnieh fact made the pioposition an ap
palling one to him, and would control hia vote
against It.
Mr. FARNSWORTH understood that it was pro
posed to Incori>orulo with every coosecuti ve Post
Office in the country a telegraph office, and to
muho every Postmaster a telegraph operator, or
elseLto appoint an expert to operate tho tele
graph. The government would tuu} have cogni
zance of all private, coutidential, and linaaoial
business of the people. Every member of Con
gress would be Importuned by his constituents to
make their Post Office a telegraph station. The
Post Office Committee had been appointed with
out reference to This subject, and might there
fore he presumed as fair as one appointed
specially. He was willing to admit that he hud
gone over tho whole subject, aud was against tho
proposed measure. Tho success of the system iu
Urcat Britain or any thickly-settled old country,
■where no new Post Office had been established
for fifty years, formed no criterion for this coun
try. Tho whole thing was monstrous iu any way
It could bo regarded.
Mr. BANKB remarked that the question of
ocean cables was in tho jurisdiction of tho For
eign Committee, and moved that that point be
stricken from the pending resolution.
•Mr. DAWES assented, and the resolution was
so modified.
Mr. BANKS thought it best for the Interests of
tho country to avoid special committees when
ever there was a permanent standing committee
to whom a subject could bo referred.
Mr. BECK, member of the special committee of
the last Congress, said the cost aud effect of the
project had been understated. There were now
five thousand stations In tho country, with 77 000
miles of line and 7,000 employes. Under the gov
ernment plan there would be at least 20,000 tele
graph offices, 150,000 miles of lino, and 25,000 em
ployes. He believed the proper committee was
that of Appropriations, who would bo careful in
recommending anything that would take from the
people not $36,000,000, but nearly 570,000.000. He
clidnotbelieve.that committee would over sanc
tion such a scheme, or even consider it for a mo
ment.
Mr. RANDALL wished to stop thia sohemo of
plunder at the threshhold. Ho was informed that
originally the whole of tho telegraph lines did not
cost over two or three millions, and now the com
pany hud the affrontcry to ask Congress to take
us property at the present appreciated value.
He would oppose the scheme, because it would
place the whole private andbusiness transactions
of tho people under the scrutiny of government
officials. He hoped tho House would squelch tho
thing ut once.
Mr. DAWES did not understand that any pro
ject was rccommeuued. The statement by Mr.
Randall, that the telegraph company asked Con
gress to purchase its property at an enormous
rate, showed that the gentleman did not under
stand the relations of tho mutter more than a
baby. Tho Western Union Company was array
ing itself, with all its power and influence,
against any such proposition.
Mr. BECK remarked that while tho Western
Union Company opposed the project in the last
Congress, ho under«toodtbal it had changed its
position, and now’ Is anxious for it.
Mr. DAWES said . that fact did not commend
the matter to his approval, but this is not the
lime to enter upon tho merits of tho whole sub
ject.
After further discussion by' Messrs. PALMER
and GARFIELD in favor, and Messrs. CONNOR
and KING against a special committee, it was re-
Itired-r-ico tv 98 —to tho Committee on Appro
priations.
TUB NEW LOAN.
Mr. COX moved the reference of the portion of
the message relative to the now loan to the Com
mittee on Bunking. Rejected, and the subject
left to tho B aya and Means Committee.
RESIGNATION.
The commltte rose, when the resignation of Mr.
Washburn, of Mussachueects, was presented.
LABOR BUREAU.
A resolution was adopted for an inquiry into
the expediency of an establishment of a Labor
Bureau in connection with the Department of Ag
riculture, with a view to the compilation of sta
tistics, and more complete recognition of the
rights of the laboring classes.

HOUSE REVENUE DILL.
W Springfield, ILL, Dec. 6.—Tho Revenue bil
came up in the House to-day, and Mr. Short mad
a very lucid explanation of its provisions, which
was listened to with much attention. Some -of
tho provisions of the bill relative to taxing mon
eys, etc., have not his approval, but tho majority
of tho committee favored them. An. attempt to
wait until tho Stenato Revenue bill came to them
in on amended form, and give the House bill the
go by, was almost unanimously yoted down, and
there is very little question that some time or'
other the House will pass Short’s bill in about lt«
present form. An attempt was made
to strike out tho provision by
which - tho residents are compelled to list for tax
ation, all personal property outside of tho Stito,
hut it was so decidedly beaten as to indicate that
there is little chanco of bettering the harsher pro
visions of the hill. Tho afternoon was consumed
in tho discussion of the exemption section, to
which public libraries were added, but attempts
to specify other things which are covered by tho
bill os it Is, like parks, was defeated.
CHICAGO EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY.
Tlio Senate, to-day, passed the bill making ap
propriation for the Chicago Eye and Ear Inttrma
ry. There is no objection to ic In the House. That
body also passed tho bill to put up a stone pillar
at the centre of each county, and defeated one
prohibiting the putting of notices on fences, Ac.
FEE BILL.
Mr. Bangs introduced a carefully-prepared bill
to fix the fees of county officers and classify the
counties. Three classes are made, tho first con
taining 20,000, the second between 20,000 and
70,000, and the third exceeding 70,000, which is in
Cook County only. The fees of 1815 were aiopted
as a maximum lor first-class or counties where
tho heaviest fees are allowed, and reduced de
cidedly for second oud third classes.
CAMPBELL’S COUNCIL BILL.
■When Campbell’s bill to create au upper House
in Chicago comes up, an amendment will be

COOK COUNTY BILLS.
There arc now so many special orders on tho
calendar that it is hard to tell when tho Cook Coun
ty bills will be reached. It does not now seem as
il any would be passed before Christmas.
RECORDING IN COOK COUNTY
The following is the bill introduced by Senator
Woodard on the subject of Recording in Cook
County,to which there seems to bo no objection in
the Senate.
AN Act to red* co the fees of Clerks of Circuit Courts
(who arc cx-ojfie(o Recorders of Deeds) la comities
containing a population of seventy thousand and up.
ward, and infix a compensation lor said Clerks;
uud to provide for the payment of all fees, perqui.
sites, and emoluments, above the amount of said
compensation, into tho County Treasuries.'
Section 1. Me it enacted by the People of the State
oj JUtnoit, rejrretmted in the General Ag*emblu, That
hemdter the Clerks of tho Circuit Courts, (who are
ca-opicto Recorders of Deeds), aud In counties contain
me a population of seventy thousand and upward,
which shall bedoaignatedaa counties of the third clou,
shall be allowed the following fees, viz.: ForroconlW
tul deeds, mortgages, powers of attorney, or other in.
struments of writing, or making any copy thereof, for
every one hundred wonts. o cents ; ami no fee shall
be allowed for indexing and filing.
fcEC. 2. All fees, or allowances, received by said
clerks. In excess of *2.600, which sura Is hereby fixed
as a full Compensation for tho yearly salary of said ofii
cer, shall be paid Into tho County Treasuries.
SEC. 3. ; The number of tho Deputies and assistants
of said Clerk shall bo determined by rule of the Circuit
Court, to lie entered of record, and their compensation
shall be determined by tho County Board: Provided,
that said compensation shall be paid out of. and never
exceed, the fees of the office actually collected.
5-r.c. -i . All laws or pans of laws coufiicUug with tho
provisions of this act are hereby repealed.
feEC. 5. By reason of tho destruction of the records of
deeds in one or more counties, of the class herein
designated, and which records must bo restored at u
great and unnecessary expense, as the fees are now*
used by law, an emergency exists, requiring that this
act should co into effect immediately; therefore this
act shall take effect and bo in force from and after its
passage.
FEES AND SALARIES.
It appears to be the intention of the House
Committee on Fees and Salaries to prepare one
bill which shall cover the entire subject entrusted
to them. Therein, they will fix all salaries from
those of the Governor down, and will regulate
fees of every officer in the Stole. There is no
doubt that it la much better to have the whole
matter embraced In one act. It makes a much
better appearance, and la decidedly more conven
ient, but there is a question of expediency -to bo
settled. It will bo exceedingly difficult to pass
such a bill, for the reason that it concentrates
such an amount of opposition and will tako so
much time to be passed. By breaking up this bill
into ten, each covering but a few officers. Ibis op
position is greatly divided abd weakened, and
some of these bills will pass without a contest,
and sqmethingwillhavc been done on the subject.
It is the choice between half
a loaf at once, or the possibility of no loaf at all,
a choice which is constantly recurring in legis
lation. The Senate has decided to do something
at oneq. The House Committee proposes to do
something hereafter. ‘Whether the House will
sustain them, it is as yet impossible to say.
Mr. Sullivan introduced a bIU this morning to
to regulate fees of county officers, dividing coun
ties into six classes, whereas the constitution ap
pears to coniine the number of classes which the
Legislature can make to three.
LOST RECORDS.
Of the two bills introduced this morning by
Mr. King, of Cook, Uio one in regard to restoring
records, was prepared by a committee embrac
ing among its members Judge J. M. Wilson
and I. If. Arnold. This bill, which
is very long, provides for the appointment by the
Governor of a commission; who shall procure, by
purchase or otherwise, from abstract men or
others, all the evidences of title they enn, and
have them recorded. The bill further provides a
form of proceeding, beginning with u petition
Hied by the owner of the property. The other bill
is drawn up by the Hon. Emory Washburn, and
also provides for the appointment of Coimulsslon
crh.
LIGHTHOUSES.
A letter to Governor Pahuor from Colonel O.
M. Poe, on duty with the Lighthouse Board,
shows the importance of immediate action by the
State to give the Federal Government power to
obtain land in this State. An appropriation was
made last year for a lighthouse near Evanston,
and the board are ready to go on with the work
when they can secure the laud. If they do not
begin by June 30 the appropriation will lapse.
ABSENTEES.
The House was remarkably full this morning,
the only Cook County absentees being Dixon,

REVENUE BILL.
The House went into Committee of the Whole
on the House Revenue hill, and Mr. SHORT
spoke, explaining the provisions of the bill, and
showing at length, and plainly, the importance
or taxing the property of a corporation, and also
its shares.
The Senate amendment to the House Resolu
tion, giving to United States Judges in the North
ern District, copies of the Statutes of Illinois, &0.,
was concurred in.
The Revenue bill was resumed, and Mr. Short
continued hia explanation of its provisions, with
some of winch, relative to taxing money, &c., he
la not in accord. The provision doing away with
the Shoe Board of Equalization, he defended.
P faifr «d the way In which Mr.
SHORT had made his report on the revenue,
and stated the principles of his bill, which was
far briefer than the old law. * lie believed that
real property should bear its burdens and pre
vent heavy impositions as personal property, and
the Inquisitorial way in which they were made.
Nothing should be done in forcing men to dis
close their business to the public. Ho approved
of the idea of holding out inducements to manu
facturers by rather relieving them from taxa
tion, and of relieving foreign insurance com
panies from taxation, so as to bring In foreign
capital.
Mr. SPRINGER said the Senate committee bad
outdone ther Revenue bill, until it was briefer
than the House bill. Ho therefore suggested
that action be postponed, until the Henuto bill
was received, and taat the House amend that.
Mr. SHORT thought the House was aolo to
make a bill for itself, without getting outside
purtlet-|:o do it. After waiting uyear, it was time
lor the House to do something.

tion, which received only two or three votes.

The House went into Committee of the Whole
on the revenue Mil.
Mr. CUMMINGS moved to strike out the pro
vision taxing personal property belonging to resi
dents of the State kept or used temporarily out
of the State.
Mr. SPRINGER opposed the amendment, since
people living on the borders of the Stale would
bank outside of the State, and their property
would escape taxation.
Mr. CUMMINGS wanted to tax only property
within the State, for that was all they could con
trol.
Mr. JOHNSON opposed tho amendment, since
the people along the Mississippi transferred per
sonal property to liwa to escape tax.
Tho amendment was lost.
The exemption list was read.
Mr. KING, of Cook, offered an amendment
specifically exempting from taxation school lauds
of cities,towns and villages; the bill exempting
only school lauds belonging to tho State or
county. Aftera long discussion the amendment
was adopted, which satisfied Mr. King.
A motion was made to exempt public libraries.
Mr. SULLIVAN moved to modify by exempting

there were none in the State. After a long dis
cussion, and some fighting, Air. Sullivan's amend
ment was lost.

libraries and all-private libraries not used for
professional purposes or. profit. Lost.

Columbia, B. C., Dec. s.—ln the Ku-Klur trial
to-day, Stanbcrry, for the defence, moved to
quash the indictment against Crosby and others,
upon the grounds that the persona injured are not
mentioned in the indictment; that the grand

facts; • that the Indictment was defective,
staling a deprivation of tho right to
vote as,taking place at a future date; that the
constitution and laws do not secure any citizen
the right to vote, and that tho State, not the Fed

complained of. Stanberry argued for two hours
in support of bis objections. Linder, for tho gov

Paris, Dec. 5.—A bill authorizing an Increase
in the circulation of tho Bank of Franco will be
introduced in tho Assembly, probably this week.
The National Assembly effected an‘organiza
tion to-day, by re-electing President Grevy and
the Vice Presidents of tho last session.
The report that Thiers had sent u message to
tho Assembly was premature, although its con
tents are known. It has not yet been receivedor
published. It is rumored that Thiors withholds
the- document because ho is averse to
declaring himself in favor of the admission
of tho Orleans Princes to tho Chamber, and some
avowal on this point is expected in the forthcom-
mg message, more especially as it is supposed
that ho has received notification that the Princes
intend to, claim their right to seats us iegally
cJeeted representatives of the people. Tho status
of the Orleans Princes promises to be ono of tho
leading questions before thq Assembly. Bills
restoring to them their contlscatod estates and
all their rights as citizens of France
arc preparing, and will bo introduced
at an early duy. It is anticipated that those
measures will give rise to long and exciting de
bates. Tho extreme left wing will meet tliom
with propositions for a general amnesty, which,
setting tree the thousands of Communists still
hem prisoners in the hulks and elsewhere, will be
considered only an equitable compliment of the
act of Justice proposed to be done to tho house of
Orleans.
La Jtcpuhliiftte Francaise, a radical organ, says
the Leit will not take the initiative in moving the
rciurn of tho Assembly and government to Purls,
hut there is no reason to doubt that tho removal
•will be effected during this session of tho Legis
lature. °
A decree appears, this evening, appointing M.

Paris, Dee. s—Evcning-Thiers appears to
have up his mliul to oppose tho
admission of the Orleans Princes to tho
National Assembly, for tho Princes to-duy
waited upon Thiers for the purpose of listening
to an exposition of tho reasons influencing him
against their taking scats in the Legislature, and
of endeavoring by argument to change his decis
ion. Tho President received tho Princes courte
ously, but, owing to tho pressure of public busi
ness. was unable to hear or reply to them to-day.
He, however, appointed an interview for Friday
next, at which time lie will be prepared to de
velop fully his reasons for restraining them
from taking seats in tho Assembly.
Paris, Dec. 5.—A great- fire occurred to-day in

MONEY.
New York, Dec. s.—The rates for money open
ed easy at cto 7 per cent, but toward the close
of hank hours tho market became more active,
and stock brokers freely paid 7 per cent in coin.
Currency Is leaving tbo city for the cotton and
pork-packing sections, but not in sufficient vol
ume to cause tho present activity in' tho market
nor to neutralize the effect of the Treasury coin
disbursements, which within a week have now run
up to $10,000,000, simply on account of the redemp
tion of the 5-203. Tho real oauae of the activity
is that about $4,000,000 of legal-tenders have boon
locked up by speculators for a decline in prices
on the Stock Exchange.
GOLD
sold at 110 this afternoon for tho first time this
year. This morning efforts were made to break
It, but they failed, and this afternoon
two brokers combined and accomplished
tbo object long desired by tho
bears. A largo number of bets were ponding on
the result, and tbo price was kept at the lowest
point long enough to make assurance doubly
sure. As soon as 110 was marked on tho Indicator
the excitement broke oat, nud was accelerated
by a rush of operators to tho room. A large num
ber of orders had been lying in abeyance, waiting
for this point to bo reached, and instantly bids
were made on all sides, and in largo amounts.
Some few lots were purchased, but tho stiffness
of the price prevented the filling of many of the
orders. At one time the quotation was 109 7*B,
but no actual sales weie made under 110. At the
close the price was no 1-8. The rates for carrying
were 5,6, and 7 per cent.

THE STOCK MARKET
was steady. Western Union was tho feature, and
.very active all day. In the morning tho price
touchcdj M 7-8, and then, after recoding to

& St. Joseph was the next most active
stock on the list, but the fluctuations were small.

ly, by tho great exertions of the citizens. Mr.
Plutt, brother of the landlord of tiro Platt
House, was sick with the tj-phoid fever in tho
hotel, and was removed to another house, where
he died within five minutes after his arrival.
Ofoor two parlies suffered loss by tho removal
of their goods. Mr. • Blanchard was burned out
in tho Great Fire of Chicago, and now loses about
11,000 by this new disaster. But, fortunately, the
bu J k^,? f , llls Btock vratt in South Clark street
establishment, where ho had reopened his busi
ness. For thirteen years past ho has been wide
ly known as one of tho most reliable and exten
sive map manufacturers in this city. The total
loss by the lire at Wheaton he estimates at about
$5,C00.
A Dishonest Servant.
A boarder at No. 281 Michigan avenue dropped
his pocket book, containing Hoo, on tho floor, the
other day, and, not being aware of tho fact, neg
leeted to pick it up. Frank Gibbons, a servant fix
the house, however, who saw the money holder
did pick.it up, and clandestinely left the place’
throwing up his situation without giving the
landlady the customary "warning.” When the
loss of the money became known, Gibbons was
missed, and as lie did not make his appearance It
was conoluded that both had disappeared to
gether. A policeman was notified, but nothing
wns seen of Gibbons until yesterday, when ho
was observedby the officer sauntering along State
street arrayed. .In an entire new suit of gar
ment*. including boots, hat, and gloves. He was
immediately arrested, and, upon being taken to
the First Precinct Station, S4O were found In his
pocket., It is thought ho intended to purchase an
oroide watch and chain, for. with that addition
to his outfit, he would have been a veritable "ser
vant-girl killer,” which he aspires to bo. His
success in keeping tho money was not equal to
histakingit; lienee that brand-new suit will be
spoiled In tbo jail, and, Ina short time, exchanged
for robes of unbecoming "stripes.”
Burned to Death.
A •woman named Kate Ahern, who lived with
her husband at No. 41 Mary street, was burned
to death on Monday evening. The exact way la
which her clothes caught lire is unknown, as she
was alone in the house at the time, and was not
found-imtll she had been dead several hoars.
From the appearance of tilings in the kitchen, it
is thought that she was cooking at the time of the
catastrophe. While leaning over the stove, being
somewhat Intoxicated at the time, her clothes
must have ignited, Perceiving the flames, she
attempted to reach the street door, but
her dress, being of very light material,
burned so rapidly that the fire reached
her throat before she advanced many steps, and
she was suffocated. Her body, burned to a crisp,
was found near the door of a neighbor after life
had been extinct several hou«. She is reported
to have,been fond of whiskey, having frequently
been arrested for Indulging to excess. Her bus-
is employed In an Archer avenue
packinghouse, is also addicted to strong drink,
and was intoxicated on Monday evening. Ho and
his wife were seen drinking together on that day.
Mrs. Ahern leaves two cmldrem both of whom
are grown and are employed as servants in fam
ilies living near the scene of the horrible accident.
Exit and Entrance.
Probably no head of a large city ever came into
office less ostentatiously than did MayorMediUon
yesterday. Tho ceremony consisted of tho en
trance of Mr. Rledill into the room Jointly occu
pied by the Mayor, his policemen, the Comptrol
ler, his numerous clerks, the Corporation Coun
sel, and about twenty other persons connected
with the Relief and Aid Society. A
short conversation with his predecessor fin
ished Mayor Medill’s induction into office.
Tho four anouymous-looklng Individuals, who
are named Mayor’s staff, looked with lengthened
countenances upon Mr. Mason’s retreating form,
and prepared themselves for tho shock—which
did not ccme, however, as tho Incomer announed
hlsintentlon of leaving the “ staff”as It was,
with ouo exception. Taken as a whole, tho ac
cession to office was u dramatic failure.

Business nt the Post Office*
If there has been a decrease in the amount of
business done in Chicago the past month, certain
ly the Post Office is not the place to look for proof

small excess over any previous month in the his
tory of the cltv Post Office. These are the fig

Pair Dealing.
It gives us pleasure to state that tho agents of
some of tho insurance companies that suffered
largely by tho Chicago fire are settling promptly

won golden opinions from tho policy-holders of
that company. It pays in full. Among Eastern
