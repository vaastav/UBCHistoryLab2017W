Washington-, Dec. 3.— The message
of President Cleveland to Congress i3as
follows:
To tht Congress of the United Statrt: Tbe
assemblage within the nation's legislative balls
of those charged with Hie duty of unking laws
for tbe beueui of a geuerous and free Deopie
impressively suggests the exacting obligation
■no Inexorable lesponsibility involved in their
usk. At the iliresbuld of sucb 1 now to be
undeftaK n by tbe Congress of tbe Unit d
State*, and In the di«ch igeof au rxecutlve
duiy enjoined by tbe constitution, I submit tills
communication containing a brtel statement of
ifce condition of our national affairs and recom
mettoii!- oucb le-nslaiion as seems to me neces
saiy and expedient.
I'urpijn Itela tl-iiia.
The blstory of our recent dealings witb other
nations and our peaceful relations with lb' tv at
this time additionally demonstrates tbe advaui
aee of consistently adhering to a firm but Just
foreign policy, free trom envious or ambitious
national schemes and cbaiactei ized by etitue
bon<-sty aud sincerity.
Dnrlog tbe past year, pursuant to a law of
Congress, commissioners were appointed to tbe
Antwerp Industrial Exposition. '1 houeb tbe
participation of American exhibitors tell far
snort of completely illustrating our nation >l
Ingenuity ana Industrial achievements, yet it
was quite ciedl':.ble iv view of the brief time
allow, v for preparations,
I have endeavored to Impress upon tbe
Belgian Government the neeulessnessaud post
uve mtr.lness of its res'rictlous upon .ilia
importation of certain of our food products, and
have strongly urged th.it the rigid supeivisiou
aud inspection under our laws are amply suf
ficient to preveut tbe exportation from ibis
country of diseased cattie aud unwholesome
meat.
x'nttce In Brazil.
Tbe termination of the Civil War in Brazil
has been followed by the geueral prevalence of
peace and oider. It appearing at an early '
rtage or tbe insurrection ibai its course would
call for miusu 1 watchfulness on tbe tait o(
mi«i ni« < uiiifDt, our nay l force, in the harbor
of Rio de Janeiro was strengthened. This pre
caution, lam satisfied, tended to restrict the
l«sue to simple trial of strengtb betw;- n the
Brazilian Gt»verun>ent and the Insurgents, and
to avert coiDplleatlona winch .t times seem-d
tmmin nt. Our linn altitude of neutrality was
maintained to the end. The Insurgents received
ihe encouragement of eventual asytum from
our commanders and sucii opposition as t bey
encountered wufor ih-* piorection of our com
merce and was clearly ju-aiti d by public law.
A serious tensipu of relations bavlog arisen at
the c'o*e of ihe war between Brazil aud Port
neal by reason ol tlie escape of the Insurgent
admiral. De Gama, and his followers, th'
frienaiy offices of our representatives to those
countries weie exerti d for the protection ot the
subjects of either within me teinioiy of tue
Other.
Although the Government of Brazil was duly
notified tiiat t(jf commercial arrangement ex
isting between the United Spates and that couu
try 1) -ed on tbe ihlrd section of tlie lariff act
of 1890 was abrogated on August 28, 1594, by
tbe taking effect of tbe rarifi lan in force, th.it
Government subsequently notified us of its iu
teution to tennluaie such ariangemeui on tbe
first day of January, 1895, in tbe exe«cl*e of
th- right ie-e;ved In the agreement betweeu
the two countries. I Invite attentiou to ttie
correspondence betweeu lb- Secretary of State
and the. Brazilian Minister on this subject.

end ol tbe i em.d stipulated for Its coDtiunance,

China and Japan.
On tbe 17th of Match the new treaty with
Obina in fu>ther regulation of immieration was
feigned at Washington, aud ou August 13 it
received the sauctiou of the Senate. Ratifica
tion ou tbe i ait of China and formal exchange
are awaited to give eneet to this mutually uen
ificlal coDveniiou.
A gtatifying recognition of tbe uniform Im
pattlality of this country towaid all foreign
Mates was manifested by the coincident request
of the Chinese and Japane«e Governments that
the agents of tbe United States should, within
proper limit, afford protection to th subjects
of other nations dining tbe suspension of diplo
matic relations due to a state ot war. This
delicate office was accepted, and a tnlsappre
beusion, which gave rise to me belief that In
afioruiug tl is kindly unofficial protection our
agems would exercise ib same autliori;y
which the w i:!niiitwn ac/enis of the belligerents
tad exercised was promptly corrected.
Alihough the war between China aud Japan
endangeis no policy of the United States it de
ceives our gravest consideration by reason of
its disturbance ot our growing commercial In
tfiestsin tbe two countries aud the incieased
aangeis which may result to our citizens uomi
ciled or sojourning in the Interior of China.
Acting tind. i a stipulation in our treaty with
Korea (>he first coucluded with a Western
1 owei), 1 felt constrained at the beginniug of
tbe connoversy to lender our good offices to
induce an amicable arrangemeut on the initial
aitliculty growing out of tlie Japanese mauds
lor administrative reforms in Korea; but the
unhappy prectptictlou of actual hostilities de
feated this kindly purpose. Deploring tu<- de
structive war between ihe two most powerful
of itie Eastern nations, aud anxious that our
conunerci.il interests in those countries may be
preserved and that tlie safety ot our cltiz us
tueie shall not be jeopardized, I would no: hes
itate to heed any iutimailou that our Iriendly
aid for the honorable termination of hostilities
would be acceptable to both belllaerenis.

as to leave no doubt of the depth and sincerity
of cvi attachment. The resolutions passed by
the Senate aud House of Representatives on

widow of I'resideut Carnot.
Acting upon the reported discovery of Texas
f vex tv cargoes of Americau cattle i tie German
prohibition against impoitations of live stock
and fresh meats from this country has been I
revived. It Is hoped tbat Germany will soon i
become convinced that the inhibition is as
needless as it is harmful to our mutual ln
t re.-ts. The German Government his pro
tested against ihai provision of the customs
tuiifl act which Imposes a discriminating duty
of niie-teuth of a cent a pound on sugai's
coming from countries paying anexnort bouuty
tb«reou, claiming* that the enaction of s Ucn
duty Is in coiitraveniiou of articles V aud IX of
the treaty of 1876 with Prussia. In Hie in
teiests of the commerce of both countries and
to avoid even ihe accusation of treaty violatiou
I recommend the repeal of so much of the
statute as imposes that duty and 1 invite atteu
tion to the accompanying report of tbtt Secre
tary of State c iitaining a discussion of tbe
questions raised by the German prolestants.
England 1* Frivndly.
Early in the present year an agreement wa9
reached with Great Britain concerning instruc
tions to be given to the naval commanders of
the i wo tovi-inments in Beiiug Sea and the
contiguous North Pacific Ocean, for their culd
iiuoe iv tue execution ot the award of the Paris
Tribunal of Aibitratiou i.nd the eufoicemeut
of the regulations therein prescribed for the
proieetion of seal lite In the waters mentioned.
&v understanding has also been reacUed;foj;
the payment by the United States of §425,000
In full sail-action of all claims which may be
made by Great Kiltalu for damages growing
out of the controversy as to fur *eals iv Berlug
Sea for the seizure of British vessels engaged
in taklug seals in those waiers. Tlie award
and findings of the Pans Tribunal to a great
extent determined the facts and pilnciple*
upon which ttiese claims should be adjusted,
and they have been subj cted by botu goveru
ments io a thorough examlnHtlon upon the
principles as well as tbe facts which they in
volve. 1 am convinced that a settlement upou
the terms mentioned would be au equitable aud
advantageous oue and I recommend that pro
vision be made jor the prompt payment of the
stated sun-.. Thus far only Irauce and Portu
gal nave sijiuitied their willingness to adhere to
the regulations established under the award of
the Paris Tribunal of Arbitration.

The bouudury of British Guiaua still remains
in dispute between Great Britain and Venezu
ela. Believing that Its eaily settlement on
some just b;t^is alike honorable to boih partit
is iv ihe line of our established policy to re
move from this hemispheie all causes of dif
ference with powers beyond the sea, 1 shall
reuew the efforts heretofore made to briuj;
about a restoration of diplomatic relations be

to arbitration, a resort which Great Britain so
conspicuously favors in principle and respects
Iv piacticu aud which is earnestly sought by
her weaker adversary.
Littlfl About Hawaii.
Since communicating the voluminous corre
spondence in regard to Hawaii, »ud the action
taken by the Seuat<- and House of Representa
tlves ou certain question* submitted to the
judgment and wider discreiion ot Congress, the
organization of a Government Iv place of the
provisional arrangemeut which followed the
deposition of tbe Queen has been aunouueeu
with evidence of Its effective opeiatlou. The
recognition usual la such cases has been ac
corded tlie new Governm ut.
Under the present treaties of extradition
with Italy miscarriages ot justice have oc
curred owing to the refusal of that Goverument
to surrender its own subjects. Thus far our
efforts to negotiate an amended cony ntlon ob
viating this difficulty have beeu unavailing.
»w 'tlnpauHM* Treaty,
Apart from the war in whicb their em
pire is engaged Japan attracts Increasing at
tention in this country by her evident de«lre to
cultivate more liberal intercourse with us and
to s ek our kiudly aid In furtherance of her
laudable desire for complete autonomy in her
domestic attairs aud full equality in the family
of nations. The Japanese empire of to-day is
no longer the Japan of tbe past, and our rela
tions with thts progressive nation should not be
less broad aud liberal than those with other
powers.
Good Will to Hvxico.
Good will, fostered by many Interests in com
mon, has marked our relations with our uearest
southern neighbor, peace being r> stored
along her northern frontier. Mexico has asked
tbe pnnisbment of the Ut- disturbers of her
tranqui.lity. There ought to be a uew treaty of
couiu.eice and navigation with that country to
take tbe place of ihe one which terminated
tbliteen years ago. The frieudlioeas of. trie in
tercourse between the two countries is attested
by tbe fact that during this long period the
commerce of each has steadily iucreased under
the rule of mutual consideration, being neither
stimulated by conventional atrangeinents nor
retaided by jealous rivalries or selfish distrust.
Au iudemnity leudeiea by Mexico as a gra
cious act for the muider in 1889 of I.eon Bald
win, an American citizen, by a band of maraud
ers in Durango, has been accepted aud is be. 112
paid in in-laiiuieiits.
The pioblem of the storage and use of the
waters ol tbe Bio Grande for irrigation sbould
be solved by appropriate concurrent action by
the two iiiteiested countries. Rising In (be
Colorado heights, the Ktieani flows inteiinit
tently, yleWHug little water during the uiy
mouths to the Irrigating channels already con
stiuctea aloug its course. This scaicity is
often severely felt in tbe regions where the
1 ivci foiuis a common boundary. Moreover,
the frequen: changes in its course through lev
els often raise embarrassing questions of terri
torial jurisdiction.
Nicaragua. Kules.
Prominent among the questions of the year
w.:s tbe Bluefields incident in what is known as
the Mosquito Indian Btrip, bold, ring ou tbe
Atlantic ucean, and within the jurisdiction oi
Nicaragua. By ih« ireaty of 1860 betweeu
Great Britain and Nicaragua, the former Gov
ernment expressly recognized the sovereignty
of (be latter over the strip, and a limitea lorm
ol self-noverument was guaranteed the Mos
quito Indians, to be exercised according to
Iheir custom, foi hemselves and other dw 11
--eis within its limits.
Tho so-called v live Government, which grew
to be largely made up of aliens, for many years
disputed the sovereignty of Nicaragua over the
strip nun claimed tbn right to maintain tb re
in a practically independent municipal covern
meut. Early tv the past years tue- ettorts of
Nicaragua to maintain sovereignty over the
Mosquito territory led to serious disturbances,
culminating in tbe ttutpression of the native
Goverument and tbe attempted substitution of
an iiupiacticable composite adniini«tiation, in
which Nicaragua and alien residents were to
participate. Failute was followed by an insur
r c ion whicb for a time subverted Nicrnagu n
rui- , expelling her officers and restoring the
old organization. This In turn gave place to
the existing local government established and
upheld by Nicaragua.
Although ihe alien Interests arrayed against
Nicaragua in these transactions have been
largely American, and the commerce of tbat
rejjiou for some time bus been and still is
chiefly controlled by our citizens, we cannot
for that reason challenge the rigb lul
sovereignty of Nicaragua over this Important
part ol her domain. For some months one
and during part of the time two of our naval
ships have been stationed at Rlueiields for tbe
protection of all legitimate interests of our
citizeus. Iv September last the Government at
Managua expelled from its territory : he or
more foieigners. including two Americans, for
alleged participation iv seditious or revolu
tionary movements against the republic at
Bluetields already mentioned, but tbiougn tbe
earuesl renioustrance of lull Government the
Americans have beeu permitted 10 return
to the peaceful mauiigement of their business.
Our naval commanders at the scene of these
disturbances, by their constant exhibition of
In mn< ss and good judgment, contributed
largely to the prevention or more s.- nous con
sequences and to the restoration of quiet aud
oruer.
I regret tbat in tbe midst of these occureuces
there happened a most grave aiui lrritatinc;
failure ol Nicaraguan justice. An American
ciiizeu named Wilson, residing at Jiatr..-, la
the Mosquito territoiy, was muidered by one
Arguello, the acting Governor of the town.
Alter some delay 1 tie muiderer was arrested
but so iusecuiely confined or guarded that he
escaped, and notwithstanding repeated de
mands it is claimed ihat his recapture has been
Impossible by reason of bis flight beyond
Nicaraguan jurisdiction.
The Nlcaraguan authorities having given
notice or forfeiture of the concession to the
canal company on grounds purely technical
and not embraced in tbe couti acts have receded
from that position,
Peiu, I regret to say. shows symptoms of do
mestic disturbance due probably to the slow
ness of her recuperation from the distresses of
the war of 1881. Weakened In r sources, her
difficulties 111 facing international obligations
invite our kindly sympathy nnd justly our
forbearance In forcing long -pending claims.
I have felt constralued to testify this sym
pathy in connection with certain demauds
urgently preferred by other powers.
l)«ath of th.> Czar.
The recent death of the Czar of Russia called
forth appropriate expressions of sorrow and
sympathy on the part of our Government witii
bis bereaved family and the Russian people.
As a further demonstration of reciprocal friend
ship, our Minister at St. Petersburg was di
rected to represent our Government at the
funeral ceremonies.
Trie sealing interests of Russia In Behring
Sea aie second only to our own. a modus
vlvendl was, therefore, concluded wllh the Im
periai Government restrictive of poaching ou
the Russian rooKei les, and of sealing in water*
which wer ■ not comprehended In the protected
area defined In the Paris award.
Occasion has been found to urge upon tbe
Russian Government equality of treatment for
our great life insurance companies whose oper
ations have been extrnded throughout Europe.
Admitting as we do foreign corporations to trans
act business in the United States, we naturally
expect tol ranee for our own in tbe ample
of competition abroad.
But few cases of Interference with natural
ized citizens returning to Russia have been re
ported during tbe currcut year. One K:ze
ininski was wrested last summer In a Polish
province ou a reported charce ol unpennttied
renunciation of Russian alleclance. but it
transptied that tho pi oceedluus originated in
alleged malfeasance committed by Kizeminskt
while ii n imperial officer, a number of years
ago. Efforts for his release, which promise to
be successful, were in progress when his death
was reported.
About Autonia £z-tn.
The Goverument of Salvaor having been
overthrown by an abrupt popular outbreak,
certain of us military and civil officers, while
hotly pursued by Infuriated Insurgents, sought
r fuge ou board the Uuited States warship Ben

Although the practice of asylum is not favored
by this Government yet. Iv view of

Spanish Inj ■<■■■.
Unreasonable injustice Imposed by Spain on
the vessels and commerce of the Uuited States
have demanded from time to ttme uuriug the
last twenty years c rnest remoustrauce ou the
part of our Government. In the immediate
past exorDitant penalties have beeu imposed
upon our vessels and goods by customs author
ities of Cuba and Porto Rico for clerical errors
ot the most trivial character in the manifests
or bills of lading. In so:n cases lines amount
ing to thousands of dollars have been levied
upon cargoes or the carryiug vessels wheu the
goods in question were entitled to fiee entry.
Fines have been exacted even when the error
was detected and the Spautsu authorities no
tified before the arrival of the goods in port.
This couduct is in strange contrast with tbe
considerate and liberal treatment exteuded to
Spanish vessels and cargoes in our ports fu like
cases. No satisfactory settlement of ihese mo
mcutotiH questions has beeu yet reached.
Th/ Mora case referred to in my last annual
message remains unsettled. From diplomatic
correspondence on this subject, which has been
latd before the Semite, it will be seen that this
Government has offered to conclude a conven
tion with Spain for the disposal by arbitration
of outstanding claims betwen the two coun
tries, except, the Mora claim, which, havlug
bfeii long ago adjusted, now only awaits pay
! rnents as atlpnlatea, ndof course It could not
be included in tbe proposed convention. It
I was hoped that this ofter would remove the
parliamentary obstacles encounteied by the
Spanish Government in providing payment of
thr> Mora indemnity. I regret to say that no
defluite reply to this off r has yet been made,
ami all effort!) to secure the payment of this
settled claim have been unavailing.
JLaiv to ihe Porte.
In my anuual message I adverted to the
claim ou tbe part of Turtcey of 'he rmtit to ex
pel, as persons undesirable and danceious,
Armenians naturalized In the United Stales
and returning to Turkish Jurisdiction. Numer
ous questions iv this relation have arisen.
Wnile this Government acquiesced in the
asserted rights o! expulsion, it would not con
sent that Armenians may be Imprisoucd or oth
eiwi*e punished lor no other reason than that
of having acquired, wiiiiout Imperial consent,
American citizenship.
Three of tlie assailants of Miss Melton, an
Ameiican teacher iv Mosul, have D-en con
victed by the Ottoman courts, aud I am ad
vised that au appeal against the acquittal of
the remaining five has been taken by the Turk
ish prosecuting officer.
A convention has been concluded with Vene
zuela for the arbitral lou of a long-disputed
claiiu growing oui of tbe seizure of certain ves
sels, ihe property of citizens of the Unned
States. Although signed, the treaty of extra
dition with Venezuela is not yet In force, owing
to the insistence ol that Government that when
surrendered its citizeus ohall in no case b£ lia
ble io capital punishment.
Collisions at Sea.
The rules for tbe prevention of collisions at
sea, which were framed by the Maritime Con
ference held In this cliy iv 1889, having been
concurrently incorporated In the statutes of ihe
United States and Great Britain, have been an
uouueed to taKe effect Marcb 1. 1895, and in
vitations have ben etided 10 all maritime
nations to adhere to them. Favorable responses
have thus far been received from Austria,
Fiauce. Portugal, Spain aud Sweden.
'!)■<* iDiuii Imbn>: i<>.
In my las annual message I referred briefly
to ihe unsatisfactory state of atlatrs iv Samoa,
under tlie operation of the Berlin treaty, as
signally illustrating the Impolicy of entxßgliug
alliances witb loreign powers, and on May y,
1594, iv response to a resolution 111 the S -nate,
I scut a special message and documents to that
body on the same subject, which emphasized
my previously expressed opinions. Later 03
--enrrences, the correspondence In regard to
which will be laid betore Cougiess, further
demonstrate ili.il the Government, which was
devised by the thiee powers and forced upon
the Samoaus agnluxt their Inveteiate hostility,
can be maintained only by tbe continued pres
ence ot foreign military force and at uo small
sacrifice of life and treasure.
The suppression of the Mataafa insurrection
by the powers and the subsequent banishment
of the leader and eleven other chiefs, as recued
iv my last message, did not bring lasting peace
to the islands. Formid.ibleuprisings continued
and finally a rebellion broke out iv the pi to I
■ island,- Upolu, headed at Aana in tbe western
distiict by tbe youuger Ttimasese and in Attia.
the eust-ru district, by other leaders. Tue in
surgents ravaged the country ana fought tlie
Government's troops up to the v iy doors ot
Apia. Tbe King again appealed to the poweis
lor help, and the combined British and German
naval iorces reduc d tlie Atuans to apparent
subjection, not, however, without considerable
lobs to the natives. A few days later Tamaseie
and bis adherents, feaiing the ships and the
marines, professed submission.
Bepoi ts received from our agents at Apia do
not justify the belief that ihe peace thus
', brought about will be of long duration. It. is
their convictlou that the uatives are, at heart,
hostile lo the preseut Government, ihat such of
them as profess loyally to It do so from fear of
the powers, and that it would speedily go to
pieces- if the warships were withdrawn.
In reporting to his Government on the 'in
satisfactory Bituatlou siuce th* suppression of
the late revolt by foreign armed forces, the
German Consul at Apia stated: "That peace
will be lastiuu is h idly to be presumed. The
lesson given by firms on Aiua whs not suffi
ciently sharp aud incisive to leave a lasting
impiessiou ou the forgeiful tSainoan tempera
ment. Iv fact, conditions are existing which
show that peace will uol last and Is uot seri

chiefs are couvinced thai the departure of the
warshli'S will be a signal tor the leuewal of
war. Tbe circumstance that tlie representa

were opposed to tbe Government have already
withdiawn to Atua to hold meetings, and ihut

sid- of the Gnveini'ient to return 10 their vil

the latter, indicates Hut a ival couctliatiou of
the parties is still far off. .
Aud in a note of the 10m ulf., inclosing a
piece ol tn.il report for the Information of tills
Government, the Gerniau Euibassador said:
"The contents of the report awakened 111 the
lniperl il Government apprehension that uuder
existing clicumstances the peace coucluded
wltn the rebels will allord uo assurance of ihe
lastiug restoration of ti aiiqullity iv the Islands."
CTbe present Goverument has Utterly
faiied to correct, if, iudeed, it has
not aggravated, the very evils it vvas
intended to prevent. It bus uot stimula
ted our commerce with the Islands. Our par
ticipation 111 Its establishment against the
wishes ot the natives was In ulaln uefiauce of
the conservative teachings and warnings of the
wise and patriotic men who laid the foundation;)
of our free institutions, and I inviie an expres

2\'e«cl a Larger Army.
From t lie repoit of tlie Secretary of War It
appears that tbe strengtb of r:ie army on Sep
tember SO, 1894, was 33 30 officers and 2.">,7G"5
enlisted men. Although this is apparently a
very slight decrease compared with the previ
ous year, the actual ell cttve force has been in
cieased to the equivalent of nearly two regi
ments through the reorganization ol the syst m
of recruitlug and the consequent release to
regimental duty of the large force of niPii
hitherto serving at the recruiting depots. Th
abolition of these depots, v is predicted, will
furthermore effect au annual leductiou nr>
proximaiing $250,000 in the diiect expendi
tuies, besides piomoilng Generally the health,
morals and discipline of the troops.
The execution of the policy of conceniratlii;,'
the aimy at important centers of pooulatlou
and transportation, foreshadowed hi the last
annual report of Uie Secretary, has tesulted iv
the abandonment of tifieeii of the smaller
posts, which was efieceft under a plan which
assembles organization of the same regiments
hitherto wid Iy separated. This renders our
small forces more readily effective tor any ser
vice which thsy may be called upon to per
form, Increases the extent of the territory un
d r protection without diminishing the security
heretofore afforded io any locality, and im
proves the discipline, training and esprit de
corps of tho army, besides considerably de
creaslnu the cost of its maintenance. Though
tin: forces of tbe department of the East have
been somewhat Increased, moie thau three
quarters of the aimy is still stationed west of
the Mississippi, 'i bis carefully matured policy
which secures the best and greatest service in
the interest of the general welfare from t be
small lorce comprising our icgular aimy should
uot be thoughtlessly embarrassed by creation
of uew and unnecessary posts through acts of
Congress to gratify the ambitions or interests
of localities.
While the maximum legal strength of aimy
is 25.000 meu, the effective stiengt l), through
various causes, Is hut lltiie over 20,000 i:ie'u.
The' purpose of Cougress does no! therefore
seem to be fully attained by the exist inn con
dition. While uo considerable increase in the
army is iv my judgment demanded by recent
events, ihe policy of seacoast fortification. In
tbe pros- cution oi which vse have been steadily
engaged tor some years, has so lar developed as
to Migjjest that tl.e effective stientUh of the
aimy be vow made ai least equal to th.- legal
strengin. Measures taken by the department
nu. ing ibe year as indicated have alieady
considerably aumnented he etteeuve force,
and me Secrelaiy of War piesents a plan Which
I recommend to tlie consider. uiou or Congress
to attain tbe desired end. Economies eliected
in the department, in other lines of work will
offset to a great extern the expendltuie. in
volved In the proposition submitted. Among
other thiugs this couteinulaieH the adop
tion of the three battalion formation of
renlnieuts. which for several years has been
iudoised by lbs secretaries ot War aud the
generals commanding the army. Compact in
itse!f. it provides a skeleton orgauization,
ready to be lilied out in tne event of war, which
is peculiarly adap ed to our strength aud re
quirements; anu ihe iact that uvery other
nation, with a simile, exception, has adopted
this formation to meet ibe conditions of mod
ern warfare, should alone secure for ihe recom
meudaiion an early consideration.
It ts imrdly necessary to leeall ihe fact ih ,t.
In obedience to the commands of the constitu
tion ami the laws, and for the purpose of pro
tecting tbe property of tbe United states, aid
ing the process of Federal courts and removing
lawless obstruction* to the performance by the
Government of Its legitimate function", it be
came necessaiy in various localities during the
year to employ a considerable poittou «>* t he
Federal troois. The duty was discharged
promptly. courageously and with marked dis
cretion by heitlicers and men. and the most
cratifylud pi oof was thus afforded thar the
army deserves that complete confidence in its
efficiency aud discipline which the country has
at all times manifested.
The year has be n free from disturbances of
Indi.ns, and the chances of further depreda
tions ou their part aie constantly becoming
moie remote and improbable.
The total cxpeudituies for the War Depart
ment, for th. year ending June 30, 1894,
amounted lo $50,039,009 34; of this sum
§2.000,014 : 1(9 w;is for salai les and contingent
expenses, $"J3.00,j.i50 16 for the support nf
the military establishments, (5,001,682 23
lor miscellaneous objects and $25,371,155 96
for public woi-s. This latter sum includes
$1!>.4U4,u37 49 for river and harbor Improve
ments and §3,947,803 50 for fortifications aud
other woiks or deteuse. Tbe appropriations
for the current year aggregate $52,429,112 73,
and the estimates submitted by ll;e Secretary
of War for the next fiscal year call for appro
priations amounting to $52,318,029 55.
The skill and Industry of our oiCnuuce officers
aud inventors have, it Is believed, overcome
the mechanical obstacles which have hereto
fore uelayed Hie armament of our coasts, and
Ibis great national undertaking upou which we
have euiered may now proceed as rapidly as
Cougiess shall de e.rmine. With a supply of
nuished gutis of large caliber already on band,
10 which additions should now rapidly follow,
the wisdom of providing carriages aud em
placement tor iheir mounting cuuuoc bo too
strongly urged.
The total enrollment ol the militia of the sev
eial Slates is 117.533 '.illiceis and enlisted men,
au increase of 5343 over the number reported
aitheclos«of the pievious ye 1. The reports
of militia inspections by the tegular army offi
cers ihow a maiKPd increase in interest aud
eflicieucy iv the State organizations and I
strongly recommend a continuance of the policy
of affoi ding every practical encouragement nos
sloie to this important auxiliary of our military
establishment.
The condition of the Apache Indians held as
prisoners by tbe (ioverumeui for ei^ht years,
at a cosi of half a million dollars, has beeu
chauged during the year from capnvity to oue
whlcii giv. s them an opportunity to demon
strate their capacity for self-support aud at
least partial civilization. Legislation euactea
at the Idle session of Congress gave the War
lJepartmeut :iuihoriiyio transfer the survivors,
numbering 34G, from Mount Vernon barracks,
in Alabama, to any suitable reservation. The
department selected as th- ir future home the
military lands near Fort Sill, ludlan Territory,
where, under military surveillance, ihe former
prisoners have beeu'e^tablished '" agriculture
under condltious favorable to their advance
ment.
In recognition of tbe iong and distinguished
military services and faiihful discharge of the
delicate and responsible civil duties by Major-
General John M. iSclioflelu, vow geueral com
manding the army, it is suggested to Congress
that the tempoiary revival ol the grade of Ii u
tenant-geuerul in his behalf would be a just aud
giacious act aud would permit his retirement
vow near at hand with rauu btultlug his merits.

The report of the Attorney-General notes tlia
eraMfyioft piogresji made by the Supreme Court
iv ovei coming the 41 rear* of Its business anil
lv naehiiiß a ccndltion in which ii will be able
to dlsnose of cases a* iney aris«- wiluout any un
reasonable delay. This result is, of course,
veiy litrgely due to the successful workiuc of
the plan inaußuratinK Circuit Courts of Ap
peals, lv respect to these tribunals a sugges*
lion is made in quaiters eutitled to the hignest
consideration that an additional Circuit Judue
for each circuit would creatly Htrtouttien these
couns aud the coniidence -reposed in their ;;d
--juilicutlons, and iii.a mucli an addition would
not create a greater force of Judpes than the
increasing business of such courts rrqutrrs. I
commena tU«i sucgestiou to the catetul consid
eration of Cuueress. .
Other importaut topics are adverted to in the
report, accompanied by reconimeudations,
tuauy ol wukli iidvu L'eeu treated at laice iv
previous messages, aud at this time, therefore,
need only be named. I refer to ihe abolition of
the fee syst' m as a measure of compensation
to Federal officers; the enlargement of the
powers of Unhed States Commissioners, at
least, iv the Teiritories; the allowance of writs
of error in criminal cases on blialf of ihe
United Stales, and the establishment of degrees
in the crime of murder.
A topic dealt wiih by the Attorney-General
of much importance is the condiiiou of the ail
niinistration of justice in Indian Territory.
Tne permanent solution of whai Is caliea the
Indian problem is piobably not to be expected
at once, but meanwhile such ameliorations of
present conditions as tbe exist mi; system will
admit of ought not to be ueglected. iam satis
fied that there should be a Federal court estab
lished for the lerntory with sutlicieui Judges,
aud tbat this court should sit withlu the Terri
tory and have the same ]Uilsdic:iou as to Terri
toiial affairs as is vow vested 111 the Federal
courts sittiug in Arkansas and Texas.
Another subject of pressing moment referred
to by the Attorney-General is the reorganization
of the Union Pacific Railway Company on a
basis equitable as regards all private interests
aud as favoiable lo the Goverumeut as existing
conditions will permit. The operation of a
railroad by a court through a receiver is au
anomalous state of mines which should be ter
minated, on all grounds, public and private, at
the earliest possible moment. Besides, uot to
enact the needed enabling I 'gtslatloa at the
present s- ssion postpones the whole matter
until me assembling of a new Congress aud
Inevitably increases all tlie complicatioim of ihe
situation, and could uot but be regarded as a
signal failure to solve a problem which has
practically beeu before the present Cougress
ever since its organization.
Federal I'riflona,
Eight years ago, In my annual message, i
urged upon Congress as Btrougly as 1 coula
the location and construction of two 1 risons
for ihe confinement of United States prisoners.
A similar recommendation has been m.de
from time to nme siuce, and a few years aso a
Ihw was passed providing for tbe selection of
sites foi these institutions. No appropriation
has, however, been made to carry the act Into
effect, aud ihe old aud discreditable condition
siiil exists. It Is not my purpose ar this time
to repeat the considerations which make an
impregnable case In favor of th' owuership
and muuagement by the Goverumeut cf the
penal institutions in which Federal urisoneis
are confined, l simply desire to again uige
former recommendations on the. subject, and
to particularly call the attention of Cuti
gress to tbat part of the ieport ot the Secretary
of War in which he states that me military
prison at F->rt Leaven worth, Kans., cau be
turned over 10 the Government as a prison for
Federal couvicts without the least difficulty
and with un actual Bavlng of money from every
point oi view.
Pending a more complete reform, l hope thai
by the adoption of the suggestion of the Secie
tary of War tins easy step may be taken in tho
direction of the proper care of its couvicts by
the Government of the Uuited States.

The report of ihe Postmaster-General pre
sents a comprehensive statement of tbe opera
tions of the Postoiiice Department for me last
liscal year. The receipts of lite department
during ihe year amount d to $75,080.479 04
and the expenditures to ?84.824,414 15. The
transactions ol tbe i ostal sei vice indicate witb
barometric certainty the fluctuations In tho
business of tbe country. As such business com
plications continued to exist throughout the
l;»si y ar to an unforeseen extern it is uoi sur
prising that theie Is a Oeiici»ncy of revenue to
me t the expenditures of the Po.stofhce Depart
ment, which was estimateu in aavunce at
about $8,000,000. The ascertained revenues
of the last year, which were ihe basis of calcu
lation for the cunent year, being less than
estimated, the deficiency for the current year
will be correspondingly greater, though the
I'ostmaster-Geueral slates tbat the latest In
dications are so f vorabie ihat be confidently
pierticis an increase of at least 8 per cent in
the rt- venues of ihe, curreut year over those of
the Ust year.
• Ihe expenditures inciease steadily and neces
sarily with the growth and needs of the coun
tiy, so thai Hit: deficiency is greaier or lesa in
any year, depending u:on the volume of re-
Ctiipts. 'Ihe Postmaster-General states that
this deficiency is unnecessary and might ue ob
viated at once it the law regulating rat s upon
maii matter of the second class was modified.
'Ihe ra.e received for the transmission of this
second-class matter is l cent per pound, while
the cost ol such transmission to the Govern
ment is eight limes that amount. Iv the geu
eral teim-« of the law .his rats covers newspa
pers aud periodicals. 'J ii« extensions of ihe
int ailing of the terms from time to time have
admitted to me piiv;!eges Intended for leniu
mate newspapers and periodicals a surprising
range of publication and created abuses the
cost of which amount In ihe aggregate to me
total deficiency of ths Postufiice Department.
Pieteuded newspapers are started by busi
ness houses for lh" mere purpose of adv-rtis-
Ing goods, complying will] the law in form only
and discontinuing publication as soon as ihe
period of advertising is over. "Sample copies''
of pietenoed newspauera are issued In great
lrumliers for a like purpose only. The result is
a ureat loss of revenue to the Government, be-
m ■:!•-> its humiliating use as an agency to aid in
carrying out the scheme of a business bouse to
advertise Us goods by means of a nick upon
both its rival houses ami ttie regular aud legiti
mate newspapers, l'aper-coveied literature,
consisting mainly ol triisiiy novels, to the ex
tent of many thousands of tons, is «eni through
the malls at ou^ cent per pouud, while the pub
lishers of standard works are required to pay
eight times that amount iv seudluj,' their publi
cations.
Another abuse consists in the tree carrlaue
timing!] the mulls ot hiindieds of tons of sted
and grain tise.essiy distnbuied through th •
Department of Agriculture, 'ihe Postmaster-
General predicts that if the law be so amended
as to eiadlcate t lies- abuses not only will ih ■
Postoftice Department not show a deficiency,
but he believes that in tha uear luiure all
legitimate newspapers and periodical rnaga
zuies might be properly transmitted thiougli

invite your promnt consideration of tui.s sub
ject and fuliy indorse the views ol the I'ust

The total uumb r of postofflces iv the Uuited
States on the 3(>ih day ot June, 1894, was
09,805, an Increased! 1403 over the preced
ing year. Ol these 3428 weie i residential, au
iuciea.se In that class of six yeighi over the
piecediug year.
Six huudrcd and ten cilles and towus are
provided with free delivery and ninety-three
ether elites aud town* eutitled to this service
under tbe law have uot been accorded it on
account ot insufficient funds. The expense ot
fieu delivery foi the curreut fiscal year will be
more than &12,300,000, and under existing
legislation this item ot expendu ure is subject
lo cuustaut inciease. The stlmated cost of
ruial free delivery generally is so very large
that it ought not to be considered in the preseut
comliiiou of affairs.
DurinK ihe year 830 additional domestic
money-order otlices were established. Tuo
total uumber ot these offices at the close of the
year was 19,300. There were 14,408,041
money orders issued during the year, being nu
inorease over the preceding year of 994,300.
The value of these orders amounted to M 3.5,.

The repoit shows most gratifying results in
Ihe way ot economies worked out without

These cousist iv the abrogation or steamship

This repoit also contains a valuable contribu
tion to the history of the uuiversal i>osul

cally to tbe establishment of one postal system
for iha euilre civilized world. Special atten
tion Is directed to mis subject at this time, iv
view of the fact that the n.xt congress of ihe
uuiou will meet iv Washington in 1897, and it
is hoped thai ninety action will be takeu in the
direction of peifcctiug preparations for that
event.
The Postmaster-General renews the sugces
tlou made in a pievious report that the depart
ment organization be luci eased to the exteut
of crea ing a direct district supervision ot all
postal all an s, and iv this suggestion l fmly
concur.
There are connected with the Postollice's
establishment 32,001 employes, who are iv ihe
classified service. This includes many who
have been classified ou the suggestion of the
Postmaster-General. Ue lays ihat another
year's expeneuce at the head of the department
serves only to streugtiieu the conviction as to
the excellent workiuj; of the civil service law iv

The New N it/.
Attentlou Is called to the report of the
Secretary of IN'avy, wbtcn shows very gratl
l.viiiK progress lv the construction of ships
Jor our new navy. All the ve«seis now
bulldlug, inciuUiUK ilie torpedo-boats au-
Uiorizea at the last sessiou of Conviress.
and excepting tv- lirM-class battle-Miip lowa,
will probably be completed daring the comio"
n.-.cMl year. The eMiniiiies for the Increase of
Hie navy for the year, <sudui2 June 30, LB9G
are large, but tiiey . include practically the en
lire sum necessary to complete and equip all
tne new sUios not now la commission, so thai
unless new ships an- authorized the appropria
tions for the naval service for the fiscal year
ending June 3u, 1890, should fall below ihe
estimates for the coming year by at least
$12,000,000.
The Secretary presents with much earnest
ness a plea for the authorization of three addi
tiouil battle-ships aud ten or twelve torpedo
boats. While the uuannoied vessels hereto
fore authorized. Including those uowneailuc
completion, will cousti.uie a fleet which, itis
believed, is sufficient for ordinary cruising pur
poses in time of ueace, we have now com
pleted and iv process of construction but lour
tirsi-class battle-ships ;:nd but two torpedo
boats. It we re to have a navy for warlike
operations, offensive aud defensive, we cer
tainly ought to increase both the number or
battle-ships and torpedo-boats.
Tlie niauulacmre of Iron requires an expen
sive plant aiut the aggregation of many skilled
worliiuen. All the armor necessary to com
plete the vessels now building will d- delivered
before the Ist of June next. If no new con
tracts are mveu out contractors must aisbaud
tlseir vvoikinen and their plants must lie idle.
Battle-ships authorized at this time would not
be well under way until late in the coming liscal
year, and a; least three and a half yeais fioin
<he date of contract would be required foi their
completion. The Secretary states that not more
than 15 per cent of the cost of such ships need
be included Iv the appropriation for the coming
year. I ivcoumiend that pioviMou bu made for
the construction of additional battle-ships and
torpedo-boats.
The Secretary recommends the manufacture
not only of oiduance and ordnance mat- rial for
ships for the navy, but a supply for tne auxil-
Uuy fleet of guns, and their appurtenances
should b:' provided and Kept on hand for both
these purposes. We have not to-day a single
guv that cottfd be put ou he ships Paris or New
Yotk of the luternatlonal Navigation Company,
or any Other s!:ii< ol our reseive navy. The
manufacture of guns at the Washington Navy
yard is proceeding satisfactorily, and none of
our new ships will be required to wait lor their
guns or oiduance eiiuipmeur.
An important oruer lias been issued by the
Secretary of the Navy co-oidiuatiug the uutles
of the several buieaus concerned iv the con
struction of <hlps. This order, it is believed,
will secure to a greater extent than has hereto
fore been possible the hairuonious action of
these several bureaus aud maUe the attain
ment of the best results more certain.
During ttie p;is: year theie lias been an un
usual and pressing demand in niauy quarters
or the world for the presence of vessels to
guard American interests, in January last,
during the Brazilian insurrectiou. a larg* 11 ■et
was concentrated in me harbor of Rio de Ja
neiro. The vigorous action ol liear-Admlral
Beiiiiam in protecting tiie persoual and com
mercial rights of our citizens during the dis
lurbed conditions afforded lesult* which will,
it is believed, havf v. far-renching and whole
some Influence whenever in like circumstances
it m y become necessary for our naval cum
mauders to Interfere on behalf of our people iv
foieigu ports. Tiie war now in progress be
tween China and Japan lias rendered it neces
sary or expedient to dispatch eight vessels to
those waters.
Transfer th« Coast Survey.
The Secretary of the Navy aud the Sec
retary ot the Treasury recommend the

Tha siaguatiou ol promotion la this, the vital

The system adopted a few years ago regulat
inn Hi • einpiuyuieut of labor at the uavy-yard3
is n^idiy upheld, .aid has fully deuiouswated
Its Usefulness and efllctency. It is within the
domain of civil seivica leform, iuasmuch as
workmen ait- employed througu a board of
labor selected at each navy-yard, aud are given
work without leferencc to policies and iv he
order ol their application, preference, however,
being given to army and navy veterans and
those having lormer navy-yard experience.
Amendments, suggrsted by expetleuce, have
been made to the rules regulating the sysieni.
fnroUKti its operatlou the work Id our navy

opportunity to woi has been honestly and
fairly afforded to willing and competent, appli

to be strictly adhered to, there will soon be, as
a natural couse<juence. such an equalization of

relax or abaudou it.
HukK Smith's Keport.
The report of Hie Secretary of tbe Interior
exhibits the situation of ilie uumerous aud In
teresting branches of the public service con
nected witb tits department. I commend this
report and the valuable recoinmendLuious of
the Secretary to the careful aiteution of
Congress. I lie public kind disposed ot duiinj;
the ye;ir amounted to 10,408,100.77 acres,
including i' 5.807.05 of ludiun lands. It is
estim.iteit that the public domain still remain
ing amounts to a intie more than <iuo.uou,ooo
acres, excluding, however, about 3ti0,000,000
acres in Alaska, as well as military reserva
tions and railroad aud other sections of lauds
jL-t uuadjudlcated. The total cash receipts
from tlie sale of lands amounted to £:.',074,
--285 70, including $91,981 03 received for
Indian lands. Thhiy-tive thousand patents
weie issued for agricultural lai:d and 3100
patents weie issued Indians on allotments of
theic lauds in severally, the land so allotted
being inalienable by tne Indian allottees for a
period of twenty-live years alter patent.
liieie were certified and patented on account
of railroad ami wagon-road gr..n s durum the
year 863,550.45 acres of l.uid, and at the
close of Ml- year 20,000,000 acres weie fin
braced in Hi lists of selections made by rail
road aud wagon-road companies and awaiting
>•• liemeui. The selections of swamp lauds
aud that i alien as indemnity therefor since the
passage of tii ■ act \ rovidiug for the same in
1840 amount to nearly or quite 80,500,000
acies, of which 58.d00.u00 have been paieu ed
to States. About 138.000 acres weie patented
dining the last year, nearly 820,000 acres of
school aud educational grants were approved
during the year aud at its close 1,250,303.81
acres remained unadjusted.
1; appears that tlie appropriation for the cur
rent year on account of special service for the
protection of the purilic lauds aud the limber
Me. eon is much lesj thai) Mose lor previous
years and is inadequate for au eflici ut per
formance ol the work. A larger sum of money
than has been appropriated during a number of
years past on this account baa bc-eu teturned
to the Government as a result of the labors of
those employed iv Me particular service men
tioned aud I hope it will not be crippled by in
sutiicieut appropriation.
I fully indorse the r< commendations of the
Secretary Mat adequate appropriation should
bfi provided for our forest reserves and that a
comprehensive forestry system be inaugurated,
and such keepers and superintend' n;s as are
necessary to protect the forests already re
seived should be provided. I am of the opinion
that there should be an abandonment of Me pol
icy maintained by present laws auo. 'under which
the Goverum ot, for a very small considera
tion, is rapidly losing title to immense tracts of
land covered wun timber, which should be
properly reserved as a permanent source of
timber supply. The suutsestion that change be
made in Me manner of securing surveys of the
public lauds is especially worthy of considera
tion, lam satisfied that these surveys should
be made by a corps of competent surveyors,
under the immediate control and direction of
tlie Commissioner of the General Lanu Office.
An exceedingly important recoinmenda lon
of the Seci clary relates to the mauuer in which
contests and litigated cases, growing out of
erfor.s to obtain Government lauds, are now
determined. The entire testimony upou which
vhese controversies depend In all tbei: stages
is takeu before the local rejilstrrs and re
ceivers, and yet these officers have no power to
subpeua witnesses or to euforce their attend
ance to testify. These cases, numbering 3000
or 4000 annually, are sent by the local officers
to the Commissioner of the General Land Office
for his action. The exigencies ot his other
duties oblige him to act upon the decisions of
lite registers aud receivers without, au oppor
tunity for thorough personal examiuatiou.
Nearly 2000 of ihese cases are appealed annu
ally from the Commissioner to the Secretary of
the interior. Burdened with oth r Important
administrative duties, hi 3 determination of
these appeals must bo almost perfunctory aud
based upon the examination of others, hough
this determination of Me Secretary operates
hnal adjudication upoo rights of vei y great im
portance.
I concur In the opinion UiatttV Commissioner
of the General Laud Oflic should be reliev a
from the duty of deciding litigated land ca-.es;
Mat a non-partisan couit should b<- created 10
pass on such cases, and that the decisious of
his court should befiuil, at least so far as the
decisions of the department are now filial. The
proposed court mimu be yiven authority to cei
tity questions of iaw lv matters of special im
portance to tlie Supreme Court of Hie United
States or the Court of Appeals for the District
or Columbia for d-cision. The creation of such
i; tribunal would expedite the disposal of cases
and Insure decisions of a more satisfactory
Character. The registeis aud receivers who
originally hear aod decide tueae dispute* should
be invested with authority to compel witnesses
to attend and testify before them.
State <>f the Indian*.
'Iliougn. tlie condition 01 ttis Indians, sliowa ,
a steady and a healthy progiess. ilietr situ
ation is not satisfactory at all points. Some of
them to whom allotments of land have been
made aie found lobe unable or dislr.cllued to
follow agricultural pursuits or to otherwise
beuetictaliv manage their lava. This is espe
cially true of the Cbryenaes and Aiapahoes,
who, as 11 appears by the report ol uieir aueut,
have m many instancas never been located
upon theii allotments and In some eases do not
even Know where their allotni nts are. Their
condition has deteriorated. They are not self-
BUDportlng, and they live in camps and spend
tbeir time In idleness. I have always believed
that allotments of reservation lands in Indiana
iv severally .should be made sparingly, or at
least slowly and with tlie almost c.iutiou.
In th se dajs when white agriculturists and
Btoekraisers of experience and intelligence find
their lot a hard one, we oiiuht not 10 expecc
Indians, unless far advanced iv civilizaMon
and habit 9 of industry, to support lhemselve*
ou the small tracts of land usually allotted 10
them. II ibe self-suppoiliujr scheme by allot,
inent fails the wiehiied pauperism of ti.a
allottees result, which Is wone than their
original condition of r gala ed dependence, lc
Is evident that the evil conscqu -uces of ill
advised allotment aie lnteositied in case*
where the tulse step cannot be retreated oa
account of the purchases by tl>e Gove'uinei.t
of reservation lamis remaining after allot
ments are made aud the disposition of sucii
remaining lands to settlers or purchasers fiom
the Government.
1 am couvinced that the proper solution of
the Indian problem and the success ol every
step ta^en In that ciiiecii.m depends to a veiy
large extent upon the intelligence and honesty
of reservation agents aud the interest they
hay in their work, au agent titled for tils
place can ao much toward preparing the
Indians under his ebarge lor ciliz nship and
allotment of tbeir lauds and his advice as t<>
any matter concerning tbetr welfar>- will doc
mislead. An until agent will make no etlori to
a'tvance the Indians ou his reservation toward
civilization or preparation f>>r allotment of
lands in severally, aud his opinion as to their
condition iv ibis and other reuaids is ln-edle-»
aud v lueless. The indications are that 11,
detail of army <fhcers as lr.diau agents will re
sul in improved liiauagemeut ou the reserva
tions.
Whenever allotments are made, acd any In
dian ou tne reservation has previously .settled
upon a tot and cultivated li or ibown a dispo
sition to improve it in any way, such lot should
certainly be allotted to bun, and this should be
made plainly obligatory by statute. In the
ligbt of experience, and considering the uncer
tainty of ihe entire Indian sii nation and Its
exigencies, iv the future I am not only dispose,!
to »c very cautious in making allotments, but I
iucline to agiee with the Secretary of the In
terior in the Opinion Ibat when allotment* are
made, the balance ol tne reservation bud re
maining after allotment, ins cad of being
bought fry the (joveitiuenl from the Indians
and opened for .settlement with such scandals
and unfair practices as seem unavoidable,
should leinain for a fine at lea«t a- common
laud or be sold by the Government on teball of
the Indians in an orderly way and at lixeit
prices i.» be determined by Its location and
desirability, and that the proceeds, less ex
penses, snail be he!d in trust, for the benefit of
the Indian proprietors.
The Intelligent Indian school managerrent
of the pasi year has been followed by gratify
ing results. Efforts have l.ecu made to ad
vance the work in a sound and practical man
ner. Five inMiluti sof ludiuu teachers hav^
been held uuriui; the year •and havt- proved
very beueiicial ihiougb the views exchan^eil
and methods discussed particularly applicable*
to Indian education. Efforts are being maiJe iv
the direction of a gradual reduction of tu<- iiuni>
b r of ludian coutract schools, so thai in a
comparatively short time they may giv • way
altogether to Uoveinmeut schools, a:id it U
hoped thai the chauge may be so gradual
as to be perfected without too great ex
pense to the (ioveinment or due disre
gard of ti:e investments made by those who
have established and are maintaining such)
contract schools. The apnionriiitiou for th -i
current year, ending Juue 30, 1895. applicable
to the o.din ry expenses of ludian >eivi<e
aniouiits to $6,733,003 18, being $033,240 64
less i ban the appropriation in the same accouuc
for the previous year.
On the Pension Kolla.
At the close of the last fiscal year, on tlie
30i U day of June, IS'J4, there were 909,544
peisoiison oor peiisiou rolls, being v net in
crease oi 3532 over me number reported at the
end of the previous year. These pensioners
may be classified as follows: Soldier* and sail
ors, survivors of all wars, 768,968; widows
aud relatives of deceased soldier.-,, 215,162;
army uurses in the war ol the llion, 414.
Of these pensioners 32,039 are surviving
soldiers of Indian aud other wars prior to the
lute civil war aud the widows or it-lattves of
sued soldiers. The remainder, uunibTlnj;
937,505, are lecelving pensions on account of
the War of the KebrlUon, ana of these
409,344 are on tbe rolls ui:der tht- authority ot
the act of June 17, 1890, sdinetlines called
ti:e dependent pension law. The total amouut
expendt-d for pensions duiiUK the year was
8139,804.461 05. leaving an uni-xpei>tt>' bal
ance Iroiii the sum appropriated of &'JB,2uZ,-<
712 G5.
The sum necessary to meet pension expendt
tuies for ihe >ear endlug June 30, 1890, esti
mated at §140,000,000. The Commissioner of
Pensions is of the opinion that ihe year 1895,
being tbe tuirll th after the close of'th- War of
he Kebellion, must, according to ail sensible
tui:i!.!.n calcuiatiuu, see the highest limit of the.
bnsion roll, and that after luat year it must
begin to decline.
Theclaims pending In the bureau bave de
creased moie than 00,000 during tbe year. a
1 irge proportion of the new claims hied are for
Increase of peu:-iou by those now on the rolli.
The number of certificates issued was 80.213.
The names dropped from the rolls for all causes
during the year nunibeied 37.951.
Among our pensioners aie nine widows and
three daughters ot soldiers, of tLe levolution
and rorty-nve sui vivors of the \\ ar of 1812.
The baie-faced aud extensive pension traudf
exposed under the direction of the courageous
and generous veieian soldier now at the head
of the buieau leave no room for the claim Ibat
uo purgation of our pension-rolls was needed,
or that continued vigilance ntid prompt action
are not necessary to the same end. The ac
cusation that an effort to detect pension frauds
is evidence of unfriendliness towaid our worthy
veterans and a denial ot their claims iv n a
eeneroslty of the Government suggests au u;i
fortuuate Indifference to the commission of an
otfense which has for motive the securing of ;t
pension, and indicates a wiliinmiess to be biluu
to the existence of mean and treacherous
crimes, which play upon dernaeoeic fears and
maKe sport of the patriotic impulse of a grate
ful people.
