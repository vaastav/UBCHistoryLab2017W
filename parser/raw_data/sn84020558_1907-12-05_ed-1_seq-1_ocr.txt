the mail carrying r;ite for sixteen knot

set forth on the ship subsidy in tli

admission of New Mexico, and the
other by Mr. Stone, for the admission

j ACTION ON THE CURRENCY.
j Washington, Dec. 4. The newly ap
i pointed house committee on banking
: and currency held Its first meeting to
! day, spending two and a half hours
j discussing the currency question in its
. several phases. The only definite ac
tion taken at the initial meeting was
the authorizing of the chair to apoint
a sub-committee of five to. draft and
J submit a currency bill to correct the
present financial situation. There will
be no hearings before the committee
until the sub-committee finishes its
j task and the completed draft is in the
j hands of the chairman.
P The discussion of two phases of the
currency question marked the confer
ence. These were: The creation of
elasticity in currency and the disposi
tion of the reserve balances of national
banks. The committee has apparently
agteed that it will sanction no move
to increase the bulk of paper money
but will confine itself to 'he considera

tion of the
elasticity. Several members of the
committee expressed the opinion that
loaning the reserve funds should be
checked b legislation.

GERMAN POLITICS
The Various Groups of ths Reichstag
Agree to Support the Govern
ment. Berlin. Dec. 4. Prince von Buelow.
Imperial chancellor, has won in a short
sharp contest with the wavering na
tional liberals. They and all the par
liamentary parties forming a coalition,
including the itwo conservative and
three radical groups, agreed afresh in
caucuses late today to support the
government. The question still remains
whether parties representing such di
verse interests can continue to co-operate
in supporting the government on
the variety of controversial measures
pending.

VARIETY OF CAUSES
OF PRICE DISTURBANCE
Foreigners Scared by the President's
Message and Prospect of Japanese
War.
New York. Dec. 4. The price of
stocks shifted many times during the
course of the day's trading. ,Thc early
depression was traceable In part to the
effect of selling for the foreign ac
count. An unfavorable view has been
taken abroad of the contents of the
president's message. .The Japanese in
cident seemed seriously regarded In
foreign circles also. Copper stocks
were the center of weakness. The
weakness of American Smelting was
attributed to fears of a reduction of
the dividend rates but the greatest
weakness was shown after the an
nouncement of the declaration of the
regular dividend in the stock. There
wus another decline in coper. It was
feared that the recent heavy shipments
of copper to Europe represented rath
er a transfer of holdings to a more
convenient money market than actual
marketing.

t
Goldfield. Iec. 4. The local miners'
strike is a deadlock, without either side
making an effort to bring about an
agreement. The mine owners and the
miners have each resolved that the
other had broken the agreement. The
mine owners charge that the miners
violated the strike agreement by strik
ing without the agreed two-thirds vote,
while the miners met today anil de
clared that the owners had violated
the agreement on that siibji-ct. Roth
shies Kcm to have settled down to a
long drawn out fight.
A representative of the smelter com
bine has reached Goldfield anil has
opened negotiations for the purchase
vt the low grade ores of the district,
his offer being to take all ores up to
140 per ton value paying one-third in
cash when smelted and the balance in
45 days. As very little ore of a low
grade is shipped from the district, the
proposition is regarded an only a sub
terfuge, but as some effort is being
made to relieve the situation the cham
ber of commerce committee which has
arranged for mass meetings all over
the state, demanding of congress and
the president an investigation of the
smelter trust, has railed off the m-et-ings
and will await further develop
ments. AN OUTBREAK EXPECTED.

THE DEAD IN NAOMI MINE
Pittsburg. Dec. 4. Three more bod

whom have been Identified.
GARRISONING GOLOFIELD.
Goldfield. Dec. 4. The executive
committee of the Mine owners asso
ciation of Goldfield. tonight received
assurances from Gov. Sparks that he
had called iHKn Washington requesting
that government troops be held In
readiness for use in Nevada mining
camps. A garrison of regulars will be
established at Goldfield. There Is
nothing in the immediate situation to
require the Intervention of troops, the
town is quiet as usual, but It is feared
by the mine owners that trouble is
brewing and overt acts might be com
mitted any time. The strike Is a dead
lock. , The mine owners proKse to
keep the mines shut down until the
violent element of the miners union
and the lawless element generally in
the camp are compelled to leave.
The miners' union is not prepared to
make a long fight, a-s the treasury is
depleted. It is believed for that rea
son, the miners will force the issue by
violence as has leen threatened. Mon
ey has bi-en scarce in Goldfield since
the two banks closed and scrip has
been resorted to by a third bank. As
all the mines have been shut down,
several days the pinch of poverty is
Iwing felt by the miners, who as a
rule, are an improvident lot. living
from hand to moifjh.
Holdups and burglaries have been
frequent of late, atjributable to that
fact. There Is a general feeling of un
rest which is likely to break out Into
a general riot before long. As precau
tionary reasons, the governor, because
of the acute situation, was impelled to
;call for troops. This Is the last stand
apparently, to be made by the Western
Federation of Miners, and It is ex-p.-cted
that they will make a bitter and
desperate fight.1

ed most enthusiastically by his col
leagues in congress.
Representative Rtirke was the first
speaker. He reviewed Mr. Knox's
public career and Minted out how in
timately he was identified with and
responsible for the success of many of
the great policies that had aided in
making the administration of President
Roosevelt notable. He read abstracts
from letters written by the president
warmly commending Mr. Knox for the
part he had played in the enforcement
of the anti-trust laws.
At the conclusion of his speech Rep

a motion that it be declared the sense

carried with cheers.

Knox. Mr. Knox's declaration that the
suggestion of his candidacy must rest
upon his public career and the wishes
of the republicans of Pennsylvania was
heartily applauded.
Mr. Knox said: "Kor the too gener
ous words of commendation spoken to
night, ermlt me to thank you all most
sincerely. I value them especially as
the words of approval of such public
services as I have been enabled to ren
der in the past. As to the suggestion
of a iMMtsible higher service it must
rest tixn such foundation ass my pub

could feel as certain of the value of
one as I feel gratitude for the confi

"Republican nominations have al

thorough understanding of the fitness
and availability of candidates and an
intelligent and comprehensive survey
of their tactical positions.
"In 104 President Roosevelt was
nominated and overwhelmingly elected
as a tribute to his sincerity and in ap
proval of his unrelenting purpose to

abuses and to secure the equity of all
