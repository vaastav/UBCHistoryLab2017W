?. Imperial publli domain is gone? Our last
reliance iB upon the President himself and his
veto. Let him clap his veto upon the ftrst
land grabbing railway bill presented for his
signature, and let him make it a test question
with Congress, and we still thiak he caa
swamp the lobby. At all events, the Presi
dent's veto in this business is the last hope

Tin Reason Wht.? The reason why the
election in Georgia is assigned for the last
week in December admits of a curious inter
pretation. It is well knows that frem tins
immemorial Christmas week has been a uni
versal holiday among the negrees In the
South. It is a period when they are never ex
pected to work, and never do, giving them
selves, for the time, up to all sorts ef dissipa
tion aud extravagant frolicking peculiar to the
race in the Southern country. We shall not,
therefore, be unprepared to hear of a variety
of ''unpleasant misunderstandings" among the
whites and negrees, and among the blackies
themselves in Georgia on the 21st, 22d and
23d days of the current month? the days on
whioh the eleotlea has been ordered by the
radical authorities.
Tas Judicial Vindication of the young
lady clairvoyant in Bridgeport, Conn., who
was arraigned under one of the old blue laws
of that State for fortune telling, is likely to
prove a great cemfort to Spiritualists, Mes
merists and the believers in prevailisg social
isms generally. It seems the young lady fore
told events truly, and thirteen credible wit
nesses take oath to the fact. The Judge held
that the old Btahite evidently applied to fraudu
lent prophets and vagrants, and with that
view of the case he discharged the accused.
Under the old blue laws, as originally adminis
tered, the younqj lady would certainly have
been burned as a witch.
As Christmas comes agaiu, with its cold
Snows and its merry firesides, the claim of New
York to the name of the City of Charities is the
more strongly asserted by the pressing need
that the poor and the wayward present.
There are bails and baziiars and fairs of
all denominations announced for all kinds of
charities ? for the churches that are weak in
paying members ; for the foundlings, the blind,
the orphans and the widows ; for the littlo
Arabs of the street and the shivering rniser
ables in the tenements ; for the blind beggars
on the corners and the fallen wretches in their
sinful misery; for all kinds and in all ways.
New York asks no questions of the needy.
She talks only with her open hand.
"Mourning for Logan."? The Chicago
Times (democratic) is authority for the state
ment that radical politicians in Springfield,
111., aro said to have reached the conclusion
that John A. Logan "cannot figure or tele
. graph himself into the United States Senate."
The opinion is also prevalent in other quarters
that he cannot pray himself into that office
eveu with a "forty-parson power" to help
him. Suppose Logan adopt thu Greeley stylo
and endeavor to "cuss'' himself into the
oovetud Senatorial seat ?

Buffalo, Dec. 10, 1870.
Upon the return or the delegates lrom tlielr visit
to Niagara Falls the discussion wad resumed of the
loilowlng resolution, oilered by Mr. Wettterell, of
Philadelphia:?
Resolved, That In the opinion of thin Board the best In
terests of tho country imperatively Ueiuaud u reitorauou of
the ?peoie standard or vaiuea.
Tne deotvtcs to-day aud to-nlglit were the most
racy and animated of the sesmou. Numerous sub
stitutes to Mr. Wetherell's resolution were offered
by Messrs. Hopes, Burton and others; but all were
rejected, and the original resolution, given above,
was adopted. The subject or free trade in money
was discussed aud laid over, alter which that of an
international coinage and a cental measurement
was considered, and referred again to the Executive
Council, alter the reading of a communication lrom
the New York Chamber or Commerce, which stated
that the United States government was In corre
spondence with European governments on the sub
ject, and advised tliat no action be taken in tlie
matter by the Bourd until Congress has considered
the question. The importance or inland transporta
tion by water and the maintaining and improve
ment thereof oy the State aud national authori
ties as a commercial necessity, in controlling and
cheapening the cost of the transportation of the
great products or the country, was considered.
Mr- Hazard, of the BuiTulo Board of Trade,
offered resolutions looking to tue aid or the general
government in enlarging tho Erie Canal and making
It a ship channel. Mr. Hazard made a lengthy
speech In tavor of his resolutions.
Mr. Randolph. of Chicago, opposed Mr. Hazard's
resolutions, on the ground that the work should be
doue by the State of New York, inasmuch us u bad
derived a large Income from the canal.
Mr. Ofdykk, of Now York, expressed the opinion
that the pcoplo of the Mate, as a whole, would not
consent to the expenditure reauired to make the
proposed improvements, inasmuch as the people
of the rural districts were rather Injured
than benefitted by tho canal, us It brought
the products of the West in direct compe
tition with tueir own. tie said the Erie
Canal had built up tho West by furnishing an outlet
for the products of that section. The Erie Canal in
times past had profited the West thousands ot? mil
lions of dollars, aud but for It th ; larger portion of
the Northwest won d still be a wilderness.
Mr. allen, of Philadelphia, said lie was in favor of
national aid tor all improvements that would tend
to beuelit this great and growing country; but, in
view of the arguments which had beon made by
several speakers, be did not know how to vote upon
the question. Finally, at a late hour, on the motion
or Mr. Allen, the Board adjourned until Monday
morning, when tue consideration of the subject will
be resumed.
It is expected that tbe Board win complete its
business on Monday, although many important sub
jects await action. St. Louis was chosen as the city
in which to hold the next meeting of tue National
Board of Trade.

A Nnosuimiry < onnnellor Threatening a
Peaceful ? nrrevpondi-nt.
On Thursday last a challenge was sent by Clinton
Rice, the Counsellor of the haytlen L gallon, to
Donn Piatt, a correspondent of a Western paper.
The cause of Mr. Kice's displeasure was the publi
cation or a letter by Piatt, ulleglng that the corre
spondent had basely misrepresented nim In relation
to tue McCiarralian claim, the rull particulars
of which were published In the Herald or
the l?h or November last. The issue was a ques
tion of veracity, and Rice concluded that the only
way to decide it was to cnallenae the offending
party. The time set ror the affair or honor was yes
terday morning at six o'clock-, and the place in the
nelghoorhood or tho historic duelling grounds or
Bladensburg, but Piatt could not be induced
to risk his Ii/o or oven his reputation
by accepting tho challenge, an.! so tho dnol
could not take place. Tho matter, however, was
kept a proiound secret on tho part of Piatt, Rice
disclosing his intentions and thereby putting the
police on their guard. A plan was laid for the ar
rest of the pari ies had they attempted to leave tho
District, but the services of tne guardians or the
peaco were not required. The Superintendent or
Police, however, yesterday morning Bent lor
Rice, and quietly informed him that he must
consider himseir under arrest on the charge of hav
ing sent a challenge, in vain Clinton protested
that ho bad done no sucn thing. The Major was
obdurate and would hear no denial. Finally, alter
the chivalrous gentleman had beon seatod in tho
olllce about an hour, the Major Informed him that
he would release him upon his parolo not to leave
the District to participate in a hostile meeting. Thus
ends the unpleasantness between the counsellor and
correspondent, at least for the present.

New .Marine Dray.
Captain J. G. Baker, ot the revenue marine
steamer Moccasin, has forwarded to the Treasury
Department a report or the receut test inude or a
marine drag Invented by Captain John Faunae, of
the same sorvico. Tho experiment was made on tne
morning ol the 8th Inst, in Narrugansett Bay, off
Newport, Rhodo Island. He says:-* 'When I lert
port the wind was strong east-southeast. By tho
time I arrived where I wanted to test It the wiud
died out some, but blowing about a good whole sail
breeze, but there was a heavy swell rolling lu from
the southeast. We were in eignteen fathoms or
water. Here we let the drag go and tried it with
thirty, forty and fifty rathoms or hawser. Tho wind,
however, was not strong enough to test it thor
oughly. The tide was strong, setting rrom about
north-northeast. or course, the wind not
being very strong, the tide would have
some Influence on the vessel. But under these cir
cumstances I round she would lay about seven or
eight points from the wind and ride the sea like a
gull. Nothing could bo more satisfactory. I
am convinced that in any gale of wind she
would lay hoad to it and ride it out. I shall give it
another trial as ston as the wind is stroug enough.
This vessel is very hard to keep hoad to the wind.
Her mast (and she has but one; Is well rorward, with
a good sued square sail yard. Her pilot house is
high, and this makes her pay off when lying at
auchor about seven paints each way rrom the wiqcu
As regards the principle or tho dra>, it 1s all you
could expetfk A. drag weighing not more than
rour hundred pounds (this one weighs seven hun
dred pounds) would answer every purpose lor a
vessel of the size of tho Moccasin. Farther tests in
severe weather will no doubt be quite as satisfactory
astheonejuat made. Of lu utility I havo to say
that no cutter should be without ono, and 1 hope, as
soon as the tests are satisfactory, tncy will all be
supplied with one." The ohject of the "drag" is to
supply tho place of the anchor, or in any great
emergency, when it Is necessary to keep tho vessel
from driitlng. The first experiment was entrusted
[ to Cantata Baker, ai he is regarded m one of tho
r**
ablest officers of the revenue marine eerrtoe,
and ta bis testimony the department places the
greatest confidence. Tills invention, bo liupor
taut to the shipping Interest, has proved
* success, ?ud arrangements are being nude
with a New York firm to manufactory
thorn at once. Tlie drug Itself cannot be better de
scribed tliaa la comparing It with an umbrella*
being made of various diameters, from Ave to ten
feet, and weighing from 400 to 1,000 pound*. The
oiMcers of the revenue marine are sanguine that this
"drug" will add anoilier to the valuable inventions
devised for the protection of our mercantile
marine, and nave many a vessel from shipwreck.
An hood as these "drags" can i?e supplied they will

Hiatus of the New <?uld Bank*.
Tho Comptroller of the Currency has dcclded to
again change the wording on the face of the new gold
note*. In place of the words "National Otrreacy,"
on the top border or the face or the note, will be,
'?Redeemable In gold ooln." The question bus
again been revived:? "Will they be roielv
able tor customer The law authorizing the
organisation or gold banks subject* them, with
several exceptions, to the provisions and require
ments or tbe law governing national banks, and
their notes, as everybody Knows, are not receivable
for customs. The qaestion then arise*: Will Congress
change the law so aa to allew the notes of the gold
banks to be received by the oollectors of the several
ports r Comptroller llulburd says lie thinks that no
change of the kind will be made. When the bill
authorizing the establishment of gold banks was
pending at the last session of Congress It was sub
mitted to him for suggestions, and the proposition
to allow these notes to bo received at the Custom
Ilouso In payment of duties was thoroughly dis
cussed. Admitting they were always worth their
full value In coin, they could not be mane legal
tender; and. If receivable for oustoms, toe govern
ment would be at an expense and trouble in pre
senting them to the banks for redemption, li was
thought better, therefore, to limit tlieir use to tho
mercantile community exclusively, and wait until
the government resumed sjiecie payment berore de
parting from present usages. Besides, I11 the busi
ness transactions of merchants, tho aggregation of
any great number of these bills upon unv one bank
would subject the bank required to redeem tliein
very often to an Inconvenience, which could be
hotter averted under the present system of doing
business.

portance taken up by the liouso after hearing the
President's Message was one giving something over
one million acres of land to build the St. Croix und
Bayfield Railroad. This franchise, if granted, will
be under the control, so I am Informed by members,
or that financial I'eter Funk, Mr. Jay Cooke. It will
be likely to pass. A few motnbers will put them

A large number of land bills have boon introduced
besides th'jse Included 111 the above list, out as there
has Deen nooillcial estimate of the land demanded,
and they are not likely to get through, 1 cannot slate
their amount. It is sufficient to state that Congress
Is at the present time entertaining .he proposition
to give away 1*9, 224,920 acres of the people's laud.
Previous Congresses bavo given t? certain favored
corporations over 220,000,000 acre) oi cholco land,
loaned them tbo credit of the United States to toe
amouut of ?12s, 914.640, and granted them authority
to issue an anlbnited amount of "bonds authorized
by the United States government."
ASTOU.NIMM? FACTS.
The lands already given to corporations bv
Conzress, together with those proposed io bo
given by the present CongroM, amount, accord
tug to the lowest official estimate, to the
astounding aggiegate of 409, 224.920 acres !
The amount of land thus squandered by
Cotvgress is more by 6,050,280 acres than Is contained
in the entire arsa of Maine, New Hampshire, Ver

New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. Delaware,
Maryland, Ohio, Virginia. North aud South Carolina,
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Loui

TIIE TWKNTT STATES
above named contain an aggregate of 893, 168, WO
acres. If the stibstdj Jobbers get the amount de
manded in the flity-tve bills now pending they will
have, including the gilts of the previous Congresses,
not less than 409,221.920 acres, almost enough to
build aud equip half the railroads in the Cuited
