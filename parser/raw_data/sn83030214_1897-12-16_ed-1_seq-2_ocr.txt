Ihtg evening In the Qaneaee Valley Club houaa

Edward Simmon?, pre??ld?MH of the New-York Clear?

National Bank. Mr. Blmmon? ?pok? In part a?
folio?? -
The first problem In our polltloo-flnanclal situa?
tion Is the deficit In our revenues. Hardly was
1'rerli.ent McKinley installed In the White Horn?
when Congress met and prepared the Dlngley Tariff
bill, for the avowed purpose of at least balancing
our nscvijits and aur expenditures. That It baa hith?
erto attained this end cannot be said. Pesslrai?-? call
It a tariff for deficit only, and gloomily predi?* an?
other Issue of Government bonds. Art we, as
prudent business men and patriots, Justified In con?
demning th? new tariff law a: this time? The tree
de*?, nor, tear fn.lt immediately after it Is planted.
I? It not right and fair to put off our Judgment until
we can am how the law will act under normal con?
ditions? The current year's imports were anucl
?iated to a large extent while Congress was preparj
ng the Dlngley measure What has been Imponed
since the h 11 went Into operation Is no fair criterion
of what wll be Imported when normal conditions pre?
vail In business. Let us be patient and reasonable,
and bear lr. mind that a ?table, unchanging rsv?au?
measure, even If defective, is often petter thnji
perpetual agitation and unrest. If after a fair
trial exp?rience at last decides against the Dlngley
?ttfimrs, then It will be the duty of Congr?sss to
provide for more revenue, which can easily oe done
without throwing our country Into renewed spa?nis
of business alarm.
The currency question is undoubtedly th? most
important question that now faces the Government,
and every Banker and everv citizen, from Maine to
the Rio Grande, owe? a debt of gTatltude to the
?Pr*?ldent for th? manly and decided stand he has
taken In favor of currency reform. How urgent
currency reform Is wo business men have felt every
d?iy and every hour ot the day. The South and
West have felt It, and cry for more money and a
more elastic currency. New-England haa felt it
?jid proclaims that ths Government must go out of
the banking business, and by only coining money
and regulating the value thereof keep lteflf within
the limlia prescribed for It by the Federal Con?
stitution
Mr. McKinley, In hi? admirable Message, has laid
before th? country a calm, convine.ng statement
showing that prompt action by Congress on cur?
rency Is demanded. Fxjr my part. 1 hall with satis?
faction the President's proposal that when our rev?
enues are equal to our expenditure? the greenback?
paid into the I'nlted 8'ates Treaaury ?hall not be
reissued excert for gold. If this should be done,
the so-called endless chain will be broken, and the
Governmental gold reserve will be protected from
dangerous encroachment In time of panic.
I cannot allow the present occasion to pass with?
out a word of praise for ?Secretary trage. No less
earnest than the President In urging th? iromadl
oxa taking up if thi? all-important measure, he
f?roves by his report that he nas spared no pains
n Btudytng the knotty question, and that he la de?

by Mr. Roots:
"Th? endless chain would be a thing of the post
with a full Treaaury, ??peclally if the greenbacks
were reissued only in exchange for gold. As to the
National banks. If a flfty-y?sar bond at 1 cer cent

th? bar k?= be permitted to Issu? 80 per cent In

Richard Croker waa In the city for three hours
yesterday morning, In consultation with several
Tammany politicians. Even some of his most
Intimate associates did not know of his flying
visit here. His business partner. Peter F. Meyer,
said that Mr. Croker had not come to the city nt
all. The same statement was made by several
other men.
The facts, as learned from a man who did see
and talk with Mr. Croker, are as follows: Mr.
Croker reached New-York from Wanhlngton at
0:30 o'clock yesterday morning. He went di?
rectly to the Murray Hill Hotel, where he was
met by John F. Carro'.!. Mr. Croker was in con?
sultation with Mr. Carroll for more than an !
hour, when Major James W. Hinkley, ex-chalr- ?
man of the Democratic State Committee, called ?
upon him, and the three talked together for j
some time. It was the Intention of Major Hlnk
lay to accompany Mr. Croker on his return trip
to Lakewood, N. J This he did not do. and Mr.
Croker left the hotel alone a little before noon,
and took the train for Lakewood.
Tammany men In the city who learned of Mr.
Crokcr's hasty visit and conference at the Mur?
ray Hill Hotel said last evening that he prob?
ably had come to the city to give some directions
about the business to be transacted this after?
noon at the meeting of the Tammany Executive

the orders to turn him down in the organiza?
tion, and there may be Interesting developments
at the meeting this afternoon or at the meet?
ing to-morrow evening. It waa reported yes?
terday that the enemies of Mr. Sheehan In the
Tammany organlzatlcn were willing to have
Henry D. Purroy come back Into the fold, and
that there had been some conferences to that
end In which Mr. Croker had been interested.
Mr. Purroy's enmity of Mr. Sheehan was the
main reason for Mr. Purroy'? withdrawal from
the organization, It was said, and Mr. Purroy
was willing to return to Tammany as a sup?
porter of Mr. Croker en the condition that Mr.
Sheehan wr.s "turned down" and prevented from
being a power ?n tha organization.

The report, exclusively published In yester?

planned for this city Is likely to extend to
Brooklyn, by the direct connection of the tinder
ground railroad with the tunnel proposed to be
constructed under the East River from Fur
man-st., Brooklyn, to Ann-st., New-York, was
fully confirmed yesterday.
As was explained yesterday, the Influential
syndicate, which comprises atn,?nc Its members
representatives of the Astor and Vandc-rbllt
Interests, J. Pierpont Morgan and a number of
foreign capitalists, represented by th? Deutsche
Bank of Berlin, and which ha?? been formed for
the express purpose of bidding for the building
and opea-atlon of the proposed underground road.
has obtained control of the East Hiver lunnel. ,
The franchise for thi? suoway was secured In
the first plac? by s corporation known a* tho :
New Turk and Brooklyn Hallway ?'ompany, but ,
arrangements have been made by the syndicate
whereby It has practically absorbed the Interest
of the former company. It was admitted yes- '
terday that should the contract for coi.strutting >
the new rapid transit railroad be awarded to the
syndicate, it will also at the same time pr?.?.d
to bore the Furmar,-st. and Ann-st. tunnel,
which will then be J?-?lned to the underground
line somewhere near the Postoffloe. .
The advantaftcs wh'.ch the r?silient, of this
city and Brooklyn would derive from such s :
continuity of transport facilities are incalcula?
ble. One benefit alon? which they would possi?
bly obtain wouid be th? privilege uf riding from
any part of New-York to Brooklyn for a single
far?.
MR. 80OTSMITIT ADMITS IT.
?Charles Sooysmlth, the engineer who prepared
the estimates on which the syndicate will base
its bid for the building of the underground roal,
Is also preparing eslln.ates of the cost ?if the
projected tunnel. When sftcn at his office, No.
19 Broad-st., yesterday, r.e acknowledged that a '
common Interest exi.-ied between the New-York
and Brooklyn Hallway ? 'ompany and the syndl- :
cata for which he was acting. Just what th? j
understanding between tn? two bodies Is, how- I
ever, he expressed himself unwilling to make |
public, but he gave tt as his opinion that sh"ii!d !
the syndicate's bid for the undsrground road be
ac-eptcd. work WOUld undoubtedly be started
upon the excavati"n of the EaM Hiver tunnel in '
time for the practically *!nHiltane,-i".s completion '
of the two projects. Mr. tSoojrsmlth a lid that
he was unable to say whether the syndicate
would go ahead with th? tunnel ?civine in cas?
the underground railroad plan? should be de?
feated.
Although It Is known that several large t'Telgn
capitalists are interested in the syn?lica?e re
fened to, the greater part of the money re?
quired to deposit as a guarantee and to b. ex?
pended In constructing the lin?, until the city
begins to make payments to the contractor?,
will be supplied by well-known New-York bank?
ers and financiers. Th? names of then? mer will

BU8BN??LL A CANDIDATE FOR SENATOR.
A QI'IET CAMPAIGN IN OHIO triTH TUB PtTtmsa
OF UOWMIMQ MR HAN'N'A.
Toledo, Ohio Dec. 15 (8pecial) ? "Governor Asa &
Bushiiell Is an active candidate for United S'ales
Senator." Tl-.!s statement was mad? to-day by ont
who Is very close to the Governor. The tlovernoc
and hi* friends, he add?**, had be?n working quietly
tor months to perfect sn organisation, and had re?
ceived all sorts of encouragement frutn every sec?
tlon of (?hlo.
?Mr. Kurtr. who has charge of the Governor'i
campaign, has been over the State, and has pk-ked
out those districts where the antl-Hanna sentiment
Is most^decKV-d. and where the Republicans elected
their members to the Les,lalnt?ire. In some rases
the member? elected are opposed to Senator Hanna,
but they ?re not dl?poa.vl to break away from ths
Instructions given at the Toledo convention. Mr.
Kurts Bgursa that he can get at least twelve Re?
publicans away from Mr. Hanna, and In this way
he hop<?9 to encompass the defeat cf Ohio's Junior
Senator.
A con.erc.ic* of the Democrstlc members of th*
Legislature has been called to be held In Colum?
bus, and the purpose of this moetliih' Is to sound
th? Democrats und determine how far they ere
willing to so to Insure Hanna's defeat. Mr. Kurts
will unfold so much of tila acheme aa he thinks
neceasary, and will give the Demt>crats an oppor?
tunity to make a proposition. He will adroitly lead
up to th? name of Governor Buahnell, and observe
Its effeot on the conference. His future action will
depend on re? .It.?
It comes from a trustworthy eource that more Is
Invoivi-d than the election of a United States Sena?
tor. In fact, thl* Is the opening gun of the battle
to be fought In 1900. It Is allege?! here that Platt
and t?uuy !?u\ ? taken tip the cudgela against Sena?
tor Harina. Senator Foraker's position Is some?
what anomalous. He admits that he knows what
la going on. but says that it Is not bis tight, und
that he will not take any part In it.
