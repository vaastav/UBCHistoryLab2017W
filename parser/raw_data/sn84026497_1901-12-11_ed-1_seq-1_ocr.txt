11111I especially their women mid ell

and muny Ucrj iinublv to tain uiliuit

Mr. Cockran, in upeuiur his sililress,
said that however men may dilfcr a limit
the line- of the South Allium ic
liublics nil are ngreed Unit the rcstoia
lion of peine is in I lie highest degree
desirable. I here are but two ways in
which the war can bo terminated cither
the liners must surrender, or the Eug
lish tovcii nl must nl. 1110I. m the at
tempt to subdue I lu ni. It is quite gen
crally iishihiiisI that Hie icsistance of
the liners cannot be successful and if
tins be true they would mil be iustitied
in continuing a struggle which involved
fruitless loss uf life 11 nil waste of prup
city.
Mr. Cm k 1 mii then entered upiin nil nr
giiiueut to show that the resistance of .In.
Itners is not hopeless, lie declared that
Lord Salisbury's .;li,,n Hint nothing
lint 11 1. solute Hiirreinler would he cini.sid
cred lins Im-cii nlrindoiieil, and Hint to
day the burghers could secure almost any
terms, ghort of complete and explicit ac
knowledgment of their independence.
Tlie speaker declared further Hint if
the lloer resistance Ik- prolonged for a
few 111. mills die abandonment nf the
hIi'Ul'kIc to subdue III. 111 by (ireat Unt
il in is inevitable.
The trend nf tlie nigiiment was that
it would be impossible for the Itrilish
govei iiment lo secure the passage of
many more war appropriations through
tlie house of commons and if the lluer
forces can hold the li.-l.l a little longer
tlie attempt In subline the republics must
be nhuiiilnucd, for luck of menus to pur
mie it.
-Mr. Ciskran declared: "Nothing (nn
be cle.-iier than that the resistance of
the burghers cannot be suppressed, and
therefore Hie only possible n to pence
is the withdrawal of (.'rent Itiiutin from
the attempt to subjugate Hie South Af
rican icpulilics.
"The pretense that the existence of
these republics endangered British au
thority over Hie lest of South Africa la
unworthy of serious consideration. If re
publics mil inomirchitil aullmiily ore so
hostile Ilia) their mere nioximity involves
couilii t Mwccn t In-ill. this country woulH
be
justitieil iu annexing Cauailn us u
ssnry iiicnsiire of protectimi fur its
own safety. The real interest nf ih
English cs.ple is in exteinling the lo-
niaiu nf l.uglish conunerce, not in ex
teiiiling '.he domain of the English crown.
If the South African republics were
subdued ami the Inst liner disarmed, the
men and women now confined iu captivity
must be retnr I to the soil. To main
tain iiuthoiity over these people, resent
ful, dissatisfied, accustomed to hearing
nrnis, would require the maintenance of
a huge urniy and such nn nnny could not
be maintained without establishing com
pulsory military service iu Great Britain,
which would tic the ruin of the Iliitish
ciiiistitiition.
'The coiiiiiet of the Transvaal, while
it might Is- dangerous to the burghers,
would be ratal In Enclnnd. The people
who linve the crentist interest of nil
in the defeat of English amis nrc the
I P'e of England. They can Ik; saved
from this evil. Civilisation can be de
livered frnni this cloud which darkens its
hoiixon if tlie conscience of the English
people be awakened. To do this the
most effective means is to show- them
that the people of this country do not
sympathise with tlie scheme of ninipiest
which Hie English government has un
dertaken. rioviilcnce has so ordered events that
Hie president or the I nite.l Slates can
compose this hitter i.uarrel. It is an ex
tinoriliunry opportunity offered In nu ex
trnonliiiiiry man; it would not he neces
sary lo draw the swnrd, to make any
threat of armed intervention, due word
spoken to the English ambassador ur in
the bearing of the English nation would

The resolutions which were adopted
directed "a respectful but urgent peti
tion to the president f tlie Tinted States
