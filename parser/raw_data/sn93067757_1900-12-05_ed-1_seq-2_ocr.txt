What is known as the short,
session of Congress convened
Monday at noon, pursuant to
Constitutional provision. It
will last till March 4th. The
President's voluminous message
was read the first thing.
It. is a matter of regret not
only to the members of the
Methodist congregation here,
but to all our citizens, that Rev.
A. N. Brunson has been taken
from Lancaster. But all will
lto glad|that since Mr. Brunson
is to leave us, his place will be
filled by one whom Lancaster
regretted loosing a few year ago,

Brunson goes buck to Yorkvillo
and Mr Stcadnian returns to
Lancaster.
President McKinley makes
the following reference in his
message to the necessity of increasing
the army :
It must be apparent that we
will require an army of about
(>0,000, and that during present
conditions in Cuba and the
ti.? r? u - ? >'

liave authority to increase the
force to the present number of
100,000. Included in this
number authority should he
given to raise native troops in
the Philippines up to 15,000
which the Taft commission believe
will he effective in detecting
and suppressing guerillas,
assassins and Ladrones than
our own soldier.
The full discussion of this
subject by the Secretary of War
in his annual report is called to
your earnest attention.
I renew the recommendation
made in my last annual message
that the Congress provide a
special medal of honor for the
volunteers, regulars, sailors and
marines on duty in the Philippines
who voluntarily remained
in the service after their terms
of enlistment had expired.
I favor the recommendation
of the Socretary of War for the
detail of officers from the line
of army when vacancies occur
occur in the adjutant gen
rral's department, inspector
general's department, fjuartermaster
general's department,
subsistence department, pay department,
ordnance department
and signal corps. The army
cannot be too highly commend
ed for its faithful and effective
service in active military operations
i0 the field and the ditfik
cult work of civil administra
tion.
Concerning affairs in tin
Philippines lie says :
While seeking to impress upor
you that the grave responsibility
of the future government ol
those islands rests with the con
gress of the United States, J
abstained from recommending
at that time a specific and fina
form of government for the tor
ritory actually held by tlu
United States forces, and as
long as insurrection continues
that the military must necessarily
be supreme. I stated my
purpose, until the congress shall
have made known the formal
expression of its will, to use tlu
authority vested in me by the
constitution and the statutes tc
uphold the sovereignty of those
distant islands, as in all other
places where our flag rightfully
floats, placing, to that end at
the disposal of the army and
navy all means which the liberality
of congress and the people
have provided. No contrary
expression of the congress having
been made, 1 steadfastly
pursued the purpose so declared
employing the civil arm as well
toward the accomplishment of
pacification, and the institution
of local governments within the
lines of authority and law.
Progress in the hoped for direction
has been favorable. Our
forces have successfully controlled
the greater part of the
islands, overcoming the organized
forces of the insurgents
and carrying order and administrative
regularity to all quarters.
What opposition remains
is, for the most part, scattered,
obeying no concerted plan of
strategic action, operating only
by the methods common to the
traditions of guerilla warfare,
which, while ineffective to alter
the general control now established,
are still sufficient to
beget insecurity among the popillations
that have felt the good
results of our c mtroi and thus
delay the conferment upon them
of the fuller measures of local
self-government, of education
and of industrial and agricultural
development which we stand
ready to give them.
how to Cure Croup.
Mr. R. Cray, who lives near Atnenia,
Ductless county, X. Y? says: "Chain beriaiiis's
Conjfh Remedy is tlie best
medicine 1 have ever used. It is a line
children's remedy for croup and never
fails* to cure. When given as .soon as
the child becomes hoarse, or even
after the croupy cough has developed,
it will prevent the attack. This
should he borne in mind and a hottle

ready for instant use as soon as these
symptoms appear. For sale by J. F.
