TEE SILVER DOLLAR.
There ib no doubt but what a strong
effort -will be made in Congress this -win
texto repeal the law for the coinage of
tho silver dollar. This is foreshadowed
by tho reports of the Director of the
Mint, the Comptroller of the Currency,
the Secretary of tho Treasury and the
President's message. The President in
his message sugar coats the proposition
by suggesting tho repeal of tho law fix¬
ing tho amount of silver that shall bo
coined, and leaving it to be regulated
by the demand. Tho unanimous oppo¬
sition to the silver dollar exhibited by
the leading Treasury officials would in¬
dicate that the passage of such a bill
would accomplish tho object of the most
extreme monometallism i. a, stop tho
coinage entirely.
The whole country, but more espe¬
cially the silver producing portions of
tho "West, arc interested in this ques¬
tion.
The return of financial prosperity to
tho country can be dated from the ro-
monetization of silver, and the coma;
of the silver dollar has been of untold
benefit to the industrial interests of the
country.
The remonetization of silver and the
coinage of the -H2J grain eilverlollar
was bitterly opposed by the monometal
lists, and the direst consequence were
predicted to follow this introdnction of
"what they were pleased to tern? a cheap
money. Hone of these predictions have
come to pass, but on the contrary the
country has been generally prosperous.
One of the misfortunes which' was to
follow the use of silverin thuCommercol
of the nation was the withdrawal of
gold from the country. We wero as
suredthat this would be the inevitablo
result of a cheap currency, and the
United States would bo shut out from
among the great commercial nations of
the world, and be classed with China,
India and other silver using nations.
This is hardly tho case. In spite of
the remonetization of silver and the
continued coinage of tho -112 grain
dollar this country has beon making
continual drafts upon the stock of gold
in those countries which attempt to
make gold the solo representative of
value. To prevent this continued drain
those countries have been forced to re¬
sort to every conceivable expedient, but
without success; and to-day gold is com¬
ing to this country in a continuous
stream that threatens to foreo the dual
standard in all Europe.
What new argument or reason the
monometallists are going to assign for
'"stopping the coinage of silver, we can¬
not conceive. In the face of the past
few years' experience, they certainly can
not say that it will either destroy our
creditor drive out gold. Past experi¬
ence disproves both those objections.
We are inclined to the opinion that
the objection to silver money grows out
of the fact that so long as it is used in
any considerable quantity as a circulat¬
ing medium, t is impossible for a few
men to control and corner the money
market. That is one of the chief bciie-
has derived from the i
"j V.l

been so satisfactory in its results.

t
Tiiebe is a lively contest over the
Utah delegate in Congress. Allen G.
Campbell, tho anti-Mormon candidate,
has issued a printed statement to-day.
in which he sets forth that it is great
error to speak of Georgo Q. Cannon as
Jhe sitting Delegate, for he (Campbell;
holds the Governor's certificate of elec¬
tion, and Cannon is the contestant, hav¬
ing filed notice of contest on the 20th
day of last January. Campboll adds:
"The anomalous condition of this case
arises from the extraordinary action of
the Clerk, who, in defiance of tho certi
ficatc of Campbell and the decision of
tho Court against Cannon, has placed
Cannon's name on the roll as a sitting
Delegate; while at tho same time Can
non is a contestant for the seat. Such
an evidently crooked proceeding must
at once arrest attention, and when at
least one of the grounds of Campbell's
answ.-ineff.he n"i3 of contest, viz., that
"Cannon is jEuen and iuoligible to the
office of Delegate, has sinco been sus¬
tained by an adjudication of the United
States District Court of Utah, holding
that his pretended naturalization pa¬
pers are wid on their face, the outrage
of putting him on the roll as a Bitting
Delegate is too palpable for apology.
In the Forty-third Congress, Cannon
himself held the Governor's certificate
and his right to be sworn in was con¬
tested by George A. Maxwell, a prece¬
dent was established. Cox and Potter
of New York, Hoar of Massachusetts,
Maynard of Tennessee, and others, in¬
sisted that Cannon had the certificate of
election from the Governor of tho Ter¬
ritory, he must be sworn in, and it whs
done accordingly. It remains to be
seen whether this precedent will be fol¬
lowed, now that the conditions are re¬
versed."

nrn water QOBeno:;.
We regard this question as one of vi¬
tal importance to tho city and one upon
which tho citizens of Tucson want all the
information obtainable. The Citizex
has therefore opened its columns to the
free disenwion, pro and eon, of the pend¬
ing schome, and shall continue to do so.
There is a general, and we might say a
unanimous feeling, in favor of some sys-
tom of water works.
The public now want to be satisfied
that the plan under consideration will
furnish the purest wator possible to bo
obtained. With a view to furnishing
the pub-lie with information on this point
we reproduce an editorial which appear¬
ed in the San Francisco Chronicle of
July 12, 1881, discussing tho question of
" Artesian and Surface Water," which is
made more important by the extract
from tho report of Win. J. McAlpine, a
civil engineer and hydrologist of great
repute. The Chronicle says:
The -Bulletin of last evening published
in the disguise of a communication a
statoment about the Chronicles artesian
well and water, which is false in its
premises, and which we think the
writer knows to be so. He says tho
boring of this well was continued 100
feet through serpentine, " without
water, except from the surface drainage
at the upper end." By " upper end " ho
implies that part of part of the bore
from tho surface of the earth to tho
point where the rock or serpentine be¬
gins, thirty feet from the surface. The
oxact truth is this: No water obtained
either at the top of the serpentine or
rock, nor till the rock had been pene¬
trated luu lect, where a fissure was
struck and an abundant supply obtain¬
ed, such as it is, and it is exactly what
we have heretofore described it; that is
to say, artesian water from tbe common
reservoir or source of supply that feeds
all the artesian wells on this peninsula;
charged with minerals and other poisons
tbat render it undrinkable and therefore
a household nuisance. If the water of-j
the Chronicle well came, as the writer
says, from the surface drainage along
tbe surface o( tlie rock stratum, wtuciiis
but thirty feet from the street snrfaee,
it would surely rise in the iron piie to
within thirty feet of the surface; but in
fact it does not rise higher than 3Ti or -K)
feet.
The Bulletin wil'. hardly venture to
say, editorially, what it has permitted
una anonymous writer to insinuate
namely, that the average artesian water
obtained here is purer than or essen¬
tially different from that supplied by the
Chronicle well. Whoever understands
the principles of artesian supply knows
that on a narrow eninsula like this
even- well that jtenetrates to the stra¬
tum which is the common reservoir,
must get tlte same kind of water. But
if it doen, we shall then apjieal from our
own demonstrated facts to an authority
which not even the Bulletin can dare
question. In 1878 (July 15th) that paper
presented an eloquent, out well-merited
compliment to the great enirineeriiig
abilities of William J. McAlpine. It
descriled him as "one of the most emi¬
nent engineer now living"; as the Chief
Engineer of the Albany, New York and
Chicago water works: "one of the four
oldest members of the Institution of
Civil Engineer, and for many years itd
President"; "for several years the only
American member of the Institution of
Civil Engineers of Great Britain: a
member of the Institution of Civil En¬
gineers of France, Austria," etc., with a
rising inflection through an article of
some length. In 1ST!) this same distin¬
guished civil engineer and experienced
hydrologist wrote a report on the sub¬
ject of the water supply of San Fran¬
cisco, from wtucu we here present a few
extracts:

A dispatch: from from Washington
says: " It is now rumored that General
Carr, whose name became so familiar to
tho country in connection with tho Apa-
che outbreak in Arizona, is likely to get
tho next Brigadier Generalship. The
vacancy is protty suro to occur during
the coming winter by the retiring of
Gen. McDowell, which will promote one
of the Brigadiers probably Gen. jTerry
and then, of course, a Colonel ivould
be moved up to a Brigadiorship. u tho
event of General Carr's selectim he
wotdd probably be given comma id of
the Department in whichhe lias won dis¬
tinction." We wish such a changij leould
have taken place prior to the latcChiri-
cahua outbreak. Then we wouli have
had a competent Indian fighter in charge
and tho result of the campaign would
have boeu much more satisfactory to the
troops, and certainly to the citizens of
the Territory.
John Sh En max, who, as Secretary of
the Treasury, opposed the 3 per cent,
funding bill, has now himself intro¬
duced a funding bill fixing that rate of
interest. The following is the text of
tho bill:
Section 1. The Secretary of the
Treasury is hereby authorized to receive
at the Treasury of tho United States
lawful money of the United States to
the amount o'f S00 or any multiple, and
to issue in exchange therefor an equal
amount of retristered or coupon bonds
of the denomination of S00, S100, $500,
S1000 and 810,000 in such form as ho
may proscribe, bearing interest at tho
rate of !5 per cent, per annum, payable
at the pleasure of tho United States
after the first dav of January. 1SS7, the
order of their payment to be determined
by Congress, or, in the absence of such
legislation, by rules and regulations to
be prescribed bv tho Secretary of tho
Treasurv. The money deposited under
this act shall be promptly apphed solely
to tho redemption of tho bonds of the
United States bearing 36 per cent- in-
test; aud the aggregate amount of de¬
posits under this act shall not exceed
the sum of $300,000,000.

Wo think wo ha ve quoted enoueh from
Mr. McAlpiue's report to show that ho
perfectly agrees with us in the argument
through all its details; and also to show
that there is not anil cannot possibly be
such a thing as pure, or clean, or healthy
water drawn from any well within this
city. At the time the McAlpine report
was made it was not as well known as it
now is, that mIIh, saltpeter and other
minerals are mixed with onr artesian
supply. Tliesc, of course, add to the
umleairabiiity of tbe water for house¬
hold uses.
A Salt Lake dispatch says that the
one of tho President's message gives
great hope to the Gentiles, and the Mor¬
mons aro anxious. I lie Deseret isews
did not issue this evening, thepaperonn-
clnding to wait until morning, and give
the full text of tho message. The Tri¬
bune office has been crowded with lead¬
ing Gentiles, dhscussing the message,
and although it gives great satisfaction,
many express tho fear that it will all end
in Bmolisjisual. A now church has
h' " ' een organized "here hy 5iormonf,
who claim that Brigham Young, John
Taylor and Mr. Kimball introduced the
doctrine of polygamy and blood atone¬
ment, contrary to the original belief.
Some polygamhts are joining this
church, renouncing their polygamy and
refusing to pay any more tithes. Tlie
last issue of the Quarterly Keview, a
Mormon magazine, calls for a dissolu¬
tion of partnership between the Church
and tho State, and advocates an itnti-
tnbernacle party to try its fctreugth at
the next municipal election, to over¬
throw the irksome church rule. The
timo was never riper for a crushing out
of polygamy than at present, as the
Mormon masses arc growing more dis¬
contented with tho throne rule of the
church.
Thx demand for a thorough system of
water work is iirjierative and certainly
does not admit of delay. There appears
to be no prospect of the city's securing
this needed improvement under the
franchise already jrranted. Thatlteing
the case it w certainly an wise to hold the
matter longer in olteyance. The City
Council should take khcIi action as will
secure the speedy construction of water
works. Now is the time to inaugurate
the enterprise, if we expect lo )iav tlie
benefit during the hot months of the
coming year, "'lms members of the City
Council should thoroughly investigate
the matter aud act for the liest interests
of Thcbdu. It certainly is not for the
good tf our city to hare a franchise koep
in force, where the parties holding it are
doing nothing to fulfill the obligations
they entered into when they asked for
ami accepted the franchise. They have
had ample time and the city li sniTered
enough through the delay. Let other
parties now have the opportunity to
step in and furnish the city with a sup¬
ply of water from any boh roe which is
adequate and healthful.
What ths Southern Tacific Will Da.
San" Fkaxcisco, December 1). Tho
Chronicle publishes an interview with
the President of the Southern Pacific
who states that the road expects to cirry
a large part of wheat of the State de¬
stined for Europe, and it will probably
be in a condition to carry one-third of
the next year's crop. If there is not suf-
ficicut ocean transportation obtainable
at Xew Orleans, the company will put
on steamers. They expect to save tho
farmers of the Stato three dollars per
ton on freight. The new route will par¬
ticularly encourage the shipment of
Hour and expecta to bring in a great
number of immigrants. If they can't
get them at such rates as they" would
like, they will take them at such rates
as can lie obtained. The tendency will
be to lower fares and freights. The new
road will have no appreciable effect on
tlie business of fhe Central Paeific, but
will open up a new country and business
for itself.

Fire at Tombstone.
Special to tlie CmzcSj
Tovbstokk, December 10. At 9:15
last evening the alarm of fire was given
by tho blowing of tbe mine whistles. A
firo was discovered near the Grand Ho¬
tel in a frame building containing
twelve roonts, run in connection with
the hotel. The fire spread rapidly, and
by fhe time the dormrtment was on the
ground had enveloped the lodging
house, assay office of W- T Jtickard and
the 6tables of Taylor & Brown. For
some reason the stream from the engine
was delayed a few minutes, but did good
service after once started. Tlie Hook
and Ladder Company did good service
tearing down small outbuildings "and
fences in the rear of the telegraph of¬
fice and Kelly's wine rooms, which
sorved to check the flame. At the first
alarm all horses in the stable wore
turned into the street and tho carriages
run out. None were lost. There was
no wind at the time, fortunately, but at
midnight the wind was blowing quite
violently. Tlie total loss is aliout $5000.
Coleman's lodgers lost $100. Arthur
Laing lost all his clothing and valuable
papers. .Nothing was saveu from the
assay oflice. Tho stable owners lost a
quantity of hay and grain. The lodg¬
ing house was insured in the Waterman
Insurance Company for S-100. Much
credit is due the Fire Department.
The Hook and Ladders had refresh¬
ment! at Hawkins & Boatman's after the
fire. A good department and tilcntv of
water (not a big bell) saved the town.

She knew L. W. Guiteau from her ear¬

of the life and character of her mother,

which ahef said: "I have heard Mrs. May

witness was questioned in regard to it.
Scovilie objected to tho reply: "I never
heard of it," and a lively discussion en¬
sued between Judge Porter and Scovilie.
Guiteau became enraged at Judge Por¬
ter and shouted. " Xow hold your thun¬
der until you get to tho jury, Judge; you
are doing this sort of thing too much."
Judge Porter, without noticing tho out¬
break, continued in a moH impressive
manner to argue this point, when Gui¬

Yesterday afternoon a small lad rode
up and down the steets trying to sell a
little jackaan wliich ho "was riding.
"How much for this boautitul jackass?"
ho shouted, at which throe alone the
street gavo a broad smile. j
"Is he genth i" asked a horsemac.
"Just like a bZ-uep," said the boy, and
a moment later the animal landed him !
clear into the crowd.
"Ain't he awful runny?" remarked the
boy as he got up. "Dad learned him
that trick," and there was a smile on his
face that would have dono credit to Gri-
maldi.
"Oliho's a daisy' continued tho lad;
"Full of vinegar and spirits; can't tire
him out."
Here the animal gave the lad a kick in
tho stomach and keeled him in the mud.
"Always trying to show off before a
crowd; I learned him that trick for the
fair," continued the lad, tryiDg to sup- j
press his tears.
Nobody wanted the jackass, and the
boy, mounting, rode to the next corner, j
where about the same performance was
repeated. All day long he rode up and j
down tlie street,extolIing the geutlcqual-
ities of the jackass and picking himself
up from the mud every time he was pitch¬
ed off. He stood up to the racket with
as much fortUtido as Casabianca on the
deck of the bjirningship until he finally
got 4 bid ot$tf Tor the jackass. This
seemed to entirely flatten ont the boy's
grit. He was thrown lrom the jackass
tor the last time, and turning homeward
left the animal in the stcct as here-
marked;

Washington, December 7. The court
room was densely crowded. Among tho
audience were Gen. Sherman and Rev.
De Witt Talniage. Tho prosecution
commenced its rebuttal to demolish the
theory of insanity. They will traverse
the ground gone over by'thedcrenseand
from the standpoint of the prosecution
will thoroughly ventilate the past life
and habits ot Guiteau, beginning with
nis early lire at Freeport and concluding
with a vast amount of the best expert
testimony obtainable iu the country.
As soon as tho Court formally opened
Guiteau addressed the Court in rather
imperious tones.
Gniteau said he did not like tho sitn-
ation m developed in his case. He had
a right to appear as counsel in his own
case, and he desired that General Grant
and Senators Conkling and Piatt and
President Arthur and tliose kind of men
who were so down on Garfield that they
would not speak to him on the 6trec"t
and would not go to the White House,
shall be put on the stand. He said he
had a right to show his jiersona! rela¬
tions to thee gentlemen.
Scovilie thou called up the subject of
President Arthur's testimony, and said
he bad not yet received any "response to
the interrogatories that the President's
evidence was absolutely essential to the
defense.
Guiteau interrupted him excitedly
with: "I don't think it at all necessary for
Genoral Arthur to bo here. I think a
good deal of General Arthur and he is
President of the United States, and I
don't think he should be bothered with
this matter. He is President of the
United States and I made him so. Ti

Terrible Opera Uoaw Disaster.
Vienna, December 9. The Ring thea¬
tre, formerly a comic opera house, where
Sarah Bernhardt recently performed,
took fire at seven o'clock last night, just
before the beginning of the opera.. The
firo was caused by tho fall of a lamp on
the stage. The house was tolerably full,
and the loss of life was great. Many
persons were injured. Sixty wero saved
by ladders and by jumping into cloths
held below. The scene was terrible, tlie
flames shooting up through the roof and
gutting the entire building.
Later One hundred and forty-five
bodies have been brought out of the
theatre dead. There are still a number
of bodies in the galleries and other ole-
vated parts ot tho building.. The chiet
cause or the catastrophe was that iu the
contusion tho iron portion separating t he
stage from the auditorium was not low¬
ered. Thousands of people assem¬
bled in tho neighboring streets, where
thej conld hear the cries ot agony or the
people at windows. Tho rapidly spread¬
ing llanies prevented the people lrom
making their exit, ami only a small por¬
tion, ot them saved themselves by iuiun-
ing from the windows, three storiosiiigl,
into cloths below.

not explored, it. is belief ed that not a
single person escaped, and that very few
escaped from tho third gallery. Tho
coriwea last recovered arc little moro
than charred fragments. Gross neglect
ia charged against tho management ot
the theatre. Tlie law prescribes the use
ot oil lamps in tho corridors of tho the¬
atres so that the exits can be discovered
in the event of the failnrc or gas, but
this precaution was utterly neglected.

Vienna, Deembor 10. Tho theater
fire was much mora disastrous than at

many less than one thousand perished.
It is probable there were GOO on the
fourth gallery. The doors opened in¬
ward and escape was impossible. Tho
passages and stairways were very nar¬
row. The building is described as a
perfect death trap. The llames filled
the auditorium almost instantly, burst¬
ing from the stage in a vast sheet and
rolling over the heads of the audience.
Many bodies were found with their
heads binned off, showing that the fire
had swept down on top of the densely
packed mass of bodies. Many appear to
have died from suffocation, while num¬
bers bear terrible evidence of n struggle
for life. Skulls wero crushed, limbs dis¬
torted and broken; arms torn from the
body and bowels protruding. 'Hie Fire

It was in the cars. The ladies were

anorama of the outside world. Sudden¬
ly he turned from the window; he be-
gau searching aliout the car, exclaiming
in a high, piping k oice: " Mamma, which

cautioned his mother. But tho boy was
not to be hushed. " I don't see the man

It is related of Franklin that from the
win-low of his office in Philadelphia he
noticed a mechanic, among a number of
oth'irs, at work on a house which was bo-
ing erected close by, who appeared to be
in a merry humor, aud who had a kind
and cheeful smile for every one he met.
Let the day be ever so cold, gloomy or
sunless, the happy smiles danced like
sunbeams on bis cheerful countenance.
Meeting him one day Franklin request¬
ed to know the secret of his constant hap¬
py How of spirits. "Its no secret, doc¬
tor," snid he, " I've got one of the best
of wives. When I go to work she always
gives me a Kind word ot enconragement
and.AiVssihtr withJier partiiur ki. and
when I go home she is sure to meet me
with a smile and kiss of welcome, and
tea is sure to be ready, and, as we chat
iu the evening, I find that she has been
doing so many little things through the
day to please me that I cannot find it in
my heart to speak an unkind word or
give an unkind look to anybody." And
Franklin adds: "What an iniluence,
then, hath woman over the heart ot man,
to soften it and make it the fountain of
good aud pure emotions. Speak gently
then; a happy smile and kind word of
greeting after the toils ot the day are
over cost uothing,andgo tartoward mak¬
ing home peaceful and happy."
"The Bible is so strict and old-fash¬

to live. "Therenrcplcnty otbooks writ¬
ten nowadays that arc moral enough iu
their teachings, and do not bind one
down as the Bible does." The old mer¬
chant turned to his desk and took out
two rulers, one ot which was slightly
bent. With each ot these he ruled a line,
and silently handed the ruled paper to
his companion. "Well," said the lad,
" What do you mean?" " One line is cot
straight aud true, is it?" When you
mark ont your path in lite, do not take
