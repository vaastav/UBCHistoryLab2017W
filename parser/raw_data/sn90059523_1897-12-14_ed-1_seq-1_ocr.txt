THE SAINT PAUL GLOBE.
WHAT CAN BE DONE
WITH HAWAII
In Case Congress Decides to Annex the Far-
Away Islands?
MAY NEVER BE FIT FOR STATEHOOD.
Question
Is Serious.
of the Ability of the United States to Perma
nently Govern the Country Unless It Is Ad
mitted Into the Union With Equal Rights— No
Provision in the Constitution for Control of
Colonies.
Special to the Globe.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.— There 1b a
very considerable number of Repub
lican congressmen whose position it
is inaccurate to describe as either "for"
or "against" annexation. They would
like to have the United States "con
trol" Hawaii; but they cannot think of
' having statehood in the American
union accorded to those islands as even
the remotest possibility. In short, they
want something that our constitutional
system has made no provision for, and
that is an annexation or alliance which
will not confer either now or at any
future date the political rights now en
joyed by the states of the Union. The
accessions of territory in the past,
proud as Americans are of these, have
put a severe strain upon the principle
of the equality of the states in the
senate. The three remaining territo
ries, Arizona, New Mexico and Okla
homa, are not being very cordially
welcomed into the Bisterhood of states
by the substantial classes of the coun
try. And while their admission is
naturally only a question of time con
servative students believe that the free
coinaflre. of states shoußd stop with our
present boundaries, and even the pros
pect that Alaska may some time be cry
ing out for statehood is not pleasant.
But what assurance is there that if
Hawaii is annexed it will never be
come a state of the Union? It is not
safe to leave to the "powers that will
be" the decision when she is prepared;
for when party feeling runs high a
majority alarmed at the prospect of
vanishing power might reach forth to
save itself by grasping Hawaii and
giving her an electoral vote, and, once
admitted, there could be no undoing
the mistake. Nevada has never been
fit for American statehood. Idaho and I
Montana are hardly better, and so who I
can say that unfitness will be sufficient
to keep Hawaii out of statehood pro
vided she once becomes a part of the
Boil of the chief American republic?
The proposal to make Hawaii a coun
ty of California is believed to be im
practicable. If this were done, some
thing heretofore unheard of in the way
of county government would have to
be devised, and the electoral troubles
in such a case would be merely trans
ferred from the Union itself to one of
the states. How would the Californians
in a close gubernatorial or legislative
contest like to have the voters on isl
ands thousands of miles away over
rule a majority of the people of the
rest of the state? It is not regarded
as wise to make any stipulation that
the Islands shall remain permanently
as a "territory." Besides being
one of the worst systems in the
world, our territorial government has
always been regarded as an anomaly
which time must sweep away. Hence
the cautious .congressmen are saying:
"Hawaii ought never to be a state —
we have too many of that kind now;
she ought not to remain a territory,
as that is only a temporary expedient
anywhere; she cannot well become a
part of any present state, and so what
are we going to do with her?"
Here is a great opportunity for origi
nality in statesmanship. If an aspir
ing young congressman who has care
fully studied constitutional systems
would only devise a colonial plan which
would meet the needs of such communi
ties as Hawaii and at the same time
be fully in accord with our fundamen
tal political theories, he would awake
to find himself famous. Everybody is
looking for some such plan, and saying
that a commission should be set to
work to devise it, but is there any
guarantee that such a commission
would be successful in its search? Ha
waii is thought to be but a forerunner
of Cuba, and perhaps other scattered
pr.rts of the Western hemisphere. It
would be but natural that the weak
and poorly governed little states of
Spanish America should rush towards
the United States, with our door once
opened. Circurcfatances have brought
these Pacific islands within American
reach a little earlier than the rest; but
once admit these, and there is no know
ing where the colonial extension ap
petite may end. If Hawaii is to be an
nexed, then, it is of enormous impor
tance that some plan should be dis
covered for its government. This is
the puzzle which makes it impossible
for a goodly number of the mo»e care
ful lawmakers to say whether they are
really for or against annexation as the
case now stands.
The division on party lines over the
Hawaiian question is rather surpris
ing. It seems as if annexatlpn were
a matter of such exceptional breadth
in national policy that the ordinary
little issues dividing political parties
ought not to enter the discussion. Dem
ocrats, as such, are fully as favorable
to the territorial expansion idea as Re
publicans, and yet in this specific case
we find the administration party nearly
solid for annexation and the opposition
party almost as united against it. Such
is the strength which the doctrine of
party fealty has gained. -.-,.,

When Representative Evans, of Ken
tucky, was asked what measures he
thought it would be necessary for coi) r
gress to take to make good the> deficft
created by the operation of the Ding
lfey act, he answered with some spirit:
"We don't need any new legislation.
What do we want it for? The Dingley
act Is not producing a deficit. \t will
work out all right;/.' , . c -_
Nevertheless", while he was making
tills bold, statement, there lay In the
file of bills referred to the ways and
means committee, of which he Is a
conspicuous member, a bill introduced
by himself on uec. 6, "reducing the in
ternal revenue tax on distilled spirits
TUESDAY MOENING, DECEMBER 14, 1897.
Many Congressmen Who Are
Neither for nor Against
Annexation Feel Doubtful
to 70 cents on each proof gallon." To
be sure that the purpose of this bill
was not misapprehended, your corre
spondent asked Mr. Evans what his
purpose was in proposing thus to re
duce the whisky tax. His prompt re
ply was that it was a measure to stim
ulate the revenues, "The present tax,"
said he, "is like a millstone resting on
production. It has paralyzed the Avhis
ky industry, and the government is not
getting the revenue out of it which
ought properly to come. Although the
secretary of the treaaury is not re
sponsible for my bill, and perhaps does
not know of Its existence, his recom
mendations are in precisely the same
line. He recognizes where the trouble
lies."
It is part of the unwritten history of
the consideration of the Dingley bill
in the secret session of the Republican
members of the ways and means com
mittee, that Mr. Dingley was urgently
advised by some of his colleagues on
the committee to permit the act to
carry a reduction of the whisky tax
such as Is now proposed by Mr. Evans;
but he would not harken to the Idea.
How he will treat the Evans bill when
It is taken up by the committee, in view
of his former attitude and of Secretary
Gage's position on the question, it will
be Interesting to observe. Meanwhile
the tariff mathematicians are putting
the case somewhat In this way: If the
Dingley bill, as Mr. Evans contends,
is producing revenue enough what does
Mr. Evans propose to do with the large
surplus, which his reduction of the
whisky tax is expected to produce?
The beet sugar campaign which has
been started by the present secretary
of agriculture has called down upon
hi? department and upon good-natur
ed members of congress a mass of cor
respondence from farmers in various
parts of the country who seem to re
gard the sugar Industry as something
into which any one of them can go in
about the same way that he would go
into dairying or bee keeping. One of
the Interested Inquirers has drawn from
Prof. H. W. Wiley, the chief sugar ex
pert of the department, a letter setting
right some popular misconceptions.
Prof. Wiley says that in one sense It is
true that the production of a crude
beet sugar in a small way is a simple
process, and that any farmer who is
equipped with a cider mill for rasping
the beets, a press for getting out the
' juice, and an evaporator suitable for
making sorghum molasses can make
sugar. The product, he warns his cor
respondent, will not be very palatable,
because it is not refined and contains
the salts and bitter principles which
make raw beet sugar and .molasses as
a rule unfit for table use.
Prof. Wiley thinks that although
such an object lessen would convince
the experimenter tha.t sugar resides In
the beet, and to that cfegree might stim
ulate him to special effort to take part
in the industry, the average farmer
would be foolish to attempt to make
his sugar successful commercially. The
profitable manufacture of sugar, he
says, can be accomplished only in fac
tories equipped with all modern appli
ances, and no beet sugar except of the
pure, refined sort can become an artifi'e
of commerce. In this particular the
beet differs from the sugar cane, which
does exude a sugar with an odor and
flavor that make It, In Its crude state,
more agreeable to many consumers
than the refined product.

GEN. WEYLER ARRANGES FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE IMTED STATES.
— Chicago Record.
SEVEN
CENT
SMDE.
CHICAGO, Dec. 13.— The wheat bulks
began to feel today the effect of prices
which they permitted last week. The
inspection sheet showed there had been
a rush of grain in this direction from
every quarter, as much probably as
400,000 bushels of contract grain in the
forty-eight hours. A little inquiry
showed that the inspection sheet did
not begin to show all the arrivals. One
elevator concern had cargoes aggregat
ing 320,000 bushels in the river, not a
bushel of which had been Inspected.
Armour and Weare had cargoes In, and
the car lots showed a jump. The ma
jority of this grain was to fill shorts
made months ago. Some of it had evi
dently been brought, however, to get
the benefit of the Chicago December
price. There was scattered December
selling, largely by elevator people,
against new receipts of this sort. Ar
mour was credited with more of it than
any other interest. The December bulls
themselves sold more or less Decem
ber in order to hasten its decline. There
was a remarkable drop in price, 7%
cents a bushel, and it was accompanied
by no corresponding exclfcment and by
no great trade. Decemajr opened at
$1.05, sold between !T51.05% and
97% cents and closed || 99Ms cents.
The January option was Influenced
by the May, as it has been all along,
dropping from 95 to 92% cents, and
closing at 93*4 cents. The Leiter party
did today what their friends thought
they ought to have done last week— let
down December. They did not sell
much because the mprket would not
take much and because Armour was
selling enough to make the price weak,

the revenue will increase, and It may
produce better. . results."
Air. Eckels, who is In the city as the
guest of the Commercial club, delivered
a speech before that body tonight, tak
ing as his subject "A Great Nation's
Weakness." He said In part: "This
nation stands out from all its sister
nations as having monetary and finan
cial laws which invite public disgrace
and private disaster. The government
now presents the rather pitiable spec
tacle of a boasted great nation resting
its monetary integrity upon the mere
chance of having a man of sound prin
ciples and strong sense of right in the
executive chair. If, by the accidency
of an election, a man of unsound views
should be placed in office, the whole
financial fabric would go to pieces, and
the country would find itself without
credit at home or standing abroad. The
banks of the country are strong enough
to undertake the Issue of all the credit
currency that circulates. If they are
too weak to support a safely guarded
bunk, note, Issye based upon assets by
which Only the commercial needs of
the country can be responded to, the
government Is not legs weak. The- ln-
Bolvejicy of Jhe one would mark the
' IhsoWelJcy o\ t he_ * °ther v |or_ when a
point is "where the combined
assess of the country's banks will not
beaiTthe volume of currency needed to
carry on the country's business, the
government, as well as the individual,
will" be hopelessly involved in bank
' ruptcy."

but they finally helped to break the
price. Everybody is still astonished
that the December bulls permitted any
such price as ruled last week. Today's
receipts clearly showed the result of
the Chicago premiums. Minneapolis ad
vices were that the Leiters had people
buying up there in order to increase
the difficulty of bringing the Minneap
olis grain down here. The elevator
people are still keeping the December
bulls in the dark as to the amount of
contract grain they are to get. Prac
tically no delivery has been made by
the big shorts, Armour and Weaie.
Carrington-Hannah delivered out 100,
--000 bushels today.
Up to about the noon hour wheat was
comparatively quiet and steady. May
opened a shade higher than Saturday's
closing price at 91*4@91%e, and during
the morning fluctuated between that
price and 91%@91%c. December, which
broke loose during the afternoon
opened V2C higher at $1.05, and up to
11:45 had not sold below $1.04. Traders
were disposed to await the announce
ment of the government crop estimate
before plunging too deeply into a sensi
tive market. The general Impression
was that the report would show a much
larger acreage harvested last summer
than the department has heretofore es
timated and this had a bearish influ
ence on the scalping sentiment, al
though a firm and slightly higher open
ing at Liverpool caused the price of
May to advance somewhat at first.
The government report when finally
posted estimated the yield at 530,000,000
bu, or from 50.000,000 to 70,000,000 bu
larger than statisticians generally have
predicted. But the report had been
pretty well discounted, and followed as
it was by a surprise in the shape of a
■ visible decrease of 100,000 bu, where an
increase of 1,000,000 bu had been
exnacted, it had little or no effect. A
feature of the early market was the
large "quantity of contract wheat added
since Saturday morning to the stock in
Chicago elevators. From unlicensed
elevators, there were transferred 197
carloads and 50,000 bu No. 1 northern
spring; by lake, 155,800 bu No. 1 north
ern spring, and by rail, 119 carloads No.
1 northern and No. 2 winter, a total of
about 425,000 bu. Nearly every re
ceiving house in the trade was In re
ceipt of inquiries from country ship
pers wHfc had from one car load to
10,000 bu, they wanted sold to arrive
for December. The uncertainty of Its
grading, however, made commission
men averse to selling in advance of its
arrival and Inspection. Northwest re
ceipts were liberal. Minneapolis and
Duluth reported 1,234 cars against 1,315
cars a week ago, and 310 the corre
sponding day of 1896. The total re
ceipts by rail at Chicago were 371 cars.
Notwithstanding the heavy receipts of
contract wheat here, the trade did not
appear to have any doubt of the abil
ity of the bull clique to take care of
all that could be brought In up to the
end of the month.
About 11:30 a. m. the price of De
cember began to weaken under a sell
ing pressure which was credited to
Armour. The decline was slow at first
but as the pressure increased and the
fact developed that December was re
ceiving practically no support the mar
ket began to slide off in a way that was
sensational in its rapidity. By 12
o'clock December had declined to $1.02,
where it remained for a short time.
Suddenly Ihe market began to slip
away J /ic and %c at a time, and in fif
teen minutes the price had struck 97% c.
Then it rebounded to 31.02, but again
declined to 99c and was bringing 99V&C
when It closed, or 5c under Saturday's
closing Price. May was, of course, af
fected bilt not severely. It declined to
90%0 during the headlong plunge of De
cember, but by closing time had
reached to 91% c, a decline for the day
of but %c. Undoubtedly the ileavy ar
rivals of contract wheat had much to
do with the decline, especially in start
ing it. but Allen & Grjer, the bull clique
PRJCB TWO CENTS— {fiyggflfp/
brokers, were mainly responsible for the
break to 97% c, their offerings being es
pecially heavy. It was regarded by
many as a move on the part of the
clique to prevent further heavy ship
ments to this market, which have been
natural in view of the much higher
prices prevailing here than in other
markets. The market was quiet, but
rather nervous at the close.
BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 13.— The Tran
script today says: Heavy grain ship
ments are being made from this port
and will probably exceed 2,000,000 of
bLEhela a month from now on. Some
big grain deals have been made lately
and steamers will have about all they
can handle. Space has been engaged
for forwarding to Liverpool 1,500,000
bushels of h«avy grain and oats during
Januaiy and February via the Ley land
line, and a prominent broker has been
i making 1 overtures to the steamship
, companies for 1,000,000 bushels, but he
could not secure the desired terms. It
is learned that the tonnage from St.
John and Portland is booked far into
March of next year.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.— Senator
Davis, of Minnesota, chairman of the
committee on foreign relations, will
proceed with the fight for Hawaiian
annexation during the coming week.
He is fully aware of the fact that
there la a big money-spending lobby
here diligently engaged in efforts to
defeat the annexation treaty. Various
interests have combined, some of them
being pure and upright, and others en
gaged in oorrupt practices. For ex
ample, it is a matter of self-interest
which brings the representative of the
Oxnards, of Nebraska, to Washington
at this time as an anti-annexationist.
The Oxnards have Invested hundreds
of thousand of dollars in the develop
ment of the beet sugar industry. Ha
waiian annexation would cripple their
business. It is not a cprrupt influence,
but an impulse of self-preservation
which Induces the Oxnards to oppose
annexation. An influx of 500,000 tons
of Hawaiian sugar annually free of
duty would seriously affect the sugar
beet business. That is but a sample of
the opposition. It comes also from
Louisiana and contiguius sugar-grow
ing sections. Senator Davis regards
this Hawaiian treaty of annexation
from a broad view of international law,
amd as a matter of party policy. The
Republican national convention having
declared .in favor of protection for Ha
waii from all the world, he says that
annexation is the best means of pro
tection, and should be accomplished,
now that it is feasible.
Senator Nelson is pushing his bank
ruptcy bill. He will probably appear
before the house committee on the ju
diciary some day during the coming
week to urge the adoption of his bill
as It passed the senate. He believes
that some bankruptcy bill, if not his
own, will be considered and adopted
by the house of representatives before
the Christmas holidays.
The caucus of Democra-ts which is to
be held in the hall of the house of rep
resentatives on Tuesday evening, will
be a lively one. The Democrats have
no well defined policy, and a number
of them declare that they are dis^aus
"fled with their leader, Mr. Bailey,
whom they claim to be too much in
harmony with Tom Reed. There will
be an abortive effort made to dislodge
Mr. Bailey, and select another for
party leadership. One of Bailey's

FARGO, N. D., Dec. IS.— One of th 6
boldest robberies In the history of the
Red river valley occurred at Argus

masked men entered the store of F. D.
Payne and commanded Mr. Payne and
C. H. Dill, a traveling man, of Fargo,
to hold up their hands. Payne took tha
matter as a joke at first "and laughed
when Dill raised his hands above his
head, but the ominous click of revol
vers and the oaths of the robbers soon
dispelled all doubt. Both men wor«
searched, and a gold watch and $4<
were taken from Dill. Payne wa.s forc
ed to give up the key to his cash draw
er and that to the postofllce, both ol
which were rifled. Here the men got
another watch and $1,000. The Payn«
Btore is the third door from the rail
road. One door south Is the general
store of M. R. Clancy. The next move
of the men was to march the two vic
tims into the street and to the Clancy
store. At the appearance of the men
Clanoy, too, thought that the whole
thing was a Joke. In the store beside
the proprietor was M. H. Hudell, a
school tecaher. The four men wure plac
ed In line. A watch and $60 were taken
from Clancy and $15 from the school
teacher. The four men were then faced
to the wall, and with a threat of in
stant death were commanded not to
move. The two robbers then disappear

in the first store some fifteen minutes
and about the same length of time In

Democrats Expect a
L>ively Time in To
night's Caucus*
stances. Bailey always keeps coot
We who oppo.se him realize his strength
in that particular, but we want a lead
er who will work with Democrats
alone, and who will not dllly dally with
Tcm Reed, nor any other Republican.
Instead of reaching some conclusion as
to party policy, it seem* quite likely
that the Democratic caucus will con
sume most of its time over Joe Bailey.
His leadership will probably be sus
tained; but another caucus will be
necessary to determine what the Dem
ocrats shall do with McKlnley'fl pro
posed policies concerning Cuba, Ha
waii, and the currency. It will ulti
mately be disclosed that the Democrats
oppose McKinley's Cuban policy, and
will insist uopn calling up the Cuban
belligerency resolution which hag
passed the senate. They will op
Hawaiian, annexation and will make
a party matter of that subject. Thi y
are hoping for the introduction of a bill
in both branches of congress-, provid
ing for annexation; because the treaty
is known to be doomed. The Demo
crats are all now wedded to the freo
silver plank of the Chicago platform,
and they will declare th^mstlves to
that effect In their caucus. There will
be lots of interesting political contro
versy in Washington, before man^
days have passed.
