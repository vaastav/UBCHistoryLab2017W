There is every indication that the pro
posed exhibition in 1W0 of the cen
tennial anniversary of the founding of
Washington as the heat of Federal Gov
ernment, will be tin event of national, as
well as local importance. Great intorest
is being taken in the project in Congress,
since it -was advocated by President Mc
Kinley in his annual message, and the
labor of the committee to whom the
matter was referred, Tjore fruit today.
Senator Hoar introduced a resolution
in the Senate, providing: for the appoint
ment of a committee of live members and
live Senators, to act with a similar com
mittee of citizens of the District, to be
appointed by the President, and also empowering-

mittee to be selected from the country at
large, to take part in the management of
the affair.
The effect of this resolution will be to
make the celebration a national Iiihtead

held by the Pope early in February for
the creation of new cardinals. At that
dat Hearty two years will have passed
since J.eo Kill has added any new mem

others will be created but not all of the
vacancies are to be filled this year. Six
or seven will be reserved until N wembt r.

urging the claims of some Frenchman,
the one most likely to receive the honor
being MoHsigttor Combes. Archb'sho. of
Cartilage. This leaves almost no margin,
for the possible creation of an American
cardinal and it Is said that a suggestion
has been made to the adherents of Arch

Commissions as the result of their ex
tended controversies. Yesterday several
members of both Commissions exchanged
culls. The American Commissioners un

would be glad to have the two Commis

The reply was that the Spaniards would,
be most pleased, but feared it would be
inadvisable, because It might be miscon

feeling existed against the Spanish Com

appeal for universal peace by the most
autocratic sovereign of the old world!
Here is a marvelous realization of Jere
miah's prophecy. "They have healed also
the hurt of the daughter of my people
iighily, saying. Peace, peace; when there
is no peace."
Remember that this innovation wa not
framed In the shape of a commendation on
the part of the minister of education, nor
is it given as a paternal counsel by the
"Littlo Father" In St. Petersburg. It is
an irrevocable edict, an immutable lav,-,
the transgres-or." of which Incur severe
punishment.
Tile new law is the direct result of 11
long tour of inspection made by Minister
Bogoierow of the s-chools in the Russian
empire. He found that the rivalry of the
girls and young ladies, especially In the
female seminaries, for the possession of
the smallest waists is exerting incalcula
ble damage on the healfh of Russian fem
ininity, and he has concluded that the
continuation of tight corsets would mean
the degeneration of the muscular Musco
vite race.
The new order has invoked a noisy
controversy throughout the land. Many
of the parents are loud In their praises
of the minister's wisdom, and as chil
dren in Russia are usually an obedient
set. there Is little trouble in the juvenile
institutions. But Minister Bogoierow
did not precalculate the pandemonium he
would stir up, for the Russian young
lady has recently been Imbued with some
of the woman's rights doctrines from the
Occident and Is getting to have a mind
of her own. With other words, sho
shakes her head defiantly and puts het;
foot down on the ministerial edict. She
threatens to boycott the young ladles'
seminaries and all schools of higher ed
ucation for women. She snys to M. Bo
goierow: "If you will insist on prohibit
ing the wearing of stays in the female
schools, there is an end to the rapid evo
lution which our sex has assumed during
this decade, from the down-trodden peas
ant slave in the rural districts and from
the parlor ornament in the cities to the
effete young Indies of modern culture.
If you will remove our stays or unloosen
our corset strings we will no longer
evolve."
The controversy has only begun, for the
great scientist. Prof. B. Gerson, has been
lir., f th ,rt "Wi rtw h ;. k.
dressed a brochure to all educational au
thorities, to school superintendents ana
to all societies for the education of wom
en. In this he points ominously to the
terrible dangers which menace the hu
man race through the wearing of corsets
and lays it on the conscience of all to do
their utmost to effect Che abolition of the
curse.
Prof. Gerson declares that the corset
prevents free respiration, in consequence
of which the passages in the lungs cannot
possibly get the benefit of the air. This
has a perilous effect on the blood, causing
blood poverty and chlororls, or green
sickness, with their various subdiseases.
Prof. Gerson further maintains that all
other physical faculties for the sutenance
and development of life suffer through the
corset. Hence the lack of healthy diges
tion, the frequency of headache, laziness
and blase qualities in modern women. In
fact, the scientist traces half of the mod
ern evils to the corset.
The Russian young lady, however, will
have none of Prof. Gerson's counsel, and
a boycott of the Russian schools is im
minent. Trnufpe of the Reform School.
The President today appointed John E.
Carpenter to be trustee of the Reform
School of the District of Columbia.

New York, Dec. 12. The stock market
opened strong, being carried upward by
the impetus of last week's revival cf
speculation. The expressions of In.llish
opinion by members of leading financial
authorities were stimulating to purchases
for both accounts. Sugar and Tobacco
reacted sharply.
There was si rush npvard of nearly
C per cent in Wheeling and JUilcc Erie

strength was shown by Delaware and
Hudson, which rose 1 1-2 per cent, Read
ing, Jersey Central, Union Pacific, Mis
souri Pacific made about the s.inie ad
vance. In the grangers only ordinary fluctua
tions interrupted the movement upward.'

at noon, a number of stocks having de
clined on realizations. Sugar made the
sensational decline of 4 1-8 per cent be
tween 11 and 12 o'clock on special causc3.

There was a fairly strong opening in
the stock market this morning, with
prices in the grangerg and several other
Issues above those of Saturday. Later in
the day there was y'onifc realizing and u,
recession fractionally all over the list.
Tlio general sentiment, however, was
rather bullish than otherwise. The con
tinuance of the good buying and the ap-
,)roaeh of the Januarv dividends make
I nosed to wait for developments.
General Electric was the featiwe of the
market this morning. It was pushed up
a half a point at t time and seemed to
be In large demand. It is perhaps not
safe to buy at the moment, but undoubt
edly the price will go higher before lorg.
The company Ms earning something over
20 per cent yearly avoiding to the be.st
figures obtainable. It Is said that as soon
us the back dividends on the 1 referred
stock are paid it is the Intention of the
company to retire this stock and pay divi
dends on the common. The outlook is a
very pretty one.
The Louisville and Nashville pool Is still
in business and the stock will be sent
much higher. It is said. The friends of
the stock are more persistent in their
prediction of an advance than ever. The
position of the company In the matter of
earnings and prospects is one of the best
among all the railroads.
It is said that the Administration has
expressed itself in favor of subsidizing
the Pacific Mall steamships, and that
this will be done within a short time. De
spite the temporary hesitation in the up
ward movement of the stock. It is freely
predicted that 50 will be reached within
a week or two, and later a much higher
price. Compared with other stocks pay
Ins the same dividends and with the
same prospects. Pacific Mail is the lowett
priced on the list.
The grangers were especially stronc
this morninp. Burlington and St. Paul
went above their previous record on this
movement and Rock Island was strong-.
Mnynard & Christian have today a letter
expressing most " bullish views with re
gard to the granger and other stocks.
They point to the fact that while prices
last year and even in ' were very nearly
as high as they are at present, the condi
tions are "almost incomparably better."
There was a continuance of the bullish
talk regarding- the Federal Steel issues
this morning. They were well bought,
especially the preferred. It seems to be
unquestioned that there will be a divi
dend on this stock of 0 per cent.
The increase of the earnings of Mis
souri Pacific for the first week of Decem-
! her was $0,000; for the year. $1.710.0:O. The
sudden accession Interest in Missouri Pa
cifls was continued today and the Stock
was fairly strong.
The earnings of Great Northern for the
first week of December Increased $ll.GO0.
From July 1 the increase has been $1,1IS,
300. The earnings of Denver and Rio
Grande for the week show an increase
of $22,000. From July 1 the increase was
$C71,CO0. St. Louis and Southwestern In
creased $18,500 and $250,000. Canadian Pa
cific's increase for the week was $37,000,
and from January 1 $1,034,00-3.

world is to be constructed in Arizona.
Full Information about this great work
Is contained in a report made by L. A'.
Navarro, consul of the Mexican govern
ment at Phoenix, in whicli lie says:
"It Is estimated that enough water is
waited from Salt River each winier to
amply irrigate 1.000,000 acres in the Salt
River Valley throughout the year were
the water properly distributed. It Is pur
posed to store these winter floods, to be
drawn from as needed during the sum
mer months, by constructing a grand res
ervoir in the mountains eome sixty miles
to the northeast of Phoenix. The project
Is very feasible from an engineering
I btandpoint. As it traverses the moun
I tains on its way to the valley the Salt
j River passes through a urwit basin in the
mountains, which has but one outlet the
canyon of the Salt River.
"The I'nlted Slates Government has
granted to the Hudson Reservoir and
Canal Company this basdn, known as the
Tonto Basin, to be used as a storage res
ervoir. The company- has completed all
its engineering work, and plans and
specifications for the dam have just been
completed. It proposes to build a dam at
the head of the canyon, where the river
emerges from the basin, thus creating a
lake which will cover eighteen square
miles to a depth of 100 to 200 feet. It
will be necessary to build a dam 200 feet
high and some 600 feet in length at the
top, although the canyon is only 200 feet
wide for the first 100 feet from the bot
tom. The Territory of Arizona has grant
ed the company the use of the channel of
the Salt River in which to convey the
water thus stored to the valley below,
and the s-tored water will therefore be
turned back into the channel as needed
and conveyed through the canyon for a
distance of thirty miles to the head of
the valley, where the first diverting dam
is found.
"To construct this great storage reser
voir, which will be the largest in the
, world, will cost, it is estimated, about
$2,500,000, and the company is now actively
' at work obtaining the necessary fund1'.
i It proposes to sell stored water to the ir-
rigating canal companies now doing busi
! neus In the valley, and It Is said that these
j companies will be very willing thus to
1 augment the limited supply which they
; now have rendy for sale to the farmers.
j "Some of the canal companies have al
( ready entered Into such contracts with the
j reservoir company. Farmers now pay for
water at the rate of $1.25 to $2.25 an aero
per annum, and the canal companies,
; when they begin to furnish water from
the reservoir, will charge the farmers an
additional $1 per acre In order to reim
burse themselves for their outlay to the
, reservoir company. It is saitl. however,
i that the farmers will be willing to pay
f this additional price, as the increased
, water supply will enable them to harvest
double the amount of their present crop1'.
It can be seen, therefore, that when this
immenso undertaking has been accom
plished Arizona will havo the greatest Ir
rigation system In the world, and the har
vest of farm products and fruits, already
abundant In the valley, will go toward
making this one of the most prosperous
regions on the globe." .
A FlKbtlysr. Word.
(From the Philadelphia North American.)
Gen. Horace Porter, who represents the United
States at Paris and represents us well, is not in
the habit of mincing words, gave perhaps in dip
lomatic negotiations, and therefore it was quite
natural for the general, when he read In Henri
Rochefort's newspaper that he was quoted as
having- said that England had financed the Drey
fus syndicate with a view of weakening France,
to say bluntly and plainly that Rochafort lied.
It was a courageous 'thing" to say especially
about Rochefort but. Gen. Porter 1s nothing if
not courageous, and he is able -to back up the
remark.

THE RTJSKXM" COLONY.
It Still Thrives nnd Hum Solved the
Labor Problem.
(From Uie London Chronicle.)
In our issue of Thursdaj last "W. B."
asked for information concerning the
Ruskin Colony in Tennessee, referred to
in a letter addressed to us by Mr. Alfred
Russel Wallace on "The Problems of the
Tropics." Another correspondent, "It. W.
R.," sends us the following particulars
on the subject:
"The promoters of 'Ruskin,' as the col
ony have ehosen to call tht-lr estate,
claim most strongly that they have al
ready solved the labor question, but time
alone can prove the validity of such a
claim. Each member of the colony, a
vigorous community of about 200 souls,
and, according to Mr. A. R. Wallace,
perhaps the best type of a co-operative
colony,' receives the same wages, no mat
ter what mny be the stale of his health,
and no matter what may be his work.
The labor day is fixed at nine hours, and
while there "is no interference permitted
with religious or domestic affairs or with
individual tastes, each member is sup
posed to suppress that instinctive desire
for natural freedom which prompts hu
man beings everywhere to Ignore the
rights of others, and every meniber is
guaranteed employment by all.
"The efatate Itself is the property of the
association, as also are the means of pro
duction and distribution, but each Indi
vidual may claim, as his own special pos
sessions, his clothing and household furni
ture. While the members enjoy a common
dining-hall and kitchen, they have sepa
rate dwellings. Of course, no police are
required, and the only officials in this
happy land are a postmaster and a notary
public. It stems thatwthe chief business of
the community 'is' lnwconnectlon with the
publishing of a socialistic weekly (th
ComliiE; Nation), which, notwithstanding
the fact that it contains no news or adver
tisements, has an outside circulation ap
proaching. In round numbers, 40 ow copies,
and, as each member receives the same
wages, wood choppers and farm hands re
joice in the receipt of salaries equal to
those paid to the editors and other mem
bers of the staff of the paper. The com
munity is composed principally of Amer
icans, among whom are a few Germans."
If any of our readers desire further par
ticulars on the subject they may obtain
them by applying to Herbert N. Casson,
Rutkin, Tenn.
LEADER WANTED.
The Deatb of Men of Coniniaudiiipr
Talent In the ActUe World.
(From the London Spectator.)
The dearth of commanding intellect in
nearly eveiy sphere of human activity
which undoubtedly mnrks the close of our
century has suggested to some minds the
doubt as to whether the age of great men
has not entirely passed away, and wheth-
t er we shall not be compelled In the fu-
j ture t otrust to the "common sense of
most" rather than to the guiding genius
of individuals of more than
the ordinary mental or moral
stature. Indeed, a whole philos
ophy of politics has been founded on the
doctrine of a kind of average human abili
ty as being all that Is needed In making
all public decisions. Collectivism, which
proposes to carry extreme democracy and
common ownership Into all the wider av
enues of life, must of necessity base itself
on this notion of the opinion or services
of one man being as useful and Impor
tant as those of another. Hero-worship,
it Is" said, represents a past order of so
ciety; we have no use for the great man
now, but in his place we put a number of
little men, and we find that the outcome
is quite as good.
"We hold no brief for the gospel of hero
worship, which was undoubtedly carried
by a Carlyle to..an extreme which cannot
be accepted. We do not believe that any
immeasurable gulf separates those whom
we call great men from those who are
not, for all share the same nature and
the work of a Shakespeare or a Mollere
would have no value whatever dlid It not
appeal to all of us, thereby revealing the
essential community of Ideas between
these great men and humbler mortals.
But there is a medium ground between
that of exaggerated hero-worship and
that of flat, unrelieved collectivism,
which places all human services on the
same dead level. Napoleon seems to us
to have divined the real nature and tend
ency of democracy much more clearly
than many of the "Ideologists" he despis
ed when he said that it meant "la car
rlere ouverte aux talents."
Instead of conceiving the new Demo
cratic age heralded by the French revolu
tion as Involving anything like a dead
level, he supposed that It meant rather
an intenser competition, but a competition
on fairer terms, in which each man would
be able to show the stuff he was made of
nnd to prove what he could do- Democ
racy can no moro dispense with guides,
leaders, powerful agents, than any pre
vious order of society; and democracy
finds that she must pay for them in some
way or other. Moreover, Instead of any
resentment being felt by a more or less
democratic community against the great
man who towers over the heads of the
crowd, democracy acclaims such a man,
eagerly expects him, is profoundly deject
ed If he does not appear, is ready to heap
honors and rewards upon him, and gen
erally allows him -(sometimes to a dan
gerous degree) to think and act for it on

his own re-pons.billty. At the pre ent mi
ment It Is as plain as can bf that th
French democracy Is on the lookou' for
a leader, a Man. The squabbles over th
Dreyfus case might almost, in the la-t
analysis, be re.-olved Into the one for
mula, accepted by millions of French peo
ple, "Give us a leader who. can think
clearly and act with decision." Almost
every tiling would be pardoned in a man of
strong character and vigorous brain who
could pilot the French vessel of state
through the stormy seas.
A glance over the world during this
democratic epoch will convince any care
ful observer that the talk about the Indi
vidual "withering" Is superficial. We are
deceived by a few material phenomena,
the outcome of scientific invention. Be
cause we are ticketed and conveyed in
trains or steamers, instead of depending
on our own energy, as In former days: be
cause shoes are turned out by machines by
the million and cotton cloth by the hun
dred million yards; because the machine
seems to dominate life, we think it is all
mere machinery. Because we do not live
In fortified castles, but in city streets
watched and tended by armies of public
servants, we are apt to think of a vague
collective authority dominating all and
directed by none. But the train Is driven
by a skilled man. the wheel of tne steamer
Is held by an expert, the cotton Is spun
and woven, the shoes are made, because
a directing brain stands behind.
Even In the great American democra
cy, where the despotism of the mass is
greatest, it interesting to observe how
strong has been the tendency to look for
a guiding from the President all through
the recent war. And in Mexico and the
whole of South America we find that, so
far as democracy exists, it is all based on
the Idea (practically, if not theoretically),
that some one Individual governs the
country, initiates its policy, stimulates Its
to action. In Europe the two great cen
tral empires are definitely governed by
the wills and Intellects of two men; and
though democracy Is restless and discon
tented, there Is no protest against this
system of sufficient strength to secure its
overthrow. In short, look where we will
among the democratic or quasi-democratic
nations of the wold, we see no
sign whatever of the lessening value of
the individual. On the contrary, the need
of Individual initiative and guidance is
everywhere recognized, and the services
of the Individual are in one way or an
other rewarded.
Tills tendency will continue, because it
s in accordance with the constitution of
human nature. The masses are quite ca
pable of appreciating the accomplished
fact, but some one person must have con
ceived and accomplished it. They are
quite capable of co-operating with the
work of some leader of men, whether po
litical, religious, or in any other sphere
of life: but the Washington, the Luther,
must be there to show the way. No
doubt democracy Is as certain a fact for
a long epoch to come as any of Its warm
est devotees have believed. But it will
be democracy tempered by the need cf
the individual who can do the one thing
that no other individual can do, who can
direct great affairs and persuade vast
human aggregates to carry them into ex
ecution. The man who can navigate Is In
valuable, even in a pirate ship.
A WAVAI STA'IJLON.
KxiiuiiHion "Will Cnuse America to
Rule the Sea.
(From the National Geocraphic Majrarine.l
Just as the Louisiana purchase In ISM
made America a steamboat nation, and
just as the acquisition of California in 184
made America a railway and telegraph na
tion, so the acquisition of Hawaii and
Porto Rico, and above all of the Philip
pines, In 1S9S must make America the na
val nation of the earth; for the problem
born of the accession would be that prob
lem of navigation which needs American
genius for Its final solution, while America
needs the Incentive to strengthen that ele
ment in which alone she Is weak. The
Philippines are remote only a. fraction so
remote in time as was California a. half
century ago, yet remote enough to compel
the invention of devices for shortening
time and annihilating space; and the prob
lem of bringing Manila within a fortn'ght
of San Francisco Is one worthy the genius
of the Inventors of the Innumerable de
vices Involved in steamboating, railroad
ing and telegraphing.
Given swift vessels, the other problems
presented by the Garden of the East are
of little consequence save as forecasting
directions for the profitable expenditure
of long-pent energy; the 7,000,000 pastoral
natives and tax-gathering Spaniards are
a far less menace to our quadrupled pop
ulation and multiplied power than were
the savage tribes and resident Mexicans
of California; while it is the special func
tion of the republican form of govern
ment to render the Inhabitants of acquir
ed territory not only self-supporting but
self-governing.
The progress of mankind may be meas
ured by advance In speed of locomotion,
beginning with fieetness of foot, coming
up through fieetness of ridden and driv
en animals, and ending with swiftness of
locomotive engines and sea-going craft;
and, with vessels of sufficient swiftness
and projectiles of sufficient velocity, there
need be little fear of foreign complica
tions, little occasion for maintaining
great navies; for, if commercial competi
tion be but aroused, individual effort may
be trusted to develop the devices required
for national protection.
