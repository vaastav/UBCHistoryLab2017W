The people of this great country
have somehow accustomed themselves
to the disappearing of the tambourine
as a medium of contributing money to
the noble work of the Salvation Army,
The home service campaigns that have
been conducted all over the country
have been wonderfully successful.
The results from this new order of
things are making themselves felt now.
Officers who under the old system
spent half of their time soliliting funds
are now enabled to put all their time
in doing the work for which they have
been trained. The results are, more
people visited and a greater number
of folks helped.
At a recent conference of Salvation
Army leaders held In Chicago the fact
was brought out that everywhere
friends are urging the Salvation Army
to continue using the Christmas ket
tles" on the streets of the various cities
and towns as a distinct feature of the
holiday season. Many folks who did
not contribute to the home service
fund have expressed the,ir desire to
assist in the work of the Salvation
army through the familiar Christmas
kettles. Arrangements have been
made accordingly, and before very long
the people of Phoenix will hear the fa
miliar "Keep the pot boiling."
We shall do what we always have
done, and see to it that no one in Phoe
nix shall go hungry during the holi
days. There will also be the mammoth
Christmas tree for all the 'poor chil
dren of the city.
There will be no regular solicita
tion of funds by the army either by
letter or otherwise, but we shall again
employ the using of the popular Christ
mas kettles.
However, if any of the citizens have
anything in goods or money they de
sire to give, we shall be glad to call
for the gift, if they will notify us by
mail or phone.
We shall also appreciate it if the
citizens will call to our attention any
case or names of poor who are not
known to us, and we shall be pleased
to visit them and shall try to help
them.

prepared for the delegates.
The part of the program already
adopted was said to contain the most
pressing subjects of the present situa
tion, including collective bargaining,
hours of labor and wages. President
Wilson's message to congress was
analyzed by the delegates for subjects
to be discussed and each was given a
place along with the subjects pro
posed by Mr. Hoover.
The delegates debated how far they
should go in studying each subject and
selected those on which expert advlc
or written data were desired.
HI OF REVENUE
LAW URGEO BY GLASS
WASHINGTON, Dec. S. Revision of
the revenue laws, so as to place a
heavier burden of tax on the normal
income, was urged by Secretary Glass
in his annual report today to congress.
Mr. Glass declared that the excess
profit tax provisions of the present
law should be eliminated and the rev
enue thus sacrificed be made up from
an increase In taxes on the average
income.
Revenue derived from the lower
amounts assessed under sur tax pro
visions of the law may well be in
creased, said Mr. Glass, who added
that the topmost amounts listed un
der these provisions already had passed
tneir useruiness. The only conse
quence of increasing the tax on the
larger sums under the sur tax law, he
said, would be to drive "possessors of
great Incomes to invest their wealth in
minons oi state and municipal securi
ties," which are whollv tax-exemnt-
The treasury plan seeks to raise
more revenue from incomes above
84,000, without attemDtlnsr to dlntnrh
Incomes of persons whose salaries
barely meet living costs, as any change
in that tax would only add a burden
on a class unable to bear It.
A mixed car of fruits and vegetables
arrived yesterday as well as a car of
late How cranberries. A car Of net
ted gem potatoes are expected today.

After exhaustive discussion today of

Avoid Unnecessary Travel
The shortage of coal necessitates a material reduction of train service. A
large number of passenger trains will be discontinued after Sunday, De
cember 7th, and the schedules of some remaining trains changed on all
the railroads in Northeastern and Central Western regions, which is the
territory, Chicago and St Louis north and west, and west to Pacific
Coast.
Detailed information will be given through the newspapers and by
ticket agent.
In this emergency the public is earnestly requested to avoid unneces
sary travel within and through the regions effected. It is very important
that those who must travel, and especially those who have made advance
purchases of tickets or sleeping car space for any date in December, shall
promptly make inquiry of local ticket agents and ascertain whether or
not the trains or cars they contemplate using have been discontinued or
changed.
The limited train service available will serve to carry only essential
travel. ':
