sentiment in favor of silver is fast
improving in the East, while the West

of free coinage or double tho coinage

The President's Message.
Tho Silver State, in commenting
on Presidont Harrison's message, hits
tho nail on tho head when it re
marks:
Harrison the Little, made President
by tho follv of Cleveland and the /?' t
'
of manufacturers, has sent tho mes
sage, in tiio preparation of which ho
has been engaged for months, to Con
gress. It is mainly n compilation of
tho reports of tho heads of Depart
ments and Bureaus and contains
neither phrase nor idea that is origi
nal. It is one of the longest messages
ever sent to Congress, and, though it
comprises about sixteen thousand
words, thero is not a strong sentenco
in it, tho President, doubtless being
impressed with the idea that tho use
of a surplusage of words in express
ing an opinion or nn idea will be
acceptcd by tho pcoplo as ovideuce of
his greatness.
Spelling Match Challenge.
Says tho Colusa Sun: A school
master in a neighboring couuty, hear

"I propose to spell with enny man,

8100 a side, tho words to bo celectod
by a eomniitty of littorary gents, and
the prize to bo rewarded by tho em
pires to tho one that misses tho few
iol words. If you hear of enuy one
who daros to take up this chalonge,
lot them pitch iu solus bolus; I'm

length, have been taken out. Occa
sionally tlio bucket is drawn up half

In several instances It has boon diffi
cult to stato precisely the occupations
of tho signers. Take tho caso of
Samuel Adams. lie studied for th?
ministry, was a morchant, and bocamo
the ablest writer of his time on public
questions. Tho word "farmor" la used
in several places where landed pro
prietor or planter would bo more fit
Ono case, a signer ? Roger Sherman, of
Connecticut ? was a shoemaker until he
was twenty-one years old, and then for
sook tho bench for tho bar. It Is diffi
cult to determine just what profession
to honor with tho name of Richard
Honry Leo. Charles Carroll, of Carroll
ton, considered tho wealthiest man in
tho colonies, was a lawyer by profession.
In regard to tho nativities of tho signer*
it will bo understood that, whllo many
woro natives of America, their fathers
of European birth. For example,
William Hooper, of North Carolina, was
born in Boston, and his father was a
Scotchman, and the father of Goorgs
Read was an Irishman. So far as pos
sible tho biographies havo been care
fully consulted, and tho tablo glvon Is
bolioved to bo substantially accurate. ?

Last night about twelve o'clock we
wero awakened from our sound slumber
by unseemly noises coming from the di
rection of our chicken-coop.
Suspocting something wrong wo lifted
our double-barreled bird-gun from its
rack over our couch (whero It alwayn
hangs heavily loaded) and stolo noise
lessly to tho window. 8eeing tho dim
outlinoof a man moving about, wo raised
our pieco and fired. Judging from the
shrill sounds of distress that followed
wo think wo must havo hit our man. lis
bolted, howovor, buforo we could lnauire
with another shot.
Early this morning, us wo *rore paus
ing Jack Taror's house, wo notlood Jock
was eating his breakfast -from off bis
mantol-pieco, and that ho did not put
much choorincs9 into his "good morn
ing" to us. We regard tho matter as ?
singular coincidenco.
Wo don't want to mako any ohargoe
against individuals; all wo want to say
to our follow townsmen (to prevent any
misunderstanding in tho futuro) Is this:
If you are going to call on our hen-coop,
it will bo a good precaution to don ft suit
of rlvotcd stool armor. We nevor wast*

Why can't pcoplo bo honest? Hare
wo got to loso our rost getting up at all
hours of the night, squirting buckshot

Wo nndoratand our paper has beea
criticised by that Blow-footed old hypo
crlt, Squoak. Aa no ono ever listens to
what tho gossiping old linbocllo has to
say, wo shall not give him tho showing
up wo had intended, but shall content
ourself with rotating an anecdote on
hlin.
Wo had always noticed what a pe
culiar white color his beard was and
how it neonicd to continuo down past his
collar.
Our suspicions being aroused womado
nomo inquiries and found our critic had
been lifted out of Nebraska on a fence
rail. Ilcforo leaving, tho thoughtful
citizens presented him with a thick,
tight-fitting suit of tar and feathers,
which ho has novor boon ablo to remove.
Ho now goes around pasting off the
feathers on his faco for a gray beaid.
Readers, this Is tho man who pasoes
