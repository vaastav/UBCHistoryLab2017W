Proposals for Peace.
Tail tie rebels fear the effect of &
- Proclamation of .mancipation baa long
tinee ceased to be matter of dooljt. The
first of January is, to them, the dawning
of a darker dsj for their prospects thr.n
. ny th;y hare yet seen. And there are
strong indications that they hare eontem
. plted terms of peace before that time, to
avoid tie certain defeat whicn mast oome
Uiereafier. - We hare already referred to
the statements of the New York Tribune
. t'at negotiations had been opened between
kding Democrats of New York and th
'1 ' h n V i t ' H . T iolimnnyl , i, viW n
settlement. This statement ' received
strong corroboration from Fernando Wood,
the leader of the tones in New York, in .a
: speech last Saturday night. He said that
be "had received information, and had
communicated it to Government, that, an-
. der lertain circumstances, the South were
: : ' : . ... ..j u. 1. - 1 I l.l
V from leading statesmen of the South. Men
1 ' of position and influence in the Confeder-
' . acy had expressed desire to return nn-
: der a Democratic rule, - the past to b for
- gotten, the pnblio debt on both sides to be
;' provided for, and. they were willing to let
bygenes be bygones, if the North would,
and the Union be odoo mors restored."
. "Such is the substance of what Wood and
bis Southern allies would make the basis
of naacc. It was hardlv necessary to hint
- t the assumption of the rebel debt, after
- stating that they would come back " un
: der Democratic rale," for any concession
' to the South would be in order under such
a state of thinirs. But that reservation of
"Democratic! rule," is of itself too much
for the proposal to be received with any
favor by the people of the North. No 1
. the rebels went out and made war under
' Republican rule, and under Republican
rule they must be made to come back.
' There is not yet any chance for condition
al peace. They must acknowledge the au
thority of the Government as administered
by the Republican administration of Abra
ham Lincoln, or we will fight them until
tluw . 1a . Wa rln tint, timmm . ri.tvMMftcr
Lincoln and putting Wood, or Seymour, or
- Vallandigham into the Presidential chair,
. for the sake of receiving their gracious ad
herence. Let them acknowledge the same
- authority which they have spurned, and
' ' 4l Ml i.TV I - tlnm
wen w win u&ie, w uicm.
;-:' ' But there is yet another proposal of set
'. tlement. A dispatch to the New York
Bunday Mercury says that it is reputed
UiC JGUGLD) w. v " J
Proclamation, and the immense armies we
- have in the field, have made overtures to
-' treat upon the following terms :
V " 1.- The old Union and the old Constitu
.. tion.
: 2. Tht Crittenden Compromite.
: 8. Tke tutumption of the Southern Debt.
4. The ordering of the French out of
Mexico, and the annexation of that country
. .for nine slave ttatet.
The audacity of this proposal renders It
i not improbable that something like it has
' r emanated from the rebels. But tSey should
' ' at least have proposed terms which were
; consistent with themselves. Inasmuch as
. the Crittenden TJompromise proposed an
- amendment to the Constitution, that and
"the Old Constitution" cannot well be had
; J at the same time. It was the North which
: ' desired the Constitution unchanged, and
' the South which desired to change it.
As to the payment of the rebel debt,
that can best be paid by con&scating the
. property of traitors. That is the quickest,
' most equitable and most justifiable course
of treatment
- Considering that the present Adminis
tration came into power upon a platform
one of the main planks of which was "no
jnore slave territory," the proposed re-
: quisition of Mexico for the purpose of
j carving it up into nine slave States, will
not be likely to find much favor, either
, with the Administration or the people.
Upon the whole, there is not much
" chance for the rebels to prevent the opera
tion of either our army or the Proclamation
by any such propositions of peace. The
President's Message will show them the
futility of any such hopes.
The President's Visit to Burnside.
A correspondent of the New York Times,
says that the visit of the President to Gen
eral Burn side, had reference to the delays
' which have taken place in the transports
. . tion of supplies to that officer. It is known
that Bnrcside was disappointed on r
riving at Falmouth, not to find his pontoon
bridge and other necessaries. The Presi
' dent went down to see about it to ascer
, tain precisely where the responsibility for
this failure rested, te assure General
. Btrrnside of his steady and hearty support
' to renew promises of all the supplies
1 and reinforcements he might need, and to
tell him that, whatever might be the pres-
-sure upon him, he wished him to fight no
-: incentive battle there. The visit was in
" tended and calculated to aid General Burn
" side's advance.
Rev. Mr. Bella aaa) kit Cfcarca.
From the New York Tribune we quote
the following item, which will be of inter
est to the many friends of Rev. James
-Eells:" ' ' . , ' ;
"The Dutch Reformed Church on the
Eights, Brooklyn, formerly under the pas
. toral care of the law Rev. Dr. Bethune,
' now ably ministered to by Rev. Dr. Eells,
- has been for several years laboring under
an incubus of debt amounting in all to
'$22,076.24. On Tuesday evening, fifty
members of the congregation met to Con
sider the subject. Their deliberations re
sulted in a subscription for the whole
- amount, payable on Monday, the 1st of
December. The number of subscribers was
Just fifty, making an aveaageof $541 each.
Chis is something to give thanks for."

The Secretary and the Soldiers.
It is about twenty years since one of
the members of the present Cabinet was a
member of. Congress from, a distant west
ern State. He had the usual right of des
ignating a single candidate for admission
to the West Paint Military Academy. The
applications made t him for a vacancy
which then existed were not many, but
among them was a letter from a boy of six
teen or seventeen years of age, who with
out any accompanying recommendation or
references, asked the appointment for
himself. The member dismissed the ap
peal from his mind, with perhaps a passing
thought of the forwardness and impudence
of the stripling who could aspire to such
a place on no other grounds than his own
desire to get a good education at the pub
lic expense. . . -
But happening a short time afterwards
to be in the little village whence the let
ter was mailed, the incident was recalled
to his memory, and he thought he- would
beguile the few hours of leisure that he had
by looking up the ambitious youth. He
made his way, by dint of much inquiry, to
a small tailor's shop on the outskirts of the
town. .. Whan he was admitted at the door
he found a lad sitting cross-legged upon
the tailor's benoh, mending a rent in an
old pair of pantaloons. But this lad had
another occupation besides his manual toil.
Near by, on a small block of wood, rested
a book of abstruse science, to which he
turned his eyes whenever they could be
transferred from the work in his hands.
The member accosted him by the name
given in the letter, and the lad replied " I
am the person." "You wish, then, to be
appointed a cadet at West Point ?" "I do,"
he rejoined. " Why" asked the Congress
man. "Because," answered the tailor
youth, " I feel that I was born for some
thing better than mending old clothes."
The member talked further with him, and
was so pleased with his frankness, his
spirit, and the rare intelligence he evinced,
that he procured him the appointment.
The member is now Secretary Smith, of
Indiana, and the youth General fiurnside,
Commander-in-Chief of the army of the Po
tomac. We should not be surprised if that
boy an excellent specimen of our North
ern mudsills were destined to hoist the
American flag to its old place on the Cap
itol at Richmond. JT. T. Eve. Pott.
The Secretary and the Soldiers. The American Minister and the Life Boat
Service.
[From the London Post, Nov. 1.]
During the fearful gales that prevailed
in the Irish Channel on Sunday night
week, the American skip Ann E. Hooper,
of Baltimore, was driven on theHorsebank
on the Lancashire coast. Immediately the
perilous position of the ship was seen Mon
day morning, the Lytham lifeboat of the
National Life Boat Institution was launch
ed and towed to windward by the Loch
Lomond steamer. After having been cast
off by the steamer, the lifeboat had to go
through a tremendously heavy sea of brok
en water, which filled her three times, but
which was rapidly self ejected. With very
great perseverance on the part of the crew,
she at last reached the ship, and with much
difficulty took oS thirteen of the crew and
a Liverpool pilot who was on board. - ;
After taking off the fourteen men, -the
rope by which the lifeboat was held to the
ship parted, but the Southport lifeboat
which also belong to the National Lifeboat
Institution, fortunately came np at the
time and took off the Captain and the re
maining three men, - On the Hon. Charles
F. Adams, the American Minister at this
Court, being informed of the rescue of his
countrymen, he communicated to the Na
tional Lifeboat Institution his satisfaction
with the great service rendered to the
crew of the ship Ann E. Hooper by the
lifeboats of that valuable society. He add
ded that he would take oare that an ac
count of the facts of the case should be
brought under the notice of the United
States Government. -
A Rich Specimen of Orthography.
Printers are expected to correct and
straighten the most outrageous chirogra
phy and orthography. The editor of the
Van Wert Bulletin had a job sent in to
him a few days ago for a " fancy job." The
parties complaining of its style, after it
was done, he publishes the original manu
script, verbatim et literatim, in vindication.
We guess those fellows won't complain
again. Here is the "copy" from which he
was to set np a fancy job '

The Unjustifiable Course of the British
Press.
The Toronto Globe, always honorable
and candid, thus speaks of the course of
the English press upon American affairs :
" But we cannot help saying that the
course of many of the British press ex
cuses, if it does not justify the action of
the few lork press. What could, for ex
ample, be worse than the wish expressed
by the Leader of this city, a few days ago,
that Britain would interfere to secure the
independence of the South an interfer
ence which would almost certainly be fol
lowed by a bloody war between the two
countries, in which Canada would be the
battle-ground? Is it strange that bitter
language should be used by American
journals towards Britain, when British
presses openly proclaim their willingness
to run the risk of a war with the United
States, in order to rivet the ohains of four
millions of slaves ? . How can we expect
good feelings from Americans when our
writers make such a display of malevo
lence?": : .:- . -
Press. The Ohio Relief Association at Washington.
A correspondent of the Gaiette writes:
"The Ohio Relief Association has adopted
a plan to assist Ohio soldiers in reference to
their pay, &c, and to prevent impositions
upon them. They hare an agent, a young
discharged soldier, at a very low price per
month, whose duty it is to be at the rail
road depot,- and at the Soldiers' Rest
where thousands of soldiers daily &n
and to direct Ohio soldiers where to get'
their pay, find lodgings or procure a meal,
and te give them any information asked
for. The young man has a badge on his
hat, in la ge letters, " Ohio Soldiers' Be
lief Association," and this attracts atten
tion. He is kept busy, and is doing a good
service for the Ohio soldiers. - It was a hap
py device, and originated from the sugges
tion of the Ohio soldier's friend, Mr. (ian
geuer. It is probable that the other relief
associations of Washington will adopt the
same plan. It is 'worthy to be copied by
all relief societies- in Washington and in
all.our large cities. . , - .

New Method of Submarine Blasting.
The Paris correspondent of the London
Times, nnder date of Oct. 29, says:
"Among the works going forward for the
improvement of the ports of France, the
new pier in progress or construction at
Havre is one of the most remarkable, En
gineers are now employed in removing the
foundation of the tower of Francis I, and
they take advantage of the high tides to
spring the mines then covered with a great
volume of water. They profit by the low
water to remove the rubbish. A new sys
tem has been introduced for the explosion
of submarine mines. Engineers no long
er make cavities in the rocks to contain
the powder ; they merely place alarge glass
bottle enclosed in a baBket at the bottom
of the sea where they mean to act, and this
bottle is filled with gunpowder in propor
tion to the effect to be produced. The
pressure of a column of water of some feet
is sufficient to compress the gas so power
fully as to cause great ravages on the soil
on which the basket is placed, even were
.it of the hardest granite. The gunpowder
is ignited by electricity by means of two
wires, which communicates the fire to the
gunpowder, in the bottie. On Thursday
morning laBt one of these submarine mines
was sprung by the engineers of the roads
and bridges, in presence of a multitude
of spectators. The charge of gunpowder
in the bottle was thirty pounds, when
the explosion took place the water rose and
formed an artificial waterspout, which
fell on the surface of the water after pro
ducing considerable undulation. The
shock resembled an earthquake and was
felt even In the town. The spectators as
sembled on the breakwater felt it tremble
nnder them as if it had been shaken by a
submarine convulsion."
An Appeal for the Southern Soldiers.
" The Atlanta Confederacy makes the following
appeal for the soldier : : i
"Men and women of the sunny South-
Did yon hear the keen wail as it shook the
rafters and whistled through every crevice
of your room last night ? Could y on sleep ?
Did no ragged, cold, shivering soldier ran
his long, oold hand over your face, and hies
in your ear, 'Wake np ! how can you thus
sleep, when I and thousands of your brave
defenders, are facing these bleak winds!,
with oar bodies half covered, our feet bare,
and oar heads uncovered, and no gloves to
prevent the skin of our hands from cleav
ing to the cold steel ?'
"Friends, in Heaven's name wake up,
open your hearts. Go to work, make and
give to the soldiers till you are conscious
you have done yonr duty."
It is proposed to have railroad ferry
boat across the British channel from Dover
to Calais. It is to be 8,000 feet long. It
will run at a speed of 40 miles an hour,
have rudders at both ends, be built of a
series of fluted iron tubes, and have a cov
ered iron tunnel in the centre into which
the trains will be run.

The bass is sonorous and grand ; the middle register,

The scale is even without a single flaw; the action
is smooth and marvelotutiy easy ; and ths pedal eflecta
the finest of which the Pianoforte is susceptible.
In a word. Knabe's Pianos are worthy ot the mt.

So doubt 1 may with wiety say

First, 1 went down to ths sx'pot,
Jmt to get apoD the train ;
Bow, do not mistake my meaning, ' ' -
I ne'er spree it, tliat is plain ;
Bat 1 tried to take the cars, birs,
That were standing on the track,
' When some men there rudely n touted,
"You, Sir 1 bring those csjra ritflit back I'
1 look myl t nslde of one,
After bidding iriends tarcwell.
And the train moved on slowly,
With the Huffing ot the bil ;
But tre Ion it tlew like lirhtnin?,
W hen the Oondoctor, wiUi crach.
Bushed into the car aud Bhoutt.d,

With Bolltimesn then my tlrket
I did show tiim, on my soul,
When the fellow with a puncher
In my ticket made a hole.
I did auk ot htm the meaning.
Why such liberties he took ; .
But the fellow only answered
WlUi a siLKkering, saucy look. .
Then my blood bgan to cnrdle,
And 1 said, " You dhall not rob
Me ot any of my ticket,
s'or 1 bonRbt it, Mr. from Cobb;
And at ik him, it yoa will hir.
It I did not par fuil price,
And to make holes in tny ticket
1 do not consider nice."
