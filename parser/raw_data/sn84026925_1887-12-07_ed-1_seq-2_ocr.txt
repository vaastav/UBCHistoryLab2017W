YORKTILLE, S. . :
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7,1887.
THE FIFTIETH CONGRESS.
The fiftieth Congress entered upon its
session at noon last Monday, the Senate
having been called to order by President
Pro Tempore Ingalls, when, after prayer
the clerk read the credentials of new members.
The roll of the House was called, 313
members answering to their names. The
House then proceeded to elect a speaker.
Hon. J. G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, was elected
oyer Mr. Reed, of Maine, 2 complimentary
votes having been cast for Mr.
Brumm. Carlisle received 163 and Reed
149. On taking his seat, Mr. Carlisle said:
"It must be evident to every one who has
taken even a partial survey of public affairs
that the time has come when a revision
of our revenue laws and a reduction
of taxation are absolutely necessary in
order to prevent a large and dangerous accumulation
of money in the Treasury."
After the allotting of seats to members, at
3.10 P. M., the House adjourned. The
reading of the President's message was
deferred until yesterday.

LETTER FROM COLUMBIA.
Columbia, December 5.?It is yet too
* *? 4- mill
early in me session wj uiuiojic nnai mu
be the fate of any bill on the calendar, unless
it may be bills of a local nature which
will pass as a matter of course.
In addition to those given in my last letter
relating to York county matters, Mr.
Stewart, in the Hou^p, and Mr. Black, in
the Senate, have introduced bills to authorize
the county commissioners of York
county to borrow money to pay back indebtedness
of the county, and limit the
rate of interest to be paid to 8 per cent.
The bill also empowers the county commissioners
to borrow money to pay the
ordinary county expenses and school
teachers' certificates, but limits the amount
to one half the tax levied for these purposes
and the rate of interest to 10 per
cent. Also, a bill t'? establish a special
school district to be known as the Yorkville
School District and to authorize the
levy of a special tax therein. This bill
was drafted and presented by a committee
appointed for that purpose at a meeting
held in Yorkville. A petition was presented
against the bill, signed by a number
of the people of Yorkville. The delegation
decided to introduce it, coming authoritatively,
as it did, from a meeting of
the people, but with the distinct understanding
that it would be'amended so as
to protect the property interests of the
town by making the question of taxation
subject to the will of a majority of the
property owners.
The usury-law has been defeated. So
has the joint resolution calling a Constitu
tional Convention. This joint resolution
provided for submitting to the people the
question of calling a constitutional convention
to form a new constitution ; but
it did not provide for submitting that constitution
to the people for ratification or
rejection. It simply proposed to place in
the hands of a few men the power to form
a new constitution, and the people must
take it whether it meets with their approval
or not. I have always thought
that our constitution could be changed by
submitting amendments to the people,
from time to time, when they can examine
them with more care than would be
the case if a new constitution was framed
and put before them all at once.
I omitted to mention above a local measure
that has passed the Senate and goes to
the House, increasing the pay of trial
justices and constables in Cherokee, Yorkville,
Bock Hill and Fort Mill. This was
thought necessary from the showing made
of the business done. The bill also increases
the pay of constables in the other
townships $5 per month. In Cherokee the
pay of trial justice and constable is each
increased $lo. In York the trial -justice
to $100 and constable $75. In Fort Mill the
trial justice is increased $10 and constable
$10, and in Rock Hill trial justice $100
and constable $100.
The Senate has made good progress toward
the passage of a bill to remedy the
forfeited land business and to place on the
tax books the one million acres of land
now on the forfeited land list, and which
*>" ..innnni. +o VOD illfl hofiulofi
isuutuuw pajiugauj iaAuj. .uuu
there are now past due taxes on this land
amounting to over $400,000. This was
fully discussed in my letters to you during
last year, and it is to be hoped that an efficient
remedy will be adopted?this session
to cure this great injustice to the conscientious
tax-payers of our State.
A bill to regulate the traffic in seed cotton
in the counties of Union, York, Chester
and Sumter, has passed both branches
of the General Assembly. It prohibits
the sale of seed cotton in the counties
named within the period beginning loth of
August and ending December 15th, without
a license so to do from the Clerk of
Court; the amount of such license to be
three hundred dollars, and the applicant
must be recommended by ten land owners
resident in the township in which he
lives. The bill further requires that persons
taking out such license shall keep
a book in which shall be entered the
date of every purchase, from whom,
and the quantity purchased. This bill
does not repeal or in any way affect law all
ready in force prohibiting the purchase ;
of seed cotton between sunset and sunrise.
A bill to empower the Charleston, Cincinnati
and Chicago Railroad Company to
mortgage its property and franchises and
to confirm existing mortgages, has passed
the Senate and been favorably reported
upon in the House.
A very important bill regulating the
phosphate royalty has been reported, but i
no action has been taken on it.
A bill to provide relief to destitute soldiers,
and widows of soldiers of the late j
war, has passed the Senate and gone to the j
House. The following is a synopsis of the j
bill: Section 1 provides that soldiers and
sailors who were in the service of the State I
shall be entitled to five dollars per month !
from the State treasury, on the terms and j
conditions thereinafter set forth. Section !
2.?In order to obtain the benefit of this
act. such soldier or sailor must show: 1st,
that he was a bona fide soldier or sailor in
service of the State or of the Confederate
States; 2nd, that while in such service he
lost a leg or arm, or received a wound
causing a permanent disability incapacitating
him from earning a living; 3rd, that
neither he nor his wife owns property ex- I
ceedingthe value of five hundred dollars;
4th, that he is not receiving an income
from any source exceeding the amount of
two hundred and fifty dollars per annum.
Section 3 recites the manner in which applications
shall be made. Section 4 provides
that such application shall be verified
by the county auditor as to amount of i
property owned by applicant, without fee
or charges. Section 5 requires that the applicant
must procure the affidavit of two !
reputable physicians of the county setting
forth the nature of the wound, the extent
of the disability caused, &c. Section 6 requires
that the application shall be submitted
to the Clerk of the Court who
shall certify that he knows the party
making such certificates and affidavits;
that the physicians are in good standing
and regularly authorized to practice medi- ]
cine in this State, and that in his judgment
the application should be granted; .
or if he shall find otherwise he shall so
endorse on the application, for which the
Clerk of the Court shall receive no fee.
Section 7 makes the Comptroller-General,
the Secretary of State and the AttorneyGeneral
a board to approve or disapprove
the applications. Section 8 provides that
the widow of any soldier or sailor who
lost his life while in service, while she
remains unmarried, shall receive the benefits
of this Act subject to the same conditions
as to property and income as herein
provided. Section 9 makes it the duty of
the Comptroller-General to furnish blanks,
&c. Section 10 imposes a punishment
upon any person who shall discount, shave
or in any manner speculate in the claim
of any soldier, sailor or widow under this
Act, of a fine not exceeding one hundred
dollars or imprisonment not exceeding
thirty days, or both at the discretion of
the Court. Section 12 provides a punishment
by fine not exceeding two hundred
dollars or imprisonment not more than
six months or both for any person who
shall fraudulently personate any soldier,
sailor or widow for the purpose of obtaining
the benefits of this Act.
This bill passed the Senate by a unanimous
vote of the white Senators, the two
negro Senators voting against it. I have
p-iven a Drettv full synopsis of this bill, as
there is scarcely any doubt of its passage
by the House, and it is of general interest.
It will be seen that the bill has been carefully
guarded in order to prevent fraud or
indiscriminate relief. While I think the
cost to the State will be more than is estimated
by those who have investigated the
matter, yet it does not become the State of
South Carolina to stickle on this question.
For nearly a quarter of a century these
needy, disabled and destitute veterans
have struggled along in poverty and suffering
and have never murmured, knowing
the poverty of their State. They have
in this displayed the same patience and
patriotism that moved them to respond to
the call of their State in 1861, and supported
them in lour years of war, privation
and danger. This is a small sum to each
of them, but it will help?growing old as
they are?in smoothing their pathway to
the grave, by furnishing them in their last
days some of the necessities of life.
A joint resolution proposing a constitutional
amendment abolishing the office
of county commissioner as a constitutional
office, and also striking out all that portion
which defines the duties and powersof
county commissioners, will most probably
pass the Legislature this session. If
adopted by a vote of the people, this will
place it in the power of the Legislature to
aevise a cheaper and simpler form of coun
i l.?!
iy government, auu wune ucmg tiica^ci,
will be better adapted to our conditions.
The probabilities are that the General
Assembly will not pass the bill to establish
a separate agricultural college in accordance
with Tillman's idea. The majority
seem to think that as yet agricultural
colleges are to a certain extent an experiment,
and as the Farmers' Convention of
York county well said, it could not be
done without an increase of taxation, and
this is an inopportune time, in view of the
near approach of the time for funding the
bonded debt of the State.
The Senate having cleared its calendar
took a recess until to morrow night. This
will enable many who have business at
home on sales-day to attend to it without
loss to their constituents.

' LETTER FROM CHESTER."
- f-CHESTER, December 5.?Mr. D P.
Waters, a worthy citizen of this county,
died a few days ago. He merchandized
at one time at Richburg, and farmed near
that place. ,
.jMiss Pearlie Wilks, eldest daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. J. R. Wilks, of this county,
died recently. Her death occurred at
Cooper-Limestone Institute, of which she
was a pupil.
\Mrs. R. D. Perry, of this county, has also
passed into the spirit land. She was a
daughter of the late D'r. S. B. McClurkin,
whose death a* couple of years ago created
such a void in the Halsellyille neighborhood
where lived and labored.

They cannot feel a very deep interest in
the Tillinan movement, or they would
have joined their brethren in Columbia
in the effort to push it forward.
On the evening of the 8th instant, the
parsonage of Pleasant Grove Presbyterian
Church will be the scene of a joyous entertainment.
The object in view is the raising
of funds in behalf of the new and
commodious church which has lately been
erected by the good people of the congregation.
A splendid supper will be spread
tor the pleasure of all who are present.
The time for the payment of taxes without
penalty expires on the 15th instant,
and yet only about one-half of the taxpayers
of this county have settled with the
State. The county treasurer will doubtless
do a rushing business between the
present and the 15th, as very few have
any intention of incurring the penalty of
non-payment of taxes.
_LAVarrants have been issued by Trial
Justice Leckie for the arrest of*the socalled
"Regulators" of this county, but
they have not yet been served. This will
in all probability be done this week.
A difficulty occurred on last Thursday in
this county between Thomas Jackson and
William Wilks, both colored, which resulted
in the death of the latter. A knife
did the bloody work. Jackson made his
escape and is still at large. Whisky played
a prominent part in the tragedy.
Land brought a good price at this place
to-day. A considerable amount was sold,
and the bidding was spirited. A good
deal was sold at prices exceeding 810 and
812 per acre.
The farmers have a meeting here to-day.
The members of the Legislature from
this county are hereto-day. m.

LETTER FROM FORT MILL.
Fort Mill, December 5.?The last two
days somewhat thawed our chilled population;
but there are indications of another
cold spell. A belt around the northern
horizon, accompanied by wind from the
same direction, is rather threatening as a
weather sign.
Our people are preparing for Christmas,
which will fall on Sunday ; therefore the
youth and small fry will have to begin the
celebration of that holiday on the week
previous. This we suppose will not be objectionable
to them.
Several people in the "cut off" have
killed hogs. Dr. Massey has killed a tine
lot and has more of the same sort. He
will make more than enough meat and
lard to feed his family. Mr. Jasper Kimbrell
killed two hogs last week, which, together,
weighed five hundred and forty
pounds and yielded one hundred and ten
pounds of lard. This is a good report; but
we have yet to hear from Gilston's "pegs."
When we do, perhaps Coitharp may make
a squeal also.
As a yield of cotton, Mr. B. D. Springs,
we learn, has succeeded best on eight acres
of land. Pie will probably gather fifteen
bales from that field. We hope to send a
report from him when he finishes gathering.
It was manured according to the
Furman formula.
Dr. Massey has one fourth of an acre in
Texas cotton, and expects a yield at th?
rate of three thousand pounds per acre.
About a quart of seed was used in planting
it, wherefore the stand is not first-rate.

LETTER FROM CLOVER.
Clovkk, December 5.?Mrs. J. L. Stacy
sent me, a few days ago, a lot of turnips,
four of the largest weighing 11$ pounds.
Mr. W. F. Smith, near Bethany, raised
two pumpkins this year on one vine, the
total weight of which was two hundred
pounds. The larger one weighed lit)
pounds. They were of the Mammoth variety.
Clover had its first experience with fire
on Tuesday night, November 29th. Between
nine and ten o'clock the store of Mr.
Zimri Carroll was discovered to be on fire.
In your brief notice of the fire in your issue
of last week you stated that part of
Mr. Carroll's stock was saved. That is a
mistake. The house was so far destroyed
before it was discovered that not a thing
was saved. The stock of drugs of Campbell
& Pressley was saved, but the building
was burned. The buildings burned
were owned by Mr. Carroll and Dr. A. P.
Campbell. Mr. Caroll's loss was his entire
stock of goods and a half-interest in
both buildings. I)r. Campbell's loss was a
I
half-interest in both buildings. The con-1
tents of Mr. Carroll's safe were found in-!
tact.
Campbell & Pressly also lost a day book
on which was kept their accounts. It was
either burned or lost in the confusion and
has not been found. A small vacant house
south of Mr. Carroll's store was on fire
several times. It required a desperate effort
on the part of the citizens and those
who came in from the neighborhood to
save it, and as a result, all the buildings
south of it. I never saw men work with
such energy, especially the colored men.
1 don't think any of the buildings mentioned
above could have been saved if it
had not been for their assistance. Mr.
Carroll's loss is about $2,000 with no insurance.

moved back to the old stand west of the

THE GRADED SCHOOL QUESTION.
Editor of the Enquirer: With
your permission I propose to reply to the
article of."Taxpayer," in your last issue.
"Taxpayer" sets out with the remark
that "three-fourths of the taxpayers and
all the business men of the town," share his
views in opposition to the proposed graded
school. Did he think about what he
was writing when he said that ? Would
he have said that if he had not been in
such hot haste to rush into print? Is it
true? Let us see.
Careful investigation shows that of the
"business men," about fifteen favor the
school and twenty are opposed. Of the
members of the bar, four favor it and two
probably are adverse. Of the professional
men about thirteen favor and one or two
oppose it; and while no careful canvass of
the taxpayers has been been made, it is
pretty well ascertained that a majority
favor a graded or free public school. Now
these statements are facts; they are not
the heated rhetoric of an excited brain.
Now if "Taxpayer" starts out and in
his very first sentence has such a statement
as this?that "all the business men" of
Yorkville are opposed to a graded school,
then we will have to look with suspicion
on every statement he may make throughout
the rest of his article.
And a little further on we hear him talking
after this manner: "Is it not time
to call a halt" and "have a grand review
;" "this terrible increase we are rushing
headlong into ;" "the point of desperation
in this matter;" "was there not a
time when our people arose in their
might," Ac., Ac. Surely something awful
must be going to happen. The Indians
and the tories must he at our doors to
scalp our women and children and lay our
homes in ashes. Surely some awful calamity
is hanging over the town of York
ville. What is this aire ana unneara 01
evil any way? A two mill tax to educate
our children! This horny-headed, cloven-footed
monster that is soon to ravage
Yorkville, "paralyze its energies," and
make the grass grow in our streets?according
to "Tax-payer."
After "Tax-payer" has marshalled all he
can find to say against the graded school
as proposed by the committee, he proceeds
to give a plan of his own, and he starts
out with this very innocent looking statement,
that "the school building" (the female
college building, I suppose) be made
the property of the town."
The property of the town indeed! How
is the town going to get the building? It
has no money to buy it, and no authority
to levy a tax to buy it. Does "Taxpayer"
mean to go around with a subscription
list to buy it ? I wonder how many years
of begging and humiliation does he think
it would take before he got $3,000? Or
maybe he hopes thestockholders will make
a present to the town of property which
cost $12,000.
I don't hazard anything in saying that
"Taxpayer" will never be able "to secure
the building on his plan, and that kills
his scheme at the outset.
But suppose anybody was generous
enough to* give the town the building (and
I don't think you can find such a person
with a dozen search warrants) then we
would not be anj; better off than we are at
present. The school in the college building
would not be any better than it has
been for a dozen years past, and in saying
this I am not reflecting on those who have
been teaching there. It has not been
their fault. The fault lies elsewhere. The
failure in the past lies at the doors of the
people of Yorkville, and at the doors of
our present public school system, which
is a failure and a farce, because it runs the
schools just long enough to break down
our private schools, and not long enough
to be of any effective service to the pupils.
No, I repeat it, and I repeat it with emphasis,
"Taxpayer's" plan for a school
will not better matters one whit. We
would still have just what we have
had in the past?a handful at the college
building, and half a score of other little
handfuls?a school at nearly every man's
door in the town.
The trouble in Yorkville over the school
' question is that we are too shattered and j
disintegrated ; every "tub is trying to sit i
on its own bottom" in school matters.
Wo will noupp hnvo nn pffir'ipnf ?phnnl I
system in Yorkville so long as the present
isolating custom prevails, and "Taxpayer's"
plan will do nothing toward correcting
the present unhappy system.
I see no way out of the present school
muddle, and the present premium on illiteracy
(for half the children are not at
school) than by adopting the plan of the j
committee.
But, it may be asked, Why are you so J
in earnest in urging a graded school ?
Here is the answer and it is a simple and
sufficient one: Because the graded, or
free public school is the best, the most effective,
and the most economical system i
that the wisdom and experience of man
has ever been able to devise. This statement,
Mr. Editor, is not mere assertion
and buncombe. It is the simple fact?ascertained
to be a fact after years of
trial. The concensus of the educational
world has long ago settled that point.
Now if we are going to have a system of
education, why not get the best that is to
be had? Is not that the dictate of sound
common sense?if "Taxpayer" pleases?
"business" sense?
Mow it is evident that the ghost which is
scaring "Taxpayer" is the expense of this
1 graded free school system. I tell "Taxl
payer" and challenge him to disprove it,
that a graded free school on the plan submitted
by the committee will not cost the
town any more than we are paying under
our present plan. Now may be "Tax-payer"
is not ready to admit that. The proof
is at hand. Look at the figures. With
the 30G children of the town in the schools
we will receive from the present school
fund $900. Then if we inaugurate a free
public school we will probably get $300
from the Peabody fund. The free graded
schools in our neighboring towns get this
amount and there is no reason why we
cannot. This gives us$l,200 to begin with.
On our present plan we are only getting
$500 of public money. Here we are losing
$700 a year by sticking to our present
system.
Now the estimate made by the committee
for the cost of the school is $2,450 per
annum. Deduct the $1,200 received from
the public school fund and the Peabody
fund, and there is only $1,250 left to
be raised. Now we are actually paying
out every year, to the half a score of private
schools in town, more than $1,250, and
not over half the children of the town are
in school. They are growing up in ignorance.
Yet it is costing us as much to
educate one half of our children by our
present plan, as it would cost to educate
every child in town by the efficient plan
of a graded school,
Now what is the business sense of sticking
to a plan that every one admits to be a
failure?a plan that is letting half our children
grow up in ignorance, when we can
have another plan by which we can educate
every child in town, rich or poor,
young and old, for the same cost of money,
and, every one admits, more thoroughly?
Now this is an aifiument that appeals to
every man's Common" sense. If I can
adopt a plan by which I can educate my
own children and1 then help my poorer
neighbor to educate his, and without any
more cost, would it not be foolish, would
it not be criminal in me to be so selfish as
to refuse to do it?
Now this plan of a free graded school
ten months in the year is no doubtful or
risky enterprise. I think almost every
town in the state or any size, ana certainly
every one with any public spirit, has
the graded free system. The test of the
utility of a thing is the actual trial, and I
never heard of a town going back on this
system when once fairly tried.
The largest tax-payers in our sister towns
are favoring and supporting this graded
school system, and on exactly the same
basis as that proposed by bur committee.
I will name a few of them : such as Col.
J. H. Rion and G. H. McMaster, of Winnsboro.
In Chester, such men as Captain
Agurs, Joseph Wylie and James Hemphill
; and you know, Mr. Editor, what our
er'erprising and public-spirited neighbor,
Rock Hill is doing in this line.
Now "Taxpayer" says (and he seems to
smack his lips over it) that "the business
meu" of Yorkville are opposed to this free
school sytem. I want to ask him if the
business men of Winnsboro, Chester and
Rock Hill are not as shrewd and far-seeing
and as capable of judging what would be
a good thing for a town as "the business
men" of Yorkville ? The verdict of enlightened
Christendom is, that the free
public school is the best system ever devised
; and "Taxpayer" says "the business
men" of Yorkville are against it.
Now is not that pretty rough on the "business
men'- of Yorkville??the business
men on "Taxpayer's" side.
In all seriousness, Mr. Editor, when will
some of our people get a little more public
spirit in their breasts, and a little larger
view of matters pertaining to our welfare
as a town ?
I read once of an old man who had some
company staying with him, and he
thought they were staying a little too long
and costing a little too much. So one day
he prayed at the table in this wise: "0,
Lord, bless me and my wife, my son John
and his wife; us four and no more." I
hope that in this matter of schools we are
not going to act in such a way as to make
DeoDle think we have been Drayine: this
prayer. Education.

IMPRISONMENT FOR DEBT.
Judge Kershaw has just rendered a decisioi
of local interest to our own readers, and fron
the nature of the case?involving the right of i
creditor to imprison a debtor?of interest to tin
general public.
On the 5th of last month a civil action was
instituted in the Court of Common Pleas foi
York county by the firm of W. L. Roddey J
Co., of Rock Hill, plaintiff, against William L
Envin, defendant, based upon a store aceoun
and three separate notes, the whole aggregat
ing the sum of ?1,106.44.
On the same day a warrant of attachmen
against the property of the defendant, and ar
order of arrest against his person, was sued oul
before tho Clerk of tho Court of Commoi:
Pleas for York county, at the instance of J,
F. Reid, a member of tho firm of W. L. Roddey
<fc Co., who, in the firm's behalf, by afiidavit
deposed upon information and belief
(and setting forth tho sources of his information)
that the defendant was disposing of his
property with intent to defraud his creditors
and principally tho firm of W. L. Roddey A
Co., whereupon the Clerk of the Court issued
a warrant of attachment against tho property
of tho defendant and an order of arrest against
his person, commanding the Sheriff to forthwith
ilrrest tho defendant if he could bo found
in York county, and to hold him to bail in the
sum of ?1,;)00, and to return the order to Wilson
A Wilson, attorneys for tho plaintiff, at theii
office in Yorkville, on November ">th, 1887.
On tho 10th of November tho defendant was
arrested in Columbia, and tho Sheriff of York
county made his return on tho warrant that by
his deputy ho arrested the defendant in Columbia,
brought him to Yorkville and in defaull
of bail committed him to jail.
On tho 24th of November, Messrs. Hart A
Hart and W. R. McCaw, Esq., attorneys for
tho defendant, gavo written notice to the attor
j neys for the plaintiff that they would move his
| Honor Judge Kershaw, at Camden, on the 29th
I of November, to vacate the order of arrest upon
1 ! the following grounds:
1. Because the affidavit upon which the order
of arrest was issued was irregular, in that it
i failed to state fully the sources of the depo
' nent's information, and further failed in not
' stating why tho affidavits of the original alleg\
! ed informers were not taken,
i j 2. Because the arrest of the defendant at
| Columbia was unauthorized by the order of
1 J arrest and was illegal and void.
After hearing arguments of W. B. McCaw,
| Esq., and Maj. Jas. F. Hart for the motion to
j vacate tho order of arrest, and W. B. Wilson,
> | Jr., Esq., in opposition thereto, Judge Kershaw
tiled his decision vacating tho order of
arrest and ordered the defendant to bo discharged
from custody, on the ground that the
s affidavit was insufficient and furnished no legal
evidence of fraud.

THE FARMERS' CONVENTION'.
The second Annual Convention of the
Farmers' Association of South Carolina
was opened in Agricultural Hall, Columbia,
on Thursday last, shortly after noon,
being the third meeting of the Association
since its organization.
Mr. D. lv. Norris, of Anderson, the
President, called the Convention to order,'
and after addressing the delegates, the
secretary, Mr. J. T. Duncan, of Newberry,
called the roll, ninety-seven delegates responding
to their names.
York county was represented by a full
delegation as follows: L. Lowry Smith,
W. J. Waters, T. G. Culp, Iredell Jones,
Frank H. Brown.
Under the provisions of a resolution
adopted at the last meeting, a business
committee, consisting of one from each
county, was appointed. Captain Iredell
Jones was appointed as tne memoer or
this committee from York.
The following resolutions were offered
by G. W. Shell, of Laurens, and adopted
by the Convention:
Resolved, That this Farmers' Convention re3
spectfully invite the Board of Trustees of the
South Carolina College to send such one or
3 more of their number or of the faculty of the
r South Carolina College to meet this Convention
. to-night at 7..'10 o'clock to explain and discuss
" the question of agricultural education and the
best means of promoting the same in South
t Carolina, and that a committee of three be ap
pointed at once to extend this invitation.
Resolved, That the discussion to be had on
l the subject is for the purpose of arriving at just
conclusions, and any gentleman, whether a
1 member of this Convention or of the General
t Assembly, who feels that he can add any light,
i shall have the privilege of being heard.
Messrs. Shell, Ancrum and Fishburne
were appointed on the committee.
A resolution was adopted that a com mi t,
tee of three be appointed to convey the
. invitation above indicated, and Messrs.
i G. W. Shell, of Laurens, Ancrum, of Ker,
shaw, and Fishburne, of Colleton, were appointed
such committee.
| Captain Iredell Jones, of York, .offered
a series of resolutions. The first caused
. something of a sensation as it was to the
' ... . .1 - i il c i.U? iinn k/->
6I16CC Ullll Uie SUllhtJ ui iwc uumciiuuu ut
expressed in favor of the postponement of
; any move to secure a separate Agricultural
! College at this time, inasmuch as the mat1
ter had been the subject of experiment in
other States and the results were not sufficiently
advanced to determine the success
1 of the plan. The following ones were of a
mild and general character. All were referred
to the Committee on Resolutions.
Mr. Watson, of Anderson, wanted to of;
fer a resolution in regard to the funding of
the State debt, but a delegate suggesting
; that the Legislature would probably move
in the matter, he did not insist. He, however
offered another resolution, which he
said had been adopted at the County Con!
vention of farmers in Anderson. It was
to the effect that the Convention endorse
the plan of a separate Agricultural College
and the reorganization of the Agricultural
; Bureau. It was referred to the Committee
on Resolutions.
, At 2:20, on motion of Captain Tillman,
the Convention took a recess until 7 o'clock
P. M.
At the evening session, by reason of
hoarseness, President Norris was unable
to preside, and Vice-President G. W. Shell,
of Laurens, was invited to take the chair.
It was moved" that the Convention proceed
at once to the election of officers,
j On motion of Mr. Crossland, it was voted
{ that the Secretary be instructed to cast one
ballot tor Mr. D. K. Norris, of Anderson,
I as the choice of the Convention for Presi
dent.
Mr. Norris expressed his acknowledgments
for the honor conferred, but thought
it but just that the office should devolve on
some one else, and therefore wished to decline
with thanks.
The Convention, however, insisted on
his serving.
A committee, consisting of Messrs. Watson,
FishburneandCrossland, wasappointed
by the President pro tem. to conduct the
President-elect to the chair.
The election for Vice-Presidents, one
from each Congressional District, resulted
as below, one ballot being cast for all by
the Secretary on motion:
First District?J. E. Wannamaker.
Second?A. J. Linder.
Third?John E. Bradley, of Abbeville.
Fourth?T. P. Mitchell.
Fifth?Captain Iredell Jones, of York.
Sixth?E. T. Stackhouse, of Marion.
Seventh?H. R. Thomas.
Mr. John T. Duncan, of Newberry, was
re-elected Secretary, and Dr. W. P. Addison,
of Abbeville, Treasurer.
At this point Judge Haskell appeared
before the Convention, and after a few
words of introduction by Mr. Shell, delivered
a short address on behalf of the board
of trustees of the South Carolina College.
Judge Haskell's address and a copy of
the report of the trustees of the College,
which he presented, were received as information,
after which Capt. Tillman made
the report of the Committee on Resolutions,
prefacing the same by some remarks
to the effect that of the sundry resolutions
referred to them, they had rejected one
and changed or embodied the others in
those which they had to report. The report
was as follows:
The Committee on Resolutions bee leave
to submit the following report:
Resolved, That this Convention does earnestly
urge the Legislature to establish a separate
Agricultural College, and to reorganize the
Bureau.
Resolved, That it is not the purpose of the
farmers of the State to make their organization
a political body, hostile to other classes, nor is
it their intention to attack the integrity of our
State officers, nor their policy to arraign or
dictate to the Legislature.
Reolved, That we believe in the thorough
organization of the farmers of the State, with
the object and firm purpose of developing the
agricultural resources.
Resolved, That we regret the action of some
of the counties which have declined to send
delegates to this Convention, and respectfully
invite them hereafter to unite with the Farmers'
movement.
Resolved, That we believe in the necessity and
propriety of reorganizing the Agricultural Department,
to make it more efficient and useful,
and respectfully ask the Legislature to giye
careful consideration to the several bills already
introduced in their body looking to that end.
A motion that the report be adopted
was carried by a chorus of "ayes," no one
voting in the negative.
Captain Tillman then offered tjie resolution
given below, which is exactly the
same as the fifth article of the platform
adopted at last year's Convention. It was
adopted over again last night and reads as
follows:
We urge the Legislature not to squander the
State's property by allowing the wholesale exportation
of phosphates at merely nominal
prices, and that with a view of lessening the
burdens of taxation they take into consideration
the advisability of increasing the phosphate
royalty.
A motion was then made to adjourn
sine die, which was put and carried amid
the noise of the feet of rising dpleontes.
and at 8.30 after being in session onlythree
and one-half hours, both afternoon
and evening, the second annual Convention
of the Farmers' Association was declared
adjourned without day.
J ust before the motion to adjourn was put
Capt. Iredell Jones arose and wished to
offer a resolution, but was ruled out of order,
as a motion to adjourn was before the
house.
