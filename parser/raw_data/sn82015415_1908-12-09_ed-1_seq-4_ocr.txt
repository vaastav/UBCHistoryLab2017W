NO MORE GREAT FORTUNES.
President Roosevelt's message, as expected, is milder in tone than
some former ones. There is no reference to "malefactors of great
wealth." but the President stands bv his euns. His position with regard
to railroads, telegraph and telephone companies and other agencies of
inter-state commerce is clear and decisive. In so many words lie uc
clares for Government supervision of the railroads and the telephone
and telegraph companies. This is a step in the direction of government
ownership and in the direction of socialism. I he president turtner
takes the position that the law should not attempt to prohibit all com
binations of the kind prohibited by the Sherman anti-trust law. This
seems to mean that he would let the corporations combine, and have
the federal government supervise the combination, which, m turn
means that the profits of the combined corporations would be limited.
If a railroad, for example, began to pay dividends of over ten per cent,
the government might step in and otder it to reduce fares and freight
rates. Extend this plan to all the big agencies of inter-state commerce,
and there would no longer be the opportunity for creation of great
private fortunes, in any of the ordinary commercial fields. Whether
the result would be a loss of initiative and enterprise, is a question that
forms the line "between the socialist and the individualist. In the build'
ing of the first transcontinental railroad, for example, tremendous risks
were taken. Success crime through the genius, enterprise, and courage
of the men who floated the scheme, Huntington, Stanford, Hopkins
and others, and all of them made millions. Under a system limiting
their possible profits to something like ordinary interest on money in
vested, would they have gone into the enterprise at all? Would not
the government itself have had to build the first continental railroad?
Not satisfied with the federal supervision plan, to bar the way to
building up of great private fortunes, the President urges a measure
designed to break up those already existing. He wants a "progressive
inheritance tax on large fortunes.
THE '"MACHINE" CRY ONCE MORE.
The old question of political loaves and fishes is bobbing up locally
again. A lot of appointments are to be made, and the Republican
county committee, which seeks from its elected officeholders who make
the appointments, a recognition of its right to be heard, is promptly
called ,a machine and accused by muendo, of improper political activ
ity. The fact is that the party committee has a proper place in the dis
cussion of appointments and is naturally of great assistance to those
who have the duty of selecting appointees. As we understand the mat
ter, it docs not assume to dictate, if it does it should be resisted,-
but it docs claim that consideration should be given to its endorsements
when an appointment is about to be made. It endorses impartially as
many Republican candidates as there are for any one office, the en
dorsement merely being an authoritative statement that such aspirants
are Republicans. The appointing power is thus furnished with a list
of applicants vouched for as members of his own party, which he nat
urally wishes to. support, and he may make what he thinks is the, best
selection from the list. If at any time a county committee should en
dorse but one applicant and that an unfit one. thus trying to dictate
and force an undesirable into office, the committee so doing may be
simply "turned down." There is nothing in this system to justify the
cry ot machine.
THE COFFEE CHAMPION.
Mr. Louisson is making a. single-handed fight for protection of
coffee which is worthy of success and, whether successful or not, should
earn for him the admiring gratitude of Hawaii. This latest effort
comes demonstrated from Washington in the form of a sixteen page
pamphlet entitled, "Plea for Growth and Protection of the American
Coffee Industry Porto Rico, Hawaii and the Philippines by Abra
ham Lincoln Louisson." The title page is illustrated with a cluster
of coffee berries and bears the catching footline "Coffee: The In
fallible Americanizer of Hawaii." Following the title repeated on the
first page of reading matter comes this pithy introduction:
This industry, above all others, can settle Hawaii with a
large, white population, can create a commonwealth of home
builders upon the soil, so that the United States, in making
of Hawaii the Malta of the Pacific, may secure a yeomanry to
man her fortifications and guard her outposts and defenses in
perilous times.
In presenting my plea for protection to coffee grown under
the American flag, it will be my endeavor to array in as con
cise and brief a manner such facts and statements relating to
this product, so as to unfold before you the possibilities that
await us in our insular territories, when protection becomes
a reality.
Its present .dimensions in Porto Rico, Hawaii and the Philippines
are presented to show what "a weak and struggling infant" is the Am
erican coffee industry: The production in these territories is about as
follows: Porto Rico, 40,000,000 pounds; Hawaii, about 3,000,0000
pounds; Philippines (none for export), 030,000 pounds; total. 4imo,-
000 pounds. It is shown how the Porto Rican industry declined after
annexation, from having the protected markets of Spam and Cuba
.closed to it. The total value of coffee exported in the fiscal year 1907
was $4,693,004 as compared with $12,220,000 in 1897.
Mr. Louisson points out what protection, first under reciprocity
and next under annexation, has done for the sugar industry of Ha
waii, adding "Hawaii offers as great opportunities in coffee as have
been offered in sugar, but it is absolutely necessary, vital and urgent
that tin's product receive the same exact treatment that has been be
stowed upon sugar, as well as practically all of your mainland produc
tions." Willi an area nearly double that of Porto Rico, it is argued
that Hawaii should produce double as much coffee as that island, or
from 200,000,000 to 350,000,000 pounds. Jared G. Smith is quoted in
n rqport, when director of the Federal Experiment Station here, as say
ing there are 300,000 acre of land in Hawaii nvnilable for the pro
miction of coffee, alio as reiiinrkim; that a duty of five cents n pound
would load to the Investment of $icw,qoq,qoo of outside capital in Hit-
Waii during the next five years. It is the author s opinion "that it is
highly probable we may have 500,000 acres suited to "its culture, since
and also divert lands growing other crops to coffee, if its cultivation
... . ... 1 . . .... . ... ,
assures ueucr nnanciai returns.
President Roosevelt, the pamphleteer says, has always expressed
himself most emphatically on the desirability of 'Americanizing Hawaii.
On this point, and regarding Hawaii as the buffer territory that should
act as the defense of our western slope, he makes this argument:'
By affixing to the soil a permanent Anglo-Saxon, Teutonic
and Latin population, the makeup of future American citizens,
we strengthen at once the political status bf our country. When
the cultivator of a comparatively small area of iand can live
and thrive out of the results of a paying crop, he becomes a
r1n11r fi'irii' in tits nntr1tirln1f 1 rtttrl nnf inn
C11MCIU". UOOV, KKJ HIV, ,UIIIHIUIllVVUiUl (tllVA ilUklUU
The present population of Hawaii is small, figuring about
165,000, whilst Porto Rico, with about' half the area, con
tains 1,000,000 "
As heretofore stated coffee is the industry of the small man,
and coupled with the fact that its agricultural features make
it the most attractive industry in tropical zones, its power as ..
an, agent to populate and Americanize Hawaii cannot be con- .
trovertcd.
Furthermore,' as the United States has appropriated mil
lions of dollars for fortifying Pearl Harbor, to make Hawaii
the Malta of the Pacific, tiie manning of these fortifications
in time of trouble must come from a yeomanry that has grown
up 011 Hawaiian soil, who have homes thereon and arc deeply
attached to it.
Henceforth in protection to coffee lies the consummation of
this problem. This phase of the coffee issue in itself should
warrant serious and favorable consideration at the hands of
Congress.
Mr. Louisson gives some pages to the., question as related to the
Philippines, from which he proceeds to show that "coffee is coffee,"
that it doss not compete with any mainland product.
"Practically all European countries impose an import duty on cof
fee," Mr. Louisson says with the following exhibit: "Sweden im
poses a duty of 1 1-2 cents per lb.; Great Britain, 3 cent's; Germany,
41-2 cents; Norway. 61-16 cents; Greece, 61-4 cents; Austria-Hungary,
6 3-4 cents ; Portugal, 6 3-4 cents ; Spain, 12 1-4 cents ; Italy,
13 1-8 cents; France, 135-8 cents." From, which he concludes that
the American coffee industry should receive a protection of not less
than five cents a pound. Comparing this with the protection to some
other staples he says if the coffee producers asked for only equality
of treatment he should then petition for something like 20 to 40 cents
a pound.
It is contended that the removal of the duty in 1872 was a mis
take, causing South and Central American countries to impose export
duties on coffee. In consequence coffee became dearer instead of cheap
er to the American consumer. He argues that the restoration of dutv
will not be felt, saying that the consumer never practically realized the
benefit of a depressed coffee market. "The retail grocer relies upon
coffee and tea to average up profit on sales, since he is compelled to
sell very many staples at cost, or a trifle above cost. His profits on
roasted coffee arc excessive, and he has never found it wise or expe
dient to cut prices when surplus production affected the market quota
tion of the raw bean. He was not compelled to do so."
Discussing our trade relations with Brazil the author submits that
a duty on coffee will force trading concessions from Brazil and other
countries now dealing with us on a one-sided basis. Cuba, it is shown,
is stimulating its coffee industry with a protection of 81-2 cents a
pound. It has thus become a profitable crop there.
"A Word on Protection," occupying the last-page,. is a sort of per
oration. He argues that the consumer is everybody and should not
object to giving his fellow-consumers who raise coffee and other trop
ical products under the American flag a share of that protection that
has made the whole country prosperous. If the consumer "cannot see
the justice of this claim and argument, then why 'ndt suggest to him,
whoever he may be, or whatever he may be, the following:
"Let us have free trade in all things in yours and mine !
"li protection, then protection in all things in yours and mine!
"If I understand the spirit and meaning of the Constitution we
live under," Mr. Louisson concludes, "which vouchsafes inherently
to every industry and every individual an equal chance for happiness,
life and existence, then L as nn Amenr. nt'mn rinri f

Before enacting a primary law for Hawaii our Solons might do
well to procure ample data on the subject from states that have the
institution m operation. There are various primary laws and some of
them are worse than none at all. There is a movement on foot in
Kansas to repeal the law on account of its expensiveness. It is sau
that the cost there will be about $140,000. Even a proportionate cost
according to population for little Hawaii, with its scanty revenue,
would be unthinkable. Thero were rnnnrtc rt JirilrL..!.' ...
