Between Assignees.
Judge Dole has filed a decision in
chambers in tho matter of tho bank
ruptcy of Tai Lung. Leo Chun and
Winam, assignees of tho bankrupt
ostato of Wong Kwork Hing, allege
tho proof of claims against tho
ostato of Tai Lung, and move for an
ordor requiring tho assignee of Tai
Lung's estate, J. Iiubonstoin, to file
his account and distribute tho funds.
Tho motion is opposed by tho assig
nee of Tai Lung, on tho ground that
ho had givon thoso claimants notico
that ho disputed thoir claims. Tho
claimants denied that thoy had re
ceived such notico, but tho Court on
ovidonco taken decided U103' had.
Such a notico gives tho claimant a
right of action against tho assignee;
it does not make him a creditor, but
finds that he was and is one. In this
case, therefore, tho burden of prov
iug their claims against tho denial
of tho assignee is placed upon tho
claimants, and this must bo dono at
or before tho final sottlomont of tho
assignee's accounts. Tho decision
upon tho motion before tho Court
will bo suspended until it is ascer
tained whether or not tho claimants
aro creditors. A. S. Hartwoll for tho
motion; O. L. Cartor, against.

SPJIEOKELS VS. BISHOP.
An Episode in the Waikapu Com
mons Controversy.
Tho San Francisco Chronicle of
Doc. lith has tho following item:
"Clans Sprockols sued Charles R.

$100,000, together with 1250 shares
of tho stock of tho Waikapu Planta
tion Company, pledged as security.
Tho total number of shares issued
by tho corporation is 25(H)."
It was tho getting wind of a move
on tho part of Col. Sprockols to got
hold of Waikapu stock which sent
Col. Macfarlano off to San Francisco
by tho steamer Australia. Of course
if Col. Sprockols got control of the
stocky there would bo an end to tho
"million dollar suit."

make it clear that tho Democratic
party should carry out the Demo
cratic policy and not ask tho Repub
licans to do it.
In its discussion of foreign rela
tions tho mossago will contain some
things that aro new and much that
is of importance. Tho President will
probably have something to say
about tho enforcement of a vigorous
AMERICAN POLICY IN' THE PACIFIC,
with special reforenco to Hawaii and

States to lako control of tho Nicara

It For? uo worse than the big
ger, older, balder-headed
boys. Life is an interrogation
point. "What is it for?" we con
tinually cry from the cradle to tho
grave. So with this little introduc
tory sermon we turn and ask: "What
is August Flower for ?" As easily
answered as asked : It is for Dys
pepsia. It is a special remedy for
the Stomach and Liver. Nothing
more than this ; but this brimful.
We believe August Flower cures
Dyspepsia. We know it will. We
have reasons for knowing it. Twenty
years ago it started in a small country
town. To-day it has an honored
place i$ every city and country store,
possesses one of the largest manu
facturing plants in the country and
sells every where. Why is this? The
reason is as simple as a child's
thought. It is honest, does one
thing, and does it right along it
