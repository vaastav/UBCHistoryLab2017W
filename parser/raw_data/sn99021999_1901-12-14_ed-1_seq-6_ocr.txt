MOItK AUH A XT Ur.MAUOUY.
Omiha must undergo tho process of edu
cation. Tho school of experience, while It
Is a cry dear one, Is at tho same tlmo a
very practical and effective school. At thli
moment, when tho people of Omaha arc
parsing under the corporation rod, and aro
beginning to realize how enormous oro tho
burdens which tho corporations seek to
place upon them, tho World-Herald desires
to remind them of the fact that they missed
a very Important opportunity at tho last
city election when they permitted tho pres
ent mayor to be cuonen over a good cmzon
like William S. Popplcton. woriu-ueraiu.
This is another striking example oi
tho arrant demagogy that has charac
terized the attitude of the World-Herald
In dealing with uvery question that af
fects the public welfare. Its outer
against the enormous bunions which the
corporations seek to place upon umnna
taxpayers Is as Insincere nnd hypocrit
ical as has been Its warfare upon state
treasury embezzlers and speculators In
public school funds.
When tho county bonrd of equaliza
tion hist summer raised tho corporation
assessments ?2,000.000 nnd then dropped
them back to the assessors' figures,
which were ridiculously low, the Worhb
Herald did not have a word to say.
Why? Simply bccnusn tlie board is
democratic, and tho responsibility for
this flagrant abuse of the taxing power
rested principally iiKu the party In con
trol of the machinery of the county gov
ernment.
Two out of tho three members of the
city Hoard of lteview happen to be re
publicans, while the chairman claims to
be a popocrat. Hoes anybody familiar
wltli World-Herald methods nnd policies
believe that It would have Indulged In
any very serious criticism of the board
If the majority had been democratic?
Suppose, for example, that Kd Howell
had been elected mayor of Omaha four
years ago Instead of Frank E. Moores.
Would the World-Hernlil have even
lisped a word of condemnation If tlie
Howell board of review had overruled a
republican tax commissioner In tho as
sessment of the street rallwuy and gas
companies?
True, Omaha must undergo a process
of education and It must loam to know
the dlffiirence between honest news
papers and unprincipled party organs.
Whatever education the people of
Omaha have had on the question of
equitable taxation they have received
through The Hee, which ls the only
paper that has turned the searchlight of
publicity upon the enormities of cor
porate tax evasion whether tho city
councils, county boards or boards of
equalization were republican or demo
cratic. If anything, Tho Hee has been
much more severe lu its condemnation
of republican boards of equalization
than It has of the democrats and popu
lists.
The Hee has always had the courage
to denounce abuses within Its own party
wherever they might be foundj while the
Woiid-IIerald lias not only invariably
sought to cover up the misdeeds and
misdemeanors of the members of Its
own party, but It has also, tlmo and
again, been tho sponsor and champion
of republican embezzlers and Jobbers,
to whom It has always been ready to
extend aid and comfort.
In the light of Its tortuous course In.
ceiinectlon with public plunderers and
boodlers Its Jeremiad about tho retribu
tion that has overtaken the city by the
election of tho present mayor In place
of W. S. Poppleton does not deceive any
body. It Is the same old song which It
has ding-donged luto the ears of our
citizens' for years as an argument for
turning thu city over to the hungry and
thirsty democratic Tammany which has
been yearning to feast at tho lleshpots
In the city hall.
It must be highly gratifying to .ludge
HeiiJaniln S. linker that Congressman
Mercer Is making thu most strenuous
exertions to secure for him an appoint
ment to a Now Mexican Judgeship. For
the past two years almost anybody by
the nnine of linker was an offensive
partisan In the eyes of tho non-resident
representative of the First district, and
tlio mere suspicion that Judge linker
entertained an ambition to wear the
globe-trotter's worn out brognns gave a
conniption lit to Tom Hluckburn, Ills
faithful errand boy.
President Hoosevelt Is taking to tho
practice of pushing buttons to open ex
positions and conventions Just as if lie
were born to thu art. The desire to
have tlie president Inaugurate or set in
motion every great public enterprise has
becomo contagious. It la n pretty cus
tom, but might grow to such proportions
as to become onerous to tlie chief execu
tlve. it Is snfe to say, however, that so
long as President Hoosevelt occupies the
White House he will llnd time to push
all tho buttons that may bo necessary.
It Is Intimated now that Governor
Savage will not come to Omaha to give
public audience on thu question of the
now lire and pollco commission, but will
wait at Lincoln for tho appearance of
those who want to volunteer advice,
Should this prove to bo correct tho local
railroads may look out for a run on
their free pass department by self-sac
rlllclng patriots eager to connect with
tho city pay roll by way of a guberna
torlal appointment.

Honttli Itldrr Itrcliiipnt.
In tho current number of the Century a
writer who knows him well, discusses
"Tho Personality of President Iloosovclt"
and relates this Illuminating Incident:
"He Is a kind-hearted man, yet a rigid
dleclplluarlan, and will demand a falthfut
and efficient dlschargo of public duties by
public officials. I havpened to bo present
whon graduates of Harvard and other uni
versities, and western mining engineers, to
tho number of thirty or forty, collected In
tho offlco of tho assistant secretary of tho
navy to bo enlisted in tho 'Hough Hlder'
regiment. Mr. Koosovclt ntood in front of
his desk, while theso earnest, manly young
fellows stood ranged around throe sides of
his ofllcc. Addressing them In his pecu
liarly quick, earnest manner, to tho effect
that they must noi underestimate tho dan
gers or dlfllcultlcs they would encounter,
ho told them that It would probably bo
tha roughest experjence .that they ever had,
and ho wished tUem to understand that
after onco being kworn In they must take
whatever camo without grumbling. 'Posi
tively, gentlemcn.'-sstd he, 'I will have no
squealing;' ond ho urged them, If any of
them . thought they could not endure tho
greatest hardships, to withdraw beforo It
was too late.
"Then, turning to a pile of volumes of
mounted Infantry tactics, he said: 'I will
remain behind a few days and hurry for
ward tho equipments. You, gentlemen,
hurry to San Antonio, and If you do your
part toward getting tho men In order and
licking them Into shape, I promises to get
you' into tho fight. There aro not enough
tactics to go around, but I will distribute
these, and you must read and study them
on the cars.' Calling out their names, he
hurled the books at tho men so fast that
several would be In the air at once, the
men catching them on the fly. I could
seo In their faces that every ono of them
was ready to follow him to tho death.
'Out of tho clouds of misconception and
tho falso Impressions thrown about this
picturesque flguro by tho cartoonists and
tho paragraphcrs, moro Interested In sen
sationalism than In reality, thero suddenly
emerges this Intensely earnest, forceful,
brave, patriotic, humanlty-lovlng, broad

ENGLAND'S "COtlllT OP CLAIMS."
It II nil for Front Sen In nt tin Coronn
Hon Oreninii-.
Philadelphia Record.
Tho superior persons In England who
havo expressed their contempt for Amer
leans becauso of tho quadrennial assault
on tho White Houso by place hunters may
bo expected to oxperlonco pangs at the
spectnclo afforded by tho peculiar British
"court of claims." This Institution was
established to relievo the king from tho
pressuro for office In connection with tho
coronation day ceremonies. All the In-
fluonco which titles and money can exert
has been used In behalf of persons who
want to be conspicuous or, at least, to
tower abovo tho mere spectators on that
occasion. Tho badgerod presidents of the
United States might profit by tho king's
examplo and establish n "court of claims"
to determine, appointments to office. The
king will now have leisure to give his
mind to tlio question of his own dress
and will escape the censuro of tho ofllcb
scokers who must bo denied.
Tho demand for coronation day emlnenco
comes from bishops, carls and even young
women. An American can hardly under
stand the strugglo of bishops for tho right
to stand with a hand on tho king's chair,
the contest of earls for tho right to walk
in tho procession carrying a silver baton
etc. Sir Harry Ilurrard has appealed for
tho privilege fcof carrying tho king's bow
and arrows, In splto of tho fact that a
Mauser rifle would be moro cffcctlvo If his
majesty should be attacked. Miss Deatrlce
Follows will havo a grievance If she shall
bo refused tho right to strew herbs In the
king's path.
Grotcsquo as tho whole business may
seem to Americans, wo aro not without
tho samo spirit of self-advertising. At
tho time of Oram's funeral General Shor
man said that ho had received thousands
of applications from persons who wanted
to servo as his aides. Tho prospect of
appearing In uniform and riding n horso
beforo a line of spectators was alluring
to men who had no military expcrlonco
and who could ride a horeo only when tied
on. Still, thero Is a great deal in tho
coronation clay proceedings which would bo
moro appropriate to a circus procession
than to the crowning of a very llmlte
monarch In the twentieth century. While
the Kngllsh are willing to pay for tho
spectacular features which belong to an
earlier period, they aro not willing to relax
any of their vigilance In maintaining tho
popular rights which havo been wrestoi
from too throne.
OTHIMl I.AM1S THAN (It ItS.
H ls estimated that at least 10,000 per
sons wcro present at tho different meet
ings of unemployed which wcro held in
Dcrlln tho other day. The socialist organ,
the Vorwnrts, notes the fact that tho men
as a rule wero morally and physically
greatly superior to thoso who attended tho
meetings of tho unemployed hi 1S03. Their
quiet bearing showed that they had not
lost hope; whllo tho good clothing worn by
most of them proved thorn' to have pro-
Ided In prosperous times for a period of
depression. Kverywhero the speeches wero
followed with tho keenest attention, and
a number of moro or less socialistic reso
lutions wero unanimously carried. It was
decided that, In view of tho constantly in
creasing severity of tho economic crisis,
tho Prussian nnd Imperial authorities should
be urged to tako Immcdlato measures to
relieve distress. Tho municipal authorities
were requested to proceed at ouco with all
contemplated building schemes, and, la
deed, to proceed with municipal works of
every kind. It was also resolved to pe
tition tho Imperial government to give Its
serious attention to the proposal of Herr
Auer fo- tlm establishment of labor bureaus
nnd na Imperial department of labor. Spe
cial stress was laid upon tho necessity of
avoiding nny Increase tn the burdens of
tho working classes through Indirect taxa
tion, and especially through any Increase
la tho duty on tho most important neces
saries of lite, a policy which, In present
circumstances, could not fall tn bo followed
by most disastrous consequences. As nn
alternative to tho now tariff schemo the
government wns urged to concludo sound
commercial treaties with foreign nations.
llrltlsh scrvlco payers havo noted that
tho prlnco of Wales Is tho first helr-ap-
parcnt to tho llrltlsh crown to hold an ac

service on their sldo of tho water. Hitherto
tho helr-apparcnt has been put Into tho
army, nnd nny nnvnl rank ho may hnvo
held has been purely honorary. Tho same
rule was followed In the enso of tho sons
of tho present king; Prlnco Kdward was
made a soldier, and died whllo major In a
hussar icglmcnt; Prlnco Gcorgo was mado
n sailor nnd hns commanded his own ship
on a regular cruise. Now, by' tho death
of his cider brother, ho becomes prlnco of
Wales, tho first of tho lino to bo a sailor.
Hitherto bo has been promoted rapidly,
hut with a decent period of service In each
rank, until ho now holds tho commission
of n captain. Hereafter his promotion will
bo vory rnpld and his new grades will bo
honorary, n It will no longor bo advisable,
for tho heir to tho crown to go to sea In
command of u fleet, or to take tho risks of
a naval olllccr.
Ono of tho most difficult posts to fill sat
isfactorily In tho Austro-Uungnrlan diplo
matic scrvlco ls that of ambassador to tho
Vatican. Tho approaching retirement of
tho present ambassador, Count Itovcrtern,
has mado It neccssnry to select his suc
cessor and for a long time tho matter has
beun under tho anxious consideration of
tho minister of foreign affairs, Count
Goluchowskl. It has been tho subject of
much speculation In diplomatic circles, as
It was known that several prominent can
didates had, for various reasons, been set
aside. Eventually the nnmo of Count
Nicholas Szcecson, senior under secretary
of Rtato for foreign affairs, began to bo
mentioned. Hut It was thought that ho was
Indispensable, nt tho Foreign olllco, whero
for several years ho has been tho minis
ter's rlght-huml man. Ho owed that posi
tion to tho high opinion Count Goluchowskl
had formed of his ability when they wcro
colleagues In tho diplomatic service abroad.
I! ut tho nost nt tho Vatican will soon
bo vacant and It lins been decided to In
trust It to Count Szcccscn. A Hungarian
by birth and the son of a highly distin
guished nnd popular Magyar, Count Szcec
scn Is himself n man of strong Individuality
nnd a highly skilled diplomatist, qualifica
tions which are Indispensable to tho suc
cessful management of the many dollcato
questions with which tho Austro-Hun-
garlan rcpresentntlvo nt tho Vatican, In
these days, has to deal.
An Kngllsh newspaper writer In Brus
sels has beon making a special Investiga
tion concerning tho frequent reports of
hideous barbarities practiced upon natives
In tho Congo Freo Stato, and expresses tho
conviction that many of them aro Inven
tions or exaggerations, set nftoat by dis
charged employes, from motives of personal
malice, whllo others relato to outrages
which undoubtedly occurred somo years ago.
He points out Hint In many casos the nb-
senco of specified tlmo nnd placo makes
Investigation Impossible. His belief ls tlmt
recently there has been n marked Improve
ment In nil the conditions of government.
Tho other day he had an Interview with Mr.
Mohun, formerly United States consul nt
Homo, but now In tho servlco of tho Congo
Freo State, who has Just returned from a
throe years' sojourn In tho eastern prov
ince. Tho Iattor asserts that tho present
administration Is ndmlrable; that tho coun
try Is quiet from Stanley Falls to Tan
ganyika; that tho natlvo tribes appear to
bo Pontentcd and happy and aro paid
promptly for overy pound of rubber which
they bring In. In tho caso of murder or
theft by natives tho local chiefs exhibit
the greatest willingness to aid In tho de
tection and the punishment of tho offend em.
Everything, ho says, Is now sottled upon a
firm basis, business Is excellent nnd scandals
aro things of the past.
Tho effect of fearless public criticism Is
again seen In tho announcement by tho
Hrltlsh government that tho policy In man
aging tho roconccntratlon camps Is to bo
radically changed. Whothcr placing the
camps under tho civil authorities would
mean anything It Is too early to say, slnco
nil South Africa Is now under martial law
and, In fact, thcue aro no civil authorities,
Much good, however, ought to coino from
breaking up tho large camps Into small
ones of from 2,000 to 3,000 each, slnco there
by tho conditions should bo less favorable
for disease. Thero is no promise to estab
lish camps at tho sea coast so that permis
sion for nny reconcentrndos to go to the
scacoast would probably bo of no particular
effect In ameliorating present conditions.
Tho main argument for sea coast ramps
hinges on the food question. Far In the In
terior It ls moro dltncult to feed tho In
mates of tho camps. On tho whole, how
ever, tho government's announcement re
voals sensitiveness to tho world's criticism
ns well as to tho growing ngllatlon against
tho camps In Britain Itsolf.
