LONDON, Dec. 5. President Roosevelt's
declaration In hi1:' message to congress yes
terday on'.'tha treatment accorded to Japa
nese in the San Francisco schools specially
appeals to tlie British at the piesent time,
because both In South Africa and Australia
a similar anti-Asiatic (eclinx h.is created
embarrassment for the imperial authorities.
During the present week, the home British
government vetoed a, "Transvaal ordi
nance'' further restricting (he privileges
of Drltlnh Indians, evsu those long resident
In the oountry. while quite recently the
government refused to accept an Austra
lian . proffer . of a preferential tariff "pro
vided the goods were shipped In vessels
not employing yellow seamen."
The newspapers hers point out that the
western states of America have no monop

president's remarks "convey a lesson which
might' well be laid to heart In other qunr
tars than, that .to which It Is directly ad

PARIS, Dec. 5. The reply of Maitre Cruppl,
counsel for Count ..Bonl ; de Castellane
and the former countess. In the suit of their
creditors, consumed the entire session of
the tribunal of first 'instance of the Seine
today. M. Crnppl described how the trades
men's and usurers' bills had been cleverly
mixed up and reiterated the perfeet willing
ness of Madame Anna Gould to settle the
legitimate debts, although a delay was nec
essary', as there were no funds from the
trustee of . the estate at : her disposal at
present. Counsel argued that It was unjust
and Illegal to attempt to make Madame
Gould responsible for the enormous funds
borrowed by Count Bonl of usurers to meet
his "mad extravagance and princely prodigality."

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 The house to
day passed the bill permitting nntional
banking associations to make loans on teal
estate us security and limiting the amount
f such loan. The vote was 111 to 51. -
Tho bankers In the house urged' the pas
sage of the bill, while the opponent AX the
measure insisted that real estate was not
a proper security for national bAnks. They
contended that the pyEtem had proved a
failure wherever tried.
Mr. Do Armond of Missouri thought the
bill wan bad legislation, a' It would tend
to limit the power of the state banks.
"Any man who has unincumbered real
estate can get a loan at a lower rate of
Interest from loaning companies than he
can from a bank," he said.
Mr. .Hepburn of Iowa and Mr. Williams
of Mississippi, the minority leader, were
enthusiastic In favor of the measure, urg
ing that the bill would aid the farmers
very greatly and have a tendency to reduce
stock circulation.
Mr. Gromma of North Dakota also fa
vored the measure, but Mr. Kennedy of
Nebraska opposed It.

up favorably for the legislation, which It
was said, would go far toward popularizing
the national banks. The opponents of the

THE BLIGHTING EFFECTS OF DISEASES '
Weakness Is malady that roba a man of his spirit, ambitlou
and force. The nerve, self-assertion and stamina are killed by
It. The courage that leads manly men to smile at fate and
continue to fight Is destroyed. Thousands of young men, middle-aged
and old men can look back to their boyhood dHj-s or
early manhood with a sigh of remorse. The Ignorance of I
early youth has sown the seeds of future suffering. . '
Nature passes no act without affixing, the penalty for Ita
violation. When she Is outraged she will have her penalty,
although It takes a life. When through violation of her Im
mutable laws In early life man wastes away his nerve and
bodily vigor, he la then compelled to struggle under tim dis
advantages which Impede his progress and defeat his ends.
He can scarcely hope to compete with thoso of his fellows
who, possessing equal opportunities, have all their faculties
unimpaired and bodily energies at their best. When a man la
In a weakened condition, which Is lnconslstant with health,
strength and vigor, and which renders him unfit for the active
duties and pleasures of life, he is nearlng the danger point,
and should secure Immediate attention.
Millions of men have been wrecked through Ignorams) and
neglect. The trouble Is not so much that they have dls
gressed from Nature's Immutablo law, but that they have
permitted the trouble to lnslduously progress and become
more aggravated. They allow It to progress, all the , time
becoming more chronic and deeply seated. This fact Is usu
ally responsible for about nine-tenths of the suffering. You;
should remember that most diseases are progressive in their,
nature. Thev must be conquered by proper treatment yr they
will devastate your system and blight jour future career,
and prospects. - i 1

George W. Spear was the most damaging
wltnesB against Smathers. He swore that
Smatbers had requested him to open nego
tiations with Saunders as to whether Lou
Dillon could not be "fixed." 9iar said
that Saunders offered to do the Job for
Slo.uCO, but Sni'ithers thought that tno much
and told him to drop It. The defense im
mediately produced witnesses who declared
that Spear's charges were bad.
At the conclusion of the hearing John S.
Wife, counsel for Smathers, made, a bitter
arraignment of the men who procured the
charges against bis client, mentioning par
tlcu'.arly C. K. G. Hillings, owner of Lou
Dillon, and Murray Howe, secretary of the
Memphis Trotting association.
"I feel that we have suffered long and
patiently and bitterly " said Mr. Wise.
"The charges are absolutely unsustalned.
And as to Killings and Howe that Is a
matter for further developments, which
lnf r we will take under consideration,"
The case went to the board In executive

ARMY MAKES WIBEl-iis DEVICE
Government Saves Money by Making
Appliances Rather Than by
Buying Them Abroad.
WASHINOTON. Dec. s.-rThe United
States army la keeping pace with other
countries In the matter of modern appli
ances of warfare. Tho successful use of
wireless telegraphy In the movement of
battleships caused the officials of tho War
department to cast about for a wireless
outfit which should be at once compuct
and portable and which could be Installed
In the field In the shortest posnlble time.
Experiments conducted by the signal ser-
' vice within the last few months- have re
I suited In the construction by the goVern
j ment of a number of outfits of that kind
and they are now heing aiBinuuieu among
the various commands.
The high cost of wireless material abroad
lad the government to make Its own appll-
1 ances at an Immense saving, but It Is
! stated that they embody the principal ele
I ments of the latest Improvements of ap
: paratus of this character. Although it Is
felt that these outllts Ultimately win ne
vastly improved upon, they are already
capable of doing the most elhcient work
They are so constructed that they can
easily be transported on the back of three
horses or mules and may be set up In
twenty minutes. They can transmit mes
sages about W miles, and a valuable fea
ture of thtm Is that they will not inter
fere with each other In the(lr oieratlon.
The coast artillery stations will lie fitted
j up with the same outfits, from which com
' munlcation may be had with ships at sea
and transmitted to ths field if necessary.
When the army of pacification went to
Cuba It look along a couple of wireless
outfits and reports have reached tho de
partment that their operation has been
completely successful.

KILLS THE GERMS
OF SCROFULA
The laws cf nature nnd heredity are fixed and invariable. Tarents who
are related by the ties of blood, or who have a consumptive tendency, or
family blood taint, are sure to transmit it to their children in the form of
Scrofula. Swollen glands, brittle bones, weak: eyes, hip disease, pale, waxy
complexions, emaciated bodies, running cores and ulcers, and general wealc
constitutions are the principal waya in which the disease Is manifested.
Those who have inherited this blighting trouble may succeed in holding it
in check during young, vigorous life; but after a spell of sickness, or when
the system has begun to weaken and lose its natural vitality, the ravages of
the disease will become manifest and sometimes run into Consumption.
