that ths Insurgents are, as he predicted a
few days ago. at the end of their resources
from a military point of view, and are
melting away before the rapid advance of
the American troop3 at all points. His ca
blegrams were as follows:
"Fifty men of the navy and fifty men of
the army, transported by the navy, took
laoas on the 10th inst. General Young, with
Man!, followed next day. lie reports that
Howse, with Penn's battalion of the
Thirty-fourth, followed by a portion of the
Thirty-third Infantry, had passed north to
Ptddlng. east of Laoag. Marsh's battalion
. of the Thirty-fourth was at Cayan, prov-
ince of Lapanto. on the 7th inst. The
Third Cavalry was along the coast and in
thi mountains pursuing the enemy. Young
states his extreme northern force passed
over the mountains, driving the insurgents
under General Tino, who was badly
wounded, killing fifty and wounding many,
lie made large captures of rilles and prop
erty, with ail insurgent transportation, and
released all the Spanish prisoners in that
section, to the number of alxmt two thou
sand. Our casualties were two wounded.
Our troops are still pursuing the remnant
of Tlno's command.
"March's battalion of the Thirty-third
it-ports from Cayan. Lepanto province, on
the 7th Inst., that he has destroyed Ag
uinaldo's bodyguard, killed General Grego
rio Pilar, received the surrender of General
Concepclon and staff, killed and wounded
tlfty-two insurgents, released 573 Spanish
prisoners, including 150 friars, and captured
considerable property. His loss was two
killed and nine wounded.
"My Information is that Agulnaldo has
disguised hh individuality, abandoned his
troops, and is hiding In the province of
Benguet.
"Admiral Watson informs me that the
province of Cayagan surrendered uncondi
tionally to Captain McCally, of the New
ark, on the 11th Inst., all arms being sur
rendered. Major Batchelor Is ninety miles
uth of Apparri, with his command in
pood condition. Navy will take supplies to
Batchelor in launch at once. This sur
lender doubtless includes the province of
Isabella.
General Bates, at Zamboanga, reports
affairs there satisfactory. Nearly all rilles
surrendered. MacArthur, at Bayombong.
reports that he holds as prisoner of war
Mabinl, the ablest of insurgents and found
er of the late government."
ADMIRAL WATSON'S DISPATCHES.
The naval account of the operations of
the ships In Luzon is contained in two
cablegrams from Admiral Watson, at
Cavlte. They follow:
"Burwell reports that the Wheeling
landed a naval forte and a detachment of
triKjps, Kaiser commanding, sixteen miles
northwest of Laong, and attacked the city
yesterday, releasing 1.500 Spaniards. Am
holding, at the request of General Young
ao casualties.
"General Tlrona, commanding the Fili
pino, unconditionally surrendered Aparri
.nd Cayagan province to Captain McCalla,
of the Newark, on the' 11th of December.
Princeton and. Helena, at present In the
river. AH arms and ammunition surren
dered. Tlrona surrendered from patriotic
motives, to prevent further bloodshed. He
was appointed civil governor by McCalla,
subject to the approvalof Otis. The He
lena, was dispatched up the river wit!
stores for Batchelor's troops, ninety miles
south of Aparri. Aparri and Lugana light
bouses relighted."
The secretary of war regards' the Infor
mation conveyed in General OMs's dis
patches to-day as the most important that
has come to hand for months past. The
capture of Mabinl. reported by MacArthur,
from Bayombong. is especially gratifying.
It Is believed the Filipino leader wa? try
ing to make his way across country from
Eenguet, where he had been obliged to
part company with Agulnaldo a fortnight
ago, to the east coagt of Luzon. The mem
bers of the Philippine commission now In
Washington declare, without reserve, that
Mabinl was the head and front of the In
surrection. Agulnaldo was only a figure
head. Mabinl was the brain and directing
power behind him. He is a paralytic, an old
man, but of extraordinary ability and his
counsels were always conclusive with the
Filipinos. He was concerned In the first up
rising against the Spaniards. For a short
time he wavered upon Agulnaldo's breach
with the Americans, but finally cast his
fortune with the Insurrection and was
president of the Council. He was also the
financial strength of the movement, as.
without his backing, Agulnaldo would
have had no credit.
Next in Importance to the capture of Ma
binl, in the developments of the campaign,
was the bold stroke of Captain McCalla, of
the Newark. In capturing the whole prov
ince of Cayagan. With MacArthur holding
the province of Isabella adjoining, nnd
Young's holdings on the opposite or west
ern shore of the upper peninsula, the
American forces are now in technical occu
pation of the whole northern end of Luzon,
from a point Just north of the Gulf of Lln
gayen. McCalla posted at the port of
Aparri. the only good port on the northern
end of the Island, commands the greater
part of the whole length of the Rio
Grande, affording entrance by boats to a
full third of the interior of the Island. It Is
up this river that Captain McCalla is send
ing steam launches carrying supplies to
Major Batchelor.
The latter officer, with a few negro sol
diers of the Twenty-fourth Infantry, has
Just completed one of the most daring
marches connected with the present cam
paign. Detaching his little force from Mac
Arthur a week ago, he drove straight
through the center of the island north
ward, cutting loose from his communica
tions and bound to reach Aparri, or be cap
tured or killed In the attempt. Captain Mc
Calla's advices' indicate that he has suc
ceeded, being now within touch of the navy
on the north shore.
r.ate3s report lrom the southern archi
pelago has allayed the apprehension ex
cited for the security of things there,
growing out of the agitation by the mis
leading publications of Important insurgent
victories. Altogether the advices con
tained in to-day's dispatches have given
great satisfaction to the officials of the
War Department.

,
United States cruiser Raleigh at Manila,
Is now commandant of the Fort Orchard
naval station. When seen to-day in ref
erence to tne allegations made at Manila
by Colonel Julio del Rio, a Spanish officer,
and Senor Ilarael Roselo, a merchant, Capt.
Coghlan said: "Why, It Is ridiculous talk
ing of our having made any concessions.
There was absolutely no necessity for any.
I was ordered to capture the island and
did not lose any time In doing It. I sent
an officer ashore and immediate and un
conditional surrender was made to him.
We took, I think. 635 prisoners, more than
that number of Remington rllles, a quan
tity of ammunition, pistols, swords and
several cannon. I did not go ashore and
never saw Col. Uel Rio. Senor Roselo or
any of the prisoners other than through
my glas on the ship. In consequence I
could give them no personal assurance as
to the future, neither did I empower my
officer to make any stipulations and I
never heard of him so doing. In conse
quence there was no violation of any agree
ment. "Instead of sailing away on the even
of the 7th and leaving the garrison prac
tically unarmed and permitting the in
surgents to frequently fire upon the town,
we simply moved about three miles out
of the bay and anchored. We were always
In view of the town, with our searchlight
playing upon it. We had not then taken
the arma of the Spaniards and I had no
tified the insurgent commander that he
must not Interfere and my instructions
were obeyed. When I was ordered to place
the prisoners on board the Insurgent boat
Filiplnas it was done on the morning of the
Sth by my men and in our small boats. No
assurances whatever were given the pris
oners as to their care or disposition. We
did not have to."
Captain Coghlan states that he never re
ported that the German cruiser Irene
slipped her cable upon the appearance of
the Raleigh and oncord In Subig bay, al
though jome such rumor gained circulation.

SOLDIERS WELL T II KATE D.
Putnam County Dor Write off ill
Life In the Philippine.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
GREENCASTLE. Ind.. Dec. 13.-In a let
ter to his parents in this county Ernest L.
Macy. of Battery B. Sixth Artillery, gives
some Interesting Information concerning
the treatment of soldiers In the Philippines
and his and other Americans' opinions of
Agulnaldo and his band. He says:
We have plenty to eat and have a good
place to sleep, as I am working In the ar
senal and do not have to go out on the
rlrln? ii'ie only to take the ammunition to
the men in the rifie pits. Several of the
boys have received letters from their
friends, asking if it is true that they are
nearly starved and mistreated other ways.
To such questions we have only the one
answer to make and that is that we would
Just as soon soldier here as anywhere and
our treatment !s Just as good herfc as It
was in the States.
"If those fellows that are trying to make
heroes out of 'Aggie and his iollowers
would only come over here ar'i let them
get their clutches on them I guess It would
soon cure them of some of their false im
pressions. The Insurgents as a whole are
a set of uncivilized barbarians. They
care no more for human life than we would
for a dog's; care no more for their word
than If truth were unknown. They are too
lazy to work and 1 think that is one of
their causes for taking up arms, as It gives
them licence to ravage the country and
carry off what they can and burn what
they can't carry. It is no use to say we
can't whip them for we will whip them
and before many months roll around, and
then we will have one of the most fertile
islands on the globe. A to the native Fil
ipino he is quick at Imitation and I think
that after he comes In contact wltu the
civilizing inlluence of American government
for a few years ami comes In nodal contact
with the American citizens, they will soon
learn to adopt their ways. And
if he don't make a good citizen he will,
at least, make a better one than he Is
now or ever has been. Those that have
been in our lines since last spring have be
come quite Americanized. I have charge
of about twenty-five natives and Chinese
and I now like the natives lots the best."
Xo One Will Father the Story.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.-CoIonel Long,
the quartermaster In charge of army trans
portation at San Francisco, who was re
cently instructed by Quartermaster General
Ludington to investigate the report pub
lished in certain newspapers that Major
John A. Logan. U. S. V., had been killed
by his own soldiers as an act of revenge,
reports to the quartermaster general by
telegraph to-day that he has mailed a re
port of the result of the investigation. Col.

who was alleged to have made the allega
tions, denies officially and positively mak
ing any such statement to a newspaper
representative or to any other person.
"Captain Coulllng can find no one on the

by fome irresponsible party."
KEENLY CRITICISED.
Von BneloTT Speech by Ruwnian
Press and Politician!.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 13.-The speech
of the German minister of foreign affairs.
Count Von Buelow, In the Reichstag yes
terday Is keenly criticised here both by the
press and public on account of what are
regarded as pronounced declarations In
favor of German hegemony and their gen
erally warlike and threatening tone.
The Novoe, Vremya and other papers
take a more favorable view of Count Von
Buelow's speech. The Novostl says: "The
speech confirms the general belief in the
peace-loving policy of Germany."
The Herald says: "Russia Is as con
vinced of Germany's sincere love of peace
as of her own. Count Von Iluelow for
the first time in history alluded to the re
lations between Russia anu Germany as
Germany's security In Europe."
Miquel Defends the Emperor.
BERLIN, Dec. 13. In the Reichstag to
day there was a continuation of the budget
debate. Dr. Von clique!, the minister of
finance, replied to the criticisms of the
Emperor's Hamburg speech made by Dr.
Lleber, the Centrist leader. He said the
speech had found a patriotic echo in the
hearts of millions of Germans and had
also been a warning against the excessive
growth of party politics. The speaker said
he was not responsible for the speech. This
was a case In which the Emperor needed
no counselor. The navy bill as announced
was not beyond the financial strength of
Germany, and the Centrist?, he asserted,
would ultimately admit the necessity of it.

MUNCIE, Ind., Dec. 13. The Muncle po
lice are In a quandary and gamblers hold a
position of uneasiness since the recent de
cision of Mayor Tuhey in the disposal of
some cases resulting from raids by the po
lice. There were three arrests and a great
amount of furniture was taken. In one
prosecution, on the charge of operating a
gambling room, the accused, John L. Svel
gart, was found not guilty, and1 the peker,
crap, faro, roulette and stud poker tables
returned. In two other cases there were
convictions, one of the men pleading guilty
to being the proprietor of a gambling room,
but the furniture secured at his place was
returned, because the prosecutors did not
see it in use and could not testify in a man
ner that warranted its destruction. Ac
cording to the opinion of Mayor Tuhey, it
Is necessary for the police to burst in doors
and catch the men playing cards or other
games for money or chips which the police
know have been purchased with money. In
other words, It Is almost impossible to con
vict gamblers In Muncle. On the other
hand, the several raids that were made
caused some of the gamblers to ship their
furniture to other towns, and others have
closed their places and are afraid to re
sume business. Muncle never has been so
free of gambling houses as now, but sev

Made by Georjre lllce.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 13.-Howard Page,
vice president and manager of the Union
Tank Line Company, which company does
the transportation business of the Stand
ard Oil Company, was before the Indus
trial commission to-day. Ills testimony
was directed largely to the refutation of
statements by George Rice when before
the commission. Among other statements
by Mr. Rice which Mr. Page denied was
one to the effect that the Standard Oil
Company had received $250,000 from the
Cotton-seed Oil Company for its secret
trust agreement. Mr. Page declared that
not a cent. was received. He also charac
terized as false that the railroads, by pur
chase of Galena oils, are giving a freight
discrimination In favor of the Standard
OH Company, saying that the Galena oils
were used before the guarantees to the
railroads. The Standard Oil Company had
not received any commissions in any form
from the railroads since the passage of the
interstate-commerce law. The Standard
Oil Company had not received one dollar
of the $7,000,000 which it was claimed the
expert accountant had found on the Atchi

STRIVING FOB A CONVENTION.
lloth Citlea Auxlonw ta Entertain Re
publicans Next Year Chicago
Cuosen by Prohibitionist.
WASHINGTON. Dec 13. Representa
tives of the varlousrlval cities which seek
the honor of entertaining the next Repub
lican national convention began active
work to-day. About twenty members of
the Hamilton Club, of Chicago, reached
here late this afternoon and established
headquarters in a handsome suite of rooms
at the Shoreham Hotel. The party v Is in
charge of Samuel B. Raymorfd, and Is
made up of prominent citizens of Chicago.
To-night a meeting was held, and the sen
ators and a large number of Republican
representatives from Illinois attended and
promised their cordial support in endeavor
ing to obtain the convention for Chicago.
Subcommittees were appointed to canvass
the national committee and keep up the
fight to the end. Mr. Raymond will be
one of the speakers to advocate the ad
vantages of Chicago for the convention
city.
The Philadelphians who are already here
express themselves as delighted with the
result of their three days' canvass in
Washington, and say they believe Philadel
phia will be selected. ,They say the one
serious obstacle they have met is the
charge that Pennsylvania is in favor of.-a
resolution basing the representation in the
national convention on the Republican
votes cast, which, if adopted, would cut
down the Southern representation. The
Southern delegates, they say, have an idea
that Pennsylvania is for the proposed
change, and they started out to-night to
counteract this impression. Contrary to
expectation, the delegation of New Yovkers
who were expected to-day did not put in
an appearance, but it is expected in force
to-morrow morning, when the representa
tives from St. Louis are also expected.
It is expected that the Southern national
committeemen are determined to make a
hard fight against Mr. Payne's plan for
a reapportionment of delegates in the con
vention, based on the Republican votes
cast. The statement is made that they
propose to act as a unit and cast their
votes on the subject of the selection of the
place of meeting in such a way as will win
for them most support in their fight against
reapportionment.
