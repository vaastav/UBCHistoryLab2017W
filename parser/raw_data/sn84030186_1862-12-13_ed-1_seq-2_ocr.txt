0D. M. Adms, of Wabaunsee, is a candidate
for Secretary of tlie Senate. Daw has been a
Cleik in each Legislature for the last five years,
and has got to be one of the indispensables of
Kansas legislation. He is an untiring worker,
and being acquainted with every public man in
the State, it is unnecessary for any one to run I
against him. He has rare qualifications for the
position, and we hope to see him fill it.
THE HOMESTEAD ACT.
On the first dti of January, 1S63, this import
ant and beneficial act takes effect. From that
time any person, male or female, being the head
of a family, or a young man twenty-one years of
age, or a young man under that age, i here he '
has served in the army or navy of the United
States fourteen dajs, can, on the payment of ten
dollars and the office fees, enter one hundred
and sixty acres, or a less quantity, of any of the
public land, not appropriated, as his Homestead.
If the land is on the line, of a Railroad, where
the price of the land has been increased to $2.50
per acre, then eighty acres will be the quantity
to which the settler is entitled.
Occupancy for five years will secure the Pa
tent, and in the meantime, persons haing filed
under the provisions of the Act of the 4th of Sep
tember, 18-11, can, if they chooae, at any time,
prove up and pay for their lind, and thus-secure
a title before the expiration of the five' years'.-
The pioisions of the Act are ample in refer'
encc to securing the property; in case of death,
tothe heirs of'the deceased. J
On the pnymenbof $10 and the office fees, nt.
the time of making the entry, the applicant will
receie a Receiver's Receipt, -which will be his
title to the land till the expiration of the five
yeir, when the final certificate and 'patent will
be received.
One provision of the law allows poisons resid
ing on contigioUs land to enter such an amount
of adjoining additional land to what they already
own, as will in the aggregate amount to one
hundred and sixty acres.
TJVbeh wc consider the vastamountof excellent
land lying immediately on. and along the lineof
the Pacific Railroad, as well as the vast unsettled
tracts in all Western Kansas, to not notice the
land elsewhere, wc canuot but feel that the pas
sage of the Homestead Bill will form a new era
in "Western emigration. The field is now fully
open to the honest and energetic farmer, who
wishes to secure himself a home on easy terms.
Thousands of families can find the best of land
immediate- on the line of the Kansas branch of
the Pacific Railroad, but a ery small portion of
the land being yet taken.
Let. the.Governraent sun ej s be at once extend
ed, and the effects of this beneficial law will
soon fill our beautiful vallies with the busy hum
of active life. i
" THE RUMORED PEACE PROPOSALS.
The effect of the recent Eastern, elections
upon the. cause of the Government and Liberty
will be more disastrous than was at first sup
posed, according to the developments which
havo been jnade. Gradually tho intents and
purposes of the leaders of the Democracy arc
coming to light. At first they were ,: conser
vative" opposed to radicalism; now, arraying
themselves against every impulse pf loyalty,
and tho honor of the nntion. Wc cannot be
lieve that the people of the Eastern States are
so lost to honor and patriotism as to give the
vote they have, had such designs as the fol
lowing been intimated previous to the election,
It certainly cannot be flattering to a loyal
man to hear such talk from one of the leaders
of his party. No man, with a spark of patriot
ism within his bosom, can entertain .such
thoughts, or follow the man who gives 'them
utterance. Tcrnando Wood, in the following
extract of a speech made by him, justifies his
immediatedncarceration in Fort Lafayette", as
he'eonfesses to be in communication with "men
of position and influence in the Southern Con
federacy," ana his character js such that many
will doubt the .nature 'cl the" correspondence.
He will do to examine. But.herc is the extract:
"Mr. Wood said he had received information
and had coaimuuicated it to the Government,
that under certain circumstances the South were
ready to return aye, from leading statesmen of
the South.-, Men of position and influence in
tho Southern Confederacy had expressed a desire
to return under aTJcmocratic rule ; 'the past to'bC
forgotten, the public debt on both sides to be
provided for, and they were willing to let by--Corfea
be"by-goncs, if the North would, and the
Union once again be restored."
Thcrc.it is! They will come1 back " under
Democratic rule" that is, if they can "run
the machige." It will be impossible for ajace."
possessing in such a degree the,, true instincts
of manhood as doe3 the freemen of the North
to liTe as brothers with' slch people therefore,
if for nothing else, the war shopld be protracted
antil this spirit is whipped out of them. They
aiast be taught to. behave-themselves that the
world Is full of a good and better men than
they-.&nd should be put to live on probation
awhile with while folks.
Ne peace will be effectual, or inure one iota
tb'the'benefit of the Nation, but a coxqcebed
feaci. 'It -would be equivalent to admission oi
fiuVbnityoH the part of'the .Government to
exact anything less than an' unconditional sur
xeader from the rebels. Such an act would
iSd to1 the stabiiify or'ihe Government, nnd
ttaUUty mnt be established.

Philadelphia, December 1st, 1862.
Fbievd Union Since I last wrote you, things
in this vicinity remain almost in statu quo
advancing winter, the horribly bad weather,
and the necessity in a great measure of a reor
ganization on the part of the army having. been
the great draw backs to progress.- These obsta
cles, however, arc, being overcome as rnpjdlyas
possible, and any day nny ushtr in events
fraught with vital consequences to us as a nation.
On the banks of the Rappahanncek, separated
only by a narrow, insignificant stream, the two
largest armies that were ever gathered together
on this continent sit watching each other, the
oue making vast preparations for attack, the
other for resistance. Eight days ago, General
Sumner ent to the authorities of Fredericksburg
a demand for surrender within sixteen hours, or
the alternative of bombarding the town. Neither
the surrender or bombardment have as yet taken
place nor does the latter seem to be necessary
as a" military measure. The .rebels have their
'defensive works thrown up some distance to the
rear of the town, and, should Rurnsidc cross the
river, would peihaps be obliged to burn it them
selves. This is the short ronte to Richmond
the one often advocated, and which, should the
attempt be mide, may be deluged with blood,
and whitened with the bones of thousands of
those who but a few years ago were dwelling
together in amity under a government which
w as the nation's pride and the envy of the world.
This movement, however, is by many said to be
but a feint to draw the rebel forces to the pro
tection of the Fredericksburg and Richmond
Railroad, while the main attack is made from
some other direction whether the south bank
oFthe James, via Petersburg, or by way of the
York and Pamunkey rivers, our wiseacres do not
positively say. Fears are again entertained as
to whether anything at all can be accomplished
before the winter sets in with full severity ; and
our Generals are not all Napoleons, or the per
severance that marked the -winter campaign in
Russia might be rivalled on this side of the
Atlantic, though,, it is' to be hoped, without such
disastrous results.
With all the drawbackswith which the Gov
ernment has to contend, and notwithstanding
the fact that Mr. Seward's sixty days have nearly
lengthened into twice sixtyweeks, it is a source
of intense gratification 'to- every lover of his
country, to see the confidence placed in the
strength of our national fabiie by the great
money kings. Our present able, and popular
Secretary of the Treasury, being in want of -some
thirteen millions for immediate use to meet cur
rent expenses, telegraphed to the Assistant
Treasurers in New York, Philadelphia, and
Boston, acquainting theni with the fact. This
was on a Friday, afternoon, and by Saturday
eveuiug the whole amount was pledged, and
six millions handed in. Thi3,,too, in the face
of the statements of the English journals that
our national credit was exhausted, and that six
months of war would see us totally bankrupt.
As yet, the whole burden has been borne by our
own financiers, and the first application to
foreign capitalists has not been made.
It is amusing, however, in view of the many
encouragements for hope, to note the transient
alarm created, and tho gullability Jbf alarmists
displayed, on the arrival of each steamer from
Europe, with a plentiful supply of talcs of inter
vention. One day it is England, the next
France, and the next England, France, and
Russia, combined. The latest and most reliable
is that contained in the circular of the new
French Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Cabi
nets of England and Russia. However earnestly
the aristocracy of England may wish to spc the
United States bioken up into several powera, she
cannot take the initiative herself, her constant
jealousy and fear of the Emperor of the French
keeping her aloof from any complications that
may in any event lead to war, and give him an1
opportuiritjT for revenge upon "Perfide Albion."
Let the French eagle but catch the English lion
sleeping, and hi3 armies will be sweeping over
the green fields of .Erin, and the broadsides of
his men-of-war thundering at tlie docks of Lon
don. England would gladly interfere in ouc
quarrel, but a wholesome regard for her own
interests keeps her for the present out of it. I
do not refer to the mass of the people of the
mother country ; but like all other they are led
by the nose by tlie aristocracy, and these conse
quently mould the opinions, and make their
ideas the reflection of those of the whole nation.
In local matters, there is little of interest to
your readers. Thanksgiving Day was celebrated
more generally this year than ever before. The
streets were crowded w ith pleasure seekers, and
the theatres and other places of amusement filled
to their utmost capacity. But for the sick and
the maimed for life that cross our path, as we
saunter through the streets, and tlie tramp of the
Provost Guard n3 it makc3 its nightly ronnd
looking for absentee, one would scarcely ima
gine that war with its grim horrors was 60 near.
We have, indeed, many'things yet to be thankful
for. While the homes and hearts of many of our
citizens mourn tire absence of faces and forms
they may never see again, and while there is
scarce!' a household in our city but on that
usually Jiappy day of tlie year contained one
vacant chair atihf. Thanksgiving dinner, yet in
the revivaFof "business, the comparative absence
of want, among the poorer classes, the decrease
of crime, and the cheering letters we receive
from the absent ones, we have abundant cause
for thankfulness to the Giver of all good.

the 7th inst. a bloody battle was fought near
Fayetteville, Ark,, by the Union forces under
Gens. Blunt and Heron, numbering 8,000, and
the rebels under Hindman, Marmaduke, Frost
and Parsons, numberine 23.000. Gen. Blunt
held'the enemy in check for several' days, while'
Gen. IJerron wasmatching to his .relief. The
enemy. finally succeeded in getting between the
two commands, and attacked Gen. Herron about
ten, a. m , who by desperate ana gallant fight
ing held them in checlc for three hours, when
Blunt came up and attacked them in the rear.
The fight was desperate on both sides, and
was only terminated by the darkness of the
night. Our forces bivouacked on ' the field,
ready to renew the fight in the morning, but
the enemy fled across Boston Mountains under
cover of the night
The loss on both sides was heavy. Oar killed
is small in proportion to the wounded. The
enemy's loss is at least four to eur one, oar
artillery doing terrible execution. Gens. Hind
man and Marmaduke -in an interview under a
flag of truce, admitted that they were badly
whipped. Among the enemy killed was Col.
Stein. The 19th and 20th Iowa, 37th Illinois,
and 20th Indiana regiments suffered severely.
Gen. Herron is highly complimented for his
bravery.
This is the battle to which Gen. Blunt refers
to-as -likely toxome offcer be a big foot race, in
a dispatch published in another column.
Most of the boys in the army from this sec
tion of the country were no doubt in this battle
and further news from there will be looked for
with painful interest, by their many friends in
this vioinity.
THE RAILROAD AT LAWRENCE.
We learn by the Topeka Record that at a
recent conference between the Directors of the
Leavenworth, Pawnee and Western Railroad
Company, nnd a" committee of the citixens of
Lnwrence, it was made known that notwith
standicg the desire of the Company to construct
the road to Lawrence, the economy which they
are constrained to use in its building, requires
them to go two and a half miles to the north
ward of that place. They, ask the people Of
Lawrence to guarantee that the Company will
incur no additional expense in turning aside
to accommodate their town. The Company
are also in doubt as to whether tho Government
will allow the application of the $16,000 per
mile for such delations. If not, then Law
rence must pay the whole extra cost of con
struction. Communities, as well as indhiduals, must at
ill times act upon the principle of the Golden
Rule. Lawrence, in her blindness and hogr
giehncss, has always decrjed Western Kansas
unscrupulously in her grasping after the trade
f SouMiern Kansas. In everything pertaining
to leal rivalry she has always exhibited the
most unmitigated meanncs3. We remember,
during the piliny days of Lecompton, wben
Lawrence feared she might outrival her, how
ungenerously and mean she acted. No act
was too mean or low for her to s'oop to or
connive at in diverting trade from Lecompton.
o it would be with the rest of the world, if
she could act it out. During the recent cam
paign one of her papers made the " interests
of Lawrence" pat amount to overy other con
sideration, and would foist upon the State at
large a pack of unprincipled politicians and
rebel sympathizers that the " intorests of Law
rence" might be subserved.
But a day of reckoning, it seems, is near at
hand. The only Railroad which in all proba
bility will br built in the St-ite for years to
come, runs West, and not South. She has now
to pay almost what it is worth to have that
road come to her. In the meantime let her
turn her attention tothe West; and further
more, to go slow, for ehe has fully as much to
atone for as Lecompton had.
Upon a recital of the travails of Lawrence,
Manhattan would be cxcuseable if she trembled
a little. She hasn't been very scrupulous in
her efforts to turn trade up " the Blue.' Nor
is it consistent in '' friends" of Western Kansas
to entertain a thought of turning the Railroad
up "the Blue."
Let men lay aside such petty considerations,
and be thankful that the rich and beautiful
valley of the Kaw is not always to look bleak
and desolate, but soon to teem with life, and
its hills to echo with the lapid rumbling of the
heavily freight-ladened cars.

Great Capture of Rebel Treaties and Correspon-
dence.
We were shown yesterday., by Colonel
dough a roll of five or sis hundred pages
in foolscap paper, of treaties and correspon
dence between the Southern' Confederacy,
the Witcbta nnd other tribes of Southern
Indians;. A number of the documents were
signed by Albert Pike, as .Commissioner of
tho Confederate States of America. There
waa no mistaking the well-known auto
graph of that distinguished rebel. Accom
panying these documents were a number of
muster rolls, mustering Indiana into the
Confederate service, and one document or
order related to mustering Indians into the
spy service. , ,
These important papers will' be delivered
by Golonel Clougb in a few days. to tbeAYar
Departments at Washington. ' tll
Among other things we were shown a
rebel paper, called the Sherman Journal.
published at Sherman Texw. Jt is dated
September last, and is published, on light
brown wrapping paper.
These documents 'were captured i the
Witchta. Agency, in Texas, by a band of
loyal Delaware Indians, from this cotraij;
who were 'out on a kind of extensive recon
Doiggaace. They came .upon the Agency
suddenly, and discovering that .it waa .the
rendezvous, of a large nwnber of traitor
whites jmdi Indiams, they wu&i ' desperate
onset upon the place, and massacred and
scalped every Hviag: soals there, aid thus
captured these interesting State papers.

n Vletterfrom New OrleaniJ dtled
Sept. liSth,. Kig. Gen.Nfeajs Jus
speaks of the condition of slavery in Lou
isiana :
,As to the institution of slaveryyit .is
virtually overthrown already indeed it is
literally so everywhere within our military
lines. The 6laves think themselves free,
and will not work fortheir masters unless
they choose to. do so, andualcss .they are
paid. Many masters now pay their slaves,
some- ten dollars' some twelve .dollars a
month, and some stipulate to give one-third
of their entire crop for their labjjjr in sav
in it. The slaves leave their master as
they please and go away without fear j nor
have thoy the least fear for the old despot
ism. I have now about six hundred of
them at these forts, .constantly employed in
Government service, and they have no fear
at any time to go back to get their things.
They have no fear of their masters, nor of
the laws of Louisiana. They judge rightly
that these latter are no longer of any ac
count. Some time ago I went into a large
village, and hearing that a loyal man was
coufincd in the jail, I went to it, and made
the jailor exhibit his list of prisoners,
Anions them were many fcUves, who were
committed for safe keeping, and three whites
on a charge of murder. I demanded to
sec the slaves, and was taken into a large
airy room occupied by tho alleged murder
ers, ua tne noor oi tms apartment was a
trap door, which the keeper raised, bidding
the slaves come up, which they did. '
The effluvium coming up from the den
below was so offensive that my officers
could not endure it. After a little time I
looked down tho hole, and found it was 'a
wretched place, with only two small, heavi
Iv "rated windows for light and air. They
were in confinement under the laws of
Louisiana, but I bade them go and they
went. This was trampling those laws un
der foot, and the slaves all nnderstood since
that time that they are no longer in bondage
bv the law, for the slave laws are null.
Manv Dlantations are abandoned by their
owners and I am taking possession of them.
Yesterday I sent an officer to a great estab
lishment, the crops of which, now upon the
around, are one thousand hocsheads of
sugar, besides great quantities of produce,
worth in all one hundred thousand dollars.
All the whites aro gone, leaving one hun
dred negroes behind, and my officer' is to
superintend the estate, and secure tne crops,
and this week I shall takeossession of two
other great plantations, in tho same way
and for the same purposes. In Louisiana,
before the war, negroes sold for more money
than in any other State, because the sugar
planters were making immense profits and
were constantly extending 'the cultivation
of the cane.
At present slaves are without value here,
nnd there is no market for them whatever."
The entire busiuess of the State is destroyed
and vast numbers of men, of princely for
tunes before the war, are beggars now.
Their trade entirely stopped, and their last
year's crop destroyed or seized, and appro
priated by the rebel government, they aro
left without resource."

Rebel Losses.
The Savannah Republican has the fol
low inn relative to rebel losses in ,tbe year
18G2 : " Our loss in killed and wounded at
Fort Donelson may be roughly estimated at
ouuu , at xvoanoKU mm uu iiiu xiuriu vmu-
lina coast, 600; at Elkhorn, 3500; at
Shiloh, 10,000;. at "Williamsburg, Seven
Pines, and beforo Richmond, 28,000: in
the valley of the Shenandoah, 5000: at
Cedar Run, 1200 ; at the second battle of
Manassas, 5000 : nt Boonston and Cramp
ton gaps, 4000; at Sharpsburg, 12,000; at
Corinth, 4000 : at Ferry ville, 3UUU, and
5000 for those who have fallen at outposts,
in skirmishes. &c. These figures added
together make the frightful sum 85.000
Of this number it would be safe to say that
one-third, ,or 28,000, aro now in their
graves, having been killed outright or died
of their wounds. Quite as many, probably
more, havedfod from sickness. -To this
should be added 27,000 more of those who
have been maimed, and whose health has
been ruined ibr "life. Thus, our losses in
ten months of the present year may be
estimated at 75,000 men, who have either
perished or been disabled. If tho whole
truth were known, they would -probably
reach-100,000 by the end. of the yef7,for
the deaths from diseases m the hospitals, in
the camp and at home generally exceed
those in battle. For every year the war
continues we must expect our casualties to
be quite as heavy as they have been the
present.

Princely Testimony Agaiast Slavery.
Here is what Prince ?e JoinvilIe,has"to
say of slavery; 'as incidental to his k sketch
of McClellan s Peninsular campaign t
Great things can be done with slavery ;
fabulous wealth may be rapidly acquired,
as in Saint Domingo 7 while the blacks tilt
the sou, the whole free population may be
put under arms, and carry on a war victor
iously with superior forces, as we see now
done in Virginia. But these are temporary
enecis j and in. the Jonr. run, slavery, weac
ens, ruins, and demoralizes all it touches.
Compare the destinies of two great neigh
boring, cities Louisville' and Cincinnati ;
compare what the first has become, in spite
of natural adyantages, under the weakening
influence of slavery, with the 'marvellous
growth of its rival, under the influence of
freedom. The fate bfTthe slave Union

that effect. If the conditions 01 our reia-
tions with other nations is less gratifying
than formerly, it is certainly more satiifach
tory than a nation so unhappily distracted j
might have reasonably apprehended. A

in a season of great commercial prosperity.
like the present, without committing occa-
sional mistakes, aud inflicting unintentional
injuries upon foreign nations and subjects.

lanre and augmenting numocr 01 uuuuuui
cases, upon which the Government is unable
to agree with the Urovernments wnose pro
tection is demanded oy tne claimants.
There are more cases, in which the united
States or their citizens suffer wrongs from
the military or naval authorities of fprcign
nations, which the uovernment or mose
States is not prepared to redress. I have
proposed to some of the toreign btates
interested, mutual conventions to examine
and adjust such complaints. This has been
made especially to Ureat liritam, trance,
Spain and Ruu, in each'ca;o it has been
favorably received but not formally adopted.
Applications have been made to me ny
many free Americaqs of Africin descent,
to favor their emigration, with a view to
such colonization as was contemplated in
the recent acts of Congress. Other parties
at home aud abroad, some from interested
and other motives, have suggested similiar
measures, while, on the other hand, several
of the Spanish American Republics have
protested against the sending of such col
onies to their respective territories. Under
theso circumstances, I have declined to
move any who belong to any State, without
first obtaining the consent of its government,
with an agreement on its part to receive and
protect such emigrants in all their rights
as freemen, and I have at the same time
offered to the several States situated in the
Tropics or having colonies there, to nego
tiate with them, subject to the advice and
consent of the Senate, to favor the volun
tary emigration of portions of that clas3 to
their respective territories upon conditions
which shall be equal, just and humane.
Liberia and na ti are yet the only coun
tries to which colonists of African, descent
from here could go with certainty of being
received and adopted as citizen?, and I
regret to say that such persons contemplat
ing colonization do not seem so willing to
these countries as to some others ; nor
willing as I think their interests demand.
I believe, however, that the opinion is im
proving, and that ere long there will be an
augmented and considerable emigration to
both these countries.
Our relations with European States
remain undisturbed, and with States of our
own continent havo Improved, especially
with Mexico,' Costa Rica, fco.
The President speaks of a favored pro
ject, the Atlantic Telegraph, and extending
the raciuc line to connect witn mat oeing
extended across the Russian Empire.
The mineral resources' of the Territories
ought to be developed as rapidly as possi
ble; every step in that direction would
have a tendency to improve the revenues.
It is worthy of serious consideration uheth
er some extraordinary' measures to promote
that end cannot be adopted. One meaDS
which suggests itself as most likely to be
effective is a scientific exploration. The
vast expenditures incident to the military
and naval operations required for the sup
pression of tho rebellion, have hitherto
been met with a promptitude and certainty
unusual in similar circumstance?, and the
public credit has been fully maintained.
The continuance of the war, however, and
the increased disbursements made necessary,
demand your best reflections as to the modes
of providing the necessary revenue. The
suspension of specie payment by the banks
made large -issues of United States notes
unavoidable; in no other way could the
paymenl'of the troops and the satisfaction
of other just demands be so economically
and a3 well provided for. It is extremely
doubtful whether a circulation of U. S.
notes, payable in coin, and sufficiently large
for the wants of the people, can be perma
nently, usefully and safely maintained. Is
thero any othor mode in which the necessary
provision for the public wants can be made,
and the great advantages of a safo and
uniform currency scoured? I know of
none which promises so certain results, and
at the same time so unobjectionable, as the
organization of banking associations under
a general act of Congress, well guarded in
its provisions. To such associations the
Government will famish circulating notes

Railroad j also, favorable action of Congress

canals of New York, Illinois and Michigan.
The President refers to his compensated
emancipation proclamation of September
22nd, and says that portion of the earth
occupied by the people of the United States
is well adapted to the home of a national
family, and not for two or more. In the
inaugural address I briefly pointed out tho
total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy
for differences between tno people of the
two sections, E did so in language which
I cannot improve. Physically speaking wo
cannot separate our respective sections from
each other, nor build an impassible wall
between them. He then remarks at length
on the difficulty of making any national
boundary lines.
The President then suggests amendments
to the Constitution, Congress concurring, to
bo proposed to the Legislatures or Conven
tions of the several States, which if latified
by three-fourths of them, will be valid as a
part of said Constitution.
The first article proposed tharlall States
abolishing slavery before January 1st, 1900,
shall receive compensation from the United
States.
3d. Congress may approprsate money
and otherwise provieo for colonising fre
colored persons, with their consent, at! any
place without the United States.
The President discusses those articles at
some Ieugth, and asks if, then, for a com
mon object slave property is to be sacrificed
is it not just that it bo done at a common
charge ? And if with less money, or mon
ey more easily paid, we can preserve the
Union by this mode than by the war alone,
is it not commendable to do it ?
The proposed emancipation would shorton
the war, and in this way perpetuate peaco,
and insuro an increase in population pro
portionately to the wealth of tho country.
The President then says, the plan, consist
ing of these articles is recommended, not"
but that the restoration of tho national
authority would be accepted without it, nor
will the war or proceedings under the proc
lamation of September 22d bo stayed be
cause of the tecommendation of this plan.
Its timely adoption, I doubt not, would
bring restoration, and thereby stay both,
and notwithstanding the plan, the recom
mendation that Congress provide by law
for compensating any State which may
adopt emancipation before his plan shall
have been acted upon, is hereby earnestly
renewed. This plan is recommended as a
means not in conclusion of, but additional
to all others for restoring and preserving
tho national authority throughout th.
Union. The subject is presented cxcltf-
sivcly in its economical aspect. Tho plan
is proposed a3 permanent Constitutional
law.
In conclusion, the President says the
dogmas of the quiet past aro inadequate to
thfe stormy present, the occasion is filled
high with difficulty, and wo must rise with
tho occasion. Tho fiery trial through
which we pass will light us down in honor
or dishonor to tho latest generations. Wo
say that we are for the Union. Tho world
will not forget that while wo say this, wo
do know how to save the Union.
In giving freedom to the slave we ensure
freedom to the free honorable alike in
what we give and what we preserve. Wo
shall nobly save or meanly loso the last,
best hope of the earth. Other means may
succeed ; this could not fail. The way is
plain, peaceful, generous, just a way which,
if followed, the world will forever applaud,
and God must forever bless.

General Burnaide No Winterqaarters.
The New York Times special dispatoh
says it is proper to say that General Burn
side never possessed the- confidence of the
Government more than at present, and that
since his' recent visit to Washington the
confidence has resulted in a very great in
crease in his powers and his liberation from
many of the restraints under which he pre
viously labored. All stories to the effepi,
that the army of the Potomac will go into
winter quarters are sheer fabrications.
There will be mo cessation till tho rebellion
is beyond the power. of inflicting further
mischief. "
Our advances from Falmouth and Fred
ericksburg confirm the information that iLee
is removing a large portion of his. forces
southward, concentrating them jn such a
manner as to be able either to arch, to the
relief of Richmond in case of an. attack in
flank or to act asa.,.reserve ih case of an
attack en Jredericksbarg;.
l,The London Times, referring to ho
case of the ship Blanche, burned at sea by
the pirate Alabama, says :
This case of outrage is moat complete.
Everything ship, flag, destination, 'place
of capture, and burning, all were neutral;
and ore 'international rights were violated
in broad jhylignt than a casnist would have
