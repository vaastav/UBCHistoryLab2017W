vr il ,J, fioin UJi part of the secretary's re
port, ih.it h-) ii Dii tak.'ij. Kosumption is to
bn in a saiall propcrfion by money paid down,
und iu a iarg-! one by j remises of more to be
pid i v, d. It will be observed that the sec-n-tary
ih tn not explain how proruisns to pay,
UfUi.il aft-T January are specio resurx-p-tiou,
while, when isued before that date,
they are cot. The q iettiou may bo referred
to the conundrum eclumn of the religious
pap-rs. Tnat we correctly represent the po
suiun of the secretary is shown by the follow
in;; txtratt fro::i Lis report: "The power to
soil any of tUebunc'3 d. scribed ia tha fundiug
act continues after aa we'll as before resump
tion. Though it nu'.y cot le often n?ed, it is
t-:.' i:tial to enable this department to meet
em"r(enci''s. By its exercise it is antici
pated that the treasury, at Bny time,
can readily obtain Coin to, rein
foree the reserved already accumulated."
1 tie following announces a policy to be pur
sued by the trea: ury, under resumption,
w hich has bccn&hadowtd forth, but which is of
a practical importance that demands special
attention : " The gold certificates hitherto used
by virtue of the discretion conferred upon
the neeatary, vti'.l not be issued after the first
of January next. The necebbity for them
Jiiriutf a euspension of specio payment is
olvio'i-i, but no lonpcr exibU when by law
every United Slates note is in effect a coin
certi5:ale. For convenience, United
States ncb'F, of the faino denomination as
toe larger cain certitirate?, will be issued."
Th" action here aunouncad is v;hat might be
1 -okej for in view of tha general pojxy of
the treasury, but the question naturally arises,
is a coin ceitiScate, or a coto equivalent to a
coin certificate, a certificate for coin? that is,
a certificate for which coin will be given.
The seen tary considers no change of law
n-'ermiry to authcri. his department to re
ceive United Statts rotes at the customhouse
after resumption, wl ile thoso notej are re-
di cmal.Ie and redeeined in coin. The secre
tary is of opinion that the resumption act
impliedly modified previous laws, laws made
under the pretsuro of war, eo as to permit
payment in L nited States notes ad well as in
coin. This shows tho secretary's opinion to
bo that resumption by payment, and by
promising payment, come to the same thin;;
as "rejumptiou" l; r.-unily understood to be
an ubandenun-tit ef prouiise for the actual
d -ej, a subi-tituti-. a of new promises ia ex
change for old cms appears at least a pe
culiar v.-ay of resuming a little touch, of the
Micawber mode of pecuniary transaction.
With a kooiI dra! of mxenuity, under this
state cf thin', Mr. Shci m:m rayi the United
States have "now definitely assumed to pay
tluseci.tes in coiu, and this necessarily im
plies tin! receipt of t'.iesj notes as coin." It
logically Miuws that the United States
having thus tak-n its own notes in
coin, may pay theia uway again as coin,
sj to that ixteiit there is a resumption
of O'ln pay meet without paying coin.
This h cei tiiiiily ir.g -nious, and so thoroughly
satiaQ-s the tri'As-irvr that he adds: "They
(the Luit.-d State.-. Let-si are then at a parity
with coin, and b.lh -hmld be received indis
crim:nate!y." The cfioial, however, docs
cut ectue'y t:u-t to Lis owa Ionic, for he
a-ks that tiiis authority hhcealj continue only
while cot'-s lire r.'Jein.cd "ia coin," evi-d-
ntiy c ii. t- uipu.t.c the , .osmbility of a ces
sation of such paym-'nt. Ujfitrary to the ex
pectation of many t.ruieV.'i.t.-i, Mr. Sherman
ot.jects to withdrawing iuail notes in order
tiiat the circulation of silver may be increased;
he leave., lLi to toe u'jli.-, pioposing to sup
ply such notes as are r.Viled for by the public,
whether below Cve dollars or not, he thinks
equal facility ti j.. t i other unlet or irrwiil
beet maintain both nt par. The secretary re
fers tj tha r iiver u iliar provided l.y congress,
though fv-.d-'rtV stt ii:t-n '...d to eupc-cede
the gold doi'.ur, and he i ,,titnat. s the present
value of that d iliar i.t eighty-six cents. To
i-u-itaia its purity wi'.: (;uld, he thinks one of
two things r-.qjis:!-: either to limit the
an. ouct of silver dollars the mint shall coin,
or to increase the weight of t'ucm, so aa to
approximate, ict.-iasicauy, to ths gold value.
otherwi.sj it tauuot be
exported,
while the gold vri'I be. Specially I
me attention i! congress is called
to the expectation of th t secretary that, if the
silver dollars are coimd in abundance, gold
wilt be exported, atlj s:VPr wM reraajn
only coin. " This possibility will greatly dis
turb crmPntenc in (oraiuptum, and may
make r.ecsiry lurg-r n-M rvcs and further
sales of binds." Here ogain, as all the way
through, Mr. Sh rroan shows Lis expectation
of the success of r-Mimption to be, not in the
power of the Un. ted Statu to di;harg its
,. .
debt, but in its p owe r to increase it by further
borrowing. Tin report b'.ULtly acknowledges
that the recent conference in Paris resulted
ia no aid com leg to us f.om otr.r nations in
deciding what .relation silver coin shall bear
to gold, snd " that each country mut adopt
its own laws to iu owa policy." Oar policy,
the secretary aga a explains, ii to limit tho
iisue of the silvrr doi'.ur, or t j incTra;e its
weight; we then .f re know exactly where he
stands on this sul j .ct, ia spite of inconiet
encies that caaed doubt as to his
real position. Ilo thinks that to
make the United Slates dollar one
tenth to one-eighth thicker, would be
satisfactory. The final conclusion of the re
port is that we should limit the issue of
silver dollars until the precise ratio of bilver
to gold is eitab!iha J, then tha weight of
nilver dollars should be increased up to that
ratio. In the meantime, tue secretary says
he will redeem United States cotes in New
York, in sums of not less than City dollars,
with gold or silver coin, reserving the legal
option of government; and will pay out
United States notes for all other demands on
the treasury, "except in case of coin demanded
on coin liabilities. This declaration defines
just what kind of resumption wo are about

The Methoit Kpitcopal church, especially
iu the northern States, is profoundly exer
cised as to whether the pastoral system of
itinerant preaching shad lie aboli.-bcd. A
convention was recently held in Ilrooklyo,
New Yrrk. and this q-j.-stinn elicited a
utormy debate. A vote will bo Uken at an
adjourned meeting which convenes this

who would adopt party creeds to suit the cx

JOHN WESLEY.
This letter was considered as a clincher by
Mr. Woodruff, who, in indorsing it, eaid:
It would le very nice for the gentlemen
in the city and in the large churches to have
the discipline so amended a? to give them
the cr-?am of the pnache. s and to give to
the smaller churches their throw off. 1 don t
want any amendni-ct. 1 wai.t to sband to
the system tm our forefathers did, and I be
lieve that in the end it will bring us sate to
beaven. We have amended enough. e
have amended the discipline; we have
amended hymn-books. That is all wed
enough lor tuose who are rich enough to buy
the bookn, but some of us are cot Amend
meiit never aoes any good. The discipline
as it is, now and forever.
Mr. Woodruff belongs to that class who
prefer stage-coaches and ox-teams to rail
roads, lie proposes to cling to the old sys
tem of itenerant pastors because John Wesley
favored it, and it is the,". old-fashioned plan,
forgetting and not seeming dieposed to
learn that the condition of things has greatly
changed, and tbat what was the life of the
Me: iiodist church one hundred years ago may
now produce death. When John Wesley
wrote the above letter the members were few
and scattered over an immense ecope of
country. But there were progressive men
in the Brooklyn convention ready to abandon
the honored traditions of the church if such a
policy would advance religion or the cause of
Methodism. Mr. Frunk Heard was one of
these. II j said:
The iiiueracy was the outgrowth of neces
sity. In the early Jays of Methodism there
were not enough preachers to send over the
country, and one wbo was appointed had to
go over a great den I of ground. In this con
ference we have all the preachers that are
needed. I don't believe we should sit in
cold seaU with a warming-pan at our feet
because our forefathers believed grace would
keep the body warm. It cems to me I
should argue the question on intelligent
trrnnnd. and not on the cronnd that our fore
fathers had something better.. This is the
aire of progression. Are three years enough

lie comes to the church. It takes him one
year to get acquainted. In six months of the
next year he goes to t. urope. is a gos 10
plan and work out his ideas in eighteen
months. As toon aa he gets a church where
pastor and people are in harmony with each
other he has to go away.
The feeling on thi9 subject in the Method
ist church is daily growing, and will produce
much bitterness before it can be settled.
The first advance from the old plan was the
lengthening of the time of stay at one place
cf a minister fro re one to two and three years,
and it will dobtlass be less difficult to make
the proposed innovation, fcr pld customs and
traditions onca broken crumble fast, The
itinerant system has driven hundreds of
preachers from the Metbodibt church, or from
the pulpit. Ilia evident that hundreds of
congregations of this denomination are dis
satisfied with this frequent changing of min
isters, and as apparent that hundreds of min
isters are so disaffected that they will seek
new fields of labor if a change is not
made. It hai been shown that the Method
ist denomination has a greater number of
ministers laid on the shelf, who are depend
ent npon the charity of the church, than any
other church, and this, it is claimed, is
chargeable to the system which oo frequently
changes their location. Under it they have
but little, if any, opportunity of accumulat
ing property. Beside this, the severance of
the three-year tie between a pastor
and Lis charge is attended with' other
and almost irreparable losses. It must be
admitted that there is some force in the argu
ment of those who cling to the itinerant sys
tem of preaching. They insibt that moot of
preachers preach themselves out in ono year,
and certainly in three years; that he and his
hearers fall into ruts out of which a sew mar
is needed to lift them and new circumstances
alon will raise him; that an infusion of fret h
blood or a stimulant tor the sluggish current
of the old blood is wholesome. The impor
tance of this question to the Methodist
church has elicited considerrLL) discussion on
the part of the secular press. After a careful
consideration of the argument on both sides,
it strikes us as a crime to take a preacher
from a community which ho suits and which
suits him, aud where he is making accessions
to his church.

on behalf of the Jews is that Wilhelmj is of
their race. This makes four of the best violin
players of the world and some will say the
very best descendants of Abraham," viz:
Vieuxtcmp8, Wieniawski, Joachim and Wil

can audiences, and the fourth, Joachim, ha
become known to those who had- cot heard
of him before through having had the de
gree cf doctor of music conferred upon him
recently, with much ceremony, by the Uni

composer, whom New Yoraers heard not

composer of Sakuntala and other works of
tho highest rank, are Jews, and so are
Strauss and Offenbach. J.ucca is a Polish
Jewess, and Tatti is also claimed as one of
the race. This is certainly a pretty good
showing for the chosen people, whose
numbers in Europe and America do
not exceed one in a hundred as compared
with the other population. All of tho Ameri

is Jews who practically control the newspa

Home, where, until within a few years, the
Ghetto still existed. Among the noteworthy
men of America few are to be counted of
Hebrew origin, although they appear credita

not strange in view of the fact tbat, with the
exception of the small body known as Portu

Wisconsin has had a Jewish governor, and
the Federal senate had an able Jewish mem

ine recent congressional elections have fur
nithed a direct and trustworthy test cf the ad
vance thus far made in the practical estab
lishment of the right of suffrage, secured by
the constitution to the liberated race in the
southern Slates. All disturbing influences,
real or imuicarv. had been removed from nil
of thov States. The three constitutional
amendments whieli conferred
FREE DO At AND EQUALITY OF CIVIL AND PO
LITICAL RIGHTS
upon the colored people of the south, were
adopted by the concurrent action of the great
body of good citizens who maintained the
authority of the national government and
the integrity and perpetuity of the Union at
such a cose ot treasure and life, as a wise
and necessary embodiment in the organic
law of the just results of tht, war. Tne peo
ple in the former slavehoidicg States accepted
these results, and gave, in every practicable
form, assurances that the thirteenth, four
teenth and fifteenth amendments, and laws
passed in pursuance thereof, ehould, in good
faith, be enforced, rigidly and impartially, in
letter and spirit, to the end that the humblest
citizen, without distinction of race or color,
should, under them, receive full and equal
protection in person and property, and in po
litical rights and privileges. By ttiese con
stitutional amendments the southern
section of the Union obtained a
lart'O increase cf political power in
congress and in the electoral college, and
the country justly expecteot that elections
would proceed, as to the enfranchised race,
upon the casie circumstances of legal and
constitutional freedom and protection which
obtained ia ail the ether States ot the Union.
The frii nds of law and order looked forward
to the conduct of these elections, & offering
to the general judgment of tho country an
important opportunity to measure the degree
in which
THE RIGHT OF 8UFFRAGE
cou'd be exercised by the colored people, and
would be respected by their tellow-citizens;
hut a more general enjoyment cf freedom of
suffrage by the colored people, and a more
just and generous protection of that freedom
by the communities of which they form a
part, were generally anticipated than the
rocord of the elections discloses. In some of
those States in which the colored people have
been unable to make their opinions felt in
the elections, the result is mainly due to in
fluences not easily measured or remedied by
legal prole&tion; but in the States of Louisi
ana and South Carolina at large, and in some
particular conzressinnl districts outside of
those States, the records of the elections seem
to compel tho conclusion that the rights of
the colored voters hu.ve been overriden, and
their participation in the elections not per
mitted to be either general or free. It will
be for the congress fcr which these elections
were held to make such examinations into
tb-ir rondunt ss mnv be appropriate to deter
mine the validity of the
CLAIMS OF V EMBERS TO THEIR SEATS.
. In the meanwhile it becomes the duty of
the executive and judicial departments ot the
government, each in its province, to inquire
into and punish violations of the laws of the
United States which have occurred. I can
but repeat what I said in this connection in
my last message, tbat whatever authority
rcstjj with me to this end I shall net hesitate
to put forth, and I sm unwilling to forego a
renewed appeal to the legislatures, the courts,
the executive authorities, and the people of
the States where these wrongs have bpen per
petrated, to gie their assistance toward
Cringing to justice the offenders and pre
venting g repetition of the crimes. No
means wituid By power will be spared to ob
tain a full and investigation of the al
leged crimes, and to secura the conviction
and just punishment of the guilty. It is to
be observed iait the principal appropriation
made for
THE DEPARTMENT OP .JUSTICE
at the last session cortained the following
clause: "And for defraying toe expenses
which may bo incurred in the enforcement of
the act approved February 23, 171, entitled
'An act to amend an act approved
May 30, 1870, entitled an act to en
force the rights of citizens of the United
States to vote in the several States of the
Union, and for other purposes,' or any acts
amendatory thereof or supplementary there
to." It is the opinion ot the attorney-general
that the expenses of these proceedings
will largely exceed the amount which was
thus provided, and I rely confidently upon
congress to make adequate appropriations to
euable the executive department to enforce
the laws. I respectfully urge upon your at
tention that
THE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS
in every district, in every important sense,
are iustiv n matter of political interest and
concern throughout the whole country. Each
State, every political party, is entitled to the
share of power which is conferred by the
legal and constitutional suffrage. It is the
risihtof every cit zsn, possessing the qualifi
cations prescribed by law, to cst one unin
timida'.ed ballot, and to have his ballot hon-
stly counted. So long as the exercise of
this power end the ecjoment of this right
are common and equal, practically as well as
formally, submission to toe results ot the sut
tr&Ke will be accorded loyally and cheerfully,
and ail the departments of government wili
feel the true rigor of the popular wilt thus
expressed. IS'o temporary or administrative
interest of tovernment, however nrgent or
weighty, will ever displace the zeal of our
people in dtloriso ot tuo primary rights of
citizenship. They understand that the pro-

progress andwelUre of the States depend on
the protoctui afforded their citizns. There
can be no pece without such protection, no
prosperity without peace, and the whole
country is deeply interested in the growth
and prospc-ny 0f aii jt parts. While
THE COUNTRT HAS NOT YET REACHED COM
PLQ'E UNITY OF FEELING
and reciproc4 confidence between the com
munities so Utely aud so seriously estranged,
1 tcei an abslute assurance that the tenden
cies are in bat direction, and with increas

override all prejudices, and all sectional or

OUR NEUTRALITY

THE tXIVERSAL EXPOSITION,
held at Tatis during the past summer,
has been attended by large num
bers cf our citizens. The brief period
allowed for the preparation and arrangement
of the contributions of our citizens to this
great exposition was well employed in ener
getic and j udicious efforts to overcome this
disadvautaK. These efforts, led and direct
ed bv the commissioner ceneral, were re
markably successful, and the exhibition of
the products of American industry was credit

to produce useful and important results, in
prolactin? intercourse, friendship, and com

with too provisions ot the act of February
2-, 1S7S. three commissioners were appointed
to an international conference on the subject
of adopting

that it is n-.cesF.iry to in lirtain in the world

of the Untie h government in the views of

deemed it my duty to tender the sum named,

upon this sut j -ct will laid before you.
Tue Spanish govern mc-iit has tfficialiy an
nounced THE TERMINATION OF THE INSURRECTION
IN CUBA,
ai:d the' restoration ot p-ace throughout that
island. Confident expectations are expressed
of a revival of trade and prosperity, which it
is earnestly hoped may prove well-founded.
Numerous claims of American citizens for re
lief for injuries or restoration of property,
have been amoag the incidents of the long
continued hostilities. Some ot these claims
are in process ct arljiiotment by Spain, and
the others are promised early and careful
consideration. The treaty made with Italy,
in regard to reciprocal consular privileges,
has teen duly ratified and proclaimed. No
questions of grave importance have arisen
wi.ii any other of the European powers.
THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT
has be;n desirous ot a revision ot such parts
of its treaties with foreign powers as relate to
commerce, and,. it is understood, has ad
dressed to each of the treaty powers a re
quest to open negotiations with that view.
The United S;ates gonernment has been in
clined to regard the matter favorably.
Whatever restrictions upon trade with Japan
are found injurious to tiiat people cannot but
affect injuriously nations holding commercial
intercourse with them. Japan, alter a long
period of seclusion, has within tha past ew
vears made rapid strides in the patu cf en
lightenment and progress, and, not unreason
ably, is looking torwaid to tt.e time when her
relations with the nations of Europe and
America shall be assimilated to those which
they bold with each other. A treaty looking
to this end has been made, which will be
submitted for the consideration of the senate.
After an interval of several j ears,
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
has again sent envoys to the United States.
I hey have been received, and a permanent
legation is now established here by that gov
ernment. It is not doubted that this step
will he of advantage to both nations in pro
moting friendly relations and removing
causes of difference. Tho treaty with the
Samoan islands having been dully ratified
and accepted on the part of both govern
ments, is now in operation, and a survey and
souTidings of the harbor of Pago-Pago have
been made by a naval vessel of the United
States, with a view of its occupation as a
naval station, if found desirable to the ser
vice. Since the resumption of diplomatic
relations with
S1EXICO,
correspondence ha.s been opened and still
continues between the two governments upon
the various questions which at one time
seemed to endanger their relations. While
no formal agreement has been reached as to
the troubles on the border, much has been
doue to repress and diminish them. The
effective force of United States troops on the
Rio Grande, by a strict and faithful com
pliance with instructions, has done much
to remove the eources of dispute,
and it is now understood that a like
force of Mexican troops on the other side of
the iiver is also making an energetic move
ment against the marauding Indian tribes.
This government looks with the greatest sat
isfaction upon every evidence of strength in
the national authority of Mexico, aud upon
every effort put forth to pravent or to punish
incursions upon our territory. Reluctant to
assume any action or attitude in the control
of these incursions, by military movements
across the border, not imperatively demanded
for the protection of the lives and property of
our own citizen, I shall take the earliest op
portunity, consistent with the proper dis
charge of this plain duty, to n cognize the
ability of the Mexican government to restrain
effectively violations oi our territory. It is
proposed to hold next year an International
exhibition in Mexico, aud it is believed tLut
the display of the agricultural and manufact
uring products of tbe two nations will tend
to better understanding and increased com
mercial intercourse betsveen their people.
With
BRAZIL, AND THE REPUBLICS OF CENTRAL
AND tOUTH AMERICA,
some step3 have been taken toward the de
velopment ot closer commercial intercourse.
Diplomatic relations have be.-n resumed
with Colombia and with Bolivia. A
boundary question between the Argen
tine Republic and Paraguay has been
submitted by those goverumeuts for arbitra
tion to the President of the United States,
and I have, after cartful exum-nation, given
a decision upon it. A naval expedition up
THE AMAZON AND MADEIRA RIVERS
has trough! back information valuable both
for scientific aud commercial purposes. A
hke expedition is aiiout visiting the coast of
Africa and the Indian ccean. The reports of
diplomatic and consu'ar cffLers iu relation to
the development of cur foreign commerce,
have furnished many facts that have proved
of puolic interest, aad have stimulated to
practical exertion the enterprise of our people.

THE ORDINARY REVENUES
from all sources for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1878, were $267,7bJ,S7t! 70; the ordinary
expenditure for the same period, were
$2;6,J64,326 80 lea vine a surplus revenue
for the ear of 20.7J9,5ol 90.
THE RECEIPTS
for the present fiscal year, ending June 30,
1&79, actual and eti mated, are as follows:
Actual receipts for the first quarter cctn
meiicing July 1, 1873, 73,359,743 43; esti
mated receipts for the remaining three-qmr-ters
of tha year, $19I,110,2u6 57; total
receipts for the current fiscal year,
actual and estimated, $2o"4,5C'0,G00. Tbe
expenditures for the same period will be,
actual and estimated, as follows: For the
quarter commencing July 1, 1878, actual ex
penditures, $73,314,573 27; and for the re
maining three-quarters of the year, the ex
penditures are estimated at f 106,755,420 73
making the total expenditures, f 210,100,000:
and leaving an estimated surplus revenue,
for the vear ending June 30, 1879, of
24,400,000.
THE TOTAL RECEIPTS
during the next fiscal year, ending June 30,
1880, estimated according to existing laws,
will be $2b'l,500,000; and the estimated or
dinary expenditures, for the eume period, will
be $236,320,412 68; leaving a surplus of
123,179,537 32 for that year. In the forego
ing statements of expenditures, actual and
estimated, no an.ouct is allowed for
THE SINKING FOND
provi Ted for by the act approved February
25, 18r which requires that one per cent, of
the enttr debt of the United Srates shall be
purchased or psiid within each fiscal year, to
be set apart as a sinking fund. There has
been, however, a substantial compliance with
tbe conditions of the law. By its terms, the
public debt should have been reduced be
tween 18G2 and the close of the last fiscal
year, f 513,361,806 28; the actual reduction
of the ascertained debt, in that period, has
been f;20 14,739 61; being in excess of the
reduction r-q nred by the sinking-fund act
1202,282.933 33. lhe amount of
THE PUBLIC DEBT,
less cish in the treasury, November 1, 1S73,
was f2,G24,200,0--3 13 a reduction, since
the same date last year, of $23.1.0.617 39.
The progress ma during tiia last year, in
REFUNDING THE PCULtC DEBT
at lower rates of interest, is vary gratifying.
The amount ot lour per cent, dod-js soiu taur
ine the present year prior to November 23,
1878, is $100, 270,900. and siz rer cent, bonds,
commonly known aa five-twenties, to an
equal amount, have leen,orwill be redeemed
as calls mature. It has been the policy of the
department to place
THE FOUlt PER CENT. BONDS
within easy roach of every citizen who de
sire to invest his savings, whether small or
treat, in these securities. The secretary of
the treasury recommends that the law be bo
modified, that small sums my be invested,
and that through the postofhees. or other
agents of the government, tee lreest oppor
tunity may be given in all parts of the coun
try tor such investments. Tbe test niode
suggested is, that the department be author
ized to issue
CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT,
of the denomination of ten dollars, bearing
interest at tbe rate of three sixty-five per
cent, per annum and convertible at any time
within oce year after their issue into the tour
per cent, bonds authorized by the funding act,
and to be issued only in exchange for United
States notes sent to the treasury by mail
or otherwise. Such a provision of law, sup
ported by suitable regulations, would enable
any person readily, without cost or risk, to
convert his money into an interest-bearing
security of the United States, and the money
o received could be applied to the redemption
of six per cent, bonds.
GOLD AND SILVER COINAGE.
The coinage of gold during the lat fiscal
year was t-W,7yi,9sO. The coinage of silver
dollars, under the act passed February 28,
1S73, amounted on the twenty-third ot No
vember, 1873, to $19,814,550, of which
amount 4,9-81.947 are in circulatiin, an
the balance, 114,829,003, is still in tl
possession of the government. Witi viewi
unchacged with regard to the act ucdei
which the coinage of silver proceeds it ha
been the purpose of the secretary fathfull
to execute the law, and to afford a fiir trii
to tbe measure. In the present tnancii
condition of the country, I am pesuadi
that the welfare of legitimate busines ai
industry of every description will le bo
promoted by abstaining from all attenpts ; '
make radical changes in the existing fiaanci
legislation.. Let it be understood thatdurir
the comict; year the business of the cannt

The Report of the Secretary of the Na7y
shows that the navy has improved during '.be
la-t fiscal year. Work has been done on
seventy five vessels, ten ot which have bien
thoroughly repaired and mado ready for sa.
Two others are in rapid progress toward
complet or. The total expei-ditures of he
year, including the amount appropriated For
the deficiencies of the previous year, wjre
$17,473,392 65. The actual expenses charge
able to the vear, exclusive of these dfi
ciencies, were $13,306,914 09, or $767,19918
less than those of the previous year, and $,
928,677 74 less than the expenses, including
the deficiencies. The estimates for the finci-.l
year ending June 30, J380, are $14,562,331
45 exceeding the appropriations of the pres
ent year only $33,949 75; which excess is oc
casioned by the demands of the naval acade
my and the marine corps, as explained in the
secretary's report. The appropriations for
the present fiscal year are $14,528,431 70,
which, in the opinion of the secretary, will
be ample for all the current expenses of the
department during Ihe year. Tho amount
drawn from the treasury from July 1 to No
vember 1, 1878, is $4,740,544 14, cf which
$70,980 75 has been refunded, leaving as the
expenditure for that period $4,669,501 39, or
$520,899 24 less than the corresponding pe
riod of the last fiscal year.
The Report of .the Postmaster-General
embraces a detailed statement cf the opera
tions of the postcflice department. The ex
penditures of that department for tbo fiscal
year ended June 30, 1378, were $31,165,084
49. The receipts, including sales of
stamp?, money-order business, and offi
cial stamps, were $29,277,516 95. Thesura of
$290,436 90, included in tho foregoing state
ment of expenditures, is chargeable to pre
ceding years, so that the actual expenditures
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, are
$33,871,647 0. The amount drawn lrom the
treasury on appropriations, in addition to the
revenues of the department, was $5,307,652,
82. The expenditures for the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1S80, nre estimated at $36,571,
900, and the receipts from all sources at
$30,664,023 90, leaving a defiriencv to bo
appropriated out of the trea?ury of $5,907,
876 10. The report calls attention to the
tact that the compensation of postmasters
and of railroads tor carrying the mail is reg
ulated by law, and that the failure of con
gress to appropriate the amounts required
for these purposes does not relieve Ihe gov
ernment of responsibility, but necessarily in
creases the deficiency bill, which congress
will be called npon to pass. In providing for
THE POSTAL SERVICE,
the following questions are presented : Should
congress aDnually appropriate u enni for He
expenses largely in excess ot its revenues, or
should such rates of postage be established
as will make the depaitnient seif-sustaining?
Should the postal service be reduced by ex
cluding from the mails, matter which does
not pay its way? Should the cumber of
post-routes be diminished 'i Should other
methods be adopted which will increase the
revenues or diminish the expenses of tha
postal service?
THE INTERNATIONAL POSTAL CONGRESS,
which met at Paris May 1, 1873. and con
tinued in session until June 4',h of the same
year, was composed of delegates from nearly
all the civilized countries cf the world. It
adopted a new convention, te take the pi ice
of thp treaty concluded at Berne October 9,
1374; which goes into effect on the first of
April, 1879, between the countries whose del
egates have signed it. It was ratified and
approved, by and with the consent of the
President, August 13, 1S73. A synopsis of
this universal postal convention will be found
in the report of the postmaster-general, and
the full text iu the appendix thereto. Iu its
origin the pottal union comprised twenty
three countries, having a population of three
hundred and fitly millions of people. On tho
first of April next it will comprise forty three
countries and colonics, with a population of
more than six hundred a d fifty millions of
people, and will soon, by the accession of the
few remaining countries and colonies which
maintain organized postal services, constitute
in tact as wMl as in name, as its new title iu
dicates, a universal union, regulating, upon a
uniform basis of cheap postage rates, the post
al intercourse between all civilized nations.
Same euibarrassment has arisen out of
THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE CUSTOMS
I.A1V3
of this country and the provisions of the
postal convection, in regard to the transmis
sion of foreign books and newspapers to this
country by mail. It is hoped that congress
will be able to devise some means of recon
ciling the difficulties which have thus been
created, so as to do justice to ail parties
involved. The business of
THE SUPREME COURT,
and of the courts in many of the circuits, has
increased to such an extent duriug the past
years that additional legislation is imperative
to relieve and prevent the delay of justice,
and possibl j oppression to suitors, which is
thus occasioned. The encumbered condition
of these dockets is presented anew in tha re
port of the attorney-general, aud the remedy
suggested is earnestly urged for congression
al action. The creation of additional circuit
judges, as proposed, would afford a complete
remedy, and would involve an expense at
the present rate of salaries of not more than
$60,000 a year.
The Annual Report of the Secretary of
the Interior and of the Commletiloner
of Indian Affair,
present an elaborate account of tha present
condition of the Indian tribes, and of that
branch of the public service which ministers
to their interests. While
THE CONDUCT OF THE INDIANS,
generally, has been orderly, and their rela
tions with their neighbors friendly and
peaceful, two local disturbances havo oc
curred, which were deplorable in their
character, but remained, happily, confined to
a comparatively small number of Indians.
The discontent among the Bannocks, which
led first to some acts of violence on the part
of some members of the tribe and finally to
tha outbreak, appears to have been caused by
an insufficiency of food pn the reservation,
and this insufficiency to have been owing to
the inadequacy of the appropriations made
by congress to the wants of the Indians, at a
time when the Indiana were prevented from
supplying the deficiency by hunting. After
an aduius pursuit by the troops of the
United States, and several engagements, the
hostile Indians were reduced to suhj-ction,
and the larger part of theia surrendered as
prisoners. In trim connection I desire to call
attention to the recommendation made by tbe
secretary of the interior that a suthcient lund
be placed at the disposal of the executive, to
be used, with proper accountabl y, at dis
cretion, in sudden emergencies of the Indian
service.
THE OTHER CASE
cf disturbance was that of a band of North
ern Cbeyenues wbo suddenly left their reser
vation in the Indian Territory and marched
rapidly through the States of Kansas and
Nebraska in the direction ct their old hunt
ing grounds, committing murders and
other crimes oa their way. From doc
uments accompanying the report
of the secretary of the interior, it appears
that this disorderly band was as fully sup
plied with the necessaries of life as the four
thousand seven hundred other Indians wbo
remained quietly on the reservation, and
that the disturbance was caused by men of
a restless and mischievous disposition among
the Indians themselves. Almost tbe whole
of this band have surrendered to the mil tary
authorities, aid it is a gratifying fact tbat,
when some of them had taken refuge in the
camp of tbe Red Cloud Sioux, with whom
they bad been in friendly relations, the Sioux
held them as prisoners and readily gave tbem
up to the officers ef the United States, thus
giving new proof of the loyal spirit which,
alarming rumors to the contrary notwith
standing, they have uniformly shown ever
since the wishes tney expressed at the coun
cil of September, 1877, had been complied
with. Both the secretary of tbe interior and
the secretary of war unite in the recommend
ation tbat provision be made by congress for
the organization of
A CORPS OF MOUNTED "INDIAN AUXILIA
RIES," to be nnder the control of tbe army, and to
be used for the purpose of keeping the In
dians on their reservations and preventing or '
reprefsing disturbance on their part. 1 1 ar
nestl? concur in this recommendation. It is
believed that tbe organization of such a body
of Indian cavalry, receiving a moderate pay
from the government, would considerably
weaken the restless element among tbe In
dians by withdrawing from it a number of
young men and giving them congenial em
ployment under the government, it being a
matter of experience that Indians in our ser
vice almost without exception are faithful in
the performance of the duties assiKned to
them. Such an organization would mate
rially aid the army in the accomplishment oi
a task for which its numerical strength is
sometimes fouod insufficient. But, while the

eonoresa. referred to a committee for inquiry
nd rennr t. Without desiring to anticipate
that report, I venture to express the hope
that, in the decision of so important a ques
tion, the views expressed above may not be
loit sight of, and ihat the decision, whatever
it may be, will arrest further agitation of
this subject, such agitation being apt to pro
djee a disturbing effect upon the service as
well as on tho Indians themselves. Ia the
esrolment of the bill making appropriations
for sundry civil expenses, at tha last session
of congress, that portion which provided for
the continuation cf
THE HOT SPRINGS COMMISSION
was emitted. As the commission had com
pleted the work of taking testimony on the
many conflicting claims, the suspension of
their labors, before determining the rights
of claimants, threatened, for a time, to em
barrass the interests, not only of the govern
ment, but also of a large number of the citi-
zets of Hot Springs, who were waiting for
final action on their claims before beginning
contemplated improvements. In order to
prevent serious difficulties, which were
apprehended, and at the solicitation
of many leading citizens ot
Hot Springs, and others interested in
the welfare of the town, the secretary of the
interior was authorized to request the late
commissioners to take charge ot the records
of their proceedings, and to perform such
work a3 could properly be done by them un
der the circumstauces, to facilitate the future
adjudication of the claims at an early day,
and to preserve tbe status of the claimants
until their rights snould be finally determin
ed. The late commissioners complied with
that request, and report that the testimony
in all the cases has been written out, exam
ined, briefed, and so arranged as to facilitate
an early settlement when authorised by law.
it is recommended that the requisite author
ity be given at as early a day in the session
as possible, and that a fair compensation be
allowed tha late commissioners for the ex
pense incurred and the labor performed by
them since the twenty-fifth of June last.
I invite the attention of congress to the
recommendations made by the secretary of
the interior with regard to the preservation
of tbe
TIMBER ON THE PUBLIC LANDS
of the United States. The protection of the
public property is one of tha first duties of
thn goveioi. iiniun.-ni or tne in
terior 6bou!d, therefore, be enabled by suffi
cient appropriations to enforce the laws in
that respect. But this matter
appears still more important us a
question of public economy. The
rapid destruction of our forests is an evil
fraught with the gravest consequences,
especially in the mountainous districts, where
the iocky slopes, once denuded of their trees,
will remain so forever. There the injury,
one done, cannot be repaired. I fully con
cur with tae secretary of the interior in the
opinion that, fcr this reason, legislation
touching the public timber in the mountain
ous States and Territories of the west should
be especially well considered, and tbat exist
ing laws, in which the destruction of the
forests is cot sufficiently guarded against,
should be speedily modified. A general law
concerning this important subject, appears to
me to be a matter of urge.it public necessity.
From the organization ot the government the
importance of encouraging, by all possible
means, the increase of
OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIONS
has been acknowledged, and urged upon the
attention of congress and tbe people as the
surest and reauiest mears of increasing our
substantial and enduring prosperity. The
words cf Washington are aa applicable to
day as when, in his eighth annual message,
he said: " It is not to be doubted that with
reference to either individual or national wel
fare, agriculture is cf primary importance.
In proportion as nations advance in
population and other circumstances of ma
turity, this truth becomes more apparent
and renders the cultivation of the soil more
and more ar; object of public patronage. In
stitutions for promoting it grow up, sup
ported by the public purse and to what ob
ject can it be dedicated with greater pro
propriety? Among the means which have
been employed to this end, none have been
attended with greater success than tho estab
lishment of boards composed of proper char
acters, charged with collecting and diffusing
information, aud enabled, by premiums and
small pecuniary aids, to eucourage and as
sist the spirit of discovery and improvement,
this species of establishment contributing
doubly to the increase of improvement by
stimulating to enterprise and experiment,
and by drawing to a common center the re
sults everywhere of individual skill and ob
servation, and spreading them thence oyer
the whole nation. Experience accordingly
hath shown that they are very cheap instru
ments of immense national benefit."
1'he great preponderance of the agricultu
ral over auy ot oer interest in the United
States entitles it to ail the consideration
claimed for it in Washington. About one
half ot the population of the United States is
engaged in agriculture.
THE VALUE OF THE AGRICULTURAL PRO
DUCTS of the United States for the year 1873, is es
timated at three thousand millions of dollars.
The exports of agr cultural products
for the year 1377, as appears from tha report
of the bureau of statistics, were five hundred
and twenty-four millions of dollars. The
great extent of our country, with its tfiversity
of soil and climate, enables us to produce
within our own borders, and by our own
labor, not only the necessaries, but most of
the luxuries, that are consumed in civilized
countries. Yet, notwithstanding our ad
vantages of esil, climate and intercommuni
cation, it appears from the statistical state
ments in the report of tae commissioner of
agriculture, that we import annually from
foreign lands many millions of dollars worth
of agricultural products which could be
raised in our own country. Numerous ques
tions arise in
ME PRACTICE OF ADVANCED AGRICULTURE
which can only be answered by.expefinieots,
often costly and sometimes fruitless, which
are beyond the means of private individuals,
and are a just and proper charge on tbe
whole nation for the benefit of the nation. It
is a good policy, espeoially in times of de
pression and uncertainty in other business
pursuits, with a vast area of uncultivated,
and hence unproductive territory, wisely
opened to homestead settlement, to encour
age, by every proper and legitimate means,
the occupation and t.llage of tho soil. The
efforts of the department of agriculture to
stimulate old and introduce new agricul
tural industries, to improve the quality
and increase the quantity of our products,
to determine the value of old or establish the
importance of new methods of culture, are
wortby of your careful and favorable consid
eration, and assistance by such appropria
tions of money and enlargement of facilities
as may seem to be demanded by the present
favorable conditions for the growth and rapid
development of this important interest.
THE ABUSE OF ANIMALS IN TRANSIT
is widely attracting public attention. A
national convention of societies specially in
terested in the subject has recently met at
Baltimore, and the facta developed, both in
regard to cruelties to animals and the effect
ot such cruelties upon the public health,
would seem to demand the careful considera
tion of congress, and the enactment of more
efficient laws for the prevention of thesg
abuses. The report of the commissioner of
THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION
shows very gratifying progress throughout
the country, in all the interests committed to
the care of this important office. The report
is especially encouraging with respect to the
extension of the advantages of the comcoa
school Bystem, in sections of the country
whttre the general enjoyment of the privilege
of free schools is not yet attained. To edu
cation more than to any other agency we are
to look, as the resource for the advancement
of the people, in the requisite knowl
edge and appreciation ' of their rights
and tesponsibilities as citizens, and I
desire to repeat the tugrfostion contained in
my tormer message in ueuau m mi.- enact
ment of appropriate measures by congress for
the purpose ot supplementing, with national

tions, in connection with the cnpjright sys

and careful attention of congress to s ive it
from injury in its present crowded and in
sufficient quarters. As this library is national
in its character, and must, from the nature
ot the case, increase even more rapidly in the
future than in the rast, it csnnot be doubted
that tbe people will sanction any wise ex
penditure to preserve it and to enlarge iU
usefulness. The appeal of the n gents ot the

drainage of tbe city, and are a d.uig-rcus
source of malarial poison, lhe reclamation
will improve the navigation of the river, by
restricting and consequently deepening its

Executive mansion, December 2, 1878.
REPORT OF TIIK BKCHKTABY K
THE TREASURY.
RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS.
The important duty imposed on this de
partment by the resumption act, approved
January 14, 1875, has been steadily pursued
during the past year. The piain purpose cf
tbe act is to secure to ail interests and all
classes the benefits of a sound currency, re
deemable in coin, with tho least possible d:s
turbaace to existing rights and contracts.
Three of its provisions have br-en substan
tially carried into execution by the gradual
substitution of fractional ooin for fraction il
currency, by the tree coinage of gold, and by
free banking. There remains only the com.
pletiGn cf preparations for resunuion in coin
on the first day cf January, 179, and its
mamtenauce thereafter upon, tne baNts of ex
isting law.
At the dato of my annual report
to congress in December, 177, it
was deemed necessary as a prepara
tion for resumption to accumulate
in the treasury a com roserva of at l.-at
forty per cent, of the amount cf Uaitod
States
notes outstanding. At that time it
. l..lKMlca U.c4b uuiloi nit- p.ovisioas ot
the resumption act the volume ot United
States notes would be reduced to $300,000,
000 by the first day of Jauu-ry, 1379. orsooa
thereafter, and that a reserve in coin cf
$120,000,000 would then be sufficient. Con
gress, however, ia view of the strong popu
lar feeling against a contraction of the cur
rency, by the act approved May SI, 1878, for
bade theretirementof any United States notes
after that date, loaving the amount ia circu
lation $316,631,016. Upon the principle oi"
safety upon which the department was act
ing, that lorty per cent, of coin was tbe
smallest reserve upon which resumption
could pfudent'y be commenced, it became
necessary to increase tha coin reserve to
$138 000.000.
At the closa.of the year l.s77 this coin re
serve, in excess of coiu liabilities, amounted
to $6-1,016,050 96, of which $15,000,000
were obtained by the a)e cf four and a haif
p;-r cent., and $25,000,000 by the sale ot four
percent, bonds, the residue being surplus
revenue. Subsequently, on the eleventh day
of April, 1878, the secretary entered into a
contract with certain bankers m New York
anct London the p irties to the previous con
tract of June 9. 177. already communicated
to congress for the sale of $53,000,000 four
and a half per cent, bonds for resumption
purposes. The bonds were soil at aprea iim
of one and a half percent, and accrued inter
est, less a commission of one half of one per
cent. The contract has been fulfilled, and the
net proceeds. $50,500,000, have been paid
into the treasury in gold coin. The $ 5,500,000
coin paid on the Halifax award have been re
placed'by the sale cf that amount of four per
cent, bonds sold for resumption purposes:,
making the aggregate am mat of bonds sold
for thse purpose.! $95,500,000. of which
$65,000,000 were four aud a half per cent,
bonds, and $30,500,000 four per cent bo.ids.
To this has been added the surplus revenue
from time to time. The amount of coin held
in the treasury on the twenty-third day of
November last, in excess of coin sufficient to
pay all accrued com liabilities, was $111,888,
100, and constitutes the coin reserve prepared
for resumption purposes. This sum will be
diminished somewhat, on the first of January
next, by reason of the large amount of inter
est accruing on that day ia excess of the coiu
revenue received meanwhile.
In anticipation of resumption, and in view
of the fact thq.t the redemption of United
States notes is mandatory only at the office
of the assistant treasurer in the city of New
York, it was deemed important to heeure the
co-operation cf the associated banks of that
city in the ready collection of drafts
on those banks and in the payment cf
treasury drafts held by them. A satisfactory
arrangement has been made by w hicii ad
drafts on the banks he-id by the treasury are
to be paid at the clearinghouse, and nil
drafts on the treasury held by them are to hi
paid to the clearinghouse at the otfice cf the
assistant treasurer, in United States notes:
and, atter the first of January, United States
notes are to be received by them as coin.
Tois will greatly lessen the risk and labor of
collections both to the treasury and the banks.
Every step in these preparations for re
sumption has been accompanied with in
creased business and confidence. The accu
mulatiou of coin, instead of ir.erea.sing its
price, as was feared by many, has steadily
reduced its premium in the market. The
depressing and ruinous losses that followed
the panic of 1873 had not diminished in
1875, when the resumption act passed; but
every measure taken in the execution or en
forcement of tliis act has tended to lighten
these losses and to reduce the premium on
coin, so that now it is merely nominal. The
present condition of our trade, icdustry, anl
commerce, hereafter more fully stated, our
ample reserves, and the general confidence
inspired in our financial condi'ion seem to
justify the opinion that we are prepared to
commence and maintain resumption from
and after the first day of January, . D.187;.
The means and manner cf doing this are
left largely to tbe discretion of (he aecretao',
but, from tbe nature ot tbo duty imposed, be
must restore coin und bullion, when with
drawn in t'ao process, of redemption, either
by the sale of bonus, or the u-e cl ; i.e surj lus
revenue, or of lhe noles redeem.-J Irjo lime
to time.
The power to sell any of the tejnds de
scribed in the refunding act contii u-s alter
as well as before resumption. Ti.cuh it may
not be often used, it is essential to en.ihle this
department to meet emergc-nciej. By its ex
ercise it is anticipated that the t .e ::-uiy at any
time can readily obtain coin to reiuf. rte the
reserve already accumulated. Untied .States
notes must, boreyer, be tbe chief m -ans. un
der existing law, with which tho department
must restore coin aud bullion we-a with
drawn in process ot redemption. The notes,
when redeemed, must necessarily accumulate
in ths treasury until their superior use and
convenience for circulation enables the de
partment to exchange them at par for coin or
bullion.
The act of May 31, 173, already referred
to, provides that when United States notes
are redeemed or received in the treasury un
der any law, from any source whatever, and
shall belong to the United States, they shall
not be retired, canceled or destroyed, but
shall be reissued and paid out again, and
kept in circulation.
The power to reissue United States notes
was conferred by section 3579, revised
statutes, and was not limited by the resump
tion act. As this, however, was questioned,
congress wisely removed the doubt.
Notes redeemed are like other notes re
ceived into the treasury. Payments of them
can be mado only in const queue? of a; pro
priationa made by law, cr for tue purchase of
bullion, or for the refunding of the public
debt.
The current receipts from revenue aie suf
ficent to meet the current expenditures as
well as the accruing iuter.:t on t!i public,
debt. Authority is conferred by the refund
ing act to redem six per cent, bonds as tht-y
become red. . unable, by the proceeds of the
sale of bonds L- aring a lower rate of interest.
The Uni'.i-d States notes ledeemed under the
resumption act are, therefor-, the principal
mars provided tor the purchase ot bullion
or coin wuh which to n.aiutaia resumption,
but should only be paid out when they can
be used to replace an tqual amount ot coin
withdrawn from the resumption fund. They
mv. it is true, be used tor cuiront purposes
like ctuer money, but when so used their
pluce is filled ly money recc.ved from taxes
orother soutves ct revenue.
Iu uaily business, no- distinction need be
made l.etwei u moneys from whatever source
received, but they may properly bs applied
to any of t'ao purposes authorized by law.
20 doubt coin liabii-.t't'S, such as interest or
principal of the public de'ot.will be ordinarily
paid ar.d wiihngty leceivel in United States
no'os. but, wtien demanded, such payments
will be madein coin; and United States notes
and cmu will bo used in the purchase ot
Lulii-n. Tois method ha already been
adorted ia Colorado and Noith Carolina,
and urrancemeots :ne being perfected to
purchase bullion in this way in all the mm
me? rej.Mous of the United States.
By the act approved June 8, 1578, the
secretary of trie treury is authoriz--d to con
stitute any KupcrinN-udeat of a mint or as-sayc-r
ct any sis-ay ctiice an assistant treasurer
of the United Stales to receive gold coin or
bullion on deposit, by the legislative ap
propriation bill approved July 19, 1873, the
secivtaiy of the treasury is authorized to
i sue coin certificates in payment to deposi
tors ot bullion :.t the several mints and assay
cilices ot toe United Slates. Th.se provis
ions, intended to secure to the producers of
tui:i.:i mo: speedy payment, will necessarily
brin.r into the mints und treasury the great
body of the precious metals mined in the
United States, and will teud greatly to the
c.:y aud steady supply of bullion tor coinage.
United States uotes, when at par with com,
will be readily received for bullion
ins'ead of coin rtiticatt s, and with treat
a ivantago and convenience to the producers
Depo.-itsot Cjin in tue treasury vilt.no doubt,
continue to be made utter Ihe urst ot Janu
ary, as li 'retctcra. JSjth geld and silver
c:i', trcm its weight aud bu k, will naturally
ek sue n a sale deposit, tin : nates redeem
able in coin, Irom Iheir superior convenience,
witlb-' circulated instead. After resumption
the d stioction between coin and United
Slates notes should be, as far as practicabl
abandoned in tin: curr-ct affairs of the gov- !
e,nm-ct; aud therefore no coin certificates
should he issued except where expressly re
quired by the provisions of the law, as in the
case of s-.iver certificates. The gold certifi
cates hith. rto i-.-tied by virtue of Uia discre
tion couterr -il upon ti.e pi-creiury will not be
i.-sued atter th? hrft of Ji r.uary next. The
The necessity tor them during a suspension of
specie payments is obvious, but no longer ex
is:s vhen by 1 iw every United Stntes note is,
in effect, a coin certificate. The only pur
pose that could be subserv- d by their issue
hereafter would be to enable persons to con
vert their notes into coin certificates,
and thus contract the currency and
hoard gold in the vaults of the treas
ury without the inconvenience or risk
of its custody. For convenience United States
notes of the same denomination as the larger
coin certiti.iates will be ls.-ued.
By f xi.stir.ij law eu-toms duties and the
interest of the public debt are payable in
c m, and n portion of the duties was speci
fically piede.e.1 lis a special fund for the pay
ment ot the interest, thus making tone pro
vision dependent v,pn the ether. As we
cannot, with due regard to the public hnoor,
repeal the obligation to pay coin, we ought
not to impair or repeal the means provided
to procure coiu. When, happily, our notes
are equal to coin, they will be accepted as
coin, both by tbe public creditor and by the
government; but tnis acceptance should be
left to tha option of tiia respective parties,
and the legal right on both sides to demand
coin should be pieserved inviolate.
The secretary is of the opinion that a
change cf the law is cot necessary to author
ize this departaient to receive United States
note3 for eust:ms duties on and after the
first day of January, 1879, while they are re
deemable and are redeemed on demand in
coin. After resumption it would seem a
useless inconvenience to require pajment of
such duties in coin rather than in United
States notes. The resumption act, by clear
implication, so far modifies previous laws
as to permit payments m United States
notes as well as in coin. The provis
ion for coin payments was made in the
midst of war when the notes were
depreciated and the public nece.-si-ties
required an assured revenue in
coin to support the public credit. This alone
justified the refusal of thegovernment to take
its own notes fcr the taxes levied by it. It
has now definitel y assumed to pay these notes
in coin, and this necessarily implies the re
ceipt of thsse notes as coin. To refuse them
is only to invite their presentation for coin.
Any ether construction would require the
notes to be presented to tha assistant treas
urer in New York for coiu, and if used in the
purchase of bonds, to t-9 returned to the
sami oliicer. or, if used for the payment of
cuotoms duties, to be carried to the collector
of customs, who mu.-t daily deposit in the
tie isury all money received by him. It is
not lo be assumed that the law requires this
iadui?ct and inconvenient process atter the
uotes aro redeemable in coin on demand of
the bold.r. They are then at a parity with
coin, and both should ba received inJiscrimi
nte:y If United States notes are received for
duties at the pert of New Yrlr, tLoy sUonid
be received for ihe same purpose in all other
ports of t;:e United States, or aa unconstitu
tional pre.'tT-'nco would be given to that poit
over other torts. If tbis privilege is denied
to the cit:z!ns of ether ports, they could make
such ue ot th'-se cot-s only by transporting
th-in to New York and transporting the coiu
to their hemes for payment; and all this not
only without b?nc2; t ) the government, but
with a loss in returning the coin again to
New Yoi k, w here it is required tor redemp
tion purpoe5.
Tne oiv.vision in ihe law for redemption in
New York was believed to b practical re
demption iu all parts cf toe United States.
Actual redemption was confined to a 6ing!e
place from the necessity of maintaining only
oce coin reserve and where the coin could be
easily accumulated and kept.
With this view of the resumption act, the
secretaiy will feel it to be his duty, unless
congress otherwise provides, to direct that
alter the first day of January next, and while
Uuited States notes are redeemed at the
treasury, tney are received tae same as coin
by the officers of this department in all pay
ments in ail parts cf the United Stntes.
If auy further provision of Jaw is deemed
necessary by congress to author ze the receipt
of Uuited States notes lor customs dues or
lor bonds, the secretary respectfully submits
that this authority should continue only
while the cotes nre redeemed iu coin. How
ever desirable continuous resumption may be,
nud however confident we may feel in its
inaintenano, yet the experience of many
nations lias proven that it may be impossible
in periods of great emergency. Iu such
event3 the public faith demands that the
customs duties shall be collected in coin and
paid to the public creditors, and this pledge
should never be violated or oar ability to per
form it endangered.
Heretofore the treasury, in the disburse
ment of currency, hus paid out bills ot any
denomination desired. In this way the num
ber of bills of a l-.'ss denomination than five
dollars is determined b3- the demand for
them. Such would nppear to be the true
policy after the first of January. Jt has been
urged that, with a view to place in circula
tion silver coins, no bills of less than five dol
lars should be issued. It would seem to bi
more jut and expedient not to force any
form of money upon a public creditor, but to
give him the option of the kind and denomi
nation. The convenience of the public, in
this respect, Ehould be consulted. The only
way by which moneys of different kinds and
intrinsic values can be maintained in circu
lation r.t par with each other is by the ability,
when one kind is in excess, to readily ex
change it for the other. This principle is applicable-
to coin as well an to pap:-r money.
In this v.-ay the largest amount of money cf
d:ff--reut kinds can be maintained at par, the
different purposes for which each is issued
making a demand for it. The refusal or
neglect to maintain this species of redemp
tion inevitably effects the exclusion from cir-
! culation of the most valuable, whico, there
Iter, becomes a commodity, bought and sold
at a premium.
When the redemption act passed, gold
was the only coin which by law was a
legal tender in payment of ail debts. That
act contemplated resumption in gold coin
oaly. No silver coin of full legal tender
could then be lawfully iisued. The only
silver coin provided was fractional coin,
which vas a legal teuder for five dollars only.
Tae a.t improved February 28, 187S, made a
very important change in our coinage system.
Tne silver dollar provided for was made a
ieiial tender for all debts, public and private,
exjept wiiere otherwise expressly stipulated
in tii-; contract. The amount of this coin
issu .-d will more properly be stated hereafter,
but its tf-ct upou the problem of resumption
should lie here c-onidereJ.
The law itself clearly thows that the silver
dollar was not to supersede the gold dollar;
cor did congress propose to adopt the sirg'.e
standard of silver, bat ouly tocteate a b me
tallic standard ot silver and gold, of iqail
valuiande qu ;1 jiurcba.iiuir power. CocpieMi,
tli refor-, limited th o am luut of Bilver dollars
tj b.; coined tj not less than two milh )i.s nor
more tl'.an four millions per niqutb, bu: did
cot limit, lhe a.uroun; amount nor the
pei i id of time diiun.j which th:s coinage
shooid cort'na-'. The mirket vaiu; ct the
silver in the doll or, at thc-date of the pussfg
ot tho act, was 'J i' i c -its :a gold com. Now
it is about 8 3 ceata ia gjld coin. If it was
in'eidvd bv congress ti adopt th 6i!ver
instead of the goll standard, the
aiuca.it provide : lor u totally inadequate for
the purpose. Eu; "leu-.e, int oniy in this
country, but in European countries,
estatilisuel that a certain cmount of silver
coin may be maintained in circulation at par
wild gold, thou,;ii ot I .is intrinsic bullion
value. It was, no Joaot, the intention of
conf.-ress to provide a coin in silver which
wouid anwer a multitude of the purposes of
business life, witnout b.'cishiag from circu
lation the established gold coin cf the coun
try. To accomplish tills it is indispensable
either that the silver coin be limited in
amount, or that its bullion value be equal to
that of Lhe gold dollar. If not, its use wil
be limited to domestic purposes. It cannot
be exported except at its commercial value as
bullion. If issued in excess of demands for
domestic purposes, it will necessanlly fall in
ma-ket value, and, by a weli-known principle
ot finance, will become the sole coin standard
of value. Go! J will be either hoarded or ex
ported. When two currencies, both legal,
are authoriz-d without limit, the cheaper
alone will circulate. if, however, the issue
ot the silver dollars is limited to an amount
demanded for circulation, there will be no
depreciation, and their convenient use will
ke-p tnem tt par with gold, as fractional
siiv.-r coin, issu -d under the act approved
February 21, 1853, was kept at par with gold.
The amount of such coin that can thus be
maintained at par with gold cannot be fairly
sted until resunption is accomplished. As ', to
yet paper money has been depreciated, and t public.
lver dollars being receivable for customs i The c uly innchUe ctiof.-noJ bv 11. is sys
dups, have naturally not entered into general ' tern, tiiat cannot be fnvly enjoyed by private
circulation, but have returned to the treasu- j bonti rs under Stale Uw.is ti.; rnwvr .o issue
ry iu payment of such du.-s, and triiis the '
only effect of the attempt of the depurtm-nt i
to circulate them has been lo dim nish the
gold revenue. Atter resumption these coins
will circulate in considerable mini for small
payments. To the extent tbat such demand
will give employment to silver dollars lueir
use will be an aid to resumption rather than
a hindrance, but it issued in excess c f such
demand they will at once tend to displace
gold and become the sole standard, and grad
ually, as they increase in numlxr, will fall to
their value as bullion. Even tii- fear or sus
picion of such an excess lend t o banish gold,
and, if well established, will cause a continu
ous drain or gold until imperative necessity
will compel resumption in silver alone. The
serious effect of suchradicd chunae in ur
standards cf value cannot be exagsrerated ;
and its possibility will greatly disturb confi
dence in resumption, and limy make nu-cess i
ry largir reserves and further sales of bonds.
The secretary, tlieref ir- earnestly invokes
the att. nt ou of congress to this sul j ct, with a
view that either during the present or th next
sesdon theamountof silverdollarstobe issued
be limited, or their ratio to gold f . r coin n
purposes be changed. Gold and silver have
varied in value from time to time in the his
tory of nations, and laws have been passed
to meet this changmg value, lo cur couutry.
by the act of April 'J, Ii'J, the ratio b-.-twivn
them Wits fixed at. one of gold to lilteen of
stiver. By act of June 2i, 1 ?3l, tue ratio
was changed to one Ot gold to sixteen of sil
ver. For more than a century the market
value of tbe two metals had varied, between
th--Bd two ratios, mainly rtstiug ut that fix :d
by the Latin nations, of one to fifteen and a
hull. But we cannot overlook the fact teat
within a few years, from causes frequently
di.cuised in congress, a gr at change has
occurred iu the relative value of th- two
metals. It would seem to be expedient to
recognize this controlling fac' one fiat no j
nation alone can change by a careful re
adjustment of the legal rat'o for coinage of
one to sixteen, so as to conform to the rela
tive market values ot the two metals. The
ratios heretofore fix-il were alwavs made
with that view, and, when made, did confoi m
as near as might be. Now that tbe produc
tion and use of the two metals have
greatly changed in relative value, a
corresponding change must be made
in tne coinage ratio, lhere is no
peculiar f irce or sanction in the present ratio
that should make us hesitate to adopt an
other, when, in the markets of the world, it
is proven that such ratio is not now tue tru-e
one. The addition of one-tenth or one
eighth to the thickness of the silver dollar
would scarcely be peeeived as an lncoveui
ence by the holder, but would inspire confi
dence, and add greatly to its circulation.
As prices are now baed oa United States
notes at par with gold, no disturbance ot
values would result from the change.
It appears lrom the recent conference ut
Paris, invited by us, that other cations will
not join with us in fixing an international
ratio, and that each country must adapt its
laws to its own policy. The tendeucy r.t late
among commercial cations is to the adoption
of a single standard of gold and the l-sue of
silver lor fractional coin. We may, by ig
noring this tendency, give temporarily-increased
value to the stores of silver held in
Geimany and France until our market ab
sorbs them, but by adopting a silver st .ndard
as nearly equal to gold as practicable, we
make a raaiketfor our large production of
silver, and furnish a full, honest dollar that
will be hoarded, transported or circulated,
without disparagement or reproach.
It is reste.ttully submitted that the United
States, already r.o largely interested in trade
with all parts of the world, and becoming by its
population, wealth, commercs and produc
tions, a leading member of the family of na
tions, should not adopt a standard of less in
trinsic value than other commercial nat:cns.
Alike interested in silver and gold, ?.s the
great producing country of both, it should
com them at such a ratio and on such con
ditions ai will secure tho largest use and cir
culation of both metals without displacing
either. Gold must necessarily be the stan- j
dard of vn'ue in great transactions, from its
greater relative valup, but it is not capable of i
the division required for small transactions;
while silver is indispensable for a multitude
of daily wants, and is too buiky for use in
tha larger transactions of business, and the
cost of its transportation for long distances
would greatly increase the present rates of
exchange. It would, therefore, seem to be
the host policy for the present to limit the
aggregate issue of our silver dollars, based
on the ratio of sixteen to one, to such sums
as can clearly be maintained at par with
gold, until the price of silver in the
market shall assume a deli ute ratio to gold,
when that ratio should be adopted, and our
coins made to conform to it; and tbe secre
tary respectfully recommends that he be
authorised to discontinue the coinage of the
silver dollar when the amount outstanding
shall exceed fitly million dollars.
The secretary deems it proper to state that
in the meantime, in the execution of the law
as it now stands, he will teel it to be bis duty
to redeem all Un ted States notes presented
on and atter January 1st, ne-xt, at tne ctfice of
the assistant treasurer of the United States
in the city ot New York, in sums of not less
than fifty dollars, with either gold or silver
coin, as desired by the holder, but reserving
the legal option of the government, an ! to
pay out United States notes for all other de
mands on the treasury, exit-pt when coin is
demanded on coin liabilities.
It is bis duty as an executive officer to frank
ly state Lis opinions, so that if he is in error
congress may prescribe such a policy as is best
for the public interest.
FUNDING.
The amonnt of lour per cent, bonds sold
duriug the present year, prior to Noveui'ev-r
23J, is $100,270,900, of which 91.770,9eJ
were sold under the refunding act, approved
July 14. 1370. Six per cent, bonds, com
monly kuown as five-twenties, to an equal
amount, have been redeemed, or wid be re
deemed as calls mature. This beneficial pro
cess was greatly retarded by the require
ment of the law tbat subscriptions must be
paid in coin, the inconvenience of obtaining
which, to the great body of the people cut
side of the large cities, deterred many sales.
This will not affect sales atter resumption,
when bonds can be paid for with United
States notes. The large absorption cf United
States securities in the American market, by
reason of their return from Europe, together
with the sale of four aud a half per cent,
bonds for resumption purposes, tended to re
tard the sale of four per cent, bonds. As
from the best advices, not more thaa $i00,
tKX),000 of United States bonds nre now held
out cf the country, it may be fairly anticipat
ed that the sale ot four per cent, bauds, Lcie
a'.ter, wili largely increase.
Prior to May, 1877, United States bonds
were mainly sold through an association of
bankers. Experience proves that under the
present plan of .selling to all subscribers, on
terms fixed by public advertisement, Liioneh
the aggregate ol sales may be less, their dis
tribution is more satisfactory. Under a
popular loan the interest is paid at Lome,
and the investment is available at all tune.-,
without loss, to meet the needs of the holder.
Tnis policy has been carefully fostered by
other nations, and should be specially so in
ours, where every citizen equady participates
in tho government of bis couutry. The
holding of these bonds at home, in small
sums well distributed, is of great importance
in enlisting popular interest in our
national credit, and in encouraging
habits of thrift, and such holding
in the country is far more stable aud
less likely to disturb the market ttan it would
be ia cities or by corporation, where the
bonds can be promptly sold in quantifies.
The three-months public notice required
by the fourth section of the refunding act to
te given to thu
holders of the five twenty
bonds to be redeemed, necessarily involves a
loss to the government by the payment of
double interest during that time. The no
tice should not be given until subscriptions
are mad j or are reasonably certain to ce
made. When they are made and the money
is paid into the treasury, whether it is kept
there idle during tbe three months or depos
ited with national banks under existing law,
the government not onlv pays inter st ca
both classes of bonds during the ninety days, :
but, if the 6ales are large, the hoarding of i
large sums may disturb tha market. Undtr j
existing law this is unavoidable; and to taiti- I
eate it the secretary deemed it expedient !
during the last summer to make calls in an- j
ticipation of subscriptions, but this, though i
legal, might, in cases of failure of subscrip-
lions, embarrass the government m paying
called bonds. The long notice if quired by
law is not necessary in the interest of the
bolder of the bonds, for, as the calls aie muda
by public notice and the bends are indicated
and specified by class, date, and cumber, in
the order of their numbers and issue, be by
ordinary diligence can know beforehand when
his bonds in due course will probably be
ca'led, and will not be taken by surprise.
The secretary therefore recommends that
the notice to be given for called bonis be, at
his discretion, cot less taan ten diys cor
more than three months. In this way ha
will be able largely to avoid the payment of
double interest, as well lis l'a temporary con
traction of the cuiieccy, and may fix the
maturity of the c ill at a lime when the inter
est of the called bonds becomes due and pay
able. NATIONAL BANKS,
