t 4r THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
President Roosevelts last annual
message to the Congress is absolute
ly free i from the preaching that has
filled so many of his previous State
V papers Its a plain straight for
ward statement of facts filled with
Highly < important recommendations
for action by the House and Senate
The policies advocated are most of
a them favored by the Democratic par =
ty and by the progressive wing of the
tYRepublican
Republican party Ifany of the
measuers are passed at this session
iiwwil have to be with the aid of
Democratic votes
i Roosevelt again reiterates his lies
H
lief that the great corporations en
gaged in interstate business and es
pecially the railroads can only be
r effectually controlled by the national
government The Sherman antitrust
law should be amended or a new law
substituted which should not forbid
alt combinations good or bad but
L should permit combinations which
vare in the interest of the public but
I should at the same time give to some
agencY o I the national i government
fullpQwerfof control and supervision
overr them Entire publicity should
be secured in all matters which the
1 public has a right to know
The railways should be put com
I S pletely under the interstate commerce
j comtiiissioh which should have the
S right rjto supervise and control the is
suance + of securities as well as over
the raising and lowering of rates
Asr r 9 gard rates this power should
be gummary The interests of the
shatfeholcletfs employees and of the
shippers should all be guarded as
against one another t
Corporate finances must be super
° vised so as to make it far snfer than
r at present for theman ofsmall
meansio invest his money in stocks
c Stock b should be prohibited
v and stock gambling so far as is pos
sibl6 discouraged
A proper employers liability law
should be passed The Judges of the
t i United States beginning with the Su
preme Court should have their salar
ies doubled
Provision should be made that no
injunction or temporary restraining
order issue from the courts otherwise
than on notice except where irrepar
r
able injury would otherwise result
and in such case a hearing on the
merits ° of the order should be had
within a short fixed period and if not
< then continued after hearing it
s i should forthwith lapse <
i The forests of the country must be
saved for they constitute the first
> and most important element in the
conservation of the natural resources
of the country

5 Our inland waterways should be
looked after not in the present slip
shod way but by a comprehensive
and farseeing plan y A permanent

w f
thQ work of all the government de
partments relating to waterways and
to frame and supervise the execution
ofa compiehensive plan should be
provided
f
Postal savings banks are now in
operation inpractically all the great
civilized countries and should be
adopted bV the United States The
parcel post should be extended on
the rural routes The establishment
of a local parcel post on rural routes
would be to the mutual benefit of
the farmer and the country store
keeper and it is desirable that the
routes serving more than 15000
000000 people should be utilized xto
the fullest practiable extent <
The v ciyil service law should
he extended to the census bu
reams g Statehood should be granted
Arizona arid New Mexico The ocean
mail act should be amended so that
satisfactory American ocean mail
lines to South America Asia the
Philippines and Australasia may be
extended Four battleships should be
provided for and the general board
of the Navy should be by law turned
into a general staff so that the Navy
should be as efficiently governed as
is the Army under the present law
These are in the main the chief
recommendations of the President
In passing he charges the Congress
with crippling the secret service The
President says that an amendment I
passed by it which provided that
there should be no detail from the
secret service and no transfer there
from was of benefit to no one except
to criminals It seriously hampers
the government in the detection of
crime and the sec justicea
He continues the chief argument
in favor of the provision was that
the Congressmen did not themselves
wish to be investigated by secret ser
vice men Very little of such investi
gation has been done in the past but
it is true that the work of the secret
service agents was partly responsible I
for the indictment and ponviction ofi
a Senator and a Congressman for
land fraud in Oreeon Ido not be
lieve that it is in the public interest
to protect riminals in any branch of
the government service and exact
ly as we have again and
yearsb
prosecuted and convicted such cram
inals who were in the executive
branch of the government we should
be given ample means to prosecute
them if found in the legislative
branch
branchThis is straight from the shoulder
and ought to make some Congress
men situ p and take notice
In foreign affairs President Roose
velt says We have behaved and are
behaving toward other nations as in
private life an honorable man
would behave toward his fellows
He commends the work on the
Panama Canal which is a model for
all work of the kind No task of
such magnitude has ever before been
undertaken by any Nation and no
task of the kind has ever been better
performed
Real J ogress toward selfgovern
men has been made jh the Philippine
Islands but no one can prophesy the
exact date when it will be wise to
consider independence as a fixed and
I
definite policy
