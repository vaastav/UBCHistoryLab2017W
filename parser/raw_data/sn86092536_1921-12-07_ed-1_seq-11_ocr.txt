enclosed car that combines the snugness and intimacy of the
Coupe with the carrying capacity of the Sedan.
The new five-passenger 6-66 Coupe was built expressly to
meet this need. That this clever creation completely realized
a wide-spread desire is proved by its sweeping success. Almost
over night the Paige five-passenger Coupe became the most
popular enclosed model that has ever left a shop where cars
of the enclosed type have been a specialty for more than
a decade. V.'

?- qualities?you will find it unique in the arrangement of space
*r and also one of the handsomest and most distinctive cars
1 that ever rolled up your avenue. ^

Paige 6-66 which is a guarantee of super-power as well as '
of extreme flexibility. In this car you will be master of both
highway and traffic.
