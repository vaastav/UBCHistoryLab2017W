HIGH COST OF LIVING.
Montana Daily Record: That the
demand of the switchmen on 1he
northwestern roads for an increase of
pay from $2.70 a day of ten hours to
$3.30, or to put it in round numbers,
from $81 to $99 a month, is not un
reasonable, taking the advance of liv
ing cost in consideration, is tacitly
acknowledged in the last Weekly
Financial Review of J. S. Bache & Co.,
the New York bankers. It was three
years ago the northwestern railroads
granted the switchmen an increase in
pay. Their principal reason for now
refusing the demands of the switch
men is because an advance was grant
ed in 1896 and also because no reduc
tion was made during the time of the
dull business that came an 1907 and
1908.
That the position of the railway
managers is not a tenable one can be
easily shown. The switchmen ask for
an advance of a little more than 24
per cent in the monthly pay. That
sounds large, but when one considers
that the living cost has risen in the
last 18 months 44 per cent, and this
excludes the rise in meat from con
sideration, it will be conceded the de
mand is not an unreasonable one.
This percentage of increase in the
cost of living is not the calculation of
this paper, but is based on the figures
given by Bache & Co., as follows:
Butter has risen in price 40 per
cent in the last eighteen months,
cheese 30 per cent, eegs 100 per cent,
wheat and coffe 15 per cent, flour 20
per cent, lard and pork 55 per cent.
Employment of labor has become
general with wages about normal.
The working people, because of high
cost of living, have saved little. As
a rule, every dollar goes for expenses.
If you interview these classes you
will find they are not happy. "These
may be good times," they say, "but it
doesn't show in ours. We are work
ing as hard as ever just for a living."
One finds much dissatisfaction among
•them. The spirit of unrest is grow
ing. This spirit is the precursor of
strikes The switchmen of the north
west 'have crystallized the situation
into action. All the northwest
crippled by it. Thousands of freight
handlers and teamsters are losing
time by reason of the freight block
ade in the terminal towns. A con
tinuance will throw additional thou
sands out of work. Many lines of
industry are crippled. All the flour
mills in Minneapolis are the distribut
ing points for the entire northwest.
The effect of the stopping of freight
carrying will be felt in the states of
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, North
and South Dakota, Montana, Idaho
.Montana, the beehive of the mines
and smelting operations, will feel it
most.
In the list given above are six ar
tkles that make up the daily living
of the majority of the people. The
total increase in their cost in 18
months is 265 per cent, or an average
of something over 44 per cent.
It must not be forgot, either, that
the railroads cannot plead dull and
unprofitable business as a reason f<
their refusal. Their reports sho
constantly increasing earnings and
while recent figures on freight earn
ings are not at hand, there is some
thing on passenger earnings. Freight
earnings will make a better showing,
because many of the states have enact
ed laws within three years whic!
have reduced the profits of the rail
roads in the carrying of passengers
A report having to do with twelve
railroads which operate principally in
states where enforced reduced pas
senger rates are in effect, and which
include the Burlington, Great Nor
them, Union Pacific, Southern aP
cific, St. Paul and Northern Pacific;
shows that the revenue of these
twelv roads in 1906 was in round
in
numbers $167,000,000, while for 1909150
the revenue is given at $196,000,000,
an increase of $29,000,000.
THE ARROGANCE OF JOHN D.
Butte News: John D. Arohbold,
manager of the political department
of the Standard Oil, famous as a
strategist, financier and an effective
writer of letters, is displeased at the
dissolution of the Standard Oil trust.
The United States court said the
Standard was conducting its business
in violation of the Sherman anti
trust law, and Mr. Arohbold, not
deeming it diplomatic or wise to crit
icise the court, suggests that this law
be repealed. Other trusts have suf
fered because Roosevelt insisted upon
the enforcement of the Sherman
measure, but they "took their measure
gracefully." Not so with the Stand
ard. The law must be repealed. Mi.
Archbold, we have no doubt, having
read the decision, summoned his
stenographer and dictated a score of
letters somewhat along this line: "My
Dear Senator: The Sherman anti
trust law must be repealed. I don't
like it. Take it up with Aldrich and
Cannon and let me hear from you at
once. Yours, John D."
Npthing can exceed the arrogance
of the man. It typifies the methods
of the trust; it illustrates its tre
mendous power. Wlhat other litigant
in the United States would 'have the
temerity to make a suggestion of this
character? Now they are going to
test the constitutionality of the Sher
an act. If the supreme court of the
United States 'holds it constitutional,
we may expect Archbold to suggest
that the constitution be amended.
But it must not be assumed that
the Rockefellers and Archbold are
blind to the magnitude of the decision.
Attorney General Wickersham does
not exaggerate wihen he pronounces
one of the most ^important ever
anded down by an American court.
It defines vital principles long in dis
pute. It sweeps away ambiguities and
technicalities and establishes a distort
ed and discredited statute in its in
tegrity. It accepts the ordinary
meaning of every word of the Sher
man law, but construes every clause
according to its spirit as,well as its
letter. It places under the ban of
the court the whole scheme and sys
tem of monopolistic, centralized con
trol of business, and all the methods
by which monopoly has been created
and maintained are declared spe
cifically to be violations of law and
violations, also, of good public policy.
Yet, so dear and so profoundi is the
reasoning of the opinion, that, even
among corporation lawyers, no doubt
expressed t'hat these judges have
aid down the law of the land, and it
expected as virtually a certainty that
their conclusions will be affirmed by
supreme court.
It strikes the hardest blow ever iiit
Standard Oil, first and worst and
most powerful of all the trusts. Not
only are a majority of the subsidiary
companies of the Standard Oil Com
pany of New Jersey directed to dis
associate themselves from the parent
concern in every way, but they are
forbidden to allow any representative
of that company to vote any of thetr
stock and forbidden to make any pay
ments of dividends upon stock owned
by the parent company or to do bus
iness with it in any way.
It is a long step forward toward
the proper adjustment of commerce
and restriction of privileges in the
United Stats. It is a triumph of right
over might, of the people over the
monopolistic combinations which be
lieed t'hemseles greater than the laws
of the nation.

THE COST IS SWELLING.
Chief Engineer Goethals of the
Panama Canal Commission, in his
latest report, says that it will cost
$375,000,000 to dag the big ditch. This
just $231,000,000 more than the
cost estimated when the work was
begun in 1902. At the present rate
of increase, the ultimate cost will go
above the half billion mark and might
possibly reach the round sum of one
billion, as was predicted by many ex
perts at the beginning.
That's a rather sizable sum. Count
ing our population at one hundred
million, wthich it isn't, every man
woman and child in the nation has
ten dollar interest in the big ditch
and doubtless many of them would be
willing to sell out right now for less
than par. Numerous reasons are ad
vanced for Phis big increase. Since
the origina calculations were made
wages and the cost of material have
risen. Prosperity in this country and
the unsavory reputation of the Isth
mus with respect to disease compelled
t'he adoption of a wage scale from 30
to 60 per cent higher than prevail
ing rates here. Moreover, the eight
hour law was applied. Therefore unit
prices were materially advanced
Changes in the plans increased the
quantity of work to be done. Ad
ditional and more thorough surveys
enabled the Commision to make the
revised estimate which was submitted
to congress in February last. This
showed that there was needed nearly
per cent more '»ork than the orig
inal estimate called for, and that the
unit prices had advanced about 20
per cent. And so the cost of engi
neering and construction rose to
$297,766,000, and the addition of the
purchase money, with the cost of san
itation and civil government, made
the total $375,200,000. The maximum
number of unskilled laborers em
ployed, 33,699, was reached on April
28. The number of those from Europe
has declined, owing mainly to Spain's
prohibition of emigration to the Isth
mus. Tivoli hotel, the nineteen messes
and the twenty-one kitchens have
been conducted at a profit; the seven
teen hotels along the line at a loss
Health statistics show an improve
ment, the sick rate falling from 23.S5
to 23.49 per thousand, and t'he death
rate (with an average number of
44.261 names on the payroll) from
18.32 to 11.97. There were no cases
of yellow fever or plague originating
on the Isthmus. The schools have
been reorganized and carefully grad
ed. Besides the two high schools, one
at Culebra and the o-ther at Christohal,
there are twelve for whites, with 622
pupils, and seventeen for colored
children, with 1,073. At Gatun the
builders are nearly ready for the con
crete and masonry work on the great
locks. President Taft is confident

THE MESSAGE.
For the reason that it would oc
cupy over two-thirds of the space
which the Democrat reserves for
reading matter and for the further
reason that not one out of one hun
dred of our readers would take the
trouble to go through with it any
way, we did not publish the presi
dent's message this week. On an
other page we give a synopsis which
will be sufficient for all practical pur
poses.
The message is remarkable chiefly
for what it does not contain. Cohunns
are devoted to our relations with
foreign countries, matters about
wihich the average man of this coun
try does not care a straw unless we
are about to get into a shindy with
some foreign prince or potentate: As
a contemporary has said, President
Taft could have covered the entire
foreign question fully by saying that
we are on "bully" terms with the
whole world', little Nicaragua ex
cepted, and are 'holding our own beau
tifully in the great international draud
naught building rivalry.
The president let slip one sentence
which will meet with a hearty and
unanimous amen from the American
people. He said that living expenses
are much higher than formerly but.
for fear of getting into dangerous
territory, 'hurries along without any
explanation for this increase. He did
not linger long enough to state what
is well-known to all thinking people
hat this increase in the necessities of
life is due to "the best tariff bill ever
passed."
In the matter of message writing,
President Taft has shown himself
quite as verbose but not nearly so in
teresting as his illustrious predecessor,
Mr. Roosevelt. The Rooseveltian mes
sages were usually enlivened with
ufficient fire and brimstone, in some
shape or other, to make t'he people
sit up and take notice. There is ab
solutely nothing to relieve the dead
dullness of the Taft paper. If
they do nothing else this term, phose
members of congress who are com
pelled, through courtesy, to sit and
listen to its reading will have almost
earned their salaries. It is a mar
velous illustration of the meaning of
certain learned gentleman Who said
that words are used to conceal ideas.
After all, presidential messages
count for little. They are supposed
to express the ideas of the executive.
Oft times they do, oft times they
do not. Unless there is firm convic
tion backed by an indomitable deter
miration to have Phe things recom
mended made into laws, these stave
papers are not worth the paper they
arc written on.
As a writer of messages, as in
many other respects, President Taft
leaves much to be desired.
The first number of the Musselshell
Advocate, published at Musselshell
just across the river in Yellowstone
county, was received last week. John
son Brothers are the publishers anil
judging from the first copy, have the
ability and equipment necessary to
get out a first-class country weekly
The town of Musselhell has long been
noted as one of the best trading
points in this part of the state. Sit
uated on the Musselshell river, about
midway between Lewistown and Bill
ings, it was always a favorite stopping
place for passengers who took the
long stage ride between the two larger
cities. If has also been, for many
years, the center of an immense stock
growing country and scores of stock
men and their employes have helped
to swell the volume of business done
at that place. The town took on
boom when the Milwaukee road was
built through and has not yet stopped
growing nor does it show any indica
tions of senile decay or infantile
paralysis. For many miles in every
direction from Musselshell, the land
'has been taken up and thousands of
acres formerly devoted to the grazing
of stock is now being plowed up and
sown in grain. There are also coal
mines, as yet in the state of unde
velopment, not equalled by any black
diamond measures in the west, and
Musselshell will, in the not far distant
future, become a worthy rival of
Roundup as a coal camp. With these
abundant resources, t'he town of Mus
selshell is assured of a future of ever
increasing prosperity and growth in
population. No enterprise will be a
greater factor in the town's develop
ment than a good newspaper. While
contributing to the upbuilding of
Musselshell, the Democrat hopes that
the Advocate may receive the ap
preciation, moral and financial support
which it shall merit.
Secretary MacVeagh. in a recent
public speech, said that the republi
can party has faced about in its atti
tude on Phe tariff and now favors a re
duction all along the line. This brings
up the question first raised by Speaker
Cannon a few weeks ago as to which
wing constitutes the republican party.
If Cummings, LaFollette, Dolliver
and other insurgents form the repub
lican party, the Hon. Secretary's
statement is, at least, partially true.
If, on the other hand, Aldrich, Can
non, Hale, Carter and Pheir kind
make up the republican party, Mr.
MacVeagh was buzzing to hear him
self make a noise. While both wings
claim to be the real thing, the orig
inal package, Phe simon pure article,
unadulterated and undefiled, it does
appear that, judging from the results
of the last congress, the Cannon
Carter-Aldrich bunch is entitled to
the label. _
When President Zelaya, who has
ordered all Americans in Nicaragua
killed, wakes up some morning sud
denly his first impression will be of a
rope with a noose at one end and the
cross arm of the nearest telegraph
pole at the other. His second impres
sion will relate to the scenery of hell.
At any rate, Doctor Cook has man
aged to stir up a pot of discord, doubt
and suspicion such as no other cul
inary artist has ever managed to pro
duce.

ister of the state land office, which
has just been filed with Gov. Edwin
L. Norris and which covers the period

there were no timber or land sales;
since that law was approved only

Meeting of Woman's Club.
The Lewistown Woman's Club met
at the Public Library building o n tht
afternoon of Thursday, Dec. 2nd.
The subject of the club's work this
year is Italy. An unusually interest
ing program was rendered at the
meeting; consisting of a paper on
Naples by Mrs. Pittman, one on Her
culaneum and Pompeii by Mrs. B. C
White, one by Mrs. Lehman on Seis
mic Disturbances, and a reading,
"Drifting," by Mrs. Akins.
Mrs. Hazen, during the two pre
ceding weeks, has collected a large
number of books and periodicals, and
has forwarded them to a community
of new settlers at and near the post
office of Valentine, Montana. These
people were unfortunate, losing their
crops by hail last summer, and will
be glad to receive such reading mat
ter.
