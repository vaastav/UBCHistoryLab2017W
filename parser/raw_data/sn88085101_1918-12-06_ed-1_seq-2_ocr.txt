stated that L. E. Phillips, manager

shipment last week and the entire
consignment was snapped up as soon
as It was unloaded.
THE OROVILLE WEEKLY GAZETTE
0y thl“
OAXITTI FURLUHINO COMPANY
FRANK If. DLLUM, *r. FRANK If. DALLAM.Jr.
Issued at Orovllle, Okanogan County. Waah., Every Friday. fl.fO a roar
Entered at the poetofflce at Ororllle. Washington as second-class matter.
It was supposed that the Influenza
epidemic had passed high water mark
and was walnlng in the state,-and all
restrictions as to public meetings had
been removed. However, during the
past few days the number of new
cases appearing in the cities has
greatly increased and the schools at
Spokane were again closed Monday. It
is also reported that on account of an
Increased number of cases in Seattle
all public meetings and assemblies
have been prohibited in that city.
The disease is very contagious and
wherever if exists it is noticeable that
there is an increase in the number
afflicted after any large gathering of
people. It is a disease of the crowds,
as has been so often stated, and so
long as crowds gather in communities
where the influenza exists Just so long
will the malady continue claiming vic
tims.
The president’s message, road be
fore congress,was a disappaintment as
compared with other of his state pa
pers of recent times. Naturally he
paid a high tribute to the soldiers and
sailors, but he made no concrete sug
gestions as to legislation to cover im
portant questions now confronting the
country. He explained his purpose in
going to Europe to be present at the
peace conference, although the ex
planation does not seem to fully satis
fy many of the members of congress
without regard to party.
President Wilson, accompanied Dy
Lansing, White and Gen. Bliss, his
selected companions as members of
the peace delegation from this country
with the addition of Col. House alrea
dy in France, sailed tor France this
week. The period of his absence is
indefinite, but if he is to remain away
until peace terms are finally agreed
upon and signed he may not return to
this country until in February, as It is
now declared that peace negotiations
may be delayed until that month.
A large number of American troops
are already on their way home from
France, several ship loads having
landed during the past week. Units
will be discharged and shipped home
as rapidly as transportation facilities
will permit. It will require a number
of months, however, to move all the
troops to be discharged, while a large
force will have to be kept in France
for some months until tranquility has
been established. What troops will be
selected to remain in France has not
as yet been determined.
It looks as though the allies were
to make life somewhat miserable for
Willian Hohenzollern, lately better
known as the kaiser. A dispatch from
London states that French, English
and Italian representatives have
reached an agreement ns to the pun
ishment to be Inflicted upon the kaiser
and while the nature of that punish
ment is not made public it is easy to
guess that it is not going to mean a
happy time for that human fiend.
American troops are now in Ger
many for the purpose of holding cer
tain cities, which is in conformity
with the terms of the armistice. The
allies have so distributed large forces
that Germany would And it impossible
to renew hostilities with any hope of
success.
BAX AGAINST PUBLIC MEETINGS.
Word was received at this office by
telephone Wednesday from Okanogan
that the county health office had is
sued another ban against public meet
ings in December and all meetings
scheduled have been called off. When
Walter A. Holt was here Tuesday he
left a notice that a Farmers’ Insti
tute would be held in Orovtlle on the
18th and 19th of December at which
a number of prominent speakers
would be present to address the farm
ers of the surrounding country. He
sends word that the Institute has been
postponed until further notice. The
reason for the new quarantine is that
the Influenza has appeared again in
the county apparently more general
than ever before. There must be
some drastic measures taken to stamp
out the dangerous malady. Probably
the best way would be to quarantine
every house In which the disease ap
pears. The seriousness of the situa
tion should arouse every resident of
the county to the necessity of guard
ing against a further spread of the in
fluenza. A number of citizens of the
county have died from the disease and
it is foolish to take any chances.

OROVILLE LAD IK FRANCE
Monday night E. N. Grubb had a
letter from Joe Hash, who Is with the
161 st Infantry In France, the first
word that the family has had from the
young man In several months. Joe
Hash, with Lawrence Dallam, enlisted
In the 2nd Washington at the time war
was threatened with Mexico, and
spent the summer on the Mexican bor
der, marking time and suffering from
the extreme heat. When war was de
clared with Germany, and the 2nd
Washington was mobilized at Camp
Lewis, Joe again Joined the colors, but
was transferred from Co. B. In which
he had served during the Mexican ex
citement. and was transferred to Co.
M. He sailed with bis regiment, desig
nated as the 161 st when Incorporated
in the national army, ror Franco last
December. The 41st Division, to which
the 161 st was attached, was assigned
to training replacement troops. Most
of the privates of the regiment were
scattered among other regiments at
the front, while the officers tint! non
coms were held to do the training of
fresh men. Joe writes that he was in
the trenches for five days, saw little
fighting but was In'roduced to mat
active little soldier’s enemy, the
cootie. The letter was dated November
3, and the writer then predicted that
the war would be over in a few days-
Joe is now a sergeant. He was
recommended for the officer’s training
camp, but at that time he took his
furlough, made a trip down Into Italy,
and when he returned to the command
the time of appointment had expired.
Of course Joe made a good soldier
but is disappointed that lie "’as not
able to see more active service.
BRITISH COLUMBIA VISITORS.
Last Thursday a party of merry
makers from West Bummcr'.and, re
cruited by a squad bent upon enjoy
ment at Penticton, drove down to Oro
vllle in cars, part'clpated in the
Thanksgiving dance, stopped over in
town all night returning home at
noon last Friday. The visitors tcr
talnly enjoyed their visit and Mine

did all in his power to make their
stay in town pleasmt. The party
joined together in the big dining room
of the hotel Friday tor lunch before
their departure and bad a jolly time
of it, singing a number of songs clos
ing with “America.” Not since the
beginning of the world war has the
town been visited by such a large and
happy company of people from British
Columbia. On their return to Pentic
ton the visitors dropped a note to K.
N. Grubb, bearing the signatures of
the entire party, enclosing IVOO and
stating that “in our excitement on
leaving your Hotel we overlooked
thanking your dining room help for
their courtesy. Please accept en

ELECTRICITY* FOR TONASKET
C. C. Hedger, local manager of the
Okanagon Valley Power company, has
about completed installing an electric
lighting system at Tonasket. The com
pany has a plant on the Methow river
and a line extending all the way up
the valley, supplying service to the
various towns along the route. It
seems rather singular that the com
pany should skid the juice along so
many miles of wire from the Methow
to Tonasket, considering that they
controll one of the best water powers
in the state at the falls of the Slmil-

the Bank of Oroville, went over to
Seattle on business, expecting to be
home Monday evening. He had no
sooner reached Seattle than he was
taken down with the influenza. The
last heard from him was to the eflect
that the case was light and he would
not probably be laid up for any great
length of time. But in the influenza
one can never tell. His friends here
trust that he will escape all compli

in the bank.
