■PRESIDENT DELIVERS A SHORT
ADDRESS TO CONGRESS IN
JOINT BESSION.
ASKS MORE RAILWAY LAWS
jail* for Early Action on Remaining
' Measures of His Program of Settle
' went and Regulation—Other Legis
’ lation That Is Advised.
Washington, Dec. 5. —President Wil
son's message, delivered to congress
In Joint session today, was brief and
to the point. The president said:
Gentlemen of the Congress:
, In fulfilling at this time the duty laid
nj>on me by' the Constitution of com
niunicating to you from time to time
Information of the state of the Union
and recommending to your considera
tion such legislative measures as may
be .judged necessary and expedient I
'-shall continue the practice, which 1
Hope has been acceptable to you, of
leaving to the reports of the several
heads of the executive departments the
elaboration of the detailed needs of
the public service and confine myself
to those matters of more general pub
lic policy with which it peems neces
sary and feasible to deal at the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
gestions as few as possible; but there
Were some things left undone at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which it seems
necessary in the interest of the public
to do at once.
In the first place, it seems to me im
peratively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and action
Should be accorded the remaining
measures of the program of settle
ment and regulation which I had occa
sion to recommend to you at the close
•f your last session in view of the pub
lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom
modated difficulties which then existed,
nnd which still unhappily continue to
exist, between the railroads of the
country and their locomotive engineers,
conductors, and trainmen.
, Railway Troubles First.
I then recommended:
First, immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
In the bill recently passed by the house
Of representatives and now awaiting
action by the senate; in order that the
commission may be enabled to deal
With the many great and various duties
•now devolving upon it with a prompt
ness and thoroughness which are, with
Its present constitution and means of
action, practically impossible.
Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
Of work and of wages in the employ
ment of all railway employees who are
actually engaged in the work of oper
ating trains in interstate transporta
tion.
Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re-'
cults in experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour day in railway trans
portation alike for the men and for
the railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration by the in
terstate commerce commission of an
Increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by the adoption of the eight
hour day and which have not been off
set by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the facts dis
closed Justify the Increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation, and arbitration
of such controversies as the present
by adding to it a provision that, in case
the methods of accommodation now
provided for should fail, a full public
Investigation of the merits of every
auch dispute shall be instituted and
Completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted.
And, sixth, the lodgment in the
hands of the executive of the power.
In case of military necessity, to take
Control of such portions and such roil
ing stock of the railroads of the coun-
try as may be required for military
■Be and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft into
the military service of the United
States such train crews and adminis
trative officials as the circumstances
acquire for their safe and efficient use.
Renew* Hi* Recommendations.
The second and third of these rec-
Cmmendations the congress Immediate
ly acted on: It established the eight
hour day as the legal basis of work
and wages’ln train service and it au
thorized the appointment of a com
mission to observe and report upon the
practical results, deeming these the
measures most Immediately needed;
hut It postponed action upon the other
The Yfear* After Fifty.
When men pass the half-century
mark, they usually regard themselves
■8 going down hill.
A discovery which I made by talking
with those who were really living In
•he latter period was that many of
them regarded theirVxperieuce of life
In the advancing years as the best pari
of the whole. It did not appear on
the surface: it was not uny marked
ouccess before the world, nnd it was
not uppen! perhaps, to those in the
• l ot many of nwiple
suggestions until hn opportunity should
be offered for a more deliberate con
sideration of them. The fourth rec
ommendation I do not deem It neces
sary to renew. The power of the In
terstate commerce commission to grant
an Increase of rates on the ground re
ferred to is Indisputably clear nnd a
recommendation by the congress with
regard to such a matter might seem to
draw In question the scope of the com
mission’s authority or its Inciinatidn to
do justice when there is no reason to
doubt either.
The other suggestions—the Increase
in the Interstate commerce commis
sion’s membership and in its facilities
for performing its manifold duties, the
provision for full public investigation
and assessment of Industrial disputes,
and the grant to the executive of the
power to control and operate the rail
ways when necessary in time of war
or other like public necessity—l now
very earnestly renew.
. The necessity for such legislation is
manifest and pressing. Those who have
intrusted us with the responsibility
and duty of serving and safeguarding
them in such matters would find It
hard, I believe, to .excuse a failure' to
act upon these grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement of action
upon them.
Not only does the interstate com
merce commission now find it practi
cally Impossible, with its present mem
bership and organization, to perform
its great functions promptly and thor
oughly, but It is not unlikely that it
may presently be found advisable to
add to its duties still others equally
heavy and exacting. ( It must first be
perfected as an administrative instru
ment.
The country cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound industrial disturbances for
lack of additional means of arbitra
tion and conciliation which the con
gress can easily and promptly supply.
And all will agree that there must be
no doubt as to the power of the execu
tive to make immediate and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for the con
centration of the military forces of the
natio.n wherever they are needed and
whenever they are needed.
This is a program of regulation, pre
vention and administrative efficiency
which argues its own case in the mere
Statement of it. With regard to one
of its items, the irfcrease in the effi
ciency of the interstate commerce com
mission, the house of representatives
has already acted; its action needs
only the concurrence of the senate.
For Control and Operation.
I would hesitate to recommend, and
I dare say the congress would hesitate
to act upon the suggestion should I
make it, that any man in any occupa
tion should be obliged by law to con
tinue in an employment which he de
sired to leave. To pass a law which
forbade or prevented the individual
workman to leave his work before re
ceiving the approval of society in do
ing so would be to adopt a new prin
ciple into our jurisprudence which I
take it for granted we are not prepared
to Introduce. But the proposal that
the operation of the railways of the
country shall not be stopped or inter
rupted by the concerted action of or
ganized bodies of men until, a public
investigation shall have been
which shall make the whole question
at issue plain for the judgment of the
opinion of the nation is not to propose
any such "principle. It is based upon
the very different principle that the con
certed action of powerful bodies of men
shall not be permitted to stop the in
dustrial processes of the nation, at any
rate before the nation shall have had
an opportunity to acquaint itself with
the merits of the case as between em
ployee and employer, time to form its
opinion upon an impartial statement
of the merits, and opportunity to con
sider all practicable means of concilia
tion or arbitration.
I can see nothing in that proposition
but the justifiable safeguarding by so
ciety of the necessary processes of
its very life. There is nothing arbi
trary or unjust in it unless it be arbi
trarily and unjustly done. It can and
should be done with a full and scrupu
lous regard for the interests and liber
ties of all concerned as well as for the
permanent interests of society itself.
Other Legislation Urged.
Three matters of capital importance
await the action of the senate which
have already been acted upon by the
house of representatives: the bill
which seeks to extend greater freedom
of combination to those engaged In pro
moting the foreign commerce of the
country than is now thought by some
to he legal under the terms of the laws
against monopoly; the bill amending
the present organic law of Porto Itico;
rnd the bill proposing a more thor
ough and systematic regulation of the
expenditure of money in elections, com
monly called the Corrupt Practices Act.
I need not labor my advice that these
measures be enacted into law. Their
urgency lies In the manifest circum
stances which render their adoption at
this time not only opportune but neces
sary. ICven delay would seriousiy
jeopard the interests of the country
and of the government.
Immediate passage of the bill to reg
ulate the expenditure of money in elec
told me they felt that they were liv
ing the happiest days of all. There
seems to be a mysterious quality of
life Id these later years which is not
found in the earlier part, something
that is worth while in the living of it;
and no one has had all of human life
until he has been through' these years
and found it
Then, and uot before, 1 came back
to the conviction that one who has at
tained a Imlf-century of clean, honest
living, is worthy of congratulation;
that be ought to pass his fiirit ili birth-
Ttons may seem to be less necessary
than the Immediate enactment of the
other measures to which I refer; be
cause at least two years will elapse
before another election in which fed
eral offices are to be filled; but it would
greatly relieve the public mind If this
important matter were dealt with
while the circumstances and the dan
gers to the public morals of the pres
ent method of obtaining and spending
campaign funds stand clear under re
cent observation and the methods of
expenditure can be frankly studied in
the light of present experience; and a
delay would have tfie further very se
rious disadvantage of postponing ac
tion until another election was at hand
and some special object connected with
it might be thought to be in the mind
of those who urged it. Action can be
taken now with facts for guidance and
without suspicion of partisan purpose.
I shall not argue at length the desir
ability of giving a freer hand in the
matter of combined and concerted ef
fort to those who shall undertake the
essential enterprise of building up our
export trade.- That enterprise will
presently, will immediately assume,
has indeed already assumed, a magni
tude unprecedented in our experience.
We have not the necessary instrumen
talities for its prosecution; it is
deemed to be doubtful whether they
could be created upon an adequate
scale under our present > laws. We
should clear away all .legal obstacles
and create a basis of undoubted law
for it which will give freedom without
permitting unregulated license. The
thing miisf be done now, because the
opportunity is here and may escape us
if we hesitate or delay.
Porto Rico's Needs.
The argument for the proposed
amendments of the organic law of Por
to Rico is brief and conclusive. The
present laws governing the island and
regulating the rights and privileges oi
its people are not just. We have cre
ated expectations of extended privi
lege which we have not satisfied.
There is uneasiness among the people
of the island and even a suspicious
doubt with regard to our intentions
concerning them which the adoption ol
the pending measure would happily re
move. We do not doubt what we wish
to do in any essential particular. We
ought to do it at once.
There are other matters already ad
vanced to the stage of conference be
tween the two houses of which it is
not necessary that I should speak
Some practicable basis of agreement
concerning them w’ili no doubt be found
and action taken upon them.
Inasmuch as this is, gentlemen, prob
ably the last occasion I shall have tc
address the Sixty-fourth congress, 1
hope that you will permit me to saj
with what genuine pleasure and satis
faction I have co-operateij with you in
the many measures of constructive pol
icy with which you have enriched th<
legislative annals of the country. It
has been a privilege to labor in such
company. I take the liberty of con
gratulating you upon the completion ol
a record qf rare serviceableness anc
distinction.
That's Right.

promised Bobby. “I will, for sure,

PUNS FOR BEAUTY
When planning for next year’s gar
den decide on a rockery for the back
yard. There are many bulbs that are
excellent for rockeries. Scillas, which
are of a beautiful deep blue, do well
In the shade; spring snowflake, with
white flowers tipped with green, and
snowdrops are excellent for rocker
eries.
Muscaria or grape hyacinth, cro
cuses of various colors, will thrive
and take care of themselves once es
tablished in the rockeries or in bor
ders In the garden, where they will not
be disturbed.
The beauty which Is near at hand I
Is often neglefted for the prize that j
is denied us —we refer to the beauty I
and desirability of the Celastrus, or |i
bitter-sweet vine. This native climb- '
er found in our woods and along
fences, Is one of the most satisfactory
vines that can be grown about the
house.
The Celastrus is as hardy as gran
ite, -a quick grower, twining securely
about its support, and it is not liable
to disease.
In the fall when flowers are Sfcarce,
It covers itself with clusters of orange
colored fruit, which the frost opens,
revealing its crimson seeds.
Choose a dark, rainy day if possi
ble, for the transplanting, otherwise
do this work at sunset —we mean in
transplanting seedlings. Water the
seedbed thoroughly a short time be
fore you begin to transplant; then
lift the plants, with all the soil their
roots will hold, and remove to the
permanent bed.
Keet the seedling covered with a
wet doth, so that the heat and wind
will not dry them. With a sharp
pointed stick make the hole for the
plant and then fill it with water.
Plant the seedling in this puddle,

A miniature water garden is prac
tical and will prove most Interesting,
needing less attention than a flower

Have a sugar or vinegar barrel cut
in two, or use a wooden tub. Sink
this in the soil. Make a potting box
about twelve. inches square and fill
with rich mud from a pond, or use
half rich loam, adding to the mud or
loam about one-third of well-rotted
manure. ,

and the leaves appear, water may be
added from time to time until the tub

f Never change the water, simply re
place that which evaporates.
PLANTS WITHOUT SUN
The best plants for sunless rooms
are ferns and palms and perhaps the
best one of all Is aspidistra.
The aspidistra has long, narrow
leaves and dark green and variegated
coloring. It requires a good soil of
loam, well rotted manure and sand in
about equal parts and must be kept
moist but not wet.
Ferns require the same treatment
One of the hardiest palms Is the Kentia
bulmoreana. Its foliage Is less affected
by the heat, dry air and dust of a house
than most of the othey varieties.
The asparagus is good for a house
plant both for its beauty and for cut
ting purposes. Some of the little pines
make decorative and hardy house
plants.

APPLE DAINTIES.
There are many delicious dishes that
may be made from the common every
day apple. When
apples lack flavor
8L.3 various fruits may
be added to help
the deficiency.
