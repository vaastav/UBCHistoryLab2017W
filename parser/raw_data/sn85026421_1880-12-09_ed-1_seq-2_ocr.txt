the fundamental principle of our gov

The sentiment that the constitutional
rights of our citizens must be maintained
does not grow weaker. It will continue,
to control the government of the country.
Happily the history of the late election
shows that in many parts of the country

members, wiu see to It that every case of
violation of the letter or spirit of the fif
teenth amendment is thoroughly invest!-

Lion shall accrue to any person or par

, . ' CIVIX. SEBVICS BEVOBM.'
In ray former annual messages X have
' asked the attention of congress to the ur
gent necessity of a reform stlon of the
civil service system of the govern Trent.
My views concerning' the dangers' of pat
ronage or appointments for personal or
partisan considerations hve been string
. thened by my. observation and experience
, in the executive office and I believe
'.these dangers threaten the stability of
- the government. Abuses ao serious In

have been conducted for some years past

ftxscta the Cme and attention of appoint

the discharge of other official duties,
f preventing the abuse or the service for
he mere furtherance of private or parly
purposes, and leaving the employe of the
government, rreed irom tne oDiigatioia
im potted by patronage, to depend solely
upon merit for retention aud advance
ment, and with this oonstant incentive to
exertion and improvement.
These invaluable results have been at
tained in a high degree in the offices
where the rule for appointment by com
petitive examination nave been applied
A method which has so approved It
self by experimental tests at points
where such tests msy be fairly consider
ed conclusive, should be extended to all
subordinate positions under the govern
ment. I believe that a strong and grow
iBg publlo sentiment demands Immediate
measures tor securing ana eniorcing tne
highest possible efficiency in the civil
service, and its protection from recogniz
ed abuses, and mat tne experience reier
red to has demonstrated the feasibility of
such measures.
The examinations In the custom houses
and postofflces have been held under
mmv Amhsjrasanienta and without pro
vision for compensation for the extra
labor performed by the officers wno nave
nonduoted them, and whose commenda

. j - . .- . . , . ,
aminatlons anouid do conuueteu upon a
uniform system and under general super
vision. Section 1753 of the revised
statutes authorizes the President to pre
scribe the regulations for admlssiou to
the civil service of the united states, ana
for this purpose to employ suitable per
sons to conduct the requisite inquiries
with reference to ''the ntness or eacn
candidate in respect to age, health, char
acter, knowledge and ability for the
branch of service into which he seeks to
enter;" but the law Is practically luoo
eratlve for want of the requisite appro
nriatlon '
I therefore recommend an sppropila
tion of $25,000 per annum to meet the ex-
Eenses of commission, to do appoimeu
y the President in accordance with the
terms ol this section, whose duty it shall
be to devise a Just, uniform and efficient
system of competitive examinations, ana
to supervise the application of the same
throughout tne euure civu service 01 tue
government. I am persuaded that the
facilities which such a commission will
afford for testing the fitness of those who
apply for office will not only be as
welcome a relief to members of congress
as it will be to the President and heads of
HonnrtmnntM. but that It will also frreatlv
tend to remove the causes of embarass-
ment which now inevitably and con
stantly attend the conflicting claims ol
patronage between the legislative and
executive departments. The most effect
uaicbeck uoon tne pernicious com pen
tlon of Influence and official favoritism
in the bestowal of office, will be the sub
stltution ofan open competition ot merit
between tne applicants, in wnicn every
ore can make his own record with the
assurance that his success will depend
upon this alone,
1' also recommend such legislation as,
while leaving every officer as free as any
other citizen to express his political opm
ion, and to use his means for their ad
vancement. shall also enable him to feel
as safe as any private citizen in refusing
all demands upon his salary tor political
purposes. A law which should thus
guarantee true liberty and Justice to all
who are engaged in the public service,
and likewise contain stringent provisions
ssalnst the use or official authority to co
erse the political action of private citizens
or of official subo-dlnatos, is greatly to be
desired.
The most serious obstacle, however, to
an improvement of the civil service, and
especially to a reform in the method of
appointment and removal has been fouud
to bo the practice, under what is known
as the spoils system, by wbicn tne ap
poiniiocr power has been so largely en
croacbed upon by members of congress,
The first step In the reform of the civil
service must be a complete divorce be
tween congress and the executive in tho
matter of appointments. The corrupting
doctrine that ''to the victors belong the
SDolle." is inscperable from contrresslon
al patronage as the established rule and
practice of parties In power. It comes
to be understood by applicants for office,
and bv the people uenerally, that repre
sentatives and senators are entitled to
disburse the patronage of their respective
districts and states. It is "not necessary
to recite at length the evils resulting from
this invasion of the executive functions.
The true principles of government in the
national conventions or tne leaaing par
ties of the country, hsve again end sgain
been spproved by the American people,
and have not been called In question In
any quarter. These authentlo ex presslons
of public opinion upon this all important
sublect are the statement of principles
that belong to the constitutional structure
of the government.
"Under the constitution the President
and heads of departments are to make
nominations for office. The senate Is to
advise and consent to appointments, and
the house of representatives Is to accuse
and prosecute faithless officers. The best
Interest in the publlo service demands
that these distinctions bo respected; that
senators and representatives, who may be
Judges and accusers, should not dictate
appointments to office." To this end the
co-operation nf the legislative depart
ment of the government is required, alike
by the necessities of the rase and by pub
llo opinion. Members of congress will
not be relieved from the demands made
upon them with reference to appoint
ments to omce until, Dy legislative en
actment, the pernicious practice Is con'
demned and forbidden. -
It is therefore recommended (hat an act
be Dassed defining the relations of, mem
bers of congress with respect to appoint
ment to office by the Presldent.ana I also
recommend that the provisions of section
1757. and of the sections following, of the
Ravised Statutes, comprising the tenure
of office act of March 2, 1867. be repealed.
Believing that to reform the system and
methods of the civil service in our coun
try is one of the highest and most imper
atlve duties of statesmanship, and that it
can be permanently done only by the
co-operation or the legislative ana execu
tive departments of the government, I
strain commend the whole subject to
your considerate attention.
FOLTOAMT '
It is the recognized duty and purpose of
the people or tne united states to sup
press polygamy where It now exists in
our territories, and to prevent its exten
sion. Faithful and zealous efforts hsve
been made by the United States authori
ties in Utah to enforce the lews against
It. Exnerience has shown that the legis
lation uoon this subject, to be (fftctlve.
rennlres extensive modification and
amendment. The longer action is delay
ed, the more difficult it will be to accom
ni anwnat is aesireu. rromp. ana a
elded measures are necessary. The
Mormon sectarian organization which
upholds polygamy haa the whole power
or making and executing the local legis
lation of the territory. By Its control of
the grand and petit juries, it possesses
large influence over the administration
of Justloe. Exercising, as the heads of
this sect do, the local political power of
the territory, they are able to make ef
fective their hostility to the law of con
gress on the subject of polygamy, snd,
in fact, do prevent - its enforcement.
Polygamy will not . be abolished
if the enforcement ot the law de-
Kndsupon those who practice and up
Id the crime. It can only be suppressed
by taking away the political power of the
sect which encourages and austains it.
The power or congress to enact suitable
laws to protect the territory is ample. It
is not a case for half-way measures. - The
Klltlcsl power of theMormon sect Is
;reasing; It controls new one of oar
wealthiest and most populous territories.
It Is extending steaditr into other terri
tories. Wherever It goes.lt establishes
polygamy and sectarian political power.
The sanctity of marriage and the family
relation are . the corner stone 0 our
American society and civilization. He
Ifglous liberty and the nepara ion of

tary ideas of free Institutions. To re
establish the Interests and principles
which polygamy and Mormonism have
imperilled, and to fully reopen to Intelli
gent and virtuous immigrants of all
creeds that part of our domain, whleh
has been. In a great degree, closed to
f;eneral immigration by Intolerant and
mmotal institutions, it is recommended
that the government or the territory of
Utah be reorganized.
I recommend thatcongress provide for
the rovernment ef Utah by a governor
and judges, or opmmltaloners. appointed
y the President and con Aimed by the
senate a government analogoua to the
utovit-lonal government established ror
the territory northwest of Ohio, by the
ordinance of 1767. If, however, it is
deeuuul best to oontluue the existing
form of local government. I recommend
that the right to vote, hold office, and ait
on Juries In the territory of Utah, bacon-
nned to those woo neitner practice nor
uphold polygamy. If thorough meas
ures sre adopted, It is believed that with
in a few yeara the evils which now afflict
Utah will be eradicated, and that thla
territory will In good time become oneot
the most prosperous and attractive ot the
new states 01 the Union.
RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRITAIN

within a lew weeks x nave received a
communication from her majesty's gov
ernment, renewing tho consideration of
the subject, both of the indemnity for
the injuries at Fortune bay, and of the
interpretation of the treaty in which the
previous correspondence had shown the
two governments to be at variance.
Upon both these topics the disposition
towards a friendly agreement is manifes
ted by a recognition of our right to an in
demnity for the transaction at Fortune
bay. leaving the measure of such Indem

assent to the view of this government,

interests of the shore fishery of the prov
incial seacoasts, and the vessel fishery of
our nsnermen, should he made the
subject of conference and concurrent ar
rangemont between the two govern
ments.
I sincerely hone that the basis may be
found for a speedy adjustment of the
very serious divergence of views iu the
interpretation of the fishery clauses ot
the treaty of Washington, which, as the
correspondence between tne two govern
ments stood at the close of the last session
of congress, seemed to be irreconcilable

There is reason to believe that the

this isthmus, from a barrier between the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Into a gate
way and thoroughfare between them, tor
the natives, and the merchant a hi pa of
the world should receive the approval
ot this government, as being compatible
with the discharge of these obligations
on our part, and consistent with our
Interests as the principal commercial
power of the western hemisphere. The
views which I expressed in a special
message to congress in March last, - in
relation to this project, 1 deem it my
duty to press upon your attention, sub
sequent consideration has but confirmed
the opinion "that it Is the right and
duty of the United States to assert and
maintain sucn supervision and authority
over any Interoreaniu canal across the
Isthmus that connects North and South
America as wlii protect our national
interest."
OTHER MINOR FOREIGN TOPICS.
The war between the republic of Chili
on the one hand, and the allied republics
of Peru and Bolivia on the other, stl.l
continues. This government has not
felt called upon te interfere in a contest
that is within the belligerent rights of the
parties as Independent states. W e have
however, always held ourselves In readl
ness to aid In accommodating their diff
erence, and have at different times re
minded both belligerents of our willing
ness to render such service.
Our good offices. In this direction, were
recently accepted by all the belligerents,
and It was hoped they would prove effi
cacious; but I regret to announce that
the measures, which the ministers of the
United States at Santiago and Lima were
authorized to take, with a view to bring
about a peace, were not successful. In
the course of the warworn e'questlons have
arlsn effecting neutral rights; in all of
these the ministers of.the United States
have, under their instructions, acted with
promptness and energy in protection of
American Interests.
The relations of the United States with
the empire of Brazil continue to be most
cordial, and their commercial Intercourse
steadily Increases, to their mutual ad
vantage. The Internal disorders with which the
Argentine republic has tor sometime
past been afflicted, and which have more
or less influenced its external trade, are
understood to nave been brought to a
close. Tnis nsppy result may be expect
ed to redound to the benefit ot the
foreign oommerco of the republic as well
as to the developement of its vast interior
resources.
In Samoa, the government of King
Malletoa, under the support and recog
nition of the consular representatives of
the united states, ureat Britain 'and
Germany, seems to have given peace and
tranquilly to the islands. While it doea
not appear desirable to adopt as a whole
the scheme of tripartite local govern
ment, which has been proposed, the
common Interests of the three great treaty
powers require harmony in their rela
tions to the native frame of government,
and this may be best secured by a simple
diplomatic agreement between them. It

GOVERN BENT AID TO TORSION COMMERCE.
The prosperous energies of our domestic in
dustries, and their Immense production of the
subjects ot foreign commerce, Invite, and even
require, an active development ol the wishes
and interests ot our people in that direc
tion. Especially Important la It that our
commercial relations with the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts of South America, with the West
Indies and Gulf of Mexico should be direct,
ana not tnrougn tne circuit or European ays
terns, and should be carried on lu our ewn bot
toms. The full appreciation of the opportuni
ties which our front on the Pacific ocean gives
to commerce witn japan, L'hina, and the least
Indies, with Australia and the island groups
which lie along these routes of navigation,
should Inspire equal efforts to appropriate to
our own shipping, and to administer by our
own capital, a due proportion ot this trade-
whatever modifications or our regulations of
trade and navigation may be necessary or use
ful to meet and direct these Impulses to the
enlargement of our exchanges snd ot our car
rying trade. I am sure the wisdom of congress
will te reaay to auppiy. une initial measure,
however, seems to me so clearly useful and
efficient that I venture to press It uoon your
earnest attention. It seems to be very evident
that the provision of regular ateam postal com
munication, dj aia rroin tne government, has
been the forerunner of the commercial ore-
dominance of Great Britain on all these coasts
and seas, a greater share In whose trade la now
the desire and the Intent ot our people. It is
also manifest that the efforts of other Euro
pean nations to contend with Great Britain for
a ahare of thla commerce have been successful
In proportion with their adoption of regular
steam postal conimunlcatien with the markets
whose trade they sought Mexico and the
states of South America are anxious to re
ceive such postal communications with this
country, and to aid in their development. Sim
liar co-operation may be looked for, la due
time, from the eastern nations and from Aus
tralia, it is dllUcult to see how the lead in this
movement can be expected from private inter
ests. In respect of foreign commerce, quite as
much as in internal trade, postal communica
tion seems necessarily a matter of common
and public administration, and thus pertaining
to government I respectfully recommend to
your prompt attention such just and efficient
measures as may conduce to the development
or our foreign commercial exchanges and the
Duuaing up 01 our carrying trade.
In this connection I desire also to suggest
the very great service which might be expect
ed in enlarging and facilitating our commerce
on the Pacific ocean, were a transmarine cable
laid from sau Francisco to the Sandwich is
lands, and thence to Japan at the north and
Australia at the south. The great Influence of
sucn means or communication on these routes
of navigation, In developing and securing the
due share of our Pacific coast in the commerce
of the world, needs no Illustration or enforce
ment It may be that such an enterprise, use
ful and in the end profitable as it would prove
to private investment, may need to be acceler
ated by prudent legislation by congress in Its
aid, and 1 submit the matter to your careful
consideration.
An additional, and not unimportant, although
seconsary, reason ior restoring ana enlarging
the navy may be found in the unquestionable
service to tne expansion or our commerce,
which would be rendered by the freouent cir
culation of naval ships In the seas and ports of
all quarters of the globe. Ships of the proper
construction ana equipment to ue or tne great'
est efficiency in case of maritime war lultrht
be made constant and active agents in time of
peace iu the advancement and protection of
our foreign trade, and In the nurture and dis
cipline of young seamen who would naturally,
in some numbers, mix with and improve the
crews of our merchant ships. Our merchants
at home and abroad recognize the value to for
eign commerce of an active movement of our
naval vessels, ana the intelligence and patriot
ic zeal of our naval officers in promoting every
interest in their countrymen is a Just subject
or national pnae.
THB FINANCES.

for the year.
The aggregate of the revenues from sll
sources during the fiscal year ended June 80,
1880, waa 9333,526,610 98, an Increase over the
receding year of 959,699,426 52. The receipts
bus far, of the current year, together with the
estimated receipts for the remainder of the
year, amount to 9350,000,000, which will be
sufficient to meet the estimated expenditures
of the year, and leave a aurplua of 990,000,000.
It is fortunate that this large aurplua revenue
occurs at a period when It may be directly ap-
Elled to the payment of the puolle debt aoon to
s redeemable. Ho more public duty has been
more constantly cherished in the United States
than the policy of paying the nation's debt as
rapidly aa possible.
The debt of tha United States, less rash In
the treasury and exclusive of accruing interest
attained Its maximum of 92,756,431371 43 ln
August 1865, and hss sines that time been re
duced to 186,019,504 65. Of the principal of
the debt (108,758,100 haa been paid since
Lurch :, 1877, ejecting an Annual aanng or in
terest of 96,107,593. The burden of interest
has also been diminished by the sale ot bonds
bearing a low rate of interest and the applica
tion of the proceeds to the redemption ot
bonds bearing a higher rate. The annual sav
ing thuaaecured since March L 1877, is 91V
290,453 50.
Within a abort period over 9600,000,000 of
five and six per cent bonds will become re
deemable. This presents a very favorable op
portunity not only to further reduce the prin
cipal of the debt but also to reduce the rate of
Interest on that which will remain ucpald. I
call the attention of congress to the views ex
pressed on this subject by the secretary of the
treasury in bis annual report ana recommend
prompt legislation, to enable the treasury de-
Sartment to complete the rerunaing or the
ebt which la about to mature.
The continuance of specie payment haa not
been interrupted or endangered since the date
of resumption. It haa contributed greatly to
the revival or business snd to our remarkable
prosperity. The fears that preceded and ac
companied resumption have proved ground
less. No considerable amount of United States
notes have been presented for redemption,
while very large sums ot gold bullion, both
domestic and imported, are taken to the mints
and exchanged for coin or notes. The In
crease of coin and bullion in the United States
since January 1, 1879, is estimated at 9227,-899,428.
There sre aim in existence, uncancelled,
9346,681,015 of United States legal tender
notes. These notes were authorized as a war
measure, made necessary by the exigencies of
the conflict in which the United States was
then engaged. The preservation of the na
tion's existence required, ln the judgment of
congress, an Issue of legal tender paper mouey.
That it served well the purpose ror whicn it
was created is not questioned, but the employ.
ment of the notes as paper money indefinitely.
after the accomplishment of the object for
which they were provided, was not contem-
lated by the framers of the law under which
iev were Issued. These notes long since be
came like any other pecuniary obligation of
the government a debt to be paid, and, when
Eaid. to be cancelled as mere evidence or an
idebtedness no longer existing. I therefore
repeat what was said ln the anoual message of
last year, that the retirement from circulation
ot United States notes, with the capacity of
legal tender iu private contracts, is a step to
be taken in our progress toward a sore ana
stable, currency, which should be accepted, as
the policy and duty of the government and the
interest and security oi the people.
At the time of the passage of the act now in
force requiring the coinage of sliver dollars.
fixing their value and giving them legal tender
character, it was believed by many of the sup-
porters of the measure that the sliver dollar.
which it authorized, would speedily become,
under the operations of the law, of equivalent
value to the gold dollar. There were other
supporters of the bill, who, while they doubt
ed as to the probAuuiiy or una result never
theiess were wining to give the proposed ex
perlment a fair trial, with a view to stop the
coinage If experience should prove that the
silver dollar authorized by the bill continued
to be of less commercial valuo than the stand
ard gold dollar.
The coinage or stiver dollars under the net
referred to began lu March, 1878, and has been
continued as reaulred by tho act The aver
age rate per mouth to the present time has
been 92,276,492. The total amount coined
orlor to the first of November last was 972,'
847,750. Of this amount 917,084,450 remain
lnthe treasury, and only 925.76&291 are in
the hands of the people. A constant effort has
been made to keep this currency in circula
tion and considerable expense has been
necessarily incurred for this purpose,
but its return to the treasury Is prompt and
sure. Contrary to the confident anticipation
ot the friends of the measure at the time of its
adoption, the value of the stiver dollar, con
taining 41214 grains of silver, has not increas
ed. During the-year prior to the passage of
the bill authorizing its coinage the market
value of the silver which It contained was from
90 to 92 cents, as compared with the standard
gold dollar. During the last year the average
market value of the silver dollar has been'88
It 1 obvious, that the legislation of the last
congress la regard toj silver, so far as it was
based on an anticipated rise in the value of sll
veras a result of that legislation, has failed to
produce the effect then predicted. The longer
the law remains in force, requiring as it does
the coinage of a nominal dollar, which, in re
ality, is not a dollar, the greater becomes the
danger that ttiis country wui oe iorcea to ac
cent a single metal as the sole legal standard
ot value, in circulation, and this a standard of
less value than it purports to be worth in the
recognized money or the world.
The constitution of the United States, sound
financial principles, and our best interests, all
renulre that the country should have as its
legal tender money, both gold and silver coin,
of an intrinsic value, ns bullion, equivalent to
that winch, upon Its lace, it purports to pos
sess. The constitution, in express terms, re
cognizes both gold and silver as the only true
legal tender money. To banish either of these
metals from our currency is to narrow and
limit the circulating medium of exchange to
the disparagement of important interests. The
United States produces more silver than any
other country, and Is directly interested in
maintaining it as one of the two precious met
als which furnish the coinage of the world. It
will, ln my Judgment contribute to this result
It congress will repeal so much of existing
legislation as requires the coinage of silver dol
lars containing 4iz groins or silver, ana in
Its stead will authorize the secretary of the
treasury to coin sliver dollars of equivalent
value as bullion, with gold dollars. This will
defraud no man, and will be ln accordance
with familiar precedents. Congress, on several
occasions, has altered the ratio of value be
tween gold and silver, in order to establish it
more nearly in accordance witn the actual ra
tlo of value between the two metals.
In financial legislation every measure In the
direction of greater fidelity in the discharge of
pecuniary obligations, has been found by ex
ierience to dimmish the rates of interest which
debtors. are required to pay, and to increase
the facility with which money can be obtained
for every legitimate purpose. Our own recent
financial history shows how surely money be
comes abundant whenever confidence In the ex-a-t
performance of moneyed obligations is es
tablished
TEE WAB DEPARTMENT.

strength is the least possible force at which the
resent organization can be maintained, hav
ng in view efficiency, discipline and economy.
While the enlistment ot this force would add
somewhat to the appropriation for pay of the
army, the saving made in other respects would
be more than an equivalent for this additional
outlay, and the efficiency of the army would
be largely increase!.
The nmld extension of the railroad svstem
west of the Mississippi river and the great tide
of settlers which has flowed ln upon new ter
ritory Impose upon the military an entire
change ot policy. The maintenance of small
posts along wagon and stage-routes of travel
is no longer necessary. Permanent quarters at
points selected of a more substantial character
than those heretofore constructed will be re
aulred. Under existing laws permanent build
ings cannot be erected without the sanction of
congress, and when sales of military sites
and Dulldings have been authorized, the moneys
receivea nave revenea to tne treasury, ana
could only pecome avanapie through a new
appropriation, it is recommended that pro
vlblon be made, by a general statute, for the
sale or aucu auanuonea military posts and
buildings as are found to be unnecessary, and
for the application of the proceeda to the con.
struction of other posts, while many of the
present posts are or but slight value for mill,
uiry purposes, owing to the changed condition
of the country, their occupation la continued at
great expense and Inconvenience, because they
anora tneoniy avauauie aneiter ior troops.
The absence of a large number of officers of
the line, ln active duty, from their regiments.
Is a serious detriment to the maintenance or
the service. The constant demand for small
detachments, each of which should be com
manded by a commissioned officer, and the va
rious details of officers for necessary service
away from their commands, occasions a scarci
ty ln the number required for company duties.
v 1th a view to lessening this drain to some ex
tent it Is recommended that the law author
izing the detail of officers from the active list
as professors of tactics and military science at
certain colleges and universities, be so amend
ed as to provide that all such details be made
from the retired list of the army.
Attention Is asked to the necessity of provld-
disciplining the active militia of theeountryl
and liberal appropriations are recommended
in this behalf. The reports of the adjutant
genera of the army and the chief of ordnance
touching this subject fully set forth Its Importance.
The report of the officer In charge of educa
tion In the army shows that there are 78 schools
now in operation In the army, with an aggre
gate attendance of 2,305 enlisted men and
children. The secretary recommends the en
listment of 150 schoolmasters, with the rank
and pay of commissary sergeants. An appro
priation is needed to supply the Judge advo
cates of ths army with suitable libraries, and
the secretary recommends that the corps of
Judge advocates be placed upon the same foot
ng as to promotion with the other ataff coma
of ths army. Under existing laws the bureau
of military Justice constats or one officer, the
Judge advocate general and the corps of Judge
advocates of eight oCcers of esual rank (maj I
ors), with a provision that the limit of tee
corps shall remain at four when reduced by
casualitv or resignation to that number. The
consolidation or the bureau or military jusuce
and the corps ot judge advocates, upon the
same basis with the other staff corps of the
army, would remove an unjust discrimination
against deserving omcers, ana sutwerve mo
best interests or the service.
Especial attention is asked to the report of the
chief of engineers upon the condition of our
national defenses. From a personal Inspection
of many of the tortlflcatlous referred to the
secretary Is able to emphasize the recommenda
tions made and to state that their Incomplete
and defenseless condition la discreditable to
the country. While other nations have been
increasing their means ror carrying on offen
sive warfare and attacking maritime cities,
we have been dormant lu preparations tor de
fense; nothing of importance haa been done
toward strengthening and finishing our case
mated works since our late civil war, during
which the great guns pt modern warfare and
the heavy armor of modern fortifications and
ships came Into use among nations, and our
earth woiks left, by a sudden failure of appro
priation a aome yeara Mnce, in all stages of in
completlon, are now being rapidly destroyed
by the elements.
INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.
The two great rivers of the North American
continent the Mississippi and the Columbia,
have their navigable waters wholly within the
limits of the Uuited States, and are ot vast Im
portance to our internal and foreign commerce.
The permanency of the important work on the
south pass or the Mississippi river seems now
to be assured. There has been no failure what
ever ln the maintenance ot the maximum chan
nel during the six months ended August 9 last
This experiment has opened a broad, deep high
way to the ocean, and is an improvement upon
the permanent success of which congratula
tions may be exchanged among people abroad
and at home, and especially among the com
munities ot the Mlssippl valley, whose commer
cial exchanges float lu an unobstructed channel
saieiy to ana from tne sea.
A comprehensive Improvement ot the Missis
sippi and its tributaries is a matter ot tran
scendent importance. 'These great water ways
comprise a system ol inland transportation
spread like net-work over a large portion of
tne united Mates, ana navigable to tne extent
of many thousands of miles. Producers and
consumers alike have a common Interest ln
such uneaualled facilities for cheap transporta
tion, ueograpbicaiiy, commercially and po
litically they are the strongest tie between the
various sections of the country. These chan
nels of communication and interchange are
the property of the nation. Its Jurisdiction la
paramount over their waters, and the plainest
principles ol public interest require their Intel
iigent and careful supervision, with a view to
their protection, improvement and the enhance
ment of their usefulness.
The channel of the Columbia river, for a
distance of about 100 miles from its mouth, is
obstructed by a succession or bars, which oc
casion serious delay in navigation, and heavy
expense for lighterage and towage. A depth
or at leaBt 20 feet at low tide should be secured
and maintained, to meet the requirements of
the extensive and growing inland and ocean
commerce it subserves. The most urgent heed,
however, for this great wster-way is a per
manent Improvement ot the channel at the
mouth of the river.
From Columbia river to San Francisco, a
distance of over 600 miles, there is no harbor
on our Pacific coast which can be approached
during stormy weather. An appropriation of
9150,000 was made by the 45th congress for
the commencement of a breakwater and bar-
lor of refuse, to be located at some noint be
tween the straits of Fuca and San Francisco
at which the necessities ot commerce, local and
general, will be best accommodated. The am
ount appropriated Is thought to be quite In
adequate for the purpose intended. The cost
of the work when finished will be very great
owing to the want of natural advantages for
a site at any point on the coast between the
designated limits, and It has not been thought
to be advisable to undertake the work without
a larger appropriation. I commend the matter
to the attention of congress.
NEW WAR DEPARTMENT BCILDING3.
The completion of the new building for the
war department is urgently needed, and th
estimates for continuing its construction are
especially recommended.
The collections of books, specimens, and re
cords constituting the army medical museum
and library are of national Importance. The
library now contains about fifty-one thousand
five hundred (51,500) volumes snd fifty-seven
thousand (57,000) pamphlets relating to medl
cine, surgery, and allied topics. The contents
ot the army medical museum consists of
twenty-two thousand (22.000) specimens, and
areuuioueln the completeness with which
both military surgery and the diseases of
armies are Illustrated. Their destruction would
be an Irreparable loss, not only to the United
States, but to the world. There are filed In the

for the protection of the government against
attempted frauds, as well as for the benefit of
honest claimants. These valuable collections
are now ln a building which is peculiarly ex
fosed to the danger of destruction by fire. It
a therefore earnestly recommended that an
appropriation be made for a new fire-proof
building, adequate for the present needs and
reasonab'e future expansion ot these valuable
collections. Such a building should be abso
lutely nre-proor; no expenditure for mere
architectural display is required. It is believed
that a suitable structure can be eixcted at a
cost not to exceed 9250,000.
GEN. GRANT.
I commend to the attention of congress the
great services of the commander-in-chief of
our armies during the war for the Union,wbose
wise, nrm and patriotic conduct dta so much
to bring that momentous conflict to a close.
The legislation of the United States contains
many precedents for the recognition of dlstln
guished military merit authorizing rank and
emoluments to oe conrerrea ior eminent ser
vices to the country. An act of congress au
thorlzlng the appointment of a captain general
of the army, with suitable provisions relating
to compensation, retirement and other details,
would, in my judgment be altogether fitting
and proper, and would be warmly approved by
the country.
THE NAT! DEPARTMENT.
The report of the secretary of the navy ex
blbits the successful and satisfactory manage
ment of that department during the last fiscal
year. The total expenditures for the year were
912,916,639 45. leaving unexpended at the close
of the year 92,141,682 23 of the amount of
available appropriations. The appropriations
for the present fiscal year ending June 80.188L
are 915,095,061 45; and the total estimates for
the next fiscal year ending June 80, 1882, are
915,953,751 61. The amount drawn by war
rant from July 1, 1880, to November 1, 1880, Is
95,041,570 46.
The recommendation of the secretary of the
navy, that provision be made for the establish
ment of some form of civil government for the
Eeople of Alaska, is approved. At present there
i do protection of persons or property in that
territory except such as la afforded by the offi
cers of the United States ship Jamestown. This
vessel was dispatched to Sitka because of the
fear that without the immediate presence of
the national authority there was impending
danger of anarchy. The steps taken to restore
order have been accepted in good railh by both
white and Indian inhabitants, and the necessi
ty for this method ot restraint does not, ln my
opinion, now exist, ir, nowever, the James
town should be withdrawn, leaving the people
as at present, without the ordinary, judicial
aid administrative authority of organized local
government, serious consequences might
ensue.
The laws provldo only for the collection of
revenue, the protection or public property, and
the transmission of the malls. The problem Is
to supply a local rule for a population so scat
tered snd so peculiar in' its origin and condl
tlon. The natives sre reported to be teachable
and self-supporting, and jf properly Instructed,
doubtless would advance rapidly In civiliza
tion, nnd a new factor of prosperity would be
added to the national life, I therefore recom
mend the requisite legislation upon this sub
ject Tbe aeor tary of the navy ha taken ateps

INDIAN AFFAIB8.
The report of tbe secretary of the Interior
presents an elaborate account ot the operations
of that department for the past year. It gives
me great pleasure to say that our Indian st
airs appear to be ln a more hopeful condition
now than ever before. The Indians have made
gratifying progress in agriculture, herding
and mechanical pursuits. Many who were a
few years ago in hostile conflict with the gov
ernment are quietly settled down on farms
where they hope to make their permanent
homes, building houses and engaging in the
occupations of civilized life. The Introduction
of the freighting business among them has
been remarkably fruitful of good results, ln
giving many of them congenial and remunera
tive employment and ln stimulating their am
bition to earn their own support Their hon
esty, fidelity snd efficiency as carriers are high
ly praised. The organization of a police force
of Indians has been equally successful ln main
taining law snd order upon tbe reservations,
and ln extrvislng a wholesome moral Influence
among the Indians themselves. I concur with
the secretary ot the interior In the recommend
ation that the pay of this force be Increased, as
an inducement to the best class of young men
to enter It
Much care and attention has been devoted to
the enlargement ot educational' lacilltlee for
the Indians. The means available for this Im
portant object have been very Inadequate.
A few additional boarding-schools at Indian
agencies have been established and the erec
tion of buildings has been begun for several
more, but an Increase of the appropriations
for this Interesting undertaking is greatly
needed to accommodate tbe large number of '
Indian children of school age. The number
offered by their parents from all parts of the
country for education in the government
schools is much larger than can be accommo
dated with the means at present available for
that purpose. The number of Indian pupils at
the normal school at Hampton, Virginia, under
the direction of Gen. Armstrong, has been
considerably increased, and their progress is
highly encouraging. The Indian school estab
lished by the interior department in 1879 at
Carlisle, Fa under the direction of Capt
Pratt has been equally success! uL It has now
nearly 200 pupils ef both sexes, representing a
great variety of the tribes east of the Kocky
mountains. Tbe pupils lu both Institutions re
ceive not only an elementary English education
but are also Instructed in housework, agrlcul
ture, and useful mechanical pursuits. A sim
ilar school was established this year at Forest
Grove, Oregon, for the education of Indian
youth on the Pacific coast In addition to this
86 Indian boys and girls were selected from
tbe eastern Cherokees and placed in boarding
schools in North Carolina, where they are to
receive an elementary English education and
training in industrial pursuits. The Interest
shown by Indian parents, even among the so
called wild tribes, ln the education of their
children is very gratifying, and gives promise
that the results accomplished by the efforts
now making will be of lasting benefit
The expenses of Indian education have 0
far bee a drawn from the permanent civilisa
tion fond at ths diipoal of the department
of the interior; but tbe fund ia now ao mnoh
red noed that tbe con tin nance of thla benefi
cial work will in the tuture depend on apecifio
appropriations by congreaa for the purpose,
and 1 venture to expreaa ths hope that oon
greae will not permit inntitations so fraitfal
of good resnlts, to perish for want of means
for their support On the contrary, an in
crease of the number of such schools appears
to me highly advisable.
The pa.t year baa been unusually free from
disturbance smong tbe Indian tribes. An
agreement has been made with ths TJtea, by
which tbey aurrender tbeir large reservation
in Colorado in consideration of an annuity, to
be paid to them, and agree to eettle in aeveral
ty on certain lands designated for that pur
pose, as farmer, holding individual title to
their land in fee aimple, inalienable foi a cer
tain period. In thla way a ooetly Indian war
bar. been avoided, tthiob, at one time, aeemed
Imminent, and, for the first time in ths hie
tory of the oountry, ai Indian nation has
given up ita tribal exiatenoe to be settled in
severalty, and to live aa individuals under tbe
common protection of the lawa ot the country.
The conduct ot tbe Indiana thronghout the
country, daring the ta-.t year, with but few
noteworthy exceptions, haa been orderly and
peaceful. Tbe guerilla warfare carried on
for two years by Viotorio and hla band of
aouthern Apachca baa virtually come to an
end by the death of that chief and most of his
followers, on Mexican aoil. The disturbances
canned on onr northern frontier by Bitting
Bull and hia men, who had taken refuge in
the Biitinh dominions, aro alao likely to cease.
A large majority of hia followera have engen
dered to our military forcea, and tbe remain
der are apparently in progress of disintegra
tion. 1 concur with ths secretary of ths interior
in expressing the earnest hope that oongreas
will at this sepsien take favorable action on
the bill providing for ths allotment of lands
on ths different reservations in aoveralty to
tbs Indiana, with patents conferring fee-simple
title inalienable for a certain period, and
tbe eventual disposition ot ths residue of the
reservations for general eettlf ment with the
consent and for the benefit of ths Indiana,
plaoing the latter under tbs eqaal protection
of tbe lawa of the country. This measure, to
get her with a vigorous prosecution of onr edu
cation 1 tfforts, will work ths moat important
and effeotive advance toward tbe eolation ot
the Indian pro) lem ia preparing for ths grad
ral merging of onr Indian population in ths
great body of American oltiaenahip.
