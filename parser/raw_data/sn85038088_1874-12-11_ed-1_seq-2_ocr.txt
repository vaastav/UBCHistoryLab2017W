SOMERSET, OHIO,
FRIDAY DECEMBER 11. 1974.
The Reciprocity Treaty.
A well-posted and prominent
Democrat, of this place, hands os
the following, which, as it treats
upon a subject that will, in all prob
ability, receive Congressional con
sideration before a great while, and
will alao, 'doubtless, elicit general
discussion, we have thought it ap
propriate for a place in our columns,
and therefore take pleasure in giving
it insertion :
The Reciprocity Treaty between
England, represented by Thornton
of London and Brown of Canada
on the one part, and Secretary Fish
and the Free Traders of the United
States on the other, was concocted
in the dark and precipitated upon
the Senate with the sanguine hope
of success, in the closing hours of
the last Session. It failed, but not
without hope of future success. It
was not rejected it was only post
poned and this winter its wet
nurses hope to make it the adopted
child of hasty legislation. The
Hard Mouey ring and the Free
Trade ring will attempt to fasten
their European ideas upon this
country not by legis1ation enacted
thi3 year by all departments of the
Government, and therefore subject
to repeal or modification next year
on sober, second thought, but by
the act of Secretary Fish, President
Grant and the hard money, Free
Traders of the Senate, who will as
sume, usurp and arrogate to them
selves the prerogative of both the
lower and upper branches of Con
gress to regulate the revenues of
this country. The President, las
Cabinet and the Senate are to make
the law whereby free trade with
England, under pretense of Recip
rocity with Canada, is to be forced
upon this land of ours for twenty
four years to come.
True, the treaty peetexds to ad
mit, free of duty, only the agricult
ural, mechanical, and manufactured
products of Canada; but if the
scythe or chisel be made in England
and the handle be attached in Can
ada, are not these transformed into
Canadian manufactures? If we
say no and England says yes, is
there not a splendid opening, by
such "entangling alliances," for a
quarrel, a fight, &c.
The cloth is the tailor's raw mate
rial and if all the clothing of the
United States comes" from the pau
per workshops of England, through
Canada, and our own mechanics,
under this hard money and free
trade, European doctrine, are forced
to compete with the white slave
labor of European dynasties, it is
time to let these American mechan
ics know that the chains are forged
for their hands, and the American
Senate is expected to apply the
hand-cuffs this present winter by
means of the Reciprocity Treaty.
The farmers of the west who pro
duce the wheat consumed by New
England, New York and New Jer
sey, are to be taxed twenty cents on
each bushel to help swell the gains
of England. -The twenty cents per
bushel now taxed to Conadian wheat
is to be taken off, so that the twenty
millions bought by New England
annually and the twenty millions
bought by New York State every
year, mav come down from hard-
money Canada and force hard money
upon our farmers at an expense to
them of twenty cents less on every
bushel of wheat they raise for mar
ket. Canada is to be treated as
one of the United States while she
is not asked to contribute to the
treasury of the United States, but
to the treasury of Great Britain.
We are asked to allow our mines
to lie still, our factories to shut off
steam, our ships to rot in port, our
resources to remain undeveloped,
the capital invested in manufactur
ing industry to become unremuner
ative and worthless, and our work
ing men, already out of employment
and in the midst of winter, to be
told by the American Senate, acting
in obedience to the diplomacy of
England, that the coming spring
time will invite them to the fields
of the west," there to join in pro
ducing corn and; wheat already
profitless in the market.
The home market for wheat hith
erto supplied by American products
is to be surrendered to Canada, and
to England we are to consign the
monopoly of producing iron, woolen
and cotton fabrics, and we are to re
turn to agriculture, horticulture,
hard money, free trade, and Euro
pean prices for labor.
"Look to the Senate," was once
posted at every cross-road to be read
by the people, but it is now again
, more needful to warn the nation of
its peril, and to signal the treason
which the treaty proposes to mask,
under the name of Reciprocity.

The President's Message, j
To the Senate U1 Houie at Representative:
iince the convening of Congress one !
year ago me nation nas undergone aj
prostration in business and industries
such as has not been witness! with u i
for many years. Speculation as to the ,
canaee fot this prostration might be in-
tin ia without pro tit, becaiue as laa-
ny theories would be advanced as there
would be independent writers those
who expressed their own views. With-
out dwelling upon the subject, without
indulging in theories as to the cause of
this prostration, I will only call your at
tention to the fart, and one question as
to which it would seem there should be
no disagreement. During this prostra
tion two essential elements of prosperity
have been most abundant labor and
capital. Both have been largely unem
ployed. Where security has been un
doubted, capital has been attainable at
very moderate rate; where labor has
been wanted, it has been found in abun
dance, at cheap rates compared with
what necessaries and comforts of life
could be purchased with the wages de
manded. Two great elements of pros
perity therefore have not been denied us.
A third might be added. Our soil and
climate are unequaled within the limits
of any contiguous territory under one
nationality, for it varieties of products
to feed and clothe a people, and in the
amount of surplus to spare to feed less
favored people. Therefore, with these
facts in view it seems to .me that wise
statesmanship at this session of Congress
would dictate, ignoring the past, the di
recting in" proper channels these great
elements of prosperity to any people.
Debt abroad is the only element that
can, with always a sound currency, enter
into our affairs to cause any continued
depression in the industries and prosper
ity of our people. A great conflict for
National existence tuade necessary for
temporary purposes the raising of large
sums of money from whatever source at
tainable. It was necessary in the wis
dom of Congress, and I do not doubt
their wisdom in the premises, regarding
the necessity of the times, to devise a
system of National currency which it
proved to be ioijoaible to keep on a par
with the recogcied currency of the civ
ilized world. This begot a spirit of spec
ulation, involving an extravagance and
luxury not required for the happiness
or prosperity of a people, and involving
both directly and indirectly foreign in
debtedness. THE CUBHENCY
Being of finctuaiing value, therefore un
safe to hold for legitimate transections
requiring money, became a subject of
speculation in itself. These two causes,
however, have involved us in a foreign
indebtedness contracted in good faith by
borrower and lender, which should be
paid in coin and according to the bond
agreed upon when the debt was contract
ed, in gold or its equivalent. The good
faith of the Government cannot be vio
lated toward creditors without National
disgrace. Our commerce should be en
couraged, American ship-building and
carrying greatly increased, foreign mar
kets sought for the products of the soil
and manufactures, to the end that we
may be able to pay these debts. Where
a market can be created for the sale of
our products, either of the soil, the mine
or manufactory, a new means is discov
ered of utilizing our idle capital and la
bor, to the advantage of the whole peo
pie. But, in my judgment, the first step
toward this object is to secure aurrency
good wherever civilization reigns; one
which, if it becomes superabundant with
one people, will find a market with some
other; a currency which has as its basis
the labor necessary to produce it, which
will give it value. Gold and silver are
row the recognized mediums of exchange
the civilized world over, and this we
should return to with the least practical
delay.
In view of the pledges of the Ameri
can Congress when our present legal
tender system was adopted and debLcon
tracted, there should be no delay, cer
tainly no unnecessary delay, in fixing by
legislation a method by which we will
return to specie. To the accomplishment
of this end I invite your special atten
tion. I believe firmly that there can be
no prosperous and permanent revival of
business or industries until a policy is
adopted, with legislation to carry it out,
looking to a return to a specie basis. It
is easy to conceive that the debtor and
speculator may think it of value to them
to make so-called money abundant until
they can throw a portion of their bur
dens upon others, but even these I be
lieve would be disappointed in the re
sult if a course should be pursued which
will keep in doubt the values of the legal-tender
medium of exchange. A re
vival of productive industries is needed
by all classes, by none more than the
holders of property, of whatever sort,
with debts to liquidate, by realization
upon its sales. But, admitting that these
two classes of citizens are to be benefit
ed by expansion, would it be honest to
give it? Would nqhe general loss be
too great to justify such relief? Would
it not be just as honest and prudent to
au'horize each debtor to issue his own
legal-tenders to the extent of his liabili
ties than to do this? Would it not be
safer, for fear of over-issues by unseru
lous creditors, to say that all debt obli
gations are obliterated in the United
States and now we commence anew, each
possessing all he has at the time free
from incumbrance. - These propositions
are too absurd to be entertained for a
moment by thinking people. Every de
lay in the preparation of final resump
tion partakes of this dishonesty, and is
only less in degree as the hope is held
out that the convenient season will at
last arrive for the good work of redeem
ing our pledges to commence. It will
never come, in my opinion, except by
positive action by Congress or by na
tional disasters, which will destroy for a
time at least the credit of individuals
and the State at large. A sound cur
rency must not be reached by total bank
ruptcy of the credit or integrity of the
Nation and individuals. I believe it is
in the power of Congress at this session
to devise such legislation as will revive
confidence, revive all the industries,
start us on the career of prosperity and
save the credit of the Nation and of the
people. Steps toward the
BETURK TO A SPECIE BASIS
Are the great requisites to this end, de
voutly to be sought for, and there are
others which I may touch npon hereaf
ter. A Nation dealing in a currency be
low that of specie in value labors under
two great disadvantages. First, having
no use for the world'tacknowledged me
dium of exchange, gold and silver, these
are driven out of the country because
there is no demand for their use. " Sec
ond The medium of exchange being of
a fluctuating value, for, after all, it is
only worth just what it will purchwe of
gold and silver metals, having an in
trinsic value just in proportion to the
honest labor it take to produce them, a
large margin inu.t be allowed for profit
bv the manufacturer and producer. It
is months from the date of a production j
tu the date of realization. Interest upon
capital must be charged; a ri.-k of fluc
tuation in the value of that which is tu
be received in payment added. Hence
high prices, acting a a protection to the
foreign producer, who receives nothing
in exchange for the product of his skill
and labor, except a currency good at a
staple value the world over. It seems
to me that nothing ia clearer than the
greater part of the burden of the exist
ing prostration, for the want of a sound
financial system, falls upon the working
man, who must, after all, produce the
wealth, and the salaried man who super
intends and conducts business. The bur
den falls upon them in two ways by the
deprivation of employment and by the
decreased purchasing-power of their sal
aries. It is the duty of Congress to de
vise a method of correcting the evils
which are acknowledged to exist, and
not mine, but I will venture to suggest
two or three things which seem to me
absolutely necessary to a return to specie
payments. The first great requisite in a
return to prosperity is that the legal
tender clause to the law authorizing the
issue of currency by the National Gov
ernment should be repealed, to take ef
fect as to all contracts entered into after
a day fixed in the repealing act, but not
to apply, however, to payments of salar
ies by the Government, or other expen
ses now provided by law to be paid in
currency. In the interval pending be
tween the repeal and final resumption,
provision should be made by which the
Secretary of the Treasury can obtain
gold as it may become necessary from
time to time from the date when specie
resumption commenced. To this might
and should be added a revenue sufficient
ly in excels of expenses to insure an ac
cumulation of gold in the Treasury to
sustain redemption.
With redemption, free banking may
be authorized with safety, giving the full
protection to bill holders which they
have under the existing laws. Indeed,
I would regard free banking an essential.
It would give proper elasticity to the
currency. As more currency should be
required for the transaction of legitimate
business, new banks would be started,
and in turn banks would wind up their
business, when it was found there was a
superabundance of currency, The ex
perience and judgment of the people
can best decide just how much currency
is required for the transaction of the bu
siness of the country. It is unsafe to
leave the settlement of this question to
Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury,
or the Executive. Congress should
make the regulation under which banks
may exist, but should not make banking
a monopoly by limiting the amount of
redeemable paper currency that shall be
authorized.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
During the past year nothing has oc
curred to disturb the general friendly
and cordial relations of the United
States with other Towers.. The corres
pondence submitted, between this Gov
ernment and its diplomatic representa
tives of other countries shows a satisfac
tory condition of all questions between
the United States and most of those
countries, and, with few exceptions to
which reference is hereafter made, the
absence of any points of difference to be
adjusted.
The amount awarded to the Govern
ment of Great Britain by the mixed
Commission organized under the acts of
the Treaties of Washington in the set
tlement of the claifhs of British subjects
arising from acts committed between
April 18, 1841, and April 9, 1865, be
came practicable under terms of treaty
within the past year, and was paid upon
the 21st day of September, 1874. In this
connection I renew my recommendation
made at the opening of the last session
of Congress, that a special Court be cre
ated to hear and determine all claims
of aliens against the United States, aris
ing from acts committed against their
persons or property during the insurrec
tion. It appears equitable that oppor
tunity should be offered for persons of
other States to present their claims as
well as to those British subjects whose
claims were not admissible under the
late Commission, to the early decision of
a competent tribunal, and I recommend
the necessary legislation to organize a
Court to dispose of those claims of aliens
who are referred to, in an equitall? and
satisfactory manner, and to relieve Con
gress and the departments from the con
sideration of these questions.
THE DEPLORALE STRIFE IN CCBA
Continues without any marked change
in the relative advantages of the con
tending forces. The insurrection con
tinues, but Spain has gained no superior
ity. Six years of strife give the insur
rectian a significance which cannot be
denied. Its duration and the tenacity
of its adherents, together with the ab
sence of manifested power of suppression
on the part of Spain, cannot be contro
verted, and may make some positive
steps on the part of the other Powers a
matter of self-necessity.
I had confidently hoped at this time
to be able to announce the arrangement
of some important questions between
this Government and that of Spain, bu
the negotiations have been protracted.
The unhappy intestine dissensions of
Spain command our profound sympathy,
and must be accepted as, perhaps, a cause
of some delay. An early settlement in
part, at least, of the questions between
the Governments is hoped. In the mean
time, awaiting the results of immediate
ly pending negotiations, I defer a furth
er and full communication on the" sub
ject of the relations of this country and
Spain.
EXPATRIATION.
I have again to call the attention of
Congress to the unsatisfactory condition
of the existing laws with reference to
expatriation and the election of nation
ity. Formerly amid conflicting opin
ions and decisions it was difficult to ex
actly determine how far the doctrine of
personal allegiance was applicable to cit
izens of the United States. Congress, by
the act of the 27th of July, 1868, assert
ed the abstract right of expatriation as
a fundamental principle of this Govern
ment. Notwithstanding such assertion,
and the necessity of the frequent appli
cation of the principle, no legislation
has been had defining what acts or for
malities shall work expatriation, or
when a citizen shall be deemed to have
renounced or to have lost his citizen
ship. The importance of such defini
tion is obvious. The representatives of
the United States in foreign countries
are continually called upon to lend their
aid and the protection of the United
States to persons concerning the good
faith or the reality of whose citizenship
there ia at least great question. In some
the provisions of the treateis fur-
Bisk aorae guide, in others it seems left
to the persona claiming the benefit of
ciuaensbip, while living in a foreign
country, contributing in no manner to
the performance of the obligations and
duties of a citizen of the United States,
simply as a shield from the performance ,
of the obligations of citizens elsewhere, j
The status of children, born of Anieri- j
can parents residing in a foreign eoun-1
try, of American women who have mar
ried aliens, of American citizens resid- j
ing abroad, where such question is not
regulated by treaty, are all sources of
frequent difficulty and discussion. Le
islation on these and similar questions,
and particularly defining when and un
der what circumstances expatriation can
be accomplished or is to be presumed, is
especially needed.
In this connection I earnestly call the
attention of Congress to the difficulties
arising from fradulent naturalization.
The United States wisely, freely, and lib
erally offers its citizenship to all who
may come in good faith to reside within
its limit on their complying with certain
prescribed reasonable and simple formal
ities, and conditions. Among the high
est duties of the Government is that to
afford firm, efficient and equal protection
to all its citizens, whether native born
or naturalized. Care should be taken
that a right carrying with it such sup
port from the Government should not
be fraudulently obtained, and should be
bestowed only upon full proof of a com
pliance with the law. There are fre
quent instances of illegal and fraudulent
naturaliazation and of the unauthorized
use of certificates thus improperly ob
tained. In some cases the fraudulent
character of the naturalization has ap
peared upon the face of the certificate
itself; in others, examination discloses
that the holder had not complied with
the.law, and in others certificates have
been obtained where the persons holding
them not only were not entitled to be
naturalized, but had not even been with
m the United States at the time of the
pretended naturalization. Instances of
each of these classes of fraud are discov
ered at our Legations, where the certifi
cates of naturalization are presented ei
ther for the purpose of obtaining pass
ports or in demanding the protection of
the Legation. When the fraud is open
on the face of snch certificates, they are
taken up by representatives of the Gov
ernment and forwarded to the Depart
ment of State. But even the record of
the Court in which the fraudulent natu
ralization occurred remains, and dupli
cate certificates are readily' obtainable
upon the presentation of these, for the is
sue of passports or demanding protec
tion of Government. The fraud some
times escapes notice, and such certficates
are not unfrequently used in transactions
of business, to the injury of innocent par
ties. Without placing any additonal ob
stacle in the way of the obtainment of
citizenship by the worthy and well inten-
tioned foreigner, who comes in good
faith, I would earnestly recomend further
legislation to punish fraudulent natura
lization, and to secure the ready cancel
lation of every naturalization made in
fraud.
Since my lost annual message the ex
change has been made of the ratification
of treaties of extradition with Belgium,
Ecuador, Peru, and Salvador; also, of a
treaty of commerce and navigation with
Peru, and one of commerce and consular
privileges with Salvador, all of which
have beenjduly proclaimed, as has also a
declaration with Russia, with reference
to trade marks.
THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF
THE TREASURY,
Which by law is made directly to Con
gress, and forms no part of this message,
will show the receipts and expenditures
of the Government for the last fiscal
year, the amount received from each
source of revenue, and the amount paid
out for each of the departments of the
Government. It will be observed from
the report that the amount of receipts
over expenditures has been but $2,344,
882 30 for the fiscal year ending June
10, 1874, and that for the current fiscal
year the estimated receipts over expen
ditures will not much exceed $9,000,000.
In view of the large National debt ex
isting, and the obligation to add one per
cent, to the sinking fund, amounting
now to $34,000,000 per annum, I submit
whether the revenues should not be in
creased or expenditures diminished to
reach this amount of surplus. Not to
provide for the sinking fund is a partial
failure to comply with the contracts and
obligations of the Government. At the
last session of Congress a very consider
able reduction was made in the rates of
taxation and in the number of articles
submitted to taxation; the question may
well be asked whether or not in some in
stances unwisely.
In connection with this subject too, is
the opinion that the means of collecting
the revenue, especially from imports,
have been so embarrsed by legislation
as to make it questionable whether or
not large amounts are not lost by failure
to collect, to the direct loss of the Treas
ury and to the prejudice of the interests
of honest importers and tax-payers.
The Secretary of the Treasury, in his
report, favors legislation looking to
specie payments, thus supporting the
views previously expressed in this mes
sage. He also recommends economy in
appropriation, and calls attention to the
loss of revenue from repealing the tax
on tea and coffee without benefit to the
consumer; recommends an increase of
ten cents a gallon on whisky, and
further, that no modification be made
in the Banking and Currency Bill, pass
ed at the last session of Congress, unless
modification ghoul? become necessary
by reason of the adoption of measures
for retuning to specie payments. In
these recommendations I cordially join.
I would suggest to Congress the propri
ety of
READJUSTING THE TARIFF,
So as to increase the revenue, and at the
same time decrease the number of arti
cles upon which dnties are levied. Those
articles which enter into our manufac
tures, and are not produced at home, it
seems to me, should be entered free.
Those articles of manufacture which we
produce, or a constituent part of, but do
not produce the whole, that part which
we do not produce should enter free also.
I will instance fine wool, dyes, Ac.
These must be imported to form a part
of the manufacture of the higher grades
of woolen goods, and chemicals used as
dyes, compounded in medicines, and us
ed in various ways in manufactures,
come under this class. The introduc
tion, free of dues, of such wools as we
do not produce, should stimulate the
manufacture of goods requiring these
and those we do produce, and therefore
would be a benefit to home production.
There are many articles entering into
home manufactures which we do not
produce ourtelves, the tariff upon
which increases the cost of producing
the manufactured article. All correc- I
tions in this regard are in the direction j
of bringing hibor and capital in har-
money with each other, and of supply- ;
ins one of the elements much needed. I
I
THE WB REPORT. j
The report of the Secretary of War
herewith attached and forming a part of j
this message gives all the information j
concerning all the operations, wants and ,
necessities, and contains many sugges
tions and recommendations which I
commend to your special attention.
There is no class of Government em
ployes who are harder worked than the
army officers, and none who perform
their tasks more cheerfully and more
efficiently, and under circumstances of
greatest privations and hardships.
Legislation is desirable to render more
efficient this branch of the public ser
vice. All the recommendations of the
Secretary of War I regard as judicious,
and I especially commend to your atten
tion the following: The consolidation
of Government arsenals; mileage to offi
cers traveling under orders; the exemp
tion of money received from the sale
of subsistence stores from being covered
into the Treasury; the use of appropria
tions for the purchase of subsistence
stores without waiting for the begin
ning of the fiscal year for which the ap
propriation is made; for additional ap
propriations for the collection of torpedo
material; for increased appropriations
for the manufacture of arms; for reliev
ing the various States from indebted
ness for arms charged to them during
the rebellion; for dropping officers from
the rolls of the army without trial for
the offense of dfaeung pay more than
once for the same period; for the dis
couragement of the plan to pay soldiers
by checks, and for the establishment of
a professorship of rhetoric and English
literature at West Point.
The reasons for the recommendations
are obvious,and are set forth sufficiently
in the report attached. I also recom
mend that the status of the staff corps
of the army be fixed where this has not
already been done, so that promotions
may be made and vacancies filled as
they occur in each grade when reduced
below the number to be fixed. The ne
cessity for such legislation is specially
felt now in the pay department the
number of vacancies in that department
being now below the number adequate
to the performance of the duties requir
ed of them by law.
NAVY REPORT.
The efficiency of the Navy has been
largely increased during the last year,
under the impulse of the foreign com
plications which threatened us. At the
commencement of the last' session of
Congress, most of our efficient wooden
ships were put in condition for iinme
diate service, and the repairs of our
ironclad flest were pushed with the ut
most vigor. The result is that most f
these are now in effective state, and need
only to be manned and put in com mis
sion, to go at once into service. Some
of the new sloops authorized by Con-
cress are already in commission, and
most of the remainder are launched
and wait only the completion of ma
chinery to enable them to take their
places as part of our effective force. Two
iron torpedo ships have been completed
during the last year, and four of our
large double-turreted iron clads are tin
dergoing repairs. When these are fin
ished, everything that is needful to our
navy, as now authorizeed, will be in
condition for service, and with the ad
vance in science, of torpedo warfare, the
American navy) comparatively small as
it is, will be found powerful for the pur
poses of a peaceful Nation.
LOUISIANA.
Your attention will be drawn to the
unsettled condition of affairs in some of
the Southern States. On the 14th of
September last, the Governor of Louis
iana called upon me, provided by the
Constitution and laws of the United
States, for aid in the suppression of do
mestic violence in that State. The call
was made in view of a proclamation is
sued on that day by D. B. Penn, stating
that he was elected Lieutenant Gover
nor in 1872, and calling npon the mili
tia of the State to arm, assemble and
drive from power the usurpers, as he de
signated the officers of the States Gov
ernment. On the next day I issued my
proclamation, and commanded the in
surgents to disperse within five days
from the date thereof, and subsequently
learned that on that day they had taken
forcible possession of the State House,
Steps were taken by me to support the
existing recognized State Government;
but before the expiration of the five
days, the insurrectionary movement was
practically abandoned, and the officers
of the State Government, with some
minor exceptions, resumed their powers
and duties.
Considering that the present State
Adminstration of Louisiana had been
the only government in that State for
nearly two years; that it has been tacitly
acknowledged and acquiesced in as such
by Congress, and more than once express
ly recognized by me, I regarded it as my
clear duty, when legally called upon fur
that purpose, to prevent its overthrow
by an armed mob under pretense of
fraud and irregularity in the election of
1S72.
I have heretofore, called the attention
of Congress to 'frhiwsubject, stating that
on account .of the frauds and forgeries
committed at said election, and because
it appears that the returns thereof were
never legally canvassed, it was impossi
ble to tell thereby who were chosen; but
from the best sources of information at
my command, I have always believed
the present State -officers received a ma
jority of the legal votes actually cast at
that election. I repeat what 1 said
in my special message of February
13, 1873, that in the event of no action
by Congress I must continue to recog
nize the government heretofore recog
nized by me.
BOUTHERN OUTRAGES.
I regret to say that with preparations
for the late elections a decided indica
tion appeared in some localities in the
Southern States, of a determination, by
acts of violence and intimidation, to de
prive citizens of the freedom of the bal
lot because of their political opinions.
Bands of men masked and armed made
their appearance;. White Leagues and
other societies were formed, large quan
tities of arms and ammunition were im
ported and distributed to these organiza
tions; military drills with menacing de
monstrations were held, and with all
these, murders enough were committed
to spread terror among those whose po
litical action was to be suppresed, if pos
sible, by these intolerant and criminal
proceedings. In some places colored la
borers were compelled to vote according
to the wishes ef their employers, under
threat! of dischagn If they acted other
wise, and there are too many instances in
which, when these threats were disre
garded, they were remorselessly executed
by those by whom they were made. I
understand that the Fifteenth Amend
ment to the Constitution mas made to
prevent this like state of things, end the
act of May 31. l!?70, with amendments,-!
was passed to enforce its provision, tlie
object of this being to guarantee to all
citizens the right to vote and to protect
them in the free-enjoyment of that right
enjoined by- the Constitution, to take
care that the laws be faithfully execu
ted; and convinced by undoubted evi
dence that violations of said act had
been committed, and tbat a widespread
and flagrant disregard of it was con
templated, the proper officers were in
structed to prosecute the offenders, and
troops were stationed at convenient
points to aid these officers, if necessary,
in the performance of their official du
ties. Complaints are made of this in
terfeence by Federal authority, but if
said amendment and act do not provide
for such interfence under the circum
stances as above stated, then they are
without meaning, force or eflect, and
the whole scheme of colored enfranchise
ment is worse than mockery and little
better than a crime. Possibly Congress
may find it due to truih and justice to
ascertain, by means of a committee,
whether the alleged wrongs to colored
citizens for political purposes were man
ufactured for the occasion. The whole
number of troops in the States of Louis
iana, Alabama, George, Flordia, South
Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Mary
land, and Virginia, at the times of elec
tion, were 4,082. This embraces the
garrisons of all the forts from the Dela
ware to the Gulf of Mexico.
THE ARKANSAS TROUBLE.
As Congress is now investigating the
political affairs of Arkansas, I have de
clined to interefcre with the subject.
Executive interference with the affairs
of a State is repugnant to public opin
ion, to the feeling of those who from
their ollicial capacity, must be used in
snch inlerjwsition, and to him or those
who must direct it. Unless most clear
ly on the side of the law such interfer
ence become a crime. With the law to
support it, it is condemned without a
hearing. I desire, therefore, that all
necessity for executive direction in local
affairs may become unnecessary and ob
solete. I invite the attention not only of Con
gress, hut of the people of the United
States, to the causes, and effects of these
unhappy qnestions. Is there not a dis
position on one side to magnify wrongs
and outrages, and on the other side to
belittle them or justify them? If pub
lic opinion could be directed to a cor
rect survey of what is, and to rebuking
wrong and aiding the proper authorities
in punishing it, a better state of feeling
would be inculcated, and the sooner we
would have that peace which would
leave the States free' indeed to regulate
their own domestic affairs. I believe
on the part of our citizens of the South
ern States the better part of them
there is a disposition to be law-abiding
and to do no violence, either to individ
uals or the laws existing; but do they
do right in ignoring the existence of
violence and bloodshed in resistance to
constituted authority? I sympathize
with their prostrate condition, and would
do all in my power to relieve them, ac
knowledging that in some instances
they have had most trying governments
to live under, and very oppressive ones
in the way of taxation for nominal im
provements, not giving benefits equal to
the hardships imposed. But can they
proclaim themselves entirely excusable
for this condition? They cannot. Vio
lence has been rampant in some locali
ties, and has further, been justified or
denial by those who could have preven
ted it.
The theory is raised that there is to
be no more interference on the part of the
flENERAI. OOVERMENT TO PROTECT OIT
IZENS
Within a state where the State author
ities fail to give protection. This is a
great mistake. While I remain Execu
tive all the laws of Congress and the
provisions of the Constitution, including
the amendments added thereto will be
enforced with vigor, without regret that
they should have added one jot or tittle
to the Executive duties and powers. Let
there be firmness in the discussion of
Southern questions ; the advocates of
both or all political parties giving hon
est, truthful reports of occurrences, or
denouncing the wrong and upholding the
right, and soou all will be well. Under
existing conditions the negro votes the
Republican ticket because he knows his
friends are of that party; many a good
citizen votes the opposite, not because he
agrees with the great principles of state,
which separate parties, but because gen
erally he is opposed to negro rule. This
is a most delusive cry. Treat the negro
as a citizen and voter, as he is, and
must remain and soon the parties will
be divided, not on the color line, but on
principles. Then we shall have no
complaint of sectional interferences.
THE REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENER
AL
Contains valuable recommendations re
lating to the administration of justice in
the Courts of the LTnited States, to which
I invite your attention. I respectfully
suggest to Congress the propriety of in
creasing tha number of Judicial Dis
tricts in the United States to eleven, the
present number being nine, and the
creation of two additional Judgeships.
The territory to be traversed by the
Circuit Judges is so great, and the bus
iness of the Courts to steadily increas
ing, that it is growing more and more
impossible for them to keep up with the
business requiring their attention.
Whether this would involve the ne
cessity of adding two more Justices of
the Supreme Court to the present num
ber, I submit to the judgment of Con
gress.
THE INDIANS.
The attention of Congress is invited
to the report af the Secretary of the In
terior, and to the legislation asked for
by him. TJie domestic interests of the
people are more intimately connected
with this department than with rithr of
the other departments of the (iovern
ment. Its duties have been added to
from time to time, until they have be
come so onerous that without the most
perfect system and order it will be im
possible for any Secretary of the Interior
to keep trace of all the official transac
tions having his sanction ami, done in
his name, and for which he ia held per
sonally responsible.
The policy adopted for the ninnnge-
nient of the Indian a flairs, known as the
peace policy, has been adhered to with
most beneficial results. It is hoped
that a few years more will relieve our
frontiers of Indian depredations. I com
mend the recomendation of the Secreta
ry for the extension of the homestead
laws to the Indian, and for some sort of
tcriitorial governmont for the 'Indian j
Territory. A great majority of the ill- j
dians occupying this territory are Ix-lie- j
ved t be incapnMe of maintaining their '
rights aiuiiist the uio-e riviiizi-d and en j
lightened man. Anv territorial form of
Goveriimet (riven them, therefore, should I
protect them in their homes and r
property for a eritd of at least twenty i
years, and before its final adoption J
should be ratified by a majority of those j
affected. j
The report of the Secretary of the In- ;
terior herewith attached, gives much in-
teresting statistical information, which!
I abstain from giving an abstract of, but
refer you to the rerort itself.
PENSIONS.
The act of Congress providing the
oath which pensioners must subscribe
before drawing their pensions cuts off
from the bounty a few survivors of the
war of 1812, residing in the Southern
Slates. I recomend the restoration of
this bounty to nil such. The number of
persons w hose names would be restored
to the list of pensions is not large.
They are all old pensioners, who could
have taken no part in the rebellion, and
the services for which they were awar
ded pensions were in defense of the
whole country.
THE CENTENNIAL.
The report of the Commissioner, of
Agriculture, herewith, contains sugges
tions of much interest to the general
public, and refers to the approaching
Centennial, and the rart his depart
ment is ready to take in it. I feel that
the Nation at large is interested in hav
ing this exposition a success, and com
mend to Congress such action as wtll se
cure a greater general interest in it.
Already many foreign Nations have sig
nified their intention to be represented
at it. It may be expected that every
civilized Nation will be reprasented.
CIYir. SERVICE REFORM.
The rules adopted to improve the civ
il service of the Government have been
adhered to as closely as has been prac
ticable with the opposition with which
ihey meet. The eflect, I believe has
been beneficial on the whole, and has
tended to the elevation of the service,
but it is impracticable to maintain
them without the direct and positive
support of Congress. ( lenerally the sup
port which this reform receive! is from
those who gave it their support only to
find fault when the rules are apparently
departed from. Removals from office
without preferring charges against the
parties remov d are frequenaly cited as
departure from the rules adopted, and
the retention of those against whom
charges are made by irresponsible per
sons and without good grounds is also
often condemned as a violation of them.
Under these circumstances, therfore, I
announce -that if Congress adjourns
without positive legislation on the sub
ject of civil service reform, I will regard
such action as a disapprovl of the sys
tem, and will abanodon it. Except so
far as to roquire examination for cer
tain appointees, to determine their fit
ness, competitive examinations will be
abandoned. The gentlemen who have
given their service without compensa
tion, as members of the Board, to devise
rules and regulations for the govern
ment of the Civil Service of the coun
try. have shown much zeal and earnest
ness in their work, and to them, as well
as to myself, it will be a source of morti
fication if it is to be thrown away. Bu
I repeat that it is impossible to carry
this system to a successful issue withou
general approval and assistance, and
positive law to support it.
CHEAP TRANSPORTATION.
I have stated the elements of prosper
ity to the Nation's capital and labor
skilljd and untrained, and products, of
the soil, still remain with us. To direct
the employment of this is a problem de
serving the most serious attention of
Congress. If employment can be given
to all labor offering itself, prosperity ne
cessarily follows. I have expressed the
opinion, and repeat it, that the first re
quisite to the accomplishment of this
end is the substitution of a sound cur
rency in place of one of a fluctuating
value. This secured, there are man;
inierests that might be fostered, to the
great proht of both labor and capital
How to induce capital to employ labor
is the question. The subject of cheap
transportation has occupied (he attention
of Congress. New light on this ques
tion will, without doubt, lie given the
committee appointed by the last Con
gress to investigate and report npon the
subject.
A REVIVAL OF SHIP-BUILDING
And particularly of iron steamship
building is of vast vast importance to
our National prosperity. The United
States is now paying over $1,000,000,000
per annum for freights and passage on
foreign ships, to be carried abroad and
expended in the employment and sup
port of other people, beyond a fair per
centage of what should go to foreign
vessels, estimating ou the tunnage and
travel of each respectively. It is tu be
regretted that this disparity in the carry-
idg trade exists, and to correct it
would be willing to see a great departure
from the usual course of the Govern
ment in supporting what might be usual
ly termed private enterprise. I would
not suggest as a remedy direct subsidy
to American steamship lines, but I
would suggest the direct offer of ample
compensation for carrying the mails be
tween Atlantic and sea-board cities and
the Continent on American owned and
American built steamers, and would ex
tend this liberality to vessels carrying
the mails to the South American States,
and to Central American and Mexico
and would pursue the same policy from
our Pacific seaports to foreign seaports on
the Pacific. It might be demanded that
vessels built for this service should come
up to a stsndard fixed by legislation,
tonnage and speed, and all other qualit
ies looking to the possibility of the Gov
ernment requiring them at some time for
war purposes. The right also of taking
possession of them in such emergency
should be guarded. I .offer these sug
gestions, believing them worthy of con
sideration, in ail seriousness, aflectingall
sections and all interests alike. If any
thing better can be done to direct the
country. into a course of general prosiwr
ity no one will be more ready than 1 to
adopt this plan.
THE MOUTH OK THE MISKIHHIPri.
In accordance with Section 3 of the
act approved June 23, 1874. I appoint
ed a board to make a survey of the
mouth of the Mississippi Kiver, with a
view to determine the best method of
obtaining ard maintaining a depth of
water sufficient for the purpose of
commerce, Ac, and in accordance with
an act entitled "An act to provide for
the appointment of a commission of en
gineers to investigate and report a per
manent plan for the excavation of the
alluvial basin of "the Mississippi Kiver
subject to inundation," I appointed a
commission of engineer. Neither board
has yet completed its labor. When ita
reports are received thry will be for
warded to Cong res without delay.

The Commissioner of Indian A flairs
bropose a novel plan for the manage
ment of the affair of the Indian Bur
eau. He put down in his recent rrport
the total number of vagrant Indian
who are naturally disposed to make
trouble at 14,000. He ayt the employ
ment of troop to keep these in subjec
tion destroy the crop and stock of the
peaceably disposed Indians and thus en
rage them and incite them to disorder.
Hi plan is to withdarw the military al
together, and employ a posse of friendly
Indian to keep the other in subjection,
which, he thinks, can easily be done.
The government would gladly adopt
uch a measure if if could be carried out
successfully j but there would hardly be
many applicant for position on the In
dian Bureau until the feasibility of the
Ian could be practically demonstrated
