The AIeage.
President Cleveland's last annual
message to Congress is a lengthy one,
yet it is characteristic of the man
It deals in a straightforward manner
witlt many public questions of great
import.
He does not modify his position
on the tariff question nor does he
dispairof the ultimate triumph of
the principles of tariff reduction.
The President enters a strong pro
test against the idea that claims
houlJ be allowed that are "support
ed no better consideration than the
wealth of the Government and the
poverty of the claimants," and he
insists that public needs and neces
sities should be the criterion of ex
penditures on public buildings and
other improvements.
. Belief to the overcrowded business
of the Supreme Court ; la ws to prevent
the spoliation of public lands and
their diversion to other uses than
that of homes for honest settlers;
further reform in Indian adminis
tration; tbe erection of Federal
prisons for United States convicts
and of Post Office building at the
National Capital are among the min
or recommendations of general in
terest
That private or local interests
should not prevail against the public
good is Cleveland's theorem, which
he undertakes to illustrates not only
by his argument about tax and tar
iff, but also by his rigorous conten
tion for the substitution of general
for special legislation at a time when
"front century's height we view
tbe war already trod by the Amen
can people and attempt to discover
their future path," The foresha
dowing of such a progress Cleve
land discerns in the declaration of
Andrew Jackson for "a plain ay
tern, devoid of pomp, protecting a!
and granting favors to none."
, Our foreign relations are disposed
of by the statement that all pend
ing difficulties are capable of satis
factory adjustment. Nothing is
added to the expieasious of former
messages respecting Canadian or
British questions, excepting with re
gard to Lord Sackrille s "unjurdon
able conduct in his interference with
tbe suffrage of American citizens
and his subsequent public declara
tions impugning the Executive aud
Senate of the Lnited States in con
nection with important questions
now pending in controversy between
the two governments.
, A revision of the naturalization
and passport laws so as to give more
perfect protection to citizens abroad,
while preventing abuse of the privi
leges of citizenship, and "such a re
organization uf the consular fee ser
vice as will abolish perquisites," are
additional suggestions not upeeifi
calif included in departmental re
ports already published.
Tbe People' Hat lie.
from the President's message:
There should be no cessation of the
struggle ontila plan is perfected,
fair conservative towards existing
industries, but which will reduce the
cost to consumers of the necessarie
of life, while it provide for our
manufacturer the advantageof freer
raw materials and permit no injury
to the interests of American labor.
The cause for which the battle is
waged is compried within lines
clearly and dist'netly defined. It
should never be compromised. It is
the people's cause.
Tbe Art Amateur
For December is tbe finest number
ever published of this excellent ma
gazine. Twocharming colored plates
are given woodland winter land
scape with man and dog trudging
homeward just as the sun has set,
and "Hearts are Trumps," a dainty
young woman in an evening dress
of blue tulle, playing cards. The
black-and-white designs include a
beautiful female head for plaque de
coration, a large and striking com
position of "Shrike and BlackUr
lies," an adm'rable thistle design for
vase decoration, a charming figure
design -"The Music Lesson" -after
Watteau, for tapestry painting, and
fine embroidery designs for a cush
ion and a piano stool. Articles of
especial interest are those on "A
Model New York Home" (finely
illustrated) Louis vjuinze decoration,
artwork in jade, gifts in painted
china and photographic Christmas
cards. Flower pointing, tapestry
painting, Royal Worcester decora
tion and wood carving are among
the practical topics particularly dis
cussed. Amateur photography re
ceives much attention, and the vari
ous editorial departments are vigor
ously maintained. It is a marvel
that so much can be given for the
small sum of thirty-five cents.

Musical Organizations,
One of the most refining influ
ences in any community, or in bo
ciety, is music. It elevates the
tastes of the people who practice it.
W e see that it is proposed to organ
ize a musical association in unar-
utte. We are glad to hear this.
Chailotte has some exceptionally
fine talent and in a well directed or
ganization would reflect great credit
upon her citizens.
Durham long ago took a step in
this direction. The St. Cecilia So
ciety, of this place, is a musical or
ganization of which not only Dur-
hamites but the people of fte whole
State should feel a just pride in.
The School of Music here is just as
efficient as any in the State.
The Recordeb would rejoice to
see a musical organization in every
town, and also a State organization.
What say the lovers of music in
North Carolina? We would like to
hear from them and the State Press
on this proposition, speak out,
brethren. 1 et'a hare it!

He offered an amendment to the
obacco section, reducing the limit
of the claim for rebate from $10 to
$5. Rejected. He offered another
removing from all internal revenue
statutes all provisions fixinc the
minimum of penalty and leaving the
matter to the discretion of the court.
This was rejected by a strict party
vote. Another, which was rejected
without division, providing that no
warrant shall be iisued in cases of
internal revenue offences, except on
affidavit of the collector or deputy
collector or revenue agents; and that
no fees shall be paid by the govern
ment unless there by a conviction or
unless the prosecution shall have
been approved by the United States
District Attorney. ""Various other
amendments to the internal revenue
statutes were offered by Mr. Vance,
and were rejected.

It is gratifying to learn that tne
shock, to the credit of Durham, has
rebounded . alantt without injury ;
certainly none of a permanent ch r

fraternal community of interests
which binds the people together as
one, When one is hurt, all eympa
thizi and gather together to bind upj
tbe wounds ot tbe eon ring, in tne
current disaster, we learn that Mr. J.

rangements for the general relief,
which has I een Riven, and business
is going as if it bad not met a shock,
which would have overturned almost

Ignorance and Prejudice.
The Evening Post, of Hartford,
Conn., savs that "the trouble with
the Democrats of the south has been
and is now, that tbey wish to make
their local questions national ones,"
The "Democrats of the south
wish to do nothing, of the kind. Our
people have never yet attempted or
desired to can y their local affairs
into national politics. It has been
and is, quite the reverse. The Poet
displays a total ignorance of the sen
timents of the southern people and a
busy brain to manufacture opinions
to suit Us own peculiar notions. It
is such papers as the Post that seek
to inject local affairs into national
questions. Let a worthless scala
wag come down here one the Post
would not deign to countenance,
intermeddling with its local busi
ness affairs and friendly relations
between its people let him come
down here and seek to revolutionize
our affairs, and let our people say
they don't want such a s;amp among
tbem; see how quick the Post, and
papers of its eke, jump onto these
local matters and endeavor to make
a national thing of it. No, sir; the
trouble is with you fellows rou
don't know what you are talking
about. It's ignorance. Ignorance of
the situation and the facts concern
ing rs. The south is just as loyal
to the government as the north is
and will go just as far, if not farth
er, to preserve the peace and dignity
of the Union.
Get out of the darkness of your
blinded partisanship aod bitter pre
judices into the broad light of fra
ternal feeling, and the right of peo
ple to Manage their local affairs, and
you will probably not be so quick to
make t national thing of a local
matter, and abuse peophand things
o! which you duplav such gross
ignorance.

The Senate has now under con
sideration a tariff bill. We notice
that Senator Vance is wstcbin the
proceedings with it keen eye and has
hot in several amendments, but it
has been like throwing pin darts
against ft brick wall. The Ilepubli-
can side of the House has been solid
ly against him. So far as we have
seen only one amendment has been
agreed to without division, and that
provides that when tbe health or
