Without Least
Friction.
Constantinople, Dec. 17. With the
meeting of the first Ottoman parlia
snent today, Turkey formally breaks
front the despotic rule of centuries.
The sultan, who granted the constltu
tlon last July, provided for this a
embly which paraded through the
city at the head of an elaborate cor
tege to open the first session. Every
where he was greeted with loud cheer'
tng and there was no semblance of
disorder.
The sultan opened the Parliament
In person, with elaborate ceremonies
fashioned after the customs of older
Similar assemblies. The new legis
lature met in the same room where
the short lived Parliament of 1876
sxssmbled and the scenes were per
haps the most remarkable in the po
litical history of the world.
All creed and races in the Turkish
empire sent duly elected representa
tives and the many, varl-costumed
delegates, some in flowing silk robes
and others in fashionable frock coats
formed a gorgeous and multi-colored
picture, such as never before witness
ed In a legislative gathering in Eu
rope. '
Albanians, Syrians and Arabs were
among the Moslem representatives,
while Greeks, Armenians and Bul
garians represented the Christian na
tionalities. Members from Jerusalem
end Mecca rubbed shoulders with
their colleagues from the European
countries and far-off Kurdish, Ar
menian and Arabaian districts on the
confines of the Indian ocean.
So far as can be Judged from sur
face Indications, the new Parliament
baa entered upon its duties with a
determination to carry out successful
ly the alms of the bloodless revolu
tlon, which has made possible the
Inauguration of a constitutional
regime in Turkey.
WORKMAN KILLED
BY ROCK FROM BLAST
lie Stood Ik-hind a Small Ilut.li With
His Back to tlie Spot Where
the Blast Was Fired.
The first fatality to happen on the
Albuquerque Eastern railroad since
the beginning of the construction
work last October, occurred Satur
day noon when a rock from a large
blast struck Pedro Alejando in the
back of the head, causing Instant
death. Alejandro was the flrer of
the charge and contrary to rules,
stood behind a small bush about 800
feet away from the explosion, with
his back to the scene.
It is the custom of those in the
neighborhood of the locations where
blasting Is being done, that. t
warning cry from one of their party
when a shot is to be fired, all seek
n open spot where they may see
the spot being blasted, ana ll neces
sary dodge any missile which may
come their way. In this instance the
victim not only sought a small bush
for protection, but stood with his
back to the blast. In this position
he was unable to see a large, sharp
cornered rock measuring about one
fO'-t iiiart which timfd .reci'i for
his he d rcTcxin a larre part of
his skull.
Arrangements were made to take
the body to Santa Fe, his former
home.
TO ABANDON BIO HOTEL.
Chicago, Dec. 17. Plans for aban
doning the Auditorium hotel have
been decided upon by the board of
directors of the Congress Hotel com
pany, operating the Auditorium and
Annex. All the business of the two
big hotels on Michigan boulevard is
to be concentrated in the Annex,
which recently was enlarged to double
Its former capacity.
President Southgate asserted that
the Auditorium hotel had been los
ing money for years. He asserted
that it did not pay 1 per cent on the
money Invested and that it was poor
property compared with the new An
nex, which.' he asserted, was paying
In stockholders $250,000 a year.

EAGLE IS GIVEN
LONG SENTENCE
Murderer Will Be Sent to IVnileii-
tlary for Twewty Years.
.Apparently happy -that 'It was not
more, Dkk Eagle, convicted of mur
der In the second degree, yesterday
afternoon accepted the sentence of
twenty years in the penitentiary with
the same dogged composure with
which he watched the trial that
might have landed him at the end
of a rope had the Jury not believed
that he was drunk when he shot a
Pueblo Indian boy at Bluewater last
May.
"Thank you. Judge," he said when
the court had finished. With this
brief remark he returned with the
deputy sheriff to the county Jail to
await the trip to Santa Fe.
A few y-t'urs ago Eagle worked as
a barber in a shop on South Second
street In the block south of the post
office. He claimed to be a doctor
and, it Is said, practiced with his
magic medicine among the native
people both here and in Oklahoma.
He told Judge Abbott that hunting
gold and hording cattle were other
vocations he had followed during hia
life time. His high forehead, straight
nose and flowing black hair gave
him a queer appearance which prob
ably caused a feeling of awe among
the Ignorant natives and Indians and
helped him ply his trade with gain.
The authorities of the territory
have become convinced that Eagle is
either not right mentally or else a
fakir. He might be both. On no oc- I
caslon since his coming to the terri
tory, has there been an unexplalnable
robbery In the territory that Dick
Eagle has not written the authorities
that he knew where the robbers were
hiding, and that he would expose
them or that he knew where they
had hidden the mon y. On one or
two occasions he was successful in
getting persons to believe his wild
dreams.
Kagie claims to be a Cherokee In
dian. His conversation, ( he Is al
ways ready to talk) In Enttllsh, al
ways contained either Cherokee or
Navajo Indian words. While he
lived several years prior to his sr
rest with the Navajo Indians and It
Is believed sold them whiskey, he
considered the tribe as a whole, his
enemy. This was the cause of the
killing of the Indian boy, for which
he was sentenced.
According to his story told on the
witness stand, he was driving along
the road in the Zunl mountains one
evening just at sunset. An Indian
halted him with a word of chal
lenge. Eagle made the gutteral
sound the Indian made. He asked
the man if he was a Navajo. The
latter said, "no." and Eagle gave
him a drink. Taking the bottle from
his lips, the Indian asked what dif
ference it made, whether he was a
Navajo or a Cherokee. He said that
the Cherokees were copper-colored,
w hich Eagle Interpreted to mean cow
ardly. The man reached for his
knife and Eagle attempted to shoot
the weapon from his hand. He
stumbled as he shot and the bullet
made a mortal wound.
While In the county Jail Eagle had
a number of strange dreams, so he
said. One of them wss that he was
visited by a strange being in the form
of a man, large of stature, wearing
a blue robe.
TRAIN IS DELAYED
BY ARIZONA FLOOD
Illgh Water Is lie ported In the Terri
tory With Much Damage at
Several Places. -
Passenger ' train Mo. i due this
morning at 7:55 o'clock, had not
reached the city at 3 o'clock this
afternoon, and the Indications at that
hour were that it would not get in
before midnight. If then, owing to
heavy rains and subsequent wash
outs In Southern Arizona.
On account of the wash-outs being
west of Winslow, Aria., the first di
vision point west, very little informa
tion regarding the damage done to
railroad property could be had at the
local Banta Fe offices.
It rained all Tuesday and Wednes
day In Central Arizona and in the
southern part of the territory there
was considerable rain on Monday also.
The Santa Fe tracks are said to be
badly damaged on the San Francisco
mountains. The Salt river valley is
flooded and the town of Roosevelt
near the Rooosevelt dam is partly
submerged. This latter Information
came in a private telegram last night.
Considerable damage has been done
by water In the vicinity of Phoenix.
A report received this afternoon
was to the efTect that the water at
Clear creek, sixteen miles from Wins
low, In a deep rock ennyon. was fifty-,-e
,.--.t fl inve l"w water mark
last night and that the Santa Fe
pumping station there was badly
damaged.
WASHINGTON GLAD
IT IGNORED CASTRO
Now Lite IN'ojde of Venezuela Have
No Feeling AgainHt the United
States.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 17. The
riotous demonstrations In Caracas are
a surprise to the officials at Wash
ington, who generally expected that
any demonstration of hostile act
by the foreign power against Ven
ezuela would result in solidifying the
people and rallying them to Presi
dent Castro and his government.
The common belief here Is that
United States had taken forceful
steps against Venezuela, Castro would
have become a hero in the eyes of the
people there. It Is possible for this
reason that the administration has
been Indifferent in pushing demands
for a settlement. The department
felt that the Venezuela situation
would gradually work Itself out. For
this reason there has been a persist
ent determination to Ignore Castro
and look with equanimity on the do-
i ings of the foreign governments in an
effort to get satisfaction, so long as
there was no Interference with Amer
ican interests and no violation of the
Monroe doctrine.

from the public until it was made
known at Thaw's trial.
INDIANAPOLIS NEWS
ALSO MAKES REPLY
Says ltooMr-velt Makes Exhibition of
Towering Kajre to ll e Chagrin
of ttoi.
Indianapolis, Dec. 17. The In
dianapolis News,- edited uy Delevan
Smith, to whom President Roosevelt
referred in his Panama statement in
connection with the New York World
makes reply to the president in the
following language:
"It is difficult to characterize fully
me raieei ouioreaK oi ine presiueni
without resorting to the use of lan
guage as undignified ' and blame
worthy as that which put the presi
dent's utterance in a class by It It In
the official literature of the high of
fice he holds. Whatever provocation
Mr. Roosevelt may have felt pricking
his soul, nothing could Jutlfy or ex
tenuate the torrent or Invective and
virulence which he poured out in a
state paper upon the heads of private
citizens. No one in his sober senses
can fall to regard the performance an
a grave derogation to the dignity of
the presidential station, a pitiable
exhibition of toweraging rage on the
part of the chief, magistrate and the
source of humiliation nd chagrin
to the entire country. It Is quite Im
possible to think of any of Mr. Roos
evelt's long line of distinguished
predecessors that could possibly have
so far forgotten the dignities and
decencies of his exalted position km
to transmit to Congress a message
in any way comparable with that of
yesterday.
"Denunciation and Wtterneso of
speech are no explanation and no an
swer. Atwumption that the New York
World and its proprietor were Influ
enced by base or unworthy motives
In the publication of the reports
touching the Panama afTalr can not
be justified no matter who may be
the person that makes It."
COAL SUPPLY DWINDLES.
New York, Dec. 17. That the en

tion made by Prof. William Griffith,

cite coal carrying railroads for illegal

Dominion Construction Com

at Work on the
Centr ii.
FINISH THE LINE
BY KEXf
It Is Expected Trnt Road From
morlarty to Hagan Will be In
Use by April and the
Rest Will be Fin
ished Soon.
With a force of nearly 400 men
and 146 teams, the Dominion Con
struction company is rapidly pushing
the construction of that part of the
New Mexican Central railroad which
will connect Albuquerque with the
coal field at Hagan and later with
the main line of the New Mexico
Central at Morlarty. The progress
made in construction since the work
was begun several weeks ago leads
to the belief that the road will be
completed between Morlarty and
Hagan by April 1, 1909.
il tails have been laid for a distance
of five miles west from Morlarty to
ward Frost Junction, where the
branch to Hagan starts. When this
part of the line Is completed the
shipping of coal will begin, and it Is
the intention of the road to then push
the remainder of the work, com
pleting the line into Albuquerque.
The construction of the line. How
ever, Is being actively pushed at sev
eral points. The roadbed has been
completed out of Albuquerque to
Camp Garcia, near the Trimble ranch
on the mesa. At Camp Garcia are
1 4 men and 1 i U aim. They are
building a trestle west of the camp,
the aid of a pile driver being neces
sary. Grading outfits are working to
ward Frost from Camp Garcia and!
Makes show the line the road will
fellow through TIJeras canyon. Res
ident Engineer J. R. Farwell and a
party of surveyors are working be
tween Garcia and Frost.
Eighty men and 5 teims are at
Camp Frost and the work there Is
progressing rapidly. At station No.
287, twelve men and twelve teams
are at work and the roadbed from
frost to Hagan will soon be com
pleted. Much engineering work is
being done and the construction be
tween Frost and Hagan will be some
what difficult, requiring the chang
ing of the course of a creek In sev
eral places, filling and cutting. At
San Pedro, the largest camp between
FroBt and Hagan, much blasting Is
being done.
That part of the road between Mo
rlarty and Frost is about completed,
und steel laying Is in progress. The
camp will soon be moved to within a
few miles of Garcia and the work on
this end of the line will be given an
Impetus. It is expected that greater
activity on the Albuquerque Eastern
end of the road will begin about Jan
uary 1.
The forces at San Pedro camp, be
tween Frost and Hagan, consists of
111 men and 33 teams. Engineer P.
Doodrldge and eight assistants are
tnere In charge of the work. This
force will be augmented either today
or tomorrow by the arrival of Daniel
Sweeney, a contractor from Oklahoma
and a force of 100 men and 42
teams. Mr. Sweeney has been given
the contract for the construction of
the six miles of road between Hagan
and San Pedro and will start work
Immediately on arrival.
H. E. Culberson, general manager
of the Dominion Construction com
pany, says that the work will be
pushed as rapidly as possible. It is
hoped to have the entire road In op
eration by next summer and at the
rate of progress now this can be
done. R. J. Vanstan, superintendent
of construction, says that Albuquer
queans can travel out of their city
on the Central by the latter part of
the summer.
While the construction company is
giving the greatest attention Just
now to thut part of the road between
Morlarty and Hagan, in order to get
out coal from Hagan as quickly as
possible, there is activity all along
,the line. The various camp forces
are steadily extending the roadbed in
the course mapped out by the sur
veyors and as there are no partic
ularly difficult feats to be performed,
the work will probably make rapid
progress.
The men employed In the work are
well housed, each camp having a
number of houses where the
are sheltered. Fresh meat
gangs
biead,
fruit, vegetables, etc., form the menu
and the force is contented.
