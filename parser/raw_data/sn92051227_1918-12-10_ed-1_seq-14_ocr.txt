ment from war to peace conditions
now under way In the Industrial
world, the stock market still moves
irregularly, with cross-currents of li
quidation and special advances where
there may exist specific reasons for
higher levels. This mixed fluctuation
la expected) to last until the bases of
business ehall have reached a more
table position. Meantime, the stock
liflt aa a whole may remain in a trad
ing ranee near present prices, await
ing changes in the tAg trades.
Money conditions after the turn of
: the year are expected to display Im
provement. By that time some of the
large pending government transac
tions will have been concluded, the
Interior return of funds to New Tork
; will have been -passed, and the eni
i of-year disbursements will have taken
; piece. Release of funds is taking

, rles In the tendency toward getting

I for reconstruction work. Investment
funds are therefore naturally accu
mulating In ironey circles, and may
J be expected to seek employment ii
the Stock Exchange market.

Oiptimism Is expressed toy the Na
tional City Bank of New York in its
latest circular on financial conditions
saying that business readjustment
should not cause alarm. "It 1 not
possible," it says, "to doubt that a
; great period of prosperity awalt3 the
country as soon ae the readjustments
to a peace basis are made, and In our
are not cuch as to occasion alarm.
The situation Is inherently strong.
Stocks of goods of all kinds are low
all over the world, and people have
been economizing In purchases until
their needs are pressing. This coun
try could have had a great foreign
trade during the last year despite
btgh prices, but for the eiribargoes
and shortage of shipping. Construc

fmany, the greatest steel exiporter Be
fore the war, has exported none Hor
four years. Belgium and France, also
exporter of steel, have sold none in
the some time, and England's sales
tiave been greatly reduced. These ar
rearages naturally must ibe made up.
The demands of Europe - upon the
- European supply will e so great that
the other markets will have to look
largely to the United States for early
attention. IPu'rthermore, this coun
try's capacity to absorb Iron and steel
is very great, and there is unques

waiting."

"War Department, following that in the
j dipper trade prior thereto, may foe de
pended upon to be duplicated in his
latest responsible positions. Uhe cop

experience and progressive policies In
a 'belief that the reconstruction of

Message to Con-gress, Indicating that
the Administration would not advo
cate Government ownership for the
railroads, Is favorably received in in
vestment circles. It Is exipected that
fairer treatment will be accorded the
transportation systems when they are
returned to private ownership, and
that the outcome, while entailing
broader Federal control, will be ben
eficial to security holders aa well as
nippers. It would seem tat the fu
ture is (brighter for the raitroaiilB than
(or many yeans past, and we believe
tacks of leading companies whose
arnlng provide sulbstantlal margins

tractive tmylng opportunities on mar

The spirit of service that enabled
par country and Its Allies to win the
rae is certain to be operative in solv
ing the problems of peace, Including
those vital issues between cepital and
labor. It Is reported that large re
COet miction orders for account of
Wanes and Belgium are already be
ing negotiated! through Washington.
This is a forerunner of what may be
xxieoted. If leading commercial Na
tions will observe the natural laws of
ntpply and demand in readjustment
period a great period of prosperity Is
oonsidered almost certain afterward.
The belief seems to be quite general
that the business readjustment In the
United States will take from three to
our. months. It should (be remain
bered that the stock market begins to
discount broad developments of this
character some time in adlvance.

FOR THE PUBLIC
TO CONSIDER . . .
About 90 per cent, of the adult population of this community
depends on the street cars for transportation to and from work or
business.
The public expects cars to be on time, equipment to be kept
up, service to be rapid and dependable, employes to be courteous and
officials to be approachable and open to suggestions.
The public also wants the greatest possible service at the low
est possible cost.
The continued growth and prosperity of this community are
dependent on the ability of The Connecticut Company to maintain its
property and increase its facilities proportionately to the increase in
population. - ---
It cannot maintain its property and increase its facilities un
less its lines produce sufficient revenue to pay the bills.
In 1916 the increase in cost to The Connecticut Company of
serving the public was $72,000 greater than the increase in revenue.
In 1917 the increase in cost exceeded the increase in revenue by
$810,000.
The ten months ending Oct. 31, 1918, during which the six cent
fare has been in effect, show a net loss from operating of $506,000.
Please think it over, you business men whose prosperity keeps
pace with the development of your community, and you workers and
shoppers who depend on the trolley cars for transportation.
