WASHINGTON,
able
.. tlons
Dec. 6.—Following is
the text of President Harrison's mes­
sage to congress:
To the Senate and House of Representa
jMStlves:
|y In submitting my annual message to
eongresB I have great satisfaction in be
:lng
to
say that the general coadi-
affectiagthe commercial and indus
Mai interests of the United States are in
the
highest degree favorable.
A
compar-
the existing conditions with those
the most favored period in the history
the country will, I believe, show that
so
high a degree of prosperity and so geu
|s eral a diffusion of the comforts of life
were never before enjoyed by our people.
Wealth of the Country.
Iljpterhe total wealth of the country in 1960
Was $16,159,616.H68. In 1890 it amounted
to $62,610,000,000, an increase of 287 per
.cent.
S The total mileage of railways in the
a United States in I860 was 3l),6'!« in 1890 if.
was 167,741, an increase of 448 per cent.:
and it is estimated that there will be
about 4,000 miles of track added by the
close of the year 1892.
The official returns of the Eleventh cen­
sus
and those of the Tenth census for 75
leadhog cities furnished the basis for the
folkftTOJg comparisons:
In 1880 the capital invested in manufac­
turing was
$1,233,839,670.
In 1890 the capital invested in manufac­
turing was $2,900,735,884.
ttn 1880 the number of employes was
1,901,3%.
In 1890 the number o* employes was
:S,e5i,134.
In 188Q. the wages earned were $501,965,
778.
In 1890 the wages earned were $1,221,170,
464.
In 1880 the value of the product was $2,
711,579,899.
In 1890 the value of the product was $4,
860,286,837.
Iam informed by the superintendent
of the census that the omission of cer­
tain industries in 1880 which were in­
cluded in 1890 accounts in part of the re­
markable increase thus shown, but after
making full allowances for differences of
-method and deducting the returns for all
.'Industries not included in the census of
1880, there remain in the reports from
.these seventy-five cities an increase in the
'capital employed of $1,522,745,604 in the
^•alue of the product of $2,024,236,166 in
wages earned of $677,943,929, and in the
number of wage earners employed of
856,029. The wage earnings not only
nhow an increased aggregate, but an in­
crease per capita from $386 in 1880 to $547
in 1890 or 41.71 ner cent..
Growth of Industrial Plants.
The new industrial plantB established
•lnceOct. 6, 1890, and up to Oct. 22, 1892,
a8 partially reported in the American
Economist, number 345,and the extension
^existing plants 108 the new capital in­
vested amounts to $40,449,050, and the
Dumber of additional employes to 37,
288.
The Textile World fur July, 1892, states
that during the first six months of the
present
calendar year 13S new factories
were
built,
the
of which 46 are cotton mills,
4& knitting mills, 27 woolen mills, 15 silk
£lla.
4 pltwh mills and 2 linen mills. Of
b« 40 cotton ills 21 have been built in
Southern states. Mr. A. B. Shep-
hkwon. of
the New York Cotton Ex-
Change,
estimates the number of working
apindles
in
the United States on Sept. 1,
1609, at 15,900,000, an increase Of C6(,000
iver the year
1891. The consumption of
by
American mills in 1891 was
30,000 bales,
and in 1892, 2,584,000 bales,
itusreaie of
188,000 bales. From the

of Sept. 80, 1892, there were
y-two companies manufacturing tin
atlterne

I
state emoracea witum one special inquiry
made by him, and representing 67 differ­
ent industries, there was a net increase
over the year 1890 of $31,315,130.68 in the
value of the product, and of $0,377,025.09
in the amount of wages paid.
The report of the commissione.- of labor
for the State of Massachusetts shows that
3,745 industries in that state paid $12 ),
416,248 in wages during the year IB!)!,
against $126,(130,303 in 1891, an increase of
$3,335,915. and that there was pn increase
of 932,490 in the amount of capital, and
of 7,346 in the number of persons em­
ployed in the same period.
Tlie Iron Output.
During the last six months of the year
1891 and the first six months of 189:2 the
total productiou of pig irov was 9,710,819
tons, as against 9,209,703 tons iu he year
18W, wnicn was tne largest annual pro
duction ever attained. For the same
twelve months of 1891-92 the production
of Bessemer ingots was 3,878,581 tous, an
increase of 189,710 gross tons over
the previously unprecedented yearly
production of 3,688,871 gross tons in 1891.
The production of Bessemer steel rails for
the first six months of 1892 was 772,430,
gross tons, as against 702,080 gross tons
during the last six months of the year
1891.
Our Foreign Trade.
The total value of our foreign trade
(exports and manufactures) during the
last fiscal year was $1,857,680,610, an in
crease of $128,283,604 over the previous
.fiscal year. The average annual value of
ourimports and exports of merchandise
for the ten fiscal years prior to 1891 was
$1,457,322,019. It will be observed that
our foreign trade for 1893 exceeded this
annual average value by $400,358,591, au
increase of 27.47 per cent. The signific­
ance and value of this increase are hu-wn
by the fact that the excess in the trade of
1892 over 1891, was wholly in the value of
exports, for there was a decrease in the
value of imports of $17,513,754.
The value of our exports during the
fiscal year 1892 reached the highest figure
in the history of the government amount­
ing to $1,030,278,148 exceeding by $145,797
838 the exports of 1891 and exceeding tlie
value of the imports by $202,875,686.
Value of Exports.
A comparison of the value of our ex­
ports for 1892 with the annual average for
tne ten years prior to 1891 shows an excess
of $265,142,671, or of 34.65 per cent.
The value of our imports of merchan­
dise for 1892, which was $829,402,462, also
exceeded the annual average value of the
ten years prior to 1891 by $135,215,94'.
During the fiscal year 1892, the value of
imports free of duty amounted to $457,
999,658, the largest aggregate iu the his­
tory of ur commerce. The value of the
Imports of merchandise entered free of
duty in 189S was 55.35 per cent, of the
total value of imports, as compared with
43.35 per cent, in 1891, and 33.66 per cent,
in 1890.
The Coastwise Trade.
Iu our coastwise trade a most encour­
aging development is in progress, there
having been in the last four years an in­
crease of 16 per cent. In internal com­
merce the statistics show that no such
period of prosperity has ever before ex­
isted. The freight carried in the coast­
wise trade of the Great Lakes in 1890 ag­
gregated 28.296,959 tons.
Truffle on tlie Great Rivers.
On the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio
rivers and tributaries in the same year the
traffic aggregated 29,4^5,046 tons and the
total vessel tonnage passing through the
Detroit river during the year was 21,684,
000 tous. The vessel tonnage entered and
cleared in the foreign trade of London
during 1890 amounted to 13,480,767 tons,
and of Liverpool 10,941,800 tons, a total
for these two great shipping ports of 24,
422,568 tons, only slightly in excess of the
vessel tonnage passing through the De­
troit river. And it should be said that
the season of the Detroit river was but
228 days, while, of course, ia Loudon and
Liverpool, the season was for the entire
year. The aggregate traffic on our rail­
roads for the year 1891 amounted to 714,
898,609 tons of freight, compared with
091,344,437 tons in 1S9J, an increase of 13,
054,172 tone.
Another Indication of Prosperity.
Another
{ndication
of the general pros­
perity of the country is found iu the fact
that the number of depositors in savings
banks increased from 693.870 in 1-860 to

woria wnere me conditions ui ir. seem to
them hard would not be accepted as
highly pro' perous.
Believes in Protection.
I believe that the protective system,
which now for something like thirty
years has prevailed in our legislation, lias
been a mighty instrument for tlie devel­
opment of our national wealth, and a
most powerful agency in protecting the
homes of our workinymen from the inva­
sion of want. I have felt a most, solici­
tous interest to preserve to our working
people rates of wages that would not only
give daily bread, but supply a comfort­
able margin for those home attractions
and family comforts and enjoyments
without which life is neither hopeful nor
eweet.
It is not my purpose to renew here tlie
argument in favor of a protective tariff.
The result of the recent election must he
accepted as having introduced a new
policy. We must assume that the pre­
sent tariff, constructed upon the lines of
protection, is to be repealed and that
there is to be substituted for it a tariff
law constructed solely with reference to
revenue that no duty is to be higher be
oause the increase will keep open an
American mill or keep up the wages of an
American workman, but that iu every
case such a rate of duty is to be
imposed as will briug to the treasury
of the United States the largest returns
of revenue. The oontestB not bi-ing be­
tween schedules but between principles,
it would be offensive to suggest that the
prevailing party will not carry into legis­
lation the principles advocated bv it. »ml
ine pieages given to tlie people. The
tariff bills passed by the house of repre­
sentatives at. the last session were as 1
supposed, even in the opinion of their
promoters, inadequate, and justified only
by the fact that the senate and. house of
representatives were not iu accord and
that a general revision should not, there­
fore, be undertaken.
Let the Democratic Congress Attend to
Tariff Revision.
I recommend that the whole subject of
tariff revision be left to the incoming
congress. It is a matter of regret that,
this work must be delayed for at least
three months for the threat of great tariff
changes introduces so much uncertainty
that an amount not easily estimated, of
business in action and of diminished pro­
duction will necessarily result.
Those who have advocated a protective
tariff can well afford to have their dis­
astrous forecasts of a ohange of policy dis­
appointed. If a system of customs duties
can be framed that will set the idle wheels
aad looms of Europe iu motion and crowd
our warehouses with foreign made goods
and at the same time keep our own mills
busy that will give us an increased parti­
cipation in the "markets of the world" of
greater value than the home market we
surrender that will give increased work
to foreign workmen uponprodncts to bo
consumed by our people without dimin­
ishing the amount of work to be done
here that will enable the americau manu­
facturer to pay his workmen from 50 to
100 per cent, more in wages than is paid
in the foreign mill and yet to compete in
our market and.in foreign markets with
the foreign producer that w'll further ru
duce the cost of articles of wear and food
without reducing the wages of those who
produce them that can be celebrated,
after its effects have been realized, as it a
expectation has been in Europe as well as
in American cities, the authors and pro­
moters oi it will be entitled to the highest
praise.
Tlie Labor Question.
The now strained and too often dis
turbed relations existing between the
employe and the employers in our great
manufacturing establishments have not
been favorable to a calm consideration by
the wage earners of the effect upon wages.
The fasts that his wages were the highest
paid :n like callings iu the world, and
that a maintenance of this rate of wages,
in the absence of protective duties upon
the product of his labor was impossible,
were obscured by the passion evoked by
these contests. He may now be able to
review the question in the light of his
personal experience under the operation
of a tariff for revenue only. If that expe­
rience shall demonstrate that present
rates of wages are thereby maintained or
increased, either absolutely or iu their
purchasing power, and that the aggregate
volume of work to be done in this country
ia increased, or even maintained, so that
there are more, or as many days work in
a year at as good or better wages for the
American workingman as has been the
case under the protective system, every
one will rejoice. A general process of
wage reductions cannot be contemplated
by any patriotic citizen without the grav­
est apprehension.

$1,524,844,506 in 180J.
Plenty of Work at Good Wages
There never Has been a time in our his­
tory when work was so abundant or when
wages were as high, whether measured
by the currency on which they are oaid or
by their power to supply the necessarjes
and comforts of life. It is true that the
market prices of cotton and wheat have
been low. It is one of the
unfavorable incidents of agriculture that
the farmer cannot produce upon orders.
He must BOW and reap in ignorance of the
aggregate production of the year, and is
subject to the depreciatiou which follows
over-production. But, while the fact I
have stated is true, as to the crops men­
tioned, the general average of prices has
been such as to give to agriculture a fair
participation in the general prosperity.
The valueofour totalfnrm products has
increased from $1,363,646,866 in I860 to $4,
600,000,000 in 1891, as estimated by statis­
ticians, an increase of 280 per cent.

Executive Departments.
The reports of the heads of the several
executive departments which are here­
with submitted, have very naturally in­
cluded a resume of the whole work of the
administration with the transactions of
the last fiscal year. The attention not
only of congress but of the country is
again invited to th* methods of adminis­
tration which have been pursued and to
the. results which have been attained.
Public revenues amounting to $1,414,079,
292.28 have been^collected and disbursed
without loss from misappropriation,with­
out asingle defalcation 'of such import­
ance as.to attract the public attention,
aud at a diminished per cent of oost for
collection. The publio business has

Reciprocity Treaties.
There has been adjusted under section
8 v,f
the tariff law commercial agreements
relating to reciprocal trade with the fol­
lowing couutries: Brazil, Dominican re­
public, Spain for Cuba and Puerto Rico,
Guatemala, San Salvador, the German
empire, Great Britain for certain West
Indian colonies and British Guiana, Nicar­
agua, Honduras, and Austria-Hungary.
Of these, those with Guatemala, Sal­
vador, the German empire, Great Britain,
Nicaragua, Honduras and Austria-Hun­
gary have been concluded since my laBt
annual message. Under these trade ar­
rangements, a free or favored admission
has been secured in every case for an im­
portant list of American procucts. Espe­
cial care has been taken to secure
markets for farm products in order to
relieve that great industry long under
depression for the lack of an adequate
foreign market for our surplus produc­
tion, also for our manufactured produc­
tions, which will, if this policy is main­
tained, greatly augment our export trade.
The full benefits of these arrangements
cannot be realized instantly. New lines
of trade are to be opened. The commer­
cial traveler must survey the field. The
manufacturer must adopt his goods to the
new markets, and facilities for exchange
must be established.
Trade from South America.
If the present policy and these trade ar­
rangements can be continued In force
and aided by the establishment of Ameri­
can steamship lines, I do not doubt that
we shall, within a short period, secure
fully one-third of the total trade of the
countries of Central aud South America,
which now amounts to #3 i0,000,()00 an­
nually In 18S5 we had only 8 per cent of
this trade. The alarmed attention of our
European competitors 'or the South
American mjjj^et has beeu attracted to
the new American policy and to our
acquisition and their loss of South Amer­
ican trade.
The Hehrins Sea Mutter.
The president next reviews the Behring
Sea negotiations leading up to the treaty
of aibitration. with which all newspaper
readers are already familiar. He concludes
by saying he believes the United States
has a good case before the arbitration
committee.
In regard to the conference between the
Dominion of Canada and the United
States regarding closer made relatione
the president says, arier reciting tne pre­
liminary arrangements for the confer­
ence: The conference developed the faot
tbat the Canadian government was only
prepared to offer the United States, iu
exchange for the concessions asked, the
admission of netural products. The
statement was frankly made that fav­
ored rates could not be given to the
United States as against the mother
country. This admission, which was
foreseen, necessarily terminated the con­
ference upon this question. The benefits
of an exchange of natural products would
be almost vt holly with the people of Can­
ada.
Trade Relation* with Canada.
Speaking of trade relations with Can­
ada, the president says that a somewhat
radical revision should be made. Iu the
matter of canal tolls our treaty rights
have been flagrantly disregarded. Cana­
dian railroads compete for traffic without
the restraints of the interstate commerce
law, and their cars pass through our ter­
ritory almost without detention.
There is no disposition on the part of
the people or government of the United
States to interfere in the smallest degree
with the political relations of Canada.
That question is wholly with her own
people. It is time for us, however, to con­
sider whether, if the present state oi
things and trend of things is to continue,
oure*changes upon lines of land trans­
portation should not be put upon a differ­
ent basis, and,our entire independence oi
Canadian canals and of the St. Lawrence
as an outlet to the sea secured by the con­
struction of an American canal around
the Falls of the Yarmara, and the open­
ing of ship communication between the
Great Lakes and one of our owu seaports.
We should not hesitate to avail ourselves
of our great natural trade advantages.
We should withdraw the support which
is given to the railroads and steamship
lines of Canada by a traffic that properly
i.elongs to us, and to no Ionizer to furnish
the earnings which lighten the other­
wise crushing weight of the enormous
public subsidies that have been given to
them.
Chilnn and Italian Incidents.
The settlement of the Chilian and
Italian incidents is touched upon and
their satisfactory settlement noted by the
president. Several other minor foreign
incidents are also touched upon and in
most cases satisfactory settlement re­
corded. The specially friendly relations
with Hawaii are commented upon and
the need of cable commucicatiou with
that country is reiterated.

the
recommeiulation which I have made in
several previous messages that prompt
and aduquaie support be given to the
American company engaged in the con
Btrnction of the Nicaragua ship canal. It
ia impossible to overstate the value from
every stand point of this great enterprise
ahd I hope that there may be time, even
in this congiresa, to give to it an impetus
that will insure the early completion of
the canal

completed.
The Monetary Conffcrmwa.
Theoon jrrew ha* been already ridrfaed
Ms
me invitations ot this government
for the assembling of an international
monetary conl'crence to consider the
question of an enlarged issue ot silver
was accepted by the nations to which
they were issued. Tbe conference assem­
bled at Brussels on tbe 22nd of November,
and has entered upon the consideration of
this great question. I have not doubted,
and have taken occasion to express that
belief, as well in the invitations issued
for this conference as in my public mes­
sages, that the free coinage of silver upon
an agreed international ratio would
greatly promote the interests of our peo­
ple and equally those of other nutions. It
is too early to predict what results may
be accomplished by the conference. If
any temporary check or delay intervenes,
I believe that »ery soon commercial con­
ditions will compel the now reluctant
governments to unite with us in this
movement to secure the enlargement of
the volume of money needed for the tran­
saction of the business of the world.
OUR FINANCES.
Report of the Secretary of tho Treasury
Keviewed.
The report of the secretary of the trea­
sury wi!l attract especial interest in view
of the many misleading statements that
have been made as to the state of the pub­
lic revenues. Three preliminary facts
should not only be stated, but empha­
sized, before looking into details First,
that the public debt has been reduced
since March 4, 1889, $259,074,200, and the
annual intrests charges$ll,684,409 second,
that there have been paid out for pensions
during this administration up to Nov. 1,
1892, $432,564,178.70, an excess of SI 14,406,
385.09, over the sum expended during the
period from March 1, 18S5, to March 1.
1889: and third, that under the existing
tariff up to Deo. 1, about uinty-tbree mil­
lion dollars of revenue which would have
been collected upon imported sugars if
the duty had been maintained, has gone
into the pockets of the people and not into
the public treasury, as before. If there
are any who stil! think that the surplus
should have been kept out of circulation by
hoarding it in the treasury, or deposited
in favored banks without interest, while
the government continued to pay to these
very banks interest upon bonds deposited
as security for the deposits, or who think
that the extended pension legislation was
a public robbery, or that the duties upon
sugar should have been maintained, I
am content to leave the argument where
it now rests, while we want to see whether
these criticisms will take the form of leg­
islation
The public debt reduction for the year
was a little over forty millions and the
net loss of revenues of all kinds was over
thirty-three millions. The revenues for
the present fiscal year, estimated and
actual are placed at. four hundred and
sixty-three m.llions and the expenditures
two million less. The cash balance in the
treasury at the end of the year iB esti aiated
at twenty-one millions
In the recommendation of the secretary
that the sinking fund law be repealed I
concur. The retirement of bonds in the
future before maturity should he a mat­
ter of convenience not of compulsion. W
should not collect revenue for that pur
Dose. but on 1 use any casual surnlus
MiiKt Have Confidence iu Money
The public confidence In the purpose
and ability of the government to maintain
the parity of all our money issues, whether
coin or paper must remain unshaken
Iu view of he fact that the monetary
conference is now sitting, aad that uo
conclusion has as yet been reached. I
withhold any recommendation as to iegi?
lation upon the silver question.
MR. TRACY'S REPORT
Operations of the Navy Department Re­
viewed at Considerable Length.
The report of the secretary of the navy ex­
hibits great progress in tbe constroetlon of
our new navy. When the present eecreturv
entered upon his duties only three modern
steel vessels were in commission. The vessels
sinoe put in commlBSiou and to be put In com­
mission during the vi inter will make a total o'
nineteen daring his administration of the de
pnrtment. Daring the current year teD war
vessels and three navy lugs have been
launched, and daring the four years twenty
five vessels will have been launched. Twi
other large ships and a torpedo boat are un­
der contrect and tho work on them well ad­
vanced, and the four monitors are awaiting
only the arrival of their aimor, which bn»
been unexpectedly delayed, or they would
have been before this in commission.
Building Up tbe 17. S Navy.
Contracts have been let during this admin­
istration under the appropriations for tbe in­
crease of the navy, including uew vessels and
their appurtenances, to the auioant of $35..
000,000, and there has been expended during
the same period for tabor at navy yards apon
similar work S8,0Uu,000 without the smallest,
scandal or charge of fraud or uartiality. The
enthusiasm and interest of oar naval officers,
both of the stuff and line, have been greatly
kindled. They responded magnificently to
the confidence of congress and hare demon­
strated to the world an unexcelled capacity to
construot, in
ordnance and in everything In­

Secretary Tracy's administration several
difficult problems remained to be grappled
with and solved before the efficiency
in action of oar ships could be secured.
Looking After Accessories of War.""
It is believed that as the result of new
processes in the construct'on of
armor plate, our later ships will be olothe1
.with defensive plates of higher resist­
ing power than axe found oa any warvonsel
afloat. We were without torpedoes. Thr
tests have been made fo ascertaih the relative
efficiency. different

were without armor-pierciuu shells, and with­
out a shop constructed and equipped for the
construction of them. We are now making
what is believud to be a projectile superior tn
any before in use. A smokeless powder has
been developed, aud it slow burning powder
for guns of large caliber. A high explosive,
oapable of use in shells lired from service guns,
has been found, and the manufacture of gun
cotton has been developed 60 that the question
of supply is no longer in doubt.
Facts About the New Naval Militia.
Tho development of a naval militia, which
has been organized iu eight Htates and brough'.
into cordial and co-operative relation witi.
the navy, is another important achievement.
There are now enlisted in these organizations
1,800 men. and they are likely to be
greatly extended. I recommend Buch legisla­
tion and appropriations as wtll encourage and
develop this movement. The iecommenda.
tlons of the secretary will, I do not doubt, re
oeive the friendly consideration ot congress,
for he has enjoyed, as he has deserved, the
confidence of all those interested in the de­
velopment of our navy, without any division
on |partisan lines. I earnestly express the
hope that a work whioh has made such noble
progress may not now be stayed. The whole­
some influence for the peace and increased
sense of security which our citizens domiciled
in other lands feel when these magnificent
ships under the American flag appear is
already most gratefully apparent. The ships
from our navy which will appear in the naval
parade next. April in the harbor of New York
will be a convincing demonstration to the
world that the United States is again a naval
power.
ABOUT PENSIONS.
The President Urges That the Old Soldiers
Be Well Cared For.
The report of the commissioner if pensions
to wbieh extended notice is given by the sec­
retary ot the interior in his report, will ai
traot great attention. Judged by the aggro
Kate amount of work done, the last year has
been the greatest. In the history of the office.
I
believe that the organization of the office is
sfflcient and that the work has beendone with
fidelity. Tbe passage of what is known as the
disability bill has, aa was foreseen, very large­
ly IncreaseU the annaal disbursements io the
disabled veterans of the civil war. The esti­
mate tor this fiscal year was si44.0. 8 lit', and
that amount as appropriated. A deficiency
amoubting to $10,058.sal must be provided for
at this session. The estimate for pensions for
the fiscal year endlug June3i, 1894, is tl«5,uuo,
0.10. The commissioner of pensions believes
that. If the present legislation and methods
are maintained and further additions to the
pension laws are not made, the maximum ex­
penditures for pensions will be re»olied June
80,18M, and will be at the higuest roini-$168,
OOO.OOU per annum.
I adhere to the views expressed In previous
messages that the care
of the disabled soldiers
of the War of the Rebel'ion is a mutter of na­
tional concern and duty.
The Union Pacific Railway.
In my last annual message I called attention
the fact thai some legislative action was
necessary In order to protect the interests oi
the government in Its relations with the
Union Pacific railway. The commissioner of
railroads hafc submitted a very full report, giv

sources.
We must deal with the question ns we find
It aud take that course wh'ch will under exist­
ing conditions best secure the interests of the
United State'. I recommended iu my last an­
nual message hat a commission ue appointed
to deal with tin-) question, and 1 renew that
recommendation and suggest that the coin
mission be given full power.
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
Secretary Noble Ha* Mad a Busy Term|
Willi Any Amouut of Work,
The work of the interior department, al­
ways very burdensome, has beon larger than]
ever before during the admiirstrutiou of See
Tetary Noble. The disab lity pension law\
taking of the Eleventh ceiif-us, the opening of
vast areas of Indian lands to settlement, the
organization of Oklahoma and the negotia­
tions for the ci.'ssion of Indian lands, furnish
some of the particulars of the increased work
and the results achieved testify to the ability,
fidelity and industry of the head of the de­
partment and his eificient assistants.
fcjeveral important agreements for the ces­
sion of Indian 1
anas negotiated by the com*
mlsvon appointed under the ai of March 3,
are awaiting the action of congress. Per-'
haps the most imporiantof Uese ie that for the
cession of the (Jherokoj strip. This region
has been the source o± gre.it vexation to the
executive department, and great frii ti and

ditioned upon its ratification by ess be­
fore March •!, I69J. The secretary pf tbe in­
terior, who has given the suh joc very careful
thought, recommends the ratification of the
agreement, aud I am inclined to follow his
recommendation. Certain ii ia tuat some ac­
tion by whi. this controversy shall be
brought to an end and these lands opened to
settlement is urgent.
The report of th* secretary shows a very
gratifying state of affairs as to tho cor dition
of the general land office. The work of issu­
ing agricultural patents, which seemed to be
hopel ssly in arrears when the present Mere
tary undertook the duties of his office, has
been so expedited that the bureau is now tipon
ourrent business. The relief thus afforded
hone-,t and worthy settlers upon the pub' a
lands by giving them an assured title to their'
entries has been of incalculable beneBt In de­
veloping the new states aud the territories.
