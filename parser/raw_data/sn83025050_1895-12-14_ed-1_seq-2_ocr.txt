Claude Kails Wright, tho theosophlst,
asked lu New York tho other night:
"How do wo know that what wo call
life is not, after all, a dream from which
wo may awake some day?" Ono good
reason for thinking that life Is not a
dream In that the man who has a note
coming duo on n certain day never
wakes up lo llnd that ho hns been tho
victim of mere nlghtmaro
.ludgo lUner. of tho United States
C'urcult court nt Clicyennc, has decided

on the unoccupied government lands
in Wyoming, Is of full force nnd effect
and is superior lo the game laws of that
state, Judge Itlner will henceforth be
an unpopular mini with the cattlo
thieves, land grabbers and pot hunters
of Iho west. Kvrry other class will ap
plaud tho decision.
A strange thing lias happened to Mr.
Ilirhard Manslleld, the eminent actor.
I'pon recovering from n severo attack
nf typhoid fever ho Minis ho has for
gotten tho lines of It 1b plays, nnd ho
must learn them anew. Tho tllscnso
has also h'ad a strange effect upon bin
night. I'roilous to the attack ho was
io near sighted as to be practically un
able to see, and habitually woro eye
glasses. Now his sight Is normal, and
tho glioses arc discarded.
In a slnglo week of the present fall

manufacturers and American Inventors
enn do lu tho way of furnishing wheels
for nil the world to ride. Thero aro

bicycles will not bo In uso next senson,

will surely win llielr way.
Perhaps no inoio momentous utter
IBco than that of Lord .Salisbury nt tho
fcflrn Mayor's banquet In London, was
yer made by nn Kngllsh statesman.
It can liternll) bo said (hat tho fato of
nations hung upon his words. Tho beet
opinion concedes thnt It was a fore
boding, gloomy utteraneo upon tho
present critical situation, and that llio
manlfett attempt to throw Iho Asiatic
question Into Iho background Indicates
that Orcat Drllnln Is far more con
cerned over tho action of Itussla and
Trance In China than in tho Impend
ing crash of tho Turkish Kinplie.
Tho worst thing about Iho hoihclci.s
nrrlage b that horses don't like them.
City horses get used to almost anything,
but tho country loam looks ahead at
tho horseless wagon and leaves sud
denly. Tho country horso doesn't pro
pose to travel upon the naino road with
tho horseless wagon.
The fuss made by a Minnesota man
who found n fragment of a horso collar
In a railroad sandwich seems wholly
unjustified. Even at tho present de
preciation in prices lie could not expect
