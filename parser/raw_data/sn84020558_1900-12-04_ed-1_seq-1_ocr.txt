Tame and Formal
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Document Ably Covering Every
Phase of the Hew Business Which
Has Been Presented There is 8o
Much to Be Done That Time Can
not Be Unnecessarily Spent in
Honoring Dead.
Washington, Dec. 3. The opening
session of the house waj brilliant, but
not exciting. There were th usual
throngs in the galleries and the usual
display of floral pieces on the Hour,
but the proceedings were purely for
mal, consisting of rapping to order
by the speaker, the prayer by the
chaplain, the roll call of numbers, the
appointment of formal conKr.it tees to.
wait upon the president, and the recep
tion of and reading of the president's
message.
Despite the fact that a great presi
dential campaign had been concluded
within a month, the best of feeling
seemed to prevail between the victors
and vanquished.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The Djcumsnt Exhaustively Outlines
the Administrathji Policy.
The message was an exhaustive doc
ument, covering in detail all subjects
which have be:i presented to the
country since the adjournment of the
long session. The message is in- part:
"To the senate and house of repre
sentatives: With the outgoing of the
old' and the Incoming of the new cen
tury you begin the last session of the
fifty-'sixth congress with evidences on
every ham) of individual and national
prosperity and with proof of th.2 grow
ing strength land increasing power for
the good of republican ins.itutions. In
our foreign; interoaursi t': r-mJr.ant
qutstt-Ti has been the .treatment of the
Chinese problem. Apart from this cur
relations with the powers have been
happy. The recent troubles in China
have itbeir origin dep in the charac
ter of the Chinese races, to wfaom the
innovations of modern civilization be
come types of an alien Invasion, t hang
ing the course of their national law
and fraught with vague forebodings of
disaster to their beliefs and to aheir
self conitrol." . .
OUR POLICY IX CHINA.'
After recking the course of the out
break and the heroic defense of the
legations, the policy of the United
States toward China Is outlined in
these words: "The policy t,f the gov
ernment of the United States is to seek
b solution which may bring about per
manent safety and peace; preserve
Chinese territorial and administrative
entity; protect all rights guaranteed
to friendly powers by treaty and Inter
national law and to safeguard for the
world the principle of equal and im
partial trade.
"We forego no Jot of our undoubted
right to exact exemplary and deterrent
punishment of the authors and abet
tors of the criminal acts whereby we
and other nations have suffered griev
ous Injury;"
THE MATTER OF INDEMNITY.
In regard to the indemnity the pres
ident thinks that measured in money
alone it may be beyond the- ability of
China to meet, but that compensation
can be in part made by increased
guarantees and immunities to for
eigners and by the opening of China to
the . commerce of the world. In the
treatment of the Chinese problems the
message continues: "Japan has acted
harmoniously and generously In con
cert with other powers and the closing
year has demonstrated the competence
of the Japanese to hold a foremost
place' among modern peoples."
Reference is made to the ratification
of the Hague peace convention by the
United States, Austria, England, Ger
many, France, Russia Spain, Italy,
Japan, Sweden, Norway, the Nether
lands, Portugal, Persiail Roumania and
Siam, and the president cites his ap
pointment of Benjamin Harrison,
Melville W. Fuller, John. W. Griggs
and Judge George Gray as members of
tli? tribunal for the United States.'
THE ISTHMIAN CANAL.
In regard to the Nicaraguan canal
the president calls attention to the
convention with England to facilitate
the construction of tihe canal and
urg.s tarry action ito remove any dif
ficulty that might arise from the Clay-ton-Bulwer
treaty.
In regard to 'the Philippines atten
tion is called to the fact that when the
treaty with Spain was drawn up the
boundary as ilelineated omitted several
islands west of the Sulus. In order to
cure this defect a supplementary treaty
has been negotiated whereby Spain re
lquishes the title for $100,000. T-iiis
trvaty will early be laid before the
senate.
A YEAR'S BUSINESS.
"It Is gratifying to note," continues
the imessage, "that the surplus reve
nues for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1900, were $79,527,060.18. For the
six years previous we hod only deficits
aggregating $283,022,991.14. The re
ceipts from customs were $233,164, S71.
1G, an Increase over the proceeding
year of $27,030,439.41. The war de
partment expenses for the year were
$134,774,767.7S, a reduction of $95,066,
486.G9 from the previous year. In the
navy department the expenditures
were $55,953,077.72, a decrease of $7,989,
026.53. "Our foreign trade shows a remark
able record1 of commercial and indus
trial progress, the total import and
export for the fiscal year for the first
time in the history of our country ex
ceeding tw.ot billion dollars."
It is recommended 'that the internal
revenue taxes be reduced thirty mil
lion dollars by fhe remission of those
taxes which experience has shown to
be niost burdensome. '
A RIGGER NAVY.
An increase in the navy is endorsed
and authority is asked, to increase the
army to 100,000, including 15.C00 native
troops in the Philippines. As to
trusts, a legislation is urged "founded
on a wise and just discrimination be
tween what is injurious and what Is
useful and necessary In business oper
ations." As to the Phiillippin.es the
president further says, pending the ex
pression of the will of congress, he has
used the authority vested in him by
the constitution ond by the statutes to
uphold the flag In flhese distant is
lands. Progress toward pacification
has' been favorable and. the only oppo
sition is in the nature of a guerrilla
warfare, which "while ineffective to
alter the general control now estab
lished1. Is still sufficient to beget in
security and thus delay the confer
ment upon the Filipinos of the full
measure of self government which we
standi ready to give t'hem."
THE PHILLIPPINES.
Referring to his instructions to the
Phillippine commission, the president
stays: "In all forms of government
and administrative provisions which
they, are authorized to prescribe, the
fact to be borne In mind Is that the
government which they are establish
ing is designed not for our satisfac
tion, but for the happiness, peace and
prosperity of the Philllppine islands,
and the measures adopted should be
made to conform Ito their customs,
their habits and even their prejudices
to the fullest extent consistent with a
Just and effective government."
A cable is reeommendMl cionnec'-ins
the United States and the Philippin. s
by way of Hawaii. The .message says
a satisfactory settlement or tne armor
plate question, whereby our govern
ment secures armor plate at a reason
able price, has avoided the necessity
for erecting a government plant.
A DANGER OF PROSPERITY.
In conclusion fhe message says:
"In our great prosperity we must
guard against the clanger it invites of
extravagance In government expendi-
1 :r3 and ap;onri?.tions. in tr.-
' great era ti business activity and oi
nortunlty caution is n.-.t untlm-ly.
Our growing po.ver brings with H
temptations and p.-rils. It must not
be used to Invite conflicts nor f.w op
pression, but for the mre effective
maintenance of those principles of
equality and justice upon which our
institutions and happiness depend.
Let us bear 1n miml that the founda
tion of our government Is liberty, its
superstructure peace.
"Wm. McKinley."
The reading of the message, which
naturally was the feature cf the day.
otLupied over two hours. It was lis
tened to with respectful interest by
both sides.
The deaths of the late Representative
Hoffecker. of Delaware, and Senators
Davis, of Minnesota, and Gear, of
Iowa, were announced, and as a fur
ther mark of respect, the house ad
journed until tomorrow.
THE SENATE SESSION
Eecognition of the Fact That Time Is
Precious.
Washington, Dec. 3. In the senate
today, the work of the short session of
the lifty-sixth congress was success
fully launched'. It hud been the pur
pose of the senate to announce the
death of Senators Gear (Iowa) and
Davis (Minnesota), immediately after
assembling, and then to adjourn, and
to receive the message cf the presi
dent tomorrow, but as this had been
announced1 by the leaders of both
branches of congress to be a "business
session," it was determined to receive
the message today, and thus gain one
day in a session, in which that much
time may be of immense importance.
Aside from the reading of the mes
sage and the administration of the
oath of ofUVe to Wiliiam B. Dilling
ham, the new senator from' Vermont,
who succeeds the late Justin S. Morrill,
no business was transacted. The
other new member of the body, for
mer representative Jonathan 1. Doili
ver, who succeeds the late Senator
Gear of Iowa, was present through
out the session, but his credentials
were not presented and he was not
sworn in. These formalities will be
complied with tomorrow, now that the
senate has been informed of the death
of Sena'. or Gear.
THE TAX REDUCING RILL.
Washington, Dec. 3. Chairman
Payne, of the ways and' means commit
tee, said today tha't no exact pro
gramme had been fixed as to the time
of acting in the coirmittee on the bill
for reducing the war revenues, or fur
considering the measure in the house.
THE MINORITY IN CAUCUS.
Washington, Dec. 3. A caucus of the
democratic members of the house of
representatives was held in the hall
of the house at the close of the session
today to consider'the course to be tak
en on army legislation. Representa
tive Hay, of Virginia, member of the
military committee, explained the s a
tus of the bill proposed by Secretary
Root, and urged the desirability of not
legislating until the course of the gov
ernment as to the Philippines has been
more definitely determined. The cau
cus adjourned without action.
PORTO RICAN TARIFF
Its Abrogation Under Discus
sion on the Island
A Consideration of Local Meant to
Meet the Expenses of the Gov
ernment How it May Be
Done.
Washington, Dec. 3. The abrogation
of the Porto Rican tariff is being se
riously discussed by the press of Porto
Rico. The Porto Rican tariff act. It
will be remembered, provides that
"whenever the legislative assembly of
Porto Rico shall have enacted and put
Into operation a system cf local taxa
tion to meet the necessities of the gov
ernment of Porto Rico, by this act es
tablished, and shall, by resolution duly
passed, so notify the president, he shall
make proclamation thereof, and there
upon all tariff duties on merchandise
and articles going Into Porto Rico from
the United States, or coming into the
United States from Porto Rico, fhall
cease, and from and after such dale
all such merchandise and articles
shall be entered at 'the several ports
of entry free of duty."
The Porto Ric-n legislature, elected
on Nevemier 6th, the date of the gen
eral election in the United States, is to
meet shortly, and will, under the pro
visions of the Porto Rican act above
eiuoted, have the power to immedlate'.y
terminate the Porto Rican tariff by
enacting legislation which will pro
vide funds for the necessities of the
government of Porto Rico, and the
question whether this action shall be
taken and the 13 per cent tariff thus
term'inated', is being discussed by the
press and publio of that island, as is
Hiss Democracy: Marraige (to
shown by the following leading editor
ial taken from the San Juan (Porto
Rico) Daily News, of November 13,
1900, just received by the treasury bu
reau of statistics:
"We have lived now under the 85 per
cent preferential tariff. The question
now is, Is it good or bad? Has it
helped or injured us? The legislature
will , have these questions to decide.
We now have the eiuestion to deal
with, aside and apart tro.iv politics. Its
use as a campaign club is past and
gone. The burden of deciding this
very important question is solely upen
the legislature. As it decrees, so shall
tt be. If it desires to abolish the tar
iff and operate the island upon a free
trade basis, it can be so ordered. If
j the people of Porto Rico, through the
iff, it can be done. A precedent has
been established whkh will permit this
clars of taxation. It has been legally
decreed that such action is constitu
tional. If the tariff is abolished, it is
at once that a more burdensome and
higher rate of internal taxation must
be imposed. Where, and upon what,
shall this be levied, is, indeed, a per
plexing question.
"Aside from all the difficulties that
may or will arise from the abolition of
the tariff., let us glance at the tariff
itself, and see what it has done. In
the last six months the 15 per cent
tariff has afforded the island as much,
if not more, than the 100 per cent tariff.
The theory 'that the way to increase
revenues is by lowering taxes," is pro
ven to be true for Porto Rico. This
' m-armr. will Kii .nnrnnt!v infrpssin
as our trade increases, as it is sure to
do. It has helped the consumer, for
it has towered the taxes he has to pay,
not only. upon A.xerican gooJs, but up
on all goods that enter our market in
competition with them. This result?
in an int-rease of Importations. This
helps the proelucer by constantly pro
viding him a means to carry his goods
to the great American market, which
is always so hungry for the products
this island has to dispose of. Again,
unless we have a traffic both ways, the
steamer must make one trip without a
cargo and the freight is thereby dou
bled. "A tariff helps us as borrowers; it
will give our set uritAVs a stand in the
United! States, which they could not
have without permanent revenue like
the tariff revenue. The argument so
often advanced in favor of a tariff tax
as against other means of raising rev
enue, that it Is easily collected, is es
pecially forcible in Porto Rico. We
would advise that the tariff i?j neces
sary, and if it were not, it wld still

Zl ,r -:,
he the ir.'osx convenient and logical
means of raising our revenue. Let
the tariff stand at 15 per cent."
BURGLAR HIRED TO OPEN SAFE.
Woman Allowed to Employ Convict to
Obta'in Valuable Papers.
Columbus, O., Dec. 3. In order to ob
tain valuable papers belonging to the
late Col. F. J. Pickard, a civil -nsineer,
who died a few days ago, Mrs. Pickarl
was permittel to employ an expert
! safeblower, now a convict in the stal?
penitentiary here. The burglar was
ionveyed' last night in a closed carriage
'to the safe, which he blew open in
twelve in.inutos, and was then takeii
back to his cell before daylight this
morning.
Col. Piekard alone knew the com
bination of the safe and the town was
searched in vain for an expert to open
it before the novel plan of obtaining
the services of a burglar was adopted.
NATIONAL W. C. T. TJ.
Opening of the Twenty-Seventh An
nual Convention.
Washington, Dec 3. In the hand
some auditorium of the Lafayette op
ra house, which was prettily decor
ated with flags and Mowers, the twenty-seventh
annual meeting of the Na
tional Woman's (Christian (Temper
ance union was called to order short
ly after 9 o'clock this morning by Mrs.
L. M. N. Stevens, of Maine, president
of the organization. Hundreds cf del
egates, some of whomi had journeyed
thousands of miles t- participate in the
proceedings, occurred' .the seats and
bencher, cn the floor of the auditorium,
while the balconies were filled' with in
terested spectators. The convention
began- with the singing of Vhe hymn,
"Give to the Winds Thy Fears," frcm
the white ribbon hymnal, after which
Mrs. Cornelia B. Forbes, president of
the Connecticut W. C. T. U., led in
prayer. The roll call of official mem-
Populism) is a failure.
i hers, by Mrs. Clara C. Hoffman, of
Missouri, followed, and then came the
appointment of committees ca creden
tials, publications, courtesies and tel-
: egrams.
In her annual address. President Lil
' lian M. N. Stevens presented soma in
teresting facts. As to the progress of
i the reform, she spoke in the most eon
: fident lanuage. "During the last
twenty years, total abstinence and the
! prohibition sentiment have greatly ad
; vaneed." she said. "In 1SS4, the peo
pie cf Maine, by a vote of three to one,
placed the heretofore statutory pro
; hibitory law In the constitution cf tho
' state. Kansas and North Dakota
have also adopted constitutional pro
hibition. Neal Dow never claimed
more beneficent. results for the law in
the state of Maine than do Judge Pol
: lock, of North Dakota, and Charles
1 Sheldon, of Kansas, claim for their re
spective states. Last winter, in Geor
gia, a prohibitory law passed the house,
by a large majority, and would have
; passed the senate but lor the concerted
action against it by the Liquor Dealers'
j association. Not until good people
! learn that they should be as active to
promote good work as the evil-doers
are to carry their points, shall we have
correct epressions cf public opinion
: concerning the great evils in our midst.
"Within two years the sale or use of
liquor has been prohibited on board the
ships of the United Stales navy, or
within the limits of the naval stations,
i and as lately as February, 1899. con
, gress passed a law prohibiting the
sale of intoxicating liquors in army
camps, posts, exchanges . or canteens,
or on any premises used for military
purposes by tne United States. To b
sure, this law has been declared null
and void, but the end is not yet. With
in a year a po'.ygamist has been reject
ed as a member of the United States
congress, and the White Ribbonerg re
joice that they had a hand in bring-
I lng about this righteous action. The
I same public conscience that prevented
Brigham Roberts having a seat in the
, United States congress will yet can e to
j be enacted the anti-canteen bill, now
pending, or seme Kincirea measure.
If the action be not so prompt as it
was concerning that other great home
question just referred to. we should
not be discouraged, for it is only, about
fifty years since the question of pro
hibiting the sale of liquor has been be
fore the people; consequently they are
not so well educated upon it as upon
the question of polygamy. Rut intem
perance and impurity are twin evils,
and both, alike, invade and destroy the
sanctity of the home."
THE SOIL OF ARIZONA
Surveys Made In This Ter
ritory During the Year
An Appropriation for a Continuation
of the Work What Has Already
Been Accomplished by it in This
Country.
Washington, Dec. 3. Ttie annual re
port of the chief of the division of soils
of the agricultural department says:
The acres surveyed during the year
in Arizona was 400 square miles, at the
rate of 3.3 square miles per day, at a
total coat of $840, or $2.10 per mile.
In December Mr. Means went to Ail
zona. where the Arizona experiment
station furnished an assistant, and
:three months were spent in surveying
and mapping 400 sciuare miies of land,
in co-operation with the experiment
station.
In the 100 square miles of land sur
veyed' and mapped around Tempe,
Ariz., on the south side of Salt liver,
the soils were found to be formed of
wash from the mountains and alluvial
material brought down by the river.
The underlying material was catoer
eous, and underlying this , at a still
greater depth, were gravel and bowl
der beds, which invariably carry Ma
ter.
ine soils are naturally free from
alkali, and! the Irrigation waters are
good, containing about 100 part3 of
salts per 100,000 parts of water. Thi
irrigation of the mesa lands, however,
has caused the water in the lower land
to rise to within on or two feet of the
surface In, years of plentiful supply of
water, and considerable areas of what
were the most fertile lands are now
liable to be too wet to cultivate, and,
besides, have accumulated an amount
of alkali detrimental to ail cultivated
crops. The question of under-drainage
was considered in connection with the
carnage already done, and it is believed
it is quite cossiible and practicable to
reclaim the damaged lands and prevent
further loss.
Similar conditions were found to ex
ist in the 250 square miles surveyed cn
the north side of the river, except tha't
the alkali is here confined to A narrow
strip along the river, which however,
is constantly widening. Special prob
lems were encountered here, as well
as In an area under the Buckeye ra
r.a'.; which w ill be fully -treated-in the
final report on the work. The results
of the work are highly satisfactory in
showing on the maps prepared th-3 con
ditions actually prevailing, and in in
dicating that the alkali eiuestion can
easily be controlled and the fertility of
the land be assuredly maintained."
The director cf the Arizona experi
mental' station, in urging the exten
sion of the work in the territory, says:
The work of the coil and alkali sur
vey, epecial!y in a new country, is
of great value in showing settlers the
nature cf the land and its liabilitiis to
alkali information which will often
times guide a farmer between success
and disaster in his operations.
A single instance during the past
year will illustrate the desirability of
such Work. The Arizona experiment
station has been conducting a sugar
beet culture experiment in the fertile
valley of the upper Gila. The plots
were very various as to the r.atura of
the soil, and five characteristic plots
gave the following yields of sugar per
acre in pounds: 1,491, 1,521, 2,006, 2.2G7,
3.361. The first two yields were se
cured in sandy mesa soil; the second
two In a typical heavy soil found in the
river bottom, and the fifth and largest
yield was secured on a peculiar type cf
alluvial soil. These great differences
In sugar production are mainly due to
differences in s'oil; consequently, in the
exploitation of this district for beet
sugar factory purposes, it ia absolutely
essential to know the location and ex
tent of this latter soil, as ft is certain
that beet culture would best prosper in
this type of soil.
Congress is asked for an increase of
JS0.000 for thf soil survey: of that sum
Arizona will be allowed $2,500.
TUSKING NIGHT INTO DAY
Electric "Wiring the City for Carni
val Week.
Work has commenced on wiring the
streets for the incandescent lights to

GREATEST OF MODERN STOICS.
Dr. Rand So Characterizes the Third
Earl of Shaftesbury.
Cambridge, Mass., Dew. 3. Dr. Ben
jamin Rand of the department of phi
losophy at Harvard, as a result of his
investigations among English manu
scripts, announces the discovery of a
new and. modern stoical philosopher in
the third earl of Shaftesbury, hereto
fore best known as the author of
Characteristics.
The "philosophical regimen," as Dr.
Rand terms the newly discovered pio
d'uetion of this ethical writer, embodies
a philosophy which he pronounces the
strongest expression of stoicism since
the days of Epietetus and Marcus Au
relius, and he characterizes Shaftes
bury as "both in .theory and practice
the greatest stoic" of modern times."
AN EXPENSIVE VERDICT
Carrying a Net loss to Recipient
of $23.
A Litigant won a case in district
court, which after it was al? over yes
terday, thought he wouTd rather have
lost .if it had not been f jir the costs. In
the case cf Miyer vs. Sanford for dam
ages growing out of an alleged malic
ions prosecution, tiie jury late last
Saturday night returned a sealed' ver
dict. The first thing yesterday morn
ing was the disposition, of this verdict.
The jurymen were In their seats and
the court opening the verdict and seeing
in hoe favor it had b;en. rendered, in
quired how long the jury had s. rved. It
was one day, $24. Tihe court directed
the! at't'oo-ney for the plaintiff to de
posit that amount if he wanted to
hear the verdict reaa. The lawyer pro
duced the money with great pleasure
and cheerful alacrity.
The court then read the verict to
himself and handing it to tihe clerk told
him to record it. The plaintiff's attor
ney suggested to the court that it was
the usual custom for the clerk to real
the verict aloud before recording it.
"That will be done later," replied

length the clerk read that the jury had
awarded the plaintiff tl.
The jury had don anxiher funny
thing, one of those things which ev:l
disposed persons fiwd arguments
against the whole Jury sys

party should pay his own costs. That
was a matter far beyond the jury's
jurisdiction. Even the court could not
have ordered it, for the law provides
tih-aid the loser must pay.

HERE'S A NEW REPUBLIC!
It's Name Is Acre, It's In South Amer

Denver, Dec. 3. Henry W. Phlllipa,
the "first minister to the United States
from the new South American "Repub
lic of Acre," passed through Denver on
his way to Washington today. "Acre
opolis," said Mr. Phillips Is the capital
city of the Republic of Acre, the 'For
est Republic,' we like Ito call It by way
of variety. Some call us the "Rubber
Republic." I dare say the nationality
is not widely known, being new, and to
secure formal recognition on the pirt
of the United States is in part my mis
sion. I believe this is the first time
that Acreopolis has "been, written on
any American hotel register, for I did
not stop at Stn Francisco on iriy arri
val from South America, being in a
hurry to be at Washington before the
opening of congress.
"I am the acc-reditsdi minister of a
sound republic, which is established for
all time, we believe, and aa firmly as
any in Pouth America: perhaps mora
firmly than some, being as ft Is an
Anglo-Saxon republic and then again a
Tankee republic."

called republic, known as Acre, has

IT WAS THE KID
Identity of the Bad Kan at Colomia
Facheco.
A. O. Woodruff, an apostle cf fhe
Mormon church, arrived in Mesa City
on Friday to attend church conference
ana will leave again on Wednesd-ay.
He was at Colonia, Facheco, Mexico,
at the time of tha great Apache up
rising a few da-3 ago and which was
heralded abroad by press correspond
ents.
Later, as most newspaper readers urm
aware, it transpired that nhe uprising
and subsequent battle amounted ti the
killing of one buck, one squaw and a
pappoose. It was then announced that
the buck killed was the notable
Apache Kiel. But tihe battle itself wn
so exaggerated that no one believed It
to be the Kid. Mr. Woodruff told a
Republican reporter yesterday that he
saw the dead man and that the Impres
sion is general In Colonial Pacheco that
lit was the Ki. He was hard ty Iden
tify for the reason that the Kid has
not been much of a mixer of late years
and if he had many Intimates they are
biding out. However, he wore the
headdress and accoutrements of a
chief an'd the me n who killed him are
so certain! of his identity that they
have mae application for the various
rewards.
