to fill the offices.
Senator Bailey's advice to the
democratic members of the con
stitutional convention on the re
call, was repudiated with con
tumely. President Taft's message was a
clean-cut statement of fact, and
was accepted by democrats and
republicans alike as a statesman
like document, devoid of bombast
and catch-penny tricks of speech.
The Coconino Sun, one of our
brightest exchanges, has entered
upon its 28th year of usefulness.
Here's hoping it "may live long
and prosper. Florence Blade.
Thank you, Senator. We hope
the Joe Jefferson part of the toast
comes true.
Acting Governor Young has
called an election to vote on the
constitution lor February 9th,
ion. There is just a small
chance, even if the constitution is
approved by the people, to get it
before congress before March 4
next.
Secretary Wilson reports that
we mer,ely have 3,121,381,000
bushels of corn in the crib this
year. With just this little old
sack of corn, how are we to have
johnny cake, corn meal mush and
corn juice enough to go around,
with only a little over 300 bushels
apiece?
Judge Doe took occasion to
hand the radical element of the
constitutional convention a brief
of his opinion of that body at the
close of the session, when he,
with Ellinwood and the republican
minority, except one, refused to
sign the document. The majority
surfeited with power and a desire
to make political capital, refused
to let the minority sign unless it
was with approval. That un
doubtedly came from their great
desire to play fair as fair as they
have with the people who sent
them there. This magnificent ma
jority of radicals, with no thought
to the future and little, if any,
thinking for the present, will "go
down to oblivion as discredited an
outfit of law abortionists as were
ever sent to the capital.
The Democrat regrets that Gov
ernor Sloan made the remarks at
tributed to him; ' yet we realize as
a citizen of Arizona he is entitled
to his opinion of this constitutional
convention. And the most serious
thing connected with the whole
matter is that every man in Ari
zona entertains the same views.
Phoenix Democrat.
The question of voting for the
constitution adopted is not now a
political question, if it ever was
one. As near as iris possible to
know, it is now only a question as
to whether or not Arizona wants
statehood. If ihc constitution is
.approved by the people of Ari
zona, we place ourselves in the
position of saying it is good; it is,
what we want and we like it.
Taking that view of us as a peo
ple, President Taft and congress
will pass upon it. There is no
doubt in the minds of thinking
people as to what he will do with
it. Democrats and republicans
alike agree on that point.
If the people, thinking over the
different provisions- of the pro
posed constitution conclude it is
bad, there is only one more chance,
even from the present members of
the constitutional convention.
The will have a chance to go
home and get a clearer view of
what the people want. Man'
democratic members of this same
convention are disgusted with the
work done and have so expressed
themselves. Like a kind and in
dulgent people, we believe' they
should be given at least one more
chance.
Coconino county never did be
lieve the constitution should be
placed on a political basis and
they are more firmly convinced
than ever that the radical, unthink
ing element of the territory secur
ed control and run wild without
heed or thought for the future.
Politics will not buy anything for
the individual he wants just laws,
fair courts and an even chance
with all others.
Edward Douglas White, of
Louisiana, a democrat, has been
appointed chief justice of the
supreme court of the United
States, and has been confirmed by
the senate. Us republicans and
us democrats seem to get together
occasionally in spite of the rabid
element.

Ah'thel I tawaMiUSreana"' loathsome sty.
Wherein a drove of wallowing swine
were barred,
Whose banquet" shocked the nostril and
the eye;
Then spoke a voice, "Behold the source
of lard I"
I fled, and saw a field that seemed at first
One glistening mass of roses pure and
white,
With dewy buds 'mid dark green foliage
nursed;
And, as I lingered o'er the lovely sight,
The summer breeze, that cooled that
Southern scene.
Whispered, "Behold the source of
COTTOLENEI"
