THE PRESIDF.NTS MESSAGE
President Taft's first annual mes?
sage to the ?OoagrcM of the United
States follows clt>tstly ?tbe ?beaten ?path
and fails to suggest any new legisla
tion not already brought t?> the no?
tice of the country by tin? pre? an?!
by political parties and organizations
The president refers but briefly to
the Payne-Aldrich taritf bill, passing
"it" by as if in a hurry tt> take up ?noie
subject less enrtbarras-sing. though he
attempts some little defense of ?the
high tariff system in tj-jnrowing the
high cost of living, which he tells OS
doea not result therefrom. He dep?
recates any tariff revision talk M
detrimento) to business, but ?this very
fact goes to show that even now
there is such talk, ?thorttfh the new
tariff has hardly ?fone into effect
The president, departing from his
policy of praising the new tariff law,
fails to say one word in praise there?
of, but virtually admits that ?Con
gress may again have to tackle ?the
matter, if the facts obtained ?by ?the
new tariff board are not satisfactory.
Mr. Taft's words in favor of ex?
pedition of litigation will meet with
general approval, as will his sugges?
tion that Congress modify the rules
of procedure in Federal eourts with
regard to the issuance of injunctions
without notice, though there is little
chance that ( ongress will carry out
the last suggestion so long as the
Aldrich-Cannon regime is continued
There is one feature of the mes?
sage which deserves serious atten?
tion and that is the statements show?
ing that expenditures far exceed in?
come. In other words the President
is forced to make the hu?
miliating confession that his party
has been extravagant to a point
where it is necessary ?to issue bonds
to meet the deficit and though he
points out that economy is being ob?
served in all departments of the gov?
ernment there seems little hope that
conditions will better themselves for
some time to come. Taken h ?
whole the message is at least c??n
servative.
The Virginia Good Roads Associa?
tion meets in Richmond for it
second annual session this week ?and
will be well attended by delegates
from all parts of the State. The or?
ganization of this ass? ?nation has ac?
complished wonders and has resulted
in increased interest in the building
of roads in every section of Virginia.
Its officers rendered valuable aid in
the campaign recently closed ?so suc?
cessfully in Spotsylvania ?tnd they
have done the same in many ? ?ther
counties. The association should
have the hearty support of the pe<>
ple and the press.
