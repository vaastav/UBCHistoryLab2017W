GllTEAU'S TRIAL TO-DAY.
*
HE OPENS THE PROCEEDINGS.
GENERAL SHERMAN A WITNESS.
TESTIMONY AGAINST THE INSANITY THEORY.
The attendance at the Gulteau trial to-day was
sufficient to reassure the doubting mind of the
prisoner, who had misgivings lest public Interest
in him and his dologs were falling. The opening
proceedings of the court were attended by little incident.
Among the new faces visible In the court
room was that of Rev. T. DeWitt Talmage, of
the Brooklyn Tabernacle. He came In with Judge
Porter, and Sat with him at the prosecution table.
Representatives Richardson, of Florida; Mason, of
New York, and Qen. Sherman sat near the prosecution
table. McKenzie, of Kentucky, and Wise,
of Virginia, also occupied seats within the bar.
Judge Mac Arthur sat, during the morning, with
Judge Cox.
Uuiteau Opens I lie Proceeding* with a
Speech.
The court was called to order at 10:05, and the
prisoner was promptly placed In his seat. As soon
as he was unmanacled he addressed the court.
"If the court please," he said, "the American
people do not desire that this case be tried again,
and I do not desire it, but I say, with the utmost
respect to this court and jury, that I am not satisfled
with th;> way the political situation has been
presented. That Is the very gist of the whole defence.
I say that the President or the United
States would never have teen shot if It hadn't been
! tor the political situation, and I say I have a right
to ask your honor that you summon Gen. Grant
and Senators Conkllng and Piatt, and those kind
of men, who were so down on President Garfield
that they would not speak to him fin the street, or
call upon him. I have a right to show my personal
relations?I may say cordial relations?with those
men when I was in New York. I was well dressed,
well fed there.and lived at the Fifth Avenue Hotel."
GUITKAU EXCEPTS TO THE COPRT'S RULING.
" I will have to except to your honor's ruling,"
added the prisoner, "and the court in banc will
sustain It, and I will have a new trial."
The court remarked that the exception had
already been noted.
THE PRISONER TO MAKE THE CLOSING SPEECH.
" I also desire to announce," said the prisoner,
"that I Intend to make the closing speech In this
case, after Mr. Scoville gets through. Mr. Scovilletakes
altogether too narrow-minded a view of this
case."
As to the President's Testimony*
Mr. Scoville said that he had drawn up six interrogatories
to submit to the President, and had
sent them. He expected that the President would
return his replies this morning, but he (Scoville)
had not yet received them.
The prosecution objected that they had not been
permitted to see the interrogatories.
During the discussion Gulteau frequently raised
his voice in protest. " I don't think it is at all necessary,"
he shouted, "for Gen. Arthur to be bored
in this way. If you want to put the President on
1 the stand, I would like to titlk to him." Again he
declared: "Gen. Arthur Is President of the United
States, and I think it would be Improper to drag
him into this court"
After some discussion, in which the prosecution
agreed to waive their privilege of reviewing the
interrogatories, the court said that whenever the
President's replies came in they would be admitted
as evidence.
l)r. E. c. Spitzka, of New York, and Nettie G.
Kude of Chicago, were called but did not respond.
Mr. Scoville then asked for attachments
for both witnesses, which request the court
granted.
OUITEAU DISCLAIMS ANY VANITY OR EGOTISM.
The prisoner, who had been reading a newspaper,
broke in again: "Considering the pressure
on me for autographs," he said, "I want to say I
don't care a snap about greatness. I haven't any
vanity or egotism In this case. It is absolutely
false what Is said in the newspapers on that
point
Mr. Scoville said he had relied upon Dr. Spitzka
as the chief expert witness for the defence. He
understood that tfce prosecution had been after
him as a witness for the prosecution, and he had
detdlned to come,as his mind was already made up
as to the Insanity of the prisoner.
Gen. Sherman as a Witness.
Mr. Scoville then announced that he rested his
case, and the government began the rebuttal testimony
by calling Gen. Sherman to the stand.
"Wm. T. Sherman, general or the army of the
United States," replied the witness when asked
his name and occupation. The witness testified
that he was in Washington on the 2d of July when
the President was shot District Attorney Corkhill
then handed to Gen. Sherman a letter, which the
General said was handed to him at 11:45 a.m. on
the day of the assassination, at his office in the
War department by Major Brock and Major Twining.
The military force of the United States here
was ordered out Instantly at the tirst Intimation
that the President was shot; the shooting
of the President gave reason to apprehend
that It was a part and parcel
or a conspiracy pervading the country, and, or
course, the military of the country was bound to
take precautions against any emergency that
might arise; the witness had made such personal
examination as he could; when he had learned
that there was no conspiracy, the army assisted
the civil authorities, at the request of Major
Brock.
Gen. Sherman was then cross-examined by Mr.
Scoville only so far as to reiterate that he had at
first supposed there might have been a conspiracy.
When the General was stepping from the stand,
Gulteau called to him: "Kesu'.ting, General, from
the political situation, wasn't It? "
Gen. Sherman did not deign to reply, but Mr.
Scoville asked him: "Did you have any foundation
for supposing there was a conspiracy other than
your own opinion?"
"None," said the witness, and he added: "I came
to the conclusion that the act was that of one
man?one man alone."
GriTEAU THANKS GEN, SHERMAN.
As the General was leaving Gulteau called out
to him In a familiar way. "Much obliged to you,
General, for sending troops for my protection at
that time."
Testimony in Rebuttal as to Hereditary
Insanity.
Edwin P. Barton, a lawyer, testified that he had
resided in Freeport, I1L, since the spring of 1856.
Regarding Mr. L. W. Gulteau, father of the prisoner,
the witness said he had the character of a
very reliable, honest, straightforward, clearheaded
business man. He was Intelligent to an
unusual degree. The witness was with L. W.
Gulteau at the time of his death, and had drawn
his will for him some months before. The wit
ness never had any doubt but he was perfectly
sane; the Idea never occurred to him that he was
Insane. In reference to Abram Gulteau, he testllled
that he had no doubt of his sanity. He went
over the names of all the members of the family
he knew, and gave his opinion that they were all
sane. He said the same of the prisoner, so long as
he knew him, though he had not seen him since
1859.
Upon cross-examination the witness said that L.
W. Gulteau suffered under some delusion in his
Illness; he said he had many discussions on religious
topics with L. W. Gulteau; the witness did
not remember that he had reported to Mr. Burchard,
when L. W. Gulteau was a candidate for an
office in a bank, that the latter said he believed he
would never die; he understood Mr. Gulteau had a
hope that if he lived a pure life he might possibly
live forever. He had no reason to doufit L. W.
Gulteau's sincerity; he had not much opportunity of
Judging of L. W. Gulteau's mental condition during
the last year or two or his lire; he had also little
opportunity of knowing .Abram Gulteau in the
latter year of his life; he did not think Abram's
daughter, Ella, had as much intelligence as the
other children; witness had never neard that
Flora Gulteau was of unbalanced mind, and that
measures had been taken for treating her as an
insane person.
The witness was asked if he would consider a
man perfectly sane, who entertained a fixed belief
that he would never die,
*.J*bere some discussion as to the admissibility
of the questloiu but the court admitted it
"he witnessreplieatliat his opinion would be
based upon circumstances.
Mr. Scoville wanted a categorical reply.
"A man has a right to refuse to making a fool
of himself on the stand," said the district attorney,
coming to the relief of the witness.
The witness said he was of the opinion If a person
believed literally the texts on which UW.
Gulteau based his doctrines, and on their authority
believed In immortality on earth, lie was not necessarily
insane.
A. T. Green, of Freeport, Hi., a collector, was
next put on the stand. The character of L W
Gulteau as a citizen and a business man, the witness
said, was good; he enumerated various public
offices held toy the old gentleman; he was regarded
toy witness as a sane man; witness' Judgment was
that Abram Gulteau was sane also;Tie did not
know any member of the family that was insane.
Upon cross-examination, the -witness said he had
seen L.W. Gulteau once in his last Illness; thought
he was then under the influenced morphine: knew
that Mrs. L. W. Gulteau was side and feeble during
the last few years of her life.
Gardner W. Tandy, a boat and shoe dealer of
Free port, 111,, testified to UteAntlmate acquaintance
with Luther W. Gulteau; he lived for years
opposite Mr. Guiteau's house; had never seen
anyttilng that Indicated to lilm that L. W. Gulteau
was insane; witness thought him of unusual
Intelligence; witness known the prisoner
when he was a clerk in tike office of t he court
clerk; Mr. Tandyte opinions-rqfeardlng the various
members of the family were similar to those of
the preceding witnesses. On cross-examination
Mr. Scovllle asked the wltneesator his Idea of what
constituted unsoundness of utfed, and he replied
that he was not an expert; L. W. Guiteau had
never expressed to him a convection that he would
never die; witness thought the old gentleman was
delirious during his last lllnest; he never knew of
any Impairment of mental Acuities of Abram
Gulteau; his acquaintance with A brain's family
was only a "store acquaintancethey used to
buy goods of witness.
Dr. Benjamin P. Buckloty, another Freeporter,
the family physician of L. W. ?uiteau during the
last years of his life, was sworn, and testified that
the old gentleman was considered an honest and
upright man; he was of line Intellect, and was a
public spirited man; as a patient he was mild,
pleasant and confiding; the witness had never
seen any Indication of insanity In L. W. Gulteau.
"Nor did any one else," added Mr. Corkhlll.
"Are you testifying," asked Mr. Scovllle, sharply.
"No; but I would like to," retorted Mr. Corkhlll.
"Then you get on the stand,said Mr. Scovllle.
The witness never heard of any peculiar beliefs
of the elder Gulteau.
"He only taught those tbfngs In the family,"
Interrupted the prisoner. "He did not go
round the streets talking like an idiot or a Jackass."
Witness knew very little of Abram Gulteau; attended
him in his last illness; remembered nothing
about his case that was unusual.
He was asked if he did not know of L. W. Gulteau's
distributing his property around on the community
system.
"That's the way father used to do It," interrupted
the prisoner. "He took that man North,
and took him to the house and supported liim and
his family on the money he ought to have sent me
to college with."
'That's my opinion of North; I agree with you
on that," said the district attorney.
JOHN W. GCITEAU SPEAKS IN DEFENCE OP HIS
SISTEK FT.OR A.
Mr. Scovllle having asked the witness if he
knew anything about Flora Guiteau being said to
be insane and as to measures taken to send her to
an asylum, Mr. John W. Gulteau rose to his feet
and said: "If the court please I wish to make
a request of the prosecution to ask witness the
exact nature of my sister's il\pess. I consider It
a burning shame that tills stigma should rest on
this girl. It leaves the Idea that she was sent to
St. Louis because she was insane."
The district attorney said he also thought it
unpardonable that a young girl should be
smirched in this way.
"If there is any remark that fs unpardonable,"
said Mr. Scovllle, with some show of temper, "it
is such a remark as that from the district attorney."
The witness, at the request, of the district attorney,
then answered Mt Guiteau's question. He
said Flora Guiteau was suffering with ophthalmic
goitre; she was a girl of remarkable ability and
superior mind.
"I am very sorry," said the prisoner, "that my
half-sister has been named In this case. So far as
I know she is a very high-toned lady. I send her
my greetings. I haven't seen her for several
years."
NEVER HEARD OF INSANITY IN: THE GUITEAU FAMILY
UNTIL THE TRIAL BEGAN.
Smith D. Atkins, editor of the Frceport Republican,
was called, and gave tlie same testimony in
effect regarding L. W7 Gulteau and his family as
the preceding witnesses. He knew Mr. North in
Freeport as a Methodist minister; he was excluded
from the Methodist church there, the witness said,
for lascivious conduct or teachings. Witness knew
of Mr. Amerling. He was not a man whom, witness
thought, Mr. L. W. Guiteau would associate
with. The witness never heard of any Insanity in
the Gulteau family till this trial began.
"Mr. North," said the prisowr, "was expelled
from the church because he believed in the Oneida
Community doctrines."
The witness, on cross-examination, said he had
no reason for knowing anything about Mr. North
except common report; he had never heard anything
against him except. his Inclination towards
the Oneida Community doctrines.
GUITEAU AGAIN.
When the witness was excused the prisoner explained
again: "I don't believe the Oneida Community
believers of Freport were ever charged
with lascivious conduct."
At 12:30, at the suggestion of Mr. Corkhlll, a
recess for one hour was taken.
GUITEAU FRIGHTENED BV SCHOOL BOYS THIS MORNING.
When Guiteau leaves the court house in the van
each day there Is more or less booting and yelllug
by the crowd, and frequently on the trip down
crowds of colored people and aahool boys Jeer at
the prisoner. In some Inst incas, In the residences
along tne streets through which the van passes,
old women are seen shaking their fists at the
vehicle. Guiteau does not, of course, see the demonstrations
against hlau Since he was shot at
by Jones he does not stand In the van nor does he go
towards the front pirt of it, through which the ball
p issed, his favorite position being the seat near
the door. The cries do not have much effect in the
afternoon, but when the school boys and others
hoot at him on the upward trip he is somewhat
alarmed. Tills morning quite a crowd met the
van in the neighborhood of 8th street east with
cries of "Shoot him," "Hang him," &c. The
prl-oner made a Jump from the rear end of the
vehicle to the front, and had hardly recovered
from his fright when the van arrived at the court
house.
TRIAL NOTES.
The fact that but few of the twenty odd experts
summoned for the defendant gave their testimony
excites some remark, and it Is said that nearly all
of them came to the conclusion that they could do
the prisoner no good by their testimony. A few
experts had interviews with the prisoner Monday
afternoon, but none of them appeared yesterday
on the witness stand. The prisoner stated yesterday
that the experts requested that he should
take some medicine before making the examination,
but he declined. They talked with him for
about one and a half hours and examined his eyes,
felt Ills pulse and leftMr.
Scovllle during the past few days has modified
his views regarding the probable length of
the trial. He stated to-day to a Star reporter that
he had expected that It would take a week to examine
the expert witnesses on his side. Inst ad
of that, one atternoon sufficed. District Attorney
Corkhltl said to-day that he expected the trial
would not last more than a week longer.
"He is very ungrateiul," said Mr. John W. Gulteau,
referring to his wretched brother. "He has
no feeling at all for his relatives. When he was
giving his testimony telling about wandering over
the country with that book, It brought the tears to
my eyes. When I went up to his room, to give him
his sister's love, he saw the tears In my eyes. I
took his hand and said: 'Frank sends you her
love.' All he said was: 'What are you crying that
way for?'"
Mr. John W. Guiteau said last evening that so
far as he was concerned, the question of Jurisdiction
of this court would not be raised, unless the
Jury returned a palpably unfair verdict.
Gulteau had m iny visitors at the jail yesterday.
He was very cheerful, and expressed his opinion
that the trial would be over in a few days.
The record in the Gulteau case, being made by
Messrs. II. H. Alexander and Edward D. Easton,
the official stenographers, now comprises 809
pages of printed matter, it being published from
day to day at the Government Printing office in
pamphlet form. The indictment and the examination
of jurors and talesmen occupy 110 pages,
the opening argument and testimony for the
1 nlted States 156 pages and the opening argument
and testimony for the defense 543 pages. The
testimony of the prisoner, Guiteau, in his own behalf
occupies 200 pages. Three days were spent in
getting a Jury, four days in the testimony for the
government, and fourteen day* in the testimony
and argument for the defense. The record contains
a verbatim report, every word uttered on the
trial being preserved. In splteof the great labor

AT THE CAPITOL TO-DAY.
PROCEEDINGS IN THE SENATE.
APPOINTMENTS OF HOUSE OFFICERS.
THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES
In the Senate.
In the Senate to-day Messrs. Sherman, Pendleton,
Dawes, Lapham, Bayard and Morgan were appointed
by the chair on the Joint committee for the
preparation of a memorial upon the death of the
late President Garfield.
Among other communications laid before the
Senate was one from Acting Attorney General
Phillips, Inclosing the annual report of the Attorney
General.
A portion of the morning hour was consumed In
an uninteresting discussion upon the propriety of
dispensing with the reading at length of communications
from heads of departments addressed to
the President of the Senate, the question arising
upon a communication from the Secretary of War
In relation to accommodations for the Increased
clerical force in the Surgeon General's office.
The President pro tem. ruled that. In accordance
with the practice of his predecessor, the paper <
would be read at length, unless otherwise ordered,
and after remarks by Senators upon different interpretations
of what had been the practice heretofore.
a vote was taken, when a single response
was given both In the negative and affirmative.
The Chair caused some little merriment by observing
that as the vote was a tie he was obliged
to exercise his constitutional prerogative, and
would vote aye.
The reading then proceeded.
A large number of bills of a private nature,
mainly for Individual relief, were introduced and
referred.
The Talk About the Cabinet.
tub slate saio to bk completed.
The belief is that the President has made up
the Cabinet slate, and the names of those selected
will be sent to the Senate at an early date. It Is
said that a day or two ago a party of Senators
called upon the President to urge the claim of a
well-known public man for a Cabinet portfolio,
when the President brought the discussion to an
abrupt termination with the statement: "Gentlemen,
the matter Is already closed."
While It Is generally thought that Mr. B. Harris
Brewster will be made attorney general, those I
who ought to know claim that the appointment!
will only be temporary, and that iu the course or j
a few months Emory Storrs, of Illinois, will succeed
to the office, aud Secretary Lincoln be given I
an important foreign mission. I
The rumor is abroad, too, that the President has 1
decided in his own mind the person whom he .
contemplate appointing on the Supreme Bench I
to till the Clifford vacancy.
Secretary Hunt will not leave the Cabinet Inside J
of a month yet.
The ladles who strive for women suffrage were .
well represented at the Capitol to-d<iy. They want I
a standing committee in each house on women's ;
rights.
The House Committees.
Speaker Keifer is at work making up the committees
of the House, which will probably be
ready by the middle of next week. All published
statements as to who are to receive the important
chuicpianships are purely speculation. One of the
Speaker's friends Siiid this morning, that sum e or
the new members will be given prominent places.
House Officers Appointed.
Doorkeeper Brownlow, or the House ot Representatives,
has made the following appointments: ]
Richard W. Austin, of North Carolina, to be as- 1
sistant doorkeeper; Col. J. K. Popham, or Virginia, \
to be assistant doorkeeper In charge or the document
room. Col. Popham is a readjuster. Mr. ! 1
George McXelr, a son-in-law or Representative '
Burrows, of Mlchlaan, has been appointed assist- 1
ant postmaster of the House of Representatives. 1
Mr. McPherson, clerk of the House of Representatives,
said to a reporter of the Star to-uay that
while by Saturday he might make one or two
changes in the clerical force of his office, other- i
wise there would be no indiscriminate removals <
for weeks yet He authorizes also the statement t
that all published reports as to what he contemplated
doing are absolutely unrounded.
The point is raised that Col. John R. Popham, or
Virginia, cannot legally hold the position ot super- a
intendent or the House toldlng rooms. He Is now t
clerk ot the U. S. circuit court at Richmond, a
government position. His new appointment is
also a government position, and both places have
salaries attached. There Is a law against one >
person drawing two salaries rrom the government t
The scramble tor appointments under the House j
of Representatives Ls quite lively. All sorts of r
devices are being employed. Some applicants ?
for office have been approached by parties who g
offered to make up for them good records as Union
soldiers?on paper?for a consideration, and one
man, who was in fact a soldier, was warned that
his army record would be "torn all to pieces" I
unless he "came do wn with the cash." 1
Cancns of Republican Senators. J
The republican Senators held a short caucus
this morning, to arrange tor making some changes
In the republican membership ot the Senate committees,
In order to meet the personal convenience a
ot Senators, and more especially to provide sulta- s
ble committee positions for Mr. Windom, whose
re-entry this session makes It desirable In the
opinion of Ills colle.igues that he should again be
placed In committee positions of prominence. A i
committee was appointed by the caucus to confer c
with individual Senators and report hereafter. ^
