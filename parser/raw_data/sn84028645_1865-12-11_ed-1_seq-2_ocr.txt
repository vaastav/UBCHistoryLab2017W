The Position of "the Bourbon Democracy"

To-day the position of the Democracy of
" Obio "the Bourbon Democracy," as they
haye been referred to sneerinfrly Is a proud
one oue'that they can contemplate with
Ineffable saUstaction. On the 21st of June
the so-eatled UoM.party of Ohio met in
State Conveutlofc- In this city, and nom
inated their candidates and laid down
their Platform. In their first resolution
they1 gave notice to President 'Johssos
that'ln the"', treatment of vexed ques

The .waoifest object of thcirPlatlorm was

the elevation of the freed slaves to a politi

the only questions that rose into aufflcleDt
lrqportauce to attract their notice. To the
Constitution of the United States they
deigned no reference. - :-.
Ou the 24th of August the representatives
of the Ohio Democracy jnet in State Con

blage ever excelled it; and out - of that
assemblage a committee ot picked men
wis selected to draft a Platform ex
pressive of the views of the, Convention.
Their work was) ratified by a unanimous
vote of the Convention and by one hundred
and ulnety-three thousand voters on the
10th ot October. In these two ratifications.
the framers of the Platform could alone
find a, most substantial compliment. True,

wise. 5 The "Message emphatically , pro
nounces against every species of legisla
tion onlculated, to build up monopolies.
In tills connection, it is not necessary to
ask, .Will the President live up to the
teachings of his Message f" (And right
here It Is proper to say that he don't hand
over to Congress for revision, or conflrma-
' ttcm Vt repudiate, bis work of reorgan

-made the Judge ot the election returns

. It is sufficient to know, that every position
' assumed by the Democracy of Ohio in their
Platforni finds it Indorsement In the Pres-
' Ident's Message. This fact reuders the po

Democratic party ! In a mln6rity In nearly
all the States; Republican editors in a spirit

yet the roan who is President in conse-
' quince of the 'suffrages of the Republican
party, enforces the ideas of the Democratic
as the ones alone through which the Union
can be cemented, perpetuated and the hap

A Pulpit Politician Dissected.
; There is a' Presbyterian Preacher at
Wooster named Reed, whose '-loyalty" Is of
the intensest kind.' Our frieuds there say
he has habitually desecrated the pulplrof
his church by political preaching, which
has kept btin in hot water and bitter con
troversy for a long time. Uis choice epU
ties appear from week to week in the Abo
tition panei1 up there; and are characteristic
of the man. Our friend Dr. W, C, Mookx
has been applying his scalpel quite lrcely
through the columns of the Wooster Demo
. train, and has pretty effectually dlssecte hls
subject tlie Pulpit Politician aforesaid
We understand that Reed made himself
miserable last Summer over the speech of
Rev. Dr. WiLSONi of Louisville, which was
delivered in the Pittsburgh General Assem
bly, and reported by ns for Thb Statesman,
and reproduced In the Democrat. It is said
he has been in a bad way ever since; but
Dr. Moo r has disposed ot him. ; -

The Poor of North Alabama.
The Montgomery (Ala.) Advertiser has this
to say of the condition of the white popu
lation of North Alabama:
"The larger part of the white population
of thu Statu of Alabama is to be found in
the northern counties,' and the eastern
counties at the foot of the mountains. The
war produced In North and Northeastern
Alabama terrific results. , A large portion
of our armies was drawn from among her
men, and there was little slave labor in
those sections for the-cultivation of the
crops. ..Nearly all the work upon the farms
was necessarily done by the feeble hands
'of white women and children. The small
crops they could at most hope to raise this
'year were destroyed by the drought. The
.little money they possessed .at the time .of
the surrender waa all represented by Con-1
federate currency, which perished in their
hands. They bad not, like the people of
more favored sections of the State, anything
to sell that would bring them the means ot"!
support. There was no cotton there, and
the swaying to and fro of armies over
their homes left them with no stores of
food, no stocks of cattle, no flocks ot sheep,
no herds of swine. .. . . ,

it was rumored In'well-lnfonned circles
that the President will withdraw the Pro-,

States as soon as theConstltutional Amend
ment Is adopted, freedmen re given the
right to testify, and the rebel debt and acts
of secession are declared null and void;
that the military force will be withdrawn,
and the Freedmen'a Bureau also, as Soon asj
a spirit Is shown to give the freedmen a fair
trial; that he will then consider the work
of reconstruction complete and cannot but
recognize them as States npon a footing
with the Northern States: and that the war
will be declared at ari end. ' '

The Richmond (Va.) Times' Comments
on the President's Message.
Vfmge. : ....1; ."
j
Tho ntchtnond (Va.) Times of the 0th Inst,
gave expression to the following views in
regard to the President's Message and the
attitude in which he stands toward the
Southern people and the lludicii's of the
North. It will be seen thut the editor ex
presses no misgivings as to what the Presi
dent's course will be in the future, and de
clares that .he. arose "from the perusal oi
this Message with emotions of thankfulness
to God, that botweti our defeated W,t)oi
and the howling passions of a Radical Con
gress there is Interposed the granite will of
ADRtw - Johnson.",- From, this Juessage
the editor draws authority for the belief
that " the present Congress can do nothing
worse than to deny" to the South the repre-
sentatlon to which they are entitled that
beyond this they can not go, as the ,Presl-
dent is determined' to preveftt them from
being made "the victims of unjust and op
pressive legislation.'! We hope the Eich-
mond Times has read the horoscope of the
future correctly ; but we are keeping the
reader too long from the Times' editorial.
HereJt Is:. . . ,
The urofound anxiety of our readers will
be relieved this morning by the appearance
of the Message of President Andrew John
son. Its perusal will show that the popular
estimate of his patriotic firninees was not
erroneous, and that the exalted office which
he holds has elevated him high above the
clamors and menaces of faction. That An
drew Johnson possesses a full share of po
litical prejudices and human passions, none
of us, who are familiar with his antecedents,
entertain a doubt. The tragical event which
placed him in his present high position
aroused all those passions f jr a moment,
and the South found In his earliest utter
ances mnch So excite apprehension,- and
nothing to encourage our nascent hopes of
peace.
i The Message, which we publish to-day,
Is nevertheless the production of a states
man who has discarded all those passions
and Dreiudices from his breast, and dis
missed all considerations of party from hU)
councils. There is a calm, clear, dispas
sionate resolution in his views, and an ut
ter tailoring of the temporary Issues en
' gendered by fanaticism and kept alive by
the Dassions inflamed by civil war, which
shows that he feels that be is right, and
that time will vindicate his wisdom and pat
riotism. " ' :
1 1 Tne policy of reconstruction which be
foreshadowed in June last and enunciated
in bis address to the Southern delegation of
gentlemen who walted npon liiin in Octo
ber last, is presented in his Message. It is
very evident that he has not been shaken
In his adhesion to that policy by the lnte
overwhelming triumphs ot trie itepuoii
eans. nor have the uoit-y twitterings of such
political cock-sparrows as Col tux moved
hi in in the least from the path of duty.
I Important as are the official opinions of
President Johnson as to tne riguis oi me
States and the powers of the Federal Gov
ernment, they are destituteof the charm of
novelty, Because tie long since announceu
them in his interview with the South Car
olina committee which solicited the ap
pointment of Governor Perry. The doc
trines of secession and consolidation are
alike repudiated by him in his clear and
simple statement ot his conception of the
nature of our Government.
What is set forth in the President's an
nual Message is also precisely what he has
declared to every intelligent gentleman
who has conversed with liiin upon tiie sub
ject of his policy' of reconstruction.! His
argument against tne monstrous poucy oi
establishing military Governments in the
Southern States is perhaps oue of the most
striking and forcible portions of hU Mes
sage, it will arrest public attention, and
carry conviction to every breast which is
not the abode of passions and sectional
prejudices unworthy ot our race. - . j
To the South the firm, decided opinions
Of the rresi'lent npon thU subject will
brinar unspeakable ioy. As the Commander-
in-Chief of the army and nary he can, at any
nvjment, remove the military, and, as the 1'rexi-
lient of the United States, he can, by the exer
ciseofthe veto power, prevent the consummation
of all Radical schemes for garrisoning the
tiouth. He is completely master of the po
sition, and although a Radical Congress
may-exclude our representatives; they x;stn
not make us the victims of unjust and op
pressive legislation. ,,.r ., ,
i The whole tone of the Message convinces
as that the present Congress can do nothing
worse than deny us the representation to
Which we are entitled. Their power for
mischief besrins and ends with that canne-
less Inaultand affront to the South the
exclusion of our delegates. ; n y-j . ? n n
j The position or the rresiaent upon tne
subject of Congressional interference with
the exercise of the right of suffrage In the
States protects us from all' party factions
and fanatical legisIatkm-HPrfn that question.
As long as SuinncrAnd Steveus shall fall to

Overrule the veto, they, will ,be Impotent in

than in the cities and villages. ,rwimps,
the'general demoralization which the last
few years have been Instrnmental In prod uc-
ing, is more virulent In the rural districts
than in the more densely populated places.
NTiimprniiB cases of larceny' and other
crimes frequently occur in the country in
this vicinltv. ol which we sildom hear un
til a considerable lapse of time after they
have taken place. We give a few samples
of recent date.
.A few nights since B. 15; William, resid
ing a few mifes east of 'the city, was re
lieved of lour Urge fat bogs by thieves who
entered the pen, cut the hops' throats and
carried them off without Wing observed or
creatine anv disturbance; Tiny must have
been arofr In hog-stealing.: Four lajge
hogswere also stolen lately from Messrs
D. & P.. Hess Ju similar quiet manner. T
i But' one of the most surprising larcenies
We have heard of for some timo is said to
have occurred not long ago w Truro town
ship. K is the stealing of allot kof seventy
sheep from Gilbert Green, of that township,
so successfully and with such adroitness,
that no trace ot the sheep or the thieves has
been yet obtained.

is known to the community that the above
Institution has found such favor in the eyes
Of the publlc thattheold building became
inadvqunte to the wants , of the rapidly In

Naugbton Hall for that purpose. ;The
ladies, who have already began to con
tribute to this enterprise, earnestly call
upon all to unite with them, and make this
Fair still more attractive and entertaining

A Grand Exhibition.
We had the preasore on Saturday of an
invitation from Mr. J. M. Kinney (who Is
well known to be one of the most Indefati
gable managers in our country, and the
originator ot some of the grandest exhibi
tions ever yet gotten up), to Inspect the
stupendous and magnificent Diorama, rep
resenting the Funeral Oiiskquies of the
late lamented President Abraham Lin
coln. Tills exhibition Is one of happiest
and grandest ideas that has over emanated
from the proline brain ot our friend Kin
ney, and he assures us that it Is his Inten
tion to represent the trAoa of the funeral
processions, as they actually appeared-lu
each and every city In which the corpse pass
ed through, from Washington City to. the
final resting place lit Springfield, Illinois;
correct views of the most prominent build
ings, hotels, railroad depots, Ac, In each
city. In order to represent the varioiiB
i in tho iiifWiMif. cities. It will
JUUI IJUJ " ' - .
require the enormous number of 850,000
movable figures, all of which will oe gotten
ii n tn Imitation of the various societies,
trades, civilians, soldiers, firemen, carri
railroad cars. &c, and will be made
to move In life-like style. Every one of
the magnificent, catafalques, or hearses,
... hi ..n..
used In the several cities, win do iaiuinuiy
rpnresentcd : also, the splendid train ol fu
neral railroad cars used to convey the re
mains and escorts from yashlngtou to
Springfield will be represented, with all the
mechanical effects of ste'arji, smoke,
Ac. ' .
Mr. K. has been engaged for over six
months with tho Artist, Mr. John E. Leslie,
and several assistants in getting, up this
woijderlul, popular, and which, no doubt,
will be the most profitable exhibition that
has ever been conceived; In fact, every one
wh-vhas heard of tho exhibition, predicts a
brilliant future and a fortune for the enter:
prising originator of this great moral en
tertainment. Tho expense of getting up
such an exhibition .must necessarily bg
enormous, and Mr. K. has had many obsta
cles to contend with (having not made a
fortune during, or off the war)! but by his
indomlt ible per-everance, wc are happy to
announce tliat lie will be enabled to present
this glgantld' exhibition to the public in
about lour weeks, and we are assured by
those who have watched the career" of Mrf
Kinney lor many years, that he never "yet
undertook to get up anything, but what he
carried1 through, sink or stci'm J ' Bo pre
pared to see something wonderlul, aston
ishing and beautiful I
1 Whatever John M. Kinney gets hp or
brings before the public, Is sure- to be well
done, as evidence Of which, we have only
to refer our readers to the many exhibi
tions and numerous .really beautiful decor
ations designed and eotten nn bv him on
various occasions, and ior which Columbus
can well boast, for nearly twenty years.
Fuddled Rats.
! An exchange says a servant girl In
uncertain region known as "Out West" re
cently tried whisky to kill rats. She made
It sweet with sugar, crumbled in bread, and
Set the dish In the cellar. A few hours al
ter she went down and found the rats glo
rlously . "fuddled," engaged In throwing
potato parings and hauling one another up
todriuk. These were, easily disposed of.
Those not killed left the premises imme
diately, undoubtedly suffering Iroin a severe
headache. '- -
