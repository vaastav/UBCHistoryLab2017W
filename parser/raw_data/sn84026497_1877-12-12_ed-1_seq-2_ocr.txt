Washington, D. C, Dec. 8, 77
Kvfrybotly appears to find some
thing to commend in tho President's
first annual message, and somttliiug to
ii?sent from. Ila merits, as a com
prehensive, rell-wrilten State docu
ment ia conceded by all, Tho follow
ers of Bland and Kwing are mad, and
tlieir reserve fund of profanity was
never nearer complete exhaustion and
total collapse than now, from the al
most continuous drafts on it since the
President's attitude on the silver and
resumption matters becams cuthort
tively known. When the President
authorized the denial of the statement
imputed to him to the effect that he
would veto the bills engineered through
the House by those two gentlemen, the
conclusion was jumped at that lie was
really in accord with their purpose
and that his' influence was assured in
tlieir behalf. They had both safely
run the gauntlet of the House, the
prospect was thought good for their
passago by the Senate, and the early
adoption of the views embodied in
them by the country in its financial
policy, was deemed a foregone conclu
&ion. The message came as a thunder
bolt from a cloudless sky. There are
signs of an attempt to rally, however.
Bland is reported to have said 'that
the adhcreuts of his bill are prepared
- to force extreme measures, and to have
threatened the alternative to the Pres
ident cither to smother his convictions
and lend a helping hand or to prepare
himself to administer the Government
without appropriations.
It is idle to cite intelligent oppo
nents of the ''Southern Policy" to the
tolerance wrought thereby among Ku
Klux Democracy or elsewhere, when
uot,one of the participants in the
butchery of the Chisholms has been
made to suffer for that shocking bar
barity, and when a man, in recognition
of his leadership in a crime equally
atrocious agaiust political opponents,
is forced into a seat in the highest leg
islative body known to our form of
government, by the solid vote of the
party representatives, aided by such
votes as could be secured from the pp-
position oy aiiegea corruption or ter
rorism. Nor will those believing that
the continued supremacy of the great
political party that fought the war of
the Union is still necessary to the per
petuity of free institutions and repre
sentative Government, be persuaded
into an endorsement of a policy which
lias reacted so disastrously upon its
organization throughout the late in
surrectionary States, as to leave it
practically dead, with the rifle-club
Democracy never more firmly en
trenched in the position it vacated.
Whatever may bo said to the contrary,
events In file Senate during the past
two weeks must be accepted as - indi
cating the virtual reunion of the Re
publican party leaders against the fur
ther encroachments of exultan, arro
gant Democracy under the dictation
of the "Solid South."
Polk, the latest successor to the im
mortal Fifzhugb, appears to have
yielded to hallucinations that will
prove as fatal to his aspirations as
those entertained by the latter gentle
man did to his. It is now said thatiu
order to secure his calling and election
Lis promises of official favors were so
recklessly given that about forty im
portunate office-beggars were appoint
ed to positions under bira in excess of
those provided for by law ; and when
pay day came around nothing was left
to recompense them for their ar
duous services in keeping forty or more
chairs warm in out-of-the-way corners
on the House side of the Capitol. They
set up an indignant howl of protesta
tion at such treatment. Polk, in his
dismay, appealed to his party to vote
jffictent money from the public fuads
to pay each a month's salary, so he
, auld satisfy the demands, discharge
nd pack them off to the homes they
hud been induced to leave to serve
tlieir country. Such a resolution is
said to Lave been prepared, and an ef
fort will be made to pass it. There is
not the slightest warrant in law for
this contemplated raid on tljp Treasu
ry, and it can be regarded as nothing
4 a flagrant piece of robbery, to re
tt"Keform" Democrat of obliga
' 'jally contracted to secure his
own preferment. His fate is proba
bly sealed, whatever course it may bo
decided to adopt towards his victims
of misplaced confidence.
Out of the 1800 bills sntroduceJ at
the Extra Session, all passed except
1 1798. That is, at a session reudcrcd
necessary by Democratic hate and
malice towards the Army and Navy,
continued seven weeks, at a cost of
many thousands to J'ie taxpayer, just
two bills, which should have been
passed last winter, were worried
through. It is not very easy to see
whero the economy comes in.
The stampede of the Sioux Indians
in process of removal from their reser
vation to the Missouri, is regarded at
tho War Department and at tho Indian
Office as ominous of another Indian
war.
The visit of General Ord and other
officers from the Rio Gtaude to give
their views of the prospects there, has
been followed by orders for reinforcing
our Army in that quarter; and the
General's views, as ho is reported to
have expressed them, leads to the con
viction that the complications on our
Southern border may easily lead to
overt acts of war at any moment. .
The proceedings of Congress since
the opening of the regular session have
been devoid of public interest. All
are awaiting a renewal of the struggle
transferred to this session, aud which
it is believed is inevitable.
Peterson's Magazine for January
is the most superb number ever issued
of that popular lady's book. There
are two steel engravings, "Cupid iu the
Rain," and "Borrowed Plumes." Be
sides these, there is a double-size Paris
fashion plate, elegautly colored, a pic
ture in itself ; and also two very beau
tiful colored patterns for working
Ornamental table cloths in crewel. In
all there are aboot fifty engravings in
the number. The stories are all orin-
O
nal, ard by the best authors. With
this number appears, as a supplement,
a full-size diagram pattern for a Coat
Bodice for a lady, the last thing in
fashion. This alone is worth the price
of the number. The price is astonish
ingly low, viz : two dollars a copy for
one year, postage paid. T clubs it 13
lower still, viz : five copies for $8.00,
or seven for SI 0.50, with . an extra
copy for getting up the club, all post
age free. Specimens are sent gratis,
to get up clubs. Address Chas. J.
