WEIRD TALE
"THE TALE OF WAH-KON-TO-OCH-KEE-AH"
OF OSAGE NATION.
Central Figure of Most Famous Osage
Battle of Unwritten History.
Pawnee. O. T., Dec. 12. The following
is tho weird story of one of the most fa
mous battles in the history of the Osago
Indians. There arc many such stories,
the scenes of which are in Pawnee county
and other parts of northeastern Okb
lioma, where the Osages made their
homes and their history, says tho Dis
patch. It is "The tale of Wah-kon-ta-och-kec-

The prophet had moved his camp across

. , , , . .i ,-,
ready to go. The following morning tho
' . . , .
j He wore a-long-tailed, red coat, such as
the government presented to chiefs and
head men years ago. The party started
in a southwestern direction, and sighted
the first buffalo on what the Osages call
Crescent creek. This creek Is the first
branch that empties Into Red Rock from
TT ' . . . .
Here again the old man begged his fol-
, . , , , .,..,

home, but again his warning was unhced-

, ed. Scorning to kill the few leaders, they
dashed into the midst of the buffaloes,
killing only the choicest and fattest.
They neared the head of the creek men
tioned when a large force of Indians ap
peared on the hillt and turrlng to flee,
they found that another party had cut off
their retreat. Tho only thing that re
mained for them to do was to go Into
tho creek and fight it out as best they
could.
Although the old man's warning had
been unheeded, he was determined to
save ma louowers. riis reu coat maue

These tactics were repeated all day
until about sundown, when an arrow
struck tho "bid man just above tho tem
ple. Although stricken unto death, he
still thought of the welfaro of his fol
lowers, 'and as darkness was near, he
; asked them to conceal him In a thicket.
He promised to return to them In four
days, providing he was left alono with
the buzzards. "I want to live," ware his
words. "If you loave me, with the help
of the buzzards I will recover within four
days, but If you tako me along I will
only- be In your way and will surely
die."
Thus persuaded, they concealed him In
a thicket and started homeward, but find
ing that their enemies had left the battle
field, and hearing them mourn on the dis
tant hills, they "decided to go back and
bring the old prophet with them, as they
would be derided as cowards If they re
turned without him. They carried him to
the camp on Calt creek, and ten days
later his words came true. He was bu
ried in tho grave mentioned above.
The writer has heard the above story
many times from tho older members of
the Osage tribe, and whatever Its merits
may be, he is convinced that they firmly
believe that the old man had the power
ascribed to him, and when the writer

Leavenworth Man Wounded
by 18 Year Old Girl.
BECAUSE HE ABUSED HER
Girl Warned Him Not to Call
Her Names.
Leavenworth, Kan., Dec 12. Miss
ilabel Coon yesterdny afternoon at 3
o'clock 3hot her step-father, Charles Hill,
becausa he abused her and hor mother.
The lS-year-old girl fired three times at
tho man. He was struck once in the left
arm between the elbow and the shoulder.
The shootlns occurred at the heme of the
family.
On August 5, Mrs. Coons married Chas.
Hill in Kansas City. The woman and 'the
girl both say that since tha marriage Hill
has been Intoxicated nearly all the tlmo.
Ho abused his wife and step-daughter so
frequently that Miss Coons Anally went
to s member of the police force and com
plained. This man, a city detective, told
her to set a gun and shoot Hill the next
time he abused her.
Yesterday afternoon Hill went home
Intoxicated. Tho girl says ho at once be
gan calling her vile names. She told him
if he applied a certain vlla epithet to Iter
again she would shoot him. He at once
used it again and the girl shot at him
three times. Ho was struck in. the arm
and a bad flesh wound inflicted.
Miss Coon went to Chief Cranston aad
gavo herself up. After hearing her story
the chief allowed the girl to goiter way.
It Is probable Hill will be arrested on .1
chargo of slander.
Hill came down town and 1 reporter
saw him when he was going to a physi
cian. The reporter had bean told of the
occurence a half minnte before and he
approached Hill and asked about the af
fair. Tho man was plainly under the In
fluence of liquor and consigned the re
porter to a place where overcoats are not
needed. Ho refused to answer any ques
tions. Hill went to a lawyer and tried to get
a warrant for Miss Coon. The lawyer
refused to do anything until he had in
vestigated and after he had done this he
refused still more positively.
Miss Coon Is a very pretty and lady
llko girl and most people who know her
are surprised at the nerve she displayed.
She I3 employed at tho cigur stand at
tho Planters Hotel.
Thero is nothing dangerous about tho
wound Hill received unless blood poison
ing sets in. He was about as badly
frightened as a man could be.
TO BE MONSTER EXPERIMENT
State Officers Take Farm on Ft. Hays
Reservation.
Topeka, Kan., Dec. 12. F. D. Coburn.
secretary of tho state board of agricul
ture, and Senator S. J. Stewart, members
of tho state board of regents of the State
Agriculture, and Prof Cottrell, one of the
faculty of the Institution, have been at
Fort Hays Inspecting the reserva
tion recently ceded to the state by the
federal government, upon which it is pro
posed to establish a branch normal col
lege and an agricultural experiment sta
tion. The Idea of tho regents Is to es
tablish on the reservation the largest ex
periment station in the country.
The experiment station at Manhattan,
which Is conducted in connection with the
State Agricultural college, is not large
enough to make all the experiments nec
essary For instance. In m&ay.cases it in
possible to plant only small plants of cer
tain grains qr forage plants perhaps a
tenth, or a quarter, or half an acre.
While these aro extremely useful as far
as they go, they are not as practical as
thoy would be if conducted on the same
ecnle that a farmer raises them.
On the Fort Hays "reservation the re
gents will have from 20 to Si farms of 160
acres each, on which to conduct experi
ments. It will bo possible to plant or
sow fields of 40 ami SO acres, in the place
of the little plots of ground th size of a
town lot. Experiments can be conducted
on an extensive scale with wheat, corn,
barley, alfalfa, ksflr corn, cow peas and
everything else that may be of benefit to
a western Kansas fanner, on the same
fjcale and under the same conditions that
the farmer himself would be placed.
