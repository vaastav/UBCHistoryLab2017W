ROOSEVELT'S MESSAGE
President's Annual Communi
cation ©elivered to Congress
at Washington.
STRONG FOR RATE REFORM
Makes Many Suggestions, but This Is
the Chief One—Would Supervise
Insurance—Not Ripo for
Tariff Reform.
Washington, D. C. Dec. 5.—President
Hoosevelt delivered his annual message
to congress today. The document was
•a lengthy one of more than 25,000
.words. It breathes reform from first
to last. Chief and' foremost is the
demand for rate legislation which he
goes into in great detail. He also rec
ognizes the insurance evils and urges
federal supervision of insurance and
of other great corporations. He fails
to recommend revision of the tariff,
saying it is not required as yet. His
message in part follows:
To the senate and house of representa
tives:
The people of this country continue to
enjoy great prosperity. Undoubtedly there
will be. ebb ana lloiv in such prosperity,
and this ebb and How will be felt more or
less by all members of the community,
both by the deserving and the undeserving.
Against the wrath of the Lord the wisdom
'oi! man can not avail in times of flood or
drought human ingenuity can but partially
repair the disaster. A general failure of
crops would hurt all of us. Again, if the
folly of man mars the general well-being,
then those who are innocent of the folly
will have to pay part of the penalty in
curred by those who are suilty of the folly.
A panic brought on by the speculative foliv
ot part oL the business community would
hurt the wlioie business community. But
such stoppage of welfare, though it might
be severe, would not be lasting. In the
long run the one vital factor in the perma
nent prosperity of the country is the high
individual character o£ the average Amer
ican worker, the average American citizen,
no matter whether his work be mental or
manual, whether he bo farmer or wage
worker, business man or professional man.
Control of Corporations.
The fortunes amassed through corporate
organisation are now so large, and vest
*ueh power in those that wield them, as to
make i! a matter of necessity to give to
the sovereign—that is, to the "government,
which represents the people as a whole—
some etieetive power of supervision over
their corporate use. In order to insure a
healthy social and Industrial life, every
big corporation should be held responsible
by, and be accountable to, some sovereign
strong enough to control its conduct. 1 am
in no sense hostile to corporations. This
is an
{Iffs
until is certain that the result can not
ue oblaiiK'd under the constitution as it
now is.
What is needed is not sweeping prohibi
tion ot every arrangement, good or bad
which may tend
bu
lation
competition rrom being to the detriment or'
the public—as well as such supervision and
regulation as will prevent other abuses in
210 way connected with restriction of com
petition.

an
of combination, and any effort
to prevent r.'U combination will be not only
useless, but in the end vicious, because of
the contempt for law which the failure to
enforce law inevitably produces. The cor
poration lias come to stay, just as the
trade union lias come to stav! JCaeh can
do and has done great good. "Each should
.be favored so long as it does good. But
each should be sharply checked where it
acts against law and justice.
iitate Legislation Impotent.
Experience has shown conclusivciv that
It is useless to try to get any adequate
regulation and supervision of these great
.corporations by state action. Such regu
lation and supervision can only be effec
tively exorcised by a sovereign whose
jurisdiction is co extensive with the field of
work ot the corporation—that is, by the
national government. I believe that this
regulation and supervision can be obtained
by the enactment of law by the congress.
It it proves impossible, it will certainly be
necessary ultimately to confer in fullest
lorm such power upon the national govern
ment by a proper amendment of the con
stitution. would obviously be unwise to
eiic.oavor
JH'cuiv
such, an
•.iiirtViuiriiL, yuoil or UaU,
which may tend [o restrict competition,
(jut such adequate supervision and regu
lation as will prevent any restriction' of
Abuse cf Cvar-Capitallzation.
Of these abuses, perhaps the chief, al
though by no means the only one, is over
eapitaiiziirion—generally itself the result
of dishonest promotion—because of the
myriad evils it brings in its train for such
overcapitalization often means an inllation
that invites business panic it always con
ceals the true rolalion of the profit earned
to the capital actually invested, and it
creates a, burden of interest payments
Inch is a fertile cause of improper reduc
tion in or limitation ot wag^s it damages
the small investor, discourages thrift and
encourages gambling and speculation
Willie perhaps worst of all Is the triekiness
and dishonesty which it implies—for harm
to morals is worse than any possible harm
to material interests, and the debauchery
of politics and business by great dishonest
corporations is far worse than any actual
material evil they do the public.
Railroad Rats Legislation.
The first thing to do is to deal with the
great corporations engaged in the busi
ness of interstate transportation. As I
said inniy message of December li last, the
Immediate and most pressing need, so far
as legislation is concerned, is the enact
ment into law of some scheme to secure
to the agents of the government such su
pervision and regulation of the rates
charged by the railroads of the country
engaged in interstate traffic as shall sum
marily and effectively prevent the imposi
tion of unjust or unreasonable rates. It
must include putting a complete stop to
rebates in every shape and form. This
power to regulate rates, like all s.lmUar
powers over the business world, should be
exercised with moderation, caution, and
self restraint but it shouid exist, so that
it can be effectively exercised when the
need arises.
Commission Must Be Administrative.
The first consideration to be kent in
mind is that the power should be tiflima
'tive and should be given to some adminis
trative body created by the congress. If
given to the present Interstate Commerce
commission or to a reorganized Interstate
Commerce commissitn, such commission
should be made unequivocally administra
tive.
Suggests the Terms.
It is not my province to indicate the ex
act terms of the law which should l,e en
acted but 1 call the attention of the con
gress to certain existing conditions with I
Which it Is desirable to deal. In my judg
xnent the most important provision which
euch law should contain is that conferring
upon some competent administrative bodv
the power to decide, upon the case being
brought before it. whether a given rate
prescribed by a ra'.lroad is reasonable and
just, and if it is found to be unreasonable
and unji-.M, then, after full investigation
of (he, complaint, to prescribe the limit
of the rale beyond which it shall not be
lawful to go—the maximum reasonable
rate, as it is commonly called—this de
cision to go into effect within a reasonable
time and to obtain from thence onward,
subject to review by the courts.
Prohibit Too Low Rates.
It sometimes happens at present, notthat
a rate Is too high but that a favored ship
per is given too low a rate. In such case
the commission would have the right to
Ibc this already established minimum rate
as the maximum and it would need only
one or two such decisions by the commis
sion to cure railroad companies of the
practice of giving Improper minimum
rates.
I call your attention to the fact that my
propoeal is not to give the commission
power in initiate or originate rates gen
erally. but to regulate a rate already ttxed
or originated by the roads, upon com
plaint and after investigation. A heavy
penalty Bhould be exacted from any cor­
.m
poration which fails to respect an order
of the commission. I regard this power
to establish a maximum rate as being es
sential to any scheme of real reform in
the matter of railway regulation. The
iirst necessity is t0 secure it and unless it
is granted to the commission there is lit
tle use of touching the subject at all.
To Punish Ail Subterfuges.
Ihegal transactions often occur under
the lorrns of law. It has often occurred
•mat a shipper has been told by a traffic
otticer to buy a large quantity of some
commodity and then after it has been
bought an open reduction is made in the
rate to take effect immediately, the ar
rangement resulting tj the profit of the
one shipper and the one railroad and to
the damage of all their competitors: for
it must not he forgotten that the big'ship
pers are at least as much to blame as any
railroad in the matter of rebates. The
law should make it clear so that nobody
can fail to understand that any kind of
commission paid on freight shipments,
whether in this form or in the form of
lictitious damages, or of» a concession, a
free pass, reduced passenger rate, or pay
ment cf brokerage, is illegal.
wort:h
while considering whether it
would not be wise to confer on the gov
ernment the right of civil action against
the beneficiary of a rebate for at least
twice tiie value of the rebate this would
help stop what is really blackmail. Ele
vator allowances should bo stopped, for
they have now grown to such an extent
that they are demoralizing and are used
as rebates.
.Control Over Private Car Lines.
All private-car lines, industrial roads, re
frigerator charges, and tho like should be
expressly put under the supervision of
the Interstate Commerce commission or
some similar body so far as rates, and
agreements practically affecting rates, and
concerned. Tho private-car owners and
the owners of industrial railroads are en
titled to a fair and reasonable compensa
tion on their investment, but neither pri
vate cars nor industrial railroads nor
spur tracks should be utilized as devices
lor securing preferential rates. A rebate
'.'I Jc}ng charges, or in mileage, or in a
division of the rate for refrigerating
cnarges is just as pernicious as a rebate in
other way. No lower rates should
app.y on goods imported than actually ob
tains on domestic goods from the Ameri
can seaboard to destination except in
cases where water competition is the con
trolling influence.
Publicity Is Much Needed.
There should bo publicity 6f the ac
counts of common carriers no common
carrier engaged in interstate business
should keep any books of memoranda oth
er than those reported pursuant to law or
regulation, and these books or memoranda
should he open to the inspection of the
go\ ernment. Only in this way can viola
tions or evasions of the law be surely de
tected. A system of examination of rail
road accounts should be provided similar
to that now conducted into the national
banks by the bank examiners a few first
class railroad accountants, if they had
proper direction and proper authority to
inspect books and papers, could accom
plish much in preventing willful viola
tions of the law.
Courts to Act Rapidly.
I urge upon the congress the need of pro
viding tor expeditious action by the In
terstate Commerce commission in all these
matters, whether in regulating rates for
transportation or for storing or for liandl
l'r.°Pel"ty or commodities in transit,
ihe history of the cases litigated under
the present commerce act shows that its
olfipacy Ins been to a great degree de
stroyed by the weapon of delay, almost
the most lormidable weapon in the hands
ol those whose purpose it is to violate the
law.
The Labor Question.
The question of securing a healthy, self
respecting and mutually sympathetic at
titude as between employer and employe,
capitalist and wage worker, is a difficult
one. All phases of the labor problem
prove tllcult when approached. But the
underlying principles, ihu root principles
in accordance with which the problem
must be solved, are entirely simple. We
can get justice and right dealing only
it we put as cf paramount importance
the principle of treating a man on his
worth as a man rather than with refer
ence to his social position, his occupa
tion, or the class to which he belongs,
there are selfish and brutal men in all
ranks of life.
This government is not and never shall
be government by a plutocracy. This
government is not and never shall be
government by a mob. It shall continue
to be in the future what it has been in
tic past, a government based on the
theory that cae'n man, rich or poor is
to be treated simply and solely on his
worth as a man, that all his personal and
property rights are to be safeguarded
and that he is neither to wrong others
nor to suffer wrong from others.
To Regulate Life Insurance.
The great Insurance companies afford
striking- examples of corporations wlioi-o
business lias extended so far beyond the
jurisdiction of the states, which* created
them as to preclude strict enforcement of
supervision and regulation by the parent
snilis. in my last annual mesiaice 1 recom
mended "that congress carefully consider
Whetner the power of the bureau of cor
porations can not constitutionally be ex
tended to cover interstate transactions in
insurance."
Kecent events have emphasized the im
portance of an early and exhaustive con
sideration of tills question, to see whether
it is not possible to furnish better safe
guards than the several states have been
able to furnish against corruption of the
llagrant kind which has been exposed
It has been only too clearly shown that
certain 01' the men at th" le ad of these
large corporations take but :ma!l note of
the ethical distinction bctwe-. lioe.tv
and dishonesty they draw the it oniy
this side of what may be called iaw
honesty, the kind of lionestv necessary in
order to avoid falling info the clutches of
the law.
State Supervision Inadequate.
1 repeat my previous recommendation
that tho congress should also consider
whether the federal government has any
power or owes any duty wiLn respect lo
domestic transactions In insurance of an
interstate character. That state supervi
sion has proved inadequate is generally
conceded. The burden upon insurance
companies, and therefore their policy hold
ers, oi conflicting regulations of many
states, is unquestioned, while but little
effective check is imposed upon any able
and unscrupulous man who desires lo ex
ploit the company in his own interest al
the expense of the policy holders and of
the public.
As a remedy for this evil of conllietinc.
ineffective, and vet burdensome regulations
there has been for many years a wide
spread demand for federal siiperv.sion. Tne
congress has already recognized that in
terstate insurance may be a proper subiect
for federal legislation, for in creating the
bureau of coroorai'.ms it authorized*it to
publish and suppiy useful information con
cerning interstate corporations, "including
corporations engaged in insurance." Whin
is said above applies with equal force to
fraternal and benevolent organizations
which contract for life insurance.
Takes Up the Tsriit.
There is more need o" stability than of
the attempt zc attain an ideal pcrieciion
in the methods, of raising revenue: and the
shock and strain to tiie business v.oral
certain to attend any serious change in
these methods rer.rk-r such change inad
visable unless for grave reason, it is not
possible to lay down any general rule by
which to determine the moment when the
reasons for will outweigh the reasons
against such a change. Much must de
pend, not merely on the needs, but on ihe
desires, of the people as a wlioie for needs
and desires are not necessarily identical.
Of course no change can be made on
lines beneficial to, or desired by, one sec
tion or one state only. Theri must be
some thing like a general agreement
among the citizens of tne several states, as
represented in the congress, that the
change is needed and desired in the inter
est of the people as whole. In time of
peace and revenues much on the average,
taking a series of years together, equal the
expenditures or vise the revenues must
be increased. Last year there was a de
ficit.
Unless our expenditures can be kept
within the revenues then our revenue
laws must be readjusted.
Too Early to Revise Tariff.
It is as yet too early to attempt to out
line what shape such a readjustment
should take, foT It Is as yet too early to
say whether there will be need for it.
It should be considered whether It is not
desirable that the tariff lawn should pro
vide for applying as against or In favor of
any other nation maximum and minimum
tariff rates established by the congress, so
as to secure a certain reciprocity of treat-
lit
Every consideration of prudence de
mands the addition of the element of
elasticity to our currency system. The
evil does not consist in an inadequate
volume of money, but in the Tigidity of.
this volume, which does not respond as
it should to the varying needs of com
munities and of seasons. Inflation must
be avoided: but some provision should
be made that will insure a larger volume
of money during the fall and winter
months than In the less active seasons
of the year so that tiie currency will
contract against speculation, and will
expand for the needs of legitimate bus
ness. At present the treasury depart
ment is at irregularly recurring inter
ya obliged, in the interest of the bus
iness world—that is, in the interests of
the American public—to try to avert
financial crises by providing a remedy
which should be provided by congres
sional action.
Scrutinize Campaign Gifts.
I desire to re.oeat this recommendation:
In political campaigns in a country as
large and populous as ours It is inevit
able that there should be much expense
of an entirely legitimate kind. This, of
course, mean Lhat many contributions,
and some of them of large size, must
be made, and, as a matter of fact, in any
big political contest such contributions
are always made to both sides. It is
entirely proper both to give an receive
them, unless there is an Improper motive
connected with either gift or reception.
If they are extorted by any kind of pres
sure or promise, express or implied, di
rect or indirect in the way of favor or
immunity, then the giving or receiving
becomes not only improper but criminal.
It will undoubtedly be difficult as a
matter of practical detail to shape an
act which shall guard with reasonable
certainty against such misconduct: but
if it is possible to secure by law the full
and verified publication in detail of all
the sums contributed to and expended
by the candidates or committees of any
political parties, the result can not but
be wholesome.
Stop Insurance Campaign Funds.
All contributions by corporations to any
political committee or for any political
purpose should be forbidden by law di
rectors should not be permitted to use
stockholders' money- for such purposes
and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind
would be, as far as it went, an effective
method of stopping tho evils aimed at in
corrupt practices acts. Not only should
both tho national and the several state
legislatures forbid any officer of a corpo
ration from using the money of the
corporation in or about any election, but
they should also forbid such use of
money in connection with any legislation
save by the employment of counsel in
public manner for distinctly legal serv
ices.
Takes Up Peace Question.
More and more war is coming to be
looked upon as in itself a lamentable and
evil thing. A wanton or useless war, or
a war of mere aggression—in short, any
war begun or carried an in a conscience
less spirit, is to be condemned as a pecu
liarly atrocious crime against all hu
manity. Whenever it is possible for a
nation or an individual to work for real
peace, assuredly it is failure of duty not
so to strive but if war is necessary and
righteous then either the man or the
nation shrinking from it forfeits all title
to self respect. We have scant sympathy
with the sentimentalist who dreads op
pression less than physical suffering, who
would prefer a shameful peace to the
pain and toil sometimes lamentably nec
essary in order to secure a righteous
peace.
International Arbitration.
Very much can be done through another
Hague conference in this direction, and I
most earnestly urge that this nation do all
in Us power to try to further the move
ment and to make tho result of the de
cisions of Tho Hague conference effective.
I earnestly hope that tho conference may
be able to devise some way to make arbi
tration between nations the customary
way of settling international disputes in
all save a few classes of cases, which
should themselves be as sharply defined
and rigidly limited as tho present gov
ernmental and social development of the
world will permit. If possible there should
be a general arbitration tiveaty negotiated
among all the nations represented at the
conference.
The Monroe Doctrine.
One of the most effective instruments for
peace is the Monroe doctrine as it lias
been and is being gradually developed by
this nation and acccpted by oCher nti
tions. No other policy could have been as
efficient in promoting peaco in tho western
hemisphere and in giving to each nation
thereon the chance to develop along its
own lines. If we had refused to apply
the doctrine to changing conditions it
would now be completely outworn, would
not meet any of the needs of the present
day, and indeed would probably bv this
tune havo sunk into complete oblivion
That our rights and interests are deep
ly concerned in the maintenance of the
doctrine is so clear as hardly to need
argument. This is especially true in view
of the construction of the Panama canal
As a mere matter or self-defense we must
exercise a close watch over the approaches
to this canal: and this means that we must
bo thoroughly alive to our interests in the
Caribbean sea.
Not a Means of Aggression.
There are certain essential points which
must never be forgotten as regards tne
Monroe doctrine. In the first

must as a nation make it evident that wo
do not intend to treat it in any shape or
way as a excuse for aggrandizement on
our par at the cxpem.e of the revuihl.es

that In some Sou:h American countries
iliere has been much suspicion lest we
should interpret the .Monroe doctrine as in

against foreign nations. If a republic to

There was imminent danger of foreign
Interventional The previous rulers of San
to Domingo had recklessly incurred debts
and owing to her internal disorders she
had ceased to be able to
provide
means
of paying the debts. The patience of her
foreign creditors had become exhausted,
and at least two foreign nations were on
the point of intervention, and were only
prevented from intervening by the un
official assurance of this government that
it would Itself strive to help Santo Do
mingo in her hour of need. In the case
of one of these nations, only the ac
tual opening of negotiations to this end
by our government prevented the seizure
Of tyritory in Santa Domingo by a Eu
ropean power. Of the debts Incurred some
were just, while some were not of a
character which really renders it obli
gatory on, or proper tor, faanto Domingo
to pay them in full. But she could not
pay any of them unless some stability
was assured her government and people.
Asks Support for Treaty.
Accordingly the executive department
of our government negotiated a treaty
under which we are to try to help the
Dominican people to straighten out their
finances. This treaty is pending before
the senate-. In the meantime a temporary
arrangement has been made which will
last until the senate has had time to
take action upon the treaty. Under this
arrangement the Dominican government
has appointed Americans to all the im
portant positions in the customs service,
and they are seeing to tho honest collec
tion of the revenues, turning over -15 per
cent, to tho government for running ex
penses and putting the other 55 per cent,
into a safe depository for equitable divi
sion in case the treaty shall be ratified,
among the various creditors, whether
European or American.
This has completely discouraged all rev
olutionary movement, while it has al
ready produced such an increaso in the
revenues that the government is actuallv
gettiiig more from tho 45 per cent, that
tiie American collectors' turn over to it
than It got formerly when it took the
entire revenue. It is enabling tho poor
harassed people 5f Santo Domingo once
more to turn their attention to industry
and to bo free from the curse of inter
minable revolutionary disturbance.
There is, of course, opposition to the
treaty from dishonest creditors, foreign
and American, and from the professional
revolutionists of the island itself.
The Army and Navy.
We cannot consider the question of our
foreign policy without at the same time
treating of the army and navy. We now
have a very small army—indeed, one well
nigh infinitesimal when compared with tho
army of any other largo nation.
Of courso the army we do have should bo
as nearly perfect of its kind and for its
size as is possible. I do not believe that
any army in the world has a bettdV" aver
age of enlisted man or a better typo of
junior officer but the army should bo
trained to act effective in a mass. Pro
vision should be made by sufficient appro
priations for maneuvers of a practical
kind so that tho troops may learn how
to take core of themselves under actual
service conditions.
The number of posts In which the army
is kept in time of peace should be mate
rially diminished and the posts that are
left made correspondingly larger.
To accomplish this end we must havo not
company or regimental garrisons, but
brigade and division garrisons.
For a Big Nayy.
Our navy must, relatively to the navies
of other nations, always be of greater size
than our army. We have most wlselv con
tinued for a number of years to build up
our navy, and it has now reached a fairlv
high standard of efficiency. This stand*
ard of efficiency must not only be main
tained, but increased. It does not seem to
me necessary, however, that the navy
should—at least in the immediate future
be increased beyond the present number of
units. AVhat is now clearly necessary is to
substitute efficient for inefficient units as
the latter become worn ou't or as it be
comes apparent that they are useless.
Probably Hie result would be. attained by
adding a single battle ship to our navy
each year, the superseded or outworn ves
sels being laid up or broken up'ks they are
thus replaced.
Public Land Laws.
One again I call your attention to the
condition of the public land laws. Recent
developments havo given now urgency to
tho need for such changes as will fit these
laws to actual present conditions. The
honest disposal and right use of the re
maining public lands is of fundamental im
portance. The iniquitous methods by
which the monopolizing of the public lands
is being brought about under the present
laws are becoming more generally known,
but the existing laws do not furnish
effective remedies. The recommendations
of the public lands commission upon this
subject are wise and should be given
effect.
As to the Grazing Land Claim.
The greater part of the remaining public
lands cannot be irrigated. They are at
present and will probablv always be of
greater value for grazing than for any
other purpose. This fact has led to the
grazing homestead of (HO acres ill Ne
braska and to the proposed extension of it
to other stales. It is argued that a familv
can not be supported on 1(10 acres of arid
grazing land. This is obviously true but
neither can a family be supported on tMO
acres of much of the land to which it is
proposed to apply the grazing homestead.
To establish universally any such arbitrary
limit would lie unwise at the present time.
It wouki probably result on the one hand
in enlarging the holdings of some of the
great land owners, and on the other in
needless suffering and failure on the part
of a very considerable proportion of the
bona liile settlers who give faith to the im
plied assurance of the government that,
sueh an area is sufficient.
The best use of the public grazing lands
requires the careful examination andelass
ilieation of Ihese lands in order to give
each settler land enough to support his
family and no more. While this work is
being done, and until the lands are set
tled, Ihe government should take control
of the open range, under reasonable regu
lations suited to local needs, following the
general policy already in successful opera
tion on the forest reserves. It is probable
that the present grazing value of the open
public range is scarcely more than half
what it once was or what it migly: easily
be again under careful regulation.
Favors Merchant Marine.
To the spread of our trade in peace and
the defense of our tiag in war a great and
prosperous merchant marine is indispensi
bie. We should have ships of our own and
seamen oi our own lo convey our yoods to
neutral markets, and in ease of need to
reenlorce our battle line. It can not but
lie a source of regret and uneasiness to us
that the iines of communication with our
sister rcpub.ie.-, of South America should
be chief.y under foreign control, it is not
a good Lilian that American merchants
ami manuiacttirers shouid have to send
their coeds .mil letters to South America
via Kuroj.c if they wish security and dis
patch. Kven oil tin- raeilie, where our
ships have held their own better llian on
the Atla.nie, our merchant flag is now
threatened through the liberal aid be
stowed by Oilier governments on their own
steam liias. ask your earnest consider
ation of the report with which the Mer
chant .'uurihe commission has followed its
lony arid careful inquiry.
he l.nmigraiicn Question.
The question of immieratioi is of vital
interest to this country, in the veur end
in ,' June u, Iy.i0, there came to the fulled
Stales: i,e.„,(Jj() alien uninig ran s. In oilier
words, in the single year that has just
elapsed .iieie came to this country a
greatcv n,.niber of peop.e than came here
during the o.,e hundred and sixty-nine
years of our colonial life which "inu r
vened between tiie lirst landing al James
town and tin Declaration ot 1 ni. •pend
ence. It is (dearly shown in the report of
the commissioner- general of immigration
thai wii.,e much of thi.-i enormous immi
gration is uiaioubtilily t.eakhy and natur
al, a considerable proportion is undesirable
fiom one reason or ano:iier moi cover, a
consie., able proportion of it. prooabiy a
very- iaige i-ioportiou. iueluuing most of
tile linue.-aiabie ela.-.s, does not come her..
of its own initiative, bill because ed' ihe
activity of tne agenin of tin. great ti'e.ns
portat.O'i i'0.:.pa 1 Jes. Thi.-.c agents ale
oistrlbuM-d ihrou^iiout Km ope, and by the
oner of all kinms of inducements they
whe^edie and cajole many immigrants, ot ten
against tneir best interest, to conic iieie.
I lie Chincce Question.
The quesiiv/is arising in connection
with Ci-au-se liumigi atiun stand by them
selves. Tiie (.ondluoris in China are such
that till en tiie Chi/ie^e eooiie class, tnat
is, the class of Chinese laborers, skideil
and unsiLli.ed, legitimate.y come under
the head of undesirable immigrants to
this coun try, because of their numbers,
tiie low wages for which they work, ana
their iow s.uudard of living. Net only is
it to the intere.it of this country ti/'keep
them out, but the Chinese authorities do
not desire that chey should be admitted.
At present their entrance Is probihited
by laws amply adequate to accomplish
this purpose. These Jaws have been .,are
being, and will be, thoroughly enforced
The violations of them are so few in
number as to be Infin.Vesimal and can be
entirely disregarded. There Is no serious
proposal to alter the Immigration law
as regards the Chir.ese laborer, skilled or
unskilled, arid there }3 no excuse for any
man feeling or affnct'r.g to feel the
slightest alarm on the subject.
For Pure Food Law.
I recommend tibat a law be enacted to
regulate interstate commerce In misbnutd-
ed asti adulterated foods, drinks, and
drugs. Such law would protect legiti
mate manufacture and commerce, and
would tend to secure the health and' wel
fare of the consuming public. Traffic in
foodstuffs which have been debased or
adulterated so as to injury health or to de
ceive purchasers should be forbidden.
The Indian Question.
During the year just past, the phase of
the Indian question-which lias been most
sharply brought to public attention Is tho
arger legal significance of the Indian's
induction into citizenship. This has made
itself manifest not only In a great excess
of litigation in which the citizen Irama
figures as a party defendant and in a more
widespread disposition to levy local taxa
tion upon his personality, but in a decision
of (he United States supreme court which
struck away the main prop, on which has
hitherto rested the government's benevo
lent effort to protect him against the evils
of intemperance. The court holds, in ef
fect. that when an Indian becomes, by
virtue of an allotment of land to him, a
citizen ot the state in which his land is sit
uated, he passes from under federal con
trol in such matters as this, and the acts
of the congress prohibiting tllft sale or
gift to him of Intoxicants become substan
tially inoperative. It is gratifying to note
that the. states and municipalities of the
west which havo most at stake in the wel
fare of tho Indians aro taking up this sub
ject and are trying to supply, in a measure
at least, tho abdication of its trusteeship
forced upon the federal government.
Nevertheless, I would, urgently press
upon tho attention of tho congress the
question whether some amendment of the
Internal revenue laws might not be of aid
in prosecuting those malefactors, known
in the Indian country at "bootleggers,"
who aro engaged at once in defrauding the
United States treasury of taxes and, what
is far more important, in debnuching tho
Indians by carrying liquors illicitly into
territory still completely under federal
jurisdiction.
Among the crying present needs of tho
Indians are more day schools situated In
the midst of their settlements, more ef
fective instruction in the industries pur
sued on their own farms, and a more lib
eral extension of tho field-matron service,
which means tho education of the Indian
women in tho arts of home making.
The Philippines.
During the last year tho Philippine
Islands have been slowly recovering from
the series of disasters which, since Amer
ican occupation, havo greatly reduced the
amount of agricultural products below
what was produced in Spanish times. The
war, the rinderpest, tho locusts, the
drought, and tho cholera have been unit
ed as causes to prevent a return of the
prosperity much needed in the islands.
The most serious is tho destruction by
the rinderpest of more than 75 per cent,
of tho draft cattle, because it will take
several years of breeding to restoro the
necessary number of these indispensable
aids to agriculture.
Would Reduce Tariff.
Tho agricultural conditions of the
Islands enforce more strongly than ever
tho argument in favor of reducing the
tariff on tho products of the Philippine
islands entering the United States. I
earnestly recommend that the tariff now
Iriiposcd by the Dinglcy bill upon the
products of the Philippine islands be
entirely removed, except the tariff on
sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff
bo reduced to 25 per cent, of the present
rates under the Dingley act that after
July 1, lfl03, the tariff upon tobacco and
sugar produced In the Philippine islands
be entirely removed, and that free trade
between the islands and tho*Unlted States
In the products of each country then be
provided for by law.
A .statute in force, enacted April 15,
1904, suspends the operation of t.lie coast
wise laws of the United States upon the
trade between the Philippine islands and
the United States until July. 1, 1900. 1
earnestly recommend that this suspen
sion be postponed until July 1, 1909.
Would Fortify Hawaii.
In my judgment immediate steps should
bo taken for the fortification of Hawaii.
Ibis Is the most important point 111 the
Pacific to fortify in order to conserve
the interests of this country. It would
be hard to overstate the importance of
this need. Hawaii is too heavily taxed.
Laws should be enacted setting aside
for a period of, say, twenty years 75
per cent, of the internal revenue and
customs receipts from Hawaii as a spe
cial fund to be expended in the islands
lor educational and public buildings, and
for harbor Improvements and military
and naval defenses, it cannot bo too
oiten repeated that our aim must be to
develop the territory of Hawaii on tra
ditional American lines.
Citizenship for Porto Ricans.
I earnestly advocate the adoption of
legislation which will explicitly confer
American citizenship on all citizens of
Porto Iilco. There is, in my judifsnent,
no excuse for failure to do this. Tho
harbor of San Juan should be dredged
and Improved. The expenses of tho fed
eral court or Porto Kico should be met
from the federal tieasury, and not from
the Porto Itican treasury. The elections
in Povto Iiioo should taktt place overy
four years, nnd tho legislature should
meet in session every two years. The
present form of government In Porto
Rico, which provides for the appointment
by the president of the members of the
executive council or upper house of the
legislature, has proved satisfactorv and
has inspired confidence in property" own
ers and investors.' I do not «deem it ad
visable at the present lime to change
this form in any material feature. The
problems anil needs of the island are in
dustrial and commercial rather than po
litical.
Needs of Alaska.
1 earnestly ask that Alaska be given
an elective delegate. Some person should
be chosen who can speak with authority
of the needs of ihe territory. The gov
ernment should aid in tie 'construction
•"•f a railroad from the nlf of Alaska io
the Yukon river, In American territory.
In my lasl two messages I advocated
certain additional action
0
behalf of
Alaska. I shall not now repeat I hose
recommendations, but 1 shall lay all my
stress upon the one recommendation o*f
giving to Alaska some one authorized to
sp-ni: for it. I should prefer that the
delegate was made elective, hut if this
is not deemed wise then make him ap
pointive.
The Panama Canal.
The treaty between the United States
and the republic of Panama, under which
the construction of the Panama canal was
made possible, went into effect with its
ratiliealion by the United States senate on
February £2, 1"04. The canal properties of
the Fr-nich Canal company were trans
ferred to the United States on Anril 23
I'JI.'i, on payment of to that com
pany. On April 1, 19C0, the commission
was reorganized, and it now consists of
Theodore 1'. Shouts, chairman, Charles
Magoon, l-Vn.iamin M. llarrod. Rear-Ad
rnlral Moniecai T. Fndicatt. I-irig idi -.r Gen
eral l'eti C. Mains, and Colonel Oswald
11. Krnst. John i-\ Stevens was appointed
chief engineer on July 1 lasl. Active work
in canal construction, mainly, preparatory,
has been in progress for less than a year
and a half. During lhat period two points
about the canal have ceased to be open to
debate. First, the question of route the
canal will be built on the Isthmus of
Panama. Second, the question of feasibil
ity: there are no physical obstacles on this
route that American engineering skill will
not be able to overcome without serious
difficulty, or that will prevent the comple
tion of .tile canal wi'.hin a reasonable time
and at a reasonable cost. This is virtually
the unanimous testimony of the engineers
who have investigated the matter for the
government.
Must Build It Rapidly.
The American people Is pledged to the
peed lest possible construction of a canal
.•..equate to lnee the demands whichIthe
eori.nn ice of tk-e world will make upon
it. ana I appeal most earnestly lo the con
gress io aiu in the fulfillment of the
plcige. Jr.it.:.vii'.g progress has been
made during the past year and especially
during the past foi.r months.
What is needed now and without delay Is
an appropriation by ihe congi ess to meet
the current and accruing expenses of the
commission. The first appropriation of
S]U,0iXi.0Mj, out of the $135,000,000 authorized
by the Speoner act, was made three years
ago. It is nearly exhausted. There is
barely enough of It remaining to carry the
commission to the end of the year. Un- I
less the congress shall appropriate before
that time all work must cease. To arrest
progress for any length of time now, 'wben
matters are advancing so satisfactorily
would be deplorable.
