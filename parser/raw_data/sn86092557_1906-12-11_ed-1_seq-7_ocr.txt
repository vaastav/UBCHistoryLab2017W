An Appeal to the '.Entire Nation.
ITewark Advertiser. ?
The annual brief Of the President,
embodying his convictions of pilbllc f,
need, Is quite as much as appeal to u
the nation as to the nation's Congress.
As usual, this year It-covers a great
multiplicity of subjects. On many of Cl
these his views are only Iteration, a o
process often necessary in propagating e]
the truths of reform. Much of what ]c
lie says he has said before, so that (j,

Reaaon for Long Message. (lf
llrooklyn Eagle.
A man was once asked 'Wb.v he
wade a magazine article so long?" He
replied: "I had not time to make II
GI
idiort." The length of tite President's ^
message is due to the same fact. His
summer-at Oyster Ilay gave to him no
leisure, except such as came from a rl
I change of energy. During the long se
cession of Congress legislation and ap- j"1
pdintments engaged his mind. Afterward
be united the role of a national ou
providence, with the art of nursing
hepublicanism in the congressional
districts in snch a way as to aid that cc
9 I
party in gubernatorial contests. Their '
hi prepared for and made the trip to pr
Panama and back, which has Just been
Icuneluded. The message was manl- ml
festly composed amid these overt ac- 38
tivltles and bears evidence of prodlg- co
lous composition, without salutary con- '8
Idennation. The latter required time, pc
and the time for it did not exist. p*
