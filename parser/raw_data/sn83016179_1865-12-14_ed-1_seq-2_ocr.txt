President't Message concluded from first paqe-
The revenue system of the country ißa sub- )
ject of vital interest to its honor and prosperi- 1
ty, and should command the earnest conside- 1
ration of Congress. The Secretary of the !
Treasury will lay before you a full and de
tailed report of the receipts aud disbursements 1
oi ibo last fiscal year, of the first quarter of
the present fiscal year, of the probable receipts- i
and expenditures for the other three quarters
and the estimates for the year following the
30th of June, ISG6. 1 might content myself;
with a pefeyence to that report, in which you j
will find all the information required for your
deliberations arid dochsictn. Hut the para
mount importance of the subject so presses
itself on my own mind, that I cannot but lay
before you my views of the measures which
are required for the good character, and, I
might ulrnost say, for the existence of this
people. The life of a republic lies certainly
iu the energy, virtue, and intelligence of its
citizens; but it is equally true that a good
revenue system is the life of an organin d
government. I meet you at a time when the
nation has voluntarily burdened itself with a
debt unprecedented iu our annals. Vast as
is its amount, it fades away into nothing when
compared with the countless blcsoiug3 that
will be conferred it; on our country and upon
tnsn by the preservation of the nation's life.
Now, on the first occasion of tho meeting of
Caugress since the return of peace, it is of the
utmost importance to inaugurate a just policy
which shail at once be put in motion, aud
which shall commend itself to those who come
aferusforits continuance. Wo must aim
at nothing less than tho complete cfi'ncement
of the financial evils that necessarily followed
a state of civil war. We must cndcavar to
apply the earliest remedy to the deranged
state of tho currency, and not shrink from de
vising a policy which, without being oppres
sive to the people, shall immediately begin to
effect a reduction of the debt, and, if persisted
In, discharge it fully within a definitely fixed
nnmhor of years.
it is our first duty to prepare in earnest for
our recovery from the ever-increasing evils of
an irredeemable currency, without n sudden
revulsion, and yet without untimely pneras
tinstion. For that end we must, each in our
respective positions, prepare the way. 1 bold
it the duty of the Executive to insist upon
frugality in the expenditures; and a sparing
economy is itself a great national resource.
Of the "banks to which authority lias been
given to issue notes secured by bonds of the
United States, we may require tb" greatest
moderation and prudence, and the law must
be rigidlv enforced when its limits arcexceed
ed. We may, each one of us, counsel our
active and enterprising countrymen to be
constantly on their guard, to liquidate debts
Dearly as possible on a system of cash pay
ments or short credits, to hold themselves
prepared to return to the standard of gold and
silver. To aid our fellow-citizens in the pru
dent management of their monetary affairs, I
tho duty devolves on us to diminish by law
the amount of paper money now in circulation
Five years ago the bank-note circulation of
the conntry amounted to not much more than
two hundred millions; now the circulation,
bank and national, exceeds seven hundred
millions. The simple statement of the fact
recommends more strongly than any words of
mine could do the necessity of our restraining
this expansion The gradual reduction of
the currency is the only measure that can save
the business of tho country from disastrous
calamities; and this can be almost impercepti
bly accomplished by gradually funding the
national circulation in securities that may be
mado redeemable at the pleasure of the Gov
ernment
Our debt is doubly secure—first in the ac
tual wealth aud still greater undeveloped re
sources of the eouutry,; and next in the char
acter of our institutions. The most intelligent
observers amoog political economists have not
failed to remark that the public debt of a
country is safe in proportion as its people are
free, that the debt of a republic is the safest of
all. Our history confirms aud establishes the
theorv, and is, I firmly believe, destined to
give it a still more signal illustration. The
rcerct of this superiority springs not merely
from the fact that in a republic tho national
obligations are distributed more widely
through countless numbers in all classes of
society; it has its root in the character of our
laws. Here all men contribute to the public
burdens. During the war, under the impul
ses of patriotism, the mm of the great body
of the people, without regard io their own
comparative want of wealth, thronged to our
armies and filled our fleets of war, and held
themselves ready to offer their lives for the
public good. Now, in their turn, the pro
perty and income of the eouutry should bear
the ir just proportion of the burden of taxation,
while in our impost system, through means of
which increased vitality is incidentally impart
ed to all the industrial interests of the nation
the duties should he so adjusted as to fall most
heavily oo articles of luxury, leaving the
necessaries of life as free from taxation as tho
absolute wants of the Government, economi
cally administered, will justify. No favored
class should demand freedom from assessment
and the taxes should he so distributed as not
to fall unduly on the poor, but rather on the
accumulated wealth of the country. Wo
should look at the national debt just as it is—
not as a national blessing, but as a heavy
burden on tho industry of the country, to he
discharged without unnecessary delay.
It is estimated by tho Secretary of the
Treasury that the expenditures for the fiscal
year ending tho 30th of June, 18GG will ex
ceed tho receipts §112,134,947. It is grati
fying, however, to state that it is also esti
mated that the revenue for tho year ending
the 30th of June, 18G7, will exceed the ex
penditures in tho sum of §111,G82,815. This
amount, or so much as may be deemed suffi
cient for the purpose, may he applied to the
reduction of the public debt, which, on the
31st day of October, 1805; was $£2,740,854,-
750. Every reduction will diminish the to
tal amount of interest to be paid, and enlarge
the means of still further reductions, until the
whole shall be liquidated; and this, as will
be seen from the estimates of the Secretary of
the Treasury, may bo accomplished by annu
al payments even within a period not exceed
ing thirty years. I have faith that wo shall
do all this within a reasonable time; that, as
we have amazed the world by the suppression
of a"®ivil tfhV Wjiich was thought' rt bo be
yond'MtrofltrOT of any government; so we
shall equally show the S'npeKd'riiy of mir in
stitatloDs by the prompt and faithfdb discharge
of our. national obligations. . -

capabilities of the ommtry, and for information
respecting tho details of its management rcf

Commissioner. ' •
I have dwelt thus fully on out domestic
affairs because of their transcendent import
ance; Under any circumstances, our great
extent of territory and variety of climate, pro
ducing almost everything that is necessary
for the wants, and even the comforts of man",
make ha singularly independent of the vary- \
ingpoljcy of foreigb Powers, and protect nj

again* "nations wio'foel pdwe? and forget]
right." For myself, has been and it will 1
be my constant aim to promote peace and j
amity with all foreign nations and Powers,
and 1 have every reason to believe that they
all, .without exception, are animated by the
same disposition. Our relations with the
Emperor of China, so recent iu their .origin,
are most frieudly, Our commerce with hie
dominions is receiving uew developments; and
it is very pleasing to find that the Government
of that great empire manifests satisfaction with
our policy, and rcposcsjust confidence in the
fairness which marks our intercourse. The
unbroken harmony between the United States
and the Emperor of Russia is receiving a
new support from an enterprise designed to
carry telegraphic lines atxoss tho continent of I
Asia, through his dominions, and so to con- |
nect us with all Europe by a new channel of
of intercourse. Our commerc- with South ]
America is about to receive encouragement j
by a direct line of mail steamships to the |
rising Empire of Brazil. The distinguished
party of men of science who have recently
loft our country to make .ft scientific explora
tion of the natural history atnl rivers and
mountains ranges of that region have received
from the Emperor that generous welcome
which was to have been expected from his
constant friendship for the United States, and
his well-known zeal in promoting the ad
vancement of knowledge. A hope is enter
tained that our commerce with the rich and
and populous countries that border the Medi
terranean sea may be largely increased. Noth
ing will he wanting, on the part of tiiis Gov
ernment, to extend the protection of our flag
over the enterprise of our fellow citizeus. We
receive from the Powers in that region as
surances of good-will; and it is worthy of note
that a special envoy has brought us messages
of condolence on the death of our late Chief
Magistrate from the Bay of Tunis, whose rule
includes the old dominions of Carthage, on
the African coast.
Our domestic contest, now happily ended,
has left some traces in our relations with one
at least of the great maritime powers The
formal accordance of belligerent lights to the
insurgent State was unprecedented, and lias
not been justified by the issue But in the
systems of neutrality pursued by the Powers
which mado that concession, there was a
marked difference. The materials of war for
the insurgent States were furnished, in a
great measure, from the workshops of Great
Britain; and British ships, maimed by British
subjects, and prepared for receiving British
armaments, sailed from the ports of Great
Britain to make war on American commerce,
under the shelter of a commission from the
insurgent States These ships, having once
escaped from British ports, ever afterwards
entered then in every part of the world, to
refit, and sn to renew their depredations The
consequences of this conduct were most disas
trous to the States then in rebellion, increas
ing their desolation and misery hy the pro
longation of our contest. It had, moreover,
the effect, to a great extent, to drive the
American flag from the sea, aud to transfer
much of our shipping and our commerce to
the very Power whose subjects had created
the necessity fur such a change. These events
took place before I was called to tho adminis
tration of the Government. Tho sincere de
sire for peace by which 1 am animated led me
to approve the proposal, already made, to sub
mit the questions which had thus arisen be
tween the countries to arbitration. The ques
tions are of such moment that they must
have commanded tho attention of the Great
Powers, and are so interwoven with the peace
and interests of every one of them as to have
insured an impartial decision. 1 regret to
inform you that Great Britain declined the
arbitrament, but, on the other hand, invited
us to the formation of a joint commission to
settlo mutual claims betwecu the two coun
tries, from which those for the depredations
before mentioned should bo excluded. Tho
proposition iu that very unsatisfactory form
lias been dcelinod.
The U 'nited States did not present the sub
ject as an impeachment of the good faith oi a
Power which was professing the most friendly
disp ■>; itions. but as involving questions of
public law. of which the settlement is essen
tial to tiie peace of nations; and, though pecu
niary rcparration to their injured citizens
would have followed incidentally on a decis
ion against Great Britain, sucli compensation
was not their primary object. They had a
higher motive, and it was the interests of peace
and justice to establish important principles
of international law. The correspondence
will be placed before you. The ground on
which the British Minister rests his justifica
tion is substantially that the municipal law ot
a nation, and the ! a.stie interpretations of
that law, are the measure of its duly as a
neutral ; and i feci bound to declare my opin
ion, before you and before tho world, that that
justification cannot he sustained before tin
tribunal of nations At the same time Ido
not advise to any present attempt at redress br
acts of legislation. For the future, friendship
between the two countries must rest on the
basis of mutual justice.
From tho moment of the establishment of
our free Constitution, the civilized world has
been convulsed by revolutions in tlio interests
of democracy or of monarchy, hut through all
those revolutions the United Slates have wise
ly and firmly refused to become propagandists
of republicanism. It is the only government
suited to our condition; hut we have never
sought to impose it on others; and we have
consistently followed the advice of Washing
ton, to recommend it only by the careful pre
servation and prudent use of the blessing.—
During all the intervening period the policy
of European Powers and of the United States
Imp, on the whole, been harmouious. Twice
indeed, rumors of the invasion of some parts
of America, in the interests of monarchy, have
prevailed; twice my prcdesessors have had oc
casion to announce the views of this nation
in respect to such interference. Oa both oc
casions the remonstrance of the United Srates
was respected, from a deep conviction on the
part of European governments that the system
of noil interference and mutual abstinence
from probagandism was the true rule for tho
two hemispheres. Since those times we have
advanced in wealth ahd power; hut we retain
the same purpose to leave the nations of Ku
to cliooso tneir own dynasties and form their
own systems of government. This consistent
moderation may justly demand a correspon
ding moderation. We should regard it as a
great calamity to ourselves, to the cause of
goW govern me i it, and to-the pence of the
world, should any European Power challenge
•the Amorlenft people; as it were, to the de
fence of republicanism against foreign -inter
ference. We eaansl foresee ami nr9 unwil
ling to- consider what opportunities might
; present themselves', what combination* might
offer to protect ourselves against, designs in-
I imienl -te our form of government. The
! United States de.-iro to act ift tho future as
they have ever acted heretofore ; they never
! will be driven froifi that course but by the
I aggression of European Powers ; and rely ou
the wisdom and justice of those Powers to
respect the system of non-interference which
has so long been sanctioned by time, and
whii-h, by its good results, has approved it
self to both continents.
Tho correspondence between tho United
States sind France, in reference to questions
which have h'eeome subjects of discussion be
tween ; thr two Governments, will, ftt a proper
trnj*. be laid before Congress.
When, on' the organization of oar Govern - j
meat, under the Constitution, the President
of the United States delivered his inaugural
address to the two Houses of Congress, ho
said to them, and through thom to the coun
try and to mankind, that "the preservation '
of the faered fire of liberty and the destiny of
the republican model of Government arejustly '
considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked
on the experiment entrusted to the American
people." And the house of Representatives
answered Washington bv the voice of Madison:
" We adore the Invisible Hand which lias led
the American people, through so many diffi
culties, to cherish a conscious responsibility
for the destiny of Republican liberty." More
than seventy-six years have glided away since
these words were spoken ; the United States
have passed through severer trials than were
foreseen; and now, at this new epoch in our
existrnce as one nation, with our Union pu
rified by sorrows, and strengthened by con
flirt, and established by the virtue of the peo
ple, greatnes of the occasion invites us once
more to repeat, with solemnity, the pledges
of our fathers to hold ourselves answerable)
before our fellow men for the success of the !
republican form of Government Experience
has proved its sufficiency in pcaee and in war; |
it has vindicated its authority through dan-1
govs, and afflictions, aud sudden and terrible
emergencies, which would have crushed any
system that had been less firmly fixed in the
heart of the people. At tho inauguration of
Washington the foreign relations of the coun
try were few, and its trade was repressed by
hostile regulations: now all the civilized na
tions of the globe welcome our commerce, and
their governments profess towards us amity.
Then our country felt its way hesitatingly
along an untried path, with States so little
bound together by rapid means of communi
cation as to be hardly known to one another,
and with historic traditions extending over
very few years; now intercourse between the
States is swift and intimate ; the experience
of centuries lias been crowded into a few gen
erations, and has created an intense, inde
structible nationality. Then our jurisdiction
did not reach beyond the inconvenient boun
daries of the territory which had achieved in
dependence ; now, through cessions of land,
first colonized liy Spain and France, the
country lias acquired a more complex charac
ter, and has for its natural limits the chain
of Lakes, the Gulf of Mexico, and on the east
and the west the two great, oceans. Other
j nations were wasted by civil wars for ages
before tliey could establish for themselves the
necessary degree of unity; the latent eonvic
i lion that our form of Government is the best
over known to the world lias enabled us to
emerge from civil war within four years,
with a complete vindication of the constitu
tional authority of the General Government,
and with our local liberties and State institu
tions unimpaired. The throngs of emigrants
that crowd to our shores are witnesses of tlur,
confidence of all peoples in our permanence.
Hero is the great land of free labor, where
industry is blessed with unexampled rewards,
and the bread of the workingniau is sweetened
by the consciousness that the cause of the
conntry " is his own cause, his own safety,
his own dignity." Hero every one enjoys
the free use of his faculties and tho choice of
activity as a natural right. Here, under the
combined influence of a fruitful soil, genial
climes, and huppy institutions, population has!
increased fifteen-fold within a century. Here, i
through tho easy development of boundless
resources, wealth has increased with two-fold ■
greater rapidity than numbers, so that we
have become secure against the Gnnneiul vi-,
cissitudes of other countries, and, nliko in
business and in opinion, are self-centered and
truly independent. Here more and more care
is given to provide education for every one
born on our soil. Hero religion, released
from political connection with the civil gov
ernment, refuses to subserve tho eraft of
statesmen, and becomes, in its independence,
the spiritual life of the people. Here tolera
tion is extended to every opinion, in the quiet
certainty that truth needs only a fair field to
secure the victory Here the human mind
goes forth unshackled iti the pursuit of science,
' to collect, stores of knowledge and acquire an
ever-increasing mastery over the forces of
nature Here the national domain is offered
and held in millions of separate freeholds, so
that our fellow-citizens, beyound tho occu
pants of any other part of the earth, consti
tute in reality a people. Ilero exists the
democratic form of government ; and that form
of Government, by the confession of European
statesmen, " gives a power of which no other
form is capable, because it incorporates every
man with the State, and arouses everything
that belongs to the soul."
Where, in past history, dors a parallel ex
ist to the public happiness which is within
tlie reach of the people of the United States?
Where, in any part of the gl ■he. can institu
(ions he found so suited to their habits or so
entitled to their love as their own free Con
stitution? Every one of thorn, then, in what
ever part of the land lie has his homo, must
wish its perpetuity. Who of them will not
now nrliti iwledgc, in the words of Washing
ton, that '• every step by which the people of
the United States have advanced to the char
acter of an independent nation seems to have
horn distinguished hv some token of Provi
dential agency ?" Who niil not join with me
in the prayer, that the Invisible Hand which
has led us through the clouds that gloomed
around our path will so guide us onward to a
perfect restoration of fraternal affection, that
wo of this day may be able to transmit our
groat inheritance, of State governments in all
their .lights, of the Genera! Government in
its whole constitutional vigor, to our posterity,
and thoy to theirs through countless genera
tions ?

Whereas It is an indisputable fact that the
soldiers from the loyal States who participa

upon a (inner foundation the Constitution of
the United States and the uuiou of the States
hereunder ; and
Wltcrnit, It is eminently proper that the
gallant tit els and sufferings experienced in
their line of duty should he properly appreci
ated by their fellow countrymen in this gen
eration and posterity hereafter ; and
Whereat, The sons of the old Maryland
Lino of yore have exhibited in the late civil
war—marshalled under the National stand
ard—-the indomitable spirit of their ancestry,
which fully ecpialed the spirit evinced bv any
troops of our National army in said war, and
determined to bo as far in the van now ns

previous period ; therefore, bo it
Readied, That we will co-operate most
earnestly with all other Legions throughout

the same amount of the Government bounty
paid,to the soldiers in 18C3 and 1804, and
believe it tubs the sacred duty of the General
Government to do those brave veterans this
act of simple justice.
Resolved, That we will eo-opcrate with our
late comrades in arms in other States for the
purpose of memorializing the next Congress
to appropriate and set apart for the soldiers
who participated in an honorable degree in
the late civil war, a fair rjuota of the public
lands, the property of the General Govern
ment, and more especially to provide some
manifest inducement to actual settlers of the
class of mcu as aforesaid.
Resulted, That we helicvo it to bo the duty
of the next General Assembly of Maryland",
to appropriate the Fame local bounty to all
the honorably discharged soldiers who served
thus honorably in the late civil war, that was
so gcuerously bestowed upon a number of the
same.

p'es of a Free and Representative Govern
ment, uud the maintenance of the Federal
Union iu contradistinction to all other poiiti- j
cal dogmas.
Rusietd, That by our speedy and complete

land. who participated in an honoiahle capa
city in the recent civil war, do gladly receive
the recommendation of the late comrades in
arms from other States, to organize a national
order for the reasons aforesaid, and we do
hereby accept the soldiers' pledge as the foun
dation of said order.
Resolved That it is the duty of the returned
soldiers of the class as aforesaid in the several
