Prof .Henry Wade Rogers. Dean of the
law department of Yah; University pre
sented as chairman the report of the com
mittee on international Relations of the
Federal council, 'n substance as follows:
International law had its origin in
Christian states and has only within re
cent years been extended to non-Christian
ounties. A hopeful and inspiring move
ment has now been begun in many parts
if the world which will result in interna
tional law being administered by nn in
ternational court, when nations no more
than individuals will be permitted to set
tle their disputes by courts. When that
day conies international law will be more
in harmony with the spirit of Christianity.
The time has come when the Christian
churches should pronounce anathema up
on the heresy of war. The one substitute
for war is arbitration. Reviewing the de
velopment of the sentiment for arbitra
tion in the first land second Hague con
ferences and the ultimate decision that a
court of arbitral justice should be estab
lished, the conclusion is reached that the
friends of peace must make increased ef
forts to create a public sentiment through
out the world for a limitation of arma
ment. The moral point has already been
conceded by 'many statesmen .and the
churcnes should take it for granted. They
cannot be indifferent to the material point
in the question. The vast expenditures
for armaments constitute n gigantic evil.
The practical question is, what can the
churches do to aid the movement for the
abolition of war! 1 nations it Is not unlikely that considerable

Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 0 "I am not
going to die. I am going to get well and
live to kill a few more policemen."
That is the assertion of Louis Pratt, the
self-styled "Adam Cod," the religious fa
natic who is lying in the general hospital
hen seriously wounded in a battle be
tween bis followers and the police late
yesterday. As a result of the fight Pratt's
thirteen-year-old daughter, Lulu, and
policeman Albert O. Dalbow are dead and
two other policemen are in a dying condi
tion.
James Sharp, known as "Flijuh the
Second," and who was the real head of
the little band of religious enthusiasts, is
still at large. Shortly after the shooting
yesterday he walked into a saloon and
laid down his revolver, with the remark,
"I'm satisfied; I give up." As there were
no jit'ice present and no one seemed m
clined to take him into custody Sharp
waited a moment, then picking up his
weapon, re-haded it and walked out. He
has not been seen since.
At the hospital this morning it was said
Patrolman Michael Mullane had small
chance of recovery, but that Sergeant
Patrick Clark's condition was slightly im
proved. A. J. Selson, a bystander who
was hit by a stray bullet, also is exacted
to get well.
In the very shadow of the city hall in
this city and less than half a mile from
the business section, a tiot in which relig
ious fanatics and the police were partici
pants, and in which over a hundred shots
were fired late yesterday afternoon, re
sulted In the death of one policeman, the
fatal injury to the second and slight In
juries to two other persons.
K-hools should celebrate the 18th of May
as Peace Dav. The committee recom
mends: I
1 The Federal council declare its
conviction that war is evil, and Christian
nations should resort to arbitration in
ease of international difficulties. '
2 That it favors the creation of the
international court of arbitral justice. (
3 " mt it is opposed to increase of j
armaments.
t. That it learns to its satisfaction of
the negotiation of treaties of arbitration ,
between the United States and some na- j
tions, hopes that other treaties may be
negotiated and that their existence be no
longer limited to five years.
The committe also recommends the
adoption of a resolution commending to
all the churches the observance of the
Sunday before Christmas as Peace Sun
day, nrfd a resolution recommending that
the various Young Peoples' Societies rec
ognize May 18 as Hague Day. and in nil
their chapters on that day consider the
subject of peace.

MAYOR PARKS VETOES BOND
ISSUE ORDINANCE
ORDINANCE HaIbEEN SIGNED
Ordinance for Refunding City's In
debtedness Passed Veto Message
of the Mayor ? uditorium.
The city council met in special session
Monday afternoon at five o'clock and
held tt rather animated session.
Mayor Parks presented n veto of the
ordinance passed last week providing for
the purchase of the Auditorium but the
veto was not accompanied by the ordi
nance as he had approved the ordinance
by signing it when it was first paused.
The mayor was in the predicament of ap
proving and vetoing the same measure,
and like the man who said the horse was
seventeen feet high attempted to stick to
it.
The ordinance providirg for refunding
the indebtedness of the city to the amount
of ubout $10,000 w as passed nnd the
proper steps w ill be taken to issue the re
funding (Minds at once.
The rather remarkable veto message
follows:
i)( ci -mbcr 7. 1908
City of Vinita, City Hall
To the City Council,
City of Vinita, Oklahoma,
Gentlemen:
I herewith, return ordinance No.
177 entitled "An ordinance declared
necessary and expressing the deter
mination of the City Council of the City
of Vinita Oklahoma to purchase the Vi
nita Auditorium building together with
n tract of land 150 feet deep on the
north side of Illinois avenue nnd ex
tending from the wot line of Vann
street to the east lin- ef Wilson street
in the city of Vinita Oklahoma and
authorizing and directing the mayor of
the city of Vinita to call nn election
for the same ." without my signature
and with my veto fo the following rea
sons to-wit:
1
That It is my opinion that the City of
Vinita would acquire no title to the lands
described in the quit claim deed for the
reason that the railroad has no title hi the
land other than an earncnt for railroad
purposes only.
II
By the terms of the ftrunt under which
the railroad Is using these lands a proviso
is made whereby such lands revert to the
Cherokee Nation when the railtond ceases
to use them for railroad purposes or aban
dons them.
m
It is my opinion that if a deal of this
character should be consummated nnd
the St. I-ouis and San Francisco Railway
should surrender its right of occupancy to
these lands the City of Vinita would be
come involved in a series of litigation in
which ihe Cherokee nation would seek to
j eject the City of Vinita from these lands
nnd in sutii litigation the City of Vimtn
kes chances on losing the entire tract
1 of land together vith nil improvement
' that ate now on the hind or might be
placed thereon in the interim for the rea
son that the fee to this laud is in the
Cherokee Nation and not in the St. Louis
