la ill their varied and complicated forms. His t
groat success iu those long standing and dilli- j
au.teases, such as were formerly considered in- j
curable, is nuflJcioitt to commend hiiu to the pub
-110 as worthy of tl'.o extensive patronugo whiob
ho has received. Within the lust eight years,
r. S. has trailed more than 2tf,600 cases of
Private Complaiuts in their different forma and
stages ; a practice which no doubt exceeds that
of all the physicians now advertising in Balti
more, and not a .single case Is known, where di
rections were strictly followed, and medictue tn- '
ken at reasonable time, without effecting p, rad
lonl and permanent cure; therefore, persons nf-
Hwtod with dUoases of the above nature, "no
/natter how dithcult or long standing the case
ar be, would do well lo call on I>r. SMITH,

President's Message, ;
t
Fellotc-Cilizens of the Senate (
and Ifmtsc of Jtepreunlatives. t
Since jour last nnniaa! assembling an- 1
other year of health and bountiful liar- i
vests have passed. And while it has i
not pleased the Almighty lb bless us t
with a return of peace, wo can but press t
on, guided by the best light He gives t
us trusting that in His own good time, 1
and wise way, all will yet bo well I
The correspondence touching foreign <
affairs which lias taken place during tbe J <
last year is herewith submitted, iu vir- 1
tual compliance with a request to that : i
efl'ect, made by the House of Represen- | 1
tatii'es nenr the close of t.ho last session ] I
of Congress. _ .
If the condition of our relations with j <
other nations is less gratifying than it i i
has usually been at former periods, it is ! i
certainly more satisfactory than a nation ; i
so unhappily distracted as we are, might J t
rcsonably have apprehended. In the t
monlli of June last, there were some j 1
grounds to expect that the maratime j i
powers which at the beginning of our I i
domestic difficuties, so unwisely and j i
unnecessarily, we think, recognized the . <
insurgents as a beligerent, would soon | I
recede from that position, which has j I
proved only less injurious to themselves,
than to our country. 15ut the tcmpora- |
ry reverses, which afterwards befell the ;
national arms, and which were e.-agera- j i
ted by our own disloyal citizens abroad, ! j
have hitherto delayed that act of simple ] i
justice.
The civil War, which has so radically j i
changed, for tho moment, the occupa- j
lions and habits of the American peo- :
pie, has necessarily disturbed tho sricufl I
condition, and effected very deoply the
prosperity of ihc tiatious with which we |
have carried on a commerce Slial has j
been steadily increasing throughout a , i
period of half u csutury. It has, nt 1
the saute time, excited political ambi
tions and apprehensions which havo pro- j <
dueed a prolnund agitation throughout j 1
the civilized world. In this unusual j i
agitation we have forborne from taking l
part in arty controversy between foreign |
states, and between parties or factions
iu such slates. We have attempted no ,
propagandist)!, and acknowledged no
revolution. But we have left to every ;
nation the exclusive conduct end utan-|
ngcinvnt of its own affairs Our strng- j
gl* has beeu of course, cdliteir plated by '
foreign nations with refereuro less to its
own merits, than to its supposed, and of- (
tut exaggerated effects and consrquqtJces
lot-tilting to those nations themselves. I
Nevertheless, complaint on tlieparl of this
government, even if i! wercjusf, would _
certainly be Unwi.to.
'I he treaty with Hrsat Britain for the
sup] rcsston of the flavo trade has been
put into operation with a gocl prospsct !
of coniplcte'success. It Is an occasion of |
spoeia 1 pleasure to acknowledge that the
execution of it, on the part of her Maj- :
esty's (joveriinient, has I'uen marked \
with a jealous respect for tho authority
of tho United Stales, au l rights of their t
moral and loyal citizens.
The convention with Ilanovur for the
I abolition of the stadt duos Las hsen car- j
ried iuto full effect, under tho not of
Congtcss for that purpoo.
A blockade of three thousand miles of
1 sea-coast could not bo established, and j
I vigorously enforeeJ, in u season of great :
| commercial activity like the present, j
without committing occasional mistakes,
and inflicting unintentional injuries up
on foreign nations and their subjects.
A civil war oci urring in a country j
where forolghcrs reside aud carty on !
trsJe under treaty stipulations, is neces
sarily fruitful cf complaints of tho vio- j
latiou of neutral rights All suck col
lisions tend to excite misapprehensions,
and possibly to produce mutual rcclama- j
lions betwecu nations which have tieotn- j
mon interest in preserving peace and
friendship. In clear cases of these kinds,
I have so far as possible, heard and re- '
dressed complaints which havo been pre
sented by friendly powers. There is
still however, a largo and an augment- j
ittg number of doubtful cases upon |
which the Government is unablo to agroo i
with the Governments whoso protection |
is demanded hy the claimants. There ;
are, moreover, many cases in which the
United States, or their citizens, suffer
wrongs front the naval or military an- |
thoritiss of foreign nations, which the
Goverptnent of those States are not at j
once prepared to redress, I have pro- |
posed to some of tho foreign States thus j
interested mutual conventions to exam- i
inc and adjust such coniplnints. This |
proposition has beeu made especially to
Great Britain, to Franco, to Spain, to'
Prussia. In each case it has been I
kindly received, but has not been for
mally adopted.
I deem it my dpty to recommend an
uppt opriation iu behalf of tho owners of i
the Norwegiau bark Admiral P Tordens- j
I kiold, which vessel was, in May, 1861,
: prevented by the commander of the block- '
, adiag force off Charleston from leaving
: that port with cargo, notwithstanding a i
i similar privilege had, shortly before, !
I been granted to ari English vessel. I '
have directed the Secretary to cause tho
papers in tho case to he communicated
to the proper committees.
Applications have been made to nic by .
many free Americans of African descent j
. to favor their emigration, with a view to .
such colonization as was contemplated ,
in recent acts of Congress. Other par- \
ties, at home and abroad—some from
interested motives, others upon patriotic
considerations, and still olhers influen
ced by philanthropic sentiments—hate :
suggested similar measure*; while, cn i
' tbe other hand, several of tjie Spanish I
American republics have protested a
gaioat the sending of such colonies to
their respective territories. Uridor those
circumstances, I have declined to move
any such colony to coy state, without
first obtaining the consent of its govern
ment, with an agreement on its part to
receive and protect such emigrants in all
the rights of freemen; and I hsVb, at
the same time, offered to the several
states situated within tile tropics, or
having Colonies there, to negotiato with
the pi Subject to the advice and consent
of the Heuatc, to favour the voluntary
•migration of persons of that class to
their respective territories, upon con
ditions which shall be equal, just, and
humane. Liberia and Ilayti lire as yet
the only couutries to which Colonists of
African desuout from byre, could go with
certainty of being received and adopted
as citizens; and I regret to say such per
sons, contemplating colonization, do riot
seem willing to migrate to those coun
tries, as ti some others, nor so willing
as I think their interest demands. I
believo, however, opioion among them,
ic this respect, is improving; and that,
ere long there will be an augmented,
and considerable migration to both these
countries, from the United States. The
new commercial treaty betwoen the Uni
ted States and the Sultan of Turkey has
been carried into execution.
A commercial and consular treaty has
been negotiated, subjeot to the Senates
conseut, with Liberia; and a similar ne
gotiation is now pending with the re
public of Haytl. A Considerable im
provement of the national commerce is
expected to result from these moasures
Our relations with Great Britain,
FrsfJcc, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prus
sai. Ueumark, Swedcu, and Austria, the
Netherlands, Italy, Rome,'and otiier Eu
ropean states, remain undisturbed. ~
t'ery favorable relations also continue
to bs maintained with Turkey, Morocco,
China, and Japan.
Birring the Inst year there has not
only hem no change of oar previous re
lations with tko independent States of
our own continent, but more friendly ,
sentiments than have heretofore existed, I
are believed to be entertained these I
ueighbors, whose safatv and progress, are j
so intimately connected with our own. j
This statement especially npplias to ;
Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa llica, Hondu- I
ras, Peru, and Chilli.
1 he commission uudcr the convention
with ilie republic of New Grenada clos
ed its session, without having audited
and passed upon, all the claims which
were nsbmittcd to it. A proposition
is'pending to revivd the convention,
that it may be able to do rnoro complete
justice. The joint commission between
the United States and the republic of
Costa llicit litis completed its labors and
submitted its rep ort.
I have favored t' e project of connect
ing the United States with Europe by
an Atlantic Ulograpli, find a similar
project to extend the telegraph from
San Frunsiico, to connect by a Pacific
telegraph with tho line which is being ex
i ten led across the Russian Empire.
The Territories of the United States,
i With uniuipcttatit exceptions, hate re-.
! mained undisturbed by the civil war: ar.d
they are exhibiting such evidence of pros
perity as justifies an expectation that
some of tlicui will soon be in a condition
: to be ci'gHiiiSed as States, and be con
! stitutioualiy admitted into the Federal
: Union.
'I lie immense mineral reseriiircos of
some of those Territories edght to bo
i developed as rapidly as possiblo. Every
i step iu that direction would have a ten
dency to improve the revenues of the
i Govern : cut, and di>r inieh tho burdens
jof the people. It is worthy of your se
i rious consideration whether some extra
ordinary measure to promote that end
I cannot bo ndoptcd. The means which
suggest itself as most likely to be ef
fective, is a scientific exploration of tho
; mineral regions iu those Territories,
' with a view to the publication of its re
sults at homo and in foreign couutries—
results which cannot fail to be iuspi
| cious.
j Tho condition of the Snail l es will claim
your most diligent consideration Tho
I vast expenditures incident to the milita
ry aud naval operations required for th*
; suppression of tho rebellion, have hith
erto been met with a prorotitude, and
j certainty, unusual in simitar circumstan
ces; and the public credit has been fully
maintained. The continuance of the
i war, however, and tho increased dis
| bursements made necessary by the aug
j mented forces now in tho field, demand
I your bast reflections as to tho bast
modes of providing tho necessary reve
nue, without injury to business, aud
; with the legst possible burdens upon la-
I bor.
I The suspension of specie payments by
the banks, soon after the commencement
|of yoqr last session, made large issues
iof United States notes unavoidable. In
, no other way eoiild Repayment of the
I troops and the satisfaction of other just
demand?, be so economically, or so well
gfovided. The judicious !Sjgislati|j} of
ongress, securing the of
these notes for loans and iittefnaf duties,
and melting them a legal tender for oth
er debts, has made them a universal
currency; and has satisfied, partially, at
least, and for tho timo, tho long felt
want of an uniform circulating medium
, saving thereby to the people, immense
, sums in discounts and exchange*.
A return to specie payments, howev
er, at the earliest period compatible with
, due regard to all interests concerned,
should ever be kept in view. Fluctua
j tions in the vaitie of currency are al
j ways injurious, and to reduce these flue
i tuatious to the lowost possible point will
always be a loading purpose in wise le
gislation. Convertibility, prompt And
certain convertibility, into coin, is gen
erally acknowledged to be the best and
surest safeguard against them; and it is
extrcmemely doubtful whether a circu
lation of United States notes, payable
in a coin, aud sufficiently large for the
wants of tho people, can be permanently,
usefully and safely maintained.
Is there, then, any other mode in
which the necessary provision* for tho
public wants can be made, and the great
advantages of a safe ofld uniform cur
rency securod?
I know of none which promises so
certain results, and is, at the same time
so unobjectionable, as tbo organization
of banking associations, under a gene
ral act of Congress, well guarded iu Us
provisions: To such nssocioations the
Government might furnish circulating
notes, on the security of the United
States bonds deposited in the treasury.
These notes, prepared under tho super
vision of proper officers, being uniform
iu appcaranca art 1 security, and conver
tible always Into coin, would at ohco
protect labor against the evils of a vic
ious currency, aud faciliate commeroc by
cheap and safe exchanges*
A moderate reservation from tho in
terest on the bouds would compensate
the United States for tho preparation nud
distribution of the notes, and general su
pervision of the systoni, and would light
en the burden of that part of the public
debt employed as securities. The pub
lic credit, moreover, would be greatly
improved, and the negotiation of new
loans greatly facilitated by tho steady
market demand for tho Governmant
bonds which the adoption of the propo
sed system would create.
It is an additional recommendation of
the ttfeasure, of considerable weight, in
my judgement, that it wotild reconcile,
as far as possible, till existing institu
tions to re-organize under the act, substi
tuting only the secured uuiform national
circulation for tho looal and various cir
culation, secured aud uusocurcd, now
issued hy them.
Tbo receips into the Treasury from all sour
ces, including loans, and balance from prece
ding year,for tho fiscal year ending on 30th
Jutie, "tgCJ, were $553,'835,247.06, of which

Other information on the subject of
the finaces will be fctind iri tho report of

! statements and views I invite Todr uiost
j candid and considerate attention.
Tho reports of the ,Secretarios of War,
and of the Navy, aro herewith transmit
ted. These reports, though longthy,
are scareely more than brief extracts of
the vory numerous and so extensive
transactions aud operations conducted
through those cjepartm ints. Nor could
I giyo a sumnury of l otn hore, upon
■fty principal, which would admit of its
being much shorter than the roports
themselves. I therefore content myself
with laying the report* bofcre you, and
asking your attention to them.
It gltes nic pleasure to report a deci
ded improvement in t?JQ financial condi
tion of the Post Offico Department, as
compared with tho scrcial preceding
vonrs. The receipts for the fiscal year
1861 amounted to $8,349,"90,40, which
emhracod the reveuue from all the States
of the Union for three quarters cf that
yor'r. Notwithstanding the eassasiofl of
revenue from the do called soc'ed States
during the last fiscal year, tho inoreaso
of the correspondence of the loyal States
has been sufficient to produco a revenue
during tho same year of §8,290,820, 90
being only §OO,OOO less than was de
rived from all the States of the Union
during the previous yuar. The expen
ditures show n still uiore favorable re :
suit. Tho amount expended in 1 S(sl
was sl3, 605, 759,11. For the last
year the amount h&apbocn reduced to
§11,125 ,365 13, showing a decreaso cf
about §2,481,000 in the expenditures
as compared with tho fiscal year 1860.
The deficiency in the department for the
previous year was §4,551,966,98. I'or
the last fiscal year it was reduced to §2,-
112,814,57.
These favorable results are in part
owing to the cessation of mail service in
the insurrectionary States, and in part
to a careful review of expondituaes in
that department, in the interest cf econ
omy. The efficiency of the postal ser
vice, it is believed, has also been much
improvod. 'J'be Postmaster Oeueral has
opened a correspondence, through the
Department of State, with foreign gov
ernments, prosing a convention of pos
tal representatives for the purposo of
simplifying the rates of foreign postage,
and to expedite tho foreign mails. This
; proposition, equally important to our a
i doptef citizens, and to the commercial
| interests of this country, has been fa
vorably entertained, anil agreed to by
, all the governments from whom replies >
' hate been rooeived.
I ask tlio attention of Congress to the
suggestions of tlio Postmaster General ,
in bis report respecting the further leg- <
tslation required, in bis opinion, for the
benefit of the postal service.
The Secretary of the Intorior reports
as follows in regard to the public lands: j
"The public lands hare ceased to be a ,
source of public revenue. From the Ist ,
July, 1861, to the 30th September, 1862, 1 i
the entire oash receipts from the sale of ]
lands were §137,476 26—a sum much 11
lass that) the expenses of our land sys- 1
tem durifig the same period; The home- I
stead law, which will take effect on the
Ist of January next, offers such in- ,
duccraents to settlers, that sales for cash .
cannot bo expected, to an extent sufii- ; <
cient to meet tlio expenses of the oost of, I
surveying and bringing the land into I '
the market."
The discrepancy between the sum hero '
stated an arising from the sales of the . '
public lands, and the sum derived from
same source as reported from theTroosury ,
Department arises, as I understand,
from the fact that the periods of time,
though apparently, wore not really, co
incident at the beginning point —the |
Treasury report including a considerable j
sum how, which had previously boen re- .
ported from tlio Intorior—sufficiently ;
large to greatly overreach the sunt de- (
rived from the threo months now repor
ted upon by the Interior, and not by the :
Treasury.
The Indian tribes upon our frontiers i ;
have during the past year, manifested a
spirit of insubordination, and at several j,
points, have engaged in hostilities a- |,
gainst the white settlements in their vi- j
eiuity. The tribes occupying the Indian ji
country south of Kansas, renounced . 1
t'i eir allegiance to the Uuited States J
aau entered iuto treaties With the iusur- j j
gents. Those who remained loyal to ,
tho United States were driven from the >
country. Tho chief of tho (Jberokees ; (
lias visited this city for tho purpose of j i
restoring the fornior relations of that 1
tribo with the United States. He alleg- .
es that they wore constrained by supe
rior force, to enter into treaties with the 1
insurgents, and that the United States
neglected to furnish the protection which ,
their treaty stipulations required.
In the month of August last the Bionr In- i
(lians, in Minnesoto, attacked the settlements
ih tlmif vicinity with extreme ferocity,killing, j
indiscriminately, mOB, women *nd children.
TMs attack was wholly unexpected, and, there
fore, no means Jot defence had been provided. I
It is estimated ;thn'. not less ibta eight hnn- !
died persons wero killed by the Indians, and a j
large amount of property was destroyed.:
How this outbreak was induced is not defini
tely known, and suspicious, which may be un
just, need not bs stated. Information was re
ceived by tht Indian bureau, from different
sources' about the time hostilities were com
menced, that a simultaneous attack was to bo
made upon the white settlement by all the i
tiihss' between (tba Mississippi river and thai
/focky mountains. The State of Minnesota
has suffered great injury from this Indian
war.
A large portion of her territory has been de. |
populated, and a severe loss hssjbren sustained j
by the destruction of property. The people of
that Stale manifest much anxiety for the re- ,
moral of tha tribes beyond the limits of tbs
State as a guarantee agaiust future hostilities. '
The Commissioner of Indian -dffuirs will furn- :
nish full details. I submit for your especial |
consideration whether our Indians sistem j
shall not he remodelled. Many wise ami good I
men have impressed me with the belief that |
this can he profitably cone.
I submit a statement of the proceedings]of |
tlio commissioners, which shows tho prgress j
that has been made in the enterprise of con
structing tlio l'acilic Railroad. And this sag- j
gesks the eurliust completion of this road, and |
alsn'thc favorable action of Congress upon the
projects now pending befure them forenlarg- [
ins the capacities of tho groat canals In
Now York and Illinois, as beiug of vital and
rapidly increasing importance to the whole
natic'n, and especially to tho vast interior re
gion hereinafter to be noticed at sorno great I
length. I purpose having prepared and ]
laid before you at an eatly day some inter- I
eating and statistical information on the sub- ;
j. ft. The military and commercial impor- '
taneo of enlarging tho Illinois and Michigan j
canal, and improving the Illinois river, is
presented in the report of Colonel Webster j
: to the Secretary of War, and now transmit- j
ted to Congress. I respectfuly ask attention '
to it. (
To carry >ut the provisions of tho act of j
Congress of the 15th of May last, I have 1
caused the Department of Agriculture of the j
United States to be organized,
j Tha Cemmissioaer informs me that wjthin 1
1 the period of a low month (his department j
| baa established an extensive system of cor- |
! respondence and exchanges, both at home p
and abroad, which promises to effect highly
beneficial results in the development of a
correct knowledge of recent improvements
in agriculture, in tho introduction of new
products, and in the collection of the agri- ,
cultural statistics of the different States. i
Also tlict it will soon he prepared to dis- '
tribute largely seed, cereals, plants snd cut
tings. and ha* air ady published, and liber
ally diffused much valuable information in
anticipation of a more chiborato report,
which will in dua time ho furnished,
bracing some valuable tests in chemical
euro now in progress jn tha laboratory.
'J lie creation of this department was for
the more immediate benefit of a large chisel,
of our most valuable citizens; and I trust that
thu liberal basis upon which it has been or
ganized will not of'ty meet your sppeybiw— ~
tion, but that it will realize, at no disuSfC
day, all the fondest anticipations of its most !
sanguine friends, ur.d become the fruitful
source of advantage to sll our people.
On tha 22d day of September lai.t a proc- :
lamation was issued by the Kxocuti •, a cop
pv of which is hereby submit tod.
In accordance with the purpose expressed
in tha secqtid paragraph of that paper, I
now respect fully recall your attention to
what may be called "compensated emanci
pation."
A nation may he said to cotisiM of its ter
ritory, its peopls, and its law/. The territo- t
ry is the uuly part which is yf certain dura- !
bility.
"One generation passotb away, and anally- ,
er gsueration cor.ieth, but the earth abidoth j
forever." It is of the first importance to du-
NUMBER 50-
ly consider, ami estimate, this ever enduring
part. That portion or the earth's surface
which is owned And inhabited oy the people
of the United States, is well adapted to be
the home of one national family; and it is
not Well adapted for two or more. Its east
extent, and its variety of climate and pro
ductions, are of advantage, in this age, for
one people, whatever they might have been
in former agos. Steam, telegraphs, and in
telligence, have brought these, to he qn ad-
Vautagous combination, for one united peo
ple.
In the inaugeral address I briefly pointed
out the total inadequacy of disunion, as •
remedy for the differences between the peo
ple of the two sections. I did so in a lan
guage which 1 cannot improve; and which,
therefore, I hog to repeat.
"One section of our country believes sla
very is riiht, and ought to be extended,
while the other believci it is wrong, and
ought not to t>e extended. This is the only
substantial dispute, The fugitit-e slave,
clause of the Constitution, and the law fp¥
the suppression of the foreign slave trade,
are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any
law can ever he in a community where •
moral sense of tho people imperfectly sup
ports the law itself. The great body of the
people abide by tbe dry legal obligation in
both cases, and a few break over in each,—
This, I think, eannothe perfectly cured; and
it would be worse in both cases after the
seperation of the sections, than before. The
foreign slavo trade, now imperfectly suppress
ed, would be ultimately revivod without re
striction in one section;, while fugitive slaves,
now only partially .surrendered, would not
he surrendered at all by the other.
Physically speaking, we cannot separate
Wo cannot remove our respective section
from each oilier, nor build an impassable
wall bctvrccu them. A husband and wife
may he dirorced, ami go out of the presence
and bsyoad the roach of each other; but the
different parts of our country cart net do,
this. They cannot but remain face to face
and intercourse, amicable or hostile, must
continue between them.
Is it possible, then, to make that inter
course more advantageous, or more satisfac
tory, after separation than before t Can a
liens mako treaties easier than friends can
make laws? Can treaties be triore faithfully
enforced between aliens, than laws among
friends? Suppose you go to war, you can
not fight always; aud when, aftsr much loss
on beth sides, and uo gain on cither you
cease fighting, tho ideutical old qtioslions, as
to terms of intercourse, are again upoa
you."
There is no lino straight or crookod, suit
able for a national boundary, upon which
to divide. Trace through from East to
West, upon tho line between tho free and
slave country, and we shall find a little more
than one third of its length are rivers, easy
to he crossed, and populated, or soon to bo
populated, thickly on both sides; while near
ly all its remaining length, are merely sur
veyors' liues over which people may walk
back and forth without any consciousness o(
their presence. No part of this tine can bo
made any more difficult to pass, by writing
it down on paper or parchment, as a nation
al boundary. The fact of separation, if i(
comes, gives up, on the part of tha seceding
section, the fugitive slave clause, along with
all other constitutional obligations upon the
section seceded from, while I should expect
no treaty stipulation would ever he made tq
take its place.
But there is anothor difficulty. The great
interior region, bouuded east by the Alle
ghanioß, aorth by the British dominions,
west by the Rocky mountains, and south by
the line along which the culture of corq and
cotton meets, and which includes part of
Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky,
Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illi
nois, Missouri, Kansas, lowa, Minnesota,
aud the territories of Dakota, Nebraska, and
part of Colorado, already has above ten
millions of people, and will have fifty roil-
I lions within fifty years, if not preveuted by
any political folly or mistake* It contains
I more of the cotfntry owned
j by the United States—certainly more than
i one milliou of square uiiles. Once half aa
populous as Massachusetts already is, it
[ would havo more than sevor.ty-five millions
.of people. A glance at the map shows that
, territorially speaking, it is the great body of
■ tha Republic. The other parts are but
margiua} bonier* to it, tbe magnificent re
i gion sloping west from the rocky mountains
, to tho I'aciSe, being the deepest also tha
; richest, ip undeveloped resources. In the pro-
I duction cf provisions, gpiius, ghisses, and
all which proceed ffom them, this great in
i teiior region is naturally one of the most
, important in the world,
i Ascertain from the statistics the small pro
: portion of the region which has, as yet been,
| brought into cultivation, and also "the largo
and rapidly increasing amount of its pro
ducts, and we shnll be overwhelmed with tbo
' magnitude of the prospect presented. And
| yet this region has no sea-coast, touches no
ocean any where. As a part of one nation
its poople now find and may fpfev ? r find,
I their way to Europe by New York, to South
America and ,4Trier, by NW Orleans, and to
Asia by Ban Ernnpujco: But separate our
common country into two nations, as design
,©l by the present rebellion, and efery ipai
of this great interior region is thereby cut
off from some one or more of tho outlets,
not, perhaps, by a physical harrier, but b
embarrassing hurt onerous triple regulati/'
And this is true,n7i-.rcra-dividjngoj><
