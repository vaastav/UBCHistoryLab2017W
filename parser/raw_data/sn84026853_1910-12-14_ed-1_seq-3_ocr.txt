\ Washington, Dec. 6.?Economy in
government affairs is the keynote of
President Taft's annual message read
before both houses of congress today.
The message approximates 40.000
words and is one oi the longest ever
submitted by a president.
Conservation of the public domain,
ship subsidy, fortification of the Pana
ma cana! and the continuation of the
present tariff board are the leading
subjects touched upon. He also re

recommendation, tending toward the
bettering of the service, made by sev
eral of the members of his cabinet.
Economy Is Urged.
In dwelling on the urgent need for
economy in government expenditures, the
president says: "Every effort has been
made by each department chief to reduce
the estimated cost of his department for
the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30.
1912. I say this in or;er that congress
may understand that thvje estimates thus
made present th? smallest sum which will
maintain the departments, bureaus and
officer of the government and meet its
othrfr obligations under existing law, and
that a cut of these estimates would re
sult in embarrassing the executive branch
of the government in the performance of
Its duties. This remark does not apply
to the river and harbor estimates, except
to those for expensts of maintenance and
the meeting of obligations under author
ized contracts, nor does it apply to the
' public building bill nor to the navy build

the estimates for them without interfer

"Against the estimates of expenditures

for next year S'JSO.OOO.OOO, making a proba
ble surplus of ordirnry receipts over or

which will ultimately be paid in bends,
it will leave a deficit for the next year of i
about $7.W.1P0, if rongress shall conclude !
to fortify the canr.l."
Wants Forest Limitation Removed.
On the subject of conservation he de
votes considerable space to forest, coal. j
oil and f?as. phosphate lands and water j
power sites. As to tb? reservation of '
forest lands he says: "The law now pro- j
hiblts the reservation of any more forest >
lands in Or^sron. Washington. Idaho. |
Kontana. Colorado and Wyoming, except !
by act of congress. I am informed by the j
department of sericulture that the gov- J
ernment owns other tracts o* timber land j
in these states wliich should be included j
in the forest reserves. I recommend t<? '
congress that the limitation herein im- !
posed be repealed.
"Congress ought to trust the executive ,
to use the power of reservation only with ;
respect to land most valuable for forest
f purposes. During the present administra- j
, Tlon. 02.250.000 acres of land largely non- J
timbered have been excluded from forest
reserves, and 3.500.000 acres of land prln- i
clpallv valuable for forest purposes have t
been Included In forest reserves, making i
a reduction In forest reserves of non- '
timbered land amounting to 2.750.000
acres."
Wants Canal Fortified.
Regains the Panama canal, the presl- '
dent asserts that unless unexpected ob- |
stacles arise the waterway will be com- i
pleted well within time limit of Janu- :
L arv 1. 1115. and within estimate of cost, j
$375,000,000. Suggestions for levying: of
tolls and mano<jr>rnent are made, and re
gard! ng fortification of the canal, he
says:
"Among ouestionc nrls'ne for present
solution is thp decision whether the can-vl
shall be fortified. T have already stated
congress that T strongly favor for
'^tlncatlon and I now re'"r??o this opin
ion and ask your consideration of the ]
subject in the light of the report already i
I before you marl** by a competent board. !
"Failure to fortify the canal would |
leave the attainment of both these aims
In the position of rights and obligations j
which we should be powerless to enforce* j
and which could never In any way be ab- '
solutely safeguarded asrainst a desperate
and irresponsible enemv."
Ship Subsidy.
The president urges such action as he
believes will Increase American trade
abroad, and says::
"Another instrumentality indispensable J
to the unhampered and natural develop
ment of American commerce is merchant !
marine. All maritime and commercial na- I
tions recognize the importance of this
factor. The greatest commercial nations. I
our competitors, jealtus'y foster their

Criticism of the Tariff.
In the space devoted to the tariff the
president say:-::
"The schedules of the rates of duty in
the Payne tariff act have been subjected
to a threat deal of criticism, some of It
just, more of it unfounded, and too much
misrepresentation. The act was adopted
in pursuance of a declaration by the par
ty which is responsible for it that cus
toms bill should be a tariff for the pro
tects :i of heme industries, the measure
of protection to be the difference be
tw.'cn the of producing the imported
article abroad and the cost of producing
it at home, together with such addition to
that difference as might give a reasonable
profit to the home producer. The basis
for the criVeism of this tariff is that in
respect to a number of the schedules the
declared measure was not followed, but a
hisher difference retained or inserted by
way of undue discrimination in favor of
certain industries and manufactures. Lit
tle. if any. of the criticism of the tariff
n:ip been directed against the protective
principle above stated: but the main body
of tlm orft:c'r?a lias been based on the at
ten-nt to conform to the measure of pro
tection was not honestly and sincerely
adhered to."
The president also refers to the appoint
ment of a bo*>rd of experts to investigate
the cost of production of various articles
included ir *he schedules of the tariff,
and <-oneiudes:
"Whether or not the protective policy Is
to be continued, ar.d the degree of protec
tion to be jK '-r 'ed to our home indus
tries. are questions which the people must
deride throusrh their chosen representa
tivc-s. But whatever policy is adopted, it
is clear that the necessary legislation
should be bas^d on an impartial, thor
ough and continuous study of the facts."
Recomrr.snds Parcels Post.
The adoption of the parrels post is
again adopted. On this subject President
Taft says: "TVith respect to the parcels

The samp argument is made against the

hamlet of the United States, and with
this machinery it is able to do a great
many things economically that if a new
organization were necessary It would be
impossible to do -without extravagant ex
penditures."
Department of Justice.
Discussing the affairs of the department
of justice, the president says:
"T invite especial attention to the prose
cutions. under the federal law of the so
called 'bucket shops.' and of those
schemes to defraud in which the use of
the mail is an essential part of the
fraudulent conspiracy, prosecutions which
have savr-d ignorant and weak members
of the public and are saving them hun
dreds of millions of dollars. The viola
te. ns of the anti-trust law present per
haps the mos* important litigation before

"In a spVial message last year I
brousrht to tin- attention of congress the
propriety and w'sdom of enacting a gen
eral law provid'ng'for the incorporation
of '""'histrial and other companies engaged
in Interstate commerce, and I renew my
recommendation in that behalf."
The cryincr need In the United States
of cheapening the cost of litigation by
simplifying judicial procedure and ex
pediting final judgment is pointed out and
action looking to correction of these evils
is urged.
The president recommends an increase
in the salari"? of federal judges.
Postal Affairs.
In regard to postal matters the presi
dent points with pride to its present effi
cient management and the recer reduc
tion in the deficit. The present unre
stricted franking privilege comer, in for
comment with a suggestion for the adop
tion of better methods for its regulation.
Abo'ish Navy Yards.
The president calls attention to certain
reforms urged by the secretary of the
navy which he recommends for adoption,
and continues:
"The secretary of the navy has given
personal examination to every navy yard.
ana rjas siuaico me uses 01 ine navy
yards with reference to the necessities
of our fleet. With a fleet considerably
less than half the size of that of the
British navy, we have shipyards more
than double the number, and there are
several of these shipyards expensively
eonipped with modern mchinery, which,
nfter investigation the*secretary of the
navy believes to be entirely useless for
naval purposes. He asks authority to
abandon certain of them and to move
their machinery to other places, where It
can be made of use." ?
Speaking of our foreign relations the
president says: "During the past year
the foreign relations of the United States
have continued upon a basis of friendship
and crood understanding.
"The year has been notable as witness
ing the pacific settlement of two impor
tant international controversies before the
permanent court of The Hague.
"The arbitration of the fisheries dispute
between the United States and Great.
Britain, which has been the source of
nearly continuous diplomatic correspond
ence since the fisheries convention of 1818,
has given an award which is satisfactory
to both parties. This arbitration is par
ticularly noteworthy not only becaure of
the eminently just results secured, but
also because it is the first arbitration held
under the general arbitration treaty of
April 4. 190$. between the United States
and Great Britain, and disposes of a con
troversy the settlement of which has re
sisted every other resource of diplomacy
and which for nearly ninety years has
been the cause of friction between two
countries whose common interest lies !n
maintaining the most friendly and cordial
relations witb each other.
President Taft makes a few recommen
dations for changes in the interstate com
merce law and says:
"Except as above. I do not recommend
any amendment to the interstate com
merce law as it stands. I do not now
recommend any amendment to the anti
trust law. In other wojds, it seems to
me that the existing legislation with
reference to the regulation of corpora
tions and the restraint of their business
has reached a point where we can stop
for a while and witness the effect of the
vigorous execution of the laws of the
statute boolcs in restraining the abuses
which certainly did exist and whiah
roused the public to demand reform."

Dry verses. 5. 6.
GOLDEN TEXT?"Lo, I am with you
alway, even unto the end of the world."
-Matt. 2S:20.
Jesus was in the grave three days, from
Friday, April 7, to Sunday, April 9, A. D.
30.
The Resurrection was early Sunday
morning, and was from a tomb In a gar
Jen near Calvary.
The home of the disciples during the
forty days was in Jerusalem.
The appearances of Jesus were in the
vicinity of Jerusalem, and in Galilee.
The Ascension was from Mount Olivet.
It is hard to conceive of a greater
disappointment, or a deeper mental
and spiritual gloom than the Egyptian
midnight darkness, without a star of
hope, which closed about the disciples
when Jesus their Lord was dead upon
the cross, and every precaution was
taken to make certain that he was
really, irrevocably dead.
The enemies of Jesus guarded
against every possibility of mistake
as to the reality of his death. This
is a very interesting example of the
Providence of God- For if Jesus did
not die, he could not be raised from
the dead. Moreover if the proof that
Jesus really died came from his
friends, people would question wheth
er they did not in some way deceive,
But the enemies of Jesus were very
anxious that he should be really dead,
in order that he might never trouble
tbem again. Hence they did every
thing possible to accomplish their
purpose. The soldiers pierced his
body with a spear, and blood and wa
ter flowed from the wound?a proof
of death (John 19: 34, 35). The cen
inrinn who was accustomed to exe
cutions, was convinced that he! was
dead, and so reported to Pilate. lThe
tomb in which he was burled was a
new one, in which no one had ever
been buried,' and so there could be no
doubt as to the identity of the body
of Christ.
At the request of the chief priests,
the stone against the door of the se
pulcher was sealed, and a Roman
guard placed around the tomb, so that
no one could take away the body and
then pretend that Jesus had risen
(Matt. 27: 62-66).
Jesus rose early on Sunday morn
ing. Of the method or circumstances
we know only what is stated here.
'Behold, there was a great earthquake.
Early in the morning, before tne ar
rival of the women at the tomb. For
the (an) angel of the Lord descended
from heaven. A divine messenger, to
overawe the guards, and show that
Jesus rose, and was not taken from
the tomb by human power, and that
the same body came forth that had
been buried. Rolled back the stone
from the door, and sat upon it, as a
guard waiting to give the needed in- |
formation to the disciples. His coun
tenance (his appearance) was like
lightning, in vivid and intense bright
ness. And his raiment white as snow."
This was heavenly apparel, the visible
expression of his heavenly nature.
It seems that Mary Magdalene first
reached the tomb, and seeing the
stone rolled from the door, hastened
to tell the news to Peter. The others
then came, and entering into the tomb,
"found not the body of the Lord Je
sus" (Luke).
It was fitting that the resurrection
should occur at the dawning of the
day. It was the dawning of the
world's day of redemption. Mark adds,
"and Peter." For he would be the
saddest of all. This message would
be a drop of joy in his cup then, as
showing Christ's forgiveness.
The Ascension was the only fitting
close of the earthly life of Jesus.
When the disciples had been thorough
ly convinced Dy "many miaiuDie
proofs" during forty days, that Jesus
was really alive, then he went home
to his throne and to his Father in the
only way that would enable them to
realize that he was their ever-living
Lord and Saviour. The last view of
Jesus was not on the cross, but as
cending In glory, a living Saviour.
The resurrection of Christ is the as
surance that the death of the body is
not the end of existence. For the soul
lives on without this mortal body, but
receives a body in the other world,
like Christ's glorious body.
The resurection life removes all
fears and doubts with the assurance
of a continued life hereafter, all we
have gained in this life being but a
preparation for that eternal life.
The very soul of our religion is
missionary, progressive, world embra
cing; it would cease to exist if It
ceased to be missionary, if it disre
garded the parting words of its found
er, 'Go ye, therefore, and teach all na
tions,' etc. The spirit of truth is the
life-spring of all religion; and where
it exists, it must manifest itself, it
must plead, it must persuade. It
must also convert. There may be
times when silence is gold, and speech
silver ;but there are times also when
silence Is death, and speech is life?
the very life of Pentecost.
The progress of the church through
missions is one of the most hopeful
signs of the times. The era of mis
sions has been its era of greatest ad
vancement at home. The awakening
of the nations all over the world; the
fruits of mission work made manifest
within the last ten years, are an in
spiration to the whole Christian world
to larger giving and to deeper conse
cration. Conversion and joining rhc
church are but the beginning of the
Christian life. Christ's last command
was, "Go ye, therefore." Do not wait
for people to come to you, but go tc
them.
Parent's Complaint.
There is at least one man in Micni
gan who is determined that his son
shall have as good an education as his
own. He recently sent the following
communication to the superintendent
of schools: "Dear Sir. my boy come
home today with his head broke open
by a bigger boy. I wish you would
look into it. My boy comes Co school
to learn brains, and not to have them
knocked out."
Misery is the mental chaos of thf
self-centered mind.
The Church?Its
Danger and
Security
By REV. W. Q. CURRY
TEXT?Awake, awake, put on thy
strength; O Zlon.?Isaiah LII. L
Jehovah spoke this when Judaism
lad fallen into great weakness. Ene
iiiies beset on every side. The church
las often had its times of moral
weakness. Deliverance always came.
The slumbering giant not only awoke
but exerted himself. A deep slum
ber prevailed when Christ came. Great
systems of idolatry prevailed. The
:.rue God was nigh forgotten. The
Saviour gathered a little band around
him and sent them forth. With
matchless strength they attacked the
;he powers and Satan's kingdom was
shaken. Another crisis came?papal
corruption. Pure Christianity slept
beneath gaudy trappings of Catholi
cism, movements for freedom were
tvatched, and dungeons were filled
with those who dared look up.
'Awake awake!" was sounded. Mar
:in Luther , arose to restore spiritual
ity. Since then the truth has been
saining power. When we consider
the facilities we have, the outlook is
now hopeful.
There is another side.
L The church is threatened with
danger.
1. Danger from peculiar activity
and excitability of the times in
which we live?entirely an earnest
ige. New discoveries, new forces ap
pearing. Law of change is every
where. Wonderful schemes claim
public attention. Science, art are
Jver presenting new questions. Our
minds and hands are full; never was
there more activity. It is not an un
fortunate condition. We would not
iock tne wneeis or progress, ana re
mand the age back to the darkness of
the past. In the midst of the excite
ment we are in danger of infection, un
less there be a corresponding earnest
ness in Christian character. Our dan
ger is inability to control these forces.
We are too much controlled by them.
We are being permeated by the spirit
of th? world, instead of permeating it
with our spirit. We must show a re
ligion full of life and energy?not a
cold, sleepy religion.
2. The tendenc;- to innovation. We
believe all essentials are clearly re
vealed in the Scriptures. Yet we
think more light and improved meth
ods may be emlpoyed. But from Ger
many comes a spirit that would say
our foundations. It has found its
way into our theological schools,
and is poisoning the minds of the
rising ministry. They tell us that
reason and not faith must be the
guide. They have discovered the IjH
ble is an antiquated book, and the
gospel too cold. They would take
away the Bible as a perfect rule of
faith and practise. The danger lies
In having our minds alienated from
the simplicity of the g03pel, and a
desire to seek the novelties. We need
oow more than ever before to cry for
| the old paths.
3. In danger from the increasing
! boldness and energy of the enemies of
Christianity. We are no longer at
| tacked by a few, but the ranks are
strong and the infidelity declares its
truths to be the only truths. It has
never displayed so much determina
tion. It is widespread and is with
men "in daily walks; is in politics,
taints legislation, and has taken hold
upon the public press. The world
Is flooded with its literature. Vast
multitudes listen to infidelity's mod
ern apostle.
In the light of all these facts hare
we not cause for alarm? Are we in
a condition to successfully contend
with these forces? The church is
not- putting forth her strength. She
has had smooth sailing a long time,
and sleeps.
II. What are the elements of
strength.
1. Sound doctrine. In these days
of laxness and insidiousness we need
to contend earnestly for the faith
once delivered to the saints. The
doctrines of depravity, atonement and
salvation by grace must be empha
sized. Let this be done, and innaei
ity will not affect the religion of per
sonal experience.
2. Spiritual life We need a high
er-toned spirituality, a religion that
enters into all our social and business
relations, giving color and shape to
the daily life.
How shall this strength, which God
calls on us to exert, be put on? It
is not physical, but spiritual strength
that we need. It must be put on upon
our knees.
The Life of All Our Joys.
If there be one name sweeter than
another in a believer's ear, it is the
name of Jesus. Jesus! it is the name
which moves the harps of heaven to
melody. Jesus! the life of all our
joys. If there be one name more
charming, more precious than another,
it is this name. It is woven into the
very warp and woof of our psalody.
Many of our hymns begin with it, and
searcely any that are good for any
thing end without. It is the sum to
tal of all delights. It is the music
with which the bells of heaven ring; a
song in a word; an ocean for compre
hension, although a drop for brevity;
a matchless oratorio in two syllables;
a gathering up of the hallelujahs ol
eternity in five letters.?C. A. Spur
| geon.
His Saving Power.
I Jesus said: '"All power is given
unto Me in heaven and In earth; go
| ye therefore and teach all nations,
j baptizing them in the name of the
I Father, and of the Son, and of the
I Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe
| all things whatsoever I have com
\ manded you; and lo, I am with you
always, even unto the end of the
I world. Amen."
He displayed His wonneriui power
while here upon earth. His miracles
j were a definite attestation to His mis
I sion. lie claims and exercises that
' saving, helping power?a power no!
now limited by physical conditions,
: as might have dooii charged in His
I earthly life, but a power which flows j
| with authority from the mediatorial j
! throne on which He reigns.

RED CROSS SEAL IN HISTORY
First Used During the American Civil
War?Now an Aid In Fight
ing Tuberculosis.
Red Cross Christmas seals date
back in their origin to "charity
stamps," first used for the soldiers'
relief funds in Boston in 1862, during
the Civil war. After the war, this
method of raising money was discon
tinued In this country for a genera
tion, although it found vogue in Por
tugal, Switzerland, Australia, France,
Spain, Denmark, Norway, Russia,
Sweden and other European coun
tries. There are now several hun
dred different types of charity stamps
used in all parts of the world.
Stamps or seals were first used to'
get money for the anti-tuberculosis
crusade in Norway and Sweden in
1904. After being used in thess coun
tries for three years, as a direct re
sult of the interest of Jacob Riis in
this movement, the Delaware Anti
Tuberculosis association, headed by
Miss Emily P. Bissell, and the Tied
Cross society of Delaware combined
In issuing a tuberculosis stamp. So
successful was this campaign that
nearly ?3,000 was realized, and the
next year, in 1908, the American Red
Cross was induced to issue a national
Red Cross tuberculosis stamp. From
this sale, $135,000 was realized, that
amount being almost doubled in 1909.
This year, for the first time, the sale
is organized on a comprehensive
basis, taking in all parts of the
United States. A million for tuber
culosis work is confidently expected.
