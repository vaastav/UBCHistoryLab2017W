TO HANG.
tDonnell Found Guilty and Sentenc
ed to Death.
London, He". 1. At tlie O'Donnell trial
to-day the court room was crowded, but only
a few outside. iryor sat behind Kussell, the
senior counsel. u'Donnell was calm. Wal
ter Young, the Port Elizabeth cab driver,
testified for defense, said he frequently drove
Carey's family -around Port Elizabeth, they
ought to know him; be once said to Tom, at
Port Elizabeth, "you are a fine fellow, why
did'nt you shoot O'Donnell when he shot your
father?" Tom answered, "I had no revolver; I
went to get it but when I went there it was
gone, because my father had it." Witness had
mentioned this to other cab drivers. m cross
examination he did not materially change his
testimony. No other witness call for defense
and Kussell began to address the jury.
Russell urged the jury to dismiss from their
minds all they may have read on the subject
of the killum of Carey. The prisoner did not
deny the shooting of Carey; the question for
consideration ol tlie jury was, "Did he do it un
der reasonable apprehension of his life?" If
so, they should acquit him. 1 f fhort of this.
O'Donnell acted only under threat of personal
violence, and they could not convict him of
murder, although it might not be possible to
let bim go free altogether. The statement was
utterly false that I'Donnell went on tlie steam
er to "Kiufaun's Castle" to track Carey like a
sleuth hound at the bidding of a secret society.
Kussell said these were only newspaper
charges which he warmly denounced. Judge
Denman remarked that counsel w:is hardly
promoting the interests of his client, lie
trusted that the Jury would not be
influenced by anything except the evidence
given In court. Russell said the accusation
had an important bearing, because it sug
gested the words "I was sent to do it," which
were put into O'Donuell's mouth by Mrs. Cary,
imt In deference to the judge's remark he
would make no further reference to the news
paper attack. Kussell then compared O'Don
nell, who was an houest, bard working man,
with Carey, who was a villain, execrated by
the people, unpardoned by the queen, known
to be cruel, treacherous and desuerate. forced
by a man likely to denounce -Um. he would not
scruple to resort to any weUon to kill, nnd
Khen in all his murderous cousniracies he took
care of his own life. It was unreasonable to
suppose if O Donnell had premeditated the
murder ho would have committed it in the
presence of several witnesses.
Gen. Pryor states he had resolved to apply
for a hearing in the case of O'Donnell and force
ou explicit refusal to hisappllcution, but other
counsel in the case gave in writting their opin
ion that the appearance of an American law-
?er, sent by Irish Americans, would be fatal to
he prisoner. They further stated that if tlie
application was made they would surrender
their briefs. Gen. Pryor finally consulted
O'Donnell. who decided to abide by the opin
ion of Kussell and Sullivan.
Kussell, with dramatic effect, gave, O'Don
nell's own story for murder substantially as al
ready published. The attorney-general and
Judge Denman at first objected. Russell then
narrated in brief the altercation that took
place in the cabin of the Melrose Castle be
tween the two men, drawing pistols by both
and the shooting of Carey, nil of which he said
occupied less time than it took to tell it.
Young Carey was, he contended, unworthy of
credence and It was beyond doubt that Carey
had a pistol at the time he was shot : the boy's
testimony to the eltect that his father went
ashore at Cape Town without it, and did not
carry It after his Identity was discovered was
false. O'Donuell's remark to Cubitt after he
was shown Carey's portrait, "I'll shoot him,"
was merely a piece of laughing bravado, hav
ing no indication in it of a serious purpose, and
to which nobody would attach Importance.
Russell said although not a witness saw the
pistol In Carey's hand, yet it was quite likely
the pistol was drawn, but owing to tlie uncer
tain light In the cabin, and the excitement of
the moment it escaped observation. He
Buomitiea mat tne ooy, carcy picnea up tue
revolver when his father fell and Kent it for the
purpose of shooting O'Donnell if lie got a
chance or for the purpose of concealing it, in
order to make it appear that O'Donnell com
mitted an unprovoked murder, Kussell after
insisting upon the credibility of the testimony
of the cab driver madu an eloquent appeal to
the jnry for unprejudiced and calm considera
tion of the case. If they were drawn ir res! sta
bly to the conclusion that the prisoner was
guilty they would convict, but if they felt there
were Important parts of evidence wliiuh crum
bled when they attempted to stand upon them
then, whatever the suspicions they niiulit have
they would give the prisouer the benefit
of doubt. It was better one nulltv
" persons should sometimes escape than an in
nocent one suffer. Russell siHike for four
hours and on ooncludliiK was loudly applauded
The judge sternly repressed applause. Attor-
ney-Geueral James closed the case for the
government. The attornev-general occupied
an hour and a half. The ludire then delivered
Ids charge to the jury, which at 7 p. m. re
tired. At 7:40 they returned and requested
further explanations. After receiving the ln

and they again retired. At 8 the jury came
into the court with a verdict of "culltv." Jiubie

Judge ordered his removal. The police seized

Mr. chairman and Gentlemen of the House
l our committee has lust formally notified me
of mv unanimous nomination for speaker of
ine nouse oi representatives oi tue jforty-eigntn
congress, and 1 am here to thauk you very
briefly and very earnestly for the confidence re
posed in me. If this had been a mere personal
contest between me and the other three dis
tinguished gentlemen whose names were men-
uoneu in connection with this nomination, 1
should have had but little hones of success.
1 hey are all gentlemen of great ability, long
experience and undoubted integrity, and 1 as
sure tliein and their friends that this contest
closes, so far as I am concerned, without the
slightest change of friendly and personal rela
tion that .heretofore existed between us.
(ientlemen, I trust you may never, have
reason to reirret the action of this
evening, and when the labors of the Forty
eight u congress are closed you will be able to
congratulate yourselves that no material in
terest of your party or country have been inju
riously affected bv mv administration of the
otllce for which you have nominated me. In
met, igoa step itinuer, anu venture to ex
press my confident hope that everv substantial
interest will be advanced and promoted by the
united efforts of the presiding officer and tlie
Democratic majority on the floor. Such a re
sult will insure victory In the great contests
yet to come, anil guarantee a lone line of Dem
ocratic-executives, with honest, economical
and const itutioual administration of our public
anairs. nut you nave yet much otlier labor to
perform, and anain thaukine vou for what vou
nave already done, I shall say no more.
Air. naiidaii men a ti dressed the caucus. He
lid: "A majority of the Democratic repre
sentatives of congress have seen fit to desig
nate me uisiinguisneu gentleman oi Ken
tucky for the exulted position of speaker. His
tominisiraiion snau nave my nnn-nxeu sup-
lion. 10 my inenus in ine minority wnomay
)o disappointed at this result, I tender mv
rsttltude for their support, which was actuated
iv noble, disinterested friendship, based on
the hiirhest considerations of dutv. as thev be
lieved. I bow to the decision of the majority
of my colleagues. The duty imposed upon me
by my constituents will be performed with
earnest zeal for the triumph of my party and
real prosperity of my country. If in the fu
ture there by any services I can render that will
servo these ends, it will be performed with a
riieeniuuess no oilier citizen can excel." ( Ap
plause).
Air. cox iook tne tioor ana saia."i tenaer my
acknowledgement to the gentlemen who have
given me confidence and especially to the six
teen gentlemen trom Now lork. 1 have to say
1 am relieved L-om the responsibility which
possibly niiuht hnve fallen unon mv. frail
shoulders, f sympathize with the gentleman
from Kentucky who is to benr the burdens of
the great office of speaker: in so far as I can
assist him in any way he will find me ready as
a coadjutor with the distinguished gentleman
from Pennsylvania. The future of our party de-
peuus largely upon us action on tne nscai
questions they connect themselves twith,
llbertys life, with trade with commerce and
witli magnanimity. While thanking those who
sustained me during the long siege, I confess
to feeling somewhat wearied of being upon my
feet during the last two weeks. The result
in 1SK4 depends upon the wisdom
with which we exercise our duties in this con
gress. N ithout wise forecast and discrete hor
oscope we will be in the future, as we have
been in the past, direlict, beaten, doubly dis
comlitted; but I hops for better things and
snau euueitvor in my uuiuuie way tuuo some

and discretion.

New York. Dec. 1. At half-past 8 o'clock

great volumes of smoke belched from the win
dows ot tiie Jvtugnts iemplar asylum tn the
mansard story, just below the roof and dome.
A thick volume of smoke also poured from the
roof, followed by sheets of flame dartine hiirh
in the air. The report that the Masonic Tem
ple was on fire spread rapidly, and hundreds
of the fraternity hurried to the place. A large
iorce oi pouee Kept tne crowd back irom tne
firemen. Patrick Lynch aud Samuel Warren,
two of the foremost firemen in the mansard
story, were struck to the floor by heavy plas

property destroyed. After two hours' hard
work, a further spread of the flames was pre
vented hi the mansard portion, but were still
raging iir the root. It is thought the loss will
not fall short of $100,000, as the costly frescoe
ing aud other decorations are destroyed in the
cominnudery room. The order of the Mystic
Shrine, largely composed of Masons, met last
night until a late hour, and it is supposed a

lower floors of which were occupied by Metzler

HOUSE.
At 12 o'clock Clerk McPherson rapped the
house to order aud proceeded to call the roll
of representatives. The state of Mississippi
being reached the clerk said he wished to
make a statement as to his failure to put upon
the roll the name of any representative elect
from the Second district. The reason was lliat
no paper which could be considered a certili-
cateof election. In the sense of the law, had
been presented to him. Chalmers had filed
four exhibits in support of his claim, but nei
ther individually nor collectively did tlie ex
hibits afford the clerk sufficient authority of
enrollment. If the governor of Mississippi
had issued a certificate of election to any
one it was not presented to the
clerk. In regard to the First district-of North
Carolina, the clerk had not received a certifi
cate of t he successor of Poole, deceased. The
roll call disclosed 316 members.
Nominations for speaker being in order, Mr.
Geddessaid: "I nominate for speaker of this
house of the Forty-Eighth congress Mr. Car
iuif of Kentucky, a man of acknowledged pre
eminent qualifications for tlie place. Mr. Can
non presented the name of Keifer, of Oliio,
and Mr. Lyman the name of Bobinson, of Mass
achusetts. Messrs. Morrison. Tucker. Keed and
Calkings were appointed tellers. The clerk
proceeded to call tne roil, ine result was as
ollows: Carlisle 191, Keifer 112, Kobmson 2,
(James and Lyman), J. S. Wise, of Virginia, 1,
(York), Wadsworth, of New York. 1, (Ochil

tucky. Mr. Carlisle being elected, Messrs.
Kandal and Keller escorted ine gentieuiau 10
the chair. His entrance iuto tlie chamber was
the signal for loud applause. The oath of ot-
nce was auministereu.
Uuou taking the chair Carlisle after thank
ing the representatives for tlie high honor con
ferred and pointing out that the late apportion
ment makes preservation of order more diffi
cult than ever asked their co-operation and
farbearance, then said : "I am sure gentlemen
all matters of legislation presented to this
conirress will receive from vou such careful
consideration as a magnitude, character and
interests involved require, ana your action
unon them will be wise conversative patriotic.
Sudden and radical changes of laws and regu
tions affecting commercial and industrial in
terest of the people ought never be made un
less imperatively demanded by some public
existing circumstances such changes would
not be favorably received by any considerable
number of those who have given serious at
tention to the subject. (Applause). Many ro
fonns;are undoubtedly nece sary, and It may
be your duty, after a careful examination of
the subject, to decide how far they should ex
tend, and in what manner they should be made,
(Ap plause). If there be any who fear your ac
tion on this or any otlier subject, it will actu
ally be injurious to any interest, or eeu afford
reasonable cause of alarm, I am quite sure
they will be agreeably disappointed. (Ap
plause.) What tho country lias a right
to expect is strict economy of tne
administration in every department of
governmentjust and equal for public purKses,
faithful observance of the limitations of the
constitution, scrupulous regards for the rights
and interests of the great body of the people
in order that thev may be protected, for con

to take the oath of office prescribed by the
constitution aud laws, and proceed to complete
tho organization of the House." (Applause.)
Tiie iron ciao oatn was auministereu py
Kelly, the oldest member, after which
Speaker Carlisle called the House to
order. As the states were called the
representatives came forward and qualified.
When Kansas was reached Peters, repre-sentative-at-large
of that state, at the request
of Springer, was asked to step aside. Springer
stilted the governor ot Kansas bad forwarded
nim a position, signed by himself and other
state officers and a large number of citizens,
protesting to the admissions ot Peters, on the
ground that under the constitution and laws of
Kansas he was ineligible to hold office. He,
however, withdrew tne objection aud Peters
took the oath.
Mr. Converse, rising to a question of privi
lege, said the clerk of the house this morning
stated that no certificate from the governor of
Mississippi had been presented by any person
claiming to be representative from the second
district of that state. He would place no name
on the roll for satisfactory reasons. Said Mr.
Converse, Mr. Manning had chosen not to

upon Manning's attorney and asked permis
sion to present Manning's credentials. It had
been the policy of the house bv unknown pre
cedent to seat a member who had a certificate
from the eovernor. He asked to have the cer

Mr. Keller said Mr. Manning never accepted
a certificate, and put on theclerk's files a state
ment showing he was beaten by 980 votes. He
had also, in effect, stated he would not ask to
be seated on that certificate. Did the gentle
man propose to force Mr. Maiming to do what
he wonlu not do himself?

Mauninc hold a certificate and was prima

Jeff Brown and Dave Gracy are
very fond of boating, and no boat suits
them so well as a sail boat. Sunday
they procured one and placidly sailed
up the river as far as Barton creek.
Here they went to land and in the at
tempt Dave grabbed the mast to steady
himself and over went tne boat, ana
he took a very gracy plunge into seven
feet or cold water, jen sat on tne
bank and fairly split his sides with
laughter, as he saw his friend emerge
from the waves like a rat from a swill
barrel. Then they got into the boat
and started out, and Jeff was sitting
in the stern. The sail reefed again,
and this time Jeff slid off head-fore
most into the placid Colorado and
Dave sat down and held his sides.
He came up and into the boat, but his
boiled shirt and nice clothes were in a
terrible fix. They made their way
home and vowed they would not tell
a living soul, but the affair leaked out
and a Statesman representative got
hold of it.

they would be at any other time than
on the evening of the opening of Con
gress. The tomes are in a measure
used in the speakership contest but
oniy in a speculative wav as merits
effecting the chances of candidates.
I3y the time this is printed the caucus
will have done its work and the ex
citement will be over. The country
will know who are to control the
House, and Texas will know whether
Dorn or Wintersmith will carry off
one of the offices on the Btaff of the
House.
The best, and at the same time the
worst feature of the contest is the
courtesy the candidates show each
other by calling and paying respects
at eacn otner s neaaquarters. to the
uninitiated tnis looks sweet and
brotherly. Here it is tacitly looked
on as condensed hypocrisy. The can
vass is not conducted by the leader-
snip oi tne party, jn o procetdure is
mapped out by farseeing wisdom to
help the party in the future. If
everything turns out well it will be
by main strength and awkwardness;
if a mistake is made no wise man who
sees' and reads will be surprised. In
the Metropolitan hotel Hon. Casey
Young, of Tennessee, a man of fine
sense, promptly gave me his view of
the situation thus: "The Democratic
party stands pledged to the coun
try, by every foim and method
known for the declaration of po
litical principles, to secure proper
legislation in respect to two great ini
tial questions of party and political
policy that constitute the only broad
iin distinctive issues which now di
vide the two parties. These two are
monopolies and the tariff. Four-fifths
of the Democrats in the next house
were elected under direct or implied
instructions from their constituents
to use their best efforts to check the
growth of monopolies, and effect a
judicious and conservative revision of
the present revenue system. Unless
we respond promptly and fearlessly
to this demand the people, who have
been so loner expectinar something
from the Democracy, will lose faith
in its professions. They will believe,
as the Republicans charge, that we
have no principles or policy; that we
are a cowardly herd of place hunters,
with no higher aim than to turn the
Republicans out in order that we may
get in. If the Democracy put a tariff
reform pank in their platform for the
presidential race of 1884 the people
will ask why the house, with a Demo
cratic majority ef sixty-four, did not
act when it had a chance.
The antecedents of the three can
didates for speaker, briefly sketched,
are as follows: John Griffin Carlisle,
born in Campbell county, Ky.,
in 1835, is forty-eight years old.
starting with a common school educa
tion, he was admitted to the bar in
1858. His political career began with
two terms in his state legislature, fol
lowed by two terms in the state sen
ate. His next advance was lieutenant
governor, as which he served from
1874 till 187&. He neia positions as
national convention delegate and
presidential elector. He went to the
Forty-fifth, Forty-sixth and Forty
seventh congresses, in which, at dif
ferent times, he served on committees
of ways and means, on the law re
specting the election of president and
vice president and on improvement or
the Mississippi river. He is authority
in the house on political economy and
constitutional law, and has at all
times, with force and eloquence, advo
cated revenue reform.
Samuel Sullivan Cox. born in Zanes-
ville. O.. in 1822, comes of a political
family, his father having been a mem
ber of the Ohio senate and a promi
nent politician, his grandfather a gen
eral in the war of the reyolution and a
member of the Tenth congress, and his
grandfather, on his mother's side,
state treasurer of Ohio. Embarking,
after a liberal education, in law, he
soon abandoned it to become editor of
the Columbus Statesman, quitting
this to go to Peru as secretary of our
legation. He served in the Thirty-fifth,
Thirty-sixth, Thirty-seventn ana
Thirty-eigth congresses as mem
ber from Ohio. In 1856 he
settled in New York city and
in 1860 reentered congress and has
served continuously as a member from
New York state ever since. He was
elected speaker for a term of two
weeks in 1876, filling the vacancy
caused by the death of M. C. Kerr.
He was chairman of committee on
foreign affairs in the Forty-sixth Con
gress ; is a much traveled man and an
author.
Samuel J. Randall was born in Phil
adelphia in 1828, his father being a
lawyer of note, a politician and an in
timate of Clay, Webster and Dallas.
After an academic education the sub
ject of this sketch tried mercantile
life, but became a member of the city
council, serving four years, alter
ward going to the state senate for two
terms. He served in the army and
was elected to Congress in 1863, and
has been a member ever since. He
comes next after W. D. Kelly in length
of service in the house. He has been
speaker three times, was a member of
committee on public buildings, bank
ing and currency, appropriations,
rules, ways and means, and public ex
penditures. He was chairman of the
committees on expenditures, appro
priations and rules at different periods
of his service, tie is regaraea as a
leading light in his party to-day, his
natural ability and adaptability for
politics being greater than those of
his competitors. He is distinguished
chiefly by his fight against the force
bill.
As a matter connected with the or
ganization of the house in which Tex
ans are generally most interested the
status ot tne canvass or j. u. winter
smith, of Tyler, for doorkeeper and
A. J. Dorn, of Austin, for postmaster,
should be explained. Wintersmith,
whether from having been on the
ground longer or because he is person
ally very popular in all circles, is more
tavorea oy tne Texas legislature.
Dorn conducts his canvass courteous
ly, but there is a feeling among Win
tersmith's friends that Dorn by his
candidacy is endangering both his
own and the former's chances of suc
cess. When interviewed by me on
this matter of gossips, Dorn said he
felt no chidings of conscience, in view
of the fact that he had announced for
the office as lone: a?o as last sprin?.
As the matter now looks the outcome
will be either a defeat of both the
Texas candidates or the success of
Wintersmith and a generous provision
for Dorn, whose record is honorable.
It is charged that the latter has pool
ed interests with Gen. Fields, of Geor
gia, Wintersmiths opponent, but he
denies any combinations, and the fact
that he is much in the company of
Fields proves nothing directly. It
It would be more probable that old
army associations between himself
and Fields would cause a bond of
sympathy between the two.
A morning paper takes up
the cudgel for Wintersmith and
charges that Fields has filed an appli
cation with the president for the office
of consul at (Jalro, jgypt. J . M. Clai
borne, chairman of the Texas state
Democratic executive committee, has
been busy trying to defeat Winter-
smith, whose offense was an expose in
the News of the fact that Claiborne
returned to the congressional cam
paign committee, at Washington,
box of documents sent by them for
distribution in Texas, Claiborne re
fusing to take the box out of the ex
press office at Galveston, where it lay
awhile, marked "C. O. D.," the freight
due being $5, or possibly $8. I be
lieve tte burden of Claiborne's argu
ment is that Wintersmith's Democra
cy was not of the right sort, since it
did not deter him from exposing a
Demo ratio cold-bloodednes toward
i arty interests because of a matter of
five or ten dollars stood in the way
an unusually large outlay for the
glory of of a state chairmanship.
Ex-Senator Geo. E. Spence, of Ala-
uama, arrived nere to-day under ar
rest under a charge of contempt of

that the proceedings will be the usual
fine, with imprisonment, as there is no
precedent for granting the party in
contempt a hearing in his own de
fense either bv himself or at
torney. The fact that clerks in
the department of justice have

For preparing unglazed pottery to
write upon it with ink this method
has lately been invented. A whey is
used; which is obtained by adding a
small quantity of acid to skimmed
milk, and separating the precipitate
by filtration. The plates prepared
from white pipe clay are impregnated
with the nitrate and dried, and then
it is quite as easy to write upon them
as upon imperfectly sized paper. The
process is simple enough.
If disease has entered the system
the only way to drive it out is to pu

end, as is acknowledged by all med

than iron. The fault hitherto has
been that iron could not be so pre
pared as to be absolutely harmless to
the teeth. This difficulty has been
overcome by the Brown Chemical

COMPTROLLER S DEPARTMENT.
The comptroller deposited in the
state treasurer $26,000 Hays county
courthouse bonds recently cottracted
for by the board of education for the
school fund.
The Western Union telearraph com
pany paid in SI 500.58 astax due the

following railroad payments on pas

The comptroller is in receipt of a
letter from the mayor of Dallas in
quiring if the board of education can
purchase city bonds, which it has been
stated in the papers several times, the
board has concluded not to purchase.
He eets on an averacre two letters a
week on the su bject. A county judge
even writes to inquire if the county
can invest its school money in school
bonds, although the law plainly pro-
iaes ior sucn investments.
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.
The board of education yesterdav
purchased at par $20,000 of 8 per cent.
Cameron county bonds. They are
bonds funded under the act of 1874 to
pay the indebtedness of the county.
becretary LJaker.oi tne board, is sur
prised at what he considers the prema-
ture publication
ot his report in one
of the papers, as he contemplated
making some changes in it and did
not expect it to be published until
acted upon by the board.
In 104 counties the average school
term was four months at a cost to the
state of 90 cents per capita per
month.
In seventeen counties reporting, the
average term was 8 19-20 months, at a
cost of 40 cents per capita per month.
Reports ha,ve been received from
125 out of 171 counties and from sev
enteen cities and towns out of forty
five reported last year.
ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT.
Attorney-General Templeton is en
gaged in the investigation of the va
lidity of bonds issued by counties for
building bridges. If declared valid,
another question will occur if the
board of education can match in them
for the school fund. The board, how
ever, are not wanting in such other
funds as they desire for investments.
Should bridge bonds be found invalid,
the ruling will doubtless effect their
price upon the market. Holders,
however, will be safe, as the counties
are guarantees for them. The attorney-general's
opinion, which, how
ever, has not the effect of finality, is
supposed to be adyerse to the validity
of such bonds.
DEAF AND DUMB ASYLUM.

on the governor yesterday and stated
that twenty miles of his fence was
cut, and about 10,000 posts and 2 car
loads of wire and some hay and other
property were destroyed by tne cut
ters in that section. He thinks men
who own no land and want free pas
turage for their cattle are at the bot
tom of this vandalism. He hoped
that something could be done by ithe
legislature to stop such deviltry.
From other sources tne accounts
from Coleman county state that near
ly all the fences there have been de
stroyed without regard to the size of
the pastures.
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT.
Attorney General Templeton has a
letter from a Denver lawyer stating
that he had brought suit for libel

THE LITTLE (JLX.
Another Sliootln? Scrape In Which
One Xcgro Lets Daylight Tiiroit;;U
Another.
Yesterday mornine. about 9 o'clock
a shooting affair took place in the
yard to the r.iar of Simon's eating
house. The facts as reported by those
who saw the occurrence appear to ba
as follows: Some time ago Steve
Mayes was employed as cook in Si
mon's restaurant, and Mr. Billeisen
says he was quarrelsome with the un
der cooks, so much so that several
had loft as thev could not stand
his abuse. Mr. Billeisen finally
hired a young colored man by the
name of Ed. Dapsrart to assist Mayes
about his cooking, and Maves was
told by Mr. Billeisen that if he quar
relled witn uaggart he would dis
charge him. Sunday night Mayes
went oil on a lark, and vosterdav
morning did not get back to his work
until nearly 9 o'clock. He gave Mr.
Billeisen Rome trumned-up excuse for
his absence, but Mr. Billeisen says he
knew he was in the First ward in
dulging in several kinds of dissipa
tion, and so he talked a little
high Dutch to him, giving
him to understand that a few more
such episodes would vacate his posi
tion. Mayes was, as a consequence
in no very amiable frame of mind
when Mr. Billeisen ief t him. He took
offence at something the helper, Dag
garo,, did and began to swear at him
and call him more titles than an Eng
lish duke ever possessed, and the
young man went to Mr. Billeisen and
entered complaiut, saying if he was to
be abused in that manner he would
not remain in the cook room
longer. Mr. Belleisen went to Mayes
again and told him if he said another
word to Daggart he would discharge
him forthwith. So soon as Billei
sen's back was turned Mayes, how
ever, began to take Daggart to task
for complaining to their employer,
and the young man said something in
response that greatly incensed the
cook, whereupon he knocked Dag-
gart down- with his fist and then
jumped on to him and began to choke
him when he was down. Mr.
Billeisen heard the ' fuss and
came running out as Mayes wa.i
choking Daggart. Daggart, who had
for some time been very much in fear
of the hot-tempered cook, had pro
videded himself with a pistoL and
when Mayes was choking him he
drew the weapon and put it against
Mayes' breast and fired, sending the
ball through him. Mayes got up, and
Daggart, who thought he had Killed
his man, took leg bail and gave chase
to the police, who ran him as far as
the river, when he jumped into the
water, gained the woods on the other
side and succeeded in foiling the offi
cers. The foregoing report of the
matter i3 obtained from Mr. Billeisen
and the other persons present who
saw the trouble.
Many persons will not ride upon
fast trains i rom fear of accident to
them, thinking that the chances of
disaster are greater than at lower
speed, but upon old roads well man-
Fged there is little difference between
fifty miles an hour and twenty-five,
as regards danger. As for accidents,
a man's bead breaks as easily at
twenty miles an hour as at forty.
In many of the business ho i.ses of
