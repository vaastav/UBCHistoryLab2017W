Eon. John E. Trice.
This gentleman, who is a can
didate for Congress in the 8th,
has been here since Sunday mak
ing the acquaintance, as far as
possible, of the Democrats of the
county.
Mr. Trice is a native of Chester
county, and one of the best farm
ersinthe State. Besides being
an excellent farmer he has also
served two terms in the General
Assembly of Tennessee as floater
from the counties of Chester, Mad
ison and Henderson, lie was a
member of the Legislatures of '91
and '93, and while in that body
took an active part in the appro
priation for the home for the ex-
Confederates and also for the
present penitentiary system.
Mr. Trice has made a splendid
impression upon those he met and
has certainly laid the foundation
for a large support in this county.
Mr. Trice is in the race to win
and shows undoubted ability to
cope with any competitor.

Dear Sirs: I bad no faith in tes

until I took Dr. Caldwell's Syrup
Fepsin, my attention being called
to it by a letter from some ono who
had been cured of what he called
chronic constipation, and I began
taking it for my case. If any one
who reads this has constipation or
Btomach trouble, I earnestly reco
mmend Dr. Caldwell's Syrup rep
sin. My oue experience and com
plete euro prompts me to promise
that you will find it will do all that
is claimed for it. Respt., -

various remedies but did not ob
tain permanent relief until I com'
monced nsing One Minute Cough
Cure,77 wrtes Rev. James Kirkman
evangelist of Belle River, 111. "I
have no hesitation in recommend

of throat and lung troubles. For
croup it is unequalled. Absolute

Already the Christmas spirit is
stealing over tbe world, and
thoughts of gift-making lead all
others. With what a diversity of
emotions the Yuletide is welcom
ed. Some think only of tbe gifts
they are to receive; others, less
selfish, think only of tbe ways in
which they may bring happiness
to others, and arounhappy in the
thought that they can do so little.
But to the heart that understands
the true meaning of the Christ
mas-time howon'that Christmas,
long ago, the Shepherds followed
the Star In the East how on that
day a Heaven-born Gift was'sent
toman, and the great" ."unselfish!
love that came with it, to that
heart only is the true spirit of
Christmas sweetly revealed.

It is not always easy to put
away childish things after the
years have lengthened their num
ber roll. It is with the same joy
ous spirit of childhood that we
watch the tumbling, . frolicsome
flakes of snow when first they be
gin to fall; and our first impulse is
to bound away, as when a child,
and press tbem in our eager grasp
into opaque balls and toss them
on in that same spirst of frolic
and fun. But.with a sigh, these
thoughts subside and give place
to those or matnrer years, as we
watch tbe feathery sprays fall in
mystio silence on the waiting earth
below: and we see onlv the soft

seams and scars and rough places,
like tbe great mantle of charity
with which Christ's love covers
