].F good manners are .expected of.chll
"*dren , they must be treated cour
teously. They should be taught that
consideration for others underlies
genuine courtesy. Mere manners may
treacherously desert one at critical mo
ments, but. true politeness may be re
lied upon.
To talk of children in their presence
makes them self-conscious and robs them
of the simplicity that Js their greatest
charm — "klngdom-of-heavenltes," Cole
ridge calls them.
The least shade of impertinence or dis
respect should be checked promptly and
sharply. American parents are not con
sidered good disciplinarians. An English
man once- jestingly remarked, "In the
States parents are sent to bed for 'an
swering back!' "
Children v who are not obliged to be po
lite to their elders and to one another
will not suddenly become well-bred when
strangers are present. They should not
take the mest comfortable seats or most
advantageous ppaltlons, but be observing
and offer such little attentions to their
parents and elders, and the boys to their
plsters.
Such attentions should also be acknowl
edged with courteous appreciation. A
home may have the elegance of high
breeding, no matter how elmple the sur
roundings. Children should not be al
lowed to contradict each other, but be
early taught to use the same courtesy in
expressing differences of opinion as do
their elders— "I beg your pardon" or "I
am sure that you are mistaken." It i.s all
a mutter of habit; but the outward form
often compels the Inward feeling. They
should be made to understand, too, that

fered to their elders is a rudeness that
will make them unpopular. " :
It used to be the custom for children to
say "Yes, ma'am," "Noi sir," to their
elders, but that is now considered to bs
long to the courtesy, due from servants,
and well bred children say, "Yes, mam
ma,", "No, grandpapa," and the tone of
polite deference must underlie the simple
"Yes" and "No" when unaccompanied by
the name of the person addressed.
Well-bred children do, not pass in front
of a person without an apology, or enter
a room whistling, or addressing some one
therein, unobservant of the conversation
that may be in progress.
In the Presence cf Visitors.
Young people should .rise whenever a
visitor comes into or takes leave of the
family circle/ and also if addressed else
where by an older person, should they
happen to be seated.
In France young girls are trained in
winsome, attractive manners. They are
careful to stand aside to permit their eld
ers to pass first. They do not sit while
any one of them Is standing, "and their
polite deference in conversation pays them
a pretty compliment. It was for a French
woman that the word "charming" was
invented.
Children should not be forward in claim
ing the attention of friends or visitors
when they are being greeted by the elder
members of the family, neither should one
hold out a reluctant hand under parental
coercion. Shyness Is only less unattract
ive than forwardness, and is due generally
to ignorance of what is expected of one.
Should a child enter the room where the
mother is entertaining a visitor to ask a
question oc favor he or she should stand
by the mother's side, without speaking,
until addressed by or presented, to the
stranger. Then, after asking permission
to prefer the request, it is made, and the
child withdraws, after taking courteous
leave of the guest.
We all feel that It is humiliating to have
the attention of others directed to our
shortcomings and children are not less
sensitive, but some mothers do not seem
ETIQUETTE
to know that they are breaking all the
laws of good taste in correcting a child
before a guest. It is as annoying to the
visitor as It Is cruel to the child, making
him awkward and self-conscious, if noth
ing •worse. The time is ill-chosen for child
training.- Any possible conflict or clash
of wills between parent and child should
be anticipated in time and the little one
tactfully withdrawn before any 'unseemly
friction becomes apparent to the visitor.
'. "Showing off" children is an unconscious
injustice to them. Let a mother keep to
herself, for private delectation, the knowl
edge that her child is a prodigy/, ■
A Well-Trained Boy^
L»et a boy be as free as air out of doors,
but in the house demand that he behave
like a 'gentleman. In medieval times
lads were, made pages to courtly dames
for such training.
It is not^' however, the province of the
entire family, to bring him up. "Nagging"
Is one of "the small foes to the >peace of
a household, but the teaching of boys to"
be gentlemen at home is as essential 'as
the training of them ' to ' be men in ' the
world. ■'.:.;•. ,:.'' :; ■■. ■'.,. ._.'.<-..••■; ,:.. : .
When: physical ;. strength begins to be
realized by 'a boy. his first idea is touse
it solely as a power. He must be taught
to regard it also as c responsibility. His
strength inclines a truly manly man. to
gentleness toward those who tire weaker.
"Noblesse oblige." A' tactful mother. will
make much, of a lad's strength, appearing
a little dependentupon it. . ■. ■• , -*• ■ < '
A boy accompanying his mother or sis
ters inf the street should be taught to
raise his. hat when they return a bow or
meet a. friend;-' or when '.alone the boy
passes an acquaintance of his own or of
the family, he should show the same cour
tesy, unless in the case of a fellow lad
or a young man, when a bow or , nod
suffices.
The old adage. "Children should be seen
and not heard," has not been supersed
ed by a better, however unpopular with
the present generation. It would spare
mal-apropos r remarks until the child
were old. enough to recognize when to
speak, and when to be silent.'
Boys early learn sportsman's etiquette,
to accept defeat uncomplainingly, to show
no favoritism in playing games, and to
keep one's temper, but girls are some
times offenders in these things.
Unless self-government is taught, pa
rental training- is imperfect.
Imposing Self -Control.
—A look should be sufficient to restrain
a child in public if he or she has been
properly Instructed behind the scenes.
Especially when guests _ are present it is
unseemly for there to be any protest on
the , child's part against the parent's*
■wishes, expressed by word or look.
At air times "No" should be irrevocable
when uttered; but a conscientious review
of the situation should first be made, in
strict Justice to the* little beings who are
so entirely dependent for happiness. A
"teasing" child is merely a victim of bad
management.
A wholesome - self-restraint about an
noying trifles la imposed by good man
ners. Fretting: about the weather or a
disappointment, fussing about what can
not be cured, poisons the atmosphere like
a miasma. •' .
The practice of allowing a sick child to
be as cross, petulant, and exacting as his
humor dictates is an injustice to the child,
who should be taught that under no cir
cumstances may one remit the effort at
self-control. The Injunction should be
pressed with loving firmness, -v.
Children should be early instructed in
behavior at table. No amount of tiub.se:
quent drilling quite atones for early neg
lect.
All corrections should, however, be
made in such a manor as not to attract
the attention of others. At the family
meeting-place nothing should be allowed
to overshadow the general pleasantness.
Kvery-day etiquette includes the custom
of cheerful daily greetings. When a
grunt does duty for a a pleasant "good
morning" and inaudible murmur replaces
a tender "good-night," family manners
need mending. ..'.,■
People should never be criticised ad
versely in the presence of children.
A look should be sufficient to restrain a
child from eating some coveted dainty at
table. If children were made to feel that
their parents denied themselves? a pleas
ure in denying them their wishes, and
that only their best judgment guided by
tenderest love prompted the refusal of
what they would be. far happier to grani,
there would be more trust and less fric
tion between parents and children. "'■•"
In no one thing does the good and bad
training of early life so quickly betray
itself as, in the treatment of those whom
circumstances have placed in dependent
positions. The higher the nature the more
strongly is felt the inarticulate appeal
from the less-favored classes for . justice
and gentleness.
Children should not be thrown in the
society of servants for companionship
more than necessary, but they should be
required to treat them with courteous con
sideration, prefacing every request with
"please," and ready with pleasant thanks
In acknowledgment of anyv service.
Among influences that mold and re
fine the young persons of the household
is the informal and frequent entertain
ment of welcome guests. Those ac
customed to the, presence of visitors have*
more pleasing manners, are more at thelij
ease, and consequently more graceful and
tactful than those who have not this ad
vantage.
Entertaining visitors unifies a family, all
being pledged to the same object, the
gratification of theTJuest.
.Children should be made to feel their
identification with the home. A little fel
low replied to th,e question whether he had
any brothers and sisters, "No, we have
only one child."
Social observance requires no effort if
one' learns it in early youth. A child
should be encouraged to write his or her
own note of thanks for a pleasure offered
or a present received. However, childish
ly expressed, it will probably thank the
giver better than most correct effusions
written by an elder.
- Should a ehild;bf one household have a
quarrel with another, the mothers show a,
petty spirit in adopting it themselves.
The difference should be carefully look
ed into, and the children urged to apolo
gize and "make up." The one who is
most forward to take the initiative has
usually the finer instincts. Should a
mother learn that her child has been
guilty of some grave fault toward an-i,
other, she should call at once with her^
child upon the one who has been injured,/
and make her child apologize, expressing,
her own regret and offering to make any
reparation in her power. She should be
met in a generous and forgiving spirit.
The rule works goth ways.
5 No woman should ever presume to scold
or correct the child of another, rtur should
she be. the one to report its misdeeds.
A' school girl's dress should be plain,
neat and calculated to excite no envy, at
tract no attention. Simplicity Is not only
in good taste, but it is the characteristic
of a little maiden's costume among thoso
•who set a fashion by adopting it. Chil
dren should be as unconscious of their
clothes as birds of their plumage. To
talk of their dress before them is fatal
to that spirit.
When unwise mothers or nurses admire
them, in a particular costume or discuss
its becomingness, the poison begins to
work.
It is wisdom on the part of parents to
. encourage the visits of their children's
friends and make them so welcome that
they may feel at' home. So it may bo
