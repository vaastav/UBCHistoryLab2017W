Recent Presidential Message Con­
tains Paragraph of Interest to
Those Employed in Match Fact­
ories of Zenith City Which Was
Dr. J. B. Andrews representing the
American association for labor leg­
islation conducted an investigation of
match factories in Oshkosh, Wis., and
Duluth about two years ago. Accord­
ing to his investigation, Dr. Andrews
discovered that the use of phosphorus
in the match factories he visited,
had serious effect upon the health
of employees.
His report on the subject has been
printed and has created considerable
comment throughout the country. The
United States government has taken
up the matter and as a result. Presi­
dent Taft in his message to congress
last week made the following recom­
mendations on the subject:
"I invite attention to the very
serious injury caused to all those
who are engaged in the manu­
facture of phosphorus matches.
The diseases incident to this are
frightful, and as matches can be
made from other materials en­
tirely innocuous, I believe that
t-lie injurious manufacture could
be discouraged and ought to be
discouraged by the imposition
of a heavy federal' tax. I re­
commend the adoption of this
method of stamping out a very
serious abuse."
At the convention of the American
Federation of Labor held at St. Louis
in November, the subject of occupa­
tional diseases was considerably dis­
cussed, after which the following res­
olutions were enacted.
WHEREAS, recent investiga­
tions in Europe and America
indicate that the suffering and
economic loss occasioned by oc­
cupational poisons and diseases
can be greatly minimized and
in some ca.-so absolutely elim­
inated through labor legisla­
tion requiring strict regard for
the health of the workers, and
WHEREAS, The American As­
sociation for Labor Legislation
has attacked the problem in a
scientific way, and with a pre­
sentation of facts and figures is
demanding national and state ac­
tion
RESOLVED: That the American
Federation of Labor urges such
investigation of conditions, such
labor legislation, such thorough
factory and mine inspection, such
provision for the health of the
of the workers, such enforcement
of labor laws as shall place
America on a level with the most
progressive of nations and it en­
dorses and commends the Ameri­
can Association of Labor Legis­
lation for the work it is doing
in this direction.

Called Forth By Expert's In­
vestigation.
As a direct result of an investiga­

Taft inserted in his message a re­
commendation that the use of phos­
phorus in the manufacture of that
iliuminant necessity be entirely done
away with.

PITTSBURG. Pa., Dec. 16.—Fran­

heavy fire here from the Pittsburg
Leader and other papers.
hat the reason is for the attacks
is not known.
One of the latest accusations is that
of a Cokeburg miner, William Blot
nek, whose name appears on an affi­
davit charging Feehan with having
been a non-union man and a strike­
breaker in his early days, and the
leader of more unsuccessful strikes
than any other local labor leader.
Blotnek swears that he was ap­
proached by a Feehan man near the
Marianna mines of the company man­
aged by David G. Jones, Feehan's
brother-in-law, who offered him a
position at the plant. He declares
that the negotiations that followed
proved that a man who wanted any
kind of a job at the Jones mines had
to receive the indorsement of Fee­
han.
He also alleges that another Fee­
han man approached him and offered
him a job as district organizer if he
would go out and work for the re­
election of Feehan. He refused be­
cause, he says, Feehan was a non­
union, man and strikebreaker before
"flopping" to the union ranks in or­
der to hold office in the United Mine
Workers at the request of John
.Mitchell.
Feehan is putting up a fight. He
has made a vigorous denial of the
various charges against him and de­
clares they have grown out of a con­
spiracy to get him out of office at
any cost.

LIBOR OPENS EIGHT
ON TUFT-MOON Bill.
BIG INTERESTS' PET
WASHINGTON. D. C., Dec. 16.—
The first authoriative clash between
the administration forces and the la­
bor members of the house of repre­
sentatives over the notorious Moon
injunction bill, the bill which Pres­
ident Taft has programmed to pass
through congress and President
Gompers has denounced as a most
dangerous underhand blow at labor,
occurred when Representative Wil­
son of the United Mine Workers
sought to bring his anti-injunction
bill, H. R. 2 5188, before, the house
as an amendment to a motion by
representative Moon.
In the speaker's chair was Olm
stead, a ready-to-serve Cannon man,
who promptly ruled Wilson's motion
out of order.
"I expected nothing less," said
Wilson, "and shall renew the .fight on
calendar Wednesday when the rul­
ings of the chair cannot block de­
bate on the floor of the house."
Wilson's 'bilr ts not-only /an anti
injunction measure, but it also pro­
poses the exemption of labor organ­
izations from the Sherman anti-trust
act, as stated in the following
language:
"In cases arising in the courts of
the United States, or coming before
said courts, or before any judge or
the judges thereof, no agreement
between two or more persons con­
cerning the terms or conditions of
employment, or the assumption or
creation or termination of any rela­
tion between employer and em­
ploye, or concerning any act or
thing to be done or not to be done
with reference to or involving or
growing out of a labor dispute, shall
constitute a conspiracy or other
civil or crmiinal offense, or be pun­
ished or prosecuted, or damages Re­
covered ,upon as such, unless the act
or thing agreed to be done or not to
be done would be unlawful if done
by a single individual nor shall the
entering into or the carrying out of
any such agreement be restrained or
enjoined unless such act or thing
agreed to be done would be subject
to be restrained or enjoined under
the provisions, limitations, and defini­
tions contained in the first section of
this act."
Armed with these two legal blud­
geons, the Moon measure, which Taft
has pledged the manufacturers he
will make law, and the Sherman anti­
trust act, which has been twisted by
the judiciary into power to dissolve
a labor organization whenever they
so desire, the National Association of
Manufacturers is preparing to block
all future attempts of wage workers
to obtain a closed shop. The cloak
makers' strike that won this goal in
New York and the garment workers
that are now struggling foi* it in Chi­
cago have given the manufacturers,
who make their millions from the
hunger-pangs of women and children
forced to work or starve, a mighty
shock. These millionairies have
called upon Taft for relief and he has
promised them aid.
GOV OFFERS BIG BONUS
TO MACHINISTS TO SCAB
NEW ORLEANS. La., Dec. 16.—•
That the United States government
is alarmed over labor conditions in
the Panama Canal zone, the result of
a strike among the bollermakers and
machinists is amply shown by
the arrival here of agents from the
Isthmus, who are offering high wag­
es for American boiler makers to fill
vacancies.
Boilers makers are offered 70 cents
an hour and free passage to Panama,
their wages to begin the day the ship
transporting them sails ifrom this
port. It is expected that the canal
strike will extend to other crafts.

Workers' Interests is Mapped
Out at Convention of District
Representatives of State Unions
Held at Minneapolis Sunday
Last.
The executive council of the Min­
nesota State Federation of Labor held
its regular meeting in Minneapolis
last Sunday. Every member of the
council was present except Vice
President George W. Pippy of Brain
erd. A large number of visitors at­
tended, and among them were some
of the most prominent men in the
labor movement of Minnesota.
The reports of the officers from the
Ninth congressional district of Min­
nesota including those of President
Howley and Secretary-Treasurer Mc
Ewen were full of interest.
President Howley made an oral re­
port.and told of his work during the
past three months. He said he was
unable to actively engage in organ­
ization work because of other duties
imposed upon him. H£ said that he
sent in his place, to northern Minne­
sota, for organization work, John
Chubbuck of Minneapolis, who did
some splendid work in Crookston. He
related an interview had with a con­
tractor from Winona who was having
some difficulty with certain unions
there. Mr. Howley attended the con­
vention of the American Federation
of Labor at St. Louis, representing
the Minneapolis Trades aftd Labor
council.
Vice President N. A. Krueger also
reported orally, as he was unable to
make a written report because of
sickness in his family. He complained
that the members of unions in Wi­
nona were not attending meetings
very well. He made request for an
organizer for a period of from four
to six weeks as they needed one very
badly down at Winona. Mr. Krueger
requested the council to authorize
President Howley to visit Winona for
two or three days for the purpose of
adjusting some existing trouble in the
building trades. He further stated
that the services of an organizer
would not be required until later in
the season. The. movement as a whole
was in fairly good condition in the

Vice Presidents Joseph Maiden and
F. E. Hoffmann of the Fourth con­
gressional district reported that the
unions in St. Paul were in a very
healthy condition. They referred to
their efforts on behalf of the bakers'
union in selling stock for the organ­
ization of a co-operative bakery.
Vice Presidents Hall and Hoffman
of the Fifth congressional district re­
ported that the labor movement in
Minneapolis was in a fair condition.
Mr. Hall related his experience in vis­
iting among the unions in the interest
of the federation. He also told of his
efforts on the state fair committee
and asked for the co-operation of the
unions in attempting to secure an ap­
propriation from the legislature for
the construction of a permanent
building for labor on the State Fair
grounds.
Want Label on Fair Grounds.
At this point, S. J. Spencer of the
Minneapolis Painters' union was
granted the floor. and stated that his
organization would not make another
exhibit until something was done to
Induce the state fair management to
employ 'more members of organized
labor in the repair and construction
of buildings on the fair grounds.
President Howley assured Mr. Spen­
cer that he would use his influence
with Secretary. Cosgrove to meet the
demands of the painters' union.
Vice President L. R. Porter of St.
Cloud, representing in part the Sixth
congressional district, stated that the
granite cutters' union of St. Cloud
was vitally interested in having the
new postoffice building at Minneapo-
He also said that the movement was
in fairly good condition in St. Cloud,
and prospects were bright for the
strengthening of the movement there.
McDonald Makes Report.
Vice President S. S. McDonald of
Duluth, wlio represents the Eighth
congressional district ojj the execu­
tive council, made an oral report. He
said that the unions were quiet in
Duluth. that many men were out of
work however, he said, some of the
trades were very active outside of the
building line. An organizer is wanted
very badly to enliven the movement
in Duluth. Several unions do not af­
filiate with the Trades and Labor- as­
sembly. An active campaign is be­
ing waged urging them to get in line.
If. an organizer can be obtained the
local trades assembly will do all in

Mr. Cheadle was very friendly to

bors given proper credit for their

ical campaign.
Fargo Unions Gain Ground.
Vice President Frazer of the Ninth
congressional district, who also rep­
resents a portion of the unions in
North Dakota, stated that the unions
of Fargo were able to keep in line,'
but that the movement in the interior
of North Dakota was in very poor
condition.. Some of the unions, in
Fargo have been gaining ground
steadily. The carpenters now have a
membership of 200. The painters'
union which had eight members one
year ago, now enjoys a membership
of 75. The carpenters of Fargo had
raised their initiation fee to keep out
inferior workmen.
An effort was being made to or­
ganize the laundry workers and the
sheet metal workers. The latter are
particularly desirous of an organiza­
tion because many of them, when
doing work in the country, are obliged
to labor from 12 to 14 hours a day.

various pther advantages made dri­

when 400 of them returned to work
this week following a sharp conflict
with their employers.
In addition to the Christmas pres­

also won the promise of their em­
ployers that conferences to frame a
new wage scale shall be held after
the new year.
With every indication that the
strike of 40,000 Chicago garment
workers for better shop conditions
and recognization of the union will
develop into an all-winter fight, the
Chicago unions today started to get
financial ammunition to oppose the

Every union man in Chicago, if
plans formed bear fruit will contri­
bute 25 cents a week to the- sup
pott of the strikers. This general'
assessment will be in addition to se­
parate funds already being contri­
buted by individual unions.
Union leaders assert that 25,000 of
the 40,000 out are .getting their only
food from the commissary sftories,
their resources having been entirely
exhausted by the ten weeks' war. Of
these, 5,000 families they say, would
actually starve if they were not given
daily aid, and 500 families are in
hourly fear of eviction for unpaid
rent.
ELIOT DISTRIBUTES LEFT
HANDED COMPLIMENTS TO
MILWAUKEE GOVERNMENT.
MILWAUKEE, Dec. 16.—That col­

national government, is necessary to
solve the problems of monopoly,
which face the United States, was
declared by Dr.- -Charles W. Eliot, of
Harvard university at the luuncheon
given by the City club yesterday and
attended by some 150 citizens of Mil­
waukee.
Introduced by Rev. Frederick Ed­
wards as one of the great natural
resources of the country, Dr. Eliot
paid his- respects to the city admin­
istration, declaring that he had visited
a number of the city officials and
was much impressed with the admin­
istration's "vigor, earnestness and
high purposes."
Here are some of his views:
"You have here in Milwaukee a
fine example of collectivism.
"The distribution of property in
this country is, so vast that Socialism,
the real doctrine, can never get any­
where when it is known.
"The long ballot was the source of,
the power of the bosses. The short
ballot is the only means by which the
people can get back the power which
has been taken from them.
"At the bottom, the end in view
in all your occupations is first, do­
mestic joy and then the welfare Of
mankind."

"John T. Janssen, chief of police:"
"Complaints have been ihade hier#
that disemployed citizens have been
subjected to abusive epithets and
rough handling by policemen.
Whatever may be the basis of these
complaints, I want it understood that
no man on the police force has the
right to interfere with a citizen who
is not violating the law.
"I expect you, as chief of police,
to make it clear to the members of
your department that so long as a
citizen is within his legal rights he
should not be manhandled or in­
sulted.
"Officers tolerating such tactics and
patrolmen practicing them will be
held accountable.

by the mayor. --Milwaukee's wage
workers are correspondingly rejoiced
over the outlook and are comparing
their situation with that of the
