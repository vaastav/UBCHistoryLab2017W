Calls In Leaders.
Harding stated today the special
session of congress will be convened
some time in March so that its work
can be cleaned up early in the summer
if possible. The call will be issued
by him shortly after the inauguration.
A special session of the senate imme
jdiately after inauguration is necessary
for confirmation of cabinet appoint
ments but the call for this probably
will be issued, according to the cus
tom, by the retiring president.
Harding's desire is to avoid further
speeches before March 4. It is possi
ble, however, that one or two invita
tions may be accepted.
Harding's brief but triumphal visit
to Washington left his friends tre
mendously pleased. The president
elect was gratified at the reception
given him and the cordiality shown.
His formal call at the White House,
where he left his card, removed from
his visit to the capitol any suuspicion
of discourtesy toward President Wil
son, friends said.

ADMITS HE IS SPY
Army Captain Confesses Ger
man War Plot When Captured.
Says 300 Germans Enlisted in
the United States Forces-
New York, Dee. 8. Hans Willet,
alias Cap. John Williams, commander
of Company I, Forty-eighth United
States infantry, during the war, was
held in Castle William, Governor's Is
land today awaiting action by army
officials on a confession he is alleged
to nave made to police detectives here
yesterday that he was a German spy.
Altho he had been sought as a de
serter, alleged to have absconded soon
after the armistice with $6,000 in
company funds, his confession of
espionage came as a complete sur
prise. Hugh J. Hannigan, a former lieu
tenant under his command, on whose
identification Willet was arrested, said
not a man under the captain's com
mana naa ever suspected he was a
German sympathizer. Willet said, ac
cording; to the detectives, that he was
one of the 300 cadets who liad trained
In Germany and were sent to this
country to enlist In the United States
army. The scheme, he is alleged to
have said, was for the cadets to lead
units of soldiers to France and expose
tnem in dangerous positions for
slaughter.
Willet protested vigorously at first
that he was not the man sought for
desertion, but after two other former
wnitcia ul ma uuiiiyuny corroDor&ieu
Hannigan's identification, he sunk
down in a chair and murmured.
"You've got me!'" A few minutes
later he became calm and deliberate
and said: "I have nothing to regret.
It Is Just the fortunes of war. Luck
was against me and I'll have to pay."
His wife, who was- formerly a Miss
Crawford of Chicago, called at the
police station early today after having
heard of her husband's arrest and
asked the police for his keys and his
money. When told Willet had been
taken to Govbernor's Island, she said
she would go to see him later. .They
have lived for more than a year on
Riverside Drive, she said.

Nephew Who Sold Name
To Clara Smith Vanishes
Wife in San Francisco Declares Mystery Woman Even
Received Mail as Mrs. Hamon Nephew Paid $100
Per Month as Reward and Mrs.' Jake Hamon
Paid to Stay in Chicago. . .,
San Francisco, Dec. 8. An Inter-1
view with Ruth Walker Hamon said
to be the wife of Frank Louis Hamon,
former husband of Clara Smith Ha
mon, sought in connection with the
death of Jak- I Hamon, millionaire
oil operator and Republican national
committeeman of Oklahoma, was
published by the San Francisco Ex
aminer this morning.
The interview, dated at Sacramento,
Calif., quotes Mrs. Hamon as saying
her husband "at the behest of Jake
Ii. Hamon," married Clara Barton
Smith and in return was given $100 a
month from that time '-y the oil oper
ator. Frank IV Hamon and Clara
Barton- Smith, according to the pub
lished Interview, were divorced at
Weatherford, Tex., May 23, 1917, and
never had lived together.
Mrs. Jake Hamon Paid Also.
The Interview further alleged that
Mrs. J. I Hamon, widow of the mil
lionaire, was paid $1,000 a month to
live in Chicago by her husband. '
Frank Hamon, according to the in
terview, "disappeared five weeks be
fore the death of his uncle, after hav
ing declared he was going to aee the
(Tiii j
nave it out "witn
him." The Examiner, quoting Sirs.
Hamon, said In part:
" 'I married Frank Hamon In Tuc
son, Ariz., August 14, 1918. He was
a fireman on the railroad. After six
months' courtship I became his wife.
" 'A few .months after our wedding
he told me he had been married be
fore. His first wife, he said, ras
Clara Barton Smltl and he declared
that she was now living with his un
cle, Jake Hamon. He assured me that
he never lived with her himself and
that he had secured a divorce in
Weatherford, Tex., May 23, 1917.
Paid $100 Per Month for Name.
"At first Frank tried to make me
believe he had married this woman
while under the influence of liquor. I
doubted this as he never drank while
he was with me. Later I perceived
that he was getting a check from; his
uncle for one hundred dollars tevery
month, and I wanted to know' why.
It was therr-that he admitted that he
had married the Smith girl merely as
a convenience to his 'Uncle so tha't she
might bear the -cme of Hamon and
live with the oil man without arousing
public suspicion. The monthly check,
he confessed, was his reward for this
accommodation.

after be learned that Mrs. Jake Hamon
was getting $1,000 for the support of
herself and her children in return for
her tacit connivance in Jake's dual life.
" 'As for Clara Hamon, she was
angry, I know because Jake Hamon
had neglected her while his wife was
In Ardmore last summer. About tnis
time she came to Tucson and visited
us for a short while. She was a very
pretty woman. She showed plainly
that she was dissatisfied with her life.
On one occasion she showed me an
automatic pistol which she carried in
her grip and told me she had always
kept it with her for protection.
Got Mail ag Mrs. Hamon.
" 'While we were in Tucson Frank's
mother, Mrs, Bessie Hamon, lived at
our home several months. I loved her
as my own mother, but she appeared
to resent my having married Frank.
" 'Prior to coming to live with us,
Frank's mother had visited Jake Ha
mon and Clara Smith Hamon in Okla
homa City. In talking to me about
her sojourn there she declared that
Jake wanted her to remain with them
as housekeeper.
" 'In August, 1919, my husband went
to Ardmore and Jake Hamon gave him
a job in the oil fields. He wrote to
me to come out and join him, but
when Jake heard that I was coming he
told him, so Frank says, to clear out
and never come herewith that woman.
Later Frank told me that Clara Smith
was rectlving mail under my name and
was using it generally to avoid sus
picion, and that a second Mrs. Frank
Louis Hamon in the community might
cause as. lot of trouble.
Nephew Now Disappeared.
" 'Shortly after my. husband came
back from Ardmore his mother bought
the St. Elmo' ranch, a few miles from
Vacaville, and 1 came here to live with
Frank's ; brother Raymond and his
wife.
"Frank came to me one day early
In October and told me he was going
away to marry a very rich woman and
he wished 1 would 'find somebody

" 'The very rich woman was Clara,
I learned. He disappeared then and
the next thing I heard was that Jake
had been muurdered and Clara had
disappeared. Frank is still missing.' "

Athens, Dec. 8. Notification re
garding the result of the plebiscite
held in Greece last Sunday will pro
bably be sent to former King Con
stantine at Lucerne, Switzerland, to
day, according to a statement by
Minister of War Gounarls.
"Yes, he will come," he declared
when asked if Constantine would re
turn to Greece. "We probably will
notify him on Wednesday."
When the Earl of Granville, the
British minister here, visited Premier
Rhallis early this week to hand, him
the latest British communication, the
latter smiled and exclaimed:
"What, you have come with a new
note? 1 have not answered the other
two yet."
The cabinet is spending much time
in conferences at which are discussed
the financial situation and the possi
bilities opened up by the return of
Constantine.
Trading on the bourse was unsteady
yesterday, the dollar being quoted at
12)4 drachmas. Latest returns from
the plebiscite show but scattering
votes against Constantine, generally
one or two to a district.

PAY LITTLE HEED
President's Message Makes
Slight Dent on Congress.
Agree Reconstruction Seeded at
Once Disagree on Method.
Washington, Dee. 8. President Wil
son's recommendations to congress are
to be dismissed with scant attention by
Republican leaders, they made plain
today in informal discussion of the
message read to the two houses yes
terday. The Republicans said, in effect, that
while they agree with Wilson that the
reconstruction job should be tackled
and finished as soon as possible, there
is no hope of agreeing with him as to
the methods to be followed.
One exception was noted in the gen'
eral rejection of the president's request
for immediate action. This was the
budget bill, which is scheduled to pass
the senate soon and go to Wilson.
Tax revision will be deferred. There
is a strong feeling that something
should be done for the disabled sol
diers and sailors, but that, too, will
have to wait, according to the present
plans. Governmental economy cannot
be brought about fully until govern
mental reorganization is accomplished
under the next administration, leaders
maintained. The recommendation for
a loan to Armenia was scouted on all
sides. There is a wide variance of
opinion regarding Philippine inde
r,Andence. .
Th ,wa Wilson has twice asked to
regulate cold storage again will fail
to pass, it was declared. His proposal
to license all concerns doing an Inter
state business was labelled as "social
istic" or "paternalistic."

to $1.70 were succeeded by breaks to well
below yesterday's finish.
Later the market rallied owtng largely
to removal of hedges on one mlllian bushels
of Canadian wheat taken by the British
Roval commission. Besides. Italy was said
to have bought 230.000 bushels of Durum.
The market elosed unsettled. c to lWc net
lower, with December $1.69 and March
$1. to $1.67.
CORN In corn as well as wheat there
was persistent eastern selling. After open
ing nnehanged to c higher, including May
at 7o to 774c. underwent a general sag.
OATS Oats were governed chiefly by
the action of other grain, starting He off
