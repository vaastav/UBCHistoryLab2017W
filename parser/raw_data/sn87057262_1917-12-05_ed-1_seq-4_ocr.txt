TODAY'S BIT OF VERSE
ITALY.
Hum art Weeding, Italy!
Rubies burn thy belting sea,
Dripping nsbiee from thy breast
And afar we pale, and start
As ira first had felt a blow,
Though a thousand scars we bear.
Little of oar world we know.
Little of her ways can read
Lies her head we know not where
Or her shifting hands and feet
But her heart we know is set
(Like a song within a deed.
Like a jewel all may see.
Like a glory all may wear)
Golden warm in Italy
And, there wounded, we most bleed.
Thou art bleeding, Italy!
Hot the tears that blind us we
See no sin of all thy sins.
All we know is in our veins—
All we know is, thou do6t call
That thou In the darkness strove,
„Aad the spear is in thy side.
1
All we know is that we lore,
And the blows that on thee fall
JFYQ1 as Mows upon a bride,
Italy!
—Olive Tilford Dargan, in New York Times.
Let us never forget that an act of good
ness is of itself an act of happiness. No re
ward coming after the event can compare
with the sweet reward that went with it~—

A WASHING AND SOME ADVICE.
warning to the people of this community, for
this is the season when the mail order houses
are busiest. They have flooded the country
with their catalogues, and will reap a harvest
in proportion. Vast amounts of money are
sent away during the holiday season for pur
chases that could be as satisfactorily, and far
more profitably, made at home. Purchases made
through the drawing power of mail order
catalogues are on a cash basis, and no part of
this cash will ever return for circulation in the
community from which it is sent.
The catalogue buyer is attracted largely by
his curiosity to see what he will get for his
money. Ic is owing to this instinct that the
mail order house flourishes. The first invest-j

AUSTRIA IS OUR FOE.
The president's message to the second ses
sion of the sixty-fifth congress meets the needs
of the occasion. It is folly for this country to
persist in non-recognition of a state of war as
sumed as a fact by Austria-Hungary even as
Germany assume.I that fact by acts committed
before this country took cognizance.
Austria-Hungary is Germany's, vassal, says
Mr. Wilson. The dual monarchy is as much re
sponsible for frightfulness as the empire which
she serves. While we have joined with the oth
er civilized powers in a great struggle to free
humanity from vassalage, let us go the limit and
kill the snake from head to taiL
ALARM IN SWITZERLAND.
Germany is circulating the story that France
land England have asked Switerzland for per
I mission to move forces through that country
for the relief of Italy. The story is false, as
Switzerland is prompt to explain, but the little
republic is greatly concerned for fear that Ger
many intends to violate her neutrality. When
Germany has a crime in contemplation she
usually begins by charging that her enemies
have done the same thing, or intend to. It was
thus, as will be remembered, that she sought to
justify her invasion of Belgium.
Germany's course in the past leaves no room
to doubt that she will march her troops through
or into Switzerland or Holland or any other
neutral if she considers it expedient to do
so. No scruples or considerations of right and
wrong would restrain her. The nations named
jknow this and that their only safety lies in
their ability to make the invasion cost their
conscienceless neighbor more than he can af
ford to pay. The fate of Belgium warns them
what they may expect if the Hun gets into

The Swiss are known to be valorous. Fight
ing in their own mountains it is believed that
they would be able to repel or destroy a half
'million invaders and the Germans, who are
sending boys of sixteen and seventeen years to
the front, may feel that they have no troops to
spare to met new enemies now and hesitate to
ta^e that road to Italy.

IOWA PRESS COMMENT.
Cedar Rapids Republican: "The
price of sugar in New York, from
Cuba has been fixed at 84.90 per
hundred—now we shall see II those
who handle it en route to the con
sumer will add aa much as the grow
era of the cane and the manufac
turers of the sugar combined get out
of it. There is no reason why such
costs should be added. In the past
such things as sugars have been
handled by too many persons, each
adding his bit in the way of a com
mission. The elimination of the toll
takers en route will be a Godsend
to the ultimate ones, the ultimate
ones at both ends.
Daren port Democrat: Germany
probably feels more tickled over the
lives that went out with the sinking
of the Actaeon than she does over
the destruction of the boat itself, as
it happened to be one of the Ger
man ships that we had appropriated
for the duration of the war.
Marshalltown Times-Republican:

Cossack who has been used as an

Des Moines Register: Even the

told that it is knitting nicely.
Cedar Rapids Gazette: It is feared
that the Russians have gained an
eironeous idea from reading of In
dependent school districts in the
United States.
Sioux City Journal: Regardless of
whether General Allenby rides into
