RECONSTRUCTION.
springing from a rebellion of gigantic
magnitude, aided, as it wan, by tbe sympathy
and assistance of nations with which we
were at pcaoe, eleven states of tbe Union
were, four years ago, left without legal state
government. A debt bad been contracted
American commerce was almost driven from
the seas. The industry of half of the coun
try had been taken from the control of the
capitalist, and placed where all labor right
fully belongs in tbe keeping ot the laborer,
J be work of restoring state governments
loyal to the Union, of protecting and foster
ing free labor and droviding means for pay
iug the interest oo tbe public debt, has re
ceived ample attention from Congress,
although your enorts have not met with tbe
success in all particulars that might have
been desired, though on the whole they
have been more successful than could have
been reasonably anticipated. The states
which passed the ordinance of secession
bave been fully restored to their plaoia in
tbe Union.

On tbe 8th ult. Georgia held an election
at which she ratified her Constitution, re

all other officers required. The Governor
was duly installed, and the Legislature met
and pertoimed all the acts required of them
by tbe reconstruction laws ot Congress.
Subsequently, however, in violation of the
Constitution which they had just ratihed, as
since decided by tbe Supreme Court of the
State, they unseated the colored members of
the Legislature and admitted to eeats some
members who are disqualified by the 3d
clause of the 14th amendment to the Con
stitution of the United States, an article
which they themselves Lad contribnted to
rutifv. Under these circumstances, I would
ubmit to you whether it would not bo wise,
without delay, to enact a law authorizing
the Governor of Georgia to convpne the
members originally elected to the Legisla

outb prescribed by the reconstruction laws,
and none to be admitted who are ineligible

FINANCIAL ANIl COMMERCIAL.
The mean provided for paying the in
terest on the public debt, with all other ex
penses of tha government, are more than
mple. J be loss of our commerce is the
only result of the late rebellion which has
not received sufficient attention from you.
To this subject I call your earnest attention.
I will not now suggest plans by which this
object may be effected, but will, if necess
ary, make it the subject of a special message
during the session ot Congress.
SOCTHERX ELECTION'S.
At the March term, Congress, by joint
resolution, authorized the executive to order
elections in the states of Virginia, Missis
sippi, and Texas, submitting constitutions
hich had previously in conventions been
framed, each constitution either entire or in
separate parts to be voted upon at the dis
oretion of tbe executive. Under this au
thority elections were called. In Virginia
the election took piace ou the Cth of July.
lbC'J. The Governor aud Lieutenant Gov
eruor elected bave been installed, the Levis
ture met aud did all required by thi resoln-
tion aud by all tbe reconstruction acts of
Congress, and abstained from all doubtful
authority. I recommend that her Senators
and Representatives be admitted and that
the state be fully restored to its place in the
family of stales. Elections were called in
Mississippi and Texas to commence on the
30th of November, 1869, and to last two
days in Mississippi and four days in Texas.
The elections have taken place but tbe re
suit is not known.
It is to be hoped that the act of the leg
islatures of these states when they meet will
be such as to receive your approbation, and
thus close the work of reconstruction.
THB CtRREKCY.
Among the evils growing out of tbe re
bellion i that of an irredeemable currency.
It i an evil which I hope will receive your
moat earnest attention. It is a duty, and
one of the highest duties of the Government,
to secure to the citizens a medium of ex
change of fixed and unvarying value. Thi
implies it return to a specie basis, and no
substitute for it can be devised. It shoold
be commenced now, and reached at tbe
earliest possible moment, consistent with a
fair regard for tbe interest of the debtor

I ho subject ot tariff and internal taxa
tion will necessarily receive your attention.
The revenue of the country greatly exceeds
tbe requirements, and may, with propriety,
be reduced, lint as landing tbe debt in
4 and 4 j per cent, loan would reduce the
annual current expenses largely, aud thus
after funding, justify a greater reduction of
taxation than would be now expedient, I
suggest the postponement ot this question
until the next meeting ot Congress. It may
be advisable to modify taxation and tariff
in instances where nnjtist or burdensome
discriminations are made by the present
laws, but a general revision ot law regard
ing this subject, I recommend be postponed
for tho present. I also suggest the renewal
of the tax ou incomes, but at a reduced rate
of 3 percent, and this tax to expire in three
years with the funding ot the national debt
as here suggested. 1 feel safe in saying the
taxes on revenue from imports may be re
duced safely from fCO.OOO.OOO to $80,000,-
000 per annum at once, and still further re
duced from year to rear, a.H Ihe resources of
the country are developed.
THE TREASURY.
The report of the Secretary of the Treas
ury shows the receipts of tbe Government
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1M;9 to
bef 370.y43,748;other expenses.including in
terest to be ( Si l,4'J3,5ltV. The estimates for
the ensuing year are more favorable to the
Government, and will no doubt show a larva
decrease of tbe public debt. The receipts in
tbe lreasury beyond expenditures have ex
ceeded the amount necessary to place to the
credit of tbe sinking fund, as provided by
aw J o take up the surplus in the Treas
ury and withhold it from circulation would
lead to such contraction of tho currency as
to cripple trade and seriously effect the pros
perity of the conntry. Under these circura.
tunces, tbe Secretary of tbe Ireasurv and
myself heartily concurred in the propriety of
using tbe surplus currency in lreasury in
the purchase of Government bonds, thus
reducing the interest bearing debt of the
country, and of submitting to Congress the
question of the disposition to be made of the
bonds so purchased. Ihe bonds now held
by the Treasury amount to about $75,000,.
000, including those belonging to the sink
ing fund. I recommend that they be placed
to the credit of the sinking fund.
lour attention is respectfully invited to
the recommendation of the Secretary of the
reasury for tha creating of the ofliee of
Commissioner of Custom Revenues, for the
increase of salary to certain classes of offic
ers and the subtttltutiou of increased Na
tional bond circulation to replace the out
standing 33 per cent certificates, and more
especially to the recommendation for the
repeal of laws allowing shares ot fines, pen
alties, forfeitures, &c, to officers of the Gov
ernment, or to informers.
The office of Interna! Revenue is one of
the most arduous and responsible under the
Government. It falls but little, if any, short
of a cabinet position in its importance and
responsibility. I would ask for it therefore
such legislation as in your judgment will
place tbe office on a footing of dignity com
mensurate with its importance, and the quel
ili cations of such a class of men required to
fill it properly.
CIBA.
As the United States is the freest of all
nations, so do the people sympathize with all
people struggling for liberty aud free govern
ment. But while we sympahthize it is due
to our honor that we should abstain fro n
enforcing our views npon unwilling nations,
and from taking an interested part without
invitation in the quarrel between different
nations, or between governments and their
subjects. Our course should always be in
conformity with strict justice and law, inter
national and local. Such has been the policy
of the administration in dealing "with these
quesiiont. For more than a year a valuable
province of Spain, and a near neighbor of
ours, in whom people cannot bat feel a deep
interest, has been struggling for indepen
dence and freedom. The people
and government of the United
States entertain the same feeling and
sympathy for the people of Cnba in their
pending struggle that they manifested
throughout tbe preaions struggle between
Spain and her former colonies in behalf of
th latter. But the contest at no tirae a

THK ALABAMA TREATY.
Towards the close of the last admiuistra
tion, a convention was signed at London for
tbe settlement ot outstanding claims bo
tween Great Britain and tho United States,
which failed to reoeire the advice and con
sent ot the Senate to its ratification. The
time and circumstances attending the nego
tiation of the treaty were favorable to its
acceptance by the people of the United
States, but its provisions were wholly inad
equate for the settlement ol tbe grave
wrongs that had been sustained by this
government as well ha by its citizens. The
injuries resulting to the United States by
reason of the course adopted by Great 1 i r it
ain during our late civil war in the dimiuu
tion of exports and imports, the obstruction
to domestic industry aud the prostration of
our foreign commerce, the decreaso and
transfer to Great Britaiu of our commercial
marine, the prolongation of tbe war and
tbe increased cost both in treasure and in
lives of its suppression could not bo adjust
cd and satisfied as ordinary commercial
claims which continually arise between com
mercial nations, and yet the convention
treated them simply as such ordinary
claims, from which they differ more widely
in the gravity of their character than In the
magnitude of their amount. Great ever as
is that difference, not a word was found in
the treaty, and not an inference could be
drawn for it to remove the sense of the un
friendly course of Great IJ.itniu in our
struggle for national existence which had so
deeoly and universally impressed itnell up
on the people of this country. Concluding
that a convention thus misconstrued in its
scope and provisions would not havo pro
duced the hearty and cordial settlement ot
pending questions which alone is consistent
witb tbe relations which I desire to have es-
toblished between the United State.-i nnd
(ireat Britain, 1 regard the action of the
Senate, rejecting the treaty, to have been
ise.ly taken in the interests of peace and
as a necessary step in tha direction of a
cordial friendship between the two countries

The extension of railroads in Kurope and
the Kaat, is bringing into competition with
our agricultnral products like product.-
Self preservation therefore dictates caution
against disturbing any industrial interests
of the country. It teaches us also the ne
cessity of looking to other markets for the
sale of our surplus. Our neighbors south
of ua and China and Japan should receive
our special attention.
RKCirKOClTV.
The question of a treaty for reciprocity
between the United States aud tbe British
provinces on this continent haa not beeu fa
vorably considered by the administration.
Ihe advantage of such a treaty wiuld bo
wholly in favor ot the British producer, ex
cept, possibly, a few engaged in the trade
between tho two countries. No citizen of
the United States would be benefitted by re
ciprocity. Our internal taxation would
prove a protection to the British producer
almost equal to tho protection which our
manufacturers now receive from the tariff.

ot the operations of the postal service and
of the financial oondition of this part of the
public service. The ordinary postage re
turns for the year ending June 30,' I HUH,
amount to $l8,3!lt,5IO, and tho expendi
tures to $23,0811,131 showing an excess of
expenditures over receipts of $5,:;j3,i20.
The excess of expenditures over receipts
for the previous year amounted to $0,137,
002. I call your attention to the recom
mendations of the Postmaster General, and
most especially to his recommendation for
the total abolition of the franking privilege,
tha abuse of which is immeasurable, and
which reduces the receipts of the postal
service from 2 j to 30 per cent., and largely
increases the service to he performed.
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
The report ot the Secretary of the Interior
the naval expenses make but a small part
of the National appropriation, and the true
weulth ot the country will not be increased
by neglecting the means of national safety
and honor. Tho report also recommends
the sale ol a large number of costly vessels
aud a large amount of expensive machinery
on hand and uuadapted to uavul service
that inducements be held out to our mer'
chanls aud ship builders to build
ocean steamers on plans approved by the
Navy Department, subject, in case of neces
sity, to be taken by the Government at an
appraised value. Ihe Secretary recom
mends tbe r. provement of the Navr Yards
and the building of more dry docks ; tha
paanage ui a tnngeni law ior the protection
ot timber lands; the adoption of measures
for the increase of the personnel of the navy,
including the training of boy, eduoation of
men for warrant and petty officers and tbe
rrgistration of all seamen in the United
States. I he estimate of the next year are
made on the basis of twelve thousand men,
an increase of four thousand, whioh it is
hoped will be approved. Actual expendi
tures for the year ending December 1st, was
twenty millions, eighty-one thousand two
hundred and eighty five dollars. The esti
mates for the fiscal year ending June, 1871,
are twenty-eight millions, two hundred and
five thousand, six hundred and seventy-one
dollar

fleet, fourteen vessels, 120 guns, including
the frigate Guerriere now refitting at New
Vork; Kuropean squadron, six vessels, 100
guns; Asiatic squadron, ten vessels, 72
guns. The ceiurunnder of the North At
lantio squadron has been directed, while
preserving strict neutrality between the con
tending Cuba, to permit no injuatice to citi
zens of the United States, aud to prevent
any interference with our commerce, and to
repel and punish any disrespect or violation
of our flag. The other squadrons all need
reinforcement, and the action of Congress
is invoked for means largely adding to their
efficiency which the service needs, says tbe
Secretary, and the position of our country re
quires a great increase in the effective force
of the navy, not so much in ships that con
stitute it, but in the number and character ot
those employed. He recognizes tbe neoessitv
for dote economy in expenditure onder th
