THK year 1899 will go down as a record one in indus
trial history, especially as relates to substantial and
widespread advances in wages, and a general in
crease and activity in employment.
THF, time has passed for the people of the United
States to discuss the question of what is to lie done
with the Philippines. We drove out the Spaniards
who had been the governing power nearly four
hundred years. For us to withdraw would leave a condition
of anarachy, and foreigners who own property in the country
would have certainly a strong moral claim against the United
States for their losses. Americans will find this an excellent
field for their energies and the wealth-producing powers of
these islands under American influence will be great.”—Let
ter from General Joe Wheeler in the Philippines.
WHERE SHOULD THE YOUNG MAN CO?
EVER since Horace Greely gazed upon the virgin plains
and beheld the star of empire and called upon the
young men of the East to give up home lies and
positions and take themselves toward the selling sun,
his famous phrase has been sadly overworked. Hundreds of
thousands did go Weet, and civilization has no parallel for
the miracles they wrought. But in a third of a century the
changes have been vast, and in many oi its sections the West
is more crowded than was the East when Greely shouted at
the top of his rhetoric, “Go West, young man, go West!” So
it has happened that we have many echoes of this cry, and
although the West is scarcely a half century from Indians and
wild animals to sky-scrapers and Populists, litre we find the
Secretary ol Agriculture—a new Cabinet position, by die way,
which the West established—saying, “Go East, young man,
go East;’’ Leave the crowded thoroughfares of the Western
land and take up the abandoned farms ol New England and
the Middle States, and do for the eliete portions of the coun
try what your ancestors did for the wilderness. Hut so far the
farmers are not preparing wagon trios to that section where
they cultivate the mind along with the land, and where, ac
cording to tilt latest circulated libel, they even import their
beans.
Articles are being published telling young men to go to
Siberia, and wonderful are the attractions offered. Our young
men are told to go to the colonies, to Japan and China, to the
different parts of the earth; and some of them have gone, and
many of them with accommodating relatives have returned.
Thousands went to Alaska, and most of them have beautiful
stories to tell about the gold which they did not bring home.
This idea ol going somewhere in order to amount to anything
belongs to the restless spirit ol the race, and nothing can be
more erratic in its contrasts and contradictions. A great busi
ness firm in Chicago moved to New York and took its West
ern men with it; at the same time a rival imported New York
men to man its Chicago establishment. A San Francisco mil
lionaire who bought a newspaper engaged editors all the way
from New York to run it; then when lie bought a New York
paper betook his San Francisco editors to run that. The
very day a great Eastern railroad took for its general manager
a man from Oregon, a great corporation in the Northwest sent
to the Atlantic seaboard for a president.
When big werk is to be done, when the big position is to
be filled, it is the man that is wanted, and not the fact that
he lives at home or has moved away because he did not
amount to anything in his own town. The great successes
are not made by change of location, although it often lias
something to do with the case. As a rule, the best thing that
happens to the average young man who has to move in order
to be worth his bread and butter, is that it throws him upon
his own resources. All over the world young men to-day
have greater opportunities than were ever known before.
But they will not realize them by dreaming that they can be
come rich 011 the oilier side of the world when they fail to do
their ordinary duties wherever they may be placed.—Lynn
Roby Meekitis in Saturday Evening Post.
Yes —Flktun and Cecil county give the thrifty young man
plenty of opportunities. It is exertion and stick-at-itness
that count. —[Kd.]
CECIL WHIG, ELKTON. SATURDAY. DECEMBER 9, 1899.
EVERY American’citizen who has read anything on the
subject of the Alaskan boundary dispute believes that
the United States should hold onto every foot of
ground to which she is entitled. There is not a dis
senting voice to this proposition. And yet some years ago
there were a lot of people in the country who opposed and
fought the Alaska purchase and accused the Government of
idiocy, if not criminality, on account of it. The case has a
strong parallel at the'present time.
ORGANIZATION of trusts goes merrily on in free
trade England, quite to the confusion of those who
asserted a few months ago that the protective sys
tem was the only soil in which trusts could flourish.
The British newspapers bristle with announcements of the
formation of new trusts and great corporations of this char
acter, while reports from other European countries, show
that the trust is not in any sense peculiar to the United States,
but that its development comes with business activity and
production on a great scale wherever these conditions exist.
PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
ON Tuesday, President McKinley sent his annual mes
sage to Congress, and which was a document of
strength and unusual interest. It reviews thor
oughly the very important questions now before the
country and makes certain recommendations. The President
steers clear of any utterances that can be taken by his oppo
nenls as savoring of politics. He confines himself to a clear
and succinct presentation > f matters that need the attention of
Congress and w here his recommendations are made they are
found to be in perfect harmony with the needs of the country.
The future of Cuba, Porto Rico, Hiwaii and the Phillipine
Islands, consume considerable space. In treating of the Phil
lipines, the President expresses the hope that the insurrection
w ill soon end, and truthfully says that “few graver respon
sibilities have been ever confided tons,” and that ‘‘if we ac I
cept them in a spirit worthy of our race and traditions, a great
opportunity comes with them'’ in the solution of the Phillipine
question. He also makes the strong point that to renounce
our allegiance over the islands “would involve at the outset a
cruel breath of faith.”
There can be no mistaking what the President has to say
concerning the question of trusts, and nothing more could
either be said or done by the President. He is merely an
executive and in setting lorlh his views on this subject he has
done his lull duty in the premises.
The President recommends that additional power be given
the Secretary of the Treasury to support the existing gold
standard, his suggestions being in line, as a matter of course
with those made by the Secretary a few days ago and set
forth in the bill prepared for the consideration of Congress.
On that point even the most carping critics can find no fault.
THE enormous gold productions of recent years are con
vincing thinking men who a few years ago favored a
return to silver that this is no longer necessary, at
least at present. President A. J. Warner, of the Bi
metallic League, during a recent visit to Washington, said
frankly to his friends that the very great increase of gold pro
duction of late was causing, in his opinion, a great deprecia
tion rather than an appreciation of gold, which, of course,
would obviate the necessity of still greater additions to the
metallic currency of the world by an increased use of silver.
CONGRESS.
SPEAKER HENDERSON will probably never enjoy a
prouder moment than when he was escorted to the
Speaker’s chair, having been elected to the highest
political honor that a foreign born American can at
tain, by the unanimous vote of his republican colleagues of the
House, amid the applause of members and of the crowded
galleries—the American who would not be proud of such an
honor doesn’t live. The other officers of the House elected
were Alexander McDowell, of Pennsylvania, Clerk ; Henry
Casson, of Wisconsin, Sergeant-at-Arms ; W. J. Glenn, of New
York, Door-keeper; Joseph C. McElruy, of Ohio, Postmaster;
and Rev. Henry M. Couden, of Michigan, Chaplain. With
the exception of Mr. Casson, who succeeded B. F. Russell, of
Missouri, these are the officers of the last House. Immediately
after the swearing in of the members, near the close of which,
the democrats created a little Hurry by opposing the carrying
out of the republican plan for dealing with the Roberts case,
the death of Vice-President Hobart was announced, and the
House adjourned, it having been previously understood that
the President would withhold his annual message until Tuesday
The first session of the Senate of the Fifty-Sixth Congress
was much briefer than that of the House, and from a specta
tor’s point of view, much less interesting. Senator Frye,
President pro tempore, called the Senate to order, and after
p rayer by the Chaplain, and the swearing in of new Senators,
t he death of the late Vice-President was announced, and a
motion to adjourn was adopted. But if the opening day of
C ongress was comparatively tame, there are plenty of indica
tions that lively days in both House and Senate will be numer
ous during the session.
PRESIDENT SCHURMAN, of the Philippine Commis
sion, announces that he not only originally opposed
expansion, but that he said to President McKinley,
when tendered the chairmanship of the Commission,
that he was opposed to the acquisition of the islands. The
President, however, insisted that he wanted only facts, what
ever they might be. As a result Mr. Schurman obtained
them, and in doing so became convinced that the islands
should be retained, and that the United States could give
them a vastly better government than they would obtain under
any other circumstances.
