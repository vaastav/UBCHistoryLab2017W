"ME AND MY PARTY."
Had President McKInley simply
aid in bis meesafire to congress that
"me and my party are running this
government and have brought upon
my dear people untold blessings of
prosperity and abundance," it would
have answered fully the purpose that
: does his. paper of over 20,000 words
and requiring 19 columns of closely
set type, which- be calls the "presi
dent's .message." And it would also
have saved much time to the 75,000,
000 people who spent an hour wading
through the effusion in hopes of find
ing at least one practical suggestion
or recommendation from which they
might judge what policies the presi
' dent espouses. But the president saw
fit to not confine ' himself to a few
brief and Intelligible statements of
facts and clear recommendations, and
' instead .issued the longest and most
senseless message any president has
ever promulgated. -.
After reading the 20,000 words of
gush and nonsense one cannot, unless
he is possessed of a most imaginative
mind, discover where the president
stands on any question except . that of
money and the tariff, which analyzed
shows that be favors the gold standard
and national bank issue, and that he
' believes in taxing the people all they
will stand.
In defense of his pet theory of pro
tection the president seeks to impress
upon the public mind that the imports
per capita are two per cent less than
in 1870, and the exports 58 per cent
more than in that year. "It is a note
' worthy fact" he says, "that the only
year In all our history when the pro
ducts of our manufactures sold abroad
exceeded those bought abroad were
1898 and 1899. . Government receipts
from' all sources for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1899, aggregated $610,
'982,004 and the expenditures $700,093,-
564, leaving a deficit of $89,111,559.
Mr. McKInley hopefully piophesles
that next year there will be a surplus
of $40,000,000 instead of a deficit.
The president then congratulates
the country upon the fact that there is
horded up in the national treasury an
immense amount of gold that is avail
able to keep "all money at a parity,
- and proceeds to recommend that the
secretary of the treasury be authorized
.whenever he sees fit, to issue bonds
for the purchase of gold, also to anth
orize national banks to have absolute
control of the issuance of credit cur
rency.
He bewails at some length the fact
that our merchant marine is inade
quate, that our products have to be
carried in foreign ships, and Intimates
that he would favor a measure to sub
sidize American ship builders.-
The formation of trusts also causes
. him to shed a few tears, but he has no
, suggestion to offer as to a remedy
;- The space devoted to this subject
would indicate that he 1b in the hands
- of his friends (the trusts) and that he
does not proposed to trample upon
their corns.
The Nicaragua canal scheme re-
- eeiyes some attention at his hands;
- that la, he mentions the fact that a
' canal has been thought of and some
data has been secured regarding its
feasibility and cost, but the infdrma
. tion he give's concerning the proposi-
- tion is so meager that it will be of lit
tle benefit to congress.
The transfer of sovereignty over the
" Philippines from Spain to the United
States is treated at some length, and
says: "I had every reason to believe
- and I still believe that this transfer of
sovereignty was in accordance with
.the wishes and aspirations of -the
great mass of the Filipino people
From the earliest moment no oppor
tunity was lost oi assuring the people
. of the islands of our ardent desire for
their welfare and of the intention of
this government to do everythiug pos
sible to advance their interests. The
United States went into the Philip
pines to preserve the peace, and
everybody there has to recognize the
military occupation of the islands and
the authority of the United States."
However, he makes no recommenda
tion regarding the future government
of the Islands, but very sensibly
leaves the matter with congress. He
- mentions the agreement the United
States entered into with the polyga
mous sultan of Sulu, whereby we agree
to give the sultan $760 a month for the
privilege of flying the American flag
over his domain and protecting the
, Sulu archipelago from encroachment
" by foreign powers.
In the message is a lot of rot about
the condition of other nations of the
world and our peaceful relations with
them ,that Is unimportant and devoid
of interest, for it is only a rehash of
what appears in the dally press of the
country.
Throughout the message is a
voluminous aggregation of meaning
less words, which praise the president
and his party and finally concludes by
thanking Almighty God for the things
Mr. McKInley takes credit to him
self.
it is owning to the depasturing of the
mountain ranges or to other causes
we are unable to state. But that the
rainfall has diminished is shown by
the reports kept by the weather bu
reau. From January, 1-53, to January,
1866, the average rainfall, snow in
cluded, was 22.66 inches per year,
from 1876 to 1890 it was 15.87 inches
and from 1890 to 1899 it was 13.77
inches. This decrease might have
been irom the tramping of the moun
tains, cultivation of the soil, from the
destruction of forests by fire or ' from
some unaccountable climatic i n fluence
At least we will not attribute it solely
to the pasturing of the mountain
ranges by sheep, but possibly that
might have had some effect upon the
climate in that it lessened the amount
of mo98e9 and grass that hold moisture
and reduce the temperature which
causes precipitation of rain from the
clouds. There is no question but parts
of the Cascade reserve are -not materi
ally affected by the ranging of sheep,
for there are portions south of Mt.
Hood where there aremmense bottoms
that are lakes during the winter,
where sheep can do no damage, but on
the mountain sides where they tramp
down the earth causing water to run
away rather than sink into the ground,
they are a detriment in that they
diminish the water supply,
f Mr. Bonney also draws somewhat
upon his imagination when he asserts
that the average wheat yield of Wasco
county Is about 20 bushels per acre,
whereas there never has been but few
years since wheat raising became a
leading industry that the average :has
been above 20 bushels.. The true
average-' Is nearer la busbels. This,
however, has but little to do with the
question of grazing sheep on the re
serve, more than that if Mr Bon Bey
knows no more about the effect sheep
have upon the mountain ranges than
be does about the average wheat yield
hecannot be taken as authority.
Whatever effect sheep may have ud-
on the water supply or upon the forests,
so long as they do not annihilate both.
it is not desireable or to the best in
terests of the state at large, to ruin
the great industry of sheep raising in
Eastern Oregon.. '. All that any one is
demanding at present is that sheep be
excluded from certain portions of the
reserve, those portions tributary to
the large farming section adjacent to
that part north of White river. The
people in that section believe th eir
water supply is materially affected by
sheep ' tramping out the grass and
moss that serve as water storages in
the Cascades. All that they want is
their rights, and certainly the 400 or
500 farmers in that section hava
equally as much right to the range
contiguous to their land as have the
66 sheep raisers who range their flocks
on the reserve.

stating a "few facts," but in reality
makes some very broad assertions
about the forest reserve and the graz
ing of sheep thereon.. Almost any
body who is acquainted with the con
ditions that exist in the forest of the
Cascades .will agree with Mr. Bonney
that sheep will not destroy timber,
tna is nr buu juub, ujr cmuug me

cept his theory that the tramping at
mountains by sheep does not lessen
the water supply in streams draining
the mountains. Any one of ordinary
intelligence knows that hard packed
ground will not absorb moisture and
store it as readily as did the moun
tain soil in its natural state, before it
was tramped over by domestic ani
mals, therefore his assertions that the
grazing of mountain ranges does not
lessen the water supply of the country
are not born out by facts.

The Astonan, commenting upon an
editorial that appeared in these col
umns a few days ago concerning the
lack of facilities for handling grain at
Astoria, and asking why , Astoria, be
fore it invites wheat raisers to ship
their product to that place, do38 not
erect warehouses capable of taking
care of it, says:
'The reason . wny Astoria has no
better warenouses or other arrange
ments to care for the crops of the in
terior is because the railroads have
prevented such preparations. Capital
is plenty, local and outside, stands
ready to invest in these structures as
soon as it is safe to do so. The O. R.
& N. Comnany would now crush out
the slightest manifestation of such an
enterprise. That company has already
killed two different projects to ship
wheat from the mouth of the Colum
bia river, under circumstances much
less provocative ef its opposition than
exist at present. No man who has had
the thrift and brains to accumulate
money is going to put it Into such in
vestments until he knows it is safe to
do so. The O. R. &. N. Company and
its allied interests have power to force
any independent grain buyer or ware
houseman out of business, not only in
Astoria but elsewhere. Without fixed
and ironclad agreements with the rail
roads, millions might be squandered
in an endeavor to change the present
course of grain to the seaboard. Too
much money is being made under the
existing unnatural conditions. Is it
possible that the Times-Mountaineer
doesn't know that the grain buyers of
the three states of California, Oregon
and Washington have combined to
control the Northwest grain output
and determine the price to be allowed
the farmer for it? Can't the limes
Mountaineer understand that the
superiority and cheapness of Astoria
as a grain market would disrupt the
combination and necessitate a new deal
all around, if it did not utterly destroy
any possibility of future manopoly,
We feel sure a closer examination of
the subject will satisfy the Times
mountaineer mat it is useless to ex
pect any developments for the care
and shipment of grain at the mouth
of the Columbia river until the rail
roads are forced by legislation or other
means to make a common rate to that
seacoa9t point - with the inland and
sometimes more distant points to
wbich the present combination aow
finds it profitable to force the grain
for export." .
If these statements made by the
Astorian are true,they present indeed a
serious outlook for the wheat raisers
of Xbe states of Oregon and Washing
ton. But we believe the Astorian
rather overdraws on its imagination.
The O. R. & N. Co. cannot control the
wheat markets of the world. Neither
can it longer control the transporta
tion business of the Northwest. Be
fore another crop is ready to move the
portage around the dalles of the Co
lumbia will be built, and grain can be
carried from the interior to Astoria as
well as to Portland or the Sound, and
offered there upon the open markets
provided there are sufficient storage
facilities.
The Astorian seems to -be too ready
to give up to adverse influences. If it
will display enterprise that was shown
by The Dalles a few years ago it can
and will become the wheat market of
the Northwest. When the O. R. & N.
Co., discriminated against The Dalles
the people put on a boat line between
here and Portland, and the result was
that the monopoly of the carrying
trade was broken. Now if Astoria will
do likewise, put up warehouses and
lend encouragement to boat lines on-
peratine on tbe river. It can get com'
mon point rates and also become the
wheat market of tbe northwest. Tbe
future of Astoria rests solely with
Aatorians.
FREE SIL VER MEXICO.
The gold standard press and orators
during the past few years have held
Mexico up as an example of depravity,
stagnated business and commercial
bankruptcy, because its standard
money is 50 cent silver dollars. It has
been painted to us as the nation that
is unstable, where business is un
settled and investment uncertain on ac
count of the fluctuations of silver.
But these gold standard papers oc
casiooal'.y, without apparently know
ing it, picture Mexico as one of the
most prosperous countries in America,
a place where business is "flourishing
and where foreign capital seeks invest
ment." The Portland Telegram is one
of tbe gold standard press that has un
intentionally shown up the prosperity
of silver standard Mexico. In a re
cent editorial praising that greatest of
Mexican statesman, President Diaz
it said.
"Encouraged by his statesmanship,
hundreds of millions of dollars frou
England, France, Germany, Holland,
Belgium and tbe United States have
found employment in the develop
ment of Mexico's great natural re
sources, tbe result being visable in
railroads, factories, development of
mines and improved -agriculture, em
ploying tens of thousands of the native
people and rapidly multiplying the
wealth of the republic.
"With tranquility and prosperity at
home 'and friendly relations with all
other nations, and having made Mexico
respected and prosperous above all
other Spanish-American countries,
that .republic does well to keep Diaz
as its ruler, and it will be fortunate
If, wben he pays the last debt to oa
ture, one as firm and strong and wise
can be found to take his place."
And so is it not true that Mexico is
tbe poverty-stricken country it has
been painted, but is really a prosperous
and enterprising nation, where "hun
dreds of mllllonsof dollars for England,
France, Germany, Holland, Belgium
and tbe United States have found em
ployment " rCeally we had not ex
pected such honest confessions from so
radical a gold standard paper as tbe
Telegram, which has been telling the
people that the silver country could
not be prosperous, and "foreign capi
tal" would not Invest therein, but
would be withdrawn together with
home capital that Is already invested.
This leads one to conclude that free
coinage might possibly not cause such
a dreadful calamity to the United
States as we have been led to believe
by the expression of the gold standard
people. If President Diaz is able to
force prosperity upon Mexico, despite
the fact that its standard money is
made out of tbe despised white metal,
Is It not possible that a Moses might be
found who would lead the people of
America through the "dire disasters
that are certain to follow" when our
mints are opened to silver? If Mexico
is prosperous under a silver standard,
is it not possible that the United
States, the greatest commercia.1 nation
of the world, and also the greatest sil
ver produc.'ng country of tbe globe,
might benefit by opening its mints to
the coinage of silver on an equality
with gold?

Tbe Grant county grand jury embod
led the following rather unusual-par
agraph in its report made to the court
last week:
"We have investigated several caBes
reported to us of intoxication among
minors, and regret to say that we -are
unable to secure sufficient evidence'
npon which to base an indictment.'
is deplorable to note the extent of this
alarming evil, and the number and
ages of the. youth who are becoming
addicted to the habit mere babes in
some instances atod yet so -schooled
that when questioned their minds are
a perfect blank. It wonld seem that
the rrindey should be found in the
home and not in the courts."
Here is a sermon that should not be
without effect. It is not the mouthing
of a pulpiteer or a theorizing old maid
nor does it come- from a space-filling
newspaper scribbler. After due legal
Investigation seven practical men
wblle regretting tbeir inability to se
cure evidence that would warrant in
dictmentfor offeuses which it was cer
tain had been committed, record their
conviction tbat, after all, the proper
remedy for such debasement of chil
dren lies in the home and cot in the
court. If this advice should be heeded
the result would be better than an
armful of indictments. Parental
obligations, to tbe offspring or the
state, are not discharged by payment
of taxes to support courts and sheriffs
and prisons.
It is weak inefficiency that pleads
ignorance of children's doings. Par
ents who look sharply after their
children from the beginning to
tbat tbey do obey are seldom troubled
with law-breaking offsprings or with
filial ingratitude. Again the lesson Is
drawn that If the homes of the people
were right, tbe saloon question would
speedily solve itself. To this end the,
conclusion of the Grant county grand
jury, signed by Foreman Jared A.
Taylor and his six fellow-invsetigators
Is commended for the consideration of
every community and every home.

The above certainly furnishes food
Tor reflection, and every statement
therein made is true. So long as the
youth of "the land is allowed to grow
up without res'tricting influence
thrown around him at home and with
out proper moral training from his
Infancy up, be will acquire vicious
habits. So long as the youth of tender
years is allowed to indulge bis appe
tite for strong drink there will be in
temperate drinking. Prohibition,
local option and high license laws
may fill our statute books, but they
will be without avail for while there is
demand for strong drink it will be of
fered for sale, but when the demand
is removed by educating the youth
not to drink there will be no saloons.

bridge across the Columbia, would
probably spend $25 each annually.
This would represent a trade of $150.
000 a year. .The $50,000 of bonds
could probably be floated at 5 per cent,
or an annual interest of $2,500. Will
the profits on $150,000 trade justify this
expenditure?
Besides this trade, which would be
distributed among tbe merchants, ho
tels, livery stables, blacksmiths, wagon
makers, saloons and others, a free
wagon bridge would cause the greater
portico of tbe wheat raised in Klicki
tat county to find market here. Tbe
county produces 800,000 bushels an
nually, and this added to tbe wheat
raised in Wasco county would mater
ially increase the commercial import
ance of The Dalles. The Klickitat
wheat farmers formerly came here, but
this season especially the greater por
tion has found its way either to Co
lumbus or Lyle. When the wheat
came here the trade came with it, and
Dalles merchants enjoyed a lucrative
business with the farmers of tbat
county. Sinco ih wheat has gone to
Columbus and Lyle, Klickitat farmers
have bought their supplies in Golden
dale, Lyle and Portland. The idea of
a bridge across tbe Columbia is one
worthy the consideration of Dalles
merchant3 and property owners.

ROBERST AND THE SULTAN
Oregonlans are smarting under the
disgrace that has been heaped upon
the state by the accusations of Plum
mer that our governor is a bribe take-
er, and the continued silence of the
chief executive. People of other
states are beginning to point the fin
ger of scorr at Oregon because it has
a governor who will not defend his
good name or that ' of the state In
which he holds tbe highest office
by denying a charge that reflects upon
his honesty. The Walla Walla States
man holds tbe governor up to scorn
and thereby casts a reflection upon
Oregon when it says:
"Tbe governor is placed In a pecu

A MATTER FOR LEGISLATION
In view of the numerous accidents
that have occurred oh different rail
roads in this state, it would seem that
something is wrong with the manage
ment, either employes are careless or
they are so overworked tbat they can
not give the attention necessary to the
duties that are placed npon them.; It
is hardly probable tbat railroad em
ployes would be wilfully negligent es
pecially when their own lives depend
upon tbe cautious handling of trains,
therefore tbe natural conclusion is
tbat many of the accidents are the re
sult of trainmen being overworked.
This would .certainly "seem to be tbe
case with the employes ' on freight
trains. A freight train crew consists
of an engineer and' fireman, con
ductor and two brakemen. A train
may consist of 30 or 60 cars, yet the
orew is the same. The engineer and
firemen have all tbey can do to furalsh
the motive power for the train, there
fore the rest of the -management de
pends upon tbe conductor and two
brakemen. This they are able to
look after provided the train is small,
but it frutterly impossible for them to
look after a train of 55 or 60 cars. Ia'
and candidates for 1900 said this:
"The leading issues for 1900 will be
anti-expansion, anti-militarism, anti-
trusts. At least these will be the
democratic slogans. The nomination
of Mr. ; Bryan Is in my opinion a fore
gone conclusion. He will be nominated
and I predict that he will be elected
president in spite of his radical views
on sliver.
Such a statement coming from
General Palmer is a pretty important
political utterance, in that it indicates
the reuniting of the democratic forces
under the leadership -of Bryan. It
shows that the effort to bringall classes
of democrats together is meeting with
success, another remarkable instance
of this being Croker's espousal of
Bryan's cause. S. F. Post.
THE COLUNBIA BRIDGE.
Tbe amended charter of Dalles City
authorizes tbe Issuance of bonds for
the purpose of constructing a bridge
across tbe Columbia, and at the pres
ent time a good many citizens are
advocating the building of a bridge
at an early date. There are argu
ments in favor of the proposition tbat
are unanswerable, except upon, the
general disinclination of people to en
cumber the ciiy with greater obliga
tions. In favor of the bridge is tbe
proposition that it would attract oo
less than three fourths of tbe Klicki
tat county trade to Tbe Dalles. In
tbat county is a population of about
8,000. Then the question resolves it
self into this: Is the trade of 6,000
people worth to Tbe Dalles the ex
pense of constructing the bridge?
which is said would be worth some
$50,000. On an average the 6,000 peo
ple who might be brought here to
EDITORIAL NOTES.
The Vancouver Register and Pacific
Democrat have consolidated under the
name Register-Democrat. The paper
announces tbat its editorial staff will
embrace Thomas ' Harlan, of Wasco
county, Oregon; Thurston Daniels,
Lieutenant Governor of Washington,
and Milton Harlan, of Vancouver,
Washington.
Senator Carter, of Moutsna, wants
his colleague, Senator-elect Clark, ex
celled on the grounds that he bought
bis election. If Carter can prove his
allegations, Mr. Clark should not be
seated; but if he must go, so should
benator ttanna, tor his election was
bought if ever a man's was. And there
are others who are equally guilty,
hence there is not much danger of a
searching investigation being' made.
Every citizen of the United States
longs for the time when tbe war in tbe
v niuppines win cease, and then news
that Agninaldo's army was disbanding
was received with general satisfaction,
therefore we were . not prepared to
receive the report tbat 800 Filipinos
had attacked Vigon and killed a lot of
our brave soldiers. It would seem
that Otis is pursuing his former tactics
of reporting one day tbe insurrec
tion as broken and the next day fight
ing a battle.
A staunch gold standard paper gives
an account of the 'convening of con
gress under these startling headlines.
"The silver men downcast." "Tbey
see no ray of hope in this congress
The writer of - these headlines mis
judges the silver men. They are not
downcast by any means. Tbey did
not expect anything favorable to sil
ver at the bands of this congress, tbey
knew it was dominated by the 'gold
kings. But they see a ray of hope in
that tbe gold party will enact such
pernicious legislation as to break its
neck.
Great Brltian is coming to a full
realization of tho enormity of tbe job
it has undertaken in South Africa,
Wben the war was first begun many
English though all that was necessary
to subdue tbe Boers was to make
great military display and tbey could
march right into Pretoria, but now
they' have found the most stubborn
resistance tbey have met in many years.
They are now fighting a cl villzed nation
and it is quite evident they will need
an army of 150,000 men before they
whip the Dutch burghers.
The American military man is tbe
best in the world. It makes no differ
ence to what arm he may be attached.
He doos his duty efficiently wher-ver
be may be. Our Cavalry dUmounto
is trained to fight as Infantry and have
been known to assault and capture
fortided places. Our marines do equal
good work whether on land or sea.
Only this week a squad of two hundred
marines landed from tbe Oregon cap
tured a fortified place on the island of
Luzcn and are holding it till infantry
comes over the mountain for a' perma
nent garrison.
If it is true, as very man v people of
Oregon are beginning to believe, that
Govei uir G -er, accepted Plummer's
money on the promise that he should
be appointed superintendent of the
penitentiary, something will have to
be done to get rid of the governor. . It
would hardly do for him to acknow
ledge his guilt and resign, so we would
suggest to his partisan friends that
tbey call President McKInley to bis
relief. The president is full of re
sources, and be might create an office
for Geer somewhere so tbat he could
resign with honor" to accept a more
prominent place.
Brigham Q. Roberts will not be
permitted to take his seat in congress
as representive from Utah; in fact he
will not be allowed to take tbeoatb of
office. There is no precedent for re
fusing to seat Robert, but there is pre
cedent for seating him. ' When George
Q. Coonon was elected delegate from
the territory of. Utah he was seated
notwithstanding the protest that he
was a polygmist, but then be was a
republican. Roberts is a demacrat,
and for tbat reason precedent in qot
considered by the present - congress.
If Roberts is really a polygmist he is
not fit to be a congressman, but he is
entitled to a trial before be is expelled
Almost at every session of congress
tbe proposition comes up to spend
several millions of dollars of the peo
pie's money in providing a more suita
ble and magnificent home for the chief
magistrate of this g. eat cou c try. It is
said the present "White House"
does not answer the purpose, does not
do credit to this nation of people, in
short it is so plain and unpretentious
that it is the butt of ridicule of
foreigners who are quick to make sport
of democratic institutions. In short
a palace is wanted, bv the building o
hich more of the money of the peo
ple, who in the main live in plain,
cheap bouses, can be squandered for
the benefit of a few wbo delight in the
buildlug temples to vanity. East Ore

Under Cleveland's second adminis
tration there was put in operation by
the bankers of the country what was
known as the "endless chain" system
of drawing gold out of the treasury
and forcing the issuance of bonds.
Tbe proposed currency measure of the
present administration purposes to
stop ibis syatein by giving tbe secre.
tary of the treasury power at any time
to issue bonds at 3 per cent to be paid
in gold. This is a remedy with a
vengeance. Tbe truth of the whole
matter is, that the banks have deter
mided tbat there bhall be no further
coinage of silver (excepting the bul
lion already in the treasury,) that the
greenbacks are to be withdrawn and
cancelled, and the only money shall
be gold and notes issued by the banks
secured by intarest-bearing, gold-de
