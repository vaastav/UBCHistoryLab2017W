The President's message, which ap
pears on the first page of to day's
Bulletin', was received in both
bouses. Senator Dillingham was
sworn in to succeed Senator Morrill,
of Vermont. The Senate transact

The South'3 Real Friends.
Mr. Carlisle is undoubtedly cor
rect when he says the true interest of
the South lies with the commercial
and industrial States of the
North and West, and not with the
mining States of Colorado, Idaho
and Nevada, which have special in
terests in silver. There is a nat
ural alliance between the South and
New York, Indiana and the States
lying between and noith of them.
The South buys from them and the
South sells to them, and has bought
from them and sold to them genera
tions. Moreover, when the iron
heel of the oppressor was on the
neck of the South it was the Dem
ocrats of New lork and Indiana
that stayed it from intolerable acts.
It is time for the bone and sinew of
the South to assert itself and w ring
from incompetent leaders their party
standards. Nashville American.
It was at LaGrange on the morn
ing after the cyclone which demol
ished the little town.
Judge John L. T. Sneed stood
viewing the ruins left in the wake
of the storm, and while thus engag
ed dropped into reminiscences.
"Do you see that old wrecked de
pot?" asked the Judge. "Well, I
used to attend school on the very
spot where it stood before this
storm. LaGrange is tl e scene of
my earliest and fondest recollections.
Why, sir, do you know, I have
limited this whole country over for
the game that in that day abounded
around here, and many a sportive
trip I have made with my old
friends, the Choctaw and Chicka
saw Indians, all of whom have now
joined their fathers some where.
"Those were great days.
"And let rue tell you another
thing. This little town before the
war, little as you might guess it
now, wars the abode of the most cul
tured and the most aristocratic peo
ple in the State. The settlers from
Virginia and. North Carolina all be
longed, hardly without exception, to
the most intelligent class of that day.
They came here, and finding the
town to be an educational center,
built homes here t give their chil
dren opportunities of education, at
the same time buying farms further
down the country.
"The people had remarkable
religious proclivities, too. I re
call how one old lady, Mrs. Glos
ter, rode horse back all the way to
Franklin to attend a convention of
Episcopalians.
"Speaking of Indians," continued
the Judge, "there were great num
bers of them around here. They
were very quiet and unobtrusive on
all occasions except when they were
drunk, and the settlers never had
serious trouble with them. I said
something about going on big hunt
ing expeditions with them. Well,
it is a fact; and I became so accus
tomed to their society on these trips
as to feel perlectiv at home among
them. I learned to speak both the
Choctaw and Chickasaw languages
with the fluency of a regular brave,
and the accomplishment stood me
in good stead on more than one oc
casion. "One point about the Indians of
that day that is not frequently com
mented upon is their appreciation of
humor. 'I hey were very witty and
had a manner of getting off pointed
remarks that was amusing. Ibere
was alwavs a point to what they

It is a fine children's remedy for

Tax Aggregate.
Ex-Slave Pension Scheme
Again.
The promoters of the ex-slave
pension scheme are now trying a
more daring method than ever be
fore. They are bombarding the
President with letters and petitions
asking him to recommend the plan
in his annual message to Congress.
The way iu which the scheme has
been worked iu the past was for the
promoters to form an association
with branches iu different parts of
the Union. In order to establish a
branch a charter had to be obtained,
which cost i 2.50. After that each
member had to pay 23 cents to get
an individual certificate, and 10
cents a month" dues. As there are
understood to be not far from 100,
000 negroes who have been iuvei
gled into the plan, the reveuues to
the promoters must have been very
large.
Last year Pension Commissioner
Evans recommended to the Post-
otlice Department that the circulars
of the enterprise be barred from the
malls, which was done. Subse
quently the Senate Committee on
Pensions took the matter up and
denounced it as a fraud. These
things, however, never reached the
cars of the ignorant people who
were the victims of the fraud.
In former days the promoters
to m-
y request, a oiu pen
sioning all persons who had been
in slavtry before the civil war. The
bill, of course, died, but the intro
duction was enough. The promo
ters of the scheme were able to in
form their deluded subscribers that
the project was on the eve of tri
umph; that a bill hail already been
introduced, which would pass with
out delay. People like the ex slaves,
few of whom had any chance for an
education, knew little about the
difference between passing and in
troducing a bill. Many negroes
who were not born in slavery are
said to have been told that they
could hare in the benefits of the
pension law by getting certificates,
but this was probably due to indi
vidual enterprise on the part of
rascals of their owt race.
What the appeal to the President
means cannot be determined, except
that the plan of getting a Congress
man to introduce a bill is zetting
worn out and the projectors need
something new. The petitions are
fair enough on the face, and plead
with the presideut in a seemingly
honest way, giving statistical as
well as sentimental reasons why he
should recommend such a plan.

"I recall the story of one old
christian Indian. There was a jus
tice of the peace in LaGrange by
the name of Simpson. The Indian
under consideration owed this coun
try squire 9. After repeated but
unsuccessful attempts to collect the
debt, Squire Simpson finally sued
the Indian, lie issued the papers
in accordance with bis legal authori
ty, had them returned before him,
and then gave judgment in his own
favor for the amount of his claim
"The Indian was surprised at this
action, but he visited the squire one
day and paid him the money, at the
same time asking for a receipt. It
chanced that Simpson had no writ
ing materials at hand he told the
Indian so, but the latter was impor
tunate. He wanted a paper showing
that he had paid the debt, and he
wanted it badly.
"Simpson told him that he had
made au entry on the docket show
ing that the judgment had been sat
isfied, and declared that that would
be a sufficient receipt.

ceipt, anyway?' asked the squire.
