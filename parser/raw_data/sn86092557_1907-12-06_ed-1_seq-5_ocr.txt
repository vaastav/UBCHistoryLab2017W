GREAT RACE
_ ^ (Contlnuwq^rom !r<of Qnc.t _ __
Most of the Republican political roan- j
agers at to-day's gathering believe that j
President Roosevelt Is sincere in his '
determination not to again become a j
candidate, and that when the proper
time comes he will use'al) his,great in- j
Muence to prevent the presentation of j
ids name before the convention.
In rogard to Secretary Taft, many .
i politicians bolievo that his return to '
} America will inaugurato n whirlwind ,
| campaign that will result in making
jhini the popular choice of the Repiibll- (
leans of the country. Others believe
that by his alliance with the president
Taft has inherited all of Roosevelt's
enemies, without attaining to the lat- i
ter's iKjpularity, and that his boom is 1
doomed. The only chance for Vice
President Fairbanks to secure the 1
nomination, according to export testimony,
lies in the possible death of i
President Roosevelt prior to the hold- <
ing of the convention. In such nn
event. Fairbanks, having succeeded to
the presidency, would become the '
logical and only candidate. Governor j
Hughes Is rapidly gaining In favor as !
n presidential possibility and Is already
assured of a solid delegation 1
from New York State. Ills Independ- 1
ent jx>sltlon has < won many friends t
among both the radicals and conser- 1
vatives of the party. Speaker Joseph (
Cannon is also showing a great gain in (
strength and has the support of many f
influential men in both houses of con- t
press, particularly those antagonistic i
to the Fresident Senator Knox. Pennsylvania's
favorite son, and Secretary
Cortelvou, who remains loyal to Roose-1
velt but secretly hoi>es to be nominat- <
od as Garfield was In 1880, are looked 1
upon as Mark horses," either of whom 1
may possibly be selected as a conipro- i
mine candidate. - j <
