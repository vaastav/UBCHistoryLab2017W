TJC STATE CHRONICLClli:

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
We give to-day - the gist of the
President's message which was read
in Congress yesterday. It is very
long and many questions are elabor
ately and exhaustively discussed. It
would fill every page of the Chroni
cle if we should print it in full. In
order to give our readers the best
portions of the message, we have
made a very careful condensation,
giving extracts in full upon the
more important questions.
There will be many opinions
about the message. fie regard it
as by far the ablest public utterance
yet made by the President, and not
only so but it is the most plausible
and popular defense of the position
of his party upon the issues before
the people. It will strike the
thoughtful reader' that while the
President speaks in glowing com
mendation of the actions of the last
Congress, he is on the defensive
from first to last. He has evidently
learned nothing from the election
of 181H) when the Congress that,
passed the McKinley bill was
swept out ot power for the legisla
tion now praised by Mu. Harrison.
The effect of the reciprocity is
touched upon but that question is
not made a leading topic. To have
given it too much prominence would
be to swell the already jrrowinn
Blaine boom.
The President- docs not write
with anv nnnarent zest until he
i w
ouches upon the silver question, the
demand for financial reform, and
Wleral contest of elections. lie
deads eloquently that there be no
hange in the existing laws relat.
ng to money and that Congress ex
ert every effort to secure legislation
hat will prevent gerrymandering
and illegal voting.
In the message Mr. Harrison
does not rise above the partisan.
His argument against gerrymander
ing is based upon what the Demo
crats have done in Michigan. The
Republican gerrymanders in New
York and Connecticut do not move
him. And it is so of his pretended
regard for fair elections. It is in
the South that he wants better elec
tion laws. There is not a word
against the action of Connecticut
and Nebraska in depriving legally
elected governors of their offices.
The readers of the Chronicle
will hu. struck by the fact that
though the price of cotton is lower
than ever:- the condition nf the
Southern farmer more deplorable;
the unrest among the farmers greater
than ever in the history of our peo
plelargely caused by Republican
legislation no echo of this unrest,
poverty and stringency in money
matters is found in the message of
the President. There has never
been a time when money was so
scarce in a third of the domain of
the Republic and when there was
such crying need for legislative re
lief, and yet no hint of the cry of the
people reaches the ears of the man
who sits in the White House. He
is oblivious to their needs and de
mands. - -
THE OnEOlIIOLE'S POSITION E2T-
DOUSED.
(txtraet from "an address to the pe
plo" by the committee appointed by the
Dtjm., State Executive committee.)
Speaking by authority of the State
Executive Comm ittee, , ice urge all our
people to refrain from fault finding;
we condemn abuse and vituperation
in whatever quarter; exhort all to
practise a prudent and rational for
bearance; and commend to you the
supreme virtue of chanty. Let u$
concede to all, as ive claim for all,
the iri'dienable. right of opinion.
Tom Watson, the eloquent and
erratic Georgian who gave up his
law license to join the Alliance,
got eight votes for Speaker in the
House. He was elected as a Dem
ocrat and every consideration of
duty demanded that he go into the
Democratic caucus and get the
best man for Speaker. Instead of
that he and Simpson and six others
held a little side show of their own.
The North Carolina Congressmen
who belong to the Alliance showed
too much sense to go off after this
iridescent dream.
mmigt- HU . fc:w- ,
The Georgia Congressmen who
have been interviewed by the Con
stitution say that the election of
Crisp means that measures of finan
cial relief will be considered b
Congress as well as the reform of
the tariff. They say the election
of Mr. Mills meant the strangling
of financial legislation.
Don't belch in peoples' faces.

Liver is torpid the Bow
