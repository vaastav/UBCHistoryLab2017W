Aakn #5,000,000 For Sabnariae Torpedo
Boat*-Hew IpelUas la Doomed
By CHARLES W. ARTHUR
Washington, Dec. 17. ? [Special.]?
The proposed investigation of the so
called lumber trust which is culled for
in resolutions offered by 8enutor Kittredge
of South Dakota and Representative
Miller of Kansas Is perhaps
of more general Interest than any similar
movement which has been set on
foot since the present agitation against
great combinations of capital commenced.
The only Investigation that
approached It In this respect was that
of the alleged beef trust. A very large
percentage of the people In the United
States do not use Any of the products
of the Standard Oil company, for Instance,
and so are not directly Interested
In the prices charged by that
concern, but nearly everybody eats
meat, and everybody Is Interested In
the cost of commodities snId to be controlled
by the lumber trust. Everybody
sits in a chair and eats from a
table or writes from a desk or in some
other way Is concerned as to whether
the cost of wood manufactures is high
or low. Mr. Kittredge and Mr. Miller
appreciate this and are therefore of
the opinion that something should be
done at once. Prices are admittedly
higher than in former years, and the
purpose of the proposed Investigation.
If It Is inaugurated, will be to disclose
arhatliop n. tinf tilt* Illi-rtMKO In
by conditions. Many members of congress
are of the opinion that some very
grave injustices will be uncovered If
the mutter Is. gone Into thoroughly.
Japanese Soaro Passed.
The so called Jupanese scare seems
to have passed over entirely. The legislators
from California are uot talking
about the president's message,
which they so vigorously resented at
first?that is, the part of it relating to
the Japanese?and those prophets who
persisted In declaring that the president
was negotiating a new treaty
with Japan despite denials from the
highest possible source have at last
quieted down. But there Is still an
undercurrent of opinion to the effect
that sooner or later we shall have trouble
with Japan. When Representative
Kahn of California introduced a bill
appropriating $5,000,000 for the construction
of submarine torpedo boats
to be stationed along the Pacific coast
he specifically disclaimed any thought
of hostilities with Japan in the near future.
Yet of course the friction over
the Japanese school question in San j
Francisco and the general "cockiness" j
of the Japanese in the far west, to use
a term which Californians say best j
describes the attitude of the Nipponese j
out there, were the factors which led j
him to Introduce the bill. Diplomat- [
ically the situation is quite serene.
The Japanese have been much impressed
by President Roosevelt's warm
expressions in his message. That is
exactly the effect he wished to produce,
so if there is an understanding between
liiin and the California congress- j
men conditions Tiinv be said to bo satis
factory all around. Still many believe J
it is unwise in the extreme to leave i
our long Pacific coast line as nearly
unprotected as it is. and there are
numerous evidences that authorities
generally are in favor of preparing;
for possible war in these pipiug times
of peace. Instead of beiug in the nature
of a defiance they believe that the
strengthening of our west count defenses
will go further toward averting;
hostilities in the future than any
amount of diplouiucy.
N?w Spoiling Doomed.
The new, or simplified, form of spelling;
put into effect by President Roosevelt
hist summer Is decidedly not popnlur
In congress, and there is little doubt
that within the next few weeks both
houses will act In such a way as to effectually
prevent the use of the new
form In official documents. Even the
president's message, it appears, cannot
be published with "thrus" and "thos"
and "klsts" in it. Congress provides
the money for government printing,
and therefore, it is contended, iias ample
power to say what form of spelling
shall be observed, especially since the
new method necessitates additional
work, which increases the cost of all
government documents in which it appears.
If both houses do not accept
that paragraph of the legislative, executive
and judicial appropriation bill
which stipulates that all spelling shall
be according to Webster, the joint committee
on printing will bring in a similar
provision. The paragraph in the
appropriation bill might go out on a
point of order, but the other would
have to be voted on, and welt Informed
members say there Is no doubt of what
the result would be in such au event.
LittU Work Before Recess.
Not a great deal of work will be
done In the few days which intervene
between this date and adjournment for
the Christmas holidays. The legislative
appropriation bill, which whs reported
a week ago. will have been sent
Liver to the senate from the house when
the recess is taken, but aside from that
little important legislation will bnve
been enacted. The legislators will assemble
again on .Tun. 3 after the two
weeks' holiday, and then they will have
to got clown to business in earnest In
ardor to get through with what must
be done before March 4.
