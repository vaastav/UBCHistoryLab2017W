The Air Lino Railroad.
Wo learn from thc Greenville "Enterprise,"
that a public meeting was held nt that place
on last Sulcday, to confirm the action of the
County Commissioners in subscribing 8200,
000 to tho capital Stock of thc Air Linc Rail
road. Gen. Easlcy mndc one of his best
speeches in favor of thc subscription. lie
was followed by Rev. E. T. Duist on thc same
sido. Thc action of tho County Cominis,
sioners was confirmed with few dissenting
votes. Thus Greenville has subscribed in
this manner and by private subscription some
?351,000. Grcctnillo fully apprccintcs her
condition. Would that Oconee and Dickons
could act in Uko liberal manner.
Emigration.
A Since the termination of tho war, wo have
heard much on thc subject of emigration, but
have scott very little done in that direction.
In Newberry, better success has attended thc
labors of thc enterprising. Three hundred
ublc bodied men have been introduced into
that County in thc last three years. This is
a result of tho most cheering character.
There arc thirty-ono Counties in thc State.
Euch could have accomplished what New
berry has, and this would have given us
0,300 able bodied emigrants. A few years
of such work would give us tho State with
out doubt. It is not too late to succeed yet.

Dear Courier: A inn to Walhalla and bock
is no pleasant trip, notwithstanding tho com
fort und conveniences obluicod on tho Creon
ville Railroad. This road is in good condition
and makes good timo, nt least BO far as is con
sistent with safely, and wo prefer to praiso a
sate to a breakneck gait. Tho condition and
management of thc road reflects thc highest
credit on its managers, but Ibero is ono thing
lacking. Tho froight and passenger rates arc
ruinously high. Tho bitter impedes travel and
diminishes tho earnings of tho road, ut thc
sacrifico of tho intcicsts of thc people. Thc
former drinks up the hard earnings of the fur
nier and discourages production. Tho policy
is suicidal. Wo uro satisfied, that with a re
duction of rates, tho amount of froight and
travel Would double the earnings of thc road
in a few years. Political economy abounds
with illustrations of Ibis fact in matters of na
tional revenue, and not a singlo lustnncoonn bo
pointed out, where n decrease of tho tax on a
particular article, bas not resulted in such an
increase-in its production as to enhance tho
gross iucomofroui it. Such, wo are sure, would
be true of freights likewise. Freights may
become so high as to condorn product worthless,
all its value in market, hoingconsumed in thc
transportation, and in fact b-gji ,;xje3 l,j.vftV?
tend to diminish pr^Juctlou. %'{<> evi]' \v0

At Danville they were ordered out of tho fi
