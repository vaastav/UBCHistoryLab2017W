Admission of Virginia—Action of the
Committee.
Though the President, in his Message de
livered to Congress on the Gth, stated that Vir
ginia had done "all that was required by the
resolution of Congress," in reference to the
election submitting the Constitution, "and by
all the. reconstruction acts of Congress, and had
abstained from all doubtful authority," and
thereupon "recommended that her Senators
and Representatives be promptly admitted to
their seats and the State be fully restored to its
place in the family States;" and though, at
noon on the Bth, in response to the address of
Mr. Turner, the Chairman of the Committee
appointed by the Legislature, the President
said that he "did not doubt the speedy admis
sion of the State," yet this Committee on hold
ing an informal conference with Gen. B. F.
Butler at his residence on the same evening
(the Sth), and learning that he—Butler—de
sired additional guarantees, promptly assented,
and added the following to their address to
Congress:
"And the undersigned pledge themselves
and those whom they represent that the Con
stitution of Virginia voted for by the people on
the Gth day of July, 1869, shall faithfully
carried out in letter and in spirit."
We do not purpose now to comment upon
the action of this committee, presenting Vir
ginia as a supplicant at the feet of B. F. But
ler, "whom it were base flattery to call a vil
lian," whose malignity is gratified by the hu
miliation and abasement of the "mother of
States and of Statesmen" thus effected through
his instrumentality, but merely to protest that
that committee is not, and could not be inves
ted with authority to restrict the future action
of Virginia. Though such action on the part
of that committee is wholly unauthorized, yet
it may become the "direful spring of woes un
numbered."
Congress may incorporate such pledges as
the committee may make into the act admit
ting the State as the conditions of admission,
and may, at aDy future time, claim that the
conditions have been violated and that the act
of admission has been thereby abrogated.
Unless Virginia be admitted upon perfect
equality with the other States cf the Union,
she should spurn admission—however desirable
admission upon terms of equality may be. —
When admitted, she will have the right to
change her Grganic law and her statute laws to
suit herself, it by such changes she does not
violate the Constitution of the United States,
for that instrument affirms that, "the powers
not delegated to the United States by the Con
stitution, nor prohibited by it to tbe States, are
reserved to the States respectively and to the
people." She will not only have the right to
change them, but it will be her duty to do so
whenever she believes they can be improved
thereby.
On the morning ofthe 9th, three committees
from the State appeared before the Recon
struction Committee, representing respectively
the Legislature, the seceding wing of the Rad
ical Convention, and tbe non-seceding wing,
having as their chairmen, respectively, Turner,
Piatt, and Porter.
The committee representing the Legislature,
presented their views in writing, briefly reci
ting what had been done in the State toward
carrying out the Eeconstruction acts and as
serting that what had been done by the people
of Virginia was in good faith and that the con
stitution, as far as adopted, shall be carried out
to the very letter and spirit of its intent and
law. This <vas briefly advocated by Turner and
Crenshaw, of the House of delegates, and by
Hine. Piatt, republican member of Congress
elect from the Second district, advocated the
unconditional admission of Virginia, without
applying the test oath to members of the Leg
islature. He was followed by Porter, republi
can member elect from the Third district, who
opposed the immediate admission of the State;
but in order to facilitate reconstruction advised
that the test oath be administered to members
of the Legislature, excluding members who
could not take it, and supplying their places
with those who could from the next highest on
the election returns. He also suggested, as
another plan of reconstruction, the submission
of the constitution, with the test oath and dis
franchising clauses included. These views were
opposed on the ground that a new election
would be rendered necessary, as the applica
tion oi that oath would reduce the number of
members to less than a quorum and also involve
the re-election of United States Senators.—
Bland, a colored member cf the Legislature,
made a speech in favor of immediate admission
without the test oath. He made an emphatic
address, declaring that the State had done ev
erything she could do consistent with her hon
or to testify to the national government her
obedience to its authority and to the laws of
Congress. He, therefore, protested against
administering the test oath to her Legisla
ture, and contended that the State wa3 loyal
to the core and fully entitled to every privilege
and right accorded to the other loyal States.—
Governor Walker, who was present by request,
addressed the Reconstruction Committee, and
strongly endowed the declaration of the legis
lative committee that the terms of the Consti
tution would be strictly adhered to, and spoke
of the loyalty of the people as deserving of a
prompt recognition by the immediate admis
sion of the State into the Union.
The committees were requested to reduce
their views to writing and present their papers
to the Reconstruction Committee at the meet
ing Saturday morning.
At 10 o'clock on Saturday morning, the Re
construction Committee met. The different del
egations from this State were present. Piatt
presented a long address setting forth his views
in favor of the admission of the State, and
Porter presented one against it. Oar readers,
who voted for Segar for Congressman at large
wiil be surprised to learn that he presented an
address to the Reconstruction Committee op
posing the admission of Virginia as at present
constituted, and that Ex-Gov. Wells is in favor
of the immediate admission of the State with
out any further conditions, and favors the pas
sage by Congress of an act of amnesty placing
all citizens on the same footing as to voting,
holding office, serving on juries, &c.
Congressman Ward, of the committee, ex
presses the opinion that the committee will re
port for the admission of the State on Tues
day— to-day.

Donble-Track Freight Railway.
The Virginia Advance says that "the West
must have a great double-track freight railway
to the Atlantic seaboard. For years she has
thrown out feelers, and projected plans to get
access to the ocean. Her energies have been
largely subverted by New York capital, and she
has never yet commenced at the right base and
completed the true Hue. Had it not been for
the war the Pacific Railroad would never have
reached Omaha. Had it not been for the war,
the great double-track freight railway would
have been built before to-day, from the mouth
of the Big Sandy to Aquia Creek. Take the
map, and it will be found upon thorough ex
amiEation that a system or line of railway, tap
ping the Pacific road at or near Laramie, in a
straight line to St. Louis, from thence, by way
of Cincinnati and Louisville to the mouth of
the Big Sandy, thence by way of Staunton to
Aquia Creek, is a short cut, saving three hun
dred miles to the West. All the effort of cap
italists, and all the power of corporations have
been for years thrown north of this route. The
Pennsylvania Central and the Baltimore and
Ohio, two of the most powerful railway corpor
ations in the United States, every local preju
dice and every arm of sectional partizanship
has been used against tbe great natural outlet
of the West. But still the West will and must
have this route. What it will do for the State
of Virginia we will comment on hereafter. The
intermarriage of Coal and Iron in the State by
such a railway, will be a matter cf felicitation
in the more immediate consideration of the in
terests of the State of Virginia."
Manufactures.
The Lynchburg Virginian closes a well writ
ten article on the climatic advantages of Vir
ginia with the following encouraging language:
"As a manufacturing State, Virginia has
unsurpassed natural advantages. She has all
the metals in abundance that can be found any
where else in the bowels of the earth, and
these, together with her contiguity to the great
cotton growing region?, mark her cut as a State
that mu?t engage largely in manufactures.—
Such operations can bo conducted from year's
end to year's end, in this genial climate with
out interruption. Why then, with such advan
tages, shall not Virginia soon take rank as the
greatest agricultural and manufacturing State
in the Union ? We honestly believe that noth
ing but a lack of enterprise can prevent the
realization of this destiny."
Shenandoah Valley Railroad.
The Page Courier says that it is not proposed
that the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, through
the counties of Jefferson, Clarke, Warren,
Page, &c, shall be built by tbe Cumberland
Valley R. R. Company, but that it "will be
made by Virginians, if made at all—a new
company will be organized, that will elect its
own officers and exercise entire control. The
only thing that now remains to be done to make
the construction a fixed fact is for the counties
interested to make as large a subscription as
they possibly can and grant tbe right of way.
This alone remains to be done, as a sufficiency
of material aid to complete it has already been
promised." (
The Canal.
The National Board of Trade, led by Mr.
Monroe, of lowa, have given the influence of
that most able and enlightened association, by
an overwhelming vote, to the James River and
Kanawha Canal; they adopted a resolution
putting the work on a national footing and me
morializing Congress for aid, and they wisely
recommended a scheme ol administration,
whose theory is to ensure the benefits of the
work to tbe great section that needs and will
now demand its completion. Whether Con
gress shall take their view of it is a matter of
some consequence, it is true, but not vital to
tbe enterprize ; for production is stronger than
politics, and production demands the outlet.
The Cumberland Valley Railroad.
The citizens of Winchester are taking active
measures to secure the passage of this road by
way of that town. A meeting held last week
requested the county court and town council to
appropriate $300 to defray the expense of a
survey of the proposed route, and further re
quested the same to submit to tbe qualified vo
ters of the town and county the question of ap
propriating $200,000 to the capital stock of the
said road, provided it U brought by way of
Winchester. The meeting disclaimed any hos
tility on their part to its being extended
through tbe counties of Page and Warren.
On Friday week, the Board of Trade cf
Pittsburg held a meeting, and a committee was
appointed "to take measures toward the con
struction of a railroad via the Connellsville
road to Uniontown, thence to Fairmount, West
Virginia, thence to Grafton, thence to Staun
ton, opening a communication with the South
Atlantic and Gulf States."
The comments by the press, on the Presi
dent's Message, are various—some of the criti
cisms harsh enough—but, generally, the mes
sage meets with rather kicd and courteous
treatment. E?pecially so is this the case in the
South. Of course, some portions of it, for in
stance, about Georgia, are not commended.
There was a large meeting of citizens in
Lynchburg Monday night to promote the pro
ject of a railroad from that city to a connection
with the Chesapeake and Ohio at Covington or
Clifton Forge. The proceedings were of a very
determined character, and look like business.

It is not gcneially known that cotton is suc

STAUNTON SPECTATOR AND GENERAL ADVERTISER.
Chesapeake and Ohio R. R.
A late number of the Stockholder, published
in New York, de.-cribes the four great railroad
routes between the Mississippi river and the
four chief cities of the Atlantic seaboard, to wit:
the Vanderbilt, or New York Central combina
tion ; the Erie and Great Western broad gauges;
the Pennsylvania road and its extensions, and
the Baltimore and Ohio system, with their
several interlacing branches, feeders and exten
sions at either end. It then considers our
Chesapeake and Ohio road, saying:
"We perceive there is a new line now rapidly
pushing into the very field of production em
braced by the great cities of Cincinnati, Louis
ville, St. Louis and Chicago. It is a short line
to tide-water, and has the advantage of an equa
ble climate, adjacent coal deposits and low rul
ing grades. We refer to the Chesapeake and
Ohio railroad (formerly the Virginia Central,)
begun, and for some time carried oa, under the
auspices of the State of Virginia. This line,
which reachesunfailing navigation at Richmond.
Norfolk, West Point, and Washington on the
Chesapeake Bay, was carried in a general western
direction across the Blue Ridge, and when the
war broke out was halted at Covington (205
miles,) the foot ofthe main chain dividing the
waters of the James from those of the Ohio
tributaries. The enterprise so long cut off and
set back by the cloud of war has at last enlisted
the attention cf eminent New York capitalists,
who have been won by its merits, and it has
been reconstructed on a more solid basis. —
A. A. Low, W. H. Aspinwall, C. P. Hunt
ingdon, David Stewart, and other eminent capi
talists, leading men in the country in finance
and railways, with Fisk & Hatch as their bank
ers, are the active men in the new organization,
and having in the twelvemonth past completed
their arrangements, now proceed to put them
ia force. A corps of workmen are to be put on
the line at once, and it is expected that the road
will be completed and equipped to the confluence
of tho big Sandy and Ohio rivers in less than
two years.
At this latter point roads are already building
and projected to connect it with Cincinnati via
Maysville, with Louisviiie via Lexington, with
Chicago via Toledo and Xenia, and with Colum
bus via Portsmouth. Through these channels
it will nach the whole Mississippi Valley sys
tem and the Pacific railroads. It is said the
distance between Chicago and Washington by
this route is no greater and can be made in bet
ter time than by the Pennsylvania or Baltimore
and Ohio routes, while from the central tier of
cities the distance is fully fifty miles shorter to
tide-water, and the gradients are thirty percent
lighter. The great feature of the business oi
the line will be found, however, in its touching
nearly twelve thousand miles of steamboat
navigation at its terminus on the Ohio river.—
Below the Kanawha and Big Sandy tributaries
the Ohio is navigable all the year, and boats
can receive and discharge cargoes bound to and
from most distant cities of the Mississippi Val
ley,
This is emphatically a short line—less than
400 miles between the products of the West and
the vessels of the Atlantic, and its low average
gradients, only occasionally reaching seventy
feet to the mile, are ofthe utmost importance
in handling freight.
Hon. Thos. J. Michie.
This distinguished gentleman has recently
been in this city in attendance upon tbe Dis
trict Court of Appeals. As a jurist, his well
earned fame is as wide as the limits of the
whole country. A retentive memory filled with
tbe richest stores ol legal learning, a powerful
mind, comprehensive in its scope, and energet
ic in action, capable alike of the highest flight
of fancy and most solid argument, sustained by
a fine personnel and imposing physique. We
cannot fail to regard him as a noble type of
Virginia manhood, now rapidly passing away.
Although advancing in years, we could per
ceive no dimination in his mental and bodily
vigor. May he be spared yet these many years,
an ornament to his profession, and the pride
and admiration of his many friends!—• Win

We concur with the Whig in its expression
of the following sentiments :
"There never was a time when there was less
occasion for stirring up partisan feeling than at
present in Virginia. Our material interests de
mand the united energies of all our people, and
appeal for aid to every friendly source. The
next Presidential election is three years distant,
and at that time, we know not what parties or
politicians may be in existence, and until then,
we are luckily relieved from the necessity of ta
king any part ia Federal politics. If we are
wise, we will profit by the opportunity—-abstain
from all offensive participation in politics, seek
kindly relations with ail, take help from any
quarter, and push our fortunes to the utmost."
Valley Railroad.
A communication in the last Lexington Ga
zette, signed "Rockbridge," concludes as fol
lows:
"By next spring the prospect (for the Valley
Railroad) will have brightened greatly. Balti
more will have then come forward with her big
subscription, which she is only waiting an act
of her State Legislature to make. Old Au
gusta wiil yet plumb the track.
Then the capital will be raised—the contracts
will be let oat—the work will go bravely on ;
and soon after that, let scoffers and doubters
look out—get out of the way —clear the track
and let the engine pass."
Disabilities Removed.
On Wednesday last, the Senate passed an
act, which had passed tbe House last session,
removing tbe disabilities of quite a number of
Virginians. Among them are the following :
Augusta County,—Dr. Francis T. Stribling,
Jos. N. Ryan. Wm. A. Burnett, R. D. Hill,
B. F. Filer, Robt. G. Biekle and David C.
McGuffin.

County Judge.
The Clarksville Roanoke Valley says that
"the duties of a County Judge under the Con
stitution we have adopted will require talent,
discretion, impartiality, and integrity for their
faithful performance. The office wiii inflict se
vere injury on tlie people unless these qualities
combine in the selections made for it. On the
other hand, if the office is worthily filled it will
be a great improvement on the old County
Court system."
The Lispatcli says that "we have the most
unmistakable signs of the tendency of trade to
wards the middle latitude—that which is safest
and most propritious to commerce —that which
is most agreeable to man. From the North
west and the Southwest the lines are forming
that will converge just here in Virginia upon
the middle line of latitude; and the Chesa
peake bay must be the inevitable receiver of all
the commerce that will follow them."

{JUNE ESTATE IN HABKET.-I offer
'. for sale my estate on South River, in Au
gusta county, Va , two miles from New Hope.—
It contains 350 acres, every foot of which is
arable and of superior quality. It has on it a
handsome and commodious brick mansion house,
spacious barn and all necessary out-homes, an
abundance of timber, young orchard of select
fruit, well set in grass and in a good state of cul
tivation. The character of the improvements—
the quality of the land—its proximity to market,
(being fourteen miles from Staunton, and ten
from Waynesboro depot) to churches, schools,
stores, &c. —as well as tho surrounding society
and attractions, warrant me in saying that there
is not a superior estate in market in this part of
the Valley. IfdGsired, it can be conveniently eli
vided into two farms. My address is New Hope,
Va., and Mr. N. K. Trout of Staunton, Va., au
thorized to sell for me.
