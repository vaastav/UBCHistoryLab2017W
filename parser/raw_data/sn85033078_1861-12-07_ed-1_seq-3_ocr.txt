The Stone Fleet. —What is known
as the “atone fleet” consists of 25 old
whaling ships, having an aggregate
tonnage of 8,377 tons, and carrying
7,841t0ns of stone. The vessels are to
be scuttled and be sunk in the water
approaches to the Sohthern ports. It is
estimated that a dozen of these ships
judiciously disposed will effectually
block all the water entrances to Savan*
nah, and the rest will completely close
some other port. By this plan the block
ade squadron will, one after another
be relieved and enabled to accompany
the naval expeditions. A gun boat or
two will be sufficient to watch any
port thus blockaded and prevent the
removal of the obstructions. We pre
sume the -efficiency of the blockade
will soon be demonstrated to the satis
action of Jaff. Davis.
Our cold weather has gone up
and a more mild genial temper ature
threatens to unloose the icy fetters oi

we boasted of has well nigh disappear,

Unable longer to purchase paper, ink and

Cash ox delivery, and also being unable to
procure any species of merchandise except on
the same terms, we are compelled to adopt the
advance system for the Reporter. Our books
show a loss of hundreds of dollars yearly, and
we can no longer stand the drain. Therefore,
on the Ist day of January, 1862, wc shall strike
from our books the names of all who have not
paid in advance. Some who have paid us
promptly within the year may regard this slop
as exacting, but we have to assure thbin that
it is absolutely necessary to do so, and we
trust they will appreciate our situation.
Delinquents will please settle as early as
possible We will take money, wheat, flour,
oats, corn, potatoes, hav, cranberries, shingles,
County, Town and School Orders, orders on
stores, cabbage, potatoes, turnips, •.quash, and
other vegetables — in fact, almost anything
else—even your notes, bearing ten per cent,
interest. Those who cannot pay within a short
time, will please settle by note.
The terras will be $1.60 —invariably in ad
vance. Of course, this rule cannot be applied
to those with whom we have a running book
account.

SEWING MACHINES!!
THE ECONOMY OF USING THE
Franklin Family Sewing Machines!
rpiIESE Machines make the celebrated Gro-
JL ver & Baker stitch, which has taken the
highest premium at the Illinois State Fair, in
September last, at the United States Fair, in
St. Louis, in 1860, and at the principal State
Fairs throughout the country.
Competent Judges gave a decision in favor
of this stitch, on account of its great strength
and adaptation to all kinds of family and man
ufacturing purposes.
Tha following table will show the difference
in favor of Sewing Machines over the old
method of stitching by hand. In the working
of these Machines there is not only a great
saving of labor and time, besides adding great
ly to the healthfulness of the employment, but
the stitch is much stronger, more elastic, and
less liable to rip or ravel than the stitch made
with shuttles and bobbins.

The Franklin Family Sewing Machine
Has one advantage which is worthy of especial
attention, in addition to the peculiar character
of the stitch, and that is its adaptation to ei
ther light or medium heavy work. The Ma
chine which at one moment is used on THE
MOST DELICATE FABRIC, in a few moments
after can be brought to bear with the same fa
cility on cottonades and towels of the coarsest
description. Its adaptation for Family Work
is thus remarkable, and gives it a superiority
over every other style of machine in the mar
ket.
In order that these Machines maybe placed
in the hands of all classes, wo have reduced
the price of our Franklin Family Machine to
Forty Dollars and from the increase of our
business for the last year. The entire satis
faction our Machines are giving throughout
the I'nited States and European Countries, we
are led to believe that our determination to
manufacture a Perfect, Simple, Reliable and
Cheap Machine has been fully appreciated by
the public. This policy will remain unchanged
and as heretofore no Machines will be allowed
to leave the office that we cannot fully warrant
in every respect; we shall keep on hand at all
times a general assortment, of Sewing Machine
materials.
Needles for all machines can be ordered by
Mail or Express. Price one dollar per dozen.
Persons in the country, by sending us their
address enclosing a letter stamp, can have for
warded by return mail, one of our circulars
containing the different styles of Machines, list
of prices, and samples of work.
