Vashington, Dec. 11th.
Gen. Garcia was one of the moat prom

There were no lndl atlons of a verj
atrong "imperial" policy In the Tri
dent's message to congress. Outside o
recommending a large Increase In the
army and navy, the President contented
Minselt by giving an impartial history of
our late unpleasantness with Spain, plac
ing facts and figures at tneulspotal of
Congress and leaving them to shoulder
the responsibilities and deal with thn
new questions arising every day We
telleve this should be the policy of everv
president for he Is but the servant of the
people elected tJ see that the laws are
properly executed not to make them. A
president who seeks to force any person
al policy upon this country Is a danger
cue official and has In the past caused
lots of trouble. Tho representatives ol
the ppop Iq congress elected to mke
the laws of this country are the proper
ones to formulate a policy for this gov
eminent.

CONGRESS At WORK AGAIN.
Second Bestloa of the 05th Congress
Auspiciously Opened
With' immense crowds filling the
galleries and the desks of the members
of both houses loaded with flowers the
opening of the second session of the
55tli congress was almost a gala event.
The diplomatic gallery of the senate
was filled with the representatives ot
the various foreign governments and on
the floor was Lord Herschell, the chief
representative of Great Britain on
tho joint high commission, accom
panied by T. Jefferson Coolidge, of
Massachusetts, Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
Sir Richard Cartwright, Sir Louis
Davies and Mr. Charlton, members of
the commission. Vice-President Ho
bart's gavel sounded for order promptly
at noon -and Rev. Mr. Milburn, the
venerable blind chaplain of the senate,
offered nn impressive prayer. A call '
of the senate developed the presence of
67 members. Af tor the usual prelimi
naries the President's message was
read and soon afterward the Senate
adjourned. Houen. Speaker Reed
opened the Ilouse promptly with 26?
members present. The entrance ol
Maj.-Gen. Wheeler, of Alabama, was
tho occasion of a remarkable demon
stration. After the reading of the
President's message Rep. Cousins, of
Iowa, introduced the first bill of the ses
sion, "declaring the standard of value in
the United States," and providing that
the standard of value in the United
States is hereby declared to ba

25 6-10 grains of standard gold 900 fine.
Rep. Sulzer, of New York, ranking
Democratic member of the house com
mittee on military affairs, has intro

directing the committee on military
affairs to investigate the war depart
ment and the conduct of the Spanish
American war." Gen. Wheeler, of
Alabama, introduced a resolution pro
viding that in "recognition of the pa
triotic devotion and bounteous bencv
oleuce of Miss Ile'ien Miller Gould to
the soldiers of tho army of the United
Statos during the war with Spain, the
thanks of congress are hereby tendered
her and congress hereby authorizes
and directs that a gold medal with ap
propriate designs be prepared by the
director of the mint and that said
medal be presented to her by the Pres
ident of the United States.
During the second day's session Sen
ator Vest, of Mifcsourl, opened the bat
tic in opposition to expansion by in
troducing the following joint resolu
tion:"That under the constitution of the
United States, no power is given to the
federal goiernmcnt to acquire terri
tory to bo held and governed perma
nently as colonics. The colonial sys
tem of European nations cannot be es
tablished under our present constitu
tion, but all territory acquired by tho
the government, except such small
amounts as may bo necessary for
coaling stations, correction of boun
daries, and similar governmental pur
poses, must bo acquired and governed
with the purpose of ultimately organ
izing such territory into states suitable
for admission into tho Union." Navi
gation laws were briefly discussed and
then the Senate adiourncd. Douse.
A session of half an hour was held, at
which the deficiency bill carrying the
extraordinary expenses of the army
and navy from Jan. 1 to July 1, 1899 was
reported. The report of the Ilawaiian
commission was laid before the house
and referred, together with bills of
fered by Mr. Hi it to carry out the
recommendations of the commission.
Senator Hoar precipitated a lengthy
debate when he opposed the appoint
ment by the Preildent of senators as
members of commissions whose acts
would have to be passed upon by
the senate. The confirmation of tho
appointment of the Ilawaiian commis
sioners was under discussion at tho
time, and the matter was finally re
ferred to the judiciary committee, with
instructions to investigate and report.
The house passed the anti-ticket
scalping bill by a rote of 119 to 101.
Congressman Corliss made a warm
fight and two speeches for his amend
ment to prevent railroads themselves
from continuing the scalping business
after the law takes away that business
from the scalpers now conducting it,
but was knocked out.
Rep. Hull, chairman of the houso
committee on military affairs, intro
duced a bill increasing the regular
army to approximately 100,000 men.
The bill was framed at the war de
partment and is not the bill framed bf
Gen. Miles. It gives a total of 14 regi
ments of artillery, 12 of cavalry and 30
of infantry.
Senator Morrill presented a petition
from the legislature of Vermont, ask
ing for the revival of the grade of ad
miral, and recognition of Rear Admiral
Dcwcy. Mr. Hale presented a bill to
revive the grades of admiral and vice
admiral. Rep. Todd, of Michigan, introduced
t resolution tendering the thanks of
congress to the ofllcers and men of the
North Atlantic squadron and the army
of Cuba invasion for the meritorious
Rcrvice performed by them.
Congressman Corliss introdnccd in
the house the bill providing for the
erection of a bridge across the Detroit
river. Senator McMillan has presented

Senator Klklns introduced bills ex
tending the laws relating to customs,
commerce and navigation to tho Ha
waiian islands and Porto Rico,
Senator Hawley offered a bill on the
lines suggrsted by Gen. Miles for the
reorganization of the army with 100,000

from the sale of the ships and their
cargoes Uncle Sam has realised
5701,034.

Hen ptrt In the best years of their lives
la the pursuit of riches. One class works
with the head, and the other with the mus
cles. Each cares more for dollars than for
health. The brain is taxed to the utmost
In evolv
ing and excuting
schemes, and the
bodv is worn out with
constant, unremitting toil. Just about the
time a man 6tops to take account of things,
he finds the dollars have come, but health
has departed. Then he reverses matters
completely. He devotes the rest of his life
to spending his dollars to regain his health.
What a man with worn-out body and
tired brain needs most of all is a (rood
stomach. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery is the proper remedy to set the
stomach right This medicine will make
his appetite good, make his weak stomach
6trong and help it to digest the food he puts
into it. Good digestion makes pure blood,
and pure blood vitilizes the whole system.
This great remedy also cures those who
have sore throat, a persistent cough, weak
and bleeding lungs and bronchitis, all of
which often arise from weak stomach and
consequent indigestion. It is a cleansing,
strengthening, puriGying, invigorating al
terative tonic. It puts life into the blood
and nerves, into the brain and body. It
cures every form of indigestion, makes the
sleep sound, and nerves steady. There is
nothing so good, and you should refuse all
substitutes offered by dealers.
I had catarrh for four years and also liver
and kidney trouble," writes John A. Calloway,
Ksq., of No. ai8 26th Street, Columbus, Ga.,
"when It would commence troubling me, X

chest. In 1804 I broke out in lumps all over and
when these left the skin peeled off. I took six
bottles of Dr. Tierce's Golden Medical Discovery,
two bottles of his ' Tit asaut TeUets, and I be

" I had a severe catarrhal trouble, and

weighed only 96 pounds. I had suoh
severe pains in my head that I feared I
should become insane. I tried external
remedies without obtaining relief. Fin
ally I was inspired to give Hood's Sarsa-
parilla a trial, and I am very grateful to
the proprietors of this wonderful med

has cured me, after I had been an invalid

HEBREW FLAQS FLYING.
SiantUrd Adopted at Zionist Congress
Seen In New York.
One of the results of the Zionist con
gress at Basle is the reappearance of
the Hebrew flag.- At the meeting place
of the delegates a flag was hoisted
which had two blue stripes on a white
field, and between these the six
pointed star, or sign of David. It was
explained at that time that a similar
flag was used as the standard of the
Hebrews in the days of the Hebrew
nation. Pictures and descriptions of
tho flag came to the United States with
accounts of the proceedings of the
congress, and dwellers in the New
York Ghetto began to look for Hebrew
flags. The consequence was that the
American Flag Company turned out a
Quantity, for which there was a ready
sale, and one large flag of the peculiar
style has attracted much attention in
Henry street, where It has been mis
taken for everything from a Salvation
army flag to a Tammany emblem.

Animals That Never Drink.
There are in the world several kinds
of animals that have never swallowed
a drop of water in all their lives. These
include the llamas of Patagonia and
certain gazelles of the far east. A !
paroquet lived fifty-two years in the
London zoological gardens without
drinking a drop, and some naturalists .
think that hares take no liquid except !
the dew that sometimes forms on the 1
grass that they eat. A considerable ;
number of reptiles serpents, lizards
and certain batraclans live and pros
per In places where there is no water
at all. Finally, there are even in
France, in the neighborhood of the
Lozere, herds of cows and goats which
almost never drink, and which never
theless produce the milk of which thw
famous Roquefort cheese Is made.
Criminals.
Among every 1,000 bachelors there
are thirty-eight criminals; among mar
ried men the ratio is enly eighteen per
