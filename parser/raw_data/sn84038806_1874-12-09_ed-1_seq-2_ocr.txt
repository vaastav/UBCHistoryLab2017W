CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIAL PAPER.
WEDNESDAY DEC. 0. IS7L
Thk track of the Southern Pacific
road is now laid about six miles this
side of Bakersfleid.
It costs S2"> per day to keep a team
of horses at Panamint. Hny Is hay
out there.
Key. Mr. Messenger, of San
Gabriel, lately Imported from Pan:.ma
byway of experimeut, several hun
dred -mall pine apple plants. They
are now several Inches out of the
ground nnd give promise of doing well.
On: evening cotemporary says the
secret history of Monday's election
would make an interesting pamphlet.
We venture to say that there is at
least one chapter iv th« secret history
of the campaign which it would not
like to have made public.
The tri-weekly line of stages run
ning between Kernville and Pana
mint cannot accommodate the travel
toward the mines. Seats are engaged
days ahead. The line is daily be
tween Bakcrsficld aud Kernville and
it is said the stage will run daily
through to Panamint short time.
Wk owe an apology to our country
readers. City politics do not as a gen
eral tiling prove a theme of interest to
people outside of the little world cir
cumscribed by corporation lines; and
for the last few weeks the editorial
columns of the Herald have con
tained little else than municipal poli
tics. That is happily at an end for the
time, and we shall now devote our
columns to subjects of more general
interest to our readers outside ot tlie
city. .
THE Courier says a party of engi
neers passed through Bakersfield on
their way to Tebachepa last week.
They are to construct a wagon road
somewhere in that vicinity, where the
railroad will terminate, to connect
with the mines of Cerro Gordo and
Panamint. Stanford & Co. have
fully determined to secure the trade of
that region at as early a Jay as possi
ble. This is a suggestive fact to the
people of Los Angeles county. The
Lord helps those who help themselves.
A Valuable Map.
Engineer Crawford has nearly
completed a map which la an interest
ing study to tho people of Southern
California, and especially so to those
of Los Angeles and San Bernardino
counties. It is nine fest square and
contains eighty-one superficial feet. It
shows an area of country 200 miles
square. Starting from San Diego, it
gives the coast line up to and includ
ing Santa Barbara, and north and
ea.'it as far as Independence, Panamint,
Death valley and the sink of the Mo
have. The valleys, mountains, towns,
railroads, stage roads, water courses
and mountain passes are all accurately
located ;md the whole region so care
fully iiiapfMM out that one sees the
broad extent of couutry at a glance
and us (dearly as the section of a pan
orama. It is a valuable piece of work.
San Fernando Town and Valley.
San Fernando valley will soon be a
broad grain field. Some two thousand
acres will be seeded in wheat this sea- '
son, and nearly or quite as many
acres will be sown in barley and other
small grain. A considerable area will
be planted in corn in the Spring. All
this is done in a valley which last year
was used for grazing purposes. The
town of San Fernando which is quite a
respectable village in size is a produc
tion of 1874. It is increasing rapidly
in population and buildings, and will
in a short time, become quite a busi
ness place. A great deal of wheat
sown is already above ground and
gives promise of an abundant harvest.
Being protected by the hills from the
damp air of the coast, San Fernando
valley is well adapted to wheat grow
ing, and will, wo predict, ultimately
produce annually a large quantity of
small grain. The soil is excellent,and
increased irrigating facilities will in
sure large yields to the farmer.
The Danger of Procrastination.
It is more than probable that if na
ture had not made of Cajon Pass an
easy gateway through which we could
reach the country beyond the range
of mountains which enrich us on the
North and East, our people would
never have done complaining that we
had no passage way through the rug
ged barrier, and we should exclaim
with one voice that if we only had a
way hewn through the rocks, how
soon we should build a railroad which
would secure us the trade of the rich
mining section of Inyo county. But,
strange as it may seem, we by our
masterly inactivity are doing all that
man can do in the way of closing up
the rift which nature has cl«ft through
the mountain chain. By our tardi
ness we are losing a large trade which
naturally belongs to us. We have the
natural route for a railroad, but we
lack the energy and enterprise to
build the road. We are closing the
pass and ehutting ourselves out from
commercial intercourse with the
richest and perhaps the most exten
sive mineral belt on this continent. A
vast trade which is legitimately ours
is rapidly being diverted to other and
more distant market*. We cannot
much longer delay the great work of
building the Los Angelea and Inde
pendence Railroad. We must build
the road, or rest content with a trade
that does not extend further interior
than San Bernardino.
Dealing Gently with the Erring.
Custom ami common content "an
ally accordseonnitlerahlo growling lat
itude to the leaders of a defeated party
and as we feci just now in a very good
humor With ourselves aud all the
world beside*, wo are willing that the
Express shall scratch its sore head and
vent Its dissatisfaction for a whole
week; but while doing this we shall
insist that it keeps within the con
fines of truth, or as nearly so as its
dazed eyes and soured disposition will
permit. "We shall gently lead it back
to the path of rectitude, from which
it has so widely strayed of late and in
the performance Of this kindly task
we shall commence with an error and
self-contradiction in its yesterday's
issue. Iv an attempt to explain why
one of its candidates for Mayor was
not elected, it charges that the elec
tion was carried by money and that
votes were purchased at prices ranging
from S2 50 to $5 each. Further on In
the same article it says there was con
siderable hanging back by those who
believed votes would command a
higher price later in the afternoon.
This contradiction of itself we pass to
explain why the vote was less than
auticlpated. There was a more gen
eral expression of sentiment than is
usually seen at an election in
this city. The vote was ou principle
by men whose votes could not be pur
chased. The purchasable vote—those
voters who usually come to the polls
late in the day and vote in little
squads—did not vote on Monday.
There were several hundred of this
class whose ballots did not reach the
box. Their failure to connect was
due to this fact: Early in the forenoon
the opponents of Mr. Beaudry real
ized the hopelessness of their case and
despaired of defeating him. They saw
that the purchasable vote would not
help them out and wisely concluded
to throw away no more money on a
hopeless case. The people's candi
dates would not buy votes and the re
sult was that the piece voters not
finding a purchaser held ofTuntil eve
ning and the polls closed on them
with their votes still on the market.
We are assured by old residents that
the eleotion on Monday was a fairer
expression of the people than has
been witnessed In this city for many
years. The purchasable vote is the
one that was not counted.
Humboldt in His Study.
Those who have seen the admirable
colored lithograph of Hildebrant's
picture know precisely how the room
looks. There was the plain table, the
writing-desk, covered with letters and
manuscript, the little green scfa and
the same maps and pictures on the
drab-colored walls. The pictures had
been so long hanging in my own room
at home, that I at once recognized
each particular object. Seifert went
to the inner door, announced my
name, and Humboldt immediately
appeared. He came up to me with a
heartiness and cordiality which made
me feel I was in the presence of a
friend, gave me his hand and inquired
whether we should converse in Eng
lish or German. " Your letter," said
he, "was that of a German, and you
must certainly speak the language fa
miliarly; but I am also in a constant
habit of using English." He insisted
on my taking one end of the grr-en
sofa, observing that he rarely sat upon
it himself; then drew up a plain cane
bottomed chair and seated himself by
it, asking me to speak a little louder
than usual, as his bearing was not so
acute as formerly. As I looked at the
majestic old man, the line of Tenny
son, describing "Wellington, came into
my mind—
Oh, good grey head, which all men knew.
The first impression made by Hum
boldt's face was that of a broad and
genial humanity. His massive brosv,
heavy witb the gathered wisdom of
nearly a century, bent forward ami
overhung his breast like a ripe ear of
corn; but as you looked below it, a
pair of clear blue eyes, almost as
bright and steady as a child's, met
yours. In those eyes you read that
trust in man, that immortal youtn of
the heart, which made the snows of
eighty-seven winters lie so lightly on
his head. You trusted him utterly at
the first glance, and felt that he would
trust you, if you were worthy of it. I
had approached him with a natural
feeling of reverence, but in five min
utes I found that I loved him and that
I could talk witb him as freely as with
a friend of my own age. His nose,
mouth and chin had the heavy Teu
tonic character, whose genuine type
has always expressed an honest sim
plicity and directness. I was almost
surprised by the youthful character of
his face. I knew that he had been
frequently Indisposed during the year
and had been told that he was begin
ning to show the marks of extreme
age; but I should not have suspected
him of being over seventy-five. His
wrinkles were few and small, and his
skin had a smoothness and delicacy
rarely seen in old men. His hair, al
though snow white, was still abund
ant, his step slow but firm, and his
manner active almost to restlessness.
He slept but four hours out of the
twenty-four, read and replied to his
daily letters, and suffered no single oc
currence of the least interest in auy
part of the world to escape his atten
tion. 1 could not conceive that his
memory, the first mental faculty to
show decay, waa at all impaired. He
talked rapidly, with the greatest ap
parent ease, never hesitating for a
word, whether in English or iv Ger
man, and in fact seemed to be uncon
scious which language he was using,
as he changed four or five times dur
ing the conversation. He did not re
main in his chair more than ten min
utes at a time, frequently getting up
and walking about the room, now aud
then opening a book or pointing to a
picture to illustrate a remark.— From
the Life of Alexander yon Humboldt. J

New Orleans, December 7th.—
Dispatches from Vieksburg report
lighting between the whites and tlie
negroes. The origin of fhe trouble is
a dispute between the citizens and the
county officials. The Sheriff, a negro
named Crosby, Is acting without giv
ing bonds. The Board"of Supervisor*
refused to order a new election and
several county officials are under in
dictment. The citizens went to the
Court House to demand their resigna
tion. They all fled except the Sheriff,
who resigned. This created an excite
ment amongst the negroes, who, in
order to reinstate the Sheriff, marched
on the town, to the number of 750,
The citizens assembled and drove
them back, with a loss of 20 killed, 20
wounded and 40 prisoners. One white
man was killed. The negroes aro now
raiding in the country, burning gin
houses and dwellings.

situation here is critical. Crosby, the

Merckd, F)ecCTrrtier -7th. — This
morning Edward Madden, editor of
the Merced Tribune, was shot dead on
the street by Harry Granice, step-son
of J. R. Steele, of the San Soaquin
Argus. A contest going on between
the two papers had been carried to the
extent of bitter personalities, which
provoked the murder. Granice shot
Madden from behind without warn

threats have been made to lynch

done, unless he is removed to safer
