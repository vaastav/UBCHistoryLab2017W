The third article of the treaty with Russls, of
.March 80,1£67, by which Alaska was ceded to the
lUaited States, provides that the inhabitant* of
.the ceded territory, with the •seeption of the un
jCivitlzed native tribes, shall he admitted to the
(enjoyment of all the rights of cfeieetM of the Unit
ed States, and shall be maintained and protested
In the freo enjoyment of their libertjr, property
and religion. The uncivilized tribes are subject
to such Jaws and regulations as tbo United States
may frota time to time adopt in regard to the ah
original iribes of that country.
1
Botit the obligations of this treaty and the ne
cessities of the people, require that borne organ
ised form of jiovernmem over the territory of
Alaska be adopted.
There appears to be no law for the arreet of
persons cbaxged with common-law offenouti, such
as assault, robbery, and murder, and no uifcgi*

arisen from offonces of this character, not only
aiHonpj the original inhabitants, but among citi
zens of thoUaltod states and other couutrl6g,
who h«ve engaged in mining, fishing, and olb*«
business operations within the territory. A bit!
authorising the appointment of justices of tfia
peace and constables, and tho arrest and deten

THE TKB*9UnV J1EPARTMINT.
The attention of congress is called to the an
nual report of the secretary of the treasury on the
condition of the puolic ttniinees.
The ordinary revenues from nil sources for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1879, were $273,827,.
184.46 the ordinary expenditures for the same
period were $*26t,917,883 53: leaving a surplus
revenue for the year of $6,879,300.03.
The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending
June 30, 18H0, actual and estimated, are as fol
lows Actual receipts for the first quarter, com
mencing July 1,1879, $79,843,663.61 estimated re
ceipts lor the remaining three-quarters of the
year, $203,156,336 39 total receipts for the current
fiscal year, actual and estimated, $288,000,000.
The expenditures for the same period will be,
actual and estimated, as follows: For the quar
ter commencing July 1, 1879, actual expendi
tures, $91,683 385.10 and for the remaining three
quarters of the year the expenditures are esti
mated at $172.316,614.90—making tho total ex
penditures $264,000,000, and leaving an estimated
isurplus revenue for the year ending June 30,1880,
of $24,000,000. The total receipts during the next
fiscal year, ending June 3), 1831, estimated ac
cording to existing laws, will be $288,000,000
'and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the
same period will be $278,097,364.39—leaving a sur
plus of $9,902,635.61 for that year.
The large amount expended for arrears of pen
sions during the last and the present fiscal year,
amounting to $21,747,249.60, has prevented the ap
plication of the full amount required by law to
the sinking fund for the current year but these
arrears having been substantially paid, it is be
lieved that the sinking fnnd can hereafter be
maintained without any change of existing law.
TUB WAB DEFAK'l'MBNT.
The secretary of war reports that the war de
partment estimates lor tbe fiscal yearending June
30,1881, are 540,880,428.93, the same being for a
less sum of money than any annual estimate ren
dered to congress from that department during
a period of at least twelve years.
He concurs with the general of the army ia
recommending such legislation as will authorize
the enlistment of the fall number of twenty-five
thousand men for the line of tbe army, exclusive
of tbe three thousand' four hundred and sixty
lhree men required for detached duty, and there
fore not available for service in the field.
He else recommends that congress be asked to
provide by Itw for the disposition of a large num
ber of abandoned military posts and reservations,
which, though very valuable in themselves, have
been rendered useless lor milit ry purposes by
the advance of civilization and settlement.
He unites with the quartermaster general in
recommending that an appropriation be made for
the construction of a cheap and perfectly fire
proof building for the safe storage of a vast
amount of money accounts, vouchers, claims and
other valuanle records now in the quartermaster
general's office, and exposed to great risk of total
destruction by fire.
He also recommends, in conformity with the
views of the judge-anvoeate general, some dec
laratory legislation in reference to the military
statute of limitations as applied t.i the crime oI
cteeertion.
In these several recommendations 1 concur.
The Secretary of War further reports,othat tho
work for the improvement of the south pass of tho
Mississippi river, undcrxontract with Mr. James
B. Eads. made in pursuance of an act of congress,
has been prosecuted during the past year, with a
greater measure of success in the attainment of
results than during any previous year. Tho
channel through the south pass, which, at tho
beginning of operations in June, 1875, had a depth
lof only seven and one-half feet of water, had, on
the 8tn of July, 1879, a minimum depth of twenty,
six fsct, having a width of not less than two hun
dred feet, and a central depth of thirty feet. Pay-*
ments have been made in accordance with the
statute, as the work progressed, amounting in tho
aggregate to $4,250,000 and further payments
(Will become due, as provided by the statute, in
the event of maintaining lhc channel now se
cured.
ARM* OPERATIONS.
The report of the General of the Aimy and oj
I his subordinates, present a full and detailed ac
count of the military operations for the suppress
sion of hostilities among the Indians of the Utej
and Apache tribes, and praise is justly awarded
I to the officers and troops engaged, for promptness,
skill and courage displayed.
The past year has been one of almost unbroken
.peace and quiet on the Mexican frontier, and there
is reason to believe that the efi'orts of this govern
ment and of Mexico, to maintain order in that re
gion, will prove permanently successful.
This department was enabled during the past
year to find temporary though crowded accommo
dations, and a safe depository for a portion of its
records, in the completed east wing of the build
ling, designed for the state, war and navy depart
ments. Tho construction of the north wing oi the
building, ajpart of the structure intended lor the
use of the war department, is being carried for
w-ayd with all possible dispatch, and the work
should receive Irom congress such liberal appro
priations as will seenre iis speedy completion.
THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows
co$titiued improvement in that branch of the ser
'vifce during the last fiscal year. Extensive repairs
,have been mado upon vessels, and two new ships
have been completed and made ready for sea.
The total expenditures of the year ended June
30,18«9, including specific appropriations not estl
mated for by the department, were $13,t5ft,7HU9.
TBasxpenses chargeable to the year, after deduct
ing tbe amount of these specific appropriations.
were tw,343,317.79 but thte is subject to reduction
or$283,7W,9», that amount having been drawn upon
.warrants, but not paid cuc during the year. The
.amount of appropriations applicable to the last
fiscal year was $14,538,646.17. Tlufre was, therefore,
[a balance of $l,479,03137remainingunexpended.and
to tbe ezetiit oj tbe department, on June, 30. 1879.
jThe estimates for the fisearyeccr ending June 30,
18H, are $14,883,147*%, Which oxoeetfa the appropri
ations for the present iisoalyear $361,897.28. The
reason fbr this fnorease Is explained In the secre
tary's report. Thq approprfatlons available for
tlie present ftsew year are |U,502,250.67, which will,
In the opIntM&aT tbo secretary, answer ail the or
dinary uemandsof thessrriee. The amount drawn
from the treasury from July 1 to November 1, 1879,
was $9,770,401.12, of which $1,035,440.33 has been re
funded, leavng the expenditure for that period'
SM,64,w3,79. If tlie expenditures of the remaining
two-tlHrOs of tho year do not exceed the propor
tion for thessfour months, there will remain un
expended, at the end of the year, $477,358.30 of the
current appropriations. The report of the secre
tary Shows the gratifying 'fact that among all tbo
disbursing officers or te pay corps of tne navy,
there Is not one who is a defaulter to the extent of
single dollar. I unite with him in recommend
ing the removal of tbe observatory to a more
healthful location, xij.it institution reflects cred
it upon the nation, and has obtained the approba
tion of scientific men in all parts of the world.
Its removal from Its present location would not
only be conducive to the health of its officers and
professors, but would greatly Increase its useful
ness.
DJtPARTMEJTT Or JUSTICE
The appropriation for Judicial expenses, which
baa heretofore been made for the department of
Justice, in gross, was subdivided at the last session
of congress, and no appropriation whatever was
made for the payment of the fees of marshals and
their deputles,efther In the servtce of process or for
the discharge of other duties and, since June 30.
,these officers have continued the performance of
their duties without compensation from the.gov
ernment. taking upon themselves necessary mel
dental outlays, as well as rendering their own ser
vices. In only a few unavoidable Instances, has
the proper execution of the process of tbe United
States failed by reason of the absence of the re
quisite appropriation, This course of official con
duct on the part of toese officers, highly eredlta
We to their fidellty, was advised by tne attorney
general, who Informed them, however, that they
would necessarily have to rely for their
compensa
tion upon the prospect or future legislation by
congress. I therefore recommend that immediate
appropriation be made by congress for this pur
pose.
The act making the princtpsl appropriation for
Mir**""*""."* Of UlUCe at nravinn« ho.
uniformly contained the fallowing clause: "And'
for defraying the expenses which may be incurred
in tbe enforcement of the act approved February
28,1870, entitled 'An act to amend an act approved
May 80,1870, entitled 'An act to enforce the right
of citizens of the United States to vote in the sev
eral states in the United States, and for other
purposes,' or any acts amendatory thereof or sup
plementary thereto."
No appropriation was made for this purpose for
the current year. As no general election for mem
bers of congress occurred, the omission was a
matter of little practical importance. Such elec
tion will, however, take place during the ensuing
year, and the appropriation made ior the pay 3
marshals and deputies should be sufficient to em
brace compensation for the services they may be
required to perform at such elections.
The business of the supreme court is, at pres
ent, largely in arrears. It eanaot be expected
that tnore causes can be decided than are now
disposed of in its annual session, or that by any
assiduity the distinguished magistrates who com
pose the court can accomplish more than is now
done. In the courts of many of the circuits, also,
the business has increased to such an extent, that
the delay of justice will call the attention of con*
Kress to an appropriate remedy. It is believed
that all is done in each circuit which can fairly 1«
expected from its judicial force. The evils aris
ing from delay are lees heavily felt by the United
States than by private puitors, as its causes arc
advanced by t.he court when it is seen that they
Involve the discussion of questions of a public
character.
The remedy suggested by the attorney genera!,
is the appointment of additional circuit judge?,
and the creation of an intermediate court ol'errois
and appeals, which xiiail relieve the supreme
court of a part of Its jurisdiction, while a larger
force is also obtained for the performance of cir
cuit duties.
I commend this suggestion to the consideration
of congress. It would seem 10afford a complete
remedy, and would involve, if ten additional cir
cuit judges are appointed, an expenditure, at the
bresenc rate of salaries, o£ not more than sixty
thousand dollars a year, which would certainly be
small lu comparison with the objects to be at
tained.
THI POSTAL DEPARTMENT.
The report of the postmaster general bears tes
timony to the geuerai revival of business through
out the country. The receipts of the post office de
partment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879.
were »30,0ir,82 86, bein" $765,465 91 mora than tlie
revenues of the preceding year. The amount re
alized from the sale of postage stamps, stamped
envelopes, and postal cards, was $764.4t$ 91 more
than iu the preceding ear, and $2,387,559 23 more
than in 1877. The expenditures ot the department
were $31,449,899 45,:of which the sum Of 376.461 63
was paid on liabilities incurred in preceding
years.
Tne expenditures during the year were |801,
299 77 less than intne iireci-ding \ear. This reduc
tion is to be attributed mainly to the operation of
the law passed une 17,187?, changing the compen
sation of postmasters from a com miss ion on the
value of stamps sold, to a cotumlsson on stamps
cancelled.
The amount drawn from the treasury on appro
priations In addition to tli« revenues of the depart
ment was &, 031,455 9C„ belug $2,276,197 less than
the preceding year
^The expenditures for the fiscal year ending
Juno30,1881, are estimated at $39,»2u.9C0. and the
receipts from all sources at 132,210 0U), leaving a
deficiency to be appropriated for, out ol the treas
ury, Of $7.710,900.
The relations of the department with railroad
companies nave been harmonized, notwithstand
ing the general reduction by congress offtheir
compensation, by the appropriation for special
facilities, and the railway post-office lines have
been greatly extended, especially In the southern
states. The lutcrests of the railway mail service
and of ffle public would be greatly nromotsd, and
the expenditures comdbe more readily controlled
by the classification of tlie employes ol" the rail
way mall service as recommended by the post
master-geueral, the annropriation for salaries,
with rcspect to which tbe maximum limit is al
ready fixed by law. to be made in gross.
The postmaster general recommends an amend
ment of*tbe law regulating the increase of com
pensation for Increased service and increased'
Bpeed on itur routes, so as to enable him to ad
vertise for proposals for such increased service
and speed. He also suggests the advantages to
accrue to the commerce of the country from the
enactment of a general law authorizing contracts
with American-bnilt steamers, carrying the
American flag, for transporting the mail between
ports of the United States and ports of
the West Indies and South America, at
a fixed maximum price per mile, tbe amount to
be. expended being regulated bv annual appro-'
prlatlons, in like maaner with the amount paid
for the domestic star service.
The arrangement made by the ostm utor gen*
eral and the aecretary of the treasury tor u.o col
lection of duty upon books received la the mail
from foreign countries, has proved so satisfactory
la its practical operation that the recommoada*
tion is now made, that congress shall extend the
provisions of the act of March 3. 1879, under
which this arrangement was made, so as to appiy
to all other dutiable articles received in malis
from foreign countries.
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
The reports of the secretary of tbe interior and
of the commissioner of Indian affairs, setting
lorth the present state of our relations with the
Indian tribes on our territory,the measures
to advance their civilization and prosperity, and
the progress already achieved by them, will be
found of more than ordinary interest. The gen
eral conduct ot our Indiau population has been
so satisfactory that the occurrence of two dis
turbances, which resulted in bloodshed and de
stauction of property is all the more to be la
mented.
The history of the outbreak on tbo White River
Ute reservaiton in Western Colorado has become
so familiar by elaborate reports in the public
press, that its remarkable incidents need not be
stated here in detail. It is expected that the
settlement of this difficulty will lead to such ar
rangements as will prevent further hostile con
tact between the Indians and the border settle
ments in Western Colorado.
1
The other disturbance occurred at the Mas
calero agency, in New Mexico, where Victoria,
the head of a small band of maraudeis, after
committing manv atrocities, being vigorously
chased by a military force made his way across
the Mexican border and Is now on foreign soil.
While these occurrenbes. In which a compara
tively small number of Indians were engaged, are
most deplorable, a vast majority of our Indian
population have fully justified tho expectations
of those who believe that by human ana peaceful
influence the Indian can be led to abandon the
habits of savage life and to develop a capacity
for useful and civilized occupations. What they
have already accomplished in the pursuit of ag
ricultural and mechanical work, tho remarkable
success which has attended the experiment of
employing as freighters a class of Indians hitner
to counted among the wildest and most intract
able, and the general and urgent desire expressed
by them for the education of their children, may
be taken as sufficient proof that thry will be
found capable of accomplishing much more if
,w»ey continue to be wisely and fairlr guided.
tThe "Indian policy," sketched lu tbe report of tho
secretary or the interior, the otgect of which Is to
make liberal provision for the education of the
Indian youth, is to settle the Indians upon farm
lots in severalty, to give them title in fee to their
farms, Inalienable for a certain number ot years,
and when their wants are thus provided for, to
dispose by sale of the lands on tnelr reservations
not occupied and used by them, a fund to be
formed out of the proceeds for the benefit of the
Indians, which will gradually relieve the govern
ment of the expenses now provided for by
appropriations, must commend itself as just and
beneficial to the Indians, and as also calculated
to remove those obstructions which the exist
ence of large reservations presents to the settle
ment and development of the conntry. I there
fore earnestly recommend the enactment of a law
enabling the government to give Indians a title
in fee, inalienable for twenty-five years, to the
form-lands assigned to them by allotment. I
also repeat the lecommendatioa made in my first
«nuual message, that a law be passed admitting
Indians who can give satisfactory proof of having,
by thetr own labor, supported their ifamilles for
a number of years, and who are willing to detach
themselves from their tribal relations, to the
benefit of tho homestead act, and to grant them
patents containing tbe same provision of inalien
ability for a certain period.
The experiment of sending a number of Indian
chudrcn. of both sexes, to the Hampton Normal
and. Agricultural Institute, in Virginia, to receive
anelementaiy English education and practical in
struction In farming and other useful industries,
has led to results so
promising, that it was thought
expedient to turn over the cavalry barracks at
Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to the interior depart
ment for the establishment of an Indian Bchool
on a larger scale. The school has now one hun
dred and firty.elght pupils, selected froth various
tribes, and is in full operation. Arrangements
are also made for the education of a number of
Indian boys and girls belonging to tribes on the
Pacific slope, In a similar manner, at Forest
Grove, in Oregon. These Institutions will com
mend themselves to the liberality of congress, and
to the philanthropic munificence of the American
people.
INDIAN TEBEITORT RAID.
Last spring. Information was received of the or
ganization of an extensive movement In the
western states, the object of which was the occu
patlon by unauthorized persons of certain lands
thn Indian TfeTT^IT ceded bf the Cherokee* to
the government for the purpose of settlemehTby
other Indian tribes.
Oa the fflth of April, I Issued a proclamation
warning all persons against participation in such
an attempt, and, by tne co-operation of a mili
tary force, the invasion was promptly checked.
It is my purpose to protect the rights ot the In
dian inhabitants of that territory to the full ex«
tent of the executive power. But it would be
unwise to ignore the faet that a territory so large
and so fertile, with a population so sparse and
with so greatj a wealth of unused resources, will
be found more exposed to the repetition of such
attempts as happened this year, when the sur
rounding states are more densely settled, and tbe
westward movement of our population looks still
more eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under
BUCU circumstances the difficulty of maintaining
the Indian territory in its present state will great
ly increase, and tbe Indian tribes inhabiting it
would do well to prepare for sueh a contingency.
I, therefore, fullv approve of the advice giveu to
them by tbe secretary of the interior on a recent
occasion, to divide among themselves in several
ty as large a quantity of their lands, as tbey can
cultivate, to acquire individual title in foe, in
stead ot their present tribal ownership in com
mon, and to consider in what manner the balance
of their lands may be disposed of by the govern
ment for their benefit. By adopting such a policy
they would more certainly secura for themselves
the value of their possessions, and at the sam«
time promote their progress iu civilization^cd
prosperity, than by endeavoring to perpetuato
the present state of things in the territory.
The question Wlieihci ,.nge in the control
of the Indian eerviee sm-u. ..u made, was in the
foity-ntth congress reit-.i H-d to a joint committee'
'of both houses for inquiry .-tud report. In my
last annual message 1 \pie..s»ed the hope that
.the decision of that que-r ou. then in prospect,
"would arreet further imitation of thin subject,
such agitation being apt to induce a disturbing
effect upon the service a* a ell as the Indians
ihemselves." Since then, ims committee having
reported, tbe question his oeeu decided iu the
negative by a vote in ti.e house of representa
tives.
For the reasons here Pti-.tid, and In view of the
fact that further uncertainty ou this point will Ife
calculated to obstruct other lunch-needed legis
lation, to weaken tfce discipline of the service,
and to unsettle salutary measures now in pro
gress for the government aad improvement of
the Indians, I respectlully recommend that the
decision arrived at by congrcss at its last session
be permitted to eland.
r'
TIMBER TRESPASSES.
The efforts made by the department of the in
terior to arrest tbe depredations on the timber
lands of the United States have been continued,
and have met with considerable success. A large
number of cases of trespass have been pros
ecuted in the courts of the United States others
have been settled, the traspasscrs offering to make
payment to tha government for the value of the
timber taken by them. The proceeds of these
prosecutions and settlements turned into the
treasury, far exceed in amount the sums appro
priated by congrass for this purpose. A more im
portant result, however, consists in the fact that
the destruction of our public forests by depreda
tion, although such cases still occur, has been
greatly reduced in extent, and it is probable that
if the present policy is vigorously pursued and
sufficient provision to that end is made by con
gress, such trespasses, at least those on a large
scale, can be entirely suppressed, except in tne
territories where timber for the daily require
ments of the population cannot, under the pres
ent state of the law, be otherwise obtained. I
therefore earnestly invito the attention of con
gress to the recommendation made by the Secre
tary of the Interior, that a law be enacted enab
ling the government to sell timber from the pub
lic lands without conveying the fee, where such
lands are principally valuable for the timber
thereon, such sales to be BO regulated as to con
form to domestic wants and ^business require
ments, while at the same time guarding against a
sweeping destruction of the forests. The enact
ment of such a law appears to bccome a more
pressing necessity every day.
AGBICULTURK.
My recommendations in former messages are
renewed in favor of enlarging the facilities of the
department of agriculture. Agriculture is the
leading interest and tbe permanent industry of
our people. It is to the abundance of agricul
tural production, as compared with our home
consumption, and the largely increased aud
highly profitable market abroad which we have
enjoyed in recent years, that we are mainly in
depted for our present prosperity as a people. We
must look for its continued maintenance to the
same substantial resource. There is no branch
of industry in which labor, directed by scientiflc
knowledge, yields such increased production in,
comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch
of the pnblic service to which the encouragement
of liberal-appropriations can be. more appropri
ately extended. The omission to render such
aid is not a wise economy but, on tho contrary,'
undoubtedly results in losses of immense sums
annually that might be saved through well-direct
ed efforts of the government to promote this
vital interest.
The results already accomplished with the very
limited means heretofore placed at the command
of the department of agriculture is an earnest of
what may be expected with Increased appropria
tions for the several purposes indicated in the re
port of tho commissioner, with a view to placing
the department upon a footing which will enable
it to prosecute more effectively the objects for
which it is established.
Appropriations are needed for a more complete
labratory for tbe establishment oi a veterinary
division, and a division of forestry, and for an in
crease of forcc.
The requirements for these and other purposes,
Indicated in the report of the commissioner un
der the head of tbe immediate necessities of the
department, will not involve any expendlttre of
money that the country caanot with propriety
now undertake in the interests of agricultuie.
EDUCATION.
It is gratifying to learn from the bureau of edu
cation the extent to which educational privileges
throughout the Uuiteo States have been advanced
during the year. No more fundamental re
sponsibility rests upon congress than that of
devising appropriate measures of financial
aid to education, suplemental to local action in
the states and territories, and in the District of
Columbia. The wise forethought of the founders
of our government has not only furnished tlie
basis for the support of the common school sys
tems of the newer states, but laid the foundations
for the maintenance of their univcrsitias and col
leges of agriculture and mechanic artB. Meas
ures in accordance with this traditional policy fori
.the further benefit of all these interests, and tho'
extension of the same advantages to every por
tion of the country, it is hoped, will receive your
favorable consideration.
rUBLIO LIBRARY.
To preserve and perpetuate the national litera-.
ture should be among the foremost cares of the
national legislature. The library gathered at the
captiol still remains nnprovided with any suitable
accommodations for its rapidly Increasing stores.
The magnitude and importance of the collection,
increased as it is by the deposits made under the
law of copyright, by domestic and foreign ex
changes, and bv tne scientific library of tho
Smithsonian Institution, call for building accom
modations which shall be at once adequate and
fire-proof. The location of such a public build
ing, which should provide for the pressing neces
sities of the present, and for the va6t increase of
the nation's books in the future, is a matter which
addresses itself to the discretion of congress. It
is earnestly recommended as a measure which
6hould unite all suffrages, and which should no
longer be delayed.
WASHINGTON MONUMENT.
The joint commission created by the act of con
gress of August 2, 1876, for the purpose of super
vising and directing the completion of the Wash
ington national monument^ of which commission
tne president is a member, has given careful at
tention to this subject, and already the strength
ening of the foundation has so far progressed ai
to ensure the entire success of this part of the
"work. Ama8Slve layer of masorry has been In
troduced below the original foundation, wldenlna
tbe base, increasing tbe stability of tbe structure?
and Gendering it possible^to carry the shaft to
completion. It is earnestly recommended that
such further appropriations be made for tbe con
tinued prosecution of the work as may be neces
sary for the completion of this national monu
ment at an early day.
MSTRICT 07 COLUMBIA.
Informer messages, impressed-with tbe im
portance of the subject, I have taken occasion to
commend to congress the ndoption of a generous
policy towards the District of Columbia. The
report of the commissioners of the District,
herewith transmitted, contains- suggestions ana
reqpmmendatlons, to all of which I earnestly in
vite your careful attention. I ask your early and
fhvorable consideration of the views which they
express as to the uigent need of legislation for
tho reclamation of the marahes of the Pstomae
and its eastern branch, within the limits of the
city, aUd for the repair of tbe streets of the capi
tal, heretofore laid with wooden blocks, aad now
by decay rendered almost Impassable, and
source at imminent danger to the health of its
citteens. The means at the disposal of tbe com
missioners are wholly Inadequate for the accom
plishment of these important works, and should
be supplemented by timely appropriations from
Mwal tremnrv.
Tile KHlIng or the flats in iVuut of the city will
add to the adiacent lands uud parks now owned
by the United States, a large and valuable do
main,sufficient, it is thought, to reimburse its
entire cost, aud will algo, as an incidental result,
secure the permanent Improvement of the river
for the purpose of navigation.
The constitution having Invested congress with
supreme and exclusivo jurisdiction over the
District of Columbia. Its citizenspnust of necessity
^ook to congress alone for all needful legislation
affecting theiiiintereat and as the territory of this
district is tbe common property of the people of the
United States, who equally ..with its resident
citizens, are interested in the prosperity of their
capital, I cannot doubt that you will be amply
sustained by tbe general voice qf the country in
uny'measures you may adopt for this purpose.
I also invite the fxvorsble consideration of con
feress to tho wants of the public schools of this
ulstrict, aa exhibited in the report of the commis
sioners. While the number of pupils is rapidly
increasing, no adequate provision exists for a
corresponding increase of school accommodation,
.and the commissioners ere without the means
|tn meet tbis urgent need. A number of the build
ing!) now used for school purposes are rented,
end are, in important particulars, unsuited for
the purpose. The cause of popular education in
the District of Columbia is surely entitled to the
same consideration at tbe bunds of the national
government as in tbe eoverai states aud terri
tories, to which munificent grants of the public
lands have been made for the endowment of
pchoold and universities.
RUTHERFORD B. IIATE3.
Exscuuyg Uansion, December 1,187S.
Elephants and Their Ways.
London Spectator.
Elephant-hunting natura'ly takes a
prominent place in Col. Pollock's pages.
He gives some good stories, which .gen
erally relate to the prowess and hair
breadth escapes of his friends and broth
er officers in following the noble game.
He says that the Asiatic elephants
should be divided into two classes—the
Goondas, those that have large tusks,
and the Mucknahs, or those that have
none, or only rudimentary ones the
two kinds seldom herding together, and
having peculiarities of formation which
render them very distinct, although
they do not seem to have been noticed
by other writers. Tbe Mucknah is usu
ally taller and more bulky than the
tusker, and has a longer and very pon
derous trunk. While some animals of
this kind are absolutely without tusks,
most of them have short, sharp ones,
growing downwards like those of the
walrus, with which they can inflict most
formidable blows. Col. Pollock seems
to have been greatly impressed with
the sagacity of tbe elephant in its wild
state, particularly that displayed in its
choice of camping and feeding grounds,
which are often surrounded on three
sides by a tortuous river impassable to
ordinarv mortals, the fourth feeing pro
tected by a tangled thicket or quag
mire.
(,I
have been an hour or more,"
he says, "trying to penetrate into one
of their fastnesses, where twenty or
thirty elephants were congregated with
in a space nowhere more than 400 vards
square but so well were all the ap
proaches protected, that at last, when I
did succeed in crossing over, at the risk
of either being swept away by the force
of the current, or drowned in its deep
bed, or bogged in the quagmires, the
noise we made was sufficient to awaken
the Seven Sleepers, to say nothing of
disturbing a herd of elephants, and I
had the pleasure of seeing them make
their exit one way as I entered on the
opposite side and once more tbo ani
mals were on the move such was the
intricate nature of the country it was
useless, indeed impossible, to follow
them." The Burmese and Assamese, it
seems, laugh at the Europearrfor firing
only at the brain of an elephant, as
they aim with considerable success at
the point of the shoulder, which is one
of its five vulnerable points. It is as
amusing to find that there is much ras
cality practiced about the sale of a
tame elephant as about that of a horse,
the vicious one being drugged and sold
as docile, the sleepy one brightened up
by the use of ginger or brandy, and the
useless brute, that never carries flesh,
fed up for the time with massalahs and
sugar cane. The person accustomed to
elephants is perfectly able to judge of
their state of mind" by the .peculiar
noises they utter the sort of whistling
from the trunk denotes satisfaction^
trumpeting 4 sign of rage, the striking
the trunk on the ground with a pitiful
cry shows alarm, and a kind of grunt
is used to express impatience or dissat
isfaction. Col. Pollock gives a good deal
of information as to the various ways of
catching and training them, and he
rather defends the mahouts from the
many sins alleged against them, saying
they are, as a rule, a plucky and not a
bad class of men, easily managed if
treated with kindness and firmness.
The trip up the Irriwaddie to Pagau
Myo, Ava, Umrapoorah, and Mandalay
is one of the most interesting portions
of Col. Pollock's book. On this occa
sion he saw the white elephant, although
he was not clad in his state trappings,
covered with magnificent precious
stones, "any one of which is worth a
fortune." The animal stood about ten
and a half feet nigh, waa handsomely
made, and had tusks seven feet long,
which, as they all but touch the ground,
required to be slightly shortened each
year.
in Amusing Discovery.
"AH amusing discovery lias just been
made at the town halls ot several
French villages," says the London
Truth, of "plaster busts of the Republic,
which are nothing else than former
busts of the Empress Eugenie, slightly
altered by tbe addition of a bundle of
corn ears in the hair, and a Phrygian
cap or some other Republican attri
bute. It seems that an enterprising
firm of plaster-casts merchants, having
purchased at a discount shortly after
the 4th of September, 1870, all the effi
gies of the ex-Empress which were on
the market, have, by making these u
dicious alterations, succeeded in dis
posing of their wares with considerable
profit.

BREACH OF PROMISE IN CHIAA.
How They Manage Such Things in the
Celestial Empire.
Shanghai Shen Pao.
In a Country village near Nangkin
lived two men named Chen and Yu. Yu
had a daughter, who was formally be
trothed to Chen's son, and, probably on
account of her parent's poverty, was
sent to her future father-in-law's house,
to be brought up there. After a time
Yu, who is a weaver, went to live in
Kanking, and his daughter came to pay
a visit to her mother. The girl, who
was now grown up, was very discon
tented with her loi, complaining of hav
ing to work in the ileitis, and of feer
father-in-law's roughness and coarse
ness and her parents began to repent
of the engagement, and determined to
try and break it off. Next door to
them was a scholar named Chin, who
was waiting for the next examinations,
and occupying himself meanwhile as a
schoolmaster. Constantly seeing the
girl, he took a fancy to her, and formed
an intrigue with her.
The future father-in-law, Chen, find
ing the girl was not sent back to his
house, and hearing a rumor, of Chin's
attentions, began to suspect that Yu was
trying to break off the match, and sent
a match-maker to hurry on the mar
riage. Yu replied that h% had never
accepted any betrothal presents, and
that no one could make him take them,
and that he would not give his consent
to the marriage. Chen then went him
self with the match-maker, but with
no further result than a great deal of
mutual abuse. Chen next filed a peti
tion in the magistrate's court, and Yu
presented a counter petition written for
him by Chin. The case came on for
hearing, and the magistrate *soon
elicited the truth. After rating Yu
soundly, he turned to Chen and said:
"You can take the girl or not, as you
like, but I strongly advise you not to."
Chen persisted in having her, and the
magistrate ordered the two parties to
draw up a formal contract. Chin, who
was present in court, motioned to Yu
not to sign the contract. He was de
tected, however, by the magistrate in so
doing, and was called up and questioned,
and then cautioned that a man in his
position should not mix himself up
in a case of this sort. The magistrate
then looked up the almanac and chose
a lucky day in June for the wedding
day, whereupon Chin stepped forward
and in Yu's behalf begged that the
marriage might be held for the autumn.
This interference thoroughly exasper
ated the magistrate, who thumped the
table and ordered Chin to be kept in
confinement till after the marriage was
completed. In a few days' time the
match-maker presented herself &t Yu's
house with the customary presents.
When she was well inside, the door
was closed, and father and daughter
fell upon her and beat her horribly.
The woman, after this foretaste, not
knowing what would happen on the
real wedding day, appealed to the
magistrate, who again called up the
parties. Yu could only allege in ex
cuse that the son-in-law had not come
in person to his house. Chen said that
the custom was given up in the country,
and besides, his son had not the money
to buy a proper dress for the occasibn.
The magistrate replied that the bride
groom should certainly go to the house,
and, as he was poor, the magistrate
would give him the money for the
dress. Moreover, when the day came,
the magistrate said be would send two
policemen with the bridegroom, and if
there was any trouble the girl should
be carried to the magistrate's Yamen
and married there. When the day
came, the policeman escorted the party
to the bride's house and then came
back to the bride-groom's, and waited
till the marriage ceremony had actually
been performed, when they retired.
DALLAS, in Texas, has a cosmopolitan
population. The patient on the first
bed as you enter the city hospital is a
negro, the next a Swede, the third bed
is occupied by an Englishman, follow,
ed by one in which a son of the Em
erald Isle swears away the hours as he
discusses what he claims is the tyran
nical rule of the English government.
The fifth bed is occupied by an Ameri
can, who seconds the Irishman's argu
ments, declaring that a republican form
of government is the best under the
sun. A Hebrew occupies the sixth bed,
and listens to the others quarrel. Next
is a Polander, and last a Russian. A
few days ago a Mexican was discharged
from this institution.
