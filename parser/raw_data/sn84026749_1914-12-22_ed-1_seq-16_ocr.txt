WILSON JOVIAL A
I
REU
T
Sayres'to Arrive This Evening to
Spend Christmas Holidays
at White House.
Happy in the expectation of greeting
this evening his daughter. Mrs. Francis
Bowes Sayr. and her husband, who
will spend the Christmas holidays with)
him. the President this morning was In
high good humor. j
At the regular Tuesday morning con-j
ference with the newspaper men he kept
his visitors constantly laughing by his!
rapid flow of repartee. J
Remarking upon certain matters of al
foreign nature which were supposed tot
have come before him for consideration.)
but which had been "absorbed" byl
the State Department, ho laughingly de
clared that the Administration was
favored with "shock-absorbers," that, I
unlike most devices of the kind, actual-'
ly worked. j
For tho first time in many months the!
President will have a family reunion on1
Christmas .Day. Mrs. William G. Mc
Adoo with the Secretary of the Treas
ury, and M'ss Margaret Wilson will be
with Mrs. Sayre and her husband at
the Christmas dinner table.
Already tho President has prepared a
number of surprises in tho way of gifts
for his daughters. Refusing to take
anybody In his family Into his con
fidence, he has several times slipped
away from the White Houso In the af
ternoons, accompanied only by the
Secret Service men, and gone shopping.
All the smaller bundles he has lugged'
home himself, and. In the quiet of his
study, lias labeled each present.
Absorbingly Interested in getting from
Congress tho complete, program of leg
islation which he mapped out tor tho
short session In his annual message.
President Wilson made it known tnln
morning that he has set himself strong
ly against all efforts to have him add
to this program, lest overloading It
might Jeopardize lomo of its original
features.
He made It known that even the New
lands bill, which he favors, creating a
commission to map all. luture river and
harbor work, must go by the board nt
this session, lie sa'.d as mucn at tne
White Houso conference last night,
when he met with Senator Newlands
and Secretaries Garrison, Lane. Hous
ton. and Redlield. and Georgo H. Max
well, executive chairman of the Na
tional Irrigation Congress, to discuss
the Newlands bill. ,
l'or the same reasons he has set hlm-
seir squarely against any rural credits
legislation. Immigration legislation, or
additional conservation legislation, not
included In tho program of tho annual
message.
On the other hand, the President de
clared that while he was not familiar
with the details or the ship purchase
bill, as completed by the committee,
he was hopeful that the measure would
go through at this session.
