YOLUME I. 1STE W ULM, MINK., WEDNESDAY, DEC. 11th, 1878k.
Official returns from all but two
counties in the State of New York,
with unofficial returns from those,
give a Republican plurality of 37,
616. The full Republic in vote was
389,676 Democratic,352,060 Green
back, 71,020 Prohibition, 3,533.
The Boston Herald thinks that
the party which makes the fewest
blunders in the next two years will
win in 1880, and the St. Paul Globe
adds: "If this is true, we very much
fear that the Democracy will come
out at the small end of the horn, for
the talent for blundering they dis
play approaches the marvelous."
Gen. M. D. Flower seems to have
no opposition as a candidate for re
election as chief clerk of the House.
St. Paul Dispatch.
We are glad to note that General
Flower's prospect of a re-election is
so good. He made a faithful andef
ficient officer last winter, and the
members of the next House could not
make a better choice.
The drive-well war still rages.
The organization of the Anti-Drive
Well Association was perfected in
St. Paul on the 29th ult., and an
address has been issued to the people
by a committee appointed for that
purpose. There is a general cessa
tion in the payment of the royalty,
and it appears the people are deter
mined to thoroughly test the matter
in the courts before submitting to
the exactions of the patentee of these
wells.
The Millers' Association of Wis
consin at their annual meeting in
Milwaukee yesterday adopted reso
lutions asking the Milwaukee cham
ber of commerce to establish another
grade of wheat to be called No. 2
soft and requesting millers to furnish
fife wheat to farmers for seed, so
that the yield of hard wheat may be
increased. Minnesota farmers may
well take a hint from this, for too
much soft wheat has been sown of
late.St. Paul Dispatch.
The trade dollar received the at
tention of Congress on the first day
of its session. Senator Beck intro
duced a fbill providing that for the
period of twelve months after the
passage of this act the outstanding
trade dollars shall be receivable as
legal tender for all debts and de
mands, including customs dues ow
ing the United States, and said trade
dollars so received shall be recoined
as soon as possible into standard sil
ver dollars of 412+ grains. Similar
bills were also introduced in the
House.
In Rice Co., this State, there have
been a dozen sugar mills in opera
tion, and the total product from am
ber cane is estimated at 30,000 gal

manufactured nearly 4,000 gallons
Of syrup, a fine article, unexelled, for
all purposes, by the best New Or
leans. A gentleman in that section,
who has taken a deep interest in the
subject and is willing to put in $20,-
000 towards building a refinery, has
been investigating the matter with
much care, and declares that the

than the Louisiana cane.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The second annual message of
President Hayes, which we print to
day on third page, is a straight for
waid b^iness document, briefly re
viewing the operations of the sever
al executive departments during the
past year and making only such re
commendations as the condition of
the public interests demands. The
most interesting portion is that in
which he alludes to affairs in the
South. He treats the situation with
a clear preception of the crimes a
gainst personal freedom and the
risht of suffrage committed by the
white leaders in the South and takes
firm ground in favor of enforcing
the laws, and punishing all offend
ers. As a whole the message is pro
nounced an admirable state paper,
and we commend it to all readers
who wish to be well informed as r
gar4s our public matters. |j|
A NATIONAL MALITIA.
A herculean attempt will be made
by prominent military men all over
the country to get Congress this
winter to provide for a thorough
organization of a national malitia.
Meetings have already been held in
New York, Virginia and other pla
ces, and the plan of organization, so
far outlined,is about as follows: The
formation of one regiment of one
thousand men in each Congressional
district, to be equipped and orga
nized by the United States, but the
officers appointed by the States, to
be under the orders of the governors
of the States the appropriation not
to be paid until an inspection by Ihe
federal staff showed the militia came
up to the standard o,dfiiciency, the
volunteers in each Sfate to be enlist
ed for five years one fifth to go out
of service each year, and camps of
instruction not exceeding thirty days
eachyeftr to be provided. This
worfpfgive thirty thousand men in
th^ranks at the end of five years.
Three hunderd thousand men would
be trained and discharged, and at
the end of ten years 900,000 trained
and discharged men would consti
tute a reserve force for any emer
gency. The scheme does not con
template compulsoray service, but
involves a government appropriation
of $1,000,000 for the purchase of uni
forms, arms, equipments, etc., and
has the approval of Gen. W. T.
Sherman and many other distin
guished military men. This certain
ly is a step in the right direction
and, although the editor of the RE
VIEW has no loft}- aspiriations, we
hope that our delegation in Congress
will be friendly to the scheme.
Diphtheria Caused by Had Water.
Munkato Review:
In our lafet issue, we published the
result of Prof. Peckmann's analysis
of samples of water taken from four
wells, located in different parts of
the city, and used by families in
which fatal cases of diphtheria had
occurred. Since then Dr. Davis has,
received reports from two more
wells, which we give as follows, re
producing the report published last
week:

Speaking of these several samples
of water, Prof.Peckmann says: Nos.
1. 2. 3 and 5 are badNo. 3 is par
ticularly bad, the high percentage
of chlorine in this case indicating
sink drain contamination. ^No. 1
is better than No. 5. The aTbume
noid-emmonia indicates on an aver
age ten times the amount of album
inous material in the form of excre
ment or sewerage. No. 1. 5 and 2
contained a large proportion of car
bonates, No. 3 contained a very
small proportion. Nos. 4 and 6 are
pronounced "not nearly as bad as
the others, but the albumoid amin
monia is more than it ought to be."
The significance of these results is
illustrated by the Professor. He
says that some time ago Dr. Hand
sent him a sample of water from St.
Paul, from a well used by two fami
lies in wjiicb, there had been seven
cases of typhoid fever in four weeks.
It yielded 40 parts in the one million
of albuminoid ammonia. Two
cases are cited by Wanklyn as hav
ing been supposed to have each pro
duced a case of English cholera, one
contained .30 the other .36 parts in
one million. In his last report the
Professor gives an analysis of water
from three wells in Brainard, one of
which contained 49 parts, another
none, and another .13 parts ^pf al
buminoid ammonia. The families
using the first and third had cases
of typhoid fever.
These samples of water are prob
ably a fair average of the drinking
water used in our city, and in fact
in all towns and cities not supplied
by a general system- The result
shows that the wells are more or less
contaminated by surface drainage
and by the sinks and vaults upon
the premises. Open wells are also
more likely to be effected by impure
matter falling into them and which
in the ordinary use is difficult to de
tect. That such water is largely the
cause of the prevailing epidemic
there can be but little question. The
first fatal cases of diphtheria,|j occur
red in the family using No. 3, in
which a large percentage of chlorine
was found, indicating sink drain con
tamination. No. 2, also pronounced
very bad,* was use4 by a family in
which five deaths occurred, and in
the case of No. 5, four fatal cases of
diptheria, and one or more of ty
phoid. Its further use for family pur
poses is advised against.
LABOR'S DEBT TO CAPITAL.
Written for the Review by O. CHAMFLIN.
Is labor under any obligation to
capital? We deem the question of
importance in this discussion. There
can be no wise legislation regulat
ing these two factors without a clear
apprehension of their mutual rela
tion to each other. If their interests
are antagonistical then it should be
clearly pointed out. We think,
however, that labor owes capital a
great debt which ought to be recog
nized and acknowledged. Whether
there is a debt on the other side will
be pointed out hereafter.
1. Let lis glance at the winning
industries of our land. There were
in 1870 one hundred forty-seven
thousand seven hundred and fitfy
heads offamilies engaged in mining:
but mining operations cannot be
carried on without capital. To get
at the precious metals, especially,
mountains must be penetrated,
shafts must be sunk, the mines dis
covered and then the ore extracted.
What this involves Charles Barnard
tells in Harper's for December.
"First their must be powera bat
tery of steam-boilers brought at
vast expense from distant cities into
the wilderness. Then follow en
gines for hoisting and pumping, for
sawing lumber and turning ventil
ating fans. There must be houses
and shops, mills and offices, fur
naces, retasts, storehouses for chemi
cals and houses for man and beast
in short, a town. There are often
no trees in all the land, and distant
mountains must be stripped of timb
er, and railroads must be laid to
move it, that huge beams and logs
be ready to line the shafts and deep
galleries below. There must be
gathered engineers, miners, carpent
ers, tracklayers, surveyors, and
clerks, and all those must be shelt
ered from the weather while at
work. A comprehensive plan of
the mining plant must be drawn,
showing the position of the shaft,
the engines, pumps, timber-yards,
railways, counting-rooms, and mills
in brief, there must be a city in
the wilderness." All this is preli
minary but what an immense out
lay of capital is involved. Capital
lies at the basis of this stupendous
enterprise and if that is destroyed
the whole thing fails. It is inevit
able that it should. These one
hundred forty seven thousand and
more heads of families engaged in
mining would have to turn to some
thing else if the capital invested in
this industry was destroyed. Any
one who gives a moments thought to
this, will, of course, see that a large
capital must necessarily be sunk be
fore one cent is realized. These
mining cities would vanish like
shadows if capital was destroyed.
2. The railroad system of our land
employ thousands who are known
as railroad men but these roads de
pend upon capital, and if it is de-.
stroyed they can do nothing. Now
when they cease to do business these
laborers are thrown out of employ
ment, and unless they have been e
conomic must soon starve, or take
charity, or turn to other avocations.
There are upwards of two hundred
thousand heads of families employed
as clerks throughout the land but
their positions grow out of capital.
It is capital that furnishes work for
the more than two hundred fifty
thousand carpenters employed in
different parts of the country. In
deed without the large capitalist
the laborer would have a sorry time
of it. The large class known in po
litical science as lajjprers dppends

upon capital. The industries of the
land are carried on by capital and
whenever that is destroyed labor
suffers and is certain to suffer. If
from any cause, the capital of the
Northwestern Railway company
should be destroyed then the many
families dependent upon it would be
distressed and some of them might
be plunged into great suffering. The
man who has work for another, and
gives it to him, and compensates
him for it is not his enemy. He
who does the work is debtor to him
who gives it. The principle is true
as applied to corporations.
We are not blind to the other
side of this question. Capital can
not get along without labor. Mines
cannot be worked, nor railroads
constructed, nor manufacturing es
tablishments build without labor.
The two are inseperably connected.
The interest of both are indentical.
Hence a blow struck at one is a
blow square in the face of the other.
It may be well to ilustrate at some
length this phase of the subject.
Lone Tree Lake, Dec. 1, 1878.
Editor Review:
The Ladies' Aid Society held a fes
tival at the Lone Tree Lake House, on
Thanksgiving evening, which was an
entire success, and passed off as pleas
antly as could have been desired. The
supper, contributed by the ladies, was
excellent, and onlv corroboiated what
has been many times remarked of the
culinaiy skill of the ladies of Eden,
and financially considered the result
was quite satisfactory. All present
expressed themselves as highly pleased
with the entertainment.
Theie seems to be a dearth of news
at Lone Tree Lake, and your cmres
pondent from this section having noth
ing of interest to communicate, man
ufactured a few items and smuggled
them in as Golden Gate correspond
ence. No wonder that he was asham
ed to own himself the author of such
an insignificant collection of news
several items of which were pure fab
rications and misrepresentions. Let
me enumerate, if you please, those
which were entire false: "Cigars sold
on the sly." There was no attempt at
concealment, nor were the cigars sold
for the benefit ot the Methodist socie
ty. "Mr. Eldred is to supply the
Methodist pulpit the ensuing year."
Mr. Eldred only supplies the pulpit in
the absence of the regular preacher
with whom we hope soon to be furnish
ed. "Christians horse-racing on the
Sabbath." If we are rightly informed
as to whom he means, those men make
no profession, and do not claim to be
church members. "Ten cent cigars."
Five cents is the only price for which
any have been sold.
Why, Mr. Editor, what a reliable
character your otherwise valuable jour
nal will attain if all your correspond
ents have an equal disregard for
truth. Let us hope for the sake of the
morals of our country, that this is an
exception, and that others who favor
you with local items have the good
sense not to pervert the proper office
of a county paper, by making it a me
dium for gratifying their own personal
malice. Mr. Editor, there are certain
reasons why the author of the, worst
letters from Lone Tree Lake hates the
Methodist society as he does, but it
seems passing strange that the few
friends he has in this place should al
low themselves to be influenced by him
to an extent, when, if they candidly
avowed their real sentiments they
would acknowledge that he was not tit
to fill the high office which he holds.
If the Methodist conference had
not closed her doors against him for"
unworthy behavior (a proceeding, the
wisdom of which his subsequent con
duct has clearly demonstrated) he
would be now devoting his talents,
(Heaven save themark)to her interests. 0
He has proved himself capable of the
basest ingratitude first, by turning a
gainst those who patronized him in the
hope that he really had amended, and.'
who were willing to encourage him, if
such were indeed the case and second
ly, by slandering those who had housed
and fed him so long and whom he has-,
never in any way rewarded for their*
kindness, but in the way the viper re-s
wards him who warms it in his bosom.:
Your correspondent wonders whyt^
his effusions are not noticed by those
whom he chooses to assail. Mr. Edi-,
tor, in passing* along the street have/*
you uot often been assaileLb some,
diminutive canine who rustiW out at'
you as though he would tear you limbpn^
from limb? And were you frightened?!
Of course not, you passed quietly onftWp
without making any effort at defense^
and were none the worse for theyfen-. r~-^-
counter. This is precisely the state oi0^/M
the case in this instance, with the dif-S&isi
ferance that the venom manifested in^l^f^
those articles has gained friends for jJ^fesMi
our society, who before occupied neu-sv
tral ground, and has lost to the author
and his abettors friends in the same*
proportion, JUSTICE*
