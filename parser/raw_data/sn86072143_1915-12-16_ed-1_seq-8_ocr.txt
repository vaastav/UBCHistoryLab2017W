fiER.UANY'S PEACE TALK,
Most peoplo can readily understand
why Germany could not well expect to
lio In a more favorable position than at
present to gain desirable concessions ns
terms of peace from the allies. This
is not saying that Germany is weakened
to tho point of ponce. In view of tho
possession by the Germans of foreign
territory on ovory battle front It is easy
to see how the brunt of war has been
made to fall heavily upon the regions
forming the battlegrounds.
Under all the circumstances, however,
there might bo ground for the report
that tho German Kaiser was responsible
for the suggested interpellation of the
Eovornmcnt regarding possible peaco in
order to relieve tho government from
initiating any discussion In this direc
tion. Chancellor von Bethmanii-Hollwcg In
reply to tho socialist Inquiry takes tho
position that Germany In tho conscious
ness of her success can decline respon
Elblllty for tho continuation of tho war.
Germany Is ready to consider peaco pro
posals by the allies. Tho w'ar can ho
terminated, however, only by a peace
iwhlch will glvo tho certltudo that war
will not return.
Tho gist of tho matter seems to be
that eo long as the allies continue to
talk of annihilating Gorman power
peace Is not probable.
Tho chancellor of tho German empire
thus seeks to throw upon tho entente
allies all responsibility for further war.
Germany has won success on every
liattle front, nnd It is held to bo the
duty of tho nlllos under all tho circum
stances to proposo peace. Germany
now Indicates her readiness to mako
peaco on tho right conditions. It re
mains to bo seen whether tho nllles can
be brought to accept conditions which
would b acccptnblo to Germnny.
Tho allies, on tho other hand, have
stipulated that they will not mako peace
until Germany Is brought to their terms,
Apparently tho war must continue until
the two sides are brought much closer
togothcr than they aro at present.

A TIME TO RESTRAIN THE SPIRIT OF PARTISANSHIP.
He is a big man who makes no mistakes. He is a broad
man who can be thoroughly and consistently non-partisan in
a time of national need. President Wilson is a big man
even though at times both mistaken and partisan. When
the President championed the interests and rights of
Americans in the face of foreign encroachment, the republi
can leaders, including President Taft, forgot their partisan
ship, and gave their fealty to the President of the United
States. In this the republican leaders thoroughly reflected
the sentiment of the great mass of tho American people
regardless of political affiliation or race or creed.
When President Wilson in his message to Congress
championed national preparedness for the defence of our
beloved country, he struck a responsive chord in the hearts
of all true Americans. He sounded a lofty note of patriot
ism in his closing paragraph in that document when he
said :
"Wo serve a great nation. We should serve it m the
spirit of its peculiar genius. It is the genius of common
men for self-government, justice, liberty and peace. We
should see to it that it lacks no instrument, no facility or
vigor of law, to make it sufficient to play its part with en
ergy, safety and assured success. In this we are no parti
sans but heralds and prophets of a new age.''
How it jarred on sensitive ears to hear the President of
the United States, who had thus appealed to American
patriotism, quoted as saying: "The republicans have no
issue in the next campaign except the tarifT and the democ
racy is sure to win. Our constructive work has started an
irresistible movement which cannot be stopped. Anyone
who tells you otherwise is talking through his hat."
To-morrow President Wilson confers with additional
republican leaders concerning the carrying out of his policy
of national defence. He expects them to lay aside partisan
ship, although the next day he himself may again throw his
partisan "talking hat" into the ring.
Our columns bear witness to our frequent tribute to the
good things done by Woodrow Wilson. We do not feel ca?.
ed upon, therefore, to close our eyes or ears, when He for
gets himself, when he asks republicans to turn the other
cheek.
We do not desire to discuss this incident from the per
sonal point of view, but rather as an illustration of one of seri
ous difficulties which under our political system ever faces
this nation in time of great peril. A President of the United
States cannot disassociate himself utterly from partisanship
to-day, play the partisan to-morrow, and the day following
appeal again effectively to a united American people. This
is especially true on the eve of a great national campaign in
volving the election of a chief executive.
The need of leadership in non-partisanism in a great
national crisis like that now confronting the American peo
ple is all the more marked in view of the tendency of most
people to carry their party with them at all times.
Most of us are human enough to oppose any measure
projected by a party or personal opponent. We have seen
how the great Lincoln was constantly handicapped in his ef
forts to lead in saving the nation, by the occasional extreme
partisanship of both party friends and political enemies. A
few rabid abolitionists who could not hold themselves while
slavery survived, did not support Lincoln in his efforts to
avert the great struggle which imperiled our nation. On
the other hand, Douglas, Lincoln's former opponent on the
stump in Illinois and his recent competitor for the presi
dency, steadfastly and zealously supported him in that try
ing hour, as did a host of other patriotic democrats.
The immortal Lincoln was a statesman and not a mili
tary genius. Under these circumstances his partisan ad
visers occasionally handicapped his efforts to prosecute the
war to a triumphant close. Jn these days when we are wit
nessing the play of British partisan politics in connection
with the European war, it is worth while for us to recall the
chai'ge that partisan politics figured in our Civil War.
General George II. McClellan, for example, had won
some valuable victories in the early days of the conflict; he
had organized, drilled and put in the field a magnificent
army, which he had successfully led to within sight of the
spires of Richmond, the Confederate capital. After seven
days of furious fighting, McClellan's friends claim he was
crippled and relieved from command because he was a demo
crat. Then when Lee invaded the North and the authori
ties were panic-stricken, McClellan was again called upon
sincl at the bloody battle of Antietam he turned Lee back and
forced the Confederates to cross tho Potomac.
Whatever the merits of the case may have been, and
whether the charge of partisanship was true or not, the
mere charge of partisan politics evidently played havoc for
a time with the military fortunes of the Union cause. That
charge alone was calculated to generate a feeling of partisan
bitterness that could not fail to interfere seriously with the
efficient prosecution of the war.
The American nation is not at war now. It is a time
of tremendous peril, however. On the one hand we are told
failure to provide means of national defence against armed
Europe will invite foreign encroachment and precipitate
war. On the other we are assured a great navy and a
powerful military establishment, actual or within close
reach, will tend to mako us aggressive and lead other na
tions still further to seek to match our preparations for hos
tilities, no matter what excuse may be advanced.
We are at the parting of the ways as regards realiza
tion of the American dream of promoting universal peace.
We all want the same thing but we propose different means
of attaining that end. Both propositions cannot be fully
right ; both have good arguments to sustain them. If either
one is right and we adopt the other, then peril will follow.
In a crisis like this it is the duty of President Wilson him
self as well as of republican leaders to forget party and par
tisanship for the time-being and seek to pierce the veil of
the future so far as possible! We all desire to avoid the
mistakes of other nations that have led to war with all its
manifold horrors and untold sacrifices and its indescribable
sufferings.
Most of us are ready to help hold up the arms of Presi
dent Wilson in his efforts to solve the great problem of na
tional preparedness aright. While republicans are adopting
this patriotic course, it is hardly the part of wisdom to flaunt
the flag of partisanship in the faces of those making this
patriotic response to appeals to their Americanism.
This is a time for straight thinking at Washington, as
well as on the part of the American public. It is no time
to stir up undue partisanship at home or indulge in sudden
virtuous indignation expressed in terms of jingoism abroad.
We cannot wisely try to punish Austria now for what we
condoned in Great Britain or Germany. We cannot ef
fectively solve the problem how to protect ourselves wisely
from possible foreign aggression, if we allow the partisan
taunt of "republican" or "democrat" to divert us from the
paths of prudence and patriotism.
lato In State and nation fur tho or
ganization of agencies to promoto the
purchaso and development of farms In
many cases practically neglected or only
a quaiter tilled, Better credit facilities
to encourage the purchase of fauns are
alieady on tho way, hut It Is a far cry
to the gonoral adoption of those Improv
ed methods of cultivation which would
ensure each Individual farmer largely in
creased revenue, whllo keeping food sup
plies within reach of the average con
sumer. Wo can not expect reasonable food sup
plies unless wo can Incioaso the produc
tivity of our farms, for tho farmer Is
entitled to a fair profit for his labor tho
same as other classes of
people. Woj
can not do hotter In emphasizing this
point than to quote tho words of David
l.ubln, American delegate to the Inter
national Institute of Agriculture at
Hume, Italy, used In his address before
tho national conference on marketing
and farm credits held In Chicago.
Among other things ho said that hotter
markoUng conditions and adequate credit
facilities for ngrlcultui.il operations will
come In this country only when tho
American fnrmor acts for himself In ad
vocating legislation to foster nnd pro
vldo now economic machinery. Mr. I.u
liln also said:
"Clornuin fnrmets, originally, woro not
brighter llinn tho American farmers; In
fact, they woro not nearly as briut. It
ls only now when thov nro operating
under their effective economic systems
that tho German farmers havo become
rlghtcr than tho Amerlcnns. In fact,
they havo become the brightest farmers
In the world, lint It was not tho Oer
innn farmers who Invented nnd devised
these effective economic systems nnd ob-
alned their legislative enactment. They
were devised nnd given legislative enact
ment by tho government."
In other words, wo ran not depend on
Individual effort and expect tho best re
sults. To-day great business enterprises
nro depending on a combination of In
dividuals and resources to achieve re
sults. So In agriculture, U'o general
ndoptlon of right methods ran bo brought
nbout only through co-operallvo effort.
1-ack of resources mokes It Impossible
for our farmers to act together and It
remains for legislative authority to act
for tho promotion of this greatly to be
desired consummation, Involving the wel
fare of our entire population, consumers
ns welt ns producers.

Mr. nnd Mrs. Oeorgo W. Johnson of

nnd his father were crossing tho stream
was crushed by floating Ice. This Is the

drowning. When about In mid-stream a
piece of co struck tho frail craft and
crushed It, Mr. Johnson Jumped upon a
section of Ice which boro his weight, but
tho boy threw himself out of tho sinking

him nnd he was swept under the Ice and
carried down stream. Both father nnd

boat and f'hnrles D. Cutler, who lives
near tho river bank hurried to their aid.
Ho was unable to do anything to save the

(Longncro's Now York letter.)
Shipbuilding and ship repair yards In
New York harbor aro working under
such a prossuro that orders for new
harbor equipment, Including tugs, bar
ges nnd lighters which some of the
allroad companies aro seeking to place
nro going begging. Contracts for the
lollvery of steel tugs and carfloats aro
also being refused unless delivery Is
not required before tho close of 101(5.
So heavy Is tho pressure on local re
pair ship yards that they aro also de
clining orders for early and badly need
ed repairs on many ocean tramp steam
ers, which have been working so In
cessantly during recent months as to
cause serious complaints of lenkago by
receivers of Import freight. Tho situa
tion ns regards ocean freight Is aggra
vated by tho fact that tho great ship
repair yards In England and other for
eign countries aro so busy on naval re
pair work that It Is only possible to
have tho necessary overhauling dono In
American ship yards. Ono reason given
for tile declining of orders for harbor
equipment for early delivery Is tho
growing fear that tho yards will bo un
able to securo tho necessary supplies of
steel and other metals. An Indication
of conditions In this trade Is furnlshod
by the fact that when tho government
called for bids on two new dreadnoughts
during the past week, tho hlds received
wero so high as to causo their rejection
by tho navy department.
The number of deaths resulting from
the reckless driving of automobiles has
reached such alarming proportions that
stringent measures are to be adopted
In tho future for the handling of this
class of offenders. In tho boroughs of
Manhattan nnd Brooklyn 117 children
were killed during the 11 months from
December 1, 1014 to October 31 of tho
present year. The total deaths for tho
entire city, due to reckless driving,
amounted to 41T. It Is claimed that the
existing laws governing operntlon of au
tomobiles contain serious defects, which
llrst of nil must be remedied beforo ef
fective measures can bo pursued In deal
ing with reckless drivers. At the pres
ent time thero Is an absence of legal
requirement providing that tho owner of
an automobile shall procure a license to
drive It. Most of tho prosecutions for
speeding are of owners, and It Is not
possible to control them by the cancell
ing of a driver's license, the most effec
tive method of handling similar cases
of hired chauffeurs. The present method
of recording previous convictions for
speeding Is faulty, and It has been sug
gested that tho finger prints of all of
fenders bo taken In order that previous
convictions for reckless driving may bo
automatically disclosed. It Is also rec
ommended that the most effective method
of controlling the situation Is to give to
the city of New York iho entire power
over licensing all those who run motor
vehicles, which at tho present tlmo is
vested in tho State.
Black Diamond who for over D) years
has been the loader of the buffalo herd In
the Bronx Park Zoo, ns well as tho fa
ther of most of them, nnd of many othors
that have been sold or exchanged, was
put to death during tho past week.
Black Diamond had reached an ago
when he was unable to endure the cold
of the winter months, His sufferings
wcre such during the winter months of
last year that It wns decided to spare
him tho tortures of another slcgo. Last
August ho was placed on tho auction
block and knocked down to a butcher
for J.T09. Permission was given to koep
him at the Zoo until the coming of cool
weather, and that having nrrlved, he
was brought forth to his doom. Black
Diamond was tho largest bison In cap
tivity, and his likeness was known all
over tho country, for he was tho model
of the buffalo on the I'nited States treas
ury ten dollar bills, nnd more recently
on the new "buffalo nickels." During
tl'.e past few weeks many offers were
mado to prevent the killing of Black
Diamond. One offer was to take him to
a ranch In southern Colorado, but It wns
decided that tho old leader could never
stand tho trip. Many offered to buy him
from tho butcher and give him back to
the Zoo, but this was Impossible In view
of the fact that it would only mean
another winter of suffering for him.
Drug users throughout tho city arc
beginning to feel tho effects of the rigid
measures which have been tnken by the
police department In suppressing the Il
licit sale of drugs. During the past week
twenty-eight victims presented them
selves at Bellovue hospital for treatment
because of their inability to securo sup
plies of heroin, cocalno or morphine to
which they had boon addicted. Over
ono hundred men nnd women engaged In
tho Illegal drug trade havo been arrested
dining the past six weeks. Tho chief
difficulty encountered by tho pollco In
stamping out the sale of these drugs
is the enormous prollt mado by tho pod
iers, io gnm wmch they will take a
chnnco of getting caught and of rccclv
ing a prison sentence. Ono ounce of
heroin, cocalno or morphine contains
about 1C0 "decks", as tho llttlo packets
which the pedlers distribute nre called.
Heroin costs JIO.M an ounce, cocalno $1
and morphine ss.75. In tho theatrical
district a "deck" of heroin has been
helling for J5, which would mean a pro.
fit of over ISO on an Investment of $10.50.
In the poorer districts of tho city, adul
terated drugs are peddled for tl to 3
a 'deck", nnd It Is said that the pedlers
often get thirty "decks" out of a dram
of drug, or 240 "decks" to nn ounce.
The mobilization of Now York's army
of 43,000 snow shovelers in preparation
for tho coming campaign ngnlnst snow
storms this winter has been ordered by
tho street cleaning department. Ono
hundred nnd throe registration stations
where prospective laborers may leavo
their names and addresses so they may
bo summoned nt the first attack of win
ter havo been opened through tho city.
It Is Intended to organize this army on
tho same footing ns that of last year,
It will consist of three divisions, each
containing 15.W0 men. Klght hours will
constitute a day's work, and tho wnges
will be J2.40 per day. It l oxpected that
some difficulty will be experienced In re
cruiting tho nrmy to Us full strength be
cause of the fnct that there Is less un
employment In tho city for this tlmo of
the year than Is usually to ho found, In
the event of heavy storms nearby cities
will have to be called upon to furnish
import Stvanty largs plows Or I von by
motor trucks will bo utcd in piling the
snow, which will bn hauled and dumped
by contractors. Tho great stoios of
shovels, picks, and hand and motor
ploughs have been given a through over
hauling, and It Is believed that the In.
vnslon of winter will find tho city In a
thorough slnto of preparedness to handle
whatever situation may arise.
Tho hoboes coming to Now York this
winter, Intending tu bo fed and lodged
by tho charitable Institutions of tho city
nro doomed to an unwelcome surprise
There will bo no Hotel do (Sink to offer
accommodations, such as was In oxls
tenco last year when the number of men
out of employment who came to this
rlty from different parts of the country
had reached such largo proportions that
tho city authorities turned over a build
ing to them for their use. Officials of
various city departments upon whom
Tails the burden of taking rare nf the
Indigent havo mapped out a campaign
which It Is believed will tend to keep
away tho greater number of train in and j
Vagrants who flock hero annually to j
swell thp army of unemployed. It Is
proposed to pick up every tramp on the
streot and put him nt hard manual la
bor, and to make every vagrant commit
ted to nn Institution work for his food
and shelter. Tho munlr'pal lodgln:!
house has accommodations for S.iVn home
less men whero they can get bed and
board and a chance at employment. 1?
a Job Is ohtalned and refused they will
be put to work on streets, hocks nno ,
wood yards. Thero Is also need for man
ual labor at tho Staten Island farm col-
ony, and In cleaning ground nnd digging
tho foundations for now buildings at
Hikers Island. While no doubt thero aro
many who will welcome those opportuni
ties of existing during tho winter, should
employment be scarce and the weather
severe, It Is believed that they will act as
K damper to tho professional tramp and
vagrant.
New York city Is to have a reserve po
llco force of approximately 4.V'I0 men.
This scheme Is the latest slop in the pro
gram of efficiency undertaken by the pros-
4cnt pollco commissioner to anticipate tho
occurrence In this city of catastrophes
such as devastated San Franclsro, Johns
town, or more recently cities along the
Mississippi river by flood. This force will
bo trained to tho last detail and will be
known as the Citizens' Auxiliary of the
existing force. At the name time every
new member of the permanent pollco de
partment Is undergoing a course In train
ing that will mako him the equal nf the
regular army private so far as physical
competency nnd tactical Instructions nre
concerned. In the auxiliary nrmy every
employe of the city Is a potential polite
man. nven the services of tho women
workers will not bo overlooked, for It Is
Intended that they shall bo enlisted to
serve as nurses and, with the men, will
receive Instruction In how to administer
first aid. At tho present time tho pollen
department has well under way a svstem
of signaling by which every police station
In the city may nt nil times be In com
munication with police headquarters.
Should earthquake or any calamity re
sult In tho total destruction of the city's
telegraph and other means of communica
tion, tho pollco "wigwag" squad would be
able to keep every policeman In direct
communication with headqiintcrs.
THE GREATEST SEA DEPTHS.
A piece of iron will sink to tho bot
tom no matter how deep the water is,
becnuso water Is only slightly compres
sible. If water were highly compress
ible, as air Is, the water at a great depth
would be much denser, nnd therefore
heavier, and an object would sink until
It reached a point at which Its weight
would be less than that of tho water
which It displaced and there It would
float, as clouds float In tho atmosphere.
Hut a cubic foot of Iron weighs moio
than a cubic foot of water at a depth

The Basques occupy a mountainous
territory In tho north of Spain and the
south of Franco. They speak a lan
guage which has no relation to any
other In Ruropc. but resembles the lan
guages spoken by the North American
Indians more nearly than any others.
This does not mean that they had n
common origin, but that when those
languages took their present shape the
peoples who spoke them were In a simi
lar stage of development. Tho Bnivmn
language Is entirely deficient In nbstrnct
terms, all such words being borrowed
from other languages. It Is spoken by
nbout CW.OOO Spaniards and Fienehmen,
and wns probably at ono tlmo spoken
over a largo part of western Eu
rope. The Basques aro very proud ami
tenacious of their ancient customs nnd
rights, nnd havo given to Spain somo
of hor most Illustrious men. Tho Chris
