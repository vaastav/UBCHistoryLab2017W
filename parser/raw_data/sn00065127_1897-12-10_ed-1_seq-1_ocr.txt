FOURTH —That the platform on
BLOW AT CUBA.
One did not need to wait for dis
patches from Spain and Cuba to under
stand that President MoKinley's mes
sage is a grievous blow to the Cubans.
It is more serious blow than would be
the arrival of a reinforcement of 20,000
fresh soldiers from Spain. It comes at
a critical time for the patriots They
could deal with a new corps of Spanish
soldiers But they are confronted with
a delicate and perilous situation. They
are offered autonomy which is not
autonomy, with promises of reform
which, even if sincere and even if
carried out, would not reform, 6but
would leave the island still at the mercy
of Spain. The proposed plan of re
form—for, be it remembered, it has
yet to be sanctioned by the cortes—
makes pretense of a frame of govern
ment in which, ostensibly. Cabana
haye some share that is, in which
they are to hold some offices. Thus
the Spanish authorities are even now
energetically making insidious offers to
enlist the interest of many Cubans in
the new form of government. Offices
are offered to them. Many of these
Cubans have taken no overt part in the
rebellion although sympathizing with
its purposes. Then, too, similar offers
are held out to many of the officers of
the Cuban army. Where the hope or
prospect of office is insufficient bribes
in money are offered. It is a terrible
temptation. These men have suffered
everything that mortal man could suf
fer. Peace, rest, comfort, gold, for
tune, are the glittering bribes that are
thrust before their eyes. What strength
would it not give them if they could
have had at least some little suggestion
of sympathy, some little sign of favor,
from the American government at this
time of temptation! On the contrary
they are told, in substance, that Spain
shall have further opportunity to sub
jugate the patriots—further opportun
ity, after nearly three years of such
atrocity and devastation as would have
been a disgrace to the dark ages and
all this on a mere Spanish promise of a
plan which, when analyzed, does not
even promise reform, save at the dis
cretion of Spainish military despotism.
The failure of the British government
to move for the stoppage of Turkish
atrocities, which were nothing to com
pare with the deeds of Spaia in Cuba,

could be somewhat excused, for the
responsibility was only partly on Great
Britain. Our responsibility is direct
and exclusive in Cuba. When before
has the United States ever struck such
a blow at any American people strag
gling to be free from such awful foreign
tyranny?—Sioux City Journal (Rep
Senator William E. Mason and Con
gressman William Lorimer will intro
duce the Chicago Record's postal sav
ings bill in the senate and the house of
representatives, respectively. Senator
Mason is a member of ,the committee
on postoffices and postroacU, while Con
gressman Lorimer is a member of the
same committee of the house of repre
sentatives It is the intention of these
members of congress to introduce the
bill at the earliest possidle opportunity
and, as Senator Mason says, to have a
postal savings bank law on the statutes
before the end of the session
Both Senator Mason and Mr Lorimer
are believers in postal saving banks, as
are the majority of the Illinois delega
tion. Postal savings banks are being
discussed widely by the members of
congress, and it is expected that there
will be several measures introduced
in both the house and the senate 'ihe
western members especially are support
ing the idea, and, while some of the
eastern men are osposing it, the mea
sure has many friends in that section.
One hears almost as much talk about
the postal savings bank legislation in
the corridors of the hotels and in the
places where the members congregate
as he does about the currency, Cuba,
Hawaii and civil-service reform.—

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Pres dent McKinley sent to congress
his first annual message yesterday. It
is a commonplace document which has
been carefully edited and is warranted
not to offend the most delicate sensi
bilities of the most pronounced goldbug
It will likewise give but little confi
dence to, anyone whose range of vision
extends further from Wall street than
Trinity church yard.
The message commences by apolo
gizing for the Dingley bill, giving it a
certificate of good moral character and
promising that it will do better in the
future than it has in the past. This
part of the message is not very en
thusiastic, the fact being that the Re
publicans had to pass the Dingley bill
to beep their pledges to campaign fund
subscribers and, now that it is a law,
are at a loss to know what to do with
their Frankenstein.
The president then passes the cur
rency question. He commends the
plan proposed by Secretary Gage to
turn the monetary system of the coun
try over to the national banks and
advocates the turning of the gret nbacks
into what would practically amount to
gold certificates. After advising that
the government abdicate its constitU'
tional prerogative of issuing money in
favor of the national banks he strongly
advises that the secretary of the treas
ury be given the power to issue gov
ernment bonds at -such times and in
such amounts as he may deem expedi
ent. In other words the president
wants Wall street given the power to
contract the currency and create a
panic every six months or oftener and
also desires to saddle upon the country
untold millions of gold interest bearing
obligations to absorb the surplus earn
ings of unborn generations. For the
well-being of mankind every patriotic
citizen should thank God that there is
still a senate.
Upon the Cuban question the presi
dent indulges in many meaningless
platitudes and weeps crocodile tears
over the horrors of the Weyler regime.
But he thinks that after all Spain
means well and that it would be a
violation of good morals for the United
States to interfere. His Cuban policy
is evidently only a continuation of that
followed by Cleveland, the only differ
ence being that McKinley puts into
diplomatic language what his prede
cessor announced with brutal frank
ness. It is certain, therefore, that
Spain can continue butchering Cuban
men, ravishing Cuban women and
starving Cuban children to its hearts
content so far as any interference by
the present adminisi ration is concerned.
The dollars of Wall street are of much
more consequence than are the suffer
ings of the human beings of poor
ravaged Cuba.
The president favors strongly the
annexation of Hawaii He wants the
United States to encuber itself with a
few coral reefs in the Pacific ocean
inhabited by volcanoes, and a motly
population of Chinese, Portugese,
Japanese, native Hawaiians and white
adventurers. If acquired the island
would be a source of constant trouble,
expense and annoyance and would add
to the country an element that could
never be assimilated but which would
be a constant source of irritation. Oncc
the beet sugar industry is firmly estab
lished in the northwestern states, Ha
waii will be a desert inhabited by peo
ple notable only for their disreputable
morals
Increased appropriations are demand
ed for the navy in order that fat jobs
may be given to favored contractors
to build big warships whose only use
will be to increase the expense of the
government and to get the country in
to unnecessary quarrels with other na
tions
More platitudes are indulged in res
pecting reciprocity, international ami
tration, civil service, the. merchant
marine, and other subjects They
sound well and everyone knows that
they m^an nothing. They are inserted
for mugwump consumption exclusive
ly-
The message is a disappointment, but
after all what was to be expected?
Wall street put the money iu the slot
during the campaign and the machine
had to dro.p out the message.—Sioux
