The "Yellow Man."
The "ronrni" mn is the "vel
Ijw man," and all his rights is the
i.ew holby about to be bestrode by
the enterprising and quiek-Bigbted of
that party, who having agitated the
negro question until the pubic are
r-imply tick nd tired of it, cor find
it necessary to incieasa thi ir politi
cal stock io tmtfe by net? additions
uV rc-nt importation. We tad
thought the fifteenth amendment
would probably meet the case of the
Chinese, although not framed with
special re'erenee to that people, but
do not profess to speak frith certain
ly upon the point, as cur c-py of
the Constitution is Eome teverhl
years o d, and of course without the j atorial district and Gen. Brown 1
modtrn improvements, and to fotDetfor tne Floterial district thus leav-
degree antiquated. It would be a
pity, too, that it should bo 6ettled in
to summary a manner, because io
that case a most splendid lot if por
litical stock in trsde would be spoil
ed befirre the politicians could have a
chance to use it. Senator Sumner
teems of the opinion that the "que -
lion" is still "to le mef," and that
they must "have protection," and so
forth, 88 reported by the papers. We do tot deny that Col. IIol
We take the following from thoBul-iman was gallant ai.d sclf-sacrific-
timore Sun :
The Rights of the Yellow Man
S-nator Sumner, in a lecture at
Klizabetb,New Jeis?y, on Saturday,
warmly denounced the prejudice a
gainst the yellow mnn from Asia.
Tie Biid the Chinese question must
ba met. Attention was once t
trncted to the African; now it is the
Chinese who demanded protection.
Nothing can be settled which is not
right, and this question can only be
in harmony with the principles of
our fathers and in conformity with
Tight and justice. The Chinese
must have fqual copartnership, Iot
justice is the best policr, and justice
is tbe best practice.
Now, from this, it would seem that
wo ought to have another amend
ment to the Constitution at once
ay amendment number seventeen;
for by the proceedings of the woman's
cuffrnge convention at Cleveland,
Ohio, we see they claim number six
teen for themselves. We presume
tbe matter will be pressed in Con
gress immediately, and protection
and equal rights for the "yellow
man" will shortly be the gathering
cry of some of the political dune.
EST It is urged that our friend
Col. Holman served with distinc
tion in the Confederate army.
. This we grant. He served like a
'brave man long and well,"andde
eerve? the gratitude of this people,
and no doubt the people will "de
light to honor" him hereafter.
But we submit, that the humblest
private is just as deserving as his
highest officers, so far as bis ser
vice in the Confederate army is
concerned, and this people owe
them the same debt of gratitude.
But faithful service in the Confed
erate army is not a necessary qual
ification to make a just or good
legislator or statesman. To our
mind thirty-five j'ears of civil
service much bettei befit a man
for statesmanship than five years
in the army.
J2 We ask attention to the
circular of Hon. Geo. W. Jones,
in this paper. It is clear and ex
plicit, and defines very satisfac
torily his position on the questions
likely to come before the Conven
tion. He settles yery conclusively,
also, the misrepresentations that
had been published relative to his
speech at the court-house on the
first Monday. The report mis
carriedit was started too soon,
. thus affording opportunity for s
correction of its misrepresenta
tion's before the election. We
ask everybody to read the circu-Jar.

While we deprecate that policy
which would make military ser

the county forwhem we entertain
a higher respect, than Col. D. W.
Holman ; but the Colonel . should
recollect that there are legislators
and other officers to elect ; and we
could take a great deal of pleasure
in voting for him for these officcs,as
we have done in times past. But in
this instance, we have to form a
new constitution, the foundation
of our house must be rebuilt, and
for such a labor, we prefer the man
who has made statesmanship a
study for thirty-five years, the
man who through long years of
service in Congress, has had to
deal with just such. questions as
will come before the Convention.
ftg Last week we referred,
in a brief paragraph, to our failing
to have a County Court on the
first Monday. Since then we
have been informed that if a copy
of the act had been received
here, the failure complained of
would have been avoided. We
regret that a copy of it did not
reach here in time. In our brief
item, we had no reference to any
individual member of the Legis
lature. We did not know who
introduced the bill, ncr who vo
ted for it.

To the Voters of Lincoln

Fatetteville, Tenxtseee,
December 13, 1869.
On Saturday last, at Pleasant
Plains, I was informed that a re
port was being circulated in that
portion of the county, that I was
in favor of negro suffrage. That
report I publicly denounced as
without foundation and false.'
Since that I have been informed
that there is another report in cir
culation, that I am in favor of the
proposed, pending, Fifteenth A-
mendment to the Constitution of
the United States. I am fortunate
in having it in my power, and with
equal truth, to say this report is
also wrthout foundation and is ut-
!terly falLsf- lf there isj an? one

piinted in th.Lincoln Count;
News." of Saturday, the 11th in-
resentation.
As a candidate for a seat in
the proposed Constitutional Con
vention my position upon the suf
frage question, is, to Bujbmit to a
separate vote ot tne people, the
question of negro suffrage, thus
affording to each and every voter
in the State, to vote for or against
negro suffrage as each one may
determine for himself. At the
ratification election, I will vote
for while suffrage if in the mean
time the fifteenth amendment shall
have been defeated.
I have many times been before
this county as a candidate. This
is the first time in thirty-five years
that I have deemed it necessary,
on the eve of an election, to adopt
this means to deny or refute slan
ders or falsehoods. I have lived
in this county forty-eight years
and the greater portion of that
time in your servic, to little pur
pose, if I have not established
character for truth, honesty and
candor, sufficient to commend me
to your confidence and support
I have never occupied a doubtful
or equivocal position on any public
question. Always a Democrat in
the rrost enlarged andcomprehen
sive sense of the term ; a Conser
vative now and opposed to Radi
calism and the Radical party in
all of its measures. With me the
public good is paramount to my
personal success ur promotion. If
I am beaten this time let it be
fairly done, without misrepresenta
tion or falsehood, and I shall be
satisfied with your decision.

awaro. The Clarksville Tobacco-Leaf
mentions the arrival in that city
of one G. W. Ahl, the man who
was in charge of the Confederate
prisoners at Fort Delaware during
the war, and whose cruelty to the
prisoners incarcerated in'that place
was next to barbarism. He is on
a drumming tour through the
South for the firm of R. M. Pom
eroy& Co., of Cincinnati. The Tobacco-Leaf
refers to his reception
in Clarksville as follows:
He had not been upon the street
long, however, until recognized by
some of his former victims, in the
persons of several young men,
whose good fortune it was to sur
vive the war, as well the more
dangerous "reign of terror" under
him at Fort Delaware, and in a
short time he was waited upon by
two or three gentlemen whom he
once had the honor of tyrannizing
over and the satisfaction of rob
bing and abusing.
' Upon being questioned, he ac
knowledged that he was the same
man, Ahl, and the parties said
they were glad of an opportunity
of recalling to his mind a few in
stances of the awful treatment
they received at his barfds,as Con
federate prisoners of war; and after
assuring him that no violence
would be offered him, proceeded to
pass in review some of his cow
ardly acts, to which he plead guil
ty ; though he claimed that he was
obeying Gen. Shoef 's orders. He
left Monday evening on a south
bound train.

"The freed men," he says, "u:
der the protection which they have
received are makingrapid progress
in learning, auu no complaints are
heard of lack of industry on their
part when they receive fair remu
neration for labor."
The Nashville Hanner sums up
the remaining leading points of the
message as f ollows :
He opposes immediate resump
tion of specie payment and favors
gradual resumption. To accom
plish this he favors the redemp
tion of greenbacks at a fixed price.
As we understand it, his proposi
tion is to use the cold in the treas
ury in buyiug up the greenbacks,
at the market price.
He thinks the public debt could
be paid in ten years, but doesn't
favor it.
He favors the lunding of the
debt in bond1?, bearing a rate of in
terest not exceeding four and a
half per cent. In order to accom
plish this successfully, he suggests
that authority be given to pay
the interest at one ot the money
centers of Europe.
He ftvors the postponement ot
any legislation upon the tariff and
internal revenue laws until the
next session of Congress. He rec
ommends a renewal of the tax on
income?, but at the reduced rate
of four per cent., to expire in three
years with the funding of the na
tional debt.
