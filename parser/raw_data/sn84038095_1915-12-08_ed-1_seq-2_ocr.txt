PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE.
President. Wilson's message was
read to congress yesterday and natur
ally attracted a great deal of attention
as is usually the case when a state pa
per is presented by the president. Every
one was anxious to know what the
president was going to say about pre
paredness as it was understood before
the message was delivered that he
would take advanced ground on this
question. As was expected a larger
navy was advocated and an increase
in the army. The increase in the
standing force of the regular army
froin its present strength of 5,023 of
tiecrs and 102,985 enlisted men, to a
strength of 7,136 officers and 134,707
enlisted men or 141,all tpld, is
recommended and no doubt the plan
will be carried out. In addition ^o the
Increase in tlie regular army it is plan
lied to supplement the army by a force
of 400,000 disciplined citizens raised
in installments of 133,000 a year for
four years. This is to be carricd [out by
a plan of enlistment under which,those
who enlist will be asked to binoTthcin
selves to serve with the colors for pur
poses of training for short periods
throughout three years and come to
the colors at call at any time through
nut an additional furlough period of
three years. They will be assembled
for training at stated intervals at con
venient places in association with suit
able units of the regular army. It is
pot contemplated to require their
services for over tyvo months in the
year.
The plan contemplates an increase
5u the navy of 7500 sailors, 2500 ap
preHMcc seamen and 1500 marines.
Tliis increase is asked to care for the
additional ships which are to be pro
vided. The purpose is the construe
lion within five years of ten battle
ships, six battle 'cruisers, 10 scout
cruisers. 50 destroyers. 15 fleet subma
ines, 85 coast submarines, 4 gunboats,
1 hospital ship. 2 ammunition ships,
2 fuel oil ships and 1 repair ship. In
order to secure the number it is pro
vided for the construction of two bat
tleships, two battle cruisers, thrc
Hcout cruisers, fifteen destroyer?, live
lleet submarines, twenty-five coast sub
marines, two gunboats, one hospital
ship the first year, the second year a
similar proportion until the limit is
readied. It further proposes to in
crease the nuikber of midshipmen for
the naval academy at Annapolis three
hundred in order tlipt the force of of
ficers should be more rapidly made up
This means a substantia! increase
in both the army and navy and. if the
president's program is carricd out, be
fore the present session adjourns,
provision will be made for the increase.
The president has the temerity to
point with pride to his record in Mer
tco. This is somewhat of a surprse
because It is not generally believed
that the president lias won qny glory
in his management of Mexican affairs.
The feoling prevails that he has fall
-urder in that distracted country. It
is not difllcult la understand that if
the president had acted in concert
wtli Knglind and Italy and some other
countries in recognizing the govern
ment that Hucrta established some
tv/o years ago, that a great deal of
trouble Would have been averted, not
only for tlie Mexican people, but for
Hie citizens of this and other coun
tries. A very large number of people
have sacrificed their lives and a great
amount of property loss has been sus
tained because of the president's pol
icy of sitting bv and doing nothing
when he liould have acted and dipping
in to dlctite affairs in Mexico when he
should have refused to do so.
The democratic national convention
in IDlti will be held at St. Louis begin
uiug on Wednesday, Jtme 14th, at
noon. This was the decision arrived
at on yesterday iu the city of Wash
ington by the democratic national com
'.vttee. Ou the iirst ballot St. Louis
was iirst on the list, Dallas, Tex., was
second, Chicago being third. On the
second ballot tlie Dallas vote, fearing
that Chicago might gain the prize,
went to St. Louis and before the end of
the second ballot the choice of St.
Louis was made unanimous.
The committee adopted a resolution
calling for the renomination of Woo„d
row Wilson, which means that the con
vention which meets in June will have
nothing to do but ratify the action of
the national committee.
It is no surprise that tlie convention
is to be held in the south because the
strength of the democratic party is in
the south. The first ballot indicated
that 39 votes out of 52 were in favor
of the south as the place for holding
the convention. The action of the dew
ocratic committee practically insurer
the republican convention being held
Chicago, and it will be held at a lat
er date than that fixed for the demo
cratic convention.
Dr. Bristol, bishop of the Methodist
Episcopal church, residing at Omaha,
Neb., has consented to speak at Deni
son on Monday evening of next week
at the Methodist church. His address
will be along educational lines and it
is safe to assert that Denison will have
no greater treat for a long time to
come than In listening to this profound
speaker. Dr. Bristol was for several
years President McKinley's pastor in
Wasliington| When stationed at tlie
Metropolitan church in that city.
We do not liesitate to recommend
him as a great thinker and orator and
predict that a crowded house will
greet him when he comes to Denison.
The Washington Press has this Jo
say of the candidacy of Carl F. Kuehn
lo for governor: "It was our first
thought that the campaign of Carl F.
Kuehnle would be local and not spread
over the state, but we were mistaken.
It is now evident that he is becoming
a strong factor and many of the best
in formed are predicting that he will
lead Harding in the vote."
The only amendment we would sug
gest. to what the Washington Press
has to say is that Mr. Kuclinle will be
leading not only the vote of Mr. Hard
ing, but of all the other candidates be
fore the primary is held.
Senator Joseph Allen, who has been
a conspicuous leader in the fight for
temperance and equal suffrage, wilt
give an address in this city on next
Saturday evening, December 11th, at
the Presbyterian church. Senator Al
len comes in the interest of the Iowa
Equal Suffrage association, of which
Miss Flora Dunlap, of Des Moiues, is
president, and his address is educa
tional and impartial. The young pop
ple are very earnestly invited to hear
him, and it is hoped that the men and
women of Deuison will take this op
portunity to hear one of our legislat
ors on the subject of equal suffrage.
Good Side-Walks.
Tlie standard required of all public
conveniences is steadily rising, it
makes the tax payer groan, the peo
ple will not stand lor the delects that
used to be accepted tolerantly.
In no respect is this truer than in
the demand for good walking con
ditions in cities and towns. Formerly
large cities got along with ordinary
bricks, which soon became irregular,
and made jhard travelling for the
walker. Smaller* places used the na
tive dirt, more or less treated with
gr&vel or cinders, but reverting to
fathomless sloughs of despond in rainy
timcB or in winter.
Tar concrete was considered an ad
mirable walk for moderate sized towns
down woefully iu bringing about!within a few years. But people are
getting impatient or its failure to
wear, and the use of permanent forma
of cement is spreading rapidly.
When a ccinont walk is to be built,
it pays to put iu a good oue. Many
walkg are laid too thin and without
proper drainage In wet spots, so that
tliey soon disintegrate. Better an old
time gravel walk than the whitest ce
ment that soon becomes crumbled
and broken.
There is, a strong feeling among the
Congressmen that a number of mar
ble post-bffices at strategic political
points in their district would be a
help in case the United states was in
vaded by a foreign power.
