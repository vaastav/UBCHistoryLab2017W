The monthly debt statement, for

public debt of $3,461,080. Still does
it steadily decrease.
On Tuesday in the House, the
Presidents Message, and its appro
priate reference, engaged attention

material importance transpired in
the Senate.
We have received a copy of the
proceedings of the Editorial Con
ventions held at Springfield and Ak

publishers have not exhibited much
expedition in getting out the pamph
let. A DETERMINED EFFORT IS being
made to split the Republicans in the
organization of the Legislature, and
especially on the Senatorial question
but so far, it has met with but little
success. The Democracy are offer

of the House, and the Chairmanships
of different important committees,
in order to get them to vote with
them on the Senatorial question.

mensurate with their efforts.
The present cold spell has occa
sioned a "close up" much earlier
than usual, and it is thought that
the result will be very disastrous in
commercial circles. A'large num
ber of vessels large and small are
frozen in the Welland Canal, while
four hundred canal boats, with car
goes estimated at from three to four
millions dollars, are frozen up be

equally discouraging.

The Message.
We devote a large portion of our
space this week to the message of
President Grant, which our subscri
bers will be pleased to read. It con
gratulates the country on the pre
valence of peace, but refers in appro
priate terms to the heavy loss of
property and life by storm and fire,
which have marked the past year,
and pays a proper tribute to the gen
eral sympathy manifested to suffer
ers not only at home but abroad
He refers, as well he may, with pride,
to the Washington Treaty, in view
of the important results which may
accrue from it From the message
we learn that the Public Debt has
been decreased during the year $86,
057,126, and that by the sale of the
5 per cent bond, a saving of $17,000,
000 in annual interest alone, will re
suit.
In his recommendations the Pres
ident urges a further reduction of
internal taxation, and the limitation
of taxes to liquors and tobacco,
He also urges a reduction in customs
duties, and would place articles not
produced in this country on the free
list The Postal Telegraph sugges
tions meets with a hearty approval
at the hands of the President
Considerable space is devoted to
the action which has been taken un
der the Ku-Klux laws, showing their
wisdom, and that the results promise
the pacification of that section of
country whera that species of law
lessness abounded.
In reference to the Mormon mat
ters, the President makes a recom
mendation of special legislation in
favor of the children born under po-
ligamy.
He expresses much satisfaction
with the new policy in the manage
ment of the Indians, and hopes for
much good to result therefrom.
Civil service reform is urged up
on tne attention oi congress, ana
further action in that direction sug
gested, as well as upon various other
subjects,
As a whole, the message will prove
in every way acceptable to the peo
pie, and increase their respect for
their worthy chief Magistrate.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
In addressing my third annual messace to
the law-making branch of the Government, it
is eratifyine to be able to state that during the
past year suocess has generally attended the
efforts to execute all laws found upon the stat
ute books. The policy has been not to inquire
into the wisdom of the laws already enacted.
but to learn their special intent and to enforce
them accordingly.
The post year has been, under a wise provi
dence, one of Droiceritv to the nation. It has.
however, been attended with more than usual
chastisements in the loss ot life and property,
bystorm and fire. These disasters have served
to call forth the best elements of human nature
in our country and to develop a friendship for
us on the part of foreign nations, which goes
far toward alleviating the disasters occasioned
by the calamities. The benevolent, who have
so generously shared their means with the
victims of these misfortunes, wiU reap their
reward in tbe consciousness of Having per
formed a noble act, and m receiving the grate
ful thanks the men, women and children
whose sufferings they have relieved.
OUB BELATIONS WITH POBHI05 rOWEES.
The relations of the United States with for
eign powers continue to be friendly. The
year has been an eventful one, in witnessing
two great nations, speaking one language and
having one lineage, settling, by peaceful arbi
tration, of long standing and liable at

any time to bring those nations into bloody
and hostile conflicts. An example has thus
been set which, if successful in its final issue,
may be followed by other civilized nations and
be the final means of returning to productive
industry millions of men now maintained to
settle disputes of nations by the bayonet and
broadsword.
TEE TEKATT Or THE JOIST HIGH COMMISSION.
I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty al
luded to, wnicn nag been concluded since tne
adjournment of Congress with her Britanic
Majesty, and a copy of the protocol of tbe con
ference of the Commissioners by whom it was
negotiated. This treaty provides methods for
adjusting questions pending between two na
tions where various Questions are to be ad-
usted by arbitration. I recommend Congress,
at an early day, to make the necessary pro
vision for the tribunal at Geneva and for the
several Commissions on part of the United
States, called for by the treaty.
His majesty the King of Italy, President of
the Swiss Confederation, and his majesty the
.emperor of Jttrazu, have each consented, on
the joint request of the two Dowers, to name the
arbitrator for the tribunal at Geneva. I have
caused my thanks to be suitably expressed for
the readiness with which the joint renuest has
been complied with by the appointment of
gentlemen of eminence and learning to those
important positions. His majesty the Emper
or of GermaiiJ has been pleased to comply
with the joint request ol the two governments.
and has consented to act as tn arbitrator of
the disputed water boundary between tie
united states and Great .Britain. The con
tracting parties in the treaty have undertaken
to regard as between themselves, certain prin
ciple of public law for which the United States
have contended from the commencement of
their history; they have also agreed to bring
these principles to the knowledge of other
maritime powers and to invite them to accede
totneni. negotiations are going on as to the
form of the note by which the invitation is
to bo extended to the powers and I recom
mend the legislation necessary on the part of
the United States to bring into operation the
articles of treaty relative to the fisheries, and
the other matters touching the relations of
the United States towards British North
American possessions, to become operative as
soon as the proper legislation shall be had on
the part of Great Britain and its possessions.
is much to be desired that the legislation
may become co-operative before fishermen of
the United States begin to make arrangements
for the coming season.
I have addressed a communication, of which
copy is transmitted herewith, rsi the ;-
nors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indi
ana, Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin, urging
upon the governments of those States, resnact-
ively, the necessary action on their part to
: . - l -v. v . ... , . . ...
carry into affect the object of h. article ol the V
treaty, which contemplates the use of the
canals on the other side, connected wun ine
navigation of the lakes and the rivers, forming
the boundary, on terms of equity by the in
habitants of 'both countries. It is hoped that
the importance of the object and the benefits
to flow therefrom, will secure the speedy ap
proval and legislative sanction of the States
concerned.
BOUNDARY LINE.
I renew the recommendation for an appro
priation for determining the true position of
the forty-ninth parallel of latitude where it
forms the boundary between theUnited States
and the British Aortn American possession.,
between the Lake of the Woods and the sum
mit of the Rocky Mountains. The early ac
tion of Congress upon this recommendation
would put in the power of the War Depart
ment to place a force in the held during the
FRANCE AND GERMANY.
The resumption of diplomatic relations be
tween France and Germany have enabled me
to give directions for the withdrawal of the
protection extended to Germans in France by
the diplomatic snd consular representation of
the United States in that country. It is just
to add, that the delicate duty of this protec
tion has been performed by the Minister and
the Consul General at fans, ana ine tuiu
iVn.nk in Pnuii-jL tinder the sunervision ui
h. latt.r with irroat kindness as well as with
prudence and tact Their course has received
the commendation of the German government
and has wounded no susceptibility of the
French. The government of the Emperor of
Germany continues to manifest a friendly
feeling toward the United States, and a desire
to harmonize with the moderate ana lust poli
cy which this government maintains in its
relations with Asiatic powers as well as with
tha Smith American Republics. I have given
that the friendly feelings of that
onnrmnmit are fullv shared by the United
States. The ratification of the consular and
naturalization connections with the Austro-
Hungary government have been sxenangea.
have been officially informed of the annexa
tion of the States of the Church to the king
dom of Italy and the removal of that kingdom
to Rome, In conformity with the established
policy of the United States. I have recog
nized this change. The ratification of the new
treaty of commerce between the United States
and Italy have been exchanged; the two pow
ers have agreed in their treaty that property
sea shad be exempt from capture in case of
war between the two powers. The United
States have spared no opportunity of incor
porating this rule into the obligations of na
tions.
SPANISH CLAIMS.
Ths Forty-first Congress, at its third see
sion. made an appropriation for the organiza
tion of a mixed commission for adjudicating
upon the claims of citizens of the United
States against Spain, growing out of the in
surrection in Spam. That Commission has
since been organized. I transmit herewith the
correspondence relating to its formation and
its jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that this
commission will afford the claimants a com
plete remedy for their injuries.
It has been made the agreeable duty of the
United States to preside over a conference at
Washington betwen the plenipotentiaries of
Spain and the allied South America Repub
lics, which has resulted in an armistice, with
the reasonable assurance of a permanent peace
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA.
The intimate friendly relations which have
long existed between the United States and
Russia, continues undisturbed. The visit of
the third son of the Emperor is a proof that
there is no desire on the part of his govern
ment to diminish the cordiality of those re
lations. The hospitable reception which has
been given to the Grand Duke, is a proof that
our side we share the wishes of that gov
ernment. Tbe inexcusable course of the Rus
sian Minister at Washington, rendered it ne
cessary to ask his re-call and to decline to
longer receive that functionary as a diplomatic
representative, it was impossiDie, witn seu
respect or with a just regard to the dignity of
the country, to permit Mr. Catocazy to con
tinue to hold intercourse with this government
after his abuse of government officials and
during his persistent interference, through
various means, wun tne relations petween tne
United States and other powers. In accor
dance with my wishes, this government has
been relieved of further intercourse with Mr.
Catocazy and the management of the affairs of
the imperial legation has passed into the hands
a gentleman entirely unoDjectionaDie.
JAPAN AND CHINA.
With Japan we continue to maintain Inti
mate relations. Aue aniuet 01 tue maxauo
has. since the class of the hut session of Con
gress, selected citizens of the United States to
serve in important offices in several depart
ments of the government, i nave reason to
think that this selection is due to an apprecia
tion of the disinterestedness of the policy
which the United States have pursued towards
Japan. It is our desire to cdntinue to main
tain this disinterested and just policy with
China as well as Japan, the corrrespondence,
transmitted herewith, shows that there is no
disposition on the part of this government to
swerve from its established course. Prompted
a desire to put an end to the barbarous
treatment oi our smpwrecaeu sauors at tne
Corean coast, I instructed our Minister at
Pekin to endeavor to conclude a convention
with Corea for securing the safety and hu
mane treatment of such mariners. Admiral
Rogers was instructed to accompany with suf
ficient force to protect him, in cose of need, a
small surveying party was sent out. On reach
the coast he was attacked at a disadvan
tage. Ample opportunity was given for ex
planation and apology for the insult. Neither
came. A force was then landed. After an ar
duous march over a rugged and difficult coun
try, the forts from which the outrages had
been committed were gallantly assaulted and
destroyed. Having thus punished the crimi
nals, and having vindicated the honor of the
nog, the expedition returned, x lndmg it im
practicable, under the circumstances, to con
clude the desired convention, I respectfully
refer to the correspondence relating thereto
herewith submitted, and leave the subject for
such action as Congress may see ht to take,
MEXICO.
The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealer!
very objectionable law establishing what
known as the "Free Zone" on tho frontier of
United States. It is hoped that this may
be done, and also that more stringent
measures may be taken by that Republic for
restraining lawless persona on its frontier.
hone that Mexico, by its own action, will soon
this government of the difficulties ex
perienced trom this cause.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA.
Our relations with the various Republics of
Central ana ooutn America continue, with one
exception, to be cordial and friendly. I rec
ommend some action by Congress regarding
over-due installments unaer tne award of
Venezula Chums Commission of 1866.
internal dissensions of this government
present no lustitications for the absence of ef
to meet their solemn treaty obligations.
ratification of an extradition treaty with
Nicaragua has been exchanged. It is a sub-
for congratulation that the Great Empire
urazu nas taken tne initiatory steps toward
abolition of slavery. Our relations with
Empire, always cordial, will naturally be
made more so by this act. It is not too much
hope that the government of Brazil may
hereafter find it for its interests, as well as in
trinsically right, to advance toward entire
emancipation more rapidly than the present
contemplates. The true prosperity and
greatness of a nation is to be found in the ele
vation and education of its laborers. It is a
subject for regret that the reforms in this di
rection, which were voluntarily promised by
statesmen of Spain have not been carried
in its West Indian Colonies. The laws
regulations for the apparent abolition of
Blayery in Cuba and Porto Kico leave most of
laborers in bondage, with no hope of re
until their lives have become a burden to
employers.
CITIZENS OF THE U. S. HOLDING SLAVES IN
OTHER COUNTRIES.
desire to direct your attention to tha fact
the citizens ot tne united States are large
holders, in foreign lands, of she inm of
property forbidden by the fundamental law of
country. A recommend to Congress to
provide oy stringent legislation a suitable pen
alty against the holding, owning or dealing in
slaves or being interested in slave pronertv in
foreign lands, either as owners, hirers or mort
gagors, by persons 01 tne united States.
CUBAN TROUBLES.
It is to be regretted that the disturbed con
dition of the Island of Cuba continues to be a
source of annoyance and of anxiety. The ex
istence of a protracted struggle in such close
proximity to our own territory, cannot be
other than an object of concern to a people
who, while abstaining from interference in the
affairs of other powers, naturally desire to see
every country in the undisturbed enjoyment
of peace, liberty, and the blessings of free in
stitutions. Our naval commanders in Cuban
waters have been instructed, in case it should
become necessary, to spare no effort to nmtoi
the lives and property of ftona fide American
citizens and to maintain the dignity of the
flag. It is hoped that all nendini? onest;,.
with Spain, growing out of the affairs in Cuba,
may be adjusted in the spirit of pesce and con
ciliation which has hitherto guided the two
powers in their treatment of such questions.
a
ENCOURAGEMENT OF
WITH CHINA AND JAPAN.
To give importance and to add to the effi
ciency droT diplomatic relations with Japan
and China, and "to txitZZ in commercial rela
tions the good opinion of those pcoj,! ;jd to
secure to the United States its share of the
commerce destined to flow between those na
tions and the balance of the commercial world
I earnestly recommend that an appropriation
be made to support at least four American
youths in each of these countries to serve as a
part of the official family of our Ministers
there. Our representatives would not even
then be placed upon an equality with the re
presentatives ot Great Britain and some other
powers. Ab now situated, our representatives
in Japan and China have to depend for in
terpreters and translators upon the natives of
those countries, who know our language im
perfectly, or procure for the occasion the ser
vices of employees in other foreign business
houses of the interpreters to other Foreign
Ministers. I would also recommend liberal
measures for the purpose of protecting the
American line of steamers now plying between
Son Francisco, Japan, and China, and the
Australian line, almost our only remaining
line of ocean steamers, and of increasing their
THE NATIONAL DEBT TARIFF AND REVENUE.
The national debt has been reduced to tbe
of
of
extent of eighty-six millions fifty-seven thous
and one hundred and twenty-en dollars and
eighty cents during the year, and by the ne
gotiations of national bonds at lower rate of
interest, the interest on the public debt bos
been so far diminished that now the sum to be
raised for interest account is nearly seventeen
million dollars less than on the fist of March,
1869. It was highly desirable that this rapid
I diminuation should take place, both to
strengthen the credit of the country and to
convince its citizens of their entire atjiiity to
meet every dollar of liability without bank
rupting them. But, in view of the resources
of the country, its increasing ability to meet
large demands, and the amout already paid, it
is not desirable that the present resources of
the country should continue to be taxed in
order to keep np this rapid payment I there
fore recommend a modification of the tariff
and international tax laws. I rocommend that
ait taxes from Internal sources be abolished,
except upon spirituous, vinous, and malt
liquors, and tobacco in its various forms, from
stamp. In re-adjusting the tariff, I suggest
that a careful estimate be made of the amount
of surplus revenue eoilected under the present
laws, after providing for the current expenses
of the government, the interest account, and
a sinking fund; and that this surplus be re
duced in such manner as to afford the greatest
relief to the greatest nnmber. There are
many articles not produced at home, such as
medicines, compounds, fec., &., from which
very little revenue is derived, but which enter
into general use. All such articles I recom
mend it to be placed on the free list. Should
a further reduction prove advisable, I would
then recommend it be made upon those arti
cles which can bear it without disturbing
home production or reducing wages of Ameri
can labor. I have not entered into figures, be
cause to do so would be to repeat all that is
laid before you in the report of the Secretary
of the Treasury.
PAY COLLECTORS OF CUSTOMS.
The present laws for collecting revenues,
pay collectors of customs small salaries but
provide for shares in all seizures, which, at the
principal ports of entry, particularly, raise the
compensation of these officials to a large sum.
It has always seemed to me that this system
must at times work peniciously. It holds out
an inducement to dishonest men, should such
get possession of those offices, to be lax in their
scrutiny ol goods entered, to enaoie tnem
finally to make large seizures. Your attention
is repectfully invited to this subject.
THE CURRENCY QUESTION.
Continued fluctuations in the value of gold,
compared with the national currency, has a
most damaging effect upon the increase and
development of the country in keeping prices
of all articles necessary in every day life. It
fosters a spirit of grumbling, prejudicial alike
to the national morals and national nuances.
If the Question can be met so as to secure a
fixed value to currency, that value constantly
and uniformly approaching par with specie, a
very aesiraoie ooject win ue guinea.
THE ARMY.
For the operations of the army in the past
year, the expense of maintaining it, the esti
mates for the ensuing year, and continuing sea
cost and other improvements, conducted under
the supervision of tne AY ar Department, 1
refer you to the accompanying report ot tho
Secretary of War. I call your attention to the
provisions of the act of Congress, approved
March 3, 1869, which discontinues promotions
in the staff corps of the army until provided
for by law. I recommend that the number of
o Seers in each grade of staff corps be fixed, and
that whenever the number in any one grade
tails below tne number so nxed, that tne va
cancy may be filled by promotion from the
grade below. Also, I recommend that when
the office of Chief of Corps becomes vacant, it
may be filled by selection from the corps in
wnicn tne vacancy occurs.
THE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the
Navy shows an improvement in the
number and ethciency of the naval
force, without material increase in
the expense of supporting it. This
is due to the policy which has been
adopted and is being extended as
fast as our material will admit, of
using smaller vessels as cruisers on
the several stations. By these
means we have been enabled to oc
cupy at once a large extent of cruis
ing ground and to visit more.
Frequently the posts where the
presence of our flag is desirable and
generally to discharge more effici
ently the appropriate duties of the
navy in time of peace, without ex
ceeding the number of men or ex
penditures authorized by law, during
the past year, the navy has, in addi
tion to its regular service, supplied
the men and officers for the vessels
of the coast survey and has complet
ed the surveys, authorized by Con
gress, of the Isthmus of Darien and
Tehuantepec, and under like author
ity has sent out an expedition com
pletely furnished and equipped, to
explore the unknown ocean of the
North. The suggestions of the re
port as to the necessity lor increas
ing and improving the material of
the navy and the plcn recommenced
for reducing the personnel of the
service to a peace standard by the
gradual abolition of certain grades
of officers, the reduction of others,
and the employment of some in the
service of the Commercial Marine,
are well considered and deserve the
thoughtful attention of Congress. I
also recommend that all promotions
in the navy above the rank of cap
taincy, be by selection instead of by
seniority. This course will secure,
in the higher grades, greater efficien
cy, and hold out an incentive to
young officers to improve themselves
in the knowledge oi their profession.
The present cost of maintaining the
navy, its cost compared witn tnat ot
the preceeding year, and the esti
mates for the ensuing year, are con
tained in the accompanying report
of the Secretary of the Tsavy.
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The enlarged receipts of the Fost
Office Department, as shown by the
accompanying report of tho Post
master General, exhibits a gratifying
increase in that branch ot the ser
vice. It is tne index ot tne grow tn
of education and of the prosperity of
the people, two elements highly con
ducive to the vigor and stability of
republics. With a vast territory
ike ours, much ot it recently popu
lated. but all requiring the services
of the mail it is not at present to be
expected that this Department can
aaae sell-sustaining, Dut a gra
dual approach to this end, from year
to year, is confidently relied on and
the day is not far distant when the
Fost Office Department of the gov
ernment will prove a mufh greater
blessing to the people than it is now.
The suggestions of the Postmaster
General for improvements in the De
partment provided over by him, are
earnestly recommended to 3rour spe
cial attention. Especially do I re
commend to your favorable consid
eration the plan for uniting the tel
egraph system of the United States
with the postal s'stem. It is be
lieved bv such a course the cost of
telegraphing could be much reduced
and the service as well if not better
rendered. It would secure the fur
ther advantange by extending the
telegraph through portions of the
country where private enterprises
will not construct it. Commerce,
trade, and above all, the efforts to
bring a people widely separated into
community of interests, are always

tails of the operations of last year,
and for the comparative statements
results with former years.
There has been imposed upon the
government the execution of the act
Congress, approved April 20th,
1871, and commonly known as the
"Ku-Klux Law,' in a portion of the
State of South Carolina. The neces
sity of the course pursued will be
demonstrated by the report of the
committee appointed to investigate
Southern outrages. Under the pro
visions of the above act, I issued a
proclamation, calling the attention
it
ot
of
be
the
of the people of the United States to
the same and declaring my reluc
tance to exercise any of the extraor
dinary powers thereby conferred up
on men, except in case of imperative
necessity, but making known my
purpose to - exercise sucn power
whenever it should become necessary
to do so, for the purpose of securing
to all citizens of the United States
the peaceful enjoyment of the rights
guaranteed to them by the constitu
tion and the laws.
After the passage of this law in
formation was received, from time
to time, tbat combinations of the
character referred to in its provisions
existed and were powerful in many
parts of the Southern States, partic
ularly in certain counties in the State
of South Carolina. Careful investi
gation was made and it was ascer
tained that in nine counties of that
State such combinations were active
and powerful, embracing a sufficient
portion of the citizens to control the
local authority; and having, among
other things object of depriving
the emancipated class of the sub
stantial benefits of freedom and of
preventing free political action of
those citizens whodid not sympathize
with their own views. Among their
operations, were frequent scourgings
and occasional assassinations, gener
ally perpetrated at night by disguised
persons, the victims in almost all
cases being citizens of different po
litical sentiments from their own, or
free persons who had shown a dispo
position to claim equal rights with
other citizens. lhousands of in
offensive and well disposed citizens
were the sufferers by this lawless vi
olence.
Thereupon, on the 13th of Octo
ber, 1871, a proclamation was issued
in the terms of the law, calling upon
the members of such combinations
to disperse within five daj-s, and to
deliver to the marshal or military
officers of the United States all arms
ammunitions, uniforms, disguises
and other means and implements
used by them for carrying out their
unlawful purposes. This warning
not having been heeded, on the 17th
of October another proclamation
was issued, suspending the priv
ilege of the writ of habeas corpus in
nine counties. In that, direction
was given that within the counties
so designated, persons supposed, up
on creditable information, to be
members of such unlawful combina
tions should be arrested by the mil
itary forces of the United States,
and delivered to the Marshal to be
dealt with according to law. In two
of said counties (York and Spar
tansburg,) many arrests have been
made. At the last account, the
number of persons thus arrested was
168.- beveral hundred, whose crim
inality was ascertained to be of an
inferior degree, were released for
the present. These have generally
mady conlessions of their guilt
Great caution has been exercised
in making test arrests; and notwith
standing the large number, it is be
lievea no innocent person is now
in custody. The prisoners will be
held for regular trial before judicial
tribunals of the United States. As.
soon as it appeared that the author!
ties of the United States were about
to take vigorous measures to enforce
the law, many persons absconded,
and there is good ground for sup
posing that all of such persons have
violated the law. A full report of
what has been done under this law
will be submitted to Congress by
the Attorney General.
POLYGAMY.
In Utah there still remains a rem
nant of barbarism, repugnant to civ
ilization, decency and to the laws of
the United States, Territorial offi
cers, however, have been found, who
are willing to perform their duty in
a spirit of equity and with a due
sense of sustaining the majesty of
the law. Neither polygamy nor any
other violation of existing statutes,
will be permitted within the terrto-
ry of the United States. It is not
with the religion of the self-styled
"Saints," that we are now dealing;
but their practices. They will be
protected in the worship of God ac
cording to the dictates of their con
sciences, but they will not be per
mitted to violate the laws under the
cloak of religion. It may be advis
able for Congress to consider what,
in the execution of laws against
polygamy, is to be the status of
plural wives and their offspring. The
propriety of Congress passing an en
abling act, authorizing the Territo
rial Legislature of Utah to legitimat
ize all born prior to a time fixed in
the act, might be justified by its
humanity to those innocent children
This is a suggestion only, and not a
recommendation.
THE INDIAN POLICY.
The policy pursued toward the In
dians has resulted favorably, so far
as can be judged from the limited
time during which it has been in
operation. Through the exertions
of the various societies of Chris
tians to whom has been intrusted the
execution of the policy, and the
Board of Commissioners authorized
by the law of April 10, 1869, many
tribes of Indians have been induced
to settle upon reservations to culti
vate the soil and perform productive
labor of various kinds, and partially
to accept civilization. They are
being cared for in such way, it is
hoped, as to induce those still pur
suing tne oia naDits 01 me to em
brace the only opportunity which is
left them to avoid extermination. I
recommend liberal appropriations to
carry ont the Indian peace policy
not only because it is humane.Chns
tian-like and economical,but because
is right
I recommend to your favorable
consideration, also, the policy of
granting a territorial government to
Indians in the Indian territory west
Arkansas and Missouri and south
Kansas. In doing so, every right
guaranteed to Indians by treaty
snouia De secured, cucn a course
might in time be the means of col
letting most of the Indians now be
tween the Missouri and the Pacific,
and south of the BritishPossessions,
into one territory or into one State.
The Secretary of the Interior has
treated upon this subject at length,
and l recommend to you his Bug
gestions.
I renew my recommendation that
public lands be regarded as a
heritage to our children, to be dis
posed of only as required for occu
pation by actual settlers. Those al
ready granted have been in a great
part disposed of in such a way as to
secure access to the balance by the
hardy settler who way wish to avail
himself of them ; but caution should
exercised even 'n attaining so de
sirable an object Educational in
terests may well be served by the
grant of the proceeds of the sale of
public lands to settlers. I do not
wish to be understood as recom
mending, in the least degree, a cur
tailment of what is being done by
general government for the en
couragement of education.
KEPORT OF SECRETARY OP INTERIOR,
Tho report of the Secretary of the
if
it
Interior, submitted with this, will
give jou Information collected and
prepared for publication in regard to
the census taken during the year
1870. 3
The operations of the Bureau of
Education for the year; the Patent
Office; the Pension Office; the Land
Uace; and the Indian Bureau.
The report of the Commissioner of
Agriculture gives the operations of
this department for the year. As
agriculture is the ground.work of
our prosperity, too much importance
cannot be attached to the labors of
this department, which is in the
hand3 of an able head, with able as
sistants, all zealously devoted to in
troducing the agricultural pro
duction to any of the various cli
mates and soils of our vast territory,
and to giving all useful information
as to the msthods of cultivation of
the plants, cereal'j or other products
adapted to particular localities.
Quietly, but surely, the Agricultural
Bureau is working a great national
good, and it liberally supported, the
more widely its influence will be ex
tended, and the less dependent we
shall be upon the products of foreign
countries.
COMPENSATION OF HEADS OF BUREAUS.
The subject of compensation to
the heads of Bureaus and officials
holding positions of responsibility
and requiring ability and charater to
to fill properly, is one to which your
attention is invited. But few of the
officials receive a compensation equal
to the respectable support of a fam
ily, while their duties are such as to
involve millions of interest. In pri
vate life, services demand compen
sation equal to the services rendered;
a wise economy would dictate the
same rule in the government ser
vice. I have not given the estimates for
the suport of the Government for
the ensuing year, nor the compara
tive statement between the expendi
tures for the year iust p3t and the
one just preceding, because all these
figures are contained in the accom
panying reports, as in those presen
ted directly to Congress. These es
timates have my approval.
THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT.
More than six years have elapsed
since tne last nostue gun was. nred
between the armies then arrayed
against each other the one for the
prepetuation and the other for the
destruction, ot tne union, it may
well be considered whether it is not
now time that the disabilities iinpos
ed by the 14th amendment should
be removed. That amendment does
not exclude the ballot, but only re
quires the disability to hold office of
certain classes. When the purity of
tne ballot is secure, the majorities
are sure to elect officers reflectin,
the views of the majority. I do not
see the advantage or propriety of
excluding from office merely thev
who were before the rebellion of
standing and character sufficient to
be elected to positions requinn
them to take the oath to support the
Constitution, and admitting those
entertaining precisely tne same
views, but of less standing in their
communities. It may be said, that
the former violated an oath, while
the latter did not have it in their
power to do so. If they had taken
this oath, it cannot be doubted they
would have broken it, as did the
former class. If there are any great
criminals, distinguished above all
others for the part they took in op
position to the government, - they
might, in the judgment of Congress
be excluded from such an amnesty,
This subject is submitted for your
caretul consideration.
KU-KLUX.
The condition of the Southern
States is unhappily such, that all
true patriotic citizens would like to
see social ostracism for opinion'
sake abolished. Personal violence
or threats, towards persons enter
taining political views opposed to
those entertained by the majority of
tne old citizens, prevents immigra
tion and the flow of much needed
capital into the States lately in re
beiuon. It will be a happy condi
tion of the country, when the old
citizens of those States will take an
interest in public affairs, promulgate
ideas honesty obtained, vote for men
representing their views, and permit
tne same freedom of expression and
ballot in those entertaining different
political convictions.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Under the provisions of the act of
Congress approved February 21st,
io(j. a territorial government was
organized in the District of Colum
bia. The results have thus far fully
realized tne expectations of it? ad
vocates. Under the direction of the
territorial officers, a system of im
provements has been inaugurated, by
means of which Washington is rap
idly Decerning a city worthy of the
Nation's Capitol. The citizens of
the District having voluntarily taxed
themselves to & large amount, for the
purpose of contributing to the ad
vancement of the seat of govern
ment, I recommend liberal appropri-
tions on tne part ot Congress, in or
der that the Government may bear
its just snare of the expense of carry
ing out a judicious system of im
provements.
THE CHICAGO FIRE.
By the great fire in Chicago, the
most important of the government
Duildings in that city were con
sumed. Those burned had already
become inadequate to the wants of
the government in that growing city:
and, looking to the future, were to
tally inadequate. I recommend,
therefore, that an appropriation be
made immediately to purchase the
remainder of the square on which
the burnefPbuildings stood, provided
it can be purchased at a fair valua
tion, and provided the Legislature
of Illinois will pass a law authoriz
ing its condemnation for govern
ment purpose, also, an appropriation
of as much money as can properly
be expended towards the erection of
new buildings during this fiscal
year.
PROTECTION OF IMMIGRANTS.
The number of immigrants, ignor
ant of our laws and habits coming
into our country annually, has be
come so great and the impositions
practiced upon them so numerous
and flagrant, that I suggest Congres
sional action for their protection.
It seems to me a fair subject of leg
islation by Congress. I cannot now
state as fully as I desire the nature
of the complaints made by immi
grants of the treatment they receive,
but will endeavor to do so during
the session of Congress; particularly
the subject should receive your
attention.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
It has been the aim of the Admin
istration to enforce honesty and effi
ciency in all public offices. Every
public servant who has violated the
trust placed in him, has been pro
ceeded against with all the rigor of
law. If bad men have secured places

which would enforce this principle
against all endorsers of persons for
public place, would insure great cau
tion in making recommendations.
A salutary lesson has been taught
the careless and dishonest servants,
in the great number of prosecutions
and convictions of the last two
years.
It is gratifying to notice the favor
able change which is taking place
throughout the country in bringing
to punishment those who have
proved recreant to the trusts con 8
ded to them, and in elevating to pub
lic office none buttho3e who possess
the confidence of the honest and vir
tuous, who it will alwaj-s be found
comprise the majority of the commu
nity in which they live.
In my message to Congress a year
ago, I urgently recommended reform
in the Civil Service of the country.
In conformity with that recommen
dation, Congress, in the 9th section
of an act making an appropriation
for sundry civil expenses of the gov
ernment' and for other purposes, ap
proved March 3d, 1871, gave the nec
essary authority to the Executive to
inaugurate a Civil Service reform,
and placed upon him the responsi
bility of doing so under authority of
said act I convened a board of gen
tlemen eminently qualified for the
work, to devise rules and regula
tions to effect the needed reform.
Their labors are not yet complete,
but it is believed that they will bqc
oeed in devising a plan which can be
adapted to the great relief of the
Executive, the heads of departments
and members of Congress, and which
will redound to the true interest of
the public service. At all events,
the experiment shall have a fair
trial.
I have thu3 hastily summed up
the operations of the Government
during the last year and made such
ggestions as occur to me to be
proper lor your consideration. 1
submit them with a confidence that
your combined action will be wise
and statesmanlike, and in the best
interest of the whole country.
