TIVBS:?
In transmitting to you this my fourth annual Mes
sage, it la with thankfulness to the Giver of all
good that as a nation we have been blessed for the
last year with peace at home* and abroad and a
general prosperity vouchsafed to but lew peoplo
?ith the exception of the recent devastating flre
which swept from the earth with a breath, as it
were, millions of accumulated wealth in the oity
of Boston, there has been no overshadowing
calamity within the year to record. It is gratify
ing to note how, like their lellow citizens oi the
fity of Chicago under similar circumstances a year
earlier, the citizens of Boston are rallying under
their misfortunes, with the prospect that
/their engergy and perseverance will overcome
a obstacles and show the same prosperity they
would have enjoyed had no disaster beiallen them
Otherwise we have been iree from pestilence, war
and calamities which often overtake nations, and,
as far as human judgment can penetrate the future'
no cause seems to exist to threaten our present
ipeace. When Congress adjourned in June last a
/question had been raised by Great Britain, and
-was then pending, which lor a time seriously im
perilled the settlement by friendly arbitration of the
prave ditrerences between this government aud
,that of Her Britannic Majesty, which, by
TUB 1BKATT OF WASHINGTON,
Had been referred to the tribunal of arbitration
which had met at Geneva, in Switzerland. The
arbitrators, however, disposed oi the question,
which had jeopardized the whole of the treaty
and threatened to involve the two nations in
moat unhappy relations toward cacli other in
a manner entirely satisfactory to this govern
ment and in accordanco with the views and
the policy which it had maintained. The tribunal
which had convened in Geneva In December con
eluded its laborious session on the 14th day of
September last, on which day, having availed itself 1
of the discretionary Dower given to it by the treaty
to award a Bum in gross, it made Its decision,
whereby it awarded the sum of $10,500,000 in gold
as the indemnity to be paid by Great. Britain to the
United States for the satisfaction ol all the claims
referred to Its consideration. This decision hap
pily disposes of a long-stauding difference between
the two governments, and, in connection with an
other award made by the German Emperor under
a reforence to him by the same treaty, leaves these
two governments without a shadow upon the
friendly relations, which It la njy sincere 1
hope rn.iy forever remain equally unclouded. ?
Ihe report ot the agent of the United
States appointed to attcud the Geneva trlbu- I
nal. accompanied by the protocols of the pro
ceedings of the arbitrators, the arguments of the
counsel of both governments, the award of the
tribunal and the opinions given by the several
arbitrators, Is transmitted herewith. 1 have caused
to be communicated to the heads of the three
friendly Powers who complied with the joint re
quest made to them under the treaty the thanks of
this government for the appointment of arbitra
trators made by them respectively, and also my !
thanks to the eminent personages named by them
and my appreoiation of the dignity, patience, iiUl
partiality and great ability with which they dis
charged their arduous and high functions. Iler
Majesty's government has communicated to me
Us appreciation by Her Majesty-ol the ability and
Indefatigable industry displayed by Mr. Adams,
the arbitrator named on the part of this govern'
ment, during the protracted inquiries and discus
sious of the tribunal.
CONGRATULATIONS a\D THANKS.
I cordiaily unite with ller Majesty in this appre
ciation. it is due to the agent of the United
States before the tribunal to record my high appre
ciation of the marked ability, unwearied patience
and the prudence and discretion with which he has
conducted the very responsible and delicate duties
committed to him; as It Is also due to the learned
and eminent counsel who attended the tribunal on

Til8 SAN JUAN DECISION.
Copies of the case presented on behalf of eacn
government, and or the statement In reply or
each, and a translation or the award, are trans
mitted herewith. This award conflrms tho United
stales in their claim to the miportanl urchi cUKO
or islands lying between the Continent and van
couver's Island, which for more thM twenty-six
years?ever since the ratification of t^e lreaty
Great Hrlt iln has contested, and le*'es u? for the
first time in the history of the I nlted Htat.s as a
nation without a ciuestlon of dlspated honndajry
iietwcen our territory aud the possessions ofClieat
Britain on this Continent. It is my grateiui
duty to acknowledge the prompt, spontanMus
action of ller Majesty's gove.nmt t in elv
ing cffcct to the award. In anticipation
of any request from this government
aud before the reception in t"e United
states of the award signed by the Kmperor, Her
Majesty had given Instructions lor the removal of
uer troops winch had been stationed there, and for
t he cessation of all exorcise or claim of Jurisdiction,
so as to leave the United States In exclusive pos
session of the lately disputed territory. I am
gratified to be able to announce that tho orders for
i he removal of the troops have been executed and
the military joint occupation of San Juan has
ceased. The islands are now tn exclusive posses
sion of the United States. It now becomes neces
sary to complete the survoy and determination of
that portion of the boundary line through the Haro
Channel upon which the Commission which deter
mined the remaining part of the line wero unable
to agree. I recommend
TIIK APPOINTMENT OF A COMMISSION
to act jointly with oue which may be named by ner
Majesty for that purpose. Experience of the diffi
culties attending the determination of our ad
mitted line of boundary after the occupation of tho
territory and its settlement by those ?wing alle
giance to the respective governments Points to> tho
importance of establishing, by natuial objects or
other monuments, the actual line between the ter
ritory acquired by purchaso Irom Kuasla and tho
adjoining possession or Her Britannic Majesty.
The region is now bo sparBelyocciiptcd that uo
conflicting interests of individuals or of JurJ?
diction arc likely to interfere to tho delay or
embarrassment of the actual location , of the
line If deferred until population shall enter
and occupy the territory sonic trivial contest
or neighbors thay again array the two govern
ments in antagonism. 1 therefore "^""^f.^lth
appointment or a commission, to act Jointly witn
oue that may be appointed on the part of Or??'
Britain, to determine the line between our. J??r*"r
tor* of Alaska and the conterminous possessions or
1 Great Britain. In my last annual Message 1 recom
mended the legislation necessary on the parti or
the United States to bring_Into operation the arti
cles or the Treaty or Washington or May, ltni,
relating to the fisheries and to other matters
touching the relations or tho United States toward
the British North American possessions, to become
nner&tivc so soon as the proper legislation should
oehadon the part of Great Britain and its posses
8l<That legislation on the part or Great Brltain and
Its possessions had not then ??en had, and ?lur g
the session or Congress a action by
Tor tho time created ft doubt whether any action y
Congress In the direction indicated would become
lmnortant. This question has since oeen dispose d
or and 1 have received notice that the Imperial
Parliament and the Legislature of the provincial
irovcrnment have passed laws to carry the
provisions of the treaty on tho matters referred
to into operation. 1 therefore recomnien
vour early adoption of tho legislation lu
the same direction necessary on thoi part
of this government. l'he joint coramtB
slon lor determining the boundary line be
| tweenthe United States aud the British possos
! Kions between the l<ako of the Woods and tho
Rocky Mountains has organized and entered upon
its work. It is desirable that the force be in
i creased lu order that the completion ol the survey
and the determination or the line may bo the
! Boouer attained. To this end I recommend that a
suillcient appropriation be made.
i FH1RNDLY RELATIONS WITH KOHBION POWKR9.
1 With France^ our earliest ally; Russia, the con
1 stant and steady rrlend or the United States; Ger
: manv. with whose government and people we have
so many causes of lriendship and so many cominon
i sympathies, aud the other Powers of Europe, our
i relations are maintained on the most lrlendly
i t6Since my last annual message the exchange has
been made of the ratification of a treaty with the
i Austro-Hungarlan Empire relating to naturall/a
tlon, also of a treaty with tho German Empire re
specting consuls and trademarks; also of a treaty
with Swcdeu and Norway relating to naturalUa
tion, all of which treaties have been duly pro
claimed. Congress at its last session having made
an appropriation to defray the expense of commis
sionoca on the part OT the United states to the in
ternational Statistical Congress at St. Petersburg,
the persons appointed In that character proceeded
to their destination and attended the sessions ol
'the Congress. Their report shall, in due season,
be laid bclore vou. Tills Congress meets at Inter
vals of about throe years, and has held Its sessions
in several of the countries of Europe. I submit to
your consideration the propriety or extending an
invitation to the Congress to hold its next meeting
in the United States.
T11K CENTENNIAL CELBBUATION
to be held In 1876 would afford an appropriate oc
casion for such meeting l'leparationsaromakng
lor the international Exposition to be held during
tho next year iu Vienna on a scale ol very great man
nfude. The tendency of these expositions is in
the direction or advanced civilization and ol the
elevatiou or industry and 01 labor, and or the iu_
crease of human hapniuess, as well as of greater
Intercourse and good will between uaUous. As
this exposition Is to be the Hrst which wIU have
been held In Eastern Europe It Is to be
that American inventors and mauulacturers will
be ready to avail themselves or tho opportu
nity ror the preseutation of their productions
ir encouraged by proper aid aud protection.
At the last session or congress authority
was given ror the appointment of one or more
agents to represent this government at the oxpo
Bition. Tno authority thus given has been exer
cised, but In the absence or any appropriation
there is danger that tlie Important benefits which
the occasion oilers will In a large degree be lost to
citizens ol the United States. T commend the sub
ject strongly to your consideration, and recom
mend that an adequate appropriation be made lor
the purpose. To lurther aid American exhibitors
I at the Vienna Exposition 1 would recommend, In
! addition to an appropriation or money, that the
Secretary ot the Navy be authorized to tit up two
I naval vessels to transport between our Atlantic
cities and Trieste, or the moBt convenient port to
Vienna and back, their articles lor exhibition.
MEXICO AND THE BOKDKlt OUTRAGES.
Since your last session tho President of the Mexi
can Bepubllc, distinguished by his high character
and by his services to his country, has died. His
temporary successor has now been elected with
gieat unanimity by the people, a prool pr confldenco
on tlielr part In Ills patriotism aud wisdom which,
It is believed, will be confirmed by the results o his
administration. It is Particularly desirable that
nothing should be leit undone by the government
or either Republic to strengthen tnclr relations as
neighbors ai.d friends. It Is much to> be regretted
that many lawless acts continue to disturb the
uulet or the settlements on tlie border between
our territory aud that of Mexico, and that coin
Dlaints of wrongs to American citizens in many
Darts ol the country are made. The revolutionary
condition In which the neighboring Republic
has so long been involved has in some degree coil
I tributed to tins distuibance. It s to be hoped
l that, with a more settled rule or order through the
| Republic, which may i?e expected I rom the present
' government, the acts ot which just
made will oease. Tho proceedlugs or the commU
slon under the convention with Mexico, or the 4th
pf July, 180s, on llie subject or claims, have un
fortunately been checked by an obstacle Jot thfl
removal or which measures have been taken by
' the two governments, winch, It la believed, will
; Drove suecessinl. The commissioners appointed,
pursuant to the joint resolution of Congress or tho
: Ttii or May last, to Inquire Into depredations
i on tho Texan frontier, have diligently made
! investigation): in that quarter. fnelr report
upon the subject will bo communicated to you.
1 Their researches wero necessarily incomplete,
i partly on account or the limited appropriation
made by Congress. Mexico, on the part of that
government, has appointed a similar commission
' to investigate these outrages. It is not announced
officially, but the press of that country states that
the fullest investigation Is desired, and that tho
co-operation of all parties concerned is invited to
securo that end. 1 therefore recommend that a
BD'-ml appropriation be made at the earliest aay
practicable to enable the commissioners on the
part or the United States to return to their labors
without delay.
ITHE CUBAN WAR*
It is with regret thai 1 have again to announce ft
i continuance or the disturbed condition ol tho
Island ot Cuba. No advance toward the paclflca
I tion of the discontented part or the population has
' been made, while the Insurrection has gained no
advantages aud exhibits no more of the elements
of power or of the prospects of ultimate
i success than were exhibited a yeur ago. Spain, on
i the other hand, has not succeeded In Its repres
sion, aud the parties stand apparently In the samo
relative attitude which they nave occupied for a
long time past. This contest has lasted now lor
more than four tears. Were It seen at a distance
from our neighborhood we might be indifferent
to Its results, although humanity could not be un
moved by many of Its Incidents wherever
tney might occur, it Is, however, at our door and
I cannot douut that the continued maintenance of
slavery lu Cuba Is among the strongest Induce
ments'to the continuance or this strife. A terrible
wrong is the natural cause or a terrible evil. Ihe
abolition or slaver/ and the Introduction or other
reforms in the administration of government in
Cuba could not fall to advance the restoration or
peace and order. It Is especially to be hoped that
the present liberal government orSoaln wAl *oMili
tarily adopt this view. Tho law or emancipation
which was passed more than two years since has
remained unexecuted, In the absence or regula
tions tor its enforcement. It was but a fceh{i*!'cD
i towards emancipation, bnt It was the reoognltlnn
or right and was hailed as such, and ex
I hlblted spam In harmony with sentiments of
humanity and ot justice, and in sympathy
I wita tuo other Towers of the christian
an<l civilized world. Within the past few weeks
the regulations for carrying out the law of eman cl
pation have been anuounced, giving evidence of
i;tie sincerity of iutention of the present govern
ment to carry into effect the law of 1870. I have
not lalled to urge the consideration of the wisdom,
the policy and the justice of a more efllclent
system for the aliolltlou of the great evil which
oppresses a race and continues a bloody ana
destructive contest close to our border, as well as
the expediency and the justice of conceding re
forms of which the propriety is not questioned;
deeply impressed with the conviction that the con
tinuance of slavery Is one ol the most active causes
or the continuance of the unBftppy condition In
Cuba. I regret to bellow that citizens of the
United States, or those, claiming to bo such, are
large holders iu Cuba of what Is thore claimed as
property, but which is forbidden aud denounced
by the laws of the United States. They are thus, in
defiance of the spirit ol onr own laws, contributing
to the continuance of this distressing and sicken
ing contest. In my I ist annual message 1 referred
to this subject, aud 1 again rocommoud such legis
lation as may be proper to denounce, and if not
prevent, at least to discourage, American citizens
from holding or dealing in slaves. It is gratifying
to announce that the ratillcatiou of the convention
concluded under the auspices or this government
between Spain, on the one part, and the allied
republics of the Pacific on the other, providing for
an armistice, has boeu exchanged. A copy of the
instrument Is herewith submitted. It is hoped
that this may be followed by a permanent peace
between the same parties.
TflB SOUTH AMERICAN BBPUBMCS.
The differences which at one time threatened
the maintenance of peace between Brazil and the
Argentine Itepubllc ft is hoped are in the way ol
satisfactory adjustment. With these States, as
with the republics of Ceatral and South America,
we continue to maintain the most friendly rela
tions. It is with regret, however, I announce that
the government of Venezuela has made no further
payments on account of the awards under the con
vention of the 20th of April, I860. That Republic is
understood to be uow almost, If not quite, tranquil
lized. It is hoped, therefore, that It will lose no
time in providing for the unpaid balance of its debt
to the United States, which, having originated In
Injuries to Its citizens by Venezuelan authori
ties and having been acknowledged pursuaut
to ' a treaty tn the moat solemn form
known among nations, would seem to deserve
a preference over debts of a different origin and
contracted in a different manner. This subject is
again recommended to the attention of Congress
for such action as may be deemed proper. Our
treatv relations with Japan remain unchanged. An
Imposing embassy from that interesting and pro
gressive nation visited this country during .the
year that Is passing, but, being unprovided with
powers for the signing of a convention In this
country, no conclusion In that direction was
reached. It Is hoped, however, that the Inter
change of opinions which took place during their
stay In this country lias led to a mutual apprecia
tion of the interest which may be promoted when
the revisiou or tlio existing treaty shall be under
taken In this connection. I renew my recommen
dation of one year ago, that to give Importance
and to add to the efficiency of our
DIPLOMATIC ltRI.ATlON.H WITI1 JAI'AN AND CI1INA,
and to lurthcr aid in retaining the good opinion, of
those peoples, and to secure to the United States
its sharo of the commerce destined to now be
tween those nations and the balance of .thei com
mercial world, an appropriation be made to sup
port at least four Amerlcau youths in each of these
countries, to serve as a part of tho official lamlly
of our Muiistors thore. Our representatives would
not even then bo placed upon an equality with the
representatives of (Ireat Britain and of some othei
Powers. As now situated our representatives In
Japan and China have to dopond for Interpreters
and translators upon natives or those countries,
who know our language imperfectly, or procure lor
the occasion the services ol employes in lorcign
business houses or the interpreters to other foreign
Ministers. _ . _
I renew tho recommendation made on a previous
occasion of the transfer to the Department
of the Interior, to wluch they seem more appro
priately to belong, of all the powers and dutlos iu
relation to the territories with which the Depart
ment of state is now charged by law or by custom.
Cougress, from the beginning of the government,
has wisely made provision for the relief of dis
tressed seamen Iu foreign countries. No similar
provision, however, has hitherto been made for
the relief of citizens in distress abroad other
than seamen. It is understood to be cus
tomary with other governments to authorize
consuls to extend such relief to their citizens
or subjects In certain cases. A similar authority
aud an appropriation to carry it Into effect are
commended in caac of citizens of the United States
destitute or sick under suoh circumstances. It is
well known that such citizens resort to foreign
countries in great numbers, though most of them
tie able to bear the expenses incidental to locomo
tion; there are Bome who, through accident or
otherwise, become penniless, and nave no friends
at home able to succor them; persons in this situa
tion must either perish, cast themselves upon the
charity of foreigners ^r be relieved at the private
chargo of our own otncorB, who usually, even with
tlio most benevolent dispositions, have nothing to
spare for such purposes. Should the authority and
appropriation aaied for be grouted care will be
taken to carry the beneficence of Congress into
effect, that it shall not be unnecessarily or un
worthily bestowed.
TDK TREASURY.
Tho moneys received and carried into the Trea
sury during the liscal year ended June 30, 1872,
were:?From customs, $216,870,286; from sales of
public lunds, $2,575,714; from internal revenue,

I sales of coin, $9,412,637. Total net receipts,
' $074,100,1-67. Balance In Treasury June 30, 1871,
! $109,935,705, including $18,228 received from "un

i The net expenditures by warrants dunug the
' same period were:?For civil expenses, $16,189,059;
' for loreign intercourse, $1,839,368; Indians,
$7,061,728; pensions, $28,533,402. For military

$21,249,809; lor miscellaneous civil expenditures,
including public buildings, lighthouses and collect

for redemption of the public dobt,
$99,960,253; total, $106,918,520. Total net dis

June 30, 1872, $18,664,356. Total, $484,042,573. From
the foregoing statement It appears that the net
reduction or the principal or Uio debt during the
fiscal year euding June 30, 1872, was $99,ut>o,253.
The source ot this reduction Is as fellows:?Net
ordinary receipts during the year, $364,094,229;
net ordinary expenditures, including iuterest on
the public debt, $270,509,095; total, $l4, 134,534;
add amount received from premium on sales of
gold in excess of the premium paid on bonds pur
chased, 2,451,370; add the amount of the reduction
ol the cash balauce at the close of the year, ac
companied with the same at the commence
ment of the year, $3,371,348; total, $99,960,203.
This statement treats Bolely of the principal
of the public debt. By the monthly statement of
the public debt, which adds together the principal
aud lutorest due and unpaid, and interest accrued
to date due, and deducts the cash in the Treasury
as ascertained on the day of publication, the
i reduction was $100,544,491. The source ol this rc
i ductlon is as follows:?Keduction In principal ac
! count, $99,960.0i>3; reduction in unpaid interest
account, $3,330,952?total, $103,290,956. deduction
I in cash on hand, $2,74?,460--total. $100,514,491. on
I the basis of the last table, the statements show a
j reduction of the public debt from the 1st or Match,
I 18(>9, to the present time as idlowa :?
I From March 1, 1809 to March 1, 1870, $87,134,782.
1 From March 1, 1870, to March 1, 1871, $117,019,630.
From March 1, 18T1 to March 1, 1872, $94,890,348.
From March 1, 1872. to November 1, 1872, elglit
months, hi,237. ToFaT; $3?li.09i5,999. with tho
greaf reduction of taxation by the acts o) Congress
at its last session, the expenditures of the govern
ment iu collecting the revenue will be much re
duced for the next fiscal year. It is very doubtful,
however, whether any further reduction ol so vexa
tious a burden upon any people will bo practi
cable lor tho present. At all events, as a
measure or juHtlce to the holders or the
nation's certificates or Indebtedness I would
recommend that no more legislation be had on
this subject, unless It be to correct errors ol
omission or commission in the present laws, until
sufficient time has elapsed to prove that it can be
done and still leave sufficient revenue to meet
current expenses or government, pay Interest on
the public debt and provide for the sinking fund
established by law.
The preservation of our national credit is of tho
highest importance. Next In importance to this
comes a solemn duty to provide a national currency
of fixed unvarying value, as compared with gold,
Ac., as soon as practicable, having due regard for
the Interests of the debtor class and the vicissi
tudes of trade and commerce, convertible into gold
at par.
WAR DKPARTME?TT.
The report of the Secretary of War shows the
expenditures of the War Department for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1871, to l>e $35,799,991, and
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872, to bo
$35,372,157, showing a reduction in lavor of tlio
last fiscal year or $427,s:'4. The estimates for mili
tary appropriations for the next fiscal year ending
June 30,-1874, are $33,801,378. The estimates of the
Chief of Engineers are dubmitted separately for
fortifications, river and harbor improvements,
and for public building* and grouuds and the
Washington aqnednct. The affairs of the Freed
men's Bureau have all been transferred to the War
Department, and regulations have been put Into
execution for the speedy payment of bounty
pay, Ac., due colored Boldiors, properly coming
under that bureau. All war accounts for
money and properly prior to 1871 have been ex ?

have been issued to Indians. The annual
average mean strength of the army was 24,101
white and 2,494 colored soldiers. The total deaths
for the year reported were 'Ml white and 52 col
ored. The distribution of the medical and surgical
history or the war is yet to be ordered by Congress.
There exists an absolute neoessity for a medical
corps of the full number established by act of Con
gress of July 23, 1800, there being now fifty-nine
vacancies, and the number of successful candidates
rarely exceeds eight or ten in any one year. The
river and harbor Improvements have been carried
ou with energy aad economy, though many are
only partially completed. The results have saved
to commerce many times the amount expended;
the increase of comiucrce with the greater depth of
channels, greater security in navigation and the
saviug of tune adds millions to the wealth of
the country and increases the resources of the
government. The bridge across the Mississippi
Kiver at Kock Island has been completed, and the
proper s.te has been determined upon for tne bridge
at La Crosse. The able and exhaustive reports
made by the commission appointed to investigate
the Sutro tunnel have been transmitted to Con
gress. The observations and reports of the Signal
Office have been continued. Stations hare been
maintained at eachofthe principal lake, seaport and
river cities. Ten additional stations have been es
tablished in the United States, and arrangements
nave been made lor an exchange of reports with
Canada, and similar exchange of observations is
contemplated with the Wost India islands. The
lavorabie attention of Congress is invited to the
following

paired by reason ol the large amount of time neces
sarily expended In giving new cadets a thorough
knowledge of the more elementary branches of
learning which they should acquire before eutering
the Academy, also an appropriation for philosophi
cal apparatus aud an increase in the numbers and
pay ol the Military Academy band. The attention
of Congress will be called during Its present ses
sion to various enterprises for the
MOKH CERTAIN AN1) CIIEAI'Kll TRANSPORTATION
of the constantly-incrcasing surplus of the West
ern and Southern products to the Atlantic sea
board. Tho subject is one that will force itself
upon tho legislative branch of the government
sooner or latjr, and 1 auggost, therefore, that im
mediate steps be taken to gain ull available infor
mation to lusure equable and just legislation on a
route to connect the Missis sippi Vulley with the
Atlantic at Charleston, S. C., and Savannah, Ga., by
water by the way of the Ohio and Tennessee rivers
and canals and slack water navigation to the
savannah and Octnulgee rivers. Tim route has boon
surveyed and a report made by an accomplished en
gineer officer of the army. Second aud third, new
routes will be proposed for the consideration of
Congress?namely, by an extension of the
Kanawha and James Hlver Canal to the Ohio,
aud by the extension ot the Chesapeake and Ohio
Canal. I am not prepared to recommend govern
ment aid to these or other enterprises until It is
clearly shown that they are not only or national
Interest, but that when completed they will be of
a value commensurate with their cost. That pro
duction increases more rapidly than the means of
transportation in our country has been demon
strated by past experience; that tho unprecedented
growth in population and products of the whole
country will require additional facilities and
cheaper ones for the more bulky articles of com
merce to rcach tide-water and a market will be de
manded in the near luture 1b equally demonstrable.
1 would therefore suggest either a committee or
commission to be authorized to consider this whole
3uestion, and to report to Congress at some luture
av, for its better guidance in legislating on this
important subject.
THE RAILROADS OP THK COUNTRY
have been rapidly extended during the last few
years to meet tho growing demands of producers,
and reflect much credit upon the capitalists and
managers engaged in their construction. In ad
dition to these a project to facilitate commerce by
the building of a ship canal around Niagara (alls
on tho United States side, which has been agitated
for many years, will, no doubt, be called to your
atteutiou this session. Looking to tho great
future growth ol the country and the Increasing
demands ol commerce, it might bo well, while
on this subject, not only to have ex
amined and reported upon the various
practicable routes for connecting the Mis
sissippi with tide water on the Atlantic,
but the feasibility of an almost continuous laud
locked navigation from Maine to the Guir of
Mexico. Such a route along our coaBt would bo of
great value at all times, and or inestimable value
In case of a foreign war. Nature has provided the
greater part of this route, and the obstacles to be
overcome arc easily within the skill of the engi
neer. 1 have not alluded to this subject with the
view of haviug any further expenditure of
public money at this time than may be necessary
to procure and place all the necessary information
before Congress in an authentic form, to enable it
hcrcalter, if deemed practicable and worthy, to
legislate on the subject without delay.
NAVY DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy, here
with accompanying, explains lully the condition
ol that branch of the public service, its wants aud
deficiencies, expenses Incurred during the past
year and appropriations for the same. It also
gives a complete history of the services of the navy
lor the past year iu addition to its regular service.
It is evident that uuless steps are tuken to pre
serve our navy in a very few years the United
Statos will be the weakest nation upon the ocean
or all great Powers. With an energetic, progressive,
business people like ours, operating and forming
business relations with every part of the known
world, a navy strong enough to command the re
spect of our flag abroad Is necessary for the full
protection of their rights.
1 recommend careful consideration by Congress
of the recommendations made by tho Secretary of
the Navy.
POST OFFICE DEPAHTMKNT.
The accompanying report of the Postmaster
General furnishes a lull ani satisfactory exhibit of
the operations of the Post Office Department dur
ing the year. The ordinary revenues ol the depart
ment lor the fiscal year ending Juno 30, ib'2,
amounted to $2l,9l6,42ri, aud the expenditures to
$211,058,192. Compared with the previous fiscal year
the increase of revenue was $1,878,380, or 937 per
cent and the increase or expenditures $2,268,088, or
929 per cent, adding to the ordinary revenues the
annual appreciation or $700,000 for free matter
and the amounts paid to the subsidized
mail steamship lines rrom special appropriations.
Tho deficiency paid out ol tho general Treasury
was $.yn7,703, an excess of $389,707 over the defi
Cleacy for the year I871. other interesting statis
tical information relating to our rapidly extending
postal service is furnished in this report. Tho
total length of railroad mail routes on the 30th of
June, 1872, was 57,911 miles, 8,077 additional miles
01 such service having beeu put into operation
durtug the year. Eight uew lines of railway post
offices have been established, with an aggregate
length 01 2,909 miles. The number ot letters ex
changed in the malls with foreign countries was
24,302,500, an increase of 4,0?d,502, or twentv
per cent over the number in 1871; aud
tho postage thereon amouuted to $1,871,267 25.
The total weight ol the malls exchanged with
European countries exceeded 820 tons. Tho cost
of tho United States transatlantic mall steamship
service was $220,301; the total cost of the United
States ocean steamship service, including the
amounts paid to the subsidized lines of mail steam
ers, was $1,027,020. The following are tho only
steamship lines now receiving subsidies for mall
service:?Under especial acts or Congress the
Pacific Mall Steamship Company receives $500,000
per unuum for conveying a monthly mail between
San Francisco, Japan and China, which will be in
creased to $1,000,000 per annnin for a semi-monthly
mall on aud alter October 1, 1873; the United
States and lirazll Mail Steamship Company receive
$l&o,ooo per annum for conveying a monthly'
mall between New York and Rio Janeiro,
Brazil, and the California, Oregon and Mexico
Steamship Company receive $76,000 per annum
ror carrying a monthly mail between San FranclBco
and Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, making the total
amount of mall steamship subsidies at pres
ent $726,000 per annum, our postal communi
cations with all parts of the civilized world
have been placed upon a most advantageous
footing by the improved postal conventions aud
arrangements recently concluded with the lead
ing commercial countries or Europe and Amer
ica, and the gratirylng statement is made tlrat
with the conclusion or a ratlsiactory conven
tion with Prance, the details of which have been
definitely agreed toby the head of the French postal
department, subject to the approval of the Minister
of Finance, little remains to be accom
plished by treaty for some time to come
with resi-cct either to reduction of rates
or improved racilitles of postal Intercourse.
Your favorable consideration is respectfully
Invited to the recommendations mado by the
Postmaster General for an lucrease or service?from
monthly to semi-monthly trips on the mall steam
Bhtp route to Brazil; for a subsidy inside of the
establishment of an American line of steamers be
t???u ktmwwo, Muwr ftmiftuU wia AptraiMj
for the establishment of post office aaTtngs ba?5"i
and for the increase of tne salaries of the beads of
bureaus. I have heretofore recommended
TUB ABOLITION OP TUB FRANKING PBIVltBOB,
and see no reason now for changing my views on
that subject. It uot having beeu favorably re
garded by Congress, however, I now BU*8CSt a
modification of that privilege to correct Its glaring
and costly abuses. 1 would recommend also tne
appointment of a committee or commission to
take into consideration the best method eauitauie
to private corporations who have Invested tneir
time and capital In the establishment of telegraph
lines of acquiring the title to all telegraph lines
now In operation, and of connecting this service
wltU the postal service of the nation. It is not
probable that this subjeot could reoeivo the proper
consideration during the limits of a short session
of Congress, but It may be Initiated so that lurther
actlou may be fair to the government and to
private parties concerned.
There are but three lines of ocean steamers?
namely, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, be
tween Han Francisco, China and Japan, with provi
sion made for semi-monthly service alter October
1,1873; the United States and Brazil, monthly, and
the California, New Zealand and Australian line,
monthly?plying between the United States and
foreign pons, and owned and operated under our
ilag. I earnesly recommend that such
L1UKHAL CONTRACTS FOB CARRYING THE MAI 1.8
be authorized witli these lines as will insure their
contlnuauce. If the expediency of extending the aid
of government to lines of steamers which hitherto
have not received it should be deemed worthy of
the consideration of Congress political and com
mercial objects make It advisable to bestow such
aid on a line under our flag between Panama and
the western south American ports. By tins means
much trade now diverted to other countries might
be brought to us, to the mutual advantage or this
country and those lying In that quarter or
the Continent of America. The report of
the Secretary of the Treasury will show
an alarming (ailing off In our carrying
trade (or tne last ten or twelve years and
even for the past year. I do not believe that public
treasure cau be better expended In the interest of
the whole people than In trying to recover this
trade. An expenditure of $5,ooo,ooo per annum for
the next five years, If It would restore to us our
proportion of the carrying trade of the world, would
be protltably expended. The price of labor In
Europe has so much enhanced within the last row
years that the cost of building and operating ocean
steamers In the United states Is not so much greater
thau in Europe, and I believe the time has arrived
for congress to take this subject Into serious con
sideration.
DEPARTMENT OP JUSTICE.
Detailed statements of the disbursements
through the Department or Justice will be fur
nished by the report or the Attorney General,
though these have been somewhat increased
bv the recent acts of Congress to enlorce the rights
01 citizens of the United States to vote in the
several States of the Union, and to enforce the
provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to tne
Constitution of the United States and the amend
ments thereto. I cannot question the necessity
and salutary effect of these enactments, kcck
less and lawless men, I regret to say, haveasso
clated themselves together In some localities
to deprive other citizens of the rights guaran
teed to them by the constitution oi the United
States, and to that end have committed deeds
of blood and vlolenoe. But the prosecution
and punishment or many or these persons have
tended greatly to the repression or such disorders.
I do not doubt that a great majority or the people
in all parts or the couutry ravor the lull enjoyment
by all classes or persons of those rights to which
they are entitled uuder the constitution and laws,
aud i Invoke the aid and influence of all good clti
zeus to prevent organizations whose objects are,
by unlawftil means, to Interfere with those rights.
I look with confidence to the time, not lar distant,
when the obvious advantages of good order and
peace will Induce an abandonment ol all combina
tions prohibited by the ucts reforred to, and when
it will be unnecessary to carry on prosecutions
or Inflict punlshmeuts to protect citizens irotn
the lawless doings of such combinations. Ap
plications have been made to me to pardon
persons convicted or a violation or said acts, upon
the grouud that clemency In such cases would tend
to tranquillize the public mind, and to test the
virtue or that policy 1 am disposed, as far us my
sense or justice will permit, to give to these appli
cations a favorable consideration; but any action
thereon Is not to be construed as Indicating any
change In my determination to enforce with vigor
such acts so long as the conspiracies and combina
tions therein named disturb the peace of the
couutry. It Is much to be regretted, aud Is regret
ted by no one more than myself, that a necessity
has existed to oxecute the Enforcement act. No
one can desire more than 1 that the necessity oi ap
plying It may never again be demauded.
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.
The Secretary of tne Interior reports satisfactory
improvement aud progress in each of the several
bureaus under the control oi the Interior Depart
ment. They are all In excellent coudltlon. Ibe
work which In some or them for some years has
been in arrears has been brought down to a recent
date, and in aU the current business has been
promptly despatched. The policy which was
adopted at the beginning of this aaminlstratlou
with regard to the management oi the Indians has
been as suoceasful as Its most ardent friends antici
pated within so short a time. It has reduced
the expense of their management, decreased
ttielr forages tfpon the white settlements, tended
to give the largest opportunity to the ex
tension of the great railways through the public
domain and the pushing of settlements Into more
remote districts of the country, and at tne same
time improved the condition oi the Indians. Itie
policy will be maintained without any change, ex
cept such as lurther experience may show to be
necessary to render It more eitlclent. ihe subject
of converting the so-called Indian lerritory south
of Kansas Into a home for the Indian and erecting
therein a territorial form of government Is one oi
irreat importance as a complement of the existing
Indian policy. The question of removal to the
territory has, within the past year, been presented
to many or the tribes resident upon otljerand
less desirable portions of the public donrtiln,
and has generally been received by them with
favor, as aprellmlnary step to the organization ot
such a territory. It will be necessary to confine
the Indians now resident thereon to farms of
proper size, which should be secured to them in fee,
the residue to be used for the settlement of other
friendly Indians. Efforts will be made in the imme
diate future to induce the removal oi as many
peaceably disposed Indians only to the Indian
Territory as can be settled Pr?per y without dl?
turbtug the harmony or those already there. There
Is no other location now available where a people
who are endeavoring to acquire a knowledge or
pastoral and agricultural pursuits can be so well
accommodated as upon the unoccupied lauds in
the Indian Territory.
A territorial government should, however, pro
tect the Indians from the Inroads ol whites lor a
term or years, uutll they become sufficiently ad
vanced in the arts and civilization to guard their
own rights, and irom the disposal of lands held by
them for the same period. During the last nscal
year there were disposed of out or the public lands
11,884,975 acres?a quantity greater by 1,099,2.0
acres than was disposed of the provlous year. Ol
this amount 1,370,320 acres were sold lor cash,
389,400 acres located with military
4 671,332 acres taken for homesteads, 693,613 acres
located with college scrip, 3,654,889 acres granted
to railroads, 465,347 acres granted to wagon
roads, 714,255 acres given to States as swamp
land, 5,700 acres located by Indian scrip,
cash receipts from all sources in the Laud Offlce
amounted to $3,218,100; during the same period
22,016,008 acres ot the public lands were surveyed,
which, added to the quantity before surveyed,
amount to 583,304,780 acres, leaving 1,267,633,028
acres of the public lands still unsurveyed. The re
ports irom the subordinates of the Land Ofllce con
tain interesting information in regard to their
respective districts. They uniformly mention the
frultfulQGSS of the soli during the past season and
tile increased yield ol' all kinds of produce. Even
in those States aud Territories where mining Is the
principal business agricultural produats nave ex
ceeilcd the local demand, and liberal shipments
have been made to distant points.
PATENTS DURING THE YEAR
ending September so, 1872?There were issued nrom
the l'atout Ofllce 13,?20 patents, 233 extensions
and 656 certificates and registers of trademarks;
during the same time 19,687 applications lor
patents, including reissues apd tfesfgn?, &%Ye
received and5,l<W 6aTeats filed; till fefeai received
during the same period amounted to $7o,09j,48?,
and the total expenditures to $62,865,890, making
the net receipts over the expenditures $7,740,0J6;
since 1836 200,000 applications (or patents have
been filed and about 133,000 patents issued. Ihe
ofllce Is being conducted under the same laws ana
general organization as were adopted at the origi
nal inauguration, when only from too to 500 applica
tions were made per annum. The Co??,88f?111?J:
shows that the ofllce has outgrown the original plan
and that a new organization has become necessary.
This subject was presented to Congress In a I?P?C'?}
communication In February last, with my WPIJX1
and tlfe approval of the Secretary of the)Interior,
and the suggestions contained In said communica
tion were embraced in the bill that wm1 r*P?r"''J
to the House by the Committee on Patents at the
last session. The subject of the reorganization ol
the Patent Offlce as contemplated. by the Mil re
ferred to is one of such importance to the Industrial
interests of the country that I
attention of Congress. Ihe V, th? n?
treats the subject of the separationofthe Patent
Offlce from the Department of the Interior.
This subject is also embraced In the bill hereto
fore reierred to. The Commlssfoner complalns of
the want of room for the model gallery, and for the
working force and necessary files or the office. It
Is Impossible to transact the business ?**he offlce
properly without more room in which to arrange
filesand drawings that must be consulted hourly
In the transaction of business. The wholo of the
Patent Offlce building will soon be needed, If it is ,
not already, for the accommodation or tht business ,
or the Patent offlce.
PENSIONS.
The amount paid for pensions in tho last fiscal
year was $30,169,340, an amount larger by $3,708,434
than was paid during tho preceding year. Of this
amount $2 313,409 was paid under the act of ton
gress of February 17, 1871, to survivors of the
war or 1812. The annual Increase of pensions
bv the legislation or Congress has more than kept
pace with the natural yearly losses from the roils.
The act or Congress of June 8, 1872, has added an
estimated amount ol $750,000 per annum to the
rolls, without increasing the number of pensioners
We cannot, therefore, look for any substantial de
crease in the expenditures of tnls department for
some time to come, or so long as congress con
tinues to so change the rates ot pension. TM

The total number of claims ou hand at the begin

during the year was 26,574. The number disposed
or was 39,178, milking a net gaiu of U.0J4. Thd
number or claims now on flle Is 79,085.
On the 301U of June, 1872, there were on the roll*

113 518 widows, orphans and dependent relatives,
making an aggregate of 208,9-23 array pensioners;
at the same time there wore on the rolls the names

1872. Of these there were allowed during the Uutf

It is estimated that $30,480,000 will bo required foi

THE CENSUS.
The ninth census is about completed. Itscarif
completion is a subject of congratulation, lnasmucn
as the use to be made of the statistics therein con
tained depends very greatly on the promptitude oi
publication. The Secretary of the Interior recom
mends that a census be taiten In 1875, whlcn
recommendation should receive the early at
tention of Congress. The Interval at present
established between the federal census is M
long that the information obtained at the decen
nial periods as to the material condition. wants
and resources of the nation is of little practical
value after tbe expiration of the first ball oi that
period. It would, probably, obviate the constituj
tlonai provision regarding the deoenulal census, u
a census takon in 1875 should be divested of all
political character and no reapportionment of con
gressional representation bo made under It. oucn a
census, coming as It would in the last year of tne
first century ot our national existence, would alBO
lurnlsh a noble monument of the progress of the
United States during that century
EDUCATION.
The rapidly increasing interest in education is ?
most encouraging feature in the current history ol
th ? country; and it Is no doubt true that this Is duo
iu a great measure to the efforts of the Bureau
of Education. That office is continually receiv
ing evidences, which abundantly prove Its effl
ciency, from the various institutions ^'earning ao?
education throughout the country. Iho report
of tbe Commlssiouer contains a \a3trr"?"i,f1u^?^r

but one of them?Utah?is the condition of airairs
unsatisfactory, except so far as the quiot oi , tne
citizen may be disturbed by real or lmagiuary
danger or Indian hostilities. " has seemed to be
the policy of the Legislature of l>tuh to evade ai}
responsibility to the Roverument or the United
States, and even to hold a position in hostUitjr to
it. 1 recommend a careful revision of the present
laws of the Territory by Congress and tlio enact
ment of such a law as the one proposed In
Conjrreas at its lust session (91* instance, or
something similar to it, us will secure l'cace,
the equality oi' all citizens before the law aud the

establishment of a territorial government or the
District ol Columbia the improvement ol the con
dition ol the city of Washington *nd surroundings

servable to the most casual visitor. The uauon,

bear with the citizens of the District a just share
oi the expense of these Improvements. I 'Ccom
mend, thereiore, an appropriation to reimburse the

CIVIL SERVICE. ^
An earnest desire has been relt to correct abuses
which fcave grown up in the civil service or the
country through the defective method ol making
appoint mo n Is to olllce. Heretolore federal ollloes
have been regarded too much as the reward ol po
litical services. Under authority ol Congress rules
have been established to regulate the tenure ol
olllce aud the mode of appolutmcnts. It cannot
ba expected that any system of rules can be en
tirely effective and prove a periect remedy for the
existing evils until they have been thoroughly
tested by actual practice ami amended according
to the requirements of the service. , .
During my term of olllce it shall bo my b.st en
deavor to so apply the rules as to securo the great
est possible relorm In the civil service of the gov
ernment, but it will require the dtrect actlon ot
congress to render the enforcement of the system
binding upon my successors, and I hope that the
experience of the past year, together with appro
priate legislation by Congress, may reach a satis
factory solution or this question and secure^ to the
public service lor all time a practical method of
obtaining faithful aud elllcient oinc^s aml em
UlOves. U. a. UBAJi.

THE INSUBANCE COMPANIES.
Investigations by the State Depart*
incut? An Earnest Effort to Slake Up
Impairments.
Mr. Eldridge, of the State Department of Irorar
nnce, for several days lias been engaged in the
examination of ttie companies badly effected by
ttio Boston Are. lie reports the results of the in
quiry as not at all calculated tocausc alarm for the
solvency of the companies. The companion ex
amlned are the Market, the International, the
Humboldt, Washington, Niagara, llanover,
| Standard, Republic, Firomen's, Lorlllard,
licuox, National, Commerce, Corn Ex
change, Hope and New York and Yonkers.
The Market has reinsured its risks, and
after closing business will be able to return about
ninety-five per cent to the stockholders. The
amount that the three other suspended companies
will return to stockholders cannot as yet be esti
mated. The friends of Mr. Savage, or tne Interna
ttonal, have resolved to aid him in forming a new
company, and the work of formation is now pro
gressing. The Niagara has reduced its capital
from $1,000,000 to $5ou,<xx), and the Hanover (root
$400,000 to $260,000, with the view of making it up
; at some future time to tho original
figures. Mr. Eldrulge reports that ha has
. conferred with the stockholders and directors of
| the other companies named above, and they have
expressed a determination to made good their int
! psfrments beiore the end of the year. They ro
quested, however, that the amount ol their impair*
1 ments should not be made public before tUoy make
j their annual reports at the end ol the month, aa
they hope In these reports to show the impair
ments made up. The examinations of the above
companies were, with two exceptions, made at the
request of the directors. The reporter could not
learn rrom Mr. Eldridge that any of them have as
yet made up the entire Impairment, al
though that of the Star is nearly completed.
The officers of the Hoffman and Continental havo
requested an eariy examination, with a view of at
once making up such Impairment as tho Insur
ance Department may require of them. TUey will
bo examined this week. The new Superintendent
oj Insurance, ex-Senator Chapman, qualified oo
Saturday, and placed one or bis deputtea tempo
rarily in charge of the offloe at Albaoy. Mr.
Eld ridge Is pleased with tho spirit tUat auimateft
the officers of the companies, aud believes that all
examined will show a nigh state ol solveucjr ia li*.
