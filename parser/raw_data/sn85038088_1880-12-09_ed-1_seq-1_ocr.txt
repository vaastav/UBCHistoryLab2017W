her feet did not reach the floor of the

and restless. Observing this, Mr. Dag
gett told the mother that the child would
be much more comfortable if she bad
some support for her feet and at the
same time informed her that under the
seat waa a valise that she could draw out
which would be just the thing. The lady
reached under the seat and began tag

from a doze and said: " Why, my dear

Rrpmmlnlmr: I congratulate yon on the
continued and increaung prosperity of oar
country. By the favor of Divine Providence
ws have been blessed, during the paxt year
with health, with abundant harveats, with
profitable employment for all our people, and
with contentment at boiue, and with peace and
friendship wrth other nations. '
The ooenrrence of the twenty-fourth election
of Chief Magistrate has afforded another op
portunity to the people of the United States to
exhibit to the world s significant example of the
peaceful and safe transmission of the power and
authority of government from the public serv
ants whose terms of office are abont to expire,
to their newly chosen successors. This exam
ple can not fail to impress profoundly thought
ful people of other countries with the advan
tages which Republican institutions afford.
The immediate, general and cheerful acquies
cence of all good citizens in the result of the
election, gives gratifying assurance to our coun
try, and to friends, throughout the world, that
s Government based on the free consent of an
intelligent and patriotic peoplo, possesses ele
ments of strength, stability, and permanency
net found in any other form of government
THB SLCCTTVE rBAVCBISS.. - .
Continued opposition to the full snd free en
joyment of the rights of citizenship, conferred
upon the colored people, by the recent amend
ments to the Constitution, still prevails in sev
eral of the late slaveholding States. It has, per
haps, not been manifested in the reoent election
to any Urge extent in acts of violence or intim
idation. It has, however, by fraudulent prac
tices in connection with the ballots, with the
regulations as to the places and manner of vot
ing, and with counting, returning, and canvass
ing the vote cast been successful in defeating
the exercise ot the right preservative of all
rights, the right of suffrage, which the Consti
tution expressly confers upon our enfranchised
citizens. - - - - .
It is the dosire of the good people of the
whole country that sectionalism as a factor in
our politics should disappear. They prefer that
no section of the country should be united in
sqjid. pppaaition to any other section. The dis
josition torafnse a prompt and. hearty obedi
sbms) tw ills .mil-rifcJUsmendnjents to the
Constitution, is all that now stands in the way
of a complete obliteration of sectional lines in
our political, contest. As long as either of
these amendments is flagrantly violated or dis
rgarded, it is safe to assume - that the people
ftrho placed themi in the Constitution, as
embodying theV legitimate results of the
war for the Union, and who believe them
to be wise snd necessary, will continno to set
together, snd to insist that they shall be
obeyed. The paramount question still is, as
to the enjoyment of the right by every Ameri
can citizen who has the requisite qualifications,
to freely cast his vote and hare it huncstly
counted. With this question rightly settled,
the country will be relieved of the contentions
of the past; bygones will indoed be bygones;
and political and party issues with respect te
economy snd efficiency of administration, in
ternal improvements, the tariff, domestic tax
ation, ednaction, finance and other important
subjects, will then reoeire their full share of
attention; but resistance to, snd' nullifica
tion of, the results of the war will unite
together in 'resolute purpose for their
support -all who maintain the authority
ft the Government snd the perpetuity
i of tb Onion, snd who adequately appreciate
the value of the victory achieved. This de
termination proceeds from no hostile senti
ment or feeling to sny part of the people of
our country, or to sny of their interests. The
inviolability of the amendments rests upon the
fundamental principle of our Government
They are the snjema expression ot the will ot
the people of the United States. 'J ;: ;
m nrnnrm uimmi
The sentiment that the constitutional rights
of all eursitisens must be maintained, does not
grow weaker. It will continue to control the
Government of the country. Happily, the his
tory of the late election shows that many parts
of the country where opposition to the Fifteenth
Amendment has hitherto prevailed, it is dimin
ishing, and is likely to cease altogether, if firm
and well-considered action is taken by Con
gress. I trust the House of Representatives
and the Senate, which have a right to judge
of the elections, returns and qualifications
of their own members, will see to it that every
ease of violation of the letter or spirit of the
Fifteenth Amendment is thoroughly investi
gated, and thai no benefit from such violation
shall accrue to any person or party. It will
be the dirty of the Executive, with sufficient
appropriations for th purpose, to prosecute
unsparingly all who have been engaged in de
priving citizens of the rights guaranteed to
mem Dy ins consutuuon.
A roPCLAB IDCCATIOK XriDID.
It is not however, to be fortten that the
best and surest guarantee of the primary rights
of citizenship is to be fonnd in that capacity for
self-protection which can belong only to a peo
pls whose right to universal suffrage is sup
ported by universal education. The means at
the command of the local and State authorities
sre, in many cases, wholly inadequate to fur
nish free instruction to all who need it This
is especially true where, before emancipation,
the education of the people was neglected or
prevented, in the interest of slavery. Firmly
convinced . that the subject of popular educa
tion dew, the eanmii sttentWs? the peo
ple of the-whole seontry, -wit a "htm te wis
and comprehensive action by the Government
of the United States, I respectfully recommend
that Congress, by suitable legislation and with
proper safeguards, supplement the local educa
tional funds in the several States where the
grave duties and responsibilities of citizenship
have been devolved on uneducated people, by
devoting to the purpose grants of public lands,
and, if necessarv, by appropriations from the
Treasury of the United States. Whatever Gov
ernment San fairly d to promote free popular
ednrationo'srht to be doue. Wherever general
ducatitsa is found pease, virtue, and social
order prevail, and civil and religious liberty are
secure.
THE dVII. SERVICE.
In my former annual messenges, I have asked
tlie attention of Congress to the urgent neces
sity of a reformation of the civil service system
of the Government My views concerning the
dangers of patronage, or appointments for
personal or partisan considerations, have boon
s(iTiUMiacd by my observation and experience
aa the Kxecutive office, snd I believe these
dangers threaten the stability of the Govern
ment Abuses an serious in their nature can
not be permanently tolerated. They tend to
become more alarming with the enlargement of
administrative service, as the growth of the
eonntry in papulation increases the number of
officers snd placemen employed.
The reasons sre imperative for the adoption
of fixed rules for the regulation of appoint
ments, promotions snd removals, establishing
a uniform method, having exclusively in view,
in every instanoe, the attainment of the best
S oalifl cations for the position in question,
uan a method alone is eonsistent with the
equal rights of all dozens, and the most
economical snd efficient administration of the
public basin ass.
- '- ooaraiiiua tDUCAnoir.
Competitive examinations, in aid of impar
tial appointments and promotions, have been
conducted for some years past in several of the
j this system has been adopted in the custom-
nouses and postomces of the larger cities of
the country. In the City of New York over
two thousand positions in the civil service have
been subject in their appointments and tenure
of place, to the operation of published rules
forUhis parpose, during the past two yean.
The results at theae practical trials have been
very satisfactory, and have confirmed my opin
ion in favor of Una system of selection. All
are subjected to the same tests, snd the result
is free from prejudice by personal favor or par
tisan influence. It secures for the position ap
plied for, the best qualifications attainable
among the competing applicants. It is sn ef
fectual protection from the pressure of impor
tunity which, under any other course pursued,
largely exacts the time and attention of ap
pointing officers, to their great detriment in the
discharge of other official duties, preventing
the abuse of the service for the mere further
ance est private or party purposes, snd leaving
the employ of the Government freed from the
obligations imposed by patronage, to depend
solely upon merit for retention snd advance
ment, and with this constant incentive, exertion
snd improvement ,
These invaluable results have been, attained
in a high degree in the offices where the rules '
for appointment by competitive examination
have been applied.
A method which has so approved itself by
experimental tests at points whore such teats
may be fairly considered conclusive, should be
extended to all subordinate positions under the
Government I believe that a strong an
growing pnblic sentiment demands immediate
measures for securing and enforcing the high
est possible efficiency in the Civil Service, and
Its protection from reoogruzed abuses, and that
the ex pen race - referred to has demonstrated
the feasibility of such measures. ' -
The examinations in the Custom-Houses and
Foitoffices hsve been held under many embar
rassments and without provision for compensa
tion for the extra labor performed by the offi
cers who have conducted them, and whose com
menable interest in the improvement of the
public service has induced this devotion of time
snd labor without pecuniary reward. A con
tinuance of these labors gratuitously ought not
to be expected, and without an appropriation
by Congress for compensation, it is not practic
ble to extend the system of competitive ex
aminations generally throughout the Civil Ser
vice. It is also highly important that all such
examinations should be conducted upon
a uniform system, and under genera
supervision. Section 1,753 of the Revised
Statutes authorizes the President to prescribe
the regulations for admission to the Civil Ser
vice of the United States, and for this purpose
to employ suitable perrons to conduct the re
quisite uiquiries with reference to "the fitness
of each candidate, in respect to age, health,
character, knowledge, and ability, for the
branch of service into which he seeks to enter;"
but the law is practically inoperative for want
of the requisite appropriation,
-1 therefore recommend an appropriation of
25,000 per annum to meet the expenses of a
commission, to be appointed by the President
in accordance with the terms of this section,
whose duty it shall be todevise a just uniform,
and efficient system of competitive examina
tions, and to supervise the application of the
same throughout the entire civil service of the
Government. I am persuaded that the facili
ties which such a commission will afford for
testing the fitness of those who apply for
office will not only be as welcome a relief to mem
bers of Congress as it will be to the President
and hesds of Departments, but that it will also
greatly tend to remove the causes of embarrass
ment which now inevitably and constantly at
tend the conflicting claims of patronage be
tween the legislative snd executive depart
ments. THE "SPOILS SYSTEM."
The most serious obstacle, however, to an im
provement S)t -the civil service, and especially to
s reform in the method of annointmcnt and re-
' mrjvnf, has been found to be the practice, undei
wnai is anown as ine "spoils system, oy wmcn
the appointing power has been so largely en
croached upon by members of Congress. The
first step in the reform of the civil Bcrvice must
be a complete divorce between Congress and
the Executive in the matter of appointment.
The corrupting doctrine that "to the victors be
long the spoils" is inseparable from Congres
sional patronage as the established rule and
practice of parties in power. It ' comes
to be understood by applicants for office,
and by the people generally, that Representa
tives and Senators are entitled to disburse the
patronage of their respective .districts and
States. It ia-Tiot necessary to recite at length
the evils resulting from this invasion of the
Executive functions. The true principles of
government on the subject of appointments to
office, as stated in the National Conventions ot
the leading parties of the country, have again
and again been approved by the American peo
ple, and have not been called in question in any
quarter. These authentic expressions of pub
lic opinion spon this all-important subject, an
the statement of principles that belong to the
constitutional structure of the Government.
It is therefore recommended that an act be
passed defining the relations of members of
Congress with respect to appointment to office
by the President and I also recommend that
the provisions of Section 1,767, snd of the sec
tions following, of the Revised Statutes, com
prising the tenure-of -office act of March 2, 1867,
be repealed.
Believing that to reform the system snd
methods of the civil service in our country is
one of the highest and most imperative duties
of statesmanship, and that it can be perma
nently done only by the co-operation of the
legislative snd executive departments of the
Government I again commend the whole sub
ject to your considerate attention. - ,
POI.TGAMT. !': i
The Mormon sectarian organization which
upholds polygamy has the whole power of mak
ing and executing the local legislation of the
Territory. By its control of the grand and
petit juries, it possesses large influence over
the administration of justice. Exercising, aa
the heads of this sect do, the local political
power of the Territory, they are able to
.make effective their hostility to the law of Con
gress on the subject of polygamy, and, in fact
do prevent its enforcement Polygamy will not
be abolished if the enforcement of the law de
pends on those who practice snd uphold the
crime. It can only be suppressed oy taking
away the political power of the sect which en
courages and sustains it It controls now one
of our wealthiest and most populous Territo
ries. It is extending steadily into other Terri
tories. Wherever it goes it establish as polyg
amy and sectarian political power. Religious
liberty snd the separation of Church snd State
sre among the alementaiy ideas of free insti
tutions. To re-establish the interests snd prin
ciples which polygamy snd Mormonism hsve
imperiled, and to fully reopen to intelligent
and virtuous immigrants of all creeds that part
of our domain which has been, in a great de
gree, closed to general immigration by intoler
ant and immoral institutions, it is recom
mended that the' Government of the Territory
of Utah be reorganized.
I recommend that Congress provide for the
Government of Utah by a Governor and judges,
or commissioners, appointed by the President
snd confirmed by the Senate s government
analogous to the Provisional Government estab
lished for the Territory northwest of the Ohio,
by the ordinance of 1787.- If, bowsver, it is
deemed best to caiiuane the .existing form of
local government, I recommend that the right
to vote, hold office, and sit on juries in the
Territory of Utah, be confined to those who
neither practice nor uphold polygamy. If thor
ough measures are adopted, it is believed that
within a few years the evils which now afflict
Utah will be eradicated.
TOBTUNI BAT IKJUBIIS.

renewing the consideration of the subject, both
of the indemnity for the injuries at Fortune
Bay, and of the interpretation of the treaty in
which the previous correspondence had shown
the two Governments to be at variance. Upon
both these topics the disposition towards a
friendly agreement is manifested by s recogni
tion of our right to an indemnity for the
transaction st Fortune Bay, leaving the measure
Of such indemnity to further conference, and
by an assent the view of this Government,
presented in the previous correspondence, that
the regulation of conflicting interests of the
shore fishery of the Provincial sea coasts, snd
the vessel fishery of our fishermen, should be
made the subject of conference and concurrent
arrangement between the two Governments.

Our friendly relations with the German Em

by His Majesty the Emperor.
There is nothing of importance to note in our

THE SPANISH OUTRAGE.
During the la.it summer several" vessels be
longing to the raerehant marine of this country,
sailing in ueutral waters of the West Indies,
were tired at, boarded, and searched by an armed
cruiser of the Spanish Government The cir
emnstanceH, as reported, involve not only a
private injury to . the persons concerned, but
also seemed too little observant of the friendly
relations existing for a century between this
eonntry and Spain. The wrong was brought
to the attention of the Spanish Government in
a serious protest and remonstrance, and the
matter is undergoing investigation by the royal
authorities, with a view to such explanations or
reparations as may be called for by the facts.
THE FLORIDA TREATY.
The claims against the United States under
the Florida Treaty with Spain were submitted
to Congress for its action at the late session,
and I again invite your attention to this long
standing question, with a view to a final dis
position of the matter.
OUB CHINESE RELATIONS .
The provision made by Congress, at its last
session, for the expense of the commission
which had been appointed to enter upon
necotiations with the Imperial Government of
China, on subjects of great interest to the rela- ,
Hons of tne two countries, enarnea me com
missioners to proceed at once upon their mis
sion. The Imperial Government was pre pt red
to give prompt and respectful attention to the
matters brought under negotiation, and the
conferences proceeded with such rapidity and
success that, on the 17th of November last,
two treaties were signed at Fekin, one relating
to the introduction of Chinese into this country
and one relating to commerce. Mr. Trescot,
one of the Commissioners, is now on his way
home bringing the treaties, and it is expected
that they will be received in season to be laid
before the Senate early in January.
Our Minister in Japan has negotiated a con
vention for the reciprocal relief of shipwrecked
seamen. I take occasion to nrge once more
upon Congress the propriety of making pro
vision for the erection of suitable fire-proof
buildings at the Japanese Capital for the use of
the American Legation, and the Court-house
and Jail connected with it The Japanese
Government with great generosity and
courtesy, has offered for this purpose-an eligi
ble piece of land.
In my last annual message I invited the at
tention of Congress to the subject of the in
demnity funds received some years ago from
China and Japan. I renew the recommenda
tion then made that whatever portion of these
funds are due to American citizens should be
promptly puid, and the residue returned to the
nations, respectively, to which they justly and
equitably belong.
REAFFIRMING THE "MONROE DOCTRINE" RB
SrECTINQ THE PANAMA CANAL SCHEME.
The relations between this Government and
that of the United States of Colombia have en
gaged, public atteution during the past year,
niaiuly by reason of the project of an iiiter
oceanii! canal across the Isthmus of Panama, to
be built by private capital under a concession
from the Colombian Government for that pur
pose. The treaty obligations subsisting between
the United States and Colombia, by which we
guarantee the neutrality of the transit and the
sovereignty and property of Colombia in the
Isthmus, make it necessary that the conditions
under which so stupendous a change in the
region embraced in this guarantee should he
effected transforming, as it would, this Isth
mus, from a barrier between the Atlantic and
Pacific 'Oceans, into a gateway and thorough
fare between them, for the navies and the mer
chant fillips of the world should receive the
approval of this Government, as being com
patible with the discharge of these obligations
on our part, and consistent with onr interests
as the principal commercial power of the West
ern Hemisphere. The views which I expressed
in a special message to Congress in March last
iu relation to this project, I deem it my duty
again to press upon your attention. Subse
quent consideration has but confirmed the opin
ion "that it is the right and duty of the United
States to assert and maintain such provision
and authority over any inter-oceanic canal
across the Isthmus that connects North and
South America as will protect our national in-

The war between the Republic of Chili on the

rights of the parties ss independent States.
We have, however, always held ourselves in
readiness to aid in accommodating their differ

both belligerents of our willingness to render
such services.

IKTERNATIOKAL 8ANITART MEASURES.
In pursuance of the act passed at the last
session of Congress, invitations have been ex
tended to foreign maritime States to join in a
sanitary conference in Washington, beginning
the 1st of January. The acceptance of this in
vitation by many prominent Towers gives prom
ise of success in this important measure, de
signed to establish a system of international
notification by which the spread of infection
or epidemic diseases may be more effectively
checked er prevented. The attention of Con
gress is invited to the necessary appropriations
for carrying into effect the provisions of the
set referred to.
OCR POSTAL-COMMEBCE FACILITIES.
The prosperous energies of our domestic in
dustries, and their immense production of the
subjects of foreign commerce, invite, and even
require, sn active development of the wishes
and interests of onr people 'in that direction.
Especially important is it that our commercial
relations with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of
South America, with the West Indies, and the
Gulf of Mexico should be direct and not
through the circuit of European systems, and
should be carried on in onr own bottoms. The
full appreciation of the opportunities which
our front on the Pacific Ocean gives to com
merce with Japan, China, snd the East Indies,
with Australia and the Island groups which lie
along these routes of navigation, should in
spire equal efforts to appropriate to our own
snipping, snd to administer by our own capital,
a due proportion of this trade. Whatever mod
ifications of our regulations of trade and navi
gation may be necessary or useful to meet
and direct these impulses to the enlargement of
our exchanges and of our carrying trade, I am
sure the wisdom of Congress will be ready to
supply. One initial measure, however, seems to
me so clearly useful and efficient that I venture
to press it upon your earnest attention.
It teems to be very evident that the
provision of regular steam-postal communica
tion, by aid from Government has been the
forerunner of the commercial predominance of
Great Britain on all these coasts and seas, a
greater share in whose trade is now the desire
and the intent of our people. It is also mani
fest that the efforts of other European nations
to contend with Great Britain for a share of
this commerce, hsve been successful in propor
tion with their adoption of regular steam
postal communication with the markets whose
trade they sought Mexico snd the States of
South America are anxious to receive such
postal communications with this country, and
to aid in their development Similar co-operation
may be looked for, in due time, from the
Eastern nations and from Australia. It is diffi
cult to see how the lead in this movement can
be expected from private interests. In respect
of foreign postal commerce, quite as much aa
in internal trade, communication seems neces
sarily a matter of common and public adminis
tration, and thus pertaining to government. I
respectfully recommend to your prompt atten
tion such Jnsf and efficient measures as may
conduce to the development of onr foreign com
mercial exchanges snd the building up of our
carrying trade.
FINANCIAL.
The condition of the financial affairs of the
Government ss shown by the report of the
Secretary of the Treasury, is very satisfactory.
It is believed that the present financial situation
of the United States, whether sonsidered with
respect to trade, currency, credit, growing
wealth, or the extent and variety of our re
sources, is more Xsvcrablf thanthsj.9j any
other eonntry of our time, and has never been
surpassed by that of any country st sny period
of its history. All our industries are thriving;
the rate of interest is low; new railroads are be
ing constructed; a vast immigration is increas
ing our population, capital and labor; new en
terprises in great number sre in progress; and
onr commercial relations with other countries
are improving.
The ordinary revenues, from all aonrees, for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, were:

73,968,087 41
The aggregate revenue receipts thus for, of
the current year, together with the estimated
receipts for the remainder of the year, amount
to $350,000,000, which will be sufficient to meet
the estimated expenditures of the year, and
leave a surplus of 990,000,000.
It is fortunate that this large surplus revenue
occurs at a period when it may be directly ap-
Elied to the payment of the public debt soon to
e redeemable.
The debt of the United States, less cash in
the Treasury and exclusive of accruing interest
attained its maximum of $2,756,431,571.43 in
August 1865, and has since that time been re
duced to 91,8X6,019,504.65. Of the principal
of the debt, $108,758,100 has been paid since
March 1st 1877, effecting an annual saving of
interest of 96,107,593.
Within a short period over six hundred mil
lions of five and six per cent bonds will be
come redeemable. This presents a very favor
able opportunity not only to further reduce the
principal of the debt but also to reduce the
rate of interest on that which will remain un
paid. LEGAL-TENDER NOTES.
There are still in existence, uncanceled, 9346,
681,016 of United States legal-tender notes.
These notes were authorized as a war measure,
made necessary by the exigencies of the con
flict in which the United States was then en
gaged. The preservation of the nation's exis
tence required, in the judgment of Congress, an
is .ue of legal-tender paper money. That it
served well tho purpose for which it was cre
ated is not questioned, but the employment of
the notes as paper money indefinitely, after the
accomplishment of the object for which they
were provided, was not contemplated by the
fraraers of the law under which they were is
sued. These notes, long since became like any
other pecuniary- obligation of the Government
-i-a debt to be paid, and, when paid, to be can
celed ss mere evidence of an indebtedness no
longer existing. I, therefore, repeat what was
said in the annual message of last year, that
the retirement from circulation of United States
notes, with the capacity of legal tender in pri
vate contracts, is s step to be taken in oar pro
gress toward a safe and stable currency, which
should be accepted as the policy and duty of
the Government and the interest and security
of the people.
THE STLVEB DOLLAR.
At the time of the passage of the act now in
force requiring the coinage of silver dollars,
fixing their value and giving them legal-tender
character, it was believed by many of the
supporters of the measure that the silver dol
lar, which it authorized, would speedily be
come, under the operations of the law, of
equivalent value to the gold dollar. There
were other supporters of the bill, who, while
they doubted as to ths probability of this re
sult, nevertheless were willing to give the pro
posed experiment a fair trial, with a view to
stop the coinage, if experience should prove
that the silver dollar authorized by the bill con
tinued to be of less commercial value than the
standard gold dollar.
The coinage of silver dollars, under the act
referred to; began in March, 1878, and has
been continued as required by the act The
average rate per month to the present time has
been 92,276,492. The total amount coined
prior to the first of November last was 972,
847,750. Of this amount 947,084,450 remain in
the Treasury, and only 925,763,291 are in the
hands of the people. A constant effort has
been made to keep this currency in circulation,
and considerable expense hss been necessarily
incurred for this purpose, but its return to the
Treasury is prompt and sure. Contrary to the
confident anticipation of the friends of the
measure at the tune of its adoption, the value
of the silver dollar, containing 4123 grains of
silver, has not increased. During the year
prior to the passage of the bill authorizing its
coinage, the market value of the silver which
it contained was from ninety to ninety-two
cents, ss compared with the standard gold dol
lar. During the last year the average market
value of the silver dollar has been eighty-eight
and a half cents.
It is obvious that the legislation of the last
Congress in regard to silver, so far as it was
based on sn anticipated rise in the value of
silver as a result of that legislation, has failed
to produce ths effect then predicted. The
longer the law remains in force, requiring ss it
does, the coinage of a nominal dollar, which,
in reality, is not a dollar, the greater becomes
the danger that this country will be forced to
accept a single metal as the sole legal standard
of value, in circulation, snd this a standard of
less value than it purports to be worth in the
recognized money of the world.
The Constitution of the United States, sound
financial principles, snd our best interests, all
require that the country should have as its legal
tender money, both gold and silver coin, of sn
intrinsic value, ss ullion, equivalent to that
which, upon its face, it purports to possess.
The Constitution, in express terms, recognizes
both gold snd silver as the only true legal
tender money. To banish either of these met
als from our currency i to narrow and limit
the circulating medium of exchange to the dis
paragement of important interests. The
United States produces more silver than sny
other country, and is directly interested in
maintaining it as one of the two precious met
als which furnish the coinage of the world. It
will, in my judgment contribute to this result
if Congress will repeal so much of existing leg
islation aa requires the coinage of silver dollars
containing only 412)i grains of silver, and in
its stead will authorize the Secretary of the
Treasury to coin silver dollars of equivalent
value as bullion, with gold dollars. This will
defraud no man, and will be in scoordauce with
familiar precedents. Congress, on several oc
casions, has altered the ratio of value between
gold and silver, in order to establish it more
nearly in accordance with the actual ratio of
value between the two metals.
MILITARY POSTS.
The rapid extension of the railroad system
west of the Mississippi River, and the great
tide of settlers which hss flowed in upon new
territory, impose on the military an entire
change ot policy. The maintenance of small
posts along wagon and stage rentes of travel is
no longer necessary. Permanent quarters at
points selected, of a mors substantial character
1880.
1 than those heretofore constructed, will be re-
qturea. (. uaer existing laws, permanent nuild
ings can not be erected without the sanction of
Congress, and when sales of military sites and
buildings have been authorized, the monevs re
ceived have reverted to the Tressnrv, and
could only become available through " a new
appropriation. It is recommended that provi
sion be made, by a general statute, for the sale
of anch abandoned military posts and buildings
ss are found to be unnecessary, and for the ap
plication of the proceeds to the construc
tion of other post8- While many of the pres
ent posts sre of bnt slight value for military
purposes, owing to the ohsnged condition of
the country, their occupation is continued at
great expense and inconvenience, because they
afford the only available shelter for troops. -
- ABMT EDUCATION AX, FACILIT1SS.
The report of the officer in charge of educa
tion in the army shows that there are seventy
eight schools now in operation in the army,
with an aggregate attendance of 2,305 enlisted
men and children. The Secretary recommends
the enlistment of one hundred Slid fifty school
masters, with the rank and pay of commissary
sergeants. An appropriation is needed to sup
ply tho judge advocates of the army with suita
able libraries, and the Secretary recommends
that the corps of judge advocates be placed
upon the same footing, aa to promotion, with
the other staff corps of the army. Under ex
isting laws, the Bureau of Military Justice con
sists of one officer, the Judge Advocate Gen
eral, and the corps of judge advocates, of eight
officers of equal rank (majors) with a provision
that the limit of the corps shall remain at four,
when reduced by casualty or resignation to that
number. The consolidation of the Bureau of
Military Justice and the corps of judge advo
cates, upon the same basis with the other staff
corps of the army, would remove an unjust dis
crimination against deserving officers, and sub-'
serve the best interests of the service.- -i .
COAST FORTIFICATIONS.
Especial attention is asked to the report ot
tho Chief of Engineers upon the condition of
our National defences. From a personal in
spection of many of the fortifications referred
to, the Secretary is able to emphasize the rec
ommendations made, and to state that their in
somplete and defenceless condition is discredit
able to the country. While other nations have
been increasing in their means for carrying on
offensive warfare snd attacking maritime cities,
we have been dormant in preparation for de
fense; not hing of importance has been doue to
wards strengthening snd finishing onr cssemat
ed works since our late civil war, during which
the great guns of modern warfare and tho
heavy armor of modern fortifications snd ships
came into use among the nations, snd our
earthworks left by a sudden failure of appro
priations some years since, in all stages of in
completion, are now being rapidly destroyed by
the elements.
NAVIGATION.
A comprehensive improvement of the Missis
sippi snd its tributaries is a matter of trane
cendant importance. Geographically, commer
cially, and politically, they are the strongest tie
between the various sections of the country.
These channels of communication and inter
change are the property of the Nation. Its ju
risdiction is paramount over their waters, and
the plainest principles of pnblic interest require
their intelligent and careful supervision, with
a view to their protection, improvement, and
the enhancement of their usefulness.
The channel of the Columbia River, for a dis
tance of abont one hundred miles from its
mouth, is obstructed by a succession of bars,
which occasion serious delays in navigation,
and heavy expense for lighterage and towage.
A depth of at least twenty feet st low tide
should be secured and maintained, to meet the
requirements of the extensive and growing in
land and ocean commerce it Bubscrves.
From Columbia River to San Francisco, a
distance of over six hundred miles, there is no
harbor on our Pacific coast which can be ap
proached during stormy wea'ther. An appro
priation of 9150,000 was made by the Forty
fifth Congress for tho commencement of a
breakwater and harbor of refuge, to be located
st some point between ths Straits of Fuca and
San Francisco, at which the necessities of com
merce, local and general, will be best accommo
dated. The amount appropriated is thought to
be quite inadequate for the purpose intended.
I commend the matter to the attention of Con
gress. THE ARMY MEDXCAL MUSEUM.
: The collections of books, specimens, and rec
ords, constituting the Army Medical Museum
and Library are of national importance. The
Library now contains about 51,500 volumes snd
57,000 pamphlets relating to medicine, surgery
and allied topics. The contents of ths Army
Medical Museum consists of 22,000 specimens,
sod sre nniqne in the completeness with which
both military surgery and the diseases of armies
are illustrated. Their destruction would be sn
irreparable loss, not only to the United States,
but te the world. These valuable collections
sre now in a building which is peculiarly ex
viajul fat th Hancrer of oMtrnetinn hv flra.- Tt
is therefore earnestly recommended that an ap
propriation be made for a new fire-proof build
ing adequate for the present needs and reason-,
able future expansion of these valuable collec
tions. Such a building should be absolutely fire-
Sroof; no expenditure for mere architectural
isplay is required. It is believed that a suita
ble structure can be erected at a cost not to ex
ceed 9250,000.
A QUIET HINT.
I commend to the attention of Congress the
great services of the Commander-in-Chief of
our armies during the war for the Union,
whose wise, firm and patriotic conduct did so
much to bring that momentous conflict to a'
close. The legislation of the United States con
tains many precedents for the recognition of
distinguished military merit authorizing rank
snd emoluments to be conferred for eminent
services to the country. An 'act of Congress
authorizing the appointment of a Captain Gen
eral of the Army, with Buitable provisions re
lating to compensation, retirement and other
details, would, in my judgement be altogether
fitting snd proper, and would be warmly ap
proved by the country.
1T.1HV1,
The recommendation of the Secretary of the
Navy, that provision be made for the establish
ment of some form of civil government for the
people of Alaska, is approved. At present
there is no protection of persons or property in
that Territory, except such ss is afforded by
the officer of the United States ship Jamestown.
This vessel was dispatched to Sitka, because of
the fear that without the immediate presence
of the National authority, there was impending
danger of anarchy. The steps taken to restore
order have been accepted in good faith by both
white and Indian inhabitants, and the necessity
for this method of restraint does not in my
opinion now exist If, however, the James
town should be withdrawn, leaving the people,
as st present' without the ordinary judicial
snd administrative authority of organized
local government serious consequences might
ensue.
COALIHO STATIONS AT THE ISTHMUS.
The Secretary of the Navy has taken stops to
wards the establishment of naval coaling sta
tions at the Isthmus of Panama to meet the re-
2uirements of our commercial relations with
entral and South America, which sre rapidly
growing in importance. Locations eminently
suitable, both ss .regards our naval purpose
and the uses of commerce, have been selected,
one on the ess t side of the Isthmus, st Chiriqui
Lagoon, in the Caribbean Sea, and the other on
the Pacifio Coast at the Bay of Golfito.
IU FOSTAX, SEBVICS.
In 1850, the postal receipts were 98,518,
067.40; in 1880, tho receipts were 933,815, 479.34.
All the inhabitants of the country sre directly
snd personally interested in having proper
mail facilities, and naturally watch the Post
office very closely. This careful oversight on
the part of the peoplo has proved a constant
stimulus to improvement During the past
year there was an increase of 2,134 postoffices,
and the mail routes were extended 27,177 miles,
making sn additional annual transportation of
10,804,191 miles. The revenues of postal ser
vice for the ensuing year are estimated at 938,
845,174.10, and the expenditures at 942,475,
932, leaving a deflciencv to be appropriated out
of the Treasury of 93,630,757.90.
Ths Universal Postal Union has received the
accession of almost all the countries and col
onies of the world maintaining organised postal
services, snd it is confidently expected that all
ths other countries and colonies now outride
the Union will soon unite therewith, thus realis
ing the grand idea and aim of ths founders of
the Union, of forming, for purposes of interna
tional mail communication, a single postal ter
ritory embracing the world, with complete
uniformity of postal charges, and conditions of
international exchange, for all descriptions of
correspondence. To enable the United States
to do its full share of this great work, addi
tional legislation is asked by tho Postmaster
General, to whose recommendations especial
attention is called.
The suggestion of the Postmaster General
that it would be wise to encourage, by appro
priate legislation, the establishment of Amer
ican lines of steamers by onr own oitisens, to
carry the mails between our own ports and
those of Mexico, Central America, South
NUMBER 36.
America and of trans-Pacific countries, is com
mended to the serious consideration of Congress'
THE runiOIAJtT.
It is recommended that the number of
lodges of ths Circuit Court in each circuit
with the exception of the Second Circuit,
should bs increased by the addition of anotsxtr
judge; in ths Second Circuit that two should
be added; snd that an intermediate Appellate
Court should be formed in each circuit to con
sist of the Circuit Judge and ths Circuit Jus
tice, and that in ths event of the absence of
either of these judges the place of the absent
Judge should be supplied by the judge of one
of the District Courts in the circuit Such an
appellate court could be safely invested with
huge jurisdiction, snd its decisions would
satisfy suitors in many eases where appeals
would still be allowed to the Supreme Court
The expense incurred for this intermediate
court will require a very moderate increase of
the appropriations for the expenses of the De
partment of Justice. This recommendation is
commended to the careful consideration of
Congress.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
It gives me great pleasure to say that our In
dian affairs appear to be in a more hopeful con
dition, now than ever before. - The Indians
have made gratifying progress in agriculture,
herding and mechanical pursuits. Many who
were a few years ago in hostile conflict with the
Government are quietly settling down on farms
where they hope to mako their permanent
homes, building houses and engaging in the oc
cupations of civilized life. The introduction of
the freighting business among them hss been
remarkably fruitful of good results, in giving
many of them congenial and remunerative em
ployment and in stimulating their ambition to
earn their own support Their honesty, fidelity
and efficiency as carriers sre Highly praised.
The organization of a police force of Indians,
has been equally successful in maintaining law
and order upon the reservations, and in exercis
ing a wholesome moral influence among the In
dians themselves. I concur with the Secretary
of the Interior in the recommendation that the
pay of this force be increased, as an inducement
to the best class of young men to enter it
i Much care and attention hss been devoted to
the. enlargement of educational facilities for
the Indians. The means available for this im
portant object have been very inadequate. A
few additional boarding-schools at Indian agen
cies have been established, and the erection of
buildings has been begun for several more, but
sn increase of the appropriations for this in
teresting undertaking is greatly needed to ac
commodate the large number of Indian child
ren of school age, -The numbes of Indian pu
pils at the Normal School at Hampton, Virgin
ia, under the direction of General Armstrong,
has been considerably increased, and their pro
gress is highly encouraging. The Indian school
established by the Interior Department in 1879,
at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, under the direction
of Captain Pratt has been equally successful.
A similar school wss established this year at
Forest Grove, Oregon, for the education of In
cU in yonth on the Pacifio coast
The expenses of Indian education have so
far been drawn from the permanent civilization
fund at the disposal of the Department of the
Interior; but the fund is now so much reduced,
that the continuance of this bsnencisl work
will in the future depend on specific appropri
ations by Congress for the purpose, and I ven
ture to express the hope that Congress will not
permit institutions so fruitful of good results,
to perish for want of means for their support
The past year has been unusually free from
disturbances among the Indian tribes. An
agreement has been made with the Utes by
which they surrender their large reservation in
Colorado in consideration of sn annuity, to be
paid to them, and agree to settle in severalty
on certain lauds designated for that purpose, ss
formers, holding individual title to that land
m fee-simple, inalienable for a certain period.
In this way a costly Indian war ha been avoid
ed. The conluct of the Indians throughout
the country, during the past year, with but few
noteworthy exceptions, has been orderly and
peaceful.
THE PUBLIC LANDS.
A large increase is reported in the disposal
of public lands for settlement during the past
year, which marks the prosperous growth of
our agricultural industry, snd a vigorous
movement of population toward our unoccupied
lands. As this movement proceeds, the codifi
cation of our lsnd laws, as well as proper leg
islation to regulate the disposition of public
lands, become of more pressing necessity, snd
I therefore invite the consideration of Con
gress to the report made by the Public Lands
Commission, which were communicated by me
to Congress at the last session. - Early action
upon this important subject is highly desirable.
The attention of Congress is again asked to
the wasteful depredations committed on our
pnblic timber lauds, and the rapid and indis
criminate destruction of our forests. The
urgent necessity for legislation to this end s
now generally, recognized. In view of the law
less characters of the depredations committed,
snd the disastrous conseqnences which will in
evitably follow their continuance, . legislation
has agaiq and again been recommended to ar
rest the evil, and to preserve for the people of
Onr Western States and Territories the timber
needed for domestic and other essential uses.
MlNrNO INTERESTS.
The consolidation of the various geological
and geographical surveys and exploring enter
prises, each of which has heretofore operated
upon sn independent plan, without concert
can not fail to be of great benefit to all those
industries of the country which depend upon
the development of our mineral resources. The
labors of scientific men, of reeognizedmerit,who
compose the corps of the Geological Survey,
during the first season of their field operatiors
and inquiries, appear to have been comprehen
sive, and will soon be communicated to Con
gress in a number of volumes. The Director
of the Survey recommends that the investiga
tions carried on by his bureau, which, so far,
have been confined to the so-called pnblic land
States and Territories, be extendedover the en
tire country, and thai the necessary appropria
tion be msde for this purpose. This would be
particularly beneficial to the iron, coal snd
other mining interests of the Mississippi Valley
and of the Eastern and Southern States. The
subject is commended to the careful considera
tion of Congress.
BTOBB PUBLIC BUILDINGS WANTED.
The Secretary of the Interior asks attention
to the want of room in the public buildings of
the capital, now existing and in progress of
construction, for the accommodation of the
clerical force employed, snd of the public
records'. ' Necessity hss compelled the renting
of private buildings in different parts of the
city for the location of pubUo offices, for
which a large amount of rent is annually paid,
while the separation of offices belonging to the
same Department impedes the transaction of
current business. The Secretary suggests (hat
the blocks surrounding Lafayette Square on
the east north, and west be purchased as the
sites for new edifices, for the accommodation of
the Government offices, leaving the square it
self intact; and that if such buildings
were constructed upon a harmonious plan of
architecture, they would add much to the beau
ty of the national capita, and would, together
with the Treasury and the new Btate, Navy,
and War Department bmldtn form one of the
most imposing group of poblio edifices in the
world.
0OMMI58IONEB LZ DCC, HIS SUOAE AND EOS TEA.
' The Commissioner of Agriculture expresses
the confident belief that his efforts in behalf of
the production of our own sugar and tea have
been encouragingly rewarded. The importance
of the results attained have attracted marked
attention at home, and have received the spec
ial consideration ot foreign nations. The
successful cultivation of - our own tea, and the
manufacture of our own sugar, make a differ
ence of many millions of dollars annually in
the wealth of the Nation. 1
The report of the Commissioner asks at
tention particularly to the continued prevalence
of an infectious and contagious cattle disease,
known and dreaded in Europe and Asia as
cattle-plague, or pleuro-poetunonia. The value
of neat cattle exported from the United States
for the eight mouths ended August 81st 1880,
was mors than 912,000,000, and nearly double
the value for the same period in 1879.
THE rOTOMAO MARSHES.
' In my annual messages heretofore, I have
urged upon the attention of Congress the ne
cessity of reclaiming the marshes of the Po
tomac adjacent to the Capital, and I am con
strained by its importance to advert to the
subject These flats embrace an area of several
hundred seres. They are an impediment to
the drainage of the city, and seriously irapair
its health. It la believed that ith this sub
stantial improvement ot its river front the
Capital would be, in all respects, one ot the
most attractive cities in the world.
It should not be forgotten that the land
acquired will probably be worth th cost of re
elauniag it and that the navigation of the
river will be greatly improved. I therefore in
vite ths atteution of Congress to the import
ance of prompt provision for this much needed
and too long delayed improvement

ErEcuTm Mansiom, December 6. 1880.
: He Couldn't ITelp It. "
", Here is another case of a bxrjr who
couldn't help it A prominent and dig-
uifled citizen was loooking through the
third-story window of a block on Jeffer- .
sou avenue, which he had thoughts of
renting, when the idea suddenly struck
him to look into the alley in the rear. ' '
He raised the sash of a window and '
peered out upon ash boxes, coal scuttles;
iind barrels of straw without number, and
was about to close his observations when
the sash came down with a thud and
struck him behind the shoulders. In his
fright he fell to his knees, and while tho .
solid half of his body was all right the ;
lighter was over the window silL In ad- .
ditiou to the weight of tho sash any
movement of the body was accompanied '
by pain. The sash could not be reached -with
his hands freely enough to lift it, -and
it soon occurred to the prominent ,
citizen that he ought to have help. Ha
could not expect it from behind, for he
waa alone in- the store, bnt as he looked
down into the alley a boy came stumping
along to find something' worth lugging
away.. $ ; .
"Hello, boy! telle-!" called the citi
zen. ' " Hello yourself !" cried the boy as he
looked np. " ' ' t,
.' "Say, . boy, come under the window
here; t want to speak to you.". -j
" Not much, yer don't, chuckled the
gamin. "You can't drop no coal scuttles
on my head." .-.. ;
j " But I don't mean to."
" Mebbe not, but you've got a bad face
on you for all that When did you get
out of the jug?" "
; "Boy, I wau't your help." .
j "So does your aunt ( . Don't get me
to stand in with no such duffer aa von
are!"
', "I am caught in this window and want
togetout" ' '
: " So would I ! - Been prospecting for
old junk, eh? You'll get six months, for
that 1" , - . ;
; '" If you'll come up stairs and help me
out III give you a dollar !"
A dollar 1 You can't play no dollar -store
on me, old man ! If you make np
another face like that at me I'll hit you
in the eye with this old lemon. 1 don't
look starched up, but I don't let any man
insult me all the same."
"Don't you know who I am?" softly .
asked the citizen.
" Naw, I don't; bnt 111 bet the perlece
do! You've got one of the hardest mugs
on you I ever saw, and I've a good mind
to give you one just for luck I Look out
now." . .. ..
- He made as if he would throw, and
the citizen dodged. This was such fun
for the boy that he kept it up for three
or four minutes, and the offer of $2 had '
no effect on him. Then he gathered six
or eight old lemons and oranges together
and said:
" I believe you are the boss hyena who
knocked dad down at the caucus, and
I'm going to drive your nose back ex
actly an inch !" - - : A
"If you throw at me 111 call the po
lice !" exclaimed the citizen.
"The sooner ye call the sooner yell'
be jugged ! , Here's to hit yon square on
the nose!" J ; ' -.
- The opening of the back door of a
store and the appearance of a man dis
concerted the lad's aim, and the lemon
struck the citizen's hat instead of his
nose. His yells brought a climax, but
the air was full of tropical fruit even as '
the boy dusted down the alley and turned
a corner.- - . . ? . f
The boy couldn't help acting that way.
He was born so. He wouldn't have been
a bit like a boy to run up stairs and re
leased the man. He didn't have a fair
chance with his spoiled lemons, bnt boys
soon get over diBappointmentik. Detroit

A Lime-Kiln Clnb Episode. ''
The ' question before x the Club was:
" Is a person who has a police whistle in -his
pocket any safer than a man who can
jump a six-rail fenoe?" , "At de fust
glance dat seems an oneasy conundrum,"
answered the old man, "but when you
cum to ponder on it you mus' see dat de
jumper can't alius fin' a fence to jump.
He may jump agin a house, or a tree, or
a hedge. An may jump ober a fence to
escape robbers only to be tackled by a
wolf-trap or a bull-dog. " If you have a
purleece whistle, an' de purleece hev
time to answer a call, an' you lay de
whistle down an' tackle de pusson an'
hold him fast till de officer arroves, it am
better dan jumpin', but de chances am
dat de judge will let de man off an' hint
dat you didn't hev a Case 'miff to hang a
hat on. Seems to me, ' considerin' all
circumference, dat it am bee' to take a
street kyar fin as ye kin an put in some,
tal runnin' de balance of de way."
" De President doubtless meant to ay
circumstances instead of circumferences,
remarked the Bev. Penstock as he grace
fully straightened his spinal column. - -
" Brudder Penstock, dis char wants it
distinctly , understood dat when it aaya
circumferencee it . doan,' mean, numn
else!"

stances," added the Reverend, as be sat .
down. "An4 some folks might have

An Eye Fountain.
The eyesight of the Czar is said to
have greatly improved by a simple rem
edy, consisting of a glasvnoi douche, or
eye fountain, throwing a tiny jet of deli
cate spray a yard and a half into the air.
,The temperature of the water is fixed at
1 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and the spray is
allowed to beat agninst the eyelids for
ninety seconds, night and morning. The
remedy seems at first sight ridiculously
simple, but it has for several years been
successfully employed in Russia. For
the literary man or jaded beauty, going
,with weak and weary eyes to rest, there
is said to be nothing more refreaning
than to bend for a minute or two over a
glaznoi douche. The eyes recover
strength in on amazing manner from
ithe fine but powerful impact of the in-1
;vigorating spray, and there is none of
tnat depressive reaction succeeding the ,
use of tonics. ,
A poetess in the Chicago Tribune'
moans, "I am sick of the seasons that
come and go." Her case is hopeless.
Not one of the 4,000 patent nostrums
advertised in the newspapers and on the
board fences is warranted to cure a per
son who is sick of the seasons that come'
and go. The only remedy we can sug
gest is to employ all the almanac builders
to invent some new seasons and drop the
old ones. And have 'em made stationary,
so they won't "come and go." Norri
