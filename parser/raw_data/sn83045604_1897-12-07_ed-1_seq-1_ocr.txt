WASHINGTON. Dec. 6-At noon today
the nrst regular session of the fifty-fifth
congress was launched upon the unknown
seas of legislation. Simultaneously at
both ends of the capltol, Speaker Reed in
the house and Vice President Hobart in
the senate, dropped their gavels and
called to order the bodies over which they
preside.
The sun shone brig.itly from a cloudless
sky, making glotlous the bright December
day, with a tinge of frost in the air and
a breeze just strong enough to keep the
stars and stripes snapping from flagstaffs.
At the capltol crowds swarmed into the
corridors at an early hour and choked the
marhie steps as they ascended to the
galleries from which they were to view
the show. As usual on such occasions,
the reserved galleries were carefully
guarded, admission being only by card.and
the public had great difficulty in wedging
itself into the limited space set aside for
It.
In the Senate.
The attendance upon the session of the
senate today both on the floor and in the
galleries was notably large, despite the
well understood fact that little business
bf yond the presentation of the president's
message and the proceedings incident
thereto would be transacted.
Prior to the convening of the senate,
ths members passed a half hour In ex
changing greetings. Hanna, of Ohio,
who has been ill for a week, was given
a cordial welcome by his Republican col
leagues. Woicott of Colorado, one of the
members of the monetary commission,
was given a warm reception.
Dr. Godfrey Hunter, of Kentucky, the
recently appointed minister to Guatemala,
was an interested spectator to the pro
ceedings.
When the senate convened after the re
cess. Hen. H. P. 8. Money, the new sen
ator from Mississippi, entered the cham
ber, but the oath of office was not admin
istered to him during the session. The re
ception and the reading of the president's
message was the only feature of the da^.
The senate chamber at The opening of
the session today was a veritable con
servatory. The floral display was beauti
ful. Precisely at 12 o'clock the gavel of
Vice President Hobart fell, and the sen
ate was called to order. The invocation
was delivered by Dr. Miiburn, the blind
chaplain. Seventy-seven senators re
sponded on roll call. The venerable Mr.
Morrill of Vermont was the first recog
nize! by Vice President Hobart. He of
fered a resolution, which was passed in the
usual fonn. that the secretary Inform the

WASHINGTON. Dec. 6-The opening
day In the regular session of the house
passed without incident of any character.
The formal; *ies attending the inauguration
of the session are dry. ar.d, except as a
spectacle; hardly authorised the crowds
which thronged the public and private gal
lerie-s. Yet the visitors sat through the
whole proceeding.
Dtngley. the floor leader of the majority;
Bailey, the ret -gnixed leader of the minor
ity. and Grosvenor of Ohio enjoyed the dis
tinguished honor of being appointed to wait
upon the president, whose message was. of
course, the ever.t of the day. Its reading
was long and tedious, but it was followed
with close attention by the members and
spectators in the galleries. There was no
demonstration untii the reading was con
cluded. when the R«=*publicans joined in a
hearty expression of approval.
immediately after the reading of the mes
sage. the house adjourned out of respect
to the memory of Senator George, of Mis
sissippi. and Representative Wright, of
Massachusetts, who di-ed during the recess.
The house of representatives presented
an animated appearance long before noon
The surrounding corridors were filled with
jostling, moving crowds, and before 11
o'clock the galleries which overlook the
floor were with people. Floral trib
utes for members were numerous and in
some instances imposing.
As the hands of the clock pointed to 12
o'clock Speaker Reed, attired in a black
cutaway coat and wearing a red tie, as
cended the rostrum. On the crack of the
gavel the din on the floor and conversation
in the galleries were subdued.
In the deep silence which followed calling
the assemblage to order. the prayer of the
eminent divine Rev. Charles A. Bonry. of
England, who delivered the invocation, was
solemn and impressive. The speaker then
declared the house in session.
The roll call showed the presence of 301
members. There were fifty-three vacancies
from deaths and resignations during the
recess, and the credentials of members
elect were read by the direction of the
speaker, who administered the oath of of
fce to them.
On motion of Dlngley a resolution was
adopted for the appointment of a commit
tee of three to join the senate committee
to wait upon the president and inform him
that congress was ready to receive any
communication desired to make.
The speaker selected Dingiey, Grosvenor
and Bailey for this honor. On motion of
Henderson of lowa, it was ordered that the
daily sessions begin at noon each day. The
house then took a short recess.
When the house reassembled the commit
tee appointed to wait upon the president re
ported having perfected its mission.
Mr. Pruden. who bad followed the com
mittee into the hall. Immediately presented
the message, which, by direction of the
speaker, vsas read at the clerk's desk.
The message was listened to with great
earnestness, especially the portions dealing
with currency reform and our attitude to
ward Cuba. There was no demonstration
until the conclusion, when the Republicans
Joined in a round of applause.
Lawrence, Rep., of Massachusetts, offi
cially announced the death of his predeces
sor. the late Representative Wright, and

COMMENT OX THE MESSAGE.
English Paper* Inclined to Pral*e
the Currency Feature and the
Moderate Tone on t'«il»n.
LONDON. Dec. 7.—The Daily Chronicle
describes the message as "weak and color
less. compared with the. vigorous handling
of public questions to which Mr. Cleveland
accustomed us."
The Morning Post, after paying a tribute
to the president's fine sense of duty. In the
face of domestic trouble, in sending the
message at the appointed hour, says:
"On the Cuban question the president is
vague and diffuse, but studiously correct."
The editorial specifically praises Presi
dent McKinley's treatment of the curreucy
question.
The Times says:
"Its tone of patronizing tolerance will
make the message not wholly agreeable to
Spain. Probably flu- president calculates
that If he can satisfy the jingoes for a time
with eloquent denunciations and warnings,
he will find it easier to pursue a moderate
policy.
"Regarding his currency proposals. It
seems too probable that Mr. McKinlcy still
clings to th* notion that something may be
done for silver. So long as he follows that
will o' the wisp hi 1 can hardly be expected
to attempt any thorough-going reform of
the currency."
The Standard says:
"The best that can be said of the mes
sage is that it is absolutely unexciting. As
a distinguished politician, the president la
bored under grave difficulties, and it is no
reproach to his skill that he has failed to
surmount them."

GALVESTON. Dec. 6.—Hon. William J.
Bryan reached here today and left with a

follows on the president's message:
"The message indicates an intention up
on the part of the president to aid in turn

PORT AU PRINCE. Dec. «.-The trou
ble between Germany and Hayti, as the
result of the arrest and Imprisonment of
I-ueders, reached a crisis today. Two
German cruisers entered the p< rt during
the morning and an ultimatum from the
German government w is delivered to the
Haytian government, xivlnx the latter
eight
of Germany for Indemnity to H-rr Lued
ers. The members of the diplomatic
corps believe that the government nf the
republic has decided to accept the condi
tions of Germany.
BERLIN, Dec. G. Baron von Bulowa.
minister for foreign affairs, said, referring
to Hayti:
"We are not satisfied with a mer* re
lease of Hetr Luedcrs, and have demand
ed satisfaction and compensation for his
lllegs! Incarceration, which was contrary
to Havtian and International laws. We
hope the government of Hayti will ac
cept our legitimate demands and admit
th« justice of our claims. We have the
will and power to enforce it."
A dispatch to the Frankfurter Z«dtting
from Washington says Hayti is ready to
pay Germany th» indemnity demanded for
the alleged i!!--Kal arrest and imprison
ment of Herr Emil Eueders, a German
subject.
KINGSTON. Dec. 6.—Advices received
here today from Port au Prince show that
serious trouble is imminent in Hayti. The

Seeded Street Improvements.
Important features of the regular mat
ing of the city council held last night
were the resolution adopted creating a
committee to prepare a revised scale of
salaries for the police and tire depart
ments and the ordinance Introduced by
Mr. James looking to the adoption of a
charter amendment at the next city elec
tion, llsing the liquor license at $1,030 a
year, thus taking this important work
from the hands of the city council. The
James ordinance) was referred, but will
likely IH» |KC..-.'.1, and the voters of the
city will b»* called t«u at the next elect ton
to say whether the amendment as pro
posed shall bo adopted. There ;s every
reason to "believe that no other proposed
amendment will figure more prominently
In the coming election than the one sug
gested by .Mr. James.
The resolution relative to Increasing the
salaries of members of the Are and police
departments was the outgrowth of a long
communication from the members of the
lire department In which they complained
of the low salaries they are receiving. They
insisted that they receive less pay than
the employes of any other fire department
and set up r. asous for this contention.
The resolution was introduced by Rudy
and reads as follows:
"Whereas, During the past four years
the compensation of policemen and fire
men of the city of .Seattle has been upon
a minimum basis; and
"Whereas. Recent advances In rents and
in the prices of supplies and other Item*
of the cost of living have operated to still
further reduce the compensation of the
city employes; and
"Whereas, Owing to more active condi
tions in the city's business life the duties
of members of these two department*
have become more arduous and hazardous;
now. therefore be It
"Resolved, That a special committee be
and the same Is hereby appointed to pre
pare and submit to the council In the
form of an ordinance, a revised scale if
wages for these two departments, to take
t ffeot on January 1. IS9B, or as soon there
after as may be found practicable, said
committee tr* consist of the chairman on
labor, the chairman of the committee on
fire and water, the chairman of the com
mittee on police, license and revenue, the
chairman of the committee on finance and
the chairman of the ordinance committee."
Rrnnon* of the Firemen.
The reasons the members of the fire de
partment give for Hating that lhe> are the
poorest paid employes of the city were In
the language of the firemen, as follows:
"First-B'-cmn-e In no ether department
of the city Is there such wear an 1 tear on
clothes', which lt< m i« a r<*ri>us exptnse to
each and every member. We are required to
appear properly uniformed, and at nearly
every fire there 1* danger to our wearing
apparel, which must be at once made
good.
"Second—Because no favor has been
shown us on account of the fact that un
like any Other city employe, we are com
pelled hy our limited time for our wwli, to
resile close to our stations or be trevented
from reaching our homes oftener than
once or twice a .day. In the ease of most
of th> companion this entails either much
hardship or tht» payment of rent* 'hat are
a severe burden.
"Third—Because, although our hours of
dally service number from two so threw
times as many as are required frcri < ther
city nuploye*. '»ur salaries average l«.-s
than !ho-<* of other departm nte. For 24
hours * da> continuous duty ut our sta
tion. the duty requiring not only constant
