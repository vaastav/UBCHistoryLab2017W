TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6.
The attitude of the Republican party
of New Mexico has always been con
sistent on the question of the admission
of the territory as a state. We favored
the admission of the territory when the
Democratic party was united in their
opposition against it. We still favor
its admission, believing that there is no
good and substantial reason for keeping
us out of the Union as a state and be
lieve that this can best be accomplished
by the election of a delegate to congress
who is in harmony with Republican
politics and principles. Republican
Platform, New Mexico, 1898.
Now that congress is in session, the
friends of statehood for New Mexico
should redouble their efforts to secure
the admission of the territory as
state.
blateliood tor JSew Mexico: That is
the live issue in the territory today, and
there will be no lull in the battle until
congress passes an enabling act, a con
stitution has been adopted by the peo
ple and another star has been added to
the field of blue in the old flag.
Mr. Hoar, of Massachusetts, may be
expected to do a great deal of talking
during the next three months. He is
ferninst the administration, and when
a. man becomes a "ferninster," his case
is hopeless and the country must suffer
while his hat is shattered in the crown.
Reports from all parts of the United
States show that the apple crop the
past season was very short and In
many sections a complete failure. San
ta Fe orchards yielded the usual crop,
and there is room for hundreds more.
Irrigation and sunshine insure a steady
yield. The moral of present conditions
is obvious.
There are a lot of would-be reformers,
from the currency cranks to the man
who wants the government to build an
air-line railroad across the continent,
who should be discouraged from visit
ing Washington this winter. What the
country wants and needs is a business
session of congress. The session must
adjourn on March 4th, and the time for
transacting business is short enough
without attempting to upset all condi
tions governing commerce, finances and
prosperity.
"Coin" Harvey and Chairman Jones,
the managers and bosses of the Demo
cratic party, are very sure that pros
perity has not struck the country.
Their contribution box continues in a
state of lonesomeness that is distress
ing. The" presidential campaign is only
two years distant, and unless those
monthly installment dollars come in
more freely, there will be considerable
distress in Democratic headquarters be
fore the fun really begins.
Willian T. Stead is making wonderful
discoveries in Europe concerning the
opinion of America and Americans
held on the continent. Mr. Stead once
visited Chicago and wrote a book
about what he saw in that city Chi
cago still occupies the lake shore.
America and the Americans will prob
ably survive the terrible things the gen
tleman has heard said across the wa
ters concerning this country. There is
no grounds whatever for getting un
easy over Mr. Stead's discoveries.
The Kansas furmers are growing au
tocratic and demand that the state leg
islature abolish the three days' grace
allowed the maker of a note. No won
der that state went Republican at the
last election. Mortgages all paid off;
more money in the banks than is known
what to do with, and a cinch on the rest
of the country by reason of money
loaned to the unfortunates of other
states, Kansas will soon become the
"Wall street" of North America, and
then look out.
According to press reports, every
country in Europe Is devising means
and measures to prevent all the gold
In the continent sliding to the United
States. Trade balances in favor of the
Yankees are enormous, and there is a
well defined fear abroad that prompt
payment will be demanded on the first
of the coming year. Perhaps, the next
time the president of the United States
sends a commission acress the ocean
to arrange for the remonetization of sil
ver the demeanor of the money kings in
London, Paris, Berlin and Vienna, will
not be so haughty. Adversity often
drives sense into heads which never
contained much before.
Up to the present time no great
amount of Interest has been manifested
by the general public in the squabble
among the Democratic members of the
lower house of congress for the leader
Bhlp of them inority. The matter may
be of grave Importance, but the country
does not so consider it. So far as the
leadership of the Democratic wing of
the house Is concerned and Jts possible
effectB upon the presidential election
of 1900, the voters are very little Inter
ested: the present is about all the aver
aroiro mnn can take care of, without
crossing bridges two years ahead.
The papers of Colorado are making a
great todo over sugar beets raised in
that state which averaged 16.3 per cent
sugar and M.b purity, isew Mexico
beets are sweeter and better than Colo
rado beets, and still there is not one bit
if enthusiasm over the possibilities of
the growing of beets and making sugar
hi the territory. Santa Fe produces the
best quality of beets raised in the
United States, suid ought to have a fac
tory under construction right now, but
she hasn't. What is the matter with
the citizens of the city and county that
some efforts is not being made to se
cure an enterprise which will bring
back to the old city the "days of before
the railroad" so much lamented?
The surplus in the national treasury
worrying the Democrats terribly.
They are afraid it will be looted by de
signing Republican politicians and that
all manner of evils will result to the
country. Within the memory of men
living the country had a Democratic
administration, and then there was no
surplus. Democracy and deficit have
synonomous sound to this day as the
result of that experiment. The Demo
crats and free traders need not worry
about the present surplus being wasted.
Uncle Sam has plenty of places to place
it without indulging In extravagances,
and the money will be used to the best
advantage in paying debts and improv
ing the army and navy.
What Uncle Sam Gains.
From the following list it will be seen
that the United States has made gains
from Spain which compensate in some
measure for the expenditure of life and
treasure caused by the brief war with
that country. In the first place, Puerto
Rico is ceded to the United States;
secondly, Cuba is being evacuated; then
there is the cession to the United States
of the Philippine archipelago, including
the Sulu group, upon the payment of
$20,000,000; the cession of an island in
the Ladrone group and the renunciation
of all claims for indemnity, religious lib
erty in the Caroline islands is demand
ed; also the liberation of all political
prisoners, the restoration of past treat
ies and commercial relations, the ces
sion of an island in the Caroline group
for a telegraphic and naval station, and
last, but by no means least, the ces
sion of cable station rights at other
points in Spain's jurisdiction.
At present Spain refuses to grant re
ligious liberty in her Caroline or any
other possessions, for if there is a coun
try where the church and state are
welded into oile homogeneous mass, it
is in countries under the Spanish crown,
and stated portions of the public reve
nues are scrupulously set apart for the
support of the dominant church. And
it is just where such an oppressive com
bination exists that the wheels of prog
ress are stayed and the face of civ
ilization is turned back in the path
way of time where there is inability to
learn by the light of experience and an
unwillingness to improve conditions so
as to increase the common intelligence,
and to encourage the arts, sciences and
mechanical industries. Spain has left
this oppressive, stifling policy as a leg
acy to the countries which have thrown
off her governmental yoke, but not the
yoke that bound church and state to
gether. England is an example where
this policy exists in its mildest form;
but in the light of events the disestab
lishment of state and church in
England and Scotland is sure to come
as it has in Ireland, thanks to the wis
dom of the late Premier Gladstone.
The absence of such embarrassing ties
is characteristic of the most en
lightened nations, and while in Great
Britain it may be said to yet exist, still
it is in the form rather than the sub
stance, and its power is more historic
than of any present actual weight.
The restoration of past treaties and
commercial relations have already met
with an obstruction, in the refusal of
Spain to revive the Cushing protocol
covering a certain class of alleged pub
lic offenses, and from the touchy atti
tude of the Spanish government, it is
evident that a revision of such treaties
will take some time, and Spain will not
hesitate to demand such changes as
may seem advantageous to her. Then
the amicable settlement in the matter
of cable and naval stations will require
discussion, so that is is plain the joint
peace commission can not be dissolved
for perhaps a month to come.
The President's Message.
President McKinley's annual message
to congress, which .was delivered to
that body yesterday, was longer than
state papers coming from his hands us
ually are, but the comprehensiveness of
the document made Imperative a more
extended review of the affairs of the
nation than for a considerable time in
the past.
Beginning with the incidents of the
Cuban rebellion and the destruction of
the Maine, which caused the war with
Spain, the president rapidly and clearly
sketches the dramatic incidents of the
war, which, only lasting 121 days, es
tablished the power of the United
States on the seas and convinced a
skeptical world that the volunteer sol
diers of this country are the equal of
any other force, man for man, now
known, and that the armies and navy
of the country are superior in many es
sential and vital respects to the trained
regiments and sailors of European
countries. One thing the president said
In his message will meet the hearty ap
proval of every man In the Union, no
matter what his political belief, and
that is that the nation owes to the sol
diers and sailors who took part in the
war, either on the field of battle or in
the great detention camps, a debt of
gratitude which cannot be expressed,
and which can never be paid in this life.
In touching upon the government and
the future of the islands which have
come to the United States as a result of
the war, the president shows a spirit of
fairness and aggressiveness which will
commend him to every American.
While he does not outline any definite
course of action to be pursued In form
ulating and preparing a government for
the peoples who have lately come under
the shadow of the stars and stripes,
he clearly conveys the Impression that
so soon as they are able to govern
themselves, they will be given the op
portunity, and the United States will
aid In the advancement of education,
religious liberty, and personal responsi
bility, will endeavor to teach nations
that have been oppressed for centuries,
the art of taking car of themselves
and of bettering their condition with
out wreaking vengeance upon those
more unfortunate than themselves. The
objects the administration has in view,
in dealing with the islands, will forever
emove any reproach to the United
States for freeing them from Spanish
rule, no matter what disposition may
be made of them in the future, The
war was begun In the name of human
ity, and in the manner it began will it
be closed, and the direct results will
be to add to the civilizing powers of
national strength; the new territory
which has fallen to the keeping of this
country will benefit by the change.
The president is plainly an expansion
ist, judging from his utterances on the
policy of the government, and the rec
ommendations made regarding Chinese
markets, and foreign relations gener
ally. In relation to the latter, it is
gratifying to Know mat uuring me ptim
year, aside from the rupture with
Spain, there has been no threatening
situations diplomatically with the for
eign powers. Austria seems to think
she has a grievance against this coun
try in the Pennsylvania coal riots, but
there is nothing in that to cause any
apprehension. , At the present time the
United States is at peace with the
world, is attending to her own business
and endeavoring to honestly solve the
weighty questions which have pre
sented themselves as a result of the late
war.
Regarding the finances of the coun
try, the president has not lost sight of
the importance of maintaining the
credit of the country at home and
abroad, and gives positive assurances
that every dollar of the circulating me
dium will be maintained as good as
that of any other country on the globe.
No doubt in the free silver circles fault
will be found with the message on that
point, but in business and financial cen
ters there will be no loss of confidence
in the stability of the financial system
by reason of what the president said.
Coming nearer home, the president
touches upon the water rights in the
southwest, and urges congress to take'
such measures as may be considered
best to place irrigation on a basis which
will be practical and of universal ben
efit. Particularly is attention called to
the water rights along the Rio Grande,
over which there has been much con
troversy between this government and
that of Mexico, and it Is to be hoped
that in the near future that matter
will be settled in a just and satisfactory
manner to all concerned.
The message, viewed from any stand
point, is able and noteworthy for the
reason that the president has had the
courage to make such recommendations
as he thinks best for the country, re
gardless of what may be said of it by
his political opponents and critics, and
he has laid the business of the country
before congress In a comprehensive
manner which will enable the members
to grasp the requirements of the situa
tion and work to some advantage and
with business-like celerity.

Contagious blood poison is absolutely

the only remedy which goes direct to
the cause of the disease and forces it
from the system.
I was afflicted with Blood Poison, and the
best doctors did me no good, though I took
their treatment latin
fully. In fact, I seemed
to get worse all the

seem to reach the dis

whatever. I was dis

that I would never be
