rather than go back to the name of
East !LBs.vyegAS. . r'
It Is undoubtedly true that if the
post -office department establishes
two postofflces In Las Vegas, it will
prefer to have and perhaps Insist on
bavlng either the city or town change
Its name, owing to the inextricable
confusion that will otherwise result
in the handling of mall matter.
It It likely that the matter will not
be definitely decided until It has been
-carried to the court of the highest re
sort by tbe postmaster general that
it unless the people of Las Vegas
themselves drop the onntent.
I ' ThA rintlff ttaa alafava nniln, all
cum stances, advocated a central post
, office. Won't it be better, now, if the
.people of both town And city, Instead
of disturbing the harmonious relations
that have been existing for months,
instead of long postponing the final
issue, should get together, bring their
united Influence to bear upon con
gress to secure a government building
in a central location. Citizens of the
city and of the town, it can be dob.
The explanation of the unfortunate
situation that has long existed here in
congress will ensure an appropriation
for a new building. The future peace
and prosperity of Las Vegas depends
upon the union of effort of Its citltens.
Both city an town have been pro
gressing rapidly of late. There has
been no discord, no bint of the strife
that long kept back progress. New

city Aid tbe town who ere anxious In
tbe interest of tbe future of Las
Vegas to barmonfxe all differences
end secure a central government
building and postoffice and unite all
the people on common ground. Unless
this can be done, both the city and the
town will suffer.
It it not well to permit ancient jeal-

are afforded. It Is quite possible that
before very' long similar' Arrange

TRADE CONDITIONS.
Henry Clews says:
The stock market situation Itr not
entirely satisfactory. While outside
conditions with few exceptions con
tinue encouraging, the technical cltu
a tlon of the market Is one t hat, to say
the least, excites doubt. The plunging
i perat.onti' lu certain stocks' srirh as
Tenesnee Coal A Iron, and the re
actionary tendencies of other securi
ties such as Rock Island, illustrate
the need of sharp dlrcrlmlnatlon. Al
though general conditions are sound
And satisfactory, there is a remark
able absence of bullish activity
amony strong conservative and lead
ing banking Interests. The latter par
ties may be called "stand-patters,"
and are naturally not averse to see
ing better prices for investments, but
their absence from active partlcipt
tlon In many of the recent stock mar
ket operations It at letst suggestive.
Here and there storks have been
singled out and pushed up to top
heavy offices by the plunging opera
tions of a few very bold And rich oper
ators. Needless to say. such securi
ties are best left alone by the buyer
of ordinary means And information,
particularly as there are indications
that some of the po"'" the active
storks have been securing a portion
of . the very attractive profits which
have been offered to tbemf, notably In
the Coalers, which bare declined with
out Any other Apparent cAuse than
liquidation.
Little regard has been paid to the
limitations of the money market.
Bank reserves are still low and loans
high, so that the margin continues
slender on which to conduct any bull
campaign of Importance. This proba-

select one stock at a time for advance-.
ment in preference to engineering a
general advance, a movement which j
would quickly fall to pieces under ex

be remembered that only a small por-

when the risks of money stringency
will be much diminished. Funds are
still wanted at the Interior owing to
the activity of business in that sec
tion, ' Ind we shall not be entirely
"out of the woods" to far as tbe lo
cal market Is concerned until after
the December and January disburse
ments, which will be much larger than
usual. The international money mar

anxiety. Russia Is still a disturbing

The joint statehood bill has been
Introduced in the house and the fight
will soon begin. . It seems likely that
despite the opposition of the demo
crats and Mr. Tawny and those of his
republican friends who really under
stand the sentiment and the condi
tions in New Mexico and Arizona that
the bill will pass the house. It Is ex
tremely doubtful if it will pass the
t-cnate. It la more than likely that
the Renate will pass a bill providing
for the admission of New Mexico
alone and leaving Arizona out at her
own request for the time.

The people of New Mexico, Irrespec-,
tlve of party, will be pleased to hear
of the re-appolntment of J. Wallace

republicans of former note In the ter
ritory, but was endorsed by both'
Secretary Hitchcock and Governor
Hagerman His familiarity with all
the details of the office of governor
will be of great service to Mr. Hager

able young man of the staunchest
