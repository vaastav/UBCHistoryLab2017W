SHOULD HAVE BODYGUARD.
'Mayor's Private Secretary Is Again
Disturbed by Burglars. .
If present conditions continue the.
mayor's private secretary, Thomas
Brown Jr., will have to apply to his hon
or for a bodyguard. He seems to be a
marked man for burglars.
A short time ago some unknown per
sona attempted to assassinate him, un
doubtedly for his money, as no one would
ever threaten his life for any other rea
son, and last Wednesday night, as he was
enjoying his favorite perfecto in; the
quiet of his home, and feeding his mind
on food that would enable him to get
out the next issue of the News Letter,
he was aroused from his lethargic state
by hearing the click of a key which was
being inserted in the kitchen door.
His good wife, who had retired for the
night, was also aroused by the unusual
noise, and hastened - into the room to
notify her husband of the occurrence,
fearing that he might riot have heard:
it. But brave Tom was thoroughly
aroused, and bade her go to rest and
keep out of danger's way.
Tom then seized his trusty six-shooter,
and in a loud voice announced his inten
tion of making a sieve of any whom he
■might find trespassing amongst his - pre
served fruits that were stored in the
pantry. The noise he made descending
the stairs must have frightened the
burglars away, for when he arrived at
the scene of their proposed depredations
the room was vacant, and on going to
the door he discovered two dark-figures
making tracks across the back lot.
He did not shoot, however, fearing that
his aim might not be true, and some in
nocent victim would bite the dust, hit
by the bullet that was intended for an
other. Tom says it is unsafe in these
strenuous times for one to ;be incum
bered with too much wealth, and he has.
made a public announcement asking ell
burglars to please take notice that his
silverware is each night carefully hidden
where it requires the assistance of a
search warrant to locate it in the morn
ing, and his money is always securely
locked in the safety deposit vaults.
LANGUISHES IX JAIL.
Cora E. Matthews Will Have a Hear-
in Dec. •-'•'>.
The hearing in the case against Mrs.
Cora E. Matthews, charged with passing
counterfeit money, came up yesterday
afternoon before United States Commis
sioner Abbott, but inasmuch as the at
torneys were not ready, a postponement
was taken until Dec. 23. - ♦ •
Meanwhile Mrs. Matthews languishes
in jail. Yesterday she managed to se
cure the $2,000 bail demanded upon the
charge for which she was held, but as
soon as it was offered Assistant United
States District Attorney Dickson pre
sented another warrant charging ocr
with passing bad money in St. Paul. 
She was rearrested upon this charge
immediately.- 1 It is now agreed that she
can have, temporary freedom- upon fur
nishing bail to the amount of $3,000.
When the woman was first arrested sue
gave the name of "Nettie K. Matthews."
Yesterday she stated that her true name
was "Cora E. Matthews," nd that the
name she had first given was that of her
Bister.
Detectives say that in Ernest Mat
thews, the stepson of the woman, they
have a man who is known to have "Con
sorted with the famous Dockery gang
in the palmy burglary days of the latt?r.
The young fellow is well known to the
authorities as one who passed similar
money upon a Red Wing merchant on
Nov. 12, but he said she was not the
woman wanted.
Ernest Matthews will have a hearing
Saturday next.

yesterday consented to an additional stay
of five days before commencing action in
the case of Hennepin county against
former Sheriff Alonzo Phillips to recover
I for alleged overcharges.
Attorney James A. Peterson, who, with
A. B. Choate. has charge of Mr. Phillips'
case, has been in the northern part: of
the state on business during the past
week and has oh this account been un
able to give any of his time to the Phil
lips matter.
The stay was allowed to enable Mr. Pe
terson to look over the part of the evi
dence which had been submitted to him
by the assistant county attorney.
Mr. Choate declined "yesterday to make
any statement as to the answer which he
-and Mr. Peterson would make to the de
mands of the county authorities. •He
said the answers would depend a goo.l
deal on what Mr. Peterson advised.
CITY FUNDS SHORT.
Policemen to Receive Ony Half of
Their Mouth's Salaries.
Mayor Ames' policemen must do their
Christmas shopping with half-filled pock
etbooks. They will be paid their De
cember salaries on the 21st of the month,
but they will receive only half pay.
., This is because the appropriation for
the year 1901 is exhausted.
The patrolmen do not relish the present
low: condition of the police department
finances, which they attribute to the
creation by the mayor of so many plain
clothes captains. *.*
The patrolmen are not talking for pub
lication, but one of them, who declined to
permit the use of his name on the ground
that it would cost him his job, said to a
Globe reporter yesterday:
"Such a waste of money in the police
department I have never seen before,

WOULD MAKE TROUBLE.
A Few Democrat!) Are Sore on Pres
ent County. Committee. -;I-vi;
Chairman Whitmarsh called his com
mittee together yesterday and reported
the ill success of the effort to secure front
the county organization the promise 'to
vacate March next to make room for a
new committee to take charge of Demo
cratic interests in the county. ■■--
The committee was unanimously of the
opinion that the ultimatum given by the
county organization - meant war, and de
cided without dissent to call a mass meet
ing of Democrats to take the matter in
charge and provide for the election of a
new set of precinct committeemen," from
which a new county organization can be
molded.
No date for the proposed mass meeting
was fixed, but it is promised at an early
date, probably between Christmas and
New Year's. " . ■ ■■
The call to be issued will be carefully
prepared and will be an elaborate pre
sentation of the situation in the county
as viewed by the protesting element of
the party. The claim will be boldly made
that the organization of which Elijah
Barton is the head, has no legal claim to
recognition at the bands of the party,and
it is expected on both sides that the
courts will ultimately be called upon to
decide which element is entitled to recog
nition. •-'.,•% % : • - . ' ■

BIG TRUST IS PLANNING A LOT OF
IMPROVEMENTS.
- PITTSBURG, Dec. 12.—Some extensive
improvements and enlargements of ; the
various plants of the United States -Steel
corporation have just been decided upon
by the advisory board of the big steel
combination: The most important action
of the board was a decision to largely in
crease the steel producing; capacity of
the corporation, as the:output of finished
material is far in advance of that of th*
Bessemer converters and open hearth
plants. It is estimated that the monthly
output can .be increased thousands of
tons by adopting the ; Monell ; process at
all the open hearth plants of the com
pany. The American Tinplate - company
will also in the near future install ma
chinery for the rolling of black plate for
tin mills that will be largely automatic.
