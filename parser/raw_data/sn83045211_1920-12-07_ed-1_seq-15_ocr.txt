Finances Shew Improvement
The nation's finances have shown
Barked Improvement during the past
rear. The total ordinary receipts of
i0,C94,00O,00e for the fiscal year
1020 exceeded these for 1010 by
l,54'2.000.00O. while the total net
ordinary expenditures decreased from
118.514,0110.000 te $lMO.'U)00,000.
The grns public debt, which
reached its highest point en August
Si. lfllO. when it was ?-0..r08,000.-000.
had dropped en November 30,
11)20, te SLM.l'.'.OOO.OOO. There has
also been n marked decreased in
holdings of government war securi
ties bv the banking institutions of
the oeiiiitty as well as in the amount
of bills held by the 'Federal Reserve
Banks secured by government war
obligations. This fei lunate result
has relieved the banks and left them
frter te finance the needs of agri
culture, industry and commerce.
It 1ms been due In large part te
lie' reduction of the public debt,
specially of the llentlng debt, but
mere particularly te the improved dis
tribution of government securities
among permanent Investors. The ces
sation of the government's borrow
ing except through short-term certifi
cates of Indebtedness 1ms been n mat
ter of great consequence te the peo
ple, of the country at large, as well
as, te the holders of Liberty bends
and Victory notes, and has had an
important bearing upon the matter of
effective credit control.
The j par has been chnractrlzcd by
thft progressive withdrawal of the
treasury from the domestic credit
market and from a position of dom
inant influeuce in that maiket. The
future course will necessarily depend
upon the extent te which economies
ara practiced nnd upon the burdens
placed upon the treasury, as well ns
upon industrial developments and the
maintenance of tax receipts nt n
ufticlcntly high level.
Rigid Economy Necessary
The fundamental fact which at
present dominates the government's
financial situation is that seven and
half billions of its war indebted
ness mature within the next two nnd
a liulf j ears Of this amount two
and a lui'f billions are floating debt
and fie liillintiK Victory notes nnd

Third ivnd final session of tlie Sixty-sixth Congress opened en Monday. The Rev. Henry N. Ceudcn, blind chap
lain of the Heuse, was offering the opening prayer when tlte camera clicked
further payments aggregating possi
bly SO.10,000,000 must still be made
te the railroads during the current
yenr. It Ih obvious that these large
payments have already seriously lim
ited the government's progress in re
tiring the floating debt.
Closely cenneded with this it
seems te me is the necessity for tin
immediate consideration of the revi
sion of our tax laws. Simplification
of the income and profits taxes hns
become nn immediate necessity. These
taxes performed nn Indispensable
service during the war.
The need for their simplification,
however, Is Very great, In order te
save the taxpayer inconveniences
nnd expenses and in order te make his
liability mere certain nnd definite.
Other and mere detulled recommen
dations with regard te taxes will no
doubt be laid before you by the
secretary of the treasury and the
commissioner of internal revenue.
Care of Disabled Veterans a Duty
It is my privilege te draw te the
attention of Congress for very sym
pathetic consideration the problem of
providing adequate facilities for the
care and treatment of former mem
bers of the military and naval forces
who are sick or disabled ns the re
sult of their participation in the
war. These heroic men can never
be paid In money for the service they
liatiietlciilly rendered the nation.
Tlielr reward will lie rather in real
ization of tlie fact that they vindi
cated the rights of their country and
Hided in Mitegiiardltig civilization.
The nation's gratitude must be
effectively revenled te them by the
most ample prevision for their medi
cal care and treatment as well ns for
their vocational training department
nnd placement. The time hns come
when u mere complete program can
be formulated nnd mere satisfactorily
administered for their treatment and
training, nnd I earnestly urge thnt
the Congress give the matter its early
consideration. Th" secretary of the
treasury and the beard for vocational
education will outline in their annual
reports proposals covering medical
care and rehabilitation which I nm
sure will engnge your earnest study
and command your most generous
support.
Termlt me te emphasize mice mere
the need for action upon certain mat
ters upon which I dwelt nt some
length In my message te the second
session of the sixty-sixth Cengress:
The necessity, for example, of en
couraging the manufacture of dye
stuffs nnd related chemicals; the im
portance of doing everj thing possible
te promote ngriculturnl production
along economic lins, te improve ag
ricultural marketing nnd te mske
rural life mere attractive nnd health
lul : the need for a law regulating
cold storage in such a way as te
limit the time during which goods
may be kept in storage, preserving
the method of disnesing of them if
kept beyond the permitted period, and
requiring goods released from stor
age in till cases te hear the date of
their receipt.
It would also be most serviceable
if it were provided thnt all goods re
leased from cold storage for interstate
shipment should have plainly marked
upon each purkage the selling or mar
ket price at which they went Inte
hterase. In order that the purchaser
might he able te le.nn what 'profits
steed between him and the producer
or the vvholesale dealer.
Indeed, It would be very service
able te the public if all goods destined
for Interstate commerce were made
te carry upon every packing case
whose form made It possible a plain
statement of the prhe nt which they
left the hands of the producer. I
respectfully call eiir uttentieu, also,
te thn recommendations of the mes
sage referred te with regard te a fed
eral llcensn for all corporations en
gaged in interstate commerce.
In hi lef, the immediate legislative
need of the time is the removal of
all obstacles te the realization of the
best ambitions of our people in their
several classes of employment nnd the
strengthening of nil Instrumentalities
by which difficulties are te be met
and removed mid justice denlt out,
whether h law or by some form of
mediation ami conciliation. I de
net feel it te be my privilege at pres
ent te suggest the detailed and par
ticular methods by which these ob
jects limy he attained, but I have
faith that the inquiries of your sev
eral committees will discover the way
nnd the method.
Ijo.'iii te Armenia Urged
In response te what I believe te be
the impulse of sympathy and opinion
throughout the I'nlted States, I earn
estly suggest that the Cengrcm use
the treasury of the I'nlted States te
make te the btruggling government of
Armenia such i Jean as was iiiuile te
several of the allied governments dur
ing tlii war; nnd I would also sug
gest thnv It would be desirnble te pie
vide In the legislation itself that tlie
expenditure of the money thus leacied
should be under the supervision of n
commission, or at least n commis
sioner, from tlie United State in
order thut revolutionary tendencies
within Armeniu itself might net be
nfferded by the lean a further tempt
ing opportunity.

WILSON'S MESSAGE
PERSONAL DOCUMENT
s
Ry CLINTON W. GILRKRT
CepvrigM, 1120, by 1'ubitc Lcilecr Ce.
Washington, Dec. 7. President Wll
son's last annual message te Congress Is
n highly peiseiial document. It ends
with u declaration that it is confes
sion of faith, rather than u formal mes
nigc. Mr. Wilsen writes :
"I have net se much luid before jeu
u series of iccommcndatieus, gentlemen,
ns sought te utter a confession of faith,
of the faith in which I was bred und
which it Is my solemn purpose
purpose te stand
by until my last lighting eny. I lit
... . ... - ..
llevc this te be the faith of America,
the faith of the future, and of nil the
victories which awuit national action
In the days te come, whether in Ameri
ca or elsewhere."
Written in this personal vein, the
last utterance of that personal govern
ment which the voters have nt least
for this once rejected, the message bears
every mark of the intention the Presi
dent cherished up te the inst memeut
of delivering it in person te Congress,
us he delivered all his messages up till
the time when sickuesis overtook him,
mere than a year iig,). Se persistent
wns the President in this desire, that
up till this morning the White Heuse
was net sure that he would net go te
the Capitel In spite of the advice of
physicians nnd friends.
Yields te Physician's Advice
The President in tlie end yielded te
the advice of Admiral (iraybeu, but
Secretary Tumulty was se much in
doubt ns te his intentions that he

mMvmkrmm;&K Tuesday,
mnlly te go te the Capitel if necessary.
It Is n part of the tragedy of the
President's final service In office thnt
he should cling obstinately te the idea
nf personally addressing the American
people nnd thnt the state of his health
should rob him of tin opportunity of
delivering himself what Is te all intents
and purposes his farewell address.
The message Is bare of recommenda
tions except rnther perfunctory sug
gestions of measures, most of which
Congress will net have time te consider
in the few months that remain until
Mnrch !, The President addresses deaf
ears as a President always does who Is
in the linnl months of his service, anil
who sneaks te n Congress which has
gene ever te the opposition. And the
President knows he Is writing te u body
which is waiting for the coming of th'
new administration.
Silent en Treaty
On tlie subject which Is uenrest te his
heart the treaty and the league of
Nations, Mr. Wilsen says nothing, and
he Is keeninc his tilnns se much te him
self since the issue arose as te whether
he should go te the Capitel or net that
no one- knows with certainty what his
plans with respect te the treaty are.
l'Vem the fnct that he left out all refer
ence, even indirect, te the situation
created by the failure of the treaty, It
is assumed thnt he will later address
u special message te the Senate nnd
send the treaty back te it for consider censider
nilnn. Ills friends exnect him te fel
low this course. When he does this lie
may again insist upon personally ap
pearing ut the Capitel.
Thn i-wnmniendntlens which the Pres
ident does make touch chiefly the budget.
the need of economy and in general me
reconstruction problems which the war
has left In its wake.
Budget Rill law Forecast
President-elect Harding's plea te the
Semite vesterday te co-operate with the
t-' nilmlnlnrrntlnn may result
the passage of the budget bill law. The
fate of this measure in the short ses
sion is in doubt. The Republican at
one time planned te put the measure
through, but lately they have been in
clined te stand their ground and refuse
te modify the bill te meet the Presi
dent's constitutional objections raised
in n veto message Inst yenr. Mr. Hard-
lint is said te regard tne issue uui

fer radically from thnt which thti Hard
ing administration is likely te fellow.
This issue will net arise In what re
mnins of Mr Wilsen's term. The
President recommends that the. govern

within the next two and ene-hnlf years.
Ti.n t,.tnl nt this debt seen iiutturinc is

The Republican plnn is te refund most

pint of this debt out of Income meuns

llltclv te heed Mr. Wilsen's declaration
thnt' sound finance requires this, course.
It is the only sharp party issue out
lined in the message. There cannot be
much difference of opinion about caring
for the disabled soldiers or protecting
the new industries which sprang up
during the war or encouraging agricul

Reper Opens Attack
In opening his attack en the Munici
pal Court jobs. Councilman Reper de
clared he made n comparison with the
Municipal Court of Chicago.
"That court," he said, ''was the basis
en which the Muuiclpnl Court iu Phila
delphia was established, and both courts
arc conducted along somewhat similar
Hues. The 1010 report of Chicago
shows that there are thirty judges In
that court. The total cost of these
judges nnd the probation officers neces
sary te operate the court business Is
about $303,725. Here In Philadelphia
our probation officers alone cost nearly
$484,000 aud with thn nine Judges the
amount Is about $5.10,820,
"In Chicago the number of cases
handled in the civil and municipal
branches of the Municipal Court are
ten times the number handled In the
Municipal Court here. Reth Mr. Deve
