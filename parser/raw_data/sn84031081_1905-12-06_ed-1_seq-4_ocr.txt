RooseVelt on Statehood
e
T"TT LTHOUGI√ç the prpxidciit In his rnoexaRp dop not devote much apare
pfel to the matter of statehood for the territories he covers the ground
J II very completely, and states hi position no plainly rnd positively that
It will be impossible for the most Ingenious opponent of statehood in
either Arizona or New Mexico to inject any wrong meaning into his words. He
ays. "I recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma be admitted as one
flute, and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted uh one state. There is no
Obligation upon us to treat territorial sub-divisions, which are matters of con
venience only, as binding us on the question of ndmin.lon to statehood. Noth
ing has taken up more time In the congress during the past few years than
the question tt to the statehood to be granted to the four territories above
mentioned, and after careful consideration of all that has been developed in
the discussions of the question I recommend that they be Immediately a.l
mited aB two Mates. There Is no justification for further delay, and THE AD
VISABILITY OK MAKING THK Toril TERRITORIES INTO TWO STATE.
HAS BEEN CLEARLY ESTABLISHED."
It would be impossible to frame In English words a clearer or more posi
tive statement of fact than the president has made In the above paragraph. H
Is very brief, but it Is directly to the point, and he could not have expressed
what he meant any clearer If he had taken a column In which to say it. And
furthermore he has expressed the settled conviction of the people of the
United States, and also the desire of the people of the territories themselves,
excepting, of course, the jde counter brigade. The impression existing In cer
tain quarters that the people of the two territories are opposed to being united
In statehood Is without any valid foundation. That certain big mining com
panies and other great corporations ate opposed to Joint statehood, or to state
hood in any form. Is true. They want conditins to remain as they are, be
cause they can manage the legislatures and other territorial officials so as to
escape their proper share of the burden of government in many ways which
they could not hope for under statehood, with such a constitution as we are
likely to have. And those are the influences that have been making all tie?
noise ill opposition to Joint statehood. With them It Is a matter of money
ami no small amount of money to keep things Just as they Hr,.t mn hence
they can afford to spend inon-y liberally for special railwav trains, coligrrs
iionul Junkets and newspaper stories, to fool the public, and cause persons In
other parts of the countiy to believe that tin? people of the two territories are
practically unanimous in their opposition to Jointure, whereas Just the re
verse of that Is true, and when the milter comi-s to he settled j 1 1 the ballot
box an overwhelming majority ot the votes ast will be in favor of Joint state
bond. It Is a clear case of t If coi pora t ions against the plain people, of money
against manhood. The corporations make the noise because they have the
money, but the people will make Hie state, because they have the votes.
Undoubtedly the president is a ware of these facts. The language of bis
message shows it. And heme he says, after a careful consideration of all
that lias been developed in the long discussion of the subject, he is convinced
that l.'i" aois ability of making one slate of the two territories lias been
ilearly established, an. I that there is no justification for further delay in their
udtnlssion.
The talk of the antl-Miit-h I people about forcing jointure upon the
territories against the will of the people" is simply nonsense. All that con
gress can do is to give Hi- people a chance to vote upon the question of wheth
er they will come in or stay out. The passage of an enabling act will simply
enable" the two territories to become a state if their people so desire. And
the fad that the opponents of statehood are moving heaven ami earth to pre
vent the passage of such a bill shows beyond any shadow of doubt that they
are coinlnced the people will accept Joint statehood if congress w ill give them
a chance to vote on It. Tln-y dare not trust the people.
Easy Step for Little Foot.

"There may be some grafting In
New Mexico at this time, although
there Is no proof that this is so, but
even were there, there could be but
very little of it because there is so lit
tle to graft." The Almanac.
And the Almanac knows.

While piling up crimes, real and Im
aginary, against Colonel Frost, It
should not be forgotten that he is by
no means dull or plow In shaping sail

ord. The Almanac will have to draw a
diagram to make the dear public un
derstand how it happened to forget to
print the Governor's Message in Span
ish. And. Just think, there is SO little
to graft in New Mexico!
What with the Japanese-American,
the Irish-American, the German-American
and the Afro-American, the
American-American is as hard to find
us the proverbial needle in the hay
stack. The Almanac notes a recent meeting
In Santa Fe of the Society for the
Friendless. It does not state whether
any action was taken In Miguel's case.

made M. Quad famous must take a

Of Paramount Importance
jpy ONSIDERINO the matter of child labor in the Culled States, the prest
H dent, In his message, reviews existing conditions .it nunc length and
concludes with these words, which ought to be committed to mem
oty by every man in the country: "In such a ("public as ours the
one thing that we cannot afford to neglect is the problem ot turning out de
cent citizen. The future of the nation depends upon the citizenship of the
generations to come; the children of today are those who tomorrow will shape
the destiny of our laud, and we cannot afford to neglect them." Following
this, he takes up th question of "Women in Industry." which. 'as a sociologi
cal problem is almost equal In Imp√≥rtame to that of child labor. Cpon this
he says: "Over the million Amerban women are now engaged In gainful oc
cupations, yet there Is all almost complete dearth of data upon which to has"
action looking toward state munli ip.il legislation for the protection of
Working women. The introdin Hon of women into Industry is working change
and disturbance in the domestic ami social life of the nation. The decrease in
marriage, and especially In the birth rale, has been coincident with it. We
must face accomplished facts, and lh adjustment to factory conditions must
be made; but surely It can be made with less friction ami b-s harmful efTecis
on family life th in is now the ( ,im This whole mutter In reality forms one
of the greatest soclologi. al jh-iiiiieti.i of our time; U Is a social uestlon of
the llrst Importance, of far greater Importance than any merely political or
economic question can be; and to solve it we need amide data, gathered In a
sane and scientific spirit lu the course of an exhaustivo Investigation."
A Model for 1'iirmors
Wherever there Is a bit of boggy
land or swampy ground the French
firmer goes to work and fills it up and
plants trees on it. Row after row of
green, thrifty trees could tie seen (
ciipving the place that was once a
re king swamp or reeking hog. In
stead of wet, moulding earth there is
green gr.is- and cool shade. Instead
of foul, sickening odors, there is pure,
life-giving air.
Clean yards, sanitary surroundings
pure air, these make the French far
mer's home a healthful home. No
1 hance for malaria, tvnhoid or other
endemic diseases.
The farm homes in France are
models that the American farmer
would do well to Imitate. Dank, moss
coveted well, dirty hack yards, un
drained cessnools. barnyards filled
with old dump heaps and strewn with
litter, fence corners overgrown with
tall, rank weeds, swam is teeming with
insects, the stench of decaying vegeta
tion polluting the air these are not
uncommon things to be found In the
farming districts of America. And to
Just such surroundings oh these can
he traced many a sickness, in the far
mer's family. Darkness and dirt and
dampness are disease breeders of the
most proline kind. Catarrh and ma
laria, rheumatism ami typhoid, are
rampant in such surrounding-'.
If the farmer would set to work and
clean up and make sanitary his sur
roundings there would be less sick
ness In his family and fewer doctor
bills to pa v. Dirt and disease go hand
hand, while cleanliness and health are
Inseparable companions.
The farm home should he the
he althiest in the world. In the clear,
open spaces of the country there is
a chance for an abundance of fresh
air and sunshine, pure water and
wholesome food, and the farmer
should see to It that nothing Is allow
ed to pollute these natural sources of
health and life. Mr. S. H. Harlman.
