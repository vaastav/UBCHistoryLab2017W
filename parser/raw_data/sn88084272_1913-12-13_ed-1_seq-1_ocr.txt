Americans Said To Be Ready To Flee To the Border Also Villa Declared To Have
Told All Foreigners That It Is Best To Get Out, as He May Not Be .
Abh To Control His Soldiers Spaniards Stripped of Every
' '' thing They Have By Rebel' Leader.
FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-EIGHT Spanish refugees arrived at the border Saturday morning on a
special train from Chihuahua, after having been given 1 0 days by Pancho Villa in which to leave the republic
All their stores and factories had been confiscated by order of the rebels, and the stocks sold for whatever they
would bring, the Spanish refugees reported.
The German colony was expected to follow the Spanish refugees to the border as soon as they could get a train,
the leaders of the Castilian refugee party declared. Americans were planning to follow also.
Neither Germans nor Americans have been ordered or warned to leave, the Spaniards say, but they are preparing
to leave because conditions are not considered safe in Chihuahua city. Not a foreigner will be left in the Chihuahua
state capital by the end of next week, the Spaniards predict.
VILLA INSPECTS TRAIN.
Federico Moye, acting governor ad interim pending the arrival of Pancho Villa's force, accompanied the train
as the representatives of the foreign consuls, and was in charge of the convoy. American consul Marion Letcher also
sent a representative on the train. Villa was at the train in person when it left Chihuahua Friday morning, and made
a trip through the eight coaches to see who was on board.
Some of the refugees declare that Villa has not only ordered the Spaniards to leave on pain of death, but that
Thursday he called all foreigners into consultation and told them that, while he expected to give what protection he
could to all foreigners except the Spaniards, he had many unruly men that he might not be able to control and that he
would advise "all foreigners to leave. If this is true, Americans on the border declare that nothing short of a condition
of anarch' can be recognized as existing in the state capital.
Federico Moye, who was governor ad interim, between the time the federals abandoned the city and the rebels
took it, says Villa has guaranteed protection to all foreigners except the Spaniards, and that he has not warned others
to leave.
Pretest To President "Wilson. a
Apersoaal message has been sent to
president Wilson characterizing the en
forced exik as "the barbarous act of
savages," and strong follow-up cable
grams hare been sent to the Spanish
foreign office and also to king Alfonso,
of Spain. The Spanish refugees declare
that Villa told thqm at the train that
he would "shoot-them down like dogs"
if they did not leave the country. He
also told them, that he did not Trent
Mexico ruled by Spain. Insults -were
offered the Spaniards on the streets of
Chihuahua, but no violence wtj done and
none was arrested, they said. The total
value of the Spanish holdings in Chihua
hua is estimated by the refugees at $20,
000.000 Mexican money and the loss -will
Msount to not less ttan $10jmjm, I
Mexican money, the refugees declare.
El Pasoans Aid Refugees.
The business men and chamber of
commerce of Bl Paso are assisting in car
ing for the refugee colony while they
are in El Paso. The Spanish bankers,
and. -wholesale and retail merchants were
met at the bridge by leading business
men and bankers of El Paso and every
thing was done to expedite the learing
of the Spanish refugees through the port.
p. "Vv". Berkshire, in charge of the immi
gration department on the Mexican bor
der, was in personal charge of t&e in
spection work, and CoL Frederick Perkins
of the 20th infantry was also at the
bridge.
The Spanish refugee train left Chi
huahua, at ld:S5 Friday morning and
consisted of eight cars. This train had
heen arranged for by the foreign con
suls, led by American consul Marion
Letcher who sent a clerk nmed Iester
with the party as a personal represen
tative of the American consulate.
Spectacle in Juares Interesting.
The train arrived in Juarez shortly
before seven o'clock Saturday morning
and the scene which followed at the
international bridge was an Interesting
sidelight on revolutionary Mexico. Car
riages, wagons and automobiles "were
lined aldng the Mexican end of the
bridge, and the bridge approaches
around the immigration station on the
United States side were crovded witn
the refutree Spaniards, their wives and
children. They carried all the posses- J
slons they could bring irom uninuanua,
one man having a brand new wooden
leg which he had never -vorn but which
he carried under his arm.
Bales of steamer rugs, blankets,
capes and overcoats were piled high
in front of the immigration station and
bat boxes were stacked on top of great
piles of the odd shaped European hand
satchels which most of the refugees
carried. .
Inspection on 17. 3. Soil.
As the crowd of refugees arrived
before office hours at the immigration
station, they had to be detained until
the medical inspectors and immigration
inspectors could arrive. A detail of
the .20th Infantry, which is stationed at
the bridge, kept the crowd back trow
the bridge approaches and patrolman
Frank Capllnger was sent from the
I dice station to assist in handling the
crowd. As soon as F. W. Berkshire,
the immigration chief, and Dr. John W.
Tappan, the immigration doctor, ar
ried at the bridge station, the in
spection started.
I4ke Mlnatnre Ellis Island.
The Spanish refugees, including 85
women, 72 children and 40 small babies,
were hnddled In the detention room of
the station while the examiners stood
at the head of a long line and took
the names and passed the immigrants
en to the medical examiners. As fast
iis they cleared the port, the refugees
leaded their few belongings into wag
ons, automobiles and carriages and
drove downtown, where they are being
cared for by their friends in the city.

TWO COUNTIES ARE ENTIRELY' UNDER WATER
A CTUALL Y S TAR VING
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 13. The revenue cutter Windom is being rushed
to Velasco, the town nearest the inundated section in Texas. Harry A.
Black, chairman of the Galveston relief committee, today telegraphed
secretary McAdoo that two counties are almost entirely under water. He wired:
"Since the breaking of levees, the Colorado and Brazos rivers have joined
forming one sheet of water over 40 miles wide. Galveston relief committee is
sending lifeboats with blankets and food supplies under command of Capt. C. W.
Corbel, of TJ S life saving service, to rescue hundreds who are actually starving
and dying of exposure."
The Windom may act as supply base for life saving crews at Velasco.

what will be the outcome of affairs in
Mexico. They say that if peace Is re
stored in Mexico, they will return -and
if the revolution continues, those who
can afford it will go back to their
native homes in Spain. Although all
of the refugees are well dressed busi
ness and professional men, few of them
had much money with them, as they
were unable to get any from the banks
before they left.
Had Diamond; o Brenkfaat Money
One man had a big diamond in his
tie that was worth several hundred
dollars but was forced to borrow money
for breakfast from one of his more
fortunate companions.
Eduardo Angotla, manager of the
Banco National, assisted them in find
ing temporary homes and In getting
through the port. Bonito Martinez,
manager of the big La Pax clothing
factory, was another prominent mem
ber of the refugee party. One of the
refugees said that he had been in bus
iness in Mexico for 47 years and others
in the party had been there for 25
years.
Villa Fears Spanish Rule.
The refugees say that the order to
leave the country was received the day
following Villa's entry Into the city.
They say that the foreign consuls in
terceded in their behalf but Villa In
sisted that he could give no guarantee
to the Sptnish subjects and that they
had better leave, as he did not want
Spain governing Mexico. The refugees
say that 20 Americans came to the
train when they left and told the flee
ing refugees that they expected to
leave Chihuahua soon and that the
German colony would follow the
Spanish to the border. The Spanish
refugees predicted that there -would
not be a foreigner left in Chihuahua

Believe Homes Will Be Sacked.
The Spanish merchants reported that
everything had been taken from their
stores by the rebels and that they ex
pected their private residences to be
raided and sacked as soon as they left
for the border. The poods taken from
the stores were either distribute!
among the rebel soldiers or sold for
whatever they would bring in the city.
Villa Separates Families.
Villa passed through the refugee
train before it left the station in Chi
huahua, the Spaniards say, and with his
hand on his sixshooter, ordered all na
tive Mexican women to leave the train,
as he would not permit them to accom
pany their husbands to the border. One
family showed their tickets to Villa,
but he insisted that no Mexican women
could accompany the Spaniards and a
number were forced to leave the train
before it pulled out of the station,' the
refugees say. However, a number of
native women did accompany the train
to the border.
Priests and Nuns Forced to Leave.
Nine Spanish Paullst priests and nine
Sister of Charity were also forced to
leave Chihuahua and were passengers
on the refugee train. They are being
cared for by the local Catholic congre
gations. The sisters wore their robes
when they arrived.
Federal Troops Arrive.
The federal soldiers who were left
In Chihuahua by Gen. Mercado to pre
serve order until Villa arrived, also
came up on the train and will either
be sent to the federal command at OJI
naga in 'transit through the United
States, or will be permitted to cross tc
the American side and will go to work
on the railroads. These soldiers were
of the Sixth regiment of federals and
were guaranteed protection by the for
eign consuls in order that peace might
be maintained In the city until Villa
arrived. They were not in uniform, but
wore the typical peon costume -with
straw hats and blankets over their
shoulders. They were detained at the
bridge Saturday morning until it had
been decided what would be done about
their passing through this country.
Many Executions Reported.
Reports of many executions in Chi
huahua were brought here by the mem
bers of the Spanish colony. One prom
inent member of the colony sai.d- that

Arrest of Terrains.
Luis Terrazas, jr., was arrested at the
British consulate in Chihuahua last
Tuesday, but the consulate was not vio
lated by the rebel soldiers, the Spanish
refugees from Chihuahua declared upon
their arrival here. They say that after
a search was made for young Terrazas
he was located at the British consul
ate and a detachment sent there for
him. No violence was used, the refu
gees say, and Terrazas was not taken
td the penitentiary, but to the govern
or's palace, where he is being, held for
a ransom, the reported amount of
which varies from S260.000 to 13,600.
000, Mexican currency. The Spaniards
say that no attempt was made on the
life of Terrazas, although he was
threatened with execution if he or his
wealthy father did not pay the ransom.
Rebels Get a Scare.
A federal scare caused a rebel troop
train to be sent south from Chihuahua
Friday morning, the refugees say. It
was reported In Chihuahua that Orozco
and Caraveo were at Santa Rosalia,
advancing towards Chihuahua. A troop
train was hurriedly made up and sent
south. The Spaniards also say that it
is generally believed in Chihuahua that
Torreon has been retaken by the fed
erals, as the rebels practically aban
doned the town to come north for the
campaign against Mercado.
Confirm Executions.
The Spaniards confirm the execution
of Manuel Aldana, who was with the
Orozco troops during the Orozco revo
lution. He was executed because he
had Joined the federals,- the Spanish
say. Guadalupe Gardea. who was with
Villa in the Madero revolution, was
also executed by Villa, after he en
tered Chihuahua. A 15 year old son
of Jefe politico Arellano, of Chihuahua,
was also arrested by Villa's troops,
they say. The Spanish refugees say
that the.federals executed no prisoners
at the penitentiary before they left for
Oiinaga. At least nothing was known
of the executions if they occurred, they
say.
Theft of "Mona Lisa"
Italians Vengeance
For Napoleons Raids
Florence, Italy, Dec 13. The authen
ticity of the "Mona Lisa" found yester
day in possession of Vincenzo Perugia
was confirmed by experts after further
examination today.
The picture bears the seals of the
Louvre and other galleries in which it
has been hung, while the traces of re
pairs at the back of the canvas,
known to have been made, are visible.
The prisoner was again questioned by
the police authorities this morning. He
repeated his story of having stolen the
picture as an act of patriotic vengeance
for Napoleon's depredations In Italy.
PRESIDIO, Texas, Dec. 13. Rebel forces are closing in on Ojinaga today, according io reports reaching Here
from the border. Gen. Mercado's column has not yet appeared in the Mexican town and rumors are that he has
been cut off by Herrera's cavalry outside La Mula Pass.
Preparations for defence continue at Ojinaga and the prospect for a battle within 24 hours is good.
Two troops of U. S. cavalry reached Ojinaga late Friday night from a scouting expedition down the river. No
trace of Mercado's force was found.
Few refugees are crossing the line. It is said that they are being detained by Orozco's and Salazar's forces.
The 4000 federals garrisoned here, after their retreat fiom Chihuahua, have resigned themselves to the idea of an
attack. The rebels, under Gen. Herrera, have announced their intention of attacking from three sides to force the sur
render, or to drive the enemy across the river into the United States.
FEDERALS WELL FORTIFIED,
Perched on the high hill of Ojinaga, which commands a sweeping view of the nearby desert and canyons, the fed
eral army today had its guns trained in anticipation of an attack by rebels said to number between 4000 and 5000, who
are rapidly surrounding the town.
The commanding position of the hills, with trenches and forts prepared for resistance, will make it impossible for
the rebels to storm the place without a great loss of life. Such an attack would mean that the rebels would be con
stantly exposed to a heavy fire while climbing the precipitous approaches, except for the slight shelter afforded by the
thick mesquite bushes.
FIGHT AT
United States AdmiraT'Or
ders Both Sides to Cease
Firing in City.
. BRITISH ATYfVTTRAT,
MAKES THE REPORT
M
EXICO CITx". Mex, Dec 13.
Threatening to fire on the fed
eral and rebels alike from the
gunboat Wheeling, rear admiral Fletcher,
commander of the American- naval
forces in Mexico waters, stopped the
battle at Tampico yesterday. Both
sides complied with the admiral's order
to cease firing.
This Information was telegraphed to
the capital by rear admiral Craddock,
of the British cruJser Berwick, to sir
Lionel Carden, the British minister. No
confirmation from other sources has
been obtained.
The federals are said to hold the cen
ter of Tampico and the waterfront.
Rebels Capture Railroad Yards.
The rebels have captured the railroad
yards and all the cars and engines.
Trains have been dispatched westward
with men to repair the line and bring
back reinforcements for a general at
tack. Apparently the rebels are In a
position of great advantage.
Xoncombatnnts Endangered.
Occasional shells fell in the heart of
the city of Tampico and bullets from
rifles and machine guns were numerous
enough to make It advisable that resi
dents not engaged in the operations
seek cover.
For the most part the firing was lim
ited to the artillery of the rebels and
the guns on the Bravo.
Shells Endanger Oil Tanks.
The rebels held the area between
Tampico proper and the coast, including
Dona Cecilia and Arbel Grande, sub
urbs, where are located the storage oil
tanks of the "Waters-Pierce, the Cow
dray Interests and the Huasrea com
pany. The Waters-Pierce refinery is
at Arbel Grande. Lord Cowdray also
has a refinery there, but it is not yet
in operation.
According to reports received here,
the rebels have not damaged any prop
erty, but the firing, especially from
the Bravo, and some federal cannon
endangered the tanks and the refinery
or the waters-Pierce Oil company.
Federals Are Sheltered.
The federals have their position In
that part of the city behind a triangle
formed by the Panuco river, which Is
really the city's harbor, and the canal
running Into it between the city and
the coast. Just below the mouth of
the canal and above Dona Cecilia lies
the Bravo.
The rebels utilized a hill about 100
feet high in attempting to land shells
on the Bravo, which. In turn, tried to
render their positions untenable. To
the west or rear of the city the federals
have a defence in the Tanesi river,
which also flows Into the Panuco, a
stream not easily crossed.
Huerta etg More Troops.
Trains entering Tampico from the
west do so over a drawbridge, which
the federals are keeping open. No reb
els have yet appeared on that side
of the city. The track to this has been
repaired and two tralnloads of refugees
were taken out of the town yesterday.

Millions of Dollars' "Worth of Humanity Eepresented by
Sleeping Refugees at West Texas Town Friday Night.
United States Cavalry Eeaches Marfa to Rein-

MARFA, Tex Dec. 13. Millions of dollars' worth of humanity slept in the
unpretentious hotel here Friday night. Nearly a billion dollars was
represented in the party of Chihuahua refugees, including Gen. Luis Ter
razas, who reached Marfa yesterday afternoon from Ojinaga, and left here at
noon today for 1 Paso.
Among the rich refugees are Gen. Luis Terrazas, Luis Terrazas, his grandson;
Carlos Cuilty, Jorge Munoz, J. L. Terrazas, Fortunate Rivas, Teodulo Rivas, Saenz
Botello and Fernando Horcasitas.
The third squadron of the 15th cavalry reached here at 6:30 this morning from
El Paso to reinforce the border patrol. Maj. M. M. McNamee is in command and,
by rank) will take charge of the whole army patrol in this district. The squadron
went into camp here temporarily, but to be held in readiness to move to any
point on the frontier. "I will await developments at Ojinaga before sending any
mere troops there," said Maj. McNamee.
This afternoon, however, Maj. McNamee broke camp and started for Presidio
with his troopers, evidently having received disquieting news from Ojinaga.
A three ton auto truck was ordered sent to Marfa from El Paso today by army
officers here to be used in furnishing the United States troops at Presidio with
supplies.
commission this line, which extends to
San Luis Potosl, before the inaugura
tion of their attack, enabled the gov
ernment to materially strengthen the
garrison of Tampico. Three tralnloads
of troops were brought Into the town
from the west.
Gnnbont Delays Capture.
From the meager information avail
able here, it seems not unlikely that so
long as the Bravo has ammunition, the
federals will be able to delay the cap
ture of Tampico.
It is not believed probable here that
the S00 men reported by the war office
to have left Veracruz for Tampico
would be able to enter the town, as the
rebels hold the banks of the river from
the coast further in than Dona Cecilia.
The loss of life in the fighting at
Tampico probably has not been great.
DDD FLETCHER
