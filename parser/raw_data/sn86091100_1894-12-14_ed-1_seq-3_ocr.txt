Washington, Dec. 3.—The message of
President Cleveland to the members of
the second session of the Fifty-third
congress was read in the house by Clerk
Kerr and in the senate by Secretary
Cox. The reading began at 1:30 and con
sumed about two hours. Following is
the message In full:
Message to the congress of the United
States:
The assemblage within the nation's
legislative hall of those charged with
the duty of making laws for the benefit
of a generous and free people, impress
ively suggests the exacting obligation
and inexorable responsibility involved
in their task. At the threshold of such
labor now to be undertaken by the
congress of the United States and in the
discharge of an executive duty enjoined
by the constitution, I submit this com
munication, containing a brief state
ment of the constitution of our national
affairs and recommending such legisla
tion as seems to me necessary and ex
pedient.
The history of our recent dealings
with other nations, and our peaceful re
lations with them at this time, addi
tionally demonstrates the advantage of
consistently adhering to a firm but just
foreign policy, free from envious or am
bitious national schemes and character
ized by entire honesty and sincerity.
During the past year, pursuant to a
law of congress, commissioners were ap
pointed to the Antwerp Industrial Ex
position. Although the participation of
American exhibitors fell far short of
completely illustrating our national in
genuity and Industrial achievements,
yet it
brief time allowed for preparation.
I have endeavored to impress upon the
Belgian government the needlessness
and positive harmfulness of its restric
tions upon the importation of certain
of our products and have strongly urged
that the rigid supervision and inspec
tion under our laws are amply sufficient
to prevent the exportation from this
country of diseased cattle and unwhole
some meat.
ras still creditable, in view of the
BRAZILIAN MATTERS.
The termination of the civil war in
Brazil has been followed by general
prevalence of peace and order. It ap
pearing at an early stage of the insur
rection that its course would call for
unusual watchfulness on the part of
this government, our naval force in th«*
harbor of Rio de Janeiro was strength
ened. This precaution I am satisfied
tended to restrict the issue to a sim
ple trial of strength between the Bra
zilian government and the insurgents,
ami to avert complications which at
times seemed imminent. Our firm at
titude of neutrality was maintained to
the end. The insurgents received the
encouragement of an eventual asylum
from our commandera and such opposi
tion as they encountered was for tin*
protection of our commerce and was
clearly Justified by public law*.
A serious tension of relations hav
ing arisen at the close of the war be
tween Brazil and Portugal by reas.
of the escape of the insurgent Admiral
Da Gama and his followers, the friend
ly offices of our representatives to
these countries were exercised for the
protection of the subjects of either with
in th<* territory of the other.
Although the government of Brazil
duly notified that the commercial
arrangement existing between
United States and that country, based
on the third section of the* tariff act of
1890, waH abrogated
by the taking effect of the tariff law in
force, that government subsequently
notified the United States of its Inten
tion to terminate such an arrangement
on the first day of January, 1895, in the
exercise of the right reserved in the
agr«*emont between the two countries.
I invite attention to the correspondence
between the secretary of state and the
Brazilian minister on this subject.
The commission organized under the
convention which we had entered into
with Chile for the settlement of the out
standing claims of each government
against the other, adjourned at the end
of the period stipulated for its contin
uance, leaving undetermined a number
of American cases, which had been
duly presented. These claims are not
barred, and negotiations are in progress
for their submission to a tribunal the
17th of March next.

RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND JAPAN
Friendly Offices of Our Government to
Effect Peace.
The new treaty with China was signed
at Washington and on August 13 it
received the sanction of the senate.
Ratification on the part of China and a
formal exchange are awaited to give
effect to this mutually beneficial con
vention.
A gratifying recognition of the uni
form impartiality of tills country tow
ards all foreign states w
by the coincident request of the Chin
ese and Japanese governments that the
agents of the United States should,
within the proper limit, afford protec
tion to the subjects of the other, dur
ing the suspension of diplomatic rela
tions due to a state of war. This deli
cate office was accepted and a misap
prehension which gave rise to the belief
that in affording this kindly unofficial
protection our agents would exercise
the same authority which the with
drawn agents of the belligerents had ex
ercised was promptly corrected.
Although the war between China and
Japan indorses no policy of the Unit
ed States, it deserves our gravest con
sideration by reason of its disturbance
of our growing commercial Interests
in the two countries and the increased
«langers which may result to our citi
zens domiciled or sojourning in the in
terior of China. Acting under a stipula
tion in our treaty with Corea (the first
concluded with a western power), I
felt constrained at the beginning of the
controversy to tend« r our good offices
to induce an amicable arrangement of
the initial difficulty growing out of the
Japanese demands for administrative
reform in Corea, but the unhappy pre
cipitation of actual hostilities defeated
this kindly purpose. Deploring the
destructive war between the two most
powerful of the eastern nations and
anxious that our commercial interests
in tlie countries may be preserved an.'
that the safety of our citizens there
shall not be jeopardized. I would not
hesitate to heed any intimation that
our friendly aid for the honorable ter
manifested
|
mln&tlon of hostilities would be ac
ceptable to both belligerents.
EMBARGO ON MEATS
Acting upon the reported discovery of
Texas fever in cargoes of American im- I
portatlons of livestock and fresh meats
from
this country, the prohibition
against them has been revived. It is
hoped that Germany will soon become
convinced that th«j inhibition is as
needless as it is harmful to mutual in
terests.
The German government has excepted
against that provision of the customs
section of the tariff act w hich imposes
a discriminating duty of one-tenth of a
cent a pound on sugars coming from
countries paying an export bounty
thereon, claiming that the enaction of
such a duty is in contravention of Arti
cles 5 and 9 of the treaty of 1826 with
Prussia. In the interests of the com
merce of both countries, and to avoid
ven the accusation of treaty violation,
I recommend the repeal of so much of
the statute as imposes that duty, and
I invite attention to the accompanying
report of the secretary of state, contain
ing a discussion of the questions raised
by the German protests.

OTHER RELATIONS.
A convention has been finally con
cluded for the settlement by arbitra
tion of the prolonged dispute wdth Ec

against Emilio Santos, a naturalized
citizen of the United States.
Our relations with the republic of
France continue to be such as should
exist between nations so long bound
together by friendly sympathy and
similarity in their form of government.
The reent cruel assassination of the
president of this sister republic called
forth such universal expressions of sor
row and condolence from our people
and government as to leave no doubt
of the depth and sincerity of our attach
ment. The resolutions passed by the
senate and house of representatives

to the widow of President Carnot.

WITH MEXICO.
Good will, fostered by many interests
In common, has marked our relations
with our nearest southern neighbors.
Peace being restored along her north
frontier. Mexico has asked the pun
ishment of the late disturbers of her
tranquility. There ought to he a new
treaty of commerce and navigation
with that country to take the place of
the one which terminated thirteen
years ago. The friendliness of the in
tercourse between the two countries
Is attested by the fact that during this
long period the commerce «»f each has
steadily increased under the rule of
mutual consideration, neither being
stimulated by conventional arrange
ments or retarded by jealous rivalries
or selfish distrust.
An indemnity tendered by Mexico as
a gracious act for the murder in 1887
of Leon Baldwin, an American citizen,
by a band of marauders in Durango,
has been accepted and Is being paid in

Great Britain and Nicaragua, the form
er government recognized the sover
eignty of the latter over the si rip and a
limited form of self government was
guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians to
be exercised according to their custom
for themselves and other dwellers with
in Its limits. The so-called native gov
ernment, which grew to be largely
made up of aliens, for many years dis
puted the sovereignty of Nicaragua
over the strip and claimed the right to
maintain therein a practically inde
pendent municipal government. Early
in the past year the efforts of Nicaragua
to maintain sovereignty over the Mos
quito territory led to serious disturb
ances, culminating in the suppression
of the native government and the at
tempted substitution of an impractica
ble composite administration, in which
Nicaragua and the alien residents
were to participate. Failure was fol
lowed by an insurrection, which for a
time subverted Nicaragua's rule,
polling her officers, and restoring the
old organization. This In turn gave
place to the existing local government,
established and upheld by Nicaragua.
Although the alien interests arraigned
against Nicaragua in these transactions
have been largely American, and the
commerce of that region for some time
has been and still is chiefly controlled
by qur citizens, we cannot for that rea
son challenge the rightful sovereignty
of Nicaragua over this important part
of her domain. For some months be
fore and during part of the time two of
our naval ships have been stationed at
Blueflelds for the protection of all legit
imate interests of our citizens.
In September last the government at
Managua expelled from its territory 12
or more foreigners, including two Amer
icans, for alleged participation in the
seditious or revolutionary movements
against the republic at Blueflelds al
ready mentioned, but through the earn
est remonstrance of this government,
the Americans have been permitted to
return to the peaceful management of
their business. Our naval commanders
at the scene of these disturbances, by
their constant exhibition of firmness
and good judgment, contributed large
ly to the prevention of more serious con
sequences and to the restoration of quiet
and order.
I regret that in the midst of these oc
currences there happened a most grave
and irritating failure of Nicaragua jus

RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA.
The recent death of the czar of Rus
sia called forth appropriate expressions
of sorrow and sympathy on the part of
our government with his bereaved fa
ily and the Russian people. As a furth
er demonstration of reciprocal friend
ship our minister at St. Petersburg was
directed to represent our government
at the funeral ceremonies.
The sealing interests of Russia in
Bering sea are second only to our own.
A modus vivendi W'as therefore con

Occasion has been found to urge upon
the Russian government equality of
treatment for our great life insurance
companies, whose operations have be«»n
extended throughout Europe. Admit
ting, as we do, foreign corporations to
transact business in the United States,
we naturally expect no less tolerance
for our own interests in ample fields of
competition abroad.
But few r cases of interference with
naturalized citizens returning to Rus

The President Speaks of C.cntrulizing
Troops
From the report of the secretary of
war, It apears that the strength of the
army on September 30, 1894, was 2,135
officers and 25,765 enlisted men. Al
though this is apparently a very slight
1 decrease compared with the previous
year, the actual effective force has been
d to the equivalent of nearly
two regiments through the reorganiz
ation -.f the system of recruiting and
the consequent release to regimental
duty . f a large force of men hitherto
serving at the recruiting depots. The
abolition of those depots, it is predict
ed, will furthermore effect hii annual
reduction approximating $250.000 in the
direct expenditures, besides promoting
generally the health, morals and disci
pline of the troops.

The report of the attorney general
notes the gratifying progress made by
the supreme court in overcoming the
arrears of its business and reaching a
condition in which it will be able to
dispose of the cases as they arise with
out any unreasonable delay. This re
sult is, of course, very largely due to
the successful working of the plan Inau
gurating circuit courts of appeals. In
spect to these tribunals a suggestion is
made In quarters entitled to the highest
consideration that an additional circuit
Judge fov each circuit would greatly
strengthen these courts and the confi
dence reposed in their adjudications,
and that such an addition would not
create a greater force or Judges than
the Increasing business of such courts
requires.
re
I commend the suggestion to
the careful consideration of congress.
Other important topics are adverted
in the report accompanied by
recom
»ndations. many of which have been
treated at large in previous messages,
at this time, therefore, need only
be named. I refer to the abolition of the
fee system
an«
a measure of cotnpensa
I tion to federal officers; the enlargement
of the powers of United States cominls
j sinners, at least in the territories; the
j allowance of writs of error in criminal
cases on behalf of the United States,
; und the establishment of penalties by
j congress in the crime of murder,
A topic dealt with by the attorney
j general of much importance Is the con
1 dltlon of the administration of justice
in Indian territory. The permanent so
lution of what is called the Indian
! problem Is probably not to l>e expected
at once, but meanwhile, such amellora

Another subject of pressing moment
referred to by the attorney general

Tin* receipts of the department during

The

master general states that the latest
indications are so favorable that he con
fidently predicts an Increase of at least
eight per cent, in the revenues of the* '
current year over those of the last
year. The expenditures increase stead
ily and necessarily with the growth
and needs of the country, so that the
deficiency is greater or less in any
year depending upon the volume of re
ceipts.
THE MAIN REMEDY.
The postmaster general states that
this deficiency is unnecessary and might
be obviated at once if the law regulat
ing rates upon mail matter of the sec
ond class was modified. The rate re
ceived for the transmission of this sec-*
ond class matter is one cent per pound,
while the cost of such transmission to
the government is eight times that

created abuses the cost of which
amount in the aggregate to the total

of a trick upon both its rival
houses and the regular and legitimate
