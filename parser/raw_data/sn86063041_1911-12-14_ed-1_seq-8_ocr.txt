International Opium Cemmlaslon.
In a special message transmitted to the
congress on the seventh of January, 1911.
in whloh I concurred In the recommenda
tions mads by the secretary of stats In
regard to certain needful legislation for
the control of our Interstate and foreign
frame In opium and other m»naelng
drugs, I quoted from my annual mes
sage of December 7. 1909, In which I an
nounced that the reeults of the Interna
tional Opium commission held at Bhang
he* •" February, 1909, at the Invitation of
• he United States, had been iald before
this government: that the report of that
commission showed that China was maU
remarkable progress and admirable
efforts toward the eradication of the
ofilum evil; that the Interested gnvera
n 2*f'to bad not permitted their commer
cial tntereiata *n prevent their rn-npera
.V . *bla reform: and, as « result of
collateral Investigations of the opium
question In this country, I recommended
that the manufacture, sale and use of
opium In the United States should be
more rigorously controlled by legislation.
Prjcr 1" that lime and In continuation
of the policy of this government to se
ct| r* the co-oper.itlnn of the Interested
nations, the United States proposed an

States.
In my Inst annual message Î referred
to the tariff negotiations of the depart
ment of state with foreign countries In
connection with the application, by
nea of proclamations, of the mil
f the United States to Importa
tions from the several countries, and I
stated lhat. In Its general operation, tec
t!on 7. of the new tariff law had proved
a guaranty of continued commercial
peace, although there were, unfortunate
ly, Instances where foreign governments
dealt arbitrarily with American Interests
within their Jurisdiction In a manner In
jurious and Inequitable. During the past
discriminatory
treatment have been removed, but I re
gret to say that there remain a few
cases of differential treatment adverse to
the commerce of the United States. While
none of these Instances now appears to
amount to undue discrimination ln th«
sense of #c«t*on 2 of the tariff law of
August R 190ft. they are all exceptions to
hat complete decree of equality of tar
iff treatment fh#t the department of
state has confidently sought to obtain
for American oommerce abroad.
While the double tariff feature of the
tariff law of 1909 has been amply Justi
fied by the results achieved In removing
former and preventing new. undue dis
criminations against American commerce.
It Is believed that the time has come for
the amendment of this feature of the law
In such way ns to provide a graduated
means of meeting varying degrees of
discriminatory treatment of American
commerce In foreign countries as well as
to protect the financial Interests abroad
of American cltixsns against arbitrary
and injurious treatment on the part of
foreign governments through either leg
islative or admtnlatratlve measures.
It would seem desirable that the maxi
mum tariff of the United States should
embrace within Its purview the free list,
which Is not the case at the present time.

significance to the governments of those

The durbar, for which
preparations had been under way for

this camp Is about a quarter of a mil

The durbar proper took place In an
