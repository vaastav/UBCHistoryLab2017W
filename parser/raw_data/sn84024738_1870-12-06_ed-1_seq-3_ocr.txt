hh prominent and inlluential citizens of

??n Thursday last, under the following cir
<u(n.-taiifes:'A number of gentlemen, all men

animal also bit a number of other dogs, and I
made attempts to bite several children, but \
the latter fortunately escaped, Several of
the neighbors turned out with guns, when
it became known that a mad-dog was out,
and only killed him after pursuing him
several "miles and shooting him three or
four time-. The animal was a monster
specimen of his species, and the belief being
ueiieral that it was a well developed case of
hydrophobia, much alarm prevails in the
neighborhood for fear that other dogs may
be likewise affected, and fatal results follow

From "Washington. ? Members ot both
political parties do not openly attach any
great importance to the much-talked of coa
lition for organizing the new Congress in
March on the revenue reform basis. The
Democrats who are reelected very generally
declare that they will never vote for a lle
publican tor speaker, even if he is an ('out
and out " Free Trader. Western Repub
licans state that if Congress meets in March
they will be able to nominate in caucus and
elect a Speaker who will substantially be a
revenue reformer, without the aid of the
Democratic, vote, and that there is no Re
publican member who can be named now
who will trust himself in l he hands of the
proposed fusion.
The members who have arrived do not
think there will be much important legisla
tion this session. The Ways and Means
Committee arc goiiv: to work to reconcile
the contradictions and inconsistencies of the
internal revenue act pa-sed in July last. A
j bill to raise the whiskey tax to >1 a gallon,
I another t?? repeal the income tax alter '71,
j and one to amend the national banking sys
i tun, are already prepared. An entirely
j new Southern Pacific railroad bill, asking
lor the usual land grant, will be introduced
the second day of the session. The friends
of the measure propose to discard the one

but, fortunately, the pistol would not fire,

trated in the line of the Orleans entrenched

THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
Washington, Dec. 5.? One hundred and
seventy-three members of Congress an
swered to roll-call. Duke, of Virginia, was
seated after taking the old oath, as was Sy
pher, of the First Louisiana District.
The President, in his message, after con
gratulating the country on its peaceful con
dition and prosperity, regrets that the free
exercise of the elective franchise has, by
violence and intimidation, been denied to
certain citizens in the several States in the
several places lately in rebellion, and there
by reversing the verdict of the people.
"Referring to the European war, he speaks
of the satisfactory manner in which the
protection of the American Minister at
Paris was extended to German subjects in
Fraiice. Referring to the proclamation of
the Republic he says that snould the pre
sent struggle result in attaching the hearts
of the French to the simpler forms ol a re
publican government it will be the subject
of still further satisfaction to the American
people, who would not be indifferent to the
spread of American political ideas in a
great and highly civilized country like
France. He says, that if the opportunity
for interposing the good offices ot the United
States in restoring peace shall present itself,
the action will be promptly taken.
As to Cuba, the President says the con
dition of the insurrection has not materially
changed. He renews his recommendation
to annex San Domingo. He says as soon as
it is known that the project is abandoned
by the United States, negotiations will be
opened for the possession by some of the
.European Powers of the bay of Samana.
He urges early action on Congress, and
suggests that by a joint resolution of the
two Houses the Executive shall be au
thorized to appoint a commissioner to ne
gotiate with the authorities of San Domingo
for the acquisition of that island, and that
an appropriation be made to defray the ex
penses ot the commissioner. The qtiestion
might then be determined either by the
action of the Senate on the treaty or by
the action of both Houses on a resolution
of annexation, as in the case of Texas.
With regard to the Alabama claims he
recommends that Congress authorize the
appointment of commissioners to take
proof regarding them, and that authority
i be given ft>r their settlement by the United
States, so that the Government shall have
possession and ownership of the private
claims as well as of the responsible control
of all the demands against Great Britain,
t Regarding the fisheries and. the com
plaints of the Canadian authorities, he says
that they have uot been marked by a friend
ly feeling, and that if Great Britain should
attempt to force a certain act of the ''Do
minion" Parliament it will be the Presi
dent's duty to take such steps as may be
necessary to protect the interests of the
United States.
He asks that power be conferred upon
him to suspend the operation of the laws
authorizing the transit of merchandise in
bond through the United States to Canada,
and also to suspend the operations of any
law whereby vessels ot the "Dominion '
are permitted to enter the waters of the
United States. He also complains of the
pretensions of Canada to control the navi
gation of the St. Lawrence river, and urges
the importance and light of the United
States to navigate that river without let or
hindrance.
With regard to the depressed condition
of the foreign commerce of the United
States, he recommends a liberal policy to
wards the Pacific mail between California,
China, and Japan ; and also that measures
shall be taken to permit American mer
chants to buy vessels built abroad, as well
as encourage* American ship-building.
With regard to the currency, the Presi
dent says that the approach to the specie
basis is very gratifying, but the instability of
the currency is very prejudicial to the pros
perity of the country. He thinks the time has
arrived when, by wise and prudent legisla
tion, Congress should look to a policy whieli
would place the currency at par with gold
at no "distant day.
With regard to the revenue reform, he
says that if it means to keep the reveuue
down to what is necessary for the support
of the Government, and what is necessary
to pay the interest on the public debt, it has
his hearty support ; but if it means a fail
ure to provide the necessary means to de
fray all the expenses of the Government,
he "is opposed to it. The revenue reform
has not been defined by its advocates, it
seems, however, to be "accepted as some
thing that was to supply every man's wants
without cost or effort oh his part. [Laugh
ter.]
He recommends the abolition of the frank
ing privilege and reform in the civil service,
particularly as to the mode of appointing
subordinate officials.
After reading the message the Senate ad
journed.
Various routine business was transacted,
including the introduction of bills to con
stitute Sbreveport, La., and for the remo
val of disabilities of all citizens of Louisi
ana, and to abolish all income taxes.

active. Oats active, without any change in prices,
ihe market for wheat is quite active, and prices
are very Ann.
We made some remarks a few days ago on tlie
Inconvenience which commission merchants wero
subjected to, and the losses farmers incurred by
the sending of grain to market lu a damp or un
clean condition, and because of its being but tem
porarily sampled. There 1b another thing, too,
which subjects farmers to losses, and that is in
structing their commission merchants. The com
mission merchant Is alwaya on the spot. It is his
business to carefully watch the market. It is his
interest to get for Ills patron the h'ghest possible
price, and tUn*. he will do if he can ; but when he
ljtold, " You must not sell my produce under a
certalu price, he becomes hampered, iind In nine
cases out of ten the farmer is the loser. A farmer
ought not to engage the services of a commission
merchant unless he has confidence in him; but
once he employs him, then It is the commission
merchant who ought to instruct the farmer, and
not the farmer the commission merch int. Let us
give a notable cisc that came under our own per
sonal observation in this city some time ago : A
farmer sent to a commission merchant 2,500 pounds
of butter for sale, with instructions that hs must
not eeliltur.d. r a certain figure. The commis
sion merchant held out for the price, but couldn't
pet it. He wrote to the farmer, telling him that
outter was declining, aud that it would be better
to sell The farmer wrote tjhlm iu reply : " When
I want you to sell my butter I will let you know."
Butter kept going down ; the 2,i00 pounds became
rancid ; and, to make a long story short, it had
to be 60ld at a reduction of 20c. per pound on
what was offered for It when it first came to mar
ket. Hero was a dead loss of $500 under Instruc
tions.
