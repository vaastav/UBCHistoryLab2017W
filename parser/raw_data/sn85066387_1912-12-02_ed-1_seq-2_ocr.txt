Peace Is Predicted
the peace negotiations will be difficult
and protracted.
The question of holding an European
ambassadorial conference is undecided,
but the International situation is much
more peaceful. The Servian govern
ment denies the reported preparations
for a conflict with Austria, while the
Austrian press is much less bellicose.
Telegraphing from Sofia, the Daily
Mail's correspondent asserts that the
allies will demand from Turkey as a
war indemnity £48,000,000 ($240,000,
--000). The correspondent at Constanti
nople of the same paper says:
After the armistice 4 is signed an
Interval of a week will elapse for
the appointment of plenipoten
tiaries to negotiate peace. The
Bulgarians have shown consider
able conciliation in the last few
days.
They are beginning to realize
they are too exhausted ever to
break the Tchatalja lines. The
allies are beginning to dispute
among themselves, which is an ad
ditional reason for wishing to fin
ish the war quickly.
The terms of the armistice, accord
ing to the Constantinople correspond
ent of the Standard, provide that the
armies shall remain in their present
position and cease intrenching, rein
forcing or bringing up ammunition.
Adrianople and Scutari shall not be
evacuated, but their garrisons shall re
ceive rations daily sufficient for one
day.
Bulgaria, the correspondent adds, Is
willing that Adrianople shall remain
Turkish, providing Turkey will pay an
indemnity of 5250.000.000.
A Constantinople dispatch to the
Daily Telegraph quotes the Turkish
foreign "minister as saying that the
protocol of the armistice contains no
statement of general conditions of
peace, but merely provides for a mili
tary status quo.
The minister further declares that
Turkey is now in a position to nego
tiate favorable terms because Tchatalja
has been rendered impregnable.
In conclusion he said:
For the moment only two things
are in view—the signature of the
protocol of the armistice and the
immediate commencement of direct
communications with the delegates
of the Balkan coalition as to the
iditions of peace.
A Brindisi dispatch to the same pa
per says:
The rift between and
Greece is growing. There is no
partition treaty between the allies,
and Bulgaria is trying to magnify
the result of her victories, while
minimizing those of Servia and
Greece.
FERDINAND IS AMBITIOUS
Bulgaria is now claiming dispro
portionate aggrandizement in the
conquered territory. Ferdinand
wishes Bulgaria to bo as large as
<ireece and Servia combined, but
his anxiety to claim the lion's share
of spoils jeopardizes the successful
termination of the war. He kept
idle for 16 days 60,000 troops at
Saloniki. while his victorious
legions arrived before Tchatalja too
weak to face the lines.
Waking up rather late to the
danger, King Ferdinand asks
Greece to send transports for his
idle troops, with the double pur
pose of conjuring the danger he
• reated and enhancing Bulgaria's
share. Through a private repre
sentative in Constantinople he sug
gests to the grand vizier to ask
Bulgaria for an armistice, thereby
stopping the porte from prosecut
ing the negotiations opened with
Greece. •
The Greek and* Servian armies,
lost no time, though needing rest
badly. The Greeks, after taking
Saloniki, started for Monastir, the
two carrying on the war as true
allies. But Kervia's hands are tied
by a secret antl -Austrian treaty
with Bulgaria. Meantime the com
mon enemy, knowing that dissen
sions prevailed, is not to be found
tractahle. The command of the sea
by the Greek fleet prevents the
Turks even now from doing some
thing to lessen the sacrifices to
which they have to submit.
THOSE WHO WILL MOM
An official announcement confirms
the statement that the armistice proto
col will be signed "Monday or Tues
day."
Those who will attach their signa
tures are Nazim Pasha, war minister
nnd commander in chief of the Turkish
forces;- Rechad Pasha and Rlsa Pasha,
also representing Turkey; General
Savoff, generalissimo of the Bulgarian
army; Doctor Daneff, president of the
Bulgarian chamber of deputies, and
General Fltcheff, Bulgarian chief of
staff.
The armistice provides that fortified
Siaces may be provisioned and that
le eiege of Turkish ports and islands
is to be contemporarily considered as
raised.
In the event of a breakdown of the
peace negotiations the contracting par
ties must give 48 hours* notice before
resuming hostilities.
MEETING OF PEACE

CONSTANTINOPLE. Dec. I.— The

but there was no sign of the Bul

Presently the .approach of a train

ROBERT COLLEGE IS SPIED UPON
Taught Civic Liberty to the Balkan Students
Robert college, the famous American institution near Constantinople, and Rev. H. K. Sanborne, prominent pastor
of Oakland and former member of the college faculty, who gives account of its important influence upon the present
Balkan situation.
Turks Always Regarded
School as an Enemy
Of Their Country
OAKLAND, Dec. I.—When Christo
pher Robert, a wealthy merchant of
New York city, founded an American
college in Constantinople in 1863 he
endowed an institution which was to
have a most important part in mold
ing affairs in Turkey, according to Rev.
H. K. Sanborne of this city, former
member of the faculty, who believes
that the American ideals of civil and
religious liberty which are taught there
have been responsible largely for the
outbreak which recently occurred in the
Balkans.
Robert college was founded as a non
sectarian Christian institution which
was to be open to Turks and to the
Inhabitants of the surrounding prov
inces. Rev. Mr. Sanborne, now pastor of
Brooklyn Presbyterian church of this
city, was at the head of the depart
ment of mathematics- When seen at
his home, 1846 Tenth avenue, he said
he believed that the American teach
ings which the curriculum dwelt on
had been a most important factor in
leading the Bulgarians to revolt against
the Turkish yoke.
BLLGAR STUDENTS IV MAJORITY
"For many years the Bulgarians ha\;e
been more numerous as students and
graduates at Robert college than any
other nationality," said the clergyman.
"There were a large number of Ar
menians, Greeks and others, bnt the
Bulgarians nearly always have been In
the majority. As for Turks, we had
more than 130. A shot was fired from
the mosque, which was flying the
white flag; whereupon the Bulgarians
demolished the mosque with bombs and
burned and looted the Turkish quar
ter and massacred 500 persons. More
than 100 bodies were counted In the
streets, some of which were those of
Christians.
All Turkish shops were plundered,
the roughs of the town taking part in
the pillaging. The Greek bishop acted
with courage and sent a boat to Be
sika bay to request help. The foreign
warship sent several boats Into the
harbor at night carrying big lights to
make them look like warships. Dedea
ghatch was garrisoned only by irregu
lars.
The last train departing before the
Bulgarian arrival was stormed by fugi
tives. One of the engineers was bit
ten on the hands and legs by frenzied
\vomen who tried to climb Into the en
gine. The last train of all was cap
tured. I
TURKEY WOULD JOIN
BALKAN LEAGUE
PARIS, Dec. I.—The Constintihople
correspondent of the Temps gives,
under reserve, the main lines of a
peace scheme as outlined by Turkish
semiofficial sources.
According to this scheme Greece gets
Epirus, Servia gets Old Servia and
NovipaJfiax, and Bulgaria gets Thrace,
following the frontier from Mldia to
Dedeaghatcli or Kavalala, but exclud
ing Adrianople. which remains con

According to Information' In official
circles tonight, Sir Edward Grey's sug

members of the triple alliance, who de

very few when I was there and the
few"wo had we looked upon largely as
spies sent by the government to un
cover anything derogatory to the Turk
ish government which we might be
teaching.
"No Turk graduated from Robert
college in the first 25 years of its ex
istence, and I understand that very
few have graduated since. The Turks
feel an animosity toward the institu
tion and believe that it is a menace to
the sultan because it teaches the peo
ple of the outlying provinces their first
lessons in liberty as Americans know it.
"And in this, I think, they are justi
fied. Robert college has done much to
give the people who study there the
essence of religious and civic liberty,
and I am convinced that it has been an
important factor in shaping the plans
that have been forming for many
years In the minds of Bulgarians. I
know that the Bulgarians secretly have
planned for many years to strike when
the occasion offered, and thousands
considered it will be difficult to come
to an agreement, for It Is pointed out

AUSTRIA IS FIRM
REGARDING SERVIA
VIENNA, Dee\ I.—A majority of the
Vienna newspapers view the situation
more hopefully, chiefly on account of
the report that Russia has given assur
ances to Austria that she does not In

LOCOMOBILES
It is folly for a man who has a limited amount to spend for a car
and wants to get something good to think he does wisely to buy a
low-priced new automobile. Gears, shafts, axles and frames must
of necessity be of cheaper steel, more hastily finished and put to
gether; detail and refinement of both design and construction must
be sacrificed to price and quantity.
In a Rebuilt Locomobile you obtain thatjiigh quality of con
struction that can not be duplicated in a new lower grade car.
Same guarantee as given with new cars.

REBELLION NEVER TAUGHT
'•Robert college never taught rebel
lion nor did it at any time seek to in
flame the minds of the students against
the Turkish government." This was
what the spies of the government tried
to discover against us. Robert college
merely was founded as a Christian In
stitution in a Mohammedan land and
with the most beneficent and philan
thropic motives. The teachings always
have been along tfie broadest line in
every way, and rebellion is not taught,
directly or indirectly. •
"The keynote of the thing Is that the
college has given a glimpse of real lib
erty to a people who have had no ink
ling of such in all their lives. To this
extent it is responsible for the out
break in the Balkans."
The institution was founded with a
gift of $400,000 from Robert. It is sit
uated in Rumili Hissar, on the Bos
phorus, in the outskirts of the old city
of Constantinople. It is organized un
der the laws of the state of New York
and its officers live there. It has an
endowment of $250r040 and the grounds
consist of 15 acres. On the grounds
are three buildings, besides a gymna

as the unfinished business of the senate
from the preceding session, and even if
no action is taken will probably prove
interesting. By unanimous agreement
Senator Page's bill providing for co
operation between the states and fed
eral government to encourage instruc
tion in agriculture, the trades and in
dustry is to be taken up after the sin-*
gle term resolution Is out of the way.
Senator Kenyon's bill to prohibit the
shipment of intoxicating liquors Into
dry states is the subject of a special
order for December 17.
LITTLE HOPE FOR BILLS
In addition to these measures, the
bill to establish a department of labor,
which has already passed the house,
will be called up by Senator Borah.
The prediction is, however, that few
measures of consequence will pass.
Speaker Champ Clark and Repre
sentative Mann, the minority leader,
estimate the house will have only 26
legislative days which may be devoted
to the passage of appropriation bills.
Eliminating Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays, which are devoted to special
kinds of legislation under the houso
rules, there remains actually less than
one month for ttie consideration of
annual budgets, which will carry In the
aggregate $1,000,000,000.
Under the circumstances, members of
the house do not anticipate any general
legislation of importance will get
through during the short session.
Special rules are pending making priv
ileged the Adamson bill, providing for
the physical valuation of railroads and
also authorizing the government to in
vestigate the feasibility of acquiring
Monteclllo, now the property of Rep
resentative Jefferson Levy.
Representative Clayton, chairman of
the judiciary committee, wants a
special rule to take his resolution pro
viding for a six year term for the
president.
Outside of these three special meas
ures the indications are that the ses
sion of the house will be devoted en
tirely to appropriation bills and various
special measures now upon the routine
calendar.
While the house proper grinds away
at.the annual budgets, the ways and
means committee will begin its tariffi
hearings. Representative Underwood
plans to begin these early in January,
and they will continue probably into
the extra session.
Fifteen appropriation bills carry
more than $1,000,000,000 for the sup
port of the government.
Throughout the session will run the
preparatory work for the extra session
to be called soon after President elect
Wilson takes office. Committees will
thrash out questions of tariff, currency
and antitrust legislation.
It is assured, say legislative lead
ers, that there will be no tariff legis
lation this winter. Neither Is it ex
pected that the currency nor anti-trust
problems will receive much attention,
the principal work of the session be
ing confined to preparation for the
democratic administration.
LABOR BUREAU RUSHED
Important measures to receive atten
tion include the bill for a department
of labor, which Senator Borah said to
day would be pressed for immediate
action; the Sheppard-Kenyon bill, pre
venting shipments of all liquor into
"dry" states; the Page bill to give fed
eral aid to vocational and agricultural
schools and the resolution for a con
stitutional amendment limiting a presi
dent to a single term of six years. The
annual estimates for appropriations are
ready and will be sent to the house to
morrow noon.
President Taft's message will be
brought in Tuesday.
Chairman Fitzgerald of the house
appropriations committee had not
reached his office today, but a sub
committee has completed the first ap
propriation bill and It will be passed
on by the full committee tomorrow.
This measure carries appropriations for
salaries in the legislative, executive
and judicial branches of the govern
ment.
Committees have been at work on
other measures and a string of appro
priation bills will be poured into the
house during the next few weeks. Ac
tivity in the senate usually is limited
until the house has completed some of
the appropriation measures, but this
year the impeachment trial of Judge
Archbald will engross the senate from
the beginning of the session.

BALZAC LOVE TALE
IN FRENCH LIFE
Fanny Desprez Bequeaths
Fortune as Memorial to
Cavalry Officer
PARIS, Dec. I.—lt reads like Balzac
—like the tenderer Balzacr of "Eugenic
Grandet." Sixty-five years ago Mile.
Fanny Desprez, daughter of a notary
in a sleepy little town of France, fell
in love with a handsome cavalry offi
cer. Mile. Desprez was then !n her
teens. The toast of the countryside, all
the eligible young men of the town
were at her little feet. It was not
alone to the "beaux yeux" of her fa
ther's purse that they paid court, for
Mile. Fanny had fine eyes of her own.
The cavalry officer was dashing, as a
cavalry officer ought to be. He wore
his uniform with an air, and his sword
and his spurs clanked bravely. Alas!
They were all that he had to clank, and
M. Desprez, grasping and ambitious,
had ears open for another kind of
music.
NOT A DESIRABLE SON IN LAW
In brief, the young officer had not a
penny beyond his pay, and the notary
would have none* of him for son In law
No more than Eugenic Grandet did
Mile. Fanny think of denying her fa
ther's authority. These were not the
days of "fair ladles in revolt." Months
and years passed, and left M. Desprez
adamant. The dashing young officer
changed his garrison and forgot, per
haps. But he was not forgotten. OK
summer nights Mile. Desprez would
wander under the stars in the garden
so that the neighbors called her, half
In jest and half In pity. "La Belle
Etoile." A year ago she died, at the
age of 85, having never left the little
town in which she had loved and lost
and been faithful.
MEMORIAL TO HER SWEETHEART
When her will was read it was
found that she had left the whole of
her considerable fortune—almost $400.
--ooo—to the Friendly Association of
Ex-Pupils of the School of the Legion
of Honor, on condition that it should
offer as often as possible a dowry of
$20,000 to a former scholar chosen by
the governing body. But the favored
girl must, within three years of being
thus dowered, marry a cavalry officer
without fortune and a Catholic.
Alas! for the pestilent human nature
of expectant heirs! The surviving rel
atives of Mile. Desprez, distant cousins,
have announced their intentions of dis
puting the will. But, romantlo as she
was, Mile. Desprez was not for nothing
the daughter of a notary. It is prob
able that the courts will uphold the
provisions of the will, and so the
wealth which could not give its owner
happiness may bring to others their
hearts' desire.
