COOK COUNTY NORMAL SCHOOL.
The Board of Education, on Tuesday last,
adopted a resolution setting forth the great
abuse perpetrated in the name of education,
by tho Cook County Normal School, and,
inasmuch as the institution Is wholly useless
for any educational purpose, asking that the
County Commissioners bereqnested to abate
it. We think the action of the board is fully
justified by tbe facts. The whole scheme of
a county normal school has been a job from
the beginning. It was a real estate specula
tion on the one hand, and a pretext for pen
sioning a certain number of dead-beats on
the public treasury. No such institution was
ever needed. We have a State University
for the education of teachers, and we have,
in the city of Chicago, an institution of tho
same kind, which for excellence is not sur
passed by any normal school in the United
.States*. An idea of the comparative work
ings of the two institutions may bo obtained
from the fact that each graduate of the nor
mal school of Chicago costs the public from
S2O to $25, and each, one graduating at the
county school costs from SI,OOO to $1,500.
The annual salaries of the teachers of the
school are stated by the Board of Education
to he SIO,OOO. a sum sufficient to pay the en
tire expenses of the Chicago Normal School
for several years. It has heen impossible,
however, to get at a correct statement of the
whole expenses of the county establishment.
In the old Board of Sapervisors expendi
tures were made under the direction of com
mittees, and no detailed report’of the items
was ever made public. There is euough
Known, however, by certain persons who
have investigated the matter, to justify
them in saying that the total expenditure
for the institution ranges from $20,000 to
$30,000 a year. In addition to this must bo
added interest on §IOO,OOO expended on the
building,—the money having been raised on
7 per cent bonds sold at 02 cents, the interest
on which has heen paid for two years with
money borrowed at 10 per cent interest.
The institution has heen a fraud upon the
public because it was wholly unnecessary
from the beginning. It is precisely one of
those corrupt jobs to correct which the Board
of Coimtx Commissioners was established.
If the board find that this school is an annual
expense to the county of $20,000 to $25,000, in
addition to the interest on the cost of
the building, and that it is unnec
essary, or that the expenditure is wholly
disproportioned to the results, the school
should ho closed without unnecessary delay,
and the building devoted to some useful
purpose. There are at this time more first
class educated teachers unemployed than
would supply all the vacancies in half a
dozen counties the size of this county. There
is no scarcity of teachers. An advertisement
would bring hither twenty unemployed com
petent teachers for each one j;hat may bo
needed. The Comity Normal School maybe
closed for ten years, if nut indelinitely,
without having the remotest effect upon the
supply of competent teachers, cither for the
city, county, or State.
THE QUEEN AND THE PRINCE.
Many persons are ready to presage all sorts
of confusion, anarchy, and revolution to
England as a consequence of the death of
the Prince of Wales. In the absence of any
advices from England other than those an
-4 nouncing the expected demise of the Prince,
we are by no means disposed to anticipate
any disturbance whatever. On the contrary,
we apprehend that the event will lead rather
to a strengthening of the bonds between the
English people and their sovereign than to a
dissolution or weakening of these bonds.
There has been, it is true, a good deal of
clamor against royalty of late, but that is
nothing new in Great Britain. Other mon
archs have been railed at, other heirs-appa
rent have been denounced for their reputed
vices, and other revolutions have been
threatened; but it has always happened that
the storm of discontent has blown over, and
a calm and peaceful state of popular loyalty
ensued. More than once the death of the
heir-apparent, or other member of the royal
family, has been the quieting cause. It is al
together likelj’ to be so now. Victoria has
been throughout her reigu a
popular sovereign. She has been
mild and peaceful in her reign and
alive to tbo projects which her liberal
Ministers have laid before her for tho.eleva
tion of the condition of the masses, and the
emancipation of British institutions from
the traditions of darker ages. Perhaps no
monarch since the almost mythical King
Alfred can boast of having given the royal
assent to more reforms for the benefit of the
community than Queen Victoria. She has
been, moreover, a peace-making and peace
preserving monarch, and has keptthe nation
out of more than one costly and bloody
struggle.
It is doubtless to Victoria and her deceased
husband that both Great Britain and Amer
ica owe the avoidance of hostilities between
tbo two nations, growing out of
tbo Trent affair, in 1802. In
deed, the people of the United States have
to her, and not without reason, a
constantly friendly disposition toward this
country during the period of our civil war,
whatever that of the British aristocracy
and- the Liverpool ship-owners may have
been;- The feeling of Americans toward
Victotia.is, therefore, a kindly one, so ranch
so that, while we are devoted to a republi
can form of government, and would like to
British cousins well endowed with
such a birthright, we should regret to see such
an brought about to-day, even if it
were practicable, through any rough dealing
with the present sovereign of Great Britain.
In the event of the death of the Prince of
Wales, the loyal feeling of the nation, will be.
greatly quickened bj’ the sad event. In their
sympathy for the Queen the people will bo
reminded afresh of her many virtues, and
will forget the faults of her dead son. Of these
they will say, that his errors and shortcom
ings were those of his age and station rather
than himself. They will remember that, so
far as those features of the Prince’s life arc
concerned which have become a sub
ject of popular criticism, they
were at the worst nothing more thau a copy
of the Prince’s predecessors, a trait bv no
means obnoxious to the popular British
mind. Ifcnco the average feeling of the
people toward their lost Prince will be one
of unalloyed regret; that toward his be
reaved mother one of pure sympathy.
Against this feeling the Dilkes and Brad-
Jaughs, who have of late been assaulting
the public ear so vociferous] 3* against royal
ty, will find it impossible to make any prog
ress. Alreadj' tbo pcoxile had begun to
silence their harangues in that rude hut ef
fective mauuer characteristic of the staunch
British subject, and their success for the next
few 3-ears will be »ven more doubtful than it
was a week ago.
Now comes Governor John T. Hoffman, of
New "York, who proposes to declare, in his
annual message to the Legislature, that the
Democratic party must be dissolved; that it
is powerless for good; that it serves ouly to
perpetuate evils aud abuses, and that the
best interests of the country demand its for
mal disbandment. Ho is willing to unite
with any Republicans in any way to accom
idish political reforms.
But there is one thing Governor Hoffman
and those who agree with him overlook.
It makes no difference whether the
party opposed to the Republican party be
called Democratic or by any other
name ; -so long as it is ruled and directed
by the Hoffmans, Blairs. Pendletons, aud
Randalls, it will be practically the same thing
it is now. What these men, who profess to
be governed by the beat interests of the coun
try, must do, is to join fcho Republican party.
Let them abandon all other organizations,
and unite with the Republicans. Iu that
party, and as part of its organization and
strength, they will be able to render valuable
service to the country, accomplish reforms,
rebuild the credit of the nation, audestabliah
a sound policy of taxation. As an opposition
party,the Democrats will gain nothing by the
mere dropping of their name.
tttr BOUAN CATHOLIC SCHISM IN GERMANY.
Those clerics, and others in Germany be
longing to tho Roman Catholic Church, who
reject tho dogma of infallibility, and who
have been formally excommunicated, are rec
ognized as “Old Catholics,” as distinguished
from those who have embraced tho new doc
trines, Tho extent of the division in the
Church is in proportion to the forcible
means taken by those in authority to compel
acceptance of the new dogma. This
effort has been made in all parts of Germany,
and has been resisted. In Bavaria there was,
during tho session of the council, a strong
opposition to the dogma, and especial pains
were taken to force down this opposition.
Excommunication failing to coerce
any person, an attempt was
made to seize tho Church property
aud institutions, and exclude all but tho
“ infallibilists.” To do this required the aid
of government, which was refused. Tho re
sult is, that, the government recognizing the
excommunicated Catholics as members of
the Church, the dispossession has not taken
place. There are now 114 “ Old” Catholic
congregations in Bavaria holding Church
property in defiance of Papal authority.
The process of excommunication has proved
a failure, so far as it was intended to frighten
the faithful. The raid'is, Oliat an/excommu
nication, however formally declared, is op
erative only when it is pronounced for just
cause,—aud in Germany the opponents of
infallibility are so assured of the rectitude
of their conduct that they “take tho
chances” whether the excommunication has
any real validity.
This disregard of Episcopal authority is so
general that several Bishops have now
adopted a more conciliatory course, and no
longer denounce their incredulous flocks.
Tho King and Ministry of Bavaria refuse to
remove tho “ Old” Catholic Professors at tho
theological universities, so these institutions
now teach that Papal infallibility is not true,
and that its proclamation 'is not binding
upon the conscience of men. Tho resistance
to this doctrine is pretty much the same in
tho Prussian provinces, aud the organization
of distinct congregations, under tho titles of
Old and New, has been the result of efforts to
excommunicate. In Westphalia, Baden, aud
Wurtemburg the “Old” Church is in
full operation. There are even in
Austria similar defections. In Hungary the
hierarchy were determined opponents of tho
new dogma, and for a long time refused to
proclaim it. Within a short time, however,
the Cardinal Archbishop has issued a letter
advising every person, no matter, what his
personal opinions may be, to submit, in order
to avoid a division in the Church. Tho Hun
garian.Diet has recognized the “ Old” Cath
olics as the true Church.
The doctrine of Papal infallibility has heen
.received by the Roman Catholics of the world
generally with indifference ; hut there has
heen no division of the Church anywhere
except in those countries where an attempt
has been made to compel a formal acceptance
of it. In such cases a revels has taken place.
This serves as another illustration of the fact
that the human mind can no longer be con
trolled in its judgments by ecclesiastical re
solves. Papal infallibility is virtually re
jected In all Germany, and, should the policy
of coercion ho persisted in, will make as w J de
a separation of Chnrch-memhers as took
place in the days of the Reformation.
A TILT AT THE COURTS,
Wendell Phillips has mounted a now hob
by ; one which does not seem likely to prove
quite as ricketty and infirm as some which
he has lately* bestridden. Abandoning for a
time the crusade for Tjroman-sulirage and
eight-hour laws, the indefatigable agitator
has lately addressed himself to the task of
reforming our courts of law and insane
asylums. A recent lecture given by him in
Boston leads to the inference that Wendell
regards courts of Jaw as a nuisance of the
first magnitude. In them (he complains}
the rights of the individual are daily over
ridden in the most shameful manner. The
State, ho charges, is constantly making a
brute of itself, by assaulting the most sacred
rights of the individual. Wendell seems to
pine for the good old days when the rights of
the individual were held so precious that
men went to war for the third or the fourth
place in a royal procession. Now, ho says,
the State connives at the malice of evil
doers, and enables them to shut an innocent
person up in jail on a mere complaint, with
out grounds, and affords no redress to the
person so injured. Hero is the philanthro
pist's illustration of this species of iniquity
—a case which we fear many readers will
recognize as the prototype of something
within their own recollection;
I served once as a Clerk in a court of this county,
and I remember a single case of a woman who
earned her daily dollar, and the pride of her life
was, that her grandchildren, left to her orphans,
were kept from the almshouse by their grand
mother’s persistent thrift and toil. It was the last
refuge of a justifiable pride. She was an object
of some criticism in the neighborhood, and finally
dragged into the court on a charge of theft.
Friendless, she could nat be bailed, and she re
mained nearly a month In the Suffolk County Jail.
In that time ncr grandchildren necessarily were
sent to the poor house, her little stock of furni
ture was sold at auction to pay her rent, she had
to borrow of her neighbors the means of getting
her witnesses, and at last, after nigh thirty days,
she saw the face of a Judge for thirty minutes, and
the final examination of the case showed it was
baseless; that it had not a loop to hang a doubt
on; that it hadn’t a shadow of .justification by
the confession of the Magistrate himself. Out of
pocket more than she could earn in two months,
scarred in character, sore with the breaking of
the only tie that bound, her to self-respect, her
children paupers, the Judgo graciously alio wedlier
to go. Whose mistake was it that she ever came
there 1 Not her. She never stopped her foot
over the line of the law. The State owed her
atonement; the State owed her compensation.
The State, which had invaded the round of her
domestic and faultless life, owed her, in the per
son of the Magistrate, a public apology, and then
behind that the amplest pecuniary compensation
for the loss. [Applause.! Why don’t it do it?
Because the King can do no wrong, and the State
can never be charged with it*, offences.
Another outrage of the courts, of which
Mr. Phillips complains, is the i npunity with
which lawyers are allowed to huliy and rid
icule witnesses in court. “ One-half of
what is called the wit of the bar,” ho says,
“is nothing hut gross abuse of witnesses;
wit which among gentlemen would bo con
sidered infamous." He goes further, and
charges the bench—yea, the bench of Bos
ton Itself—with rrahameful degree of aristo
cratic favoritism. Here are some of his accu
. nations, in which his audience manifested
marked sympathy:
There ia la the courts of Massachusetts, and
especially of Boston, an aristocratic leaning and
favoritism which would disgrace any bar ia
Christendom: and I have known a perfectly
faultless and worthy member of the Suffolk bar,
standing high in social life, who was
obliged, after years of submission to injustice,
to rebuke a late Chief Justice of the Common
wealth to his face, because ho never could get a
hearing when brought in comxietition with the
more lashionablc and popular members of the
bar; and I have known that Chief Justice, the
most honorable instance of an honorable career,
meet that gentleman afterwards on the pavement
atd acknowledge that ho deserved the rebuke.
« e have in this County of Suflolk a law club. It
is made up of the fashion and wealth of the bar.
iNo man enters it merely on the ground that he is
a iawj-tr. or mat he is learned in the law, or that
i!P,r5 9 J SUC ' cc ll* ui * u tbe law, or that he has a large
must belong to a petted circle ; ho
tiiiaii?e<l with a sort of social seal; ho
,°"J Irom a certain liot-lioi-.se. Other
✓ member; and every critic of the
™,^ B in ? i fail to see that, after an evening
V m<iUe « anii social reunion to the
wee sma hours of the morning, the Judge
when he takes the bench listen* to the motion
allows a close approach and personal entreatv to
the companion of the last evening, while he lea ves
the other lawyer at a proper distance to snVik
loud, to urge his claim like a common claimant.
The. courts, be insists, are criminally lazy,
for another thing. “The departments at
Washington are lazy enough to make a Syb
arite, who never moved except when a rose
leaf got doubled, ashamed of himself; and
.yet the departments at Washington aro furi
ously active compared with the courts."
On the abuses of the insane asylum Phil
lips is less original, though no less emphatic;
the point being that persons are wrongfully
committed to those institutions, and inhu
manly' treated while there. “Why," says
Phillips, “there arc many'persons in yonder
insane asyTura ' who are as sane as you and
Ibut it does not seem to have struck bis
audience that merely to be as sane as Won
dell Phillips should necessarily entitle
a person to bo exempt from the asy
lums. Crazy or not crazy', however, Phillips
is the most persevering scold in America
and, as he is coming to Chicago soon to scottl*
for a lecture organization in consideration of
a sum the figures of which are none of our
business, wo hope ho may bo induced to look
up some of the proceedings of our local
courts; especially of the police variety, aud
weave them into one of his charming tirades.
HOW COLONEL O’NEAL DIDN’T FIGHT A
Su£L
The progress of ideas which has followed
the war in the Southern States is shown in
the decadence of the supposed virtue of duel
ling. The wager of single combat has been
one of the institutions of the South, and espe
cially .of Kentucky, from time immemorial.
But few of the historical personages of that
State have escaped the necessity of vindi
cating their honor, or establishing their rep
utation for courage, by lighting a duel. But,
alas for chivalry! a change has come over the
people. A citizen of that sovereign State,
aud one bearing a military title, has received
a blow! Ho instantly opened an epistolary
communication with the aggressor, seeking
satisfaction, and, when the usual satisfaction
was offered, explained that what he meant
was not an appeal to arms. And this in
Kentucky!
The eventful history of the affair is easily
told. General Burbridgo struck Colonel
O’Neal a blow in the face. Colonel O’Neal
wrote to Burbridge: “I now demand satis
faction “My love for your family precludes
me from sending you a challenge; it is with
you to waive all matters of that sort.” Gen
eral Burbridgo answered, waiving Colonel
O’Neal’s concern for the Burbridge family.
O’Neal then writes to Burbridge: “It is now
with 3’ou to say at what time and place you
will render the satisfaction I demand.” Bur
bridge appoints Colonel Terrell as his friend,
and O’Neal selects Captain Tisdale, After a
long correspondence, Tisdale writes to Ter
rell .* “I am authorized by Colonel O’Neal to
say that, if his communication of yesterday
was construed as a challenge, the construc
tion was an erroneous oue.” To which ex
traordinary epistlo Terrell, with the dis
gust of an old Kentuckian, writes
back: “If Colonel O’Neal does not mean
a challenge, what in the name of
all that is reasonable did he mean ?” And
then Terrell refused to receive any more
communications, or to act as peace commis
sioner. To the eminent disgust of ancient
Kentucky, four warriors (one General, two
Colonels, and one Captain), with. the provo
cation of a blow in the face, could not got
up a duel. There was not even an arrest
made. The two principals were left alone
by the police, and still there was no light.
The records of Kentucky now show that,
when a man demands satisfaction for a blow,
and requests tho aggressor to name time and
place for rendering tho same, it does not
mean blood. Tho novelty of this was too
much for Terrell, whoso spirit was too proud
to authorize him to sit as a Justice of tho
Peace to weigh out damages to bo paid aud
received for a blow.
Thene was a time in Kentucky when a man
taking the course adopted hy O’Neal would
have been forced by public opinion to emi
grate. But the sentiment of the State has
undergone a change. O’Neal will survive.
His tenderness for Mrs. Bnrbridgo and the
little Burhridges will become a part .of the
common law of Kentucky.
It is agreed upon all hands that Chicago,
will he speedily rebuilt, and probably upon
a scale of grandeur exceeding that of tbo past»
and upon this alluring prospect we felicitate
ourselves, and indulge in many pleasing an
ticipations. Thosoof us who are still able to
light in the battle of life have taken hold of
our work with the earnestness, courage, and
disciplined strength horn of a great calamity.
IVo feel that wo are sustained in
our efforts by the approval and assist
ance of the civilized world, and especially
of this teeming and thriving and driving
Northwest, to which wo really owe all that
we have been heretofore. In the midst of
snow and frost, therefore, the work goes on.
When the broken bricks and mortar and
ashes are frozen into a solid conglomerate,
we undermine the mass with pickaxes or
wedge it apart with crowbars, it
to the lake shore, even across the railway
tracks, and tumble it on the ice-pack of the
outer basin. We bnild ovens to heat our
bricks in, so that the mortar may not bo
frozen in the wall before it seta. Wo mb onr
bands and stamp our feet and wear coverings
over our cars, so that we may lose none of the
precious sunlight in these short December
days. Nothing less than 14 degrees below
zero can give us pause. Por Chicago must
bo rebuilt, and it is given to us to do it.
Meanwhile the poor are taken care of.
Thousands of houses have heen built for
them, and the coal ration, the meat ration,
and the bread ration are not wanting.
So much for the share of those who have
“ something left,” whether in moncj-, goods,
credit, home, health, or youth. To all of
these there is hope, and hope, as we all know,
is the last thing in Pandora’s box—the one
comfort at the end of a thousand ills.
How is it with those victims of the
fire who have lost all, and to whom not oven
hope is left f Wo speak of those on the
down hill side of life, who had accumulated
enough to make themselves comfortable
during their remaining days, and to give
their children a fairer start in life than they
had themselves. How many of this class
arc there, especially in the ill-fated North
Division, who, on that wild night, saw prop
erty, business, homes, comforts, hopes, the
labors of a well-spent lifetime, over3’thiug
disappear in smoko and ashes*?
Many of theso are past the period
when it is possible, by the exercise of frugal
ity and perseverance, to rebuild their shat
tered fortunes, and recover some portion of
what was lost. Many are in feeble health.
Others have so many dependent upon them
that, in the most favorable circumstances,
they cannot sec ahead of one day’s earnings.
Shall not these helpless ones, who look on
with tearful eyes while others rebuild Chi
cago, and every day sec new-comers stepping
into their places, receive our tender S3*mpathy
and aid, not merely now while the fit is on us,
and while the whole civilized world is lend
ing us a helping hand, but hereafter and
al ways, while the presence of their great affile- ,
tieu remains among us ?
Mr. C. C. Fulton, editor of the Baltimore
American, has published a letter advising
that all Federal office-holders abstain from
participation in the next Republican Nation
al Convention. The St. Louis Democrat, while
approving this suggestion, points out another
reform, whic*i, taken in connection with Air.
Fulton’s advice, has a llavor of personality
in it, though of itself It is eminently joat.
The Democrat thus states the evil and the
remedy:
Tliero is another very much needed reform 0 f
the civil service which we hope to see adopted
bCiOre long. It is the practice of appointing
newspaper editors and publishers to Federal of
fices—or, to put it more gently, the willingness of
certain editors and publishers to accept Federal
offices. This needs reform by the radical process
of abolition. Wo refer particularly to the largo
and pretcndedly influential newspapers of tbo
country, published In great cities, and regarded
as molacrs of public opinion. *
So far as a President is personally concerned,
he loses rather than gains in the popular favor by
such appointments. The editor becomes lu pub
lic esteem, from the moment be accepts an office,
the paid advocate or attorney of tbo admin
istration. Do may speak tbo highest truth
in the mestcloqueut of articles, yet the public
will insist on believing that the office prompted
it all. Tbo paper loses Its power for good, and
what might have been a valuable aid to a party,
and its standard-bearer, degenerates to the level
of a common clafjneur. I’ho people who patron
ize a newspaper have a right to expect in Ps col
umns a candid and honest discussion of public
men and public measures, and they cannot bo
sure of getting it from a journal whoso editor is
bound to any party by the strong tie of a re
munerative office. The reform herein suggested
is one of great importance, and wo hope it will
soon receive tho consideration P deserves. We
trust Mr. Fulton will speedily second our motion.
Mr. Lewis Downing, Chief of the Cherokee
Indians, communicated his annual message
to the National Council of the tribe on Mon
day last, and the document is interesting
and husiness-like. Since the last session, the
Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railroad has been
constructed through the Cherokee territory;
the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad has also en
tered the territory, and along its route
se\ eral towns have been commenced. The
Chief advises, as a protection to the people,
that the council shall confer with the other
Indian nations through whose territory these
roads pass, and establish uniform rates of
fare and freight. He alsoadviscs the char
tering of competing roads. This indicates
that the Cherokees are not behind their white
brethren in resistance to the exactions of
railroads, and are looking to the same legal
moans of protection.
THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE: SUNDAY, DECEMBER. 10, 187 L
Opening Scenes in Congress.
A Fashionable Prayer in the Senate.
Tlie Message.
Overlook on the Committees-
Congress came together on a miserable,
sleety morning,—the sky overcast; the
street turned up for npw municipal improve
ments, so that the walking was bad; and
half the hotels unfinished, so that everybody
was complaining of bad coffee and non-at
tendance at the bells. Tho two lines of
horse-cars which go lengthwise through the
scattered place were filled from 9 o’clock
until noon, and we had the usual instances
of Verdant Green and family filling up the
narrowest parts of the Capitol’s corridors to
look at bits of ornamentation, and gape at
the ceilings. There was the usual array of
nondescript women perambulating all over
tho lobbies, peepiug into committee-rooms,
and filling up the best chairs in the Senate
parlor aud in the House retiring-room.
Where these women come from, nobody
knows; where they go to when they die, wo
might suspect, if they were not entitled to
so much pity. Then there was tho inevitable
young man, hoping in some vague way for
occupation in tho folding-room, and gazing
around tho old Hall of Representatives, or
standing, anus akimbo, in tho tho Rotunda,
on dismal terms with himself and his govern
meru.
The gentleman left out of the present Con
gress on grounds sufficient for his constitu
ency was seen stalking around the doors un
der his honorary rights; and ho was a more
agreeable and courteous being than when ho
sat there by the right of election. It was
well understood that this dethroned sover
eign had his pocket filled with railroad bills,
and knew nowhere else to go for an easy live
lihood. Behold, also, the President’s numer
ous runners around, loafing up in dark cor
ners, with their lingers on their lips, hoping
to ascertain about “ the new movement.
The man who can lind the least nows on this
question is most welcome at the White
House, where the respect accorded to a fel
low who has obtainedsome dangerous knowl
edge is a good deal like that of Mr. Macbeth:
“ Bring mo no more reports; let them fly, all!”
Of course, wo had the bride at the Capital,
in her steel-blue dress, limping around un
der the pictures; while the dejected groom,
with a now pair of hoots, very much dis
tressed. is prepared to go home and substan
tiate all the bad accounts ho ever heard of
the nature of Republican governments.
There, of course, is the woman with the face
as hard as the stone profile in the White
Mountains, poking the Revolution in the
hands of people timid chough to examine it.
There is Daniel Pratt, peering around
among the members, and expecting to bo
spoken to as the standing candidate for the
Presidency, and willing to accept a small
mite toward his election-fund. There is the
grandiose old chan, with a cocked hat on his
ead, with bud* clothing, Wellington boots,
and hair and profile like the con
ventional Benjamin Franklin, sell
ing pamphlets to now members.
There is tho Bean Hickman, with his boots
open to relievo him of the gout, hobbling
round in an overcoat,—tho property of a late
lobbyist,-—with his mustache waxed, and
that horrible old man’s grimace, based upon
an imitation of a young man’s leer. There
are tho policemen, white and black, stand
ing quietly at their posts all over tho build
ing, with their neat blue uniforms; and the
doorkeepers are mustering up memory to
know who shall pass tho doors of privilege,
or bo softly rebuffed by the palm of the
baud. Yonder is tho architect, telling a
member of a committee what is proposed to
be done tho next time with the inside of the
dome. Yonder, in tbe little document-room,
boys aro sorting bills, memorials, and re

FASHIONABLE PRAYER IX THE SENATE.
Dr. Newman offered to tho Senate, rto the
Lord, a popular prayer. “ From this national
altar,” it began. On tho Chicago question it
touched thus : “And if, in tho execution of
national law, the cyclone has swept over
land and sea, yet that which has been spared
is more than that which has been destroyed.”
This detached sentence is one of Chadband’s
sollilonuies—no part of a prayer. It is fol
lowed by another dotachedremark; and then
wo hearof “tho Angel of Generosity—a bathet
ic Miltonism, and something altogether lino
and new. “Wo pray that onr houses of
mercy and our temples of piety {etc.] may
ever be within Thy care and keeping.
Superllnous. and merely sonorous! “Tho
revival of oflicial virtue and honesty, and
tho exposure and punishment of those who
plundered the public treasury,” are proper
subjects of thanks, but a little too timely in
a partisan aspect—followed hard, as they are,
** a 3 personal appeal for the President, to
whom Newman is confessor. Congressoueht
to wipe out this business of fashionable
praying, and prescribe a form of prayer
to be read daily by some perma
nent, pure, and needy man, who
can say. in tho spirit of Francis Aabury {see
Asbury’s Journal, published by Lane & acott,
1852, volume o, pacoS34); “Methodistpreach
ers politicians! What a curse!” Respectful
and sincere opening prayer is a noble and
holy feature of Congressional proceedings.
But no man not elected to Congress by tho
people ought to bo privileged to harangue
there. A committee of good Christian Sena
tors, Hkc Buckingham, Corbett, Frelinghny
sen, Tipton, and Vickers, might prepare this
form of prayer, and let the Senators repeat
it, or parts of It, aloud! We would thus save
the several branches of tho Christian Church
from sending a lobby hero every two years
to buttonhole, beg, and caucus around Con
gress for Chaplains. Tho wages of politics
and tho clerical office seldom agree, with
each other. Tho first prayer over delivered
before Congress, Sept. 7,1774, by tho Rev. Mr,
Dnchc, at the time a Whig, and who was
made permanent Chaplain of the same body
July 1», 1770, was followed by the abandon
ment of the patriot cause by tho same Mr.
Dnche as soon as tlm British captured the
city in which ho lived. This clergyman,
still further mixing m politics, wrote a letter
to Washington, beseechmghim “ to represent
to Congress the indispensable* necessity of
rescinding the hasty and ill-advised Declara
tion of Independence,” Washington prompt
ly remitted his letter to Congress.aud Dnclie
was obliged to leave tho country. To anoth
er celebrated politico-clerical char
acter, Mason L. Weems, wo owe
most of the anecdotal rubish which
litters the vestibule of our his
tory, such as Washington and the cherry
tree, etc.—little lies, but they ombarass
everybody who seeks to gain a true concep
tion of the greatspirits of that day. To see
Weems well shown up, read Bishop Meade’s
“ Old Courches of Virginia.” The House
Chaplaincy business, during tho Impeach
ment trial here, got down into tho mire of
resentful politics, and, in public prayer,
stigmas were affixed to men of tho exalted
station and character of Fessenden, Trum
bull, and Grimes. Some time afterward, Dr.
Newman, at a period when Chief Justice
Chase was supposed to bo seeking tho Presi
dency, was guilty of the assumption of ask
ing in prayer that ho “ might have simplic
ity of wisdom”—whatever that might be.
\N hat impudence and cowardice!
BLAISE S NEW COMMITTEES.
Everything in the House gave way to com
mittee announcements. Committees are to
Congress what the several faculties and
habits are to man, or the hundred eyes to
Argus.
The fiist committee in order called hy the
Speakef is by no means the first in impor
tance. At the head of it was announced
George W. McCrary, of Keokuk, lowa, a
nat ive of Indiana, 3G years old, who removed
to lowa at the age of 1, and entered the bar
there in 1850. He has been in the State Sen
ate, practised law witb success, aud this is
the second Congress he has attended.
The next two committees noticed were the
biggest in the Leap—Ways and Means and
Appropriations, Hawes, of Massachusetts,
taking the iirst, and Garfield, of Ohio, the
second. "With Dawes were put the old
Wayers and Meancrs—Horace Maynard, Wil
liam D. Kelley, and James Brooks,—and,
beside them, Burcbard.of Illinois; Finkeln
burg, of Missouri: Ellis H. Roberts, of New
York; Michael C. Kerr, of Indiana, and
James B. Beck, of Kentucky. Dawes is a
man of a certain conscientious timidity,
rising at times to boldness. Brooks, Finck
elnburg, Bnrcbard, and probably Beck, are
anti-Protectionists, so that the committee as
it stands is. for the first time in many years,
a low tariff committee, aud probably contains
a majority of Free Traders. The Northwest
owes good feeling toward Mr. Blaine for
this selection.
Appropriations requires a high order of
personal integrity, aud the committee con
tains it. There are two rich men upon it,—
Freeman Clarke, of Rochester, New York, a
great owner of telegraph stock in the West
ern Union, and Thomas Swann, of Maryland,
who is a capitalist, stockholder in several
highways, a shrewdman in real estate, &c.
Garfield, Sargeant, aud Palmer of lowa, are
all well-to-do men, practicing law or diffus
ing intelligence among agricultural commu
nities. Eugene Hale, on this committee, is
a personal prolcye of Blaine, the Speaker; he
is only 85 years old, and is perhaps the clear
est-headed. highest-toned young man now iu
Congress; he is engaged to marry the daugh
ter of SenatorChaudler, of Michigan. There
are three Democrats on this money-spending
committee, or onlj’ one-third of the whole
number, and they arc three well-approved
men.—Marshall, of Illinois; Nibluck, of
Indiana, aud Swann.
The Committee on Banking and Currency
is headed by Samuel Hooper, who is suppos
ed to represent the great money minds and

purses of Boston. Mr. Harwell, of Chicago;
Henry >\aldronof Michigan; andS.S.Cox,
of New York, axe associated with Mr. Hooper.
Tho Pacific Railroad Committee, is led by
Wheeler, of New York,—aresiden tof Malone,
where the Fenians made their back-action
light into Canada, two years ago. Ho has
also been President of the New York Consti
tutional Convention, and this is tho third
Congress ho has come to. Wheeler’s friends
made an effort to run him to the head of
Ways and Means. It is very questionable as
to whether tho rest of tho committee is not
tho weakest combination, so far as public
reputation is. concerned, which Blaine has
given the|country. Perhaps ho thought
that nothing good could go out of the Pacific
Railroad, or come into it.
Austin Blair, of Michigan, who expected,
under certain circumstances, to go to the
head of Ways and Means, is put at the head
of the strong Committee on Claims. Hois
supposed to bo a man of natural integrity,
without political charity and without
economical eyesight. Ho can do no harm,
however, in the Claims Committee.
At the head of the Committee of Commerce
stands Samuel Shellabarger, of Ohio, —a pian
in middle life, a native of Ohio in Mouroo’s
administration, and a successful public mau.
Shellabarger was set down in the popular
computations for a high committee, and was
supposed to have bid for itin certain speech
es winch he has lately made in Ohio. Nothing
has been developed of the man here, how
ever, except some clearness of diction and
plausibility of personal appeal when tho fag
ends of questions came up. He is one of two
or three fanatics in Congress who would
have tho government count all tho silver
spoons in each township of the country, and
number the hairs of every American citizen.
His notion of a great nation is something
poking its nose under every clothes-line, and
he thinks tho American flag should be at
tached to every convict’s shirt and Jack
Tars cap. With this unhinged sort of a
man, they have put in Sawyer, of' Wisconsin;
Lynch, the advocate of the revival of Maine
shipping with national funds; aud Conger,
who wants the government to build a port
wherever there is an indentation in tho
Western Lakes as big as a notch in a boy’s
jacknife. Such is the Committee on Com
merce.
The Committees of Public Lands, Agricul
ture, and Private Land Claims may bo
grouped together under the respective Chair
manships of Ketcham, of New York,—a
politician and volunteer soldier; Wilson, of
Ohio, a man educated in the State Legisla
ture: and Mecur, of Pennsylvania, from
the New York border. On these committees
there are few other men known to the pub
lic eye. Farnsworth, of Illinois, keeps the
Post Office Committee; ho is the ablest Illi
noisan, counting experience as a part of
Legislative abiGty, now in Congress.
The Committee on Manufactures amounts
to nothing as a general rule, and a Missouri
man Las it now. Bnrdett, a native of Eng
land, and to whom might bo ascribed, in case
he does not please tho tariff ilk, legitimate
intentions on “British gold.”
The Military Committee is headed by Co
burn, of Indiana, a volunteer officer of tho
war; Slocum and Lew Campbell are on this
committee. Shanks, of Indiana, heads the
Indian Affairs Committee, which has some
small timber in it this Congress.
Tho Judiciary falls again into the hands of
Bingham, who has about as little judicial
character as any man in Congress, being a
rhetorician, cranky, and bigoted, and
alert for a sentiment all the
time. Bon Butler, and Peters, of
Maine, are on this committee; and the
three Democrats are Eldridgo, Voorhees,
and Potter, of New York. Eldridgo I have
found, on acquaintance, to bo a well-inform
ed and entertaining man.
The Naval Committee is headed by a man
who lives in a part of tho country where
some of tho greatest barge-frigates in the
world continue to navigate,—Gleuni Scofield,
of Northwestern Pennsylvania; with whom
are tho old naval crowd: Starkweather,
Ketcham, Coghlan, of California,—a fine-ap-
E earing young man,—two or three carpet
aggers, and a Michigan lumberman.
When wo come to the Committee on For
eign Allairs,—which, in the Senate, is tho
ranking committee of all,—wo find tho in
offensive Banks retained at the head of it,
and Fernando Wood, General Morgan, and
Robinson, of Illinois,—three Democrats,—
bringing up the rear, while a couple of oth
ers who have been to Europe fill up the body.
The Territories of tho united States fail
into tho hands of Tafie, of Nebraska,—a na
tive Indiana man, formerly of Indianapolis.
There is no good reason why a Territorial
Delegate should not be put on this commit
tee, so as to speak for the Territpriea ti»^ n
selves, '*
Beu Sutler takes tho Committee Chair
manship on Revision of the Laws of the
United States, a committee to which instant
attention will be drawn, upon tho supposi
tion that he has some designs upon the laws
of the United States. Judge Kelley takes
charge of tho Committee on Coinage and
Weights and Measures, where he Is well in
formed. Ho is chagrined to the soul that he
docs not head Ways and Means.
The two Washington committees—District
of Columbia and Public Buildings—fall to
Starkweather, of Connecticut, and Halsey,
of New Jersey. On those committees, Far
well, of Illinois, and Roosevelt, of Now
iork, go.
Old Judge Poland, of Vermont, a fine old
man, takes charge of tho Committee on In
surrectionary States; with Lira, among oth
ers, are Horace Maynard, Scofield, Farns
worth, Job Stevenson, Ben Butler, S. S. Cox,
and Beck, of Kentucky. Tho Library Com
mittee is a good ouo, —tho only committee
connected with literature,—and Peters, of
Maino: Wheeler, of New York; and Camp
bell, of Ohio, compose it.
Leonard Myers takes tho Pateut Commit
tee; and Jesse H. Moore, of Illinois, the Pen
sion. The Accounts—a committee much
abused in times past—falls into tho hands of
Buffington, of Massachusetts, who ought to
watch the shysters around the House. Buf
fington is a Fallßiverman, and used to work
at tho loom, then studied medicine a little
while, went whaling a little while, went
shopping a good while, took up a gun in tho
war as a private, and has been in Congress
several times. Ho ought to watch tho ac
counts.
There are several other committees of no
significance except to the people upon them.
As to Ways and Means, somebody said to
Blaine:
“You have lost the confidence of Pennsyl
vania !”
Said Blaine: “Well, that is hotter than
losing the confidence of all the rest of the
country.”
THE MESSAGE.
The President's message vras read in the
House by Clerk Edward McPherson, of Get
tysburg, Pa,, who has continuously read
messages from Presidents Lincoln, Johnson,
and Grant. Ho is a man of quick 03*0 and
apprehension, but not very strong in health
or voice, and yet he was fairly heard hy one
of the smallest audiences which I have ever
seen gathered in the House galleries at the
opening of a session. Comparatively few
Seoplo were also upon the floor, and the dim
aylight gave poor effect to the now drab
carpet, a large portion of which was re
vealed, bare and blank, where, in former
times, dense throngs of people, pressing quite
up to the rows of chairs, have given charac
ter to similar scenes.
The President’s message assumed au undue
importance during the old administrations.
At that day tho literature of the country,
while strong in somo respects, had little cir
culation; and, fully threo-fonrths of the
American people entertained loud and rhet
orical notions of how a statesman should
speak and write. Tho booming, reso
nant rhetoric of Webster, the
nervous and intense periods of
Payne, tho broadside criticism of Logreo
and Fennimoro Cooper, the shilly-shally
feitilhloinsmlot Gaj’lord Clarke, and the|perso
nalities, invectives, and apostrophes of a set
of statesmen who apprendod the turn of a
sentence better than the turn of a national
sentiment or a great material fact,—these
made the populace entertain the notion that,
when a President's message appeared, we
ought to have at least something stirring in
form, find, if possible, stirring in idea. In
those old days, when railroads wore few, they
put on special locomotives, running at the
gigantic speed of twenty-five miles an hour;
and, whenever somo city or other cut off the
proper connection between two parts of the
same road, a furniture wagon
was prepared, with two mules
attached, and tho American fiag
covering both wagons and mules,—which
carried the message from one depot to anoth
er. Then Sir Bumpkin, who could not parse
tho name of any State, in tho Union, or tell
the derivation of his grandfather, stood
open-mouthed at the little old railroad sta
tion, to catch the stray copies of the Presi
dent's message as it was pitched off, and to
hear tho village demagogue, fresh from his
cups,—said demagogue having remained long
at hi? post, with relays of drinks every twen
ty minutes, in order to pass the first opinion
upon the message,—read the whole thing
over, paragraph by paragraph, and illustrat
ed it by local circumstances and passing lo-
Scnds. Those were tho days when a Prosi
ent's message divided with Hollow E’en and
hog-killing time tho whole year, so far as hol
idays were concerned. Wo got down so far
in the latter days of the pro-slavery party,
that men like Buchanan wrote messages, not
for Congress, to show the state of the coun
try, but for somo supposititious part of their
own party, which was presumed not to have
read the newspapers.—all tho news
papers being then Black Republican,—
but still keeping up the old traditional no
tion of reading tho President’s message.
Frank Pierce and James Buchanan had a
vague idea that,, with a message once a
year, and a special message now and then
thrown in, they could neutralize the whole
Republican press and readers of the repub
lic. Mere modem politics, with its accom
panying prying press, prying lecture sys
tem, and prying travelling system, has made
the mere utterances of a single man at a
fixed rime no more a matter of superstition.
A President can neither move oiit of his
orbit, as ho used to, or revolutionize tho
country with a statement or a sentiment, as
he might baye done. The great body of citi
zens has been moved up upon the officials,
and, although a goodly crowd still assemble
to hear what the President has to say fresh
from his lips, and share the feelings of
those Congressmen who hear it, yet the pen
alties for buncombe in our dav arc too great
for the President to overstep the bounds of
common diction and ordinary relation and
synopsis, Ihere is danger, of course, that
an ordinary sort of a man, at tho
Si x?- tho , . uatioQ at a time
like this, might set tho example
of a message little abovean auctioneers

them of the power of the law; and the par
ticular example which must be made of men

grant's notions.
General Grant’s message, in point of stvlo
and form, is the best that ho has given. Wo
can observe in this man a steady improve
ment, naturally derivative from his enlarged
opportunities. Where ho sticks to concise
relation of the fuller matter contained in the
reports of his Secretaries, be has been this
year apt enough to tell the people the facts
as he comprehends them. Where he speaks
out of his way, as he is careful not to do
mpre than once or twice, and then uncon
sciously to state some general proposition,
he, for the first time, starts a discussion. And
it may bo said that, while this is a very or
thodox message, it is probably one of the
very lowest grade in the sense of making the
people of the country think. Nothing
is put down which contains even the germ
of a thought, or which leans this
way or that in any other popular agitation,
as a Magistrate might properly do, and com
mit no grave error. Trimmed, weighed, de
livered up to a nation of voters with preju
dices, and not to a nation of voters with in
dignations or aspirations, this message may
be called one of the most considerate and
selfish synopses which ever left the Executive
Mansion.
POINT NA-POINT.
Two or three suggestions might be made:
The President discourages the ancient and
honored system of giving support to educa
tion out of the public lands. In the earliest
Congress of the country, a section in every
township was devoted to the support of the
common schools. This message throws that
system overboard, and bids for tho vote of
those interests which mean to take up the
whole of tho public lands, by saying that
educational interests may bo sufficiently
well preserved by the grants of the proceeds
of tho sales of public lauds to settlers. I
raise no issue on this point, but ask whether
the President’s position is well considered
with reference to the successful traditions
of the country.
. Tho President, in his reference to the report
of-the Commissioner of Agriculture, says;
“Agriculture is the groundwork of our pros
perity.” Earlier in the message he says, by
way of a flourish, that “the true prosperity
ana greatness of a nation is [a good instance
of magisterial culture] to ho found in the
education and elevation of its laborers.”
Both of these propositions for general enun
ciation are good; are either of them more
Ilian little bits of rhetoric? Of how much
more significance is the President’s state
ment in his remarks on the redaction of
taxes, that such should be made on
those articles which will not reduce the
wages of American labor ? Suppose
that the wages throughout the country are
higher than ever before, and the results of
life to the laboring man are less f It is no
torious in political economy that high wages
make general poverty; and wages were mod
erate in America until the war withdrew a
million of men from productive affairs, made
us a vast purchaser abroad, and set all the
energies of popular government at work to
make havoc. Them wages went up. It is
this kind of specious assertion which dema
gogues like Butler, and badly-informed men
like tho President, address to laboring class
es ; for nothing is surer than that average
wages produce happiness to tho laboring
classes, and that high wages are always at
tended with a corresponding increase m the
price of existence. Gath.
