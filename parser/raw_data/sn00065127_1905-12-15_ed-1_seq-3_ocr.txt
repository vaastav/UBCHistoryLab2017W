J." To tlie Senate and House of Repre
7 sentatives:
The people of this country contlnne
to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubtedly
there will be ebb and flow in such pros
t-'ii perity, and this ebb and flow will be felt
more or less by all members of the com
munity. A general failure of crops
would hurt all of us. Again, if the folly
of man mars the general well-being, then
those who are innocent of the folly will
have to pay part of the penalty incurred
by those who are guilty of the folly. A
panic brought on by the speculative folly
of part of the business community would
hurt the whole business community. But
such stoppage of welfare, though it
might be severe, would not be lasting.
In the long run the one vital factor in,
the permanent prosperity of the country
is the high individual character of the
average American worker, no matter
whether his work be mental or manual,
whether he be farmer or wage-wMker,
business man or professional man.
In our industrial and social system the
Interests of all men are so.closely inter
twjr.ya.iQ't in the immense majority of
ca«^Biitraight-dealing man who by his
eil'UvEey, by his ingenuity and industry,
ljeMSts himself mast nlso benefit others.
Normally the man of great productive
capacity who becomes rich by guiding
the labor of many other men does so by
enabling them to produce more than they
could produce without his guidance and
both he, and they share in the benefit,
which colnes also to the public at large.
The superficial fact that the sharing may
be unequal must never blind us to the
underlying fact that there is this shar
ing, and that the benefit comes in some
degree to each man concerned. Nor
mally the wage-worker, the man of small
means, and the average consumer, as
well as the average producer, are all
•like helped by making, conditions such
that the man of exceptional business
ability receives an exceptional reward
for his ability. Something can be done
by legislation to help the general pros
perity but no such help of a perma
nently beneficial character can be given
to the less able and less fortunate, save
as. the results of a policy which snail
Inure to the advantage of all industrious
and efficient people who act decently.
If, therefore, the less fortunate man is
moved by envy of his more fortunate
brother to strike at the conditions tinder
which they have both,: though unequally,
prospered, the result will assuredly be
that while damage may come to the one
struck at, it will visit with an. even heav
ier load the one who strikes the blow.
Taken as a whole, we must all go up or
to down together.
Curb for Corporation*.
true that where there is no gov
lital restraint or supervision some
otTiS*exceptional men use their energies
not i4 ways that are for the common
good, but in ways which tell against this
common good. The fortunes amassed
through corporate organization are now
•o large, and vest such power in those
that wield them, as to make it.a matter
of necessity to give to the sovereign—
that is. to the government, which repre
sents the people as a whole—some effec
tive power of supervision over their cor
porate use. In order to insure a healthy
social and industrial life, every big cor
poration should be held responsible by,
and be accountable to, some sovereign
strong enough to control its conduct.
I am in no sense hostile to corpora
tions. This is an age of combination,
and any effort to prevent all combination
will be not only useless, but in the end
Yicious, because of the contempt for law
iwhich the failure to enforce law inevit
ably produces. We should, moreover,
recognize in cordial and ample fashion
the immense good effected by corporate
agencies in a country such as ours, and
the wealth of intellect, energy, and fidel
ity devoted to their service, and there
fore normally to the service of the pub
lic, by their officers and directors. The
corporation has come to stay, just as the
trade union has come to stay. Each can
do and has done great good. Each' should
be favored so long as it does good. But
«ach should be sharply checked where it,
against law and justice. So long
finances of- the nation are kept
5tfin honest basis no other question
ol internal economy with which the Con
gress has the power to deal begins to
approach in importance the matter of
endeavoring to secure proper industrial
conditions under which the individuals—
and especially the great corporations—
doing an interstate business are to act.
The makers of our national, constitution
provided especially that the regulation
of interstate commerce should come
within the sphere of the general govern
mcnt. The arguments in favor of their
taking this stand were even then overr
whelming. But they are far stronger
to-day, in view of the enormous develop
ment of great business agencies, usually
•corporate in form. Experience lias
shown conclusively that it is useless to
try to get any adequate regulation and
supervision of these great corporations
by State action. Such regulation and
supervision can only be effectively exer
cised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction
is co-extensive with the field of work of
the corporations—that is, by the national
government. I believe that this regula
tion and supervision can be obtained by
the enactment of law by tlie Congress.
If this proves impossible, it will certainly
necessary ultimately to confer in full
't form such power upon the national
government by a proper amendment of
the constitution.
The Department of Justice has for the
last four years devoted more attention to
tho enforcement of the anti-trust legisla
tion than to anything else. Much has
been accomplished particularly marked
has been the moral effect of the prose
cutions but it is increasingly evident
that there will be a very insufficient
beneficial result in the way of economic
change. The successful prosecution of
one device to evade the law immediately
develops another device to accomplish
the same purpose. What is needed is not
sweeping prohibition of every arrange
ment, good or bad, which may tend to
restrict competition, but such adequate
supervision and regulation as will pro
Tent any restriction of competition from
being to the detriment of the public—
as well as such supervision and regula
tion as will prevent other abuses in no
way connected with restriction of com
petition. Of these abuses, perhaps, the
chief, although by no means the only one,
Is overcapitalization—generally itself the
tesult of dishonest promotion—because
of the myriad evils it brings in its train
for such overcapitalization often means
na Inflation that invites business panic
/tsclwayg conceals the true relation of
earned to the capital actually
JaBBfd, and it creates^ a burden of in
tsjfest payments which is a fertile cause
of improper reduction in or limitation of
•ages it damages the small investor,
discourages thrift, and encourages gam
bling and speculation while perhaps
worst of all is the trickiness and dishon
esty which it implies—for harm to mor
als is worse than any possible harm to
material interests, and"the debauchery
of politics and business by great dishon
est corporations is far worse than nny
actual .material evil they do the public.
Until the national government obtains,
In some manner which the wisdom of the
Congress may suggest, proper control
OTer the big corporations engaged in in
terstate commerce—that is, over the
great majority of the big corporations
It will be impossible to deal adequately
with these evils.
Railroad Rate Rcarnlation.
The first thing to do is to deal with
the great corporations engaged in the
business of interstate transportation. The
immediate and most pressing need, so
far as legislation is concerned, is the en
actment into law of some scheme to
secure to the agents "Of the government
such supervision and regulation of the
rates charged by the railroads of the
country engaged iu interstate traffic as
shall summarily and effectively prevent
the imposition of unjust or unreasonable
rates. It must include putting a com
plete stop to rebates in every shape and
form. This power to regulate rates, like
all similar powers over the business
world, should be exercised with modera
tion, caution and self-restraint bat it
should exist, so that it can be effectively
exercised when the need arises. The
first consideration to be kept in mind is
that the power should be affirmative and
should be given to some administrative
body created by the Congress. If. given
to the present interstate commerce com
mission or to a reorganized' interstate
commerce commission, such commission
should be made unequivocally adminis
trative. I do not believe in the govern
ment interfering with private business
more than is necessary- I do not believe
in the government undertaking nny work
which can with propriety be left in pri
vate hands. But neither do I believe in
the government flinching from overseeing
any work when it becomes evident that
abuses are sure to obtain therein unless
there is governmental supervision. It
is not my province to indicate the exact
terms of the law which should be en
acted but I call the attention of the
Congress to certain existing conditions
with which it is desirable to deal. In,
my judgment the most important pro
vision' which such law should contain is"
that cTttiferring upon some competent ad
ministrative body the power to decide,
upon the case being brought before it,
whether a given rate prescribed by a
railroad is reasonable and -just, and if
it is found to be unreasonable and un
just, then, after full investigation of
the complaint, to prescribe the limit of
rate beyond which it shall not be lawful
to go—the maximum reasonable rate, as
it. is commonly called—this decision to go
into effect within a reasonable time and
to obtain from thence onward, subject
to review by the courts. A heavy pen
alty should be exacted from any corpora
tion which fails to respect an order or
the commission.
Illegal transactions often occur under
the forms of law. It has often occurred
that a shipper has been told by a traffic
officer to buy a large quantity 'of some
commodity and then after it lias been
bought tin open reduction is made in the
rate to take effect immediately, the ar
rangement resulting to the ppafitr of the
one shipper and the one railroad and to
the damage of all .their competitors .for
it must not be forgotten that the big
shippers are at least as much to blame
as any railroad iii the matter of rebates.
The law should make it clear so that no
body can fail to understand that any
kind of commission paid on freight ship
ments, whether in this form or in the
form of fictitious damages, or of a con
cession, a free pass, reduced passenger
rate, or payment of brokerage, is illegal.
It is worth while considering whether
it would not be wise to confer on the
government the right of civil action
against the beneficiary of a rebate for
at least twice the value of the rebate
this would help stop what is really black
mail. Elevator allowances should be
stopped, for they have now grown to
such an extent that they are demoraliz
ing and are used as rebates.
The best possible regulation of rates
would, of course, be that regulation se
cured by an honest agreement among
the railroads themselves to carry out the
law. Such a general agreement would,
for instance, at once put a stop to the
efforts of any one big shipper or big rail
road to discriminate against or secure
advantages over some rival and such
agreement would make the railroads
themselves agents for enforcing the law.
The power vested in the government to
put a stop to agreements to the detri
ment of the public should, in my judg
ment, be accompanied by power to per
mit, under specified conditions and care
ful supervision, agreements clearly in the
interest of the public. All private-car
lines, industrial roads, refrigerator
charges, and the like should be expressly
put under the supervision of tho inter
state commerce commission or some sim
ilar body so far as rates, and agreements
practically affecting rates, are concerned.
The private-car owners and the owners
of industrial railroads are entitled to a
fair and reasonable compensation on
their investment, but neither private cars
nor industrial railrbads nor spur tracks
should be utilized as devices for securing
preferential rates. A rebate in icing
charges, or in mileage, or in a division
of the rate for refrigerating charges is
just as pernicious as a rebate in any
other way.
There should be publicity of the ac
counts of common carriers no common
carrier engaged in interstnte business
should keep any books or memoranda
other than those reported pursuant to
law or regulation, and these books or
memoranda should be open to the inspec
tion of the government. Only in this
way can violations or evasions of the
law be surely detected. A system of ex
amination of railroad accounts should
be provided similar to that now conduct
ed into the national bands by the bank
examiners few first-class railroad ac
countants, if they had proper direction
and proper authority to inspect books
and papers, could, accomplish much in
preventing willful violations of the law.
I urge upon the Congress the need of
providing for expeditious action by the
interstate commerce commission in all
these matters.
The question of transportation lies at
the root of all industrial success, and tlie
revolution in transportation which ha3
taken place during the last half century
has been the most important factor in
the growth of the new industrial condi
tions. Most emphatically we do not
wish to see the man of great talents
refused the reward for Jiis talents. Still
less do we wish to see liim penalized
but we do desire to see the system of
railroad transportation so handled that
the strong mail shall be given no advan
tage over the weak man. We wish to
insure as fair treatment for the small
town as for the big city for the small
shipper as for the big shipper. What
we need to-do is to develop an orderly
system and such a system can only
come through the gradually increased ex
ercise of the right of efficient govern
ment control.
The Congress should provide, by ap
propriate legislation, for the introduction
of block signals upon all railroads en
gaged iu interstate commerce nt the
earliest practicable date, as a measure of
increased safety to the traveling public.
The excessive hours of labor to which
railroad employes in train service are
in many cases subjected is also a matter
which may well engage the serious at
tention of the Congress.
Lalior anil Capital.
Tho national government has as a rule
but little occasion to deal with tlie formid
able group of problems connected more or
less directly with what Is known as tho
labor question, for in tlie great, majority of
cases these problems must bo dealt with
by the state and municipal authorities and
not by the national government. The na
tional government lias control of the Dis
trict of Columbia, however, and It should
see to It tliat the city of Washington Is
made a model city In all respects.
There has been demand for depriving
courts of the power to issue injunctions In
labor disputes. Such special limitation of
the equity powers of our courts would be
most unwise. It Is true that some judges
have misused this'power but this dogs not
justify a denial of the power any more than
an Improper exercise of the power to call
a strike bv a labor leader would Justify
the denial of the l'ifjht to strike. The rem
edy is to regulate.the procedure by .requir
ing the judge to give due notice to the ad
verse parties before granting tho writ, the
hearing to be ex parte if the adverse party
docs not appear at the time and place or
dered.
I renew the recommendation I made In
my lant annual mesisce for anlnVsstlia
tloa by tbe department of commerce and
1
labor of general labor conditions, especial
attention to be paid* tS the conditions of
child labor and child labor -legislation' In.
the several States. Such an investigation
should take Into account the various prob
lems with which the question of child labor
is connected.
In such a republic as ours the one thing
that we cannot afford to ncglect i* the
problem of turning out decent cltliens. The
future of the natron depends upon the citi
zenship of the generations to come the
children of to-day are those who to-morrow
will shape the destiny of our land, and we
cannot afford to neglect them.
The department of commerce and labor
should also make a thorough investigation
of the conditions of women In Industry.
Over '5,000,000 American women ore now
engaged in gainful occupations yet there
Is an almost complete dearth of data upon
which to base any trustworthy conclusions
as regards subject as Important as It is
vast and complicated. There Is need of full
knowledge on which to base action looking
toward State and municipal legislation for
the protection of working women. The in
troduction of women Into Industry Is work
ing change and disturbance In the domestic
and social life of the nation. The decrease
In marriage, and especially In the birth
rate, has been coincident with it. We must
face accomplished facts, and the adjust
ment to factory conditions must.be made,
but surely it can be made with less fric
tion and less harmful effects on family life
than is now the case.
Iu any great lambor disturbance not only
are employer and employe Interested, but
also a third party—the general public. Ev
ery considerable labor difficulty In which
Interstate commerce Is Involved should bo
Investigated by tho government and the
facts officially reported to the public.
The question of securing a healthy, self
respectiug and mutually sympathetic atti
tude as between employer and employe,
capitalist and wage worker, Is a difficult
one. But the underlying principles, the
root principles, In accordance with which
the problem must be solved are entirely
simple. We can get justice and right
dealing only If" we put as of paramount
Importance the principle of treating a man
tin hi.4 worth as a man rather than" with
reference to his social posltlou, bis occu
pation, or the class to which be belongs.
There are selfish and brutal men In all
ranks of life. If they are capitalists their
selfishness and brutnltty may take the
form of hard Indifference to suffering,
greedy disregard of every moral restraint
which interferes with the accumulation of
wealth, and cold-blooded exploitation of
the weak or, If they are laborers, the form
of laziness, of sullen envy of the more
fortunate,, and of willingness to perform
deeds of murderous violence. Such con
duct is just as reprehensible In one case
as in the other, and all honest and far
seeing men should join in warring against
It wherever It becomes manifest. Individ
ual capitalist and Individual wage worker,
corporation and union, are alike. entitled
to the protection of the law, find must
allke obey the law. Moreover,- In addition
to mere .obedience to the law, each Ban,
if ho be really a good, citizen, must show
broad sympathy for his neighbor and genu
ine desire to look at any question arising
between them from the standpoint of that
neighbor no less than from his own and
to this eud It IS essential that capitalist
and wage worker should consult freely one
wltli the other, should ench strive to bring
eloscr the day when both shall realize that
they are properly partners and not ene
mies.
This government Is not and never shall
be government by a plutocracy. This gov
ernment Is not and never shall be govern
ment by mob. It shall continue to be in
the future what It has been In the past, a
government based on the theory that each
man, rich or poor, Is to be treated simply
and solely on his worth as a man, that all
his personal and property rights are to be
safeguarded, and that he Is neither to
wrong others nor to suffer wrong from oth
ers.
Need of Insurance Reform*
The great insurance compauies afford
striking examples of corporations whose
business has extended so far beyond the
jurisdiction of the States which created
them as to preclude strict enforcement of
supervision and regulation by the parent
States. In my last annual message I recom
mended "that the Congress carefully con
sider whether the power of the bureau of
corporations can not constitutionally be ex
tended to cover Interstate transactions In
Insurance." Itecent events have emphasized
the importance of an earl and exhaustive
consideration of this question, to see wheth
er it Is not possible to furnish better safe
guards than the several States have been
able to furnish against corruption of the
flagrant kind which has been exposed. It
has been gnly too clearly shown that cer
tain of the* men at the head of these large
corporations take but small note ot the
ethical distinction between honesty-and dis
honesty they draw the line only this.Side
of what may be called law-honesty, the.
kind of nesty necessary In order to avoid
falling Into the clutches of the law:' Ot
course the only complete remedy for this
condition must be found In nn aroused pub
lic conscience, a higher sense of ethical con
duct In the community at large, and espe
cially among business men and in the great
profession of the law, and In the growth of
a spirit which condemus all dishonesty,
whether Iu rich man or I.v loor man, wheth
er It takes the shape of brfoory or of black
mail. But much can be done by legislation
which Is not only drastic but practical.
There is need of a far stricter and more
uniform regulation of the vast Insurance
interests of this country. The United
States should in this respect follow the
policy of other nations by providing ade
quate national supervision of commercial
Interests which are clearly national in char
acter.
Revenues and Expenditures*
There Is more need of stability than of
the attempt to attain an Ideal perfection in
the methods of raising revenue and the
shock and strain to the business world cer
tain to attend tny Serious change in these
methods render ftueh change inadvisable un
less for grave reason. There must be
something llko a general agreement among
the citizens of the several States, as rep
resented in the Congress, that the change
is needed anfl desired In the interest of the
people as a whole and there should then
be a sincere, intelligent and disinterested
effort to make it in such shape as will com
bine, so far as possible, the maximum of
good to the people at large with the mini
mum of necessary disregard for the special
Interests of localities or classes, unless
our expenditures can be kept witblu the
revenues then our revenue laws must be re
adjusted.
It should be considered whether It Is not
desirable that the tariff laws should pro
vide for applying as against or In favor of
any other nation maximum and minimum
tariff rates established by the Congress, so
as to secure certain reciprocity of treat
ment between other nations and ourselves.
Oar Carrcney System.
Every consideration ot prudence de
mands the addition of the element of elas
ticity to our currency system. The evil
docs not. consist In an inadequate volume
of money, but In the rldlglty of this vol
ume, which docs not respond as it should
to the varying needs of communities and
of seasons. Inflation must be avoided but
some provision should be made that will
insure a larger volume of money daring
the fall and winter months than In the
less active seasons of the year so that the
currency will contract against speculation,
and will expand for the needs of legiti
mate business.
Parity ot Federal Elections.
The power of the government to protect
the integrity of the elections of Its own
officials is Inherent and has been recognized
and affirmed by repeated declarations of
the Supreme Court. There Is no enemy of
free government more dangerous and none
so Insidious as the corruption of the elec
torate. I recommend the enactment of a
law directed against bribery and corrup
tion In federal elections. Such a law
should include severe penalties against
him who gives or receives a bribe intended
to influence his act or oplulon as an elect
or and provisions for the publication not
only of the expenditures for nominations
and elections of all candidates, but also of
nil contributions received and expenditures
miulc by political committees.
In political campaigns In a country as
large and populous as ours It Is Inevitable
that there should be much expense of an
entirely legitimate kind. This, of course,
means that many contributions, and some
of them of lurge fglze, must be made, and,
as a matter of fact, in nny big' political
contest such contributions are always made
to both sides. It Is entirely proper both
to give and receive them, unless there Is
au Improper motive connected with either
gift or reception. If they are extorted by
nnv kind of pressure or promise, express
or'Implied, direct or Indirect, In the way
of favor or Immunity, then the giving or
receiving becomes not only Improper but
criminal. If It Is possible to secure by law
tlie full and verified publication In detail
of all the sums contributed to and expend
ed by flie candidates or committees of any
political pnrtics the result cannot but be
wholesome.
All contributions by corporations to any
political commute or for nny political pur
pose should be forbidden by law directors
should not be permitted to use stockhold
ers' money for such purposes and, more
over, a prohibition of this" kind would be,
as far as It wcut, an effective method of
stopping the evils aimed at In corrupt prnc-.
tlccs acts.
The Conilnar Hnfcie Conference.
The first conference of nations held at
The Hague in 1803, being unable to disport
of alt the business before It, recommended
early date. In October, 1904, at tho In
stance of the Interparliamentary Union, I
Issued invitations to all the powers signa
tory to The Hague convention to send dele
gdtos to such a conference and' suggested
that It be again held at Tho-Hague, From
all the powers acceptance was received,
coupled In some cases with the condition
that wc should wait until the end of the
war then waging between Ilussla and Ja
pan. The Emperor of Russia, immediately
after the treaty of peace which so happily
terminated this war, in a note presented
to the President on Sept. 13, through Am
bassador Rosen, took the Initiative In rec
ommending that the conference be now
called. The United States government In
response expressed its cordial acquies
cence. We nssnme that all civilized govern
ments will support the movement, and
thnt the conference Is now an assured fact.
This renders It proper at this time to say
something as to the general attitude of this
government toward peace. A wanton or
useless war, or a war of mere aggression—
In short, any war begun or carried on In a
conscienceless spirit, Is to be condemned
as a peculiarly atrocious crime against all
humanity. We can, however, do nothing
of permanent value for peace unless we
keep ever clearly in mind the ethical ele
ment which lies at the root of the prob
lem. Our aim Is righteousness. Peace Is
normally the handmaiden of righteousness
but when peace and righteousness conflict
then a great and upright people can never
for a moment hesitate to follow the. path
which leads toward righteousness, even
though that path also leads to war. There
can be no worse foe of mankind in gen
eral, and of his own country In particular,
than the demagogue of war, the man who
In mere folly or to serve his own selfish
ends continually rails at and abuses other
nations, who seeks to excite his country
men against foreigners on Insufficient pre
texts, who excites and Inflames a perverse
and aggressive national vanity, and who
may on occasions wantonly bring on con
flict between his nation and some other na
tion. But there are demagogues of peace
Just as there are demagogues of wart
and In any such movement as this
for Tho Hague conference It Is 'es
sential not to be misled by one set
of extremists any more than by the other,
No object is better worthy tho attention
of enlightened statesmanship than, the es
tablishment of a surer method than now
exists of securing justice as between na
tions, both for the protection of the little
nations and for the prevention of war. be
tween the big nations. To this aim, we
should endc-avor not only to avert blood
shed, but, above all, effectively to strength-,
en the forces of right. .. .The golden rule
should be, and' os the, world MOWS In
morality it will be, the'guldlng rule'Of con
duct among nations as among Indlvlduals -1
tfaough the golden rule must not be con
strued, In fantastic manner, as forbidding
the' exercise of the police power. This
mighty and free republic Bhould ever denl
With' all! other States, great or small, on a
basis of high honor, respecting their rights
as jealously as It safesuards Its own.
Expound* the Monroe Doctrine.
One of the most effective instruments for
peace is the Monroe doctrine as It has been
and is being gradually developed by this
nation and accepted by other nations. No
other policy could have been as efficient in
promoting peace In the western hemisphere
and In giving to each nation thereon the
chance to develop along its own Hues. If
we had refused to apply the doctrine to
changing conditions it would now be com
pletely outworn, would not meet any of the
needs of the present day, and indeed would
probably by this time have sunk into com-
fs
itete oblivion. It is useful at home, and
meeting with recognition abroad because
we have adapted our application of It to
meet the growing and changing needs of
the hemisphere. That our rights and Inter
ests are deeply concerned iu tlie maintenauce
of the doctrine Is so clear as hardly to need
argument. This is especially true In view
of the construction of the Panama canal.
There are certain essential points which
must never be forgotten as regards the
Monroe doctrine. Tt must be understood
that under no circumstances will the Uni
ted States use the Monroe doctrine as a
cloak for territorial aggression. YTe desire
peaee with all the world, but perhaps most
of all with the other peoples of the Ameri
can continent. Moreover, we must make it
evident that we do not intend to permit the
Monroe doctrine to be used by any nation
on'this continent as a shield to protect it
from the consequences' of its own misdeeds
against foreign nations. If a republic to
the south of us commits a tort against a
foreign nation, such as an outrage against
a citizen of that nation, then the Monroe
dec
trine does not force us-to Interfere to
'prevent punishment .of. the tort, save to see
that the punishment does not assume the
form of territorial occupation in any shape.
Urges Santo Domingo Action.
Santo Domingo, in her turn, has made
an appeal to us to help her, and not only
every principle of wisdom but every gen
erous Instinct within us bids us respond
to the appeal. The conditions in Santo
'Domingo have for a number of years
grown from bad to worse until a. year
ago all society was on the verge of dis
solution. Fortunately, just at this time
a ruler sprang up in Santo Domiugo, who,
with his colleagues, saw the dangers
threatening their country aud appealed to
the friendship of the only great and power
ful neighbor who posrssscd the power, and
as they hoped nlso the will to help them.
There was imminent danger of foreign in
tervention. The previous rulers of Santo
Domingo had recklessly incurred debts, and
owing to her Internal disorders she had
ceased to be able to provide means of pay
ing the debts. The patience of her foreign
creditors had become exhausted, and at
least two foreign nations were on the point
of Intervention, and were only prevented
from intervening by the unofficial assurance
of this government that it would Itself
strive to help Sauto Domingo In her hour
of need. In the case of one of these
nations, only the actual opening of negotia
tions to this eud by our government pre
vented the seizure of territory iu Santo
Domingo by a European power. Of the
debts Incurred some were Just, while some
were not of a character which really ren
ders It obligatory on, or proper for. Santo
Domingo to pay them in full. But she
could not pay any of them unless some
stability was assured her government aud
people.
Accordingly the executive department of
our government hegotlated a treaty under
which we are to try to help the Dominican
people to straighten out their finances.
This treaty is pending before the Senate.
In the meantime a temporary arrangement
has been made which will last until the
Senate has had time to take actlen upon the
treaty. Under this arrangement the Do
minican government has appointed Ameri
cans to all the Important positions in the
customs service, and .they fire seeing to the
honest collection of the revenues, turning
over 45 per cent to the government for run
ning expenses and putting the other 55 per
ceut into a safe depositary for equitable
division. In case the treaty shall be ratified,
among the various creditors, whether Euro
pean or American.
This has completely discouraged all revo
lutionary movement, while it has already
Phat
roduced such an Increase in the revenues
the government Is actually getting
more from the 45 per cent "that the Ameri
can collectors tnrn over to It than tt got
formerly when it took the entire revenue.
Under the course taken, stability and
order and all the benefits of pcace are at
last coming to Santo Domingo, danger of
foreign Intervention has been suspended,
and there Is nt last a prospect that all
creditors will get justice, no more and no
less. If the arrangement is terminated by
jbe failure of the treaty chaos will follow
und If chaos follows, sooner or later this
government may be Involved in serious dif
ficulties with foreign governments over the
Island, or else may be forced Itself to In
tervene In the island In some unpleasant
fashion.
Army and Navy Affalra.
We cannot consider the question of our
foreign policy without at the same time
treating of the army and the navy. We
now have a very small army—indeed, one
well-nigh Infinitesimal when compared with
the army of any other large- nation. Of
course the army we do have should" be as
nearly perfect ot Its kind-aud for its size
as Is possible. I do not believe :that any
nrmy in the world bns a better average of.
enlisted meu or a better type of junior of
ficer but the army should be trained to
act effectively in a mass. Frovlsion should
be made by sufficient appropriations for
maneuvers of a practical kind, so that the
troops may learn how to take eare of them
selves under actual service cnuilltlons.
Our navy must, relatively to the navies
of other nations, always be of greater size
than our army. We have most wisely con
tinued for number of years'to' build up
our navv, and tt has uow reached a fairly
high standard of efficiency. This standard
of L-llU-icucy must not only be maintained,
but Increased. It does not seem to me
necessary, however, that tlie navy should—
at least In the Immediate future—be In
creased beyond the present number of,
units. What Is now clcarly necessary is: to
substitute efficient for *nefilclent units' IIB
the latter become worn-out or as It be
comes apparent that they are useless.
Recent naval history has emphasized cer
tain lessons'which ought not to, but which
do, need emphasis. Seagoing torpedo boats
or destroyers are Indlspersable, not only
for making night attacks by surprise upon
an enemy, but even in,bnttle for finishing
already' crippled ships. Under exceptional
circumstances submarine boats woulddoubt
less be of use. Fast sco.its are needed.
The malu strength of the navy, however,
ties and can only' lie In the great battle­
ships, the heavily-armored, heavily-gunned
vessel! which decide ^ths' mattery of the
seas. Heavy-armed cruisers also play a
most useful part, and unarmed cruisers, If
•wlft enough, are very useful as Bcouts.
Abaaea In Naturalization.
During the past year evidence has accu
mulated to confirm the expressions con
tained in my Inst two annual messages as
to the Importance of revising by appropri
ate legislation our system of naturalizing
aliens. I appointed Inst March a commis
sion to make a careful examination of
our naturalization laws, and to sug
gest appropriate measures to avoid tho
notorious abuses resulting from the
Improvident or unlawful granting
of citlsenshlp. This commission,
has discharged the duty imposed upon It,
and has submitted a report, which will be
transmitted to the Congress for Its con
sideration, and, 1 hope, for its favorable
action.
Breaches of Trnst In Pabllc Service.
There seems to be no statute of the Uni
ted States which provides for the punish
ment of a United States attorney or other
officer of. the government who corruptly
agrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully re
frain from doing any act when the consid
eration for such corrupt agreement Is oth
er than one possessing mouey value. This
ought to be remedied by appropriate legis
lation. Legi8latin shuld also be enacted
to cover, explicitly, unequivocally and be
yond question, breach of trust In the shape
of prematurely divulging official secrets by
au officer or employe of the United States,
and to provide a suitable penalty therefor.
Condition of Public Land iswu.
Once again I call your attention to the
condition of the public land laws. Recent
developments have given new urgency to
the need for such changes as will fit these
laws to actual present conditions. The
honest disposal and right use of the re
maining public lands is of fundamental im
portance. The iniquitous methods by which
the monopolizing of the public lands IS be
ing brought about under the present laws
are becoming more generally known, but
the existing laws do not furnish effective
remedies. The recommendation of the pub
lic lands .commission upon this subject are
wise aud should be given effect.
The creation of small irrigated farms un
der the reclamation-act is. a. powerful, offset
to the tendency of certain other laws to
foster or, permit monopoly of' the I&ni),
The greater part of the remaining 'public
lands cannot be Irrigated. They are, at
present and will probably always be of
greater value for grazing than for any
other purpose. This fact has led to tho
grazing homestead of C40 acres lu Nebras
ka .and to the.proposed extension.of it to
other1 States. It' Is argiied that a family
cannot be supported on 100 acres of arid
graaing lands This 1* obviously true but
neither can a family be supported on 640
acres of iriuch (if the land to which It Is
proposed to apply the grazing homestead.
To establish universally any such arbitrary
limit would be unwise at the present time.
Merchant' Marine Indlapenaable.
To the spread of our trade in peace ar.d
the defense of our flag in war a great and
prosperous merchant marine is indispensa
ble. Wc should have ships of our own aud
seamen of our own to convey our goods to
neutral markets, and in case of need to re
inforce our battle line.
Pensions for Civil War Soldiers.
It is a matter of unmixed satisfaction
once more to call attention to the excellent
work of the pension bureau for the veter
ans of the Civil War have a greater claim
upon us than any other class of our citi
zens. To them, first of all among our peo
ple, honor is due. Seven years ago my la
mented predecessor, President McKinley,
stated that the time had come for the na
tion to csre for the graves of the Confed
erate dead. 1 recommend that the Con
gress take action toward this end.
The Immigration Queatlon.
The question of Immigration Is of vital
Interest to this country. In the year end
ing June 30, 1905, there came to the United
States 1,026,000 alien immigrants. It is
clearly shown In the report of the com
missioner general of Immigration that
while much of this enormous Immigration
Is undoubtedly healthy and natural, a con
siderable proportion is undesirable from
one reason or another moreover, a consid
erable proportion of It, probably a very
large proportion, including most of the un
desirable class, does not come here of its
own Initiative, but because of the activity
of the agents of the great transportation
companies.
We c'annot have too much immigration
of the right sort, and we should have none
whatever of the wrong sort. Of course It
is desirable that eveii the right kind of im
migration should be properly distributed in
this country. Wc need more of such immi
gration for the South and special effort
should be made to secure It. In actual
practice it has proved .so difficult to en
force the Immigration laws where long
stretches of frontier marked by an imagin
ary line alone intervene between us and
our neighbors that 1 recommend that no
immigrants be allowed to come lu from
Canada and Mexico, save "natives of the
two countries themselves. As much as pos
sible should be done to distribute the immi
grants upon the land and keep them away
from the congested tenement-house dis
tricts of the great cities. But distribution
is a palliative, not a cure. The prime
need is to keep out all Immigrants who
will not make good American citizens.
The laws now existing for the exclusion
of undesirable Immigrants should be
strengthened. Adequate means should be
adopted, and enforced by sufficient penal
tics, to compel steamship companies en
gaged In the passenger business to observe
in good faith the law which forbids tbem
to encourage or solicit Immigration to the
United States. Provision should be made
for the surer punishment of those who In
duce aliens to come to this country under
promise or assurance ot employment. It
should be made possible to inflict a suffi
ciently heavy penalty on any employer vio
lating this law to deter him from taking
the risk. It seems to me wise that there
should be an international conference held
to deal with this question of Immigration,
which, has more than a merely national
significance.
The questions arising in connection with
Chinese Immigration stand by themselves.
The conditions in China arc such that the
entire Chinese coolie class, that Is, the
class of Chinese laborers, skilled and un
skilled, legitimately come under the bead
of undesirable immigrants to this country,
because of their numbers, the low wages
for which they work, aud their low stand
ard of living. Not only Is It to the
interest of this country to keep them
out, but the Chinese authorities do
not desire thnt they should be ad
mitted. At present their entrance Is
prohibited by laws amply adequate to
accomplish this purpose. But In tile effort
to carry out the policy of excluding Chi
nese laborers, Chinese coolies, grave Injus
tice and wrong have been done by this
nation to the people of China, und there
fore ultimately to this uation Itself. Chi
nese students, business and professional
men of all kinds—not only merchants,' but
bankers, doctors, manufacturers, professors,
travelers and the like—should be encour
aged to come here and treated on precisely
the same footing that we treat students,
business men, travelers and the like of
other nations. Our laws and treaties should
be framed, not .so as to put these people
in the excepted classes, but to state that
we will admit all Chinese, except Chinese
of the coolie class, Chinese skilled or un
skilled laborers.
Much trouble has come during tlie past
summer front the organized boycott against
American goods which has been started lu
China. The main factor In producing this
boycott has been the resentment felt by
the students and business people of China,
by all the Chinese leaders, against the
harshness of our law toward educated
Chinamen of the professional and business
classes. This government has the friendli
est feeling for China and desires China's
well-being. We cordially sympathize with
the announced purpose of Japan to stand
for the Integrity of China. Such an atti
tude tends to tho peace of the world.
Adulteration of Foods.
I recommend that law be ennetort to
regulate Interstate commerce In mlsbrand
ed and adulterated foods, drinks, and drugs.
Such law would protect legitimate manu
facture and commerce, and would tend to
secure the boalth and welfare of the con
suming public. Traffic in foodstuffs which
have been debased or adulterated so as t'o
Injure health or -in deceive purchasers
should be forbidden.
National Parks and Slow Pl.accs.
I call your attention to the generous act
of the State of California in conferring
upon the United States government the
ownership' of the Yosemite Valley and the
Mariposa Big Tree grove. There should lie
no delay in accepting the gift, and appro
priations should be made for the Including
thereof In the l'oscmlte National 1'ark, aud
for the care aud policing of the park. Cal
ifornia has acted most wisely as well as
with great magnanimity in the matter.
There are certain mighty natural features
of our land which should be preserved lii'
perpetuity for our children and onr chil
dren's children. In my judgment the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado should be, made
Into a national park. It Is greatly to be
wished thnt the State of New l'ork should
copy as regards Niagara what the State of
California.has done as regaMs tlie Yosem
ite. Nothing should be allowed to Interfere
with the preservation of Niagara Falls ill
all their beauty and majesty.
Pensions for Life-Savcrs.
I call your especially attention to the de
sirability of giving to the members of the
llfcsavliig service pensions such as are giv
en to firemen aud policemen in all our great
cities. It li unjust for a great nation itkt
permit th
disabled or to meet death In the perform
thi9 to permit these men to become total)
once of their hazardous duty aud yet to give
them no sort of reward.
The Philippine Ialnnda.
During the past year the Philippine Isl
ands have been slowly recovering froii
the series of disasters which, since Ameri
can occupation, have greatly reduced ths
amount of agricultural products below
what was produced lu Spanish times. Ths
war, the rinderpest, the locusts, the
drought, and the cholera have been united
as causes to prevent a return of the pros
perity much needed In the islands. The
Income of the Philippine government has
necessarily been reduced ly reason of the
business and agricultural depression In the
lBlands, and the government has been
obliged to exercise great economy, to cut
down Its expenses, to reduce salaries, and
In every way to avoid a deficit. It
has adopted an Internal-revenue law
Imposing taxes on cigars, cigarettes,
and distilled liquors, and abolishing
the old Spanish Industrial taxes. Ths
come derived from It has partly made up
for the reduction in customs revenue. There
lias been a mnrked increase in the number
of Filipinos employed in the civil service,
and a corresponding decrease In the num
ber of Americans.
Improvements of barbors, roads, and
bridges continue, although the cutting down
of the revenue forbids the expenditure of
any great amount from current Income for
these purposes. Disturbances have all now
been suppressed, and It is hoped that with
these lessons local governments can be
formed which will secure quiet and peace
to the deserving inhabitants. The inci
dent is another proof ot the fact that If
there has been any error as regards giving
self-government hi the Philippines It has
been in the direction of giving it too quick
ly, not too slowly.
The agricultural conditions of the Islands
enforce more strongly than ever the argu
ment in favor of reducing the tariff on the
products of the Philippine Islands enterln
the United States. 1 earnestly recoinmen
that the tariff how Imposed by the DIngloy
bill upon the products of the Philippine Isl
ands be entirely removed, except the tariff
on suga^, and tobacco, and tbnt that tariff
be reduced to 25 per ccnt of the present
rattfs under' the Dirtgley act that after
July 1,-' 1009, the. tariff upon tobacco and
sugar produced in the Philippine Islnndg
be entirely, removed, and that free trade
betweeli. tM lslabds' and the United States
in- the products of each country then be
provided for by law.
Problems of Hawaii.
In my judgment Immediate steps should
be taken for the fortification of Hawaii.
This is the most important point in the Pa
cific to fortify in order to conserve the In
terests of this country. Hawaii is too heav
ily taxed. Laws should be enacted setting
aside for a period of, say, twenty years, 75
per cer.t of the Internal revenue and cus
toms receipts from Hawaii as a special fund
to be expended in the islands for educa
tional and public buildings, and for harbor
Improvements and military and naval de
fenses. Hawaii has serious commercial and
Industrial problems to reckon with but no
measure of relief can be considered which
looks to legislation admitting Chinese and
restricting them by statute to field labor
and domestic service. The status of ser
vility can never again be tolerated on Amer
ican soil.
Porto Rlcan Affairs.
I cnrncstly advocate the adoption of leg
islation which will explicitly confer Amer
ican citizenship on all citizens of Porto
Ilico. The problems and needs ot the island
arc industrial aud commercial rather than
political.
Insular Affairs In General.
I wish also to call the attention of the
Congress to one question which affects
our insular possessions generally name
ly, the need of an Increased liberality in
the treatment of the whole franchise
question. in these Islands. Iu the proper
desire to prevent the Islands being ex
ploited by speculators aud to have
them develop In the Interest of their
own people an error has been made In re
fusing to grant sufficiently liberal terms to
Induce the Investment ot American capital
in the Philippines and iu Porto Rico. We
hare been paying all possible heed to the
political and educational interests of the
islands,. but, important though these ob
jects are, ft Is not less important that we
should favor their Industrial development.
Admlsalon to Statehood.
I recommend thnt Indian Territory and
Oklahoma be admitted as one State and
that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted
as one State. There is no justification for
further delay and the advisability of mak
ing the four territories Into two States has
been clearly established.
The Panama Canal.
The treaty between the United States
and the Republic of Panama, under which
the construction of the Panama canal was
made possible, went Into effect with its
ratification by the United States Senate
on Feb. 23, 1904, The canal properties of
the French Canal Company were trans
ferred to the United States on April 23,
1904, on payment of $40,000,000 to that
company. Active work In canal construc
tion,' mainly preparatory, has been In
progress for less than a year and a half.
During that period two points about the
canal have ceased to be open to debate.
First, the question of route the canal will
be built on the Isthmus of Panama. Sec
ond, the question of feasibility there are
no physical obstacles on this route that
American engineering skill will not be able
to overcome without serious difficulty, or
that will prevent the completion or the
canal within a reasonable time and at a
reasonable cost.
The point which remains unsettled Is the
question of type, whether the canal shall
be one of several locks above sea level, or
at sea level with a single tide lock. On
this point I hope to lay before the Con
gress at an early day the findings of the
advisory board of American and European
engineers, thnt at my luvitation have been
considering the subject, together with ths
report of the commission thereon and such
comments thereon or recommendations In
reference thereto as may seem necessary.
The American people nre pledged to the
speediest possible construction of a canal
adequate to meet the dsmands which the
commerce of the worlti Will make upon It,
and I appeal most earnestly to the Con
gress to nld in the fulfillment of the
pledge. Gratifying progress has been
made during the past year and especially
durlug the past four months. The greater
part of the necessary preliminary work
has been done. Actual work of excavation
could be begun only on a limited scale till
the canal zone was made a healthful place
to live in and to work in. Tlie Isthmus had
to be sanitated first. This task has been
so thoroughly accomplished that yellow
fever has been virtually extirpated from
the Isthmus and general health conditions
vastly Improved.
In addition to sanitating tho Isthmus,
satisfactory quarters are being provided
for employes and an adequate system
of supplying them with wholesome
food at reasonable prices has been
created. Hospitals have been estab
lished and equipped that are with
out superiors of their kind anywhere.
Purine the past year a large portion of
the plnnt with which the work Is to be
done has been ordered. It is confidently
believed that by the middle of the ap
proaching year a sufficient proportion of
this plant will have been Installed to en
able us to resume the work of excavation
on a large scale.
What is needed now and without delay is
an appropriation by the Congress to meet
the current and nccrulng expenses of the
commission. The first appropriation of ilO,
000,000, out of the $135,000,001) authorized
by the Spoouer act. was made three years
ago. It Is nearly exhausted. There Is
harclv enough of It remaining to carry the
commission to the end of the year. Un
less the Congress shall appropriate before
that tlniR all work must cease, and there
will be demoralization of the forces, here
anil on the isthmus, now working so har
moniously and effectively. If there Is delay
In granting au emergency appropriation.
The Department of State.
I recommend more adequate provision
than has been made heretofore for the work
of the department of state. Within a few
rears there has been a very great Increase
'in the amount aud importance of the work
lo he (lone by that department, both In
Washington and abroad. Neither nt home
nor abroad is there a sufficient working
force to do the business properly. Our
consular force should bo classified, and ap
pointments should be made to the several
classes, with authority to the executive to
assign the members of cacli class to duty
at such posts as the Interests of tlie serv
ice require, instead of the appointments be
ing made as nt present to specified posts.
Sufficient provision should be made for a
clerical force In every cousulute, composed
entirely of Americans, Instead of the in
sufficient provision now made, which com
pels the employment of great numbers of
citizens of foreign countries whose serv
ices can be obtained for less money.
Suitable provision should be made for the
expense of keeping our diplomatic officers
more fully Informed of what Is being done
from day to day In the progress of our
diplomatic affairs with other countries.
The lock of such Information, caused by
insufficient, appropriations available for ca
ble tolls and for clerical aud messenger
service, frequently puts our officers at a
great disadvantage and detracts from their
usefulness.
