the purpose of starting it, she took a
lighted caudle with lier. She placed the
candle on the floor near the store and

for Isaac Kighter, corner of Ninth and
Market streets, was returning home from
Newport where he had been during the

with an accident which proved fatal to
the horse that he was driving. The
horse was a new one and after lie had
left Newport it became restless until
reaching Richardson's llill, when it be
came unmanageable and started down
tlie steep declivity at a break neck speed.
When near tlie bottom it stumbled and
fell, throwing Mr. Carswell out, hurting
him around the shoulders and scratching
his face. When Mr. Carswell recovered
from the shock he went to the horse and
found it dead. The wagon was

Good Sermons.—At Union M. E. Church,
yesterday morning, Rev. J. B. Mann d3
livered a caustic sermon, or rather an
address, taking for his text tne Church
Discipline. He referred in scathing
terms to the many violations of the
moral and religious code which are daily
being perpetrated in this community by
nu mbers of the Christian Church, and
dwelt with particular severity upon the
sin of drunkenness to which some church
members were addicted. He strongly
urged those whose feet were wandering
from the straight and narrow path to
turn at once before the gates of salvation
were closed. In the sermon no personal
allusions were made, and though doubts
less many persons writhed with an in
ward consciousness of guilt, those whose
consciences were elear could gladly ex
claim, "Let the galled jade wince; our
withers are unstrung."
In the evening the reverend gentle
man preached in relation to the seces
sion of Methodists to the "Household of
Faith," and made a strong argument in
favor of a strict adherence to the doc
trines and decipline of the Methodist
Church. Both discourses were listened
to by large congregations.
Rev- T.C. Killiam, of Aßbury Church,
also preached from the Church Discip
line, Sunday morning, and coupled his
warnings and admonitions with words
of good advioe.
An intersting meeting was held in the
City Mission, on Second street, near
Washington, last night, at which Capt.
Albert Thatcher made an effective ad"
dress.
The Fmir at Odd Feileres* Hall .—The
fair that is now being held at the Odd
Fellows' Hall under the auspices of the
American Rifles was
dry evening by over four hundred per~
sons. The arrangement of the tables
upon which the articles are exposed for
sale is excellent. There are six ta
bles three on the east Bide, and three on
the west side, and they are handsomely
trimmed with cedar and evergreens,
while surmounting the arch is a shield
bearing the word''welcome." In the re
cess ocuupird by the stage is the refresh
ment table. The front of the balcony
is trimmed with bunting, and there are
several pointings hung up. Mr- Eli
Crozier also has a table, upon which
exposed a number of useful, as well as
ornamental articles for sale. The fair
deserves the patronage of the public, as
the company desires to purchase over
coa s for use upon occasions of parades
during winter weather.

THIRD EDITION.
THE PRESIDENT'S MES8AGE.
The annual message of President Hayes
will be sent in to Congress to-day. It is
said the following are the points of the
President's message : It first treats of
Southern affairs, reciting the action of
President in the States of Louisiana and
South Carolina, arguing the wisdom ot
his course and saying that ills action wan
necessary, Constitutional and right ; that
the efiect in these States has been good
that peace has been restored,public credit
has improved and outrages nave ceased.
The President believes in a silver and
gold currency and condemns any attempt
to impair the obligations of the govern
ment by a failure to pay them in gold
and the substitution of silver or green <
backs. It is strong on this subject, but
gives no indications of the extent to.
which he favors silver, whether a legal
tender for a greater or less amount,
refers to the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury, and approves the recom
mendations of Mr. Sherman, and it is
very certain the financial views of the
two gentlemen are very much alike.
On the subject of foreign affairs the
President says that peace exists between
tlie United States and all foreign natious
He devotes considerable space to the
Mexican frontier troubles, recites the
condition of affairs that led to the cele
brated order to General Ord and defends
tne order on the ground that it was nec
essary to preserve tlie lives of America»
citizens. Nothing that the administra
tion has done was done with hostile or
warlike intentions, hut it is pretty clearly
intimated that if War comes it will not
be declined on the part of the Unitea
States.
On the question of civil service the
message is briefer than might have been
expected.

Munioay —This morning a horse at
tached to a wagon belonging to C. Knit
tie, baker, corner of Third und Jeflersoa
streets, was left standing for a few mom
ents in Tacnall street above Fourth,while
Mr. Knittle was engaged in serving bread
to his customers in that neighborhood.
During his absence the horse became
frightened, and started up Tatnall street
on a run. When just above Fifth Chas.
Carrlgan, endeavored to stop the horse,
but missing tlie rein he caught the shaft
and held on for a short dtstance when he
was thrown to the ground, and both
wheels passed over his lower limbs.
The horse continued on up 7atnalt
street, at an increased speed, and upon
reaching Seventh, ran into a milk wagon
standing there, spilling considerable
milk, aud breaking the shafts of the milk
wagon. After having done the above
damag« the frightened animal continu«*
on up the street, and when between
Eighth and Ninth spilled a considerable
quantity of bread and pies in the street,
which were eagerly gathered up by the
children. The horse was stopped up
town, and the damage done was com.
paratiyely slight.

last night, or this morning, thieves broke
into tire freight house of the Dclawaio Wes

some valuable goods. No clue of tire,

actively working up the case.
