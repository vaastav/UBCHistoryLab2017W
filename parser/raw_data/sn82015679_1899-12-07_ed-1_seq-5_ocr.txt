The games between the Blue Labels and
the Columbias, In the Tenpin Aeague last
night, were very Interesting, as high scores
were made by both teams, and the Colum
bias gave the strong Blue Labels a hard
run for victory. The top-notchers, ' how
ever, had recovered from the shock ad
ministered to them last week by the Calu
mets, and they succeeded in taking three
straight games. All of the scores made by
both teams were up to or above the eight
hundred mark. Knox, of the Blue Labels,
rolled the high score, with 224.
The Nationals took two of the three
games from the Stars by good margins.
The Standards succeeded In taking one of
the two games from the Meridians. The
Calumets did not roll In as good form as
they did last week, and in the second game
last night they were defeated by the Lenox
team. The first contest was vt ry exciting
because of the close score, the Calumets
winning by a margin of only four pins.
The individual scores were:

AFTER BIG CONVENTION
ItEPlIlLICAN NATIONAL. GATHERING
TO BE INVITED TO THE CITY.
Secretary "Woollen, of the Commer
cial Club, Will Leave for Wash
ington .This SIornlnK.
A movement Is on foot to secure the next
national Republican convention for Indian
apolis, and Secretary v oollen, of the Com
mercial Club, will leave this morning for
Washington to present the claims of this
city to the national executive committee.
This move was decided on at a meeting
of the Commercial Club's committee on as
semblages, held yesterday afternoon. The
members of the committee, whlch Is. com
posed of Mayor Taggart, T. J. Culen. of
the Denison; Henry W. Lawrence, of the
Bates; H. M. Bronson, assistant general
passenger agent of the Big Four, and W.
W. Richardson, district passenger agent of
the Pennsylvania, were all present, with
the exception of Mr. Richardson, and de
cided that, inasmuch as cities of no greater
size had had the convention, and as Indian
apolis, in proportion to its population, had
the best hotel accommodations In the coun
try, it was entitled to ask for the next con
vention. The matter of selecting a place for hold
ing the convention rests entirely with the
national executive committee, of which
Mark Hajina Is chairman, and the commit
tee decided that the quickest way to ascer
tain whether Indianapolis could secure the
convention was to send Mr. Woollen to
Washington to learn what inducements the
city would be compelled to offer to se
cure it.
Mr. Woollen's first visit will be made to
Senator Fairbanks, who will be asked to
use his lniluence with Chairman Iianna to
secure consideration for this city. If It Is
found, however, that, as Is sometimes the
case, the location has already been decided
on, the matter will be dropped, but if not
this city will make a strong bid for It.
Along with the project of securing the
national Republican convention the com
mittee considered the idea of making appli
cation for the next convention of the Na
tional Manufacturers' Association, which
meets In Boston in January, when the
meeting place for 1901 will be decided on.
In speaking of the prospects of securing
the Republican convention, T. J. Cullen, of
the Denison. said last night that this city
could easily take care of 15,000 visitors, and
It was estimated that this would be the
number who might be expected on such an
occasion. Of course, he said, it was ex
pected that there would be others who
were not legitimately connected with the
convention, but who would attend it. an'd
these could also be looked after without
any trouble.
BODY IS IDENTIFIED
WILHEOI IS PLEASED
a that of Samuel Nixon, a Lebanon
Junk Dealer.
The body of the man who was found dead
on the Big Four track), near the bridge In
the rear of Kingan & Co.'s Sunday morn
ing, was Identified yesterday as that of
Samuel Nixon, of Lebanon. The identifi
cation was made by Mrs. Isabel Hamilton,
316 West Chesapeake street, who knew him
and his family at Lebanon. Nixon came
to Indianapolis Saturday with a load of
Junk, which he disposed of and then began
drinking. Mrs. Hamilton's brother last saw
him Saturday evening, and assisted him to
put up his horse and wagon at the Big
Kour livery stable.
. He leaves a wife and three children. The
body will be taken to Lebanon this morn
ing for burial. The coroner has investi
gated the case, and the detectives are try
ing to locate the two men who told the
watchman at the. bridge that a dead man
was lying on the track a short distance
away, thinking possibly there may have
been foul play. The men, it is claimed,
were tough-looking characters, and the oc
casion for Nixon being in that neighbor
hood at so early an hour has not been ex
plained. He had no money on his person
when found.
IN ORIENTAL COSTUMES.
Members of the First Baptist Church
Aid a Lecturer.
The Oriental entertainment given last
night at the First Baptist Church was a
rather novel one in the way of illustrat
ing a lecture. Mr. Phares A. Behannesey,
a young Turk who has been in this coun
try fr a couple of years taking a theolog
ical course at the Northwestern University,
is taking this means of earning money to
take him back to his native country, where
he is to act as a missionary. The altar
railing was very tastefully decorated with
Oriental tapestries. About forty members
of the congregation, who were dressed in
tho native costume of the different coun
tries under the Turkish rule, sat about the
railing, and as Mr. Behannesey delivered
his talk he would pick out the person
dressed as the one he was describing and
In this manner he delighted the audience
with a very instructive lecture on the cus
toms of his native land.
BOARDING-HOUSE FIRE.
The People In the House Escape In
Their Nlsnt Clothes.
Last night about 11 o'clock a fire was
discovered in the house of Mrs. Tuttle, at
616 North Meridian street. At first It looked
very serious, but was confined to the roof
and extinguished with a loss of about 11.200.
The cause of the fire is unknown, but it
was thought that it might have traveled
along the rafters from a defective flue to
the cornice. Tho house is a double one.
and Is occupied by Miss Emma Hudson,
who will suffer a considerable loss from
water. Had It not been for the cook, who
smelUd the smoke, there might have been
some serious consfquences, and as it was
the inmates were forced to escape in their
night clothes.

PRESIDENT M'KIXLEY'S 3IESSAGD
LIKED BY THE EMPEROR.
Ills German Majesty May Publicly
Voice Ills Satisfaction at Amer
ica's Friendly Attitude.
STATEMENT BY VON BUEI0W
HE SAYS THE MESSAGE HAS CREA
TED A GOOD IMPRESSION,
And that the Sympathies Exhibited
by McKluley Are Sincerely Re
ciprocated by Germans.
BERLIN, Dec. 6. The German govern
ment and rress almost unanimously wel
come President McKinley's message to
Congress. Even the Agtarian papers, al
ways ooposed to things American, grudg
ingly admit that the message is fair and
honest. The drift of private comment is
virtually the same. In the lobby of the
Reichstag to-day similar sentiments were
expressed without reserve by members of
every shade of politics.
Emperor William, it is reliably reported,
had a long consultation this afternoon
with Count Von Buelow, the foreign min
ister, and expressed himself as very much
pleased with Fresident McKinley's attitude
towards Germany. It is also reported that
his Majesty discussed the best mode of
giving official voice to the feeling of the
crown and government. In any event, on
Dec. 12, the day fixed for the first read
ing of the budget. Count Von Buelow will
seize the opportunity of showing Ger
many's high appreciation of the friendly
tone of the message.
Late this afternoon Count Von Buelow
authorized the Associated Press corre
spondent in Berlin to send to the United
States 4he following as his impression of
the message: "Count Von Buelow regards
the message as an enunciation memorable
in the development of German-American
friendship. The warm tone in which the
President speaks of our mutual relations
has created here the best impression, and
one may be sure that tho sympathies ex
hibited by the. Iresldent for Germany are
here sincerely reciprocated. Politically
everything between the two countries is
se.ene and there is nothing that disturbs
the entente cordiale. Economically con
sidered, the contents and tone of the mes
sage strengthen the hope that the United
States, with their increasing, exports to
Germany, will make fair concessions to
German trade and that the reciprocity
negotiations will be further conducted in a
friendly spirit to a good end."
The press particularly lejolccs at the an
nouncement regarding alliances, despite
many previous assertions to the same ef
fect. The semi-otlicial Berliner Post says:
"President McKinley has put a stop to
such rumors and guesses and has placed
in lieu of fiction the solid fact that the
relations between the United States and
Germany are of the most cordial charac
ter. His message will not fall to produce
by its pacific tone the best effects eve.y
where, and not least in Germany. Form
erly we were accustomed to meet every
where a broad inimical attitude towards our
colonizing elforts, but President McKin
ley's words Indicate that he knows and
appreciates Germany's cultural mission
and is ready to assist."
The Vosslsche Zeltung says: "Experience
has taught us, although we gratefully ac
knowledge the present warm tone of Presi
dent McKinley's message, that Uncle Sam
is as quick to hate as to love, and too often
in the past he has allowed himself to be
prejudiced against us by his cousin on this
side of the Atlantic."
Discussing the meat problem the Vos
slsche Zeltung: welcomes the proposed com
mission of experts, inferring that this will
be in the interest of cheaper meat and
food here and welcomes also the contin
uance of friendly relations with the United
States.
The Berliner Tageolatt, which discusses
the message chiefly In its economical as
pects, concludes as follows: "We heartily
join In the wish that this fair spirit may
dominate In the treatment of all controver
sial points, which will show that a genuine
effort is being made to regulate German
American relations."
The Boersen Courier says: "It is signifi
cant that a President's message, probably
for the first time, should devote so much
space to foreign affairs. The improvement
in German-American relations Is largely at
tributable to the skill of Count Von Bue
low." The Nord Deutche Allegemeine Zeitunt
and Kolnlsche Zeltung briefly record theh
satisfaction with the message.
The Kreuz Zeltung, the Deutsche Tagct
Zeltung and the Stattsbuerger Zeltung ex
press joy that the alleged alliance does
not exist.
The Boersen Zeltung says: "We can un
restrainedly declare our satisfaction, hop
ing that times will not return when Ameri
can policy will glide into paths leading to
unnatural discord between two nations."
Cubans Satisfied.
HAVANA. Dc. 6.-President McKinley's
message to Congress has been received by
Cubans of all classes with much satisfac
tion. Even the leaders of the extreme par
ty admit this, and the announcement that
there will be no American civil governor
has cleared away most of the clouds that
have been "hanging over the Cuban politi
cal situation. The Lucha alone, among the
papers, still favors a civil governorship.
General Collazo says: "The message will
pacify the country. President McKinley's
statements are not very concrete, but If
Congress guarantees the Independence of
Cuba we need not ask for any specification
as" to the time for the removal of the Amer
ican troops, although everybody would be
glad to see the black troops go, because of
the excesses they commit. Cubans fear the
administration, but they do not fear Con
gress. The administration represents the
trusts. Although Cubans are as good busi
ness men as Americans, they could not
compete with the enormous power of the
trusts, which, by creating monopolies,
ould eventually enslave the workingman.
We wish to see each man own some prop
erty; af least enough to make it worth
while to behave as a good citizen should,
instead of going to the woods."
POrE LEO ILL AGAIN.
Ills Holiness In Bed, Suffering from
a Sudden Cold.
ROME, Dec. 6. The Pope Is suffering
from a sudden cold and experiences some
difficulty in breathing. Dr. Lapponl, his
physician, has ordered him to be kept in
bed, and the usual audiences have been
suspended. The condition of his Hollns.
however, is not regarded as alarming.
Spaniards to Re Recognised.
MADRID, Dec. C.-In the Chamber of
Deputies to-day President Silvela an
nounced that as a result of the representa
tions of the government of Spain, the
United States government had Instructed
its authorities in Cuba, the Philippines and
Porto Rico to recognize the nationality of
Spaniards in these places.
Anxiety for Count Tolntol.
LONDON, Dec. 7. A special dispatch
from Berlin says that Count Tolstoi has
been seriously ill. For two days he was
unconscious, but ha Is now slightly better,
although, great anxiety Is still manifested
in Moscow regarding him.

by the House officials, and will not directly
arise until the January pay certificates are
issued by Speaker Henderson, by which
time It is expected the case will be per
manently settled. Mr. Roberts drew his pay
up to Dec. 3, the day before Congress as
sembled, on the certificate of Clerk Mc
Dowell that he was a member-elect.
Representative Tayler, chairman ot tho
special committee to Investigate the case of
Mr. Roberts, has called a meeting of the
committee for 11 o'clock to-morrow rrornlng.
Mr. Tayler says this initial meeting will
be to determine on a general line of action.
He could not say how soon the committee
would be able to report. While the chair
man would not speak for the committee, he
said he had no doubt that Mr. Roberts
would be allowed to be present, with coun
sel, if he desired, and would be afforded the
usual facilities to have his side presented.
There are a number of witnesses in Wash
ington and some In Utah, but it Is probable
the committee will not leave Washington.
Mr. Roberts was about the House during
the day. There was no session and he was
engaged most of the time in chatting with
groups of members and visitors who showed
a friendly disposition toward him. He said
he had no comment to make on the course
of the House. He will probably look after
his interests In person before the commit
tee of Inquiry. To a New York newspaper
he made this statement last night:
The action of the House to-day In my
case was not a surprise to me. The whole
matter was evidently prejudged and the
minds of members were made up to follow
the course that had been outlined. When
the question comes to be considered by
members of the House after the pressure
ot public opinion is removed I think the
case will stand as a vicious violation of
the well-established precedents which have
fixed the frules of the House. The founda
tion is now laid for confusion, chaos and
revolution in the organization of the House
and the rights of members therein. A pre
cedent ha been established which will yet
excuse the same denial of rights to a Ro
man Catholic, a Presbyterian, an agnostic
or any one who may be unfortunate enough
to stand under condemnation ot a popular
centiment lashed Into a frenzy by misrep
resentation and falsehood, as in my in
stance. I was met at the very bar of the
House and denied the protection granted
by the rules of that body and the Constitu
tion of the United States because I was a
menrber of an unpopular church, against
which there rests a sectarian hate. The
matter of denying me the right to be sworn
In Is in Itself not a very Important matter,
so far as affecting me personally Is con
cerned, but it is a Jact that the right of
representation of a sovereign State has
been denied by this action to-day. I have
not yet formed any plans concerning what
course I will follow before the committee.
I shall devote my attention to it assidu
ously, for by no means do I consider my
case lost."
If Mr. Rdberts is finally rejected by the
House of Representatives, as seems In
evitable, there Is a possibility that he may
come forward as a claimant for a seat In the
Senate. ,
His rejection by the House, It Is expected,
will add to his popularity in Utah, and it Is
suggested that if Mr. Quay Is seated by
the Senate the Democratic Governor of Utah
may appoint Mr. Roberts to fill the vacancy
that exists In Utah's representation in that
body.
RESOLUTION OF INQUIRY.
Senator Ilavrllna Wants the Polyga
my Matter Investigated.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.-In the Senate
to-day Mr. Rawlins, of Utah, presented a
resolution providing for a full Investiga
tion of alleged polygamous practices In
the United States and whether the Presi
dent has appointed polygamlsts to federal
offices. It was referred to the judiciary
committee. The resolution reads:
"That the committee on Judiciary Is
hereby instructed to inquire into and re
port to the Senate: i
"First To what extent polygamy Is
practiced, or polygamist marriages entered
into In the United States or in places over
which they have Jurisdiction.
"Second Have polygamlsts or persons re
puted to have more than one wife been
elected to office by the people of Utah, and
if so. has such election been for the pur
pose of encouraging polygamy or In viola
tion of any compact between said State
and the United States.
"Third Have polygamlsts or persons re
puted to have more than one wife been ap
pointed to office by the President, by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate,
or In cases where the concurrence of the
Senate Is not required, and if so. have such
appointments been made In aid of polyg
amy or in violation of the compact be
tween the United States and the State of
Utah with reference to that subject.
"Fourth Whit, If any, steps should be
taken or measures enacted for the preven
tion of polygamy In the United States or In
places over which they have Jurisdiction?"
Dlshop Doane's Views.
NEW YORK, Dec. 6. The convention for
conference and action on the Christian
principles ot civil government, called by the
National Reform Association, met at the
Broadway Tabernacle to-day, a number of
addresses being made by the prominent
clergymen and reformers.
Bishop Doane, of Albany, N. Y., spoke on
"Our Marriage and Divorce Laws Their
Danger and Remedy." In an allusion to
the challenging of Congressman-elect Rob
erts, Bishop Doane said: 'The vote In
Washington yesterday, whose parliamen
tary propriety is technically questionable.
Is nevertheless a wholesome Indication of a
moral atmosphere In a place where ordinSr
Hy good ventilation does not reach our
iiouse or uepresenianves in Washington. '
