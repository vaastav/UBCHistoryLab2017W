Einancipatfon Proclamation and
h imployment of negro troopi.
Let us look at thai a moment, lne
ProcUmatioa was. ia fact, isanod on
the S2d ot September, 1863. Iu Oc
tober an J' qveraber following, the
Democrats earned all. the election,
being greatly' aided fn so doina: by
tho unpopularity of said Porclama
tioni - The party of the President lias
carried the elections in 1863;' but the
Proclamation, bo far from helping to
that end, was a drawback npon it.
Before the Proclamation was issued
UlcClellan ' was within Bight of Rich
mond and wo had fought asovere
battle in the -center of Mississippi.
Ilave we advanced further iu either
direction since the Proclamation was
.'.'Th Proeldent alalins that of those
who were slaves at ' the beginning of
the rebellion, fnlljr oue hundred thou
sand are now in the United 'S rates
military . service, about one half of
whom are in the ranks; So far as
tested, the President think the ne
groes make as good soldiers aa the
whitest The President then enters
into u defense of the Negro Procla
mation, lie declares that ho will
not retract or modify tho Proclama
tion while he remains in his present
position. Hear him.
''When Congress assembled a year
ago tho war bad already lasted nearly
twenty months, and tliore had been
many conflicts on both land and sea,
with vatying results. The rebellion
had been pressed back into reduced
limits ; yet the tone of public feeling
aod op:nion at homa and abroad wan
not satisfactory. With othor signs,
tho popular elections then just past
indicated uneasiness among ourselv
es. while amid much that was cold
and menacing, the kind words coming
from England were utterod in acceats
of pity that we were too blind to sur
render Our comraer'co was snffer
inr greatly by a few armed vessels
built upon and furnished from foreign
sh'ires, and we were threatened with
such additions from the same quarter
as would sweep our trade trom the
sea and raise our blockade, vve had
failed to elicit from European Gov
ern men ta any thing hopeful upon
this subject. .
Tho Emancipation Proclamation,
which was issued in September, was
running its assigned period to the be
ginning of the ntw year. ' A month
later, iho final proclamation came, in
eluding the annonncement that color
ed men of suitable condition wonld
he received into the war service. The
policy of emancipation and of the
employment of black soldiers gave tu
the future it new aspect, about which
hopes, fears, and dabts Contended in
uncertain conflict, according to' our
politjuHl system, as n matter of civil
administration; The General Gov-
er'irn nt had no lawfnl p'Wurtoef-
f ct emancipation in any gtu'e, and
for i long time' it hud been' hoped
that the rchillhxi could bo suppress
ed -withoot resorting1 to it at a mili

justified by the Constitution True,
the form ot an oath is given, but no
man is coerced to take Ft. A man is
only promised a pardoa in cnte he
voluntarily takes tho oath. The Con
stitution authorizes the Executive to
grant it on such terms as are fully
e8tabiiahed by judicial and other au
thorities. It is hIso prorTered, that it,
in many ot tno stares named, a seat
f Government shall be, in the m )do
prescribed, aot ap, such Government
shall be recognized and guaranteed by
the United States, and that under it
tho State shall, on subscribing to the
constitutional conditions, be- protocted
against invasion and domestic violen
ce. The constitutional obligation of
.i it . t .i. "
tuo unitoa States to guarantee to
every State in the Union a repuhheen
form of Government, and to protect
the State in the caso us stated, is ox
plicit aud lull, but why tender the
benefits of tii s provision only to a
State Govsrnment set up in this way.
This sectiou of the Constitution con
templates a case wherein the element
within a State, favorable' to republi
can govoruoient in . tba Union, may
bo too feeble for an opposite aud hos
tile element external to and - even
within the State, aud such ara pre

and protect a revised state of govern
ment, ooDstruutea in whole or in pre
ponderating part, from the very ele
ment against whoso hostility aud vio
lence it is to be piotuctud, it simply
absurd. There must be a test, by
which to soparJte opposing elements,
so as t build only from the sound,
aud that test is a sufficient aud liberal
one, wbicli accupta as sound whoever
will make a sworn recantation of bis
former unsoundness.'
