WASHINGTON,
gress assembled for its second and final
session at noon today. Long before that
hour the galleries be?an to fill and by 11-30
all but the diplomatic and executive galler
ies were crowded. The executive gallery
was empty. On the floor pages were
distributing baskets ot flowers. The
largest decorated the desk of the presiding
officer. There were two baskets ou Senator
Beck's desk, one on Senator Blodgett's, one
on Mr. Pugh's and one on Mr. Daniel's.
Not a bud or blossom adorned the desks of
the republican senators. Mr. Stewart, of
Nevada, was the first member of
the senate to make an appear
ance on the floor. Ho was soon
joined by Mr. Chandler, Mr. Hawley and
Mr. Dolph. A few minutes later Mr.
Spooner, Mr. Aldrich, Mr. Mandorson, Mr.
Frye and Mr. Morrill came in at the left of
the cloak room and joined their colleagues
on the floor. At the same time Mr. Harris,
ot Tennessee, and Mr. Jones, of Arkansas,
appeared on the democratic side of the
chamber. As the hands of the big
senate clock moved on to the meridian
mark, the chamber rapidly tilled with
members, and a general handshaking was
going on in all of the aisles. At 13 o'clock
Senator Ingalls entered the chamber escort
ing the chaplain, Mr. Butler. When the
gavel descended there were forty-two sen
ators present. Mr. Butler's prayer was
brief. He asked for a blessing ou the presi
dent aud the presideut elect. At
the conclusion of the prayer, Mr.
Ingalls announced the senate in
session. Mr. Sherman asked if it was cus
tomary to call the roll. Mr. Ingalls said it
was not. Mr. Sherman then offered a reso
lution instructing the secretary of the
house that the senate was ready for the
transfer of business. The resolution was
adopted. The resolution offered by Mr.
Morrill, and adopted, the president pro tern,
appointed Mr. Morrill and Mr. Saulsbury a
committee to notify the president. A reso
lution offered by Mr. Cameron was adopted,
making the regular hour for assembling 12
o'clock.
The senate then went into informal re
cess to await the president's message.
At the conclusion of the recess, the usual
message from the house, am juncing the
fact of its being in session,
and of its having appointed a
committee to wait upon tlio president, was
delivered, it having been delayed in conse
quence of the recess.
That was followed by a report from the
committee to wait upou the president to
the effect that it had performed that duty,
and that the presideut would cominuuicato
in writing immediately. And then the
president's message was delivered by Mr.
l*ruden, one of his secretaries, and Mr. Mc
Cook, the secretary of Uie senate, pro
ceeded to read it.
SCENES I.N THE HOUSE.
Hppcial to the DtvPArc*
WASHINGTON-
before Speaker Carlisle at 13 o'clock today
struck his desk with a brand new gravel
and called the house to order, a scene was
presented on the floor which was
highly noisy and mirthful. The desks
of the members were nearly all
occupied and each man talked to the other
in a loud tono of voice, explaining election
iucidents and accidents, 'j hero was much
handshaking. When Mr. Itandall, looking
fairly well, entered aud took his seat, a few
minutes before 12 o'clock, ho was im
mediately surrounded and heartily con
gratulated upon his convalescence. A
splendid tloral ottering stood upon his desk,
'ihero were buskols of flowers upon the
desks of the speaker and Messrs. Springer,
Weaver, Mills, Sayers, Richardson and
others. Mrs. Cleveland and her
mother, Mrs. Folsom, occupied the
front seat of the diplomatic gallery.
The president's wife wore a tan-colored
clot!) suit and a dark brown plush hat.
The other galleries were tilled to overflow
ing. Atter the blind chaplain, the Rev. Dr.
Milburn, had offered supplication and the
reading clerk began to call the roll of the
house, the members recommenced their
chatter, continuing it while the
secretary of the senate read
the announcement that the upper
body of congress had reassembled, was
ready tor business and had appointed a
committee to act with a similar committee
on the part of the house to wait
upou and notify the president that congress
awaited his pleasure. The house then took
a recess at 1:30.
After the recess Mr. Holman announced
that the committee appointed to wait upon
the presideut had performed that duty, and
that the president would communicate with
the congress forthwith.
Mr. Pruden, one of the president's secre
taries, was then announced, and the annual
message was delivered to the house and
immediately read by the clerk.
TIIE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Congress of tho United States: As
you assemble for tlie discharge of the duties
you have assumed as the representatives of a
free and generous people, your meeting is
marked by an interesting and impressive inci
dent. With the expiration of the present ses
sion of the congress the first century of your
constitutional existence as a nation will be
completed.
Our survival for 1(10 years is not sufficient to
assure us that we no longer have dangers to
fear in the maintenance, with all its promised
blessings, of a government founded upon the
freedom of the people. The time rather ad
monishes us to soberly inquire whether in the
past we have always kept in the course
of safety, or whether we have
before us a wry plain and clear
which leads to happiness and perpetuity.
When the experiment of our government was
undertaken the charter adopted forourguid
ance was the constitution and departure from
the lines laid down. It is
only by a strict ad
herence to the direction they indicate and by
restraint within the limitations they lixed that
we can furnish proof to the world ot'tho fitness
of the American people lor self government.
The equal and exact justice of which we boast
as the underlying principle of our institutions
should not be confined to tile relations of our
citizens to each other. The government itself
is under bond to the American people, that in
the exercise of its functions and powers it will
deal with the body of our citizens in a manner
scrupulously honest and fair, and absolutely
just.
It has agreed that American citizenship shall
be the
only credential necessary to justify the
claim of equality before the law, and that no
condition lu life shall give rise to discrimina
tion in the treatment of the opposite by the
government.
The citizens of our republic in its early day
rigidly insisted upon full compliance with the
letter of this bond, and saw stretching out be
fore him a clear field for individual endeavor,
and his tribute to the support of his govern
ment was measured by the costs of its econom
ical maintenance, and he was secure in the en
joyment of the remaining recompens3 ot his
steady and contented lot. In these days the
frugality of the people was stamped upon their
government and was enforced by tbe free,
thoughtful and intelligent suffrage of the cit
izetis. Combinations, tnonoplies and aggre
galions of capital were either avoided or
sternly regulated and restrained. The pomp
and glitter of government less free ottered no
temptation and presented no delusion to
the plain people, who side by side
in friendly competition, wrought for
the ennoblement and dignity of
man for the solution of the problem of free
government and for the achievement of the
grand destiny awaiting the land which God
has given them. A century has passed. Our
cities are the abiding places of wealth and lux
ury our manufacturers yield foriunes never
dreamed of by the fathers of the republic: our
business men are madly striving in the race
for riches and immense aggregations of capital
outrun the imagination of their undertakings.
We view with pride and satisfaction this
bright picture of our country's growth and
prosperity. While only a closerscrutiny devel
ops a somber shading upon more careful in
spection we find the wealth and luxury of our
cnies mingled with poverty and wretchedness
and unrernunerative toil.
A crowded and constantly increasing urban
population suggests the impoverishment of
rural sections and discontent with agricultural
pursuits. The farmer's son, not satisfied with
his father's simple and laborious life, joins the
larger chase for easily acquired wealth.
FORMATION OK CLASSES.
We discover that the foriunes realized by our
manufacturers lire no longer solely by reward
of
Dec. 3.—The Fiftieth con­
sturdy industry and enlightened foresight,
but that, they result from the discriminating
favor of the government, and
are
largely built
upon undue exaction from the masses of our
people. The gulf between employers and the
employed is constantly widening and classes
are rapidly forming, one comprising the very-
rich
and powerful, while in another are found
the
toiling poor.
As we view the achievement of aggregated
capital, we discover the existence of trusts,
combinations and monopolies, while tho citizen
is struggling for in the rear, or is trampled to
day beneath an iron heel. Corporations which
should be the carefully restrained creatures of
the law and the servants of the people, are fast
becoming the people's masters. Still, congratu
lating ourselves upon the wealth and pros
perity of our country, and eoinpla
ccutly contemplating every incident
of change inseparable from these
conditions, it Is our duty as patriotic
citizens to inquire at the present stage of our
progress how the bond of tho government made
•with the people has been kept and performed.
Instead of limiting the tribute drawn from •ur
citizens to the necessities of its economical
administration. The government persists in
exacting from the substance of the people
millions, which unapplied and useless, lie dor
mant lu its treasury. This flagrant injustice
and this breach of faith and obligation add to
extortion. The danger attending the diversion
of tho currency of the country from the legit
imate channels of business under the same
laws by which these results arc produced, the
government permits many millions more to be
added to the cost of tho living of our people
and to be taken from our consumers, which
unreasonably swell the profits of a small but
powerful minority.
GOVERNMENTAL FAVORITISM.
The government, under pretext of an exer
olseof its taxing power, enters gratuitously
Into partnership with these favorites to their
advantage and IO the injury of a vast majority
of our people. This is not equality before the
law.
The grievances of those not included within
the circle of these benetlcieries, when fully
realized, will surely arouse irritation and dis
oontcnt. Our farmers, long suffering and pa
tient, struggling in the race of life with the
hardest and most unremitting toil, will not
fail to see, in spile of misrepresentations and
misleading fallacies, that they are obliged to
accept such prices for their products as are
fixed in foreign markets where they compete
with the fanners of the world. That their
lands are declining in value, while their debts
increase, and that without compensating favor
they are forced by the action of tho govern
ment to pay for the benefit of others, such en
hanced prices for the things they ueed that the
scanty returns of their labor fail to furnish
their support or leave no margin tor accumula
tion.

U«s relating to our public lands to other uses
lor homes ot hone6t settlers might be
prevented. While a measure to meet this
conceeded necessity of relorm remains await

MILITARY PRISONS.
The propriety and necessity of the erection
of ont^Or more prisons for tbe confinement of
UniuCd States convicts and a postoitice build
ing In the national capital are not disputed.
but those needs yet remain unanswered,
while scores of public buildings have been
erected where their necessity for public pur
poses is not apparent.
A revision of our pension laws could easily
be made which would resi upon just principles
and provide for every worthy applicant. But
while our general pension laws yet remain
confused and imperfect, hundreds of our
private pension laws are annually passed,
which are the sources of unjust discrimina
tiouand popular demoralization.
INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.
I Appropriation bills for the support of tho
government are defaced by items and provis
ions to meet private ends, and it is freely as
serted by responsible and experienced parties
that a bill appropriating money for public in
ternal improvement would fail to meet with
favor unless it contained more for local and
private advantage than for public benettt.
These statements can be much emphasized by
I an ascertainment of the proposition of fe leral
legislation which either bears upon its face its
private character, of which upon examination
develops such a motive power.
PEACE WITH ALL NATIONS.
In pursuance of a constitutional provision re
quiring the president from time to time to give
the congress information of the states of the
Union, 1 have the satisfaction to announce that
the close of the year tinds the United States in
the enjoyment of domestic tranquility and at
peace with all the nations. Sincc my last an
nual message our foreign relations have been
strengthened and improved by performance of
I International good offices and by new and re
I newed treaties or amity, commerce and re
clprocal extradition of criminals.
Those international questions which still
await settlement are all reasonably within the
I domain on amicable notion, and there is no
existing subject of dispute between the United
I States and any foreign power that is not sus
ceptible of satisfactory adjustment by frank
diplomatic treatment. The questions between
tho United Steles and Great Britain relating
to the rights of
I AMERICAN WORKINGMEN
under treaty and international comity in the
terrilor.a. waters of Canada and New England,
I 1 regret io say are not satisfactorily adjusted.
THE ALASKA BOUNDARY.
The coastal boundary between our Alaskan
possessions nnd British Ccl'.rabia. I regret to
say, has not received the attention demanded
by its importance, and which, on several occa
sions heretofore. I have had the honor to rec
ommend to the congress. The admitted im
practicability,
If
1
and no longer frightened by the cry-
their wages are endangered bv a just re'
vision of our tariiT laws, will reasonably de
mand through such revision steadier employ
ment, cheaper means of living in their homes,
freedom
for themselves and children from the
doom of
personal servitude, and an open door
their advancement beyond the limits of a
laboring class. Others of our citizens whose
oomfons
and expenditures are measured by
moderate salaries and fixed incomes will in
sist upou the
the cost of
fairnes^and justice of cheapening
necessaries for themselves and
not impossibility, of making
an accurate and precise survey and demarka
tion of the bounuary line, as it Is recited in the
treaty with Russia, under which Alaska was
ceeded to the United States, renders it abso
lutely requisite for the prevention of national
jurisdictional complications that adequate up
propriation for a recounolsance and survey to
obtain proper knowledge of the locality and
the geographical features ot the boundary
should be authorized by congress with as little
delay as possible.
RIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS.
It is much to be desired that some agreement
should be reached with her majesty's govern
ment by which tho damage to life and property
on the great lakes may be alleviated by re
moving or humanely regulating the obstacles
to reciprocal assistance to wrecked or stranded
vessels. The act of June 19, 1S78. which offers
I to Canadian vessels free access to our inland
I waters in aid of wrecked or disabled vessels,
has not yet become effective through concur
I rent action by Canada.
The due protection of our citizens of French
origin or descent, from claim of military serv
iee in the event of their returning to or visiting
France, has called forth correspondence which
I was laid before you at the last session In the
absence of conventional agreement as to natu
ralization. which is greatly to be desired this
government sees no occasion to recede from the
sound position it has maintained, not only with
regard to France, but as to all countries with
which the United States have not concluded
special treaties.
I Twice within the Inst year has the imperial
household of Germany been visited by death,
and I have hastened to express the sorrow of
this people and their appreciation of the lofty
character of the late aged Kmperor William
and their sympathy with the heroism under
suffering of his son, the late Emperor Frc-d
erick. I renew my recommendation of two
years ago for the passage of a bill for the re
funding to certain German steamship lines of
the interest upou tonnage dues illegally ex
acted.
In a message accompanying my approval on
the first day of Octobe last, of a bill for the
exclusion of Chinese laborers. I laid before
congress full information, and all correspond
ence touching the negotiation of the treaty
with China concluded a', this capital on the I2tii
day of March, 1888, and which having been con
firmed by the senate with certain amendment,
was rejected by the Chinese government. This
message contained a recommendation that a
sum of money be appropriated as compensa
tion to Chinese subjects who have suffered in
juries at the hands of lawless men within our
jurisdiction, such appropriation having been
duly found, awaits reception by the Chinese
government.
A COUNSULSHIP RECOMMENDED FOIt COREA.
Legislative provision is hereby recommended
to organize and equip consular cour'.s inCorea.
Persia has established diplomatic representa
tions at this capital and has evidenced very
great interest in the enterprise and achieve
ments of our citizens I am therefore hopeful
that beneficial commercial relations between
ihe two countries may be brought about.
THE HAYTIAN SQUABBLE.
I announce with sincere regret that Haytia
has again become the theater ot insurrection,
.•order and bloodshed. The titular govern
ment of Prcsiueui ooioinan nas been lorciuly
ovenhrowu auu uriveu out oi Ihe country to
France, where he has since cued. The tenure

These matters were fully treated in my mes
sage to the senate of Feb. 3u, taM, together
with such a convention, concluded under my
authority with her majesty's government on
the 15th of February last, lor the removal of
all causes of misunderstanding, was submitted
by mo for the approval of the senate. This
treaty having been rejected by the senate, 1
transmitted a message to tho congress, on the
23d of August last, reviewing the transactions
and submitting for consideration certain recom
mendations for legislation concerning the irn
pori ant questions involved. Afterward, outbe
12th of September, in response to a resolution
of the senate, 1 again communicated fully all
the information lu my possession as to the ac
tion of the government of Can
ada aflecting the commercial rela
tion between the dominion and the United
States, including the treatment of American
fishing vessels in the ports and waters of
British North America. The communications
have all been published, and, therefore, opened
to the knowledge of both houses of congress,
although two were addressed to the senate
alone. Comment upon a repetition of their
contents would be superfluous, and I am not
aware that anything has since occurred whicn
should be added to the facts therein stated.
To meet an exigency created by the rejection
of the treaty I now again invoke the earnest
and immediate attention of the congress to the
condition of this important question as it cow
stands before them and tho country, and for
the settlement of which I am deeply solicitous.
THE SACK
V1LLE INCIDENT.
Near the close of the month of October last
occurrences of a deeply regretable nature were
brought to my knowledge which made it my
paintul, but imperative, duty to obtain wi'h as
little delay as possible a new personal channel
of diplomatic intercourse in this country with
the government of Groat Britain.
The correspondence in relation to this inci
dent will in due course belaid before you and
will disclose the unpardonable conduct ot the
official referred to in his interference by advice
and counsel with the suffrages of American
citizens in the very crisis of the presidential
election, then near at hand, and and also in his
subsequent public declarations to justify his
action, superadding impugnment of tho execu
tive and senate of the United States ia connec
tion with important questions now pending in
controversy between the two governments.
The otlense thus committed was most grave,
involving disastrous possibilities to the good
relations of the United Stales and Great Brit
am, constituting a gross breach of diplomatic
privilege and an invasion of the purely domes
tic affairs and essential sovereignty of tho gov
ernment to which the envoy was accredited.
Haviug first fulfilled the just demands of
International comity by affording full oppor
tunity for her majesty's governmsnt to act in
relief of the situation, I considered prolonga
tion of discussion to be unwarranted ana there
upon declined to further recognize tho
diplomatic character of the person
whose continuance in such function
would destroy that mutual confidence which is
essential to the good understanding of the two
governments, and was inconsistent with the
welfare and self-respect of the government of
the United States. Tbe usual interchange of
communication has since continued through
her majesty's legation in this city. My en
deavors to establish, by international co on
oration, measures for the prevention of the
extermination of fur seals in Beliring sea have
not been relaxed, and I have hopes of being
enableu shortly to submit an effective and sat
isfactory conventional project with tho marl
time powers for ihe approval of tho senate.

continue to be urged upon the Cniiiau cuvern

NATIONAL FINANCES.
The report of the secretary ol the treasury
exhibits in detail the condition of our national
finances and the operations of the several
branches of the government related to his de
partment. The lolal ordinary revenues of the
government for the fiscal year ended June :W,
1SS8. amounted to of which tUiy.
(Kil,17:1.04 was received from customs duties
and il5!4,'J%,!t71.9o from internal revenue taxes.
The total receipts from a.l sources exceeded
those for the fiscal year ended June Jll. 1S«7, by
r.8o2.7U7.10. The ordinary expenditures for
the fiscal year ending June 30, lst»s, were &">!•,•
bM,»5S.t)7, leaving a surplus ot 111.012,llti.irJ.
The decrease in these expenditures, as com
pared with the fiscal year ended June 3U. '.SfC.
was Nj.27s.2-J0.au. notwithstanding the payment
of more than t5.iAM UOU for pensions in excess
of what was paid for that purpose iti the latter
mentioned year. The revenue: of the govern
ment for the year ending June 3U, lssfl, asocr
tained for the quarter euded Sept. 30, 1S8S. aud
estimated for the remainder of the time,
amount to tSTT.UOn.W'U, and the actual and esti
mated ordinary expenditures for the same year
are t274,uOu.uOll, leaving an estimated surplus of
I sio-i.tioo.rtiio.
The estimated receipts for the year ending
June 80, 18'JO. are .ia77,OtXI,(*Xi, and the estimated
I ordinary expenditures for the same term are
27S,-iti7.4.SS.:-l4, showing a surplus of .T1U1,2.«,
511.60. The foregoing statements of surplus do
not take into account the sum necessary to be
expended to meet tbe requirements of the sink
ing fund act. amounting to more thau H7,0(iu,0no
annuahy. The cost of collecting the customs
revenues for the last fiscal year was 2.44 per
cent. For the year 1PW5 it was 3.77 per cent.
The excessof internal revenue taxeseoilected
during the last fiscal year over those collected
for the year ended June 30. 1KM7, was $r.4s9,
174.2i. and ihe cost of collecting this revenue
I decreased from 3.4 per cent in 1SH7 to less than
3.2 per cent for the last year. The tax collected
on oleomargerine was S7-il94-i.OI for the
year ending June 30. 1887. and
8864.139.88 for the following year.
The requirements of the sinking fund act
have been met for the year ended June 80.
1888. and for the current year also by the pur
chase of bonds. After complying with this
law, as positively required, and bonds sufficient
for that purpose had been bought at a premium
it was not deemed prudent to further expend
the surplus in such purchases until the author
ity to do so should be more explicit. A resolu
lion, however, having been passed by both
houses of congress, removing all doubt as to
executive authority, daily
PURCHASES OF IIONDP
were commenced on the 23d day of April, Hts.
and have continued until the present time.
By this plan bonds of the government not yet
due have been purchased up to and Including
the 80th day of November, 18S8, amounting to
SiM.7uu.4oo. the premium paid thereon amount
ing to .50H.U13.0s.
The premium added to the principal of these
bonds represents an investment yielding about
2 per cent interest for the time they still had to
run and the saving to the government repre
seuted by the difference between the amount
of interest at 2 per cent upon the sum paid for
principal and premium and what it would have
paid for interest at the rate specified in the
bonds if they had run to iheirmaturity isabout
i«7.1i8.UU0. At first sight this would seem to be
a profitable and sensible transaction on the
part of the government, but as suggested by the
secretary of the treasury, the surplus thus ex
pended for the purchase of bonds was money
drawn from the people in excess of any actual
need of the government, and was so expended
rather than allow it to remain idle in the treas
ury. If this surplus under the operation of
just and equitable laws had been left in the
hands of the people, it would have been
I worth in their business at least 6 per en! per
annum. Deducting from the amount i.f inter
est upon the principal mid premium of these
bonds for the time they had to run at tbe rate
of ti per cent, the saving of2 per cent made for
the peopie oy the purchase of such bunds, the
loss will appeal to be 5vV.78tl,(i!iu.
Notwithstanding the large sums paid out in
the purchase of bonds the surplus iu ihe treas
ury on the 4th day of November, isss, was ^2.
234.tilll.oi after deducting about fc.ii.iWu.iiuo just
drawn out for the payment of pensions.
SILVER COINAGE.
At the close of the fiscal yeur ended June 30.
IRsr. there had been coined under the compul
sory silver coinage act 2i'I i.W 2-o in silver
dollars. i5o,.V.P4.3M of which were in the hands oi
the people. On the 30th of June. 1SS. there

829.303 was in circulation in coin, and KiXi,
387,37ti in sliver certificates, for the redemption
of which silver dollars to that amount were held
by tbe government.
On the 30th day of Nov. 1888. $312,570,990 had
been coined, *00,970,990 of the silver dollars
were actually in circulation, and $237,418,340 in

The secretary recommends the suspension
of the further coinage of silver, and in sucit
recommendation I earnestly concur. For

GltLM VISAGKD WAR.
The secretary of war reports that the army
on the date of the last consolidated returns

I OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
In the vast neiu of oriental commerce now
unlolued from our Pacinc borders no tealure
presents stronger recommendations tor con
gressional action than tne establishment of
communication by submarine Leiegruph with
Honolulu. Tne geograpmcal position of Uie

authority to publish advertisements iuviting
proposals in ihe newspapers throughout the
I country was granted by the secretary on Nov.
12. and on Nov. 13 the advertisements were
sent out to the different newspapers desig
nated. The bids for the steel forging are lo be
opened on Dec. 20, 1888, and for ihe mortors on
Dec. 15,1888.
THE BIG GUNS.
A board of ordnance officers was convened at
the Wa'.eroliet arsenal on Oct. 4, 188S, to pre
pare the necessary plans and specifications for
the establishment of an army gun factory at
that point. The preliminary report of the
board with estimates for ship building and of
fieers' quarters, was approved by the board of
ordnance and fortifications .Nov. 6 und 8.
I The provisions of the army bill for the pro
eurement of pnumatic dynamite guns, the ne
cessary specifications are now being prepared,
ami advertisements for proposals will be is
1 sued early in December. The guns will prob
alUy be ot fifteen inch calibre, and tire a pro
I jectile that will carry a charge, each of about
50 pounds of explosive geiotine with full
calibre projectiles.
ARMY PROMOTIONS,
I enrnestly request that the recommenda
tions contained in the secretary's report, ail ol
which are. in my opinion, calculated to increase
tile usefulness and discipline ot the army, may
receive the consideration of congress. Among
these the proposal that there should be pro
ided a plan for the examination of affairs to
test iheir ntness for promotion is of the ut
I most Importance.
I The death of Gen. Sheridan in August last
was a national affliction. The army ilieti lost
the grandest of its chiefs. The country lost a
brave and experienced soldier, a wise ami dts
creel councilor, and a modest and sensible
man. Those who in any manner came within
the range of his personal association will never
I fail to iiay deserved and willing homage to his
I greatness and the glory oi his career, but they
wnl cherish Willi more tender sensibility the
loving memory of his simple, generous and
considerate nature.
THE INDIAN QUESTION.
The Apache Indians, who engaged in a
bloody ami murderous raid during a part of
the years 1S8. and 188t, are now held as prison
ers of war at Mount Vernon barracks, in the
state of Alabama. They numbered ou the 31st
day of October, the dale of the last report, H3
men. 17U women. 70 boys and 59 girls, in all .'183
persons. The commanding officer states that
they are iu good health and coiitenied. and
thai they are kept employed as fully as is pos
sible under the circumstances. The children,
as ihey arrive at a suitable age. are sent to the
Indian schools at Carlisle and Hampton.
The prisoners should be treated kindly and
kept iu restraint far from the locality or their
former reservation: they should be subjected
lo efforts calculated to lead to their improve
ment aud to softening of their savage and
cruel instincts, but their return to their old
home should be persistently resisted. The
secretary, in his report, wives a graphic history
of these Indians and recites with painful vivid
ness their bloody deeds and the unhappy fail
tire of the government to manage lliem by
ueaeeful means.
THE NEW NAVY.
The report of the secretary of the navv dem
onstrates very intelligent management in that
important department and discloses the most
satistaclory progress in the work of recon
structing the navy made during the past year.
Of the ships in course of construction live. viz.:
the Charleston. Baltimore. Yorktown, Vesu
vius and the Petrel, have in that time been
launched und are rapidly approaching comple
tion, and in addition to the auove tin- Philadel
phia. the San Francisco, the Newark, the Ben
nington, the Concord and the Ileveshoff lor
pedo boat are all under contract for delivery to
tho department during the next year. The
progress already made and beinsr made gives
good ground for the expectation that these
eleven vessels will be incorporated as part of
the American navy within the next twelve
months.
POSTAL AFFAIRS.
The report of the postmaster general shows
a marked increase of businoss in every branch
of the postal service. The number 'of post
offices on July 1. 1888, was 57.37(1. an increase of
b,
124 in three years, and of 2.219 for the last
I fiscal year. The latter mentioned increase is
classified as follows
New England states 5
Middle states ]si
Southern states and Indian territory till. 1.400
The states and territories of the Pacific
coast 190
The ten states aud territories of the West
and Northwest
District of Columbia
Total ,.2.219
Free delivery offices have increased from IS!'
in the fiscal year ended June 3J. lssti, to 3.W in
the year ended June 30, IKSH. In the railway
mail service there has been an increase in one
year of ps routes, and in the number of miles
traveled per annum an increase of ltlo.705.917.4K.
T'ue estimated increase of railroad service for
the year was (5.0!Ki miles, but the amount of
new railroad service actually put on was 12,
7t4.so miles.
The volume of business In the money order
division, including transactions in postal notes,
reached the sum of upwards of fi48.uui.iKjo for
the year. During the past year partial post
conventions have been concluded with Barba
doer, the Bahamas. British, llondurus and
Mexico and are now under negotiation with all
the Central and South American states. Tho
increase for correspondence with foreign coun
tries during the past three years Is gratifying,
aud is especially notable and exceptional'with
the Central and South American stales and
with Mexico. As the greater part of mail mat
ter exchanged with these countries Is commer
cial in its character, this increase is an evi
dence of the imoroved business relations with
them.
The practical operation of the parcel post
conventions so far as negotiated, has served to
fulfill the most favorable predictions as to tnelr
benefits. In January last a general oostalcon
vention was negotiated with the Dominion
of Canada, which went into operation on March
1. and which practically makes one postal ter
ritory of the United States and Canada. Under
it merchandise and parcels may now be trans
milted through the mails at fourth class rate.-,
of postage, it is not possible here 10 touch
even the leading heads of the great postal es
tablishment to illustrate the enormous and
rapid growth of business of the needs for iegis
lauve readjustment of much of its machinery
that it has outgrown. For these and valuable
recommendations of the postmaster general at
tention is earnestly invited to his report. A de
partment whose revenues have increased from
tl9.7ry.ixi0 in l«o to tol.7un.uuu in ls«s. despite re
ductions of post-age. which have enormously re
duced rates of revenue, while greatly increas
ing its business, demands the careful consider
ation of the congress as to all matters sug
gested by those familiar with its operations,
and wnich are calculated to increase its effl
eiency and usefulness.
A bill proposed by the postmaster general was
introduced at the last session of the congress
by which a uniform standard in the amouiii of
gross receipts would fix the right of a coramu
nity to a public building to be erected by the
government for postoitice purposes. It was
demonstrated that aside from the public con
I venlence and the promotion of harmony among
citizens invariably disturbed by change of
leasings and of sue. it was a measure of the
highest economy and of sound business judg
ment. It was found that the government was
1
paying in rents at the rate of from 7 to IU per
cent per annum on what tho cost of such public
buildings would be.
A very great advantage resulting from such
a law would by the prevention of a large num
ber of bill" constantly introduced for the erec
tion of public buildings at places and involving
expenditures not justified by public honesty.
Of the toial number of tbe postmasters
."4.874 are of the fourth class. These, of course,
receive no allowance whatever for ex
penses in the service, and their compen
sation is fixed by percentages on
receipts in their respective offices. This rate
of compensation may have been, and probably
was. at some time just, but the standard has
remained unchanged through the several re
ductions in the rates of postage. Such reduc
tions have necessarily cut down the compensa
tion of these officials, while it undoubtedly in
creased the business performed by them, and
simple justice required attention to this sub
ject to the end that fourth class postmasters
may receive at least an equivalent to that
which the law itself tixinu ihe rale intended
for them.
Another class of postal employes whose con
dition seems to demand legislation is that of
clerks in postoUlees. and 1 call especial atten
tion to the report recommendations of the
postmaster general for their classification.
Proper legislation of this character lor the re
lief of carriers in the free delivery service has
been frequeut. Provision is made tor their
promotion: for substitutes for them 011 vaca
tion for substitutes for holidays, and limiting
their hours of labor. Seven milium dollars has
been appropriated for the. current year to pro
vide for them. though the total number of of
fices where they are employed is but 355 tor
the past fiscal year, with an increase for the
current year of but 40, while the total appro
priation for all clerks in offices throughout the
United Sillies is SN'OMU.UOO.
The legislation affecting the relations of tlio
government with railroads ls'in need of revis
ion. Wune, tor the most part, the railroad
companies throughout the country have cor
diany co operateti with tho postofllce depart
ment 111 rendering excellent service, yet. uuder
the law as it stands, while the compensation
to them for carrying the mail is limited
and regulated, and, although railroads are
made post roads by law, there is no authority
reposed anywhere to compel tho owner of a
railroad to take and carry the United Stales
mail. The only alternative provided by act of
congress in case of refusal is for the postmas
ter general 10 send mail forward by pony ex
press. This is but au illustration ill-fitting
legislation, reasonable and proper al the time
of its enactment, but long since outgrown and
requiring readjustment.
It is gratifying to note, from the carefully
prepared statistics accompanying the postmas
ter general's report, that, notwithstanding the
great expansion of the service, the rate of ex
penditure has been lessened and efficiency h^**
been Improved in every branch ibat fraud
and crime have decreased thai losses from
the mails have been reduced, and that the
number of complaints of the service made to
postmasters and to the department aro far less
than ever before.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
The transaction of the department of justice
for the 1 seal year ended June 30, 1888, are con
tained in the report of the attorney general, as
well as a number of valuable recommenda
tions, the most of which are repetitions of
those previously made, aud ought to receive
consideration. It is stated lu this report that
though judgments in civil suits amounting to
t552.u2l.ti8 were recovered ill favor of the gov
ernment during the year, only the sum of
I if 132.9.14 was collected thereon, and that though
lines, penalties and forfeitures were imposed
amounting to IM 1.808.43, only J109.W-s.42 of that,
sum was paid on account, thereof. These facts
muy furnish an illustration of the sentiment
which extensively prevails that a debt due the
government should cause no inconvenience to
ihe citizen.
It also appears from this report that though
prior to March. lv85, there had been but six
convictions in the territories of Utah and
Idaho under the laws of lsto and 1882 punish
ing polygamy ami unlawful cohabitation as a
crime, there have been since that date
nearly Goo convictions uuder these laws and
tr.e statutes of 1SS7. and the opinion is ex
pressed that uuder such a tirtn and vigilant
execution of these laws, and the advance of
ideas opposed to the forbidden practices, poly
gamy within the United Stales is virtually at
au end.
Suits instituted by the government under
the provisions ol the act of March 3, 1887, for
the terminal ion of the corporations known as
the Perpetual Emigrating Fund company and
the church of Jesus Christ of Eauer Duy
Saints have resulted in a degree favorable to
I the government, declaring the charters of
I these corporations forfeited and escheating
llieir property. Such property amounting in
values 10 more than I8UO.UOO is in tho hands of
a receiver, pending further proceedings, an
appeal having been taken to the supremo
court of the United States.
Vll.AS' DEPARTMENT.
1 111 the report of the secretary of the interior,
which will be laid before you. the condition of
the various branches ot our domestic affairs
I connected with that department and its opera
tions during tin-past year are fully exhibited.
I But a brief reference to some of the subjects
discussed in this able ami interesting report
can here be made, but 1 commeutl the entire
report to the attention of the congress and
1 trust that the sensible and valuable recom
mendations it contains will secure careful
I consitieration. 1 cannot but strenuously insist
upon the importance of proper measures to
I insure it right disposion of our public lauds,
not only as a matter of justice, but in forecast
I of the consequences to fuluro general ions,
The broad, rich acres of our agricultural
plains have been IOIIK preserved by nature to
become her unlrainiiieled gifts to a people
civilized antl free, upon which should rest in
well distributed ownership,tlienumerous homes
of enlightened, equal and fraternal citizen.
They came to national possession with the
warning example 111 our eyes of the entail of
I iniquities iu landed proprietorship which other
countries have permitted and still sillier.
Laws which open the door to fraudulent no
1 quisiiion or administration which permits fa
vor to vapraeeous seizure by a favored few of
expanded areas that many should enjoy aro
accessory to offenses against our national wel
fare and humanity not to be too .severely con
deinned or punished. It. is gratifying lo know
thai some!Iiing has been done at last to ro
tlress the injuries 10 our people and check the
perilous tendency of the reckless waste of 11a
tional domain, that over su.oooouu acres have
been arrested from Illegal usurpers, improvi
dent grants and fraudulent entries and claims
to be taken for the homesteads of honest in
I dustry— although less than the greater areas
thus unjustly lost- must afford a profound
gratification to right feeling citizens,
as it is a recompense for the
1 labors and struggles for the recovery.
Our dear experience ought sufficiently to
urge the speedy enactment of measures of leg
I islalion which will confine Ihe future disposi
tion of our remaining agricultural lands to the
I uses of actual husbandry and genuine homes.
I Nor should our vast tracts of so-called desert
lands be yielded up to the monopoly of corpora-
Hons or grasping individuals, as appears to bo
much the tendency under the existing statute,
These lands require but the supply of water to
become fertile and productive. It is a problem
of great moment how most wisely for tho pub
lie good that factor shall be furnished. I can
not bui think it perilous to suffer either these
lands or the sources of their irrigation to fall
into the hands of monopolies which by such
means may exercise lordship over areas de
pendent on their treatment for productiveness.
STATE LAND GRANTS.
I commend also the recommendations that
appropriate measures be taken to complete
the adjustment of ihe various grants made to
the states for internal improvements, und of
swamp and overflowed lauds as well as to ad
judicate and finally determine the validity and
extent of the numerous private land claims.
All these are elements of great injustice and
peril to the settlers upon the localities affect
ed, and now that their existence is more pres
sing than to fix. as soon as possible, their
bounds, and terminate the threats of trouble
which arise from uncertainty.
THE NOHLE RED MAN.
The condition of our Indian population con
tinues to improve and the proofs multiply that
tbe transforming change is much to be de
sired which shall substitute for barbarism en
lightenment, and civilizing education is in fav
orable process. Our relations with these peo
ples during the year have been disturbed by
no serious disorder, but rather marked by a
better realization of their true interests und
increasing confidence and good will. These
conditions testify to the value of higher toij^^ao*
of consideration and humanity which has gov*^
erned th" latter methods of dealing with them
and commend its continued observance.
Allotment* in severalty have been made on
some reservations until all those entitled to
land thereon have had their shares assigned
and the work is still continued. In directing
the execution of this duty I have not aimed so
much at rapid dispatch as to secure Just and
fair arrangements which shall best conduce to
the objects of the law. by producing satisfac
tion with the results of the allotments made.
No measure of general effect has ever been
entered on from which more may be fairly
hoped, if it shall be discreetly ad
ministered. It proffers opportunity
and inducement to that independence
of spirit and life which the Indian poculiaritiei
needs, while at the same tune the inalienable
of title affords security against the
risks his ine-xperi enee of affairs
or weakness of character may
expose him to in dealing with others. When
ever begun upon any reservation it should bo
made complete so that all are brought to the
same condition, and as soun as jiossible com
munity in lands should eease by opening such
as remain unallotted to settlement. Contact
with the ways of industrious and successful
farmers will, perhaps, add a healthy emula
tion which will both instruct and stimulate,but
no agency for the amelioration of this people ap
pears to me so promising as the dxtension
urged by the secretary of such complete fa
cilities of education as shall, at the earliest
possible day, embrace all teachable Indian
vouths of both sexes, and retain them with a
kindly and beneficent hold until their charac
ters are formed, and their faculties and dispo
sitions trained to the same pursuit of some
form of useful industry. The capacity of th«
Indian no longer needs demonstration. It is
established it remains to make the most of it,
and whan it shall be done the curse will b«
lifted.
ATTENDANCE AT THE sCHOOLP.
The average attendance of Indian pupils in
the schools increased by over WW during the
year, and the total enrollment reached 13.2.2.
The cost of maintenance was not materially
raised. The number of teachable Indian you
ill
is now estimated at 40.00:,. or
nearly three times
the enrollment of the schools. It is believed
the obstacles in the way of instructing all ar
surmountable, and that the necessary expen
dituro would be a measure of economy
