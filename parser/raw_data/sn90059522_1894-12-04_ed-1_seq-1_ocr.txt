' Washington, Dec. 3.—The presl
lent's message was read this afternoon
it the opening session of the two houses
31 congress, as follows: •
To lhe Congress of the United states:
Hie assemblage within the nation's leg
islative halls of those charf*ed with the
duty of making laws for the benefit of a
generous and free people impressively
suggests the exacting obligation and in
exorable responsibility involved in their
task. At the threshold of such labor
now to be undertaken by the congress
of the United States, and in the dis
charge of an executive duty enjoined
by the constitution, Lsubinit this com
munication, containing a brief state
ment of the condition of our national
affairs and recommending such legisla
tion as seems to me necessary and ex
pedient.
Tne history of our recent dealings
frith other nations, and our peaceful
relations with them at this time, addi
tionally demonstrate the advantage of
consistently adhering to a firm and just
Foreign policy, free from envious or
ambitious national schemes and char
icteriz d by entire honesty and sincer
ity.
During the past year, pursuant to a
law of congress, commissioners were
appointed to the Antwerp industrial
exposition. Though the participation
ol American exhibitors fell far short of
completely illustrating our national in
genuity and industrial achievements,
yet it was quite creditable in view of
the brief time allowed tor preparation.
1 have endeavored to impress upon the
Belgian government the Heedlessness
and positive harmfuiness of its restric
tions upon the importation of certain of
our food products, and have strongly
urged that the rigid supervision and
Inspection under our laws are amply
sufficient to prevent the exportation
from this country of diseased cattle and
unwholesome meat.
Neutrality in Brazil.
The termination of the civil war in
Brazil has been followed by the
general prevalence of peace arid or
der. It appearing at an early stage of
the insurrection that its course would
call for unusual watchfulness on the
part of this government, our naval force
in the harbor of Rio de Janeiro was
strengthened.*; The precaution, 1 am
satisfied, tended to restrict the issue to
a simple trial of strength between the
Brazilian government and the insur
gents, and to avert complications which
Bt times seemed imminent. Our
firm attitude of neutrality was main
tained to the end. The insurgents re
ceived no encouragement of eventual
asylum from our commanders, and such
Opposition as they encountered was for
the protection of our commerce,
and was fully justified by" public
law. A very serious tension of
relations having arisen at the
close or the war between Brazil and
Portugal by reason of the escape of the
Insurgent admiral Da Gama an.l his fol
lowers, the friendly offices of our rep
resentatives to those countries were ex
erted for the protection of the subjects
Of either within the territory ol the
other. Although the government of
Brazil was duly notified that the com
mercial arrangements existing between
the United States and that country.
based on the third section of the tariff
act of 1890, wore abrogated on Aug. 28,
l-'.>., by the taking effect of the tariff
law now in force-, that government sub
sequently notified us of its intention to
terminate such arrangement on the Ist
day of January, 1895, in the exercise
Df the right reserved in the agreement
between the two countries. 1 invite at
tention to the correspondence between
the secretary of state and the Brazilian
minister on this subject.
'i he commission organized under the
convention which we entered into with
Chile for the settlement of the outstand
ing claims of each government against
the other adjourned at the end of the
period stipulated for its continuance,
leaving undetermined a number of
American cases which had been duly
presented. These cases are not barred,
and negotiations are in progress for
theit submission to a tribunal.
The remedy rests with the afflicted.

AFFAIRS IN THE ORIENT.
Uncle Sam as Peacemaker In the
China-Japan War.
The 17th of March last the new treaty
with China in further regulation was
signed at Washington, and on Aug. 13
it received the sanction of the senate.
Ratification on the part of China and
formal exchange are awaited to give
effect to this mutually beneficial con
vention.
A gratifying recognition of the uni
form impartiality pf this country toward
all foreign states was manifested by the
coincident requests of the Chinese and
Japanese governments that the agents
of the United States should, within
proper limits, afford protection to the
subjects of each during the suspension
of diplomatic relations due to a state of
war. This delicate office was accepted,
and a misapprehension which gave rise
to the belief that in affording this kind
ly unofficial protection our agents would
£xcrcise the same authority which the
withdrawn agents of lhe bellig
erents had exercised was very
promptly corrected. Although the
war between China and Japan endan
gers no policy of the United States, It

reason of its disturbance of our growing

commercial interests in the two coun
tries and the increased dangers which
may result to our citizens domiciled or
sojourning in -interior of China.
Acting under a stipulation in our treaty
with Cores (the lirst concluded with a
Western power). 1 felt constrained at (he
beginning of the controversy to tender
our good offices to Induce an amicable
arrangement of the initial difficulty
growing out of the Japanese demands
for administrative reforms in Cores;
but the unhappy precipitation of actual
hostilities defeated this kindly purpose.
Deploring the destructive war between
the two most powerful of tbe Eastern
nations, and anxious that our commer
cial interests in those countries may be
preserved and that the safety of oui
citizens there shall not be jeopardized,
1 would not hesitate to heed any intima
tion that our friendly aia for the honor*
able termination of hostilities would be
acceptable to both belligerents.
A convention has been finally con
cluded for the settlement by arbitration
of the prolonged dispute with Ecuador,
growing out of the proceedings against
Entitle Santos, a naturalized citizen of

Our relations with the republic of
France continue to be such as should
exist between nations so long bound to
gether by friendly sympathy and simi
larity in their form of government. The
recent cruel assassination of the presi
dent of this sister republic called forth
such universal expressions of sorrow
and condolence from our people and
government as to leave no doubt for the
depth and sincerity of our attachment.
The resolutions passed by the senate
and house of representatives on the oc
casion have been communicated to the
widow of President Carnot.
The Germu Difficulties.
Acting on the reported discovery of
Texas fever in cargoes of American
cattle, the German prohibition against
importations of live stock and fresh
meats from this country has been re
vived, lt is hoped that Germany will
soon become convinced that the prohibi
tion is as needless as it is harmful to
mutual interests. The German govern
ment has protested asainst that provis
ion of the customs tariff act which im -
poses a discriminating duty of one-tenth
of one cent a pound on sugars coining
from countries paying an export bounty
thereon, claiming that the exaction of
such duty is in contravention of articles
5 and 9of the treaty of 1828 with Prus
sia. In the interest of the commerce of
both countries, and to avoid even the
accusation of treaty violation, 1 recom
mend the repeal of so much of the
statute as imposes that duty, and I
invite attention to the accompanying
report of the secretary of state, con
taining a discussion of the questions
raised by the German protests.
Early In the present year an agree
ment was reached with Great Britain
concerning instructions to be given to
the naval commanders of the two gov
ernments in Behruig's sea and the con
tiguous North Pacific ocean for their
guidance in the execution of the award
of the Paris tribunal, of arbitration and
the enforcement of the regulations
therein prescribed for the piotectiou of
seal life in the waters mentioned. An
understanding lias also been readied
for the payment by the United States of
$425,000 iv full satisfaction of all claims
which may be made by Great Biitain
for damages growing out of tha
controversy as to fur seals in Sabring
sea or the seizure of British ves
sels engaged in taking seals in these
waters. The awards and findings of
the Paris tribunal to a great extent de
termined the facts and principles upon
which these claims should be adjusted,
and they have been submitted by both
governments to a thorough examination
upon the principles as well as the facts
which they involved. 1 am convinced
that a settlement upon the terms men
tioned would be an equitable and ad
vantageous oue, and 1 recommend that
provision be made for the prompt pay
ment of the stated sum. Thus far only
France and Portugal have signified
their willingness to adhere to the regu
lations established under the award of
the Paris tribunal of arbitration.
Preliminary surveys of the Alaskan
boundary, and a preparatory examina
tion of the question of protection of
food fish In the contiguous waters of
the United States and tho Dominion of
Canada, are in progress. The boundary
of British Guiana still remains in dis
pate between Great Britain and Vene
zuela. Believing that its early settle
ment on some just basis alike honorable
to both parties is in the line of our es
tablished policy to remove from this
hemisphere all causes of difference
with powers beyond the sea, 1 shall
renew the efforts heretofore made to
bring about a restoration of diplomatic
relations between the disputants, and
to Induce a reference to atbitration. a
resort which Great Britain so conspicu
ously favors in principle and respects in
practice, and which is earnestly sought
by her weaker adversary.
Since communicating the voluminous
correspondence in regard to Hawaii and
the action taken by the senate and
house of representatives on certain
questions submitted to the judgment
and wilier descretion of congress, the
organization of a government in place
of the provisional arrangement which
followed the deposition of the queen
has been announced with evidence of
its effective operation. The recognition
usual in such cases has been accorded
the new government.
Under our present treaties ot extra
dition with Italy, miscarriages of jus
tice have occurred owing to" the refusal
of that government to surrender its
own subjects. Thus far our efforts to
negotiate an amended convention obvi
ating this difficulty have been unavail
ing.
Apart from the war In which the
island empire is engaged, Japan attracts
increased attention in this country by
her evident desire to cultivate more
liberal intercourse with us and to sees
our kindly aid in furtherance of her
laudable desire for complete autonomy
iv her domestic affairs aud full equality
in the family of nations. The Japanese
empire ot today is no longer the Japan
of the past, and our relations with this
progressive nation should not De less
< broad and liberal than those with other
: powers.
Quality, not quantity, is what the peo
ple want. Continued trials prove that
a single teaspoouful of Dr. Price's is
worth double the quantity of any other

Hearing- Message.
Washington, Dec. 3.—The opening
of the second session of the Fifty-third
congress, after a recess of three months,
made the big white marble capitol build
ing the center of interest today. Early
in the day the corridors began to fill
with the crowd which is always attract
ed by the assembling of congress. There
was added interest, owing to the politi
cal revolution which had recently oc
curred, but it was not a struggling mass
of humanity, such as sometimes marked
the great events of congress. The pres
ident's message was to be presented in
both houses, and this meant that there
could b * no sharp debates, as the read
ing clerks would have the floor for two
hours or more during the reading of the
message. The crowd seemed to be drawn
mainly to the house end of the capitol,
as it was here that tho recent political
storm had made its marks apparent.
The galleries were well filled, though
not overcrowded, and the spectators
showed an eager Interest in the arrival
of each conspicuous figure on the floor.
Congressional veterans, who had spent
a good share of their lives in the house
of representatives, came into it for their
final session, the recent tidal wave
having retired most of the leaders
of the majority; but there were
few disconsolate faces among the
defeated, and they joined with
the members of the minority in good
natured rallies across the middle aisle,
which is the political dead-line. Repre
sentative Holm an, of Indiana, was one
of the first to appear. He was greeted
warmly by his old friends, and then
went to his seat and busied himself
with the business of the day. Occa
sionally there was a round of applause
as some leader of note made his appear
ance. The best known ones—Reed.
Wilson, Bland and Burrows—were not
among the early arrivals, and the gal
leries were expectant until those
party favorites put in an appearance.
At the senate there was another
crowd which tilled the galleries without
crowding. A new rule had been put
into operation, limiting the reserve gal
leries to the use of those personally in
troduced by senators, instead of those
holding tickets of admission. The sen
ators were late in arriving, and some of
those who had been most conspicuous
in recent public events, notably Sena
tor Hill, of New York, were absent.
Tho usual dignity and decorum which
mark all senate proceedings kept the
galleries from showing their manifesta
tions of approval which marked the
opening of the house's session.
Alix, the new wonder, has eclpsed
Nancy Hanks. Price's Baking Powder
has never been shorn of its laurels, and
still is triumphant on the pedestal of
public favor.
SENATE GETS TO WORK.
Number of Bills Introduced in
Opening Session.
Washington, Dec. 3. — Sixty-six
members were in their seats when the
vice president called the senate to or
der. After the opening prayer by
Chaplain Miiburn the usual committees
to wait on the president and house
were appointed, and recess taken till
1-2:30.
At 12:30 the senate took a further re
cess until 1:00. Most of the well-known
figures of the senate were in their ac
customed places. Mr. Morrill, of Ver
mont, the octogenarian of the body,
moved about with a step giving
little evidence of his advanced
years. The tall, gaunt form of
Sherman moved about the senate, much
of the time being on the Democratic
side. Mr. Gorman passed among his
associates, giving greetings with that
suavity which is such a marked charac
teristic with him. Mr. Peffer sat in the
rear seat, absorbed in a newspaper.
Messrs. Jones, of Arkansas, and Harris,
of Tennessee, who had borne the brunt
of the tariff work last fall, conferred to
gether. Senator Voorhees and Senator
Vest, the two other conspicuous figures
of the last tariff battle, had their heads
together during the recess. The gal
leries looked in vain for Mr. Hill, of
New York, who was still absent In
Florida. On the Republican side Mr.
Wolcolt, of Colorado, who has been so
prominently identified In the fight for
silver, conferred with Mr. Cameron, of
Pennsylvania.
Messrs. Aldrich and Allisou, the re
spective tariff and appropriation author
ities on the Republican side, had a half
hours conference during the second re
cess.being joined by Messrs. Teller and
Cullorn. These and the other informal
gatherings of senatorial groups were
merely for the exchange of personal
and political views, although tho pros
pects for the comiug session were pretty
fully discussed.
On the reassembling of the senate at
1:30, Messrs. Harris and Manderson re
ported that the president would com
municate with the senate by one of his
secretaries.
Executive Clark Pruden Immediately
appeared at the main door, and the
white-haired Isaac Bassctt, of the sen
ate staff, announced, "Message from the
president!" _ A targe document was
carried to the vice president, w> 0 di
rected that the message be reau, There
upon, Secretary Cox, in measured tones,
began reading the document. Iv the
meantime, printed copies of the mess
age had been secured by many
senators, who read the text, in
stead of listening to it. Most
of them, however. paid close
attention to the reference to the Chi
nese-Japanese war. It was the first
official information known, even; to
members of the foreign committee. , It
was much briefer, however,' than was
expected, and left still open the actual
details to the negotiations. When the
reference to the China-Japan matter
was reached, the Chinese minister, ac
companied by Mr. Tung, an attache,
entered the galery reserved for the dip
lomatic corps, and they were interested
listeners to the foreign features of the
message.
The reading of the message closed at
3:40 o'clock, having taken just two
hours and ten minutes. The vice pres
ident announced that in accordance
with the usual custom, the president's
message would lay on the table and be
printed.
Mr. George (Dein. Miss.) presented a
resolution directing the committee on
rules to report a comprehensive revis
ion of the rules, with a view to expedit
ing business and compelling a vote.
The resolution was referred to the com
mittee on rules.
Mr. Chandler (Rep., N. 11.) offered a
resolution, which was adopted, fixing
Dec. 2U as a day for the reception of the
statues of Daniel Webster and Gen.
John Stark, which are to be placed in
statuary hall. Mr. Hoar (Rep., Mass.)
offered a resolution, which was adopted,
requesting the president for information
not incompatible with the public serv
ice, concerning the recent massacres of
Armenians in Turkey, and as to what
protest, memorials, etc., bad been pre
sented by American citizens.
Mr. Turpie (Dem., Ind.) offered a res
olution reciting that the time had come
for the election of United States sen
ators by direct vote of the people. Mr.
Tin pie announced that on Friday next
be would submit some remarks on the
resolution, and In the meantime the
resolution went over.
Mr. Lodge (Rep., Mass.) offered a res
solution calling on the secretary of state
for particulars concerning the execu
tion of two Japanese students by the
Chinese authorities at Shanghai, when
the students had been given the pro
tection of the United States. At the
request of Mr. Gorman the resolution
went over under the rules until tomor
row.
Mr. Blanchard (l)em., -La.) preset!
a resolution protesting against the re
cent Turkish atrocities against Armeni
ans, and directing that tiie remonstrance
of this government be communicated lo
Turkey. - The resolution went to the
committee on foreign relations.
Mr. Dolph (,I'ep.. Or.) presented a
memorial Irom the commercial organiza
tion, of Portland, Or., favoring '.he
Nicaragua canal. Mr. Dolph briefly
urged the import*nee of the pending
measures for prosecuting the canal. I
Mr. Peffer (Pop.* Kan.) offered two
resolutions. The first directs the judi
ciary committee to investigate tiie cir
cumstances and legal authority under
which the secretary of the treasury
made the last two issues of bonds. The
second resolution calls on the president
for information concerning tho circum
stances and necessity for sending
United States troops to Chicago din i:«
the pendency of the Pullman 3trike.
Both resolutions went over under tile
rules. i
Mr. Call (Dem., Fla.) offered a •*«£*
lution for the appointment of a special
committee to inquire as to what extent
the Louisiana lottery or Hunduras lot
tery was operating in Florida; whether
either of tneui had sought to control
state or national elections; whether
money bad not been expended by them
in turning the election of members of
congress, and whether they did not own
or subsidize the newspapers in Florida.
The resolution went over.
The annual report of the government
directors of the Union Paciiic railroad
was received from the secretary of the
interior.
The secretary of the navy submitted
a reply to a senate resolution calling
for the relative number of American
citizens and aliens iv the United States
navy.
The annual reports of the various de
partments and bureaus were received,
Then at 4 o'clock, on motion of Mr.
Gorman the senate adjourned.
THE HOUaiE
Gay With Floral Decorations—
Leaders Get an Ovation.
Washington, Dec. 3.—The opening
of the short session of the house was
picturesque in a way, but devoid of in
teresting features. The victorious Re
publicans and the defeated Democrats
exchanged greeting**, and gave and
took thrusts on the result of the recent
potitical battle with much animation,
but thorough good nature. The gal
leries were crowded, and half the desks
on the floor were smothered with
flowers. The leaders on both
sides got enthusiastic recep
tions from their respective parti
sans, the appearance of Speaker Crisp,
ex-Speaker Reed, Mr. Wilson and Mr.
Burrows being the signal for long and
loud outbursts. There was no cliauce
in the first day's proceedings for any
pubiic reference to the electiou. so that
the actual proceedings were dull and
uninteresting. Seven new members
were sworn in, and, after a long wait,
the president's message was read.. Al
though listened to attentively, it was
concluded without a single mark of ap
proval or disapproval.
The death of the late Representative
Wright, of Pennsylvania, was then an
nounced, whereupon the house, as a
mark of respect, adjourned.
Honest competition is commendable.
Our opponents admit that Price's Cream
Baking Powder was fitly honored by
Gold Medals of the World's and Mid
winter Fairs. '
NEW SENATE RULES.
Movement for Revision Already
Begun.
Washington, Dec. 3.—There was
more or less talk on the Democratic side
of the chamber during the day about
the importance of a change in the rules
of the senate, which culminated late in
the afternoon by the introduction of a
resolution by Senator George looking' to
that end. The resolution directs the
committee on rules to report at the
earliest practicable moment such
amendments as will enable the senate
to reasonably discharge the legislative
.functions imposed upon it. The reso
lution specifically provides that the
senate shall have power to come to a
vote on any pending question after giv
ing such reasonable opportunity" for
amendment and debate as Ilia senate
may decide to be proper to compel the
attendance of a quorum: that for the
purpose of making a quorum all sena
tors present may be counted whether
answering to their names or hot: that a
senator present who falls to answer to
the call of his name shall be punished
for disorderly' behavior. /*. ,;',"

CASE CONTINUED TO DEC. 17.

ing Against Him"—Pro
tests Innocence.
JIM GETS QUITE FACETIOUS.
He Joshes the Detectives, and
Seems to Keep Up Kis
Usual High Spirits.
James IT. Burns, the ex-county audi
tor, was in the beginning and is now In
the city of St. Paul. He Is also in tho
county jail. Messrs. Maloney and Egan,
his bondsmen under the two indictments
already over him. surrendered Mr.
Burns yesterday, after he had already
surrendered himself. Mr. Burns made
no effort to secure other bondsmen. He
simply resigned himself to a cell in tho
county jail to await his trials iv the
other cases.
Mr. Burns never left the city from the
time the warrant for his arrest was
issued last Saturday afternoon. He
had been in Minneapolis during the
middle of the day. but returned about
4:30 p. m. He had scarcely stepped
from au interurban car when a friend
informed him that a warrant for his ar
rest had been issued on complaint of
his mother-in-law, Mrs. Reidcl. Mr.
Burns did not relish the prospect of a
Sunday in jail, so he laid low. realizing
that it was too late to secure bail. Ex
actly where he spent his time until yes
terday morning is not known. It was
given out that he secreted himself with
in the premises occupied by Maloney,
one of his bondsmen, but this report
both Mr. Burns and Mr. Maloney deny.
But Jlr. Burns Admits
that he slept in St. Paul Saturday and
Sunday nights. He made himself
scarce merely to avoid spending those
hours in jail.
Yesterday morning about 9 o'clock
Mr. Burns walked Into the office of
County Attorney Butler. As the ex
coun:y auditor stepped across the
threshold he remarked:
"Where are Meyerding and McGulg
gan? I understand they've got a war
rant of arrest for me, and I've been
looking for them ever since Saturday. 1
saw the track of a wooden shoe up near
the Arlington, and that's the only trace
of Meyerding I have run across."
"Sit down, Jim, ' remarked Mr. But
ler, "and we'll try and find you a de
tective."
A telephone message to the central
station resulted in the appearance of
DetectiveMeyerdiug.who at once placed
Mr. Burns under arrest. Half an bout
later Mr. Burns appeared in the mu
nicipal court before Judge Twohy. His
counsel, Mr. Woodruff, of Bowe ft
Woodruff, waived the reading or the
complaint, and asked for a continuance
of two weeks, which was granted, in
asmuch as one of the former indict
ments of Burns is to come before the
court next week. The case was ac
cordingly continued until Dec. IT, and
bail was fixed at §1,500.
Mrs. Reidel, the mother-in-law of Mr.
Burns, was in the court room, but she
did not speak to him. She was laboring
under considerable excitement.
Mr. Burns spent the afternoon look
ing for bail. Deputy Sheriff Courteau
was his escort. But while Mr. Burns
was seeking the bail Messrs. Egau and
Maloney, his old bondsmen, called upon
County Attorney Butler and notified
him that they
Desired to Surrender llr. Burns
and retire from liability on the two
a"-2,500 bonds they had signed. So when
Mr. Burns returned to the sheriff's of
fice shortly after 5 p. m. he was in
formed of the action of his bondsmen.
He at once gave up seeking bail, and
said he was ready to take up quarters
in the county jail. To a Globe reporter
who saw him in the jail about b* p. m.,
Mr. Burns said:
"1 have been in town ever since this
warrant for my arrest was issued. 1
did not give myself up at the time be
cause i preferred not to remain in jail
over Sunday, but now that my bonds
men have surrendered me, 1 do not pro
pose to even try to secure bail. As far
as this last case is concerned, there is
nothing in it. lam prepared to prove
that 1 have paid Mrs. Reidel (ISO a
mouth for twelve months, and, as for
any embezzlement on my part, I can
also show that I am entirely guiltless of
that. The fact is, this is-simply a
scheme on the part of the gang to prej
udice me in the coming trial under the
former charge. That la all. If this
charge were prosecuted in good faith
Why Wax n't it Pressed
during the earlier part of the week?
You see. the object was to give me the
worst of it right on the eve of the other
cases.
"As to the report that 1 had sent my
wife away, there is no truth in it. Mrs.
Burns is stopping at the Arlington
hotel. We gave up housekeeping and
went there in order to escape unpleas
ant surroundings, for my enemies were
persecuting her as well as me. But 1
will show them, when the time comes,
who Is the strongest. Those Indict
ments won't last a minute alter the
evidence is in."
Mr. Burns was evidently perturbed
by tho action of his bondsmen, but he
showed no signs of discouragement.
Messrs. Maloney aiidEgau will appear
! before Judge Brill this forenoon at 10
o'clock' and formally surrender Mr.
, Burns to the custody of the court. The
j case under the first indictment against
i,iin is set lor next Monday.

S. G. Comstock Seems to Be the

-Fergus Falls, Minn., Dec. 3.—
There is considerable speculation iv the
Seventh congressional district regard
ing Washburn's successor. Very lew
people here desire his re-election to the
senate. Farmer Bickrord will sorely
support him, but the other two Repub
lican delegates from this county will
wait for developments. The two Pop
ulists from Otter Tail are certainly anti-
Washburii. Wilkin, Clay and Becker
counties combined send three delegates
—all Republicans, but all favoring S.
G. Comstock, of Moorhead. Foss and
Finney, from Clay county, were elected
on a Washburn platform, but will sup
port Comstock. Polk county delegates
are strongly opposed to Washburn, as
are also Pope and Swift counties. The
feeling prevails through the entire dis
trict that Washburn has no walk-away,
with great chances for his defeat. Com
stock appears to be the most available
man. and, with the feeling that a sen
ator should bo elected outside of the
Twin Cities, will get the entire support
of this upper country.

of Northern Pacific lands in Stutsman,
Burleigh.Wells, McLean, Morton, Stars

Postmaster General Bisseil instructed

Philadelphia' and Baltimore to return

agency, or to either W. 11. Munn,

charged with conducting a fraudulent
scheme through the American and in
ternational mails from London. The
official ordeis require that the returned
communications bo marked "fraudu
lent," and postmasters have been di
rected to refuse to certify money orders
to the agency or its operators.
The agency has addressed circulars to
patentees throughout the country, rep
resenting that it will have inventions
patented by both the United States and
the British government, and that the
Official Gazette of the United States
patent office gives tho agency all the
information about inventions that is
required to obtain a provisional protec
tion for nine months, during which
period a four years' patent may be ob
tained.
Tne agency, according to postal of
ficials, advertised that government fees
are $15 for a provisional protection for
nine months aud $43 for four years,
while the only compensation asked by
the concern after the money for either
right had been forwarded is the sole
right of sale of tho invention, when
patented, for three months.
Many people in this country have
made complaint that they have not

their remittances.

A Cruel Murder Is Committed
In the Very Heart of Min

SUICIDE THEORY ADVANCED,
But the Bullet Hole in the

REPORTED WORTH $10,000.
She Had Been Away From Her
Home the Past Three
Evening's.
A foul murder was committed in
Minneapolis last night. A murder en
vironed with horrible mystery. The
victim, Catherine (.ling, a dressmaker,
lies at the county morgue stark
and cold in death. There is a
bullet hole in the head about
two inches back from the right ear.
A surgeon's instrument, probing in the
hole, followed the course of the bullet
through the brain and discovered it
lodged under the left eye. from which
position it was dislodged by Coroner
Spring. Somewhere between 8 and
9 o'clock last night William Er
hart, a railroad man employed
at the St. Louis depot, was
wending his way homeward. He tra
versed West Thirty-first street, the
other side of Lake Calhoun, and when
in the vicinity of Excelsior avenue,
he noticed a horse and carriage
coming down the road toward
him. The horse was going
at a rapid gait, but it was too dark for
Erhart to see if the carriage had an
occupant. At the intersection of Thirty
first and Excelsior, Erhart discovered
a dark, ungainly heap lying in the
middle of the roadway. It proved to be

Body of a Dead Woman,
She had been dead but a few minutes,
for there was still warmth in the hands.
A buffalo robe lay beside the body. Er
hart notified the police at once, and the
patrol wagon went to the scene of the
murder. The body was taken to
the morgue, and Coroner Spring
made au examination. At first it
was supposed tbe woman had met with
an accident; that the horse had run
away am' she Had been thrown out and
•killed. This supposition, however, was
dissipated by the facts, and the coronet
decided it was a case of horrible mur
der. The woman was well dressed, and
work a sealskin sacque. J. E. Stover,
a Tribune compositor, identified her as
Miss Catherine Ging, a dressmaker, who
has dressmaking rooms at 05 Syndicate
block and lives at 6 Thirteenth street
south. Last night at 7 o'clock Miss
Ging engaged a horse and carriage at
Goosman's livery stable, 8 and 10 East
Grant street. At 9 o'clock
The Horso Came Home Alone.
The lines were laid across the dash
board, and the ho-se had not turned a
hair. The livery proprietors state that
this incident shows conclusively- that
the horse had not been driven at a high
rate of speed, and in their opinion seme
person had driven it within a block
of the stable, else the lines
would have .dragged themselves off
the dashboard to the ground, under the
animal's feet. This adds still more mys
tery to the affair. The liveryman also
states that the horse is an old one
and could not under any circum
stances run any great distance. Some
thought last night that it might
be a case of suicide, but the officials at
the morgue state that while it is possi
ble such ls the case, it is not probable
from the nature of the wound. It is
too far bacK, and would neces
sitate a very awkward position of
the arm to suicide in such
a manner with a "pistol. There were
no indications that a struggle hail taken
place in the carriage, for, with the ex
ception of the buffalo robe, everything,
even to the whip, was in its accus
tomed place. The seat, however, was

seat, carrying the robe with her. while
the horse jogged home. Another theory
is that some person occupied the car
riage with her, and that when
her head was turned to the
left shot her in the head,
in the place indicated above; then threw
the body out upon the road and drove
into the city as rapidly as the old horse
could travel, leaving it somewhere in
the vicinity of the barn, after first lay
ing the lines over the dashboard. In the
event of a suicide, she probably fell out
of the carriage, and the horse, unham
pered by driver, trotted home, the dark
ness preventing any person from notic
ing whether the seat was occupied or
not. The police argue that it
seems hardly possible that a young
woman would commit suicide under
such peculiar circumstances. The body
was not identified until after midnight,

A Very ■y***to*r*to*M Cane.
It was learned at an early hour this
morning that the murdered woman was
seen at Barge's restaurant, the up
stairs section, Sunday night, in th*
company of Harry Haywood, well
known about town as a sport and
blood. While in one of the booths she
disclosed a roll of bills amounting to
$2,000, which she laid on the top of
a goblet, making some laughing re
mark about being rich. It is said Hay
wood remarked that he feared some ill
would befall the woman for being so
careless, owing to the lateness
of the hour. It was impossible
to find him and learn what
he knew of the mystery. Miss
Ging was known to have kept company
with Mr. Haywood for some time past.
She leaves a sister in Chicago, and it Is
understood her other relatives live in
Auburn, N. Y. The people of
the house on Thirteenth street,
where she resided, stated that
she had been away anout three nights
during the past week, and on several
occasions a carriage was sent lor her.
She is reputed to have been worth in
the neighborhood of $10,000.

Protest Against Unfair I'rosecu-
tion in California Trials.
San Fkancisco, Dec. 3.—A sensa
tion was created here this morning in
the United States court, in which Main
and Cassidy, A. li. U. men. are on trial
for conspiracy. Attorney Monteith,
their attorney, formally moved to have
United District Attorney Carter and
his assistant. District Attorney Samuel
Knight, relieved from their positions as
prosecutors iv the case on the ground
of bias and undue friendliness for the
Southern Pacific raiiroad. Two of the
defendants were introduced, lt was
charged that through ail the recent
strike troubles the district attorney and
his assistants conspired with the South
ern Pacific officials, or that they took
such unwarranted action on behalf of
the railroad's interests and became
so biased that the conviction
of the men now on trial is essential tc
the vindication of the district attorneys,
lt was further charged that the district
attorney and his assistant have a per
sonal interest in suppressing evidence
on behalf of the accused man. and that
when the matter was under investiga
tion before the United States grand
jury the district attorney's influence
was wrongfully used to prevent the
grand jury from hearing material evi
dence on behalf of the strikers. It was
also charged that District Attorney
Carter owes his appointment to the late
Senator Stanford and railroad influ
ence, and that through all of the
trouble he was active in their behalf.
The motion to remove District Attorney
Carter and his assistant and to substi
tute special counsel for the prosecution
was denied by Judge Morrow, and the
trial was ordered to proceed.
GEN. SWAIN'S SHOES.
Col. Lieber of South Carolina Is
Willing to Fill Them.
Washington, Dec.3.—The announce
ment of the president's intention to re
tire Judge Advocate General Swain this
month has caused much speculation in
military circles as to the succession.
Under ordinary circumstances Gen.
Swain would not retire before 1896 it
he cared to remain on the active list,
and in deciding to avail himself of the
privilege of arbitrarily retiring an offi
cer of this rank upon reaching the age
of sixty-two years without the officer's
application, the president has adopted
a course which, while perfectly legal,
has very few precedents in the "history
of the army.
Up to this time but two names have
been prominently mentioned for the.
succession. One is Joseph 1). Doc. oi
Wisconsin, assistant secretary of war,
and the oilier is Col. G. 11. Lieber, ol
South Carolina.
Mr. Doe has. however, publicly de
nied any aspiration to the place, and it
seems very probable that the office will
fall to Col. Lieber, who has since Gen.
Swain's suspension discharged all ol
the onerous duties of judge advocate
general without receiving the pay of
the office. ..__
