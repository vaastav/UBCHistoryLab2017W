PIANO CLUB
In introducing the "Werlein Piano'' to the public, we wish to emphasize the
effort we have made for the past fifty years to give the public - the most for
their money, and in so doing make reputation for the house of "Werlein."
To do this we deeply feel the necessity of having the piano which bears onr
naine to excel in every detail and can frankly say that it. comprises.,
Every Essential Point in a High Grade Instrument
The "WERLEIN" Piano
is an artistic production in every sense of the word. The greatest possible care is exercised in its manu
facture to produce a piano especially adapted to this very peculiar climate, and we are justly proud of the
result. The scale of the Werlein Piano is scientifically correct, evenly balanced, and is responsible for
its wonderful tone—the soul of the piano. Double repeating action, the touch is light and easy. Seven
and one-third octaves. Best ivory keys. Patent muffler for practice. Attractive cases in Fancy Mahog
any, Walnut and Oak, double veneered on hardwood. Not the oldest—but the latest. Not as good as
any, but "compares favorably with such makes as Chickering, Mathushek and Steinway," was the praise
given the Werlein by a prominent musician. Werlein Pianos are fully wairanted for five years, and are
absolutely damp proof. Careful consideration of the fact concerning the Werlein Piano is of interest
to all who appreciate a strictly High tirade Piano at a moderate price.
AVrt /llW« il 'C ATotll Jo are l ' le foundations on which are builded the successful
J- f </y/ K&HIUV lUKHliPUjfi basiness of yesterday, to-day and to-morrow. Through
such methods, we are enabled to offer the public extraordinary opportunities to secure Pianos—the
greatest perhaps is the
WERLEIN PIANO CLUB=
In order to thoroughly introduce the Werlein Piano in New Orleans and sur
rounding territory, we have decided to form a Werlein Piano Club of one
hundred (100) members for 100 Werlein Pianos. This will give members
the opportunity of furnishing their homes with a good, durable, High
Grade Piano at a very reasonable price, and at the same time advertise
the Werlein Piano. Each and every Werlein Piano in a home will sell
another—in some cases several ; if so we are fully repaid in the way of fu
ture business. The Werlein Piano will be sold in the regular way for
$350, $375 and $400.
TO CLUB MEMBERS THE PRICE WILL BE
which includes a Handsome Scarf and Stool, delivered anywhere in the
city. $262 is the Spot Cash Price, no discount. If on payments, the
price is the same—$262—Ten Dollars Cash and $1.50 each Week, with

Protest Against English Barbarity
South Africa.
Chicago Dec. 8.—A program of
protest against British methods in
the South Africau war was carried
out before au immense audience in
the Auditorium Theatre here to
day. Following an eloquent ad
dress by W. Bourke Cockran and
earnest speeches by others, resolu
tions for the appoiutmeut of a com
mittee to bring the sentiments of
the meeting before the President
were adopted.
The peroration to Mr. Cochran's
address was as follows :
"Provideuce has so ordered events
that the President of the United
States can compose the bitter quar
rel. It is an extraordinary oppor
tunity offered to an extraordinary
man. It would not be uecessary to
draw the sword, to make any threat
of armed intervention, or to take
an unfriendly attitude. One word
spoken to the English embassador,
or in the heariug of the English
nation, would restore peace, estab
lish justice, secure liberty to these
burghers, promote enormously the
prosperity of the human race and
bring immeasurable glory to the
American nation. Will that word
be spoken Î Never in history have
such momentous results hung on
opportunity for himself, his coun
try and the whole human race."
The meeting closed with a re
markable demonstration. Follow
ing a speech by Bishop Spaulding,
of Peoria, 111., the great audience
roared its approval of the Boer
cause, the cheering being long con
tinued, and then contributions were
asked for the relief.of the stricken
women and children in the South
African camps. The first response
was a check for $500, sent up by a
man who requested that his name
be withheld. Then followed checks
for $100, the contributors for this
amount being numerous. When
smaller sums were asked for mon
ey came freely from all parts of the
great Auditorium. The total am
ount raised was over $5,500.
