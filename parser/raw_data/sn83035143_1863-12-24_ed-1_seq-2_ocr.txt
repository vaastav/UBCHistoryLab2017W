lit Government self imposed by tie
modK' ia which eaoh recorrinr four
Tears bring be'ore the country the ques
tion, was shall be onr next President, the
ahotoe to ba Bide la of taa moat Tltal con-
aeaaeaM. Honesty, ability, devotion to
the Constitution and the laws, ere
among the requirements.
' The choice of that man lies primarily
and legitimately with the people. Men
nay endeavor to forestall it by pre-oocn
pying public attention with the claims of
then, but it will be impossible to defeat
the txroular will. Availability alone
ifconld not be the motive for the nomina
tion ef any mam, whether civil or military.
It most be a lubttantial conviction of the
amiiV - Mtmlar keart that the nominee la the
Tight Joan ia the Tight place.
- The question it ; What is (he Wish of
the loyal millions whose voice waa recent
ly beard from sea to tea? How aie the
large Colon majorities to be interpreted ?
i Hot limply that the peoplf are deter
mined on the re establishment of the
Union, bat that they are satisfied with the
policy of the President and have confidence
ia him. i . : -
Let sol the country be b'.lndfolded to
this great faot. Overtowering ell other
men in the respect and love of a great
people, eminent in the practical wisdom
and benevolenoe of all bis executive acta,
Abraham Lincoln stands preeminent.
Teweting above all other men in the good
will of the people, he is to-day emphati-
ally the people's choice. i
Among the reasons why he should le
renominated are the following : ;
' 1. The loyal masses have an unshaken
oon&Jenoe ia his honesty and ability.
In a Presidential contest these qualities
are of the highest interest. They muBt of
necessity be the most essential requl
sites. In these perilous day! of tie Re
public it would be unwise to lake an un-
tried mpn when wehave one whose ability
and wisiom have baen so repeatedly eon-
finned.
2. He was elected Chief Magistrate o
u TTnited States. He has baen euoh de
lurt but not de Jaclo. It is but the just re.
ward of his great toils and honest hearted
devotion to the Constitution and the laws,
that he should preside over a' united peo
ple; be a President in faot as well as in
rleht
The rebels have sooffed at the idea of
submission to hie Executive sway. He is
fe representative of the people agaitst
Whose choice these men rebelled. Ite
honor and dignity of this great body of
people domand that he shall preside over
the entire nation.
6. It is lareely to hiB wisdom and
Executive forbearance, as well
decision, that the present proud
position of the nation in the eyes of En
rope is due. Y e are happily at peace with
all foreign powers and left to conoenlrale
Air immense resources against rebellion
at home, instead of frittering it away in
aivereal hostility. !
- The people should acknowledge this fact
and their obligation to him in, the only fit'
ting way : by re affirming their confidence
1 1 his distinguished abilities and sign.;
success.
There is not a man in the nation whose
position for observation and superior
knowledge of public affairs is such is is
Mr. Lincoln's.
S t - He knows what gigantic forses of gcoi
' ami evil are at work. He nn let-stands ex
' perimentally the difficulties that He In the
way of re-oonsToctian, and can therefore
D t adapt wisT means to deeirable end?.
' The coming four years are to be yi t
- mire fruitful, not only in elvil problems
a-, home and abroad bnt also,' probably In
MHtary questions of most momentor-s
' consequence. The just demands and honor
of the nation must be established abroad.
-" Ia President Linooln we shall Lata a wise,
jadioious, and determined leader.
4 He has begun the great work of e
, ftroying slavery, and reconstructing our
.'- nationality on the broad, humane and tn--.
during basis of human equality. In the
' eyes ef the world he has become the great
emancipator. His name is breathed with
blessings by millions of cruelly wronged
' ' and outraged men and women. His name
' U known and loved in all the rice-fields
aid ootton plantations of the Soutn. To
"" the blaok race, he is a liberator and savior.
Ia this great work he commands the sym
pathy and admiration of the lending minds
f the nation, the thoughtful, the wise, the
benevolent, the patriotic Curses have
fallen only from malicious ' pro-slavery
partisans ; blessings from all whose heaits
are la the work of restoring our nation
ality oa a basis substantial as the granite
kills. ..
6. He is needed where As it ; Gon. Grant
where he is ; Seeretary Chase where he is.
The financial and military difficulties aie
ot yet entirely settled. The great finan
cial brain of Seoretary Chase and the mil
itary genius of Grant, or any other man,
are needed where they can best serve the
aUtica, just where they are. - -
We believe we are simply giving ex
pression to the popular will ia thus early
snggestihg, our great chieftain and states
snan, Abraham Lincoln as the right man
ia the right place." No one can deoy his
signal wisdom and ability thus far; let ts
trust him for the future.
Georgia Legislature.
The Georgia legislature adjourned tn
the 15th. The appropriations amount to
I over f 14,000,000, of which $0,000,000 aie
; for soldiers families ; 52,000,000 for oloth
' lng the Georgia troops; J2;000,000 for the
' military fund ; $1,000,000 for the public
debt ; $500,000 for the Georgia Relief As
sociation ; $1,000,000 for blockaie run
ners for supplies r and about l,0Q0,0CO
for general State purposes. '
' The American ladies residing in Mor
trail, Canada, recently held a fair which
yielded $T00. This sum has been placed
at the disposal of the United States Sai i-
' tary Commission for the relief of sick tid
Weualed soldiers. j
The Border Congressmen.
A singular condition In out
legislation has been reached. The old
stats ef affairs has bees reverted ; and,
now, instead of audacious, but blind de
fence of slavery and hesitating loyalty in
the Border Slave States, we have an exhi
bition of hearty anti slavery sentiment
and determined devotion to the Union,
which make a sad contrast with the man
ner In which the great and most loyal
State of Ohio is represented at Washington.
Compare the voting of Messrs. Randall,
tnderson, Clay and Smith, of Eentnoky,
with that of our own renegade Congress
men, all of whom, with but two exceptions,
wereoverwhelmingly defeated in the re
cent election.
The only theory which satisfactorily ac
counts for this sad spectacle, is based npoa
the very evident faot that the loyal Con
gressmen from Maryland, Delaware and
Kentucky see that the people of these
Slates are no longer to be decived on the
subject of slavery. The Storm that is to
burst in frightful fury upon that last and
greatest vistige of barbarism is already
gathering in thunder olonds upon the hor-
iion. They, as loyal men, see that slave
ry is the mother of treason and all her pes
tilent litter ; that peaoe shall not dwell in
our borders permanently until the foun
dations of our social system are broken
up and a new superstructure of universal
liberty erected. They are mot daunted
therefore by the bullying of such effete
and semi-loyal sheets as the Louisville
Journal.
But our twelve Congressmen, who
shamefully belie the wishes of their con
stituency, are oniting with their con fed
eratet in am attempt to get the "control of
the Government into their own hands.
Party iB exalted above patriotism. A love
of the national treasury and patronage
constrains them rather than the love of
their country.
On the following resolution offered by
Mr. Green Clay Smith, of Kentucky, the
voting was very significant.
" Retolved, That, as our country, and the
very existence of the best Government ever
instituted by man, is imperriled by the
moelcaoeeless andwioked Rebellion that
the world has ever seen, and believing as
we do that the only hope of saving the
country and preserving this Government
is by the power of the sword, we are ior
the most vigorons prosecution of the war,
until the Couttituion and law thall be en
forced aad obeyed in all parti of thi United
Statet; and to i not eno we oppose y omu
tie, or intervention, ormediati'.n, orpropori-
txun for peace from any quarter, to long at
there thall be found a Bebel
armt againtt the Government ; and
we ignore all party names, lines and
issues, and recognise but two parties ia
this war, patriots and traitors.
This resolution passed by 93 yeas to C4
niys. Observe carefully the langua
italicised. What does this resolution af
firm to which any whole-hearted loyal man
could hesitate to subscribe. It simply af
firms that no proposition for peaoe, inter
vention or armestice will be listened to to
bur as there are rebels in arms. The
veto on this resolution by the Congress
men from this State exposes these un
scrupulous partisans of a so-called Demoo
r icy. Behold Ihe figure the great State of
Ohio, which affirmed its devotion to the
Government by one hundred thousand ma
jority, cu's before the wor'4 :

8o with Illinois. Twp-thirds of hr
Cjngressmen repudiated a proposition tl
State recently affirmed by a majority of
30,000.
In New York the vote was about equally
divided, although the great Empire State
scaled her devotion to the cause of the
Union by the same majority.
The Border States give a decided major
ity for the prosecution of the war without
cessation until rebels lay down their armr.
The loyal free States, mis represented, on
tie ecntrary, throw their influence in the
line of party tactics and treason.
A Sensible Criticism.
The Toronto Globe is
the Canadian journals. Standing, as it
does, in the character of a disinterested
spectator of political movements on this
side of the border, and possessing, at the
same time, abundant means of obtaining
correct information, the Globe ia in po
sition to form a very aoourate idea of the
condition ef parties in the United States,
The following is its comment upen the re
oent summerset of the "Democrats" in
Congress, on the Peaoe qnestion :
The Democratic party in Congress have
oome to the conclusion that resistance to
ihe war is no longer possible, and that in
order to have any chanco of success in the
coming Presidential election, they must
pledge themselves to an an active prose
cution of hostilities. This decision is the
liraot result of reoent successes of the
North, which have brought the subjuga
tion of the South within view; but it was
certain to come sooner or later, and the
Democrats have shewn no great shrewd
ness in followinp so fast nd so far the
lead o: such men as Vallandigham, of
Ohio, and Seymour, of New York. If
they had contented themselves with criti
cising the Administration while support
ing the war, they would have been
stronger now than they can fairly o'.aim
to be. They have thrown the whole war
game into Mr. Lincoln's hahds, and they
cannot beat him now whatever changes of
policy they may adopt.
Our Prisoners at Richmond.
. From a private letter received from
General i'cal Dow, dated Riohmond, De
cember iith, we make the following ex
tracts: "I learn, from the papers and by my
letters, that contributions and subscrip
tions have been taken np in many North
ern oities for prisoners at Richmond. I
hope that nothing will be sent here by in
experienced parties, because such a course
would probably involve loss and waste to
a large extent. The only safe mode of
managing the business wUl be to send all
contributions for such purpose to the Uni
ted States Sanitary Commission, or to some
trustworthy Supply Association, through
which all benefactions will be wisely dis
tributed at points where supplies are most
needed. The Government is now sending
large soyplies of olothing and food for the
use of our soldiers here, acd the Sanitary
Commission and Supply Associations have
sent to the officers of a great many neces
sary and useful articles; and consign
ments of 'such are arriving by every flag
of trooe boat." , ,
' Mr. Dow adds, that the prisoners would
bo very glad if the publishing houses of
New York and others would send them
soma reading matter. Books of history,
voyages, travels, mtgaiiaes, ele., would
be very acceptable. Tttlmnt.
The Dinner to the Hon. Schuyler Colfax.
The members and representatives of the
press la Washington paid their respects on
Saturday evening last to the distinguished
speakra of the House. A " table resplen
dent with silver and glass " waa spread
out before them at Willard'a Hotel. The
occasion was one of rejoicing and gratifi
cation in the honors paid to the press.
The press is being recognised as a power
in the land. It no longer begs an exist
ence but has truly become, as Mr. Beeoher
styles it, the monarch of the age. We ap
pend interesting extracts from 'he speeches
of Mr. Wilkerson, of the New York Times,
and Mr. Colfax. .
Mr. Wilkerson, the President of the
mettiDg said : Eighteen years ego, at one
o'olock of a winter moon-lightel morning,
while the horses of the stage coach in whiob.
I was plowing the thiok mud ot Indiana
were being changed at Lbe tavern in souin
Bend, 1 walked 'he root-way or tne prici
Dal street to shake off a great weariness
I saw a lisht throueh a window. A sign,
The Blister " was legible above it, ana
I saw through the window a man in his
shirt sleeves walking quickly about like
one that worked. I paused, and looked,
and imagined about the man, and about
his work, and about the lateness of the
honr fo which it was protracted; and I
wondered if he was in debt, and was strug
gling to get out, aad if his wi:e was ex
peoiing him and had lighted a new candle
for his ooming, and if he was very tired.
eominr steo interruDted this idle dream
ing. When the walker reached my side
I joined him, and as we went I asked him
questions, and naturally they were about
the workman in the shirt s!eeves. " What
sort of a man Is he ?" "Hill very good
to the poor; he works hard ; he is sociable
with all people; he pays his debts; he
does'nt drink whisky; folks depend on
him : all this cart of Indiana believes in
him." From that day to this I have never
taken up the South Bend Register without
thinking of this eulogy, and envying the
man who had justly entitled himself to it
in the dawn of his manhood.
That man when 26 years of age, and
again when 29 yean old, was sent by his
neighbors to the National Presidential
Conventions when 27 years old he was
sent by his neighbors as a wise political
reformer to the Constitutional Convention
of the State of Indiana was sent by the
sime neighbors to Congress in the year
1854, and kept there by them from that
day to this.' On the first Monday of this
month of December the Republicans of the
House of Representatives unanimously
elected him the Speaker of that body.
My brothers you think you know the se
cret ot this uninterrupted lavor oi n con
stitaenoy to a representativa of this con
tinued rerard of a community for a oitl
(en of this appreciation of a statesman
by statesmen. You find them in his fidel
ity to srinciples in his thorough atten
tion to business in his talents for legitJa
tion in their eons tan t and useful devo
tion to the public good. The Congressional
Globe and the traditional and written his
tory of Congress are full of the evidences
of these virtues, and of this fitness for
public trusts, and this tills to honor and
oonfldenoe. Bat you don't know the
secret. I do. I learned it by ohanoe. I
got cossession of it by an nnwittirg and
unwilling eavesdropping in the parlor of
another nobis man, John w. rorney
Eighteen years after my midnight watch
ing of that printer, in his shirt sleeves at
bis solitary taour, i neara mm in in is ony
utter this his philosophy or life: "1 eon'
sider that day wasted in which I have not
done some good te some human being, or
added somewhat to somebody a ftappiness.
W hat success eould reeede from that man
pursuit nay. what success would not
pursue that man and forcibly orown him
with honors and gratitude? Schuyler
Colfax, editor of the South Bend Register,
Congressmen from Indiana for eleven
years, actor of a chilosophy of human life
that Socrates might hive envied, you can
not escape the love or your fellow-man
1i e journalists and men of the newspaper
press do lore you and olaim you as bone of
our hone and flesh of our flesh. Fill your
glasses all in an invocation to the gods for
long life, greater successes, and ever In
creasing happiness to our editorial brother
in the speakers Chair.
Mr. Colfax said: I have been gladto
meet you here to-night, and I am glad
that, notwithstanding our varied and an
tagontzing political shades of opinions, we
can thus sit down together in social har
mony. We know there ia to be a dayoom
ing when the lion atd, the latab shall lie
down tor ether. Laughter Some doubt
ing Thomases think that this will only be
realiiedby the lamb being, at the time, in
side of the lion. Laughter ! Bu, pollti
riiIv, the prophecy seems almost verGed
to night.
I e&nnot avoid saying that a few words
in relation to the profession to which we
have devoted our lives. 1 think you can-
net but acknowledge that the American
Congress has not overlooked the press
Not only have they seen fit, for the first
time in the history of Congress, to select
a printer for the grave responsibility
which cluster around their presiding ow,
cer, but from the ranks of the same prafes
slon they have taken a gentleman for the
next office in order, the Clerk of the House,
and one whom, with a modesty equal to
his worth, I eee blushes as I allude to him,
(Mr. McPherson). And besides these, we
have also in the American Congress
another gentleman, a printer, acting as
postmaster Of the House. Having thus
generously given a majority of alt offioes
to the press, they have magnanimously al
lowed " the rest of mankind " to take the
remaining two offices. Laughter and ap
plause. In the other branch of Congress
we have as Secretary of the Senate (John
W. Forney, one of the most gifted and dis
tinguished journalists of our times. The
Vioe President of the United States, also,
was a newspaper man, and I doubt not, a
good one. And so, also, was the Sergeant-at-Arms
of the Senate, Mr. Brown, of Illi
nois. And if our excellent President was
not directly connected with the press, I
think we can bear testimony to the faot
of his having furnished material for innu
merable editorials in its columns. rLaugh
ter For muoh of this ennobling patriotism,
for these marked developments of human
ity, I bless to-night the American press.
Applause.
And, again, you have another duty to
perform. It is the inouloatlon of morali
ty among that large circle of people you
thus reach. If the fountain is poisened,
the water that flows from it shall be
poisoned too ; and those that drink of that
water shall have poison in their veins in
stead of the pure blood that gives health
and strength. It is your duty to see that
not by your aid shall thee poisons reach
yonr patrons to spread moral miasma
within the cirole of your influences.
Having at greater length than I intended
alluded to what I believe to be the duties
devolved upon ns as journalists, before I
resume my seat' I must again warmly and
gratefully thank you for your kindness
manifested to ms to-night. This night
shall be marked as a white atone in the
history of my life. And as I look baek
In the days that are to come. If God
spares my life, I shall never forget the
hours we have so happily pasted tegether
here.
For the great honor you have done me
to-night,for such a reception as you have
given me, I feel, with the Irish orator, like
saying, "My heart would shake hands
with all of you." Laughter and ap
plause. And I beg leave to give you a
sentiment, as a pla-fonn on which all of
ytra can safely stand :
Tma Ahkicaji Paiss If inspired by
Patriotism, -Morality, and Humanity, it
oannot fall to develop a constansly in
creasing Vigor, Power, and consequent
Independence. Loud and continued applause.
General Grant on the Corner Stone.
Ia a private letter of General Grant to
to Hon. E. B. Washburne, dated August
23, 1803, he thus gives his opinion oa the
amaahing of the corner atone of the re
bellion. The New York Herald's denial
of the genuineness of this letter, when it
waa quoted by Senator Wilson, has brought
oat the publication of its precise language
and date :
The people of the North need not quar
rel over the institution of Slavery. What
Vice President Stephens acknowledges as I
ihe oorner atone of the Confederacy, ia al
ready knocked out. Slavery ia already
dead, and cannot be resurrected. It
would take a standing army to maintain
81avery in the South, if we we were to
make peace to-day, guaranteeing to the
South all their former constitutional pnv -ileges.
I never was an Abolitionist not
even what would be called anti-Slavery
but I try to judge fairly and honestly, and
and it became patent to my mind, early in
the rebellion, that the JNortu ana noutn
could never live at peace with eaoh other,
except as one nation, and that without
81very. As anxious as I am to see peace
established, I would not, therefore, be will
ing to see any settlement until this ques
tion is forever settled.
What Was it?
The Boston Courier publishes an ex
tract of a letter from a gentleman in the
Southern States, who has always bsea a
Union man, and who has been imprisoned
by the rebels, in wMch occurs the follow
ing:
"He says, that during his confinement
he conversed with prisoners from all of
the Confederate States but Florida, and
their unanimous testimony was, that if
MoClellan and Buell had been continued
in command, and the polioy wbioh they
represented had been persevered in, the
Confederacy oould not have lasted six
montha longer than the date of their re
moral; for the plain reason, that no new
army oould have been raised.
"What was the 'polioy which these
Gonerala represented 1 ' How did it differ
from the polich which has since been pur
sued? Was it marked out by the Govern
ment, or did these Generals take the liber
ty of inaugurating a policy to suit them
selves? We should very much like some
definite information on these points. If
any policy wbioh would have ended the
war has been discarded, the whole country
is interested in knowing what it was.
Will not the Boston Courier enlighten ns?
Tribune,
Blunders.
In telegraphing the President's Message
to the country, our readers must have no
ticed that many mistakes were made. The
experience of the press in different parts
of the country is the same. The Missouri
Democrat, remarking upon this, says :
"Take, for instance, one sentence.
Speaking of the Emancipation Proclama
tion, after raying that It was hoped the
rebellion could be suppressed without re
sorting to that measura, but that it waa all
the while deemed possible the necessity
for it might come, Mr. Lincoln waa repre
sented in some papers as remarking as
follows : 'It eame, and, aa intimated, It
waa followed by dark and doubtful days.'
In other papers thia was printed: 'Itoame,
and, as was intended,' io. The Philadelphia
Pess has it: 'It oame, and, as waa portend
ed,' &s. The Washington papers have it:
'It eame, and, as was anticipated,' &o. The
latter reading, we believe, ia according to
the manuscript text."
Rhetoric Without Sense.
[From the Columbus (Secesh) Crisis.]
When we look baek but three years,
when this frse-negrodom came rampant
into power, and cast a thought upon what
we enoe were and what we now are, and
still further to where we are rapidly
drifting, it is enough to make the stoutest
heart quail before tb storm yet to pass
over the ',uil before the purification can
teas place. As the sultry, sickly, un
breathable atmosphere of a 8 a miner's
olstios Is purified by the lightning's
Sashes and the thunders roll along tbe
valleys and the mountains, as the wild
hurricane tears and slashes all in i'B
course, so is the moral and political mias
ma driven off by the upheaving, of popu
larfrensy."('ltll)
As we are not skilled in Interpreting
the utterance of the disciples of the "black
art," we would be obliged to any one who
would tell us what all that fanfaranade of
the Crisis means. Medary can't.
A meeting of sailors was held In New
York a few evenings since to consider the
stoppage of grog in the navy. A resolu
tion was adopted which pledged the men
never U enter the service until the grog
ration is restored. The following is ths
resolution:
Buolvei, That the abolition of grog In
the navy was uncalled for, and ia very
bati; that it was never attempted in any
other navy in the world ; that the two
gilla of whiskey per day which we got
waa not enougu to intoxicate any body ;
and that those who could do without grog
landsmen, marines and boya never
drank It at ail.
Witty, Very.
The Crisis has the following resplendent
scintillation of its oharaoteristiA wit:
Give these Abolitionists, by Democratic
favor, "all the men and ail the money '
they desire, and the work will be dons.
An old toper ones approached ns with a
jug nnder his arm and very pleadingly
