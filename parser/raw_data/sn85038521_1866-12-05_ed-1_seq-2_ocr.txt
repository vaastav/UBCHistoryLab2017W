KESTOKATIOJJ.
In my message of the 4th of December,
18C5. Coneress was informed of the meas
ures which had been instituted by the- Ex
ecutive with a view to the gradual reatora-
tion of the States in which' the insurrec
tion occurred to their relations with the
General Government. Provisional gover
nors had been, appointed, conventions
t sembled, and Senators and Representatives
chosen to the Uongress of the United btates.
- Courts had been opened for the enforce
ment of lawtflong in abeyance. The block
- -1 t 11
aae uaa ocen , removed, custom-houses re
established, arid the infernal revenue laws
put in force, in order that the people might
-contribute tb the national 'iiicome. ' Postal
i "operations had been "renewed, and' efforts
were being made to restore them to their
former condition of efficiency. The .States
themselves had been asked to take part in
-tthe hieh function of amending the Consti
tution, and of thus sanctioning the extinc
tion of African slavery as one of the legiti-
mate results, of. our internecine struggle.
" llaving progressed thus far, the Execu
' tive-Department found that it had accom
plished nearly all that was within thencope
to'Pitfl'COnstitultonal authority. One thing,
however, yet remained to be done before
the work of restoration could be completed.
and that was the admission to Congress of
. loyaueenaiors ana representatives from
the States whose people had rebelled
i against the lawful authority of the General
Government. This question devolved upon
the respective Houses, 'which, by the Con
stitution, arc made the judges of the elec-
, j tions, returns, and qualifications' of their
own members: and its consideration at
gtice engaged the attentiomof Congress.
Tn the meantime, the Executive Depart
ment no other plan having beenproposed
1 by Congress continued its efforts to per-
.feet, as far as possible, the restoration, of
the proper relations between the citizens of
the respective btates, and the reueral Uoy
- eminent, extending, from time to time, as
the public interests Fceined to require, the
Ijifdicial, revenue, and postal systems of the
country. With the: advice and consent of
the Senate, the necessary officers were ap
pointed, and appropriations, made by Con
gress for the payment of their salaries.
vI'The proposition to amend the Federal
Constitution, so as to prevent the existence
of slavery within the United States or any
place subject to their jurisdiction, was rati?
,lied by the requisite number of Suites; and
on the 18th day of December, 1865, it was;
officially declared to have become valid as
(a part of the Constitution of the United
States. All of the States in which the in
surrection had existed promptly amended
their Constitutions, so as to make them con-i
form to the great change thus effected in
tliCiOrganic law of the iland; declared n3ll
andvmd,all ordinanceand laws bf seces
sion; repudiated all pretended debts and
obligations created for the revolutionary
purposes;. df the insurrection; and1, pro
ceeded, in good faith," to the enactment of
measures for the .protection and ameliora
tion of the condition of the colored race.
Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit
any of these States to, representation ; and
it was not until towards the close of the,
eighth month of the session that an excep
jtipniwas made in favor rjf-ffennefsee; by
' tlie admission of her Senators and Repre
sentatives. I deem it a subject of profound regret
.that Congress has thus far failed to admit
to seats loyal Senators and Representatives
from theotberStates,who?einhabttants, with
thoso of Tennessee, had engaged in the rebel
lion. Ten States more than one-fourth
of the whole number remain without rep
resentation; the seats of fifty members in
the House of Representatives and of twen
ty members in the Senate are yet vacant
not by their own consent, not by a failure
of election but by the refusal of Congress
to accept their credentials. Their admis
sion, it is .believed, would have accomplish
ed much towards the renewal and strength
ening of our relations as one people, and
removed serious cause for discontent on the
part of the inhabitants of those States. It
would have accorded with the great prin
ciple enunciated in the Declaration of
Amoriaan Independence, that no people
ought to boar the burden of taxation, and
vet.be denied the right of representation.
It would have been in consonance with the
express provisions of the Constitution,
that " each State shall have at least one
Representative," and " that no State, with
out iu consent, shall be deprived of its
equal suffrage in the Senate." These pro
visions were intended to secure to every
State, and to.the people of every Statcthe
right of representation in each House of
congress; and so important was -it deemed
by1the framers of the Constitution that the
equality of the States in the Senate should
be preserved, that not even by an amend
ment of the Constitution can any Sate,
without its consent, be denied a voice in
that branch in the National LogUlature.
It'.is true, it 1ms been assumed that the
existence cf the State wm terminated by
the rebellious acts of their inhabitant,
and that the insurrection havingj?een sup
presbed, they $were tKnceforward to be.

.Departments ?cf the SSorernnJent have
however, with creat dt-tinctnega' and uni
form consistency; refusea to sanction an as
sumption so incompatible with the nature
of our republican system, and with tho
professed objects of war. Throughout the
recent legislation of Congresflj thef tofidehr
able fact make itself apparent, that these
ten political communities are nothing less
than States of this Union. At the Very
commencement of the rebel llion each.
House declared, with a unanimity as
remarkable as it was significant that the
war was not "waged, upon our part, in
any spirit of oppresidn. nor for ' any pury
pose of conquest of subjugation, nqr pur
pose ot overthrowing or mterieriag -with
the rights or established institutions of
those States, but to defend arid maintain
the supremacy of the Constitution and all
lrwa ttinnn in nnivlt'innn tliAfonf nnrt tt
preserve pie Union with alL dignity, jeqaH
ty, and rights of the several States unim
paired; and that as soon as these objects"
were "accomplished the war ought to
cease." In some iniitdnces, Senators .weye
permitted to continue their legislative func
Hons, while in, other instances Representa
tives were elected and admitted to seats
after their- States had formally declared
their right to withdraw lrom the Union,
and were endeavoring to maintain that
right ,by force of arms. All of the States
whose people were in insurrection, as States,
were included in the apportionment of the
direct tax of twenty millions of dollars an
nually laid upon the United States by the
act approved 5th August, 1861. Congress
oy the act ot Aiarch looa, and uy the
apportionment of representation there
under, also recognized their presence as
States in the Union; arid they have, for ju
dicial purposes, been divided into districts,
as estates aione can dc aiviaea. rue same
recognition appears in the recentlegislation
in reference to Tennessee, which evidently
rests upon the fact that the function's of the
fetato were not destroyed by the rebellion,
but merely suspended, and that, principle
is of course applicable ?o those "States
which, like Tennessee, attempted to re
nounce their places in the Union.
The action of the Executive Department
of the Government upon this subject has.
been equally definite and uniform, and the
purpose of the war was specifically stated
in the Proclamation issued by my prede
cessor on the 22d day of September, 1862.
It was then solemnly proclaimdtnd de
clared that ''hereafter, as heretofore, tho
war will be "prosecuted for the object of
practically restoring the constitutional re
lation between the United States ,and each
of the States arid the people thereof, in
which States that relation is or may be sus
pended or disturbed."
The recognition of the States by the Ju
dicial Department of the Government had
also been clear and conclusive In all pro
ceedings affecting them as States, had in,
the bupreme, Circuit, und District Courts.
In the admission of Senators and Repre
sentatives from any and all of the States,
there can be no iust ground of apprehen
sion that person.? who are disloyal will be
clothed with the powers of legislation : for
this could not happen when the Constitution
aud laws are enforced by a vicilant and
faithful Congress. Each House is made
the "judge of the elections, returns, and
qualifications of its own members," and
may, "with the concurrence of two-thirds,
expel a member." When a Senator1 or
Representative presents his certificate of
election, he may be at once admitted or
rejected ; or, should there be any question
as to his eligibility, his credentials may be
referred for investigation to the appropriate
committee. If admittod to a seat, it must
be upon evidence satisfactory to the House
of which he thus becomes a member, that
he possesses the requisite constitutional
and legal qualifications. If refused
admission as a member for want of
due allegiance to the Governments
and returned to liis constituents, they are
admonished that none but persons loyal to
the United States will be allowed a voice in
the Legislative Councils of the Nation, and
the political power and moral influence of
Congress are thus effectively exerted in tho
interests of loyalty to the Uovernment and
fidelity to the Union. Upon this question,
so vitally effecting the restoration of the1
Union and the permanency of our present
form of government, my convictions, here
tofore expressed, have undergone no change;
but, on the contrary, their correctness has
been confirmed by reflection and time. If
the admission of loyal members to seats, in
the respective Houses of Congress was wiso'
and expedient a year ago, it is no less wise
and expedient now. If this anomalous
condition is right now if, in the exact con
dition of these States at the present time,(
it is lawful to exclude them from represent
tation, 1 do not see that the question wilL
be changed by the efilux of time. Ten.
years hence, if these Statesremain as they
are,
the rightrol representation .will he no
stronger-
-the right of exclusion will be no
weaker.
The Constitution of the United States makes
it the duty of tho President to recommend to the:
consideration of Congress "uch measures a ho
fhall judge necessary or expedient. 1 know of
no measure more imperatively demanded by
every consideration of national interest, found
olicy, and equal justice, than tho admission ot
oval members from tho now unrepresented
States. This would consummate the work of
restoration, and exert a most salutary influence
in the re-establishment of peace, harmony, and
fraternal felling. It would tend -greatly to to--
new the confidence ot the American iteooie in
the virornnd stability ff their institutions. It
would bind us more closely tosCtller"as a nation,
and enable us to show to the, world the inherent
and recuperative power Of a Government found
ed upon tho will of a people, and established
pon the principles bf liberty, justico and intel
ligence. Our increased strength and enhanced
irospcniy would lrrciragaoiy demonstrate me
nllapv of the arguments aralnsl free Institutions
drawn from ourrccent national disorders by the
enemies of republican zorerninent. The admis
sion of loyal members from tho States now ex

THE TREAfltnty.
The report f the Secretary of the Treasury
affords mueh Information reelecting the ravenue
and eomiaeroa of the country. His views upon
tnfccurrcncy, and witu reterence to a proper ad
justment of our revenue system, internal as well
as impost, ar lommended to the careful con
sideration of Congress. In my last annual
mcssaga 1 expressed my general views upon
th.ose subjects. I need now only call attention
to. the necessity of carrying into every deDart-
mentof the: government a system of rigid ae-
coanusinty, toorougti retrenchment, and wise
ccon6iny. With no exceptional nor unusual ex
pondituros, the oppressive burdens of taxation
,e,u bo lessened by such a modification of our
revenue laws as will be consistent with the pub
lic faith, and the legitimate and necessary wants
of the government.'
Tho report represents a much' more f atisfac-
tpry condition o our usances than one year ago
tho most sang-.ine could have anticipated.
During thefisca! year ending the30th June,lS65,
tho last year of the war. the public debt was in
creased $W1,'02.537, and on lho 31st of
uctobor. lBbo, it amounted to 52.740.85,7l0.
untneaistdayot uetooer, iboo, it had been 're
duced to 3i55:3J0,OO6. the diminution, during a
eqnou or lourteen montas, commencing Kcptein
er 1, 1865, and ending October 31, IStiO.- having
been $20J,379,5G5. In the last annual report on
the state of thi finances, it was estimated that
uunnstntiaree quarters oi tne nscal year end
ing the 30th of June last, the debt vonlil bn in.
creased 112,194,917. During that period, how
ever, it was reduced S31,1(X3S7. the receipts of
me year naving oecn ssa.vua.yoo more, and tho
expenditures $20029,235 less than tho estimates.
Nothing could moro clearly indicate than these
statements the extent and availability of the
national, resources, and the rapidity and safety
with which, under ourform of government, great
militarr and n.ivnl pntnl!Iliment run tin rii.
banded, and expenses reduced from a war to a
peace looting.
During-the fiscal year ending (he 30th of June,
uw. w icvciii nciu ,uv, iuiu tne ex
penditures $520,750,940, leaving an available sur
plus of $37,2S1,60. It is estimated that the re
ceipts tor tne nscal year ending the 30th June,
1867. will b i475.0Gl.3S6. and thnt the hTnend!-
turcs will reach the sum of $316,423,078, leaving
in the Treasury a surplus of 8153,633.308. For
me jiscai year ending Juno 3U. 1863,'it It cstima-
eu mat tno receipts win amount to 436,000.000,
and that tho expenditures will bo $350,247,641
showing an excess of $85,752,359 in favor of the
uovernment. xnese estimated receipts may be
diminished by a reduction of exciso and import
amies: out alter an necessary reductions shall
have been made, the rei-enne. nf thn lti-ecnnt nmi

ed voluntcerrs standing ready to respond to tho
national call, large armies can be rapidly organ
ised, equipped, and concentrated. Fortifications
on.the coast and frontier have, received, or arc
being prepared for more powerful armaments;
lake surveys and harbor and river improvements
arc in course oi energetic prosecution, repara
tions have been made for the payment of the
additional bounties anthorized durinr tho venl
session of Congress, under such regulations as
will protect tno Government from fraud, and
secure to tho honorably-discharged soldier the
wen-earned reward ot his laithtuluess and cal
lantry. More than sixlthousand maimed soldiers
have received artificial limbs or other surgical
apparatus; and forty-ono national cemeteries,
containing the remains of 10J,a2o Union soldiers,
have already been established. Tho total esti
mate of military appropriations is 525,205,669.
THE NAVY.
It is stated in the report of theScretary of tho
Navy that the naval force, at tins time, consist
of two hundred and seventy-eight vessels, armed
with two thousand three hundred and fifty-ono
guns. Of these, ono hundred and fifteen vessels,
carrying one thousand and twenty-nine guns,
aro in commission, distributed chiefly among
seven straadrons. The number of men in the
service is thirteen thousand six hundred. Great
activity and vigilance have been displayed by
all the squadrons, and their movements have
Deen judiciously and efficiently arranged in such
a manner as would best nrnmntf AmrriMn mm.
incrce, and protect tho rights and interests of our
countrymen abroad, lho vessels unemployed
are undergoing repairs, or are laid un until iheir
services may bo required. Most of thciron-clad
uect isat JjeaguQ asland. m the Vicinity of Phil
adelphia, a Dlaco which, until ilecmvn nctinn
should be taken by Congress, was selected by tho
Secretary of tho Navy as tho most eligible loca
tion for that class of vessels. It is important
that a suitable public station should be provided
for the iron-clnrf fleet. It is intended that these
vessels shall bo in proper condition for any
emergency, and it is desirable that tho bill ac
cepting League Island for naval purposes, Trhich
passed the House of Representatives at its last
session, should receive final action at on early
ficriod.in order that there may be a suitable pub
ic station for this class of vessels, as well as &
navy yard of area sufficient for tho wants of
the servioe. on the Delaware river. The aval
Pension fund amounts to $11,750,000. having in
creased S2.750.000 during the year. The- expendi
tures oi me .Department lor the nscal yearend
ing30th June last were 343,324,526. awOhe esti
mates for the coming year amount to $23,568,436.
Attention is invited to the.condition- of.our sea
men, arid'tho importance of legislative measures
for their relief and improvement. The sugges
tions in behalf of this deserving class 6f our fel-low-citiiens
are earnestly recommended to tho
favorable attention of Congress.
rOSTOFFICE DETARTMEXT.
The report of the Postmaster General
presents a most satisfactory condition of
the postal service, and submits recommen
dations which deserve the consideration of
Congress. The revenues of the Department
for the year ending June 30, 1866, were
S14,3SC,9SC, and the expenditures' 515,352,
079, showing an excess of the latter of
S965,093. In anticipation of this.deficien
cy, however, a special appropriation was
made by Congress in the act approved July
2S 1866. Including the standing appro
priation of 5700,000 for free mail matter,
as a legitimate portion of the revenues yet
remaining urexpended, the actual deficit
for the past year is only $205,093 aum
within Sol,l41-of the amount estimated in
the annual report of 1SC4. The decrease
of revenue compared with the previous
year was one and one-fifth per cent., and
the increase of expenditure, owing princi
pally to the increase of the mail tervicelh
the. South, was twelve per cent. On the
30th of June last there were in opera-'
tion 6,930 mail routes, with an aggregate

IKTERIOH.
The report of tne Secretary of the Inte
rior exhibits the condition of those
branches of the public service which are
committed to his supervision. During the
last nscal, year 4,09.31 acres of public
land were disposod of, 1,892,516 acres of
which were entered under the homestead
act. The policy originally adopted relative
to the public lands has undergone essential
modifications. Immediate revenue, and
not their rapid settlement, was the cardinal
feature oi our land system. Long experi.-
ence ahd earnest discussion -have resulted
in the conviction that tbo early develop
ment of our agricultural resources, and the
diffusion of an energetic population over
our vast territory, are objects of far greater
importanco to the national erowth .and
prosperity than the proceeds of the sale of
the land to the highest bidder in open mar-

limited portion of "unoffered. lands" at the
minimum price. The homestead enact

oi purcnase money, ana secure liim a per

dence for a term of years. This liberal
policy invites emigration from the old, and
from the more crowded portious of the nev
world. Its propitious results are undoubt

when time shall have given to it a wider

Durinp; the iast fiscal vear the amon'nl

of disbursement, was thirteen million four

entire number of pensioners, June 30, 1866,
was one hundred and twenty-six thousand
seven hundred and twentv-two. Thia fact
furnishes melancholy and striking proof of
ine sacnuces maue .to vindicate the consti

that thirty-three million dollars will be re

THE JIISSI3IPPI RIVER.
As a subject cnon which depends an im
mense amount of the production and com-,
merce of the tonntr', I recommend tb
Congress such Iiislation as may be neces
sary for the preservation of the levees of
the Mississippi river. It is a matter of na
tional importance that early steps phoulS
be taken not only to add to the efficiency of
these barriers against destructive inunda

to the free and safe navigation of that great
channel of trade and commerce:
TIIE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
The District of Columbia, under existine
laws, is not entitled to that representation
in the National Councils which, from our
earliest history, has been uniformly accord
ed to each Territory established from time
to time within our limits. It maintains
peculiar relations to Congress, to whom the
Constitution has granted the powerof ex
ercisine exclusive legislation over the seat"
of government. Our fellowcitiiens re
siding in the District, whose interest-'Jat'e'
thus confided to the special guardianship of
Congress, exceed in number the population'
of several of our Territories, and no just,
reason is perceived why a delesrate of their'
choice should not be admitted to a seat in.
the House of Representatives. Ifo mode
seems Eo appropriate! and effectual of enax
bling them to'make known their peculiar'
condition and wants, arid of securing the
local legislation adapted to them. I there

TRANCE.
Iri the month of April last, as Coagie?s
is .'aware, a friendly arrangement was iqade
between (he Emperor of France and the
President af the united States for the with
drawal from Mexico of the French expedi
iiuimiv mimarv iurees. auis witnurawai
was to be eflected in three detachments,
the first of which, it was understood, would
leave Mexico In November, now past, the
second in March next, and the third mid
last in November. 1867. Immediately up
on the completion of the evacuation, the
French Government was to assume the same
attitude of non-intervention, in recard to
Mexico, as is held by ,ihe Government of
me united oiaies. repeated assurances
have been given by the Emperor, since that
agreement, that lie would complete the
juuiuitfu cvacuaiiuii wumii me penoa

It "was rcasonablv expected that the pro

Kepubliaof Mexico. The newly-appointed
Minister of the united States, Mr. Camp
heir, was therefore sent forward, on the 9th
day ot jovemter last, to assume his pro
per tunction3 as .Minister rienipptentiary
of the United States to that Republic. It
was also thought expedient that he should
be attended in the vicinity of Mexico by
the Lieutenant General of the Army of the
united btates, with the view of obtainin
such information as might be important to
determine the course that might be pursued
by tlm United Stateain re-establishing and

possessed for the restoration and permanent
establishment in that country of a domestic
and Republican form of Uovernment.
touch was the condition of affairs, in re
gard to Mexico, when, on the 22d of No
vember last, official information was id-
ceived from Pans that the Emperor of
Jf ranee liadrsome time beforcuecided not
to withdraw a detachment of his forces in
the month of November past.' according to
engagement, but that this decision was
made with the purpose of wtihdrawingthe
wnoie. ot those -lorces in the ensuing
spring. Vi this determination, however,
the united States had not received any
notice or intimation; and, so soon as the
information was received by the Govern
ment, care was taken to make known its
dissent to the Emperor of France.
I cannot foreed the !" "Franco will rn-
consider tho tut-ject, nnl adopt some resolution
in regard to the evacuation of Mexico which will

The attempt wa understood to be jaade in

on thifv Continent, was designed to aid in
obtaining redress for political grievances
which, it wa-s assumed, the people of Ire
