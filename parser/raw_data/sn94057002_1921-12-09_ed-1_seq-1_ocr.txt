reason why they were termed

happy minister, broken in spirit
and health, was prostrated by a
fever. His dying woids were,
' Had I served my God as I have

law was then passed which mada

Mary.
Mary was the daughter of
Henry VIII and Catherine. Soon
after her tccesfion she married
Philip .II, of Spain. She tore
down all her father's form of re
ligion, and made Catholicism the
religion of England. When
Cathoüo worship wai established
the Protestants were subject to
persecution. Among the many
great men she had murdered were
Latimer, Ridley, and Cramner.
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth, daughter of Henry
VIII and Anne Boleyn, was the
last cf the Tudor sovereigns,
She undid all that Mary had done
and made the English religion
Proteetart. She did this because
all her strength lay with the Pro
testants. She was the daughter
of Anne Boleyn, whose marriage
the Pope had-fnrdidden, and
every true Catholio was opposed
to her coming to the throne.
Elizabeth was very unscrupul
ous. She formed her own opin
ions, and would practice any
kind of decption and falsehood
to secure herelf in what she thot
was the right thing.
Elizabeth died in 1603. after
having reigned fortj'five years.
