If anything were needed to spur

A Prosing eetl
No sensible American disputes the
fact that the Philippines nre a prob
lem The situation has been compli
cated by the Supreme Court decision
on the tariff question It is the duty
of Congress to simplify that phase of
the matter as soon as possible
The explanation of the House Ways
and Means Committee yesterday in
reporting the new tariff bill was suf
ficient to end all argument except
that f the petty obstructionist The
reasons for passing the measure were
bucclnctly and amply set forth
The archipelago must be re formed
To that end rcenue must be provided
for the support of its government
Funds arc also needed for road and
harbor improvements which cannot
now be abandoned
In a nutshell the argument of the
committee majority in behalf of Mr
Paynes bill is convincing and thor
oughly reasonable It is free from
theatrical talk or buncombe It pre
sents the situation to Congress and to
the people xlainly and honestly It
appeals to common sense and pa
triotic spirit And it should result in
immediate action
Mr liar ns n Orator
In a way the memorial services to
be held as a tribute to the beloved
William McKinley and under the au
spices of Congress will be a national
affair Although a trifle belated they
will undoubtedly be clothed with a
dignity that could scarcely be con
ferred by any other management
The selection of Secretary Hay as
the eulogist for this occasion will
meet with national approbation Mr
Hay owing to his close relations with
the martyred Ohioan and his deep
feeling of personal loss through the
Uuffalo tragedy will undoubtedly de
liter an oration that will become a
classic among the utterances of our
living public men
And William McKinley is a fitting
Bubject for a modern Demosthenes

A New York boarding house keeper
suggests that a good investment for
Home capitalist would be the building
of boarding houses intended for
twenty or thirty occupants in some
respectable but pjiet part of the city
fihe says that as things now arc the
average woman in that business is
obliged to make the best of a house
not originally intended for more than
one family and often old and unfit
for human habitation and then the
landlady gets all the blame of the dis
comfort
To a certain extent this is true in
Washington though the lodging
house system has been In force here
bo long that new huuxes are often
built with at least one eye to the
keeping of lodgers Utit it is a fact
that the ideal boarding house is even
more rare than the ideal boarder
nu the discomforts of this mode of
existence are often due not so much
to Hie landlady or the servauts as to
conditions which they arc powerless
to change
The idal bimnting bouse would
have apirttnents cozy well planned
and eon accommodate ten
twenty or thirty iiersons according
t tlie cud character of the house
It wot 1 have plenty of bathrooms
an item Sn wliich the average Wash
ington bxlging house Is woefully de
fu ii nt and facilities for obtaining
unlimited hot and cold water an
other mutter which reipilres consid
erable contrivance in the average
house
It would have a large and well-ventilated
dining room planned especial
ly for the accommodation of large
companies of people and a kitchen
and laundry so arranged that every
body in the building would not know
what the dinner was to be as soon as
cooking began Hie rooms need not
be large but the closet room should
ample and there should be some
sort of lumber room for the storage
of trnnks and boxes
Such a house however is at present
to be found only In dreams and
dreams are not available for moncy
tnaking purposes
It is announced that the lloers are
talking of surrender After announce

When I took charge of our State
prison said Capt Eph Litlard of Kcn
tucly one of the first of Its Inmates to
renew a former acquaintance with mo
was OU1 Sam a darky whoso ono great
weakness was the crime of bigamy This
offence was the mare reprehensible In
him because of his lung career as a min
ister but the sanctity of his profession
seemed to have no restraining effect and
it grieves me to state incidentally that
Old Sam Is in durance vile at the present
moment
On our meeting he told mo various In
cidents In his prison career I had heard
him preach once during an interval of
liberty and asked him If he ever had a
chance to mate one of those long prayers
for which he had been famous At first
he laughed then quickly his face grew
serious and bo said Mr Llllard I has
something to tell you about that I
wants you to understand that tho man
who was warden here aturc you come was
a j owerful mean white man He seemed
to havo It in fur mo In pcrtlcIer and I
gits nuthln but hard treatment from him
from the fust day I lands Well jir one
day he ketches some uv us bojs a shootla
craps which I low was agin rules He
lowed be was going to have mc whipped
fur beln the ringleader and said that tho
man what used the whip should lay It on
to me fur as long as old Jake would take
to say a prayer Old Jake was a preacher
too but he wus a Baptist while I wus a
Methodist and wc haled each other enny
way
Lord Mr Llllard when tho man
brought out the whip an old Jake comes
along to say the prayer I knowed I WU3
In fur the hardest beating that ever a
nigger got I could see by the shine in
Jakes eyes that he wusnt goln tn have
enny mercy on roe and as I passed him I
whlspried Make It short Jake but he
sorter grinned and said nothin Well sir
he started off to prayin and the man laid
the lash on my back harder and harder
while that old vlllyun of a nigger grayed
for everything and everybody ULder the
sun I bought he took about four hours
and n half to finish but the flclal time
showed only twenty eight minutes Still
Ive allers held out that old Jake did It
for puro cuseodncss and It put mc agin
long prayers all the rest uv my life

The Governor lef during the day for
New York to try to recover some bonds to
the value of 20000 In one of the banks
of Gotham Only a few weeks ago he had
50000 ot State bonds of class A gilt
edged and held at a good premium in tbe
Eufaula National Bank That Institution
failed and a grand Jury has indicted somo
of its officers Ex Governor Oates claims
that these bonds which he had kept In
the bank for years were there as a special
deposit He learned that something less
than half their total amount had been
turned over to one of the New York

Glasgow has gone far In advance of

it la an old story that the water works

system of Glasgow are operated by the
city for the benefit of the people Hence
It la that our cltlsens get the cheapest
possible rates for the aim of profit mak
ing Is subordinated The cost of telephone
service Is 50 for the first year but irfter
that the rate Is J25 per annum with un
stinted use A very low price is charged
for gas but the electric light is expen

The two greatest benefits however
that tbe municipality seeks to establish
are the belter housing ot the poor and the
promotion of temperance among the work

houses that are comfortable well venti

point of view they will be slower to seek
tho places where liquor Is sold By giv
ing the artisans good homes at the lowest
possible rental not a cent of profit is

very embarrassing- as she had requested
Mr Trentanove to tell no one except his

sion That of course was not the cause
of her chango of mind ns cither Mrs
Trentanove or a cousin of Mrs Lane In

promise to the sculptor was the great
difference between them In the matter of
temperament She admires him exceed

Is honorable but his exacting and jealous
disposition was sure to result in unhap

Argentine Hare In London
One of the novelties in the London res
taurants today are hares from the Argen
tine Republic which are brought by hun
dreds ot thousands in refrigerator ships
with mutton and beef They were Intro
duced only a few months ago but were
quickly taken up by fashionable people
and are now nil the rage You will find
them on the menus of alt the big hotels
and fashionable restaurants and all tho
first class butcher shops keep thera for
the private trade
The experience of the farmers of the
Argentine Republic with such ground
garee is worth considering by tbe authori
ties of the United States In connection
with the Belgian hare craze Sixteen
years ago an English ranchman living In
the Province of Cordova Argentine Re
public Introduced a few English hares
for sporting purposes They Increased
so rapidly that they soon became a nuis
ance and It was custonary several tlnws
a year for the ranchmen In the mlghbor
hnod to call out all hands for a campaign
against them Somebody suggested tho
Idea of sending their carcasses to market
nd during the last three or four years
they havo been a staple article of food
and have become qulto popular particu
larly with tho working classes They aro
so plentiful that they can be sold at a
very low price Then somebody suggest
ed their export which Is likely to prove
a profitable enterprise and give a fixed
value to what people feared would be
come a public scourge
StrmiKi Slnmp Business
It used to be said of some of the smaller
South African Republics that they derived
their chief revenue by the issue of postage
stamps not for pcetofllce purposes but
for the encouragement of stump col

frequently changed That Is not very sur
prising in the case of tho little bankrupt
States but It Is rather startling to hear
that the Victorian Government In Aus
tralia has entered Into the philatelic busi
ness Not only does It denl In unused
stamps but also In copies neatly post
marked to order which are supplied In
sets at Ed cent off the face value It
Is fiirtherrcported that In order to pro
vent undue competition from those who
only deal in gem nely used stamps orders
have been given that stamps on letters
and packets are to be postmarked as
heavily as psclble Naturally enough
the regular stamp dealers arc complaining
of this unusual ccmpetltlon

BRADSTREETS ON THE WEEK
Itrport of tlnimrnflelnl Movement
In tli Lending Imltmlrlr
NEW YORK Dec Bradstreets to
morrow will say
The reactionary tons of speculation In
securities cereals aad provisions this
week only serves to bring Into sharper
contrast the reports of active retail and
holiday trade of unparalleled movements
clearings and unprecedented railroad
earnings
The tightness of money 13 on the
one hand a discouragement to specula
tion but Is nevertheless a reflection of
the increased demands of legitimate
trade which also find reflection in calls
on the Treasury Department for small
bills and chango to an extent uncommon
even at this period of tho yenr
Another reflection of tho excessive
prosperity if It may bo so styled Is tho
continued complaint of Insufficient car
room and lack of motive power which
come from cities
Holiday trade Is In full swing at all
markets while Jobbing distribution
naturally shows a quieting down prepara
tory to slock taking Nearly alt ndvlccd
touching these latter branches ot business
are encouraging and the years results
so far aa ascertained aro on the whole
very favorable
Among the Industries Iron and steel
are easily first In strength o demand and
prices and tho word buoyant about ac
curately describes tho situation a3 re
gards the feeling In the trade generally
Cotton alone of tho great agricultural
staples has strengthened this week on a
continuance of tho bullishness brought
out by the low Government estimate and
in spite of a crop movement some ot
which is classed as holiday cottou In ex
cess of last year Exports have reached
and passed last seasons record
Staple cottons are on the whole
firmer and sellers arc not as anxious as
a while ago Ginghams arc In very strojg
shape Woolen goods are In good demand
particularly for dress wear and many
mills aro busy on heavy weight reorders
Buclness failures for the week number
233 as against 237 last week and 217 la
this week last year
DUNS REVIEW OF -TRADE
DenllnaN In Holiday Goods Sarpns
All Previous Proportion
NEW YORK Dec 13 Duns review to
morrow will say
It 13 most fortunate that the vagaries
ot speculation are not always deleterious
to legitimate business Railway stocks
fell sharply yet full returns for Novem
ber show that earnings were 113 percent
greater than tn the same month last year
nnd 1S1 per cent over those of 18M In
dustrial and traction shares were even
more violently disturbed yet the manu
facturing plants of the nation were never
more fully occupied
Numerous labor controversies have
been settled and the rate of wages Is at
the nlghest point ever attained Retail
distribution Is of massive proportions
with dealings in holiday goods the con
spicuous feature This class ot business
uo fnr surpasses all provloas records that
It alone gives an unmistakable indication
of the nations prosperity even If other
more definite measures were not avail
able
Records of clearlng3 however express
the situation with exactness The volume
of trading in securities Is practically the
same as a year ago but exchanges
through the banks at this city for the
week were 203 per cent larger than a
year ago and 2SG per cent greater than
in Ii99 while at other leading cities tho
increases were 173 per cent over 1300 and
1SS per cent over 1SW

FREIGHT RATE UNJUST
Interstate Commerce Commission
Decides AKnlnst C C C St I-
Tho Interstate Commerce Commission
yesterday In an opinion by Commissioner
Prouty announced Its decision In the case
of Nathan Slyer vs the Cleveland Cin
cinnati Chicago and St Louis Railway
Company nnd others The decision Is In
favor of tho complainant The commis
sion holds that manifestly la determining
what freight rate shall be borne by com
modities an attempt should be made to
maintain a fair relation between those
commodities and a classification which
utterly ignores all considerations of this
kind or which utterly falls to glte due
weight to such considerations Is unjust
and unreasonable
In this case hatters furs and fur scraps
and cuttings which are classified as
double first class In the official classi
fication nre found to be fully as desir
able for traffic purposes ns commodities
named in tho first class of such classifi
cation The commission holds that hat
ters furs and fur scraps nnd cuttings as
compared with articles taking first class
rates In defendants classification Includ
ing hats the finished product for which
these commodities constitute raw ma
terial are unlawfully made double firsl
clsss and cannot lawfully be classed
higher than first class In such classifica
