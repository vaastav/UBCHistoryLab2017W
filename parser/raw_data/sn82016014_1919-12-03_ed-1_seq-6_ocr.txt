J J This was the declaration here last
nlpht of J. J. Marshall, export man
ager of a large American manufactur
ing company, who has lived at Jen
"Ttins's home in Puebla for the past
two months.
"Jenkins didn't have any more to
do with the charges made against him
than I did. Asa matter of fact." Mar
shall declared, "the charges against
him were changed so often that Jen
kins himself did not know half the
time what the new ones were.
"At the time they had Jenkins in
prison charged with 'abducting him
self they had a lawyer named Novoa
Imprisoned for abducting Jenkins.
And they arrested the watchman at
an accomplice."
The Mexican government's apparent
- desire to dispose of Jenkins's case
quickly. Marshall asserted, was to
avoid being forced to reimburse the
consular agent for the sum he paid as
ransom. They feared such a prece
dent would cost them huge sums if
once established, he said.
Didn't Have Chance.
Tf the United States government
Jiadn't stepped in when it did." he
continued, "they would have railroad
ed him to prison in short order. Jen
kins didn't have a chance.
"The courts would not take any tes
timony from his side of the case and
would send to Mexico City only such
testimony as would go against him.
Every method was used to make the
Indians and peons give the testimony
the court wanted.
"One day they brought in a bunch
of Indians from Jenkins's ranch to
testify. The prosecuting attorney told
them to say they saw Jenkins at his
ranch October 22n They refused. The
attorney ordered the guards to take
five of them outside. In a few minutes
rifle shots were heard.
Intimidated Witnesses.
"The guards came back In the room
and the attorney again asked the
Indians if they wanted to give the de
sired testimony. They did.
"But the five were not really shot.
They were led outside and held while
the guards fired in the air. This is
Just an instance of how testimony was
obtained.
"The officials are Just now taking
his case seriously, but the government
is doing all it can to cover up the
worst parts. As a matter of fact, a
foreigner can't walk the streets in
Mexico City and be safe. There have
fceen numerous cases where the police
itave heid up foreigners."
Marshall was here on his way -east.

and extra blankets and clothing were
issued from the quartermaster depot

Topeka War Vetera Beliere In
Prcpurlny for Governor Allen's
Coll to Help in Coal Fields.
Scenes in many Topeka homes just
prior to the calling out of the national
guard for the world war are being re
played today, because of the fuel situ
ation and Governor Allen's call for
guards for the mines.
The single point of difference be
tween the acts now and the acts of
1917 is that that preparations in the
homes go forward with much more
precision and less fuss over detail.
Former national guardsmen, now
veterans of St. Mihiel, the Argohne
and Verdun, have their war worn uni
forms strung all about the houses.
Buttons are being fastened securely;
in some cases the cut of the uniform
"jibs" are being altered to fit enlarged
forms, and hob nailed shoes are the
objects of anxious solicitude.

Cummins Bill Sharply Attacked
in Senate Today.
Prospects for Speedy Vote on
Railway Bill Fade.
Washington, Dec. 3. The Cum
mins railroad bill was before the sen
ate today with, Its anti-strike provision
and other clauses drawing sharp at
tack. Supporters of the measure had
hoped for Its speedy adoption but they
now foresee exhaustive discussion of
the bill before it is brought to a final
vote.
In the house where the five billion
dollars appropriation bills were sub
mitted the Hepublican forces have
adopted a "hold down" policy and
sharp clashes over the appropriations
were expected.
Resolutions authorizing a congres
sional investigation of the Ford-Newberry
election contest and of Senator
Watson's charges of radical activity in
the federal trade commission may be
passed today by the senate.
None of the senators seemed to be
able to put their finger on the exact
status of the German peace treaty and
appeared to be satisfied with letting
it rest for the present,

The inquiry will be conducted by
the senate interstate commerce com

was broadened at Senator Cummins's
suggestion.

CUT FUEL AGAIN
Purdy Warns Edison Company
40 Per Cent Basis Probable.
Action Will Be Taken If Coal Is
Jiot Received In Two Weeks.''
Altho the Topeka Edison company
has on hand supply of fuel that will
last only about two weeks. A. H.
Purdy, superintendent, announced to
day that the actual saving due to the
emergency fuel conservation ordinance
has greatly exceeded his expectations.
If coal does not materialize in the
next two week, the Edison company
will have to go on & 40 per cent basis,
Purdy declared.
The Edison plant is equipped with
oil boilers capahlof furnishing 13,000
horse power. Their coal burning boil
ers generate 21,000 horse power.
Purdy stated that It wa impossible to
keep the oil burning boilers operating
all the time. The company is now
facing a shortage In fuel oil. Altho
the Edison company has a contract
calling for one car of oil por day. they
have received only two cars since the
middle of November.
Purdy today said he Old not care to
stir up a scare but conditions were
critical and that Topeka customers of
the company must be prepared to go
on a 40 per cent consumption basis
in the very near future unless coal
was received soon.
Purdy declared that a discontin
uance of the business now drawing on
the company for lights heat and power
in the evening would not afford any
appreciable relief.
The company furnishes light to
S.500 residences. Other consumers are
hotels and restaurants, safety lights In
all business, theaters, Santa Fe offices,
pool halls, telegraph and telephone es
tablishments, and drug stores. In run
ning their equipment even to light the
residences the company generates
enough steam to heat the buildings
down town. The light consumption in
the down town districts at night is
very light under present regulations.
Purdy has advocated all along that
steam be kept in the mains If possible
fur the reason that to allow buildings
to become ice cold would' create more
of a demand at the opening hours in
the morning. He suggested turning
off radiators and allowing the exhaust
steam to penetrate steam pipes in the
buildings which would keep them
warm to a certain extent.

BED IN HAYSTACK
Runaway Detention Home Girls
Located by County Officers.
Bernice Bozartb, 14, In Jail
After Second Escape.
MABEL CRAWFORD AT MAYETTA
Two ;Also Stayed In Deserted
Honse Without Food.
Were Driven by Hunger to Raid
on Bozarth Pantry.
With a haystack for a bed for two
nighta and an empty house , in East
Hill as, a home, Bernice, Bozarth, 14,
and Mabel Crawford, 14, who escaped
from the county detention home a
week 'ago Saturday night, escaped de
tection for two days and two nights.
Cold, hungry and ready to surrender
the girls went to the home of the
Bozarth girl's parents, east of Topeka
on the Seward avenue road.
They remained there until Thursday
when . the Crawford girl obtained
money sufficient to take her to May
etta, where she has relatives. Juvenile
officers today finally learned that the
Bozarth girl was at her. home. Miss
Eva Corning, - probation officer,' and
Sheriff Hugh Larimer went out to the
Bozarth home today where .hey found
the girl. This afternoon she was in
the county Jail. ... , ; '
"After we slipped out of the deten
tion" home Saturday night," said the
Bozarth girl today, "we went out east
on Fourth street until we were in the
country. We slept in a haystack that
night. The next morning early we
went over to East Hill where we found
an empty house. .
"Mabel had some matches. We
gathered wood, put it in an old stove
which we found in the house and
stayed there that day without a bite to
eat. When It was dark we Blipped
away and went to my home.
Dressed In Overalls.
"The folks were going into town
that night and we hid in a shed until
they left. Then we opened a window
and went right to the pantry where we
got some food. Next, we hunted up
some warm clothes. I put on overalls.
"We left the same way we came and
slept in the same haystack that night.
The next night we decided to give up
and went home."
The girl asserted that her mother
told them she should not report them
to officers but if officers came out to
the house she would not hide the girls.
The only notification the- mother
ever received of the girls' escape didn't
come from juvenile officers. It came
thru Mrs. Loretta Fowler, who was
adjudged insane today in probate
court, who called at the house at 2
o'clock Sunday morning, a few hours
after the girls' escape, according to
the story told by Bernice today.
"She come out at 2 o'clock, mother
told me." said the girl. "Then she was
out at 4 o'clock "the same morning,
and called again at 6 o'clock Sunday
afternoon."
The money furnished the Crawford
girl to go to Mayetta was money
which the Bozarth girl said she had in
her possession. It is expected Juvenile
officers will endeavor to locate the
Crawford girl at Mayetta. Bernice
stated Mabel left Thursday.
Ordered to Lnsing.
At the time of the Crawford girl's
escape she was reported to be under
treatment by city medical officers
for a social disease. That morning
she had been ordered sent to Lansing
for treatment by Judge James A. Mc
Clure in the district court who denied
a petition for a writ of habeas corpus
filed by Mrs. Loretta Fowler in the
girl's behalf. Both girls were arrested
in connection with the grade school
scandal. .
About a month ago the Bozarth girl
and Hazel McEwen. another girl, es
caped from the detention home and,
according to their story, were taken to
a room in a house on Topeka avenue
where they stayed three days and
thre nights with two boys, , who,
they claimed bought them hoys'
clothes, which the girl said, they wore
on the streets of Topeka and to test
their disguise passed up and down in
front of police headquarters without
detection. The hoys' clothes which the
girls assert they wore are in the hands
of juvenile officers and will Be used
as evidence against one of the two
boys who is now under arrest charged
with a statutory crime. The otner
boy escaped.
Prior to this escapade, two other
boys were arrested as a result of stor
ies told by the McEwen and Bozarth
girls, and are facing trial on statutory
charges in the criminal court in Jan
uary. ELK MEMORIAL SERVICE

Ygnaclo Bonlllas, Mexican ambassa
dor, was expected to present to Sec
retary Lansing today the evidence sup
plied by the Mexican government to
support the charge of perjury against
Jenkins. This evidence was forwarded
to Bonlllas by Hilario Medina, act
ing minister of foreign affairs of Mex
ico, according to reports from Mexico
City.
State department officials were not
surprised when shown the United
Press exclusive interview with Medina,
in which the foreign minister declared
Mexico's position in the Jenkins's case
is the same today as stated in the
Mexican note refusing the Unite States
"request" for his liberation. There is
a growing relief in official Washington
that Mexico will refuse a second time
to release Jenkins.
Information reached here today of
kidnaping of Norman Rowe, a British
subject, by rebels at Zacatecas. who
held him for ransom. The British vice
consul at Zacatecas immediately oro-
tested and reported the abduction to,
the British consul general at Mexico
city. The government at once effected
Rowe s release.
It is held by many here that-British
subjects are accorded far better treat

Americans, due principally to the fact
that Great Britain has not recognized
