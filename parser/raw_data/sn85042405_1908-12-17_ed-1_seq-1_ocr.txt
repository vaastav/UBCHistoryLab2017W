San Francisco, Dec. 16.—Charles
Harvey, a retired soldier, who has
been post quartermaster sergeant ai.
Fort Rosecrans for some time, drew
from Colonel George R. Smith, chiel
paymaster of the department of Call
fornia, the sum of $13,900, the amount

second largest sum the chief paymas

to a soldier. Besides this amount
Harvey will receive for the rest of his

The Shillalah.
the shiQalah owes its name to the
fact that the finest specimens thereof
used to be grown in the pleasant
groves of trees that formerly flourish
ed in the barony of Shillalagh, in
County Wicklow. The best shillalab
must be a root sprung sapling, for one
taken from the branches of a full
grown tree would lack the necessary
toughness. Being trimmed and
"brought to band," the young stick
undergoes preparatory discipline by
being placed in the chimney to season,
thus becoming early acclimatized to
the bot work in store for It This part
of the curriculum finished, it is rub
bed until completely saturated with
oil, after which it is securely wrapped
In a stout sheet of brown paper and
buried in a convenient hotbed. At
this staige of Its development it is an
object of unceasing watchfulness on
the part of its proprietor, who to fore
stall any detrimental warp in the ob
ject of his care visits it dally, correct

Ornaments of the Peerage.
Lord Lyvedeg is an ardent peera.
reformer and tells an anecdote in this
connection for whose authenticity be
pledges himself. This narrates bow a
famous statesman of the nineteenth
century was called upon to visit—his
son in prison. He bitterly reproached
him, remarking, "Here am I, having
worked my way up from a middle
class home to a great position, and
when I die you will be the greatest
blackguard in the peerage." The son
listened quietly and then replied, with
terrible irony, "Yes—when you die."
Another of Lord Lyveden's peerage
stories Is equally piquant. The son of
a peer applied to a friend in the north
of England for a housekeeper and was
recommended a certain Mrs. Brown.
The peer wrote to the woman accord
ingly to the effect that, having learned
particulars of her character, he was
willing to engage her as his house
keeper and making an appointment for
her to call and see him on a certain
date. The good woman replied:
My Lord—From what I have learned of
your character I decline to enter your
bouse.
I
am your lordship's obedient
servant, ANNE BROWN.

The Plays Mixed.
During one of his tours in this coun
try. when the late Sir Henry Irving
was playing "Twelfth Night" in New
York, he revealed absentmindednesa
and greatly amused the members of
his company and the audience. As
Malvollo be was expressing surprise
at a remark of Sir Toby.
"Do you know what you say?" be
asked.
To his surprise, a roar of laughtet
echoed through the house, and his
stage associates were convulsed.
He repeated the line, putting undue
emphasis on the pronoun, and again
the audience shouted with laughter.
It was not until after the perform
ance he learned that quite unconscious
ly he had been parodying the well
known words of "The Private Secre
tary." His only explanation was that*
it was done in a bit of forgetfulness
while thinking of the other play.—

AN0THER_ARM0RY
Dedication of New Bismarck
Armory. Description of
Building.
The dedicatory exercises of the
new armory of Co. A at the Capital
city Tuesday night were brilliant.
Remarks by Rev. Harris. Gov. Burke,
Adj. Gen. Poole were made and an
elegant ball and supper closed the
festivities. The Tribune gives the
following description of the building:
The armory is a brick structure 50x
140 feet in size and consists of a base
ment 12 feet high and drill hall a
few feet above the level of the street
line. The entrance to the main hall
is gained by broad steps to a plat
form where large doors open into the
drill room which is one of the best
in the state being entirely free of
posts or other obstructions in its en
tire area. It has a hard, maple floor
of exceeding smoothness, being de
signed for use in dancing as well as
for more arduous work. The walls
are plastered and the ceilings are
high and painted most artistically.
In the west or front end cf the build
ing there is a'balcony which will seat
100. persons. Under this on the main
floor are the officer's room, the ticket
office and ladies' cloak room. In the
basement is the room devoted to the
use of the Grand Army as long as it
shall care to use it, the toilet and
baths, kitchen, locker rooms, quar
termaster's room and coal and fur
nace room, all so arranged so as to
leave a large center room which will
be a men's room and shortly be filled
with gymnasium apparatus for the
use of members. All is most com
plete and on festive occasions the
basement will make an excellent mess
room as the culinary department will
be supplied with all the necessities
for suppers and things like that.
Completed, the building will cost
in the neighborhood of $14,000, of
which sum the company raised all
but 85,000, which the state advanced
as provided in the armory law. Each
man will be supplied with a metal
locker for the storage of his equip
ment, which lockers are supplied
with master locks so that the pres
ence of the quartermaster is required
before the man can open it and in
this way there will be little cause of
complaint about mixing clothing,
etc. There are many other little in
novations which have been provided
for the betterment of the company
and the zest with which the mem
bers have entered into their new
home augers well for the future effi
ciency of the command.

HELLO SYSTEM
Railroad Companies Putting in
Telephones For Train
Dispatching.
As part of the movement which
seems to be in progress among the
railroads of the country to substitute
the telephone for the telegraph for
train dispatching, the Great North
ern is planning a considerable ex
tension of its telephone system, and
before long train orders along nearly
1,400 miles of the system will be giv
en through the telephone transmitter
instead of through the telegraph key.
Jt was stated Monday at the gen
eral offices of the road that a tele
phone system for train dispatching
purposes was being installed on the
Mlnot division, which extends from
Devils Lake to Williston, a distance
of 230 miles, and that the work of
installation was nearly completed.
When this is finished the telephone
system will be extended from Willis
ton to Cutbank, Mont., over the
Montana division, a distance of 437
miles, and also along the Butte divi
sion, which covers 507 miles. As the
Great Northern is now,this will give
a grand total of 1,386 miles of line.
The Northern Pacific, which for
some time has been dispatching
trains between here and Fargo by
telephone as well as blocking them
in the same manner for the 250 miles
distance, is about to put in a tele
phone blocking system also between
Trout Creek, Mont., and Spokane, a
distance of 125 miles, on its Idaho
system. Trains will be dispatched
over this division by telegraph, how'
ever.—Fargo Call.
STOLE COMMUNION VESSELS
Grand Forks, N. D., Dec. 14.
Some sacrilegious thief or thieves
broke into the sanctuary of the Sa
cred Heart church, and stole the
holy (xrfhmunion vessels, consisting of
the solid gold chalice and the two
ciboriums, one of gold and the other
of silver.
The robbery is one of the boldest
that has ever occurred in the city
and the police are using every effort
to locate the thief and the holy ves
sels. When Mr. Tessier, the janitor,
entered the church Saturday morn
ing to ring the bell, he did not no
tice anything out of order, but when
he returned in the afternoon, he no
ticed the tabernacle was open and
the holy vessels gone.
Rev. Father Greene is in the habit
of locking the tabernacle, but during
his illness, he now being confined to
the hospital, the tabernacle was
locked and "the key placed near at
hand, where it was located by the
thief. The church is left open on
Saturday for the accommodation of
worshippers.

CO. A BISMARCK
Endorse the Work and Efforts
of Adj. General For the
Militia Boys.
Bismarck, Dec. 15.—At a regular
meeting of Co^ "A", N. D. N. G.,
held at its Armory on Nov. 16th,
1908, the following resolution was
adopted by the unanimous vote of
the company.
Whereas: It ill becomes a soldier
to be ungrateful, we the members of
Co. "A", N. D. N. G., being mind
ful of the great services our Adju
tant General, T. H. Poole, has ren
dered to the State of North Dakota
and to the National Guard of our
state, deem it fit and proper that
we herein record some of the services
he has rendered the state and guard.
The regular army inspection held
in April, 1908, show the Guard to be
more nearly the standard required by
the war department, not only in per
sonell but in equipment, for which
he was responsible.
Largely thru his personal encour
agement and initiative the armories
at Dickinson, Hillsboro, Lisbon and
Bismarck have been made possible.
In August, 1907, he sent a team
from this state to participate in the
National rifle competition (the first
ever to attend from this state)
which team acquitted itself with
credit to the state.
By his effective services, the his
tory of which every man in the com
pany is familiar with, we were able
to participate in the regular army
maneuvers at American Lake this
year, and had the most instructive
maneuvers ever attended by this
command.
The appropriations for the mainte
nance of the Guard have been wisely
allotted and expended to secure the
greatest good and highest efficiency
of the Guard.
We now have a first class rifle range
well equipped which lias been built
during his administration.
His services thruout his tour have
been marked by conscientious devo
tion to duty, unmarred by/personal
or political preferences, where no de
tail was too small to receive his at
tention: under his administration
harmony prevailed and no factions
existed.
Be it therefore resolved: That we,
the members of Co. "A" First In
fantry, North Dakota National
Guard, are mindful of the high char
acter of his services, heartily endorse
his administration as most efficient
and beneficial to the Guard, and do
commend him to His Excellency, the
Commander in Chief. lor .re-appoint
ment.
Recorded in company records, 47
men being present and voting.
Introduced by W. C. Green, moved
by Winters, seconded by McCormick,
that the chair be instructed to cast
a unanimous ballot for the adoption
of the resolution.
Which motion carried, all members
voting, Aye. Carried.
A true copy.

Capt. Cmdg. "A."
FOUND ANCIENT DEER HEAD
The well diggers "at the new test
city well, made an unusual find yes
terday, when about nine feet below
the surface. They uncovered the
head and horns of a large deer, burled
to that depth and embedded in
coarse sand. The sand around the
remaining part of the skeleton of the
animal, was not disturbed, and the
entire body of the deer appears to
have been entombed, doubtless many
ages ago, and burled under the sedi
ment of the ancient lake or river
that once filled this valley from
shore to shore. The horns are in
good state of preservation and appear
to be solidly petrified.
