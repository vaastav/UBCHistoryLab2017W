PORT TOBACCO;
Friday Morning, December 8,1882.
The President’s Message.
The annual message of President Arthur
was read in both houses of Congress en
Monday. It exhibits evidences of having
been carefully prepared, and presents a
fall and elaborate discussion of the more
prominent questions upon which Congress
will be cal'ed upon to legislate. A good
deal of space is devo ed to a discussion of
our foreign relations, which are represent
ed as amicable and sa'isfactory on a'l sides
The message offers an explanation of the
indefinite postponement of Mr. Blaine’s
“peace Congress” and the uninviting of
the invited powers, which it states was
necessitated by the failure of Congress to
make any provision for the necessary ex
penses er the concern. The Executive
disclaims any hostility to the theory upon
which this Congress was cal'ed, and adds
“I am unwilling to dismiss this subject
without assuring you of my support of
any measures the wisdom of Congress may
devise for the promotion of peace on this
continent and throughout the world, and
I trust that the time is nigh when, with
the universal assent of civilized peoples,
all international difficulties shall be deter
mined without resort to arras, by the be
nignant process of arbitration.”
Upon the question of diminishing the
government revenues the President dwells
at some length. As was predicted he ap
pears to think that “free rum and taxed
salt” wou’d be a rather poor platform for
the Republican party in 1884. He advises
a diminution, but not an abolition of the
internal revenue taxes. He recommends
that the tax upon dUtilled spirits should
be retained, while that upon fermented
liquors and upon tobacco be abrogated.—
This, the President thinks, would render
a simplification of the collective machin
ery of this branch of the revenue practica
ble and effect a saving in that regird ot
two and a half millions of dol'ars per an
num. He is of opinion that excise taxes
have never been favored by the American
people and appears to think that impost
taxes are less objectionable. He continues:
“The sentiment of the country doubtless
demands that the present excise tax shall
be abolished as soon as such a course can
be safely pursued. It seems to me, how
ever. that for various reasons so sweeping
a measure as the total abolition of inter
nal taxes would, lor the presen’, be an
unwise step. Two of these reasons are
deserving of special mention: 1. It is by
no means clear that, even if tha existing
system of duties on imports is continued
without modification, those duties alone
will yield sufficient revenue for a l the
needs of the government. It is estimated
that one hundred millions of dollars will
be required for pensions during the com
ing year, and it may well be doubted
whether the maximum annual demand for
that object has yet been reached. Uncer
tainty upon this question would alone jus
tify, in my Judgment, the retention for the
oresent of that portion of the system of
internal revenue which is leist objection
able to the people. 2. A total abolition
of excise taxes would almost inevitably
prove a serious, if not an insurmountable,
obstacle to a thorough revision of the |
tariff, and to any consideraVe reduction
in import duties.
Upon the question of revision of the
tariff the message says : The revenue from
customs for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1879, amounted to $137,000,000. It lias
in the three succeeding years reached first
$186,000,000, then $198,000,000, and final
ly ashas beena'readj stated, $220,000,000
The income from this source for the fiscal
year which will end on June 30th, 1883,
will doubtless be considerably in excess
of the sum last mentioned. If the tax on
domestic spirits is to be retained, it is
plain, therefore, that large reductions Irom
the customs revenue are entirely feasible.
"While recommending this reduction, I am
far from advising the abandonment ot the
policy of so discriminating in the adjust
ment of detai’s as to afford aid and pro
tection to domestic labor. But the pre
sent system should be so revised as to
equalize the public burden among all
classes and occupations, and bring it into
closer harmony with the present needs of
industry without entering into minu’e de
tails, which, under present circumstances,
is quite unnecessary. I recommend an
enlargement of the free list so as to inc’ude
within it the numerous articles which
yield inconsiderable revenue—a sinplifi-
Cation of the complex and inconsistent
schedule of duties upon ceitaiu manufac
turers, particularly those of cotton, iron
and steel, and a substantial reduction of
the duties Upon those articles, and upon
sugar, molasses, silk, wool and woo'en
goods. If a general revision of the tariff
shall be deemed to be impracticable a'
this session, I express the hope that at
least some of the more conspicuous in
equalities of the present law may be cor
rected before your final adjournment.
It is rather difficult to distinguish be
tween the recommendations of the Presi
dent upon this question of tariff, and the
principle repeatedly enunciated in Dem
ocratic platforms; “Tariff for revenue,
with incidental protection.”
The President refers to the history of
the star route frauds, and concludes by
saying that “if any guilty persons shall
finally escape punishment for their offences
it will not be for lack of diligent and
earnest efforts on the part of the prosecu
tion.”
Upon the question of reform in the civil
service of the government, the messige is
unequivocal, and the views expressed by
the President upon this question will
meet with the warm commendation of all
thoughtful citizens irrespective of party.
Upon this point the message says ;
“I trust that before the close of the pre
sent session some decisive action may be
taken tor tbe correction of the evils which
inhere in the present me hods of appoint
ment, and I assure you of my hearty co
operation in any measures which arc like
ly to cenduce to that end. As to the most
appropriate term and tenure of the official
life of the subordinate employes of the
government, it seems to be generally a
greed that, whatever their extent or char
acter, the one should be definite and the
other stable, and that neither should be
jjgalated by zeal ia tbe ser <t of party
jor fidelity to the fortunes of an individ
ual. It matters little to the people at large
; what competent person is at the head of
| Hus department or that bureau, if they
! feel assured that the removal of one and
i the accession of another will not involve
the retirement of honest and faithful sub
ordinates, whose duties are pure y admin
| is rative and have n> legitimate connec
tion with the triumph of any political
principles or the success of any political |
party or fiction.” j
Upon the whole Mr. Arthurs message is
an ab'e and we I considered paper. In
the expression of his views the President]
appears to rise decidedly above the level
of a partisan, and he sustains throughout j
• a well worn dignity becoming his high
station.
Oar Judiciary System.
In the Annapolis correspondence of the j
Baltimore D<uj of the 30th ulto, 'he follow
ing comments were made concerning the
administration of justice iu the Court of
Appeals ;
Considerable dissatisfaction was manifested
on Tuesday by lawyers who came here ex
pecting to argue their cases in the Court of
Appeals, when only three judges, as stated in
Tuesday's Dai, put in their appearance,leaving
. the court without a quorum. This want of a
quorum, which frequently occurs, is a subject
of much annoyance to lawyers and their clients.
It was said here on Tuesday that one case from
Allegany county had been set for a hearing at
five different times, thus putting the lawyers in
| the case to the expense of tire trips from Cumb
erland to Annapolis and hack, 'this case -= ti 11
remains to lie heard. This state of aft'urs is
owing greatly to the present Judiciary svslem,
! which makes the judges of the Court of Ap
peds do double duty, attending on their
I circuits and also on the Court of Appeals.
1 But wide this is true it is claimed by many
.! that the fudges are in some cases themselves to
. be blamed for this condition of affairs, one of
them staying at home in the hope that another
will go to constitute a quorum and that his
presence there will, therefore, not be needed
However this may he. it is a fact to be regretted
' that from some ciuse it frequently happens
, that th Court of Appeals is without a quorum
and it is contended that some means should be:
1 at once devised to avoid such a condition of
affairs in the future.
Considerable diss ids! icti m of a simi
lar character has heretofore frequently had
expression in different sections of the State
In addition to the inconvenience to suit
or* and delay of justice above compl lined
. of, as an incident of the present judiciary
system of the State, there li is been an
opinion prevailing '<> 3 >:nc extent in legal
circ'es, thit there is a great reluctance,
amounting aim >s' tv preju lice, on the
part of the -Iu Iges of the C >urt of A ope 1
to reverse the rulings of one of their fel
] low judges in his circuit. This, in the
opinion of many lawyers, m >re thin over
balances the supposed advantage of the
superior learning siid to be brought to
the Beach of the circuits by the Chi f
Judge, who is fresh from the discussions
, of the appellate court.
Tha presen. judiciary system wis firs'
adopted in this State by the cons itution
of 1867. Prior to tha - tme the Court of
Appeals and the circuit courts ha 1 i>. n
entirely distinct an 1 sepirate tribunals.—
The duties of the Ju Ig sof the appe 1 ite
tribunal were limit ■ 1 entirely to the hear
ing an 1 deciding of cises before that tri
bunal. Consequently there was no excuse
for not hiving a quorum of Ju Iges at all
times, and tbe a Ivmtige of a ful ben h
for the hearing of al! cases ol importance
which under tbe present system is rarely
ever attain iblo, wis then easily secured.
The present system was modeled sfter the
Federal judiciary system, tbe efficiency
and excellence of which is generally con
ceded. in I h is tn ny a 1 vacates among the
legi profes ion. Tii re is one ini >r ant
I difference, however. I> twee i the two ?vs
tems; under tbe Fed r i! system, the judges
are only require 1 to I > circuit duty dur
ing the vacation of the court, and the effi
ciency of the Supreme Ben, lids not there
by imp lire I : while, iu M .ryliti I, the
judges are required, or p r nitted, to do
circuit duty whenever their circuit courts
are in session, which occurs at all turns
during he yeir, and results in serious and
frequent interference with the duties of
the judges in the appellate cour.
By the constitution of 1867, another
con-titutiona’ convention is required to!
he held in 1887, and it is not improbib e
that the present ju liciary system will he
, then abolished, or materia ly rn idified I
, It is probable, too, tint an eff.rt w i 1 )> |
then made to have the appointing p >wer
, of the judiciary again vested in the Gov- j
ornor. Many contend that the misses ot I
the voters, even whore a to'er ible standard
I of in'elligence prevails, arc not co upe eut
, to judge of the qualifications of the ju li
f ciary, and it is urge 1 with much force!
. that the appointing p iwor to these ui >st
important offices should be vested in the
, Executive of the State. If any essential
, change should be made in the present ju
, dietary system in 1387, whether the pre
sent mode of se’ection b; re lined or not.
[ a new election of the State ju liciary would
. be rendeied necessary.
i ““““““
f Among the bills introduced into the
, House on Monday were the following:—
, To further pro'ect e nployees of the gov
[ eminent from political asses* nen's; to re
i duce internal reve nit tax ition ; to reduce
! letter p istage to two cen's; to repeal the
. internal revenue laws; to abolish the ofii
. ces of assistant secretary of wir and nnvv:
to preserve tbe elective franchise an I pun
• ish bribery and other offenses against a
. free ballot.
Anbi Pacha was arraigned in the court
martial convened for his trial at Ciiro on
the 3rd inst. All the charges agiinst the
r insurgent chief, except one, were ahan
doned by the prosecution. He was ar
j raigned upon the charge of rebellion, to
, which he pleaded guilty. A sentence of
death was then passed upon him by the
court, which was subsequently commuted
by the Khedive to exile for life, with a
proviso that, if he ever returned to the
i Egyptian dominions, the sentence of dea’b
, shall be executed. A raid's bearing before
I the court martial is said to h ive been very
I dignified. It is thought he will be sent
to the Cape of Good Hope. I is reported
that the action of the Khedive in dealing
so severely with Arab! lias created so
■ much indigna ion among the religious
1 party, of wnich Arabi was a devoted lead
er. that great fears of the assassination of
the Khedive are entertained.
I Anne Arundel county went for local
■ option at an election held on last Tuesday,
and now the legislators to Maryland’s an
cient capital will have to revel on cold
. water and coffee. Truly, a sid (?) pros
pect.
INTER\AL KKVE\UE
The Commissioner Iteeiiiiiineinls a De
cided Reduction in the Taxes.
The report of Commissioner of Internal Re
venue llama has been submitted to the Secre
tary ot ihe Treasury. He begins Oy advocating
the reduction ot taxes, because of the enormous
increase of internal revenue receipts iu each
succeeding year. In 1479 the receipts were
j $ 113,000,000, w hile those of the present fiscal
( year will not fall far short of 8 145,000,000.
jbi support of his stand he quotes ihe maxim
I that uo more revenue should lie raised th in is
necessary for an economical administration of
the government and a gradual reduction of the
| public debt. If the present rate of paying Ihe
public debt be continued all the bonds subject
j V) call will be paid within three years, after
i which time the government will lie compelled
in order to dispose of its surplus revenue to
buy in open market the -4} per cent, bonds,
which fall due in 1591,0 r the 4 per cents,
which fall d-.e in 1007. These would naturally
advance in twice to 25 or ;til oer real, premnun,
IO pay which he regarded a w I le iC the p o
{ tde’s money. The principal o! the public de d
| should be cxiinguished only at the rate nece--
sarr to meet the rnpuaeiiisiiis of the sinking
fund, and that there me a reduction of from
sixty to seventy millkxisof d iliars. Mr. Rmm
then goes on to recommend the retention of the
taxes on distilled, spit its, mall liquors, tobacco
and cigars, and the* abolition of taxes on fric
tion matches, [valent medicines, perfumery and
bank capital, checks and deposits, which
am unit in all to 814, 744,22.4 77. To the
eighteen and three quarter millions of reduc
tion thus propos 'd Congress should ad I a re
dunion in the charges for special taxes to deal
ers in articles tax-d fr internal revenue s iti
stuntially as proposed in tile bill now pen ling
before the Senate.

publication in the N w York S in of Tucsiav
of a three-calumn sutem-nt from the l.atr
Thurlow Weed, which was sworn to before a
N'ew York notary on the 28th of Sep ember
last. In this st item-mt Mr. Weed gives i his
tory of tlie dis ippesr or e of Morgan, who li id
ntdea disclosure of Muonic secrets, and in
the abduction of whom h“ says “it was are)
known that Free M msons were concerned "
Mr. Wee 1 then gives a long account of the step?
which he and other leading anti-Masons look
to discover tlie whereabout? ad fate of Morgan
and mentions alleged instances of persecutions
'o which he w is subjected because of his ef
forts. Mr. Weed gives his exped-m-e with
me EUsha Adams, “who was an ievailid
soldier while M >rgan was confined in a maga
zine at Fort Niagara,” who informed him that
the supposed Morgan was taken in a carri age
from the fort and placed in a boat, and th it
the boat afterwards returned without the sup
posed Morgan, but when Alims was put on
tha stand tie swore he knew nothing about the
matter. Mr. Weed charge* that the witness
had been tampered with Mr. Weed then
states that in 14.!1 a libel suit was commenced
against him by Gen. Gould, of Rochester. The
libel charged Gen. Gould with giving monev
received from the Ropil Arch Grand Cli ipter
to enable Barrage Smith and John Whitney to
escape from justice. Tlie testimony was not
legally sufficient to sustain Ihe truth of tlie
libel, and under Ihe judge's instructions the
jury found a verdict of S4OO again?! Mr Weed
The same evening Col. Simeon B. Jewitt,
Major Samuel B irton and John Whitney passed
the evening at Mr. Weed's house. Jen in was
prepared, according to Mr. Weed's statement,
to testify that he furnished a carriage for th use
who were conveying M irg.iu secretely from
Canandaigua to Niagara. Jdm Whitnev was
one of thepirly Mij >r Barton woildhive
testified that he furnished 'he cirriage which
conveyed Ihe party from beads own to Fort
Niagara, John Whitney being or of that p arlv.
Whitnev would have ?w ru tint Gould sup
plied money to enable lain to ‘ e-c pe from
just ce." Mr. Weed then proceeds with a de
tail ot the adegnd confession of Whitnev “of
Ihe hi tory of Morgan's abduction and ftps.”
According to this, the idea of suppreg-ing Mor
gan’s “intended exposure of the secrets of
Masonary” was suggested by a man by the
name of Johns, and was discussed in several
M isonic lodges. Johns, according to Whitney’s,
statement to Mr. Weed, “suggested that Mor
gan should he separated from Miller mi l {dared
- on a farm in Canada West. For this purpose
he was taken to Niagara and placed in the
magazine of the fort until arrangements for
- settling him in (’amid t were completed, hut
- the Canadian Masons disappointed them After

s posit Fort Niagara, a refusal to have anything
i to do with Morgan left his “kidnappers” great

si "they retired to refreshments.” Coder the

” the chaplain (Kev. F 11. Cummings, of Ho
