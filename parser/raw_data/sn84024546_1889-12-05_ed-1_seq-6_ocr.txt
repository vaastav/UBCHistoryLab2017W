. player, not Sunday, will be offered the man
agement of the league club here. II he noes
not accept it either Mr. Leadley or Mr.
Bum ham will probably be appointed. Pete
Conway states that he will remain with the
old club. Clarkson refuses to sign a Broth
erhood contract.
The most important business to be dis
"""cussed at the annual meeting of the local
League club next Tuesday is the selection
of a manager. On this point there may be
a great surprise in store; a surprise such as
xnay startle all the local cranks. An old
player that is a member of last season's
team mar be selected and it won't be Sun-
?ijaa.j. The player, who is one of the leading
promise to the club officials that he would
be with the team next year. He purchased
a round trip ticket to and from his home
which is Jar from this city. A prominent
official of the club strongly desires to pre him
the management and it is likely that be'Il get
it if his promise to clay here is fulfilled.
TWO PEOMIKENT J1ES.
There are two prominent managers wbose
names will also be submitted to the meeting.
One is W. W. Burnbam, the well-known and
able baseball manager of the East. Mr. Burn
bam is a candidate for the office, and has a
staunch supporter among the local club di
rectors. If the player referred to is not se
lected for the position, it is likely that Mr.
Burnham will receive the appointment Prob
ably a better man conld not be chosen. He has
bad good experience and is a shrewd business
man, and one of the extremely steady class.
Another candidate is Robert Leadly, present
manager of the Detroit club. Mr. Leadly is
well known to League baseball patrons, and a
finer gentleman is not to be found in the base
ball business. He guided bis team of last sea
son to victory in the International Leagne, and
for sometime managed the Detroit National
League Club during the season of 1SS7. He bas
displayed excellent qualities of management,
and is well thought of by two local directors.
ME. SMITH'S CHANCES.
Of course Mr. H. T. Smith will also be a can
didate, but it is thought'that bis lack of exper
ience will somewhat tell against him when it
comes down toa question of voting.
At present it is somewhat difficult to say who
will be the victorious candidate. However,
judging from present indications, tbe player
above referred to and Mr. Burnbam seem to
have the best chances. If the player resigns
with tbe club be will be offered tbe position,
and tbe stepwill be a wise one in more ways
than one. He is a favorite here and bas bad
considerable experience. His name is withheld
at present for ovions reasons. Mr. Burnbam's
great experience will aid hlni in tbe contest
should the player aecline tbe honor, because
it is claimed by club officials that Mr. Burnbam
bas bad more experience than Mr. Leadley.
However, tbe fact remains that the club bas
some excellent men to choose from and that a
gpod manager for the ciub is certain.
ABOUT THE LEAGUE FIGHT.
Speaking of the intended legal contest re
garding tbe injunctions. President Nimick: said
yesterday afternoon:
"Yes, it is quite true that we are preparing
our case. Our lawyer is Mr. Scott Ferguson,
and I can assure you that we feel confident of
victory. We not only intend to apply for in
junctions against the players, but we are also
preparing a case against those who are aiding
and abetting tbe players in violating their con
tracts with us. Tbe programme is to test the
law in every State in which the League has a
club threatened by tbe Brotherhood. This
will "be done even if the New York courts de
cide against an injunction. We de
cided to have the matter first tested
in New York because that club
being tbe best in the country is tbe most prom
inent and the settlement of tbe question at an
early date will permit the officials of that club
to commence with tbe arrangement of their
plans for next season. We don't intend to
start our legal fight until April, except soms
unforeseen circumstances cause ns to chance
our minds. Of course, if the Philadelphia
club goes into court before ns and tbe case goes
against them we'll not push ours."
It was learned from a very reliable source
yesterday afternoon that Mr. Scott Ferguson is
confident that last year's contracts are binding
for next year.
CLARKSON HESITATES.
He Refuses to Slsjn Bllke Kelly's Brother
hood Contrncr.
SAX Fbakcisco, December L Tbe first man
King" Kelly struck to sign a Brotherhood
contract after completing his long journey
from Boston yesterday was the crack pitcher
John Clarkson, but Mike was doomed to disap
pointment. Clarkson wants more money than
tbe Brotherhood offers him in the first place,
and in the second bas not much faith in tbe
financial success of the scheme. Then Kelly
-offered the much-sought twirler $500 out of his
own pocket if be would only sign with tbe
Brotherhood. Still Clarkson refused, and thus
the matter stands. However, if Clarkson don't
-wilt when 'The Only Mike" and his fellow en
thusiasts have exhausted their oratorical pow
ers, he will indeed be considered headstrong
and coldbearted in the extreme.
Late last night Billy Nash, Boston's third
baseman, affiled his signature to one of Kelly's
Brotherhood contracts. Gatnel, Hardie Rich
ardson, Radboume and Daily are in the swim,
and the first two mentioned, it is said, would
sign to-night. Fred Carroll tola Kelly that be
would take his (Carroll's) contract back with
him, and the 10.000 beauty's phiz is wreathed
in a continual series of smiles at his success.

"I have received over EO applications from

ColoBel Rodger, who has been confined to
his bed for some time, is rapidly recovering.
As soon as he is able, be will confer with tbe

CONSOLIDATION CERTAIN.
The Action Taken nt the Meeltas of the
American Association.
rSPXCIAtTILralUJtTOTHBDISPATCH.1
Columbus, December 1 Behind bolts and
bars in an inner room of the private office of
the Hon. Allen W. Thnrman. the remnants of
the American Association held an important
meeting this afternoon. The caucus lasted
until 6 o'clock. Those present were
President Zach Phelps, W. H. Whlttaker,
Ralph Lazarus, representing Chris Von der
Ahe and tbe Columbus Club, and Mr.
Thurman, counsel for the Association.
After a discussion of the situation
Mr. Whlttaker read a letter signed by
John M. Ward which he had requested to be
read at tbe meeting. In it Ward said he bad
communicated with the chapter of every
Brotherhood club, and the assent of each one
to the proposed amalgamation scheme had been
secured.
"There was some objection at Chicago," he
said, "for the reason that Baldwin, King, Boyle
and other Association stars had been signed
for that club, and there was a disposition "to
hold on to these men, bnt tbe assent of the
Chicago chapter had been finally secured."
It was the understanding, as noted in Ward s
epistle, that if the amalgamation was brought
about, these Association players should be
returned to the clubs from which they
had been taken. A motion was then
made and carried unanimously that as a
preliminary movement the meeting of the
American Association fixed for December 9
be indefinitely postponed, but that the
body convene at the call of the
President. The President and Allen
W. Thurman were then appointed
a committee to prepare a memorial to the
Brotherhood setting forth tbe conditions
upon which they would agree to
tbe proposed consolidation, on tbe basis
of the admission of tbe St Louis,
Columbus and Louisville clubs into the Brother
hood. In Philadelphia the Athletics and
the Brotherhood team will consolidate, and the
new club will be known as the Athletic.

Cincinnati Capitalists Willing; to Support, a
Brotherhood Baseball Club.
rsFzexu. nuoaix to thx dispatch-i
Cincinnati, December i. There may be
something in tbe story that Cincinnati is to
haveaBrotherboodclnb after ail. One of the
men who Is named as willing to become a mag
nate, says:
"Our plans are not sufficiently matured to be
made public at this time, bnt in tbe course of
tbe next few days we will be in a position to
come to the front and explain to the lovers of
baseball in Cincinnati just what we propose to
do. Some two weeks ago I was approached to
gether with a couple of other gentlemen by tbe
Brotherhood people who laid their plans before
us and wanted to know if we wouldbook a
club in this city. We agreed to support them
On one condition that either Ewing; or Comis
key should be placed in charge of tbe team.
Mr. Stern will have a very strong team in the
field next season, and we necessarily must have
a good drawing card in order to secure the
patronage of the public."
Ewing is exceedingly anxious that a Brother
hood club should be located in Cincinnati, and
he will do everything in his power to bring
about the desired result.
C01SWAI WILL STAY.
The Local Pitcher Saya He'll Stick to the
Old Club.
Pete Conway, accompanied by his handsome
young bride, arrived in the city yesterday,' and
located at the Hotel Anderson. The famous
pitcher never had much to say, and yesterday
was no exception. In answer to questions as to
his intentions for next year, however, he said
that he signed a two-year contract with the
League club, of this city, and he, therefore, will
remain with tbe club next season. He con
siders his contract binding.
He also said .hat his stay at Hot Bprings has
entirely strengthened his arm, and that he is
confident of doing good work next year. Presi
dent Nimick, when told of Conway's resolve,
was delighted. Tbe President said: "We will
get more than Conway, even though the
Brotherhood goes on all right. I feel confident
of two first-class men at least, notwithstanding
all these rumors about players signing Brother
hood contracts."
George Joins the Hoosier.
A gentleman from Wheeling was in the city
last evening and stated that Billy George had
signed with Indianapolis. Tbe gentleman said:
"A day or two ago George told me that he had
signed with tbe Hoosiers to play in the out
field. His arm is not in condition to pitch, but
be can bit and field all right. Of course he is
tbe same George that played with the Giants
for awhile."

Players.
The "Wheelipg Baseball Club has been sold
again, and is now owned by the firm of Laugh
lin & AIcQlnley and Mr. Kate Fiel, recently of
this city. The firm has purchased one half
interest and Mr. Fiel the other. The latter
gentleman arrived in this city yesterday, his
mission being to sign new players. During a
conversation he said :
"Our league only allows $600 per month for
salaries, and that is too little for us. There
will be a league meeting next montb, when I
think the limit will be extended. Wheeling
demands a better club than what $600 per
month will get. I am here trying to sign two
players, I cannot give their names just now,
but I think I will sign them. They have both
Stayed in the Allegheny County Iieague, "and I
ear good accounts about them. The club is
now entirely free from indebtedness, and we

Some Import&nt Trotting Cases Discussed
and 'Held Over.
New Tobk. December i. The Board of Ee
view of the National Trotting Association re
convened to-day at the Fifth Avenue Hotel,
Judge P. P. Johnston, of Lexington, Ky., in
the chair. The other members of the board
present were M. M. Morse.'Secretary; Qeorge
W. Archer, of Rochester; Governor M. Q.
Bulkeley, of Connecticut; L. G. Delano, of
Cbillicothe, 0 ana John L. Mitchell, of Mil
waukee. The first case which came up for review was
the application of Dan SeNoyelles for one-half
the winnings of the trotter Nelson in the
10,000 race trotted at Hartford last summer.
Tbe investigation of the case was concluded
and it will ne decided in executive session.
This disposed of, as well as a number of other
cases, the board entered upon tbe investigation
into tbe fraud alleged to have been committed
in the Balch stallion race for 10,000 trotted at
Boston last fall. In the Balch stallion case the
board decided to give no decision until the
next meeting held at Chicago in May, 1890, un
less a special meeting ot the board is called for
that purpose. This is considered by tbe friends
of tbe accused parlies as quite a ppint gained.
Among the more important cases next consid
ered were the expulsion of WnJ. '"Wright, of
Canada, from the association, and tbe exclu
sion of the bay gelding John L., of Boston,
from the association tracks. The application
ot George Taf ts, of Michigan, for reinstate
ment, was denied, as was the application of
Thomas Bradley, of Goshen, N. Y., and the
chestnut gelding Blizzard. The disqualifica
tion of the mare Addle Pathfinder was re
moved. Gnttenbcrs Knees.

fSrXCTAI. TELXOBAM TO TUB DISPATCH. 1
New Castle, December 4. About 220 this
morning a terrific explosion shook the busi
ness portion of New Castle, and smoke and
flames were seen coming from the St. Cloud
Hotel, one of tbe largest in the city. Natural
gas bad accumulated in tbe kitchen of the
hotel, and this, becoming ignited, caused the
explosion. The kitchen building, a two-story
brick, was leveled to the ground. The female
help occupied the rooms over the kitchen,
and when the explosion took place the floor
raised and the girls, Ave in number, were
hurled into the debris and then rolled into the
street. Strange to say with the exception of a
few bruises they were uninjured.
The kitchen building was totally wrecked
and tbe greater portion of tbe window panes In
the main building blown out. Bricks were
hnrled for 100 feet through the windows of ad
joning building. It ts supposed that the gaspipe
leaked. An alarm of fire was sounded," and
on the arrival of the department tbe fire among
the debris was soon extinguished. The loss
will reach $3,000.
AN AGED INCENSIAEI.
"While nn Inmate of tbe Little Sisters
of
the Poor She Set Houses on Fire.
Mrs. Barbara Gnenther, aged 73; was
taken to the Central station last evening by
her two sons, Daniel and George. She lived
in Hooveler's court, off Penn avenue, near
the old Niagara engine house.
Some two years ago both Mrs. Guenther
and her husband, who is some 75 years of
age, were sent to the Little'Sisters of the
Poor. It appears from the statement of
the sons that the management of the Sisters
of the Poor objected to keeping the old lady,
as she had endeavored to set the place on
fire several times.
The sisters, the sons claim, having noti
fied them to remove their mother, they did
so, and yesterday evening were as much
surprised as the general public to hear the
old lady scream and make a pnblic exhibi
tion of herself. After taking her to Central
station, where she remained in the hospital
department for some time, Bhe wss taken
home by her two boys, who agreed to make
the course for her as pleasant as possible.
This was done as far as the brothers could
do, and the police station not being regarded
as a pleasant place to retain a lady, the
brothers concluded to keep moving. The
old lady was taken home by her 'sons, who
said she had already threatened to burn
dc.wn their own houses, and had in fact
kindled the fires to do so.
She is a very inoffensive-looking old
lady, a little flighty in her manners, but
does not seem to be at all violent.

clared to be elected Lieutenant Governor of
Ohio by a majority of 22. Marquis, his
Democratic opponent, alleges that illegal
ballots were cast in nearly every section of

charged with receiving 137 purchased votes.

Columbus, December 4. The papers in
the contest for the election of a Lieutenant
Governor haye been prepared by the attor
neys of Marquis, the Democratic candidate,
and will be served to-morrow on Lampson,.
the Bepnblican, who has been declared
elected. The document is a formal notice
of contest, claiming that Lampson, to whom
it is addressed, was not elected and that
Marquis was.
While the contestant asserts that the re
turns when opened and canvassed by
the General Assembly will show that
Lampson has received 375,090 votes against
375,068 votes for Marquis, giving the former
a plurality of 22, he will base his contest
on the grounds that a true count of the legal
votes polled will give him a majority for
the office; that enough legal votes were cast
for the contestant and unlawfully excluded
from tbe count and returns to elect him
that.more than enough votes were counted
illegally for Lampson to give him a big
pretended majority.
THE FIGUEES FOB IT.
Specifications are given as follows: In
every voting precinct of Adams county 137
votes were cast for Lampson which were
marked with symbols, indicating that they

his official duties and responsibilities. He was

in New Jersey, and at Poughkeepsie on the
Hudson river, where, in the quiet and intimacy
of their socioty, and the change ot scene and
air, he continued rapidly to improve, so that
now he feels his health to be fully restored. He
will, however, as a matter of precaution, only
spend a few hours each day at his office,until he
has become accustomed again to the exactions
of business. Sincere congratulations will be
extended to him by his many friends, upon his
recovery from what at first seemed a hopeless
illness.

was nut in his father's

ularly the glazing,

events in St. Louis for six months,
he wrote his brother, William
F., in Germany: "Leave everything behind
and come; there is an opening for us in St.
Louis." After the brothers had worked to
gether two years at the bench, they saved
enough money to start, a business of their
own. It was a success from- the beginning.
Being general mechanics, they turned their
attention principally to manufacturing, and
in 1862 began the stamping of tinware and
the manufacture of anything offered, all of
which under their close attention built
up and prospered so that in 1868 they were
enabled to begin manufacturing on a large
scale. They then incorporated their busi
ness under the name of the St. Louis Stamp
ing Company, but kept the stock in their
own bands, except a portion, divided among
their sons. In 1874, in connection with his
brother, Wm. F., he invented "granite
ironware." In 1881 they built large rolling
millsjsothatat'crfisent between the factoriei
and rolling mills they employ about 1,200
people. He has a family of ten children
three sons and seven daughters the eldest
being 28 and the youngest about 7 years old.
TAEIFI FOR BEVENUE
Denounced as a Fraad by the President of
tho Wool Growers' Association
Complete Free Trade a More
Loslcal Measure.
Washington, December 4j The feature
of the Wool Growers' convention to-day was
the annual address of Hon. Columbia
Delano, of Ohio, President of the National
Wool Growers' Association. He began by
saying that both food and clothing should
be produced at home, not purchased from
abroad, when the people who consume them
have facilities for their production. Neces
sity alone can justify their importation.
Continuing, he said: ,
Suppose the nation involved in a war, foreign
or domestic, of serious dimensions, like that
for example of the last rebellion; suppose our
commerce embarrassed as it was at that time;
suppose our demand for wool was no greater
than at that time; and suppose that "free
trade" had destroyed tbe sheep industry, and
tnmed over to foreign nations the production
of our wool; and we may be able to appreciate
tbe folly. If not the crime, of attempting to put
wool on the free list.
Tbe speaker then read statistics from well
known authorities tending to show the
necessity of protection in order to preserve
the wool industry, and then said:
No further argument is needed to prove that
free wool is death to this Industry, and none
who prefer the Interests of this nation to those
of foreign nations will fall to regret so serious
a blow to our wool growers, and to the nation
at large, as free wool will inflict, and none but
those under Influence of nerional Interest or
traditional prejudices will fail to admit that
the attempt to put wool on the free list is an
economic blunder. To those who favor free
trade as our true policy, I address no protest
against free wool. From their standpoint they
are right. If it be free trade, let us have it as a
system, pure and simple, without tbe adul
teration' of duplicity under tbe name of
"incidental protection." Let us do one or the
other, and have an economic policy that is en
titled to an honest and correct name. 'Tariff
for revenue" with incidental protection is a
delusion and a fraud. We need a national
policy on this subject, honestly named. If pro
tection, let It be general and uniform, embrac
ing all American industries that can be profit
ably pursued by our people.
"At the conclusion of the address the
meeting adjourned and the delegates in a
body called on the President and Secretary
Busk, Their brief interview with, the Pres
ident as-well as the Secretary of Agricul
ture, is said to have been of a very satisfac
tory character.
THE MERCANTILE TAX.
Treasurer Dennlston's Annual Statement to
HnrrUbarg Makes a Good Showing
Less Than Usual Uncollectnble.
City Treasurer Denniston yesterday
forwarded to Harrisburg the annual state
ment of the State mercantile license tax of
the city for last year. Under the law the
mercantile tax must be paid on or before
July 10, when all unpaid claims are turned
over to the variouo Aldermen of the various
wards for collection by process of law.
If tiny retail dealer will go before an Al
derman and make affidavit that his business
does not reach $1,000 a year he will be ex
empted from the State license. The dealers
are classified according to the amount of
business they do, there being 17 classes, the
three highest being A, B and C; then fol
lows Class No. 1 and np to 14 inclusive. A
dealer who does from $1,000 to $5,000, of
business a year is pnt jn Class 14 and is
assessed $8 per year for the benefit of the
State. If bis business runs up anywhere
from $5,000 to $10,000 he goes into class 13;
if front $10,000 to $15,000, plass 12, and so on
up to class A, the proportion of assessment
being increased accordingly, until in some
cases the mercantile tax itself is quite a
figure with some firms, Joseph Home & Co.
being a notable example, their mercantile
tax alone being $600 on their wholesale busi
ness and $450 on retail. This inaddition to
the regular business tax of the city.
Tbe statement made by the City Treasurer
yesterday shows that out of the total mer
cantile tax levied on the city, which was
$43,603, there was collected $41,070 86,
which includes all that could be collected
by the city Alderman. The balance, $2,
532 14, was returned by the Alderman as un
collectable. This is considered as aremark
able showing, as generally the proportion
returned as uncollectable is mnch larger.

M'&AW'IAKESAPLEA-
Exposing Some Secrets of the K. of
L. General Assembly.
BE SAYS EXPULSION WAS UNFAIR,
And That Powderlj and Others Proved
Only What He Admitted.
IMPORTATIONS OF CONrBACT LABOR
.Were Clearly Enough Triced ts the WctUngmea's
Olnclals.
Mr. McGaw, of this city, who was ex
pelled from be Knights of Labor at their
General Assembly in Atlanta, is out with a
detailed explanation. He cites the revenge
that had to be wreaked on him for assisting
to prosecute importers of contract labor, and
makes quite a defense.
Homer L. IXcGaw is outT in a lengthy
counter-blast. He reviews the charges
brought against him at Atlanta and attacks
a member of the K. of L. who was most
forward in bringing about his expulsion.
He refers to official evidence which puts a
different complexion on the published re
ports of the proceedings of the K. of L. at
Atlanta. Space will not admit of a
verbatim report, but, ihe chief points
touched upon are as follows:
After alluding to the resolution passed In
the Window Glass Workers' convention (L.
A. 300) in July, asking the General Assem
bly of the K. of L. to expel Joseph L. Evans
and himself from that order for "antago
nizing tbe affairs of L. A. 300," Mr. JlcGaw
states that neither he nor Mr. Evans re
ceived any notice of such resolution until
four months later, viz., on the 7th of No
vember, or four days previous to the meet
ing of the General Assembly at Atlanta.
Arrived in Atlanta, he demanded a copy of
the charges. None were given to him. No
charges were formulated. Campbell,
taking the floor, charged him with
being the prosecutor in the Jean
ne tto case, and with having been
active in securing evidence against him and
others of L. A. 300. McGaw admitted the
charges as true, and produced documentary
evidence connecting members of X. A. 300
with the case. He charges that it was not
until he had proved that the English glass
blowers had come to this country by invita
tion of L. A. 300 that the charges of slander
were made. Among all, including Pow
derly, who accused him of slander,
none could adduce proof. Charles
Litchman, former Secretary of the
Insurance Department, charged him
with saying that he (Litchman) had
been crooked in his accounts. He could
not prove that McGaw had made those ac
cusations. McGaw then accused Litchman
with leaving Cincinnati with $537 15 of the
rrder's money, and which he did not turn
over for a year. Litchman could not deny
this. Mr. McGaw then refers to the official
proceedings of the General Assembly for
1883-4-5 in support of his charges
against Litchman. He quotes from
the records and correspondence, and
shows that Litchman's shortcomings existed,
and were known to Powderly, who
was worried over them. Mr. McGiw says
that it was' only after having threatened
Litchman witn criminal proceedings for
tbe recovery of the money due to the order
that he sent him a remittance covering tbe
amount he had received as. secretary since
going out of office, but nothing toward
settling the balance of the funds he held
while in office. Mr. McGaw then refers to
his reeord for tbe three years be acted as In
surance Secretary. In 1884 the record has
it that he had managed "with signal ability,
success and honesty," and was re-elected by
acclamation. In 1885 his accounts secured
"a cordial and hearty indorsement," and in
1886 the Committee on Insurance reported
that his accounts had been "faithfully and
correctly kept."
A REGULAR L0YE FEAST.
The Sleeting, In the Interest of the New
Labor Combination.
St. Louis, December 4. The majority of
the delegates to the Farmers and Laborers'
Convention were present at the mass meet
ing held in Central Turner Hall to-night.
The affair proved a regular love
feast. O. B. Lake introduced Lee Mer
riwether, State Labor Commissioner, who
confined his remarks to State labor matters.
Mr. Balph Beaumont then spoke for two
hours on the principles of the Blnights
of Labor, dwelling at length upon the pub
lic'land question, as related to labor, trades
unions and the tariff.
When T. V. Powderly, Master Workman
of the Knights of Labor, entered the hall be
was cheered for several minutes. He
favored confederation, but not organic
union. Mr. Streeter, of Illinois, and
others, also addressed the meeting.

Sirs. Hob-Nail Belli' Exciting- Experience
With Her Husband.
Mrs. Mary Eellly last evening went to
the Fourteenth ward station and lodged a
rather curious complaint. Mrs. Beillv is
the wife of "Hob-Nail" Eeilly, formerly of
Old avenue, but now located at what is
known as the "Soho Vaults." This estab
lishment Is on Second avenue, near Canton
street, and has a number of vaults cut in
the solid rock underneath lhe B. & O. rail
road. The honse, it was alleged, was run
by Eeilly as a "speak-easy." It was raided
by the police in October.
"Mrs. Eeilly last night said that yesterday
afternoon her husband took a tin tray and
taking her back in the vaults made her
hold the tray on her head "bile he fired at
the tray with a revolver. He fired si shots
before she succeeded in getting away. In
support of her story she exhibited the per
forated tray.
Officers Maegle and O'Brien went to the
bouse after bim. Mrs. Eeilly persisted that
he was there and they entered the vaults to
hunt for him. Their search was fruitless,
however, and they left without him. They
stated that the construction of the vaults
was so complicated and there were so many
side rooms and chambers that if he had been
there be was perfectly safe from them. In
the main vault, however, they discovered a
comfortably fitted up barroom with a quan
tity of beer, and Eeilly will be arrested at
the first opportunity.
