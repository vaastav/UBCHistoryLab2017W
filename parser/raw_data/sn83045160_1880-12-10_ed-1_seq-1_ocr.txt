Washihoton, T'ecember 9. On motion of

was referred to th'! select committee to ex
amine the several branches of civil-service
with instructions to report at an early day

S nator Pendleton introduced a joint reso
lution for the purpose of obtaining the priv
iligeof opening s road and highway from
the Canada line .1 the I "nitcd States and
Uritii-li America through British Columbia
to Fort Wrangle and Sitka, in Alaska. Re

a communication from the secretary of war,
t-ansmitting copisa oi the correspondence
had with the legal rciireseiilatives of the
( 'on re leratc Generals BraggTind Polk, with a
view to the purchase of their private papers,
relating to the late war, as per act of June
16, 1830. The Pdk papers have been placed
in the hands of the government, with permis
sion to use such is are deemed important to
the publication now authorized bv law. The
price asked for the entire collection is $10,
000. The Bragg papers have been submitted
for the purpose of lieing catalogued. ?o
present price is stipulated for, but they, as
well as the Polk collection", were appraised in
1878 at $10,000, Itnd could, doubtless, now be
purchased at that sum. The m crctary says
that heretofore no purchases for archivis
have been made from Federal officers, and
only the trans-Mississippi, Sidney Johnston
and Sneed papers from Confederate officers.
The great bulk of the acquisitions haVi? been
g f a. So far a' the secretary knows, the
o ily important collections as yet unobtaiiud
a-e those under consideration. It is for con
gress to say whether ju-tice to those who

The senate bill for the relief of Mary A.

On motion of Senator Paddock, the senate

On motion of Seuator Garland, the senate

On motion of Senator Plumb the senate
not conceive of anything more detestable
than rejecting the vote of a State, except vot
ing a State against its will; that
was the crime of the Republican
party. It had accepted perjury and
forgery as a means of certifying votes. In
the face of this fact gentlemen of the other
side stood here and endeavored to give the
Vice-President power to count the votes. It
was an attempt at usurpation that looked to
the future, and there was no legislative ac
tion that was not justifiable to defeat that
purpose.
A disjointed, running debate then ensued,
participated in by Messrs. McLane, Calkins,
Hunter, Cox N. Y. and Mills, during
the course of which Mr. Mills intimated his
opposition to the (tending resolutions on the
ground that under its provisions the senate
might declare who was President.
Mr. Lapham said that at the last session
he had looked upon the pending measure as
an attempt to debauch the electoral count.
Why were the wheels of legislation now
blocked to consider a question, when it was
admitted that there was no necessity what
ever for the operation f the extraordinary
provisions of this resolution? That there
was lying behind it some purpose he was
bound to assume from the tenacity with
which this matter was pressed. Under its
provisions, questioning a return would jus
tify a majority in rejecting the vote of a
State. It provided that if more than one list
of electoral votes, or "papers purporting to
be such list," were received from a State,
ei'.her house msy receive the vote. What
was this paper? An official paper? Not at
all; but a paper certified by the chairman of
a Democratic State committee would answer
the requirements of that provision. The Re
publicans were willing to justify themselves
in resorting to every expedient known to par
liamentary usage to resist the purpose of
this resolution.
Mr. Herbert argued in opposition to the
theory that the Vice-President had the right
to count the vote. He denied that there was
any political motive which induced the Dem
ocrats to press the matter, unless a de
sire to prevent the theory that the Vice
President had the power to declare who was
his successor from passing into a precedent
was a political motive.
Mr. Newberry made an elaborate argument
in support of the proposition that the power
to count the votes was vested in the Vice
President. The proposed rule was unconsti
tutional, in that it attempted to take from
the president of the senate certain powers
and rights and vest them in the two houses.
Pending further debate the house ad
j urued.

Representative Kelley, Pa., has pre

now pending before congress. It provides
that the secretary of the treasury .-hall be
authorized to issue notes to the amount of
$400,000,000, denominations not to be less
than ten dollars, bearing interest at the rate
of not exceeding three per cent, per annum,
redeemable at the pleasure of the United
States after one year, and payable in ten
years from date of issue; but not more of said
notes shall lie redeemed in any one fiscal
year than the amount of the sinking fund for
that year, and the particular notes to be re
deemed from time to time shall be deter
mined by lot under such rules as the secre
tary of the treasury shall prescribe. This
will lie offered by Representative Kelley as "a
substitute whenever the Wood refunding bill
is called up.

Mr. MeUiiie then took the floor, and pro

down the proposition that no judicial power
could be cxcrcisce! by congress except by ex
press gran'. The 1'ib, article of the con
stitution wis th- express grant to congress to
count the cte through all times. The idea
that the Vice-President could count the
votes; that he who might have a place on the
ticket should decide what votes
should be received and what rejected,
had never been accepted in the history
of the country. Over and over again had
this subject been debate'd. Unhappilv, once

ture need be anticipated from the adoption
of the proposed rule, the majority held
that a great principle was at stake which
might at some time effect the stability of our
institutions, and that the policy of
j the party should be to meet the bsue
now, and to resist, by every known
parliamentary method, the adoption
of a proposition alike unwarranted by the
constitution and at variance with the prece
dents of the past. At the conclusion of the
debate a vote was taken upon Judge Lap
ham's resolution, eleclaring it to lie ''the
sense of the caucus (ha( the Republican
minority should resist the adoption of this
joint rule by all the means authorized by par
liamentary law," and without dissent it was
adopted.

that the government fully shaivd their sor

has afforded means for concluding peace. By
the rejection of that bill the material at their

IRELAND.
Dt'BLiN, December 9. -The Land ! auue
is Oondacting the campagn in Aa north with
considerable skill, modifying its programme
and proceedings to avoid offending the preju
dices of the people of Ulster. In that pro
vince there is quite a different tone in their
speeches from that prevailing in. other parte
of the country, with a view of c-oncltlattng
the Presbyterians, liberals and Orangemen.
The system of Boycotting ha been applied to
six detachments ot the constabulary in differ
ent parts ot Ireland.
In Kilrush they are painting the letters
"L. L." over the roots of shops where I.and.
Leagncrs may purchase goods.
The man who shot und killed a bailiff at
tempting to execute a decree against him,
near Cookstown, County Tyrone, has been
arrested. I lis name is Graham.
It is said the law ofliecrs are considering
PaxnelPa recent speech at Waterford, and it
is not improbable thar he may be indicted
on a elistinct and separate charge in connec
tion with that speech.
The Monaghan correspondent of the Dublin
Express, telegraphed as follows last night:
"Tlie greatest excitement prevailed at Mona
ghan. Lord Rossmore was accompanied by
I.ord Man lerillc, whojwill aasitt at theanli
league meeting. Man dtville telegraphed to
his agcnl at Port Adown, to send 10,000 men
to Scottstown without elelay. Another tele
gram was dispatched to the district grand
master of Orangemen, of Armagh, to send
1000 men. A similar telegram was sent Lord
Creighton to send 1000 men from Fermaugh.
these are certain to arrive, and the number
will be more than doubled by men from Mon
aghan and the surrounding neighborhood.
The men will lie supplied with some means
of defense. The most active efforts are be
ing made- by the constitutional party and
leaguers to n:ake each meeting a success.
The assemblages will be most formidable, and
perhaps the most dangerous to peace that
have bee n witnessed in Ulster for some years,
and if the l ister landlords follow the ex
ample set them by Lords Rossmore, Mande
ville and Creighton, the leaguers foelld have
little to pay in Ulster."
At the Cork assises to-dav the grand jurv
found true bills against llealy and Walsh
for intimidating Farmer Manning. The
coroner's jury also returned a verdict of
willful murder against Graham, who -Jut a
bailiff near Cookstown.
The land netting which O'Kelly, Dillon
and li;uar railed upon the government to
protect from threatened attack, was held to
day at Scottstown. The Orangemen gave
up their intention of holding a counter dem
onstration at the ame place to-day, on tl.e
ground that they had not sufficient time to
make preparations.
The latest development in the agitation is
the establishment of self -constituted league
courts which take upon themselves to decide
questions of equity, impose fines
and convey censures. James McCoan,
mctnber of parliament tor the
county of Wie-klow, has written to Chief
Justice May inquiring if the report in the
newspapers of his iudv,u.eni in the Evening
Mail case -,a correct. Judge May replieel
that he did not discuss such matters with
private individuals. The Land I?aie is
preparing a national protest, to lie delivered
at a masj-uiee-kiug at Dublin, against the lan
guage used bv ihe chiet-jusiioe on the bench.
lx)rd Rossmore ubundoned holding a e-oun-ter
meeting at Scottstown yesterday on the
advice of the police.
The crown sol ici lor has served a formal
notice of trial on the solicitor of traversers.
A jury will be struck Monday.
own price. It would be ensy to show that
this could not be for the benefit of Ireland. It
would multiply the evils of absenteeism five
fold and would result in not only one-fifth,
I but all the rent of Ireland being sent out of
1 Ireland in the simp of interest of the pur-
chase money. The system of exteneled
. ownership could not last if it had
its origin iu confiscation snd robbery.
Whatever is done must be with every regard
to the rights or compensalivii of the land
lord, lie said he had no sympathy with
plans of intimidation and the violent meth
ods of the Laud League. They hail set up a
government in opposition to that of the
queen, and this was a state of things which
could not be allowed to oowtinuf.
The government has ordered accommoda
tion for 150 soldiers to be prepares! at Bal
lina, Ireland, where a lady landowner was
recently mobbed aud assaulted on the street.
A Dubmi correspondent, commenting on
Forster's memorandum, say - : "The truth is
the magistrates, agents auel landlords gene
rally are panic-stricken, and do not venture
to enforce the law. A prosecution brought
by the attorney-general at Ballinsloe, and
another in Sligo, have been broken down,
which has had a discouraging effect. There
is also a difficulty about tn-ating the Land
League meetings as unlawful assemblies.
Magistrates do not feel justified in regarding
the threat to Boycott a: coming within the
act, as it does not imply violence."
'ihe Pall Midi Gaxtie says: "Every buly
will ask why Forster's memorandum remind
ing the magistrates of the powers thev p- s
sess under the existing law was not issued
months ago. The memorandum may now be
too late. Forster may come over to the cab
inet with a request for a coercion bill so ur
gent that his colleagues may find it impossi
ble to resist. If this be so, parliament will
have to know, in view of his dilatoriness in
reminding the magistrates of their powers,
whether he has really used up to the present
time, and pressed his suborelinates to use, all
they instruments they already possessed."
It is officially announced that the illness

pointiv-g out that under certain acts of par
liament, persons assembling armed or dis
guised, or assuming ihe name of any society
to the terror of her majesty's subjects, are
guilty of a high misdemeanor render
ing them liable to imprisonment; as
are also those who by threats endeavor to
compel any person to quit employment or
publish or write anything calculated to in
cite 1-iot or unlawful assembly. AU magis
trates or constables are boun.il s apprehend,
oppose and disperse jh-iis engaged in these
practices, a- viiey oan command all persons
to as.hu them. Any two magistrates can bind
over persons whom they have reason to sus
pect of even intending to participate iu un
lawful proceedings or assembly, or in case of
refusal to be booai r.i-er laey can commit
them to jail, they van bind over any per
sons whoii Ihej believe sanjjive evidence re

fuse to be bound over or give evidence, thev
can commit them to jail.
