TALMAGE'S SERMON.
Pertinent Inquiry: "13
Heart Right?"
Triina
A 8acrarantal Discourse, Showing: the
.Necessity of Keeping the Heart ltight
By the Cultivation of a For
giving Spirit.
Upon a recent sacramental occasion at
Brooklyn Tabernacle, Rev. T. DeWitt
Talmage took for his subject the "Saluta
tion from the Chariot," his text being:
Is thine heart right? II Kings, x., 15.
With mettled horses at full speed, for he
was celebrated for fast driving, Jehu, the
warrior and king, returns from battle.
But seeing Jehonidab, an acquaintance,
ty the wayside, he shouts, "Whoa! whoa!"
to the lathered span. Then leaning over
to Jehonidab, Jehu salutes him in the
words of the text words not more ap
propriate for that hour and place than for
this hour and place:
Is thine heart right?
I should like to hear of your physical
health. Well myself. I like to have every
body else well, and so might ask, "Is
your eyesight right, your hearing right,
your nerves right, your lungs right, your
entire body right? But I am busy to-day
taking diagnosis of the more important
spiritual conditions.
I should like to bear of your financial
welfare. I want every body to have
plenty of money, suv'pte apparel, largo
storehouse and cdmfortable residence;
and I might ask : ''Is your business right,
your income right.yoiir worldly surround
ings right?" But vhat are these financial
questions compared with the inquiry as to
whether yo have been able to pay your
debts to God as to whether you are in
sured for ssternity; as to whether you are
ruining yourself by the long-credit system
of the soul? I have known men to have
no more than one loaf of bread at a time,
and yet to own a government bond of
Heaven worth more than the whole
material universe.
The question I ask you to-day is not In
Tegard to your habits. I make no inquiry
about your integrity, or your chastity, or
your sobriety. I do not mean to stand on
the outside of the gate and ring tho bell,
hut coming up the steps I open the door
and come to the private apartment of the
soul; and with the earnestness of a
man that must give an account for this
day's work 1 cry out: "Oh, man, oh, worn-'
an immortal, is thine heart right?"
I will not insult you by an argument to
prove that we are by nature all wrong. If
there be a factory explosion, and the
smoke-stack bo upset, and the wheels be
broken in two, and the engine unjoiuted,
and the ponderous bars be twisted, and a
man should look in and say that nothing
was the matter, yon would pronounce him
a fool. Well, it needs no acumen to dis
cover that our nature is all atwist, and
askew, and unjoiuted. The thing doesn't
work right. The biggest trouble we have
in the world is with our souls.
Men sometimes say that though their
lives may not be just right, their heart is
all right. Impossible! A farmer never
puts the poorest apples on top of his bar
rel; nor does the merchant place the
meanest goods in his show window. The
best part of us is our outward life. I do
not stop to discuss whether we all fell in
Adam, for we have been our own Adam,
aud have all eaten of the forbidden fruit,
and have been turned out of the paradise
of holiness and peace; and though the
flaming sword that stood at the gate to
keep us out has changed position and
comes behind to drive ns in, we will not
The Bible account of ns is not exagger
ated when it says that we are poor,
and wretched, and. miserable, and blind,
and naked. Poor: the wretch that stands
shivering on our door-step on a cold day
is not so much in need of bread as we are
of spiritual help. Blind: why, the man
whose eyes perished in the powder blast,
and who for these ten years has gone feel
ing his way from street to street, is not in
such utter darkness as we. Naked: why
there is no one rag of holiness left to hide
the shame of our sin. Sick: why, the lep
rosy has eaten into the head, and the
heart, and the hands, and the feet; and
the marasmus of an everlasting wast
ing away has already seized on some
of us.
But the meanest thing for a man to do
is to discourse about an evil without point
ing a way to have it remedied. I speak
of the thirst of your hot tongue only that
I may show you the living stream that
drops crystalline and sparkling from the
Rock of Ages, and pours a river of glad
ness at your feet. If I show- you the
rents in your coat, it is only because
the door of God's wardrobe now
swings open, ana nere is a roDe, wnite
with the fleece of the Lamb of God, and
f a cut and make that an angel would
not be ashamed to wear. If I snatch from
you the black, mouldy bread that you are
munching, it is only to give you the bread
made out of the finest wheat that grows
on the celestial hills, and baked in the
fires of the cross, and one crumb of which
would be enough to make all Heaven a
banquet. Hear it, one and all, and tell it
to your friends when you go home, that
the Lord Jesus Christ can make the heart
right
First we need a repenting heart- If for
the last ten, twenty or forty years of life
we have been going on in the Wrong way,
it is time that we turned around and
started in the opposite direction. If we
offend our friends we are glad to apolo-p-ize.
God is our best friond, and yet how
many of us have never apologized for the
wrongs we have done Him!
There is nothing that we so much need
to get rid of as sin. It is a horrible black
monster. It polluted Eden. It killed
Christ. It has blasted the world. Men
keep dogs in kennels, and rabbits in a
warren, and cattle in a pen. What a man
that would be who would shut them
up in his parlor. But this foul dog
cf sin, and these herds of transgres
sion, we have entertained.for many a long
year in our heart, which should be the
cleanest, brightest room in all our nature.
Out with the vile herd! Begone, ye be
foulers of an immortal nature! Turn out
the beasts and let Christ come in ! -
A heathen came to an early Christian
who had the reputation of curing diseases.
The Christian said: ''You must have all
your idols destroyed." The heathen gave
to the Christian the key to his house, that
he might go in and destroy the idols. He
battered to pieces all he saw, but still the
man diil not get well. The'Christian said
to him: "There must be some idol in
your house not yet destroyed." The
heathen confessed that there was one
idol of beaten gold that he could not bear
to give up. After awhile, when that
was destroyed, in answer to the prayer
of the Christian, the sick man got well.
Many a man has awakened in his
dying hour to find his sins all about him .
They clamber up on the right side of the
bed, and on the left side, and over the
headboard, and over the footboard, and
horribly devoured his soul.
Repent: the voice celestial cries.
Nor longer dare delay;
The wretch that scorns the mandate dies.
And meets a Aery day.
Again, we need a believing heart. A
good many years ago a weary one went
up to one of the hills of Asia Minor, and
with two logs on his back cried out to all
the we'd, offering to carry their sins and
sorrow.. They pursued him. They
slapped him in the face. They mocked
him. When he groaned they groaned.
They shook their fist at him. They spat
cu titn. They bounded him as though h
were a wild t-east. lilt healing cf ths
nick, ,tii light-giTlog to the Ului, til
mercy to the outcast silenced not the re-
venge of the world. His prayers and
benedictions were lost in that whirlwind j
of execration, "Away with him! away
with him!"
Ah! it was not merely the two pieces of
wood that he carried: it was the trans
gressions of the race, the anguish of the
ages, the wrath of God, the sorrows of
hell, the stupendous interests of an
unending eternity. No wonder
his back bent. No wonder the
blood started from every pore. No won
der that he crouched under a torture that
made the sun faint, and the everlasting
hills tremble, and the dead rush up in
their winding-sheets as he cried:
If it be possible, let this cup pass from me.
But the cup did not pass. None to com
fort.
There he hangs ! What has that hand
done that it should be thu3 crushed in the
palm? It has been healing the lame and
wiping away tears. W'hat has that foot
been doing that it should be so lacerated?
It has been going about doing good. Of
what has the victim been guilty? Guilty
of saving a world. Tell me, ye heavens
and earth, was there ever such another
criminal? Was there ever such a crime?
On that hill of carnage, that sunless day,
amid those howling rioters, may not your
sins and mine have perished? I believe
it.
Oh, the ransom has been paid. Those
arms of Jesii3 wore stretched out so wide
that when he brought them together again
they might embrace the world. Oh, that
I might, out of tho blossoms of the spring
or the flaming foliage of the autumn,
moke one wreath for my Lord ! Oh that
all the triumphal arches of the world
could be swung in one gateway, where
the King of Glory might come in! Oh
that all the harps and trumpets and or
gans of earthly music might, in one
anthem, speak His praise!
But what were earthly flowers to Him
who wa'.keth amid the snow of the white
lilies of Heaven! What were arche3 of
earthly masonry to Him who hath about
His throne a rainbow spun out of ever
lasting sunshine ! What were all earthly
music to Him when the 144,000
on one side, and the cherubim
and seraphim aud archangels stand
on the other side, and all the space
between is filled with the doxologies of
eternal jubilee ! the hosatiah of a redeemed
earth, the hallelujah of unfallen angels,
song after song rising about the throne of
God and of the Lamb. In that pure, high
place, let Him hear us. Stop! harps of
Heaven, that our poor cry may be heard.
Oh,my Lord Jesus, it will not hurt Thee
for one hour to step out from the shining
tarone. They will make it all up when
Thou goest back again. Come hither, O
blessed one, that we may kiss Thy feet.
Our hearts, too long withheld, we now sur
render to Thy keeping. When Thou goest
back, tell it to all the immortals that the
lost are found, and let Thy father's house
ring with the music and the dance.
They have some old wine in Heaven,
not used except iu rare festivities. In this
world those who are accustomed to use
wine on great occasions briug out the w ine
and say: "This wine is thirty years old,"
or "forty years old." But the wine of
Heaven is more than eighteen centuries
old. It was prepared at the time when
Christ trod the wine-pres alone. When
such grievous sinners as we come back,
methinks the chamberlain of Heaven
cries out to the servants: "This is un
usual joy ! Bring up from the vaults of
Heaven that old wine. Fill all the
tankards. Let all the white-robed guests
drink to the immortal health of the Lord
Almighty." There is joy in Heaven
among the angels of God over one sinner
that reponteth; and God grant that one
may bo you.
Again, in order to have a right heart it
must be a forgiving heart. An old writer
says: "To render good for evil is God
like; good for good is man -like; evil for
good devil-like." Which of these natures
have we? Christ will have nothing to do
with us ns long as wa keep auy old
grudge. AVe have all been cheated and
lied about. There are people ' who
dislike us so much that if we
should come down to poverty and dis
grace, they would say, "Good for him!
Didn't I tell you so?" They never have un
derstood us, and never will. They do not
understand us. UnsancUfied' human
nature says "Wait till you get a good
crack at him, and when at last you find
him in a tight place, give it to him. Flay
him alive. No quarter. Leave not a rag
of reputation. Jump on him with both
feet. Pay him in his own coin sarcasm
for sarcasm, scorn for scorn, abuse for
abuse."
But, my friends, that is not the right
kind of heart. Nj man ever did so mean
a thing toward us as wo have done toward
God. And if we can not forgive others,
how can we expect God to forgive us?
Thousands of men have been kept out of
Heaven by an unforgiving heart.
Here is some one who says: "I will for
give that man the wrong he did me about
that houso and lot; I will forgive

An old Christian black woman was
going along the streets of New York with
a basket of apples that she had for sale.
A rough sailor ran against her and upset
the basket, and sto id back, expecting to
hear her scold frightfully; butshe stooped
down and picked up the apples, and said:
"God forgive you, my son, as I do." The
sailoi saw the meanness of what he had
done, and felt in his pocket for his money,
and insisted that she should take it all.
Though she was black. he called
her mother and said: "Forgive me, moth
er; I will never do any thing so mean
again." Ah! there is a power in a for
giving spirit to overcome all hardness.
There is no way of conquering men like
that of bestowiuar upon them your pardon,
whether they will accept it or not.
Again, a right heart is an expectant
heart. It is a poor business to be building
castles in the air. Enjoy what you have
now. Don't spoil your comfort in the
small house because you expect a larger
one. Don't fret about your income when
it is theea or four dollars per day, because
vou expect to have after awhile ten dol
lars per day; or ten thousand dollars
a year because vou expect it
to be twenty thousand dollars a year.
But about heavenly things, the more
we think the better. Those castles
are not in the air, but on the hills, and we
have a deed (f them iu our posses
sion. I like to f-ee a man all full of
Heaven. He talks Heaven. He sings
Heaven. He prays Heaven. He dreams
Heaven. Some of us in our si eep have had
the good place open to us. We saw the
pinnacles iu the sky. We heard the click
of the hoofs of tue white horses on which
victors rode, and the clapping of the
cymbals of eterual triumph. And while
in our sleep we were glad that all our

In the midst of the City of Paris stands,
or did stand, a statue of the good, but
broken-hearted Josephine. I never
imagined that - marble could be
smitten into such tenderness. It
seems not lifeless. If tho spirit of
Josephine be disentabernacled, the soul of
the Empress has taken possession of this
figure. l am not yet satisfied that it is
stone. The puff of the dress on the arm
seems to need but the pressure of the
finger to indent it. The figure at the bot
tom of the robe, the ruffle at the neck, the
fur lining on the dress, the embroidery of
the satin, the cluster of lily and leaf and
rose in her hand, the pose of her body as
she seems to come sailing out of the sky,
her face calm, humble, beautiful, but yet
sad, attest the genius of the sculptor and
the beauty of the heroine he celebrates.
Looking up through the ' rifts of the
coronet that encircles her ,brow, I could
see the sky beyond, the great heavens
where all woman's wrongs shall be right
ed, and the story of endurance and
resignation shall be told to all the ages.
The rose and the lily in the hand of
Josephine will never drop their
petals. The children of God, whether
they sufTer on earth, in palace.s
or in hovels, shall come to that glorious
rest, oh Heaven, sweet Heaven! at thy
gate we set down all our burdens and
griefs. The place will be full. Here there
are vacant chairs at the hearth, and at
the table, but there are no vacant chairs
in Heaven. The crowns all worn; the
thrones all mounted.
Some talk of Heaven as though it were
a very handsome church, where a few
favored spirits would come in and sit
down on finely-cushioned seats all by
themselves, and sing psalms to all eter
nity. No, no.
I saw a great multitude that no man could
number, standing before the throne. He that
talked with me had a golden reed to measure
the city and it was 12,000 furlong's.
That is, onethousand-fivehundred miles
in circumference. Ah! Heaven is not
a little colony at one corner
God's dominion, where a man's
trance depends upon what kind
of
clothes he has on his back and how much
money he has in his purse, but avast
empire. God grant that the light of that
bles3ed world may shine upon our last
moment.
The roughest time we had in crossing
the ocean was at the mouth of Liverpool
harbor. We arrived at nightfall, and
were obliged to lie thsre till the morning,
waiting for the rising of the tide, before
we could go up to the city. How the ves
sel pitched and writhed in the water! So
sometimes the last illness of the Christian
is a struggle. He is almost through tha
voyage, lhe waves ot temptation toss his
soul, but he waits for the morning. At
la$t the light dawns, and the tides of j oy
rise in his soul, and ho sails up and casts
anchor within the vail.
Is thy heart right?
What question can compare with this in
importance?
It is a business question. Do you not
realize that you will soon have to go out of
that store; that you will have to resign
that partnership; that soon among all
the millions of dollars' worth
of good3 that are sold in New
York you will not have the handling of a
yard of cloth, or a pound of sugar, or a
penny worth of any thing; that soon if a
conflagration should start at Central
Park and sweep every thing to the Bat
tery, it would not disturb you; that soon
if every cashier should abscond, and
every insurance company should fail, it
would not affect you? What are the
questions that stop this side the grave
compared with the questions that reach
beyond it? Are you making losses that
are to be everlasting? Are you making
purchases for eternity? Are you jobbing
for time when you might be wholesaling
for eternity? What question of the store
is so broad at the base, and so altitudin
ous and so overwhelming as the question:
Is thy heart ritrht? ' - --
Or is it a domestic question? Is it
something about father, or motler, or
companion, or son, or daughter, that ycu
think is comparable with this question in
importance? Do you not realize that by
universal and inexorable law, ail t!ies9 re
lations will be broken up? Your' father
will be gone, your mother will be gone,
your companion will be gone, your child
will be gone, you will be gon and then

Napoleon III. whether he triumphed

give him any better chance for the next
world than if he had been laid out in a
plain shroud? And soon to us what will
be the difference whether in this World
we rode or walked, were bowed to or mal
treated, were applauded or hissed at,
were welcomed in or kicked out, while
laying hold of every morasnt of the great

Have you within you a repenting
heart, an expectant heart? If not I must

his diamond ring. Ho tarried in nn

there was no God recoznized in that

morning, with his ring he wrote upon
the widow pane, "One thing thou lack
est." After the guest was gone the
housewife camo up and looked at the
window and saw the inscription and
called her husband and ber children, and
God, through tiat ministry of the
window glass, brought them till to Jesus.
Though you may to-day bs surrounded bv

Secretary Lamar, in his annual report of the
perations of the Interior Department, says:
Perhaps the most difileult and important duty
with which this department is charged is the
administration of the public land system. The
theater of its operations embraces nearly
three-fourths of the areaof the American States
and Territories, and the vital influence exer
aised by the distribution of land ownership
among the people readers the proper adminis
tration of the system of profound importance
to the present and future prosperity of tha
country.
Under existing laws it is apparent that the
area of our public land is rapidly diminishing.
This would not be an evil if the lands were
passing from the Government to seats of
actual occupation by bona fide settlers, or
bona fide purchasers for purposes of settle
ment. Nothing can be a surer safeguard in a
free community astiinst the dominating in
fluences of powerful corporations and com
binations of capital tbuu a body of inde
pendent small land owners liviuK upon their
own freeholds. -. the facts are known to be
otherwise. It is a subject to which I have been
forced by the necessities of my position to give
much thought, and the conclusion to which I
have come is that most of the troubles and
abuses that environ it can be removed by legis
lative action, and that such action is the sole
remedy.
A detailed statement of the work performed in
theGeneral Land Office and its various agencies
throughout the country is fully set forth in the
report of the commissioner and the documents
therewith submitted. It shows a commendable
eeal In the purpose to preserve the public,
domain, to prevent fraud and illegality in the
acquirement of large areas of puhlio land, and
to recover them from unlawful possession and
appropriation.
The commissioner states that the following
amounts of lauds have been restored to the pub
lic domain since March 4, 18io:
An".
Area within railroad limits 0,953,177.33
Area within railroad indemnity
limits 21,3i.e4.r0

Fraudulent entries canceled sKW.UOJ.Gd
Invalid swamp and other State se
lections canceled 660,704.48
Total restored to the public
domain 31. 824, 481.70
In the eifort to ascertain the proportion of the
above amount which was restored during the
last, ilscal year, caused a thorough examination
of the records of the Lund Department to be
made, but was unable to obtain tiie desired in
formation. However, the investigation resulted in show
ing that from March 5, ids"), to October 1, 18S7,
tho number of entries canceled for fraud,
Illegality, abandonment -and other causes
amount to 9I.07S. embracing an area of H.S3S,
JH3.04 acres, making an agfirevate of lands re
stored to the public domain of 45,6M,
894 Bcres. In audition there are suits
lathe United States courts -and matters pend
ius: before the department, involving the ques
tion of the restoration of many millions more
acres, amounting in the asrf?rescate to 9,490,430.
10. Of this amount 2. Sr.7,:V..fj ai res were "ad
judged by the Commissioner to be subject to
recovery uuder the adjustment of railroad
grants, so tar as such adjustments have been
completed."

From the report of the Commissioner of the

drer thirty-four miles in width from north to
south; contains 5,738 square miles, or JMmjUHo
acres. Kxclu.led from the boundaries of these
States an 1 this Territory, it has always been
outside of any political jurisdiction. It is
simply a part of the public domain, over which
the land laws have not been extended, and
within the limits of which no tribunal, civil or
criminal, has jur.sdiction to protect property or
punish crime.
The land within the limits of this strip is said
to be fine for both agricultural and grazing pur
poses, the surface rolling r.nd well watered,
whilst valuable coal depositsbave Iveeu develop
ed in the western portion. Until lately the
"strip" was almost entirely fenced in and con
troledby a number of foreign cat tie companies.
But since the breaking up of illegal inclosure
will uso ot the public domain in this manner
there has been a great rush of people into this
locality.
Uy the Appropriation bill of March 3, 1S81 Ol
Stat., 451, the sum of 18.'l ) was appropriated
for "running correction line?, guide meridians
and township lines" therein. Tho sum thus
appropriated was expended as directed and the
townsh'p lines rnn, though the amount nilowed
was scarcely sufficient to complete the lines as
directed.
I bee; to urge that a special appropriation be
made to complete the survey over this tract.
An estimate furnished at my request by tho
surveying division of the. Laud Office states the
amount necessary for the purpose is $5',0o0, and
I hepe it will be granted.
It is further important that Congress should
authorize the establishment of a land office
within this strip and the lands therein at some
central and accessible point, subject to settle
ment under the homestead laws, with the com
mutation features eliminated. The Territory
should also be placed under some political or
ganization, so that civil and criminal law may
be properly administered therein.
The peculiar form and situation of the strip
makes the question of its proper disposal a
question of somo doubt. It is, of course, too
small to organize into a separate Territory.
Its condition, approximating most nearly to
that of New Mexico, naturally suggests that it
should be made part of that Territory subject
to its laws and government.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES OF Tft R UNITED STATES
TO TUB INDIAN TKIHKiS.
The liabilities of the United States to Indian
tribes under treaty stipulations, taking as the
basis, where no specific sums are stated in the
treaties, tho amounts appropriated last year,
are as follows: Permanent annuities, 13 19, -251 -93;
temporary annuities for speeitio periods,
$871.6iit.63: temporary annuities payable at
the pleasure of Congress or the President,
), 178,010: total, 7.3s,'.i.8.tio.
There was on deposit in the Treasury on No
vember 1, 18s0, of the proceeds of sales of In
dian lands, the sum of 7.(98,334.1!. Prom the
same source 1,64J. 815.91 were received during
the year ending November 1, 1887, making a
total of 9.3 11,13 ).10. Disbursements were made
from this fund during the same period to the
fimount of ?i(i,fi88 -.7, leaving a balance to that
aceount on November 1, 18ST. of 9,imi, 481.83, of
which ff8,92. 188.7.3 bear interest in lieu of in
vestment, the remainder, H73,SrS.10, being
available for expenditure for benefit of tho In
H:iu tribes to whose credit it stands.
The funds belonging to Indian tribes which
remain invested in State stocks ami other se
curities held by the Treasurer of the United
States as custodian, amount to 1,798.010. 83?f.
The additional sum of 484,0K)is carried as in

the invested funds is paid regularly only

PENSIONS.
The report of the Commissioner of Pensions
presented herewith, discloses v- very satisfac
tory condition of affairs in the management of
that bureau, and evidences a. greutiy increased
efficiently, and shows n diminished expendi
ture, i. ft., while the payments have increased,
and while the volume of w-orlc lies been greatly
enlarged, the expenses thereof have ben di
minished, clerk-hire has been less, and all the
incidental expenses have been decreased, while
the number of pensions allowed has been in
crease;!. In addition to the suggestions made by the
Coinmiasioner of Pensions, my attention has
been caiied to the fact that, under existing
laws, clependeii' orphan children of deceased
soldiers who ay be entitled to pension
can not have .;uch pension continued beyond
the aga of 1t, i, gardless of their physical or
mental conditUju. There are. a few instances
in which sue'j children are (physically and
mentally) utterly incapacitated for earning
their own livelihood, n:d in histanci'B where
it is made clearly to appear that the condition
of mental imbecility or insanity, or such
feebleness of ni;:. wor body, ex'sts as to make
the' '" votniess for earning

to secure the purchase of tho lots nt iess

wards sold privately by the syndic ito,
and the profits which should have been real
ized by the Government were divided
amongst Its members. It is believed that If
the sales could be held at Hot Spring t ae re
sulting increase in the number of bidders
would render such combination Impracticable,
and much higher prices would be realized."
This experience has deterred tue department
from authorizing any sales of lots since the last
auction, in May, 1884. And any further 8. lea
would sejra to be inadvisable under existing
laws.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
There nre also about 19.5(H) Indians scattered
over the public domain and not bring on any
reservations under charge of Indian ago at,
therefore no specific information of thmf in
dustrial pursuits is at hand.
The statistics complied from the annnVJ re
ports cf the various United States Indian
agents to the Commissioner of Ind'sn Affairs
represents that of the remaining 17.X Inf. an
under their supervision, about f.(Kro wear citi
zens' clothes wholly; that IS, -177 houses a oc
cupied by them: that about 25.00) can sreak
Knglish with sufficient intelligence forordosary
conversation: that more than 10,5. xl of their
children are in schools receiving educational
and industrial training, for whom 237 schools
are in operation, and that, over 3!,0iK) families
are eng; ged in industrial pursuits. Thry have
cultivated over 838,! no acres, built over .MY.oiki
rods of tencintr, produced otcr 730,000 bit dicta
of wheat, UsJ.ooo bushels of corn, 4 i,HJ
bushels of osits, 68,0i m bushels of Imrley
and rye, 614,000 . bushels of vegetif
bles and 83,0 ) pounds' of butter. Besides th
above, they have gathered for use and saio cou
sidorab'e (inanities of wild rice, berries, 1 tIh),
furs, iisa and snake root. -)te. They have tawed
1, 553,079 feet of lumber, cut 74,01 is) cords of wood
and ld"!,iM) tons of hay. They own over V, 3,000
horses, 3,0"0 mules, 113.000 cattle, 4S.i)() nwine
and l,2i'),000 sheep. Droughts have seriously
affected the yield of their crops the past y rr.
Whilst these results are generally gratifying,
they fail far short of guaranteeing an early
consummation of our policy of a complete
Indian civilization. And I can only rei.araie
the conviction expressed in former reports
that the Indian race has reached a crisis
in its history. Surrounded on all sides by the
forces of civilization; all the reservations
closed in and pressed upou by evr-iu-creaslng
masses of population, made up cf Im
petuous, daring and aggre. !ve settlers, n tiers,
ranchmen and trader; with no possibility of
removal to other reservations or of escape Into
mountain fastnesses, the only alternative pre
sented to the Indian race Is absolute extinction
or a quick entrance into the pale of American
civilization.
PltrVATE OBAKT3.
Another subject which, I womS respectfully
suggest, demands immediate legislution, is
the matter of private grants claimed to be
derived from the Spanish or Mexican Gov
ernments. This legislation, la my opinion
should be directed to two points; (1) To pro
viding for a trial and final delerminat on of
smth claims, subject only to appont to t ie Su
preme Court: S) an act ,f limitations h.irrinf
the presentation of new claims of this char
acter within a st ated period.
By section 8 of the act of July 23, IH1 (10
Statutes, 3"8), It is made t'.io duty of the
Surveyor General of New Mexico to "ascertain
the origin, nature, character and extent of all
claims to lands under the law, usages and
customs of Spain and Mexico." Ho is to inUe
report, of all such claims with his decision as to
the vr.lidiiy orthe invalidityof the same, which
report shall ho laid before Comjr: for
action, unit until final action of Con
gress on such claims all lands covered
1 hereby ehnll bo reserved from sale or other
disposal by the Govern merit. Umler 1 lie pro-'
visiors of this law, f,-iu time to time since Its
passage, many claims, have been made and
acted upon, whilst a number are yt. pending
be for Congress unacted upon. The extent
and number of the unconfirmed claims can not
be ac curately made, mid those heretofore pre
sented seem to grow enormously in area with
each passing year In tho issuance of patent
thereon. At tho present, time it Is approxi
mately estimated that the amount puldio
land actually reserved from entry snit settle
ment because of such cliiiiiis is u little Miort. of
