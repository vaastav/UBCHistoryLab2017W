WHAT SENATOR
FRYE THINKS.
Piiilippine Archipelago of the Utmost
Importance
Commercially to Our Country Now and in
tbe Future.
Are at the Very Threshold of the
Orient, With, an Importation
Amounting Last Year to a Bil
lion, and a Half, Which Will
Soon be Doubled—What the Re
' publicans Propose to Do for
Them.
NEW YORK, Dec. 10.—The "World"
to-morrow will publish an interview
■with Senator William P. Frye, Presi
dent pro tern. of the United States Sen
ate. In reply to the question why it
was necessary to take over the sover
eignty of the whole Philippine archi
pelago he said:
"Commercially they are of the ut
most importance to our country, lo
cated as they are at <he very threshold
of the Orient, with an importation last
year amounting to $1,500,000,000, with
an advancing civilization which will in
a few years, by increasing their necessi
ties, double it.
"Then, too, the existing conditions in
the islands afforded a powerful argu
ment in favor of our action. Asuinaldo,
with his seventeen chieftains, then ex
iles at Singapore, went to Hongkong to
sail with Admiral Dewey for Manila.
He having already sailed, they were
taken over in' one of our revenue cut
ters, received arms from the Admiral,
raised an army, fought successtully the
common enemy, were of assistance to
us, and while no promises were made
them, orally or in writing, they were
practically our allies. Could we de
sert and leave them to the tender mer
cies of Spain? Surely no American citi
zen would have justified us in sucn
action."
"What do the Republicans propose to
do with the Philippines?" he was asked
"First, restore pe\ce there. Then
give them a good Government, decent
wages, arouse in the people an ambi
tion to become good citizens, supply
them with modern agricultural imple
ments, construct railroads and high
ways making access to the sea easy,
build schoolhouses, supply teachers, ed
ucate them so as to fit them for the
exercise of governmental functions,
then trust them with the control cf
local and municipal affairs. Possibly
in time they may become fit to estab
lish a republican, stable and strong
enough Government to preserve order
and peace, to protect life and property,
to make treaties, observe their obliga
tions under them and compei others to
do likewise.
"Possibly when that time arrives, we,
being the sole judges, might surrender
to them the sovereignty, reserving to
ourselves the naval and coaling stations
necessary for our naval and merchant
marine. So far as lam personally con
cerned, I would never surrender the
sovereignty to any people within the
Islands or to any nation without."
He was asked what our constitutional
rights in these new possessions were, as
to civil rights, tariffs, emigration, etc.,
and replied:
"That question is one of great im
portance, undoubtedly soon to be dis
cussed in Congress and at an early date
settled. Therefore, I do not wish now.
with only partial preparation, to deal
with it. I believe, however, that Con
gress has full power to enact for them
such laws as may seem to be wise and
just; that the constitutional limitation
as to the United States, so often re
ferred to, does not apply to Territories.
"I am confident that in the near fu
ture three or four regiments of white
men, with possibly twice as many na
tives, will be ample to preserve the
peace."
ROSSER S STORY.
Says He Did Not Intend to Shoot
Slater.
NEW YORK, Dec 10.—Walter Ros- j
ser, who originally gave his name to
the polise as Willis Rosser, a student i
at the Post Graduate Hospital, who !
shot Fred F. Slater at Madison Square ,
Garden last night, was arraigned in j
the Police Court to-day.
The wounded man's condition was re
ported as favorable, and on the request
of Rosser's counsel, the prisoner was
held in $1,000 bail for examination on
Tuesday. He was, however, unable to
furnish bail and was locked up.
Rosser declared ' to-day that he had
no intention of shooting Slater, that he 1
had been drinking and met two or three ;
students, who were guying him and!
bluffing him about betting on the bicy- j
cle contests, and that finally they!
made an attack upon him. He drew i
bis revolver, he says, and fired oni shot |
Simply for the purpose of frightening j
them away, and did not aim at SI it;*
or Intend to shoot him.
BELIEVED TO BE ROSSER.
STEVENSON (Ala,), Dec. 10.—No
Such man as Rafters is known in this
City. Walter Rosser is in New York
taking a post graduate? course in medi
cine, and it is generally believed here
that the party who did the shooting in
New York Is Walter Rosser, who while
attached to the hospital corps of the
First Tennessee Regiment shot a man
in San Francisco, and from , which
charge he was released on a plea of
insanity.
A room mate of Rosser at 181) Lex
ington avenue, where he has lived since
he came here to attend the lectdres at
the Polyclinic, said to-night that he
had never seen any signs of aberration
during his acquaintance with the
prisoner. Rosser, he said, had often
spoken to him of San Francisco and
of the First Tennessee Regiment, but
had never made any reference to any
shooting affair.
HOME FOR CONSUMPTIVES.
A Jewish Order Formally Dedi
cates One at Denver.
DENVER. Dec. 10.—The National
Jewish Home for Consumptives, locat
ed in-this city, was formally dedicated
to-day. President Grabfelder of Lou
isville and.Rabbi Friedman of Denver,
delivered the principal addresses.
The home was built by the Jewish
order of B'nal B'rith but is not intend
. . . ...
Ed for the care of members of that order
or race alone. Anyone suffering from
consumption who is unable to pay for
treatment and care in any other Insti
tution is admissible into this one. It
was constructed with' the one idea of
providing a home for the penniless con
sumptives.
CENTURY WHEELMEN.
They May Receive Large Acces
sions to Their Membership.
CLEVELAND, Dec 10.—President
Charles "W. Heaton of the American
Century Wheelmen, when asked what
effect, if any, the election in Chicago
to-day of offlters of the Century Road
Club would have upon the new national,
organization of which he is the execu
tive, said:
"The same element against which the
Ohio division of the Century Road
Club fought so bitterly is again in
power, and the result, in icy opinion,
will be an enormous loss in membership
to the State organization. We are in
receipt of hundreds of letters and tele
grams from all ■ parts of the United
States ofiering large additions to our
membership in case the election just
closed should go against the ticket
headed by W. H. Mackey of New
York."
THE MESSAGE ATTACKED.
The German Agrarian Press Now
Unites In It.
BERLIN, Dec 10.—After keeping si
lence at first, the Agragrian press now
begins to make a united attack upon
that part of President McKinley's
message to Congress relating to the
joint commission proposition. The
"Deutsche Tages Zeitung" says to-day:
"Such a proposition is wholly unac
ceptable. It Is monstrous. Its outcome
would be that .the shrewd Yankees
would bamboozle the German members
of the commission about American
meat, with caldrons double bottomed
and similar ricks, while the Americans
here would manufacture evidence
against beers and wines. President
McKinley's claim as to the healthful
ness of American meats is preposterous
after the scandalous embalmed meat
trial."
CONSUL MACRUM.
— !—
Returning With Important Infor
mation for State Department.
CHICAGO, Dec. 10.—A special to the
"Chronicle" from East Liverpool, 0.,
says: Friends in this city of Charles
E. until recently United
States Consul at Pretoria,. says he is
returning to this country with impor
tant information for the State Depart
ment which he was unwilling to risk
cabling.
His letters conclusively prove that
not only was Macrum not persona non
grata to the Transvaal Government,
but that he was on the best possible
personal terms with President Kruger.
Cabling could only be done over a line
controlled in part by England. It is
believed the information brought by
Macrum is from President Kruger and
the purpose is to initiate measures to
bring the war to a close on honorable
terms to the Dutch republic
THE FINANCE BILL.
Democrats Will Carry the Discus
sion of It Into the Campaign.
CHICAGO, Dec. 10.—Judge Johnson
of the Democratic Executive Commit
tee to-day said:.
"The introduction of the Republican
monetary bills shift the issue before
the country. The discussion will be
for or against \he single gold stan
dard, instead of for or against silver as
It was in 1806.
"The Democratic party will maintain
its stand in favor of free and unlim
ited coinage of gold and silver at the
ratio of 16 to 1, independent of the con
sent of any foreign nation—in short,
independent bimetallism. The discus
sion in Congress over the Republican
caucus gold standard measure will be
the beginning' of/he discussion which
will be carried through the campaign."

With. All the Nations.
PARIS, Dec. 30.—The "Figaro" pub
lishes an interview to-day with M.
Lookroy, former French Minister of
Marine, in the course of which he says:
"The British navy is twice as strong
as ours. It is able to oppose simultan

triple alliance. Where French fleets
are stationed they are confronted by
twice or thrice their strength.
"France must have cables. Great
Britain's bases of supply are all con-1
nected, and the British are ready for
war to-morrow if necessary with every
nation on the globe."
GOVERNOR OF CUBA.
That Will he the Official Designa
tion of General Wood's Office.
NEW YORK, Dec. 11.—A special to
the "Herald" from Washington says:
"Governor of Cuba" will be the official
designation of the office to which Major
General Wood will be assigned early in
the new year as the successor to Major
General Brooke, the present military
Governor of the island.
By omitting the word "military," the
President hopes to impress upon the
THE SACBAMEXTO, "MOKDAT, DECEMBER 11. 1890.
Cubans that under the new regime
"civil" government as far as possible
under military officers and men will
obtain. The word "oivil" will not be
substituted for "military," because that
Would appear incongruous in view of
the authority under which the President
is operating. Nevertheless, it is the de
sire of the President that General Wood
shall cut loose from rigid military
methods and allow the Cubans the
widest latitude possible in municipal af
fairs. Indeed, that was his principal
motive in selecting General Wood for
the Governorship. The number of de
partments in the island will probably
be reduced in a month or two, so that
there will be no necessity for all the
general officers now there. General Lud
low desires, it is understood,, to come
home when General Wood takes com
mand.
Notwithstanding the opposition from
the line of the army to the appoint
ment of General Wood as Major Gen
eral of Volunteers, the confirmation by
the Senate of his nomination may be
accepted as a foregone conclusion. A
favorable report by the Military Com
mittee may be looked for on Tuesday,
and his confirmation will probably im
mediately follow. General Wood wlil
remain in Washington until he has re
ceived his new commission, and will
then proceed to Santiago and arrange
for his transfer to Havana.
DARING ROBBERY.
Express Company's Safe Robbed of
a Large Sum ait Omaha.
OMAHA, Dec. 10.—A special to the
"Bee" from Chayenne, Wyo., says: The
details of a most daring robbery are
just coming to light here. Last night
between the hours of 9 and 10 o'clock
the office of the Pacific Express Com
pany was robbed of several thousand
dollars in money, and although offi
cers set at work immediately and the
strictest secrecy has been maintain!*!,
not a single clew has been discovered.
There is a small force of men in the
office at night to handle express on in
coming and outgoing trains and when
these trains arrive the men have been
in the habit of locking the office. This
was done last night as usual and when
the express men returned twenty min
utes later, the north door or city en
trance was open, as was also the safe
door. The discovery was made that all
the money in the safe was missing. The
officials of the company refuse to state
the amount of money taken, which is
reported to be between $5,000 and $25,
--000. Indications point to the fact,
however, that the loss is considerable.
The entire express office force is under
surveillance and the robbery is being
thoroughly Investigated.

THE CARBONADO
MINE HORROR.
i _____
People Too Dazed For an Express
ion of Grief.
y
Thirty-Two is the Number of the Dead
Miners.
Governor Rogers Will Conduct a
Searching Investigation as to
the Cause of the Explosion and
the Question of Insufficient
Ventilation Will be Thor
oughly Gone Into by State Mine
Inspector Owens.
CARBONADO (Wash.), Dec. 10 —
Stunned by the suddenness of the mine
horror, the people here seem too dazed
for any expression of grief of a dem
onstrative nature.
Thirty-two is the number of dead. As
by a miracle, two men were rescued at
5 o'clock this morning after suffering
an awful night entombed in the dark
cavernous chambers of horrors.
Almost mocking the doleful situation,
one of these men, Peter Merpx, proudly
slapped himself on the breast as he was
emerging from the mouth of the main*
tunnel, ejaculating:
"Peter's all right; how's my dogs?"
In painful contrast to him was the
other fortunate, named Michael Knish,
a Pole. So sickened had he been with
the bad air, laden with its black damp,
that he could hardly find his voice, and
what utterances he did give vent to
were born of delirium. Later in the day
Knish said:
"I was working on the fourth cross
cut when it came. After that I went
to sleep and somebody came and woke
me up and took me out of there."
That was the tell-tale measure of his
period of consciousness. All he knew
was that an explosion had happened,
and then he fell alseep until rescued.
He had lain in the cool depths over
eighteen hours and had not the least
conception of this length of time. On
the other hand, Peter, the Frenchman,
had been blindly groping around in the
darkness for the most of the night on
his hands and knees, seeking for some
avenue of escape.
Save these two men the death list
remains the same.
The injured, in addition to Knish,
; number five. They are: Andrew
j Kichinko, Michael J. Kichinko. Hunga
: rians; Abraham Kalunki, a Finn, and
; James Conway, the first man to leave
. the mine of Foreman Davis' shift, all
!of whom are severely burned, and Can
; dido Parolini, an Italian, who has sev
i eral ribs fractured by falling timbers,
j Governor Rogers will conduct ' a
i searching examination as to the cause
of the explosion. He has telegraphed
; State Mine Inspector Owens, now at
j Spokane, to attend the inquest to-mor
; row and examine witnesses himself. The
j question of inefficient ventilation of the
t mine in accordance with the State law
will be thoroughly gorre>into.
It has been impossible to secure an
impartial Coroner's jury in the min
-1 Ing district and Coroner Hoska has
gone to Tacoma and will select hia jur
, ors there.
The theory of Superintendent Davies
is that a small pocket of gas was
opened and became ignited. The con
- cussion of gas explosion caused the ter
rific explosion of dust whjch caused all
lof the damage and loss of .Hfe.
j The total number of men in the un
' fortunate shift was seventy-six, of
whom forty-four are alive, all of them
having escaped or been rescued.

TRANSPORT ZEALANDIA.
Brings Bodies of Captain McGrath
and Two of First California.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 10.—The
United States transport Zealandia ar
rived to-day from Manila with ten pas
sengers, among whom were Captain T.
P. Dorris, master of the wrecked trans
port Morgan City; Major Charles Mc-
Oiure, Captain C. L. Porter, U. S. A,
and two discharged Soldiers.
The bodies of Captain H. J. McGrath
of the Fourth Cavalry, H. H. Hopkins
of Company F, First California, and
Frank J. Murray, Company A, First
California, arrived on the transport.
Captain McGrath was killed a few days
before the Zealandia reached the Phil
ippines. He was out on the south fir
ing line and was shot ln the leg. He
was taken to Manila and operated on,
but died a few days later. Hopkins
and Murray were shot early in the war
and were buried in Manila. Their re
mains came consigned to Mayor Phe
lan.
The priests at Malate were made glad
by the recovery of about $12,000 worth
of relics. While the Zealandia was in
Manila Bay, a company of engineers
drove a body of insurgents i out of a
small town and there found a lot of
loot which the Filipinos were preparing
to turn into cash. The property was
at once turned over to the church au
thorities. The court of inquiry into the
loss of the Morgan City fully exonerat
ed Captain Dorris, but suspended the
pilot for life.
C. S. Robinson, who arrived on the
Zealandia, had the contract to raise the
cable steamer Hooker, wrecked on Cor
regidor Island, but found it impossible
to save the vessel. He says the Fili
pino leaders admit their defeat and he
thinks Aguinaldo will soon be captured.

There will be no further prosecution
of the charges of embezzlement against
O. M. Welburn, formerly Collector of

AMERICAN PRISONERS.
Considerable Anxiety Felt as to
Their Safety.
NEW YORK, Dec. 11.—A special to
the "Herald" from Washington says:
Considerable concern has been felt
in official circles for some time respect
\ ing the fate of American prisoners still
| held by the Filipino insurgents. This
jis due to an intimation made by Aguin
aldo in a note to General Otis, dcliv
' ered a month ago, that grave injury
might befall the prisoners If recogni
tion of the so-called Filipino republic
jby the United States was longer de
' layed.
It was in answer to this threat that
the President sent a message to Gen
eral Otis for transmission to Aguin
aldo, announcing that if the prisoners
; were maltreated in any manner he and
| his subordinates would be held person
ally responsible.
At that time Aguinaldo was believed
to be within the cordon established by
the American troops reaching from San
Fabian to San Isidro. While it cannot
be learned that Aguinaldo received the
communication General Otis undoubt
edly succeeded in apprising him of its
contents, and knowing the result of
wanton injury' either to American or
Spanish prisoners, it is hoped here that
Aguinaldo will see that they are pro
tected from harm.
Aguinaldo's effort to secure recogni
tion by threatening injury to the pris
oners is considered by the officials as
the last card to be played by the in
surgent leader. It has been noticed
that although the insurgents have per
mitted many Spanish prisoners to es
cape they have carefully held the
American prisoners. This leads the offi
cials to believe that Aguinaldo hopes,
if finally captured to make terms ad
vantageous to himself. This would be
impossible if the prisoners were found
to have suffered any harm.
SPECIAL PROCLAMATION
Regarding Rewards for Officers
and Men Not Yet Recognized.
NEW YORK, Dec. 10.—A special to
the "Herald" from Washington says:
It is expected the President will soon
send to Congress a special proclama
tion regarding rewards for officers and
men of the Atlantic fleet who distin
guished themselves during the war
with Spain and whose gallantry has not
yet been recognized.
President McKinley has the Samp
son-Schley matter under serious con
sideration. He is understood to be
willing that a bill should be passed au
thorizing the revival of the grade of
Vice Admiral for the benefit of Rear
Admirals Sampson and Schley, the
former to be given seniority over the
latter. It is believed Secretary Long
| will join in indorsing this solution of
i the controversy.
What will probably cause considera
ble criticism among the friends of Rear
Admiral Schley is the determination
of Secretary Long to name Rear Ad
miral Sampson In the message he is
preparing giving the thanks of Con
; gress to the commander in chief of the
; North Atlantic squadron and the ofS
-1 cers and men under his command,
i It is not believed here, however, that
i the President will transmit such a res-
I olution to "Congress, knowing what de
termined opposition it will meet and
the probability that friends" of Schley
j would have his name substituted for
that of Sampson and pass the resolu
tion in that form.
GAT A CRE* S DEFEAT.
He Whs Apparently Caught in an
Ambush.
| NEW TORK, Dec. 11.—A dispatch to
. the "Tribune" from London says:
The British forces in South Africa
I have met with a signal defeat. This
! sensational news was officially an
nounced from the War Office at mid
; night, General Gatacre admitting that
he had met with a serious reverse in
an attack yesterday morning on
Stormberg in Northern Cape Colony.
, The British General says he was mis-
I led by guides as to the Boer position
and found "impracticable ground." Ap
parently he was caught in an ambush,
as his casualties as at present known
are alarming. The numbers of dead
and wounded cannot be considered ex
cessive in the circumstances, but the
enormous numbers reported missing
suggest that the engagement must not
' have been unlike that of Nicholsons
: Nek, when General White lost so heav
ily.
j General Methuen's army is known to
j have been heavily reinforced at Mod-
I der River with infantry, cavalry and
artillery, while General Wauchope's
Highland Brigade has largely Increased
the number of bayonets available for
| frontal attack. The necessity for this
costly method of warfare has been ob
viated by the presence of a full bri
gade of cavalry commanded by Gen
eral Babington.
This brigade includes three regiments
of cavalry and a strong body of pro
' vincial horse. Two powerful batteries
:of horse artillery have been added, with
;a mobility nearly equal to that of cav
| airy. Methuen's army cannot number
' less than 17,000 men, and its maneuver
ing power has been increased until
there is slight justification for frontal
attacks made without adequate recon
noissance and scouting. Military men
assume that he has not left Modder
River until the section of the Howitzer
Battery with lyddite ammunition lias
arrived.
General Buller's admirers laugh at the
idea that he will attempt to force the
passage of the river at the point whsre
the Boeis are strongest. They assert
jthat he will mask crossing with heavy
artillery as soon as the Howitzers are
sent up from Durban, but that the
main body of the army will go over
higher up, after a feint has been made
lower down, and that the enemy's posi
tion will be turned, Ladysmith relieved
and the retreat of the Free Staters to
; the mountain passes cut off. Nothing
can be simpler than strategy in a com
fortable service club without interrup
tion from the unmannerly Boers.
He travels safe and not unpleasantly
who is guarded by poverty and guided
iby love.—Sir P. Sidney. j

Resolved, That the Board of Trustees
of the city of Sacramento deems it to be
required by the public interest or conven
ience, ani hereby orders the following
street work to be done according to the
specifications therefor hereby adopted,

disturbed the gain for the year would
probably have been above $20,000,000.
As all these principal districts are now
in condition to produce at a higher rate
than at the opening of th« present year,
and all are preparing for larger yields
it is not improbable that when opera
tions are fully resumed in South Afri
ca, the world's output wiil quickly pass
$400,000,000 per annum. The world's
stock of coin is now being Increased
more rapidly and by a higher annual
percentage to the existing stock, than
during the period from 1850 to 1800,
when the great output of gold from
California and Australia, startled the
economists of all countries and gave
I the world a depreciating standard of
values. The effect of this new flood
jof standard money upon tha markets,
the Industries, the earnings of those
who work for wages, and all of the va
rious relations of the people in our
present highly organized society, wlil
be a most interesting study. It will
inevitably be a potent factor in affairs.
BIG LUMBER CONTRACTS.
All Next Year. Cut at Duluth,
Could be Readily Sold.
DULUTH (Minn.), Dec 10.—Contracts
jfor the delivery of about 00.000,000 feet
jof pine logs to mills Ul this section by
: railroads have been closed recently. Of
j those contracts the Wisconsin Division
of the Northern Pacific Road has closed
a total of about 250,000,000 feet, part
of which will be delivered at this city
; and part at Ashland,
i Several mills have sold their entire)
season's cut, receiving prices at a great
advance over last year's figures.
! Every lumberman who will dispose of
his product in advance is being im
portuned to do so, and 400,000,000 fett
of Duluth lumber could be sold in a
i week to buyers from New York, New
England, Eastern Michigan and Chi
cago. This will be practically all next
year's cut for the mills on deep water
in this harbor.
WANT A CUBAN MISSION.
Fears Expressed That Cuban Clergy
May Abandon Catholic Church.
HAVANA, Dec. 10.—A number of In
fluential Cubans are about to send a
petition to the Pope, asking for a Cv"
ban mission.
"The condition of Catholicism," say
the petitioners, "is critical in the isl
and, especially in view of the fact that
unbounded gratitude exists toward
the Protestant American nation which
helped Cuba in her struggle for liberty.
Intercourse between Cubans and Amer
icans is already close, and becoming
closer. Several branches of the Prot
estant Church in Cuba have already
nominated Cuban clergy, who will use
a powerful influence on behalf of Proi
testantism. Even patriotic sentiment
can be counted on to lead the Cuban
clergy to abandon the church headed
and directed by foreigners"
