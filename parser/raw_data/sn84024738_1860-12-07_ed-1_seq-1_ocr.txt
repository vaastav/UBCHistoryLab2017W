Tiie New York Tribune bitterly attacks the
PraaidaaPa arraignmeni of the Northern
Statea, but is of the opinion that what he says
• : Ue alleged right of secession, and the in
>xp*___M_ay, if a_-4 impossibility of coercion
i- in the main forcibly and well said." ] t Cui .!
t,iidea .
on the whole, though there is but a small
j...i tion of the Message as printed that wecan
approve, we heartily thank the President for
the four columns that, ou revision, he omitted.
The omission of another like amount would
tiat c rendered it quite a re.-pec table document.
We thank him, moreover, lor the similar mes
_.«{-■»« that be will refrain Irom writing
thi-jugbout the years to come. Aud, though
we cannot commend the moral insensibility
which renders him tumble to see why any good
citizen should deteW slave-hunting in free
Suites, wecan heartily congratulae him on
ttie fact tbat he is soon to be relieved from the
cares of State, aud we assure him that in such
re- lief the great body of the people will heartily
»..• ..i .-Utilize.
With regard to the want of constitutional
authority to coerce a seceding State, the New
York Times says:
It seems incredible that any man holding a
high t ilicial position should put forth sujch aa
argument. It is not a question ol war at all—
nor is it a question between the State and the
Federal Government. It is simply a question
of obeAXeStCS to the laws of Congress —aud theob
ligatioii rests upon the individual citizens of
the State. It is their duty to obey those laws,
mid the Sta'e has no authority to release them
from auch obedience, because the Federal Con
stitution, and the laws made iv pursuance
thereof! are expressly declared by the Consti
tution itself to be the supreme law of the land,
"anything In the Constitution or laws of
any State to the contrary notwithstanding."
Tne Government has precisely ihe same power
to enforce every law ot Congress in South
Carolina that it has to enforce the Fugitive
Slate law iv Massachusetts. Mr. Baobanan
does not invoke the war-making powers in ihe
one case—why should he iv the other !
i'he Times concludes:
The Message, in our judgment, is an incen
diary document, and will tend still lurtber to
.xusperate the sectional differences of the day.
It backs up the most extravagant of the de
mands which have been made by the South,
indorses their menace of disunion if those de
m.tuds are not conceded—and promises the se
eadiag Statp* that the power of the Federal
iloverument sh .11 noi be uted for their coer
cion. Tbe entire North will be made doubly
inuiguaut by thi? flagrant dereliction of duty
on the part of the Executive of the Nation,
While the Disunionista of the South will be
itiinnlated to fresh exertions in the work of
ruin upon which they have embarked. The
country has to struggle through three months
nor* of this disgraceful imbecility and dis-
I iy tlty to the Constitution.
The New York World, in an article geuer
allj commendatory of the Mu.sage, says :
His *, lews of the inadequacy of the alleged
Jeusons for this formidable secession move
ment; of tbe safety and the duty of further
deliberation and delay; of the restraints,
lav .ruble to conservatism, which the respon
sibilities of odlce wili impose on Mr. Lincoln,
of the absurdity of .-eceasiou when claimed aa
■ ..uiuiional right, and his construction
of tn. own dune* and powers under existing
l_w„, are sound, and well suited to the grave
txigeaey tbey ure in'ended to meet. But,
v _>•_ he proceeds to address Congress on its
ilnties, his recommendations seem to us a
great deal better than his reasoning.
Whether the Federal Government lias pow
artocoerce a State Into submi-.iou will, at
'.ins juncture, be thought a question of no
practical eeaeeanenee by that part of the
country (probably a great majority) who agree
with the President that such a power ought
not to be exerted, if the Iten-titutiou confers
It. If we are not to cut this gordian knot, but
to untie r; if the country ia to be extricated
from thia* difficulties, not by '.he strong arm,
but by argument, by expostulation, by per
■Ußsioa, by concession, it makes uo difference
whether there ia thunder sleeping in tbe na
tional cannon or uot. Since Mr. Buchanan's
' .-commendations are patriotic aud etatesmau
like, w,> are iv no mood lo quarrel with that
part of his reasoning trom which we dis
i-iit.
In relation to the right of coercion, thePhil
f*dr_!phia American says :
Oa this punt we are surprised to find that
h» has come to views quite at variauce with
'hose of the opening ot bis Message. He be-
Itevw that no power has been delegated to
Ciigress to suppre-.s revolution in a State;
'li* eov.runieut of so tnucb power become_
powerless in the very ciisis wbicb tries us
atreagth. If resistance to tbe lawsiaattempt
• J by a State government, suchiesistance can-
Bot by .-u]»pre..aed, because to do 10 would be
in-iking war on a State, in bis argument; and
;f this poMtmn is correct, the legal tie_ which
b.ttd the Union are le_s thau ropes of sand—
I _.«, part of the Message, if ii were not extra
l*>*uc4aLaad, therefore, of uo more value than
»'•> iiidividaal's opinion, would destroy tbe
whole force of the etatemem. of duly which
precede it; fur if a President cau act on prin
ciple, ao loose, be can destroy ail law. and or
u*-r when _ie will. We believo, Uowner, that
ll ».e part of the Message was prepared iv a
••Pint of weak concession to the disunion eie
wants of tbe Cabinet, and was luteuded to ca-
Jjar to tbe prevailing sentiment of diaunion
We regret this error, not because we
advocate coercion, or a.sume now to say what
the duty of tbe General Government may be
**_*_n the exigency cornea, but becauae we dep
recate the loosening of all restraints and the
"•i.__e of all penalties at a time when eucb
•''ii-ttkß directly incites to tbe worst acta of
traaaou to the only power wbicb can preserve
t_e uation lv peace.
The Philadelphia Pre*s says that the Presi
dent "could have offered no mora grateful ar
t..v.iv to the disuoioniata" than tbat iv rela
tion to coercion, and adds;
"The sum and aubatauc* of this Met sage,

The Philadelphia Hulletin, iv an articte at

By declaring that secession ia revolution
; and then declaring that tbe United Statea have
nopowerto put down revolution, the Presi
dent puts the country in about aa ridiculouj
B position as any poor country ever was placed

. and our I nion are a stupendous sham ; that
while we bave been boasting of being a great
country, with a strong government, good laws
and the power to enforce them, we have no
government at all; m a word, that we are a

Difficulty on Board tub Mail Boat--
We understand that a difficulty occurred on
board the Mail steamer from Acquia Creek
yesterday afternoon, which came near leading
to a serious result. It appears that a man
from Connecticut, who has been traveling
through a portion of the South, made some re
marks at various times derogatory of Sonth
Carolina and her citizens. These remarks
were heard by a Virginian, a residentot Siouth
i.arolina, who resented tbem, calling the man
Irom Connecticut a d n liar aud scouudr. 1
and challenging bim to mortal combat in the
forward part of the steamer, and offerino- to
furnish him either a pistol or bowie-knife a*
a weapon. This occurred at tbe dinmg-tabie
and caused greatexcitemeutandcon. .ernatioii
The Connecticut man declined the challenge
when the captain of the steamer and many of
the passengers interfered, and any further dif
, tlculty was prevented. The man from Con
necticut was, however, advised not to obtrude
his obucxioiis views iv the presence of South
erners, unless he was prepared to meet the
consequences.— AM*. {Va.) Gazette.
Russia Pays Up.-During the Crimean

, ports, in concealed cotton-bales and casks of
rice. Tbe set-erne was discovered, and peace
having been declared, the Russian broke tho
. contract. Capt. Perkins laid his claim be
f.re tbe State Department and it diploma'ic
; correspondence ensued, during which Aitor
; ney General Black sustained the claimant.—
His agent, Mr. Stewart, it is said, went to S..

TIIE RKPORTB OF SB< RKTAKIKS.
The Navy Report recommeud.. additional to
what we have before quoted, the ra_.ee,ug and
converting Inio lirst class . team-frigates only
ei_ht slilps-of-tbe-line, at a cost oi «a-_,OOO
each, us the others would not pay tbe ex .co.c
being old ; that th* frigates Sabine aud Sarr.ee'
to be left as they are, and the rerauining six
sailing fr.gates converted into .steam sloop*
.if-war, and llnally into store-ships ; tbat new
(loop* ol Y*_.r should tte built to replace those
built prior to lain. The neeeeat condition of
the active navy is, commended. Screw steamers
are favored, und side-wheels, in case of war
opposed. A v increase of the Navy is demand
ed, on the ground that wo have now a navi
gating interest of Uve million tons, an import
.uid export trade of six or seven million of dol
lars, aud a coasting trade of equal extent, and
value. All additions to the navy should em
ploy steam power. Attention is called to tbe
net that the Constitution prohibits individual
S'ntea from creating a navy of iheir own.
Estimates are submitted for replacingall the
prominent Navy-Yards of the country in a
condition of lull activity. The efficiency and
discipline of the Naval Academy under Capt.
Blake is approved. Iv thm Slams trade tw-'ve
vesstis have been ci-ptured this year by the A/riran
S<juudron,and more than 3,111 _l negroes rsseued. A
strong hint is given that the Slave trade can
only tlnally bo suppressed by England's en
lorcmg her treaty ot 1817 with Spain in refer
ence to Cuba, or the annexation of Cuba hy the
United States. The bill introduced by Jeffer
son Davis prohibiting the purchase ol patented
article., for tbe Army and Navy is opposed as
injurious to the service.
The .Secretary recommends that he have
power to purchase butter, cheese, ll iur, and
tobacco lor the Navy by private purchase and
not by advertised contract. Thi present state
and service* of the various squadrons and
_hip.s are then formally recorded, compliments
being paid to Commodores Poor, Porter and
Brent, lor prompt action in righting the
wrongs of American cDizens. The Japanese
Embassy, reports as to the raaritie corps, sur
geons, and paymasters, together with brief
statistics of the various exporting expedi
tions, form the balance cf the Secretary's re
port, which closes with a summary of naval
estimates for the fiscal year ending June 3U,
1882—total amount 911.013,904.01.
From the report of the Secretary of the In
terior, we learn that of the Public Lands 12,-
O-ti,(_;.') acres have been disposed ot, 3.977.019
selling for cash, yielding t_.b3!,____, aiid §9 -
6111,723 absorbed under railroad grants, and
the rest in bounty laud warrants and swamp
grant;.. Over a million of dollars were ex
, ponded in the payment of pensions during the
fiscal year. The income of tne Patent-Office
is SB,WX) above expenses; 3,-% patents have
been issued and 3,612 applications rejected.—
i The Census will be prepared for the present
Congress. The necessity of revising the laws
prohibiting the Slave trade, and especially lv
providing for the disposal of rescued negroes,
is urged.
The S?cretary of the Interior first alludes to
. the extraordinary development of the inter
nal resources of the country, especially aa ex
hibited in the report of the Land Offices —
During the fiscal year ending June HO, i-_O,
and the quarter ending the itotb of September
. last, 16,385,361 acres of public lands have been
proclaimed lor sale. During the same period,
5,649,471 acres have been surveyed and pre
f pared for market, and 11,-t.u...... M acres have
been disposed of in the following manner:
f 3,977,619 -(» acres have been sold for cash.yield
[ ing -_,o'.H,4__. 97; 3,.'175..l 40 acres bave been ab
. eorbed by the location of bounty land war
, rants; 2,t1_7,770 M acres npproved to Suites
• under tbe swamp grants; and -_,<i__,_-3 acres
i under the railroad grants, The number of
; military bounty land warrants outstanding
[ on the 30th if September last was 7l,.'i_, and
they will require _,l!Hi,5-*0 acres of the public
domain to satisfy them.
The Secretary can And no fault with the ex -
J lsting public land system ; lor forty years the
price of public lands has been Sl__S per acre,
which has satisfied the majority. The home
stead system has everywhere failed, the public
'. discussion of this system has greatly retarded
' emigration.
He knows of no reason why the title to the
lands at the Hot Springs of Arkansas should
be reserved in perpetuity, and therefore re
j commends that the disposal of the four sec
tions reserved be provided for by appropriate
legislation.
' As to the grant of land to the State of lowa
fer the improvement of the Drs Moines river,
he says : "Ha. ing recommended to the Com
mittee of Public Lands of tha Senate, in Jnne
last, a relinquishment to th;* Stateof all title
remain ing in the United States to Ibe 279,379
acres of land erroneously listed aud certified
under the De.s Moines grant, I have directed a
au. pension of immediate action under the rail
road grants, so far as the two conflicting
claims interlere. Tho lands along tbe upper
portions of the Dcs Moines river, not embraced
in any of the certified lists, which have been
surveyed for four, five and six years, but with
held from market on account of the claim of
the State, have recently been proclaimed aud
1 offered at public sale."
The progress of the public surveys in the
Territory of Washington has been interrupt
, ed on accountof the existence of certain laud
' claims under the treaty of June 15, I*l6, with
Great Britain. Two tracts—one aiNisqually,
1 containing by estimate 107,010 acres, and ano
ther at Cowlitz, containing about 3,000 acre*—
have been claimed under the 4th article of tbe
same treaty, for the Puget'a Sound Agricul
[ tural Company. "It is due to the people of
Wa6hiugtou Territory that some dectelv* ac
tion should betaken. lam not advised that
any portion of the tracts claimed are of any
1 public or political importance to tbe United
Suites, and I recommend that the Surveyor
General of Washington Territory, under the
supervision of this Department, tie authorized
by apecial enactment to decide upon the validi
ty of tbe claims of the Puget'a Souud Agricul
tural Co., aud, tf they are entitled to confirm
ation, to determine the location und bounda*
ries of the farms and lands that belonged to
the company, which should be required, with
in a given period, to present its claims for flnal
action."
"The colonization system which waa tried
In California and Texas, under the direction
of Congress, and from which 1 at one time
hoped for tbe most favornblu results,litis proved
, an en lire failure, li is expensive and radically
defective."
As to a strip of land in dispute between the

Letter from Secretary Flo. d.
Kon. John B. Floyd writes a letter to the
Richmond Enquirer, in reply to one from tbe
editors of that paper. He thinks tbe time baa
passed when "the counsels ol any onecau ar
reet the precipitate currents of event* or avert
the result which an exasperated and excited
public feeling haa rendered inevitable. "
The agitation of the slavery question,which
has been so long and wantonly persisted in by
Northern men, has produced the sectional
alienation which is about to find ita natural
result in the destruction of a Confederacy that
was voluntary iv ita origin, and eaa only be
perpetuated by the voluntary assent of ita
members. When that amity, which ia gener
ally found to exist even between nauona for
eign to each other, ceases to exist between con
federated States ; when those comities, whioh
enlightened nations delight to extend to each
other, are refused to sister Statea by members
of a fraternal Confederacy ; when sectional
atrife and crimination usurp the place of char
ity and kindness in the hearts of a confed
erated people; when hatred and defamation
mark all the relations between neigbbora and
partner., then separation becomes not only
the natural and rightful, but the inevitable re
sort. The States ot the South, having the
right to secede, not only from the very nature
of a federal compact, but by express reserva
tion on the part ot some of them at the time of
eutering the Confederacy, are, in live or six
instances preparing to secede from their
Union with partner States which have con
verted the legislative branch of tbe Federal
Government into a mere theatre for agitating
the slavery question—into a rostrum from
which to pour forth over the world denuncia
tions and calumnies against their social Insti
tutions. Patrick Ileuty, one of the wisest
amongst the founders of free institution* in
this country, feared and predicted their over
throw by the agency of the Federal Govern
ment. It he could have foreseen the use which
oue section of tbe Confederacy would make ol
the House of Congress, ior assailiug the other
—employing entire sessions, to the neglect ol
nearly all other business, in the work of agi
tation—expending large sums of the public
money in the publication of incendiary de
bates, uud burdening the publi* malls in dis
tributing thousands of inflammatory speeches
over tbe laud, until the meie fact of the meet
ing of Congress is felt by a whole section as a
public calamity—he would uot only have re
sisted the establishment of the Federal Gov
ernment aa he did, but he would have defeated
it at the coat of precipitating the country into
a second revolution, before the echoes of the
first had died away.
There is no doubt that Mr. Lincoln was
elected by his party as "an extreme anti
slavery man.aud bitter opponent of the South."
The North has set the example of doing with
out the South in the election of a common
President. The South is about answering this
by allowing them lo do also without her in
the Union. The people acting ia mass will not
stop iv a crisis to draw distinctions and split
hairs, but rush headlong to extreme conclu
sions. The Southern peoples' answer to the
North will be as demonstrative and defiant, in
oue direction, aa tbe election of Mr. Lincoln,
on the pan of the North, was iv the other. If
all the Southern States shall put it to popu
lur vote, to say what shall be done in the pre
sent crisis, the position of probably every one
of them will beextreme. If a lew secede and all
efforts at reconciliation fail, all must sooner
or later secede. Virginia would not, other
border States could uot, stand neutral between
North and South.
For one, I am not for aeceaaiou as long as any
honorable effort can be made to preserve the
Union on a constitutional basis, guaranteeing
equality, justice and protection to the negro
property ef ihe South. 1 shall not undertake,
in this place, to particularize all the measures
or reform aud policy which should be incorpo
rated into a settlement of the preseut differ
ences between the North and the South. 1
cannot conceive how harmony can be perma
nently secured as long as Oongie_s continues
to be made a mere debating club for agitation
and incendiary appeal. The acts of the several
Northern States, nullifying the fugitive slave
law, being subversive of the Constitution, vio
lative of the plighted faith ot confederates, aud
in conflict with the comity of States, ought to
be repealed ; and an amendment to the Consti
tution must forever prevent their re-enact
ment.
But even though the principles of a settle
ment of tbe present troubles could be agreed
upou, mere wouid be very great difficulty iv
procuring their early ratification by the people
of the two sections. The Northern mass.es
cannot be brought at once to recede from the
extreme and aggressive positions they have
assumed towards ihe South; while the South,
tired of broken compromises, aud smarting
from repeated and uever-eudingiusnli, will be
slow and loth to accede to new compacts.—
Moreover, every manifestation by ihe Sjuth
of a willingness to accept terms of reconcilia
tion, is at ouce construed by the North into a
proof of timidity, and made the occasion of
new insult and injury.
1 believe, however, that the great material
interests of the couutry demand a reconcilia
tion of tne sections, aud ihe preservation of
the Union; and I rely much upon the slew,
but certain, the silent, but poteutial influence
of this great agency to bring about a settle
ment of ourprest.it troubles. Tne main study
of all should be to prevent any collisiou be
tween the sections, and most especially the
shedding of the first drop of blood. If wecan
bul succeed in averting these calamities, the
great, practical, business interests ol the couu
try may, perchance, sooner or later, bnug
about a re-consiructiou of the Union and a
restoration of harmony between the sections.
It is earnestly to be hoped thai these great
iii teie.ts,aided by tbe disinterested prompt
ing* of a sincere patriotism, may rise in their
power and with potential authority requireof
the fanaticism of .the North to abandon au
agitation which must lead to certain and
swift destruction. If this shall be done, who
can doubt that a returuingsenseol confidence
will befell by the injured and exasperated
South, and that peace und the Union will be
restored.
The American people are eminently practi-'
cal in their temper aud judgment, and also in
their action, wbeu ibey can tie brought to de
liberate. Tbey must see that no iute.-e._i—not
one in the whole extent of the American con
tinent—can fail to be materially injured, and
some of them utterly annihilated, by a disso
lution of the Uaiou. If there is nothing in
the majestic power of our great Confederacy
that cau excite a feeling otjusi pride in the
hearts of our people—if cur self-interests have
ceased to value the solid advantages whicn ac
crue to all Irom the respect and protection
that follow our flag over the surface ot the
whole globe—surely the desolation and raitery
which ihe dullest apprehension must see will
tollow iv the track of civil war, and the con
tempt which such an event will tie certain to
excite for us in the tniud of all Europe, ought
al laaal to prompt to a careful and wise delib
eration before a feud is commenced whicu
shall become irreconcilable.
The South should remember, that in dis
solving the Uuion she an miniates a mighty
army of true, unselfish and devoted friends at
the North, who battle forever for the consti
tutional rights of the slave States. Without
this great and etUcient aid, the power cf aboli
tion fanaticism would be unbroken aud un
checked—would indeed ''surround the South
with a wall of tire." It would do more. New
England would consort with Old England iv
devising means by which the cruel and inhu
man philanthropy practiced by the latter in
the West India islands should be repeated
here. That religious zeal which turned away
from all rational hope of progress iv Christian '
faith half a million of Africans to the savage
ism of f>uiah worship, aad converted tbe lair
eat island* of the sea into a desert aud waste
that English justice which seized upou a thou
sand millions of ber subjects' property aud
vaunted herself before the world for having
paid one-tenth of its value—would find surely
and speedily ample room, in conjunction with
New England abolitionism, for the practiceof
her phansaical virtues amidst the fields of
Virginia aud Louisiana. If the hate of New
England abolitionists to the South v sleepless
aud malignant—if ihey hope by fraud and in
direction, by agitation aud theft, to harass the
South and to impair tbe security and value of
her slave property—all combined would, in
my belief, be justice, honesty aud fair dealing
compared wiih the inexorable hate and ma
jestic fanaticism of England directed against
the slavery of a dismembered Union uud a
ten red and hated commercial rival.
Tweuty-flve years more of Union and har
mony will concentrate the controlling com
mercial power of the world iv the waters of
New York. Then, the decline of England be
comes as certain a* waa that of Alexandria
aad Venice, and for the same cans*. Instead
of tbe hi»t, she becomes a third rate European
power. But let disunion take place—let civil
war and discord distract this country, aad

enough to aupply ber wanta for cotton, even
with a large ti.minution of our present produc
tion—if tbe demand of the North for it ia cnt
off, as it would be by disasioß and civil war.
But England, safe ia her commercial ascen
dancy, dees not always folio tr tbat Hoe of
policy which others might think conducive
to ber interest. She sacrifices ranch and large
ly to gratify a hatred, to vindicate a blunder,
or cater to a sentiment. Without caring much
about the opinions of others, ahe values very
highly her own, and with a laudable desire to
appear righteous ia her own eyes, perpetrates
aLy act of cruelty or oppression, under the
pioos pretence of evangelizing ami civilizing
the heathen, or reforming the heresies of the
Chriatian. She ravages Chife because they
unwittingly brutalize their nation by eating
opium. She desolatea India because ihat be
nighted people are averse to rendering up their
independence and their rupeea in exchaegefor
Bibles and acrushingmilitary despotiam. But
it is not the Mongol or Tartar race alone that
experience the tender merclea of England in en
forcing the blessings ot liberty and tbe saving
grace of the Thirty-Nine Articles. It is in vain
tbat Ireland points to the tUuetrioua pages of
history—English history—enacted by her aona.
It is in vain that the moat renowned periods
of her senatorial fame have drawn their pe
culiar lustre from the genius of Ireland, or
that ihe topmoat rounds of her military cele
brity have been reached under the leadership
of the same race; neither ot these conaideia
tlons, nor all combined, have been able toaave
that unfortunate nation from a perpetual im
palement, compared with whicb the worst
forms ot African slavery are mercy and a
blessing. A tew years ago, only a few years
ago, England, with her mighty resource*, with
tbat empire upon which the eun iv hia daily
ceurse, it is boasted, never ceases to slime,
stood a calm spectator from her own happy
shores and looked with Christian complacency
across the Irish Channel at the torture of their
people writhing in the agony oi starvation ; a
million of whom, it is computed, died from
iatnine, and its accompanying diseases. Dur
ing this period English philanthropy louud
emissaries and means euon_h to dispatch to
America for the purpose of stirring up the
spiritof abolitionism, to overthrow the Union,
aud iucite the negro to insurrection. The
shrieks of famishing multitudes of her own
subjects nave never pierced the heart of Eng
land like the fancied wrongs of the African
race in the cotton fields ol the South—though
it may bo truly asserted that no slave haa
ever died of starvation on our continent.
The South can never count upon the friend
ahip of England, or upon her toleration of
evila uot her own. Once within the reach of
her power, she will fix upon us forever the
very badge of inferiority which we are now
ready to destroy the Uniou to escape; aud
will foster our productß so far, and so far only,
as may be absolutely necessary to supply her
wants. England would iusist upon making
good her record upon the slavery question.—
To sacrifice the interests of a class, or even to
atarve to death a few hundred thousands ot
heraubjects in the laudable task, would cob
alitute a very small obstacle to her policy.
But with all these cousequencea attending
the measure of disunion,and multitudinous
others, which readily occur to every mind, no
option is left now but, either to choose to en
counter them or to secure those guarantees
which must stop at ence and forever the ag
gresaiona and agitation to which the North
haa been ao long addicted, on the aubject of
slavery. With proper guarantees of thisaort,
which could be given by amendments to the
Constitution, we may go on In a happy and
cordial Union, made so from a mutuality of
pecuniary interests.andacorisciouaness which
union will give us of power to maiuiaiu all
our rights and .omnia, d tbe respect of the
world.
1 am of opinion that the Legislature of Vir

When tho House Committee of thirty.three
comes to consider that part of the President's
Message which recommends an amendment of
the Constitution, aud the recognition of tbe
right of slavery io protection in the Territo
ries, there will be a hitch. Protection was
the issue of the canvass jnst closed. The Re
publican* will not give up what they have
wou.
The vote in tbe Georgia Legislature against
secession, is thought significant, but that Ala
bama aud Mississippi will secede there seems
to be no doubt at all.
Clingoaan's attitude in his speech of yester
day and Rust's (of Arkansas) sudden recanta
tion,show which way the wind blows. Strange
to say, people here begin to believe disunion
will redound to tbe advantage of the South —
A Northern mau of sense said to me this
morning, "Dissolve on the Mason and Dixon's
line, and in two years we will all be as well
off as ever."
Two hundred men are enlisted here for
South Carolina, most of them clerk*. lam
told there are hot secessionists, members of
C-.ugre.s, from Southern Illinois. They say
they will split the Slate and go with the
South. It is well understood that Washing
ton will be the capital ot the Southern Con
federacy, lv case we all go out. aa we must do
iv tbe end. Montgomery, Ala., has beeu
spoken of, but the holding of the old capital
will give us prestige abroad, as if we held the
battleground. England is expected to medi
ate for a peacelul separation. Any serious
diminution of the cotton crop, such aa would
result from civil war in this country, would
ruin England.
i Senator Hunter regards Mr. Pryor as his

Virginia was to be dragged or coerced into
disuuiou. Rather than see Virginia ao de
graded aa to follow where South Carolina '.
might choose to lead, he would see her J
atandlng solitary and alone with but a single «
star upon her Hag. South Carolina had a I
right to go if she wished, and be would op
pose the march of the mercenaries of Massa- f

rest her progress. But he thoroughly opposed c
the secession of Virginia as long asshecould «

party here, and bade them welcome. He hoped 1
that here the corner-atone would be laid for
building up a great Uniou party in Virginia,
which would crush under its heel the dis
union party. He was glad to hear so strong ]
an expression of Union from geutlemen prea- '
cut, aud agreed with them except in one or J
two positions. He wished South Carolina '
could go out and stay out, for she had acted as !
a ttoinmon brawler for the last thirty years.— !
[Applause] But he opposed her right to do
so. It was because there waa a compact—a
tree and voluntary compact—between the
Suites, binding themselves to it, tbat it can be '
eulorced. If the compact bad been forced
upon tbem, then they would have had the
right to throw it off. He did not despair of
the Union. Souih Carolina had declared her
self out of the Union before, but the Union
w_s not di.rtolved. There were conservative
men at tbe North, aa well as at the South. If
moderate counsel.' prevailed, he fuliy believed
that the obnoxious laws at tbe North wouid
be repealed. It could not be done iv a mo
ment, but he believed it wonld be done.—
He had xetiuble intelligence, which would
have been published long ago if he had a chan
nel of communication with the public, assur
ing him that Mr. Lincoln waa an old Hue
Whig, and would administer the Government
upon the principles of Henry Clay. There
waa power enough ln Corgress aud in the
conaervatism oi the country to atop tbe im
pending storm, If it were properly exercised
He believed Cougresa could pasa a law reliev
ing the Fugitive Slave law of those obnoxious '
features to whicb he had alluded io alt hia
speeches, and making it a felony of tbe high- '
est grade to rescue a fugitive slave from ihe
bauds of officers—and Congress assuming tbe
responsibility of paying forevery slave ao rea
cued, aud holding it as a charge against ihe
State in which such rescue wa* effected—and
it would satisfy all the South except SjuUi
Carolina. [Applause] Mr. Botta commented
with some severity upon the President's Mea
sage. He thought it an absurdity lor tbe Presi
dent to cay that he could not execute the law
in South Carolina, becanae therewaano Judge
and no Marshal. If the Constitution aud the
lawaoonld not be upheld without force, he
was iv favor of using free. _rcc. If such a condi
tion of affaira exiated in the Nortb, force
would be used, and he was oppoaad toany dia
crlmination between eectlona. He approved
the proposition for a Convention of ihe bor
der Staiea, but opposed, utterly, a Southern
Convention, where the door would be opened
to such fire-eaters aa would be sent from the
cotton Statea. Ilesaw no great good to result
from a National Convention j aud in the prea
eut excited state of the public mind be was
totally opposed to a State Couvenuon, for it
would be a Democratic Couvenuon, aud it
would not be aaie to confide to auch a body
the great interests involved. Be implored ihe
Union men to set their facea againat it, and
agaiust the assembling of a Democratic Na
tional Convention.
