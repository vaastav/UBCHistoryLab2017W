President's
I
Message
Probably no presidential mess
age in recent years has attracted
more interest than President
Wilson's message. The recomm
endation of President Wilson
touching the nomination of
candidates for the presidency by
a primary law that will apply to
all the states, is of special interest,
and sentiment is divided.
Congressmen French in speak
ing ol the subject said: "1 am
heartily in favor of carrying out
this recommendation of the Pre
sident and for a long time I have
stood for this manner of nomin
ating our Presidents. If the
people generally may well have
the responsibility ofelecting their
President, why not assume the
responsibility of nominating him.

I Pres. Wilson Should
[Throw these Crim-j
inalsinto Jail at once
The innate cussedness and per
verse wickedness of human
nature is again revealed in the
following dispatch of the Asso
ciated Press:
Chicago, Nov. 17—The an
nual meeting of beet sugar
manufacturers was held here
to day and new officers elected
for 1914.
will be the last to be marketed,
it was said, as beet sugar will
be unablp to compete wirh
free cane sugar after 1916.
One hundred million dollars in
vested in beet sugar factories,
according to one delegate, will
be forced to find new employ
ment within a year.
President Wilson, Secretary
Bryan, and the balance of them
should lose no time in bringing
these beet sugar criminals to jus
tice. Early in the present game
it was announced that any man
ufacturer who went out of bus
iness or cut wages and pretend
ed that it was on account of the
Tariff legislation might expect
tobe landed in jail. What bus
iness had any owner of an in
Next year's crop
dustry to pretend that he knew
more about the effects of the
Tariff on that industry than
Prof. Wilson? Clearly none at
all. And if any such undertook
to pretend that they did—why,
they could see how they liked ly
ing in jail, that's all.
The case of the beet sugar
people is a good one ol which to
make an example. They have
something like a hundred million
dollars invested m the factories,
practically all of it in machinery
which is good for no other pur
pose. They say they will find it
impossible after the next crop to
compete with the cane sugar
imported by the Sugar Trust, so
they will have to scrap their
hundred millions worth of mach
inery and go into some other
line of industry. The 40,000
farmers who have been growing
sugar beets at a fair profit will
also go to doing something else.
Perhaps a few weeks in jail
wouldn't hurt them either.
We certainly trust Prof. Wilson
will lose no time in going after
these malefactors and putting
them all where they belong,
Go to it Woodrow.

Working of
Co. Prisoners
on Roads
Some time ago, Don Bennett
and J. B. Coburn were ordered
to work on the roads to serve
out their sentence and refusing
to do so, were closely confined
and put on a bread and water
diet. They sued out a writ of
habeas courpes, and finally the
case reached the Supreme Court
of the state; ane on a technicali
ty, the court decided that the
prisoners could not be made to
work on the roads or condemcn
ed to the unusual bread and
water diet because their sentence
of a fine did not admit of such
construction.
Persons confined oftbe County
[ail under a judgment of impri
sonment rendered in a criminal
action may be required by order
of the county commissioners to
labor on public works or public
roads of the county.
If a defendant is fined, and is
confined in jail until the fine is
paid, such a judgment is not a
judgment of imprisonment, and
so cannot be worked out undei
the law.
So Coburn and Bennett
back to the jail at Albion and
kept there in idleness.
Such is the law and so here
after, judges and justices must
be cautious in imposing judg
ments to specify whether they
are strictly fines or imprison
ment.
The County
appear to have acted in good
faith; and with an eye single to
the welfare of the county.
It is the consensees of opinion
that our laws should be amend
ed that those needs as convicted
prisoners should be % made to
labor for the public.
The jail should not be a club
and lazzvman's paradise. The
taxpayers have to work to earn
their living; and we cannot
why law brakers should not
have to work for the County
during the term of their incar
nation.

Give Home
Merchants A
Chance
Honest Injun'—now don't get
angry but just listen a moment
Don't think because
to your home merchants first,
that we have no -interest in you
farmers and labores and that
are taking sides with the merch
ants as against the consumers
in this valley, for such is not the
case. But you know we all get
tunny sometimes and suspicion
that so and so is trying to do us
and all that sort of thing.
The holidays are approaching
and everbody is thinking about
buying something. And while
this has been a prosperous year
every one is anxious that his
dollar cover a multitude of
things, and accordingly sets out
to locate bargains. Montgom
ery, Sears KoeBuck. National
Cloak and many other catalo.
gues are consulted, and after
reading a lot of dope about the
quality, color, stile, price and
etc., a great many make out an
order and send it off without
even investigating what the
local merchants isoffering. And,
it very often happens that
larger price is paid to some of
these houses than the article
would cost light here at home.
Now then, if your home merch
ant can sell you goods as cheap
as you can buy them from east
ern mail order houses, why not
leave your money at home? Of
we say, go
we
a
course you will immediately say
"They won't do it.
We reply,
"will you give them a chance
before placing your order else
where?'
Walk into the store
and state your business and that
you propose to pay the cash,
and compare the goods and
prices with mail order house and
prices, and sec where you get off
after paying
charges,
satished,
cart wheels to Chicago and no
body has any kick coming.
Do you kown kind reader that
the merchants of Oakley are big
tax payers. Deduct this from
the assessment roll and add it to
the balance of the taxpayers and
where do you get off at? When
the churches give an entertain
ment, who is one of the first to
buy a ticket? When you are
after subscriptions for the sick or
needy, who heads the list?
When you, or some member of
your family, is sick and your pay
check won't reach around, who
gives you credit? The home mer
chant is the target for every
move made for the advancement
of some local scheme and for
benefit propositions. Does he
complain very often?
Another thing—did y'ou ever
stop to think wdiat a conveni
ence it is to havs a full line of
transportation
If you are not then
send your big silver
good retail stores at home in our
communities? It enables people
to see what they are paying tor
and then you get your goods
when you want them. You can
take all the time you want to
talk over your purchases and in
spect goods.
It is the good fortune of the
citizens of Oakley to have a line
of finely equipped and attract
;' ve '- v stocked retail stores. If
I every dollar possible
was spent
at home, tbesestores could grow
faster, put in fuller assortments,
employ more clerks,
way they would contribute to
the conveniences of every resid
ent, and add to the prosperity of
every property holder. Think it
