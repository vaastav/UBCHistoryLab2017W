AFTER BEING HEMMED IN

markable of Campaign.
POPE URGES TRUCE.
Rome, Dec. 7.—Pope Benedict
is urging an understanding be­
tween the warring factions under
which a truce will be possible dur­
ing the Christmas holiday.
'London, Dec. i.—After a long bat­
tle, fought with great stubbornness,
the Germans have succeeded in occti-(
pying Lodz, Poland, which is an tin
fortified city. According: to a Berlin
report, the Russians suffered severe
losses and are retreating. This suc­
cess of the Germans, largely oecause
of what preceded it, is considered by
military experts as a really remarka­
ble achievement. Less than a fort­
night ago the army to which this vic­
tory has fallen was surrounded by the
Russians and cut its way out only
at the last moment, losing great num­
bers of men and guns.
Remarkable Feat.
Yet it was able within a few days
to reorganize, take the offensive and
defeat the Russians defending Lodz.
This was made possible by a network
of strategic railways on the German
side of the frontier, over which rein­
forcements were sent where they
were ni03t needed. Undoubtedly
there will be much more fighting
1'ore the campaign in this distrift"%
concluded.
Taking the Offensive.
Meantime, in taking advantage of
the preoccupation of the Germans in
the east, the allied French, Belgian
and British forces have^ begun an
offensive' movement in the Vest.
Trhey
virtually are in possession of the left
bank of the Yser canal, in northern
France, and particularly in the, neigh­
borhood of Labassee, where the Ger­
mans hold a very strong position and
the allies are beginning with a heavy
cannonade to feel their way east­
ward.
The same process is being followed
along the whole front. The French
officials speak of "superiority of our
offensive" and "marked advantage" of
the French artillery over the Ger­
mans." King Peter of Servia, ill for
many months, ha3 assumed command
of the Servian army, according t.o
a Nish report, and checked the ad­
vance of the Austrians, inflicting
heavy losses 011 them.
NOT DECIDED.
Vienna, Dec. 7.—lit was officially an­
nounced that fighting in the Russian
war theater is not yet decisive. In
West Galicia important battles are
proceeding, ibut no result is reported.
The Austro^German troops captured
1,500 Russiansi.an that territory Sun­
day. Iiv the Carpathians battles con­
tinue, and from some points the ene­
my has withdrawn strong forces he
hind the. mountains.
London, Petrograd, Dec. 7.—A Pet
rograd dispatch says: "The Bourse
Gazette estimates that the Germans
have lost 100,000 men in the month's
operations in the Lodz region."
HEAVY MLE RAGES

Philadelphia, Pa., Oec. 7.—A north­
easterly storm which has been blow­
ing along the Atlantic coast since
Saturday, continued tonight with un­
abated fury. Here nearly three-half
inches of rain had fallen by midnight
while reports from Atlantic City,
Ocean City, Seabright, N. J., and oth­
er seaside points, told of heavy dam­
age by wind and tide to ocean front
.property. Shipping from here is
practically at a standstill and at Sea
bright several cottages have gone
and other damage, totaling $70,000.
BIG DAMAGE AT GOTHAM.
iNew York, Dec. 7.—Huge seas,
backed by a mighty tide, howling a,
northeast gale, battered the coasts of
New York, smashing resorts, wreck­
ing boats, flooding villages, devastat­
ing summer resorts and forcing trans­
atlantic and coastwise 3teamers to
remain ousidd of Sandy Hook ana
fight the storm. The worst damage
in this vicinity is at Coney Island,
where the loss within the 24- hours
past is estimated at $200,000. For
hours the ferries were forced to stop
making trLps.
SOLDIERS SING HYMNS.
Dunkirk, Dec. 7.—The British sol­
diers' repertoire of marching songs
includes two hymns which share top
notch popularity with the "Mar3ei
laise" and "Tipperary." They are,
"Onward Christian Soldiers" and "Oh,
Come All Ye Faithful." The one thing
which, the soldier at the front de­
mands in a song is marching rhythm.
