examined and that of the 'deceased,
and of the deceased with the

the prisoner. The district attorney said in
anon an event he would take other steps. The
court adjourned amid great excitement

CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS.
MONDAY, PEC. 5.
Senate.—The senate met at noon. Bills were
introduced for the appointment of a tariff com­
mission to place General Grant on the retired
list of the army: by Mr. Sherman, a 3 per
cent funding bill also a resolution regarding
royalties on patents.
All the senators were present except Jones of
Nevada. Mr. Hill of Georgia had so far re­
covered from the late operation on his tongue
that there does not seem to be muoh more inco­
herence in his speech than uaual. Tbe senate
ktoka lonesome with its great lights gone, and
the facts of Conkling, Blaino and Carpenter
are aadly missed. Logan, Wiudom, Sherman,
Kellogg, Anthony, Morrill and Ferry are the
oldest and most familiar tigurea just now.
HOUSE—All the republican oaucus nominees
including speaker Keifer, were elected and
sworn in, as were all the members of the house
except the two absentees. Mr. Keifer made a
little speech on assuming the chair, in which
he suggested that the preaent ia an auspicious
time to enact laws to guard against recurrence
or dangers to our institutions and insure tran­
quility at perilous times in the future.
Objections were made to sev­
eral members taking the oath
of office, but they were withdrawn
One incident occurrod which threw the house
into convulsions of laughter. Mr. Moore
(rep.) of Tennessee, is anew member, young,
enthusiastic, deeply impressed with the pro­
found responsibilities of a representative in
congress, and anxious to win fame and distinc­
tion. An old member would regard Mr. Moore
as simply afresh young man.
When Chalmers, of the Mississippi "shoe
sing" disttrriot, was called up to be sworn in,
Mr. Moore objected. Chalmers' seat is con­
tested and if the rules did not require the oom
mittee on elections to dispose of his case, the
house would assuredly have been warranted in
refusing him admittance. Mr. Moore, how­
ever, did not content himself with entering a
simple objection which would have seived
every purpose but he had to make a spread
eagle speech, protesting in the name of justice,
of law, and of humanity against
Chalmers being administered the oath.
When Mr. Moore, aa to whose title to
a seat no question exists, came forward
to be sworn, Mr. Btagg of Wisconsin arose, and
with great solemnily protested in tne name of
law, of justice and of Casey Young, Mr.
Moore's democratic predecessor, against tbe
swearing in of Moore. The republicans and
democrats alike shouted and screamed with
laughtor, and Mr. Moore, not at all abashed,
joined in the fun. Finally, all the members
against whose admission objection had been
made were sworn in. This was
all the business
done on Monday.
A Railroad Pool.
Mr. E. P. Alexander, vice president of
the Louisville and Nashville railroad, in a
recent argument before a committee of the
Alabama legislature, gave the following ex­
planation of a pool, as it is understood by
railroad men:
"A pool is really an agreement between
competin: lines at any given point about to
this effect That if all will agree to maintain
the equal rates, which have been generally
arrived at by long struggles between the
competing markka, in which eaoh has' had
all the benefit onts geographical position
and advantages, than any line "which does
an excess of business, above the average of
former yeoTS, and above what would seem
its natural share of the basines, shall com­
pensate the line which is deficient in some
satisfactory manner. It is hard to explain
how such an effort to prevent discrimina­
tions and flunctuations should become so
generally misunderstood.
"No man can study the railroad problem
intimately without becoming convinced
that by far the greatest good of the greatest
number would result from what the rail­
road managers attempt in their pools.
The misrepresentation of their policy and
efforts doubtless come from individuals
who had been able to turn railroad wars to
their individual advantage. In such wars
large shippers always have an advantage
over small ones. Their business is sought
by rebates and private concessions, while
small shippers are disregarded. The large
shippers in those markets where railroad
wars have been common are therefore
often
loth to see any arrangement by which rates
will be maintained, however low those
rates may be. In fact, large shippers sel­
dom care a straw whether rates are low or
high their profits for the handling are the
same in any case. Their whole care is to
secure rates for their markets lower
than for those for competing narkets,
or rates for themselves lower than
their neighbors. The large ship­
pers, too, are men of infla^noe and ability,
and it is they who usually cry out against
the pool. So the position of the railroad
managers is that between the upper and the
nether millstone. The public cry out, and
justly, against fluctuations, rebates and un­
just discriminations. There is no power
on earth to prevent fluctuations, rebates and
unjust discriminations but to remove the
temptation to commit them. The only way
to remove the temptation is to make some
arrangement equivalent to what is called a
pool but against the pool, the lawe ship­
pers have an especial antipathy. The pool
outs off their rebates and special rates. No
law could cut them off, because they can
always be made by some part of the line
which lies out of the state, so that state law
can never reach it. And even a general
law by congress can be evaded in a hundred
ways.
"There have doubtless been complaints
of the wrongs made by pools, but these
complaints are universally that the rates
are not positively high, but only compar­
atively high,, as contrasted with the rates
from some other places.
"Questions of this sort are of the great­
est delicacy and difficulty of adjustment.
The twelve apostles themselves oould
probably never give satisfaction if they had
to adjust the rates between twelve com­
peting markets. It is in fact, to my mind,
rather a doubtful question whether there is
any such thing as justice in settling such
a question. To illustrate by an example
away from home, in which none of us have
any enterest or Feeling.
"Boston, for instance, is farther {rom
Chicago than New York is. Now, should
the principle ever be adopted of miriring all
rates a pro rata per mile, the rate from
Chicago to Boston would be so muoh high­
er than the rate from Chicaga to New York
that all the foreign trade now poing through
the former jort would be diverted to the
latter. This, of coarse.would be an enor­
mous injury to every interest of Boston.
In fact, no such principle ever could be en­
forced, for the lines injuriously affected bv
it would never submit to it, but would work
at rates far below the cost of transportation
for years rather than give up their through
business forever.
"But whatever criticisms may be made
jipon either the purposes of the railroad
pools, or upon the practicable operations
which have taken place under them at any
point, they have been resorted to by the
railroad managers as the only solution
which their experience in these matters has
been able to suggest and thai any imper­
fections or abuses have been the result of
neither carelessness nor indifference, but
of the inherent difficulties of the problem
itself.
"And as an earnest of their honest intent
to correct the abuses, and to arive at just
and fair solutions of questions between
conflicting interests, the principal of arbi­
tration of such questions, by the most dis­
interested and competent tribunals obtain­
able, is universally recognized and adopted
and if either the state or the national gov­
ernments would provide such tribunals the
railroad managers would be only to glad to
avail themselves of their service#."

ested in a supreme court ieciaiot), first rendered

National Loss and a Tri­
bute to Garfield.

Operations of the Various
Departments of the

THK LATE PRESIDENT.
A FEELINO TBIBUTE.
To the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States: An appalling calamity
has bofallen the American people since there
chosen representatives last met in the halls
where you are now assembled. We might else
recall with unallayed content the prosperity
with which throughout the year the nation has
been blessed. Its harvests have been plenteous,
its varied industries have thriven, the hoalth
of its people has been preserved. It has
maintained with foreign governmenta the un­
disturbed relations of peace. For these
manifestationa of hia favor we owe
him who holds our destiny in his handa the
tribute of our grateful devotion. To that
mysterious exercise of will which has taken
from us the loved and illustrious citizen who
was but lately the head of the nation, wo bow
in sorrow and submission. The memory of
his exalted character, of his noblo achieve­
ments and of hia patriotic life will be troasurod
forever as a sacred possession of tho whole
people. The announcement of his death drew
from foreign governments and peoples tributes
of sympathy and aorrow which history will re­
cord as signal tokens of tbe friendship of na­
tions and the federation of mankind.
rOllF.lGN RELATION'S.
MAINLY PEACEFUL.
The feeling of good will between our own
government and that of Great Britain was
never more marked than at present In recog­
nition of this pleasing fact, I dirocted, on the
occasion of the late centennial celebration at
Yorktown, that a salute be given the British
flag. Aside from the correspondence, to which
I shall refer hereafter, in relation to the pro­
posed canal across the isthmus of Panama,
little has occurred worthy of mention in the
diplomatic relations of the country. Early in the
year the Fortune bay claims were satisfactor­
ily settled by the British government paying
in the full the sum of £15,000, most of which
haa already been diatributed. As the torma of
aettlement included compensation for injuries
Buffered by our fishermen at Ashell bay, there
has been retained from the gross award a sum
which ia deemed adequate for these claima.
The participation of Americana in the exhibi
tiona at Melbourne and Sydney will be approv­
ingly mentioned in the reports of the two ex^
hibitions soon to be presented to congress.
They will disclose tbe readiness of our couutry
to make successful competition in distant fields
of enterprise. Negotiations for an internation­
al copyright convention are in hopeful prog­
ress. The surrender of Sitting Bull and
his force upon the Canadian frontier
has allayed all apprehension, although bodies
of British Indians still cross the border in
quest of sustenance. Upon this snbject a cor­
respondence has been opened, which promises
au adequate understanding. Ou troops have
orders to avoid, meanwhile, all collisions with
these Indians. The presence at Yorktown of
representatives of the repubho of France,
descendants of Lafayette and his gallant com­
patriots, who were our alliea in the revolution,
haa served to strengthen the spirit of good will
which has always existed between the two na­
tions. You will be furnished with the proceed­
ings of
THE BIMETALIC CONFERENCE,
held during the summer at the city of Paris.
No record was reached, but a valuable inter­
change of views was had, and tbe conference
will next year be renewed. At the electrical
exhibition and congress, also held at Paris, the
country waa creditably represented by eminent
specialists, who, in the absence of an appro­
priation, generally lent their oflicient aid at the
instance of the state department While our
exhibitions in this almost distinctively Amor
can field of achievement have won several
awards, I recommend thai congress provide
for tne repayment of the personal expenses in­
curred in the public interest by the
honorary commissioners and delegates.
No new questiona respecting the status
of our naturalized citizens in Germany have
arisen during the year, and causes of com­
plaint, especially in Alsace and Lorraine, have
practically ceased, through the liberal action
of the imperia government in accepting our
often expressed views on the aubject The
application of the treaty of 1868 to the lately
acquired Bhenish province has reoeived very
earnest attention, and a definite and lasting
agreement on this point is confidently
expected. The participation of tbe descend­
ants of Baron Von Steuben in the Yorktown
festivities and their subsequent reception by
their American kinsmen strikingly evinced tho
good will which unite German people and our
own. Our intercourse with Spain has been
friendly. An agreement concluded in Peb
uary last fixes a term for the labors for the
Spanish and American claima commission.
The Spaniah government baa been requested
to pay the late awards of the commission, and
will, it is believed, accede to the request as
promptly aa on a former occasion.
By recent leg­
islation onerous fines have been imposed upon
American shipping in Spanish and colonial
ports for slight irregularities in manifest One
case of hardship ia apecially worthy of atten­
tion. The bark Mazonica, Dound for Japan,
entered Manilla in diatress and is there sought
to be confiscated under tho Spanish revenue
laws for an alleged shortagein her transhipped
cargo. Though efforta for her relief have thus
far proved unavailing, it is expected that the
whole matter will be adjusted in a friendly
manner.
SYMPATHY WITH BUSSIA.
The resolutions of condolence on the assas­
sination of the Czar Alexander were appropri­
ately communicated to the Russian govern­
ment, which in turn has expressed its sympa­
thy in our late bereavement It is desirable
that our cordial relations with Bussia should
be strengthened by proper engagements assur­
ing to peaceable American citizens who visit the
empire the consideration which is due to them
aa citizena of a friendly state. This is especially
needful with respect to American Israelites,
whose classification with the Baltic Hebrews
has evoked energetic remonstrances from
this government A consular agreement with
Italy has been sanctioned and ^proclaimed,
which puts at rest conflict of jurisdiction in
the case of Crimea on shipboard. Several im­
portant
Cra**5aCfOHAI CONFERENCES
have been held in Italy during the year. At
the geographical oongress of .Venice, the Boni­
face congreaa of Milan, and at the Nice con­
gress of Turin, this country waa represented
by delegates of branches of tbe public aervice,
or by private citizena duly accredited in an
honorary capacity. It ia hoped that congress
will give such prominence to their participa­
tion as they may seem to deeerve. The
abolition of all discriminating duties
against Dutch colonial productions of
the Dutch East Indies as are imported
there from Holland has been already consid­
ered by congress. I trust that at the present
session the matter will be favorably concluded.
Th3 insecurity of life and property in many
parts of Turkey has given rise to correspond­
ence with the porte relating particularly to the
better protection of American missionaries in
the empire. The condemned murderer of the
eminent missionary. Dr. Justin W. Parsons,
has not yet been executed, although the gov­
ernment has repeatedly demanded that ex­
emplary justice be dona.
I
the co-operation of tbe commis­
sioners of emigration at New York, have been
sent back by the steamers whioh brought
them., A continuance of this (bourse piay
prove a mora effective remedy
than diplomatic remonstranoe. Trea­
ties of oommerce and navigation
and for the regulation of consular privileges
have been oonoluded with Boumania and Per
via since thoir admission into the family ot
European nations. As is natural with con­
tiguous states which have like institutions
and like aims of advancement and develop­
ment, tbe friendship of tbe United States and
Mexico has been consistently maintained.
The government baa lost- no occasion of en­
couraging the Mexican government to a
beneficial realization of the mutual ad­
vantages which will 'result for
moro intimate commercial intercourse
and from tho opening of the rich interior of
Mexico to railway enterprise. I deem it im­
portant that means be provided to restrain the
lawlessness unfortunately so common, and to
suppress the forays of the reservation Indiana
on either aide of tho ltio Grande. The ceigh
boring states of Central America have pre­
served internal peace, and their outward rela­
tions towards the Uuited States have been
those of intimate friendship. Those are en­
couraging signs of thoir growing disposition
to subordinate thoir local interests to
those which are common to them
hy reason of their geographical relations. The
boundary disputo between Guatemala and
Mexico has furnished this government the op­
portunity to exercise its good offices by pre­
venting a rupture between those states and
for procuring a peaceful solution of the ques­
tion. The Casta ltiea government lately formed
an engagement with Colombia for settling by
arbitration the boundary question between
those countries providing that the post of ar
bitrants be offered successively to the king
of the Belgians, the liing of Spain and the
president of tho Argentine soufederation. The
king of tbe Belgians haa declined to act, but I
am not as yet advisod of the action of the
king of Spain. As we havo certain ihteresta in
the disputed torritory which are protected by
treaty engagement with one of the partiea, it is
important that tho arbitration should not with­
out our consent affect our rights, and thia gov­
ernment has accordingly thought proper to
make its viewa known to the partiea to the
agreement, aa the quostiona growing out of
the proposed
INTEK-OCEANIC WATERWAY
acoBB the Isthmus of Pauama are of great na­
tional importance. This government has not
been unmindful of the solemn obligations im­
posed upon by its oompaot of 1840 with
Colombia as tho independent and sovereign
mistress of the torritory crossed by the canal,
and sought to render them effective by fresh
engagements with the Colombian republic,
looking to thoir practical execution.' The ne­
gotiations to this end after they had reached
what appeared to be a mutually satisfactory
solution here, were met in Colombia by
a disavowal of tbe powers which
its envoy bad assured and by a proposal for ne­
gotiation on a modified basis. Meanwhile this
government learnod that Colombia had pro­
posed to tbe European powers to join in a
(guarantee of the neutrality of the proposed
.Panama canal, a guarantee which would be in
direct contravention of our obligation as the
solo guarantee of tbe integrity of Columbian
Territory, and of the neutrality of the
canal itself. My lamented predecessor
felt it hie duty to place
before the European powers tbe
reasons which make the prior guarantee of
the United States indispensable and for which
the interjection of any foreign guarantee
might be regarded as a superfluous aud un­
friendly act Foreseeing the probable reliance
of the British government on the provisions of
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty of 1850, as afford­
ing room for a place in the guarantees which
the United States oonvenanted with Colombia
four years before, I have cot hesitated to sup­
plement the action of my predecessor by pro­
posing to her majesty's government the modifi­
cation of that instrument and the abrogation
of such clauses thereof as do not conflict with
obligations of the United States toward Colom­
bia or with the vital needs of the two friendly
parties to the comoact
CHILI AND PEItV.
This government sees with great concern
the continuance of the hostile relations be­
tween Chili and Peru. An early peace between
these republics is much to be desired, not only
that they may tliomselves be spared further
misery and bloodshed, but because their con­
tinued antagonism threatens consequences
which are, in my judgment, detrimental to the
interests of all the republican governments on
this continont an calculated to destroy the
host elements of our free and peaceful civiliza­
tion. As in the present excited condition of
popular feeling in these countries there
has been a serious misapprehension of the po­
sition of the United States, and as separate
diplomatic intercouse with each through inde­
pendent ministers ia at the same time a serious
subject, owing to the want of prompt recipro­
cal communication, to temporary misunder­
standing, I have deemed it judicious at the
present time to sond a special envoy, accred­
ited to all and each of them, and furnished
with general instructions which will enable
him to bring these powers into friendly rela­
tions.
VENEZUELA CLAIMS.
The government of Venezuela maintains its
attitude of warm friendship, and continues
with great regularity ita payment of tho month­
ly quota of the diplomatic debt Without sug­
gesting the direction in which congress shonid
act, I ask attention to pending quoatious affect­
ing the destination of the sums thus far re­
ceived. The relations between Venezuela and
France, growing out of the same debt, have
been for Bometime past in an unsatisfactor
state, and this government, as the neighbor
and one of tho largest creditors of Venezuela,
has interposed itsolf with tho French govern­
ment, with the view of producing a friendly
and honorable adjustment
COMMERCIAL INTERESTS WITH BRAZIL.
I regret that the commercial interest between
the United States and Brazil, from which great
advantages were hoped a year ago, have suf­
fered from withdrawal of American lines of
communication between Brazilian ports and
•our own.
Through tbe efforts of our minister resident
at Buenos Ayres ar»i tha United States minis­
ter at Santiago a treaty has been concluded be­
tween the Argentine Republic and Chili dispos­
ing of the long pending Patagonian boundary
question. It is a mattor of congratulation that
our government has been afforded the oppor­
tunity of successfully exerting its good influ­
ence for the prevention of disagreements be­
tween the republics of the American continent
TREATIES WITH CHINA.
I am glad to inform you that the treaties
lately negotiated with China have been duly
ratified on both sides and the exchange made
at Pekin. Legislation is necessary to call its
provisions into effect The prompt and
friendly manner in which tbe Chinese govern­
ment, at the request of the United States, con­
ceded tho modification of the treaties should
secure careful regard for tbe interests and
susceptibilities of that government in the en­
actment of any laws relating to Chinese immi­
gration. These classes of the treaties whioh
forbid the participation of citizens or vessels
of the Urtitod States in the opium trade will
doubtless receive your approval, and they will
attest the sincere interest of our people and
government in tbe commendable efforts of the
Chinese government to put a stop to this de­
moralizing and destructive traffic.
In relation both to China and Japan, some
changes are desirable in onr present system of
consular jurisdiction. I hope, at some future
-time, to lay before you a schema for its im­
provement in the entire east
RELATIONS WITH JAPAN.
The intimacy between our country and Japan,
the most advanced of the eastern nations, con­
tinues to be cordial I am advised that the
emperor contemplates the establishment of a
constitutional government, and that he has al­
ready summoned a parliamentary congress for
the purpose of effecting the changa Such a
remarkable steD toward complete assimilation
-with our western system cannot fail to bring
Japan to closer and more beneficial relation*
ship with ourselves as the chief pacific power.
A question has arisen in relation to the exer­
cise in that country of judicial functions car­
ried on by our minister and consuls. The
indictments, trial and conviction the consu­
lar court at Yokohama of John Boss, a mer­
chant seaman on' board an American vessel,
have made it necessary for the government to
institute a careful examination of the nature
and methods of this jurisdiction. It appears
that Boss was regularly shipped under
protection of the Uuited States, but was
by birth a British subject My predecessor
felt it his duty tp take the position that by his
service as a regular shipped seaman on board
an American merchant vesael Boss was snbject
to the laws of the service and to the juris­
diction of the United States consulate author-

HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.
The king of Hawaii, in tbe course of his
homeward return after a journey around the
world, has lately visited this ^country. While
onr relations with that kingdom are friendly,
this government has viewed with concern the
efforts to seek replenishment of the diminish­
ing population of the islands from outward
sources to a degree which ifeay impair the na­
tive sovereignty and independence in which
the United States was amofeg the first to testify

INTERNATIONAL BULES OF THE BOAD.
I invite your attention to the propriety of
adopting the new code of international rulea
for tbe prevention of oolliaions in the high
seas, and of conforming the domestic
legislation of the United States thereto,
ao that no confusion may arise from tbe
application .of conflicting rules in the case of
vessels of different nationalities meeting its
tidal waters. These international rules differ
but slightly from our own. They have been
adopted by the navy department for the gov­
ernance of the war ships of the United States
on the high seas and in foreign waters, and
in disseminating the rules and in acquainting
tbe shipmasters with the option of conforming
to them within the jurisdictional waters of the
United States, they are now very generally
known and obeyed.

FOREIGN COMMERCIAL BEPOBTS.
The state dopartment Btill continues to pub
lish to the country the trade and manufactur­
ing reports received from its officers abroad.
The success of this course warrants its con­
tinuance and such appropriation as may be re
auired to meet the rapidly increasing demand
for these publications with special reference to
the Atlanta cotton exposition, the October
number of the reports was devoted to a collec­
tion of papers on tho cotton goods trade of the
world.
THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE
for which, iu 1878, congress made provision,
assembled iu this city in July last, and its
sessions were prolonged until March,- although
it reached no specific conclusions affecting the
future action of the participant powers. The
interchange of views proved to ue most valu­
able. Tbe full protocols of the aessious have
been already presented to the senate.
INTERNATIONAL SANITARY REGULATIONS.
As pqrtiuent to this goneral subject, I will
call your attention to the operations of tbe
national board of health, established by act
of congress, approved Maroh 3, 1879.
Its sphere of duty was enlarged
by the act of Juue 22, in the same year. By
the last named act the board was required to
investigate snch measures as might be deemed
nocessary for preventing the introduction of
contagious or infections diseases from foreign
countries into the Uuited States or from one
State into anothor. Tbe execution of tho rules
and regulations prepared by the board aud ap­
proved by my predecessor haa done much to
arrest the progress of epidemio disease, and
has thus rendered substantial service to the
nation.
.THE INTERNATIONAL SANITARY CONFERENCE,
to which I have referred, adopted tbe form of
a bill of health to be used by all vessels seek­
ing to enter the ports of tha countries whose
represetatives participated in its deliberations.
This form has neen preserved by tbe national
board of health, and incorporated with its
rules and regulations, whioh have beeu ap­
proved by me in pursuance of law. Tbe health
of the people is oue of supreme importance,
and all measures looking to their preservation,
against the spread of contagious diseases, ana
to the inorease of our sanitary knowledge for
such purposes, deserve the attention of aon

SILVER.
In pursuance of the policy of tbe govern­
ment to maintain silver at or near the gold
standard' it was made receivable for all cus­
toms, taxes and publio dues. About $66,
000,000 of standard silver dollars are now
outstanding. They formed an unnecessary
addition to the paper ourrency, as tha current
amount which may readily be supplied by the
national banks is shown to be sufficient In ac­
cordance with the act of February 28, 1878,
tbe treasuiy department has monthly
caused at least $2,000,000 in valne of silver
bullion to be coined into standard dollars. One
hundred and two millions of these dollars have
been already coined, while only about $34,
000,000 are in circulation. For the reasons
wbiob he specifies, I concur in the secretary's
recommendation that the provision for coinage
of the specified amount each month be re­
pealed, aud that hereafter only so much be
coined as shall be necessary to supply the de­
mand.
GOLD CERTIFICATES.
The secretary advises tbat the issue of* gold
certificates
Bliould
not for the present be re­
sumed and suggests that the national banks may
be properly forbidden by law to retire their cur­
rency, except on reasonable notice of their in­
tention to do so. Such legislation wonld seem
to be justified by the reconstruction of certain
banks on the occasion referred to, in the
secretary's report Of the $15,000,000 of
fractional currency still outstand­
ing only about $80,000 has been
ledeemed the past year. The suggestion that
this amount may properly bo dropped from
future statements of the public debt seems
worthy of approval. So also does the sugges­
tion of the secretary as to the advisability of
relieving the calendar of the United States
courts in the southern district of New York by
tha transfer to another tribunal of the numer­
ous suits there pending against collectors.
THE REVENUE
from eustoms for the past fiscal year was
$198,159,676.OU an Increase of $11,637,
611.42 over that of tbe preoeding year
$138,098,562.39 of thia amount waa col­
lected at the port of New York, leaving $50,
S51.523.63 aa the amount collected at all the
other ports of the country. Of this sum
$47,977,137.63 waa collected on sugar and
molasses, $27,285,624.78 on wool and manu­
factures, $2,462,534.34 on iron and steel and
manufactures thereof, $19,038,665.81 on
manufactures of silk, $10,825,115.21
on manufactures of cotton, $6,469,
643.04 on wines and spirits, making the
total revenue from these sources
$133,058,720 81. Tbe expenses of collec­
tion for the past year have been $6,419,345.20,
an increase over the preceding year of $387,
410.04. Notwithstanding the increase in rev­
enue from customs over the previous year the
gross value of the imports, including free
goods decreased over $25,000,000. The
marked decrease was in tbe value of unmanu­
factured wool $14,023,682. and in that of
scrap and pig iron $12,810,671. The value
of imports on sugar, on the other hand, showed
an increase of $7,457,474, of steel rails $4.
345,521, of bar iron $2,154,204, and of steel
in bars, etc., $620,046.
Compared with the prations year, there waa
an increase of merchandise and a decrease of
$66,738,688 in the value of imports. The
annual average increase impora of mer-
chandise ever- exports thereof, for ten years
previous to June 30. 1873, *aa $1,488,922,
but for the last six years there has been an ex­
cess of exports over imports of merchandise
of $
1,180/868,103, an -annual aver­
age of $106,778,017. The specie
value of the exports of domestic
merchandise was $376,616,473 in 1870 and
$883,925,947 in 1881, an increase of $307,-.
309,474, or 135 per ceht. The value of im­
ports was $435,958,408 in 1870 and $642,
664,628 in 1881, an increase of $206,706,
220, or 47 per cent during each year. From
1862-te~1879,"inclusive,"the exports "of
specie exceeded the importa. The largeat ex­
cess of such exports over imports waB reached
during the year 1864, when it amounted to
$92,204,929, bnt during the vear ending
June 30, 1880, the imports of coin and tyillr
ion exceeded the exports by $75,801,391, and
during the last fiscal year the excess »f im­
ports over exports was $91,168,650.
4 REFUNDING.
In the last annual report of the secretary of
tbe treaaury tbe attention of congress waa called
to the fact that $469,651,050 in 5 per cen-"
turn bonds and $203,573,750 in 6 per contun^
bonds were to become redeemable during tliO^
year, and congress was asked to authorize tbe
refunding of these bonds at a lower rate of in­
terest The bill for such refunding having
failed to become a law, the secretary of thef
treasury in April last notified the holders of
tbe $195,690,400 6 per cent bonds then out­
standing, that tbe bonds would be paid at
par on tho first day of July follow­
ing, or that they might be continued.
at the pleasure of the government, to bear in­
terest at the rate of 3^2 per centum per an-1
num. Underthia notice $175,055,150 of the
6 per centum bonds wore continued at the
lower rate, and $17,632,250 redeemed. In
the month of May alike notice was given re­
specting the redemption or continuance of the
$439,841,300 of per cent, bonds then out­
standing of these $401,004,900 were con­
tinued at 3t per centum per aunum, and $38,
336,450 redeemed. The 6 per cont bonds
of the loan of February 8, 1861 and of the
Oregon war debt amounting together to $14,
121,500 haviug matured during the year tho
secretary of the treasury gave notioe of his in
tontiou to redeem the same, and Buch aa have
been presented bavo been paid from the sur-s
plus revenue. Thero liavo been also redeemed
at par $16,179,100 of the 3^2 per centum
continuod bonds, making a total of bonds re­
deemed or which have ceased to bear interest
during the year of $123,909,650.
THE PUBLIC DEBT.
The reduction of the annual interest on the
public debt through these transactions is as
follows:
By reduction ot interest to 3»2per
cent $10,473,952 27
By redemption ot bonds 6,352,340 00
Total.. $16,826,202 27
Tho t'j per centum bonds being payable at
the pleasure of the government are available
for investment of surplus revenue without the-'
payment of premiums. Unless these bonds can
be funded at a much lower rate of interest than
they now bear, I agree with tho secretary of the
treasury that no legislation respecting them is
desirable. ,,v
REDUCTION OF REVENUE.
It is a matter for congratulation that the busi­
ness of tbe country has been so prosperous dur­
ing tbe past year as to yield by taxation a large
surplus of income to the government If tbe
revenue laws remain unchanged, this surpluV
must, year by year, increase, on account of tbe
reduction of the public debt and its burden of
interest, aud because of the rapid increase of
our population. In 1860, just prior to the in­
stitution of our internal revenue ^system,
our population but slightly exceeded 30,
000,000. By the census of 1880 i
is now found to exceed 50,000,000.
It is estimated that even if tho annual receipts
aud expenditures should continue as at present,
the entire debt could be paid in ten vears. IK
view, however, of the heavy load of taxation
which our people have already borne, we may
well consider whether it is not the part of wis-,
dom to reduce the revenues, even if we delaV
a little the payment of tbe debt It seems to
me that the time has arrived when the people
may justly demand some relief from
their present enormous burden and
that by due economy in the various
branches of the publio service this may readily
bo afforded 1 therefore concur with the sec­
retary in recommending the abolition of all in
ternal revenue taxes except those upon tobac­
coin its various forms, and upon distilled
spirits aud fermented liquors, and except also
the special tax upon the manufacturers of and
dealers in snch articles. The retention of the
latter tax is desirable as affording the officers
of the government a proper supervision of
these articles for tho prevention of
frauds. I agree with the secretary
of the treasury that the law imposing a stamp
tax on matches, proprietary articles, playing
cards and drafts may with propriety be re-
Eankersund
ealcd, the law alBO by which batiks and
are assessed upon their capital and
deposits. There seems to be a general senti­
ment in favor of this course, and in tho present
condition of our revenues tho tax upon deposits
is especially' unjust It was never imposed in
this country until it was demanded by the
necessities of war, and never exacted, I be­
lieve, in any other country even
in its greatest exigencies. Bankers are
required to aecure their circulation by
pledging, with the treasurer of the United
States, bonds of tbe general government The
interost on these bonds, which at the time
was 6 per cent, is now in most instances 32
per cent, and besides, the entire circulation
was originallv limited by law, and no increaso
was allowable when the existing banks had
practically a monopoly of the business. ThorsQ $
was the suggestion that for the frauohise to
the favoring grantees the government might
very properly exact a tax on circulation. But
for years the system has been free and the
amount of circulation regulated by tho public
demaud. The retontion of thia tax haa beon
suggested as a means of reimbursing the gov­
ernment for the expense of printing and fur­
nishing the circulating notes. If the tax should
be repealed, it wonld certainly aeem proper to
require the national banks to pay the amount
of auch expense to the controller of the cur­
rency.
TAX ON LIQ.UOB AND TOBACCO.
It is perhaps doubtful whether the imme­
diate reduction of the scale of taxation upon
liquors and tobacco is advisable, eapecially in
view of the drain upon the treasury, which
must attend the pavment of arrears of pen­
sions. A comparison, however, of tbe
amount of taxes collected under
the varying rates of taxation which
have at different timea prevailed, suggests the
intimation that some reduction may soon be
made without crippling the revenue.
TAMFF REVISION. I.
The tariff laws also need revising, but that
a due regard may be paid to the conflicting in­
terests of our citizens, important changes
should be made with caution. If a careful re­
vision cannot be made at this session a commis­
sion such asw as lately approved by the sen­
ate and is now recommended by the secretary
of the treasury would doubtless lighten the la­
bors of congress whenever the subject shall
be brought to ita consideration.
ARMY AND NAVV.
THE WAB DEPABTKENT.
The accompanying report of the secretary of
war will make known the operations of that
department for the past year. He suggests
measures for promoting the efficiency of the
army by adding to the number of officers, and
recommends the legislation necessary to in­
crease the number of enlisted men
to 30,000, to the maximum al­
lowed by law. This be deems necessary
to preserve the peace and suppress disorders
ana marauding in new settlements, to protect
settlers and tneir property against Indians,
against the encroachments of intruders and to
enable immigrants to establish homes in the
most remote parts of our country. Tho army
is now necessarily scattered over such a vast
extent of territory that whenevor an outbreak,
occurs reinforcements must be hurried
from many quarters over a great
distance and at heavy cost for
transportation of men, horses, wagons and
supplies. I concur in the recommendations of
the secretary for increasing the army to the
strength of 30,000 enlisted men. It appears
by the secretary's report'that in the absence of
disturbances on the frontier tbe troops have
been actively employed in collecting Indiana
hitherto hoatile and locating them on their
proper reservations that Sitting Bull and his
adherents are now prisoners at Fort Randall
that the Utes hare been moved to their reser­
vation in Utah. During the recent
OUTBREAK OF THE APACHES
it was neceasarj to. reinforce the garrisons
In Arizona by troops withdrawn from New
Mexico. Some Apaches are now held prison­
ers for trial, while some have escaped, and the
majority of the tribe are now on the reserva­
tion. There ia need of legislation to prevent
intrusion upon the lands set apart for the In­
diana. A large military force at great expense
ia now required to patrol the boundary line
between Kansas and the Indian Territory. The
only punishment that can at present be
inflicted is the forcible removal of the intruder
and tbe imposition of a pecuniary fine which
in moat cases it is impossible to collect There
should be a penalty by imprisonment in snch'
cases. Tbe separate organization of the sig­
nal aervice ia urged by the secretary of war,
and a full statement of the advantages of such
permanent organization is presented in tbe re-
Fort
of the chief signal officer. A de­
tail of tha usual work performed
by the signal corps and the webtber
bureau ia also given in that
report I ask attention to tha statement of the
secretary of war regarding tbe requisitions
frequently made by tbe Indian bureau upon
the subsistence department of the army, for
the catual support of bands or tribes of In
diaas for which appropriations are exhausted.
Ilia war department should not be left by rea­
son of inadequate provisions for the Indian
bureau to contribute for the main-
taoanoe

Judge Porter continued his cross-examina­
tion, whioh at times proved irritating to the
prisoner. and whioh relented at times sav
agely(and again insolently, and with au impu­
dent mimicry of tho interrogator.
Q.—"When you wrote the president's nomin­
ation was sn act of Ood,his removal an act of
Ood, did you have Napoleon's bulletin's in your
mtad?V ,-"A—(Apparently gratified)—"That is

kind of style, look through my book. I take
my choice before this court and jury on the
fast that the Deity inspired the act I am not
a MOL? The Deity ims»r employed a fool to do
nis work. He put it into my brain and heart
and left me to work it out in my own way."
Q.—"And did you j"
A—"Under sanction of the Deity. The pres
sure on me couuneneed about six weeks before
tne actukrshooting. I waa the predestined man
'.from!the~ftithdation of the world to do this act,
and I bad to do it"
Q—"And your destiny waa.to kill Garfield?"
A—"It was my destiny to obey the Divine
will, and let him takemra of -it I put up my
life and have, not' bean humr or shot ret"
y—"Ana yoifflua not expect to.cer-
A—"I MB no-esMctattOit except to. do the
Divine willand let bim take care of me. I am
aahiiiftfldijiith tha Deity's conduct in this case
-tar toMi present lnoihent."
Porter went in to cfcss-examine the prisoner
with the object of showing-that the pretended
inspiration in regard to the theocratic daily, the
book called "Truth," to the lecture on the "Seo
oqd GQinihg' of Christ," and soforth, were
merely borrowed from ideas of Noyes', and
that portions of the book and lectnre were pla.
giarisms from the book called
"The Bureau," and this he showed
conclusively. Similar ideas and identity of ex
pression was apparent alHhrough, and witness
struggled desperately to explain away his pal­
pable plagansms.
He was asked if herlaid in wait for the pres­
ident in an alley, by night, and after a short
wrangle, said: "Now, you are on tbat, I'll
give you some news. "I'll tell you what oc­
curred that evening, July l.- vWitness then de­

beads together like two school girls. Ther
fellowship was delightful, and it oonfirmed
in the belief that Garfield had sold himself,
body and soul, to Blaine, and that Blaine was
ruining him to ruin :lhe stalwart wing of tbe
Republican party.
Quiteau here.bccame furiously exoited and
plunged into wild harrangue, denouncing Blaine
as bold, wicked and designing.

MrT' Porter—"The crOss-examination ia
clpaad."
"Bnt," oontinued the prisoner, excitedly,
"my duty to the Lord and to the American
people overcame my personal feelings. If the
Lord had not inspired that act it would not
have been done."
RooviUe.then.prooeeded with the redirect ex­
amination, ana the prisoner said: "Ihave
been just as dear aa to the divinity of that aot
'and' the need of it for the good of the people
since the first of June, aa man can be on any­
thing."
Adjourned.

The witness had formed an Opinion's* to Quit-7
eau's mental condition, but ceuld not express
an opinion aa to his Ban ity or insanity. Hia
impression was Guiteau bad an illy-ballanoaa
mind. In common parlianoe he did not have
good common sense.
Upon cross-examination the witness said he
never saw anything in Guiteau to indicate he
could not distinguish between right and wrong
never saw anything in the oonduct of the pris­
oner that would indicate he did not know the
difference between guilt and innocence, and
never saw anything to indicaie he would not
be responsible for orime. Sooville noted sev­
eral exceptions to the rulings of Judge Cox
favor of the admission of these replies. The
evidence created.quite
a stir in the court room,
and seemed to stagger tboae about the defense
table. The aister of the prisoner was particu­
larly affected, and in tones distinctly heard
by the reporters said: "He has perjured him­
self that is all there is about it."
Edward Daniela testified to Guiteau's peculiar­
ities, and his impression was that he was crazy.
After this witness left the stand Sooville an­
nounced that he had subpeanaed several wit
nesses whom he would now call The first
name oalled waa Vice-President Davis. He ap­
peared and was asked many irrelevant ques­
tions about the republicanSparty. He oonolud­
ed by saying: I was quite unwell when 1
got
the summons to attend. I had never seen tha
prisoner and knew nothing about the matter.
Adjourned.
MONDAY, DEC. 5.
Guiteau was late in arriving at the oourt
house. An immense crowd lined the sidewalks,
and upon alighting from the van the assassin
evinced unusual treDidation, and begged the
officers to take him around to the back entrance.
He was assured his escort waa ample, and with
trembling atepa he quietly shuffled through the
angry crowd.
Dr. E«nnon, managing editor of the Chicago
Medioal Review, 'gave biB opinion tbat Guiteau
was insane. The witness based his judgement
of Guiteau's insanity upon hereditary taint,
upon impartial judgement^ excitable emotions,
and upon inspirations, which alao include a
motive. The witness admitted tbat when a
man committed a crime while acting under a
delusion of divine inspiration and then conduct­
ed himself precisely aa a criminal would do, it
would be presumptive against his insanity.
Guiteau (angrily)—You are going too fast in
this matter. We want facts, not your judge­
ment The witness had stated the thing right
The lord injocts into tbe spirit and then tells a
man|to use hia own judgement to work it it out
That's just in my case. That's tlie way I got
my inspiration. The Lord don't employ fools
to do hia work. He gets the best material.
Gniteau suddenly interrupted the examina-.
tion, ind despite Scoville's efforts to restrain
him, broko out in severe renunciation of his
wife, saying he had jnst noticed a discourse
from her which was full of mis-statements,
and if ebe came into court to testify against
him he would show her up.
Riohard J. Hinton, editor of the Washington
Gazette, had seen the prisoner at the republi­
can headquarters in New York, and formed the
opinion that he waa exceedingly ill
balanced and egotistic. Tho witness resumed
by saying that tbe prisoner seemed to be a per­
fect nuieanre about tho rooms, but was inter
rupted by Guiteau, who retorted: "You were
a nuisance yourself. I'd rather be hung aa a
man than acquitted as a fool, and I won't have
anv more of this kind of evidence."
Dr. Ohas. A. Nicholas, of Bloomdale asylum,
replied to a hypothetical quostion proposed by
Scoville: "If tho evidence to which I have lis
toied is corrcct, I should say tho prisoner is
insane."
Dr. Folsom, of Boston, thought if tho hypo­
thetical proposition put by Scoville wss correct
in all particulars, the prisoner was intauewhen
he shot Pn.sident Garfield.
Dr. Samuel Worcester, of Salem, declined to
express an opinion until counsel explained
what he meant by tho term "inspira'ionaL"
Guiteau, impatiently—"When it is auirspira
tion by the Deity on my mind of a thought and
nower loreicn to my own will and mind.
That's what's meant I've told you a dozen
timts."
Witness was finally told by Scoville to stand
aside.
Dr. Wm. W. Godding, of the government
asylum for the insane at Washington, thought
that at tho time set forth in the hypothotical
question, if it were true, the prisoner was un­
doubtedly insane.
Dr. James H. MoBride, of Milwaukee, and
Dr. Channing, of Brookline, Mass., also thought,
taking all the hypothetical propositions to be
true, tbat the prisoner was insane.
Dr. W. T. Fisher, of Boston, would dislike to
be confined to the statement of facts contained
in the hypothetical questions, but if compelled
to answer he would say he should judge
the prisoner was insane. Witness was informed
by the prosecution they would want him as
a witness.
Enormous Pnplic Land Fraud*.
Washington Special to the New York Sun:
The annual report of Chief Brooks of the secret
service bureau of the trea«ury department con­
tains the following paragraph concerning land
frauds.
When the fiscal year ending Juno 30, 1880,
closed it left one of our operatives in tho midst
of an important investigation into allegod land
frauds originating in the state of Missouri and
extending into Pennsylvania, Ohio, and else­
where. By action ofcongress this division was
prohibited from spending any portion of its
appropriation in the land investigation, hence
our representative was compelled to transfer
his service to the interior department in order
to complete the cases in hand. The result of
his work, as far as developed, shows the rank­
est perjury and forgery, to which parties have
wrongfuily appropriated nearly 2,000,000
acres of public land. Up to present writing
over 100 indiotments have been found against
the conspirators, and several of tbe parties
have been tried, convicted, and a penal servi­
tude of seven years each meted out to them.
