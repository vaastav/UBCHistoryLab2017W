FIND STARVING MAN
LIVING IN STRAW PILE
Without Food Six Weeks, Loses
Power to Swallow,
Escanaba, Mich., Dec. 8. That he
had remained more than six weeks in
a straw stack without anything to cat,
was the story told by Charles Kaw
bowski, who is being nursed back to
health at the Delta county almshouse.
Emaciated, the mere shadow of a
man, Kawbowskl was uncovered by
men who were working on a farm near
Gladstone.
Kawbowskl could not find steady
employment. When he reached Isabel
la his shoes were worn out and his
feet Intensely sore. He was also weak
from hunger when he came upon the
straw stack, burrowed a hole into the
interior of the stack and decided to
make it bis home. He does not re
member all the details of his long stay
in the stack. He says he remembered
going out three times to get a drink
of water, but that he had nothing to
eat. He was practically unconscious,
and could not speak when the straw
packers found him.
When he was taken to the almshouse
It was found that he had lost the pow
er of swallowing and liquid food had
to be given to him by artificial means.
