GENERAL TELEGRAMS.
THE MORGAN RAID CLAIMS. -
A Movement on foot to Transfer Them to
the War Department.
Special to the Sentinel: . ' '".
Washington, Dec. !. Judge New is .trying,
with every prospect of success, to make an ar
rangement for the transfer in bulk Of the In
diana Morgan raid claims from the office of
the adjutant general of Indiana to the war
department here. This will be very Important
to the claimants, ina&sauch as the law requires
. all such claims to be Cied on or before the first
day of January, 18S. It will also probably
. prove to be a large caving to the claimants in.
the matter of attorneys' fees.
THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR
Mmfc.es His Anwaal Report What H Has to
Say About the Noble Red a,
- Washington, Nov. 27. The secretary of the
. interior, la his annual report to the president,
- discusses the Inuian question. He says:
Whatever tMUbles and perplexities the pres
ence of Use Indisns among a may cause,
every man who love justice and who values
the honor the American Bine will admit
that it is -our solemn duty to leave nothing
untried te prepare a better Ak Minn exter
mination, -aud a better rule than thai of brute
force, for the original occupants of the soil
upon wbch so many millions of our peopie
' have gwtn prosperous and happy. That
all tl Indiaus ou a this Northern
continent - have been ravages, and
tbat "many of then are savages
-now. true, but it la also true tbat uiauy
tribe- Stave risen to a promising degree of
elvtltestlun, ana there is no ruv-.o I jiluubl
that tHa rent, if wisely guarded, will be 'uuud

- .the whites. -Neither does it appear luat such
partial disturbances have bee a provoKed tev

a military loroe. O; lour diturbaticts that

quarter or a mi Uuu are umu serious

who were, wituin the last 1 mouths, hauued
together in New Mexico for murder aud ra
piue, waa larger t .au mat of the lndiaus re
cently on the war path near the southern part
or the territory. White I am by no means dis
posed to beiiitle the deplorable uatnra of the
'"Indian disturbance or the great value of tbe
military force in suppressing them, it is but
Just to the Indians to point out
the important fact tbat disturbance

1. To set the Indians to wurt nii.u tnr

3. To allot parcels of land to Indians in sev-
- eralty and to .give tbem individual title to
their farms in lee, inalienable lot certain pe
riods; thus to lunter the peine ol iudividual
ownership of property in-uead of their former
dependence upon the tribe wllu I s territory
in common. ....
4. Won a settlement in severalty with Indi
vidual titles is sceoinplisbed, to dispose with
their couaeutf those raoda on tueir reserva

the proceed to .fuiru a fund tor their beuetlt,
which will gradually relieve the Wovernment

This policy, - if adopted, 'support

solution of the Indiau problem twltbotu in

to them, and are now to nobody eise. Keier
riDg to the assertions frequently nade that
the tribal relations must be brokeu up, aud
the reservation system must be abandoned,
Secretary Bahurz observes that an attempt to
accomplish three oi,jcu at uce all over the '
: country without intermediate stages by
military force, would undoubtedly
result In many cises or Indian
wars of eagnltude and oitteruess which'
would require a much larger army thaurthe -Ooverum-utat

Senator McDonald left the city yesterday
afternoon for Washington in order t be in
his place when Coogress meets next Monday.
Knowing the anxiety of the public to have
his views upon the political questions ot the
day, a Sentinel reporter hunted him np anil
succeeded in getting him to talk awhile for
tbe benefit of if readers. He started the
interview by asking the senator his opinion
as to what Congress will do tie coining
session.
Senator McD. I don't anticipsts it re
newal of the struggle of tbe last session over
the election laws. The ist-ues in regard to
these laws may be said to have been made
np. Tba Democratic members have made
every legitimate effort pot-sibls to re pes 1
these laws, and the Republican members
have been determined that it should not be
done. Without a twe-thirds Democratic
majority, they must remain on tbe statute
boots until the executive depi ttnent of tbe
Government is changed. Dmouratio mem
bers have expressed their dttarminatim
that no money thall be appropriated for the
execution of these laws; therefore, the is, ties
upon this qaestiou may be rrg rdrd at made
up and the case paised over to the psoplo
for trisl. Tbe appropriation bills wi.l bi
passed tubstantiall v as agreed to at tbe extra
session, covering all legitimate Oaveromen''.
expecses and oniiiticg anything to pay for
tbe execution of tbe election laws.
Itep. Will any grinrral m amresof leg't
Ution coma before Congress at the approach
ing session?
senator McD. Yes. I do not see why
this sbould not be a working session. There
are many questions of general interest that
have remained in ths background that
ought to be brought, to tbe front. The
financial question sbould be left seventy
alone. Our currency has worked into a
good coodition, and wiib the cot.tinna' in
create of our coin balances, which has been
brought about partly from our mineral pro
jections and pa- ly from the balance of
trade which bas been in ctir favDr.it mutt
continue to remain good. Thi re will be no
necessity tor any legislation on he sabj ct,
nntil it is found, if such sbon'd be the fed
t int tbe present volume of pipercurrency is
tetlundant; in which event it should ba r
duced by re'iring the issues of tbe National
banks. While I do not think there will be
anything like a comnjt te revision of the tsr
iff st the coining s-ssiou, it should bt modi
fied and placed more nearly on a revenue
basis. Tbe ucjutt discrimination against
tbe West ought to bes'ricken out; as, f jr in
stance, nndar tbe present tan IF, salt ussd in
curing fish psyj no duly, as there is a draw
back on it for the fall amount of the duty
paid, while every poood of it nsed in cur
ing beef and pork pays a dn'y. While I
do not 'sr( tbat fishermen should be bur
dened by a tax on salt, I gee no
reason wby beef and pork sbould not be
equally exempt from taxation. Then our
regisrery and navigation laws need revli
ion so as to encourage tbe increase of oar
eommert-ial marine which tbe war almo t
destroyed. These and other unjust discrim
inations againt the West sbould not be el
lowed to remain. So, you see, thers is am
ple work for the session without making it a
political one. I think, too, that it shoe 1.1 be
comparatively a short one, aod that its gen
eral cour shouid be in favor of retrench
ment and reform, that ihs people may en
joy the full benefit of the business revival
as free as possible from governmental bur
dens. x
Rep What are your views in relation to
the presidential out look?
Senator McD. I do not look upon tbe
late elections as in anywise settling th
presidential contest of next- year.
Republican are, undoubtedly, elated at
their success, which is mainly to bu
attributed to a revival of s-ctional
animosities. With a generous people thtsi
feelings can not be.laniog; ahd sooner or
later they will react upon those who t-timu-lated
them. It Republicans continue in thi
belief that they possess the pow r to elect a'
president on mare party grounds, they will
Dominate) one of their trading politicians
most likely Sherman or Bl -line but, if they
become alarmed, they w ll us sheli-r
under tbe supposed popularity of General
Grant. In that event the country will bave
to undergo fearful tricl, as it will Bave to
determine, for the fitst time, whether or n it
one man shall be president for life. My
belief ia that in such a contest they will h
beaten. I think our chances for electiug
the next president are better than theirs, no
matter woo their candidate may be.
Itep Whom do you think the Democrat)
sbould nominate?
8nator McD My present opinion is that
it wouli be well for our patty, if it couli
forget, for the next four or five worths, tba'.
it had anything to do with selecting a presi
dential ticker, ae I think much of the edge
ot tba sectional issues will be t ikeu off by
thst time. It I very certain that our presi
dential candidate ought to be at Is to carry
Indiana and to unite the Democracy of New
York, as these are ths pivotal Bta'es. and
uch candidate would be ttronsr all nr.r the
-country. It ia not necessary to say tht the
uuiuiuBnun oi nr uenoncts would insure
tbe vote of Indiana to the Democracy,
for there is no int lligent man who
doubts it; and I have heard nog od reason
given why be could not get the united vote
of tbe New York Democracy H is a Itfe
lona Democrat, and in character and ability,
he ts ths equal of any man in our psrty.
Rep When and wbsrs do you think our
National convention sbould be held?
Senator McD. I do not think we sbouH bs
in baste to hold our convention; and I am
decidedly of the opinion tbat it should be
held in the West. I have no chutrts as to
the plana; Cincinnati, Chicago. Stint Louts
or any other Western city hiving tbe ability
to accommodate the people who will be
tbere, would suit me.

Detective and If la Friend-,.
Special CorrespotideDos of th Hentlnel.
North Vernoit, Ind , Nov. 27. Inrilgua-
tlon has quickly followed surprise In this
community over the flight of Thomas Mo
Govern, nnder indictment for perjiity, in
Jackson county. Your readers will remem
ber that McGovcru is the man on wbosn
affidavit the arrest of 13 Democratic citt
ern ot jeoninvs county was made by United
States niaraikl from Iudlanaptilis on tbe
Monday b fore tbe Od ober elet ttous of
1878. These citlnns were dranged lo In
d anapolle, and a'tar iodiolment by ths
United States grand Jury were put on trial
before Judge Oreshaui, where one Innocent
man (James H. Wllkets u) was tent to tbe
Slates prison. Tbe leading witness against
tbe defendant was Thomas McGovern. He
was tbe ohtef pet and main relianoe of Ben
Harrison, Trueler A Co., to oouvict the de
fendant. And now, when his perjuty bas
accomplished all tbat it is possible to accom
plish, and be is asked to face trial for per
jury before tbe cit;z-ns of his county and his
neighbors, he takes refuge in fi'ght However
we do not pen this communication as much
to fitly characterize McGovern as to inquire
oi the people of toe 8tate, through your pa
per, what opinion but that of the gravest cul
pability can be entertained ot Harrisen, Nel
too, Trussler and the horde of small fry who
abet t id tbe prosecution of tbe , Jennings
county citizne. . They werest grest expense
in making their defense, being required to
a'tend court 60 miles from their home, in a
strange city, and for a month, their families
unaccustomed to scenes ot arret t, were
thrown ict distress and grief over the seiz
ure of their husbands, brothers and fathers
by the United States authotities, and all
turough the perjured t tory of thia McGov
ern, nursed and pitted oy the Republican
leaders of Indiana.
McGovern is now a Seeing felon, and the
blood of Wilkerson and the tears of 13 Jen
Dingt county homes are upon Ben Harrison
a d his assistants. Tbe great Government
ol the United States paid Harrison $l,0O) to
persecute honest citizens upin the perjured
statement of a well known scoundrel.
Tbe only palliation for Harrison that can
bs suggested ia that be was imposed upon
by the representations of ceitiiu Raiical
leaders of Jennings and Jackson counties
that McGovern was wortty of belief. Bat
Harrison's goad cense and experience
should bave warced bitn against credence in
the affidavit of a so-called detective, who
confessed noon the witness ttmd that be
was paid $100 by Platter and Overmyr to
plav tbe part he did in the conspiracy cafes.
This portion of the State does not ask judg
ment against Platter and Overmeyer, the
associates of the peijared McGjvero, for
they will tike care of them, but against
Harrison, Trussler .t Co , and the Govern
ment itself, we do ak the poople to pro
nouccd judgment.
The night after Judge Carr bad overruled
the motion of McGuvern's attorney to quash
ths indictment, a conclave of tcui birds
seems to have been beld at Nurth Veinon
to consider tne state f affairs and the .u
1 ok for McGovern. Fried ey, a Madison
patriot, whose party in Jefferson county
bad fnrnishtd $100 of tbe $100 paid
to McGavern; Dvid Overmyr, who
had written McGovern's affidavit for
him in a Seymour garret and had paid
him tbe $400; John Overmeyer, who, in 18C3
waa a member of a lodge of the Kribts of
tbe UclJen Circle, aud to 18i7 cood patriot
ism as the Republican leader of the House
of Representatives, were t recent. While to
tbe discredit of the bench be it said, that a
judge, wbo bolds the seat, but not the
character of a judge, lent tbe l'ght of his
judicial advice to tie conclave.
