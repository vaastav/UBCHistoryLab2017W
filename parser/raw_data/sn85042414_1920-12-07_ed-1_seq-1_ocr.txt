sentence of Abraham Lincoln's.
'"Let us haye filth that right makes might, and. in that faith let us
dare to do our duty as we understand it'-i-a sentenco immortal 'because
it .embodies in -a form of utter- simplicity and purity the essential faith
of the nation founded upon it came the hope ltito the" world that a new
oraert. would -prevail throughout the affairs of mankind, an order in
which reason and right would take precedence of covetousness and. force,
and I believe that I express the wish and purpose of every thoughtful
person when I say this sentence marks for us in the plainest manner the
part we should play alike in the arrangement Of our domestic affairs
ind!in our ejcercUw of influence upon the affialrs of the world. By-this
and by this faith alone, can the world be lifted out of Its present
confusion afed despair. It-was this faith Which prevailed over, the wicked
force ,of Germany. 1Tou will remember that .the beginning 6f the end
of the war came when the German people foutid themselves face to*face
with the conscience of the world and realixed'thsi,' rlsht was. everywhere
arrayed against the wrong that their government was attempting to.
perpetrate. .1 think, therefore, that it is tru£ to sair,that thiis was the

two «tid a half billions are floating debts andNive billions Victory notes

mUst- determined, with reference to these maturities. Sound policy
:detaands that the government expenses be reduced to the lowest amount
which' will permit the various servicb to. operate efficiently and that
government receipts-from taxes and salvage be Qiaintained sufficiently
high-to provide for current requirepienta ihefading interest and sinking

vigorous salvage operations and adequate revenues from taxation, a

Test for Democracy. I
Democracy," the president said, is
being put upon, its final test."
"The old world," said he, "Is just
now suffering from a wanton rejec
tion of the principle of democracv
and a substitution of the principle of
autocracy as asserted in the name but
without the authority-and. sanction ot
the multitude. This is the time of all
others when democracy should prov*
its purity and its. spiritual-vpower to
prevail. It is surely the manifest des
tiny of the United States to lead in the
attempt to make this spirit prevail."
Two .ways "in which the United
States can assist to accomplish this
great object" were outlined by the
president. They were:
First: By offering the example
wjthin_her own borders of the will and
power of democracy to make and 'en
force laws which are unquestionably
just and which are equal In their ad
ministration. *'i
Second.- By Standing for right and
justice towards individual nations.
"The Ignited States," said the presi
dent, "cannot refuse this.role of cham
pion without putting the Stigma of
rejection upon the great and devoted
men who brought its government Into
existence." -.
Did Not Appear.
The president's message was trans
mitted by messenger, the president ad
hering -to his decision not to address
congress in person.
The president's message wms not
read immediately to congress, which
waited until it had disposed.'bf routine
business. Secretary Tumulty was
among the spectators in the senate,
occupying a seat on the floor. Public
galleries again were filled and Sev
eral diplomats were present.
