persons, four hundred were skilled white
workmen and the other T.tf'O Chinese and

THIS has been an open season, and we find ourselves
with an overstock of Business Suitings. They are
all high-Krnde Woolens, such suits as we make to
measure at $25 and $zS.
Good storekeeping- demands that stocks should not ;
be carried over until next j-car. It requires that all the
stock in this store should have quick-selling qualities
hence the necessity of a general clearance of these suit
ings while the season lasts.
We show over 200 patterns, all new and of this sea
son's production, representing all of the newest ideas in
Cassimere, Cheviot and Woolen Suitings, and we pur
pose to make these Suits to measure, whi!c they last, at
each. COME EARLY for thc best of the choosing!

"In my young days," said thc railroad
man with a touch of pathos in his voice-,
'T got a job as station agent at the most
lonesome junction 1 ever ran across in the
West. 1 had to board myself, and out?ide
of the train hands and a tdray cowboy
there was no one to talk to. 1 was getting
mighty tiretl ef the job when a stranger
stopped off one night lo tiike the narrow
gauge, lie had three hours to wait, and
as there was nothing doing with me 1 made
bold to ahk if he didn't want a little game
of poker.
" I might take a hand for small stakes,
he replied after looking me over pretty
carefully, and 1 got out an old pack of
cards and at it we went. I never was a
decent hand at the game and at that time;
hardly knew th value of the cards. I
further had only about cents in -ash,
and so you may believe nie that 1 did not
sit down In a spirit of avariee. W played
a 5-eent ante and a lo-c-nt-limit game ior
a while and I hail the best of luck. 1 was
about $2 ahead when the stranger asked
to raise the ante to .""ii cents and the limit
to $1. I didn't object ami my luck si ill fed
lowed me. 1 didn't have to do any blutling.
The poorest bands I got held two pairs,
while he was in luck to get a pair of jacks.
Before three hours were up 1 vas f'J ' ahead
of him. and when the train whistled and I
called his attention to it he replied :
" 'Never mind the train. I'm going to sit
here till mv luck changes.
"After I had sem the train off and re
ported her we went at it again. This time
it was a dollar ante and no limit to tue
game. The stranger had a bier wail with
him and could have raised me nut, but he
played fair. It was more than l would
have done with luck dead against me.
When it came 6 o'clock in the morning and
the express was due I was $;yi ahead of
the game. He didn't do any kicking, but
went off geod naturcd. though I war, soon
to hear from him again. That afternoon
I got the bounce through the division
superintendent, and when I asxe-.l the rea
son he replied :
" 'For playing poker.'
" 'But I neglected none of my duties.'
I replied.
" 'But you played against our new super
intendent.' "'The devil I did! Of course 1 didn't
know him. Weil, he might h:.ve won ray
money.'
" 'But vou won his. you see, and we've
got to keep up the discipline Back up
and git!'
"I got." sighed the story teller, "and I
thoucht it was a mean trick for a year or
so. Then I was offered a better jo; on
the same line, and 1 got a call to the super-
intendellt'H Otf'.ce. lie gave me s.,,n.e ,:!-
era I talk, and w' had finished our business
when he suddenly sail:
" 'Oh, by the way. I beli.-ve vou play
poker?'
" 1 haven't ?inee that night.' I repliej.
ey(.s just m. I believe um were dis
e -harped next day?
" 'Yes. sir.'
" Y-e-s, just so. Very Interesting game,
and you didn't neglect your einlies, but
as I saw some one looking through the
window Just a we counted ud 1 had to
look out for discipline, you know? Y-e-s.

The attention or those who scoff at Bud
yard Kiriing's literary lame is invited
respectfully to the new edition rf "The
Iliad." Just issued by Thomas 1). Sey

Yale. ThTe they will find the metrical
excuse which Kipling imagines Tommy
Atkins giving lor Ids looting propensities
tpaotcd as a most Illuminating imminent
upon nie of the hotly disputed points of
classical scholarship.
Professor Seymour is discussing-, as e very
editor of Ilonnr needs must, the int-stioii
whether there was tv Homer or sev.-ral.
He admits that "The Iliad" and "The
Odyt-sey" were probably "growths" from
the works of many p- ts. Y t lie contends
lor the essential unity of these poe ins.
"A master mind." he says, ."there must
have b.'en, but yet the poems came gradu
ally to their present condition. .Many
brave men lived b fore Agunemnoii." and
many poets p receded Hoir.ir. who used
freely the poetic material whieh was the
inheritance of hi- generation. No one
has state tl the case inure clearly than Bud
yard Kipling:
"W't n 'Omer smote 'is bloomin' lyre.
'B'd Yard men sing by land and sea.
And wot Y thought Y miuht reuiie
'K went and took, the sirne as me."
"We may compare." continues 1'rofessor
Seymour, "also Cioio's words (Brutus
xviii. Tl: 'Nihil est simul t invtntum t
