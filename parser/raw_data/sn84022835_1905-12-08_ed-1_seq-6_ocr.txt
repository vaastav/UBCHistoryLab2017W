though there appears to bo no founda
tion for the prevailing fears that rn
outbreak is imminent, the population
continues In n state of anxious sus
pense. Tho garrison has now been
reinforced by forty-two battalions of
Infantry, fifteen squadrons of cavalry
and twelve machlno gun batteries.
Tho government, It In reported, nar
rowly frustrated a plot whereby 1,000
armed men had arranged to raid tno
state treasury. The extension of the
Btrlko of the telegraphers to tho pos
tal system Is complete and the paral
ysis of business Is Increasing tho
danger of a financial crisis.
Tho strike of tho Moscow telephono
opcrntors, who cut tho wires and toro
up tho poles, has severed tho last
means of communication with tho an
cient capital. The present conditions
arc unbenrablo. Sympathy with thq
poorly paid post and telegraph em
ployes is now turning Into Indignation
ngalnet tho strikers, and the public
Is supporting a formidable movement
which has been started by all classes
to throw off the yoke of the revolu
tionaries. Gapon Against Strikers.
Tho government is undoubtedly en
couraglng the organizing of tho
forces. The "law and order party"
took tho lead, which is now being fol
lowed by tho "society of strike break
ers," but the most important move
ment has been started under the lead
ership of Kather Gapon, tho former
Idol of tho workmen, who, since his
residence abroad, has become con
vinced that Russia is not prepared for
a republic, and Is appealing to his old
comrades to cut loose from the revolu
tionary agitators. Tho latter already
chargo that Kather Gapon has been
bought nnd that ho is a traitor to tho
cause of tho people.
This being a holiday, Kather Gapon
attended meetings of eleven of the or
ganizations which ho controlled be
fore Jan. 22, at which his words were
cheered to tho echo. At these meet
ings tho socialist orators were howled
down nnd In some cases forcibly
ejected. If this movement should
grow and an effective split among tho
workmen be thereby created, it will
prove of immeasurable service to tho
government in tiding things over until
tho meeting of tho douma.
A guard for the American embassy,
consisting of marines, under a petty
officer, from tho United States cruiser
Minneapolis, arrived here.
Lieutenant General Rudiger, min
ister of war, reversed tho judgment
of tho court-mnrtial at Samara, sen
tencing to death an engineer named
Sokoloff and other lenders of the rail
road strike. Thus a general railroad
strike Is averted.
JEWS SEND OUT AN APPEAL.

Odessa, Dec. 4. This dispatch Is
sent at the request of the Jewish
community, which fears a fresh mas
sacre by tho local garrison. It is as
serted that a proclamation is being

calling on tho soldiers to exterminate

per offices in revenge for groundless
accusations against the tioops of their

and in tho protection or rowdies. This-
