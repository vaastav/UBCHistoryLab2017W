Hi '1 'I 'ftF
It.-M Admiral lwe Hay h Felt no
lnnnvrWnre WIHM In tit IVnnl. Tent
Perfectly fculufwinry.
NICW YOltIC, November it. In Hip
prwwnr of a big rrwwil which, despite
the storm, niMHimhletl to witness tliu
merging f the submarine boat Fulton,
that craft roue from tho bottom of the
bay this morning ut 10:SO o'clock, with
nil well and greatly surprised to llnd
there was a storm raging. The test of
the Fulton's staying was highly satis
factory, not only to the officers of the
company that built her and the navnl
officers present, but those who wont to
the bottom In the boat. They report
there was not the slightest discomfort
to them during their more than fifteen
hours of submersion below the surface.
Captain Cable of the Holland Com
pany, who wns In command, cald that
the boat could have remained down for
three montliB If there were food enough
on board. Although there was but six
feet of water over the lop of tlio tut ret,
those on board felt nothing of the
storm. Through the night there was a
light rolling motion to the craft, but
this was nscrlbed to the regular motion
of the water and not to the disturbance
which was rolling the waves high on
the shore.
Immediately on commlng to the sur
face, the Fulton, under her own power,
ran alongside the dock and tied up.
Members of the crew say they expe
rienced no difficulty In breathing, and
that the air was all that could be desir
ed and much purer and better than in
an ordinary closed room In which are
severa 1 persons, Every piece of
machinery worked to perfection during
the night. The men ate two meals
while under water and most of them ob
tained three or four hours' sleep.
Itear Admiral Lowe said later:
"When we went down I assisted Cap
tain Cable in making an inspection ot
the ship. Then I retired, whllo the crew
played cards and read. Every few
hours I was awakened and made In
flections of the conditions. Early this
morning Captain Cable called my atten
tion to the pressure gauge, whlcn indi
cates the depth. It showed that wo
were lower In the water than at high
tide last night, when we were submerg
ed. There was noth'.n.? to show us why
it was, but a little while la lor I noticed
that the water, is we saw it lliroi'gh
the deadlights, was very d'rty, and I
Imagined that n storm was blowing.
There was no rock or roll of th; vessel
to Indicate what was going on.
"Not once," added the adm'ral, 'did
I notice any sign of bnd air, gas or Dther
Impuiity. Considering that we aid not
draw on the tanks at all I consider this
Is wonderful. It upsets all theories cf
physicians and scientists, who i-Jll us
that what we did last night was impos
sible. I was critical all night and noth
ing escaped me."
The experts present unite In calling
attention to the sea-going qualities o
the Fulton. The submarine boat was
not affected by the sea or the high wind
which prevailed. Other boats of twice
its tonnage rolled and tossed so that
they had to get under way and seek a
sheltered harbor.
The longest time that any submarine
boat had .been under water heretofore In
the United States was three hours.
Lieutenant Harry C'olwell kept the Hol
land submerged that long In the Poto
mac last year. The Fulton had never
been under longer than twenty-live
minutes when Bhe made a two-mile run
submerged a few weeks ago.

BISHOP & CO.
WASHINGTON, December 1 Advices
from Rome state that jn a few days
Pope Leo XIII will Issue a pontifical
bull which will finally determine a set
tlement of the ecclesiastical difficulties
In the Philippines. It will be to carry
out its provisions that Mgr. Sbarettl,
former' Bishop of Havana, will go at
once to Manila from Rome as Apostolic
Delegate In succession to Mgr. Chapelle
who will return to his see in New Or
leans. The document will probably be about
10,000 words lone und will be drafted In
the form of an apostolic constitution. It
will be addressed generally to the hier
archy of the Philippines and specifically
to Mgr. Nozelada de Villa, Archbishop
of Manila.
In the first part the bull will treat of
the historic record of the church In the
Philippines, in the second of the discip
linary needs of the Islands and In the
third tot existing conditions 'of the
church there.
In accordance with his Judgment on
the reports presented to him of these
conditions the 'Pope will order the
holding of a provincial council In Ma
nila, at which the canonical laws and
diocesan regulations enacted by the
Ecumanlcal Council of Archbishops and
Bishops of Latin-America, held In Rome
In 1899, will be made also of force In the
Philippines, modified only by such local
needs as the Islands show.
The clergy, secular and regular, will
remain as they now aie, but new sem
inaries and schools and a new system
will be established for their education
The present Bishops of all the sees,
namely, Manila, Cebu, Jaro and Neuvo
Carceres, will be retained, but four or
five new sees will be created. To these
latter American prelates or men trained
In American seminaries and ways will
probably be appointed.
Mgr. Sbarettl, new Apostolic Delegate
to Manila, will have the same plenary
powers as those exercised by the dele
gate In Washington, and he will be
charged In Home with the strict appli
cation of the policy outlined by the
Pope In this bull to the hierarchy of the
Philippines and the laws enacted at the
provincial council, which It summons
and over which he will preside In the
Pope's name.
Archbishop Nozelada will leave for
Manila ubout the first of the new year,
and Mgr. Sbarettl will probably go will
him, Hev. Dr. Honaventure Broderlck
of New Haven, Conn,, will go as Mgr.
Sbarettl's secretary, having been with
him also during his successful settle
ment of the property and other ques
tions in Cuba,
AT KAHUKU.
W. A. Baldwin the retiring manager
of Knhuku plantation was the recipient
of a fine diamond shirt stud, a gift of
the employees of the plantation. Af
ter exchanging greetings and bidding
all good-bye, Mr. ualdwln left on the
train for his new plantation, Makawell,
carrying the good will and alohas of all
associated with the plantation.
