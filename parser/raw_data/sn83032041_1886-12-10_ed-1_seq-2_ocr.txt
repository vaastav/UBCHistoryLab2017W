Tite second trial of ex-AMerman LT- i

Tjie Chief Clerk of the House at
Washington has classified the members
ot Congress who were elected in Novem
ber, but who will not take their seats
until the first Monday in next December,
as follows : Democrats, ICS ; Republi
cans, lo2. and 4 Indpendents, with one
vacancy in Rhode Island to be filled,
most probably, by a Republican. If the
foui Independents divide, as tley are
expected to do, equa'ly between the two
e . s, the Democrats will have a major
ity of fourteen in a full Hous. One
hundred acd ninety -five of the prtsent
mi .'.bT8 have been returned to the next
Uou, which is ten more than the num
ber of old members in the present
Cougreps.
Conckes.- met on Monday laat, and
the President':; message was read in both
Housts. A w-ek or ten days ago Mr.
Cleveland was reported as having said
that the message would be much shorter
than the one of last year, but the differ
ence bfetwevii the two, so far as their
Ungth ia concerned, is not perceptible to
the naked eye. The message is said to
contain sixteen thousand words, vhich,
of curse, precludes its publication at
length iu our paper. We Lope, however,
to see its prominent features put into
euch a condensed shape as will enable
us to publish it in our next number.
While some portions of the message are
criticised with more or les? vigor, grow
ing out of local feeling, nothing is urged
ia any quarter against the sincerity and
honest purpose of the man vho wrote it.
Several prominent members of
Congress have gtven the assurance that
a rigorous effort will be made this wiu
tei to pass a bill for the redemption of
the trade dollar. All similar efforts
ma'le In previous Coogreuses have failed
because it was alleged that the bulk of
this coin id held by speculators. This
is no doubt true, but as it has been four
or Eve years since brokers ana others
bought up the dollars at about 85 cents
and withdrew them from circulation, if
tb government should now redeem
them the speculators would only make
about fifteen per cent, on their invest
ment, which baa stood for four years.
Ci der these circumstances the objection
to the passage of a bill for their redemp
tion on the ground that it would be in
the interest of speculators no longer has
much force, and there would seem to be
no sound reason why Congress should
auy longer postpone legislation on the
subject.
Ever since the Act of Assembly of
June, 1S8,"), offeriug a bounty for the
killing of hawks, owls, weasels, minks
and wildcats, wei into ( fleet, much
complaint has been made by the county
authorities in many portions of the
State in regard to the large amount of
money In the shape of premiums that
has been paid out by county Treasurers
In compliance with the Act. For the
purpose or eliciting the facts in regard
to its operation, th Secretary of the
State Board of Agriculture addressed a
circular to the commissioners and treas
urer of each county, asking for a state
ment of their respective disbursements
since its passage. Their replies to the
Secretary show that about one hundred
thonsand dollars have been paid for the
destruction of the animals named in the
act. Nearly all the commissioners and
t r"surers lavor a repeal of the Act, so
far as it applies to hawks and owls, and
some of them urge its entire removal
from the statute book.
Is the case of The National Soldiers'
Homo ag tinst General B. F. Botler,
which was ixled last week in the United
States Circuit Court, at Boston, the jary
returned a verdict for the plaintiff for
J16.537.50. The action was brought to
recover funds of the Home which it was
alleged bad been misappropriated by
Butler while Treasurer. It is said that
in his charge to the jury, the Judge gave
Benjamin a terrible hauling over the
coali. It wouldn't, however, produce
any greater effect upon Butler than a
scathing phillippic would upon the hard
ened cheek of Bob Ingersoll. As Butler
has been a wealthy man for many years
there must be bodd explanation of this
matter which was singularly withheld
at the trial. It may possibly be trne, as
has often been charged, that Butler ap
propriated to his own use a considerable
number of silver spoons while he was

In view of our recent experience wiih
earthquakes, an article bv Prof. J. W.
Powell, Director of he United States
Geological Survey, in which he treats of
(he causes of earthquakes, is of much
interest. The aiJicle, while it alludes to
the several theories accepted upon this
question, naturally places most reliance
upon the oue which rep?rds the phenom
enon from a geological '..,t of view.
Mr. Powell's article is prepared in a
style adapted Ij the comprehension of
non-scientiflc readers, and reflocM the
opinions of scientific meu of the present
day. Prof. Pcweli believes all phenom
ena of eajthquakes explainable by the
theory thai !he crust of the earth rests on
a semi fluid mass, and that the shaking,
movements, flexures and displacements
of the comparatively thin outer shell are
the result of the cooling of the inner
mass and the consequent displacement of
the outer surface. The article is one of
the most luminous as well as the ablest
resume of what we knovr on the subject,
and as such is of much more than ordin
ary interest.
The members of the Legislature of
this State who expect to ride to Harris
burg ou free passes and to travel from
Harrisburg to Philadelphia or to almost
any r.l er place in the State during the
session by the same bandv pieces of
pasteboard, are likely to meet with sore
and unlooked-fordisappointment. There
is a rumor afloat that Attorney General
Cassidy will apply for an injunction
forbidding the Philadelphia and Reading
railroads from Issuing free passes except
to their officers and employes, as is plain
ly enjoined in the Constitution. It may
be doubtful wuetherMr. Cassidy intends
taking the course above indicated, for
the reason that the Constitution makes
it the duty of the Legislature to enforce
by appropriate legislation the prohibition
against issuing free passe. This baa
never been done, although two or three
hypocritical efforts in that direction
have been made, with the tacit under
standing, however, that they should
fail. If a blow is about to be struck
against the free pass ystem in this State,
it will be dealt by Mr. Roberts, himself.
President of the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company, who is said to be convinced
that the assistance rendered by those
who are favored with free passes does
not compensate for the loss in receipts.
It is understood that the question was
fully considered at a recent meeting in
New York of the highest officers of the
principal railroad lines, and a conclusion
arrived at to put an end to the business
f'r the r.-st :f January, If this Is
done there will be weeping, wailing and
gnashing of teeth, and if It isn't done
the people will have a chance of learnfng
during the approaching session of the
Ir.islature how many men there are in
that body who refuse to carry out the
plain mandates or a Constitution which
they l ave solemnly pworn to defend and
support.
f hen and oyt.
lu view of te present prosperous con
dition of the br.riness interests of the
conn'ry under eighteen months' experi
ence with a Democratic administration,
and the Republican predictions two
years ago of the ruin and disu.ter that
wculd surely follow if C;eve'and was
elected, the Philadelpuia 7iiM'.ndulges
iu the following appropriate remarks :
Attention was called in the columns
of 27e Tiiues recently to the general
business revival, stress bein;; laid upon
the fact that a great revival in railway
building had taken piace. The probable
mileage of new railway track for the
year lftSC was placed at 7000 miles. Mr.
Swank, of the American Iron and Steel
Association, now confirms this roseate
view of the business situation by declar
ing that the steel rail output of the
present season will exceed that of 1SS2,
when railway building In this country
reacbPd. high water mark, calling for
l,?84,0O7 gross tons of steel rails. He
also states that 800,000 tons of steel
rails are already contracted for to be
livered in 1887, which means that the
mileage of new track next year will. In
all probability, exceed that of 18SG. Ite
also adds the consoling information that
steel rati manufacturers are getting $35
per ton, with every prospect that the
price will reach f 40 in the early part of
1887.
These figures are very consoling to the
business !iterests of the country and
everybody will feel like rejoicing at their
presentation, backed by an authority so
reliable as Mr. Swank. Perhaps it would
be more nearly the exact truth to say
that almost everybody rejoices, as it
must not be forgotten that a lot of polit
ical prophets of ill omen declared ia
1884 that a Democratic administration
meant abeo'ute ruin to every business
interest in the country. It can hardly
be pleasant to these partisan Jeremiahs
to be proved idiotic liars by the irresist
ible loffic of evicts, and they may be set
down s the exceptions that prove the
rule of general rejoicing. They are not
happy because the country is prosperous
when they said it cou'dn't be.
This reviving prosperity in the face of
the moat solemn asseverations of its
impossibility only proves that business
prosperity in the United States has very
little relation to political movements.
Whatever may be the platrorm profes
sions i iny political party there are so
many checks and balances in our form'
of government that any revolutionary
legislation on business or economic
subjects is simply impossible, and the
business of the country gos on its way
governed by the laws of supply and
demand, no matter which party wins
the Presidency.
An Archbishop on the Land JneMion.
Tn pastoral !e ter of the Roooan Cath
olic Archbishop of New York is, in
view of recent aeitations, especially re
markaDle for the vigorous and able
assertion of the rights of property which
it contains. All theories of Communists
or Social hits wh:- h are based on a denial
of tb-r rigb: 0f man to the ownership of
what bis skill of mind or hand has pro
duced, or his economy has saved, are
strongly corr.batted. The Roman Cath
olic Church in this respect insists i.ion
the most conservative principles, and
places under its ban the vagaries of rea
soning by which the rights of individual
possession are attacked.
Recognizing that these irany notions
have their root in a irverssion of the
doctrine of equal rights, the Archbishop
says :t is nectssarv, drst of all, to under
stand in its true sense the statement
that all men are created equal. It dots
not mean that oiie man may not surpass
another in power or strength or beauty,
for no to men are exactly alike in these
respects ; but men are created equal "in
that they are all destined to the same
ultimate Md, have the same essence,
and are end - ved with the same faculties
wherewith to attain that end." The
power to improve and the freedom of
directing his action, constitute the es
sential lights of man. Right is defined
as -'the moral faculty which tach one
has for what is his or what is dm to
him," and a man's right to anv particu
lar obji ct 'n God's universe depends on
"whether it is necessary to him in rela
tion lo his last end, or even useful, pro
vided the just rights of others are
respected."
From these fum,t.m?utal statements
the Aichbi.-hop proceeds to a considera
tion of the question "boldly debated
nowadays, whetLir or not man can have
the right of property or ownership in
land." The first thing tobe determined
is what the right of property is. "It is
the moral faculty of c'aiming an object
as one's own, and of disposing of both
the object aud its utility according to
one's own will, without any rightfui in
terference on the part of others."
While It is universally conceded that
man has a right to the use of certain
things, it is sometimes vehemently de
nied th ;t he Cun acquire the rig..' to
possess these things as his own, upou the
plausible ground that, all being equal, no
man has a right to exclude others who
have rights as strong ?i his from 'Ve
air, the light, and from the earth and its
farm lands.
Then taking np the land question, the
argument in support of the rigtit of
ownership ia so tersely set forth that it
may profitably be pondered as it was
written. "Undoubtedly God made the
earth for the use of all mankind, but
whether the possession thereof was to be
iu common, or by individual ownership,
wis ieft for reason to determine. Such
determination, judging from th6 f?-!ts of
history, te sanction of from the
teaching . ' ' .e widest and the actions of
the best and bravest of mankind, has
been and is, that man can by lawful acts
become possessed of the right of owner
ship in property, and not merely in its
use. The reason is because a man is
strictly entitled o that of "hich he is
the producing cause, to the improvement
he brings about in it, and the enjoyment
of both. But it is c.ear that iu a farm,
for instance, which one has by patient
toil improved in value, in a block of
marble out of which one has chiseled a
perfect statue, he cannot fully enjoy the
improvement be has caused unless he
have also the right to own tlje object
thus improved. He has a strict right
and evil are the laws and systems which
ignore it either to ownership aud enjoy
ment, or to a full compensation for the
improvement which is his.
"To strive to base arguments against
ownership in land by reasoning on the
universal distrr ucion of air and light is
only a freak of the imagitat:. i. Human
industry caunoi scatter a cb ud from tie
fore the face of the sun, nor lift a
that may be freighted with damaging
vapors ; we take the air aud t r.e liifht as
God givt-s them, and we owe him thanks
for his bounty. It was rnly the earth
which fell under the primeval curse
when man had sinned, and it is only the
earth, not the air nor light, which roan's
industrious toil can coax back to some
thing lik its original fruitf ulr.ess. Wbn
he has done so, his just reward is to en
joy the results without hindrance from
others."
Then follows the familiar argument
that if the right of ownership is denied,
the "ed of stagnation in hue 'in enter
prise sown. While it is trne that too
often the rights of the toiler are trampled
on and the fruits of his labor seized from
him and this too frequently with the
concurrenca or connivance of law and
this constitutes an evil to be corrected ;
yet the redress can never be brought
about by denying a fundamental right or
ty perpetrating a radical wrong. "Seek
rather for redress of such iiksome griev
ances by the wise methods which the
Church of Christ is forever teaching,
though her voice may pass uuheeded by
the threat ones of earth." How the
tacV.ngs of th? Church are applicable
to t!,v rtmedy of evils under which the
poor do grcn is set forth iu a long ex
tract from the encyclical of the Pope.
A larre proportion of that class liable

Wetting The Rent.
The plan of the rent strike proposed
by the United Ireland rewspaper, which
is all the rage in the Green Isle, is very
simple but novel in character. In al
most every instance in which tLv land
lord has refused to grant a rednction of
rent, the Tenants have quietly deposited
in the hands of a trustee such rents as
they thins fair and reasonable. If the
landloid decides, on reconsidering the
matter, to accept these rents, they will
be paid to him by the trustee. If on
the other hand he attempts to evict the
tenants he will be paid uothlng at all,
and these very rents will bo n"d as funds
to resist ! e eviction proceedi-igs. For
awhile the landlords Totidly imagined
that the trnstees could be compelled by
law . ve up the rents entrusted to
their care. But the Attorney General
for Ireland has declared such a course
to be impracticable, and that the action
of th trustees is within the law. The
scenes at these rent collecting gatherings
are unexampled in the history of Ireland.
The tenant) gather around the cabin in
which the selected trustees, accompa
nied by the parish priest, are receiving
the money. Everything is conducted
as regularly as at the rent offices of the
estates from which the tenants come,
but the tenants are animated, excited,
and enthusiastic and the surroundings
are rough. Printei receipt, filled in.
are given for every payment in place oi
the receipts of the landlord, and arter
the last payment is handed in. a few
words from the priests and trustees
bring the proceedings to a close and the
gathering disperses, all parties well
satisfied with their dav's work. The
idea takes lik wild fire ," and not alone
among the Nationalists, but eveu the
Oraog tenants are adopting it. The

HOW A RA.VK WAS BROKK..
The Recent Failure at GlenRock.
William Ilerbst. tx-president of the j
First National Bank ot Glen Rock, York ;
county, histwoBons, Jacob S. and W. '
II. Herbst, and Henry Sei'.z, the last (
named of whom was cashier of the i
bank, were arrested on Saturday chareed '
with swindling it out of about $50,000 j
of its 75,0 "apiral. It was learned :
some days ago that tb Mnk was in a '
bad fix, as b- Iwi jc ii jer Herbs's, (
w ho conducted a country store in Glen
Rc k. aud had unlimited credit at the I
bank, bee me insolvent, and this causeJ j
a run on that institution. This aroused j
the board of directors, who began at j
once to investigate the finances "f the
busiuess, and found that about ?0I j
of the capital stock had. practically j
taken to itself wings and flown away. I
The way in which this was managed !
was that paper was made by the tlder j
Heibst and his two sons and money ad- ;
vanced on it by the bank without ade- i
quate security. One of the notes is even
said to have been signed with the name
of fir:n which had been out of busi
ness for five years, and it is claimed
that the cashier knew this was the case.
Herbst has been president of the bank
since its formation in 183, and Seitz
cashier almost as lor.g as that, and it
was thought to be one of the soundest
firancia! institutions in that part ot the
State. Many poor persons went some
distance to deposit their money there,
because they believed it to be entirely
safe.
The first inkling the people had of
any difficulty was shortly over a week
ago. and it came in th very astonish
ing shape of the failure of the two
younger Herbsts, who carried oc a store
at Glen Rock. This directed attention
to the bank, and an immediate exami
nation showed that the practices above
referred to had been carried on uutil
over S50.000 was gone. The President !
and cashier were both compelled to re
sign and their places filled by others. A
large surplus being on band, an assess
ment cf 35 per ceut. ou the stockholder
has enabled it to live through its
troubles.
Seitz went to Philadelphia, being left
ennilt-RS, to make his home with bis
i son-in-law, Christiau L. Nanm?ister, or
2:210 North Seventh street, where he
was arrested and his bail Sxt-d at 55000,
which he could not raise. Hfrbst was
arrested at the sarue time in Glen Rock
and Lis two sons in Baltimore, where
they went to escape the storm of indig
nation among the Glen Rock people.
The elder Ilerbst was taken to Philadel
phia on Saturday and given a bearing,
but ws unable to raise the $50,000 bail
demanded, so he bad to go to jail. He
says that he is left without a cent.

A Reading Peddler's Awful Crime.
Frank Kerner, a pain cure peddler and
quack doctor of Reading, was sent to
the ounty jail at noon on last Sunday
week to answer the charges of arson and
homicide preferred by Coroner Denhard.
Kerner's dwelling was discovered to be
on fire on SuDday, and when the firemen
rushed in tb?y discovered Mis. Kerner
lying on the red dead, her legs burned
to a crisp. The bouse was dama-d to
the extent of but $200, but the loss of
life was suspicious, and there was intense
Interest in the inquest. Under direction
of Col. Horace II. Hammer, a veidict
was returned, finding that Francisca
Kerner came to her death by suffocation
and that bar husband wilfully ignited
the building with the deliberate purpose
of destroying the woman's life.
Kerner testified that the fire originated
from a stove pipe, but an examination
showed that it was not near there ; that
tae woman, who bad ben ill, had been
placed under a feather tick and that her
bedroom door was locked. Te fire w.s
centred about tn bed. Several witnesses
testified that Kerner hid frequently
threatened his wife. Dr. John Ege, who
made a post mortem examination, found
no marks of violence, save on the neck,
and thought that suffocation caused her
death. Half a dozen neighbors were
heard and gave Kerner a bad reputation.
The couple had two children.
Sunday night Coroner Oeuhard visited
Kr-rner in his cell, and the latter made
confession of the crime. He said :
"When my wife came home yesterday
afternoon I asked her where she had
been. 'In my bkin.' she replied. 'Well,
I'il skin you,' said I, and with that I
caught br with both hands about
the ner' h .1 choked her nnlil Bhe fell
limp at I uelpless to the floor. Then I
dragged her body up to the third floor,
laid it on the bed, covered it over, put a
lighted lamp under the bed and left. In
a few minutes the fire alarm struck. I
had trouble with my wife for years, and
finally strangled her to end it."
Kerner is 47 years old. Eighteen
months ago be arranged an infernal ma
chine to blow np and burn his own
house, in order to get the insurance
money, iut the plot was 3iscovered. It
i8 said his daughter, a young woman,
had to leave home on accnnt of his bad
behavior. Report also h3 it that he at
tempted to choke bis own father, in a
quarrel over some money. Uuon the
s'reogth of bis confession Coroner Den
hard swor out an additional warrant,
charging Keruer with murder.
An investigation of the honse of Ker
ner on Monday showed that he had tuad

Is Life
Worth Living?
That depends upon the
Liver, for if the Liver is
inactive the whole sy?
tem w out of order the
breath is bad, digestion
poor, head dull or aching,
energy and hopefulraiss
gone, the spirits are de
pressed, a heavy weight
exists after eating, with
general despondency and
the blues. The Liver is
the housekeeper of tha
health; and a harmless,
simple remedy that acta
like Nature, does not
conptipate afterwards or
require constant takinsr,
does not interfere with
business or pleasure dur
ing its use, makes Sim
mons Liver Regulator a
