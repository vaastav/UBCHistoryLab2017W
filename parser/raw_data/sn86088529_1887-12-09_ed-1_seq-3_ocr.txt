The only provision of law irom whicfc

cion that it was intended as temporary

In coubidering the question oi purchas
ing bonda es a means ol restoring to cir
cul ion the surplus money accumulated
in the Trebury it shouid be borne in
mind that premiums must of course be
paid upon such purchase that there may
oe a laifje part of these bonds held as in

any price and mat combinations among

Tne success oi this plan it is apparent
must depend upon tee volition oi the
holders of the present bonda and it is not
entirely certain that the inducement
which mu t be offered them would result
in more financial benefls to the govern
ment than the purchase of bonds > vhile
the latter proportion would reduce the
principal of the ebt by actual payment
instead of extending it
TO DJtPOSIT SURPLUS IN BANKS
The proposition to deposit the money
held by tbs government in banks through
out the country for use by the people is
it seeaiE to me exceedingly objectionable
in principle establishing too close rela
tionship between the operations of the
government treasury aud the business oi
the country and too extensive a coming
ling of their money thus fostering an un
natural reliance in private business upon
public funds If this scheme should be
adepttd it should only be done as a tem
porary txpedieut to meet on urgent ne
cessity Legislative and executive effort
should generally be in the opposite direc
tion sen should have a tendency to di
vorce as much and as fa3t as can safely

THE GRAVITY CF THE SITUATION
I have deemed it my duty to thus bring
to the knowleCgy of my countrymen
as well 03 to the attention
f f their represpnWives charged with
tlie responribiliiy of legislative re
lief the gravity of our financial situation
The failure or the Congress heretofore to
provide agalnsi the dangers which it was
quite evident from the very nature of
the difficulty must necessarily be produced
csupci a coudiion of financial distress
and apprenenelona ince your lass ad
journment which taxed to the utmost all
the authority and c xDedients within ex
ecutive ctntroi cud ttiese appear now to
be exhausted I > disaster results from
the continued inaction of Congress the re
sponsibility must rest where it belongs
The situation thus far considered is
fraught with danger which should be
fully relizd aud though it presents fea
tures of wrong to the people as well as
peril to tho country it is but a result
growing out of a perfectly palpable
and apparent ciuse constantly repro
ducing the same alarming circumstances
the congested national treasury and de
pleted monetary condition in the business
of the country
A RKMRDY FOR THE SITUATION
I need i iiy oe stated that while the
present silJ4lon demands a remedy we
can only be savedfrom a like predicament
in the iuUire by trie removal of its cause
Oar system of taxation by means of which
this surplus is taken from the people and
put in the public treasury consists cf a
tariff or duy levied upon importations
from from aoroad and internal revenue
taxes 1 vied up ju the consumption of to
bacco and spirituous and malt liquors It
must be conceded that none of the things
subjected to internal revenue taxation
are strictly speakiog necessities There
appears to be no ju > t complaint of taxa
tion by consumtrs of these articles and
there seems to be nothing so well able to
bear the burden without hardship to any
portion of the peoplei But our present
tariff laws the vicious iniquitous and il
legal source of unnecessary taxation
ought to be at once
REVISED AND AMENDED
These laws as their primary and plain
effect laise the price to consumers of all
articles imported and sub j set to duty by
precisely the sum paid for such duties
Thus the amount of the duty measures
the tax paid by those who purchase for
uee these imported srticles Many of
these things however are raised or man
ufactured our own country and the
duties iicwr levied upon foreign goods and
products are called protection to these
home manufacturers because they render
it possiole for those of our people who
are manufacturers to make these taxed
articles and sell them for a price equal
to that demanded for the imported goods
that have paid customs duties So it
happens that while comparatively a few
use the imported articles millions oi our
people who never use ond never saw the
foreign products purchase rind use things
of the same kind made in tnis country and
pay therefor nearly or quite the same en
hanced price which the duty adds on the
imported articles
THE DUTY IS A TAX
Those who buy imports pay the duty
charged thereon into the public
treasury but the great majority of
our citizens who buy domestic articles
of the same class pay a sum at least ap
proximately equal to this duty to the
home manufacturer
This reference to the operation of our
tariff laws is not made by way of instruc
tion but in order that we may be con
stantly reminded of the manner in which
they impose a burden upon those who
consume domestic products as well as
those who consume imported articles
fully considered as well as the preserva
tion of our manufacturers It may be
called protection or by any other name
but relief for the hardships and dangers
of our present tariff laws should be ae
vlsed with especial precaution against
imperiling the existence of our manu
facturing interests But this existence
should not mean a condition which
without regard to the public welfare or s
nationil exigency must alwavs insure
the realizstion oi immtnse nrofis ir stead
of moderately profitable returns As the
volume a diversity cf our nations ae

To these the appeal is made to save their

as the amount cf their wages till not

demanded nhouid be so measured as not

M4NY DAYS OF TOIL
The fAimer and agriculturist who
manufacture nothing but who pay the
Incresed price which the tariff imposes
upon everyagriculturai implement upon
all he wears and upon all he eats and
owns except the increase of his flocks
nnd herds and such things aa he
in his husbandry produces from the s il
is Invited to aid in maintaining the pres
ent situation and he Is told that a high
duty on imported wool is necessary for
the benefit of those who have sheep to
shear in order that the price of tbeir
wool may be increased Thev of course
ate not reminded that the farmer who
has no tcep is by this scheme obliged in
his purchases of clothing and woolen
goods t pay a tribute to his fellowfarmer
as well as to the manufacturer and mer
chant JScr is any mtntion made of the
fact tnat the sheep owners themselves
and their households
MUST WEAR CLOTHING
and use other articles manufactured from
tbe wool they sell at tariff prices and
thus as consumers must return their share
of this increased price to the tradesman
I think it may be fairly assumed that a
large proportion of the sheep owned by
the farmers throughout the country are
found in small fl ckB numbering from
twentyfive to fifty The duty on
the grade of imported wool which
these sheep yield is 10 cents each
pound if of the value of 30 cents or less
and 12 cents if of the value of more than
30 cents If the estimate of six pounds
be allowed lor each fleece the duty there
on would be GO or 72 cents and this may
be taken as the utmost enhancement of its
price to the farmer by reaEon of this duty
Eighteen dollars would thus represent the
increased price of wool from twentyfive
sheep and 3G that from the wool ot
fifty sheep and at present values this ad
dition would Emount to about onethird
of Its price upon its sale The farmer re
ceives this or a less tariff profit The
wool leaves his hands charged with pre
cisely that sum which in all its changes
sumer When manufactured into cl > fh
and other goods and material for use its
cost is not only increased to the extent
of the farmers tariff profit but a further
sum has been added for the benefit of the
manufacturer and the operations of other
tariff law In the meantime the day ar
rives when the farmer finds it necessary to
purchase woolen goods to clothe himself
and family for the winter When he faces
the tradesman for that purpose he discov
ers that he is obliged not only to return
in the way of increased tariff prc t on the
svool he sold aud which then perhaps lies
before him in manufactured form but he
must add a considerable sum therefor to
meet
THTSF JI1THKR INCPEASE IN COST
caused by a tariff duty on the manufac
ture Thus in the end he is aroused to
the fict that be sas piid upon moderate
purchase as a result uf the tariff scheme
wbich whCT ne sola his wool seemeei so
profitable more then sufficient to sweep
away all the tariff prefix he leceJved
npoa the wool he pniducd nd fold
When the number of isxmers engaged m
wool raising i compared with all the
fsrmefi in tne country andjthe fmli pro
portion thiy bear to our popuiatioi is
considered when it i = nude apparent that
m the cife of a large part of those who
cwn bZd p the benefit oi tae
present tariff on wool ic Indirect
an I wrru it must bo so
concede j that the increase of the cost of
living ciu ed by such tar ff becomes a
burden up m those with moderate means
and thi p > dr the employed anei tne un
emploj l the Pick acd the well and tbe
50uug aua the old ana that it constitutes
a tax which with relentless grasp is
fastened upon In clothing of every man
womiu ana child in tne land reasons are
suggested why the removal or reduction
ot mis duty should be included in the
revision of our tariff laws
THE COST TO THE CONSUMER
Speaking of the increased cost to the
consumer of our home manufacturers re
sulting from a duty laiel upon imported
articles of the same description the fact
in not overlooked that competition among
our domestic producers some times has
the rff > c5 of keeping the price of their
products below the highest limit allowed
by suci flty But it ia notorious that
tiis c < i ji tition is too often strangled by
comsL i us qaite pievslent at this time
and frequi tly cilled trusts which have
for their oojects
THE RKGULATION OF THE SUPPLY
asd price of commodities made and sold
by raemoers of the combination The
people cau hardly hope for any concidera
tion in the operation of theee selfish
scheme If however in the absence of
such combination a healthy and free
competition reduces the pi ice of any du
tiable article of home production below
the limia which it might otherwise reach
under our tariff law and if with such re
duced price manufacture continues to
thrive It is entirely evident
tUat one thing has been discovered
which should be carefully scrutinized in
an eff irt to reduce taxation lie neces
sity of combination to maintain the price
of sfcy commodity The tar < f furnishes
proof that some one is wiliiag to accept
lower prices for such commoditv and
that such prices are remunerative and
lower prices produced by competition
have proved that same thing Thus where
either of these conditions exist a case
would seem to be presented for an easy
reduction of taxation
TO PRKTENT SURPLUS REVENUE
The considerations wnich have been
presented touchng our tariff lnw3 are
imended only to emphasize an earnest
recommendation tnat the surplus reven
ues of the government ba prevented by
the reduction of our cuctom duties and
at the name time to emphas z a sugges
tion that in Kccomolithics this purpose
we may discharge a double duty to our
people by granting to them a measure of
rHitf from tariff taxation in quarters
where it is most needed and from sources
where it can be most fairly ana justly ac
corded
Nor can tne present action mado of
such consideration with any degrees of
fiiraes be regarded as evideuce of un
friendliness toward our marrufacturiug
inters f r ot any lack e > f appreciation of
their value and importance Tecs in
terests contitute a leading and most sub
stantial element cf our national greatness
and furnish the proud procf cf our
countrys progress 8u if In theemprg
etcy that presses upon us our manu
facturers are asked to surrender some
thing
FOR THE PUR1ICGOOD

well as a gtareful recognition ef t ad
vantages already afforded shot 5 lead
them to willing cooperation Nj ae
mand is made that they Bhall forego all

It is not proposed to
ENTIRELY RELIEVE THE COUNTRY
of this taxation It must be extensively
continued as the source of the govern
ments income and in a readjustment of
cur tariff the interests of American labor
engaged in manufacture should be care
forthe ssciirtceof the interests of his j duty as well a3 their ecligntened selfin
terest and safety when they are reminded
of the fact that the financial panic and
collapse to which the prttent condition
tends affords no greater th iter or pro
tection to our manufactures than to our
other important enterprises Opportun
ity for safe careful and deliberate reform
is now afforded and nonecf us should
be unmindful of n time when an tbssed
and irritated people heedle s cf those
who have resisted timely Mid reasonable
relief may insist upon a radical and
sweeping r ciflcation of their wrongs
1HE DIFFICULTY OF A REVISION

fair revision of our ttriff laws
is not underestimated Ic will le
quire on the part cf Cogrss
great labor and care and t specially a
broad and national contempinion tne
subject and a patriotic dirtgird of sm h
local tird selfish claims as aie unreason
able and reckless of the welfare of the
eutire country Under our present laws
more th n 4000 articles are subject to
duty Many of these do not in any way
compete with our own manuactui = s and
inicy are hardly worth Gt ention as sub
jects of revenue A considerable reduc
tion can be made in the aggregate by
adding them to thew free list
The tnxatiou of luxuries presents
no features of hardship but
the necessaries of life used eind consumed
by all the people the duty upon which
adds to the cost of living in every home
should be greatly cheapened The radi
cal reduction of the duties imposed upon
raw material used in manufacture or its
free importation is of coure an impor
tant factor in any effort to re
duce the price of these necessaries
It would uot only relieve them from the
increased cost caused by the tariff on such
material but the manufactured product
being thus cheapened that part of the
tariff now laid upon such product as a
compensation to our manufacturers on
the present price of raw material could
be accordingly modified Such reduction
or free importation would serve beside to
largely reduce the revenue
NOT INJURIOUS TO MANUFACTURERS
It is not apparent how such a change
can have any injurious effect upon manu
facturers On the contrary it would
appear to give them a better chance in
foreign markets with the manufacturers of
other countries who cheapen their wares
by free material Thus our ° people might
have the opportunity of extending their
sales beyond the limits of home consump
tion saviDgthem from depression inter
ruption in business and loss caused by a
glutted domestic market and affording
their employes more certain end steady
laborwith its resulting quiet and
NOT PARTISAN BUT PATRIOTIC
contentment The question thus imper
atively presented for solution should be
approached in a spirit higher than par
tisanship and considered in the light of
that regard for patriotic duty which
should characterize the action of those
intrusted with the weal of a confiding
people But the obligation to declared
party policy end principle is not wanting

President Cleveland is a very prolific
message wTriter His vetoes were ell
written by himself and he penned his last
Thanksgiving proclamation He does a
great amount of clerical wcrk and he
writes letters which other Presidents
give to their private secretaries
President Lincoln dictated the most of
his messages and what he did write he
wrote in a small hand easily read He
did not spoil his manuscript by revising
it and such of his writings as are in ex
istence Iook as thongh they had been
written by a lady
Johnson dictated all his message and
he could talk much better than he couid
write His forte was on the stump and
in conversation and cot at the desk He
thought very fast but wrote very slowly
A great part of his mes aces were eotten
up m conversation with Jere Black and a
Tennessee friend Judge Milllgan and
speaking cf these a large part of every
Presidents messase is Inspirpd by other
than himself A part of tbe S cretary cf
the Treasurys last report which accom
panied Clevelands message last year was
supposed to have been wricten by Manton
Marble and not by D ni ° l Manning
When Cleveland was nominated it ws
said that Manton Msible and Dan Lock
wood wrote his letter of acceptance but
his messages since then show that he is
amply able to do his own vn ing and
that he can think zs well as he can write

livrry In a day cr two Cvt > greg
called upon him and rerld ijo
bis addrts and is was per
haps the bitterest time ia Wasblrgton
life when Congrecs refu ed to do this
He was very unpopunr at the t r p on
account of the Jay treaty and h v wdB
persecuted so by the newspapers and by
his enemies in C3ncrcss3 tbAt he swore
by G that ho would rather b ° in h
grave than in the presidency Ha would
rather be on his farm than tbe Emperor
of the world and yet they were cnarging
him with waniDg to be a king
When he retired Corgrcss refused to
pass resolution complimentary to him
and Giles of Virginia said thv he felt
no regard or the President and hop d he
would retire J iha Htudolnh of Ic lan
oke at the same time gave tni toast at a
dinner
George Washington may he be darau
eey and upon outbursts of indignation
following he added the words if he
doesnt sign the Jay treaty
George Washington delivereel thirteen
messages during the eight years he
served and Jeff jrscn delivered twenty

seventeen and Monroe thirteen B th
Jicbson and Washington delivered fare

by Alexander Hamilton and James
Madison
Jacksons best messages e said to
have been plagiarized Major Lewis and
Henr Lee wrote his first icangnrsl and
Edward Livingstone wrote the funion
nullfication proclamation
Daniel Webster revised IIprisons in
augural and he tried to dictate to Tyler
what to write
Harrisons was the longest ioaugural
address ever delivered and it contained
over 8000 words Polk wrote the ncxS
loncest containing fully 20C0 words less
and the shortest ever delivered was that
of George Washington at his sreondterm
and it contained only 124 words The
character of a President cm be sometimes
told by his use cf tb personal
pronoun The conceit of Van Bnren
makes him use the word I thirtycight
times in his inaugural and Frnklic
Pierce used it twenty five times Wash
ingtons first inaugural contains twenty
egos and his second only six President
Cleveland was tne most modest cf the
Presidents He used I only five times
in his inaugural whereas Garfield used it
ten Hayes sixteen Grant twentyfour
Buchanan thirteen John Quincy Adams
fourteen and Monroe nineteen
Tbe greatest of our Presidents have
been the modestest and Lincoln at his
second term delivered an Inaugural in
which only once was a personal pronoun
u = ed
The Presidents messages have often
been stolen in the past and one of
Grants messages was read by the coun
try a day before Congress met A syndi
cate of newspaper men paid govern
ment printer 1000 for a copy of one of
Hayes messages and the correspondents
in the syndicate were to pay him 500
each for it One of the correspondents
however was beaten by the message be
ing telegraphed to the rival paper of
his town from one ot the
other towns to which it was fur
nished and he refused to pay the bill
The result was instead of getting 1500
the printer received only 1000 He was
never brought to justice for the theft and
I doubt if there Is a law which would
punish such a deed President Grant was
very ranch surprised when he saw the
message come out in advance of its de
livery He said nothing however but
decided that it should not happen a sec
ond time The next year the same thing
was attempted but failed and none of
the correspondents could get the slightest
T
3
trace of what the President would say or
how he would say it The night before
Congress met a messenger was sent from
the White House to Newspaper Eow and
the leading correspondents were Invited
to call there They all went and Pres
ident Grant met them in the east room
He had a big roll of mrauscrint in his
hand and there wa3 a humorous twinkle
in his eye He handed the roll of piper
over to them saying
B ys you sot ahead of me last year
hut I dont think you will do i again
It will be read in Congress this morning

The Presidents message is considered
very valuable not only to newspapers
but to brokers as well It outlines the
policy of the administrations and It may
cause r rise or fall of stocks During
Johnsons time a New York broker offered
825000 for an advarce copy of the Presi
