'3Y AC*OClAT*D PRESS)
WASHINGTON, Dec. D?One cent
postage for local first class mall deliveries
and a zone system of rates
for second class matter which is expected
to greatly Increase the
charges for magazines and other periodicals
having a nation wide circulation
are provided for in the annual
postoflice appropriation bill as j
virtually completed today, in commit-!
tee. The measure carrying approprl- j

witliin the limits of the postoflice.
city or rural district, would he cut
in half.
Radical Change.
The zone proposal for handling
newspapers and magazines. which
now pay a flat rate of one cent a
pound, is regarded as one of the most
radical changes in postage rates in
years. Tt divides the country into
eight zones with rate chargeable
ranging from one cent for 300 miles
to six cents for 1.800 miles or more.
The bulk of daily newspapers, the
committee believes, will not be affected,
because they do not circulate
beyond a 300-mile radius.
Hard on Catalogues.
A-fliong other previsions the bill
increases rate? for mail order catalogues
from two to eight cents a
pound, making them third class matter,
instead of parcel post; raises
the limitations on promotions of
clerks an*, carriers in first and second
class postoflices; broadens the post
master general's authority to deal
with lotteries, drugs and poisons and
increases the rural delivery appropriation
by $-1,000,000 over the $49,OOo.OOO
recommended by Assistant
Postmaster General Blakeslee.

Directing Factors.
Special attention was given by the

that the plant be placed "with special
reference to considerations of safety
In time of war." Another directing
factor was tlie advice of the arniy
war college that no military plant of
any considerable size should be established
east of the Appalachians,
west of the Cascades or Sierra Kevada
mountains, nor within 200 miles
of the border.

bankers In position to
know just what the farmers -have to

by the board.
Mr. Quick, of the board, in anstver
to T. Y. McGovern, farming field

The meeting here was for the purpose
of determining whether one of

HIGH GOST
(Continued from page 1, second sec.)
United States attorney in charge of
the investigation, as it -was thought
he "would today. Tho president is
continuing his study of reports of the

Mr. Anderson tonight requested cooperation
of house-keepers in his
work to the extent that they refrain
from purchasing, so far as possible,
articles of food that have reached the
highest peaks in the new high level
of prices and substitute cheaper commodities.
A reduction in the amount
of the highest priced commodities
bought by the nation's housewlfes,
It was pointed out, even If small in
individual cases, would make an aggregate
slump in the demand which
could not fail to bring prices tumbling
in the articles affected.
Need Another Commandment,
In addition, It was pointed out that
what the district attorney termed the
great American habit of wastefulness
intelligently checked would result in
reduction of the demand and a lower
level of prices.
"The American people," Mr. Anderson
said, "need an eleventh com"

"Trou shalt hot waste God's substances."
