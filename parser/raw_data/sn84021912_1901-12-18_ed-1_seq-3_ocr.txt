Special neetings of Supervisors.
Some doubt having arisen in the
minds of our citizens as to the law
governing the calling of special meet
ings of the beard of supervisors in the
absence cf the chairman, we quote the
following law upon the subject, from
the new Revised Statutes:
Section 41. Paragraph 968, Page 365,
says: 'The regular meetings of the
board of supervisors shall be held at
the county seats of their respective
counties on the first Monday of April,
July and October, and shall continue
from time to time until all the business
before them is disposed'of. The board
shall also meet cn the second Monday
after each general election to canvass
election returns.
"Sec. 42. If at any time after the
final adjournment of a regular meeting
the business of the county shall require
a meeting of the beard, a special meet
ing cf the same may be ordered by a
majority of the beard. The order shall
be entered upon -the records of the
board and the clerk shall give at least
five dajs' notice of such special meet
ing to any member cf the beard not
joining in the order.'
A New Year's Guide.
There is one book every one should
make an effort to get for the new year.
It contains simple and valuable hints
concerning health, many amusing an
ecdotes, and much general information.
We refer to Hostetter's Almanac, pub
lished by theHcstetterCo., Pittsburgh,
Pa. It will prove valuable to any,
household. Sixty employes are kept
at work on this valuable book. The
issue for 1202 will be over eight mil
lions, printed in the English, German,
French, Norwegian, Swedish, Bohe
mian and Spanish languages. lt con
tains proof of the efficacy of Hostetter's
Stomach Bitters, the great remedy
prepared' by the publishers, and is
worthy of careful preservation. The
almanac may be obtained free of cost
cf any druggist or general dealer in the
country.

' Attempted Mold Up.
Monday evening between G and 7
one of the boldest attempts at robbery
on record in this town occurred at the
corner of Main and First streets. Con
stable Jake Meadows was standing di
rectly opposite, across the gtreet, when
he saw one man strike another, knock
ing him flat cn the sidewalk. The offi
cer hurriedly crossed the street and
found the man bleeding profusely from
an ugly cut in the head-, and apparent
ly nnconscious. Other parties came up
and cared for the wounded man while
Constable Meadows went in search of
the thug. The latter, had run up the
street and mingled with the crowd at
tracted by the Salvation Army'in front
of Darling's jewelry store. As it was
quite dark the officer was unable to pick
out1 the man, but Johnny Balsz, who
had seen the fellow running up the
street, pointed him out and Meadows
arrested him and lodged him in jail.
The man assaulted was John Ruix, a
miner from Gold Rock. The fellow
who slugged him gives his name as
Henry Conner. The miner says that
Conner asked him for money, and when
refused, menacingly demanded money;
upon a flat refusal from Ruix, Conner
knocked him down. His evident inten
tion was to rob the prostrate miner, but
seeing Meadows coming toward him,
ran away.
Judge Reiff yesterday gave Connor
sixty days on the chain gang for as
sault. A nillion Voices
Could hardly express the thanks of
Homer Hall of West Point. Iowa. Lis
ten why: A severe cold had settled on

pletely cured me and saved my life. I
now weigh 227 lbs." It's positively
guaranteed for coughs, colds and lung
troubles. Price 50c aud SI .00. Trial
