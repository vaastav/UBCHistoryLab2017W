mat and undeveloped resource.
With something of truth it is pointed
out that Canada, one and united, is
yet a young government. It is scarcely
twenty.fite years sine it assumed tba
independent functions it now exercises.
With th; age and growth the Canadi
an are abundantly satisfied, claiming
that their record i mora marvelous
than the record of the United States
fur a like period under similar circum
stances. Then, too, it is said that while
this country has been rocked from cen
ter to circumference by la box troubles,
Canada has enjoyed perfect tranquility,
distinction has been made between the
impetuous rush for wealth in this
country and the slow and steady meas
ures taken to acquire it ia that country.
Ia view of the premises the Canadians
are not so anxious to be annexed as
the sensational articles ia some border
newspapers would indicate. They have
not the best system of government in the
world, nor are their industrial affairs
so intensely active as they: might be,
yet the Canadians are losing no sleep
over their anxiety for annexation.

Quoting from the Manufacturer,
published in Philadelphia, the Ameri
caa Economist prints this significant
paragraph on the late election: "It is
a very large concession to admit that
an actual majority of the people of
the cation desire to make the venture
that will cow be made with free trade.
There has cot been a fair national elec
tion in this country sinco the war
ended. The protectionist sentiment
of tne south has had ia all
these years no opportunity for
expression, and all tne states in that
region have been he'd solidly for one
political party by suppression of the
rights of American citizens. On the
other hand, the European interests in
New York city, co-operating with the
most corrupt political organization that
the world has ever, known, have been
able to override and defeat the wishes
of the truly American people of New
York state. The solid south, in con
junction with the votes of slum
wards in New York city and Jersey
City, cacried for the free traders aa
election which would have had a dif
ferent result if there had been fair
play and a free ballot. This victory,
then, is a southern victory, won by a
solid south acting in the presence of a
divided north, and with the conse
quence, of course, that the south will
be once more in the saddle. It i a vic
tory for the economical doctrines of
John C Calhoun and the state rights
doctrine of Jefferson Davis. Free trade
and state banks have won tho day
after thirty years of suppression."

Washburne's anti-option bill is post
poned in the senate. It would be
more dignified to take it up and de

some suspicion because of its author

A Kussian paletot or ovicoat may

of brigade and surah iruiiaed Witn
fur. This toiit as represented was
can post d of greea and drk brown
fabric and finished witn a truuruiug
of narrow blue fox fur. The front is
closed with hooks and eyes. The body
of this wrap is arranged ia folds with
bark brown faille-ottoman on a proper
lining and closed by high brocade fas
tenings at the sleeves. The girdle is
formed from folds of the material and
is closed under a large clasp, which if
it is desired that the toilet should be
rich, is made of old silver and st with
different sort of precious stones.

lined with fancy gold gimp or a com
bination of tinsel, gimp and beads.
Two widths of cashmere, or two and
a half yards, will make a cape with
three and a half yards of quilting and
half a yard of sarcenet or satin of the
same color to line the shoulder-piece.
Where the material is limp double
muslin should be placed between the
lining and material of the shaped
shoulder-piece for stiffening.
The fashion of today errs rather on
the side of quaintness, and every effort
is made to give an "old-time" effect,
but as the old fashions become com
mon the present quaint, old-fashioned
style will lose its principal merit, and
short waists and nchu arrangements
with clinging skirts will give place to
some newer fancy. Children are still
wearing the lengthened skirts and
loose frocks which appeared last win
ter, and the little, close-fitting coif
still take the place of hats and bonnets
in some cases, but the color must be
carefully chosen, as a full bright shade
utterly upsets the fashion of this type
of dress.
WOMEN VOTKKS.
- It is pleasant to be able , to empha
size the fact that there are? 10,000 Bos
ton women registered to vote on school
matter this year. It would be pleas
act, too, if these women could find the
paper up t3 the times in speaking of
them. It is rather worthy of an old
fashioned before-the-war aouthern
colonel than a modern Boston editor
to make that comment on the women
of Boston, which says: f 4 Perhaps the
exceptionally pleasant 'weather we
have been having during the time ap
pointed for registration has had an in
fluence to bring out the ladies. Or is
it because it is leap year?" It ii no
longer thought in good keeping in in
telligent circles to treat trls Question
either with mere gallantry or mere flip
pancy. Even the remonstrants, and
especially the well-descended among
them, regard it as a serious matter.
People talk about it earnestly and
simply, and as a part of the social ev
olution of our times a' matter neither
to be patronized cor jeered at. Eng
land's woman suffragists include both
Gladstone and Salisbury. Even the
continental nations of Europe, through
their beet minds, are studying the
question elaborately. Women have
lull suffrage ia Wyoming, Nova Scotia,
the Isle of Man, Chili, Ecuador ana in
live province "of Austria. They have
municipal suffrage in Austna-liun
gary and Croatia, in Prussia, Saxony
and Brunswick, and in bweden, rin
land and Iceland; in Russia, England
and Scotland, in all the English col
onies from Capo Colony to New Zea
land, and' from Australia to Canada,
and in the state of Kansas. In twen
ty-one of our state theyj have school
suffraee. It is a rather ignorant man
who now finds it matter for joking
that the mothers and 'wives of this
country should interest themselves in
publio questions. The world has
changed a good deal since Emerson's
scathing mot killed that antique tun
for good usage. Boston Transcript.
LITTLE WOMEN.
.Don't you worry about the little
woman! Just analyze her a bit before
you waste any great amount of sym
pathy upon her. That baby mouth
wasn't made in vain. Ever see one of
these little women stand up in a street
car, or carry her own parcels home, or
get in or out ot a carriage without bav
ing half a dozen men run to assist her?
And all just because she is a little
woman, aud has that helpless, implor
ing look, as if she couldn't staud the
least bit of troub e in the world. And
every man feels sorry for her and is
resdy to extend his sympathy and as
sistance. I've watched her I've made
a study of ber tricks aud her wars.
She just looks at a man out of thoeo
appealing eyes and he would walkover
red hot plowshares to assist ber. hen
I am born again 1 want to bo one of
those meek, helpless, sorrowful-eyed
little women and l helped to all the
good things of life because I look so
small and sweet and helpless. Little
woman! Little humbug.

FOR WOMAN'S ENFRANCHISEMENT.
Carrie Lane Chapman addressed a
fair audience at Good Templars' hall
yesterday afternoon on the subject of
tne need and duty or women to organ
ize in order to rectify the inequalities
now existiug between the sexes. She
gave as illustrations some cases which
had come under her own observation
hile a newspaper reporter in Saa
Francisco. She showed how unfair,
proportionately, are the wages of men
and women. She stated it as historical
that men's wage bad risen in propor
tion as they have been enfranchised
and claimed that to be enfranchised is
the icain remedy for the inequalities.

IVate McUaw. of London, a repre-

b surprised to know tbat there is mor
money spent try year for perfume
than for any ot&er toilet article at
least 75per cent wore than there i for
soap. Th trade bas become aa im
mense one. It i so great in fact that
if the coding congress does not repeal
the 60 per cent ad valorem, and l2 a
gallon for tpmta, on perfume, our
arm will probably start a branch fac
tory in the United Stales for the Amer
ican trade. We can do that cheaper
than we can pay the duty. Few per
sons know just how perfumes are
made. Many oon't care so long as
they can tret their favorite. The now-
ers are thrown into .vast tube, and
heated with a mixture of suet, tallow
and olive oil. The dead flower rise
to the top of the boiling mixture, every
E article of color and oil having been
oiled , out. The greasy mixture is
then a pomade, and is out into cans.
Afterwards it is dissolved in high wine.
and the compound is frown for six
months. The high wine does not
freeze, and it absorbs all th Oder from
the essential oils. The fatty aubtances
can be taken out. and tee peri u me re
mains to be further purified and bot

thst most nearly resemble tbe odor of
tbe flower from which they were ex
tracted. That is the acme of the per
fumer's art. The tendency of tbe
American manufacturer is often to
outdo nature. There is a lilly of the
valley perfume made in this country
that is so heavy as to be almost un
bearable. The taste for perfumes dif
fer; but tne bettor classes cave struck
a happy medium between the heavy
overpowering scents and the delicate.

of Iouia, the well-known democrat,
greenbacker and populist wheel horse.
Well. I'm clad the old gentleman is
making preparations to take care of
himself after bis term of office has ex
pired." "You wouldn't dare say that
to his face, John,"teaid M. C. Palmer of
Stanton. "Yes, I would, too," pro
tested Mr. Blanchard. "I told him be-
fore the convention that if he were
nominated he would be defeated by
50,000 votes, and be would have been,
too. No man ever bad a better chance
to do something for his party than Ed
win E. Winans had. lie might have
made Michigan democratic so demo
cratic that it would have remained in
the ranks for years, but be didn't. The
opportunity ot a lifetime was missed.
