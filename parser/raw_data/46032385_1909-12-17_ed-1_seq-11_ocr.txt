A dispatch to the Lincoln (Neb.)

nificance attaches to the action of

frankable and can be circulated with
out expense, save of printing. This
action is taken to mean that the con
servative republicans Intend to Btart
an active campaign in support of the
tariff bill passed at the last session
and in defense of tho organization
and course of the majority in con
gress. President Taft's Winona

the bill. There is .evidence in sev
eral quarters that the conservative
worm has turned at last and that the
LaFollette and Cummins section of
republicans are not to have things

these recommendations: "Owing to

their regulations regarding procur

countries where these conditions ex

to prevent professional prostitutes
from sailing to the United States.

of minors or the fraudulent or rorci
ble exportation of their women. In
the main, however, tho United States
government must rely upon its own
officials for prevention of this
traffic."
