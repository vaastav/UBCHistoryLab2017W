MR. PULLIAM SPEAKS.
Mr. Pulliam opened the speaking and
made one of the finest speeches ever

.higher morals in politics, and impressed
upon thole present that politics should be

tics in a purer sense.
Mr. Pulliam concluded by saving he
loved the principles of politics, but not
th? prac-tlce as it is lo-day.
Mr. Wallace, an old Manchester boy.
was Riven a cordial reception and made
an excellent speech. He paid a glowing
?tribute to Manchester, and also to th?}
ladies present. He said he wanted those
present to unde-rsiand that he was not a
?politician, but was simply an old bache?
lor from Richmond looking fer a wife
Among the belles of his sister city. He
spoke of the "Little Giant."" and said
they were both old bachelors, but Mr.

suspicion. He spoke in the highest terms

Mr. Wallace, in concluding., presented
Senator Barksdale. of Halifax, who said
Mit Wallace was trying to make the im?
pression on the ladies present that he
? Wallace; was a Richmond dude over
here trying to catch a girl. This sally
evoked a good amount of laughter and
.evened up with Mr. Wallace. Mr. Barks
?Jale spoke for better government and'
politics in a higher sense, and said a duty
every man owed t? his country was to
take an active Interest in the affairs of
its government, put better men in office,

the effects of unfair methods in elec?
tions. Mr. Barksdale said some very nice
things about Manchester.

the building, where one of the finest sup

address. Peroro tho Virginia Society of,
Georgia, in Atlanta, in celebration of
Genera! Robert E. Lee's birthday, on the
evening of ?M/oiiday, Jan-uairy 20th, next.
Tho anniversary falls on 3unday, and
the event will be celebrated on the. fol?
lowing day in Georgia, where it is a legal
holiday. Georgia was the first Southern
State making the anniversary of this
event a legal holiday, and the occasion
this year will be celebrated in fitting
style.
Some time before hia nomination as
Democratic candidato for Governor, Mr.
"Montague was selected by. the A'irginia
Society to deliver the address, and sinco
I his election to tho high position which
he will fill as Chief Executive of Vir?
ginia the Virginians In Georgia are all.
the moro gratified that" he will be their
distinguished guest.
Mr. W. N. Mitchell, southern agent of
the Baltimore and Ohio (R'aJlroad, and who
is president of the A'irginia Society In
Georgia, was In Richmond yesterday to
see Mr. Montague and arrange, the de?
tails of his visit to Atlanta ?Mr. Mitch?
ell is well known In A'irginia. his native
State, and lias many friend*, in the. Old
Dominion. He married the daughter of
Major Peter J. Otey. representative from
the. Sixth Congressional District.
Mr. Mitchell left last night at 11:31
? o'clock for his home In Atlanta. .He
j stated while here that the Virginia So
I clety how numbers among its members
some of the leading citizens of Atlanta,
| Sava.iin.ah, Macon, Augusta, and other
? cities In the State, and has a strong lii
j flu eneo in the State.
Mr. Montague, accompanied by his wife,
I Mr. Mitchell himself, who will come up
j to Richmond tn meet Ihe orator of the
occasion, and several representatives of
I tho press, will leave Richmond at 2:30
? o'clock Sunday afternoon. January 13th;
over Che Southern Railway in a private

arriving in Atlanta the next morning. The
Governor will be tho guest cf the scB
ciety from the time he leaves his home
In this city until he returns here. While

The celebration will be on an elaborate
scale, and will bo attended by many prom?
inent people in Atlanta, and other parts
of Georgia, including members of the
Daughters of the Revolution, Daughters
of the Confederacy, Confederate Veter?
ans, Sons of Confederate Veterans, and
others'.
The event will he held in the Grand
Opera House.
?ossip Caught in
Jhe Jiotel Robbies.
Mr. Charles P. Wortham, a visitor to
this city from Chicago, was talking of
living expenses in Richmond.
"Outside, of the hotels, of course, I
understand the actual cost of living in
this city is marvelously low. I am now
stopping with a gentleman who lives In
Grace Street, has a beautiful home, a
wife and three children, and he tells me
the actual cost of living to his family,
clothes excepted, is less than fifty dollars
a month. And I may <?ay be lives wel'.
"I don't believe this would be possible
:n any other city in the world. I mean,
of course, where one lives exactly the
same way. And that Is where so' many
men make mistakes. If they would keep
away from the large cities, they could live
better all the year round, and have more
comfort in every way.
"Vet fifty out of a hundred young men
have at some time in their life a vague
desire to descend upon and capture a
large city. I had it myself and went to
Chicago. Everybody has it and nothing,
let me tell you, is worse for them."
considering the fact that Mr. Wortham
is worth about two hundred thousand
dollars, which he has made himself, the
force of his argument is somewhat shak
W h en a man tells mc that forty-three
? 'lillion miles is a short distance and
: stands ready to prove it; when he g? ammo
j quently announces that the globe upon
which we live is nothing more than a
! stray speck in the plan of the universe
and when he commets and destroys solar
: 3ystems with astounding ease, then one
I is forced to the conclusion that he is
| merely a vacuous h-.e in eternity.
"In" "Sartor Resarlus," Thomas Car
! lyle says that mankind can explain, the
making of worlds, but. by no stretch, of
his imagination can he figure how an
apple is put in a dumpling. I don't
tappen to know whether or not Mr. Gar
rett P. Serviss. the eminent astronomer,
could put an apple in a dumpling, but
j he is certainly an encyclopaedia of In?
formation as to .low the creation or woritfs
camo to pass.
He told me ..lese things last night:
? The world we inhabit, and the solar sys
i tern we knew was once gaseous matter.
! There is a great deal of hot air about it
now.
This ? gaseous matter began whirling,
and as it whirled it contracted.
This contraction resulted in the throw?
ing off of an infinite number of whirling
rings.
Each whirling ring gradually contract?
ed Into a planet.
As they were- formed each planet cooled
until It became inhabitable.
They will keep on cooling until finally
they will freeze, then will come a tem?
porary end to it all.
The sun is now cooling, but there Is a
spark of comfort in the thought that It
will tako about ten million years to
freeze.
After hearing all these things, I went
out and stumped my toe on some gaseous
matter.
"What makes a man laugh?" asked a
gentleman at Murphy's last night,
''Politics.'' I suggested.
*'No. I mean what is humor or wit as
wo know it?" he continued. "So man
has ever been able to satisfactorily explain
just why certain things are funny and
certain things ore not. Some have said
surprise will make one"lauph, but sur?
prises sometimos kill. Others have said
it is a realization of mental superiority,
but Shakespeare was funny. Others have
said other things, and now what is It?
"I'll tell volt," lie added graciously.
"Hypotlietic?l'.y it is a vagu? comprehen?
sion and. indulgent knowledge of tho In?
finite mastcryo f mid over matter; an
intellectual condescentlon resulting- from
human egotism descending to Its original
nlane and ? throwing aside of snackles
whicli have bound us to conventionali?
ties."
Then ho took a long breath.
theTh?ve eloped.

. CHINA SINCERE*
Pu Chun Deposed by Imperial Edict from
Heir Appareticy.
(By Assoclsted Pr?s*.)
PEKIN, Dec. 2.?The imperial edict
deposing the forme^ hoir apparent. Pu
Chun, son of Prince Tuan. the author of
the Boxer troubles, is generally considered
as tho strongest proof yet given of the
sincerity of the Empress' leaning towards
reform.
Considered with previous edicts; this last
ono appears to corroborate the belief
among Chinese officials that the Empress
sees the error of her anti-foreign policy
of recent years.
Conversing with representatives of two
of the foreign Powers, Prince Ching caid
China would oppose Russian control of
Manchuria if any of the Powers would
support her in so doing.

"Lost River," which will be at the

tho merit of taking a fir instand as "a

tremendous sensations, such as the bi?

Doctor of Divinity.
In a recent issue of the Religious Her

in regards to conforming the title of Doc?

if the trustees of our college realized
the scholarship and ability.of some of our
country pastors, they would, no doubt,

lings and sprouts are too young and green
to stand such deep marks. The-'Se marks
militate against their growth, and in some
instances the gashes have been so deep
as to let out all sap and render the poor
little sapling perfectly dry. As timber

LONDON PRESS ON MESSAGE.
No Fault Can Be Found With Its Language
Toward British Government.
LONDON, Dec. I.?The London dally
papers this morning, looking at President
Roosevelt's message from the point of
view of its literary-power and the wealth
of weighty matters discussed, regard it
as one of tho most characteristic and
remarkable messages ever sent to Con?
gress. At the same time the papers rec?
ognize its conservative and business-like
moderation and that no attempt has been
made, as the Morning Post remarks, "to
Strike an attitude or carry his listeners j
away."
On tho whole, however, the newspapers
are skeptical of any great outcome from 1
the President's efforts in the direction of
reform o fthe trusts, anti-anarchism or
reciprocity, the Idea being that the Sen?
ate will cfTcctualiy step in and prevent
any great changes in th?3 existing system.
Most of the papers remark upon the tone
of exultation adopted by President Roose?
velt In dealing -with the canal question, j
but they do not show the slightest dispo?
sition to cavil thereat.
The Times, in an editorial on the mes- !
sage, says it is distinguished by a clear-j
ness, firmness and deserved ? strength
which do not require the rhetorical pyro?
technics of popular platitudes. "We cer?
tainly have no fault to find," says the
Times, "with his language towards the
British Government, or indeed with his
foreign policy generally. It is not easy
to see how. the exclusion policy can be j
enforced. The. United States would to?
day b? poorer in many of the finest ele?
ments of its national character jf an en?
trance fee had been demanded of every
settler in the early days of colonization.'
The?Times thinks that reciprocity and
the trusts will prove thorny problems and
that the President's cautious handling of
the latter will disappoint some of the
passionate, social, reformers.
