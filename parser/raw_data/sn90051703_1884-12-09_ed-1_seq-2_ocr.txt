'1 UE8DAY, - DECEMBER it, 1884.
Ii- the papera are mi index to th
sentiments of the people, Socorro i
convulsed with joy over the incorpo
ratio 1 1 decision of Judge Hell.
Till', press of the southern part of
the Territory speak most cheerin gly of
the mineral out-put and prospects
that section. New .Mexico will event
ually he the greatest mineral produc
ing state of the Union.
What prominent Democrat (?) was
it in Santa Fe who .said he would
spend $1,500 to heat a certain Demo
crat on the county ticket at the late
election, because the latter had been
a consistent opposer of the ring foi
years ?
Nl'-'VKR was man or official more
universally and thoroughly despised
than Axtell is in this community; in
fact we might say the feeling is shared
by nine-tenths of the people of the
Territory certain lv where he and bis
acts as judge arc known.
A LADY of New Haven advertises
for a husband, Offering her heart and
$50,000 for the right article. Come
west, dear holy, where you will find
any quantity of noble, vigorous man
hood suffering for just such a dicker.
Heart not so essential as form and
"figure" $50,000.
A SPECIAL from Santa Fe ii, forms
us of the burglary of the auditor's
office Sunday night. As we predicted
shortly after the election of Cleve
land, tires, burglaries, etc., would be
in order in public offices, and they
have commenced iii .Santa Fe. Wt
will have more to say of this tomor
row.
Nkah Simla Hita, Socorro county,
siiys the Bullion, a prospector named
Williams died the- other day from the
effects of a bite inflicted by a skunk,
The malady partakes of hydrophobia,
the victim dying ;i most horrible
dearth. This is the third instance we
have heard of in the Territory within
live years.

Hon. Henry Wat terson , of the LOUIS-
ville Courier Journal, in t he January
number of the North American Re-
view. It will undoubtedly treat. of
the result Of the late election, a
viewed by the south and as affecting
thai section politically and finan
cially. 1 1 will he an Interesting paper
CopYJNd our article of the othei
morning, wherein we stutetl we had
information from Wasnington to the
effect lh.it Axtell wonlil he dismissed
shortly, the Silver City South west
Sentinel adds :
We trust, Webb, that all this is true,
ami iiiat the territory is to be re
lieved of this incubus at last. If he
goes, we wiM he ready to give you full
credit lor the overthrow of the dema
gogue. Fvks President Arthur is accused
by some of the papers as being not
much of a Republican, if Mr. Blaini
represents the "grand old party," as
its organs and leaders claim, there is
certainly very littlo of the organisa
tion left, and Ke OOUld blame no man,
not even the president, from denying
party fealty. When "Me and Jack"
went down the Republican party was
i ngulfed with lliein.
It is stated that in the Cerrillos dis-
trlol tWO-thirds of the present loca
tions will he abandoned on the 1st
of January. Mack Range,
True, and why. Not because 1 1 1 tL
leOtiOH is wanting in mineral, bul
booause oi the outrageous decision of
Axtell, that a patent issued on agri
cultural land known to be mineral
holds and the mineral passes with the
patent a decision so ridiculous as to
shame any one of less bra.rn impu
dence and supreme VSttitjF than Ax
tell. The mluen Of thai section as n
elaSS are poor, not able, to cope with
the Santa Fe gang backed by Axtell
on the bench, hem e had rat her aban-
Jon their claims- upon aomeof which
i hooeansls of dollars and years el' toil
mve been expended than wage this
unequal legal warfare. Thus his
asinine or vicious ruling in this case
has cost Santa Fe county many valu
able citizens and much wealth, de
veloped and undeveloped. This pois
onous human parasite, either as a
eitiienoran official, paralyses every
healthy, material interest and Indus
try With which he conies in contact,
and it is a matter of wonderment with
all w hy the administration or the Al
mighty permits him to afflict this ei
an v other community.
We freely give space to the follow
ing card from Mr. Knaebel, concerning
the land deal in which lie was sought
to be defrauded out of his portion of
the profits in the transaction. We
were certainly informed that Max
Frost had a "working" interest with
fíov. Sheldon, hut would not even
de him an injustice (there is enough
against him that is true) in refusing
to correct the impression ; while, as
for Dr. Long well, knowing him to bl
very avaricious we can still see how
Sheldon might have imposed upon his
confidence and informed him that
the arrangement was perfec tly satis
actory to Mr. Knaebel. At any rate,
since Mr. Knaebel returned to Santa
Fe he has probably become more fa
miliar with the facts, and the follow
ing is published in justice to all :
Santa Fk, Dec. ti, 1S.S4.
Editor Gazkttk : While deeming
it improper to discuss In the news
papers the merits of my equity suit
now pending against (overnoi Shel
don, I feel it my duty to inform you
that in your recent article on the sub
ject, you are in error in your reflect
ions against Col. Max Frost, and in
the statement that 1 aver that he and
Dr. Longwell wore parties to the al
leged fraud. So far as 1 am informed
Gov. Sheldon is alone responsible for
the attempt to exclude me from the
benefits of a business transaction
which originated with me and in
which I considered him in good faith
as my partner, Respectfully,
Jno. H. Knai: ni:!.
On yesterday morning's train, pro
ceeding eastward, was ex-United
States Surveyor General Atkinson.
Il is possible he has been called to
Washington for a sett lenient, as he
has been reported behind as an official
to the amount of several thousand
dollars. He will not fly so high at
the national capital as this time last
year, when on for reappointment,
nourishing recommendations from
the gang at Santa Fc, hacked by
Frost's laudatory editorials in the
Review and Chairman of the Territo
rial Republican Committee Hrceden's
personal efforts. More of the crew
will travel the same road, but nota
few will switch ofr at Penitentiary
villc. Though somewhat "independ
ent" in our mode of worship we be
lieve that is the fashionable thing In
Las Vegas now we still have an
abiding faith In the wisdom and power
of an all wise being, and confidently
look for matters to "even up" right
rapidly in New Mexico. The Lord
certainly made a good beginning in
"downing" Blaine and Flkins.
Grani county's hoard oi commie
sioncrs have at last taken definite
action looking to the collection of
taxes from the Southern Pacific rail
mad. Judge Bristol, about a year
ago, it w ill he remembered, rendered
a decision that under the six years
exemption act of the legislature of
178, railroads constructed within the
Territory after the passage oí said act
could not be held liable for laxes
during the time fixed for said exenip
tion. This decision was affirmed by
the supreme court of the Territory
and there the matter has retted until
recently. Grant's commissioners
have determined to appeal to the su
preme court of the United States and
have placed the management of the
ease in the hands of Mr. S. M. Ashen
felter. The progress of the suit will
he watched with no little interest, as
its final determination will materially
interest all roads now operating in
.New Mexico. Mr. Ashenfelter is to
be congratulated upon the compli
ment paid him by his selection as at
torney in so important a suit.
Tin: live stock feature of the New
Orleans exposition will be on a scale
ef grandure and liberality that char
acterises other departments of this
world's fair. Forty-two thousand
dollars have been set apart as premi
ums for live stock, divided as follows:
Horses, $12,000; breeding and dairy
cattle, $li,000 fat stock (cattle, sheep
ad hogs), 1(),(HHI, sheep 5,600; hogs,
$','A); poultry and pet stock ró.miO,
and dogS MM0, This liberality in
premiums ought to and will make
the live stock department a very at
tractive feature of the show.

In making our claim this year that 1
the Journal would he the only paper
in the southwest to publish the mes
sage in lull the morning after its de-I
livery in congress, as it was last year,
we overlooked the fact that a news
paper man is now at t'ne bead of the

yes r published the message simulta
neously with the .Journal.
Thanks for the col lection, neighbor.

Certain prominent Democrats of
Santa Fe were heard to remark the
other day that they were sorry our
self is at the head of the has Vegas
GaZRTTH; and well they may he.
We know them by their tracks in the
sand; can tell them by their hades as
far as visible, anil if they attempt the
transfusion of Democratic blood into
the withering body of the RepUbli
can Santa Fe ring, they will find u.
waging as relentless a warfare upon
them ns we have their scheming
friends in the past. Cleveland wite
elected upon the anti-ring issue, Jo
seph was elected upon the same plat
form, and we Intend to sec the doc
trine carried into practice, so far as
within us lies.
YbSTBRDAY afternoon a Ga.ktti:
representative accosted about thirty
of the principal tax-payers of the west
side on the incorporation question.
There wns a slight preponderance in
favor of a city governinest among
those who were positive on the sub
ject, "while several expressed them
selves as indifferent. We suggest, as
on a former occasion, thai the matter
be submitted to a yotc or its agitation
cease, incorporation litis its advan
tages, probably greater than the draw -backs,
and Inasmuch as the city has
once had a taste her people can vote
intelligently on the question. Some
contend, and very sensibly, that un
