WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4. 1889;
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Harrison's recommendation
in regard to building up our merchant
marine deserves the careful considera?
tion of congress. To build up a trade
with foreign countries, we mu*t be?
come acquainted with the people there,
and nothing will facilitate au inter?
course of this kind moio tluiu a mod?
erate assistance of the mail, carrying
service. In regard to strengthening
our navy and coast defeuses he mani?
fests laudible concern, and is in full
sympathy with that movement which
will keep the government at work on a
navy until this country wi'l have
the best warships atloat ami enough of
them to protect us from insult and in?
vasion. He favors general education
and wants the negro to receive the
beuefits of governmental aid. As the
Blair bill promises to do this while cir?
culating a good many millions through?
out the South congress will probably
pass that or a similar measure this
session. On civil service reform the
president seems to be all right, bat
there are no doubt many democratic
ex-office holders who would much pre?
fer that he had been possessed of his
present ideas at an earlier period of his
administration.
A SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT.
The opening of the sessiou of con?
gress yesterday was attended by no
surprises until toward the close of the
day's proceedings in the house. The
business of the senate was of a rou
liue aud formal character. Vice-Ffcsir
dent Morton's occupancy of the chair
of the president of tbe senate was the
most noticeable event. In the house
Mr. Reed was made speaker by a vote
of 1GC as against 154 for Mr. Carlisle
and one for Cummiogs, of New York.
Speaker Reed acknowledged the honor
conferred oc him in a brief and appro?
priate speech, and the sessiou began
with everybody in a good humor. A
flurry was produced, however, wheu
Mr. Cheadle, a republican, bolted the
candidate ol his caucus for chaplain,
and moved the substitution of the
name of Mr. Milburu, the blind demo?
cratic chaplain of the last house. Sev?
eral republicans joined Cheadle,and with
their help the democrats after a spirited
Btruggle, eiectedjMilbum by a vote of
100 to 155. The incident shows how
difficult it may be for the republicans
to carry party measures in the present
house. The majority when all mem?
bers are present being not over eight,
and under ordinary circumstance lik ly
to fall to two or three, or even disap?
pear altogether, they are subject to all
sorts of accidents. The caprice of
oue offended republican, the sickuess
of another, the absence ol a third, acd
an accident to a fourth may at auy
"time break a quorum or make a divis?
ion result the wrons way. Arbitrary
measures with the minority are clearly
impracticable under the circumstances
brought forcibly to the public notice
in the election of a democratic chap?
lain yesterday.?Baltimore Sun.
The great German guumaker
Krupp is said to be looking for a loca?
tion in this country for a branch of his
gun foundry, and with its im?
mense resources in coal, iron and
other mineral there is no better place
in the United States for the location of
such an establishment than right here
iu Roanoke. Sooner or later our own
government will build a gun factory
somewhere Jin the interior for the man?
ufacture of heavy ordnauce, and when
this is decided upon Roanoke will he a
strong competitor for the place. In
fact,the more we ponder upon them the
greater the possibilities of our beloved
mountain city become.
A Distressing Case and Happy Cure
