Foreign Comment on the Presi
dent's Message Is Not All
Complimentary.
CUBANS ARE DISAPPOINTED
The Eaellok View I That the Chief
Executive la Hampered hy the
Constitution Jaiiunese
Are Pleaard.
London, Dec C President Roose
velt's message to the American con
gress occupied the most prominent
place in the leading newspapers Wed
nesday morning, and has attracted
widespread attention from government
officials, diplomats and the public.
The prevailing tone of the comment
is favorable, particularly, with refer
ence to the president's statements on
the Japanese question, the newspa
pers emphasizing the president's warn-
ing of a possible use of the federal
forces for the protection of Japanese.
This feature of the message has giv
en especial satisactlon in official Jap
anese quarters, where it is pointed out
that Japan is satisfied to await the out
come of the Issue between the state
and federal authorities.
The - Telegraph says the president
speaks out resolutely and fearlessly,
knowing that the democracy likes a
man who is not afraid to be its mas
ter.
The Standard says the most slg'
nlflcant feature of the message) is
that the president is constantly find
ing himself "up against" the Amerl
can constitution. Farsighted observ-
ers have long since seen that the
United States has outgrown its
cradle, yet the conservative sonti-
ment of the most conservative peo
ple on earth clusters strongly around
the constitution. If there are to be
any reforms they can only result
from a drastic reconstruction of the
political system and the prospect of
their realization appears somewhat
remote.
Paris, Dee. 6. The morning papers
generally do not comment on Presi
dent Roosevelt's message to the Amer
ican congress, but give to it the most
prominent place on their pages and
-publish despatches from New York
recording the feeling of dissatisfac
tion over the president's references
to the San Francisco situation.
Havana, Dec. 6. The message of
President Roosevelt to the American
congress was published in the local
press Tuesday afternoon
Commenting on the message the
Post, Wednesday will say: "That
part of the message relating to Cuba
Is hardly all that was expected by
those who thought that the present
opposition to the president's Cuban
plans would call forth an appeal
stronger than usual for the prompt
evacuation of the island and the res
toration of the Cuban republic.
Is the president getting lukewarm
regarding Cuba? Possibly not, but
whether or not there is certainly not
that ring of .enthusiasm in his words
regarding Cuba always noticeable in
his utterances.'
OBJECTED TO HIS "AIRS."
'Texaa Cowboy Attempt to Hang- a
Negro on a Santa F Train
la Kanaaa.
Topeka, Kan., Dec. 6. Two Texas
cowboys tried to hang a negro named
John E Lewis, on Atchison, Topeka
& Santa Fe train No. 17 west bound
Tuesday night and were only pre
vented by Lewis leaping from the
train at Topeka Lewis is a
resident of Wichita, and a member of
the Knights of Pythias. It was the
badge of this order that he wore that
aroused the Texans' Ire. They did
not like to see a "nigger putting on
such airs," they said. Three times
had the cow punchers gotten a rope
around the neck of Lewis only to be
frustrated by his cutting it off and
dodging. No aid was given by the
passengers who at the first flourish
of revolvers fled to other cars.
The Indian Started Home.
Topeka, Kan., Dec. 7. John
Thomas, an Indian from the Pottawa
tomie reservation, fifteen miles north
of here, Wednesday morning boarded
a northbound Rock Island passenger
train which was standing at the To
peka station, opened the throttle of
the locomotive and started home. A
test train from the West was due and
the possibility of a serious collision in
-the yaids was averted by the action
of a switchman, who boarded the fly
ing locomotive and after a fierce
struggle with the Indian, succeeded in
flopping the train before any damage
has been done. The train was well
filled with passengers at the time.
Thomas was later placed under ar
rest. Great Territory Ga Well.

RESOLUTION ON QUESTION
Would Have Senate Declare That
Statea Mar Conduct Their
Schoola In Any Manner
They Dealre.
Washington, Dec. 6. President
Roosevelt '8 discussion of the San
Francisco school situation in his mes
sage was received with great dissastis
faction by the California delegation
in the house. The members of the
delegation from that state are unani
mous in their declaration that no
treaty rights have been violated in ex
cluding Japanese from public schools
attended by white children.
Representative Hayes Bald that if
any treaty of the United States pre
vents California from running its
schools as it sees fit the treaty is
clearly unconstitutional and should
not stand.
A meeting of the California delega
tion will soon be held to discuss the
San Francisco situation.
The suggestion in President Roose
velt's message that naturalization be
extended to Japanese is extremely dis
tasteful to the California delegation
in the house.
Senator Rayner Tuesday introduced
the following resolution on the Jap
anese question:
"Resolved, that In the opinion of the
senate this government has no right
to enter Into any controversy with
any foreign government relating to
the public school system of any of
the states In the Union;
'Resolved further, that it is the
opinion of the senate that there is
no provision in the treaty between tha
United States and the government of
Japan that relates in any manner to
thU subject or in any way interferes
with the right of the state of Call
fornla to conduct and administer Its
system of public schools in accor
dance with Its own legislation and,
Resolved further, that it Is the duty
of the president of the United States
to notify the government of Japan
and to notify any foreign government
with which the question may arise
that the public educational Institutions
of the states are not within the Juris
diction of the United States and the
United States has no power to regu
late or supervise their administration.'.
It ia expected by the officials here
that a judicial determination of the
rights of the Japanese in California
to enjoy school privileges will be se
cured through tha Institution of an
other suit in San Franctsco before the
federal court. This will be brought
by an individual and will probably
take the form of an application for an
injunction directed to the school board
enjoining- them from denying Japan
ese children from entrance to the pub
lic schools so long as those privileges
are conceded to children of other na
tionalities. The department of Jus
tice will it is expected, be represented
in any such proceeding.

NO ADEQUATE AUTHORITY
Interstate Commerce Commission
Can Not Remedy Car Shortage.
It Will However Inatltnte an In.
dairy to Locate the Blame tor
Condition Which Prevail.
Washington, Dec. '5. The intentions
and attitude of the inter-state com
merce commission respecting the car
shortage in the northwest are made
clear in a letter addressed to Senator
Hansbrough by Chairman Knapp
which says:
"The inability of shippers to secure
cars for the movement of their traf
fic Is reported from various parts of
the country and amounts in some sec
tions, as you observe, to almost a
calamity. This matter Tias given the
commission special concern although
we appear to be without any adequate
authority to deal with such a situa
tion. We can exercise no direct
power to compel inter-state carriers
to furnish adequate equipment nor are
we prepared at this time to recom
mend specific legislation upon this
subject."
Chairman Knapp said the commis
sion could perhaps award reparation
for damages resulting from failure to
supply sufficient cars, but the power
to do this Is not altogether certain
and he says "It would seem to be
rother more suitable and efficient for
aggrieved shippers to bring suits In
the courts in the first instance.
"We have, however, ordered an In
vestigation of this matter of car short
age and will prosecute It with the ut
most despatch. Already one or more
agents have been sent to the north
west and It Is expected that hearings
will take place In that region within
the next two weeks. This appears to
be the most effective course the com
mission can take and you may be as
sured that everything will be done
within the scope of our authority to
bring about the earliest possible re
lief." Senator Hansbrough has written
several letters to the commission call
ing attention to the car shortage, de
claring the situation to be so serial's
as to amount almost to a calamity in
some sections and says that if the
commission Investigated at once
there would be no difficulty in locat
ing the blame. If any.

BIRD TRAVELS WITH . GIRAFFE
Rtd Billed Weaver Constant Compan
ion of Animal Skyscraper.
The red-billed weaver bird is a con
stant companion of the giraffe, perch
ing itself upon the withers and flying
along when its host takes to flight,
and immediately alighting again on
its back at the first opportunity. The
only means of defense or offense by
the giraffe is hy means of its hoofs,
and the blows it can deliver by kick
ing are of tremendous power. The
old males during the breeding season
fight in this manner a good deal, and
the female employs the same means
in defending her young against car
nivorous animals.
Giraffes are very swift of foot, and
it requires a very fleet horse to run
them down. Experienced hunters,
however, charge them at full speed,
and by this means are often able to
run into them, and if the giraffes are
fat they will soon become "blown.
When running, the tail is twiBted in
a corkscrew fashion over the back and
the hind legs at each step are thrown
on the outside of the forelegs, giving
a very grotesque straddling appear
ance. The giraffe Is mute, but he has
a very keen sense of hearing and of
smell.
LIMB RAW AS PIECE OF BEEF.
Suffered for Three Years with Itching
Humor Cruiser Newark U. S. N.
Man Curad by Cutlcura.
"I suffered with humor for about
three years off and on. I finally saw a
doctor and he gave me remedies that
did me no good, so I tried Cutlcura
when my limb below the knee to the
ankle was as raw as a piece of beef.
All I used was the Cutlcura Soap and
the Ointment. I bathed with Cutlcura
Soap every day, and used about six
or seven boxes of Cutlcura Ointment.
I was thoroughly cured of the humor
in three weeks, and haven't been af
fected with it since. I use no other
Soap than Cuticura now. H. J. Myers,

Scheme Worked Out Badly.
Congressman Sulzer represents a
densely populated district on the East
side of New York city. It occurred to
him some months ago that though
there are no gardens in his district
some of his constituents might grow
plants in boxes placed on window
Bills or fire escapes, so he sent an as
sortment of seed to the inmate of a
model tenement house owned by one
of his friends. The latter met him
a few days ago and said: "See here,
Sulzer, I want you to cut out that seed
business. Its the limit!" "Why,
what's the matter?" asked the aston
ished Sulzer, and he explained why he
had sent the seeds. "Oh, you meant
well, all right," returned the friend,
scornfully, "but when I visited the
place the other day I found that about
ten families were raising cabbage, cu
cumbers and tomatoes in the. bath
tubs."
Tea on the Down Grade.
Tea drinkers are finding scant en
couragement in a report recently
made by a large tea exporting house
n Yokohama to its American cus
omers. Incidentally it indicates that
he United States is not atone In fac
ing Increased cost of living. The re
port says: "Owing to the rapidly in
creasing cost of living in Japan labor
costs more, and in consequence cul
tivation of the tea gardens is less
generous and extensive than formerly,
and less care and skill are expended
in picking and curing the leaf. Hence
the average quality of the teas now
offered for sale Is below that of sea
sons prior to the war, and for the
same reasons we are not likely in the
future to see any reversion to the
excellence of former years." New

NO MEDICINE.
But Change of Food Gave Final Relief.
Most diseases start in the aliment
ary canal stomach and bowels.
A great deal of our stomach and
bowel troubles come from eating too
much starchy and greasy food.
The stomach does not digest any of
the starch' food we eat white bread,
pastry, potatoes, oats, etc. these
things are digested in the small intes
tines, and if we eat too much, as most
of us do, Ae orgaas that should di
gest this kind of food are overcome
by excess of work, so that fermenta
tion, indigestion, and a long train
of alls result
Too much fat also is hard to digest,
and this is changed into acids, sour
stomach, belching gas, and a bloaty,
heavy feeling.
In these conditions a change from
indigestible foods to Grape-Nuts win
work wonders rn not only relieving
the distress but in building np - a
strong digestion, clear brain and
steady nerves. A Wash, woman
writes:
"About five years ago I suffered with
had stomach dyspepsia, indigestion,
constipation caused, I know now,
from eating starchy and greasy food.
"I doctored for two years without
any benefit. The doctor told me there
was no cure for me. I could not eat
anything without suffering severe
pain in my back and sides, and I be
came discouraged.
"A friend recommended Grape-Nuts
and I began to ubo it In less than
two weeks I began to feel better, and
inside of two months I was a well
woman and have been ever since.
"I can eat anything I wish with
pleasure. We eat Grape-Nuts and
cream for breakfast, and are very
fond of it". Name given by Postum

THEY ALL FAVOR IT
Des Moines Convention Unanimous
for Election of United States
Senators by Direct Vote.
PERMANENT ORGANIZATION
Tlilrtr-Seven Leoialatnrea Will Be
Aaked Thla Winter to Demand
That ConKreaa Call a Couatl
tntlonnl Convention.
Des Moines, Iowa, Dec. 7. The Inter-state
Senato lal amendment con
ference before adjourning Thursday
completed a permanent organization
which will conduct a campaign to se
cure from congress a call for consti
tutional convention to consider the
question of having senators elected
by a direct vote of the people.
Thomas A. Cheshire of Des Moines
was named chairman of an executive
committee of five to take charge of
the movement. His associates are
Thomas J. Kernan of Louisiana, Frank
C. Goudy of Colorado, W. R. Ellis of
Oregon and C. M. Kimbrough of In
diana. The work of the organization will
be directed towards securing from the
37 state legislatures that meet tnis
winter, demands UDOn congress for
calling a constitutional convention to
which the conference unanimously
committed itself. The organization
will be known as "The Interstate
Senatorial Convention." Congress
man Strode of Nebraska is Its first
president
The conference committed Itself
only upon the specific senatorial elec
tion amendment and prefers not to
have a constitutional convention. If
eoneress acts and submits this spe
cific amendment to the states, then
the convention will be dissolved.
The Dowers of the executive com
mittee and the purposes of the con
vention were set forth as follows:
The executive committee shall call
to its assistance one or more of the
delegates from each state and shall
nrpnare nn address to the legislature
of each state that has not heretofore
nrtPfl on the subject, requesting the
adoption of such resolutions as may
be presented from time to time ny

states of Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Il
linois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Ken.

Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire,

Orpimn Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Utah, Washington and
Wvomine which have already acted
to renew and continue their efforts
to the end that the election of United
States senators by direct vote of the
people may soon be an accomplished
fact.
The deliberations of the conference
were harmonious. Twelve states were
represented by 33 delegates.
After stating that there exists ana
has long existed a popular demand
for the election of United States sen
ators by direct vote of the people and
that It has been Impossible to secure
ftip Tipnfssarv action by Congress sub-
mititng to the several states an amend
ment to that effect because or the re
fusal of the senate to take the neces-
sary action, the resolutions declare.
n it therefore resolved: That,
while this convention would much
prefer that congress should submit
to the suveral 6tates a proposed
amendment to the constitution for
the election of senators by direct
nte of the people, so that the states
might pass upon it as a single ques
tion vet. inasmuch as the senate per
sistently refuses to submit such
amendment, it therefore earnsstly re
e.nmmends that the legislatures of the
several states do, in pursuance of ar
ticle 4, of the constitution of tne uni
tri stntes. make application to the
congress to call a convention for the
purpose of proposing amendments
to the constitution of the United
States.

FILLING UP THE CANADIAN WEST.
The American Settler Is Welcomed
to Canada.
A number of the leading newspa
pers on this side of the line have been
noticing the growth of the CanadUi
West in recent years, and draw atten
tion to the fact that there seems to be
no abatement of the Influx of settlers
to that great grain-growing country.
The Buffalo Express thus refers to the
subject:
"Canada West continues to grow.
There were 4,174 homesteads entries
there in July of this year, as against
3,571 in July, 1905. Canada plumes
herself over this fact, with becoming
pride. But what appears to make our
neighbors happiest Is the statement
that of these 4,174 homesteaders,
1 212 were from this side of the line.
Little is said about the 97 Canadians
who recrossed the border to take up
homes in Canada West, or of the 808
from Great Britain, or of the 1,236
from non-British countries. It ap
pears that the Item in this July report
that makes Canada rejoice most i
this of the 1,212 American farmers
who decided to try their fortunes in
Canada West.
"The compliment is deserved. The
1,212 were mostly mom Dakota and
other farming states, and go Into
Canada fitted better than any other
class of immigrants for developing the
new country. They take capital with
them, too, say Canadian papers proud
ly. In every way, they are welcome
over there." '
As the Express well says, the
American is welcomed to canaaa, ana
the reasons given are sufficient to in
vite the welcome. The AmerlaT
farmer knows thoroughly the farmfiig
conditions that prevail In the Cana
dian prairie provinces, and is aare
of every phase of agricultural devel
opment in recent years.
In practical knowledge of what is
wanted to get the largest return for
labor and investment he is by long
odds superior to any European set
tler. He knews what is required to
bring success, and he is able and will
ing to do It, and his future causes no
apprehension to the successful Cana
dian farmer. The agent of the Cana
dian Government, whose address ap
pears elsewhere, says that the differ
ence between the manners and cus
toms of the farmer from Dakota, Ore
gon or Minnesota and the farmer from
Manitoba, Saskatchewan or Alberta
is not nearly so marked as that be
tween the farmer of the Maritime
provinces and the Ontario tiller of the
soil. Hence the welcome to the free
homesteads of the Canadian West,
and there are hundreds of thousands
of them left, that is extended to the
settler from the Western States.
