One of the horrible results of miscegenation-
has occurred In Topeka.
!A white woman, the legal wife of a
negro. Is dead, evidently having: taken
her own life. This catastrophe should
not be without Its lesson.
Important if true. It Is reported
that the members of congress are
generally In the best of humor and
good feeling' at the beginning of the
present session. If they'll only keep
that way much good work may be
expected from them.
The necessity of President Roosevelt
sending an Illustrated message to con
gress Is not patent. He is one of the
few prominent men in the world who
never mince words and whose argu
ments need no diagrams, unless it is
the possible exception of those he cares
to make on woman suffrage.
Governor Johnson of Minnesota may
be classed among the optimistic
Democrats. He does not believe that
the leaders of the Democratic party
' were cast down by defeat. This is as
suredly true of Mr. Bryan, who is
willing to run for the presidency again
if the "conditions," whatever that may
be, warrant it.
that official robbery has been the
ruination of that land, one of the
world's most favored isles. He says
that the' military corruption whicn
has prevailed In the country has
brouH-ht bee-e-arv to the people. He
declares that thievery runs riot In all
ranks and the late wife of the de
posed president. Nord Alexis, was the
prime grafter in the earth's chief
graftland. If only one-half of the
things that Mr. Bonsai writes about
concerning the way the affairs of Haytl
have been mismanaged were true, and
doubtless all of the things he says are
the exact truth, it is no wonder that
there is a revolution of some sort in
Haytl every other minute.
SCHOOL. BOOKS.
Resolutions are pending before the
local board of education which will
probably be adopted at a future meet
ing and which will place the board on
record as favoring a repeal of the
present state text book law and the
enacting of one in its place that will
provide for the state publication
of text books to be manu
factured at the state printing plant.
The members of the Topeka board of
education do not think the present
text books in use throughout Kansas
meet the needs of the public schools.
That they have been of this belief for
some time has been plainly apparent
to the parents of school children In
this city who have beencompelled to
provide them with a set of school
books as adopted by the state text
book commission and also with a set
of supplemental book covering the
same studies which the local board of
education has deemed necessary.
And perhaps if the school books-
were printed by the state the same
condition of affairs would prevail.
The agitation which has been going
on for the printing of the school
books by the state has not taken the
form so much of dissatisfaction
with the books which have been
selected by the state text book com
mission as with the price which is
charged for them. The principal
argument in favor of the state print
ing of school books has" been to the
effect that if this plan were indulged in
the pupils in the schools would not
have to pay near as much for the
same class of books as they are now
compelled to pay because of
as members of the American political
and Industrial system. The senate has
so far inexcusably resisted the efforts
of the administration and the house of
representatives to deal equitably with
the Filipino producer. It Is time for
more enlightened and generous coun
sels to prevail."

Some actors must get a lot of sat
isfaction these days over the fact that
eggs are so expensive.
Many an individual who has the build
of a man fails to come near living up

The Hutchinson News thinks that "In

is likely to become a favorite air in
Kansas.
There is musip in the air around
Hutchinson these days but it is in a
sad and mournful strain. The Hutchin

Here's the right kind of a newspaper
slogan. Charles Garten says his paper
at Nickerson will not be bound by party
ties nor controlled by any faction.
As for the print paper "famine,"
which the manufacturers predict, the
Ottawa Herald says "The prophecy will
be fulfilled this way: There won't be a
tamine, but the price will go up.
Lawrence has something new, or more
properly speaking, decidedly old, to
marvel at. The skeleton of a prehis
toric horse, with three toes on each
leg in place of a hoof has been mount

From the temper of the people as ex
pressed through the columns of the
Great Bend newspapers something will
happen soon if the Santa Fe does not
put up a new station in that town.
While they're about It the Great Bend

An agitation has been started by
the New York Chamber of Commerce
for the appointment of a state com
mission to make another examination
of the conditions now surrounding the
great life insurance companies of the
country which are domiciled in the
Empire state. Surely they haven't
gone wrong again?
"Fashion note: Parisian dressmak
ers having developed what is known
as the straight front In dress are now
bending their energies, or rather their
customers bodies, to a straight back.
This new style, straight in front and
back, gives a woman's body the sem
blance of a tube. It will probably be
popular because it is a new style, but
surely not for any continued period.
Too much attention to nonreliglous
problems, wrong methods in handling
boys in Sunday schools, wrong finan
cial systems, materialistic ideals and
retention of unfit members are among
the causes given for the absence of

nent Baptist ministers. In a recent

truth In his conclusions.
Dr. Lyman Abbott, who is to be Mr.
Roosevelt's boss when he becomes an
associate editor on the staff of the
Outlook, has come to the defense of
football In a stirring fashion. "I do
not know enough about football," he
aid recently In a sermon delivered at
Tale, "to know whether there are
more deaths and accidents than there
onght to be in the game, but I -do
know that real courage can not be
developed without danger, and if real

field, the sacrifice is worth the peril."
When the rulers of one country
visit another they are generally greet
ed most effusively and given the best
sort of a time. But that is evidently
not to be the case with Mr. Castro,
the dictator of Venezuela. He is not
to be permitted to even land on
French soil until he has . formally
apologized to France for the expulsion
of one of her representatives from
Venezuela some time ago and until he
makes arrangements for the immedi
ate payment of some old debts that
Venezuela owes to France. This is
Just the way that Castro should be
treated.
the state printing plant a commis
sion of some sort would have to be en
trusted with the selection of the
books that will be printed for the use
of the school children. In all like
lihood expert educators would have
to be engaged to prepare certain Of
the text books for state printing for
most of the school books extant In the
country are protected by copyright.
So it is reasonable to suppose that
if the state did engage In the print
ing of its own books the selection of
them that' might be made would not
be agreeable to all of the school
authorities in the state and especially
to the Topeka school board which has
shown such a great predilection In
the past for selecting supplemental
books to the regular ones adopted by
the state authorities. But this prac
tice, which is unnecessarily expensive
to the parents of school children, can
probably be stopped by the state If it
undertakes to print the school books,
by the insertion of a clause In the law
which will prohibit local boards from
adopting books supplemental to the
ones chosen by the state authorities.
Something exceeding novel as an In
cident to a divorce, suit has been hit
upon by a banker In Lynn, Mass. His
wife has sued him for divorce and in
order to provide himself with funds
to pay the probable costs of the action
the gentleman in th'e case has organ
ized a subscription dance for which
he is selling tickets at $5 per ticket.
He expects to sell a thousand tickets.
If his hopes are realized in this re
gard he ought to be able to turn his
divorce troubles into quite a remuner
ative affair. The chances are that this
scheme will become popular among
folks of a certain class who hold the
marriage relations lightly and are no
more worried over a divorce than the
least inconsequential thing on the face
of the earth.
Stephen Bonsai, a foreign corre
spondent of the Chicago Tribune who
la now In Haytl, writes to his paper
JUSTICE TO FILIPINOS.
"Secretary Wright's recent appear
ance before the ways and means com
mittee of the house of representatives to
urge a reduction of the duty on Philip
pine sugar indicates that fresh efforts
are to be ' made by the administration
to have Justice done to our far eastern
dependency," says the New Tork Tri
bune. "It is a manifest discrimination
against that dependency that Hawaiian
and Porto Rican sugars should be al
lowed to enter the United States free
of duty, and that 75 per cent of the
Dingley tariff rates should be imposed
on sugars produced in the Philippines.
Congress has twice shown its intention
to incorporate the Philippine archipela
go Into our domestic system by extend
ing the coastwise navigation laws to
commerce between the Philippines and
this country. It has been compelled
twice to postpone the date on which
the extension was to occur, because of
the patent impropriety of holding the
Philippines to be domestic territory for
navigation purposes while excluding
them as alien territory from the benefits
of untrammeled commerce.
"The last Philippine tariff bill, pass
ed by the house of represenetatives by
a tremendous majority, was defeated
by Indirection in the senate. Philippines
committee, a body strangely responsive
to the exaggerated fears and represen
tations' of domestic interests unduly
alarmed at the threat of Philippine
competlon in sugars and tobacco. So
far as sugar is concerned, the impor
tation from the Philippines is insignifi
cant. At the present tariff rate it does
not pay to send Philippine sugar to the
United States, and the annual Philip
pine production is only a fraction of
the amount of sugar annually consum
ed In the United States. The domestic
sugar producers can hardly hope tc
supply the domestic market. They are
only holding their own in turning out
one-fifth of thaotal supply, while the
other four-fifths some from Hawaii and
Porto Rico (free), from the Philippines
(at 75 per cent of the Dingley duties),
from Cuba (at 80 per cent of the Dingley
duties), and from Brazil, Java, the
West Indies, and Europe (at the full
Dingley rates). The Cuban and alien
sugars make the market price here, and
so long as the Philippines do not send
enough to crowd out the alien prod
uct or diminish the importation of the
Cuban product, they will not interfere
with the status of the domestic indus
try, any more than Hawaii and Porto
Rico have so far Interfered with it.
"It is certainly practicable to admit
a certain proportion of the Philippine
sugar product free, and thus give the
Filipinos an assurance that we are
ready to deal with them commercially

Wichita likens herself as to a camel
in comparison with Topeka, for during
the month of November the liquor sales
in the Peerless Princess as reported by
the druggists aggregated about 4,700
while those in Topeka were more than
14,000. An explanation of this may be
found in the fact that in all likelihood
liquor may be obtained promiscuously
in Wichita while in Topeka there is not
a Joint of any kind running and any
person who wants . liquor has to go to
a drug store and sign up for it.
There is but. one negro family in
Cawker, that of Mrs. Luella Bowen,
but it was very fortunate for the com
munity that she lived here during the
process of construction of the new
school house. It was necessary to em
ploy a number of colored men from
Kansas Citv as helpers on the building,
and had it not been for Mrs. Bowen it
is probable that the workmen .would
not have found a place to board while
here. Under the circumstances every
body was well taken care of, and the
work on the building progressed with
out delay. Cawker City Ledger.
Tom Clayton has a man at his place
shucking corn, Ben Walker, who for
five days husked 110 bushels daily ana
one day it made 130. Tom was telling
about this in the club rooms the other

vear-old boy who started out in the
morning on John Woods place and got
back in at 7 o'clock Wltn ii Dusneis,
It may have been a man who got back
at 11 o'clock with B bushels but any
wav the way Jake told it he was a
cornhusker. This started the talk
about cornhusking and Chas. Allison
who is some pumpkins himself when it
comes to work, decided that he could
throw corn out of a wagon by hand
faster than any man could husk and
throw it in. Reg Russell has a man
on his place who he says can beat any
man at the game ana cnarue sdoui
decided to try him. The meeting broke
up when some one told of a man who
husked so fast for nine hours that he
kept an ear of corn in the air all that
time. Great Bend Item-Rustler.

FORESTRY IN JAPAN.
Just at the time when this country Is
beginning to struggle with the problem
of husbanding its forest resources, of
protecting its mountain slopes, and of
Improving the waterways, it is inter
esting to know that the Japanese have
successfully attacked the same prob
lem, Defore the land suffered severely
from the evil effects following de
forestation. The far-sighted people of
Nippon have foreseen the results of de
struction of their extensive mountain
forests, and have safeguarded them
selves by placing all of these under
government control.
The practice of forestry has been car
ried on in Japan for a longer time than
in any other country. For 1.200 years
the people of Japan have been planting
and growing forests, with a success
that has been little short of marvelous.
Under careful management, the Jap
anese forests yield very high financial
returns. This high yield is only made
possible by the close utilization of
every bit of the tree so that scarcely a
twig is wasted, and by the improve-
ment of the growth of their forests by
carefully conducted thinning and tend
ing. The woods are first thinned at the
age of thirteen years, and then every
five years after, that up to the time of
the final harvest, at 120 years.
It was with the opening of the hith
erto inaccessible mountain forests that
the Japanese government became most
Intensely interested in forestry. The
mountains were still government land.
so all that was necessary to protect
them was to place proper restrictions
on the sale and cutting of timber. This"
was effected by declaring the forests
on the steep slopes as reserved forests,
In which the only cutting should be
done under government direction. The
forests on agricultural lands, not need
ed for protection, are classed as avail
able forests, and here the cutting is not
so carefully restricted.
Thus Japan has effectually prevented
the stripping of her mountain slopes
before any great damage has been
done. In some districts, where the
mountains are near the towns, the steep
slopes have already been cleared, and
this has resulted in floods and the
washing down of the soil from the
slopes on the farm lands. But these
cases have been exceptional, and hav.
merely served as a warning; which
Japan has heeded before it was too
late to prevent widespread destruction.

THE DIFFERENCE.
The city government is a business
proposition. That being true, the city
government needs plain business treat
ment. The treatment given it under
the old system of ward councilmen se
lected through the system provided by
city politicians is not businesslike It Is
political. The system proposed under
the commission form provides for
nonpartisan government by trustees or
commissioners who would handle tne
city's business Just as a business cor
poration handles its business. It is the
difference between business and poll-
tics. Wichita Beacon.
FROM OTHER PENS
DYSPEPSIA ON THE RUN.
The long and "bitter fight between
the advocates and opponents of vege
tarianism Is being fought out to
scientific showdown: In the laboratories
of Yale university; - and preliminary
reports indicate ft" remarkable, and
possibly a revolutionary advance in the
science of dietetics. As a result of
somewhat startling experiments. Prof.
Chittenden announces that there is
no limit to our power of producing
organic substances by purely chemical
synthesis. He has discovered the
secret of separating the tissue build
ing proteins of both flesh ana vege
tables, and by artificial chemical
means reproducing the various pro
cesses of the stomach and assimilative
organs.
With such a perfect tool of investi
gation, the mysteries of dietetics
should soon be numbered with the
problems solved. Not only will the
conflicting pretensions of the vegetar
ians and the flesh eaters be weighed
In this new scientific balance, but a
host of dietetic fads and fancies, from
the gospel of buttermilk to the evangel
of raw beef and cereals, will, by this
new method, be put to the test of ex
actness, and it Is a safe bet that a vast
quantity of advertising matter will
have to be rewritten. The forecast
indicates dark and gloomy days ahead
for dyspepsia. Washington Post.

REBATES AND MORALS.
Twenty-five years ago there were no
railroad tariffs. Every railroad man
ager got what he could out of each cus
tomer. The maxim current among rail
road managers themselves was to
charge "whatever, the traffic would
bear.!' But that was simply a rule for
getting the maximum rate. They also
wanted the maximum volume of traffic.
and to get that they would make any
sort of concession that might be neces
sary. Each shipment was a matter of
bargaining.
So far the Standard Oil was accus
tomed years ago to drive sharp bar
gains with the railroads that often
forced competing oil concerns out of
business, it was no worse than other
shrewdly-managed shippers. But it is
credibly asserted that the Standard Oil
continued its practice of extorting con
cessions from the railroads after the
community began to make laws on the
subject, and many of its contracts with
the railroads seem injurious not only
to the Standard's rivals, but to the
railroad's shareholders, for which rea
sonthere is some curiosity to know
how the Standard managed to get such
large favors, and the' commissioner of
corporations charges the Standard with
low and underhand methods of injuring
the business of its rivals. These things
account for the keen interest with
which Mr. Rockefeller's examination is
watched. Philadelphia Record.
KEEPING YOUNgTaND OLD AGE.
The continued youth of President
Eliot of Harvard is one of the most
striking and attractive things about
him. He has shown none of-that ossi
fication of intellect that so often ac
companies old; age.- Within the last
few months, for instance, he has made
a plea for the commission form of city
eovernment a comparatively new Idea
and has announced his conversion to
total abstinence after a lire time of
moderate drinking.
Ir. this capacity for keeping young he
resembles such men as Gladstone and
Leo XIII. , Unhappily, the number is
small. The politician who will adopt a
new cause when he is above 70 as Glad
stone did in the case of Irish home
rule, or the theologian who will keep in
touch with modern tenaencies aner ne
has nassed three score, as Leo did. Is
rare. Fortunately modern research does
not condemn men to aging in mind as
thev do in body. It is believed that
this distrust of men above maturity is
a result of an attitude of mind rather
than of physical decay. Kansas City

Rivals of Panama Canal.
Humboldt's report of ten practi
cable canal routes across the Americas
has never been fully Justified. We
have not heard of anybody's seriously
proposing to send the Lusitania from
ocean to ocean by way of the Missis--sippl,
the Missouri, a lock canal over
the Rocky Mountains, and the Colum
bia river, and while Peru maintains
an Atlantic steamship commerce from
a port on the Maranon there is no
tl. ought, so far as we know, of uniting
that river with the Pacific. Neverthe
less, the number of transcontinental
transportation routes, by rail or canal,
is steadily being Increased, and bide
fair, one of these days, considerably to
surpass the ten of Humboldt's waterways.-
The-last few weeks have seen two
Important new lnteroceanlo routes
completed sufficiently to be put into
practical use, both of which are so
near to our. own shores as to be of
much practical Importance to our
commerce, and as they both lie be
tween our southern borders and the
Isthmus of Panama they must be con
sidered as In a measure rivals and
competitors of the canal which we are
pressing to completion. One of these
is a railroad across Guatemala, a
country which Is too often regarded as
a negligible quantity, but which In
fact is of vast wealth and occupies one
of the most important strategic po
sitions in the western hemisphere. De
spite the prejudice which many feel
against Guatemala and President Ca
brera, this new road is to be reck
oned with as an important commer
cial and strategic factor. ,
We have hitherto repeatedly called
attention to the Tehuantepec railroad.
which follows a route once marked
out by Hernando Cortez for an inter
oceanic canal. It was a few weeks
ago opened for freight and passenger
business. It is much nearer to our
gulf ports than la the Guatemala
route, and Its Pacific terminus is also
nearer to our Pacific ports, and It is
very accessible to and from the Atlan
tic by way of the Bahamas and the
Florida channel.
That these roads will prove to be
important competitors of the Panama
canal is not to be doubted. Of course
they will not and cannot obviate the
need of the canal, for, after' all, they
are land routes, and persons and goods
carried by them must debark and re
embark from and upon ships, with all
the Inconvenience involved in those
processes, and, of course, they do not
in any degree facilitate the transfer of
vessels from one ocean to the other.
We should be surprised, however, if
they did not both secure and hold
much patronage of a character to
which rapidity of transit is supremely
important," for It will, of course, al
ways be much quicker to get from the
North Atlantic to the North Pacific by
way of Tehuantepec or even Guate
mala than by way of Panama. But
we shall also not expect to see such
rivalry make Panama unprofitable.
On the contrary, the increase of traf
fic which the roads will facilitate will
promote traffic on the canal as well,
and" the world will see the time when
all these and perhaps some additional
interoceanic routes are busy to the
full extent of their capacity. New
York Tribune.
THE EVENING STORY
Expensive to Be an M. P.
Of course, the corrupt practices act
has done much to prevent the spend
ing of huge sums of money at the ac
tual elections. Expenses then -' are.
we believe, effectually as . well . as
nominally controlled. But if the
"short, sharp shock" of heavy dis.
bursement at an election is a thing
of the past, we understand that a new
kind of disguised -bribery has more
than taken its place. The demands
upon the pocket of every pliable- mem
ber are unceasing. His ' annual sub
scriptions and donations -amount to
more, perhaps, than ever before. It
has been said that in some cases it
costs as much to have a constituency
as to keep a steam yacht or a pack of
nounds. But even ir this an exaggera
tion, it is, we are assured, by no means
uncommon for constituencies to cost
their member between $10,000. and
$15,000 a year. In other words, it
used to cost a rich man $50,000 down
to get Into parliament. Now it costs
him $6,000 at the election, and $10.-
000 a year for the five years which
is- the average duration 'of a parlia
ment. Naturally, it is not easy to
come at the details. We can hardly
expect members of the house to tell
us what they spend; but it is possible
tnat some past members will be erood
enough to state In the public interest
what amount they were compelled to
spend each year in order to secure
their seats. London Spectator. .
The First Turkish Parliament.
The parliament-will certainly prove to
be a polyglot affair, and it is auite
possible that in the multiplicity of par
ties or factions formed on racial, rellg.
ious, or linguistic lines there will be no
dominant majority, either homogeneous
or composite, to direct the general
course of operations. . Even so, the sit
uation may be no worse than that
which v has been seen in the Austrian
reichsrath many a time, with Germans
and Czechs hurling epithets and ink
pots at each other. Indeed, if this first
parliament were to accomplish nothing
and presently to be dismissed, Turkey
would not be doing worse than Russia,
where the first and second parliaments
were dismissed in disgrace.. The not
unreasonable expectation Is that Tur

- Winston Churchill's Jest.
A Joke of Mr, Winston Churchill's at
the expense of a self-opinionated army
officer has Just been recalled. The Inci
dent occurred during a dinner in South
Africa, and Mr. Churchill and the offi
cer were seated side by side. Through
out the meal the latter was airing his
views, until at last Churchill could
stand It no longer. "Do you, know," he
said quietly, "I met a man today who
would gladly forfeit 50 for the pleas
ure of being able to kick you."
"To kick me, ..sir!" exclaimed the as
tonished soldier. "I must ask you to
tell me his name at once."
"Oh," replied Winston. "It was a poor
young fellow in the hospital who has
lost both his legs by the bursting of a
shell." London Oplnlop .
Won by a Turnout.
(By Ruth Campbell.)
With a derisive honk the car shot
past the pedestrians and vanished in a
cloud of dust. Dorothy Stanford re
garded It angrily, and stamped her
foot.
"That's the third time he's done
that thing. I 'believe he's doing it on
purpose. If he passes us again, I'll "
What she would do was not told, for
at that Instant there sounded another
warning and now a gray car shot past
in pursuit of the red.
"They have a right to the road,"
defended Lawrence Mayling indulgent
ly. He could afford to be generous to
a defeated foe, since Dolly had eschew
ed automobiles and had taken to pe
destrlanlsm. Mayling had no car, but he was a
good walker and the holder of the dis
tance championship which was con
tested every Saturday.
The Marathon races had roused the
local love of athletics, wherefore the
distance runner and the distance
walker were the local heroes.
This had given Larry Mayling his
chance with Dolly, for his long legs
carried him over the ground at a
splendid speed and he left all others
far behind.
All summer, with Dudley Blount and
Paul Frazer contending for Dolly's
favor, he had seen little of her. She
had loved the swift, easy motion of
the high powered cars, and she had
been unable to resist their charms;
but since the athletic fad had struck
Chesterton the owners of cars were de
cidedly out of It.
Not alone were they regarded as
persons too lazy to use nature's own
means of locomotion, but in addition
they got themselves very much dis
liked by speeding past pedestrian par
ties and raising a dust that made
walking unpleasant.
"They should be kept off the course
at least," said Dolly severely. "The
roads are for the people and not merely
for a few selfish persons who have
money enough to buy cars."
Mayling smiled, but said nothing. Not
so long ago Dolly had protested against
the deliberate fashion in which pedes
trians occupied the road to the annoy
ance of autoists.
Now the shoe pitched the other foot.
and she had changed her opinions-
There might, after all, be a chance to
win her hand before the walking fad
died.
The situation was not due to the fact
that Mayling cared for Dolly while she
did not care for him, but Stephen
Stanford. Dolly's father, had made a
fortune in Chesterton, and Mayling ar
gued that the easiest way to win a
fortune was to marry one.
With the coming of the athletic craze
he had seen his opportunity to win and
he had pressed his advantage hard.
Now toe was training Dolly for the la
dies' race which was to be a feature
of Thanksgiving afternoon, and he was
making the most of his opportunities,
. Blount and Frazer, whom he chose to
regard as his disappointed rivals,
persisted in running their cars over the
triangular course on which the races
were to be tried, and Dolly waxed more
and more angry each time the cars
passed them with the "honk" that was
capable of so many interpretations.
What made it worse was that sne
really cared for Dudley Blount and
she was both hurt and angry at the
calm fashion in which he had aban
doned all effort to win her favor when
she had decided that walking was the
thing.
Dollv had expected that ne wouia
make some fight against the new fad,
but instead he had laughed when she
urged him to take up the exercise.
"You would do well to leave the
car In the garage for a while,"- she
counseled. "Walking Is good for you."
"I get plenty of that when the car
breaks down," he reminded her. "I
guess I'll stick to wheels, Dolly and let
you do the walking."
Dolly had shrugged her shoulders
to show her Indifference, but she was
none the less hurt and angry, and
proceeded to. show marked interest In
Mayling ,in order to teach Blount a
lesson. that he. seemed too indifferent
to learn.
As Frazer's red car passed them for
about ttie tenth -time In their circuit
of the course, Dolly had a sudden in
spiration, -i
"Mr. Blount In his gray car cannot
be far behind," she said. "Let us pre- j
tend that we do not hear and make
him take the. side of the road in-j
stead." . '
"Do you think that he will?", asked
Mavlme uneasily.
"Of course he will turn out." said
Dolly confidently. "He won't try to
run us down, and when he sees that
we do not intend to move out he will
have to turn."
She smiled radiantly at the Idea,
but found no answering smile on her
escort's face. Mayling went white to
the lips at the thought of what might
happen were the plan to m'.scarry
He did not think- of the girl, only of
himself, for Mayling, despite his
athletic prowess, was no moral hero
He was not afraid to fight; indeed
he rather welcomed the opportunity
for he was reasonably certain to
knock out his man. but to walk with
one s back to an auto and to dare a
rival to keep on. were not at all to his
liking.
When the faint humming of the
motor told of the coming of the gray
racer. Dolly smiled delightedly.
Noticing signs of a bolt on the part
of her companion, as the frantic
sounding of the horn told that Blount
was near, she causht at his coat.
In an ecstacy of fear Mayling threw
off her hold and dashed for the side
of the road Just as Blount, to avoid
an accident, took chances on the road
side.
Mayling ran directly into the path of
the auto, and then with another quick
twist or the steering wheel, Blount
threw the car at the stone fence.
The next Instant there was the sound
of exploding tires, and the driver was
thrown heavily to the frozen ground.
He lay still and white, and with a lit
tle cry or terror Dolly ran to his side,
Tenderly she raised his .head into her
lap and with her handkerchief stanch
ed the flow of blood from the cut in
his forehead, while Mayling stood won-
derlngly by.
Cant you go for a doctor?' she
asked when at last she looked up. "If
you had done as I told you, it would
have been all right, but you had to run
at the wrong moment, for all the world
like a scared chicken. I thought that
athletics made men . brave, but I was
wrong. It seems to make them fool
ish. That action of Mr. Blount's was
braver than anything you ever dared
think of."
I guess I won t need a doctor, Dol
ly," murmured the injured man. "That
is all the tonic 1 need. It would have
been all right If you had kept to the
road, but when Mayling ran directly
In my path. I "
"You risked your life for his." fin
ished Dolly proudly. "Dudley, you were
splendid." -
"I guess I had better get a carriage,
anyhow," said Mayling sheepishly as
he started for the town. The scene
was not to his liking.
The two beside the road did not even
seem to realise that be was gone, forj
fj6" others eyes they read the old,
old story, and found it delightfully new.
