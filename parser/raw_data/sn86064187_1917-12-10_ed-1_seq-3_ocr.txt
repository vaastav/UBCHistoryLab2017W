GERMAN EFFORT
TO ROIL NEGROES
Try to Rouse Draft Opposition
Among Colored People,
(By a Sttflif Correspondent.)
WAslllNt.TON', D C, Dec. 10
( Special.) Secretary of war Hakrr to
day exposed a campaign of (ierman
propagandists to stir up race feeling in
the country and rouse opposition
among colored people to the draft
In a memorandum addressed to I'.in
mrt J. Scott, special assistant iu the
war department, who has beep assigned
to look alter the interests of colored
soldiers, Secretary baker said there
would be no discrimination against the
colored soldier, and that cHarcs that
such discrimination existed would br
investigated
Must Wipe Out Diisentert.
"What we need in this emergency,"
Secretary Maker said, "is the help of
rinht thinking people in the cities and
towns around the camps, and we are
Netting that co-operation so (jenerally
that our course seems "free from em
barrassment, if (Ierman propagandists,
who want to make discord by stirring
tip sensitive feelings, are simply not
allowed to do their work."
Secretary Hakcr said he regretted
that there seems to he a certain amount
of "overworked hysteria" on the part
of some complainants "who seem to
think that only colored draftees are
being assigned to duty in service battalion!-,
whereas thousands of white
draftees already have been and more
of them necessarily will be assigned to
Mich clntv."

"In the very nature of things." the
ccrctmv added, some must finht in
the trendies, while others must serve
in other capacities behind the tiling
line."
