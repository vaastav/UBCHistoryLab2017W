Thk latest news from Uic prince of
Wales, the heir to the British throne,
is that he was lingering ou tho brink of
death. Londou was excited, the Queen
alarmed and terrified. Tho prince of
Wales has five children, the oldest oi
whom, Albert Victor Christian Edward,
now nearly eight years of ago, will, in
the event of his father's death, suc
ceed to the throne under a regency.
The Shawneetowu Mvreuri, tho or
gan of radicalism in Gallatin county,
disposes of the meeting of congress
and the president's message, in the fol
lowing brief terms : " Congress asscm
' bled on Monday. The president's
' luesingo is too lengthy for our col-
minis." A lew words of flattery of
the " able state paper" would have oc
cupied but little space, and put tho
Nrrcnrg in the fashion.
Hr.S llVTI.i:il bn.M xipiilor Wii'iim
and senator WiUon, but in order to
gratify his dislike of tho latter, he
sometime since announced his intention
of piiHhiug tho claims of speaker Blaine
for the vice-presidency. Sinco tho
meeting of congress and the announce
ment of tho committees, it is supposed
that Jlutlcr doesn't dislike Wilson less
but lilaiuu more, and therefore, that he
will not now press tho speaker's claim
to being second on the presidential
ticket. This personal spite and ma
neuvering is characteristic of the dough
ty Ben.
A Wahiunhto.v correspondent of a
radical paper, ivhosc institicts appear to
be on the side of honesty and decency,
writes this . "The administration is
' now playing tho game of detaching
' some of the more unprincipled demo
' cram from auy schemes of compromise,
' and constituencies connected with the
4 late democratic party are warned that
three or four of their members of con
gress cat dinners at the white house,
' and share in the plunder here." This
is a fair specimen of the inside work
mgs of radicalism. A squabble for
office and grabbing for spoils is the
first principle, to which the leaders of
the party prove themselves eminently
faithful. We hope Grant's latest slice
ulatiou, that of buying unprincipled
democrats, will prove successful. The
party can spare all such.
Ohio radicals, who were pleased at
the leliremcut of Murphy from the
iflice of collector of New-York, ob
ject to Grant's sugar-coated letter to
the out-goiug favorite. The New-York
Triliune publishes the followiugcoinmu
nicatiuu from a Western Reserve rad
ical .
To tht Editor of the Tribune :
Siks Tailing what vouhavo said about
cM.'olIuctor Murphy to bo true only In

handsomo pin-cushion. At tho "Ebcnczcr

At tho "Western'' table ho left ten dollars.
At tho Arch-street Church table ho pur
