DALNY
AMERICAN CONSUL SAYS BUSI
NESS IS ACTIVE AND THE TOWN
HAS A GREAT FUTURE.
Dr. J. K. Jones, the American Consul
General at Dalny, wbb a passenger yer
day on the Nippon Mnru from the Far
East. Speaking of conditions In Danly
he said.
"Since my visit to .Dalny last July,
the city shows unmistakable evidences
of progress. A large number of the
buildings which were partially des
troyed by tho retreating Russians when
the city was evacuated, have been ren
ovated, and within a short time It is
expected the administration quarters
will be fit for occupation. In tho for
eign settlement n largo number of
dwellings have been temporarily put
ur for use of. the Japanese population,
but these, I am Informed, with be sup
plemented within a few years by more
substantial structures; 'In fact, the
owners of these temporary structures
understand that they will have to erect
more permanent buildings when the
city Is reorganized.
"Like nil new cities, for Dalny Is
practically a new city, there Is con-

Ing. These reasons have evidently forced
themselves, upon the Sat. Francisco
"Board of Education now that the Jap
anese have become so numerous that
tho influence has commenced to be felt,
and hence Its action.
It is easy to conceive tho difficulty
for the Eastern mind to appreciate tho
situation, but the South with the same
problem, only with the difficulty of
language edlmlnated, will readily un
derstand the position taken by the
Callfornlans.
The fact that President Roosevelt
recommends Congress to pass laws giv
ing him power to supersede State au
thority fn the treatment of questions of
an international character shows that
he realizes that he Is without such
power, and his threat to use civil or
military power to enforce his will
therefore comes as a wave of hot air,
disagreeable but not necessarily annihilating.

Dalny, but nil business at present Is
practically conducted by Japanese and
altogether the city may be described as

TURN DOWN AT WILL
THE HYLO iLAMP is known as the lamp that turns up
and down as needed. Its principal virtue is that of economy.
There is no valid reason why you should go on paying for l6
candle power when i-candlc power at certain times would suf
fice for your needs.
HYLO LAMPS turn down from i6-candle power to i
candle power and can be used wherever an ordinary electric
incandescent "lamp is' used. For a sick room, where a dim,
steady light is a necessity, the value of the HYLO LAMB
cannot be overestimated.
