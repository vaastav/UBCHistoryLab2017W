The President's Message.
The two houses of Congress convened
last Monday. The only business trans
acted was the reading of the President's
message, which occupied two and a quar
ter hours. It is a lengthy document, con
sisting of 18,000 words. We have as yet
only read portions relating to the tariff
and the financial question. The Presi
dent endorses Secretary Carlisle's finan
cial policy. He Bays bonds cannot be
depended upon to support the gold re
serve, and that there mut be an elastic
currency. He favors the repeal of the 10
per cent, tax on State banks. He favors
free coal and iron and the abolition of all
protection to refineries of sugar.
Thoso who hoped the President would
outline some bold policy that would have
a bearing upon the future of party or
ganization are disappointed. It was a
great opportunity and Grover Cleveland
did not improve it.
Wo give the message entire in a sup
plement and trust every ono will read it.

FROM OUR RALEIGH CORRESPONDENT.
Raleigh, N C, Dec. 3, 1894.
The State boaid of canvassers got at
work last Friday and two entire days
were consumed in the canvass of the judi
cial vote. This was due to the fact that
there were three sets of returns from
Nash county, these being known as the
original, a fraudulent copy and a cor
rected copy. Ono set of these returns
was stolen from the office of the clerk of
the court and altered without his knowl
edge, and he certified it and sent it here.
But when he found that it was erroneous
be at once sent another return and there
on made a statement to the Secretary of
State.
The board of canvassers was urged by
the counsel for C. M. Bernard, fusion
nominee for Solicitor in the Third dis
district, to accept the last return. Coun
sel for John E. Woodard, the Democratic
nominee, argued that the board cannot
hear ovidence to determine the authen
ticity and genuineness of the returns, but
that if a paper is presented as a return
and a question is made as to whether it
is a return or not, the board must decide
the question from what appears on the
face of the paper itself. The board de
cided to accept the original return. It
was asked to subpoena a witness from
Nash, but declared that it bad no such
right, and further tbat it had no right to
hear evidence and correct clerical errors.
The clerical errors were numerous, and
some of them reflect no credit on the
county boards, as initials of names are in
some cases wrong, names are put down
on wrong columns. Thus men voted for
in the Third district are put down on
the Fourth district. By a clerical error
Hubert Carter, Democratic nominee for
Judge in the 12th district, lost 20,000
votes. These are recorded as cast for
"Herbert Carter. Both fusionists and
Democrats lo&t votes in this way ; one
fusionist losing 10,000
The State board proceeded with great
care. Its powers are extremely limited.
It has no right to go behind the returns.
It appears that the nominees for Chief
Justice led their respective tickets. The
vote for Shepherd is 127,593, and for Fair-
cloth 148,434. making the latter's major
ity being 20,841. The total vote cast is
276.027 Two years atro the total vote
was 280,500. The falling off in the vote
was not so great as was thought. Jus
tice Shepherd came in 8,000 votes of get
ting as many votes as did Gov. Carr. The
Republicans and populists two years ago
polled 143,524 votes. They thus gained
this year o,UUU. Iben two years ago
2,457 votes were cast for the prohibition
candidate for Governor, while this year
the prohibitionists bad no candidate
Walter Clark got 272,070 votes, or 4,000
less than the total cast. MacRae got 12 J,
466, Furches 145,219; Burwell 125,574,
Montgomery 144,909.
The six fusion nominees for Judges are
all elected. Six fusion Solicitors are
elected and four Democrats. On the face
of the returns the Democratic Solicitors
get in from the 3rd and 7th districts.
The Congressional vote shows that in
the First district Harry Skinner, fusion
ist, has 2964 majority over Branch; that
in the Third district Shaw, Democrat,
has 994 over Cyrus Thompson, populist,
and that in tho Ninth Pearson, fusionist,
has only 135 over Crawford.
Up to yesterday the vote of Ashecoun-
tv for State Treasurer had not been re-
ceived. This was the only missing re
turn.
The number of " visiting statesmen,'
nearly all of the Republican faith, has
been extremely large during the past few
days. The ostensible cause of their as
semblage was to be present at the count
of votes. But really it was to comer,
Republican Chairman Holton says there
is not a particle of truth in the statement
that Republicans are planning to elect
two Republican Senators. He says there
will be one populist and one itepublican
and that Marion Butler will be the popu
list.
Jeter C. Pritcbard is absolutely sure
that he will be the Republican Senator.
This appears to be the opinion of the
great majority of Republicans who will
talk about the matter.
Marion Butler was the only populist
present at the conference. In fact he is
the only prominent popuust in me otaie.
The Republicans do not care to deal with
any others, since he has the power and
t ho Rhi nv to BDeaK absolutely ior nis
j r t
party.
The conterence has agreed tnat iusion
s to continue "co-operation" is the offi
cial name of it. It is also agreed that
there shall be loint caucuses on most
suhiefits: ouite probably on Senator. It
will be a simple way or showing now tne
fusionists null together. All the talk of
disagreements, present and possible, are
idle, your correspondent is assured Dy
both the fusion chairmen.
The truth is that tho Democrats have
erot to get together, and face the fusion
music in 1896. Tho same tunes will be
played.
The amount of money thus far received
for the State's Confederate monument is
$17,000. of which the ladies have raised
$7,000. The monument is to cost $25,-
000, so $8,000 must be raised and that
speedily, as May 20th the monument is to
be unveiled. Such is now the under
standing. The delivery of stone, cut at
Mt. Airy, is to begin this week, the presi
dent of the ladies monument association
tells me. All the stone is ready. The
finely carved stone is at Baltimore and
will be sent here at once. The bronze
statuary, etc., cast in Germany, is fin
ished and is to arrive in January. It is
to cost, by contract, $11,000 of the $25
000.
This week some 50 convicts go from
the penitentiary to the farms on the
Roanoke. Arrivals of convicts have
been unusually numerous at the peni
tentiary.
The Progressive Farmer today in an
editorial very earnestly urges the new
Legislature to establish a reformatory for
youthful criminals. This will certainly
be a popular movement.
At tho Baptist State Convention at
Charlotte this week the question of State
aid to the University will be delicately
handled, so says Editor Bailey, of the
Biblical Recorder. It is not probable
that the Legislature will take away the
appropriation.
There will be a pretty contest over the
speakership of the house. Lusk, Walser
and Ewart are chiefly named. The letter
can have it it be will accept it, so some
Republicans of prominence say. It ap
pears to be quite well understood that a
Republican is to get this position.
The number of cadets at the A. & M.
College is now 215. Of these 160 are in
the battalion. All will not be uniformed
until next month.
The railway commission gives an opio

Edenton, but that the only line was
operated by a railway. The commission
finds this statement to be untrue, and
orders the 25 cents excess to be refunded
and also orders the company to desist
rom further violation of the law.
There is great and general regret all
over the State at the retirement of Maj.
John C. Winder, from the service of the
Seaboard Air-Line which he bad served
so long, ably and zealously. He retired,
it is learned, because be was urea oi tne

The ' State County Fair," by the
young ladies of the Normal and Indus
trial school, at Greensboro, Friday night
was a unique entertainment. The Ral.
eigh Observer correspondent writes of the
representations, we quote a few :
"Tho voung lady who represented
Greene county had . not only an artistic
fcense of the fitness of things, but she was
plucky, and she made the hit of the
evening when she appeared bearing on
her shoulders a squealing, struggling pig
and wearing a string of corn in the ear,
strung to her dress, representing the
"hog and hominy" interests oi Crreene.
Another representative of the "Emerald
County" carried a banner, which doubt
less made the Wake county girls quake
at their narrow escape, for it bore on its
face the legend : 44 Snow Hill, in this
county, came within one vote of being
the Capital oi JNorth Carolina.
It is needless to say the Uurbam coun
tv delegation carried a banner with a
handsome "Durham Bull" pictured on it,
and another girl made the mourns oi tne
men water with her necklace oi cigars
and a husro bag of smoking toBacco.
-
Buncombe county claimed the honor of
the birth place ot Vance, owain ana
Merrimon.
Mecklenburg, progressive Mecklenburg
with her wealth and intelligence, was
reDresented by girls, clad in black and
white crowns, the black gowns having
stripes of silver around the skirts of the
dress and little black wings peeped out
trom the shoulders, these were nornets,
and a young woman earned a hornets
nest. Of course the Declaration of In-
denendence was along too. The toilettes
of this delegation were the most elaborate
of all and they stood a good chance of
winning tne prize.
ROCKINGHAM WINS THE PRIZE.
Rockingham was the best of all, and
so the judges decided. Two girls bore a
cradle in which reposed a sugar cured
ham, and on a card attached to the cradle
wa8 written. "The Nursery of Gover-
nors ,'' and four girls bore each a shield
framed in evergreens, on which were the
names of four North Carolina Governors,
David Reed, John Morehead, Alfred M.
Scales. Gov. Martin.
The entertainment was interspersed
with patriotic songs, and the whole affair
demonstrated the warm love these girls
have for the Old North State. The affair
was not only enjoyable, but exceedingly
instructive.
Washington correspondent of the
Newbern Journal :
" Judge Gudger, of the Treasury De
nartment has called my attention to a
paragraph in one of the Washington
naners. which states that Hon. VV. O. KJ.
B. Robinson, of Goldsboro, and who was
at the recent election, made a Judge of
the Superior Court, is the only Catholic
who has ever been elected to public office
- - l
in North Carolina. The Judge states.
that this is a very gross error, and does
mf J
great injustice to the people of the State.
" lie says, it is true tnat Dy tne uonsu,
tution of the State, adopted in 1776,
Catholics could not hold public offices
but the Constitution formed in 1835 did
away with the restriction, and, since then,
catholics nave oeen eugioie as otner
... t . i
citizens to hold office. He further says
that this change was brought about
greatly by the efforts and influence of
the Hon. Wm. Gaston, of New Berne.
who was one of the most eminent Judges
of North Carolina, soon alter tne con
stitution of 1835 was adopted. Mr. Gas
ton, who was a Catholic, was elected one
of the Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court of the State, which position he
filled with very great ability and satis
faction to tbo people, until bis death
several vears thereafter.
Hon. Mathias E. Manly, of New Berne,
anot her Catholic, was for many years a
Judge of the Superior Courts of Law
and Equity, and about 1856 or 57 was
AlrtAd an Associate iustice of the Su
preme Court, which office he filled very
accentablv. until the Reorganization of
the State Government under the Recon
struction acts of Congress, after the late
war.
Hon. W. A. Moore, of Edenton. was ap
pointed a Judge of the Superior Courts
of the State, by Gov. Caldwell about
1873. to fill a vacancy caused by the death
of Judere Jones, ana continuea in omce
until the exniration of the term in 1878.
Indira Moore was also a Catholic. The
Judge informs me these facts are of his
personal knowledge, except as to Judge
Gaston, as the other gentlemen were per-
sonal acquaintances ana ineoas oi um, as
in also Judce Robinson recently elected.
The Judge calls my attention to the fact
that there are but few Catholics in the
State, the number as shown by the cen
sus of 1890 being 2640, and thinks no
one ran consider there is any prejudice or
feeling against Catholics in North Caro
lina, when out of such a small number
nf Communicants of that Church four
men have been elevated to very high
offices. Other instances might be given
of persons of the Catholic faith occupy-
ing positions ot trust in tne state.

CHARLOTTE. N. C.
A Story of Disobedience.
A large white house stands on top of
the hill, and in front of it flows a clear.
broad river. It is surrounded by beauti
ful ever-greens.
1 wish to describe one of its rooms. It
is the nursery. I know you wish you
could see it. Sunshine beams through
the windows, and a cozy fire burns in the
grate. .
Over the mai.tel hangs a picture of
Red Riding Hood and the Sly Wolf.
The room is beautifully painted, and
has a table in the centre with a bowl ot
roses, and a bottle of ink stands on the
table.
But look ! the door opens and in dances
ittle Nellie.
She has been forbidden several times
to touch this bottle, but she bears a
whisper it is batan. He says, "see if
you can't write neatly." So she tries,
but she thinks she hears her mother
coming.
She hurries, tries to stop the ink bottle,
but alas! it turns over all on her dress.
and on the floor.
She runs into the conservatory, sits
down and begins to cry. The conserva
tory has glass walls, and it is filled with
flowers and ferns, but even in this beauti
ful place Nellie is not happy.
"Mere comes mother, says she, and it
was her mother.
.She came to her and said, "Now, Nel
lie did you spill tbat ink on the carpet ?"
Nellie bung her head in shame.
The spot is still left on the carpet to
remind her ot her disobedience.
This lesson teaches us tbat we must
obey our parents. Louik de B. Jones,
10 years of age.
Vain Regrets.
We do not "let the dead past bury its
dead; ' we disturb its ashes. We grieve
over neglected opportunities or sitting in
the shadow, we bewail the heedlessness
with which we wasted the sunshine, and
fancy tbat were it possible to collect
shattered fragments we would now fash
ion our lives into a rounder perfect whole.
" What s gone and wbats past help,
Should be past grief.''
But no: we persist in our lamentations.
some times silently brooding, but too
often wearying our dearest friends with
melancholy variations upon the absorb
ing theme, "It might have been."
It is said tbat experience has no head
light, that only the road over which we
have travelled is illumined, yet we go
forward, to each new trial believing tbat
we have acquired wisdom to meet its exi
gencies and strength to bear its burdens.
And seeing in the clear after light how
much better we might have done, we for

Would Not Exchange His Home for Any
Other Part of the Globe.
W. H. Requey, Cherryville, N. C,
writes the following interesting letter to
the southern states Magaaine :
I was born in Westboro, Albany
County, N. Y., in 1840, where I lived
until 1881, when I decided to try my
iortune in tne ooutn.
Accompanied by my wife I came to
Cherryville, Gaston county, a small town
situated on the Carolina Central Railroad,
forty aailes west of Charlotte. We are
delighted with tho soil and climate, and
have found the people kind, hospitable
and entirely tree from any prejudice
against Northern people, which last was
contrary to our expectations.
1 have traveled in the West, but
would not exchange this portion 'of
North Carolina for any other part of the
globe. I live in full view of the Blue
Ridge, and the scenery surpasses any de
scription that I can give. The climate is
delightful, much warmer in winter and
cooler in summer than New York.
giFruits grow in abundance. The finest
peaches and pears I ever saw were
brought to this market and produced
from this county.
The soil is light and sandy here, which
is exactly adapted to the raising of the
bright wrapper tobacco.
We have a cotton mill in successful
operation, and there is a fine opening at
this point for different manufacturing
enterprises.
Living is cheap, and fuel and all kinds
of country produce is in abundance.
More chickens have been shipped from
here than any other point in the State.
It is impossible for me to write all that
I feel, or do justice to a description o;
our sunny Southern home and the warm
hearted friends we have found here.
