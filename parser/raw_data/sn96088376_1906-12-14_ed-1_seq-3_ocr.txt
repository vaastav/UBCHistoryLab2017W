Bootlon 3433 of the coda of Ore
gon provide! as follows:
Tlie county eoart, l ant general aloe
tioo to be held In any county alter the
passsga ol this act, npon the presents
tlon ol a petition tlg-ntd by one hondrvd
or more qualified elentori, Ui payers ol
ad county, must inbuilt the question
ol establishing and maintaining a eoun
t high school to the qnallfled electors
thereol. The county court, If they
deem It eipedlent, uiay order a epeclal
election lor such purpose. 8uch else
tlon (hall be conducted In the manner
provided by law lor conducting election.
The ballots lor such election eliall con
tain the word: "For County High
School Ym;" "For County High
School No," and the volar shall Indi
cate his choice ai provided In the Aus
tralian ballot law.
8134. If a majority of all votee cast
on the proposition to establish a county
high echool are In the affirmative, it
hall be the duty of the county court,
within thirty naye attar canvaanlng (aid
vote, to locate said echool In some suit
able and convenient place In eaid
scanty, e e e a
n pursuance ot this section
thp establishment of a County
High School in Gilliam County was
submitted to the voters at the gen
eral election last June and was
voted upon afllrmativly by, the
majority of the electors in the
county. The County Court was
triable to agree as to the location
of the instiluation, eaoh of the
three members voting for its loca
tion at his particular place of res
idence As a result Gilliam County
is without a high school, with no
prospects for securing one until
the next election and in all proba
bility at that time the court will
again be unable to agree as to the
question of its looation. We under
stand that the same conditions ex
ists in Jaokson and Union counties.
If this be the case the State Legi
slature could surely have no ob
jection to atniuending the above
mentioned sections and proving
that the question of the location
of the school be submitted to the
voters of the oounty. It occurs to
us that the State Senator frdtu this
sensorial district resides in Condon
and that an amendment to the
sections refered to above would re
sult in much good to his home
town and to the county at large.
We have no reoolleotion of his
doing anything in the past for Con
don, Gilliam County orchis sentor
ial district except in his vain at
tempt to square himself with the
liquor interests by securing the
passage of the city charter for
Condon at the laet session of the
legislature. There was no opposi
tion to his city charter bill and the
proposed amendment would also
in all probability pass both houses
without a disenting vote. It would
be good politioa for him to do some
thing; at the' next session of the
legislature. His oonstituants de
mand it. If he hasn't - nerve
enough to introduoe the bill him
self, perhaps be could prevail upon
one of bit colleague to do it in
his behalf.

In bis recent message to Congress
President Roosevelt struck a popu
lar chord when he recommended
the enactment of a law providing
for a graduated inheritance tax.
Practically the only source of rev
enue for the maintenance of the
federal government, said the Presi
dent, ia the tariff on imports and
internal revenue.' Therefore be
proposes that a tax be levied by
the federal government on every
gift, bequest and deviae in propor
tion o the amount of the inheri
tance. By this means the govern
ment would obtain a source of rev
enue which would help consider
ably to defray government expen
ses. Id spite of the opposition of
the stand patters in the in the re
publican party the tariff on many
articles imported into the United
States will ultimately be reduced.
If the republican party does not
see fit to make the change the
democratic will do so and such a
reduction will also materially re
duce our source of revenue.. The
proposed tax upon inheritances
would more than cover the loss of
revenue ocasioned by the reduction
of the tariff and it can hardly be
said that it would work a greater
hardship upon the recepient of the
inheritance than the present tariff
schedule which in many cases has
undoubtedly sheltered monopoly,
at the expense of the individual
consumer.

An American woman of letters
has found what she considers a solu.
tion for the matrimonial problem.
The remedy which she offers in her
reoent book, containing ten or
twelve lectures on the subject, is
that of trial marriages, or in other
words a marriage at the will of the
parties to the contract. As soon
as they pass the billing and cooing
mile post and begin to realize that
their life's partner isn't exactly the
angel of their dreams then, accord
ing to the distinguished lady's plan
they could agree to separate forev
er and be free to marry again with
out the intervention of the courts.
The learned lady is wrong in the
theory of ber scheme but perhaps
she was only looking for cheap no
toriety.
