claims,'
mounting to 3123.635 and 54 cents, in
-vbich mors Itian one hundred of our fl
luw citizens are interested were recognized ,
and the Spanish government agreed to pay
$100,900 of this amount ' within three
months following the exchange of ratifica
tions.' The payment of the remaining
528,635 54 was to await the decisionof tha
commissioners for or against 'the Amistead
claim bat in any event the balance was
to be paid to the claimants either by Spain
or the United States. These terms, I have
very reason to know, are highly satisfac
tory to the holders of the Cuban claims
Indeed, they have made a formal offer au
thorizing tne State Department to settle
these claims, and to deduct the amount of
the Amistead claim from the sums vhich
they are entitled to receive from Spaiu.
This offer, of course, cannot be accepted.
All other claims of citizens of the United
States against Spain, or of subjects of the
Queen of Spain against the United States,
including the 'Amistead claim,' were by
this convention referred to a board of com
missioners in the usual form. Neither the
validity ot the Amistead claim nor of any
other claim against either party, with the
single exception of the Cuban claiiu.wa
recognized by the convention. Indeed the
Spanish government did not insist that the
validiiy of the Amistead claim should be
thus recognized, notwithstanding its pay
ment bad been recommended to Congress
by two of my predecessors as well as by
myself, and an appropriation for that pur
pose had passed the Senae of the United
States. They were content that it should
be submitted to the board for examinat ion
and decision, like the other claims. Both
governments were bound respectively to
pay the amounts awarded to the several
claimants 'at such times and places as may
be fixed by and according to the tenor of
said awards.'
. I transmitted this convention to the Senate
for their constitutional action on the 3d
May, 1360, and on the 27th of the succeed-,
ing June they determined that they would
"not advise and consent' to its ratification.
These proceedings p'aca our relations
with Spain i:i an awkward and embarrass
ing position. It is more than probaole that
the final adjustment of these claims will de
volve upon my successor.
I reiterate the recommendation contained
in my Annual Message of December, 1858,
and repeated in that of 1859, in tavor of the
acquisition of Cuba from Spain by fair pur
chase. I firml) believe that such an acqui
sition would contribute essentially to the
well being aud prosperity of boih countries
in all future . time, as well as prove the
certain moans of immediately abolishing
the African slave-trade throughout the
world. I would not repeat this recomraen
dation upon ihe present occasion, if I be
lieved that the transfer of Cuba to the Uni
ted Sta'es upon conditions highly favorable
to Spain, could justly tarnish the national
honor ot the proud and ancient Spanish
Monarchy. Surely no person ever attribu
ted to the first Napoleon a disregard of the
national honor of France, for transferring
Louisiana 10 tho' United Slat for a fan
equivalent both in money and commercial
advantages.
With the Emperor of Austria, and the re
maining continental powers of Europe, in
eluding that of the Saltan, our rela'ions con
tinue to be of the most friendly character.
CHINA.
The friendly and peaceful policy pur
cued by the Government of the Uuited
S ates towards the empire of China, has
nrn,liail lh mnst BalisfilCtnrV reSUttS
The treaty of Tientsin, of the 18lh of June,
1858, has been faithfully observed by the
Chinese authorities. The Convention of
the Sih November, 185S, supplemen ary to
this treaty, for the adjustment and satisfac
tion of the claims of our citizens on China,
referred to in ray last Annual Message, has
been already, carried into effect, so far as
this was practicable.
Uuder this convention the jsnra of 500;000
taels, eqnai :o about 5700,000, was stiputa
ted to be paid in satisfaction of the claim
- 1 .. rt r. t. r
of American citizens, out oi tne one una oi
the receipts for tonnage import, and export
duties on American vessels at the port of
Canton', Shanghae and Fuchau ; and it was
'greed that this amount shall be in full
liquidation of all claims of American citi
zens at the various ports to this da e."
Debentures for thss amount to wit: 300,000
aela for Canton, 400,000 for Shanghae, and
100,000 for Fuchau were delivered accor
!ing to the terms of the convention by the
respective Chinese collectors of the customs
"ot these. ports to the agent selected by our
minister to receive the same.
Since that time the claims of our citizens
aave been adjusted by the board of com
missioners appointed for that purpose under
the act of March 3, 1859, and their awards,
which proved satisfactory to the claimants,
have been approved by our minister. In
the asrsre-jate they amount to the sum of
S198.69t,78. The claimant havw already
roooivf-.l a lards nroDortion of the sums
awarded to then out of the land provided,
and ii w confidently expected thai the re
mainder will ere long be entirely paid.
After the awards shall have been satisfied,
there will remain a surplus of more than
$200,000 at the disposition of Congress.
. As this will in equity belong to the Chinese
goverument, would not justice require its
appropriation to some benevolent object in
which the Chinese may be specially inter
esled 1 -
Our minister to China, in obedience to
his instructions, has remainrd perfectly

minister, he was ever ready and willing,

COSTA RICA AND NICARAGUA.
Persevering efforts have been made for
the adjustment of the claims of American
citizens against the government of Cosia
Ktca, and I am happy to inform you that
these have finally prevailed. A conven
tion was signed at the city of San Jose, ou
the 2d of July last, between the minister
resident of the United States in Costa Ilica
and the plenipotentiaries of that republic
referring lhee claims to a board ot com
missioners, and providing for the payment
of thtfir awards. This convention will be
submitted immediately to tha Seiate for
their constitutional action.
The claims ot our citizens upon the re
public of Nicaragua have not yet been pro
vided for by the treaty, although diligent
efforts for this purpose have been made by
our minister resident to that republic.
These are still continued with a fa.r pros
pect of success.
MEXICO.
Our relations with Mexico remain in a
most unsatisfactory condition. In my last
two annual messages 1 discussed extensive
ly the subject of these relations, and do not
now propose to repeal at length the facts
aud arguments then presented. They
proved conclusively that our citizens reid
ing in Mexico and our merchants trading
th-relo had suffered a series of wrongs and
outrages such as we have never patiently
borne from a.ny otner nation. For these
our successive ministers, invoking the faith
of treaties, had in the name of their coun
try, persistently demanded redress and in
demnification, but without the slighe.M ef
fect. Indeed, so confident had the Mexican
authorities become of our patient endu
rance, that they universally believed they
might commit these outrages upon American
citizens with absolute impunity. Thus
wrote our minister in 1856, and expressed
the oDinion that 'nothing but a manitesta
tiou of the power of the government, and
of its purpose to punish these wrongs, will
avail.'
Afterward, in 1857. came the adoption
ol a now constitution for Mexico, tho elec
tion of a President and Congress under its
provisiou-s, and the inauguration of the
President. Within one short month, how
ever, this President was" expelled from the
capital by a rebellion in the army, nd the
supreme power of the republic was assign
ed to General Zuloaga. This usurper was,
in his turn, soon compelled to retire and
give place to General Mirainon.
Under the constitution which had thos
been adopted, Senor Juarez, as chief justice
of the Supreme Court, became the lawful
President of the Republic ; and it was for
the maintenance of the constitution and his
authority derived from it that the civil war
commenced; and still continues to be pros
ecuted. Throughout the year 1858 the constitu
tional party grew stronger and stronger.
In the previous history of Mexico a suc
cessful military revolution at the capital
hid almnt nniirrs;iilv been the signal for
'? tv 1
.c" . ' 1
jor.ty ot
submission throughout the republic
to on the uresent occasion. A majon
the citizens persistently sustained the con
stitutional government. When tins was
recog nized in April, 1859, by the Govern
ment of the Untied States, its authority ex
tended over a large majority of the Mexican
States and people including Vera Cruiz and
all the other important sea ports of the re
public. From that Period our commerce
with, Mexico began to revive, and the con
stitutional government has afforded it all
the protection in their power.
Meanwhile, the government of Miramon
still held sway at the capiial and over the
surrounding country, and continued its
outrages against the few American citizens
who still had the courage to remain within
its oower To cap the'cltmax: After tho
battle of Tacubaya, in April, 1859, Gen.
M.irnuRz ordered three citizens of the Uni-
toil Si.tps twnnf them nhvsicians. to
be
. . 1 ... 4 J t ,
seized taken out and bhol, without criti
and without trial. This wa done, noiwiih
standing our unfortunate countrymen were
at the moment engaged in the holy cause
of affording relief to the soldiers of both
parties who had been woundeJ in the bat
lie, without making any distinction between
them.
The time had arrived, in my opinion,
when this Government was bound to exert
its power to avenge and redress the wrongs
of our citizens and to afford them protec
tion in Mexico. The interposing obstacle
was that the portion of the country under
the sway of Miramon could not be reached
withont passing over territory under the
jurisdiction of the constitutional government.
Under these circumstances, 1 deemed it my
duty to recommend to Congress, in my last
aonual message, the employment of a suf
ficient military force to penetrate into the
interior, where the government ot aiiramon
was to be found, with, or, if need be,
without the consent of Juarez govern
ment, though it was not doubted that this
consent could be obtained. Never have I
had a clearer conviction on any subject than
of justice as well as wisdom of such a poli
cy. No other alternative was left, except
the entire abandonment of our fellow citi
zens who had gone to Mexico, under the
faith of treaties, 10 the sys'ema'ic injustice,
cruelty and oppression of Miramon's gov
ernment. Besides it is almost certain that
the simple auihorty to employ this force
would ot itself have accomplished a'l our
objects wishout striking a single blow.
The constitutional government would then
ere this have been established at the city
of Mexico, aud would have been ready and
willing, to the extent ot its ability, to do us
justice.
In addition and, I deem this a most im
portant consideration European Govern
ments would have been deprived of all pre
text lo interfere in the territorial and do
ines'ic concerns in Mexico. We should
thus have been relieved from (heobligation
of resisting, even by force, should this be
come necessary, any attempt by these gov
ernments to deprive our neighboring repub
lic ot portions ot her territory ; a duty from
which we could not shrink wiihout aban
doning the traditional and established policy
of the American : people. 1 am happy to
.observe, that, firmly relying upon the jus
tice and good faith of these governments,
ihere is no present danger that suchva con
tingency ' ill happen. " "
Such treaties were accordingly concluded
by our late able and excellent minister to
Mexico, and on the 4th of January last,
were submitted to the Senate for ratification.
As these have not yet received the final
action of that body, it would be improper
for me to present a detailed statement of
their provisions St ill I may be permitted
to express the opinion in advance ihat they
are calculated to promote the agricul'ural,
the manufacturing and commercial inter
ests of the country, and to secure our just
influence with an adjoining republic as to
whose fortunes and fate we can never feel
i'td flerent ; whilst at the same time they
provide for the payment of a considerable
amount towards the satisfaction of tile
claims of our injured fellow citizens.
KANSAS AND UTAH.
At the period of my inauguration I wns
confronted in Kansas by a revolutionary
Government, existiug under what is called
the Topeka Constitution. Its avowed ob
ject was to subdue the Territorial Govern
ment by force, and to inaugurate what was
called tho Topeka Government in its stead.
To accomplish this object an extensive mil
itary organization was formed, and its com
mand entrusted to the most violent revolu
tionary leaders. Under these circumstances
it became my imperative duty to exert the
whole constitutional power of the Executive
to prevent the names of civil war from again
raging in Kansas, which, in the excited
state of the public mind, both North and
South, might have extended into the neigh
boring States.
The hestilo parties in Kansas had been
inflamed against each other by cmissarios
both from the North and tho South, to a de
gree of malignity without paralell in our
history. To prevent actual collision, and to
assist the civil magistrates in enforcing tho
laws, a strong detachment of the army was
stationed in the Territory, ready to aid the
marBhal and his deputies, when lawfully
called upon, as a posse comitiitis in the exe
cution ot civil and criminal process.
Still, the troubles could not have been
permanently settlad without an election by
the people. The ballot-box is the surest ar
biter of disputes among freemen. Under
this conviction, every proper effort was em
ployed to induce the hostile parties to vote
at the election of delegates to frame a
State Constitution, and afterwards at the
election to decide whether Kansas should be
a slave or a free State. The insurgent par
ty refused to vote at either, lest this might
be considered a rtcogoition on their part of
the Territorial Government established by
Congess. A better spirit, however, seemed
soon after to prevail, and the two parties
met t'uoo to fuce at the third election, held
on the first Monday of January, 1S58, for
members of tho Legislature ami State offi
cers under tho Lecompton Constitution.
The result was tho triumph of the anti-slavery
party at the polls. This decision of
the ballet box proved clearly that this party
were in tho majority, and removed the dan
ger of civil war. From that time we have
heard little or nothing of the Topeka Gov
ernment, and all serious danger of revolu
tionary troubles in Kansas at an end.
Tho Lecuruptou Constitution, which had
been thus recognised at this State election
by the votes of both political partinain ic
wi transmuted to me with the request
that I should present it to Congress. This
I could not have refused to do without vio
lating my clearest and strongest convictions
of duty. Tho Constitution, and all the pro
ceedings which preceJeJ and followed its
formation, were fair and regular on their
face. I then believed, and experience has
proved, that the interests of the people of
Kansas would have been best consulted by
its admission as a State into tho Union, es
pecially as the majority, within a brief pe
riod, could have amended tho Constitution
according to their will and pleasure. If
fraud existed in all or any of these proceed
ings, it was not for the President, but tor
Congress, to investigate and determine the
question of fraud, and what ought to bo its
consequences. If, at the first two elections,
',ie m;ijor'ty refused to vote, it cannot be
pretended that this refusal to exercise the
lective fr
anchise could invalidate aa elec
tion fairly held under lawful authority, even
if they had not subsequently voted at the
third election. It is true that the whole
Constitution had not been submitted to the
people, as I always desired ; but thS prece
dents are numerous of the admission of
States into the Union without submission.
It would not comport with my present
purpose to review tho proceedings of Con
gress upon the Lecompton Constitution. It
is sufficient to observe that their final ac
tion has removed all vestige of serious revo
lutionary troubles. The desperate band re
cently assembled, under a notorious outlaw
in the Southern portion of the Territory, to
resist the execution of the laws and to plun
der peaceful citizens, will, I doubt not, be
speedily subdued and brought to justice.
Ilad I treated the Lecompton Constitu
tion as a nullity and refused to transmit it to
e i Congress, it is not difficult to imagine, whilst
recalling the position of tho country at that
moment, what would have been the disas
trous consequences, both in and out of the
Territory, from such a dereliction of duty
on the part of the Executive.
Peace has also been restored within
the territory of Utah, which, at the com
mencement of my Administration, was in a
state of open rebellion. This was the more
dangerous, as the people, animated by a fa
natical spirit, and entrenched within their
distant mountain fastnesses, might have
mado a long and formidable resistance. Coat
what it might, it was necessary to bring
them into subjection to the Constitution and
the laws. Sound policy, therefore, as well
as humanity, required that this object sho'd,
if possible, be accomplished without the
effusion of blood. This could only be effect
ed by sending a military force into tho Ter-
aitory suihciently strong to convince the
people that resistance would be hopeless,
and at the samo time to offer them a pardon
for past offences oc condition of immediate
submission to the Government. This policy
was pursued with eminent success ; and the
only causo 'for regret i3 the heavy expendi
ture required to march a long detachment of
tho army to that remote region, and to fur
nish it subsistence. Utah is now compara
tively peaceful and quiet, and the military
force has been withdrawn except that por
tion of it necessary to keep the Indians in
check, and to protect the emigrant trains
on their way to our Pacific possessions.
FINANCES.
In my first annual message, I promised to
employ my test exertions, in co-operation
with Congress, to reduce the expenditures
of the government within the limits of wise
and judicious economy. An overflowing
treasury had produced the habits of prodig
ality and extravagance which could only be
gradually corrected. The work required
both time and patience. I applied myself
diligently to this task from the begining.and
was aided by the able and energrtic efforts
of the heads of the different Executive De
partments. The result of our labors in this
good cause did not appear in the snm total
of our expenditures for the first two years,
mainly in consequence of the extraordinary
expenditure necessarily incurred in the
Utah expadition, and the very large amount
of the contingent expenses of Congress dur
ing this period. Thesejgreatly exceed the pay
and mileage of the members. For the year
ending 20th June, 1858; whilst the pay and
T"i!n 'T? fmr)'jr 1 to S1J90.214, thecontin-
inform you that during the last fiscal year,
ending on the 30th Juno 1860, the total ex
penditures of the government in all. its
branches legislative, executive, and judi
cialexclusive of the public debt, were re
duced to the sum of $55,402,459 46. This
conclusively appears from the books of the
Treasury. In the year ending on the 30th
June, 1858, the total expenditure, exclusive
of the public debt, amounted to 71,901,-
129 76, and that for tho year ending 30th of
dune, 185'J, to $00,340,226 13. Whilst the
books of the Treasury show an actual ex
penditure of $59,818,474 72 for the vcar
endi ng on the 30th June, 1860, including
$1,040,067 71 for the contingent expenses of
Congress, there must be deduceed from this
amount the sum of $4,296,009 26, with the
interest upon it of $150,000, appropriated
by the act of 15th February, 1860, "for the
purpose of supplying the deficiency in the
revenue, and-defraying the expense of the
Post OfHce Department for the year ending
thirtieth of June, one thousand eight hun
dred and fifty nine." This sum, therefore,
justly chargeable to tho year 1859, must bo
deducted from tho sam of $59,843,474 72,
in order to ascertain the expenituro for the
year ending on tho 30th June, 1860, which
leaves a balance for the expenditure of that
year of $55,402,404 40. The interest on the
public debt, including Treasury notes for
the same fiscal year ending on the 30th
June, 1800, amounted to $3,177,314 62,
which, added to the above sum of $55,402,
4G5 40, makes the aggregate of $53,576,780
08. It ought in justice to be observed that sev
eral of the estimates from tho departmen's
for tho year ending 30th June, 1SG0, were
reduced by Congress below what was and
still is deemed compatible with the public
interest. Allowing a liberal margin of $2,
500,000 for this reduction, and for other
causes, it may be safely asserted that the
sum of $61,000,000, or, at the most, $62,
000,000 is amply sufficient to administer the
Government and to pay the interest on the
public debt, unless contingent events should
hereafter "render extraordinary expenditures
necessary.
This result has been attained in a consid
erable degree by the care exercised by the
appropriate departments in entering into
public contracts. I have myself never in
terfered with tha award of any such con
tract, except in a Bingle case with the Col
oztnation Society, deeming it advisable to
cast the whole responsibility in each case
on the proper head of tho department, with
the general instruction that these contracts
should always be given to the lowest and
best bidder. It has ever been my opinion
that public contracts aro not a legitimate
source of patronage to be conferred upon
personal or political favorites; but that in
ull such cases a public officer is bound to act
for the Government as a prudent individual
would act for himself.
AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE, AC.
It is with great satisfaction I communi
cate tho fact that, since the date of my last
annual message, not a single slave has been
imported into tho United States in violation
of the laws prohibiting the African slave
trade. This statement is founded upon a
thorough examination and invcstitrarinn.xif '
tk vtti-jovt, injcou, ioe spirit wlucti pre
evailed some time among a portion of our fellow-citizens
in favor of this trade seems to
have entirely subsided.
I also congratulate you upon the public
sentiment which exists against the crime of
setting on foot military expeditions within
the limits of the United States, to proceed
from thence and make war upon the people
of unoffending States, with whom wo are at
peace. In this respect a happy change has
been effected since the commencement of my
Administration. It surely ought to be the
prayer of every Christian and patriot that
such expeditions may never again receive
countenance in our country or depart from
our nhores.
It would be a useless repetition to do
more than refer, with earnest commendation
to my former recommeudations in favor of a
Paciftic railroadof the grant of power to
the President to employ tho naval force in
the vicinitv. for the protection of the lives
and property of our fellow citizens passing
in tran-.it over the different Central Americ
an routes, against sudden and lawless out
breaks and depredations ; and also to pro
tect American merchant vessels, their crews
and cargoes, against violent and unlawful
seizure and confiscation in the ports of Mex
i Of and tho South American Republics, when
these may be in a disturbed and revolution
ary condition. It is my settled conviction,
that without such a power we do not afford
that protection to those engaged in the com
merce of the country which they have a
right to demand.
ELECT 10 X OF 11EUEESS OP COKCKESS.
I again recommend to Congress the pas
sage of a law in pursuance of the provisions
of the Constitution, appointing a day cer
tain, previous to the 4th of March, in each
year of an odd number, for the election of i
Representatives throughout all the States.
A similar power has already been exercised
with general approbation,
in tho appoint
ment of the same day throughout tho Union
for holding the election of electors for Pros-
ident and Vice President cf the United
States. My attention was earnestly direct
ed to this subject from the fact that the
Thirty-fifth Congress terminated on the 3d
of March, 1859, without making the neces
sary appropriation for the service of tho
Post Office Department. I was then forced
to consider the best remedy for this omission,
and an immediate call of the present Con
gress was the natural resort. Upon inquiry,
however, I ascertained that fifteen out of :,
the thirty-three States composing the Con
federacy were withflut Representatives, and
that, consequently, these fifteen States wo'd
bo disfranchised by 6uch a call. These fif
teen States will Le in the same condition on
tho 4th of March next. Ten of them cannot
elect Representatives, according to existing
State laws, until different periods, extending
from tho beginning of August next until
the months of October and November.
In my last message I gave warning that,
in a time of sudden and alarming danger,
the salvation of our institutions might de
pend upon the power of the President im
mediately to assemble a full Congress, to
meet the emergency.
TARIFF.
It is now quite evident that the financial
necessities of the Government will require
a modification of the tariff during your pre
sent session, for the purpose of increasing
the revenue. In this aspect, I desire to re
iterate the recommendation contained in my
last two annual messages, in favor of impo
sing specific instead of ad valorem duties on
all imported articles to which theso can be
properly applied. From long observation
and experience I am convinced that specific
duties are necessary, both to protect the
revenue and to secure to our manufacturing
interest that amount of incidental encour
agement which unavoidably results from a
revenue tariff.
As an abstract proposition it may be ad
mitted that ad valorem duties would, in the
ory, be the most just and equal. But if the
experience of this and of all other commer
cial nations has demonstrated that such du
ties cannot be assessed and collected with
out great frauds upon the revenue, then it
is the part of wisdom to resort to specific
duties. Indeed, from the very nature of an
ad valorem duty this must be the result.
Under it the inevitable consequence is, that
The temptations which ad valorem duties
present to a dishonest importer are irresisti
ble. His object is to pass bis goods through
the custom-house at the very lowest valua
tion necessary to save them from confisca
tion. In this he too often succeeds in spite
of the vigilance of the revenue officers.
Hence the resort to false invoices, one for
the purchase and another for the custom
house, and to other expedients to defraud
the government. The honest importer pro
duces his invoice to the collector, stating
the actual price at which he purchased tho
article abroad. Not so the dishonest import
er and the agent of the foreign manufactu
rer. And here it may be observed that a
very large proportion of the manufactures
imported from abroad ate consigned for sale
to commission merchants who are mere
agents employed by the manufacturers. In
such case no actual sale has been made to
fix their value. The foreign manufacturer,
if ho be dishonest, prepares an invoice of
the goods, not at their actual value, but at
tho very lowest rate necessary to escape de
tection. In this manner the dishonest im
porter and the foreign manufacturer enjoy a
decided advantage over the honest merchant.
They aro thus enabled to undersell tho fair
trader, and drive him from the market. ' In
fact, tho operation of this system has alrea
dy driven from the pursuits of honorable
commerce many of that class of regular
and conscientious merchants, whose charac
ter, throughout the world, is the pride of
our country.
The remedy for these evils is to be found
in specific duties, so far as this is practica
ble. They dispense with any inquiry at the
custom-house into the actual cost or value
of the artiele.and it pays the precise amount
of duty previously fixed by law. They pre
sent no temptations to tho appraisers of for
eign goods, who receive but small salaries,
and might by undervaluation in a few cases
render themselves independent.
Besides specific duties best conform to the
requisition in tne uonsiuuiion mat "no prci
erence shall be given by any regulation of
commerce or revenue to the ports of one
State over those of another." Under our
ad valorem system such preferences are to
some extent inevitable, and complaints have
often been made that the spirit of this pro
vision has been violated by a lower appraise
ment of the same articles at one port than
at another.
An impression strangely enough prevails
to soma extent that specific duties are nec
essarily protective duties. Nothing can be
more fallacious. Great Britain glories in
free trade, and yet her whole revenue from
imports is at the present momeut collected
under a system of specific duties. It is a
striking fact in this connection that, in the
commercial treaty of 23d January, 1860, be
tween France and England, one of the arti
cles provides that tho ad vatorem duties
which it imposes 6hall be converted into
specific (futies within six months from its
date, and these are to be ascertained by
by making an average of the prices far fix
months previous to that time. The reverse
of the proposition would be nearer to the
truth, because a mnnh Uroer nn ' "
enue would be collected by merely convert
intr
ing .the al tah.-.- A - mto
equivoicnt specific duties, lo this extent
the revenue would be increased, and in the
same proportion tho specific duty might bo
diminished.
Specific duties would secure to the Amer
ican manufacturer the incidental protection
to which he is fairly entitled under a rev
enue tariff, and to this 6urely no person
would object. The framers of the existing
tariff havs gone further, and in a liberal
spirit have discriminated in favor of large
and useful branches of our manufactures,
not by raising the rate of duty upon the im
portation of similar article? from abroad.but
what is the same in effect, by admitting ar
ticles ficeof duty which enter into the com
position of their fabrics.
Under the present system, it has been
oftn truly remarked that this
incidental
protection decreases when the manufacturer
' needs it most, and increases when he needs
it least and constitutes a sliding scale which
alwavs operates against him. The revenues
of the country are subject to similar fluctu
ations. Instead of approaching a steady
standard, as would be the case under a sys
tem of specific duties, they sink and rise
with the sinking and rising prices of arti
cles in foreign countries. It would not be
difficult fur Congress to arrange a system of
specific duties which would afford additional
stability both to our revenue and our manu
factures, and without injury or injustice to
anv interest of the country. This might be
! accomplished by ascertaining the average
i vaiue oi any uivcu uiuvio ui a osm.j ui
years at the place of exportation, and by
simply converting the rate of ad valorem
duty upon it which might be deemed ncces-
sary for revenue purposes into the form of
not injure the consumer. If he should pay
a greater amojnt ot duty one year, tins
would be counterbalanced by a lesser
amount the next, and in the end the aggre
gate would be the same.
I desire to call vour immediate attention
' to the present condition of tho Treasury, so i
I ably and clearly presented by the Secretary
in his report to Congress ; and to recom
mend that measures be promptly adopted,
to enable it to discharge its pressing obliga
tions. The other recommendations of the
report nre well worthy of your favorable
consideration.
I herewith transmit to Congress the re
ports of the Secretaries of War, of the Na
vy, of the Interior, and of the Postmaster
General. The recommendations and sug
gestions which they contain are highly val
uable, and deserve your careful attention.
The report of the Postmaster General de
tails the circumstances under which Corne
lius Vanderbilt, on my request, agreed, in
the month of July last, to carry tho ocean
mails between our Atlantic and Pacific
coasts. Had he not thus acted, this impor
tant intercommunication must have been
suspended, at least for a season. The Post
master General had no power to make him
any other compensation than the postages
on the mail matter which he might carry.
It was known at tho time that these posta
ges would fall far short of an adequate com
pensation, as well as of the sum which the
same service had previously cost the Gov
ernment. Mr. Vanderbilt, in a commenda
ble spirit, was willing to rely upon the jus
tice of Congress to make Hp the deficiency ;
and I, therefore, recommend that an appro
priation may be enmted for this purpose.
I should do great injustice to the Attorney
General, were I to omit the mention of his
distinguished services in the measures adop
ted and prosecuted by him for the defence
oi the Government against numerous and 1
unfounded claims to land in California, pur
porting to have been made by tho Mexican
Government previous to the treaty of ces
sion. The successful opposition to these
claims has saved to the United States publio
property worth many millions of dollars,
and to individuals holding title under them
to at least an equal amount.
It has been represented to me, from sour
ces which 1 deem reliable, that the inhabi
tants in several portions of Kansas have
been reduced nearly to a state of starvation,
on account of the almost total failure of their
crops, whilst the harvests in every other por
tion of the oountry have been abundant.
The prospect before them for the approach
ing winter is well calculated to enlist the
rJb o n r r3 f h d t i t n t ion
themselves. I refer the subject to Congress.
If any constitutional measure for their re
lief can be devised I would recommend its
adoption.
I cordially recommend to your favorable
regard the interests of the people of ths
District. They are eminently entitled to
your consideration, especially since, unlike
the people of the States, they can appeal to
no Government except that of tha Union.
JAMES BUCHANAN.
Washington Citv, 3d December, 1860.
STAR OF THE NORTH,
WM. H. J ACOBY, EDITOR.
BLOOMSCURC, WEDNESDAY, DEC. l, I860,
President's Message. The Annual Mes
sage of James Buchanan which was read on
the convening of Congress we publish en
tire. Much has been said, and more writ
ten, respecting the message of the President
touching the questions at issue between the
North'and South. If both sections will but
follow the wise and reasonable commenda
tions of the President, the fearful and alarm
ing crisis that is upon us may be averted
He agrees with the South that they have
just cause to complain of the North, but
that they can settle and adjut their griev
ances and procure the teparation required
better in the Union than out of it. He i
understood to recommend a general Con
vention of all the States for the purpose of
discossing calmly and deliberately all the
questions at issue. If the two section,
after a fair hearing on both sides, cannot
arrange the difference, if the North refuses
to concede the just and equitable demands
of the South, such as repealing the obnoxi
ous laws that are now upon the s'atute
books in many of the Slates, and guaran
teeing to the South her just rights nnu'er the
Constitution, then, if ihey must separate,
let it bein peace. The President maintains,
and very properly too, that by a little con
cession and forbearance on both sides the
impending disas'ers may be averted. He
also maintains that a State has not the con
stitutional right lo secede and i sustained
in his position by every member in the
Cabinet except Mr. Cobb and Thompson.
He arueb the question ably and eUborate-
Iv, but he will not attempt coercion. He
Will lotorm mo uuui, , ,, ..... - .
ihat whil be is President of U.ee Uuitfld
States he is bound by his oath to ee the
laws executed. The whole document is
mild and conciliatory throughout, as well
as sound and patriotic, it is deserving, at
the har.dsof our readers, a careful perusal.
The FIa of onr Union ForcTcr!
Ever tince we have had Ihe right to vo',
in fact ever tir.ee when as a beardless boy
we first learned from ihe historic pae, the
difficulties and trials that at'euded the foun ¬
dation of ihe glorious Government under
which we live, n ha been our ar lent and
cherished ientiment that this Union ought
to be regarded as the shield, the very
Palladium, of our liberties, and ibdt in
order to insure its strength and permane ice
tha Constitution, the bond which hoIJs the
Union logether,shouId be faithfully observed
by the people of all the States and that a
spirit of fraternal charity and kindness,
should be cul ivated between the different
eectior.s. For this reason we opposed, du
ring the last campaign, the "Republican"
agitators of the North, as well as those men
in the South, who, irritated and annoyed
I by the aggressions of Northern fanaticism,
eek lor redrtss of their
in
is
secession and disunion. Our
position
unchanged. We are for the Union as we
have always been. Bui whilst we are in
favor of maintaining the Union at all baz-
, a , (ac,s compe, us l0 IaJ. l!ie bIame of it,
present peril wholly to the charge of the
Abolitionists and Republicans of the North.
Os Wednesday last at the meeting ol
the Electoral College, in Harriburg, it was
whispered that the present S'ata Treasurer,
Eli Slifer, would be Secretary of Sute under
Curtin. This rumor comes from pretty
good authority, thus leaving very li"te t'oubt
as to its entire authenticity. It was also
6aid that Judge Wihnot would be appointed
Collector of Customs in Philadelphia.
This will cause a universal howl in that
city, as a great many hungry nail
ones have made up their minds
office in the marble palace. If
gets the appointment, the entire
starvec
to hold
Wilmot
Cuftom
House will be in the hands of our country
cousins who vegitate in the intensely dark
districts of Bradford, Tioga and Susquehan
na. Well, it will not be long now before
the fun will commence, when ve shall
hearlhe exultant laugh of the successful,
and the shrieks and groans of the wounded.
We'll lay back and enjoy the fun as te-t
we know how.
A great reaction is already taking place
in political matters. At ihe charter elec
tion in Norwak, Conn., a few 'days ago,
the Dem ocratic candidate for Mayor, was
elected by a large majority, and on a re
canvas of one of the legislate district in
Massachusetts where the the candidates
had run a tie vote, the Democratic candi
date was elected by over 100 majori'y.
The Committee of Ways and Mean of
the House hive been occupied in devising
measures to relieve the government from
its financial embarrassments, and wiil
shortly report a bill authorizing an issue o:
Treasury notes, probably to the amount of
ten millions.
The vote of Illinois in the late Presiden
tial race stands as follows : Lincoln,
1725 95; Douglass, 1663 32; Bell, 4951
Breckinridge, 2399. Tbe little Giant does
not run far behind the big Giant. AI
combined have a majority, over Lincoln of
South Carolina.
