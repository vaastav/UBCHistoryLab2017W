Hi War mm the PreekEeae?The Key-aate
9* tha PrcaMeatlal Oaa?al|a Saaadad
fraa Tlrdala.
Two years ago Gilbert 0. Walker was
elected Governor of Virginia orer H. H.
Wells. Although the former was a conserva
tive and the latter a radical, both were
republicans prominently identified with the
war against secession, and of the
two, Walknr was regarded as the
especial supporter of General Grant,
who, if we remember correctly, wrote a letter
endorsing the principiea upon which the con
servative candidate conducted the campaign.
Nevertheless, Governor Walker now opens the
war against the national administration
with force and vigor, and in his
annual Message to the Legislature of
the State or Virgins, published in the
IIebald to-day, sounds the key-note of the
coming Presidential campaign. As General
Lee, of Virginia, marshalled and led the forces
of (he Southern secessionists against the gov
ernment of the United States in 1 SGI, so
Governor Walker, of Virginia, essays to marshal
and lead the forces of the secessionists from
republicanism against the federal administra
tion In 1871, the difference between the two
being that, whilo L?e was a born and bred
Virginian, Walker belongs to the tribe of
carpet-baggers who were thrown Into
political prominenoe in the Southern
Stales through the instrumentality of
the war. It is evident that Governor
Walker has been studying the portents in
the political sky, and foreseeing the approach
ot a grand revolutionary movement In the
ranks of his own party, and believing that he
discovers the promise of a union of all oppo
sition elements, including the leaderless and
objectless democracy, against General Grant
in tho campaign of next year, he has boldly
determined t j tako the initiative, and to give
to C engross the cue upon which to start the
ball from the elevation of the national Capitol.
The Governor's Message is a lengthy and
elaborate do .'union*, and, so far as it
I refers to State matters, appears to be
unusually interesting, if we may judge from
the synopsis which reached us at an early
hour this morning. He declares that
tho novel experiment of universal
suffra e and equal rights before the
law, first voluntarily inaugurated in Virginia
and faithfully and impartially tried, has proved
a success ; or, rather, that if left to work itself
out under favorable circumstances and without
undue interference, it would eminently con
duce to a good and stable rebuilding of
the government. "The great need of V.rginia
to-day," savs the Governor, "is capital
and populationnnd these he evidently
believes would flow libera 1/ into the State
under the attractions of equtllzUion of taxa
tion and a thorough system of free education,
if the State government could only be left
to itself without the intermeddling of federal
authority. After reviewing the financial policy
adopted by the General Assembly, which the
Governor heartily endorses, the Message pro
ceeds to arraign the administration of General
Grant in a ecathing manner. The interference
cf the federal government with State affairs,
the suspension of the habeas corpus, the mar
shalling of United States bayonets
around the polls, the assignment of
a federal gunboat to point its
loaded cannon on a city during an election in
order to intimidate voters; the arbitrary arrest
of citizens in time of peace?all these aots he
charges upon the administration and brands
them as wanton attacks upon the liberties of
the people and the free Institutions of
the country. He declares that tho absorption
of thn powers and functions of Slates by the
federal government was as foreign to the de
sign of the founders of the republic as was
the nullification or repudiation of federal
authority t>y the individual action of the
States, for the triumph of either usurpation in
volves the destruction of the Union.
Nor does he regard the war of
secession from which the nation hap
pily came out victorious, if not un
wonnded, as any more fraught with danger
to the life of the republio than is the alleged
attempt of the federal administration to atrip
the States of their liberty and independence,
under the pretended necessity of enforcing
the national laws and protecting the
rights of the people under them.
"We have passed the ordeal of
secession," says Governor Walker, "but the
recoil has carried us to the other extreme?
the danger of centralization; and the perils
that menaced the Union in 18G1 are finding a
parallel in 1871."
Whatever may be thought of the indictment
thus brourht against the administration of
General Grant, there is no doubt good
ground for complaint at the politi
cal tinkering in the Southern States,
which has been going on ever since
the cessation of the war, and in
which both political parties have bad an
equal hand. The great game of the aspirants
for a continuance of office, or for the succes
sion to power, has been the control of the
reconstruct'd S.ates, and to this probably the
Virginians owe their present Chief Executive.
If the South had been left to itself, free
alike from the intrigues of the carpet
buggers and the undue intermeddling
of the federal government, nearly
ail the States would have been to-day at
peace, with equal rights secured to all their
inhabitants?black, while and copper-colored.
The true safety of the freed men lay not in the
protection of United States bayonets, but
in the political status conferred upon them
by the consequence of the war. The
necessity of making friends of those who, in
many instances, bold a controlling power
over the ballot box, would have soon taught
tho most hot-beadod rebel a lesson of pru
dence, and State governments, eager for
popular support, would have speedily made an
end of all Ku Klux troubles. As it is,
a great portion of the South, six years after
the war, is disorganized and distracted, the
people held under the iron rule of martial
law, and the Stale governments paralyzed.
This is an injury, not to the South alone,
but to the whole Union, and the
Booner tho political harpies on both
sides take their bands off the reconstructed
States, tho boiler will it be for the prosperity
aud progress of the whole nation. Governor
Walker announces his platform to be, inviola
bility of the writ of habeas corpus ; subordina
tion of military to civil authority i honesty and
economy in the admlnstration of publio affaire;
equalization and reduction of tariffs and taxes
to the lowest point consistent with the main
tenance of the publio credit; free education
for all; a fostering care, encourage
ment and elevation of labor, and
universal amnesty and impartial suffrage.
Whether this pronunciamento will make him
an available candidate for the Presidency on
the ticket of the Grand Liberal Union party is
a subject for future consideration.
Coasreas Yesterday?A Dull Day.
The proceedings of Congress yesterday were
characterised by extreme dulness. No sub
ject of public interest or importance came up
in either House. The Senate did not remain
in open session longer than an hour, when, on
the receipt of the correspondence in reference
to the Catacazy matter, it went into executive
session. There were some resolutions pre
sented In the open session for the arrest of
recusant witnesses in the Ku Klux investiga
tion ; but that whole matter has come to bo
regarded in the light of an unmitigated -nui
sance, having not the least interest for the
general public. If everything connected with
it could be allowed to sink out of sight for
ever it would be a relief to the whole country.
In tho House a resolution was adopted, on
the motion of tho Chairman of the Committee
on Foreign Affairs (Mr. Banks), calling on
the President foi information as to the in
structions givon to our naval commanders in
the Cuban waters, as to further particulars
connected with the brutal execution of tho
Havana students who were charged with the
desecration of Castofion's grave, and as
to the failure of the Spanish govern
ment to carry out promised reforms in
the West Indian colonies. Mr. Banks probably
expects to make the response the groundwork
for a report from bis committee, in which our
government is to be placed in a hostile atti
tude to that of Spain. A large part of the
time during which the House sat yesterday
was frittered away in a fruitless attempt to
have a new drawing for seats, and la the read
ing of a voluminous bill codifying the postal
laws. Subsequently tho House took up the
bill for the apportionment of Representatives
to Congress, but had made no disposition of it
np to tho time of adjournment.
The Proposed Funion Party?Senator Trum
bnll's Objections?The Anti-(?runt ICcpiib
licans Hacking Down.
Senator Trumbull, according to the Louie
ville Journal, has been interviewed by an
ex-United States Senator on the project of a
coalition between tho democracy and the anti
Grant republicans in the coming Presidential
election, and from the report of this interview
it appears that Mr. Trumbull whistles the
project down tho wind. He would not, for
many reasons, run as a Presidential
enndidate against General Grant. He
thinks the time has not oome, North
or South, and especially South, for a
reconstruction of parties; that the defeat
of General Grant in 1S72 would result in a
Southern reaction which would be worse
than the present state of affairs; that General
Grant, in the main, is a conservative man,
and that the proposed democratic passive
policy will be a failure. From all this, and
much more from Mr. Trumbull to the same
effect, it is clear that his mind is fixed upon
General Grant for 1872 against any opposi
tion, coaltion or new departure.
In the next place, we understand that
Senator Sutnner is not in the fusion market;
that Gnoral Logan is coming round, and that
Mr. Fenton and Mr. Greeley can be reconciled
with a few sops from the Custom House.
This leaves the anti-Grant republican sore
heads pretty much in the hands of M: ssrs.
Grata Brown, Carl Schurx and George Wilkes;
and we are afraid that their followers will not
be sufficiently numerous to encourage the
democracy to try the "passive policy" under
the confederate flag of a republican bolter.
In short, we think that Mr. Trumbull is right
in his opinion that this proposed new party
coalition movement againjt General Grant
"will be a failure." We see that Governor
Hoffman goes in for this coalition; but the
downfall of Tammany has made a new de
parture necessary for the Governor, and he Is
wiso enough to recognise the fact. The pro
jected Holy Alliance, however, comes too late
for 1872 and loo soon for 1876; and the wisest
course for the democracy under the circum
stances is that recommended by Mr. Voor
hees, of Indiana?viz., a national convention
of the party as soon as possible in < rder to
hold the party together.
Baalneo* la the Aapreaie Court.
It was an unusually busy day yesterday in
the Supreme Court, General Term, and the
cases before it were unusually important. In
the first place a decision was rendered in the
Riverside Park assessment matter, sustaining
the appeal from the order of the Special Term
confirming the report of the Commissioners of
Estimate and Assessment. New commission
) ers are to be appointed, who will be named
on the settlement of the order. Another de
cision was rendered which will cause rejoic
ing?though not extending beyond this special
circle?among the friends of the two youthful
light weight contestants, Edwards and Collins.
These pugilistic gladiators, afier their fisticuff
encounter on Long Island, were sentenced to
one year's bard labor at the Penitentiary on
Blackweli's Island and to pay a fine of one thou
sand dollars each. Tho Court decided that
their conviction was not legal and granted their
release. Both, however, have been pretty well
"punished" by their several months of imprison
ment and labor, and as thoy declare their
intention to abandon the profession in future
the result of the decision is perhaps, after
ail, not to be greatly deplored. Subsequent
to this arguments were beard in the cases of
Lookup Evans, convicted of abortion; William
Okell, convicted of receiving stolon bonds,
and McCarty, convicted of the murder of
Clinn. The end sought In the appeals from
their convictions is to secure for each a new
trial. The Court reserved its decision in each
case, but will probably announce the same in
a few days.

lag Up Brtwrcn HhhU G*rM?r
A cable despatch, special to the Hkbald,
Informs us that the Roumanian government
has received a protest from Constantinople
against a treaty, said to have been concluded
some two years ago, between the government
of the Caar on the one hand and the govern
ment of Prince Charles on the other. The
treaty In question gave Russia certain privi
leges in the matter of consular jurisdiction,
and the government of the Sultan protests
against it on the ground that it is in direct
violation of the terms of the Treaty of Paris.
Our correspondent adds that the protest is
credited to the influence of Bismarck. Bis
marck, it is said, is perfeotly indifferent to
the interests of Prince Charles. His purpose
seems to be to hurry up a difficulty with
Russia, and, apparently with this end in view,
he has persuaded the Porto to mako a bold
assertion of its sovereign rights. There is
something truly Bismarckian about this stroke
of polloy. It completely Isolates Russia from
the rest of Europe. For a time it did seem as
if Russia might succeed in playing the rob of
the friend of Turkey. Bismarck, however,
with his usual sharpness, has got ahead ot
Gortchakoff, and in the event of war
breaking out Turkey will be tho useful ally,
not of Russia, but of Germany and Austria.
On the part of the Prussian Chancellor this is
a bold stroke of policy, and it will not be won
derful if in the early summer it shall have pro
duced such bitter fruit that war will be a
necessity. Germany must have the German
provinces of Austria sooner or later, and Aus
tria must find compensation in the Lower
Danube. In other words, Francis Joseph will
give up to Germany Upper and Lower Austria,
and take Roumania in exchange. This is
what we have always said, and our predic
tions now begin to find fulfilment.
It is quite manifest that Russia, on the one
hand, and Germany and Austria on the other,
are fully aware that a conflict must come;
and we are not in ignoranoe of the fact that
both sides are making war preparations on the
most gigantic scale. Prussia has secured and
laid aside her enormous war fund, and from
English sources we have information that
Russia is rapidly concentrating ber forces on
tho southwestern frontier, apparently with the
object of overawing Austria. This action
would seem to indicate an intention on the
part of Russia to take the initiutive in tho
inevitable conflict for the supremacy of
Europe; Cut we do not believe that
any such intention exists on the
part of the Russian government. The
concentration of the troops in grand
camps Is no proof that it is intended to assume
the offensive, and may be only dictated by
prudential motives. Owing to the great ex
tent of the Russian torritory, and the limited
capacity of her railways to transport troops
and maUritl, it is of the first importance to
assemble the army on strategic points, so
that in tho event of hostilities the different
corps should not be exposed to be beaten in
detail. Germany, with her splendidly organ
ized transport system, can concentrate rapidly
the whole strength of the Confederation on any
given point at very short notice, and the Rus
sians have had examples in the wars with
Austria and France of the danger of keeping
troops scattered and isolated when exposed
to atiack from a bold and enterprising enemy,
and they are resolved not to be guilty of the
imprudence which brought disaster to the
arms of both these Powers. It is to this cause
that we are inclined to attribute the reported
concentration of troops towards the south
western frontier; and it furnishes a
more reasonable explanation than to
suppose that Russia has resolved to pre
cipitate a struggle for which she cannot be
prepared, and in whioh defeat involves ruin
and the loss of all she has gained within the
past century. Though we are aware that un
oeasing activity has prevailed In the Russian
arsenals since the outbreak of the Franco
Prussian war, yet we believe that even the
supply of field ordnance and maUriel is still
defective. In the matter of army organization
the now system has not had timo to be con
solidated, and though the army has been
greatly Increased in numbers we doubt if its
efficiency has not been temporarily impaired.
Of course all these considerations are fully
recognized both at St. Petersburg and Berlin,
but they suggest very different lines of policy
at the rival ca pilals.
It is evident that the interest of Rnssia
points to delay, and we cannot believe that her
statesmen would rashly enter upon a straggle
where there is so much to lose when the
chances of success are so doubtful. We are
convinced that Russia will not take the initia
tive, but will rathor seek to restrain Prussia
and Austria by such a demonstration of force
as will make them pause before entering lightly
on a war policy. This we believe to be the
(rue solution of the movement of tho Russian
forces. The voting of the War Fund bill under
extraordinary pressure from Bismarck, and the
extensive war preparations of Prussia have pro
bably alarmed Russia, so that she has made up
her mind to prepare for eventualities. Bis
marck's speech in the German Parliament left
no doubt as to the purpose to which the war
fund was to be applied. It is true, he carefully
avoided alluding to Russia by nam?; but
when be spoke of Germany being threatened
bis words could only apply to the Northern
Power. Bismarck, who is not rnuoh givon to
cause needless alarm unless when he has an
object to be served, intended bis speech to
prepare the public mind for a crusade against
Russia by creating the belief that her power
threatened the independence of Germany.
The present time is so favorable for a trial of
strength with Russia that Bismarck must be
anxious to profit by the chance which pre
sents itself to crush her, as so good a one may
never occur again. Should ho succeed tho
supremacy of Germany in Europe would be
assured and the ambitious dream of the Ber
lin Court fulfilled. Von Moltke and Bismarck
are not likely to let pass so groat an oppor
tunity to crown the work of consolida
tion and aggrandizement. It is, there
fore, to Berlin that wo shall look for
the first acts of hostility. Russia oan derive
no advantage from a change in her present
attitude of watchful and energetic prepara
tion to an aggressive policy. It is so clearly
her interest to wait and seoure time to com
plete tho reorganization of her military forces
and the construction of thoso strategic lines
of railwav whioh must inorease enormously
the availability of ber resources that we do not
believe her government will commit the folly of
engaging In war onleM attacked. The object
of a concentration of troops would be twofold i
in the first place for strategic reasons, in
order to be ready to meet attack with the
whole foroe of the empire; and, saoondly, to
restrain Austria and Prussia from hostile ac
tion by showing the forward state of the Mus
covite preparations. The advantages of the
defensive policy are so evident that we feel
certain the Russian government will not make
the mistake oi entering on a war policy for
some years to come.
But the interests of Germany and Austria
demand Immediate action, becauso every
year's delay not alone allows the organisation
of the immense resouroos of Russia, but
raises ber up an ally in France. We
may, therefore, assume that tho reported
movements of troops are due to some now
plot of the wily Bismarck. No doubt the
Russian Court is well informed of every act
and projeot of the German Chanoellor, and is
ever on the watoh to counteract his designs.
To hnmble the power of Russia is so uecessary
to the greatness of Germany that there can be
no reasonable doubt that Bismarck will not
fail to take advantage of the present favorable
condition of Europe to try issues with his
gigantic neighbor. He oannot be blind to the
fact that, as long as Russia maintains her
present power and influence in Europe, the
work of German unity will be in danger. As
a matter of self-preservation Germany finds
herself compelled to undertake new and doubt
ful conflicts, and each day that the struggle
is put off diminishes her ohanoes of
success. The recuperation of France and
the development of the resourcoa of
Russia are evidently merely questions of
time, and since it is acknowledged on all sides
that a struggle for supromaoy must take place
between Russia and Germany it is plainly the
interest of the latter to fight as soon as pos
sible, so that Russia may bo forced to contend
single-handed. When Bismarck obtained from
the German Parliament the continuance for
three years of the war budget ho was actuated
by hostile intentions towards Russia. No other
Power could protend to be a danger to United
Germany, and when the German Chanoellor
Insisted on the necessity of oontinued prepara
tion to protect the Fatherland from menace his
words were in effect a threat against Russia.
And the Prussian Parliament voted the money
to enable Bismarck to bumble their colossal
neighbor. In view of this declaration of hos
tility Russia has thought well to prepare for
events. This latest piece of news strengthens
the belief that Bismarck Is not prepared to
give Russia the advantages that cannot fail to
result from delay.
We are assured by cable telegram from
Vienna that the Russian government has for
warded its congratulations to Count Andrassy
on his elevation to the Premiership of Austria,
assuring him, at the same time, "that His
Majesty the Csai has full confidence in the
wisdom and justice of the policy which will
be pursued undor bis administration of the
foreign relations of Austria." This action is
remarkably significant, pointing as it docs to
a Russian endeavor to estrange Austria as a
German power.
The Mm?fn la Bnflud.
Oar President's Message makes a favorable
impression In England, and is favorably re
ceived by the press. Satisfaction is generally
expressed with the spirit in whioh onr rela
tions with Great Britain are treated, and the
opinion is almost unanimous that nover at any
time has a more flattering exhibit been made
of the condition of the country. The London
Times, however, regrets the threatened aboli
tion of the income tax without the adoption of
a substitute; but the Times forgets that no
substitute is wanted. We can dispense with
the revenue colieoted from these income taxes,
and get on very well without a substitute.
General Grant has simply adopted the idea
that in the reduction of the national debt
already achieved such assurances have been
given of the onpaolties and the fixed purpose
of the country to meet all its obligations, that
we can with propriety go on with the redemp
tion of the debt at considerably less than the
extraordinary figure of one hundred millions a
year. Hence his recommendation for the
reduction of our internal and external taxes,
including the abolition of all our internal
taxes except those on wines, spirituous and
malt liquors, tobacco and stamps.
The President's recommendations on the
subject are sound and universally approved
by the oountry; but as to what will be done
by Congress upon the lino of tax reductions
recommended no man can tell. Wo presume,
however, that the Income tax will be abolished,
and most, if not ail, the other internal taxes
suggested as surplusage by the President;
but on the tariff question thero is such a con*
flict of opinions in the House of Representa
tives thai it is possible there may be no agree
ment in that body this session upon any bill
of reductions. Meantime the important fact
which stands out in the boldest relief is this,
that our present national taxes, internal and
tariff, are far in excess of the wants of the
government, immediate or prospective, and
they ought to be reduced.
Thiers, Bismarck and the Pope.?We
are specially informed by cable telegram from
Paris that President Thiers has demanded of
the Holy See the recall of Prince do Chigi
Albani as Nuncio of the Vatican to the French
republic. Bismarck is said to havo influenced
the action of Thiers. The merits of the case,
as against Prince Ciiigi-Albani, are not stated
particularly, but we suspect they will be made
plain in a very brief space of time in the light
of the question of the East. Prinoe Chigl is
Guardian of the Reman Conolavo and a Mar
shal of the Roman Church. The Church has
turned its eyes towards the holy shrines in
Turkey just at the moment when Russia, Ger
many and Austria are peering with unusual
earnestness in the same direction. Prince
Chtgi-Albani may have expressed an opinion
to the effect that Franoo is out in tlio cold and
that ths empire missed a grand opportunity iu
Turkey, as has the republio so far. The
clerics of the Russo-Greek Chnroh may arrive
At the grand objectivo point in the East first,
notwithstanding all the disappointments which
the Czirs have endured since Suwarrow
drilled his Cossacks in Ismail in 17A0.
The Perkins Claim Against Russia.?It
oommenced in gunpowder, and is likely to

The OMiMir Qimnm
Tbe question of the reoall of Minister Oata
easy is fairly opened by the partial publioa
tion of tbe correspondence on the subjeot, and
we can now get at tbe merits of it. Mr. Cam
eron, who presented the resolution oalling for
this correspondence, is tbe Chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations in the Senate,
having superseded Mr. Sumner on the reor
ganization of tbe Senate committees at the
beginning of this Congress, last Maroh, be
cause tbe personal relations between Sumner
and the President and Secretary of State were
oi that character whioh prevented a confiden
tial intercourse between the parties on publio
affairs. Mr. Cameron, politically and per
sonally, being in perfect accord with the Presi
dent and enjoying the most friendly rela
tions with tbe Secretary of State, may be con
sidered as acting by authority In this afore
said resolution. The oonoluslon inevitably
follows that General Grant desires the official
correspondence on this Catacazv question to'
be made public, because he is confident that
the publio judgment in the matter will be tbe
condemnation of the "inexousable" Mr.
Catacazy, a conclusion further oonfirmed by
the promptness with whioh the correspon
dence was furnished to the Senate.
The President, on this subjoot, in his Mes
sage, says :?"The intimate friendly relations
whioh have so long existed between the United
States and Russia continue undisturbed;**
that "tbe visit of the third son of the Emperor'
is a proof that there Is no desire on the part
of his government to diminish the cordiality
of those relations;" that "the hospitable
reception which has been given to the Grand
Duke is a proof that on our side wo share tbe
wishes of that government," but that "the
inexousable course of tbe Russian Minister at
Washington rendered it neoessary to ask hb
rooall, and to decline to receive that function
ary as a diplomatic representative," Ac. The
question to be settled was, therefore, in what
consists this "inexousable course of the Rus
sian Minister?" and the correspondence
settles It It assures us that Mr. Oataoasy
officiously interfered in matters pertaining
altogether to American home politios, "ap
proached" Senators and Representatives with
arguments and exhortations upon measures
then pending in Congress, and indiscreetly
denounced high officials of our government
and acted in other ways unbecoming a foreign
Minister. Secretary Fish represented the
case, through Minister Curtin, to Mr. West- ?
mann, the Chancellor aid to Prince Gortcbsr
koff, and requested Mr. Catacazy's instant
withdrawal. Some delay oocurred, Gortoha
koff being in Germany, and Westmann de
clining to act upon the matter himself; bat
Secretary Fish insisted, would hear of no
delay, and declared that, as oommunioation
with Prinoe Gortchakoff was easy, he must
have an auswer. The answer oame, requestr
ing that Mr. Catacazy be tolerated until aftor
the Prince's visit. The request was acquiesoed
in, and Mr. Catacazy now ooases to b9 the
Russian Minister to this country.

Govemsr Leslie in his messogh to the Legislator*
is very severe on lawlessness, lie says mob law is
no remedy for anything, and if a mob inflict death
on any one, all who countenance the act are entity
or murder. He recommends additional legis
lation wbloh will more certainly reach unlawful
organizations, and evil disposed persons, and for
Imposing more stringent uud severe penalties on
public officials for tailuro or neglect to enforce the
criminal laws. He savs:?"I am profoundly'
impressed with tho urgont necessity or
8omeinlng being done to effectually cheek
and break up disorders. The unwarranted
interference of the ledoral authorities lu
local affairs, has provoked and Aggravated much ot
oi tlio lawlessness existing among us. He recom
mends the passing of an act admitting
negroes as witnesses In tho courts on
the same footing as other citizens. Also
, an act admitung parties to an action,
i and all interested in the issue, as competent wit
