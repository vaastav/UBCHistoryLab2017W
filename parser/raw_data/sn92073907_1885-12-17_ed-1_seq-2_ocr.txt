THE DEMOCRAT.
W. W. KITCI1IN. Editor.
Tburday, Icc. IT, 1885.
Uncivil Service Reform.
J6s3Te prefer a Democrat to a Repub
lican of equal character.
ESTXo honest and true Republican
asks to beretained, and none other should
be retained. In the South a sweep with
a eleati broom is demanded by all Demo
crats BS&-'Turri the rascals out."
TEE POWER TO TAX IS THE
POWER TO DESTROY.
The privilege to as3oss our property
for its value is an implied right to
take all if the emergency should
seem to demand it. The Constitu
tion gives Congress power to . raise
by taxation moi.ey enough to defray
thejiesessary expenses f the govern
ment and if these expenses shall
continue to increase, it will not take
a prophet to predicW.be time when it,
will take all the available, commead
able measures of the people to defray
the expenses oft the government.
We are both disappointed and morti
fied that our President, in his manifes
to to Congress did not dwell on, and
urge Congress to reduce the expenses
cf the sovernuient, bv abolishing
many useless offices, and reducing the
salaries of many more. - But he is as
dumb as an oyster and as blind as a
bat on this all important subject.
Instead cf coming up to the demands
of the times and the pledges of the
party, he has advised the increase of
the salaries of many of his ftp
pointces and the creation of some
newolEces. - Instead of levying forty
million dollars less this fiscal year
than the republicans levied the last
ncai year, ne ana hi3 secretaries
have demanded of Congress thirty
three million more. This is reduc
ing expenditures and lightening the
burdens of the people with a vim,
and keeping the democratic pledges
to a letter ! 3Ir. Manning in his re
port to Congress says the war tariff
ought to be reduced. We think so
too. Hut our President doe en't think
so if he does he did not say so. With
trie same force, we think both the
President and his secretaries mi" lit
have said really the salaries of
the government agents and olficials
w ere fixed during and immediately
afu-r the war, under republican rule,
ami ought to be reduced. They
could in truLh h.vvv said that during
thsr period the increase was -from
feisty mi! lions ! ;i! -out three hundred
ifiiihoiis. N.nv why not cut dowu
these expenses and abolish many of
th-: sinecure places, as well as cut
down- i he waraxes. We think thev
go tog. h- rand ought to be cut. down
iiiiifas or.e and at the same time.
It required sixty millions of dollars
to run ibis government, under Bueh
an.Mn per annum, from 1857 to 18G1
making two hundred and forty mill
ions for the tour j-eara. We had a
popuirion then of about thirty mill
ions of people, we have now abont
fif";y eight millions. Now it takes

A man can now live on half of

civil service hunibng, and what can
explain the positions of the remain
ing admirers we know not, unless
with republicans it is to keep their
friends in and, too,nnless with dem
ocrats it is because they are dissafc
isfied with their own success in
the party and don't want to see true
democrats in the front and there
fore they too wish the republicans
kept in office.
The Cab:.et officers are exempt
from the civil service examination
because the people have confi
dence in the President's sense and
discretion to select competent men.
The foreign ministers are exempt
from the humbug of examinations
because it is conceded that the
appointing power has sense and dis
cretion enough not to select either
an idiot or a tyrranical demagogue.
The assistant cabinet officers
stand no examinations because .it
is believed that the President. and
the cabinet officers have sense and
discretion enough to make no big
mistakes. All this is right. Jefferson
and Buchanan and Hendricks be
lieved in this
And now the civil service act ad
vocate conies and plainly and ua
questionably says,for actions speak
louder than words, "Mr. President
and Mr. Cabinet officer, you have
sense enough to make an appoint
ment which it takes education,
brains and statesmanship to fill
but you havo not got sense enough
to make an appointment which
netds only business qualities in the
officer, therefore I sav we ought to
keep an official in for life when we
get a competent one. You will,
it left by yourselves uurestrieted
select a focJ.an incompetent man,an
ignoramus, a hotheaded, reckless
partisan demagogue." Thus says
the L. S. reformer and our Presi
dent Cleveland in his message has
said and his cabinet too. "Yes
Curtis & Co. you are right;
We need a law to keep us from act
ing fools." Shame, shame upon
democracy. A Jackson is not our
President, a Jefferson is not our
President. What a pity! This
British system of life tenure of office
is the first seed of despotism and
monarchy. The Blair bill is a curse
upon the individuality of States and
iiouiiis, mo cin service act is
a curse upon the name of Repub
lic,

THE MESSAGE.
(Communicated)
We have waited patiently for the
President's message to Congress,
hoping that he would redeem himself
in the eyes of all men everywhere,
by washing his hand of wu mpism
and mugism, and by rising to the
height and measure of a full g-own
statesman. But we were doomed
to sad disappointment.
On all minor questions npon which
he had been fully informed and posted
by the reports of his Secretaries, he
takes a manly, dignified position
And in the outset we will say thai we
must heartily approve of all her says
so far as he weut on all except -the
Tariff, Silver, and Civil Service re
form questions. We were in hopes
he would make many suggestions and
point out many ways by which the
government could . be administered
on less money and the burdens of the
people made lighter. But in his judg
ment other things demanded all his
time and attention such as increas
ing the salaries of his three unconsti
tutional civil service bed-fellows and
wumpish pets and increasing- the
salaries and outGts of our Ministers
Consuls etc., a useless appendage
to a Republican form of govern
ment m these days of civilization,
railroad and teleg.aphs and cabl
graphs, in foreign lands.
Upon the Tar.tF question, one" of
the great issues of the day,, he strad
dies the fence.and is making a desper
ate effort to walk arm-clutched with
both Sam Randall and John .G. Ca v
iisle as though he possessed the mi
raculous power of causing oil and
water to mix.
Upon the civil service qnco,ion he
goes into spasms, and doesn't th?nk

The author of the Federal peda
gogy bill, Blair by name, is .evi
dently a dissatisfied man, a com
plete moralist, perhaps a crank. He
is a' New Englander and talking
about strange notions, he has them.
What a reformer he is ! No wonder
he'is in tavdr of Federal free schools.
The N. Y, World has the following :
'.'Senator Blair is on hand to re
form things. He wants the Consti
tution of the United States amend
ed so" that women can vote and men
can be prevented from drinking
whiskey.- Mr. Blair would doubt
less, like to have , the privilege of
writing an entirely new Constitution
for us." .

CIVIL SERVICE ACT.
ftie advocates of the present useless-
and undemocratic law iu re
gard to the civil service found their
position upon false grounds. The
presumption that any sach law is
needed is entirely erroneous. Why?
Because it is a presumption that a
higher officer, that is the one who
appoints, will appoint an intompe-
nujjiuiuaio. xs iuis not a
fatsa presumption? Jefferson,Mon
roe, Jackson and the other grand
light houses along the coast of
American politics of the past, and
the great defenders and advocates
of real democracy never felt, never
suspected, never imagined the need
of any restrictions upon the ap
pointing powers m order to secure
eomp3teni subordinates. The sen
timents of the President of the
States ' as set forth

ejho of those of Curtis, and all over
