Amsterdam, .Dec. 6. The former
German crown prince, trduging over

of Wleringen, says a correspondent
of the Telegraaf. Frederick Willi
am declares that what he misses
most is a riding horse.
He plays billards with the -villagers
and treats them to drinks and
smokes and buys candy for the chil
dren. 'The younger Hohenzollern has his
breakfast at 8:3o o'clock and his din
ner at 7 p. m. He eats oysters and
drinks champagne regularly, unlike
his father, who dines plainly. Never
theless, he is reported to suffer from
fits of depression.
Sometimes, according to eye-witnesses,
he dons a full uniform, re
splendent with medals, and parades
in front of the mirror. He then re
sumes a woolen sweater and knicker
bockers and plays the violin. He is
said to have a deep dread of Spanish
influenza and takes preventive medi
cine regularly. He becomes extreme
ly nervous it is said, when strangers
near him make abrupt movements.

A NEW GYPSY SONG
From "Monday Musings," in the Liv
ing Church.
The sin that grows and thrives,
And the open trail and free,
A staff and a pack and One
To take the trail with me.
Over the hills that lure,
Under the trees that sway,
Laughing and strong, and poor,
'Out on the wander way!
The wind, and the sun. and the sky
A star-strewn vault at night,
And two hearts beating high,
A thrill with an old delight,
Out from the fret of the town,
Free from the ties that gail,
Venturing up and down,
Under the wander thrall.
The sky, and the sun ,and the wind,
And One on the road 1 fare,
Slender and physy-skinned,
My gypsy ways to share,
Life is void of stress,
Love that is real and true;
The roadl and the wind's caress,
Sun and the sky and you!

es were written by Private Murphy
on the day of the decoration of the
colors of the 104th regiment by the
French government. It was a uni
que and remarkable honor, as it in
cluded each member of the regiment:
Onward 104th!
Advance, you brave and noble band,
Hold forth your colors true
That France may place the Croix de
Guerre
Upon its folds of blue.
O! One-o-fourth your fame is won,
How well you've proved your worth,
You've scorned the fire of iiostile
guns
As round theyowed the earth.
You've beaten back their mightiest
men,
You've shown America's might.
In face of all their slighting words
You've proved that we can fight.
You've waded through the mud of
France,
You've been through rain and cold,
And laughed at hardships, hunger,
thirst,
As did the knights of old.
No Hearing (bands applaud your
work,
iNo crowds stand by to cheer.
But far across that broad expanse
They know you have no fear,
'Tis there your work is watched with
pride,
Tls there your glory lies,
And there they pray your safe re
turn With brave but tear-stained eyes.
Go forth, my boys, as in the past,
Let hot your spirit fall.
Remember those at home depend
On the first to answer the call.
Go forth and teach the hostile Hun
The good he's been taught to spurn
And plant in his misguided mind
The lesson he's bound to learn.
And at the struggle's glorious end
When cannon cease to roar,
When the Hun has learned his lesson
And the reign of hate is o'er,
'Tis then you'd 1 get the credit,
The love that will never cease,
When you've made this torn and
bleeding world
A tranquil home of peace.
'Tis then amid the blaring bands,
Through streets of friends galore,
You'll march with pride amid applause
Of those whose hopes you bore,
And then the folks widl show the love
That they are holding now.
Go to it. boys of the One-o-fourth,
You've proved that you know how.

Washington Dec. 6: In telling
his story of German propoganda in
America, A. Bruce A. Bielaski, chiet
of the bureau of investigation of the
department of justice, today laid be
fore the senate committee investigat
ing brewery and German propoganda
ciablegrfams exchanged in 1916 be
tween Ambassador Bernstorff and the
German foreign office.
One of Bernstorff's messages urg
ed that special favor be shown to
William Bayard Hale, an American
about to visit Berlin as an American
newspaper correspondent, because
he was employed by the Hearst or
gans, favorable to the German cause.
Bielaski told the committee that
Hale was on. the Hearst payroll of
$300 a week and also was employed
at $15,000 a year by a 'publicity o.
ganization formed in this country by
Bernard (Dernlbug.
Suggesting on June 2, 1916, that
the time was favorable to "get
Hearst to send a first rate journalist
to Berlin," Bernstorff told the foreign
office that the man selected was Hale,
who had been a confidential agent
of the embassy.
"Hearsj(," the jambassodor's mes
sage said," is not aware that Hale
is our agent, but knows h'm only as
a Germanophile journalist, who has
contributed articles to leading pa
pers." Hale, according to Mr Bielaski,
was paid by the German government
to visit Rumania and if possible pre
vent the entrance of that nation
into the war. Mr. Hearst, Mr. Biel
ask said was ignorant of Hale's
mission. t
Bielaski said Germany never suc
ceeded in seducing an American offi
cial, if "we except Congressman Buch
anan of Illinois who got mixed with
von Rintelen in labor's peace coun
cil." From the diary of Dr. Karl A.
Fuehr, a German agent brought to
America by von Bernstorff, was pro
duced a paper labeled "important list
of names," which Mr. Bielaski said
contained practically all who were
actively pro-German prior to the war
and some wlho were active after
wards. The list included: Dr. Walter S.
McNeill, Richmond. Dr. David Starr
Jordan, Berkley, Cal : ; Peter S. Gross
