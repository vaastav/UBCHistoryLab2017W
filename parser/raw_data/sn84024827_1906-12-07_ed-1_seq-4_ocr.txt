T In,,Blsbee and Arizona In general the
fr following editorial from thfr'Washing-
,ton Post will be of interest, especially
so as it is so difficult to secure past
office employes at the poor price paid
for the work by Uncle Sam: "

the treasury is stuffed full, the salary

A STRICKEN CITY. ,
The flood waters of the San Fran'
Cisco river and Chase creek have
again caused gerat loss of life and
property at Clifton, the Graham coun
ty mining camp. During tho last two
years this city has been four times
visited by damaging floods which
caused the loss of life. The flood of
the present week Is described as the
most harrowing and devastating of
any in the past.
Full details' of the disaster could not
le obtained yesterday because of the
destruction of railroads and telegraph
wires. The experience of Clifton with
floods calls to mind the tenacity with
which people will hold oa to danger
ous and threatening localities, re
building on the very same spots where
there possessions have been several
limes destroyed by the elements. It
was the same spirit which caused
the people of Galveston to rebuild
that city larger than ever after its
destruction by a great tidal wave
which causes the people of Clifton to
continue to rebuild their business
houses on the dangerous bankB of the
San Francisco river and on the banks
of Chase creek.
So long as the Arizona Copper oom-
psay maintains its reduction plant 'at
the mouth of Chase creek so lone will
tho property owners in that vicinity
refuse to abandon their business Iocs
tjons, It is a battle for gold and
what the human family will not 'risk
to gain wealth has yet to be discov
ered. V is quite likely that the flood
sufferers at Clifton fwill get busy In
clearing away the debris left as a re
sult of this last horrible flood visita
tion in preparation of building other
and perhaps more substantial and
costly business houses.
It is to be hoped that Clifton 'will
never hv-such another experience
with. tH&flods again, but the nroba
bllitigrf'Tgrjj that such havoc win oc
cur as long as the town remains where
it is.
It would probably-.be a conservative
estimate to" say that the expense to
the Arizona, Copper company catsed
br destructive floods would build, two
suca smeiung piams as lau one now
buried with wrecked houses, "boulders
and drowned human bodies:
It has been suggested" that 'the Clf-
ton flood sufferers may need assist
ance; should this prove to be the case,
the mining camps of the territory, o
predict, will be quick with a liberal
response,. but we think that the Ari
zona .Cojfir company will meet all
cases0T'1nu'Igency which may arise as.
a result of tho flood.
The Sessa
he Message of President Roosevelt
shows that Theodore is still moving
towards the pastures of the democrat
ic party. He has now appropriated
for his policy almost every contention
of the democrats in 1896 and 1900,
which were denounced as anarchy by
republicans during the two campaigns
when Bryan was the democratic can
didate for president.
o
The attempt being made to deprive
Ben Rice of the office of Justice of the
peace in Douglas, to which he was
elected at the November election, will
make effective campaign ammunition
for the democrats when the time for
voting comes around again.
The resalt of the election for mayor
in Los Anples was a victory for the
democratic candidate. The republi-
cam candidate was third in the race.
California is fast moving toward the
democratic column and it now looks
like the Golden state will be recorded
for Bryan in 1908.
