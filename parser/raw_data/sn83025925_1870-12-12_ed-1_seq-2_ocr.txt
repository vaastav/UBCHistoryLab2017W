OUR FARTIES AND PUBLIC MEN'
THE POLITICAL HORIZON.
From the Ar. r. Herald.
Thking the result of the late elections, the
political bearing of the President's message
and the position of parties at the commence
ment of the present session of Congress as a
standpoint for looking at the prospect around
ns, we may form some idea of the f utare.
The political situation whs never more tame,
flat, and devoid of excitement in this coun
try. Never was there such a lack of strong
public men, of leading and powerful minds,
either to arouse popular fervor on questions
already up or to oreate new stirring issues.
It is the name with one party as with the
other. The Democrats and Republicans
alike are without strong leaders or popular
issues.
As President Grant is the head and repre
sentative of the dominant Republican party
and must be the candidate of that party in
1872, bis message may be regarded as a sort
of platform on which the Republicans will
stand. True, some new issues may be raised
between tho present time and 1S72, either
through the course of coming events or by
the party in Congress. Rut we sea none at
present. Well, what are the Republicans
going to make the contest upon ? The mes
sage of the President to Congress is a highly
respectable State document, remarkably con
servative and peaceful, but tame and nega
tive. The negro is used up as a political
hobby. The war issues have been exhausted.
Roth the odium and the expooted bene
fits of reconstructing the South have been
used nearly as far as they could be by both
parties. Reconstruction is virtually finished,
and little more can be made out of i,t. The
negroes as well as the white people" of the
South will henceforth range themselves with
political parties on questions affecting their
material interests. As to financial questions,
neither party has a comprehensive, well do
fined policy. The rapid payment of the debt,
which Mr. Routwell endeavors to make bo
much of, through the burdensome taxes wrun
from the people, cannot make much political
capital for either the Secretary of the Trea
sury personally or the administration. And
as to revenue measures, the Republicans are
divided according to the intorests of the sec
tions of country they represent. It is the
same, in a measure, with the Democrats,
though they are more united than the Repub
licans on such measures.
EgOn questions of foreign policy or our rela
tions with foreign countries neither the
administration party nor the opposition has
any policy to awaken the popular mind. The
Alabama claims, the fishery question, and the
navigation of the St. Lawrence, which the
President has discussed pretty fully in his
message, might bring up a popular issue; but
we rather think General Grant will not force
one, and that the British government is so
intent on maintaining peace with this coun
try that these matters will be smoothed over
or remain in a quiescent state. The Presi
dent's mind seems full of the St. Domingo
annexation scheme, for it is dwelt on at great
length in the message; but there is not
enough in that to make any political capital.
Indeed, the suspicion is generally entertained
that there is a job in the scheme, and that
the President, though not a party to it, is
misled by those having his confidence.
The annexation idea is atways a popular
one with the American people, but in the case
of St. Domijgo they say cui bono? or what
is to come out of it? Tho island is naturally
very rich, as most tropical countries are; but
if there be not the population, or you oannot
get the population there to develop this natu
ral richness, where is the value ? The St.
Domingo question cannot be made a popular
one. It is different with Cuba. That island
has not only as much natural wealth as St,
Domingo, or more, but has all the developed
wealth of a prosperous country most valu
able and large productions, a large popula
tion, extensive commeroe, railroads, tele
graphs, great cities, nplendid ports, and all
the elements of a progressive and civilized
country, besides being almost within gunshot
of the United States. Then there is the
popular sympathy of tho American people
with their neighbors struggling to shake off
the yoke of European despotism ad to
establish republican institutions. This would
be a popular question for the President and
his party; but he chooses to ignore Cuba and
the Cubans.
Neither one party nor the other has any
striking policy on tho questions referred to,
and both are drifting along lazily on the slug
gish stream of used-up political questions.
Sometimes the want of stirring issues is com
pensated for in a measure by the towering
position and influence of groat party states
men or leaders. A sort of hero worship may
sometimes serve party purposes. Look at
the influence General Jackson and Hanry
Clay had over the people. Such men cau in
spire enthusiasm in the masses. Rut at pre
sent the countiy has no such leaders. We
are without great men as well as groat mea
sures. The most prominent figure atnoi"
the group of our leading publio men -is
Genaral Grant. His glorious war reeor.1
gave him that position aud made him Presi
dent. Though he makes a respectable and
safe President, he does not show as much
ability in politics and statesmanship as
in the command of armies. He fails
to initiate a policy that would touch
the popular heart. Yet he stands like a Go
liath above the other prominent men and
Presidential aspirants of the Republican
party. There are Colfax, Sumner, Routwell,
Rutler, and others who aspire to be leaders
and statesmen, and who have their eyes fixed
on the White House; but is there oae of
them that merits this distinction? Colfax is
simply a local, smooth politician, whose
strength lies in a fluent tongue. There is
nothing great about him. Su.nntr is a man
of one idea and a theorist a mere rhetori
cian, and has neither the grasp of mind for a
statesmen nor the qualities for the chief and
leader of a party. Routwell is a respectable
country lawyer and looal politician, who be
came a finance minister by accident, who has
had nothing to do but to haul in the ener
tuous revenue imposed by Congress upon the
people, and who has snon no remarkable
ability either in the Treasury or in the House
of Representatives. Rutler h-ts more talent
and vigor than any of them, but bo is reok
loss, unscrupulous in politiial affairs, aud
would be unreliable, if not dangerous, at the
helm of State. So we might go on to analyze
the character and pretentions of other so
called leaders of the Republican party, and
we should find none equal to the political ne
cessities of the time.
Now, then, with regard to the opposition
or Democratic party, what great measures or
great men do we find in that t Looking over
the whole field we see the withering blight of
the dead past no fresh issues or new life
nothing to arouse publio sentiment. There
has appeared to be lately, and particularly
in the late elections, some returning life to
this once vigorous and powerful party, but
its comparative successes arise from a nega
tive and not a positive pause. The dissatis
faction with the Republican party and its
growing unpopularity helped the Democrats,
and not any positive popularity of their own.
They have not presented any policy or issue
to stir the popular heart, and Beern to
have none to offer. Nor have
they any towering leaders to arouse
the enthusiasm of the people or to organize
and consolidate the party. Governor Hoff
man, who will be, probably, the Presidential
candidate of Tammany, and who is already
nominated in different parts of the country,
is a safe, prudent, conservative and very re
Fpectable man. For negative virtues, if we
may call them so, no man could be more un
exceptionable. Rut what is there in the
character, history or reputation of the Gov
ernor to arouse popular sentiment? Outside
of New York who knows anything about him?
His public career has been confined to this
State, and though he has made a good Gov
ernor, the people of jother States or sections
know little concerning him. Pendleton, of
Ohio, is a brilliant man, but out of the ques
tion. His antecedents and political and
financial theories make him objectionable to
a large number of the people. Hsniricks,
of Indiana, has had a good deal of experience
in Congress, and has proved a solid and safe
publio servant, but there is nothing in him
to awaken the enthusiasm of the people. So
on to the end of the list of Democratic leaders.
With sterility in policy and mediocrity in its
leading men what can the Democratic party
do ? General Grant, then, is the foremost
man, and the Republicans have the best
chance with him of holding power, bnt if by
chance the Democrats should gain the next
Presidential election it will be through the
mistakes and unpopularity of the Republi
cans, and not from any positive merits of
their own. What tho country really wants
are live issues and strong publio men.
THE FISHERIES QUESTION.
From the X. Y, Times.
The Canadian authorities will commit a
grievous blunder if they act upon the sup
position that the fisheries question will for
the time be terminated by the stoppage of
the bonding facilities hitherto enjoyed by
the provinces, or by the exclusion of their
vessels from United States waters. These
are retaliatory measures which the Cana
dians, Bneer at them as they may, will wince
under whenever they are put into operation.
The privilege of transporting goods in bond
through this country may not be essential to
the commercial existence of Ontario, but
without it the merchants of that province
will be at the mercy of their rivals in Quebec.
The Toronto Leader does not magnify the
effect of the measure upon the convenience
and fortunes of its people when it declares
that all their "fortitude" will be required "to
support the (Dominion) Government in the
olicy it may determine to pursue." How
ong colonial obstinacy and bluster can be re
lied upon to withstand a pressure which will
to some extent erush their material interests,
time Mill determine. For the moment, the
Dominion officials assume an air of defiance.
They "have no idea of abandoning their
present line of policy," an Ottawa despatch
informs us. We are" quite prepared to be
lieve that they are foolish enough to cling to
pretensions which the United States repu
diate, and which President Grant avows his
purpose to resist.
It is for this aspect of the question that wo
advise our Canadian neighbors to prepare.
They are at liberty to be friendly or un
friendly in their general treatment of Ameri
can fishermen, and to pursue a generous
policy, or a dog-in-the-manger policy, in re
gard to the navigation of the St. Lawrence.
These are small matters in comparison with
the vital point at stake in the controversy.
Their interpretation of the Convention of
1818, so far as it defines the limit within
which American fishermen shall not pursue
their calling, is an interpretation to which
this country will not submit, Neither Great
Rritain nor the Dominion should delude
itself with the idea that a doctrine invented
by Nova Scotia pettifoggers, long after the
convention had been agreed upon, and by the
application of which the most valuable fishing
grounds are monopolized by the provincials,
ever was or ever will be acquiesced in by tho
United States. Its assertion in 1332 brought
the two countries to the verge of war; its re
assertion in 1870 brings us face to face with
tho same contingency. For some years tho
Reciprocity treaty averted the discussion,
but its real character has undergone no
change in the interval. The provincial
claim, as now asserted, rests altogether
upon the rendering of stipulations which
were not intended, and cannot be allowed,
to convert waters that belong as much to
ourselves as to the provinces into the exclu
sive property of the latter. We reject that
claim as unsound in law, as at variance with
the rights of mankind and of nations, and as
too absurd and unjust to be tolerated. The
time has come when it must be met and dis
posed of forever. No reciprocity treaty is
available to conceal it now. The provinces
must practically abanbou it, or the Govern
ment of this country will be compelled to
vindicate its right, aud protect an important
class of its citizens, who are now sufferers
from provincial injustice and rapacity...
The off ensive legislation of the Domiuion,
to which the President adverts in his mes
sage, all turns upon tae Rritish version of
of the Convention of 1818. The seizures
and foifeilures continually reported are legiti
mate consequences of the provincial preten
sion to the exclusive ownership of the wteri
that are profitable to fishermen. There ha
been a needless offeusiveness in the manner
in which Rritish officials have conducted
themselves. They have seized vessels with
out warning. They have forfeited vessel,
and stores, and cargoes without regard for
equity, and with a sovereign contempt for
rights which this country never relinquished.
Tbey have at length enforced the most
odious provisions of their law, By
seizing a Massachusetts schooner, on tin
pretext, as alleged in Congress, "that she
bad on board too much provisions for a tv
months' fishing voyage." Tho intent of
these proceedings it is not difficult to under
stand. The Dominion Government hoped,
by harassing American fishermen, to exto'.
from this country commercial concessions
that are essentail to the prosperity of the
maritime provinces. The effect has been
exactly opposite. Even those who were ori
ginally friendly to reciprocity refuse to eu
tertain it under circumstances which imply a
recognition of Canada's preposterous claim.
Our people are heartily with the President in
the position he has assumed. They will not
only sustain him in the exercise of the power
which Congress is asked to confer, but they
will require of him a bold assertion of the
American interpretation of right, as oppose I
to tLe iuterpu Ution upheld by the Dominion.
We should bave little hope of a purine set
tlement ef this question if the Dominion
Government were allowed by Great Rritian
to have its own way. Colonial authorities
rely so constantly upon the backing of the
parent State that they sometimes forget to
calculate consequences. With the Rritish
Government the case is different. Its sense
ef responsibility leads it to be oautious, and
we shall not be surprised if Earl Kimberly
rebuke the Ottawa politicians for reviving a
quarrel which England is ill prepared to
meet. Her rulers and people have too many
important matters in hand to waste time or
temper over the provincial claim to fish. It
is, however, the duty of President Grant, in
communicating with the Rritish Government,
to present the issue in its broadest aspect.
Russia objects to the operation of a treaty
concerning whose construction there is no
doubt. The United States owe to themselves
a distinct declaration that they discard as
untenable the Rritish version of the conven
tion respecting the fisheries, and that they
are not willing to tolerate the enforcement
of that version by Dominion officials. We
look to London, not Ottawa, for an answer.
REPUBLICAN CRITICISM OF THE AD
MINISTRATION. From Harper's Weekly.
The free Republican criticisms of the ad
ministration have had one signal effect. They
have demonstrated the hearty hold of the
administration upon the pi blic mind. Not
one of those critics, except the Chicago Tri
Jjiint, is disposed to look for reform beyond
the Republican organization, and none of
them expect it of the Demooratio party.
There are always orators and writers enough
to glorify the situation, and we are therefore
very much obliged to those other observers
Vtho show us what remains to be done. There
are two kinds of travellers: those who prefer
to eit around the camp-fire, and to tell the
brave 6tory of the journey; and those who
look to see how the camp moy be made more
secure, and where to-morrow's path must be.
Roth dispositions are equally observable in
publio affairs; and nobody should be moro
heartily welcomed by a party than the critic,
and even the grumbler. The old king had a
skull laid beside his plate at the banquet. If
the old Democratic parly had encouraged
criticism instead of servility, it would have
been much wiser, aud of a much longer life.
It is a great mistake to try to imitate the
Democratic method in tho Republican orga
nization. There are a thousand reasons why
it could not be done. There is one all-sufficient
reason why it should not be done. It
would destroy the party.
Since the election, which has shown, despite
every degree of jealousy, discontent, and se
rious diff erence, that the Republican ascend
ency is virtually unshaken, two things be
come clearer. First, a general Jeeling that
the President will be renominated by the
party; and second, that harmony upon "every
essential point is not impracticable. Entire
harmony there cannot, of course, be. We,
for instance, who advocate a civil service re
form do not expect that Congress will at once
pass a law which will wholly satisfy all our
wishes. Rut we do expect to see the senti
ment of the party more and more definitely
declared for that reform, and we certainly
do not expect it from any other pos
sible party. So the protectionists and
the free-traders, or revenue reformers,
will not expect to have all their
views embodied in the policy of the party;
but each may justly expect a concession from
the other. The World says that free trade
is a motto nailed to the Democratic mast, and
the party will go into the campaign of 1872
with that cry. We cannot, of course, regard
the World as the best authority for the
Democratio policy; but any party which, in
the present condition of the country, de
clares for free trade and direct taxation will
not elect a President in 1872. Undoubtedly
the Democratic party will put into its next
Presidential platform some fine phrases about
free trade. Rut its orators upon the Penn
sylvania stump, for instance, will not enlarge
upon that plank.
We expect that the course of the adminis
tration and of Congress during the winter
will tend to a rapid union of all Republican
differences. We have a right to believe that
the months since the adjournment will
have shown Congress that the country wishes,
first of all, peace at home and abroad; then
financial relief; and; as a security of that and
of the general honesty and economy of ad
ministration, a weakening of the system of
patronage which now holds and abuses the
civil service. In the State of New York there
is, and has been for some time, a deplorable
difference in the Republican party. It is in
every way humiliating and harmful. Bat it
cannot be healed until its cause is removed.
And that cause is not a person but a system.
It is patronage which is responsible for the
discord of the party. If the Senators and
Representatives of New York could truly say
with Mr. Mundella that they had not the
slightest personal influence in the appoint
ment of the least officer in the civil service,
and the same were true of local and State
Representatives, the party would be entirely
harmonious; and we might say of any of our
various departments as Mr. Mundalla said
of the Post Office in England, that it was
the most efficient and economical institution
in tho cotintry. Ihe New York difference
can be reconciled if Congress will thus lead
the way.
Financial relief can be, and we have no
doubt will be, found in a policy of reducing
intertal taxation to a few luxuries, and in
adjusting the tariff to a revenue standard,
while the burden of the debt is removed from
this generation. That this is the settled wish
of the country there can be no doubt. Nor
is there any question that a tranquil and
ellicirr.t sissiou devoted to easing the publio
bun'ens, raiher than to Buncombe eloquenoo.
would be most advantageous to the party,
The difficulty with the last session was that
Congress st-emed to have no perception of
the national wishes, and went feeling and
talking along iu a rather resultless way. It
can no longer say that it dot-s not know what
the countiy wisLes. Plainly it wishes Re
publican ascendency, v.ith economical aud
eifici-Lt administration. It expects a tariff,
and it also expects Ihe abolition of the income
tux und the reduction of other taxation to a
very coi'sidersble amount. There are entire
confidence mid tbe most general industrial
activity throughout the country, and we hope
that tha party leaders will speak plainly, not
fearing to rtcomuiend positive measures of
rt folio, and trusting to the general intelli
gence of the people.
The criticism of which we have spoken has
been of undoubted service. Yet the Presi
dent would do the country and the criticising
Republican prei-s injustice if he supposed
that it proceeded from serious distrust of him.
It is long since there has been so pure an
administration as that of General Graut, or
one mere sincerely ai'd unostentatiously do
oted to the publio welfare.
THE FOLLY OF PHILADELPHIA.
t'l urn the X. V. H ut Id.
fcirce tho Cun9rd company withdrew its
bttaujtrs from Boston, that city has boon
vainly disquieting Itself to get them baok,
again. All the seductive arts of which the
Beaton mind was capable, from erotic ogling
to direct solioitati6n, have been brought to
bear upon the obdurate British breast. Bat
the British ear has remained deaf to the voice
of the charmer; and the British breast, ' full
of sad experience," declines to move "slowly"
or otherwise "to the stillness of its rest" in
Boston. "It is found by sad experience
that a city whioh neither received nor issued
any freight, to which no European ever wished
to go, and from whioh the small and rational
minority who wished to get away invariably
fled to New York as a preliminary to future
preregrinations, was not a desirable
city to run a line of steamships to.
Wherefore Boston mourns for her
steamers and refuses to be comforted.
And now it seems that a similar frenzy has
'ruffled the placid bosom of commercial Phila
delphia, and that a "meeting of merchants"
has been held to conjure owners of steam
ships to see their own interests and confer
upon the Old World the unspeakable boon of
a direct communication with Philadelphia.
But we grieve to see that Philadelphia is not
wholly unBfclfish in her desires. She wishes,
it is true, to confer upon strangers to the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and aliens to
tke covenant of Penn" the happiness of
knowing that she exists. But, also and alas,
she yearns to work up her own pig-iron into
monarhs of the main, and to employ her
shipwrights in the constrnotion of vessels
upon a Philadelphian modification of the
Noachian pattern.
But let the Philadelphians pause in their
mad career and consider before they waste
their substance for that which, although it
be oast upon the waters, will protty certainly
not be bread. Let them reflect that steam
ships are sailed not for glory only, but also
for base lucre. The men who manage
steamers, being instigatod thereto by the
devil, manage them partly for their own
sakes, and not exclusively for the sake of
ministering to the mind diseased of envious
towns. As all good Americans when they die
go to Paris, all good Philadelphians when
tbey can come to New York. It is not fit
that they should be plunged from the gloom
of their own sepulchral city to the glorias of
European capitals without the intermediate
and preparatory probation which is afforded
them by this metropolis. It is necessary for
them to buy raiment which bears some simili
tude to the habit of European men, and to
acquire manners which will cause them to be
regarded as members of a civilized commu
nity. No wise capitalist would project for
profit a line of steamersj plying to Memphis
and old Thebes, to the ruins of Bailbeo or
the desert of Palmyra. Much less would any
rational person adventure his substance in
trading to Necropolis and the garden of the
souls. If any man should undertake to start
a line of steamers to a cemotory, it is easy to
predict a speedy separation between that un
wise man and his money. While we commend
the piety of these Philadelphians, therefore,
we are forced to question their perspioacity,
and to counsel them to expend their monoy
in embellishing the Sparta they were born to,
and not to waste it in profane and vaiu at
tempts to establish lines of steamers, or in
otherwise converting their sedate, respecta
ble, but lethargio abode into a carioature of
the activities, the ambitions, and the great
ness of New York. Let them ponder the
proverb w hich assures them that no man is
to be called happy until he is dead. Let
them solace themselves with meditating how
very nearly dead, and thorefore how com
paratively happy, they already are, and how
much more intolerable would be thoir condi
tion if they succeeded in galvanizing them
selves into an illusory and burdensome
vitality.
MEMORIAL CHAPEL TO STONEWALL
JACKSON AT THE VIRGINIA MILI
TARY INSTITUTE.
From the Iliehmoiul Whig.
The design of erecting a memorial chanel
at the Virginia Military Institute, dedicated
to the memory of Stonewall Jackson, has met
the approval of the public, and the able and
indefatigable superintendent, General F. H.
Smith, has commenced the work with charac
teristic energy. The interruption to transpor
tation caused by the flood will necessarily do
lay the completion of the work till the canal
is restored, but, in the meantime, the bricks
have been made and much of the preliminary
work prepared for active operations in the
spring. The structure will be imposing, and,
in addition to the sacred purpose to which it
will be dedicated, will add largely to the
beauty of the Institute buildings. The
foundations will be laid of granite, for which
the Richmond Granite Company have donated
tbe matoriul. This publio-spirited compauy
have, by their liberal aud praiseworthy
action, entitled themselves to the
gratitude and respect of our en
tire population. The company' is composed
of Pennsylvania capitalists, who purchased
granite quarries on the canal, just above
Richmond, in 18G7, and have conducted the
business ever since on a large scale, filling
contracts for the material at St. Louis, New
York, Philadelphia, and other places. Mr.
L. P. Ashmead, one of the company, has
spent much time in Virginia since the enter
prise was put on foot, aud by his excellent
bearing and liberal views has made many
friends for himself and those he represents.
