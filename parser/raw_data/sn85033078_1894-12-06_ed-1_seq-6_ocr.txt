IT WAS HIS FIRST CIGAR.
Buffalo Express: He wore a long
overcoat and a large, drooping chry
santhemum. He was about 17 years
old, and he was drooping more than
the chrysanthemum. A friend younger
looking than himself, helped him on
the car, which was the one that runs
after midnight and is sometimes called
in vulgar parlance, the “bum car.” He
needed the help. If it had not been for
the support of his companion, he would
have been likely to fall in almost any
direction. He sunk into a seat in the
farther corner of the car, after feebly
and pitifully begging his friend to pay
his fare and tell the conductor where
to put him off. He buried his flushed
face in his hand ancl looked miserable.
He felt so.
“He’s pretty full for a starter,” re
marked somebody.
“Shame to see a young fellow like
that in such a condition,” commented
another.
“Mean crowd of fellows he must have
been out with to get him so drunk and
let him go home alone,” suggested a
third.
“Oh. I don’t believe he needs pity.
He probably has gone to w T ork deliber
ately to try to learn to be tough,” said
the severe man down by the stove.
The unfortunate raised his head just
a trifle and. in a voice that was al
most a sob, replied:
“You fellows think I’m drunk, but
I’m not. It was just a cigar-r-. Oh-h
--h!” And with that he subsided again
into silence and misery.

MESSAGE OS MOSEY
PRESIDENT CLEVELAND DIS
CUSSES FISCAL AFFAIRS.
SOME TEMPER SHOWN OVER THE
SUGAR SITUATION.
Advice Given That the Differential in
Favor of the Refiners Be Wiped
Out—Coal and Iron, Says the Presi
dent. Should Be on the Free List —
Other Matters Considered.
Washington. Dec. 4. —The president’s
message was read to congress yester
day and the galleries were full of peo
ple anxious to hear it.
lu opening the executive says: "The
assemblage within the latioa’s legis
lative halls of those charged with the
duty of making laws for the benefit
of a generous and free people im
pressively suggests the exacting obli
gation and iuexonerable responsibility
involved in their task. At the thresh
old of such labor now to be under
taken by the congress of the United
States and in the discharge of the
executive duty enjoined by the consti
tution, I submit this communication
containing a brief statement of the
condition of our national affairs and
recommending such legislation as
seems to be necessary and expedient.”
Regarding foreign relations tbe
president says: “The history of our
recent dealings with other nations and
the peaceful relations with them at
this time additionally demonstrates the
advantage of consistently adhering to
a firm but just foreign policy free
from envious or ambitious national
schemes and characterized by entire
honesty and sincerity.” Continuing
the president reviews various inter
national affairs, saying, apropos of the
Chinese-Japanese war: "Acting under
the stipulation in our treaty with
Corea I felt constrained at the begin
ning of tbe controversy to tender our
good offices to induce an amicable ar
rangement of the initial difficulty, but
tbe unhappy precipitation of actual
hostilities defeated this kindy pur
pose.”
Regarding the prohibition against
the importations of live stock and
fresh meats from this country by the
German government, the president
says: “It is hoped that Germany will
become convinced that the prohi
bition is as needless as it is harm
ful to our mutual interests.”
The president recommends the re
peal of so much of the statute as im
poses a discriminating duty on sugars
coming from countries paying an ex
port bounty, which was protested
against by Germany as a contraven
tion of the treaty with Prussia.
The prompt payment of .$425,000 in
full satisfaction of all claims which
may be made by Great Britain grow
ing out of the controversy as to fur
seals in Behring sea or the seizure of
British vessels is recommended.
Hawaiian affaire are alluded to very
briefly, reference being made to the
matter being “submitted to the judg
ment and wider discretion of con
gress.” Mention is made of the rec
ognition accorded the new govern
ment.
Reviewing the Buefields incidents
the president says: “We cannot chal
lenge the rightful sovereignty of Nica
ragua over this important part of her
domain.”
After reviewing the course of events
in Samoa the president says: “I in
vite an expression of the judgment of
congress on the propriety of steps be
ing taken by this government looking
to its withdrawal from its engage
ments with other powers on some rea
sonable terms not prejudicial to any
of ouh existing rights.”
A BIG DEFICIT.
The secretary of the treasury reports
the receipts of the government, from
' all sources during the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1894, at $372,802,498 and
expenditures at $442,605,758, leaving
a deficit of 869,803,260. There was a
decrease of $15,952,674 in the ordinary
expenses of the government as com
pared with the fiscal year 1893. There
was collected from customs $131,818,-
530 and from internal revenus $147,-
168,449. The balance of the income
for the year, amounting to $93,615,517,
was received from the sales of lands
and other sources. Estimated upon
the basis of our present revenue laws
the receipts of the government during
the current fiscal year ending June 30,
1895, will be $424,427,748 and expendi
tures. $444,427,748, resulting in a def
icit of $20,000,000.
Proceeding the president reviews the
report of the secretary of war and
concurs in that official’s recommenda
tion for an increase in the standing
army. The president suggests to con
gress the temporary revival of the
grade of lieutenant general in behalf
of Major General John M. Schofield.
Reviewing the report of the attorney
general the president suggests that
an additional circuit judge for each
circuit court of appeals would greatly
strenghten those courts and the con
fidence reposed in their adjudications.
In the same connection he urges upon
congress the necessity for immediate
legislation for the reorganization of
the Union Pacific Railroad company.
The president reviews the report of
the postmaster general, calling par
ticular attention to that portion which
stated that a deficiency in the postal
revenues could be obviated at once
if the law regulating rates upon second
class matter be modified.
The president concurs in the recom
mendations of the secretary of the
navy for the construction of additional
battleships and torpedo boats.
Commenting upon Indians the presi
dent says: “I am convinced that the
proper solution of the Indian problem
depends to a large extent upon the
intelligence and honesty of reservation
agents and the interest they have in
their work.”
Coming to the pension matters the
president says: “The bare-faced and
extensive pension frauds exposed un
der the direction of the courageous
and generous veteran, soldier now at
the head of the pension bureau leave
no room for the claims that no expur
gation of our pension rolls was needed
or that continued vigilance and prompt
action were not necessary to the same
end. The accusation that the effort
to detect pension frauds is an evidence
of unfriendliness toward our worthy
veterans and a denial of their claims
to the generosity of the government
suggests an unfortunate indifference
to the commissioner toward any of
fense which has for its motive the se
curing of pensions and indicates a
willingness to be blind to the existence
of mean and treacherous crimes which
prey upon demagogic fears and make
sport of the patriotic impulse of a
grateful people."
Inferring to civil service reform the
president says: *‘The vast majority of
the voters of the land are ready to
insist that the time and attention of
those they select to perform for them
important pubic duties should not be
distracted by dealing out minor offices
ai'.d they are growing to be unanimous
in regarding party organization as
something that should be used in es
tablishing party principles instead of
dictating the distribution of public
places as rewards for partisan activ
ity."
Referring to the strike commission
ers the president says; “The report
of the commissioners has been sub
mitted to me and will be transmitted
to congress with the evidence taken in
the investigation. Their work was
well done and their standing and in
telligence give assurance that the re
port and suggestions they make are
worry of careful consideration/’
IRON, COAL, SUGAR.
“The tariff act passed at the last
session of congress needs important
amendments,” continues the president,
“if it is to be executed effectually and
with certainty. In addition to such
necessary amendments as will change
the rates of duty I am still very de
cidedly in favor of putting coal .and
iron ore upon the free list. So far as
the sugar schedule is concerned I
would be glal under the existing ag
gravations to see every particle of dif
ferential duty in favor of refined sugar
stricken out of our tariff law. If, with
all the favor now accorded the sugar
refining interests in our tariff Jaws, it
still languishes to the extent of clos
ing the refineries and discharging
thousands of workmen it would seem

“With the advent of anew tariff
policy, not only calculated to relieve
tiie consumers of our land in the cost
of their daily life, but to invite a bet
ter development of American thrift
and create for us a closer and more
profitable commercial relation with the
rest of the world, it follows as logical
and imperative necessity that we
should at once remove the chief if not
only obstacle which so long prevented
our participation in the foreign carry
ing rtade of the sea. The ancient pro
vision of our law denying American
registry to ships built abroad and
owned by Americans appears in the
light of present conditions not only to
be a failure for good at every point
but a nearer relic of barbarism than
anything that exists under permission
of a statute of the United States. I
earnestly recommend its prompt re
peal.
FISCAL AFFAIRS.
'•miring the last mouth the gold

lower rate of interest and maturing
within a short period; but, congress
having failed to confer such authority,
resort was necessarily had to the re
sumption act of 1557 and 1 am glad
to say on the sale of bonds the premi
um received operated to reduce the
rate of interest to be paid by the gov
ernment to less than three per cent.
“Nothing could be worse or further
removed from sensible tiuance than
the relations existing between the gov
ernment’s monetary obligations than
gold held for its redemption and the
means of redemption when the gold
fund is impaired even if the claims
upon this fund were confined to the
obligations originally intended and if
the redemption of these obligations
meant the cancellation of those obliga
tions the draft on the fund would be
very small. But these obligations
when received and redeemed in gold
are not cancelled, but reissued and
made to do duty many times by way
of drawing gom from the treasury.
Thus we have had an endless chain in
operation constantly depleting the
treasury’s gold and never a final rest.
The demands that increase our dan
ger also increase the necessity for pro
tecting this reserve against depletion,
and it is most unsatisfactory to know
that the protection now afforded is
only a temporary palliation. It is per
fectly and palpably plain that the only
way under present conditions by
which this reserve when dangerously
depleted can be replenished is through
the issue and sale of bonds of the gov
ernment for gold; and yet congress
has not only thus far declined to au
thorize the issue of bonds best suited to
such a purpose but there seems to be
a disposition in some quarters to deny
both the necessity and the power for
the issue of bonds at all. I cannot for
a moment believe that any of our
citizens are deliberately willing that
their governmert should default in its
pecuniary obligation or its financial
operations should be reduced to a sil
ver basis. At any rate I should not
feel my duty done if I omitted any ef
fort I could make to avert such a ca
lamity. As long therefore as no pro
vision is made for the final redemp
tion or the currency obligations now
used to repeatedly and constantly
draw from the government its gold
and as long as no better authority for
bond issues is allowed than at present
exists such authority will be utilized
whenever and as often as it becomes
necessary to maintain a sufficient goldj
reserve and abundant time to save the|
credit of our country and make good
the financial declaration of our gov
ernment
A NEW FINANCIAL SCHEME.
“The questions relating to our banks
and currency are closely connected
with the subject just referred to and
they also present some unsatisfactory
features. Prominent among them are
a lack of elasticity in our currency
circulation and its frequent concen
tration in financial centers when it is
most needed in other parts of the
country. An absolute divorcement
of the government from business bank
ing is ihe ideal relationship of the
government to the circulation of the
currency. This condition cannot be
immediately reached, but, as a step
in that direction and as a means of
securing a more elastic currency and
ob\ iating other objections to the pres
ent arrangement of bank circulation,
tbe secretary oi the treasury presents
in his report a scheme modifying the
present laws and providing for i lie is
sue of circulating notes by state banks
free from taxation under certain lim
itation. Ihe secretary explains the
plan so plainly and its advantages
developed by him with such remark
able clearness that any effort on my
part to present an argument in its
support would seem superfluous. I
will therefore content myself with an
unqualified endorsement of the secre
tary’s proposed changes in the law
and a brief and imperfect statement
of their prominent features. It pro
j poses to repeal all laws providing for
the deposit of United States bonds as
I security for circulation, permit na
tional banks to issue circulating notes
( not exceeding in amount 75 per cent.
( their paid-up and unimpaired cap-
I ital, provided they deposit with the
government, a guarantee fund in
United States legal tender notes, in
, eluding treasury notes of 1890, a sum
equal in amount to 30 per cent, of the
notes they desire to issue,—this de
posit to be maintained at all times,
but whenever any bank reduces any
part of its circulation a proportional
part of its guarantee funds shall bo
returned to it; to permit the secre
tary of the treasury to prepare and
keep on hand ready for issue in case
of an increase in circulation desired
blank national notes for each bank
having a circulating; and to repeal
the provisions of the present law im
posing limitations and restrictions
upon banks desiring to reduce or in
crease their circulation, thus permit
ting such increase or reduction within
a limit of 75 per cent, of the capital
to be quickly made as emergency
arises. In addition to the guarantee
fund required, it is proposed to pro
vide a safety fund for the immediate
redemption of the circulating notes
of failed banks by imposing a small
tax, say one-half of one per cent, up
on the average circulation of each
bank until the fund amounts Lo live
per cent, of the total circulation out
standing; when a bank fails its guar
antee fund to be paid into this safety
fund and its notes to be redeemed in
the first instant from such safety fund
thus augumented any impairment of
f#ch fund caused thereby to be made
good from the immediately available
cash assets of said bank, and, if these
should be insufficient, such impair
ment to be made good by a pro-rata
assessment among the other banks,
their contributions constituting a first,
lien upon the assets of the failed
bank in favor of the contributing
banks. Asa further security it is
contemplated that the existing pro
vision fixing the individual liability of
stockholders shall be rescinded and a
bank’s indebtedness on account of its
circulating notes to be made a first
lieu on all its assets. For the pur
pose of meeting the expense of print-
I ing notes, official supervision, cancel
lation and other like charges there
shall be paid a tax say of one-half of
one per cent, per annum on the aver
age amount of notes in circulation. It
1 further provided that there shall be
no national bank notes issued in less
denomination than ten dollars, that
each national bank, except in the case
I of a failed bank, shall redeem or re
, tire its notes in the first instance at its
own office or at agencies to be desig-
I nated by it and no fixed reserve need
be maintained on account of deposits.
, Another very important feature of
this plan is the exemption of state
banks from taxation by the United
States in case where it. is shown to
the satisfaction of the secretary of the
treasury and the comptroller of the
currency by banks claiming such ex
emptions that they have not had out
standing their circulating notes ex
ceeding seventy-five per cent, of their
paid up and unimpaired capital; thrt
i their stockholders individually are li
i able for the redemption of their cir
culating notes to the full extent of
I their ownership of stocks; that the
liability of said banks upon their cir
culating notes constitutes under theft
I state law a first lien upon the assets;
that such banks have kept and main-
I tained a guarantee fund in United
i States legal tender notes, including
treasury notes of 1800. equal to thirty
per cent, of their outstanding circulat
ing notes and that such banks have
promptly redeemed their circulating
notes when presented at their prin
cipal or branch offices. It Is quite
likely that this scheme may be use
fully amended in some of its details,
but I am satisfied it furnishes a basis
for a very great improvement in Our
present banking and currency system.
