Natural Gas in Indiana
A representative of the Journal js now
making a tour of the natural-gas district
of this State, collecting facts and figured
showing the effect of the new fuel in the
development of business and manufactur
ing in cities and towns located at the
sources of supply. It is intended to cover
tho entire field, and the effort will be to
treat all with exact fairness. The first of
these letters, which will include a brief
history of tho dif coverjr of gas in Indiana
and tho benefits derived therefrom by
Mnncie and Andorson, will be printed in
tho Journal of Saturday, Dec. 7. Agents
in those two cities and in other towns in
eastern Indiana who desire extra copies of
Saturday's issuo are requested to send in
their orders at once.
It is a message grounded upon the
fundamental principles of the Repub
lican party and mindful of all its pledges.
The people's government must have
no private banks to which to loan money
-without interest, is the declaration of
President Harrison, but not of cx-Presi-1
dent Cleveland.
The President is a genuine tariff re
former that is, it should be reformed in
the interest of American industries and
interests, and not of foreign manufactur
ers and importers. 1
If Congress will respond to the advice
of the President it will enter upon an
era of constructive and progressive leg
islation demanded by the business inter
ests of the country.
And yet the Democratic press will
growl about some things in tho message;
but it will be because they are Demo-
crafft and not Tipnnblimn- It i n na
tional, and, consequently, a Republican
message. -
The comments in Washington on the
President's message are highly com
mendatory. A man may not agree with
the President's views, but he must ac
knowledge that it is an able, dignified,
well-balanced state paper.
It is a notable fact that all of the leul
x iug Democratic and mugwump papers in
tho East, whero Speaker Reed is best
known, speak in the highest terms of
his capacity and integrity, whilo criticis
ing his robust partisanship.
PiiOiuriLY the greatest feat ever ac
complished in telegraphy was performed
yesterday by the Associated Press op
erators in receiving and type-writing
the President's messa'ge. The document
contains fifteen thonsand words, and
was sent from Washington over two
wires. The work was completed, almost
without' an errorin less than four hours.
TnE statement of President Harrison
to tho effect tkat a treaty has been con
chidtnl with Great Britaiu, by which
those who escape to Canada after rob-
bing thos who have entrusted them
with their money, will be received with
satisfaction. A land of safety so near,
us Canada ha3 had a demoralizing in
iluexrco upon weak men, who might
otbcrw ise not have entered upon a course
o2 crime.

The veteran who' has rendered the
country faithful service cannot be per

vate charity, when he is unable, through
disease or old age, to earn his bread", is
the sentiment ' of President Harrison.
Mr. Cleveland took . tho opposite view.
Tiu patriotic people of tho country will
take sides with tho Republican Presi
dent.
There uro no literary or political
pyrotechnics to bo found in President
Harrison's message, andno sentences 6o

When he has anything to say he says it

largo manufacture by the four or five
successful plants in this country, the
price has been reduced nearly 70 per

tended to the show-windows in every

Such is the result of a protective duty
on plate-glass. But tho Boston free
trade organ will never learn this impor
tant fact.
PRESIDENT HAEBISOS'S FIR8T MESSAGE.
iTcsidcnt Harrison's message is worthy
aof the oflice and of tho man. Circum
stances have caused it to be looked for
with unusual anxiety. Political con
siderations and the condition of public
business have combined to this end.
Many questions of unusual importance
are engaging public attention. The
course of party politics for pome time
past has tended to make the forthcom
ing message a point of departure in cur
rent history, and its appearance has
been awaited with a degree of interest
bordering on suspense. The message
itself justifies public expectation as to
its character. It is a complete presen
tation of tho condition of public affairs,
and, while dealing with an unusual
number of important topics, also con
tains an unusual number of important
recommendations.
It has been said the stylo is the man,
an the style of the message reveals tho
character of the President. From be
ginning to end it is clear, dignified,
strong and earnest, showing close study
of public questions and a conscientious
purpose to meet fairly and squarely
every demand of public duty. No fuller
or better presentation of the state of
the country has ever been made than is
conveyed by this first annual message
of President Harrison. It is a complcto
refutation of the, indecent charge that
the entire time of the President has
been devoted to dispensing patronage.
The message will demonstrate to the
people that tho administration of the
government ha9 been confided to a wise
and patriotic head, and will undoubt
edly increase tho esteem in which the
President is held by fair-minded men of
all parties.
As usual, our foreign relations occupy
the first place in the message, though
practically less important than . homo
affairs. They are characterized, says
the President, by good will and cor
diality. He refers, in appropriate terms,
to the pan-American congress, and be
speaks for its action the considerate at
tention of Congress. While recoguizing
the importance of this conference in a
commercial aspect, tho President thinks
its crowning benefit will bo found in the
promotion of international peace, and
the devising of a plan for the settlement
of international controversies by arbi
tration. In calling the attention of Con
gress to the necessity of negotiating a
new treaty for the restriction of Chinese
immigration, the President says that,
while our supreme interests demand the
exclusion of a laboring element which
experience -has shown to be .incompati
ble with our social life, all . steps to com-,
pass this imperative object should be ac
companied with a recognition of the
claim those strangers, now lawfully
among tig, have to humane and just
treatment. This, means that, while
Chinese immigration should bo rigidly
excluded, we should not act like bar
barians towards those already here.
' The most important features in our
foreign relations are the successful con
clusion of the Samoan conference
and the negotiation of a revised extra
dition treaty with Great Britain. Both
of theso are ' important. The former
added greatly to our national prestige
in Europe, and the latter will prevent
Canada from being an asylum for oup
thieves. This last consummation is very
desirable. The negotiation . of this
treat- failed under former nd minis
trations, conspicuously so under the last,
but is now happily brought to a success
ful conclusion. No more important
treaty has beeu negotiated for many
years", and its consummation during tho
infancy of President Harrison's adminis
tration is aii achievement of which ho
and Secretary Blaine may well be proud.
In domestic affairs, tho President
gives first place to the national finances.
Every branch of this subject is treated
with a linn and strong hand, and'with
au evident appreciation of the large in-
tercsts involved. The President recom
mends a reduction of the revenues, as
near as nusy be, to the needs of tho gov
ernment, ile disapproves the loaning
of public 'funds to the banks with
out interest, iu sums larger than tho
business necessities of the government
require. He recommends a revision
of the tariff, botlt iu its administrative
features and in its rate3 or duty, nud
urges that both be done promptly.
While recommending such revision and
the readjustment of duties, he is careful
to urge the maintenance of the protect
ive principle and its application to tho
products of onr. farms as well as of our
shops. The President takes no stock in
the idea of a tariff for revenue only. He
says "these dnties have relations to
other things besides the public revenues.
We cannot limit their effects by fixing
our eyes upon the public treasury alone.
The have a direct relation to home pro
duction, to woik, to wajjes, aud to the
commercial independence of our coun
try, and the wise and patriotic legislator
should enhtrge the field of his vision to
include all of theser While recom
mending a revision of the tariff in ac
cordance with these principles and ideas,
the President .'suggests that it maybe
found advisable to repeal tho tax on to
bacco and that ou alcohol used for man
ufacturing purposes, if necessary to the
reduction of the surplus. In all that ther
President says ou tho tariff he is in har
mony with the best sentiment of the
Republican party and the best interests
of the people.
Tho currency nud silver question,
one of the most interesting and
important now beforo tho coun
try, is presented very clearly. The
idea which prevails to some extent that
tho currency has undergone a contrac
tion in recent years is disposed of by the
statement that since March, 187$, it has
increased.$00a,234,103, making our pres
ent circulation $1,403,018,000.
Tho President avows himself a friend
of silver, aud for that reason he would
protect it from the danger and evils that
may result from excessive coinage. On
the first of November the bullion value
of the silver dollar was 73 cents, and tho
total of that coinage was $343,G3S,001.
The President evidently fears that an
unlimited or excessive coinage of silver
at tho present ratio might result in a
further depreciation and cause gold and
silver to part company permanently. He
urges upon Congress the importance of
securing the commercial equality of the
two coins. Referring to a plan proposed
by the Secretary of the Treasury to issuo
silver certificates upon the deposit of sil
ver bullion at its market value, without
coining it, the President says he has not
been able to give it as careful considera
tion as the importance of the subject re
quires, and he may recur to it at a later
day. Ho evidently realizes tho impor
tance on one hand of providing for the
liberal use of silver in our currency and,
at tho same time.ot guarding against its
dangerous depreciation and the expul
sion of gold from the country. "Such a
result," he says, "would be discreditable
to our financial management and disas
trous to all business interests. We
should not tread dangerously near tho
edge of such a peril."
Tho President, when a member of the
Senate, introduced aud advocated a dis
ability pension bill. He has expressed
the same views since, and repeats them
in his message. He would pension all
old soldiers who are now disabled by
diseaso or accident from earning a live
lihood, whether the disability resulted
from army service or not. In short, tho
President recognizes and urges the duty
of tho goveruiucnt to provide for its
disabled defenders.
A new subject for congressional legis
lation is presented in the recommenda
tion regarding railway employes. The
President makes tho surprising state
ment that during the year ending June
SO, 18S8, over 2,000 railway employes
wero killed in service and moro than
20,000 injured. These deaths and casu
alties resulted mainly from the danger
ous duty of coupling and uncoupling
cars and handling tho brakes. The
President suggests legislation requiring
uniformity in the construction of cars
used in interstate commerce and tho
use of improved safety appliances for
the protection of life and the prevention
of accidents. Ho rightly says: "It is a
reproach to our civilization that any
class of American workmen should, in
the pursuit of a necessary and useful
vocation, be subjected to a. peril of lifo
and limb as great as that of a soldier in
time of war." '
The President's treatment of the civil-service
question is conserva
tive and just. Personally he is
in favor of tho principle of tho
law. Tho Republican party is
committed to it by a series of platform
pledges. The law on the subject is as
binding as any other. Even if the Presi
dent did not approve of tho objects
aimed at, and tho principle of tho law,
it would bo his duty to enforce it. He
says "it will be my pleasure, as well as
my duty, to see that tho law is executed
with firmness and impartiality." Ho
regards its. honest administration and
oservp.uco as essential to the accom
plishment of the reforms aimed at and
to establishing the law in tho confidence
of the people. Speaking as a friend of
civil-service reform, and not as a parti
san, he says, "We should have one view
of tho matter, and hold it with a sincer
tiy that is not affected by the considera
tion that the party to which wo belong
is for tho time "being in power." Tho
President would make merit alone the
condition of appointment in the classified
service, and faithfulness and efficiency
the test of retention and promotion. His
suggestions as to what should character
ize public officers are wise and practical.
Certainly, a public officer ought to com
meud himself to the just judgment and
approval of the public, irrespective of
party. The President recommends tho
appropriations asked for hi the Civil
servico Commission.
The President's treatment of the race
question is firm, dignified and strong.
Ho recognizes the claims of the colored
people to tho protection of tho govern
ment, and tho duty of tho government
to guarantee them their rights as citi
zens. No stronger presentation of their
claims has ever been made, and no more
eloquent tribute paid to their excellent
conduct thau is contained in this part of
the message. Tho great wrong and"
danger involved in a continuance of
present conditions are strongly en
forced, and Congress is urged to adopt
measures which will secure to all citi
zens a free exercise of their civil and
political rights. This question is treated
plainly and squarely, without partisan
feeling, hud in a spirit of justice and
patriotism.
Other features of the message will de
mand attention hereafter notably,
what is said concerning our merchant
marine, the necessity of encouraging
foreign steamship lines, the duty of
suppressing trusts and , combines, of
providing coast defenses, etc. The
message embraces an unusual number
of important subjects, aud recommends
important legislation on nearly all.
A GSATIFYI!?0 SHOTOO.
One of the most hopeful signs is the
largo volume of our exports of mer
chandise. The report for October shows
that the value thereof was 97,CG9,U7,
compared with $74,720.S80 in October,
lbSS. On the other hand, the value of
imports, last October, was $08,127,529,
against W,S."9,522 for the correspond
ing month of 186$, or a balance,- last
October, in our favor, of $29,541.8$3 to
a balauce of $8,300,8(57 for the previous
October. This is a most remarkable show
ing, and one which will go far to relieve
whatever anxiety may exist lest an ad
verse trade balance will draw heavily
upon our stock of gold. But the state
ment for tho three months of the two
years is equally remarkable and encour
aging. During tho three months, from
Julyl to Oct. 3t,.l, the balance of
trade against the United States was
$19,717,437, while for the corresponding
three months of 1861 tho balance was in
our favor to the amount of $10,037,093.
A change in our favor of $33,7So,132, in
the period named, is most gratifying, as
it materially strengthens our monetary
position, and proves that we can pay
for tho foreign merchandise we pur
chase with that we sell.
THE YIEGISIA ELEJTIOH.
Under tho general topic "The New
Method in Voting," General Mahone is
permitted to contribute a page and a
half to the North American Review re
garding the election recently held in
Virginia. After stating the methods
pursued during the canvass, - ho
goes on to show how the frauds
in the election were perpetrated.
He takes Norfolk county, which
iu 1888 gave General Harrison 1,700 ma
jority, but at the late election was
counted Democratic by nearly five hun
dred majority. From the names on the
tally-sheets at each precinct, not count
ing a doubtful vote, General Mahone
makes tho vote of the county 3,4S0 Re
publican and l,78o Democratic, showing
a Republican majority of 1,701. To this
he adds the number of Republican voters
in two precincts where the polls were
closed, and Republicans registered who
wero not permitted to vote, which make
a total Republican majority of 2,231.
Instead of a Republican majority being
returned, a Democratic majority of 490
was reported, which makes an aggre
gate of 2,747 votes stolen by the Demo
crats. General Mahone says' that he
can substantiate the above state
ments by tho voters, themselves.
Ho declares that not only were
all of the election officers Democrats,
but such Democrats as would carry out
the general scheme of robbery, planned
and prescribed by the party managers.
Why this is called "the new method
of voting" is puzzling, when it is
the old regulation Democratic way, ex
tended from South Carolina, Mississippi
and Louisiana to Virginia. General
Mahone seems to have furnished timely
reading, which should lead Congress to
enact a law by which federal officers
shall take entire charge of the election
of Representatives to Congress.
TWO SOUTHERN OPINIONS.
A few days since Senator Butler, of
South Carolina, mado a speech in his
own State, which was full of sectional
bitterness and misrepresentation. In
spite of the fact that he cannot produce
a particle of evidence to sustain his
charge, he declared that there exists in
tho North a powerful clement which
still cherishes resentment because of the
action of the South more than a quarter
of a century ago in trying to destroy tho
Union. On Saturday, Governor Gordon,
of Georgia, ouo of the ablest leaders in
the confederate army, was received by
the city of Chicago with every mark of
respect, and with demonstrations which
are extended only to those who are most
distinguished men. A salute was fired,
and tho leading citizens of both parties
vied with each other in their expressions
of welcome. His speech was applauded
even while it contained views to which
many of his hearers could not subscribe.
It wa3 a good speech, full of broad, na
tional EentiDient, of. the most
kindly and fraternal feeling. On tho
whole, tho reception and tho hearty
welcome accorded Governor Gordon is a
sweeping refutation of the charge of
Senator Butler.
It is very rare that two speeches, by
two men of the sanie'party, and in the
samo section, have been more antagonis
tic in sentiment and spirit. They aro as
wide apart as the poles. One is national
and generous; the other is narrow and
full of hatred. Governor Gordon depre
cates race dissensions, and expresses
the belief that they will' gradually die
out if left to the whites and blacks who
aro put together. Senator Butler ex
presses no such view. He, insists that
the whites must control South Carolina
and the South, regardless of majorities.
In this respect Senator Butler seems
more in accord with tho general senti
ment of the South than is Governor
Gordon. Indeed, there is scarcely a pa
per in the South or a Democratic leader
that does not declare that white suprema
cy must be sustained at all hazards. So
general is this, and so often is it ex
pressed, and so much has been done by
Governor Gordon's party leaders in the
South to make the color line a Chinese
wall, that it is quite remarkable that he
should come to the North and attribute
race dissensions in politics to the news
papers and people outside of the South.
Nevertheless the speech of Governor
Gordon is a good and timely one, and if
he would devote his spare time to deliv
ering it through the South, a great good
would result.
EARLY 7RATHF0LNES3.
For some time the New York Sun has,
been placing the Hon. William L. Scott,
the ambitious Democratic magnate and
a coal millionaire of Pennsylvania, in the
focus of its scorching rays. As the read
ers of the Sun know, the rays of that
paper aro scorching when they are
turned upon a victim in a condensed
form. Mr. Scott has found them so
indeed he has found them unendurable,
.and turns upon the Sun in his own local
organ in a manner more iu wrath than
of judicial coolness. He stigmatizes
the venerable editor Dana as a malig
nant liar, and informs the public that it
is not himself Scottwhom the Sun is
attacking, but, in reality, Mr. Cleveland,
whose champion Scott is. "The Sun,"
Bays the angry Scott, "is the unscrupu
lous tool of a conspiracy to nomiuate D.
15. Hill for the presidency and the aban
donment of tho Democratic policy' on
the tariff." He declares that "there is
not a drop of Democratic blood in Mr.
Dana's body," which, if true, is greatly to
his credit. And here it may be observed
that the D. B. Hill referred to is Gov
ernor Hill, of New York, who has the
Democratic organization in that Stateln
his pocket and the whisk power of tho
State at his back. We submit that a
man who has these two powerful auxil
iaries cannot fairly be referred to as a
conspirator.
Next it appears, according to Mr.
Scott, the tight between Cleveland and
Hill for the Democratic nomination in
i692 is on, and on, too, with a vengeance;
and w ill any one a&k, if thi condition of
inflammatory wrath exists now, what sort
of a cyclone of Democratic indignation
and epithet may we not expect when tho
nomination is a year away? While . wo
should mourn to have anything happen
to either of theso estimable gentlemen,
we are resigned to have them begin to
break up the harmony and continuity
of Democratic housekeeping at this
early period iu the Cleveland-Hill jamboree.
The opposition press is now criticising
tho election of Edward McPherson as
Clerk of the House, on the ground that
he has filled many appointments to of
fice, and is therefore a "political hanger
on." The papers which have the most
to say on this point are the ones that
grumble loudest because Democrats
holding federal positions are not given
life leases of their offices by Republic
ans. All the arguments in favor of re-;
taiuing experienced men in depart
ment service aro applicable in Mcpher
son's case, and more. His familiarity
with tho duties of his place, which
makes him so useful there, could not be
acquired in years by a new man, while a
comprehension of the clerical duties of
most department employes is a matter
of a few weeks. The opposition should
try to be more consistent in argument
and illustration.
The President is fairly entitled to
whatever satisfaction he expresses in
his message regarding the Samoan af
fair. When he became President the
attitude of Germany, as understood by
this country, was so hostile to the posi
tion assumed by our government that
grave complications were feared which
might have resulted in war, but through
the influence of our embassadors and
the able presentation of the case, the
German government promptly, recog
nized jthe soundness of our position and
cordially acceded to it. The result is
alike creditable to tho heds of both
governments, but specially satisfactory
to the administration and its friends.
The virtuous indignation of the Demo
cratic and mugwump papers over As
sistant Postmaster-general Clarksou's
disregard of civil-service reform prin
ciples is highly impressive, and the
figures showing that the sum -total of
removals exceeds the removals of Vilas
and Stevenson in an equal period are
truly heart-rending. With all their in
dignation and their figures, however,
they fail to show that Clarkson is re
moving any Republicans, or to explain
just how and why so many Democrats
got in. Owing to ,this neglect their
wrath and their statistics are less im
pressive and heart-rending than might
otherwise be the case.
Lord Wolseley, Adjutant-general of
the British army, begins his article in
the December North American by stat
ing that tho political leaders demanded
of President Lincoln v the removal of
Grant and Sherman in June, 18G4, and
that Lincoln then made 1 his historic ro
raark, "It is dangerous to swap horses
while crossing a river." My Lord is
wrong; first, there was no demand for
the removal of those officers; and sec
ondly, Mr. Lincoln made .the remark
when speaking of nis renommation for
the presidency.
Mr. Mills, who will be perpetuated in
history in connection with a tariff bill,
lives in Washington, but represents a
Texas district. Mr. Mills is nothing if
not a radical Democrat, and, while he is
ignorant on many, topics, his darkness
regarding Republican policies must be
of the total eclipse quality. Conse
quently, when the North American Re
view permits him to write upon Repub
lican tactics in the House, it seems to
be vying with Bill Nye's paper as a
funny publication.
Railroad employes will be pleased
to find that they have in the President
so faithful an advocate of their inter
ests, v And what is true of railroad em
ployes is equally true of all labor. It is
because the President is a Republican.
That jealous Philadelphia wife who
went down to her husband's office and pub
licly horse-whipped him because he failed
to come home the night before has made a
startling innovation which is hardly likely
to prove successful. As an enticing homo
allurement, the old-fashioned night-gown-and-curl-paner
lecture is just as effective,
and has the further advantage of retaining
all the pleasures of the performance en
tirely within the family circle. y
At one timo Virginia seemed to have a
monopoly upon the men in public- life;
later it was Ohio, and now Indiana men
eecm to be having their turn, springing
into prominence from every quarter of the
Union. The westward march of this pre
ponderance in public life seems to have
kept closely abreast of the changing center
of population. Looked at from almost any
point of view, Indiana seems just now to
be tho hub of the Nation.
Word comes from Russia that 40 per
cent, of the people of St. Petersburg are
suffering from an influenza of distressing
intensity, and that there is a boom in the
handkerchief market. Those who have
dead stock of the bandanna variety of 1SS3
would do well to take note of this fact, and
make an immediate shipment to the do
main of the Czar. .
Tue newspapers, like all other right

MINISTER DOUGLASS SNUDDED.
President lllppoljt Said to nave Refused
to Treat with 111m.
WafthLoffton Special.
Fred Don grass, the well-know leader of
the colored Republicans, at present minis
ter to Hayti, has been snubbed by the Hay
tian government General Hippolyte. the
new President of Hayti, has refused to
treat with Douglass, and Secretary lilaino
is at a loss what to do about the matter,
being unable to send another representa
five of the United States to Port-au-Princa
while Douclass holds the appointment.
Secretary lilain has now called upon Ad
miral Gherardi to help him out of his great
dilemma. Yesterday a large official doen
ment from the Secretary of State was for
warded thronah the Navy Department to
Admiral Gherardi direct. Ihe greatest
secrecy is' maintained regarding the con
tents of this package.
Ex-Minister Thompson, the predecessor
of Minister Douglass, is a Krooklyn mulat
to, and" while he was at Port-au-Prince ho
was not liked by the Haytiaus because he
was a colored man. The llaytiav.s believe
they wero being unfairly dealt with by the
government of the United State?, claiming
that they were entitled to at least as much
consideration from the United States as
any other foreign power. They have al
ways held that tho government of tho
United States showed theni disrespect iu
sending a colored minister to Port-au-Prince,
while ever3 other nation was repre

OHIO HAS HAD HER SHARE.
The President Will Not Take a Supreme
Court Judge from That State.
Washington SpeeiaL
It is expected the President will send in
a Supreme Court nomination very soon.
During the past week a number of promi
nent lawyers from northeastern Ohio, have
been hero urging upon the President tho
appointment of Gen. T. A. Sanderson, c
Youngstown. to the vacancy on tho Su ;
preme Bench. Sanderson is unknown ii
Ohio politics but has an extensive Iav
practice. Senator Sherman was feelectel
to present General Sanderson's name to tho
President, and according to ex-State Sen
ator Wolcott, who was present, the Senator
was somewhat shocked when told by tho
President nhat all Ohio candidates for jus
tice might as well know at once that ho
would not appoint au Ohio man."
Tho President is reported to have said:
"Ohio has had more than her share of rep
resentation on tho Supremo Bench, and it is
time to pass the honors around. In twenty
live years she has had Chief-justices Cha'so
and Vaitet and Justices Swayne and Mat
thews, besides. Judiro Woods was practical
ly an Ohio man, although appointed from
Mississippi, to which Stato ho went after
the war."
Senator Sherman took advantage of tho
interview to mildly intimate that Ohio
was being "left' with this administration
and that there was much feeling about it
among his constituents. President Harrison
did -not agree with this statement. This 1
alleged presidential utterance w js food for
much talk amoug Ohio men.
How to Improve Our Consular Service.
George M. Towle, in North American Jtevlew.
To make tho consular service really efli
cient and valuable to the country, then, it
should be placed within the scope of the
civil-service rules. An examination should
prove the candidate to be generally intelli
gent, endowed with business capacities,
skillful and correct in his Knglish. possess
ing a good knowledge of French and tho
language of the country of his residence,
and endowed with a good character, cood
habits and good manners. Kuicient service
in the consulate should insure not only re
tention in otlice, but promotion iu duo
course. This would remove from the con
sul not only the feeling that it was not
worth while to attend to his duties, einco
his removal was probable at the end of his
term, but the temptation to "make tho
most" of his tenure to long as it existed.
The New Ilallot Law In Massachusetts,

No one would seriously consider tho re
peal of this election law, and a consequent
return to the old election methods. Men of
all shades of political opinion agree that
tho measure has worked well, and that it is
a permanent part of the btatntes of Massa
chusetts. In its details some changes may
be deemed necessary, but in its main prin
ciples it is beyond adverse criticism. It
secures absolute freedom from party dicta-f
tion; it gives opportunity for wise and care
ful choice; it makes every voter directly
responsible to himself for his individual
action. To inaugurate tho working of this
statute has cost a large sum of money, but
the results achieved are well worth all that
lias been expended.
