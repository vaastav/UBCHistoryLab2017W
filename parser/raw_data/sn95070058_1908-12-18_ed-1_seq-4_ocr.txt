President Roosevelt advocates
largo bond issue for permanent public
Improvements to conserve the na
tnral resources of the nation. Mud1
as these improvements are needed (
the conservative element of the coun
try look with apprehension upon ex
cessive bond Issues. Bonds are
draft on the national credit. Vast as
ours is , It is possible to bankrupt out
crodit. Moreover , bond issues carrlec
to excess are likely to produce specu
lation and economic troubles.
It is suggested that if the peopli
who are protesting so vigorous !
against the excessive price demandei
for butter and eggs would slinpl
stop buying them for a short time , tin '
price would be promptly lowered. I
only a fraction of the consumers of
food products In the United State
should refuse to use any article whei
the price Is advanced beyond the cus
ternary level , a glut soon becomes np '
parent and the maintenance of a cor
ner Is impossible. If Americans wen
not slaves to their appetites , the ;
would have no difficulty in breaklni
every "corner" in food products.

A strong piejudlco has existed In
the United States against the Italian
Immigrants , who crowd the large
cities and add so largely to the
throngs of street fakirs. This pre
judice , however , should not extend to
ho Italian agriculturists who settle
n colonies so that they may have the
ampanlonshlp of their own country-
neil while they are becoming Amort-
anlzed. It Is becoming a recognized
act that a locality peopled with

The past year has seen more
ilospotlc rulers humbled and shorn of
- their power than any other similar
era. The czar of Russia waa the first
s
but the establishment of a constitution
and the acceptance of a Dunn In Rus
a sia was only a portent of what was to
take place In other countries. The
Sultan of Turkey was not removed
but put In a glided cage and robbed of
Ills despotic powers. The autocratic
emperor of Germany was humiliated
and compelled by nubile sentiment to
apologize and promise to restrain his
Indiscreet tongue. Think of it the
all powerful kaiser , the mightiest auto
crat over the mightiest army In the
world , apologizing to his people and
making promises of future submission
to their judgment. And now the shah
;
of Persia , has once more promised a
constitution and parliament to his people
ple , but the shah Is a vacillating ruler
and bis promises mean little. Any
S way , it has boon a year of great progress -
gross the world over toward the rule
of the people. The new century Is
making a great record.
In an article In the Independent by
' John Barrett on "Opportunities in
Latin America , " the writer makes the
prediction that before the end of the
century Brazil will bo one of the
greatest sources of food supply In
the world and more than this , that the
republic of South America will be the
home of an active , Industrious race
numbering IfiO.OOO.OOO engaged In a
productive energy equal to that of
the United States today , but with
out the restlessness which is char-
acteristlc of business men in the
United States. It has long been ad
mitted that the only obstacle to great
productiveness In South America was
the hot climate , but that can be over
come more readily than the cold of
the northern climate. The experiences
on the Panama canal prove that tro
pic fevers are a bugaboo of the past.
The natural resources of this great
region are Inexhaustible ; the woods
fruits , vegetables , sugar and tobacco
can find no bettor soil and enough ;
can bo produced hero to supply half
the continent , while the rubber and
cocoa which are two staples to sustain
r Industry and life which the whole
world depends upon. Without rub-
inher ' the wheels of commerce could not
revolve another hour and nine-tenths
, of the pleasure of the world would
innave to be turned from its present ;
channels. Of cocoa the Upper third
r of Brazil also furnishes the greater
part of the world's supply. Sixty
million pounds was the crop of 1907
yet the demand for chocolate and
HIcocoa Is always In excess of the sup
ply. Of the lo.OOO.OOO bags of coffee
which form the visible supply of the
.
world for the i.vesent ; .tar 11,000,000
; bags come from Dni7.ll. Vjtst areas
( of this fertile and productive country
; have never been cultivated. What ,
the ultimate productive capacity of
this country where all kinds of crops
from cotton to wheat can bo raised
! and whore cattle can graze the year
around It Is Impossible to estimate.
18"j Nature has Indeed been lavish with
) - this section. Its mighty rivers with
' great cataracts rivaling Niagara , will
furnish power to turn the wheels of
Industry that will offer employment
and homes for millions of people yet
otn
to come. This section offers opportun-
, Itles for growth and investment nof
capital unexampled elsewhere. For
"
the young man with money which ho
| wants to double quickly It has great
1 attractions. Brazil Is ambitious and
' ' her policy Is progressive and Amorl-
" ! can.

BROWNSVILLE AGAIN.
' The president , anticipating sona-
torlal agitation regarding Brownsville ,
sent a special message to congress
crlvlne the , ronort of a snpijlal Invwrtl-
a demoralizing nature. The con-lwi
the war department. The report gives
the confession of one of the ills-
charged negro soldiers In which ho
admits that he and others distributed
bullets and that a charge wna made
upon the town. The throats of trouble
had reached the soldiers before they
arrived In Brownsville from Fort Nlo-
brara , near Valentine , Nob.
The evidence indicates that the en
tire regiment must have known of the
shooting. The fact that all the sold
iers falsely testified , concealing their
knowledge , makes them guilty to a
certain extent , but the president par
tially excuses their conduct because
be supposes that they wore cowed by
thro'its of the more desperate sold
iers.
The president recommends that
those discharged soldiers who will
tell what they know of the guilty ones ,
bo reinstated , and this recommenda
tion Is likely to find general favor.
The discharged soldiers were form
erly located at Fort Nlobrara. The
war department blundered in ever
sending thorn to the south. Trouble
came between the white residents and
the black soldiers. The shooting up
of Brownsville followed.
There was evidence at the time that
the soldiers did It. There was also
evidence that some of the officers
wore grossly guilty of neglect of duty.
Believing that the soldiers did the
shooting , but unable to force any one
of them to confess the fact , the troops
wore summarily discharged by the
president.
A howl went up , led chiefly by Sena
tor Forakor. There were protests
that the troops ought not to be ills-1
charged until proven guilty , and that
the guilty were made to suffer with
the Innocent. The president now
recommends that any who wore in
nocent be reinstated upon condition
that they tell what they know. This
seems only fair. This makes provi
sion , at all events , for the "innocent. "
In case they are willing to quit their
part of the treasonable withholding
of Information.
NEED GAME LAW CHANGE.
There is an Inconsistent feature of
the Nebraska game law which , in the
Interest of the state at large , ought to
be remedied by the forthcoming ses
sion of the legislature. The open season
son on prairie chickens ought to bo
removed altogether for a term of
years at least , for the sake of saving
that fowl of the plains. And the open
season on quail ought to be Increased. j
As it is at present , the open season
on chickens continues through three :
months ; the open season on quail
lasts but fifteen clays. And this in
face of the fact that the prairie
chicken can and Is being exterminated
by the hunter while the quail can
not be exterminated by the hunter.
In New England the quail has been
hunted for a hundred years and is as
plentiful today as over. The prairie
chicken , wherever hunted , is rapidly
exterminated.
" "
"TIuTquhil can be reduced materially
in numbers only by the hard winters ;
the hunting kills so small a portion
- that it is not noticeable. And yet the
open season is reduced to fifteen clays
presumably in an effort to preserve
that bird.
The prairie chicken , on the other
hand , is not affected by the weather
but can quickly be shot out. And
yet the state allows the prairie chick
en to be shot for three months.
. Th prairie chicken , a picturesque
feature of a prairie state , ought to
, bo preserved and the state ought to
tom
pass a law cutting out the open season
altogether for a number of years. The
quail , on the other hand , which is not
affected by shooting of even throe
aea
months' duration , ought to have a
longer open season in order to allow
- the sportsmen to got out of doors
during this line fall and early winter
01n
weather and legally take aim upon
the llttlo brown meteors.
Some scientists declare that quail
are oven more prolific when hunted
3isince the hunted coveys will spread (
out and mix with other coveys while
, those that are not hunted will stay
together and hatch but few eggs next
season.
MAN'S LIFE PRESERVER.
It has been said that "a man's task
lr his life preserver. " There is no
question that within mat saying there
reo
is wrapt up In this statement a pro.
found truth ami ono that ought tc
abide in the heart and experience of
humanity if civilization is to abide
end make progress.
. Wo pride ourselves in America on
caring for and upholding the rights of
man. It may be true theoretically
but how far we really fall short of 11
Is revealed constantly In the mosl
horrible tragedies. If there Is one
right above another which every man
should enjoy It Is the privilege of
working under conditions of complete
safety. The humblest life and the
humblest labor Is a precious thing lr
the economy of the universe and 1U
protection essential to the welfare ol
tl'f "f .ill.O.
Despite the general appreciation ol
this wo are appalled every little while
by some terrible disaster like that
at the Pennsylvania mines in Marl
anna. The need In these cases EC
Constantly miijtlnuylng Is not emo
tlonal and Intense sympathy which
tlnp with nirrlonll'iirn '
I but n practical and earnest demand |
1 which shall command that more nt- j
11 ! tentlon be paid to safe-guarding liu-
1 man i life when men are engaged 'n '
1 dangerous ' occupations. Accidents
1' \\lll ' occur and tragedies take place
even ( where care Is expressed. It Is
not ' assumed that all emergencies
and i disasters can bo foreseen , but It
Is undoubtedly tine that the percentage -
age of loss of life could bo greatly
cut down If proper care and prccau-
tlon were exercised.
More consideration is being given
to these matters than ever before ,
but we aie still a long , long way from
j 1 the proper appreciation of the value
> f human life. It Is the most sacred
thing on earth. It transcends prop-
IM ty and money , and all else that maybe
bo mentioned. And yet how often Is
It ( sacrificed that some of these petty
gains may be made. It ought not to
be so and It will not bo FO when
America and Its people give the cor
rect estimate to the dignity of labor
and the worth of human life. The
laws and public opinion need to in
sist that the man Is worth more than
the dollar.
A VAST IMPROVEMENT.
People that pessimistically com
plain that the world , and especially
that part of It whose business lies
with politics , Is growing worse rather
than bettor , should contemplate for a
moment the matter of expenditures in
national campaigns. The lists of the
recent stiugglc have been published.
They contain no Items that invite
scandalous dl&cusslon or throw dis
- credit on either party. There Is noth
ing In either to make men ashamed or
to suggest that legislative favors were
bid for. And the largest total ex
penditure , that of the Republican
party , Is a million dollars. Twelve
years ago the amount was carefully
concealed , and the names and
amounts will never be made known ;
but we can be sure that this figure
was multiplied a good many times.
The managers of that campaign , ig
all of them were still alive , would
have assured you that the expendi
ture was justified ; that the country
was threatened by a great clangor ,
that it must be guarded against and
that nothing short of what they did
would suffice. They were perfectly
-
sincere in their belief , and good men
winked at things they knew to be
fundamentally wrong because they
believed them to be necessary. See ,
now , how completely their theory Is
.
disproved how everlastingly true
it is that the end does not justify the
means ; and that , when the means
cannot be justified , the end Is either a
bad one or can be reached as easily
some other way.
Mr. Bryan was a far more danger
ous opponent this year than he was
In 1S9C. He had half a dozen great
chances in his favor that did not exist *
in his first campaign. He was better
known , better liked , less distrusted.
He had ripened. The bitter an
tagonisms of Democrats had softened ,
and he received the support of power
ful men , early among his determined
opponents. He had better Issues ; as
mistaken , but less repugnant to the
, moral sense. Ho had the open sup
port of many labor organizations. If
there was need of precaution against
danger in 1S9C , there was ten times
, the need of it in 1908. Yet against
the enormous expenditure of the for
mer year , we find a million dollars this
year sufficient. Probably one half or
ono quarter of that amount would
have done just as well. The country
is making a vast improvement in get
ting away from the idea that boodle
campaigns are either necessary or
decent.
THE SQUARE DEAL PAYS.
It has boon the courageous note of
the Roosevelt administration that
- has more than all things else commended -
n mended it to the American people and
established Its high place in the history -
tory of the nation.
, , It is a noteworthy fact that It is this
same spirit of fairness and magnanl-
mlty demonstrated in a way and ai a
time when It was not compulsory
nor usual to do it that has given UK-
national government Itself an appre
ciation in the international arena not
accorded to other countries.
It was the right and proper thing
to do when the United states returned
the indemnity exacted of China , after -
- tor the siippreslon of the Boxer out-
burst. But Hils must be remembered
It was a unique thing for a prosperous -
ous and Injured nation to do toward a
despised and submerged empire. But
America has In all her diplomacy had
a profound and genuine sympathy for
, oppressed humanity wherever found
and In this spirit she acted toward
China.
And now , wo have seaii within the
past few weeks a deputation of not-
ubles come half way round the world
to thank Presldcn. Roosevelt personally -
ally , for the American people , in behalf -
half of their own China for the gen
erous and kindly dealing in turning
back the money.
It Is to the everlasting credit of
John Hay that he mphasized the In-
tegrlty of the Chinese empire , at a
time when the greedy governments
rlof Europe wore disposed to divide the
Orient up and each grab as big a
piece as possible to further their own
aggrandizement. This was at a time
have been loud , aa the Interior of hothJJfiL
court. The course of events which
refused to accept the Indemnity -
corded < and led to Its return has been
a bright spot In the record of Mr.
Roosevelf's ' president tnl rriroor and
now as a proper lilting conclusion to
11 thin chain of IncldentH Ellliu B. Root
makes : an International declaration of
friendly f policy toward China which
virtually constitutes us along with
England I and Julian , the diplomatic
protector l of the Mongolian , Kingdom.
There has been a current Idea In
clays ' ) ant among the big nations of
j'
the * oaith as thoio ban been among
the big ccrnblnatlons of capital that
the way to prosper was to tnUo ad
vantage of their .strength and the
weakness of others to obtain every
possible advantage and keep what
they could grab. This was the dipo-
macy of Russia as well as that of Bis-
mtirck and Napoleon.
But times have changed. A new
era has set In. America the joung
and mighty republic In her recent
diplomacy has declared by her ac
tions to the other great powers that
oven giants must and will "tote fair"
and show their greatness not by
brute force , but by their gracious
kindness. In the inarch of history ,
the United States for the first time
in international action is declaring
that Christianity Is a vital energizing
force In a nation's life as well as that
of the Individual. And beat of all , wo
are proving with mathematical preci
sion that "shirt sleeve diplomacy"
which is governed not by craft and
design/ but by open handed , kindly
generous motives is that which most
richly pays. The dividends of Ameri
ca's Investments in these directions
are already bringing heavy returns
Oiorgc Washington pleaded when
the republic was founded for a spirit
cf high-minded friendship with other
nations. Abraham Lincoln with clear
vision , even under great provocation
checked the spirit of bitterness to
ward great European countries and by
the spirit of patience averted a world
tragedy. In these last ten years
America's greatest glory has been
found in her treatment of other weak
er and less fortunate peoples.
Wo assured Cuba of Its Independ
ence and we have kept our word. We
told the Philippines that our rule
would be a benevolent one and It has
been. We started out to deal with
China in a Christian way and the
world knows by this body of diplomats
who have recently traveled so far to
thank us that China appreciates our
motives.
American diplomacy is based on
fair dealing. It has already brought
an increasing spirit of self respect
among us and gained for us thg friend
ship deep and abiding of the islands
of the sea and the great empire of the
orient.
How much Cchlna's regard means
we cannot know. We do know that
"Righteousness exalteth a nation. "
ROOSEVELT GRILLS PULITZER.
Probably never was a message sent
to congress by any president along the
same lines as that submitted Tuesday
noon , and read by the people of This
territory first in The News , in which
Mr. Roosevelt takes to task Joseph
Pulitzer , editor and owner of the- New
York World , in regard to the Panama
canal charges which have been made
from time to time by the World and
other papers buying its syndicate mat
t'T
In a message of some 0,000 , word ? ,
the president gives the complex : his
tory of the transaction in question
and make it pretty clear that the
World , in its charges.was guilty of an '
other blunder.
The message leads off by Informing
the congress of the United States that t
Mr. Pulitzer is a fit candidate for din
Ananias club. Among otlu r bouquets
handed to the World editor is this :
"Itvls idle to say that the known char
acter of Mr. Pulitzer and his news
paper are such that the statements in
that paper will be believed by nobody.
Unfortunately thousands of persons
are ill-informed in this respect and
believe statements they see in print t ,
oven though they appear in a news
paper published by Mr. Pulitzer. "
The charges made by the World
were that an American company had
bought the Panama canal property and
resold It to the United States govern
ment at an enormously Increased fig
lire , with the knowledge and sanctio.i
of the president. This , of court- ,
would bo graft and the charge has so
galled the president that a week ago
ho made public a long letter in which 1
he called the editors who printed the
charges , very , very harsh names. Af
ter that the New York World chal
lenged the president to disprove the
charges by producing evidence In the
matter , and asked congress to investi
gate. That editorial brought forth the
renewed attack from the president.
The president's extreme measure in
the matter will bo justified by the
seriousness which he attaches to the
charge of graft or dishonesty In public
office. For the most part it scorns
doubtful If any serious Importance
.would have been attached to the
' charges in the first place , even If the
president had , as he would have had
a right to do , Ignored the attacks al j.
together. For the people of the United
States very Impllclty believe In the
Integrity of Theodore Roosevelt and l
It is highly questionable whether the
V , Hums. Hanaoinn ; jTnmc
have been able to Indent this faith In
the president , particularly In view of
the t fact that the World has made
many i serious blunders In the past few
' years 3 , Including the false stories re
garding Mrs. Eddy being dead , the
kalser'n Interview , and the like.
But If the president hail any notion
that the World's atorles would bo
believed which ho did have , na ho
tmjs he was Justllled In defending
his- good name even by the extreme
measure which ho adopted.
And the whole countrj will no dou'.it
feel a bit relieved to read thin aKgren-
alve , grilling denial , accompanied HH
It Is by the evidence ) In the eam > .
As for Mr. Pulitzer , while he ban
been given some free advertising , It
has not been of any desirable typo
and there are not many who would
envy tint presidential roasting fiat he
has been given.
Take that , and that , and that , Mr.
Pulitzer and that !
How do you suppose the editor of
the Now York World foil when , as
he sat in his office , hc watched that
Roosevelt message sizzle in over the
\\-ft' '
The president hasn't forgotten how.

IT USED TO BE , BUT NOW.
It used lo be that the country man
Was ragged and lough and brown ,
And ate hlH "grub" fiom a tin pie-pun
And seldom appeared in town :
But now ho journeys to every land ,
And travel-de-luxo is hiH ;
He dresaes as well as the city man
And eats of the best there Is.
It used to be that the "country Jake"
Drove a plodding four-ox team ,
And touched them up with a long
black-snake
Whenever bo wished more steam :
But now ho steps In his automobile
Its motive force to arouse ,
And darts away with band on the
wheel
As fast as the law allows.
It used to bo that the country folk
Never heard what was going on
Except what they read in the weekly
post
Or in letters from Brothdr John :
But now they take the Dally News ,
And magazines galore ,
And every prominent writer's views
Arc delivered right at the door.
It used to bo that the "country gawk"
"Went a visiting" miles away ;
' ( Twas the only way that he had to
talk
With bis neighbors that good old
day :
But now hc stops to the telphono ,
For a few cents a day in bounty ,
And calls up some of the friends he's
known
And talks all over the country.

Ilo says "Just let old Wall street bust ,
For 1 ewe no man a penny ! "

That ho worked from sun to sun ,
While the endless tasks of his patient
wife ,
It was said , wore never done :
But now she has time to peruse a book
Or to take a nap In the shade ,
For the things she
used to sow or
cook
She can now buy ready made.
It used to bo that the country girl
Was bashful , sedate , and prim ,
But now she lives In a social whirl
And dives right into the swim :
She wears the latest from gay Paroo
In bonnet and hlgh-hooled shoe ,
A graceful creature that's fair to sec
In her gown a-Ia-peekaboo.
It used to bo that the cities polled
The honest wish of the voters ,
But now they are herded into the fold
By unscrupulous paid promoters :
Our political life , it is sad to note. > ,
Is the rottenest thing , in creation
If deprived of that sturdy rural vote ,
The supporting staff of the nation.
In spite of these facts of common re
nown.
There are dwellers In every city
Who speak of the people from out of
town
With mingled contempt and pity :
I cannot account for their rank mis
take
But since It Is quite the rule ,

Jake"
Than bo known as a city fool ,
