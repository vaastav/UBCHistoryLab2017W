I OPPOSITION TO FRE tT
SEED DISTRIBUTION
V it
II Matter Will Probably Be
Thrashed Out Again
By Congress
MANY REASONS ADVANCED WHY
I GOVERNMENT SHOULD CEASE
I EXPENDING MONEY FOR THIS
PURPOSE AND DIVERT FUNDS
TO MORE VALUABLE WORK
By William Wolff Smith
Washington Dec 7Whlle it is
not expected that the house of repre
sentatives will devote a week to dis
cussing the question ot whether the
government should continue distrib
uting pumpkin and squash seeds as
It did last session the matter will no
doubt again come before that body
when the agricultural appropriation
bill is considered Last session the
house committee on agriculture which
had considered the matter very care
fully reached the conclusion that as
the government had been distributing
the same varieties of seeds for many
years and that all the seeds sent out
I have been on the market for from ten
I to fifty years and could oe purchased
at any seed store the farmers had
been well educated as to the charac
teristics of those seeds and it was a I
waste of money to spend 242000
annually In distributing such common
varieties of garden seeds
The committee also took cognizance j
of the fact that the seeds were dis
tributed through the mails and entail I
ed a burden on the postofflce depart
ment and also considerable expense I
estimated at from fifty to two hun
dred and fifty thousand dollars per
annum The committee omitted the
Item for seed distribution but it was
reinserted by the house of represen I
tatives by a vote of 153 to 83 after a
debate which raged for nearly a week i
I
One of the strongest objections made I
to the omission of the item was that
the committee had acted without any
one appearing before it to object to
the distribution This was explained
I by the fact that altuough the seed I
dealers had objected to the distribu
I tion for many years they had no inti
mation that the committee would
take action on the subject and there
fore did not appear before it
I When the point was raised It was
of course too late to make represen
tation to the house committee but a
large delegation appeared before the
senate committee and as a result of
that hearing it reported that a distinct
majority was opposed 10 the plan of
free seed distribution and hoped at
this session to be able to make a sat
isfactory change In order that those
opposed to free seeds shall have an
opportunity to present their case to
the house committee on agriculture
that committee has granted them a
hearing on December 12th at which
the entire matter will be very I care
fully gone into The anti free seed
movement has the support of the
National Grange National Farmers
Congress and other national state and
local organizations 01 farmers to
gether with the horticultural socie
ties both state experiment stations
and agricultural colleges
It is unnecessary to remark that
the American Seed Trade Association
the Wholesale Seedsmens League and
all associations interested in the seed
trade are also opposed to this distri
bution The seedsmen take the ground
that this government is the only one
that gives away anything in competi
tion with private enterprise and that
I the only thing given away is the com
monest varieties of cheap garden
seeds and therefore the congression
al free seed distribution is an un
justified interference with a private
legitimate business The farmers pro
test that while this appropriation Is
made ostensibly for their benefit
there are mills of packets that are
burned or otherwise destroyed or are
distributed to merchants bankers
mechanics laborers and others who
can not possiblY have any interest in
them They also maintain that as
they are perfectly familiar with the
varieties of seeds distributed they
can learn nothing from them and as
they are distributed In pennyweight
packages the amount received is too
small to justify the majority of the
farmers In planting them They there
fore contend that this money should be
turned over to the department of ag
riculture for use with the state ex
periment stations In developing new i
rare and valuable seeds and plants of
both domestic and foreign origin
whose adaptability to the locality can
be determined by the experiment
stations Some of them think a part
I of the money can be properly em
ployed In developing superior breeds
of hogs sheep cattle and even horse
If their proposition were adopted the
department would have from five to
ten thousand dollars annually avail
I able for additional work with each of
the experiment stations and this idea I
strongly appeals to the experiment
stations and agricultural colleges As
no one except a few members of con
cress has appeared to defend the dis
tributlon of pumpkin and squash seed
and as the entire agricultural press
and ninety per cent of the daily press
has been attacking this distribution
for years there is reason to hope that
congress will at last do away with it
at the present session
There will be presented to the house
committee a series of interesting ex
hibits One will be approximately one
thousand packages of these seeds
which were rescued from a bon fire
on Long Island last summer They
show the franks of the members of I
congress to whom the seeds were al
lotted and testimony will show that
none of the varieties was less than
ten years old and some had been on
the market for from thirty to fifty
years
Anti free seed resolutions will also
be presented from the National
Grange National Farmers Congress
