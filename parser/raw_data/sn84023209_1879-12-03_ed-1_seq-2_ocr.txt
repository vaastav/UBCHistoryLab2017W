Tho president Ulks very well about civil
service reform. The trouble with that
is th:it while he lias succeeded in giving
the country ii very good business adminis
tration there is no perceptible difference
in tho methods of appointment that he
uses and those used by proceeding admin
istrations. Appointments go as largely by
politics and favor under his as under his
predecessor. Ho makes very good appoint
ments but it is nonsense to talk about there
being any civil service reform in many of
then:, l or instance take the appointment
of Ilarlau lo the supreme bench and of
Secretary MuCrary as circuit judge So

The financial recommendations of the
president and Sccreraty Stitrman are
sound enough in principle but there is an
old and s afe rule of letting well enough
alone, and it may be pretty safely assum

A peculiarly sad death was th.it of Mary
E. Clark, aged 26 of Charlotte, Tuesday.
On the morning of that day (she having
been all tho time in her usual health) she
took the team and went on a visit to her
sister's. In her abscnoe her father, Dea
con Homer Clark, an old and well known
citizen of Charlotte, was stricken with
apoplexy and died almost ini mediately.
On her return in the afternoon Miss Clark
learned of tho sad event, and the shock to
her nervous system was so great that she
was completely prostrated, and survived
but a few hours.

to study life and character, lie must mi
grate to some epiiet country town, where
he can meet the same persons seven days
in every week, and learn a little more
about them than cm be derived from mere
casual observance of outward habits and
peculiarities. Hut most thoroughgoing,
middle-class Londoners would look aghast
at the proposition that very little life cm
bo seen in tho metropolis. To I hem the
whole world worth knowing lies between
Hampstead on the north and Sydenham on
the south; their cast is bounded by Green
wich, and their wust by Richmond cr Ted
dington. Beyond these limits of the
metropolitan universe stretches a vast anil
vague terra iiicO'jnittt, known indefinitely
as " tho country," and held to he cpiite
unworthy of serious attention or philos
ophical consideration by the enlightened
mind. " Life " means the various aspects
of human society within tho narrow
boundaries thus defined ; and to know life
is lobe acquainted with (he city, the West
End, the theatres, the clubs, the morning
papers and the monotonous round of ex-i-tenco
which culminates in mi 8 o'clock
dinner and a nightly crush in somebody's
drawing-room. Even Tbaekeiay himself,
who managed to keep closer than any
other writer within tho four-mile radius
from Charing Cress, could never have
manufactured a readable novel from these
scanty materials.
The one-sided position ol lndon in
the south of England has doubtless done
much to increase the provincialism of its
inhabitants. Very fo v even of the most
educated even remember that the real
heart of Britain, the great central mass of
industrial workers who niako the nation
what it is, lies between the valley of the
Clyde and the Midland plateau of Bir
mingham. This comparative isolation of
the capital has had a double bid result. It
lias mado the northern industrial towns
more provincial, by cutting them off from
the main artery of cultivation anil of po
litical life, while at the same time it has
left London too solitary in the south. The
ordinary Londoner who escapes for a day
from town can only exchange Regent
street lor the King s road at Brighton, or
the Esplanade at Rainsgate. Living in an
essentially artificial centre, a vast eon
-'I'css of the distributing agencies, the
wealthy pleasure seekers, tho legislative
lournalistie and literary classes, he never
irets a clear idea of lbs real industrial
world which lies at the back of his
strangely conventional city. lie passes
his days not unlike the prisoners in l'lato's

of the modes in which the wares were
originally grown or manufactured, and
implicitly believing that all mankind con-

While the Glasgow workman can visit the

Lime in the perpetual embarrassment of a
rock coat and a tall hat. Tho conven
tionality of the season is redeemed Ut tho
West End by a couple of months among
the moors or by the salmon stream; but
tho thoroughgoing Londoner can never
look upon the country except as a certain
lull expanse beyond the town, where you

(insupportable at the end of a fortnight.
In spite of the parti il revivals income
brunches of trade, it is to be feared that
iho coining winter will witness almost as
much general distress as its predecessor.
I'he mffoi ings endured last year are not to
be measured by either the poor law re
in ns or the known number of peoplo who
weie saved from staivation by the eharita-
olo efforts of their neighbors. Beyond
these two classes were vast numbers who
endured privations none the less severe
oir being silent. In Iho hope of better
limes coming with the warm weather,
many temporary sacrifices were mado last
winter; but these cannot be renewed this
year, for the simple reason that, owing to
the dullness of summer trade, the usual
little provisions for the winter could not be
made. It is, unfortunately, only tco cer
tain that, during tho last four months of
what was by courtesy designated as sum
mer weather, the operatives of our great
manufactories and tho artisans of our lead
ing industries have, for the most part, only
been able to lead a kind of hand to mouth
existence. tor the first tune for many
years, industrial depression has been aug
mented by unusual agricultural losses, and
it would be difficult to point to any class,
except the solicitors of the bankrupt court
and liquidators, which docs not feel the
indirect efi'ccts of commercial stagnation.

the congressional session.
A common remark is: " What a splen
did capital we will have in five, ten, or
twenty years." Architectural improve
ments are in constant progress. Millions
have been expended to make smooth and
solid the streets. Barks have been laid
out in every section of tho city. Foro-ts
of trees havo been planted. Colossal
bronze equestrian statutes mount guard in
tho (.quares mid circles. Fountains, flow
ers and foliago contend with the miasma
of surrounding swamps to make this un
fortunate locality an urban paradise. But
the surrounding swamps and physical ge
ography are more potent than congression
al appropriations or tho enterprise of real
estate holders. Wo will havo a splendid
apital when the seat of government shall
be moved to a locality moro favored by
nature, raid this removal will probably
take place much sooner than is anticipated.
The political signihcance of tho next
census will soon no leu in congress, in
five years the questions of solid north
and solid south will have ceased to agitate
and distract the country. The solid west
will loom up, and not even the north and
south solidified can prevent that unsenti
mental section from removing the capital

Soi.Ditiis' Headstones. At tho last
department encampment of the stato of
Vermont, G. A. It., a comniitlco, consist
ing of Gov. Kcd field I'roctor, John A.
Sheldon and James H. Dyer, wero ap
pointed to have in charge the matter ol
erecting headstones at all unmarked
soldiers' graves throughout tho state.
The committee was organized with Gov.
I'roctor, chairman and James II. Dyer,
secretary, and in May last issued to the
selectmen of each town in the state a eir
cnlar calling upon them to report a list of
all unmarked soldiers' L'raves.wiili names
regiment, company and date of death, in
their respective towns. The committee
also caused to be published in all the
newspapers of this stato tbis circular anil
requesting any ono to report to the com
mittee any such gravo within their knowl
edge. Reports from only cne hundred
and twenty-three of the two hundred and
forty towns of the state have been receiv
ed. Sinety-two towns report an aggre
gate of two hundred nnd twenty-live un
marked soldiers' graves. It is believed
that there arc a3 many such graves in tho
other one hundred and twenty towns
from which no reports have been received,
anil it is not creditable to tho patriotism of
the selectmen of thoso towns that they
allow this opportunity to have the govern
ment erect suitable headstones to mark
the last resting plaoe of our dead heroes,
to pass simply from lack of interest to
look tho matter up and report.

jection will Texas make, or any state
whose borders are washed by the Mississ

have the preponderance of wealth and
nniailation in their western sections. Sew
EiP'land, New Jersey, Delaware, Mary
land. Virginia, tho Carolinas, and, possi

that can be i el icil upon for solid opposi

seem at first thought a Titanic task to re

the national, legislative and executive
departments, but the woikwill lie easy

tlie Kratityiiitr fact Hut anion all the disiuirsniK
ollicers of tho pay corin of the navy there is not one I
whn is a deiaulter tu the extent oi a hiiik'ltf dollar. I
unite with him in recommendiiuc the removal of the
observatory to a more hoaltuJul location. That in
Htitutioti reflects credit uiui the nation, and has ob
tained the approbation of scientific men in all parts
of the world. Its removal from its present locality
would not only be conducive to the health of its olli
cers ami professore, but would Kreatly luerea.se US
usefulness.
The appropriation for Judicial expenses, which has
heretofore been made for the department of Justice iu
trross, was subdivided at the last sosmou of couKress,
and no appropriation whatever was made for the pay
ment of the tees of marshattJ und their deputies, either
in the service of process or loilhe dischuiye of other
duties, and since Juno :n it he ho ollicers havo continued
the performance of their duties without compensation
from the irovernnient, taking Ukiu themselves the
necessary incidental outlay s as well as renderiuK their
own services. In only a tew unavoidable instances
has the proper execution of the process of the I'niied
States failed by r en sou of tlie absence of the requisite,
appropriation. This course of otlieial conduct on
tlie part of those ofhoers, hitfhly creditablo to their
thlclit) , . as advii ed by tlie attorm y-Kcueral, who m
lornied them, however, that they would uecessarllly
have to rely tor tlieir compensation upon the prospect
oi future leKlslatiun ot coutrre a. J therefore especi
ally recommend tuat Immediate appropriation be
made by contrress for this purjHise. The act uiakimr
the principal appropriation lor the department of
justice at previous sesmons lias uniformly contained
tin, following clause: " And for defrayitiK tho expeu
sen which may bo incurred iu the euforceiueut of tho
act approved February as, 1870. entitled " Au act fo
amend an act approved May 3u, 1370. entitled au act to
enforce the riuutof citizens ot the t'nlted States to
voto iu the several states ol the United KUtes.aud for
other purposes, orany acts amendatory thereof.or sup
plementary thereto." No appropriation was made for
this purpose for the current yeir. As no treueral
election of meinhers of eonnress occurred, tlm omis
sion was a matter oil little practn al import a uce. Such
election wiil. however, take place dur.mr the ensuiUK
year, and the appropriation made for the pay oi
marshile and deputies should be suIHcieut to embrace
compensation for the Bcrvicea they may bo required
to perform at audi election.

THE INDIAN TKIlIUTOIl Y.
I.utit sprinif information was received of the oriiini-
zatlou ot au extensive movement in the wesp rn states
the object of which was the occui-atiou. by unauthori
zed persons, ot certain lauds in the Indian territory.
ccd"d oy rue i iierom-es to inc irovernm'-nt inr me
oiiroosfiot Botllemont by other Indian tribe. On the
jyth of April I issued a proclamation warniiiL- all per
sons aKamst participaliiin iu such an adi-mpt. and. by
the cooperation of a military lorce, tho invasion was
promptly checked, it is my purpose io protect ine
rights of the Indian inhabitants ot that Territory to
the full extent ol the executive power: but it would be
unwise tu iKiioro the fact that a Territory s i laiye and
so fertile, with a population so sparse and so areata
wealth of unused resourcoH, will be found more ex
posed to the repetition ot such attempts as hin pem d
this year when tin siirrouiidmfr states are mm u dense
ly soltled aud the westward movement of our popula
tion looks still more eaircrly lurtte.-U hinds to
occupy, ruder tmch.eiri'iimstaiiees, the ditl.ciilty ol
niaintaininK the Indian Territory iu its present state
will Kreatly increase, and the Indian tribes inhabiting
it would do well to prepare lor such a contingency I
therelore fully approve of tho advice wiveti to them by
the ifccretary of the interior, on a recent occasion . to
divide aiimuK themselves in sevorality as luro a quan
tity of their lands uh they can cultivate, to at quire
iiuiividnal titles in lee, instead of their present tribal
ownership in common , aud to en: Mder in wh.it man
ner the balance of their lands may In disposed f by
the Koveruinent lor their heitelit. Uy adoptn such a
policy they would morn certainly secure for tnem
selvcs the value of their possessions, and at tlie same
time promote their prokrret-s iu civilization and pros
perity, than by ondeavornitf lo perpetvate he present
state of thiiofs in the Territory. I'he question whether
uchanwe iu the control ot the Indian service i-houid
be made. was in the XLVth coimrcr-s, icterred to a
Joint committee of hoih huuse.i p.r inquiry and re
port. In my last anuiiiil ltiesai-'e. I cxpns(d the Impe
that the decision if that (jiu-htioii then iu prospect.
" would arrest t urt her aif it at ion of tins siiblect. such
agitation beiiiK apt to produce a dist urlmnr ell'eet upon
the service, as well as th" Indians themselves." Mnc
then, the committee bavin reported, the qiicsli.iu has
hoen decided ill the negative by a vote m t:ie li"Uo ot

of the public- ffding tliat ho is "a irrp.it
