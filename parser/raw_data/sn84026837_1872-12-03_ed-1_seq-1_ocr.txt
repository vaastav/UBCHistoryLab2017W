Who shall lbs Democratic Klpclors vote for
has become a question,since the death of Horace
Greeley. The New York Tribunk
suggests
that they vole for Gen. Grant. This would be
misrepreeenling the men who elected them._
But w« presume the Sûtes, which like belawate
failed to choose Democratic Electors, have very
little right to dictate to those in which the Dem
ocratic ticket was succeaaful* We presume it
was this view cf the question which led the
Democratic National Committee to decline to
suggestions a to whom the several
Electoral Colleges should cast their votes f >r.

KEEP COOL.
I
Our leader of last week, we understand, caused
1 , " , , n Radical camp. This we auticipated,
ana therefore ere not at all alarmed. The Wu
mington Republican and Smyrna Times evidently
•ee in ear suggestion tome thing practical, and are
somewhat excited at the idee thrown out that Del
aware Democrat« know how to protect themselves.
Well, gentlemen, wo mean business; hut don't get
uervous We are not in favor of your disfi
cbisement, and will do all we cau to protect you
and all others in every just right. But we do
mean, if our advice can prevail, to stop tho evil
practices and frauds of your party, and to secure
to the white men of Delaware, and the public offi
ce« of the State, just protection from evil disposed
and malignant partisans, who would annoy and
prosecute them uuder Federal laws enacted and
executed for partisan purjioae*. We mean, too,
that a stop shall be put to migratory voting, uud
to take from Radical Othell/s their occupation ol
transferring from one county and one election
K tectnet to auother hordes of negroes who really
ave no abiding place in the State, as party exig
enciai seem to require. Your party has offended
against common decency aud outruged public jus
t oe and individual rights in the late canvass and
ought not to complain of the enactment of just
laws by the Ueneral Assembly to prevent their
repetition hereafter. Nothiug that is wrong uud
will not oomrosud itself to the public approval is
desired by any Democrat. All we want is protec
tion from trauds aud the evil practice* of your
party. This we demand as a right, uud doubt not
we shall obtain by proper legislation. Against the
enactment of such laws your protests are vuin, as
will also the threats of streets blowers, who evince
the spirit of cowards by supposing they can fright
en somebody else. You ought to have protested
as good citizens agaiust tho vile
of
\
d* which
were attempted and pructiaed by your partv in
this State as elsewhere iu the late cauvaos. You
ought to have protested against making the Fe t
erai courts auxilliury to tho design ot your putty
' in intimidatuig elect um officers uud others. Bui
you justified and still excuse all the unholy prac
tices of unscrupulous Radicals aud thereby become
particeps ettminis. Repent in çackplp.th «-d util
es of the evils past, and aid ogr efforts to provide
ft rptnpdv agaplat {he^ repetition hereafter This
i| your bouudeu duty as jourualisls aud goml citi
seus, but if you lack the moral courage to do
right, then we cau only say your ravings will
prove impotent. Keep cool!— Lhlineareun.

San Francisco, Deeemlw 2.—Tbe news
from the neat cd war between United States troofs
and the camp of Madoes show* that the trouble
D much m< re nerioiM than the first report* in
dicated. The Indiana attacked the Tule Lake
seulement, and killed three men* The women,
however, escaped to an adjoining seulement,
being obliged to walk the entire distance, nine
miles. The Governor has heeu called on for
State aid, (lie settler« being short of arms and
ammunition. J, IX Applegaite goes to tie

danger.
Japan.— Another step in the advancement
toward European civilisation lias been taken
by tlia Japanese government. A system of
public schools lias just lieen adopted, aud it
las been decided that the children of the rich
and poor, high and low, shall go to school,
and in order to impress the importance of
teaching the young idea how to shoot upon
the Oriental mind, the Mikado has decided
that the parents must be severely punished if
they neglect to send their children to the new
ly provided educational establishment.
Di uinu the la.t fiscal year the goverment
disposed ut acres of public lands,
a quanity greater by 1,090,270.2a acres than

surveyed 2'J,010,600 acres, winch, added to the
quanity alreay surveyed, amounts to583.3'>4,
780 acres, leaving unsurveyed an area of 1,251,
633,020 acres.
Now that the epizootic is slowly vanishing
upon the Southern limits of the United States,
and its name may possibly return no more to
plague us, some one has the cruelty to invent
and set atloat the story that In Ohio the

and caps the climax of foolishness by calling
the tlssease the "Omniepizootic." Ohiocertain

It was reported in Paris yesterday that Gen
