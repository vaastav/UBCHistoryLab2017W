Dear Sir:
As announced in last week'a "Dia

tailed statement of the difficulty that
took place on the lbtb of Novemlor be
tween Joseph Lawrenco and myself in
the back room of Olson's Wholesale
liquor store at Iron Itiver, hut since
then so much has Uen said and writ
ten on the subject, that 1 feel 'that 1
should not do anything to aid iu the
nourishing of popular bias or preju
dices especially as this matter will
have to come to the court for adjudica
tions. For these, reasons, much to my
dislike, i mnet refrain from making
'certain facts public which will throw
an entirely different light on the entire
matter and which 1 believe entitles
, -aie to tho f allest vindication of my acts
land exoneration of all blame connected
J therewith.
; At the preseut time I am being tried
' by the newspapers, but I do not believe
that this trial will have any other effect
than to excite the minds of friends and
euemies alike and will eerve no good
purpose in the end.
I made a full statement of tho facts
in writing ton person high iu author
ity and I am awaiting his further ac
tion in the premises and for this rea
son will not do anything knowingly
that may in tiny way hamper the

Ashland Changes Hands
The Ashland mine will change hands
today. When the big whistle blows at
midnight the Cleveland-Cliffs lion Co.
will transfer the property to Messrs.
E A. and J. O. Hayes, bolters ot the
original lease, who will contiuue the
operation of tho property. The ne
gotiations for the transfer, which have
been pending for some time, were com
pleted nt Chicago on. Tuesday.
The (Vvoland-ClilTa Iron Co. acquired
a sub -loaso ot the Ashland mine from
the Haves brothers on May 1, ItiOI, and
has operated the property, since that
time. Tho mine has been capably and
intelligently wrought by the C. O. I.
people,' No. 9 shaft having been sunk
iuce they took possession' and many
thousands of dollars spent in drifting,
cross-cutting and drilling to locate new.
ore iKxlies. Most of this exploratory
work has been done on 'the western
limits of the property which contained
the only large area of unexplored
ground.
With the exception ot Supt. John M.
Hush aud Capt. S. J. Perkins, the pre
sent organization will continue in the
service of the Hayes brothers. Supt.
Uusb aud Capt. Perkins were strongly
urged to remain in fheir present posi
tions, but they decided to contiuue in
the service of the C C. I. Co. and will
be transferred to either the Marquette
or Menominee ranges, probably the lat
ter. The C. C. I. Co. has several line
new properties in the Iron River and
Crystal Falls districts, and It would
not be surprising if Mr. IJnsh and
Capt. Perkins are to be sent there.
The going of these gentlemen, who
nave always taken an active interest in
the community, and their excellent
families, will be much regretted. Mr.
Mush has been ft foremost figure in tho
county government for many years,
and every movement looking toward
the advancement of Iron wood or tho
county has had his active and intelli
gent support.
The C. (J. I. Co has pursued a broad
guaged policy in conducting its opera,
tions hero, and it is a matter of sincere
regret that tho company's surrender of
the Ashland mino lease leaves the com
pany without any Interest on the (lo
gebic range. The Hayes brothers will
be welcomed back to Iron wood. They
come, not as strangers, but as old
friends We know they have faith in
the old Ashland, and we hope that
their efforts to locate new ore bodies
will be amply rewarded. Iron wool

Law That Should Pass
Upper peninsula senators and repre
sentative! will endeavor at tho coming
session of the Michigan legislature to
secure the passage of a bill Authorizing .
counties in Michigan to loan their cre
dit to setters by issuing special im
provement bonds for the purpose of se
curing money to defray flu expense of
reclaiming cut-over lands by removing
the stumps, and making the bonds a
special lien upon tho lands improved.
This plan has Uen tried out success
fully in Wisconsin and as a rrsult much
cut over land that hai lieeu reclaimed
and found to laj excellent farming ter
ritory. Senator James of Hancock is
one of tho enthusiastic promoters of the
proposition. The measure to bo intro
duced for Michigan will likely bo iden
tical with that of the Hadger state.
The Wisconsin law reads that when
L'5 or more settlers of any county peti
tion (he county board, petting forth
that they aro the owners of cut-over
land, and it would promote the public
welfare to reclaim this land by clear
ing the stumps, tho county board may
issue county, no less than 4 per cent
per annum, non taxable semi-lnetrest
coupon hinds executed in behalf of the
county, the bonds not to to sold to non
residents until residents of tho conuty
shall have a fair chai ce to purchase
them. These bonds will not evidence
any general couny liability, but shall
lo a special tax lion prior to all other
liens on the lands.
Tho lands will be reclaimed and
cleared of stumps undi-r a contract
mado with the owner, tho contract to
bo approved by the chairman of the
county board of supervisors. Tho spe
cial taxes regarding payment are to la)
treated as any other taxes and when
collected are to te paid into the county
treasury for use in discharging the
bonds as they fall due. The collection
of londs would be enforced by fore
closure in the manner of mortgages on
real estate are foreclosed.
it is the opinion of Senator James
that a bill of this character in Michi
gan would do much in tne way ot re
claiming laudi that have been neglec
ted for years, in some instances havo
never been touched since the virgin
pine was cut during the peninsula's
oary days.
The upper peninsula during the past
three or four yearn has made wonder
ful progress In interesting persons to
take to farming Hundreds ot acres of
cut-over lands have been taken up an
as a result the the public in a fow
years will be able to purchase its pro
ducts from home markets instead of
having them shipped in.
Every county in that territory has a
vaxt area of cut-over lands that contain
s.miH of the best soil in the state, and
if financial aid could bo obtained in
the manner suggested. apparently
worthless wares would soon be con
verted into fiuitf'ul farms. --Michigan
