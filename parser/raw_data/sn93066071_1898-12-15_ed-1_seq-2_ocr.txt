Tho provisions for strengthening the re
sources of the treavury in connection with the
war has given lnrreted confidence In the pur
pose and power of the government to maintain
the present standartl and has established moro
thrmly than ever ths national credit at home
and abroad.
I renew so much of ray recommendation of
December. 1697, as follows: 'That when any
of the United States notes are presented for
rcdtrapt.on In gold such notes shall bs kept
and set apart and only paid out In exih inge for
gold. This Is nn obvious duty If tho holder
of the United States nolo prefers the gold and
gets It from the government, he i-hou'd not
receive back fiom tbo government n Unlt-d
States note without paying gold In exchange for
lL The reason for thU Is made nil the moro
apparent when the government Issues an Issue
bearing debt to p-ovlde cold for the redemp
tion of Un.ted States notes a non-lntcri-st-bearing
debt Surely It should not pay them
out again except on demand and for gold. It
they are put out In nnv other war they mar re
turn again, to be follow -d by nnothcr bond Is
sue to redeem them, another Interesting-bearing
debt to redeem a non-lntcnst bearing debt
This recommendation was made in the belief
thit such provisions of law would Insure to a
greater degree the sarety of the pres-nt stand
ard and belter protect our currency from tho
dangers to which It is subjected from a dts
turbani e In the general business conditions of
the country.
In my Judgment the present condition of the
treasury amply Justin -s the Immediate enact
ment ot the legislation recommen led one year
ago, under which a portion of the gold hold
ings shou'd bo pljced in a trust fund from
which greenbacks should bo redeemed upon
presentation, but when ones relo -msJ should
not thereafter be pall out except for gold.
It Is not to be Inferred that other legislation
relating to our currency Is not required. On
the contrary, there 1 an obvious demand fjr
It. Tne Importance of adequate provision
which will Insure to our future a money stand
ard related as our money standard now and to
that ot our commercial rivals Is generally
recognized.
The companion proposition that our domes
tic paper currency shall be kept safe and yet
be so related to the needs of our Industries and
Internal commerce as to bo adequate and re
sponsive tu such needs Is u proposition scarce
ly less Important. The subject, in all Its parts.
Is commended to the wlso consideration of the
congress.
Investigation of Yellow Ywr. '
In mv last annual message I recommended
that congress authorize the appointment of a
commission for the purpose ot making syste
matic investigations with reference to tho
cause and provocation of yellow fever. This
matter has acquired an increased Importance
as a result of the military occupation ot the
UlnnJ o Cnha nd thn commercial Intercourse
between this Island and the United States
which wo have every reason to expect. Tho
sanitary problems connected with our new re
lations n 1th tho island of Cuba and the acquisi
tion of Porto Itlco are no less Important than
those relating to finance, commerce and
administration.
lncrea.f of thi Army.
Under the act of congress approve! April 26,
1KM. authorizing the president In his discretion,
upon a declaration of war by congress, or a
declaration by congress that war exists. I di
rected the Increase of the regular army to tho
maximum of (U,XX), authorized In s.H act
Thero nre now In tho regular ormy ST.M! offi
cers and men In said act it was provided "that
at mo ena 01 ony war in which thb United
States may become Involved the army shall be
reduced to a poace basis by the transfer In the
same arm of ihe scrvioo or absorption by promo
tion or honorable dlsohargo under such regula
tions as tho secretary of war may establish of su
pernumerary commissioned officers nnd the hon
orable discharge or transfer of su ernumcrary
enlisted men, and nothing contained tn this act
shall be construed as authorizing the perma
nent Increase of the command or enlisted force
of tho regular army beyond that now provided
by the law In force prior to the passage of ibis
act except as to the Increase of i majors pro
vided for In soctlon I hereof."
The Importance of legislation for tho per
manent increase of tho armv is thi-refore maul
Its:, and the recommendation ot tho secretary
of war for that purposo has my unqualllled ap
proval Thero can bo no question that at this
time and probably tor soma time In tho future,
IW.iOJ men will bo none too many to meet the
necessities of the situation. At ull events,
whother that number shall bo required per
manently or not. the power should be given to
the president to enlist that force If, In his dis
cretion It should bi neces ary: and the further
discretion shou.d be given htm to recruit with
in the above limit from tbo Inhabitants of the
stands with the government of which we are
charged.
It Is my purpose to muster out tho entire vol
unteer armv a. soon as the congress sbnll pro
vide for the Increase of the regular establish
ment. This will bs only an act of Justice and
will be much appreciated by tho brave men who
left their homes and employments to help tho
country In Its emergency.

I was riding along the road leading
Across Hurricane gap, in the Tine mountain
range, thinking ot the peculiar people who
lived in these fastnesses, when I was
startled by a voice up the hillside calling
to me to come up and give somebody a lift.
1 had no idea who owned the voice, but
whoever it was was in trouble, and I re
sponded and found a man of CO or more
caught by the foot under a fallen tree and
unable to get away. He wasn't hurt, and
I soon had him on his feet, and he insisted
on my stopping further down the mountain
and taking dinner with him. He lived in a
well-kept cabin with his daughter, and
after dinner we sat in the shade of a tree
in the yard and he told me about himself.
"Air you married?" he asked, after he
told me he was a widower.
"Xo, but I hope to be some day," I an
swered, quite sincerely.
"You ought to be; every man ought to
be: a man that ain't ain't sliowin' a right
feelin' to'rds what the Lord's done fcr him,
thar ain't r.othin' on the face uv God's
green earth that is a patchin' to a woman,
I don't keer what kind she is."
"You're hale and hearty yet," I said,
"and I don't sec why you don't take some
of jour own advice,"
Don't crowd the mourners, mister," he
said, waving his hand as if warding off my
attack. "Don't you crowd the mourners.
I'm figgerin' on sever'l this very minute,

There is a your g lady not far away who
has a little private school and the other day
she overheard the lollowing conversation
tmong her pupils:
It was Monday and one of them had evi
dently been much impressed with her Sun
lay school lesson of the day before, for at
soon as another little girl came in, she as
tounded her by the announcement: "You
are my sister."
"I'm not," said No. 2.
"You are," said Xo. 1, "haven't you got a
Father in Heaven?"
"Yes," grudgingly.
"Well, so have I. Don't that make you my
sister?" '
Xo. 2 was entirely nonplussed at that and
No. 1 correspondingly victorious; so when
mother little girl arrived upon the scene
she thought she would try the same thing on
her, too, and walking up before the new
omer announced as before: "You are my

and stood awaiting the answer with a vic
