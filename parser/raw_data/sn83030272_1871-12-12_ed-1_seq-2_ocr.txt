two ilaskefr of returns. Wu wilect eleven

BBBsj the I'ljngrebi-lonnl elei'tinns n.iw under ro-
il view The returns show that in these
rlcvon Ktf.tcs Qiiant received a majority
over Ht VMiit n of S00,01 vi Us, ami that In
the Con)ressionnl i-onfeHH ol 1H?0 In the
same StntiH the Deinocrnllc rnnilldales re
ceived a majority of M,:ilU vote, mnking
Republican loss in two years of a ).".(? 1 In
those States. These figures are absolutely
correct, and we know of no reason why the
results in theso eleven Slntts may not In
accepted ns a clear demonstration ol pu'die
opinion throughout the fnioli.
Wo now ionic lo the el ctbilis of the
present year, which, In the estimation of
(IiuntV officeholder, have reveri-d the
condemnatory verdict of 1870. This Is nn
error. The dictions of th.s full were not
national, as vteio those of 1870; the policy of
(Iiiant'h Administration was not now so
dtst'nctly In Issue ns it wna then ; nnd more
than all, only nlont half ns innnv States
lmvo voted, while those wbieh have not held
elections we refer to nearly nil the carpet
bag States arc the very ones, wherp On ant
would lmvo Ircen most s.gnnlly robuketl.
The smoke of tho recent contests having
lifted front tho field, wo now see that, rx
cepting In New York and Pennsylvania, the
majorities: of 1871 do not vnry materially
from those of 1870. though the general drift
Is rather ngnltist the I), mocracy. This gene
ral tendency, with tho special results in the
two StutCH named, is due to tho exposure of
tho Tammany frauds. Hut long ere the
Presidential election arrives the Democratic
lmrty will have clcnnsed its skirts of nil taint
of Tammany; nnd If (iint Is In the field
then, even though the Democracy are com
pelled to encounter hint single handed, if
they will present llefnitn CAtiilhlaUs whom
the p'-oplo can trust, the same popular In
dignation which broke up the den of thieves
in Tnmmauy Hnll will spread over the
country and s.-attor to tho winds tho most
selfish, corrupt, mniiny-making, nnd bnso
untional Administration that has liisgrnccd
our history.
Crtuil niui his niinrdinus.
A very singular Mory Is told In fiuno of
tho papers, respecting the recerit round robin
signed by forty-four Senntors and one Vico
Presidcnt beseeching Mr. Klstl to remain in
oflice. It seems that this petition was net
got up because (leu. Oiunt wanted Mr.
I'lstt to stny.but because ho had determined
to appoint Judge PlUUIKPONT in his place
in fact there is no doubt that ho had
o lie red the State Department to Judge
PlHltiiuroNT and tho Senators In quction
were determined to keep him out. Though
they nro nil great partlsms of Oiurn's ro
llout. nation, thoy duliot think ho has discre
tion enough to appoint his own Secretary of
State, and so they resorted to this little in
trigue to deprive him of the oppoitun.ty
The Tri' r thus narrates the story :

The narrative in the Ihrald is less do.

Iowb :

Hut what will the people think of tl.c
Senators and Vice President who signed this
memorial to Mr. Klsll, when they tee them
working like badgers for tin NT's renoinina
tion, nt the same time that by this very
memorial they admit it to be their
opinion that Ohant does not know enough
I to s -led his own Secretary of Statot Will
they not say they lmvo had enough of a
President who needs to bo kept under over
rivers nnd guardl..iist And will they not do-K-rnime
to elect some man In 1872 who is
aide to understand li s duty without impos
ing upon forty five gentlemen in the upper
lluiir-e ol Congress the necetnity of resorting
lo underhand mentis to keep him from doing

docs anybody suppose that (Jen. Ohant
would refuse, or that Ida desire for reelection
would lie any lots keen in 187(1 than in
IH72? Ihaldes, in 1870 his power will be
greatly extended nnd consolidated, his co
lions ol officeholder will have greater con
trol of the people, nnd tho Republican press
gencrnlly will lie more servile than it is now.
His supporters ought not to make two bites

lull testing by lugging m Madame, Cntae.izy who
was, an Simitici assures its, the haiulsoine! wo
man lu Washington. II Sumner knows anything
he knows fcninlo hestilv, and when lie spoke of
the Us la en ty ns that glenous woman, tiie thing
was settled, Then, to osp the climax, tlic Presi
dent of the Pulled Sums. In his annual tnosngc,
snudwlilied Catarazy lielwceti our fmcign tela
ti uis and the llnancinl condition of the country,
giiing 1111 Importance to the subject Ihat fairly
took our breath. And-now tbul tho midwife
Cameron lins brought forth the diplomatic baby,
1 nc child is inch a puny affair that oicrj body is
disappointed, not to say disgusted,
According to the While House alory Cntarszy
was guilty of the offence of sposMng disrespect
fullv of our CtiteT Magistrate. It is suid that he
called our President a hog. This was vary bad in
the liussinu Minister, but he might have pleaded
innocence by samig ihat it "as merely a quota
tion. One of fen. Oram's former associates nnd
friends, .l ines Kik, Jr., and lis p, haling mads

Iv uj.ou nn hoi.'J: and useful oniimil. Tlien
ngoin, tho P.ussisn dip'.oniatic aguat is charged
with using the pres ol llio United States to pro
miil'tate false in- mid Cleats popular prejudice.
This is ths most aenoiis cli.irga of all. One frels
giiclcd lo think that tho press of the boiled
Sutes shculd be t ..iipercd with in till t nefarious
way. TliBptessisugi. it moral engine, mil It
stands ou t' toners of freedom and educates the
people. Ihat figure is a little mlxvd, aud might
proi'ucs insanity if studied too much; but you
know what I mean and that's enough. And lo
have this palladium trilled with by a representa
tive of an effete despotism lilts every true Ameri
can tiuiid with honor. Then again, It is urged
that ibis Catacnzy approached members of Con
gress aud sought to inlluouro tliciu. Here again
we are shocked, but whether ou account of Cata
cszy or the Coiigues.iien we are i.t a loss to do
tetuiinc; lutuUi times in there very dis
tinctly. It is said ihat nl.cn Cutacasy was called to an
acciuut by the Sun tat j of Slutc for these most
damnable tratnaclwns, he would start up In groat
Indignation, and, holding up his right hand, ex
claim : " As a Christian gentleman, .Mr. Secre
tary, I call (lod In witness thai I know nothing
i.bout this business." Then, when tho Stcre
tan would present him with the proof, ths
ccccMir.o diplomat would read the same aud
then burst Into a laugh and add: " Well, Mr.
Sscrstary, 1 belirvu you've irot tne." lloscouied
lortganttlie nhoto atiair t a. gams, and n hen
tairly cornered, considered it magnanimous to
scknonledgc the corn.
Tlie whole affair illustrates the accuracy and
Iruthfult.tss of your journal It will be rcmem
bin d that Tlic Si s long since announced the
fact Ihat th oppowtion.to Catneazy originated in
his uulagoiusiu 10 the Perkins claim and llio Ala
bama Trsaty. This turns out lo bsi the truth,
although frequently denied by the administration
pnpers ; and these facta will appear clearer when
further developments arc made. You will ob
serve Ibst much of the correspondence brought
out by that old lady, Siuion Cameron, is sup
prtised. Simon tays that ho went over the cor
respondence and scratched out all that was
impruH.'r to be published. 1 am prepared to
admit that no man know J better than Siuion what
is improper. Ho 's as good a judge of this as
Sumner is of s glorious woman. Hut at the
aatnc time I would like, for Ihe truth of history,
that the supprcsaed passages were published.
Catacazy says they shall be. And when so pub
lished il will be found that the charge most ofTen
aif e to ths Administration la that the Stat Dt
nartmtnt, Inotcn tu be jlxncroft Vaeii, tccubought
up by the HritUh Goterninmt in aJcanee of thi
nifotia'ioni of the Alabama Trtaty. 1 would
raiher have Catacazy' esidenco on lbt subject,
for with the n cords of the Imperial l.agatlon
befoie him, he knew how Alaska passed from tho
double-beaded cag'c lo the bird of freedom and
(list ia; on golden wing In a word, he knew
how it was himself.
There is greal talk here of on investigation.
Hut whether it will be bad or nut, or If had, whether
11 w II amount to an) tiling, I consider doubtful.
The treaty itself was a sale uf our interests and
honor, and a proof that the consideration could
be found in bribes would be as fatal to Iho lie
publican organization as was the exposure of Tarn
many to the Democratic party.
In consldtring this Catacazy aft'air we mii-.t
recollect wc hare as yet ouly the u parte Hate
ment of tho plaintiff. What may bo the case
when the deli nco is heard is further along. And
wc must alo bear in mind that the usages of
l'.uropean diplomacy are somen bat different fi.im
tlmae governing the Young Men's Christum As
sociation. The word d pluuiscy itself has cnino
to be n synonyme of deceit, or, not lo put Ion lino
a point upon It, downrifht liing. It l coiisldsred
a port of l'uropesu diplomacy lo use all means
within control of tho agent in bring nhout ends
beneficial to tho country be rspresenla. And,
taking the whole tiling together as far oawe'ie
got, I must aay that Mr. Cslaeszy is nu sccmi
dished diplomat.
Then sgslu, lie .oomes from n country soiuc
wlial diffetent in U soeial uud moral condition
from the pure Puritanical atmosphere of Wash
ington. Nobody tells lies in Washington, or de
ceit es any one, or Inks presents in return for
o'lllcUl iiationage, or occepta bribes. And if
any one is so lost tn a proper consideration for
the pure atmosphere of Washington, he or she is
immediately punished. Using without sin, each
man thirefore feels uiitholizcd to tliruw stones,
and habitually carries around whole baskelfula of
boulder, with which lo dornlck ollieial prosti
tutes taken in adultery.
How different it all is in St. Petersburg, and
how indignant, we can imagine, n ill lis Ihegn iii
Oortcliakolf when he leurns of thu Immoral pmc
tlccs fastcued upon his agent by our virtuuis
Proaideut. What (lurtiliukoff is himself I leain
f 1 0111 nu eminent American gentleman who once
visited SI. Petersburg. He was Inrlted lu break
fast by tho great Ihiriipaii diphniut. He found
the table sjiroud in a beautiful apartment of tlie
palace, where the nncarpetod but polished liiur
shone like marble. Whilo tho ciilertaininsnt
was progressing very pleasantly, tho lluasinn
atatestnun suddenly started tn Ids feet, and with
out 11 word of explanation kicked ono of the ser
vants with such violence Unit ho went sliding
half way serosa the room. And then tho Minis
ter resumed his seat, and went on with the
breakfast and the contersation us if nothing had
occurred.
After bicakfast my fiiend ocotnpanied the
Minister tn his apartmriits,iiml III passing thioiigli
an auto-chamber ho aaw a knot of men di eased
In iiinfo'tii. m il il ' h i-o-iun host, 'topping sud
denly, snid 111 Fri 'leu, " I'o you know lliec pto
nlcf" .No," responded my friend. " Well,"
added the host, " they urc spies from t tic Court
who conic hcie to sell me the secrets of the
judges' delibi ratin.i, i.tul when I get itnne with
them they run over nnd sell the name serrcl,
with mine added if thct eun get any, to the parly
on the other side."
How tittle thi-. sounds like Iho purer life of
Washington, and I throw it I 1 tout ire may
judge mure itccuialely of CaiLicazy's iiiuocenco
or guilt. It is well, ton, 11 my that the Oi'.ind
Duke is mining ti, to understand the high life of
l(uin. Hatty of our belles should think of
mm lying Iho (Imml Duke, it is right and proper
that she should known the manners and customs
of the people he is to go among. Think nf a
wedding bicakfast interrupted by (he Oniud
Duke ilslng to kick John Thomas I This would
be uwkwiird if the bride look a John Thomas
wilti her, for with our loose American notions
John might kick back, and in that cusc the har
mony nf the entertainment might be seriously
marred.
Almost every one lier.s who speaks out at all
regmls tho reference to Catacazy by tho Presi
dent ns puerile nnd undignified. As the Irenty
making power with us rials partly in the Senate
there is really no Impropriety in 11 foreign minis
ter nppro.iclilng mombsrs of Congress ; and
when wc come to the facts of the oaso Catenary
was ns much interested, from political cotisiileni
linns, In llus Alabama treaty ns Sir lidnard
Thornton.
Again, in the revelation made by the Slate
Department in this matter wo are called tn ob
serve that the Secretary of Slate gets hold nf his
evidence In, to s.vy tho least, very questionable
nays. How private conversation, telegram, and
bttcrs btcoino the property of Don Hamilton
Pish ivou'd probably bear as close au examina
tion and as much odium as that which rests upon
the ltussiau Minister. The fact is, tlie system of
spies, brought into use by ths late civil war, is
continued here, and used fur political and social
' purposes. Certain officials can and do employ,
at the expense of the (ioyernment, a number of
low creatures lo dog the footsteps, watch Ihe
inurements, steal letters and telegrams, listen
nt keyholes, nnd interview unsuspecting parties
for tbc purKise of fastening au offence upou a
personal enemy. Several iuslances of this sort
hate been given me that 1 propose expounding
in onler that the people, may know the sort of
agents they have Intrusted with public n IT. Irs.
And there is ono case now uuJer way that has
peculiar interest.
It is a dangerous game to play, because it
provokes retaliation, or at least suggests means
ley which tho unseen acts of our public func
tionaries can be traced and made known. It ia
said (hat tlic power possessed hy tlie Hon. Hen
jaiiitn Franklin Holler originates in this practice.
I Hmi't know how true this may be, but I ntn
I. .Id that there is n little manuscript book in ex
istence In which all the movements of a certain
high official arc accurately tracked. My in
firmer tells mc that some of this is very curious
reading, exhibiting traits aud practices in the
high official little dreamed of by the public.
Hut how sickening, mean, and despicable oil
tins is, and towh.it a pass no have oome when
such a system can be tolerated for a moment !

Wabiii.s'oto.v, Dec. C That campaign
document, called tho Presidents message, excites
political comment mainly, from Its barefaced
demagoguery uud devotion to tho single objects
of lirant's renoininatlon. It is the child of many
fathers, nnd none of them conpi-iious fur any
alntiiuit iualit .
The portion of it devoted to foreign affairs,
exhibits a malignity and personal feeling such as
never before disgraced an American "Stato
paper," if this unseemly and muddled document
may bo placed in that category. More than that,
its statements on the llussian matter, are do
hbtrattly false and designed to deceive the coun
try, as to the glaring discourtesy ofiered by the
President, his Secretary of State, and the whole
official tribe to the (Irand Duke Alexis on his
recent brief visit here.
Tho message says, "the hospitable reception
which has been given to the (irand Duke Is n
proof' uf the cordiality of our relations. Tbo
Prince came here and there was not even an
underling to receive him on behalf of the Presi
dent. So gross a breach of politeness and pro
priely was never before perpetrated, and th out
rage, for such it is, is mado more conspicuous
and offensive by the almost official welcome ex
tended to Prince Arthur, who was waited on by
tho Assistant Secretory of Slale, In behalf of
nhat the President calls "the llnrcrnmcnt."
Hut what make tho matter worse, and will
giro It peculiar significance at St. Petersburg, Is
the fact that this visit had been planned for seve
ral years, Mr. Seward had authorized an invita
tion lo be extended lo the (irand Duke Constan
tino to visit the United States. That idea tvns
abandoned, and in May, 1667, (icn. Clay notified
the Department of Stale that the Prince Alexis
would come in bis stead. Tho Kmperor's inten
tion was to send I1I111 that year, but the purpose
was defsrrtd until he attained his majority. In
May last the President was formally notified nf
the intended visit by Ihe Russian Legation, and
1 f course fuller information was recoiled Iruui
our Minister at St. Petersburg.
In presence uf theso facts, of Ihe conduct nf
litissia during tho rebellion, and of tho extraor
dinary reception exteudod tn Mr. Fox's mission,
u ixl subsequently to Admiral Parragut and bis
squadron, (lie (Irand Duko was allowed (0 come
to Washington and lo depart without even being
invited to dine wilh the President, or being mude
the recipient of tbo smallest and most economi
cal civility. Nothing meaner or more discredita
ble has ooeurrcd in our whole history. The
boorish character of the President and his sur
roundings stands out in such contrast with
Unericun hospitality and heartiness, that it
leaves a stigma upon tho national name, never
before disfigured by such low breeding and vul
gar manners.
He M. Catacazy what ho may, ids quarrel w th
Mr. Fish of which muoli is to bo snid that does
not appear in the ofllclal correspoiuleuco ought
to have furnished an incentive fur unusual pains
in tho welcome, of the flrum! Duke, so that the
occasion should not be marred by any omission,
or tho least ubscncu of most perfect cordiality.
And Ibis was Iho more Indispensable, because
ihe President hud agreed that M. Catacazy should
remain as Minister, In onler to present llio Pritico
and attend him on his journey through the
country.
Whatever may lmvo been the ground of com
plaiuta against the Itusiian Minister, or, hurt over
much liu may have departed from tho strict lino
of duty ur diplomatic propriety, ho was still
accredited and accepted 111 the representative of
n most friendly Government, and wiido occupy
ing that relutlon, and especially during thu visit
of Iho Annul Duke, common decency demanded
silence on our part. If Iho Piesldont could nut
be decorous, ho might nt least have clung to the
only qimhiy fur which he claims distinction. ic
might hate kept Ids mouth shut.
What was the courso peraiied Ilefoio tho
presentation of tho Prinoj, it was seiiii-ollieially
nmiouiiccil by telegraph thai M. Cstacaxy would
not be permitted to hold any conversation with
llio 1'iesid.mt. Nn sooner was tho chilling cere
mony over, than it was promulgated that his mi
aioii was ended, and now a nasty correspondence
is i rced befoie tho world by Mr. Fish, without
Iha least neees-ity, unit by means of a call in the
Senate dicl.ilc l by liim-i !f,
While all lhe discredit ible acts nrc aimed nt
the liusel.in Minister, they urc so many insult
offered In the lliisonii Prince, which will be
treasure 1 up, and, like chieknn, may come
home to root hereafter. Mr. Fish dlhon
ors the place which he oi cii . but has never
lillcd, by 11 puciilu limbec and unsightly per
oeut on su-h as ha had nn parallel in nil our
past experience. The fitinkeyisin which he hat
exhibited toward llngtantl in alt hi Policy, nnd
to tlic sliipliug of 11 l'niicc who came hero with
out nny special clai.n lu favor, renders his out
rageous conduct tu Russia ull tho more disgust
ing lo Intelligent nnd cnltlie Americans, with
out regard to pulitlcnl divisions. (Irani, who
