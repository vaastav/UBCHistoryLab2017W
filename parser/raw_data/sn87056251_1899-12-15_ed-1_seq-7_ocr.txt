Track Tank for Freight Knslnc.
The use of track tanks by which lo
comotivcs of high speed passenger
trains may take water without stop
ping is almost universal on the larger
Eastern roads, where fast expresses are
the rule. The B. & O. It. It. has a
number between Washington and Phil
adelphia and intends to equip the en
tire Main Line in the future. This de
cision was recently arrived at through
the uss of passenger locomotives,
equipped with water scoops, ou fast
freight trains. It was found that mucL
time was saved, danger from stopping,
being reduced to a minimum and cost
of running lessened. The extra stops
for water take much time and the wear
and tear on equipment is no small
matter. If the experiment on this part
of the road proves sueeessf.il, track
tanks will be installed on every divi
sion between Baltimore and Chicago.
As a starter, the 5l new Vauclain com
pound engines recently ordered will be
lilted with water scoops.

WEEKLY REVIEW OF TRADE.
Clone of Year Marked by ICucogn;

R. G. Dun &. Co.'s weekly review or
trade says:
"Probably never before have the
productive forces of the country been
so largely covered by contracts at this

not from any mere speculative excite

consumption running far beyond the
producing capacity heretofore, and
pushing it to remarkable expansion.

Sick headaches! Always trace them to a lazy liver or a sick stomach. Poisonous matter, instead cf being
thrown out, is reabsorbed into the blood. When this poison reaches the delicate brain tissue it causes congestion
and that dull, awful, throbbing, sickening pain. CASCARETS remove the cause by stimulating the liver, making
the poison move on and out, and purifying the blood. The effect is almost instantaneous. Ladies, whose sensitive
organisms are especially prone to sick headaches, do not suffer, but find relief in CASCARETS Candy Cathartic.

Stone 1lrenklns
At Ileckingham there is a yard
where tramps, in payment of their
lodging, are set to break granite to
be used in road repairs. Today I had
a try at this granite breaking, and a
poor hand I made of it. I hit hard
and I hit softly. I hit with the grain
and across it. I tried the large and
the small hammer. As a result flakes
of sharp stone flew up and struck me
smartly in the face, but very little
granite did I succeed in breaking. My
companion tried also, and after him
the master, who said that he under
stood the game, but neither of them
did any better. I have come to the
conclusion that even in breaking
stones there must be a hidden art.
