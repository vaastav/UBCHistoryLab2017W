TO THE SUBSCRIBERS OF THE |
.EC IS.
Owing to the nuprecnlently hard
times, and the low price of farm pro
ducts, the price of the .Ft/is has been !
reduced to $1 a year, payably strictly
in advance. j
In making this reduction the pro- (
prietor desires to state that the past 1
high standard of this paper will be 1
maintained, and no expense will be (
spared to keep the JEgi's as it is now— ,
the best newspaper ii Harford county, i
This reduction will only apply to sub
scriptions paid in advance, and sub- (
scribers in arrears can only avail them- c
selves of this reduced rate between 1
now and January 1, 1895.
THE HOME MARKET IDEA. (
The nations of Europe seem very {
much inclined to indulge us in our >
pet idea of a home market, (iermany i
first refused our beef and live cattle j
on the flimsy excuse that the cattle >
were affected with pleuro-pneumonia. i
Jsow she is objecting to our petroleum, j
and the reason they give for this is i
that our best wells have all run out
and the article we are now sending *
them is much inferior to that former- J
ly exported. I
Our people say that both of these ‘
charges are false and that Germany’s >
action is merely because of an un- ,
friendly feeling towards us and a de- j
sire to restrict our trade with that '
country. Very probably this is true, i
The present Emperor of Germany is ,
as narrow-minded as many of our '
great statesmen. If the Germans are .
in a condition to wall themselves in j
(and if they are not, it is no business j
of ours,) they have a perfect right to '
do so. With their limited understand- ,
ing of our political affairs they un- (
doubtedly think that the result of our i
late elections was an overwhelming |
victory for high tariff and restricted j
trade. This may have had some ef
fect on her late unfriendly commer- ]
cial actions towards us, but at any i
rate there does not seem to be any ,
things we can do to remedy it. Eng- 1
laud and France are also doing all iu
their power to assist us iu our pet
theory and they only buy from us
that which they can not possibly do
without.
One of our great statemen said a few '
years ago that the United States was
in a condition to build a Chinese wall i
all around the country, and that we !
would be greatly benefited by doing '
so. China is a good example of the
wall business. She has her great wall
of stone and mortar which is indeed >
of little consequence, but for ages she ,
has had a commercial wall around her
borders, and although of late years ;
some comparative wicket gates have
been opened to restricted commerce, 1
her general situation is one of isola
tion,except where the Japanese armies |
have broken through the outer walls ’
and entered their sacred precincts.— i
China, containing more than four \
hundred millions of inhabitants, has
ever kept apart from all other peoples,
and now we behold her defeated and '
suing for peace to a few islanders j
whose gross population does not >
amount to one tenth of her own.
Let ns have no commercial walls j
around our country but let all the :
seas of the world be one highway |
where our ships can carry away our 1
overproductions, and bring back the
things we need from other countries. ,
Our farmers produce much more than 1
I
we can use without extravagant waste ;
and the output of our manufactories |
is much beyond our home demand. If 1
* \
we import nothing we raise no reve- i
nue to support the government. In j|
that ease the exceedingly nii|>opular j
direct tax would have to come, and \
woe be to the party that would be '
compelled to enforce it. Would it
not, then, be better to drop the fad of
an exclusive home market and buy
and sell with the whole world, laying 1
a duty on imports sufficient for the
support of an ecomomic government, t
which ought to be sufficient in all !
reason to protect our home manufact- '
ories against the lower wages paid c
in other countries ? j
_ * 1
PRICES OP FARM PRODUCTS. t
The December Crop report, of the {
Department of Agiculture, relates t
principally to the average farm prices •
of the various agricultural products f
on the first day of the month. By farm J
prices is meant the price of a product i
on the farm or in the nearest local
1 • 0
market.
The farm prices of corn averaged
45.6 cents per bushel, which is t
9.1 cents higher than the correspond- |
ing price of last year, which was 36.5 u
cents per bushel. This price is 6.3 <j
cents per bushel higher than the aver-
age price for the decade of 1880 to 1889, “
and isjnst 4 cents higher than the
average for the four years 1890 to 1893.
The average price of wheat is 49.8
cents per bushel, the lowest price in J
the past twenty-five years. The price is t;
33.9 cents less than the average for the 1
ten years 1880 to 1889, and is 22.1 cents *
less than the average for the four years j
1890 to 1893. The returns show the ®
average price of hay to be $8.35 per s
ton, while that of last year on the c
farms was $9.18. The average price e
for 1892 was $8.49. The higher price P
last year was caused by the short
crop, both at home and abroad. J
THE ROADS. f
The recent rainy weather has made C
a fine opening for the newlyorganized J;
road leagues to prove their usefulness. “
They can do but little, however, to p
remedy the present condition, as their
work must necessarily be preventa
tive, but the state of our highways
should arouse citizens to the import- e'
ance of the matter and cause them to
add to their efforts to put things in ti
better shape for bad weather the next £
time. They now have a splendid op- ti
portunity, also, to see where piking T
is needed most. Of course, as long as -
earth and water will mix and form
mud we must have our dirt roads in a
more or less bad condition daring the g
■winter season, but much of this can a;
be averted by paying proper attention -
to drainage. The man who devotes c
his time and money to the improve- d
inept of his country's highways is ful- r,
ly as deserving of the gratitude of his „
fellow citizens as he who serves them f ‘
on the battle field.
—A new treaty lias been negotiated
between the United States and Japan
which will apparently be quite ad
vantageous to both countries. It re
cognizes Japan as a first-class power
and concedes that the laws and courts
of Japan are good enough-to try Ameri
can citizens, doing away with the old
consular courts. Japan is also given
the right to make her own tariff laws,
she having heretofore been forbidden
by treaty from flxingduties above 5 per
cent, ad valorem. The United States
is guaranteed freedom of worship and
proper protection for missionaries.—
The greatest concession, however, is
the opening of the entire country of
Japan to American commerce, which
has hertofore been confined to a few
treaty ports. The treaty, to be effec
tive, must be ratified by both coun
tries within the next six months.

Waaliingtou Letter.
From Our Regular Correspondent.
Washington, December 10.—The Demo
crats in Congress have surprised everybody,
including themselves, during the past week.
Instead of the bickerings which were expected
and predicted by Democrats as well us mem
bers of the other parties, they have been quiet
ly at work and have actually succeeded in
mapping out a partial programme of legisla
tion which they expect to pass. They held no
caucus in the House, but are acting upon gen
eral consent of the party in pushing the Fithian
free ship bill and the two appropriation bills—
pensions and fortifications, which have been re
ported. The railroad pooling bill, now before
the House, isn't regarded as a p diticul meas
ure.
The Democrats of the House committee on
Hanking and Currency, who were hopelessly
at sea during the last session, have announced
their intention to report a currency bill before
the holiday recess, and it is an open secret that
It will be very near to the recommendations
made by Secretary Carlisle and endorsed by
President Cleveland's message an extension of
national bank currency and an authorization
of state bank currency under proper safe
guards. This week the committee will grant
hearings to u number ot prominent financiers,
beginning to-day with Secretary Carlisle. The
ideals to get the bill reported before the re
cess so that it can le fully discussed by the
public before the reassembling of Congress.
The Democratic Senators wisely concluded
to ignore what they could not agree upon and
instructed the steering committee to arrange
un order of business to cover the following:
A bankruptcy bill; bills for the admission of
Arizona and New Mexico; Nicaragua Canal
bill, and a bill involving the interests of Indian
Territory, leaving the question of precedence
to the discretion of the steering committee.
These things are very gratifying to the average
Democrat, and if they continue through the
session will put the party in fairly good shape.
It seems almost a pity to point to the ugly
feet of Mr. Peacock llabcoek when he is ex
hibiting such a beautiful tail, embellished in
illuminated colors with the claims of what he
accomplished in the late campaign as Chairman
of the Republican Congressional Committee,
nut the following conversation between two
Republican Congressman is so apt that it must
be recorded‘*l would like to know," said
Keprescntative Hepburn, of lowa, "just what
good the Republican campaign committee did
in the late election. I would like to have some
one name the district in which the committee did
anything." "Well,” replied Representative
Powers,of Vermont, to whom the remarks were
addressed. "It did something in Houk's district
inTt nnessee and in M urray's in South Carolina.
And in both districts the Republican candidates
were beaten." "Just so," said Mr. Hepburn.
"The first time I heard from the committee was
a letter saying the committee could supply me
withcampaign literature and that my check for
a comfortable sura would be acceptable.
The next was a letter after the election
saying that in consideration of a Mr. Mc-
Kee's services as Secretary of the com
mittee, he ought to be elected clerk of
the next House. When the time comes to ap
point another committee I shall recite these
and a few other facts, and move that the com
mittee be abolished." Mr. Habcock has been
throwing stones at the McKinley boom.
Chairman Hatch, of the House Committee on
Agriculture, was oueof the slain, but bis greet
ing to ex-Speaker Reed shows that his wit is
still alive —"Reed, I want to congratulate you,
I have in part represented the Slate of Missouri
in Congress a good many years, and I thought
I knew something about it, but I am ready to
acknowledge that you know more about Mis
souri than I do. 1 read the speech you made in
St. Louis with great disgust. You said the peo
ple of Missouri were good people except that
they didn’t have sense enough to know how to
vote. I'm blessed if you weren't right."
Delegate Rawlins, of Utah, has notified Sec
retary Smith that if the Governor does not re
move the Ute Indians from Utah the people
will drive them out by force. He says he fears
that an Indian war will be the outcoraeof the
present difficulties, owing to the depredations
of the Indians, which, he says, have reached
the unbearable stage.
An equity suit has been begun in the Su
preme Court of the District of Columbia by H.
L. Preston, a Kansas City newspaper proprie
tor, and H. L. Strohm, of Kansas City, against
John Wodderburn, manager of the "Press
Claims Co., of Washington, and W. 11. Hearst, of
the ‘’Examiner bureau of Claims," for the can
cellation of a contract, said to have been ob
tained by misrepresentation, made by Preston
with the Press Claims C 0.," in which Preston
agreed to take stock in that company, upon the
representation that it was valuable, as pay for
advertising. Mr. Preston asked that the com
pany be compelled to pay him SB4O in cash
for the advertising he has done and to take
back its stock which he doesn’t want. C. A. 8.
Catarrh Can’t be Cured
with LOCAL APPLICATIONS, as they cannot
reach the seat of disease. Catarrh is a blood or
constitutional disease, and iu order to cure it
you have to take internal remedies. Hall's
Catarrh Cure Is taken internally, and acts di
rectly ou the blood and mucous surfaces.
Hall's Catarrh Cure is no quack medicine. It
was prescribed by one of the best physicians
in this country for years, and is a regular pre
scription. It is composed of the best tonics
known, combined with the best blood purifiers,
acting directly on the mucous surfaces. The
perfect combination of the two ingredients is
what produces such wonderful results in cur
ing catarrh. Seud for testimonials free.

Mathematical.
Editor of The Mg is :
Is not a right angled triangle also an isos
celes triangle when the two side which con
tain the right angle are equal ? Is not an
isosceles triangle a right angled triangle
when the equal angles at the base are each
angles of forty-five degrees, leaving the angle
at the apex an angle of ninety degrees, or a
right angle? Now if we comprehended Mr.
Henderson’s problem, either a right-angled
isosceles triangle or an isosceles right-angled
triangle answers the conditions. For if a per
pendicular be drawn from the apex to the
base, two partial triangles are formed equal
to each other and similar to the whole trian
gle, for the perpendicular bisects the right
angle, giving in each triangle two angles of
forty-five degress each and a right angle, and
the same division may be made with similar
results ad infinitum. We looked to see G., of
Delta, defend his solution, which was un
doubtedly correut, if we understood Mr. Hen
derson’s problem. Oakland School.

fifty years maturing in 1938. and the rate of
interest on said mortgage debt was reduced

in value, and that it has no business or reve
nues sufficient to pay the operating expenses
* and interest on the debts of said Canal Com

due* in 1918. bearing six per cent, interest
amounting to $1,336 000: also a mortgage due

1 1894, by the Circuit Court for Harford county.
5 sitting in Equity, ordered that the plaintiff, by
causing a copy of this order to be inserted in
two newspapers, once a week, for four con
secutive weeks before the 12th day of January,
r 1895, give notice to the Philadelphia and Read
ing Railroad Company, a non-resident corpora
tion, and to the unknown holders of the Susqu
ehanna Canal Preferred Bonds which matured
on January 1, 1894, and the unknown holders
of the Tide Water Canal Priority Bonds-which
matured on January 1, 1894, non-residents as
. well as residents of this State, of the object and
substance of the said bill, and warning them to
be and appear in this court, in person or by so
licitor, on or before the 30tli any of January,

any they have, why a decree should not pass as
I prayed.

Mr. Edward A. Woods, Manager

Pittsburg , Pa.
Dear Sir: I hereby acknowledge receipt of ■
check from your Company for $8,448.40, in
settlement of ray policy taken twenty years
ago.
lam more than satisfied with the results
shown, us I have not only had protection for
■2O years, but in addition have really made a
Rood investment of my money, as you have re- -
turned to me all the money paid by me. to
gether with 4.3 per cent, interest. Sly total
outlay for the $5,000 policy was $1,503, and
you now return to me $0,448.40, or nearly half
as ranch again as I paid in, and this uotwitb- I
standing the fact that I was not paying the
high price which an Endowment Policy would
cost.
You also offered me a Paid-up Policy for ’
$9,835, or to pay me back 70 per cent, of all
premiums paid, and in addition have my Paid
up Policy lor $5,000, all of which propositions
exceed my expectations. ]
Yours, very truly,
(Signed,)
John L. Kelly.
The above statement shows the settlement
of a twenty payment life policy with twenty
year tontine provisions, written in 1874 and
maturing in 1894, issued by the Equitable Life
Assurance Society, After indemnifying his
family against pepljniary loss, to the extent of j
$5,000 by death for twenty years, the owner
draws in his life time $1,045. mure than pis in
surance cost him, being a return to mm of al)
the money he paid for Ids insurance with Inter- ,
est of nearly 4)4 per cent, per year. 1
No other company can show results as profi
table as above on similar policies covering the
same period of time.
The Equitable issues policies on the life of (
ladies on the plans upon which gentlemen in
sure, and those who desire to provide for those
dependent upon them in the event of death,
and at the same time provide for an income In 1
later life, have an opportunity in a company J
where policies are as safe as a government
bond and much more profitable.

FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
CHRISTMAS !
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
HAPPY CHRISTMAS !
A Trifle, you say, can color a day,
A small bright thing can make us sing.
And the cheeriest ray, along our way,
Is the little act of kindness ;
And the keenest sting, some thoughtless
thing.
| That was done in a moment of blind
ness.
*
Then let us not forget this little trifle. If it
can brighten the face of some little one and
make it sunny with smiles, our hands should
not fail to do this little act of kindness; nor
should we be blind to our duty and thought
less enough to forget any one who is loo : ing to
l us to make this day of all others a happy one.
Who so poor that he cannot once a year re
member those around him with some little
token of affection.
These little gills should not be appreciated
when measured by heartless dollars.
, Then let us Ik; generous, bright and happy,
9 and do what we can to make- the little ones
around us enjoy the “Good Cheer.” Joy is as
contagious as sorrow, and the little child to
whom this holiday is not made overflowingly
happy is the pooivr for all his days.
We are prepared to supply' such gifts for
Christmas as will make old people feel young,
middle-aged people feel happy and young peo
ple feel happier still.
We wish you all a Merry, Happy Christmas.
