Do Not Drink
Is Our Advice
If you can't get along entirely
without it, then our advice is use
the best and purest. It is the
least harmful at least.
We also advise you not to use
tobacco. If you can not get along
without either of these articles then,
our advice is, use the best that can
be had, and under no circumstances
indulge your appetite to excess.
To eat too much is injurious like
wise. Do not eat too much.
Our" wines and liquors, being
pure and wholesome, are very ex
cellent for cooking purposes.
Than our cigars, none are better.

PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE
("lUtiiucd from Third Ptxte
easier for us to (ft'termlne what meth
ods will be beet suited to our own
farmers I hope and believe that the
Committees of the Bennte and house
will address themselves to this matter
with the most fruitful results, and I
believe that the studies and recently
I formed plnns of the department of ag
rlculture may be made to serve them
very greatly In their work of framing
appropriate mid adequate legislation.
It would be indiscreet and presump
j tuous in liny one to dogmatize upon so
great and many sided a question, but
I feel confident that common counsel
will produce the results we must all
desire.
UPHOLDS ANTI-TRUST LAW.
Recommends That It Be BuppJ«ment«d
With More Explicit Legislation to
Facilitate lt« Administration.
Tuni from the farm to the world of
business which centers in the city and
lv the factory, and I think that all
thoughtful observers will agree that
the immediate service we owe the
business communities of the country
is to prevent private monopoly more
effectually than it has yet been pre
vented. I think it will be easily agreed
that WB should let the Sherman anti
trust law stand, unaltered, as it is,
with its debatable ground about It
but that we should as much as possi
ble reduce the area of that debatable
ground by further and more explicit
legislation, and should also supplement
that great act by legislation which
will not only clarify it but also facili
tate lta administration and make It
fairer to all concerned.
No doubt we shall all wish, and the
country will expect, this to be the
centre] subject of our deliberations
doling the present session, but it is a
subject so man; sided and so deserv
ins of careful and discriminating dis
cussion that I shall take the liberty of
addressing you upon It In a special
messntre at a later date than this. It
Is of capital importance that the busi
ness men of this country should be re
lieved "f all tinea Pintles of law with
regard to their enterprises and invest
ments and a clear path indicated
which they can travel without anxiety.
It is as Important that they should be
relieved of embarrassment and set
free to prosper ;is that private monop
oly should be destroyed. The ways of
action should be thrown wide open.
FAVORS DIRECT ELECTIONS.
Would Retain Conventions, Delegate*
to Be Nominees For Office, Whose
Duty It Would Be to Frame Plat
forms.
I turn to a subject which I hope can
be handled promptly and without seri
ous controversy of any kind. I mean
the method of selecting nominees for
tlie presidency of the United States. I
tttil confident that I do not misinter
pret the wishes or the expectations of
the country when I urge the prompt
enactment of legislation which will
provide for primary elections through
out the country at which the voters of
the several parties may choose their
nominees for the presidency without
ihe intervention of nominating conven
tions. 1 venture the suggestion that
this legislation should provide for the
retention of party conventions, but
only for the purpose of declaring and
accepting the verdict of the primaries
and formulating the platforms of the
parties, nnd I suggest that these con
ventions should consist not of dele
gates chosen for this single purpose,
but of the nominees for congress, the
nominees for vacant seats in the sen
ate of the United States, the senators
whose terms have not yet closed, the
national committees and the candi
dates for the presidency themselves,
in order that platforms may be framed
by those responsible to the people for
carrying them Into effect.
PHILIPPINE CONTROL
Must Hold Ultimate Independence In
View and Strive to Fit Filipino* For
Self Government at Future Date.
These are all matters of vital do
mestic concern, and besides them, out
side the charmed circle of our own na
tional life In which our affections com
mand us, as well as our consciences,
there stand out our obligations toward
our territories over sea. Here we are
trustees. Porto Rico. Hawaii, the Phil
ippines, are ours, indeed, but not ours
to do what we please with. Such ter
ritories, once regarded as mere posses
sions, are no longer to be selfishly ex
ploited: they are part of the domain of
public conscience and of serviceable
and enlightened statesmanship.
We must administer them for the
people who live in them and with the
same sense of responsibility to them as
toward our own people In our domestic
affairs. No doubt wo shall success
fully enough bind Porto Rico and the
Hawaiian Islands to ourselves by ties
of Justice and interest and affection,
but the performance of our duty to
ward the Philippines Is ■ more diffi
cult and debatable matter. We can
satisfy the obligations of generous jus
tice toward the people of Porto Rico
by giving the ample and familiar
rights and privileges accorded our own
citizens In our own territories and our
obligations toward the people of Ha
waii by perfecting the provisions for
self government already granted them,
but In the Philippines we must go fur
ther. We must hold steadily In view
their ultimate Independence, and we
must move toward the time of that
Independence as steadily as the way
can be cleared and the foundations
thoughtfully and permanently laid.
Acting under the authority conferred
nnpAine. president by congress^ lAave
•Xbc sLcavenwortb JEcbCu
nfrend.v accorded the people of the Is
lands n majority In both houses of
their legislative body by appointing
five instead of four nntlve citizens to
the membership of the commission. I
believe that in this way we shall make I
proof of their capacity in counsel and
their sense of responsibility in the ex
ercise of political power and that the
success of this step will be sure to
clear our view for the steps which are
to follow.
Step by step we should extend and
perfect the system of self government
In the Islands, making ti'st of them and
modifying them as experience diacloMi
their ■accesses find their failures; tliut
we should more and more pot under
the control of the native citizens of the
archipelago the essential instruments
of their life, their local instrumentali
ties of government, their schools, all
the common Interest! of their coinmu- |
nltles and so by counsel and experience
set up a government which all the
world will see to be suitable to a peo
ple whose affairs are tinder their own
control.
At lust, 1 hope and believe, we are
beginning to gain the confidence of the
Filipino peoples. By their counsel and
experience, rather than by our own,
we shall learn how best to serve them
and how soon it will be possible and
wise to withdraw our supervision. Let
us once find the path and set out with
firm and confident tread upon it, and
wo shall not wander from it or linger
upon it.
PROBLEM IN ALASKA.
Urges Development by Nation of Nat
ural Resources and Full Territorial
Form of Government.
A duty faces us with regard to Alas
ka which seems to me very pressing
and very imperative: perhaps I should
say v double duty, for it concerns both
the political and the material develop
ment of the territory. The people of
Alaska should be Riven the full terri
torial form of government, nnd Alas
ka, as n storehouse, should be unlock
ed. One key to it Is a system of rail
ways. These the government should
Itself build and administer, and the
ports and terminals it should itself
control in the interest of nil who wish
to use them ft* the service and devel
opment of the country and its people.
But the construction of railways Is
only the first step—ls only thrusting in
the key to the storehouse and throw
ing back the lock and opening the
door. How the tempting resources of
the country are to be exploited Is an
other matter, to which I shall take the
liberty of from time to time calling
your attention, for It is a policy which
must be worked out by well consid
ered stages, not upon theory but upon
Unes of practical expediency. It Is
part of our general problem of con
servation. We have a freer hand In
working out the problem in Alaßka
than in the states of the Union, and
yet the principle nnd object are the
same wherever we touch it. We must
use the resources of the country, not
lock them up.
There need be no conflict or jealousy
ns between state and federal authori
ties, for there can be no essential dif
ference of purpose between them. The
resources in question must be used,
but not destroyed or wasted; used, but
not monopolized upon any narrow idea
of individual rights as against the
abiding interests of communities. That
a policy can be worked out by confer
ence and concession which will release
these resources and yet not Jeopard
or dissipate them I for one have no
doubt, and it can be done on lines of
regulation which need be no less ac
ceptable to the people and government
of the natiou at large, whose heritage
these resources are. We must bend
our counsels to this end. A common
purpose ought to make agreement
easy.
EMPLOYER'S LIABILITY ACT.
Urges Legislation to Safeguard Work
men Both on Land and Sea —Points
Out Needed Economical Reforms.
Three or four matters of special Im
portance nnd significance I beg that
you will permit me to mention in clos
ing.
Our bureau of mines ought to be
equipped nnd empowered to render
even more effectual service than it ren
ders vow la Improvise the conditions of
mliie labor and making the mines more
economically productive as well as
more safe. This Is nn all important
part of the work of conservation, and
the conservation of human life and en
ergy lies even nearer to our interest
than the preservation from waste of
our material resources.
We owe it in mere justice to the rail
way employees of the country to pro
vide for them a fair and effective em
ployer's liability act; and a law that
we can stand by in this matter will be
no less to the advantage of those who
administer the railroads of the coun
try than to the advantage of those
whom they employ. The experience
of a large number of the states abun
dantly proves this.
We ought to devote ourselves to
meeting pressing demands of plain
Justice like this as earnestly as to the
accomplishment of political and eco
nomic reforms. Social justice comes I
first. Law Is the machinery for Its j
realization and is vital only as it ex
presses and embodies it.
An international congress for the dis
cussion of all questions that affect safe
ty at sea Is now Bitting la London at
the suggestion of our own government
So soon as the conclusions of that con
gress can be learned and considered
we ought to address ourselves, among
other things, to the prompt alleviation
of the very unsafe, unjust and burden
some conditions which now surround
the employment of sailors and render
tt extremely difficult to obtain the
services of spirited and competent men
su.h as. overv ship, needs if it is to be
safely liMiiillcil nnd brought to port.
Miv I not express the very real
pleasure I have experienced in co-op
emtltiß with this pongraw and sharing
with it tin- labors of common service
I to arnica It has devoted itself so unre
servedly during the past seven months
(if uncomplaining concentration upon
the business of legislation? Surely it
is a proper and pertinent part of my
report on "The State Of the Onion" to
express my admiration for the dili
gence, the good temper and the full
comprehension of public duty which
has already been manifested by both
the houses, and I hope that It may not
be deemed an Impertinent Intrusion
of myself Into the picture If I say with
how much ami how constant satisfac
tion I hi. '(■ availed myself of the priv
ilege of putting my time and energy
at their disposal alike in counsel and
In action. WOODROW WILSON.
