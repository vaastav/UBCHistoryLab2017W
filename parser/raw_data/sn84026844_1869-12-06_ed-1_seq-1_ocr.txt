id the ueneral commerce of the couny
to bring their curreucy to gold 1

Mr. Lovory, of Memphis, followed in

Mr. Ropes, of Boston, stated that the

lan It was four years ago, showing
tat while tbo oontldeuoe In the Gov.

of the matter until tbe next.meetig
of the Board, or. at least, until Con ess

Mr. Ohittenden, of New York, moved

Annual Urport oniio Comptroller or
Cnrreney.
Washington, Deo. 6.
The annual report ol I lie Comptroller
or curreny, ebows 1,020 banks In active
operation. Tlielr condition le more
gratifying limn formerly. The opportunity
afforded apecnlatora to raanlpu?
late the money market la aimoat entirely
done away with, and the banka
bay* more complete control ot their
attain. The Comptroller reoommenda
the peaaage of tbe aot requiring all
banka thai go Into liquidation to depoelt
legal tender notee lor outatandlng
circulation, anil take up their bonds
deposited wltli the ireaaury of tbe
United State* ?s aeourlty for anob Circulation
within CO daya from lbs date
ui iuo yum ui too BtuuKnoiacrn 10
wind up. He also reoommends that all
taxes on bank* be made returnable
ami payable to the Treasurer of the
United States, Including the apeolal
tax and dividend tax now payable to
the district collector*; tbat the compensation
of bank examiners be Increased
and provision be made for Its assessment
upon banks examined, and an
increase to fair compensation of persona
employed under him Id the Currency
liureau. The reoommendation
looking to the establishment of a central
redeeming agency In New York, In
last annual report. 1h renewed. The
Comptroller says the legal prohibition
to banka to hire deposit Is not aufllolently
explicit or positive to prevent It,
snd hints at legislation to that end.
The Comptroller argues In favor of
the National Banking syatem as the
oanae of eaae In the money market, and
lower rates of Interest than would
otherwise be obtained. He thinks
Government circulation which Is not
oonverttble, and therefore, not elaatio.
should be withdrawn and substituted,
by national bank notes whlob ate
nominally redeemable and oertalnly
amenable to the laws of trade. No
check to limitation should be imposed
on the latter other than the law of
supply and demand. A self adjusting
system of currency Is the only oue that
Is adapted to the exigencies of trade
and to the wanta of tbe country, and It
Is a vital question at this time whether
this result can be reached before the
return of specie payments, if possible,
at all. It Is only through the agency
uf national banks that the machinery
of the government Is not adapted
lo such ends and further,
if possible. It its so only npon the
Hdoptlon of a policy which will tend
gradually, but surely, to the resumption
of specie payments. I must be a
gradual development ofaprocesswhlob
shall absorb tho legal tenders and put
In their place a paper ourrenoy which
shall at all tlmea and under all circumstances
be exchangeable for coin, either
of paper legal tenders or of gold; a paper
ourrenoy which abalL gradually in*
urease, while the legal'teuders for lta re
jemptlon shall gradually decrease la
luch ratio as a healthy demand for
banking, facilities may determine.
While free banking may thus be established
with safety anterior to specie
payments conditioned only on the
withdrawal or cancellation of a legal
lender doll&r for every dollar of bank
jurroncy Issued. Free banking npon a
jpecle basis may also be permitted with
;qnal safety a^d without delay, with
letalls of property adjusted. Banks
nay be established with authority to
asoe and pot in circulation gold notes,
limiting the amount only to the ability
>f the hanku to comply with the necessa*
y conditions, aud redeem their issues
jy the establishment or banks on a spelie
basis. Resumption of speole pay*
nent Is only anticipated, and famillari*
y with gold values will do much to releve
the sultfectof mystery with which
t 1b associated In the minds of many
ooklug forward to the day when uniform
values shall again prevail. It
nay lie that by wise legislation now
i banking system can be established,
ruly national in its character and !
icope, which will furnish a Hound cur- i
ency of uniform value in every State i
>ftlie Union.
