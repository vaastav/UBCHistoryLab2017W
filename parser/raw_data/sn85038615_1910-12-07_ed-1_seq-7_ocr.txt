POST-OFEICE DEPARTMENT.
I'ustul Siniug-. Banks.
At Its last session Congress mado pro?
vlslon for the establishment of savings
bnnks by th* Post-Offlce Department of
thls government, by whleh. under tbe gen
<:.i. control of trustees, conslstlng of tlie
Pos'.maater-Oeneral. the Secretary of tho
Treasury: and the Attorney-CJcncral. thc
system could be begun !n a few cltics and
towns. and enlarged to cover withln l:s
operatlons as many citles and towns and as
large a part of tho country as seemed wise.
Thc Inltlation and establlshment of such a
syetem has required a ureat deal of study
on the part of thc experts In the Post-Offlce
and Treasury' Departments. but a system
has now been dcvlsed which Ib belleved to
be more economical and simpler ln its opera?
tion than any slmllar system abroad. Ar
rangements have been perefcted so that
favinga banks wl'.I be opened In some
citlea and towns on the lst of January.
and thero wlll bo a gradual extenslon o'f
the henfits of the plan. to the rest of the
country'
Wlplng Out nf PoMul Deflelt.
As I have sald. the Post-Offlce Depart?
ment is a great buslness department. and
I am glad to note tho fact that under Its
present manaKement principlcs of buslness
?*conomy and efflclency are being applled.
Kor many years there has been a deflelt
In the operatlons of the Post-Offlre Depart?
ment, which has been met hy appropria?
tion from the Trcasury- The appropria?
tion estlmated for last year from the
Trcasury ov?r and above thc recelpts o!
the department, was $17.-500.000. I am glad
to record the fact that of that $17,500,000 es
tirnated for. $11,590,000 wero saved and re?
turned to the Trcasury.
A prlnclple which the Postmaster-Genorai
lias recommended nnd Bought to have en

Thls has greatly strengthened tho Interest

that thls would securo for them a further

wdd much to the efflclency of their offlces
and an economical admlnistration. A largo
numher of tho foui'th-class postmastors
are now In the closslfled servlce. I think
U would be wise to put in the classltled
servlce tho flrst, second, and thlrd-class
postmasters. It ls moro loglcal to do thls
tha nto classlfy the fourth-clasa postmasters,
for the reason that tho fourth-class post

Conservatlon.
The subject of tho conservatlon of tha
lublic domain has commanded the at
entlon of tho people withln thc last two
it thrco years. /
Agricultural Lands.
There is no r.eed for radlcal reform in
he methods of disposing of what ara
natly agricultural lands. The present laws
lave worked well. The eniarged home
tead law has encouraged the successful
arrnlng of lands in the stmi-arld re
?ions.
Rnclamation.
Thc toStl sum already accumulated In the
und provided by the act for the reclama
ion of arld Sands Is about 463,119.058.76. and
if this. all but ;?.'..-_._.-.:?. has been ai
otted to the various projects, of whlch
here. aro thlrty. Congress at Its last scs
uon provided for the issulng of certlfl
:ates of Indobtodness not exceeding twen
y mllllons of dollars, to be redecmed from
he reclamation fund when the proceeds
>f lands sold and from the water rents
ihoulid bc sufficient. Meantlme, in ac
:ordanco with the provislons of the law, J
ippolnted a board of army englneers to
>xamlne the projects and to ascertain
?vhich are feaglble and worthy of com

Conservatlon Address.
In September last a conservatlon con
jress was held at St. Paul, at whlch 1
ielivcrcd an address on the subject of
:onservatlon so far as lt was withln thc
lurisdlctlon and posslble action of the Fed
:ral government. In that address I as
sembled from tho offlciai records tho sta?
tistics and facts as to what had been
ione in thls behalf in the adminlstratlon
3f my predeceasor and ln my own, and
indlcated the legisiatlve measures which
1 belleved to be wlso tn ordor to secure
the best use, in tho public interest, of what
remains of our natlonal domain. There
was in- this address a very full dlscus
Hon of the reasons whlch lod mo to the
concluslons stated. For the purpose of
saving ln an offlciai record a comprehen
sive resume of tho statistios and facts
sathered with somo difflculty in that ad
ilress, an dto avoid their repetitlon ln the
body of thls mesaage. I venture to make
the address an accompanying appendlx. The
?tatlstlca aro corrected to November 15
last.
Speclflc Kecommendutlons.
For the reasons stated ln tho conservatlon
address, I recommend:
First. That tho llmltation now imposed
upon tho Executivo which forbids hls re
servlng moro forest lands ln Oregon, Wash?
lngton, Idaho, Montana, Colorado and Wy?
omlng, bo repealed.
Second. That tho coal depoBlts of tho gov?
ernment bo loasod after advertisement In
vitlng compctitlvo bids. for terms not ex?
ceeding fifty years, wlth a minlmum ron
tal and royalties upon the coal mlnod, to
bo roudjusted ovcry ten or twelve years,
and wlth conditlons as to malntenanco
which wilil socuro proper mlning, and us to
assignmont whlch wlll prevent comblna
tlons to monopollze controi of tho coal In
any ono dlstrlct or market. I do not thlnk
that coal meuBiires under _,G0O acres ol
surface would bo too large an amount to
leaeo to any ono lesseo.
Thlrd. That tho law should provldo tho
same soparatlou ln rospect to gnvcrmnent
phosphato Hands of surfaco and mineral
rights that now obtains in coal lands, and
th|tt powor to ieaso such lands upon terms
and llmltatlons simllar to thoso abovo ree?
ommended for coal leascs, with an added
condition onabllng tho government to rog
ulate, and, lf need be, to prohlblt, thu
export to forblgn countrles of tho product.
Fourth. That the law should allow a
prospector tor oll or gas to havo tho rlght
to prospect Ior two yoars over a certain
tract of govorumont land, tho rlght to bc
ovldencod by a llconso, for which ho shall
p'ay a small sum: nnd that upon dlsoovory
u lenao may bo gruntod upon terms suour
lug a minlmum rotitnl and proper royalties
to tho govornmout, nnd _lso tho conduet
of tho oll nr gas well ln accord wlth Iho
bost mothod for husbandlng the aupply of
oll in thu dlatrlct. Tho perlod of tho |o?sos
should not bo as long as thoso of coal,
but thoy ahould coi.'lali: simllar provislons
us to assignmont to prevent monopollstlc
comblnatlons.
Fifth. That waterp'ower sltos bo dlroetly
loasod by tho Federal government, artor
advertlalng and bidding, for nat excood
Ing ftfty years, upon a proper rontiil und
wlth a condition llxlng ratus chargud lo
tliu public for tiiills ot oloctrlo power, both
rtmtul nnd rates to bo roadJustod equltably
avary ten yeara by arbitraiion or ot|.?^.

InterMnte Commerre Commlsslon.
Tlierc has not beon tlme to test tho ben
It and utllity of tbe iimcudmcnts to the
iterstate commerce Inw contalnud in the
rt approved June W. 1910. Thc law ag
laeted did not eontaln nll the featurcs
hich I reeommended. It did not. specirt
llly denounce as unlawful tho purchase
r one of two porallcl and compoting roads
t thn atock of the other. Nor did. It
lbject to tho reatrainlng Influence of the
lteratatc Commerce Commlgslon thc power
! corporations engaged In operatlng lnter
tatn rallroads to Issue now stock and
onds. nor did lt authorlzc the making of
?mpornry agreeraents between rallroads.
Imlted to thlrty days. flxlng the same
atcs for trafflc between the samn placcs.
I do not press the conslderatlon of any
r these ob.leets upon Congress at thls ses
ion. The object of tlie tlrst provlslon Is
-robably generally coveied by the anti
rust law. The second provlslon was In the
ct rcferrod to thc conslderatlon of a com
lisslon to be appolnted by thn Executlve
nd to report upon thc matter to Con
reaa. That commlsslon ha* been appolnted
nd Is engaged In tho invcstlgatloii and
onslderation of the questlon aubmitted un
er the law.
Tlte thlrd proposal led to so much miscon
tructlon of Its object, it being that of
?eakonlng the eftectlvencss of thc antl
rust law, that I am not dlspoacd to preai
for further conslderatlon. It was Intqnded
o permlt rallroad companles to avold use
?ss nile-cuttlng by a moro temporary ac
uiesccncc in the same rates for tho same
ervico over competlng rallroads, wlth no
bllgatlon whatever to malntaln those rates
or any tlme.
Safety Appllauces nnd Provislons.
Tho protectlon of rallroad employes from
ersonnl Injury is a subject of tho highest
nportance and demands continulng attcn
ion. Thero have boen two measures pend
ig in Congress. one for the supervlslon ot
otlers and the other for the cnlargement
f dangerous clearances. Certainly soms
icaaures ought to be adopted looklng to
preventipn of accldents from thesa
tuses.
t seems to me that with respect to boller*
blll might well be drawn requiring and
nforclng by penalty a proper system of
ispectlon by the rallway companles them
elves whlch would aecomplish our purpose.
'hc entire removal of outside clearancej
.ould be attended by such enormous ex
ense that some other remedy must bg
dopted. By act of May 6, 1910, the Inte\
tate Commerce Commlsslon is authorlzetf*
nd dlroctPd to investigata accldents. to
eport ihelr c.auses and Its recommenda
lons. 1 auggeat that lhe commlsslon bs
equestPd to make a special report as to
njurles from outside clearances and the
pest method or reducing them. *
Vtiliiatlou nf Rallroads.
Thc Interstate Commerce Commission has
ecommended approprlatlons for the pur
iose of enablins lt to enter upon a valua
ion of all rallroads. This has always
iccn withln the jurlsdlctlon of the com
nlssion, but the requlslto runds have been
vantlrig. Statistics or tha value of each
ailroad would bo valuablo for many pur
loses. especlally lf we ultlmately onact any
Imitatlona upon tho power of tho inter
tate railroads to Issue stocks and bonds,
is I hopo we may. I thlnk, therefore, that
ii order to permit a eorrect understanding
if thc facta, It would bo wlse to make a
ensouablo approprlatlon to enable tho In
erstato Commerce Commlsslon to proceed
vlth due dispatch to the valuatlon of all
allroads. 1 have no doubt that rallroad
?ompanies IhemaeJvea can and wlll greatly
acllitato thls valuatlon and mako it much
oaa coatly ln tlme and money than hus
ieeu supposed.

lortlns lo be Issue.! agalnst cotton, somi
nouths alnco. -esulted ln losses of severai
nlllious of dollars to Amerlcan and foreign
lanklng and cotton Interests,
For lhe protectlon of our own poople
ind tho prcservatlon of our credit ln for
->lgn trade, I urge upon Congress tho Im
iHrilate cnuctment of a law under whlch
mo who. In good faith, udvancea money or
;redit upon a ">lll ot' ludiug Isaued by a
ommon earrlcr upon an Interstate or for

for tlie value of lhe goods descrlbed i-i
iho hlll at the valuatlon speolfled lu the .
blll. at loast to tho estent of lhe adv'ancet

I further recommend that n punishment

rallroad agents and shippera for fraud oi
nitsiepreaentation lu connectlon wlth lhe
Issue of bills ot ladlng iaaucd upon intni
state ?nd forelftn shlpments.
Kxoepl as above. I do not'ivcommend any
amendment to tha Interstate commerce law
aa It stands. I do not now recommend
anv amendment lo tho antl-iruat law. Ir.
