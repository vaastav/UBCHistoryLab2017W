Chief Executive Gives Reasons for De
siring the Passage of Such a Meas

for Conservation of National Re
sources
Washington Tho president trans
mitted tho following message to con
gress
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives
The relations of the United States with
all foreign governments havo continued
upon the normal bnsln of amity and good
understanding and arc very generally
satisfactory
Latin America
One of the happiest events In recent
PanAmerican diplomacy was tho pacific
Independent settlement by tho govern
ments of Bolivia anti Peru of a boundary
difference between them which for some
weeks threatened to cause war and even
to entrain cmbltterments affecting other
republics lens directly concerned From
various quarters dlrjfrtly or Indirectly
concerned the Intermediation of the Uni
ted States was sought to assist In a so
lution of the controversy Desiring at all
limns to abstain from any undue mingling
in the affairs of sister republics and hay
ing faith In the ability of the govern
mentB of Peru and liollvla themselves to
settle their differences In a manner satis
factory to themselves which viewed with
magnanimity would assuage all embit
terment this government steadily ab
stained from being drawn Into the con
troversy and was much grUined to find
Its confidence justified by events I
On the ninth of July next there will
open at Buenos Aires the fourth Pan
American conference This conference
will have a special meaning to the hearts
of all Americans because around Its date
are clustered the anniversaries of the In
dependence of to many American repub
lics It Is not necessary for me to remind
the congress of the political social and
commercial Importance of these gather
Ings You are asked to make liberal ap
propriation for our participation If this
be granted It Is i my purpose to appoint
a distinguished and representative dele
gation qualified fittingly to represent this
country and to deal with the problems of
Intercontinental Itercst l which will there
be discussed
The Argentine Republic will also hold
from May to November 1910 at Diieribs
Aires a great International agricultural
exhibition In which the United States has
been invited to participate Considering
the rapid growth of the trade of the Uni
ted States with the Argentina Republic
and the cordial relations existing between
the two nations together with the fact
that It provides an opportunity to show
deference to a sister republic on the oc
casion of the celebration of Its nation
al Independence the proper departments
of this government are taking steps to ap
prise the Interests concerned of the op
portunity afforded by this exhibition In
which appropriate participation by this
country Is BO desirable The designation
of an official representative Is also receiv
ing pntmlderntlnn
n
The PanAmerican policy of this goy
crnmcnt has long been fixed In Its prin
ciples und remains unchanged With the
changed circumstances of the United
States and of the republics to the south
of us most of which have great natural
resources stable government and pro
gressive Ideals the apprehension which
gave rise to the Monroe doctrine may be
Bald to have nearly disappeared and nei
ther doctrine as It exists nor any
other doctrine of American policy should
be permitted to operate for the perpetua
tion of Irresponsible government the es
cape of Just obligations or tho Insidious
allegation of dominating ambitions on the
part of the United Static
Beside the fundamental doctrines of our
PanAmerican policy there have grown
up a realization of political Interests
community of Institutions nnd Ideals and
a flourishing commerce All these bonds i
will be greatly strengthened as time goes
on and Increased facilities such as the
great bank soon to be established In Lat
inAmerica supply the means for build
Ing up tho colossal Intercontinental com
merce of the future
My meeting with President Diaz and
the greeting exchanged on both Ameri
can and Mexico soil served I hope to
signalize the close and cordial relations
which so well bind together this republic
and the great republic Immediately to the
south between which there Is so vast a
network of material Interests
I am happy to say that all but one of
the cases which for so long vexed our
relations with Venezuela have bee sat
tied within the past few months and that
under the enlightened regime now direct
ing the government of Venezuela provi
sion has been made for arbitration of the
remaining case before The Hague tri
bunal
Since the Washington conventions of
1907 were communicated to the govern
ment of tim United States as u consult
ing and advisory party this government
lias been almost continuously called upon
by ono or another and In turn by all of
the five Central American republics to
exert Itself for the maintenance of the
conventions Nearly every complaint has
been against the Zclaya government of
Nicaragua which has kept Central Amer
ica In constant tension and turmoil The
responds made to the representations of
Central American republics as duo from
the United States on account of Its rela
tion to the Washington conventions have
been at all times conservative and have
avoided so far as possible any semblance
of Interference although It Is very appar
ent that the considerations ot geograph
ic proximity to the canal zone and of the
very substantial American Interests In
Central America give to the United
Status a special position In tho zone of
these republics nnd tho Caribbean sea
I need not rehearse here the patient
efforts of this government to promote
peace and welfare among these repub
lics efforts which are fully appreciated
by tho majority of them who are loyal
to their true Interests It would be no
less unnecessary to rehearse hero the
Bad tale of unspeakable barbarities and
oppression aliened to havo been commit
ted by tho Zqlaya government Recently
two Americans wero put to death by or
der of President Eelayn himself They
were ofllcera In the organized forces of
a revolution which was In control of
about half of the republic and as such
according to the modern enlightened
practice of civilized nations they were
entitled < < to be dealt with as prisoners of
war
waAt the date when this message Is
printed this government has terminated
diplomatic relations with the Zelaya gov
ernment for reasons made public In a
communication to tho former Nicaragua
charge daffaires and Is Intending to take
such future steps as may bo found most
consistent with Its dignity Us duty to
American Interests and Its moral obliga
tions to Central America and to civiliza
tion
Department of State
I earnestly recommend to the favor
able consideration of tho congress the es
timates submitted by the department of
state and most especially the legisla
tion suggested In the secrtary of states
letter of this date whereby It will be
possible to develop and make permanent
the reorganization of the department
upon modern lines In n manner to make
It a thoroughly efficient Instrument In
the furtherance of our foreign trade and
of American Interests abroad The plan
to have divisions of LatinAmerican and
TarEastern affairs and to Institute n
certain specialization In business with
Hurope and the near east will at once
commend Itself These politicogeograph
teal I divisions and the detail from the
diplomatic or consular service to thn
department of a number of men who
bring to the study of complicated prob
lems In different parts of the world
practical knowledge recently gained on
the spot clearly In I of the greatest ad
vantage to the secretary of state In
foreseeing conditions likely to arise and
In conducting the great variety of corre
spondence and negotiation It should bo
remembered that such facilities exist In
the foreign offices of all the leading com
mercial nations and that to deny them
to the secretary of state would be to
place this government at a great disad
vantage In the rivalry of commercial
competition
Tho consular service has been un
proved under the law of April 5 1900
and tho executive order of June 27 1900
and I commend to your consideration tho
question of embodying In a statute the
principles of the present executive order
upon which the efficiency of our consular
service Is wholly dependent
Expenditures and Revenues
Perhaps the most Important question
presented to this administration IB i that
of economy In expenditures and sulll
clcncy of revenue Time deficit of the
last fiscal year and the certain deficit
of the current year prompted congress
to throw a greater responsibility on
the executive and the secretary of the J
treasury than had heretofore been de
clared by statute This declaration
Imposes upon the secretary of the
treasury the duty of assembling all the
estimates of the executive departments
bureaus and offices of the expenditures
necessary In the ensuing fiscal year
qnd of making an estimate of the reve
nues of the government for the same
period and If a probable deficit Is thus
shown It Is made the duty of the presi
dent to recommend the method by
which such deficit can be met
The report of the secretary shows
that tho ordinary expenditures for the
current fiscal year ending June 30 1910
will exceed the estimated receipts by
3407Bf20 If to this deficit Is added
the sum to be disbursed for the Pan
ama Canal amounting to 38000000
and 1000000 to be paid on the public
debt the deficit of ordinary receipts
and expenditures will be Increased to
a total deficit of J7307B620 This def
icit the secretary proposes to meet by
the proceeds of bonds Issued to pay
the cost of constructing the Panama
Canal I approve this proposal
In order to avoid a deficit for the
ensuing fiscal year I directed the
heads of departments In the prepara
tion of their estimates to make them
as low as possible consistent with Im
perative governmental necessity
Civil Pensions
I am aware that there Is a strong
feeling In both houses of congress and
possibly In the country against the
establishment of civil pensions and
that this has naturally grown out of
the heavy burden of military pensions
which It has always been the policy
I
of our government to assume but I
am strongly convinced that no other
practical solution of the difficulties
presented by the superannuation of
civil servants can be found than that
of a system of civil pensions
Frauds In the Collection of Customs
I regret to refer to the fact of the
discovery of extensive frauds In the
collection of the customs revenue at
New York city In which a number of
the subordinate employeR In the weigh
Ing and other departments wero di
rectly concerned and In which the
beneficiaries were the American Sugar
Refining Comfny and others The
frauds consisted In the payment of
duty on underweights of sugar The
government has recovered from the
American Sugar Refining Company all
that It Is shown to have been defraud
ed of The sum was received In full
of the amount due which might have
been recovered by civil suit against
the beneficiary of tho fraud but there
was an express reservation In the con
tract of settlement by which the settle
ment should not Interfere with or pre
vent the criminal prosecution of every
one who was found to be subject to
the same
Criming prosecutions are now pro
ceeding against a number of tho gov
ernment officers The treasury de
partment and the department of jus
tice are exerting every effort to dis
cover all the wrongdoers Incl cling
the officers and employes of the com
panies who may have been privy to
the fraud It would seem to me that
an Investigation of the frauds by con
gress at present pending the probing
by the treasury department nnd the
department of justice as proposed
might by giving Immunity and other
wise prove an embarrassment In secur
ing conviction of the guilty parties
The Tariff Act
Two features of the now tariff act
call tar special reference By virtue
of the clause known all the maximum
and minimum clause It Is the duty
of the executive to consider the laws
and practices of other countries with
reference to the Importation Into those
countries of the products and mer
chandise of the United States and If
the executive finds snch laws and prac I
tices not to be unduly discriminatory
agftnst the United States the mini
mum duties provided In the bill are to
go Into force Unless the president
makes such a finding then the maxi
mum duties provided In the bill that
Is an Increase of 25 per cent ad valo
rem over the minimum duties are to
be In force Fear has been expressed
that this power conferred and duty
Imposed on the executive Is likely to
lead to a tariff war I beg to express
the hope and belief that no such result
need be anticipated
Tho discretion granted to the execu
tive by the terms unduly discrim
inatory Is wide In order that the
maximum duty shall be charged against
the Imports from a country It Is neces
sary that ho shall find on the part of
that country not only discriminations
In Its laws or the practice under thorn
against the trade of time United States
but that the discriminations found
shall be undue that Is without good
and fair reason I conceive that this
power Was reposed In the president
with the hope that the maximum du
ties might never be applied In any case
but that the power to apply them would
S
enable the president and tho state de
partment through friendly negotiation
to secure the elimination from the laws
and the practice under them of any
foreign country of that which Is un
duly discriminatory No ono Is seek
ing a tariff war or a condition In which
tho spirit of retaliation shall be
aroused
Needs of the Navy
The return of the battleship fleet from
Its voyage around the world In moro
efficient condition than when It started
was a noteworthy event of Interest alike
to our citizens and the naval authorities
of tile WO Id Ilesklcs tho beneficial and
farreaching effect on our personal and
diplomatic relations In the countries
which tho Meet visited the marked suc
cess of tho ships In steaming around tho
world In all weathers In schedule lime
has Increased respect for our navy and
has added to our national prestige
Injunctions Without Notice
The platform of tho successful party In
flue last election contained the following
The Republican party will uphold ut
all times tho authority and Integrity of
the courts state nnd federal nnd will
eor Insist that their powers to enforce
their process and protect lifo liberty
and property shall be preserved Inviolate
Wo believe however that the rules of
procedure In the federal courts with re
spect to the Issuance of tho writ of In
junction should be more accurately de
fined by statute and that no Injunction
or temporary restraining order should bo
Issued without notice except where Ir
reparable Injury would result from delay
In which case a speedy Jieurlng there
after should be granted
I recommend that In compliance with
the promise thus made appropriate legis
lation ba adopted Tho ends of justice
will best be met and the chief cause of
complaint against Illconsidered Injunc
tions without notice will be removed by
the enactment of a statute forbidding
hereafter the Issuing of any Injunction
or restraining order whether temporary
or permanent by any federal court
without pluvious notice and u reasonable
opportunity to be heard on behalf of the
parties to be enjoined unless It shall ap
pear to the satisfaction of the court that
the delay necessary to give such notice
and hearing would result In Irreparable
Injury to tho complainant and unless also
the court shall from the evidence make
a written finding which shall be spread
upon the court minutes that Immediate
and Irreparable Injury Is likely to rnsuo
to the complainant and hull define the
Injury state why It Is Irreparable and
shall also Indorse on the order Issued the
date and the hour 01 the Issuance of the
order Moreover every such Injunction
or restraining order Issued without pre
vious notice and opportunity by the de
fendant dr be heard should by force of
the beit f to expire and be of no effect
aftei days from tho Issuance there
of 01 w mn any time less than that pe
riod which the court may fix unless
within the Injunction or order Is ex
tended or renewed after previous notice
and opportunity to be heard
SecondClass Mall Matter
Tho deficit every jcar In the post
ofllce department Is largely caused by the
low rate of postage of ono cent a pound
charged on secondclass mall matter
Which Includes not only newspapers but
magazines and miscellaneous periodicals
The actual loss growing out of the trans
mission of this secondclass mall matter
at one cent a pound amounts to about
63000000 a year The average cost of the
transportation of this matter Is moro than
nine cents a pound
It appears that the average distance ov
er which newspapers are delivered to
their customers Is 291 miles while the
average haul of magazines Is 1049 and
of miscellaneous periodicals 1128 miles
Thus the average haul of tho magazine
Is three and onehalf times and that of
the miscellaneous periodical nearly four
times the haul of the dally newspaper yet
all of them pay the same postage rate of
one cent a pound The statistics of 1907
show that secondclass malt matter con
stituted 6391 per cent of the weight of
all the mall and yielded only 619 per cent
of the revenue
Tho figures given are startling and
show the payment by the government of
an enormous subsidy to tho newspapers
magazines and periodicals and congress
may well consider whether radical steps
should not bo taken to reduce the deficit
In the postofllcu department caused by
this discrepancy between the actual cost
of trnnsp6rtatlon > and the compensation
exacted therefor i
A great saving might be made amount
Ing to much more than half of the loss
by Imposing upon magazines and peri
odicals n higher rate of postage They
are much healer than newspapers and
contain a much higher proportion of ad
vertising to rending matter and the aver
age distance of their transportation Is
three and l a half times as great
Postal Savings Banks
The second subject worthy of mention I
In the postofllcn department Is the real
necessity and entire practicability of es
tablishing postal savings banks The suc
cessful party at the last election declared
In favor of postal savings banks and al
though the proposition finds opponents In
many parts of the country I am con
vinced that the people desire such banks
and am sure that when the banks are fur
nished they will be productive of the ut
most good
goodFavors
Favors Ship Subsidy
Following the course of my distin
guished predecessor I earnestly recom
mend I to congress the consideration nnd
passage of a ship subsidy bill looking to
time establishment of lines between our
Atlantic seaboard and the eastern coast
of South America as well as lines from
the west coast of the United States to
South America China Japan anti the
Philippines The profits on foreign malls
are perhaps a sufficient measure of the
expenditures which might first be tenta
tively applied to this method of Inducing
American capital to undertake the estab
lishment of American lines of steamships
In those directions In which we now feel
It most Important that we should have
means of transportation controlled In the
Interest of tho einslon of our trade A
bill of this character has once passed tho
house and more than once passed the
senate and I hope that at this session a
bill framed on the same lines and with
time same purposes may become a law
Conserving National Resources
In several departments there Is present
ed the necessity for legislation looking to
the further conservation of our national
resources and the subject Is one of such
Importance as to require n more datnlled
anti l extended discussion than can ho en
tered upon In this communication For
that reason I shall take an early oppor
tunity to send a special message to con
gress on the subject of the Improvement
of our waterways upon the reclamation
and Irrigation of arid semiarid and
swamp lands upon the preservation of
our forests and the reforesting of suit
able areas upon the reclasslflcatlon of
the public domain with a view of sep I
arating from agricultural settlement min i
eral coni and phosphate lands and l Bites
belonging to time government bordering on
streams suitable for the utilization of
water power
Political Contribution
I urgently recommend to congress that
a law be passed requiring that candi
dates In elections of members of the
house of Representatives and committees
In charge of their candidacy and cam
paign file In a proper ofllco of tile United
States government a statement of tho
contributions received and of the expen
ditures Incurred In the campalrn for such
elections and that similar lei jlatlon be
enacted In respect to all other election
which are constitutionally within the con

She Set the Hands at Six oclock and Stared at Them for Ten Minutes
In the death of Grandma Susan
Jtlllbeck which took place unexpect
edly last Thursday Detzvtllo lost one
ot her most soberminded female citi
zens and by order of tho city council
a crapo streamer was tied to the Pill
beck box In the Betzvlllo post office
As there has been very little doing in
black goods In Betzville lately the
Bankrupt Store next the post office
supplied the crape at halfprice The
Bankrupt Store Is one of Detzvllles
oldest and most enterprising mercan
tile concerns and is conducting a
mourning sale all this week In mem
ory of Grandma Pillbeck who used to
trade there Anyone expecting to
mourn In the near future should take
advantage of this sale
When Interviewed as to the cause
of Grandma Plllbecks sudden demise
Orlando Pillbeck her son Informed
our reporter that sho was simply worn
to a frazzle As he remarks In the
graceful obituary poem published on
another page right under Uncle Ash
dod Clutes hog and cattle sale adver
tisement
Grandma Pillbeck has gone and went
Where the angels brightly dazzle
Getting to bed her strength It spent
And waned her to a frazzle
In this connection wo wish to re
mark that Ephron Quat proprietor of
the Betzvillo Furniture Emporium
says that If Orlando had opened up a
little and had bought grandma ono of
the patent spring beds ho Is now
showing she would have lasted much
longer these bods being bouncy and
more resilient than the slat bed on
which Grandma Plllbeck frazzled awny
to eternity
It seems that some years ago Grand
ma Pillbeck read In a paper that over
sleeping In the morning could be eas
ily avoided and as she was a regular I
oversleeper she took the article to
heart It said that It was only nec
essary to get a clock and before re
tiring set the hands to point to tho
desired rising time natl stare nt them
long and well and when tho hands
reached that position In the morning
the tleeper would unfailingly nwakeu < <
So Grandma Pillbeck got a tin clock
for 84 cents and tried it Sho set the
hands at six oclock and stared at
them for ten minutes and then set
the clock at the proper time and went
to bed and sure enough at exactly
six oclock the next morning she
awakened She was delighted and
did It again the next night and the
next morning she again awakened at
six oclock precisely After that she
kept It up regularly and It never
failed For about three years she
gaze l at six oclock every night and
awakened at six oclock every morn I
Ing and by that time she had ac
quired the habit of rising whenever
tho hands of tho clock pointed to six
She round that she had looked attho
clock so often that It was no longer
necessary to look at It before going to
bed whenever the hands pointed to
six she had to Jump out of bed
About five weeks ago while Grand
ma Plllbeck was sleeping peacefully
In the middle of tho night she sud
denly jumped out of bed as If 1m
polled by an IrrcBlstablo impulse o
as oho expressed It as If come one
had kicked mo out and when sho
lighted her lamp she saw that the
clock was pointing to six oclock
Somethlnc had gone wrong with the
works of tho tin clock as things are
apt to go wrong with the inwards of
hose 84cent clocks and the clock
was running too fast but as long as
site was up she thought sho might a8
well stay up so she did But in three
hours tho hands of the clock had run
around to six again and Grandma
Plllbeck felt herself Irreslstably im
pelled to get into bed again or as
she expressed It as if some one had
kicked me into bed
As she lay there thinking what
would be the best thing to do she fell
Into a doze and she must have slept
three hours for the first thing she
know sho was Irreslstably impelled
out of bed again Tho hands of the
clock were pointing to six
I
That afternoon Orlando Plllbeck
her son took the tin clock and a
screwdriver and set to work to cor
rect the clock and Gnrndma Plllbeck
had a long rest out of bed for Orlando
found he could not get all tho parts
back into the tin clock that ha had
taken out of it but about sundown
ho gave it up and put all tho parts
ho could back Into tho clock Ho had
to leave out the little jigger that
keeps the clock from running away
with Itself But by leaving the clock
unwound and setting the hands per
sonally when she wanted to go to bed
and having Orlando set them at six
when it was time for her to get up
she did very well until Orlando hap
pened to go away for a week of fish
ing That week grandma slept a
whole week and when Orlando re
turned and set the clock she was so
week from lack of food that sho wob
bled So Orlando decided to get a
new tin clock and when tho peddler
came around ho traded in the old one
and 75 cents for a new one
All would havo been well hut it
seems that Grandma Pillbeck had be
come attuned to tho old clock as you
might say and did not respond to
the new one and the peddl r must
have given tho old clock to his chil
dren to play with when ho got homo
His children must have spent their
days winding the old tin clock and al
lowing It to run down at the rate of
24 hours a minute They were prob
ably early risers those children and
went to bed late and played with the
old tin clock Industriously for from
six a m until nine p in Grandma
Plllbecc responded to the hands of
the clock Every few seconds sho p
was IrrcslRtably impelled Into bed
and every few seconds sho was Ir
reslstably Impelled out again as tho
bands of the clock marked six It
was pitiful to see tho soberfaced old
lady bouncing into bed and qut of it
She would stand with a scared ex
pression and suddenly she would
twitch and Into bed she would go and
Immediately sho would twitch and out
she would come She woro off n
great deal of flesh on tho slats of tho
bed but the clock made faster and
faster time and at last she only had
time to hit tho floor before she went
back and hit tho slats
Orlando tried to find where the
peddler lived so he could take tho
clock away from him but no ono
knew and Grandma Plllbeck bounced
beypnd the troubles of this world at
eight oclock last Thursday morning
