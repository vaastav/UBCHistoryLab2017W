Party Wot Too Bager to Depart?A.
Itrosf Effort to Secure U??oBf-Tli?
District Debt m? the Pr?ild?Bt'i Ve
racity.
In the House the dobiti on the Kelley bill wont
?over, because Mr. Dawes, who has the floor, was
too hoarse to speak, and Decause It was not de
sirable to come to a Tote to-day. The bill will
probably be defeated. It has, at any rate, no
chance in the Senate. Mr. Kelley has got down
Jrom his high horse, and does not Intend for the
present to leave the party, even If he Is badly
beaten. General Butler is now the only one who
appears ready to step ashore, and there In a dis
position in some quarters to put out a plana for
him whenever he wishes. But even he may thlnK
?better ol It. There seems to be less desire to keep
men in the ranlcs by force than was expected.
There are In lact signs that the republican panlo
?ay subside and that a strong effort will be made
to bring the party Into harmony with ItseU and
with the administration. In tne House to-day Mr.
Bale, of Maine, raised an excited discussion over
a charge of Mr. Randall, or Pennsylvania, that the
President had understated the District debt. Mr.
Bale delended the President with great vigor.
^ Kind of Economy for One's Neigh
bor?Our Patriot Statesmen set am Ki
aasple.
Economy la not yet the order of the day. Every
body in lact woula like everybody else to bo eco
nomical The President recommends economy to
Congress, but thinks it would be wise to subsidise
steamships. Senator West would like to combtne
economy with a government telegraph from
Washington to Boston, to be worked by the Post
edice clerks, and to give everybody
telegraphic messages at cost. Senator
Bcott declined to commit himself in favor
of a guarantee of interest on the bonds of fhe
TezaB Pacific and Atlantto and Pacific railroads,
bnt introduced a bill to that effect, nevertheless,
to-day. Mr. Page thinks Saeramento ought to
liave a post offlce, at a cost, to begin with, of
$100,000, Tne lumbermen?the men who own saw*
mills and timber lands?protest against the Cana
dian Reciprocity Treaty Which would give u? cheap
lumber.
Is a Republican Inquest Desirable.
Two memDers of Congress to-day, dlscussln* the
advisability of a republican caucus, one remarked
that he bad not heatd of one being called and dla
Dot see what object there would be In holding a
caucus, except in the capacity of a coroner's Jury.

The Republican Senatorial Cane us?The
Southern State Governments.
Tbe republican Senators spent about an hour
and a naif in caucus this afternoon on the subject
of Arkansas affairs, but adjourned without coming
to any conclusion. Only a lew senators expressed
themselves in favor of intervention, and even
M0se were not agreed as to tbe exact form
or movement. Others were disposed to post
puae action, as tbe present condition of tbe
Bi*te did not seem to justify Congressional mea
sures. all accoanta repreaentlng the people gen.
craUr to be satisfied with tbeir present govern
ment, with no cause lor violent disturbance. The
qucstioo ot tbe condition of Louisiana also becom

Uiund on exsminatlon that the governments of
one or twe of tbe other Southern States had no
more legal exlstenee than that of Louisiana, and
therefore there should be an Investigation con
cerning all of them in order to establish their va

Bcantors widely from tbe original t >t conver

Congress MaasrlaliMd by th? Ballread
Lobby?The Texas and Pacific and At

The memorial presented to Congress to-day In
behalf of tue Texss and Pacific and Aiautic and
Pacific Katlway companies is signed by Thomas A.
Scott and A. Pierce, Jr, as the respective presi
dents of those corporations, snd sets forth the
following, among otner arguments, In favor of the
enactment ot the bill, whose main provision*
were published last Monday
They say a Southern trunk line of railroad to the
Pacific Is a necessity, and its oezmtruction sooold
be insured ay the government as a practical
means of settling the Indian question ana enabl
ing its vast Territories to be safely inhabited and
deveiopeo. Ttie completion ot this line would, it
Iv claimed, enable the government to move troops
cheaply and rapidlr, dispense with probably three
lourtns ot those now employed in Texas and the
Somhern Territories, snd thua release tne govern
ment irom an expenditure amounting to millions
oi dollars yearly, snd it wonld, moreover,
be oi lmmen*e advantage to the nation
by bringing into the market hundreds of
millions of acres of good land which are now
dead property to the United States by adding
millions or poi>niatioii to the present number of
producer* and taxpayer* of the country, by more
than doubling r indeed indefinitely lnci easing
the annual >leld of the precious metals In the
; United State*, uy a vast increase in our revenues
' to be derived irom Importations irom Asiatic
! countries, by the general stimulus of production,
! mauufacrnres and"trade in all the fctates east of
I the Mississippi, to supply the wan^aoi settler* In

[ Austria, have s^entsucn enormous sums oi money,
I pleilgea wltnoui stmt their public credit and lound
1 their reward in the control of the commerce
i and trade 01 the world, it is lnrther argued
1 that the construction of this oi?en blgb
' way, unobstructed by *now daring tne
! entire year, across the continent would
prove to be a practical measure 01 reconstruction
1 lor tue South, and that an Increased yield ol cot
ton and tobacco from the newly developed terri
tory would swell the volume of oar exports, and
tbus aid materially in tne retention of our gold
and stiver for home circulation, 'ihe memorial
ists assert that it is conclusively established tuat
the saving in transportation atone of government
supplies uas averaged Si,ooo per mile per annum lor
everr mile of the Pacific Kallroad heretofore built,
and cull attention to the fact that the entire amount
or the mterest which the government is asked to
I guarantee in order to secure the con*traction of
, this southern line is $1,760 per mile per annum. No
! guarantee of the principal ot the oondB Is solic
ited, and as security lor toe guarantee oi the Inter
est on tbe bonds, the government is to have a
first mortgage on au the property, lrahchtse and
net earnings of the railroad, the entire proceeds
I of the sales of lands heretofore granted
by the United States to tbe two companies, a re
storation to the government of about 30,000,000
acres heretofore granted and reserved to aid the
coustruction of the two Hues to the Pacific, some
1,500 miles of which are to be dispensed with un
der the plan proposed, and tbe retention In tbe
United States Treasury oi one-eighth of all the
bonds Issued, so that they may be Bpld by the gov
ernment 11 at any time during the construction
of the mad the sale of lands, tbe government
transportation and tbe entire net earnings of the
road shall not prove sufficient to provide fbr tbe
interest guaranteed and t(>e sinking mnd reduced.
The memorialist! say, tn conclusion, that they do
not propose to besiege Congress by personal pres
sure and solicitation, but rely confidently on the
merits of the case as now presented.
The Ways and Mean* and th? Senate
Finance Committee* In Harmony.
The Ways and Mean* Committee agreed to ap
point a sub-committee of three to meet with a
Senate finance sub-committee In considering the
financial suggestions made in tbe President's
Message. This Is regarded as a conciliatory act
on the part or the Ways and Means Committee
which has sometimes shown an unamlable re
laotance to aot with the Senate Finance Com
mittee. ? *' *?
? Celebrated Custom* Litigation?The
Yftue or the Franc.
To-day, In tbe Supreme Coon, the case of the
Collector of tbe Port ot Hew York against tbe Im
porters. as to the value of tbe irano, was argued
on appeal from tbe United States Circuit Court of
New York. Under tbe act of 1840 tbe value
of the franc was fixed at eighteen and
one-sixteenth cents, but within two years
tbe Secretary of tbe Treasury was
authorized by act of Congress to fix a new value,
and did fix It at nineteen and three-tenths cents.
This Is resisted, and if the case Is decided for the
contestants, tbe government will have to refund
nearly two millions of dollars. Associate Justice
Clifford, it Is understood, will write tbe decision
of the Conrt. It Is believed that It wlH be adverse
to tbe government.

to Its Jurisdiction la Cases ot Personal
Injnry Arga?d.
In tbe Alabama Claims Court to-day argument
was resumed on case 87, as to the character ot the
damages; oounsel for the government taking the
position that the Court had no jurisdiction In
matters or personal injury by acts resulting from
the capture of Confederate cruisers. General
Roberts spoke-ln opposition. A decision will be
rendered In a few days.
Case 118, involving tbe question of citizenship,
naturalization, Ac., with the cases involving tbe
same points, will De argued to-morrow. It la prob
able that the hearing of cases will commence

King Kaiakaua is expected to arrive in Washing
ton on Saturday. Tbere will be a military turnout

Marine Band was to-day practicing Hawaiian
national airs with wbloh to greet His Majesty,

AMUSEMENTS.
The Lfecan Theatr*.
"ChUperlc," the best of Herv?'s works, fu
pri^tfced last night at this house under the most
testable auspices. There was a crowded and
brilliant audienoe, who enjoyed heartily the
music, which is very superior to what we geaer
ally And in worts of tne same character. "Chll
perlc" is (oil of melodies toat leave a lasting lm
presalon. The story is amusing and gives
ample opportunity tor the display of gro
tesque humor, which Is the charm of
ttus class of performance. The reception
It met with last nigut was very favorable and it
cannot fail to prove as attractive as its predeces
sors. Miss Soldene hs Chliperio looked every Inch
a king. She was In excellent voice and gave the
several songs that tell to her with her usual dasti
and spirit, kiss L. Robson, who took the part of
Ualsumda, promises to become a lavorlte with the
public. Already she ha* made quite remarkable
progress in the good graces ot the audience?a
progress due wholly to the excellence of her
singing. Last nlgut she was twice recalled. Her
voice Is sweet and sympathetic, and she sings
with much looting. Miss Lyudhurst as Fredegonde
and Mr. Laurent as Landry also made a favorable
impression. The work la pretty well divided, aud
as the melodies are thickly distributed ami the
ohoruses are good, there Is atways something
agreeable turning up which lenders it impossible
for the audience not to be pleaaed. The appoint
ments are remarkably rich; some or tne tabieaus
are gorgeous color pictures. "ChUperlc" will keep
the boards till further notice.
THE SHAUQHBAUH.
To tu Editor or the Herald:?
Your tribute on Wednesday to lir. Bouclcaulfs
talent and recognition of his recent and wonder
ful success Is nothing but what is justly due, and I
desire, though In no Bense connected with theatri
cal matters, to supplement it by a word for ono
who largely contributes to this success. In the
new play oi the "Bhaugliraun" every artist i
does his and her work well. There
are some little incongruities, as, tor ]
instance, one wonders how so portly and ponder,
ous a gentleman as Air. Folk can be carried ashore
by the dhaughraun, like a baby in arms. or the
astonlsuing equanimity with whlcn he learns of
tne loss of hl8 wlie and his estate ail at once.
But still the totality Is periect, and hence Its
sucoess. But there is another specific element |
which is strikingly operatic?that ot the simple, ,
lady-like refinement of one actress pervading i
every scene in wbirh she appears. Oi course I ;
re.er to Miss Dyas. From the Initiate mllkp&U to
the connubial insignificance at the end It Is the I
expression of ttie same refined intelligence and
charm ol perlectly unaffected manners. The !
flashes of Irrepressible brogue are delicious. In
no disparagement it may be said that no other
artist could do lor Mr. Bouclcault what this lady,
but yesterday a sttantrer to us all, does. 1 do not
presume to say that the play would be "nunght1*
without her, but wltn her It is very winning. Pray
insert this. w.
Y0R1CJL
Am Artistic Crime.
To thb Epitob op thi Hkrald
I find myself in a very difficult position toward
Mr. Augustln Daly, i rave turn, early lu November,
the piece "Un Drama Nuevo" ably translated into
English, In order tbat he would produce it on the
Kew York stage, under certain private conditions.
He did not lose time, and the first periormance
took place Satordav last. He has done his best
for Its success, but, unfortunately, ho has spoiled
the piece in such a manner tbat his interest and
the good reputation of tbe autbor will be damaged.
When I put ibe piece into bis hands I courteously 1
stated that he could make any changes he deemed t
advisable, though I believed that as it was It '
would answer the purpose. The changes I re
leired to were cbanges merely of aetail, con
sisting principally In tbe stage arrangement;
but I did not Imagine tbat Mr. Daly or an>body
else would undertake to mutilate tbe original
drama so as to leave It unrecognizable.
Mo great American writer would have consid
ered himself authorized, under any consideration
whatever, to change a line of a production of
Tamays y Bans.
1 am well aware tbat Mr. Daly considered the
changes be made necessary to please the Ameri
can public. But bis good wishes oann?t tree blm
irom tbe responsibility of having destroyed in
cold blood a masterpiece of the present day's
stage.
ltespect for the works or genius, either writing,
painting, sculpture or music, has always been tbe
characteristic seal of enlightened people. On
Saturday last I witnessed tbe performance of
??Yorlck," and was sadly disappointed when I
saw the cbanges mniu iu it. These cbanges be
gin at the begiuning and ena at tbe end of tbe
! piece. The original title is "Un Drama
Nuevo," which, simply translated, Is "a
i New Play." Knowing It very well, I could
; remark the mutilations and will point out some of 1
I them irom memory. In tbe first act a new charao
I ter has been introduced?Margery?which Is of no
use and produces no effect. Unnecessary addi
tions have been made at the beginning. Yorlck,
Instead of entering with Shakespeare, as In the
original play, enters alone and calls Shakespeare
In alter having a conversation with the servant
and the prompter, introduced in that part by Mr. !
Daly or bis auapcer. The dialogue between Yorlck I
and Shakespeare is shortened, cbanged and spoiled.
Tbe dialogue between Edmund and Alice has I
been also cbanged to great disadvantage.and also I
that between Shakespeare and Alice. Even the
name ot this lady bas been ridiculously substi
tuted by Alison, and the dosing words of tbe act,
which ought to oe spoken suddenly and after
Yorick has approached his wife without being ob- !
served, were, on the contrary, pronounced irom |
Inside in a loud voice, while running to meet bis
wire, by which the great effect intended was de- I
strayed.
In tbe second act Walton's monologue has been 1
mutilated, as well as mat oetween Alice and
Yorlok, and the beautiful situation of the original 1
play, consisting in Yorlck's Jealousy ol Shakes- |
peare. Is suppressed, and substituted by some- i
thing which is unintelligible. According to my I
recollection all the end ol the second act was
changed.
In the third aot and first scene tbe character of i
the prompter, upon whom some or tbe affect or 1
the very same act depends, was omitted. The
conversation between Alice, the author, the '
stage prompter, Shakespeare and the actors were
also changed and their merit much marred by
Injudicious additions.
But tbe most horrid massacre was that of the
second scene of the last act. In order to explain
it it will be necessary to tell wuat Is tbe Idea de
veloped by the autbor. This great classical
writer, wishing to prove that he was able to write
a sensational modern piece, producod "Un Drama
Nuevo" with tbe only particular object of creating
in tne audience an unequalled excitement. It is
considered almost impossible to find anything
new and striking in dramatlo situations.
Tamays y Bans found something striking
ana uew. He purposed to present to the
public a troupe of actors preoarlng a performance,
and at last playing the play. One of them, terribly
jealous or his wife, bas tbe part of a lealous hus
band. In tbe middle of the performance, throngb
tbe act or a traitor, he finds tbe proor ot his wile's
guilt and kills her lover. Tbe traitor at the same
time is killed in tbe street on leaving tbe theatre.
Tne first part ot the last act occurs bebind the
scenes. Tbe stage and the public art supposed to
be inside. Tbe second part occurs on tbe
stage and represents the pleoe. The imaginary
stage is supposed to be in the place of the real
stage and tne imaginary public to occnpy the place
or the real public. When the actor kills his wiie's
lover the prompter, the manager and so on invade
the stage, and the manager, who Is Shakespeare,
tells then, to (he public, tuat the play cannot be
oominuea on account of the crime Just com
mitted. The Illusion then Is complete. Tbe du
sllty so admirably maintained produced a great
excitement and a moral lesson also, since the vic
tims are the guilty.
Mr. Daly has not seized the meaning of the
piece. This is a comedy with a dramatic end.
The domestic life of a troupe of poor actors re
quires tbe natural language of real life, Mr. Daly
bas cnanged the "you"ol tbe translation by the, in
this instance ridiculous, "thou." Such a change 1s
the more injudicious, because the actors ought to
speax in a different mann?r when talking
among themselves than when playing tne play. Tbe
action must at the same time be rapid, and
the situation natural. The killing achieved, tba
piece should immedlatelv end. Mr. Daly, instead
or this, writes a protracted dialogue, kills Yorlck
also, snd presents a shocking and repulsive agony
to tne audience.
Tbe great pivot of the Spanish pleoe Is the
duality ol thestago and tbe public and the sudden
announcement by the manager that the piece
cannot ot* continued. Mr. Daly, not under
standing such duality, supposed that tbe Imaginary
public Is inside, when it is the public in the thea-*
tre. The aotion or tbe situation is diverted, and
tbe manager, Instead of informing tbe real public
of tbe terrible events that have transpired, sustains
tbe dying Yorlck, weeps, and after a display or
sentimentaiism says, almost whispering to the
prompter, "Tell the public what baa happened."
Tbe massacre oi Yorlok is contrary to art, to
Mr. Daly's interest and to mine, aa well as damag
ing to tbe glory of tbe aathur.
Now the pivot of toe piece is precisely tbe dual
ity referred to, and it* principal objeot the enect
of tne words said by Sbakeaocure. The suppres
sion ol ail this part and its substitution by a com
monplace and protracted oeatb makes the play a
true monstrosity.
It >s 41,vays unsale to change any work of Art.
but in dramatic piecosjt l* entirely luadintasU>le
to change the principal ohject of the author. In
"The bcflool lor Mcandal," lor laataoee. tUe pivot
of tbe piece <? tn? scr en scene. What woo d
be said of a theatre manager who wooid substi
tute for it a coaimonnitee situation 1" What
would be said if, in addition to this, he would
change entire** the denouement. Killinit Sir Peter
as Mr. Daly has Killed "Yoriek?" The pivot of
Mobdre'e Tartuffe is the sttaation in whicn the lat
ter character U discoverer bene.'a table, it
would be a real literary crime t >mlt it, and
no w?raa could explain the indignation that such
a course would produce. The American public
has. In the present case, a rtpiit to b3 served with
a venom* dram, tic in sterpiece, and not witta a
conmereited one, as "Yoriclc."
For all these reasons 1 appeal to tbe press, in
order that puallc opinion may exact (ruin Mr. Daijr
tbe production of tue plav us u is in tbe Spanish.

TUB EARLY BTKUUULSd OP EZRA CORNELL.
Prom all this It will be seen that he begun his
career under no very propitious circumstances.
But be came of a good, long, lived and doggedly
persistent stock, and though be failed to attain tne
great age of his father, who was over four score
and ten years when he died, be proved to be the
most dogged and persistent member of the
Cornell family. An illustration of this may
be lound in tbe method he pursued In
obtaining that meagre educatlou to which
allusion baa already been made. While Ma father
was residing in Westchester It was not possible
that be ahould acquire a very large stock of tnior
matlon or a very generons mental training at tbe
village school. At De Ruyter his opportunities
were even more limited, though being older he
was then better able to profit by them. When be
was elgthteen years old. however, he determined
to carve out an opportunity lor himself, ana this
he did in a way mat the boys of the present
generation would hardly dare to under
take. In conjunction with a younger
brother be agreed with Colonel T. 0. Nye.
tbe village pedagogue, that ther would -'clear''
lour acres oi beach and maoie timber lor three
months' schooling. This task they accompllahea
out of acnool hours, between the 16th ot March
and the 16th of M?y, 1825. and tbe veritable his
torians of Mr. Cornell's early struggles lniorm us
tnat "iour acres of good corn was raised on the
ground that season. It having been chopped,
burned, logged, cleared, fenced and planted in
ttiat time." Though it Is Impossible to toll, owing
to the singularities ol tbe grammar In this biaiory,
whether it waa tbe coru, the ground or the season
mat was "chopped, burned, logged, cleared,
fraced and planted," yet the fact itself la exceed
ingly complimentary to Mr. Cornell.
FOURTEEN YEARS OF BUSINESS ENTERPRISE.
As aoon as be leit the De Ruyter school Ezra
Cornell began to show strong evidences of me
chanical genius. It Is said of him that at that
tune his lather had engaged a carpenter to build
a shop and that young Ezra was put to work to
asBist him. Closely observing the movements of
tne "boss," by whom the work was laid out, he
completely mastered the mysteries of tne "square
rule" the first day, and beiore tne second day
was over pointed out an error In the work
ol tbe master carpenter. The "boss" was very
augry, but upon investigation it was round that
hzra was right. Tne next season yonng Cornell
built a large two-storied house without a?siatauce.
lie iramed the building by "square rule," and
though part of tbo timber was in tbe woods and
part on tbe spot where it was to be used, it came
together without an error, and was pronouueed
one of tbe best pieoes of work in the village.
It was with such a web-louuded reputa
tion as a buliaer that Mr. Cornell begun
business in Ituaca. His first work at the
latter place was to repair a mill, and he
snowed suou remarkable intelligence and skill in
this undertaking that On was oirered charge ot
the milling business. Be was thus engaged from
1330 to 1840. Daring tbe time he was In the mill
ing business he built a large flouring mill, wlttr
elght ruu of stones, and this he accomplished with
such complete success that the mill waa regarded
as the best ever erected in Tompkins county, in
1840 ne turned his attention to (arming,
and tbongn afterward engaging in
other enterprises ne' never gave up his
agricultural pursuits. He Waa especially proud In
subsequent vears of his stock of thoroughbred
cattle, and he often took the county premium for
crops or one hundred bushels or more ol shelled
corn to the acre. It will thus be seen tnat in the
lourteen years of Mr. Cornell's early business
struggles lie laid the foundation of that ipieuuia
fortune which, later In life, enabled htm to beoome
the patron oi tne mechanic and industrial arts
and of learning.
MR. CORNELL AS A TELEGRAPH PIONEER.
In 1843 Mr. Cornell became acquainted with F.
O. J."Smith, well known as a telegraph manager,
and about the same time with Professor Morse,
inventor of the magnetic telegraph. Almost acci
nentaliy at first be became interested in what was
tnen a doubtml and untried project, but out of
which, aided by hi* enterprise and skill, he was
soon able to reap a fortune. About this time
Congress appropriated $30,000 for the construction
of the experimental line between Washington
and Baltimore, and he was appointed by
J. c. Speucer, then Secretary of the Treasury,
As assistant superintendent of the telegraph. Mr.
Cornell bad already shown great ability in the
preliminary experiments, and had invented a
tube to overcome tne difficulties of insulation
wherever it waa necessary to submerge the wire,
and it was to this he owed his appointment.
Though his invention had been pronounced a suc
cess, it was soon afterward fonnd to be impractic
able, and in it* nlace he suggested mounting the
wires on poles, which became tbe nniversai prao
tice. At the time tbe line waa completed,
in May, 1844, the Whig National Convention
was in session in Baltimore and Mr. Cornell an
nounced tbe nomination ol Henry Clay for Presi
dent to tbe astonished people of Washington al
most simultaneously with its announcement in
the Convention. A month later be repeated tbe
icat upon the nomination of James K. Polk by tbe
Democratic convention. The working of tbe Use,
however, was not lound to be Batlsiactory. Tne
Morse instruments then in use were in
sufficient In power lor telegraphing long
distances, and Mr. Cornell's friends claim
that to him waa due tbe credit of
remedying these defects, Tnere are many claim
ants to this distinction, among them Henry
O'Reilly, whose services were scarcely less emln.
ent than those of either Professor Morse or Mr.
Cornea, but wbo reaped neither the bonors nor
the wealth which came to the others. Tbe bistory
of the magnetic telegraph has in it much of ro,
mance, and m romantic leatures acquire a new
interest now that the pioneers of this new aid
to civilization are rapidly paaalng away.
THE TELEGRAPH BUILDEK.
In 1846, when the Une was extended to Philadel
phia and New York, Mr. Cornell was intrusted
with Its construction ana tbe next year be built a
line from this city to Alban/. In 1847 be con*
BtructeJ the line from Troy to Montreal and from
Buffalo to Milwaukee. He made money at tbls
work, and, having great faith in the success ot tbe
telegraph, he invested largely In its stock and so
grew very rlon by becoming what the profaner
language of the day would call a member of the
telegraph "ring." For Borne years Mr. Cornell
was President of the American Telegraph Com
pany, and only gave up bis active Interest in the
management of tbe lines within a few years.
MR. COBNELL IN TUB LBOISLATUBB.
Mr. Cornell waa a whig in politics, and adhered
to that party till the organization of the republi
can party in I860. He was too busy with bis dlf
lerent enterprises, however, to take much active
interest in political affairs in the earlier part of
his life, but after his fortune bad been made and
be was no louger occupied in amassing
wealth in the management or great enterpriaes,
he agreed to represent his friends and neighbors
in the Legislature. In 1863 and 1804 he waa a
member of the Assembly, and he was elected a
Btate Senator in the latter year, serving two rail
terms in that body. This was his entire puolio
career; but he performed his public duties like
bis private amirs?honestly, intelligently and
efficiently?and won the regard of all with whom
be came in contact, being well known all over
the state beiore bia great aotot tne endowment of
tne Cornell University at Itnaca.
TUB CORNELL UNIVERSITY.
The crowning glory of Mr. Cornell's life Is tbe
university which beara his name. Through his
endeavors tbe institution obtained from tne State
lta proportion ol the public lands devoted by tbe
general government to tne branding or agricultu
ral colleges throughout the Union, to whleh be
added a munificent gift of 1700,000, and alao took
upon his own shoulders tbe location and sale or
the agricultural land scrip with sucb success that
the ultimate endowment from tbls source will
probably reach $3,000,000. The university
grounds embrace over 200 acrcs overlooking
Cavuga Lake. MagulOcent buildings have been
erected, and the cabinets and museums, the
library and the lecture and reading rooms, are
splendidly equipped. In tbe library are the col
lection or tbe late Cnarles Antbon relating to
ancient languages and literature, the f.latorical
collection presented by Proiessor Uoidwln smith,
the collection 01 the late Jared HparkH relating to
American history, the mathematical oollectlon
presented by William Kelly, ol Khinebeck,
and tlie collections knowu as the White and
the Cornell agrioultural libraries. 'i'nia is
only a snccunen 01 the equipment of
tne young university, wntch with its magnificent
income must take a leading oiace among Anter
lean institutions of learning. Within some two or
three yearn some doubts arose as to Mr. Cornelia
management ol the agricultural college land scrip
and an luventigation wan ordered by trie Legisla
ture, but It lias not showu, as had neen charged,
mat Mr. Cornell was privately profiting througn
toe gut of the government.

tory ot a Thief Fifteen Yean Old.
Philadelphia, Doc. 0. 1874.
For some time past tbe police authorities of this
city bare been troubled with a series of complaints
ot petty theits, burglaries and the like, tbe perpe
trators of which have carefully avoided all de
tection. Houses would be robbed And no one ar
rested. Rooms would be entered, clothing, Jew
elry and silverware bo stolen, and no one
arraigned. Indeed, tbe theits would occur
so oiten and under such a strange
complexity of circumstances, that, for a
long time past, the authorities have been
entirely baffled. Last evening, however, a young
boy, John Webster by name, entered a pawn
broker's sbop In tbe city, and, upon presentation of
a letter purporting to have been written by his
lather, secured an advance of $30 upon a gold
watch and chaui, with Masonio seal attached.
The character of the letter was so peculiar tuat It
aionsed somewhat the pawnbroker's suspicions,
walch were confirmed when, alter watching
the lad, he saw him dividing the money
with a companion. Webster was arrested,
aud on his person was found $19 96.
Upon subsequent investigation it was learned
that the other party was the thief and tnat Web
ster bad been simply disposing of the stolen prop
erty. Still later, through Webster's talk, three
other juveniles were arrested, In the possession of
wuom were found many stolen goods and pawn
tickets calling lor various amounts. No sooner
had the actual condition or affairs beeD made
known tnan tbe Cbiei of the Police ordered Inves
tigations to be continued, while Webster himself
gives to your correspondent tbe following remark

quite a uiscipie to the "tender passion," and says
that If "they'll only let nim go" he'll lead a
