Washington, I me. 7. —Abandoning his
Intention to deliver Ids message to
congress In person, President Wilson
sent it In and the clerks of both houses
read It. Following is the full text of
the message:
Gentlemen of the congress:
When I addressed myself to per
forming the duty laid upon the Presi
dent by the Constitution to present to
•fyou an annual report of the slate of
"the Union, I found my thought domi
nated by an immortal sentenee of
Abraham Lincoln’s, “Let us have
faith that right makes might, and. In
that faith let us dare to do our duty
as we understand Ita sentence Im
mortal because It embodies In a form of
utter simplicity and purity the essen
tial faith of the nation, the faith In
which It was conceived, and the faith
In which It has grown to glory and
power.
With that faith and tin* birth of a
nation'founded upon it came the hope
into the world that anew order would
prevail throughout the affairs of man
kind, an order In which reason and
right would take precedence' of covet
ousness anil force, and I believe that
I express the wish and purpose of ev
ery thoughtful American when I say
that this sentence marks for us in tin*
plainest manner the part we should
play alike in the arrangement of our
domestic affairs and Id our exercise
of Influence upon the affairs of the
world. I’.y this faith, and by tills faith
alone, can the world be lifted out of
Its present confusion and despair. It
was this faith vnilch prevailed over
the wicked force of Germany. You
will remember that the beginning of
the end of the war came when the
German people found themselves face
to face with the conscience of the
world, and realized that right was ev
erywhere arrayed against ihe wrong
that their government was attempting
to perpetrate. 1 think, therefore that
It Is true to say that this was the
faith which won the war. Certainly
this Is the faith with which our gal
lant men went into He Held and out
upon the s"as to make sure of victory
This Is Hip mission upon which de
mocracy mine Into Ihc world, nomoc
racy Is nn assertion < f the right of the
Individual to live and to he treated
justly ns against any attempt on the
part of any combination of Individuals
to make laws which will overburden
him or which will destroy his equality
among his fellows In the matter of
right or privilege, and I think we all
realize that the day has come when
democracy Is being put upon Its final
test. The old world Is Just now saf ■
ferlng from a wanton rejection of the
principle of democracy and n substitu
tion of the principle of autocracy ns
asserted In the name hut without the
authority and sanction of the multi
tude. This |s the time of nil others
when democracy should prove Its puri
ty and it'- spiritual power to prevail.
Tl is surely the manifest destiny of the
Tailed States to lead In the attempt to
make (Ids spirit prevail.
Two Things for Us to Do.
There are two ways In which the
United States can as'-i-t to aeeoni|i||sli
this print object, first, hj olTerint!
the example within her own borders of
tlie will power of democracy to make
iiud enfone laws which are nnques
tionahly Inst and which are equal in
their administration laws which se
cure 1U full rigid to labor and yet at
the same time safeguard (lit* integrity
of property, and particularly of that
property which Is devoted to (he ,|o
velopmcnt of Industry and the In
crease of the necessary wealth of tho
world. Second, by standing for right
and Justice tis towards Individual na
tions. The law of democracy Is for
the protection of the weak and the In
flnence of cm-A democracy in the
world should he for the protection of
the weak nation, the nation which Is
struggling toward Its right and to
ward Its proper recognition and priv
ilege in the family of nations
The United States cannot refuse
this role of champion wjthout patting
the stigma of rejection upon the great
and devoted men who brought Its gov
eminent Into existence and established
It In the face of almost universal op
position and Intrigue, even In face
of wanton force, as. for example,
against the order In conned of (Jrent
Itrltuin and tho arbitrary Napolionlc

Sample Democracy of World.
I urge you to consider that the <1 s
plny of an Immediate disposition on
the part of congress to remedy any In
justices or evils that may have shown
themselves In our national life will
afford the most effectual offset *o the
forces of chaos and tyranny which are
playing so disastrous n part la the
fortunes of the free peoples of more
than one part of the world. The
United Stales Is of necessity the sam
ple democracy of the world, and the
triumph of democracy depends upon
Its success.
Recovery from the disturbing and
sometimes disastrous effects of the
late war has been exceedingly slow on
the other side of the water, and has
given promise, 1 venture to say, of
early completion only In our own for
tunate country; but even with us the
recovery halts and Is Impeded at times,
and there are Immediate serviceable
acts of legislation which. It seems to
me. we ought to attempt to assist that
recovery and prove the Indestructible
recuperative force of a great govern
ment of the people. One of these Is
to prove that a great democracy can
keep hope as successfully and In as
business-like a fashion ns any other
government. It seems to me that the
llrst step toward proving this Is to
supply ourselves with a method of
handling our estimates and expendi
tures, and bringing them to the point
whore they will not be nn ujineeeasnry
strain upon our Income or necessitate
unreasonable taxation; tn other words
n workable budget system, and I sug
gest that two elements are essential
to such a system—namely, not only
that the proposal of appropriations
should he In the hands of a single
body, such as a single appropriations
committee In each house of the con
gress, but also that tills body should
be brought Into such co-opemtlnn with
the departments of the government
and with the treasury of the t'nlted
States ns would enable It to act upon
a complete conspectus of the needs of
the government and the resources from
which It must drew Its Income.
f reluctantly vetoed the budget hill
passed by the last session of the con
gress because of a constitutional obic
-t lon. Tho house of representatives
subsequently modified the hill In order
to meet tlds objection. In the revised
form 1 believe that the hill, coupled
with action already taken by the con
gress to revise Its rules and procedure,
furnishes the foundations for an effec
tive national budget system. 1 ear
nestly hope, therefore, that one of the
llrst steps taken by the present session
of the congress will be to pass the
budget bill.
Marked Gain In Finances.
The nation's finances have shown
marked Improvement during the putil
year. The total ordinary receipts of
$6,694,000,000 for the fiscal year 1920
exceeded those for 1919 by $1,542,000.-
000, while the total net ordinary ex
penditures decreased from $18,514,000.-
! (too to $0,403,000,000. The gross public
1 debt, which reached Its highest point
I on Aug. 31, 1019. when It was $26,600 -
i 000,000, had dropped on Nov. 30. 1020,
i to $24,175,000,000. There also has been
i a marked decrease In holdings of gov
ernment war securities by the banking
| Institutions of the country, as well as
| llii> amount of hills held by the federal
reserve banks secured by government
j war obligations.
Tills fortunate result tas relieved
1 the banks and left them freer to finance
the needs of agriculture, Industry and
commerce. It lias >■>■<i due In large
part to the reduction of the public
debt, especially of the floating debt,
but more particularly to the Improved
distribution of government securities
among permanent Investors, The ces
sation of tiie government's borrowing*
except through short term certificates
of Indebtedness has been a matter of
grent consequence to the people of the
country at Jarge, as well ns to the
holders of liberty bonds and Victory
notes, and has had an Important bear
ing on the matter of effective credit
control
The year has been characterized by the
progressive withdrawal of the treasury
from the domestic credit market and
from a position of dominant Influence In
that market. The future course will nec
essarily depend upon the extent to which
economies are practiced and upon the
burdens placed upon the treasury, as well
ns upon Industrial development and the
maintenance of lax receipts at a suf
ficiently high level.
Big Bond Issue to Mature.
The fundamental fact which at present
dominate* the government’s llnamlal sit
uation is that IT.fiflO.OtlO.due of Its war In
debtedness matures within the next two
and a half years. Of this amount 12,6(10,-
(01,1(1X1 are (leating debt and fa.000.000.0u0
vli lory notes and war savings cerltMcales
The fiscal program of the government
must lie determined witli reference to
these maturities. Hound policy demands
that the government expenditures lie re
duced to the lowest amount which will
permit the various services to operate
efficiently and that government receipts
from luxes and salvage tie maintained
sufficiently high to provide for current
requirements, Including Interest and sink
ing fund charges on the public debt, and
at tin- same time retire the floating debt
and part of the victory loan before ma
turity
With rigid economy, vigorous salvage
opera Hons and adequate revenues from
taxation, a surplus of current rw -Ipls
over current expenditures ran tie reaPzcd
and should he applied to the Moating debt
All branches of the government should
co-operate to see that tlds program Is
realised
I cannot overemphasise the necessl y
cf economy In government appropriations
and expenditures and the avoidance |y
(lie congress of practices which take
money from the treasury by Indefinite 1 r
revolving-fund appropriations The estl
males for the present year show that
over a billion dollars of expenditures wen,
authorized by the Inst congress In add!

compiled statement of appropriations.

tance of making direct und v*'-Uic “P'
proprlations. The relation between in*
current receipts and current expenditure?,
of the government during the present fla
cal year, as well as during the last half
of the Inst fiscal year, lias been disturbed
by the extraordinary burdens thrown
upon the treasury by the transportation
act, in conn#*' tion with the return of the
railroads to private control. Over $llOO.-
000.000 has already been paid to the rail
roads under this act— l3l,ooo, (WO 'luring
the present fiscal year-and 111 estimated
that further payments aggregating pos
sibly 000,000 must still he made to the
railroads during the current year. It Is
obvious that these large payments have
already seriously limited the government's
progress In retiring the floating debt.
Closely connected with this. It seems to
me. Is the necessity for an Immediate
consideration of the revision of our lax
laws. Simplification of the Income and
; profits taxes has become an Immediate
! necessity. These taxes performed an in-
I dispensable service during the war. The
! need for their simplification, however, Is
very great In order to save the taxpayer
Inconvenience and expense and In order
to make Ids liability more certain and
definite Ollier and more detailed recom
mendations with regard to taxes will no
doubt be laid before y iu by the secretary
of tbe treasury and the < ommtssloner of

Would Aid War Heroes.
Tt ts my privilege to draw to tho sften
i ilon of congress for every sympathetic
| consideration tho problem of providing
adequate facilities for the rare and treat
ment of former members of the military
and naval forces who are sick or disabled
as the result of their participation In the
war. These heroic men can never he paid
In money for the service they patrioti
cally rendered the nation. Their reward

that they vindicated the rights of their
country and aided In safeguarding civili
zation. The nation’s gial tude must ho
effectively revealed to them hy the most
ample provision for their medical care
and treatment as well as for their voca
tional training and placement.
The lime has come when a more com
plete program can ho formulated and
more satisfactorily administered for
their treatment and training, and I earn
estly urge that the congress give the
matter Its early consideration. The sec
retary of the treasury and the hoard for
vo ational education will outline In their
annual reports proposals covering medi
cal care and rehabilitation which I am
I ; ore will engage your earnest study and
I command your most generous support,
l Permit me to emphasize once more
lhe need for action upon certain matters
upon which 1 dwelt at some length In
my message to the second session of tho
With congress: The necessity, for exam
ple, of encouraging the manufacture of
dyestuffs and related chemicals; the im
portance of doing everything possible to
promote agricultural production along
economic lines, to Improve agricultural
marketing and to make rural life more
attractive and healthful; the need for a
liw regulailng cold storage in such a way
as to limit the time during which goods
may be, kept In storage, prescribing tho
method of disposing of them If kept be
yond tho permitted period, and requiring
goods released from storage In all cases
to hear the date of their receipt.

that the purchaser might be able to

need of the time Is the removal of all

ambitions of our people In their sv

strengthening of all Instrume/italllles

removed and Justice dealt out. wheth

to he my privilege at present to sug
gest the detailed and particular meth
ods by which these objects may be
attained, but I have faith that the In
quiries of your several committees will
discover tho way and the method.
Asks for Loan to Armenia.
In response to what I believe to be
the Impulse of sympathy and opinion
throughout the United States, I ear
nestly suggest that the congress au
thorize the treasury of the United
Stales to make to the struggling gov
ernment of Armenia such a loan as
was made to several of the allied gov
ernments during the war, and I would
also suggest that It would tie desira
ble to provide in the legislation Itself
that the expenditure of the money thus
loaned should he under the supervision
of a commission, or at least a com
missioner, from the United States, In
order that revolutionary tendencies
within Armenia Itself might not be af
forded by the loan a further tempting
opport mlty.
Allow me to call your attention to the
fact that the people of the Philippine

stable government since the last action
of the congress In their behalf and have
thus fulfilled the condition set by the
congress as precedent to a consideration

1 respectfully submit that this condition
prec client having been fulfilled, It Is now
our liberty and our duty to keep our
promise to the people of those Islands by
granting them the Independence which
they so honorably covet.

Foreign Governments Charged by
Rep. Knutson With Sending Radi

Washington, Dec. 13. —An amend
ment to the Johnson immigration bill
limiting the embargo on Immigration
to one year instead of two was adopt
ed by the house, 87 to 23. It was of

Charges that foreign governments
“are financing the movement of radi
cals from several countries in Europe
to the United States," were made by
Representative Knutson (Rep.), Min
nesota, who opened debate in the
house on the Johnson bill.
“Spain is a seething mass of an
archy,” Mr. Knutson declared, “and
Its government is dumping if on the
United Stales. We have more now
than we know what to do with. We
ought to deport them,"
lie added that if tonnage were avail
able from 10,000,000 to 15,000,000 Eu
ropeans would migrate to America
within a year.
