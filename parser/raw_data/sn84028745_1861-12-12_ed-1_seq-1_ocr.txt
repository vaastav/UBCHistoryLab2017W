(City Time.) Fools and Fanatics.
Many persons who think themselves wise
in their day and generation, are in the
hnhit of expending a 'vast amount of la
mentation and indignation over the folly and
fanaticism which exists in the world.
They do not seem to be aware that these
are necessary and beneficial evils ia the
economy of humnn life; that like the poor
they will always be with us to the end of
the world; that they serve as excellent re
minders of th'e fallibility and weakness of
man, and stimulants to intellectual effort
and to the cultivation of the high moral at
tainments of forbearance and generosity.
There is no small quantity of folly and
fanaticism in all the ranks of society, and
in all the departments of life. We see it
every -where, like geological strata, crop
ping out on he surface, through all the val
leys, and along the mountain sides over the
whole earth. .The foolish and fanatical de
votees of conservatism are ao strongly
marked and as dangerous to the welfare of
society as those of radicalism. The only
difference is, that while one extreme prevails
in certain localities, its opposite dominates
in others, and that while the evils of con
servative fanaticism are already aboat and
around us, those of radicalism are in the
future and less fully- understood, which, is,
the cause why many timid and cautious
minds prefer to bear the ills that already
exist rajher than fly to others of .which
they know nothing.
The power of the malignant spirit of evil,
whoi delights to use as his instruments the
whole race of fnpatics and dunces, from the
lowest to the highest walks in life, is al
ways visible, though sometimes his presence
is irore' strongly manifested than at others.
We trace his footsteps, sometimes covering
the sncred precincts of the household into a
pandemonium, and ever we see him stalk
ing through the forum, around the altar,
in the senate house, and seeking admission
.into every high place of power.
'- jBut folly and fanaticism are a part of the
'inevitable trials, temptations, and calami-
r ties incident to human (ifo. They are the
peculiar trials of tbc social organization,
consciously and inevitably to be combatted,
as are selfishness, avarioe, revenge, pride,
and the host of other passions with which
human life is compelled to struggle. Within
prescribed limits they are useful and even
desirable. As a man who passes through
life without any occasion .for effort,-with
no care, no anxiety, or toil, no passions to
conquer, and no toes to encounter, beoomes
an enervated, indolent, and useless member
of rociety, so thnt' Social," political or re
ligiuus organization, which has no foes
both within and without to struggle with
becomes comparatively stagnant and worth
less. Difficulties and obstacles and labo
rious toil are -needed to develop the strength
and power of manhood, to sharpen the
intellect, to give farce of character, vitality
of body, and, above all,' a .true sense of the
relation in whioh nan stands id his Crea
tor. 'Just so in our communal organiza
tionsif there were no discords, J no coiw
tentions, no, necessity for untiring vigil
ance and earnest, effort, the great laws of
progress and development would never be
worked out, and society would be but a
dead sea of stagnant waters and a land
of arid deserts, instead of a .soil teeming
with life and fertility, and an ocean puri
fying itself by the ever-rolling force-of its
waves, and facilitating the intercourse and
the advancement of' nations. Althujib,
then, within a limited sphere,1 and tofne'in-'
dividuals upon whom these offenses, 'which
must needs come, chaqooJo fall, folly and
fanaticism work evil, yet they are necessary
elements .jin tb, e great problem of human
existence, and teach t the world lessons
which eoutd not otherwise be, learned,
'in religion, the folly and, . fanatioism
which leads to the most melanohotjr f gtil
bit ions of superstition and bigotry ts n
worse than that which contends fo Deism)
and Atheism or Pantheism. t ji ,n ,
, In politios, those who struggle for the,
everlasting domination pf privileged bijSptfl
. aud contend that the hereditary 'bondage
of slaves and races , is foreordained and1
blessed of God, are in no wise less fools and
fsnatiot than( the agrarain and h. who
i wouW cxaUiguorance and peweefy and putt
down refinement and weitUh to a degraded
level.
In the business world the everlasting
croaker is as great a fnnntio as the most
wild and desperate speculator, and the
miser is no more eulpable than ths spend
thrift. In social life the devotee of fashion,
frivolity and etiquette, is not a greater fool
than the eccentrio contemner of all forms
aiid custotas, who has not a decent respect
for I he opinions and the customs of his fol
low men.
We must he prepared at all times to con
tend against these enemies of the well be
ing of society, and must never look for or
expect their eradication or extermination'
But they are powerless for evil, when wo
watch well their developemcnt and expose
them to the sunlight of truth. They may
annoy and perplex, but can not materially
injure a watchful and intelligent people.1

WASHINGTON, December 9, 1861.
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS.
At this evening's caucus of the Republican
members of the House; Mr Bingbam intro
duced a resolution that it was the duty of
Congress to pass forthwith an act coofnct
intr all the property of rebels, and of their
aiders and abettors lands, slaves and every
thing. Ho tupported this proposition in a
speech of great force. , .
1'had. Stevens followed in his best vein,
maintaining the policy of the resolution, and
in the course of bis remarks declared that
altlicuph he had long been estranged politi
cally fiom "Secretary Cameron, be must ac
knowledge that be was the only member of
this Administration who bad evinced aoy
correct notions about tbe true method of
proFf cuting the war, and bringing it to a
speedy and successful clore. He g'art'ed the
caucus by declaring that after Mr. Cameron's
report had been accepted by tbe President,
General McClellan went to him and threat
ened to resign if it was sent into Congress
wi'h the passage respecting the emancipa
tion and arming of the slaves of rebels un
niodifnd. Mr. Diven, of New York, first fell into ob
jection, but the full ten minute speeches,
fiery and determined, of Judge Kelly, Messrs.
Lane of Kansas, Morris, Davis, Asbiey; Con
way, and others, effaced the trilling impres
sion his opposition made, and gave the
comforting assurance that there was virtue
and courage enough in tbe House of Repre
sentatives to save tbe war and save the
country. The caucus adjourned the debate on
the resolutions to
BALLOON RECONNOISSANCE.
Yesterday a protracted balloon reconnois
sance was made from the river opposite Gen
eral Hooker's bead-quarters. Wtjila the
balloon was up tbe rebel batteries fired at it
witn shell, many ot wnicn burst directly un
der it, though none within less tbaa two
hundred feet. As the shells exploded tbe
occupant of the car defiantly wared the
American flag.

MODIFICATION.
Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania, has modified
bis resolutions in several important particu--iarfi,
namely, declaring there can be no solid
and permanent Union so lonp- as sUverv ex

A general order has been issued bv Gen

officers the necessity of exercising more care
than heretofore in regard td the class of men

' On Tuesday night last the rebels sallied
out of the wuods some seven or eight miles
above !, Komrey, Western Virginia, and
captuied some wagon-trains, killing' two
men and wounding several others. They
burned one cr two ot the wagons, 'and started

SUNDAY IN THE CAMPS.
Conscientious chaplains have evidently an
unpleasant time of it in the administration
of their pa&toral labors. I visited the camps

dertccs that the Sabbath was observed at all.
A short religious exercise was observed in
sc me ef the regiments, bnt even these had
but slim audience. Generally, the men
were bustl engaged in putting up lo cabins,
and were as industriously employed as on
any pitvious week-day since they com
menced the erection of their log houses. If
the different regiments follow the example
already Bet in some camps, and erect loz
chapels, it would give-tbe chaplains some
convenience to assemble a congregation, but
now they have no place for worsbipr-and as
the severity of thij weather prevents them
from calling the men together in tbe open
air. it is next to impossible- for chaplains to
call any number of hearers together for the
purpose -of religious worship-. - Officers of
tbe regiments should encourage the erection
of tui table log chapels, to be used during the
severe weaiuer.

A Patriotic LAox-vChe following extract
from a private letter, written by a lady in
Henniker, N. U, breathes the spirit of true
patriotism:
I could uot possibly accept your kind in
vitation to- spend Thanksgiving with you,
for several reasons; but, first of all, because
1 had five pairs of soldiers' drawers to make
in three days, a pair of mittens to finish by
a nnrsoay nignt, ana nve pairs more oi araw
ers to be done in tbe shortest time possible.
Indeed, so many and so urgent are the calls
for giving and doing, tnat it seems wrong to
do any thing lor mere personal granneation
Mo one can love friends more than I. or de
pend more on tbem' for blessings, but when
my country lies bleeding at every pore, I
must sacrifice something, or feel that I too
am a traitor. True, all I can do is nut a
drop, but drops make tbe ocean. One soldier
can do bnt little- alone, but where were our
half million without the individual men? If
I can warm the feet and fingers of one brave
soldisr, that soldier may turn the scale in
some great battle, or send tbe "leaden hall"
through the brain of some arch rebel. I feel
that I am Individually responsible for all I
can do, and i dare not throw ol tntsrespousi
bility. Our missionaries, too, are suffering,
and Door Ireland standi on lbs threshold 01

Mr. Gurley's Bill.
Tbe bill which Mr. Gurley, of Ohio, intro
duced into the House ot Representatives yss
terday embraces some of tbe most important
measures ever brought before Congress. It
Is drawn with remarkable precision, clear
cess and force, and is certaiuly as well cat-
ciliated as any legislative measure can be to
ellect the end in view. What that end is
will be beBt understood by the following syn
opsis of the bill. Section first provides for
the confiscation of all the property real and
personal of alt persons engaged in or aiding
or abetting tbe present rebellion. Section
second makes it the duty of the President to
appoint In each State where, by reason of
the rebellion, tbe law can not be executed
through the ordinary process, aCommissioncr
to carry it into effect, and in order to insure
the services of competent and trustworthy
men, tbe salary of the Commissioner is fixed
at $5,000 per annum.
Sections three, four and five provide for the
taking of adequate sureties from theCom
mifsioners, for tbe faithful performance of
their duties, for their severe punishment by
fine and imprisonment, for malversation or
Corrupt conduct, and for tbe appointment of
the necessary deputies, clems ana marshals.
Section six provides that any loyal citizen,
whose property shall be unlaw fully seized and
sold under this act shall have full compensa
tionor restitution. Section seven provides that
an staves ot rebels snail be free, and tnat tbe
Commissioner shall bear and determine the
caces of all who may come before him in a
f ummuiy manner, and if they are entitled to
freedom shall grant them a certificate in the
name of the United States, which shall be
conclusive proof of their lawful liberation.
ocruuu cip;u jiu,mrB luni nil; oiaves bu
liberated may be employed by the Commis
sioner in cultivating the land confiscated by
the United States, and other useful labor,
ttceiving reasonable wages, and that they
may be employed, if the Commissioner con
sents, by tbe commanding officers ot tbe
army, at their discretion, in such service as
may best contribute to the suppression of
the rebellion; ulsn, at reasonable wages, to
be fixed by the Commissioner.
sections nice, ten and eleven provide ttan
it shall be tbe duty of the President, as soon
as mny be practicable, to take military pos
session of Florida, or of such parts as may be
ensiiy occupied ana Oetenuea, ana appoint a
Commissioner for that State, who shall carry
into effect the confiscation and liberation
clauses of tbis act, and sell the estates of the
rebels to loyal purchasers, and who shall
fmrcbase at reasonable prices such slaves of
( jai musters as may bo offered to him, pay
ing for them out of tho confiscated property
of the rebels, and giving them certificates of
freedom.
Tbe President is also authorized, through
tbe Commissioners in other rebel States, to
transport to Florida the slaves of rebels of
other States, and put them in charge of the
Commissioner there, who shall, at his dis
cretion, apprentice them tor such terms.
long or short, nottoexoeed six years, as be
ma; judge best, to loyal proprietor ot land,
who shall pay them reasonable wage?, and
give adequate security for their good treat
ment and proper lodging and sustenance.
On1 t)ie expiration of their times ot appren-ticesbip'-wbicb,
in tbe case of the most
capable and orderly of the negroes, will of
course be short they will become their own
masters, ana at liberty to work for wnorn
tbey please, and .go where they please
within tbe limits of the State of Florida.
It u furibermore provided that F.orida
shall be held and governed by the military
powtr of tbe United States, until -the Presi
dent shall be satudicd that tbe necessity for
military occupation has passed away, when
be shall communicate tbe fact te Congress,
and recommend the erection of a Provisional
Government similar to those ot tbe Territo
ries of the ULiltd States, or if there bu a
sufficient number of loyal white inhabitants
to entitle them to a representative in Con
gress, be shall recommend tbe passage of au
act authorizing them to form a State Gov
eronent and Constitution excluding slavery.
Tbe remaining sections of the bill provide
for tbe disposition of the Confiscation Fund,
which is to be used to. pay the expenses in
curred under this act, and to compensate
loyal creditors of rebels and loyal citizens
whoibave loBt their property by the rebel
Ucd Tbe most novel and important feature of
the bill is that relating to Florida, the effect
of which, if carried out, will be to oreate a
place of refuge for the free blacks of tbe
countiy, all of whom can find congenial
homes in its hot climate and fertile lands,
the extent of which is smply sufficient, with
out being more densely peopled than Jamaica
or Ilayli, to support the whole colored pop
ulation of the United Stales. In Florida,
according to this plan, the liberated slaves
will be beyond tbe reach of molestation from,
their former masters or from oppressive State
laws, while there is nothing in the .bill to
prevent tbe settlement there of whites who
may desire to own cotton, rice or sugar plan
tations, cultivated by, free black Tabor, or
who may wish to reside there for health or
the pursuit of trade or manufactures.
Bishop Simpson on the English and American
Flags.
This eminent divine of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, in sermon preached by
him on last Thanksgiving Day, in Wheeling,
Ya,, made the following eloquent compari
son in order to show the power and glory
of the American flag at home and abroad;
There are two flags in this world that seem
to go every-where, and to be almost anivers-
a'ly learea ana nonorea. une is tne singlisb
ting. , There are some traits of the English
nation that we all dislike bat it is a glorious
o'd nation, and its flag a glorious old Sag.
For years it has been in the advance line of
civilization, ana arc, ana glory every where.
Its glory is partly our own for we are part
of the . same race. Its cannon have been
beard in every port its arms have met in
shock on almost every battle field. That
flag iB on every sea, and it waves over nearly
one half of the missionary enterprise on
earth, and wherever it goes the missionary
is safe. He says, "I am a British subject."
Tbe darkest nations all over the earth fear
to offend the British nation.
i - But there Is another flag, not a thousand
years, old not a hundred years old which
to my eyes is a still more beautiful one. The

I, as Well as others, doubtless, in this audi,

it seems to me as if an angel's hand had clip,

stars of gold, coining down like angel's eyes
of mercy as it goes on its mission of good
will over the earthJt is a glorious flag, and

inquire and report to the Senate what reduction
may be made in tbe expenses of the army.
Agreed to.

On motion of Mr. Hotman, tt was resolved
that the Committee on Public Lands should re
port V) bat railway companies had reoeived do
nations of lands on condition of transporting
troops and munitions of war free of charge,
and whether the Government has the unquali
fied right of such transportation.
Mr Lovejoy offered a resolution instructing
the Committee cn Foreign Affairs to report a
bill establishing diplomatio relations between
tbe Uiited Statta and Hayli and Liberia. The
resolution Ilea over.
Mr. Blair, of Missouri, offered a resolution
d daring it just to recognise tbe eminent and
pattiotic services ef the late General Lyon, and
tendering thettaiiks of Congrats to tbe brave
officer and eolditrs under bis oommand who
sustained the honor of tbe flag and achieved a
victory at Springfield, Mo ; and in order to
commemorate tbe event eaoh regiment engaged
nn that occasion bear on its colors the word
"Sv-rn gCeld," in letters oi gold; and that these
rest luuons be read at the head of the difforent
legiments of the army of tbe ifoi'ed States.
Mr. Blair believed the Government had taken
no notice at all of tbe death of General Lyen,
and hence tbe propriety of ths passage of the
reerlution. Hn knew the man well. One never
lived who eared more for bis country and less
lor binxelf. .
The resolution was adopted.
Mr. Landing's preamble and resolutions,
offered on Monday, came up.
Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania, said if the'
passage of ths resolution Is to have a good
effect, especially in the West, the sooner it is
S asset the better. The allegation of General
lalleck. as an exousefor his order that fugitive
staves, whom ts proposes to exclude from his
lines, give information to the enemy, is tot
bold a pretext to justify htm. The retnm of
fugitive slaves was intended by MoCletlan, and
has been followed by Generals Dix, Kelly and
O'bers. All these cases are a Olxgrace to the
profession of arms. If ruch returns of fugi
tives have been made by orders of the Com
Banding Grnerals, they deserve to have thei
epaulettes stripped from their shouUlan; and if
it baa been done by higher authority, then God
Jorgive tbem, for they know not what they do.
Mr. Lovfjuy, of Illinois, expressed hi hott
est oonvlo ion' that inch orders were iisued by
the Commanding Generals of the army without
order from tbe President. He was satisfied of
this fact, while tbe President doe not remove,
cat bier them, as he (Lovejoy) would. He did
not believe tbat tbey (the Commanding Gen
eials) bad power for suih inhuman and shame
ful measures.
Mr. B'air, cf Missouri, slid tbat Mr. Stevens
bsd evidently nibratiderstoud General Hal leek'
oider. The latter (Qallrck) informed him that
he had no idea of doing any thing contrary to
tbe law of the last Congress aud the policy of
tbe Government.
A debate ensued between Blair and Lovejoy
on the subjeot of General Hallesk's recent or
der about slaves.
Mr. Julian nfeired to the ease of Colonel
Brown, of an Indiana regiment, who refased
to deliver np fugitive nntil to ordered by Sec
retary Cameron. Be presumed the Adminis
tration sanctioned such prbeeedings.
Mr. Kellogi! assumed to ray the Administra
tion had nothing to do witn that order, and
wculd rot indioate' suoh a policy to the army.
Tbe resolution which CAUsed this debits was
tabled 78 to 64.
The resolntim lonklng to' a recognition of
the independence of Haytt and Liberia wS
aoopted, with an amendment that th Commit
tee on Foreign Affairs inquire into ths expedi
ency of doing to .
The anbjeot of abolishing the frinking
privilege came up.
Mr. Colfax remarked that ths Committee en
Post offices aed-'itpads had framed a bill to
abolish it. The bilt-alao requires members to
show tbe absolute necessity of new post routes.
