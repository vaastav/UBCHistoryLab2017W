SENATE.
Washington, 1oc. 11. Aftar routi.-.s
business Senator Van YV.yek offered the
following: Whereas, commercial treaty
of great importance has been negotiated
between the U. b. and Spain, which was
made public by the king of Spain to
such an extent that it was cabled from
Madrid to the N. Y. Times and given
to the American people by that journal
before the same was presented with be
coming solemnity and secrecy to the
senate; and, whereas, provisions in said
treaty atlecting the subect of revenues
and taxation and involving no serious
questions of diplomacy and state se
crets and that the discussion thereof
should be in open sassion so that the
people may be fully apprised of the
reasons why said treaty should be rat i
tud or rejected, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the committee on
rules be directed to report an amend
uieul or an additional rule requiring
that treaties which concern matters of
revenue be considered in open session.
On the objection of Senator Wilson
the matter went oyer one day.
The Oregon Central land forfeiture
bill was then taken up, and Ihe amend
ment of Mr. Dolph's agreed to, provid
ing that all settlers in good faith on the
land forfeited, who are otherwise quali
fied, shall be entitled to preference
right to enter their land in accordance
with homestead or pre-emption laws,
and shall be regarded as having legal
ly settled such lands from the date of
settlement, and in case such
settler does not do so forthwith
under existisg laws he should be per
mitted to purchase within a year not
to exceed 160 acres at $1.25 and a
reduction of SI. 25, the price ot even
numbered sections along the line of
the uncompleted portion of the road.
An amendment ottered by Sena
tor Plumb was agreed to by a vote of
83 lo 11, repealing Ihe act of March 3,
1875. which allowed settlers on railroad
lauds, subsequently forfeited, to locate
any amount equal to (he original entry
without additional cost
Senator Sherman said if this land w?.s
open to homestead entries, which was
enough., it would not do to permit
speculators to get a hold on these lands
and hold theiu from settlement, lie
(Sherman) would favor it if this bill
would repeal the preemption laws.
They had long since outlived their use
fulness. Senator Morgan inquired of Senator
Dolph whether there were any other
parlies affected t v forfeiture than the
United Stales government and railroad
companies f
Senator Slater did not think there
were, lie thought there had been no
effort made by the company lo sell the
lands.
.Senator Dolph said their mortgages,
and perhaps Ihe deed of trust, which
was embraced hi llieir description of all
lamia ol the company, both earned and
unearned, did not so stale, but he sup
posed that the grautou of a land grant,
made uoon conditions subsequent, could
only take or mortgage such rights as
existed; an. I if Ihosu conditions had not
beeu performed, there could bare ex
isted no right which the mortgagee
could make. There were no questions
involved. Mr. Dolph said, that would
not be fairly and equitably settled by
the provisions of the bill of Mr. Mor
gan's. He bad understood there were
no mortgages or encumbrances, or that
anybody's rights were affected,
except those of the company,
and government. If mortgages existed
ou lands ot the company the matter
should be looked into and the rights of
all pat ties alluded ascertained, as it
might be that the mortgage's rights
covered the right to take the lands and
build the uncompleted portion of the
railway. He moved to recommit the
bill to the committee on public lands
lor tin ther examination.
Senator Blair supported the motion.
Senator Morgan thought that the bill
should provide a complete met hod for
settling before the courts all questions
that may be involved, as had been.doae
with the Atlantic A Pacific forfeiture
Mil. He insisted upon his motion for
recoramital and he expected to vote for
the forfeiture as be had voted for the
Atlantic & Pacific forfeiture, and be ex
pected lo vote for the Texas Pacific for
feiture, but be would see carefully pro
Tided for the rights ot the mortgagees
and settlers. Innocent people who
bought bonds of the laud grant roads.
After further debate the bill at 2
o'clock had to yield to unfinished busi
ness of yesterday, a bill to provide for
the admission of Dakota.
Senator Harrison took the Moor lo re
ply to N est's object ions. He could see
no reason whv a territory possessing
so large, intelligent and christian pop
illation should be permitted to remain
in a condition no lougar adapted to their
uveds. He expressed the wish that the
vote ou the bill might be reached next
Monday.
Senator Butler thought this too early
and declined to consent to any ar
rangement fixing the vote for that day.
Scuatur bhorman introduced a joint
resolution, which passed, appointing
the 21st of February for the ceremouies
connected with the completion of tbo
Washington monument, end authoriz
ing the secretary of tie treasury to
havo cards and invitations, suitable to
the occasion, engraved in the bureau
of engraving and printing, and appro
priating a further sum of $7,500 to
the amount already expended in the
celebration.
Senator Morgan inquired why the
21st of February had beeu selected.
Senator Shermau replied the 22nd
was Sunday.
Senator Morgan saw in that no reason
for change. In his opinion no day was
too sacred for work fittingly commemo
rating this important event.
Senator Sherman said there were a
number of delegations coming, includ
ing those that were military in charao
tor, and the commission had deemed it
unwise to bring the ceremonies into
contact with the sentiments of religious
people.
The inter-stato commerce bill of Mr.
Cullom's, which was the special order
tor the day, had no opportunity of be
ing considered, and after au executive
session the senate adjourned until Mon
day. HOUSE.
The seats of half a dozen democratic
members wore ornamented this morn
ing by roosters with brilliant plumage.
Mr. Hancock, ot the commute o on
appropriations, reported the invalid ap
propriation bill, which was referred to
the committee of the whole
Mr. Mills made an unsuccessful effort
to have passed the senate bill for a pub
lie building at Waco, Texas. Mr. Bar
num objecting.
The house then resumed the consider
ation of the inter-slate commerce bill.
Mr. Glasscock directed his remarks
moro especially to the consideration of
the eyils which grew out of the system
of pooling by railroad companies. He
advocated a strict prohibition of this
system, and expressed a preference for
the features ot Reagan's substitute over
the bill of the committee, but he op
posed, however, the provisions of the
substitute prohibiting greater charges
tor a short than for a long haul, as be
ing unjust and especially inimical to the
interests of his state.
Mr. Dunn favored the substitute. Ho
objected to the appointment of a com
mission, because it was unnecessary
and would fail to accomplish the pu -posos
its friends claimed for it.
Mr. Woodward spoke iu support of
the committee bill, and severely criti
cised the provisions of the substitute,
asserting their effect was to cripple the
railway interests of the counlrv,
Pending further discussion the goner
al understanding was that the general
debate shall olose the nexl day, the sub
ject be taken up and a vole be taken as
between the substitute and tbo commit
tee bill. Whatever measure is success
ful will then be open to amendment and
debate under five minutos rule.
Mr. Reagan has slightly modilied his
motion lo substitute h's proposition for
the entire bill of the committee aud has
offered it as a substitute only for reme
dial futures to that bill. If successful
in having it adopted he will then move
to strike the remainder of the bill
which has reference to the appoinment
of a commissioner.
Mr. O'Neil, Pennsylvania, gave notice
that at the proper lime he would move
to recommit the whole subject.
On motion ot Mr. Warner, of Ohio, a
resolution was adopted calling on the
secretary of lb interior for informa
tion relative to fees claimed by agents
in pension cases.
On motion of Mr. Weaver the senate bill
passed authorizing the First National
bank, of Omaha, to increase its capital
stocg.

A Deal li lied Confession.
Sl'KiNUHKLK, Mass , Dec. 11. A
story comes from Kgremont, Berkshire
Hills, Massachusetts, which states Ihiit
F.slella Non mail, about :I0 years of age,
died in Kgretnont, ti 1M?N, and after the
funeral services iu the Met lioilist church
was buried in the lie n cemetery and
iorgotte:!. A sensational story now
comes from the dying testimony of II.
Worthwright, ol Connecticut, who is
said to havo confessed lo his Brother
that he was a student in the Albany
medical college, and wits present at
the funeral with other students; that
they lay iu wail near the cemetery until
the burial was over and the graveyard
desei -ted, and then he helped disinter the
body and carry it to the medical col
lege. They at once went to work ou it
in the dissecting room, and while eu
gaged in this labor the body showed
signs of life, and was rosuscllated. Find
ing the woman alive ou their hands the
authorities of the college had her taken
to the iusane asylum in Schoharie coun
ty, New York. This is the last Worth
wright saw or knew of her. The wo
man's grave will probably be opened to
seo what the story amounts to.

pan is h treaty :
state uf the I'liltcil Statce:
I transmit herewith for consideration
by the señale with a view to advancing
and consenting to its ratification, a
convention for a commercial reciproc
ity iroaty between the United States
and Sóain, providing for an intimate
and fayored exchange of products with
the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico,
which convention was signed at Madrid
on the 18th nil. Negotiations
for a convention have beca in
progress since the 1st of last April,
Negotiations have been neoestanal'.y
protraetwd owing to the complexity of
details to be incorporated in order that
the convention might respond to the
national policy of intercourse with
neighboring countries, assume a sys
tem which is outlined in my last annua'
message to congress in the following
words; "The condition of these treaties
should bo the free admission of such
merchandise as this country does not
produce, in return for admission free or
undor favored scheme of duties of our
own production, such exchange to apply
to goods carried under the flags of par
ties to the contract in the removal on
both sides from vessels so privileged
of all tonnage duties and national im
ports so these vessels may play between
our ports and those of other contracting
parties, although without infring
ing ou the reserved home trade.
Removal or reduction burdens
on exported products, these countries
coming within the benefits of the
treaties and in accordance with the
technical restriction and penalties by
whichpur intercluirse with those coun
tries is at present hampered. A nerusal
of the report of the convention, now
submitted, will suffice to show fully
that it carries out the policy of the in
tercourse thus announced. I commend
it to you in con lident expectation that
it will receive your sanction. It does
not seem necessary to my present pur
poso to enter into the details of tht
many immediate and prospective ad
vantages which will flow trom tins con
vention to our productions and our
shipping interests.

Chicago, Doc. 11 Arthur Gloason,
chief deputy in County Clerk Ryan's
mice, Makes public a statement this
morning, under .Ins own signature,
charging Henry Biehl, one of the em
ployes of the county clerk s ollice, with
having abstracted the envelope contain
ing the ballois of th e second precinct of
the eighteenth ward and thereby allow
ing a substitution of the forged ballots
found in the envelope when the same
was opened by the jury. Gleasou re
latos that the envelope in quostiou was
placed with others in a large box in the
county clerk's vaults and nailed up the
day the county canvassing board lin-
ishcd its labors, and when the lust mi
presiiotl hml been creal id that fraud
liad been perpetrated, Ityan sent word
lo Gleasou lo laku good care ot the to
turns. On tho receipt, of this message
Gleasou says he called to his assislaua I
Henry Biehl, w m J Sweeney and Wm.
Hayes, clerks in the ollice A search
was made for tho returns, Reihl tthdiug
them in the nailed chest, whereupon
the other searchers were directed not
lolook any longer, Gleason then went
to attend to other duties, and Beihl
soon iiftcrwtird told (ileasou lie had
placed t hem iu one of his drawers in
vault No. 24 1 ho enly person knowing
i lie exact drawer in which these ballots
had been placed were Bicbl and Glea
son. UMMOD says ho did not personal
Iv make an examination of drawer 244
to ascertain whether Biohl had inform
ed him correctly or not, but look
it for grunt d that ho did.
He did not go to the
draWbr until November 25th when
he found them there, previous to that
time ho declares ho never liad the en
velopes in his hands. The vault where
the ballots were kept was locked with
a combination lock, the combination
being known to four persons including
Biehl, and the location ot tho ballots
being known also to Biehl and Glea
on. Gleason then says the evidence
goes to show, boyond doubt, that the
cnange was made in ballots while in
the vault in the county clerk's office.
The evidence also shows that neither
Shields nor O'Laughlin knew where
they were placed and it would have
been exceedingly dillleulttor any oue
not knowing their location to tind them
The ballots having been taken from the
vault in I he afternoon of November 21s'
Hither Bishl or himself is guilty, as he
declares lie did not commit the Crime
it could have been done by no one t(M
only Biehl, and ho therefore charges
him with its perpetration The two
