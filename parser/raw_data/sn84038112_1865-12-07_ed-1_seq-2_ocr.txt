their agcucy.
Tim President knows very well that this
policy is attended with some risk, but it is a
risk t hat must he tnken. In the 'choico of
difficulties it is the smallest risk, and to di

follow the adoption of the Constitutional
amendment by the States lately in insurrec

rests wit it the States to decide for themselves

time occurred that would have
any departure by the Executive from a policy
w hich has so uniformly obtained. Moreover,
Mich a concession on the part of the Presi

would have established a change of suffrage

But whilst it is not competent for tlie Gov
