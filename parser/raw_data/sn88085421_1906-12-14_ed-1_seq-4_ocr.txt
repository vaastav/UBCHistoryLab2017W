"And the next day it snowed," is not
a witticism in Walla Walla, where the
weather man has so signally failed m
bringing about a winter season.
The continued attacks on President
Roosevelt from every source of dissat
isfied politics makes it almost certain
he will have to run for office again as
a sort of vindication.
The term "sawing wood," as used in
Walla Walla nowadays, does not carry
the usual slang definition of "saying
nothing." In fact there's too much said
—when the wood is being sawed.
Tlic "Evening Bunc" uses headlines
to make it appear The Statesman mis
represented Attorney Garrecht. Any
intelligent person reading the Garrecht
statement will easily determine other
wise. Also he will discover the "Bunc"
says untiling about its misrepresenta-
tion of the attorney's client.
It is not expected that President
Roosevelt will write a special message
to congress on the action of the Walla
Walla police arresting a Jap, who put
up the claim of being an American citi
zen, with a right to blackmail other
Japs not claiming legal residence.
The Christinas number of Walla Wal
la's new magazine, Up-To-The-Times,
came out yesterday and is a credit to
its publishers. The cover design is a
handsome piece of work, expressive
and timely. The magazine is full of
good things of local and general in
terest, well written and well edited.
That Third District Development
League lost no time in declaring the
railroads subject to public and private
censure because of a lack of proper in
terest in the tributary country. They,
should not stop at censure. Legal pro
ceedings may properly follow this first
solid demonstration of the public senti
ment.
Some months ago Dr. N. G. Blalock
wa* advertising that he had not re
tire,!, but hal been "chloroformed."
Judging from the enthusiasm and en
ergy displayed by the doctor in push
ing large projects for the benefit of
Walla Walla and surrounding territory
that sort of "chloroforming" would do
good with other men not near the
hustling physician's age.
Nothing can be more despicable or
cowardly than an act such as that
which yesterday brought grief to little
Narcissa Johnson. Out of a spirit of
revenge a schoolmate telephoned a
newspaper the statement that the girl
was engaged to wed a playmate. It
was false and Waa published without
proper investigation. But corrections
and apologies do not assuage the suf
fering of the little victim. Nothing
should be left undone in searching for
the culprit.
It's all over. We are through with

ANONYMOUS MALICE.
Ignorance of the system used In con
ducting the editorial department of a
newspaper permits of many false im
pressions which, when bolstered by
personal animosities, give occasion for
assumptions generally far from the
truth. Hasty conclusions thus drawn
are often rank injustices, particularly
to the individuals employed on news
papers.
Such is the case out of which grows
an anonymous communication in the
Union this morning, written ostensibly
by a student of Whitman college, as
suming to speak for the student body,
and attacking one of the members of
the editorial staff of The Statesman in
a manner subject, assuredly, to severe
criticism. No better demonstration of
the lack of knowledge of how a news
papers is conducted could be given
than in the reckless accusations made
against an individual member of the
staff of this paper. The fact that the
letter was anonymous leads to the
assumption that a person most con
cerned was the author.
No one reporter or employe of The
Statesman is responsible for a per
fected story appearing in these col
umns. The story may be written by a
reporter, edited by another man and
the head written by a third. Such was
the procedure in the case referred to.
The story was written under orders.
If it had not been written by one re
porter another - would have taken his
place and composed it. The reporter
who wrote it saw the heading for the
first time when the paper came off the
press. -
The attempt to give the impression
of personal feeling, or inject person
alities into the matter, is wrong and
calculated to do an injustice to one
who is in every way a gentleman, who
is thoroughly loyal to his alma mater
and whose record there will prove |
greater services done to the splendid
institution which educated him than
can be shown by any anonymous writ
ers to rival newspapers.
If a story appears in The Statesman
which can be proved incorrect, this pa
per will gladly and cheerfully make
the necessary and proper corrections.
Until such proofs are forthcoming it
will continue to have the utmost con
fidence in the integrity, honor and
truthfulness of those of its employes
who have so frequently demonstrat
ed their right to such esteem. j
And it will require more than an ir
responsible, anonymous communication
to destroy that confidence.
CONSOLIDATION IN RELIGION.
The spirit of consolidation is in the
air. It is the supreme economic and
social tendency of the times. Even the
churches have been attacked by it and
certainly there is much to be said for
the movements now in the making for
the consolidation of denominations
whose beliefs are practically identical.
One of the latest projects in this
direction is that which committees of
the Congregational, United Brethren
and Methodist Protestant churches are
striving to work out. The last named
church, by the way, should not be con
fused with the much larger and quite
distinct denomination the Methodist
Episcopal church. Committees appoint
ed to formulate conditions of union
have recently reported. One commit
tee has perfected a plan for consolidat
ing the publishing work of all three
churches and syndicating much of the
material, without affecting the formal
eixstence of present incorporations or
interfering with educational institu
tions. Another proposes a plan of pol
ity whereby the communicants shall be
organized In district associations, an
nual conferences and a national council
to meet quadrennially. In this way
it is expected that complete fusion will
in the end be attained.
The tendency of the religious denom
inations to "get together" is one of
the most hopeful signs of the times.
Competition i s desirable in business,
but in religion cooperation is better.

BERLIN, Dec. 14.—The phonograph
ic record recently made at the instance
of the German emperor, who wishes it
preserved in the German museum of

tains the following words from the
mouth of the German sovereign:
"We must be strong in time of dis
tress; never desire the unobtainable or
things of no value.
"We must accept the day as it is and
seek for good in everything; be satis
fied with human nature and mankind
as they are and be happy even In the
darkest hours if we only can find a
moment of joy.
"We must work and act, even if no
immediate benefit should result from
it.
"Any one adopting this policy will
be free, happy and enterprising, and
his life will be beautiful.
"Mistrusting man is always unjust
toward others and wrongs himself.
"The world is very large and its in
habitants very small, so that they
can't expect everything to cause their
exclusive personal advancement.
"There is no one can assert that
when sorrows are met with they are
not necessary for the rest of creation.
"The will of God is reflected in ev
erything, and we w T eak human beings
do not possess sufficient knowledge to
understand it.
"The world is as it should be and, no
matter what happens, we must recog
nize the will of God is everything."

"PEGGY FROM PARIS."
"Peggy From Paris," George Ade's
merry musical play which has scored
distinct hits and achieved long runs
in New York, Boston, and Chicago,
will be the attraction at the Keylor
Grand next Saturday, Dec. 15, when
it will be offered by the only organiza
tion which is appearing in this suc
cessful melodious comedy. Hence,
theater patrons will be certain of the
excellence of the company and the
richness and beauty of the production.
"Peggy from Paris" is one of the most
popular musical plays ever produced,
a fact known to all persons who are
in touch with the theater. There is no
, doubt of its wit and merriment for
its author is George Ade, the famous
humorist, whose writings have delighted
readers in this country and abroad. It
; has been said of the play that it con
tains much of Mr. Ade's cleverest wit
and satire. That it furnishes abundant
enjoyment is proven by the fact that
it ran four months in New York, five
months in Boston and three in Chica
go. Critics and public unite in pay
ing tribute to its brightness and gaiety
its originality, its clever character
portrayals and its droll and amusing
situations and incidents. In "Peggy
From Paris" the fun is unfailing.
There is not a dull moment. The per

ing every one, move through comical
scenes, are involved in laughable com
plications, and all the while say the
witting things Mr. Ade has put into
their mouths. One is laughing unre
strainedly at the comedy when a burst
of melody precludes a capitivating air
and the comedians and commediennes
from saying funny things turn to
singing catchy songs, most of them
well seasoned with merriment, allot
the captivating, and their delight en
hanced by scores of pretty chorus
girls who sing and dance in alluring
measure. J. A. Raynes wrote the mu
sic for "Peggy from Paris." "Peggy
From Paris" will be one of the nota
ble engagements of the season in this
city, and admirers of all that is best
in musical comedy will wish to hear
it.
WITH PLEASING EFFECTS.
"A Little Outcast," that much talked
of production, will be seen at the Key
lor Grand, Sunday, Dec. 16. It comes
with a wealth of scenery and tons of
electrical appliances for those bewild
ering effects which have been aston
ishing theater goers. The play itself,
is a pretty, natural story, all warmth
and grace and singular originality; the
kind of play to captivate all sorts and
conditions of men and women.
The play opens in the office of Mr.
Harcourt, a wealthy broker, who is
about to take his clerk, Paul Weston,
into the firm as junior partner. Inci
dentally, Weston has won the heart
of the broker's pretty daughter, Mad
i eline, and has wedded her secretly. Mr.
1 Harcourt approves of him, and the
young pair agree to announce their
mariage that evening, when the part
| nership papers are signed. But be
i fore evening, De Voe, the broker's
i graceless nephew, who had hoped to
jbe both son-in-law and partner of his'
uncle, learns a dark secret in Weston's
career, and plans the young man's
downfall. He discovers that, years be
fore, Weston has served a states prison
sentence for another's crime, and De
Voe chanced to be present when Wes
ton is recognized by "Red" Darby, a
former cell mate. In buying the man's
silence, Weston becomes involved in a
money transaction, and is denounced
by De Voe, who is the real culprit, to
Mr. Harcourt, as an ex-convict and a
thief. He is utterly cast off by the
broker, and Madeline is ordered to for
get him. Branded as a thief, and for
saken by his former friends, Weston
becomes an easy prey to drink, until
he falls to the level of habitual drunk
ards and consorts with criminals and
outcasts. At the darkest part of his ca
reer, on the eve of committing a great
crime, Weston is brought to a sudden
realization of his situation, and his
better nature asserts itself. His re
demption and ultimate triumph over
his enemies, is accomplished by a se
ries of powerful dramatic incidents, in
all of which the faithful newsboy "Bob"
is his trusted ally, and the curtain falls
on a happy home scene, where Weston
is restored to his friends' confidence,
and to his wife's love, receives the
spontaneous cheers of the audience,
which is ever ready to applaud the
triumph of virtue and good will.
A number of novel characters are in
troduced, among them being a new
type of "dope fiend" in the person of
"Quinn" a once brilliant lawyer, who,
when under the influence of the drug,
raves in every language but his own,
and is, in his own words, "As the gods"
knowing good and evil, but untouched
by either."
"SIS HOPKINS" A WINNER.
There must be much more than mere
curiosity that impels the theatergoing
public to accept a play season after
season and year after year with little
change of minor importance in the
production. There must be cleanliness
and deep heart interest and originali
ty of expression. In fact the play
must be classic, and that is just why
that pure comedy play of Hoosier coun
try life, 'Sis Hopkins" is received year
after year with increasing enthusiasm.
Miss Rose Melville who created the ti
tle role is still playing the leading char
acter, that of the awkward and shy lit
tle country girl, whose mannerisms
awaken the interests of her hearers, is
now making her eighth tour of the
country and the success which she is
meeting with is more brilliant and pro
nounced than ever. This season's tour
is the longest in point of distance that
Miss Melville has ever made and her
company has been so strengthened by
her manager, Mr. J. R. Stirling, that
part is perfectly sound. Every
actor is a specialist in the particular
character he portrays. The famous
seminary scene has been filled to the
uttermost with new specialty and bril
liant bits of comedy.
At the Keylor Grand tonight.
"PEGGY FROM PARIS."
"Peggy from Paris" comes as a de
lightful change from the run of "music
less' pieces that we have had lately,
says the Vancouver Daily Province.
It is well staged, and played by an ex
cellent company. Some of the numbers
too, are tuneful, and all the libretto
is in George Ade's best style, so Peg
gy, whether she be, from Paris or
Hickory Creek, goes with a vim that is
contagious. Peggy herself is pretty
fascinating and she made a great hit
with her song, "Flirting." Olivette
Haynes as "Blotz" the ladies' maid with
the Cincinnati accent, played well and
got many well-deserved encores for
her song Henny. Clara Martin as
Lutie Plummer had some tunefuj songs
to sing and sang them well. George Eb
ner as "Captain Plummer" played well,
sang well, and was indeed an enter
tainment in himself. William Came-
Scene From "A Little Outcast."
Ron as the tough, worked hard and de
served the large amount of applause he
was rendered. From first to last "Peg
gy from Paris" goes with a swing that
carries it along to success. It played
to what would have been a full house,
had the weather been less boisterous.
Tonight should see every seat taken,
for "Peggy from Paris" combines all
that is best in musical comedy, and
is presented by a company of talent.
The scenery and costumes are of rare
beauty, and in every respect the play
is calculated to delight even the most
exacting of theatre patrons.
Humans Who Hibernate.
The snow fell from a lead-colored
sky, and the day was cold and gloomy.
"Such weather makes one almost
want to hibernate," said a physician.
"A mild form of hibernation is pos
sible to mankind. Indeed, among the
Russian peasants, hard times often
cause hibernation.
"When there is no food and no work
to speak of, the Russian peasant dark
ens his hut, wraps himself in blankets
and sleeps the winter through. Once
every day or so he rouses up enough
to swallow a little bread soaked in wa
ter; then, with a sigh, he falls asleep
again.
"Through the cold, hard winter he
hibernates. When the spring comes,
with its bright prospect of work and
food, he rises, pale and thin and weak,
and sets out to look for a job."
Whirled Eggs.
There is> a Turkish restaurant in
New York where one may eat pilaffs,
sherbets and saffron-flavored goat
stew, but the oddest dish the menu
boasts is "whirled eggs."
Whirled eggs, an impressive dish, is
prepared before the guest. When it is
ordered, a cook enters the dining room

Little Gifts for College Beaus
At Christmas there are many girls
who want to give college men some
tiling for their rooms, but when It
comes to a selection of a suitable gift
their troubles begin. A novelty in this
line was given a Columbia university
man recently—a photograph holder
made of the college, colors. It was
about three feet long and eight inches
wide, formed by two long strips of
light blue and white (the college col
ors) brocade overlapping. Across it at
intervals of ten inches were pockets
three inches deep made of the same
brocade. The case was tacked to the
wall by a rosette of blue and white.
For a Princeton man the colors \vou«
be orange and black and a Yale man's
blue. Plain satin might be used in
stead of brocade.
That college men are constantly giv
ing small and select teas is quite well
known to every girl, but she does not
always remember when selecting some
thing for his room that dishes are nec
essary for tea. Teacups, plates,, quaint
spoons and dishes for sandwiches or
cakes will never coma amiss as a pres
ent. Some china should be bought that
is decorated with masculine hiking de
signs—nothing that would suggest a
pink tea.
Leather Chair Cushion.
A thing which every girl can make
herself is a chair cushion—not the em
broidered kind at which the masculine
mind scoffs, but one of leather. Mis
sion furniture and other heavy types
abound in college rooms, and even for
"team" backs they may be safely sof
tened. These cushions should be made

this vegetable source is most abundant;
then the blacks and native people hurry

catch the milk, which turns thick and

The globetrotter, replacing the vol

"I've tasted the cow tree's milk and
found it good. This milk has been anal

to milk, sugar, casein and phosphates.
So rich is it that ordinary milk is as

SHIVER IS NATURE'S REMEDY.
At the Thanksgiving football game
the young girl, despite her sable stole,
shivered.
"That shiver," said her companion,
a physician, "is nature's method of
warming you. It is nature's preventive
remedy for a cold.
"You see, the shiver is an involun.
tary rythmical contraction of the mus
cles, and there is nothing like a con
traction of the muscles for raising the
temperature of the body.
"Thus, when you shiver, nature is
putting you through a little course ot
exercise to warm you up. so that you
won't take a cold, or a dose of rheu
matism, or an attack of pneumonia.
When nature shakes you up in this
kindly way, it is your duty to help her

your immunity from illness."
