Nkw York, December IB. A. four--story
brown stone building, East Tenth
street, Is numbered !I0 and :i2. There is
n store on the ground floor, and in the
three upper stories of flic east wing Mrs.
Fimiham Ids 'out furnished . rooms to
lodgers. Mrs. C'elia Kelly lives In the
west wing on the west side of the brick
wall that divides the houses in two. Miss
Cclla Lynagh lives with her. It was
nearly hulf past two o'clock when Miss
Lynagh was aroused by a suspicious
stucil of smoke. She iiivesiialed and
found that It came from Mrs. Farn
ham's premises at No. ."2. Putting on her
clothes she went down to the street ami
palled the bell of No. ,12 and then tried
the door. It was open. Miss Lynagh shout
ed lire, but no one answered. Then she
resolutely climbed the long stairs to the
second floor, groped her way along the
landing and rapped on the doors.
"I'iuk! kirk! fikk!"
she shouted, us loudly as the smoke
which filled her throat would let her.
There were hurried movements within
and preparations for flight. Up the second
and the third flight the brave girl groped
her way through the thickening smoke,
knocking on the doors and uttering her
warning cry. At the top the smoke
grew almost insufferable, but Miss
Lynngh did not shrink. She knew
that people lived on the floor
and heard no sound to indicate
that they were .awake. The hand
rails anil balusters were hot and the
smoke threatened to choke her at every
step. At the head of tlie stairs she ran
against a door hammered on it and pushed
it open. A man was wilhin sitting awake
in a chuir pulling on his clothes. "Hurry,
futrry I " shouted tlie girl, "tlie house is
on lire." He did not turn or seem to pay
any attention to her. As she turned she
saw the stairway at her feet between the
landing she stood on and the fourth
floor blaze into lire. Kcst-'otely gather
ing her skirts about iier, she made a dash
down the flight ntnl ' got through the lire
unscathed and reached the street in safely.
The firemen met her at the door. She
told them that there was one laggard
still.., on the .. top floor, cut off,
hut that she thought lie had gained
the roof through the scuttle. The fire
men went up, but before they reached
the burning flight a trash was heard in
the rear of the house und the missing
lodger was found in the back yard with a
sprained back. He was Chxiies A. Wat

done.

look the sheets from his bed and, knot
ting them together, lied one end to the
edstcad and threw the other ont of the
window. Tlie rope thus made reached
to within seven or eight feet of a narrow
extension, the roof of which was under
the second story windows. It was haz
ardous to attempt to jump to it for fear
of fulling over into the yard, but there
was nothing else to be clone. Mr. Wat
son let himself clown the length of
the rope und dropped. He dropped
on the edge of the narrow ledge
and from that info the yard. There the
firemen found him, unable to stir, ami

AN ENGLISH HOLOCAUST.
Twelve l'ersong Cremated In a Tenement
House nt riymoutli, Kiiglantl, and Many
Others Killed or Mfiimisly Injured 111
Their Umleavors to Kscu-pe Heroic In
cidents. London, December 14. A fire, which
caused a frightful loss of life, occurred
last night at Plymouth. The fire broke
out in a tenement house In Love street,
a narrow thoroughfare in the slums de
voted to sailors' lodging houses, cheap
taverns and tall rickety tenements. Most
of the occupants of the tenements were
asleep when the Are started. Those who
were awake or were awakened by tlie
tumult made frantic efforts to escape,
In most cases their terror overpowered
their reason, and they escaped from the
burning building only to rowt death on
the pavement. One man was instantly
killed and crushed beyond recognition by
jumping from a fourth-story window to
the sidewalk. Many of the lodgers threw
muttrasscs and other articles of betiding
upon the ground and jumped upon
them from a height of forty feet.
One child was killed in this way, and sev
eral men and women had legs and arms
brokon. The fire escapes were crowded
with household goods and were useless.
Many pitiful sights were witnessed by the
large crowd assembled in the street, but
powerless to help. One lodger, a young
man named Rlckford, clung to a window
sill for several nilnntes with his little
sister under his arm. If he had
been alone he could have
dropped to the street in com
parative safety, but the child had
Mooned ami was a dead weight. At last
he had to let go his hold, but managed to
full in such a way that the little girl fell
ontopofhlin. Bofli his legs are broken
and Ms spine is infuie'i. He is ul-" ter
ribly burned about the face and bauds b
the flames which surrounded him befort
he fell. The child is alo badlj
burned, but will recover. The fire
men worked heroically. Sever
of them were detailed to enter the build
ing, which was then a veritable furnact
of tire, and rescue the survivors. These
life-savers plunged into the seething
flames, followed by the piemen, who
kept plavlng the hose upon them, and
upon each other. In this way. Beverai
lives were saved. After the fire was ex
tinu'shed twelve bodies were fount'
burned to a crisp. Two lodgers arc
still missing.
