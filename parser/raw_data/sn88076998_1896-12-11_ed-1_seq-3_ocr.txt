Washington, Dec. 7.—The following ia the
Xext of President Cleveland's message to
.*'"5 tongreas:
To the Congress of the United States:
As representative* of the people In the
eglslatlve branch of their government, you
lave assembled at a time when the
strength and excellence of our free instl
utlons and the fitness of our citizens to
njoy popular rule have been again made
fs manifest. A political contest involving
I* :?', Momentous consequences, fraught with
... 'everlsh apprehension and creating ag-
Tesalveness so intense as to approach bit
r. *erness and passion has been wagvd
y-f'- throughout our land and determined by
1'ihe decree of free and independent sut
4-*' rage, without disturbance of our tran
e- i- juilllty or the least sign of weakness in our
iational structure. When we consider
these incidents and contemplate the peace
ful obedience and manly submission which
have succeeded a heated clash of political
pinions, we discover abundant evidence
of a determination on the part of our coun
trymen to abide by every verdict of the
popular will and to be controlled at all
times by an abiding faith in the agencies
4 established for the direction of the af-
Talrs of their government.
The Turkish Question.
At the outset of a reference to the more
important matters affecting our relations
with foreign powers, it would afford me sat
isfaction if 1 could assure the congress
that the disturbed condition in Asiatic Tur
*ey had during the past year assumed a
ess hideous and bloody aspect, and that
slther as a consequence of the awakening
of the Turkish government to the demand
of humane civilisation, or as the result
of decisive action on the part of the great
nations having the right by treaty to in
terfere for the protection of those exposed
to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel
fanaticism, the shocking features of the
situation had been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welpomlng a soft
ened disposition or protective Intervention,
we have been afflicted by continued and
not unfrequent reports of the wanton de
struction of homes and the bloody butch
ery of men, women and children, made
martyrs to their profession of Christian
faith
Protection of Americans.
While none of our citizens In Turkey
have thus far been killed or wounded,
though often in the midst of dreadful
scenes of danger, their safety In the fu
ture is by no means assured. Our govern
ment at home and our minister at Con
stantinople have left nothing undone to
protect our missionaries In Ottoman terri
tory, who constitute nearly all the individ
uals residing there who have a right to
claim our protection on the score of Amer
ican citizenship.
Cuban Insurrection.
The insurrection in Cuba still continues
with all its perplexities. It is difficult to
perceive that any progress has thus far
been made towards the pacification of the
island, or that the situation of affairs as
depicted in my last annual message has
in the least improved. If Spain stilt holds
Havana and the seaports and all the con
siderable towns, the insurgents still roam
at will over at least two-thirds of the in
land country. If the determination of
Spain to put down the lnsurrecion seems
but to strengthen with the lapse of time
and is evinced by her unhesitating devotion
of largely Increased military and naval
forces to the task, there is much reason to
believe that the Insurgents have gained
in point of numbers and character and re
sources, and are none the less Inflexible in
their resolve not to succumb without prac
tically securing the great objects for which
they took up arms.
Not let Entitled to Recognition.
If Spain has not yet reestablished her
authority, neither have the insurgents yet
made good their title to be regarded as an
independent state. Indeed, as the con
test has gone on, the pretense that civil
far
overnment exists on tne island: except so
as Spain is able to maintain it, has
been practically abandoned. Spain doe?
keep on foot such a government, more or
less Imperfectly, In tne large towns and
their immediate suburbs. But, that excep
tion being made, the entire country is either
given over to anarchy or Is subject to the
military occupation of one or the other
party.
Why Spain Does Not Win.
Were the Spanish armies able to meet
their antagonists in the open, or in pitched
battle, prompt and decisive results might
be looked for, and the Immense superiority
of the Spanish forces In numbers, dis
cipline, and equipment, could hardly fall
to tell greatly to their advantage.
Situation Deplorable.
Meanwhile, as in all cases of protracted
civil strife, the passions of the combatants
grow more and more inflamed anu excesses
on both sides become more frequent and
more .deplorable. They are also partici
pated in by bands of marauders, who, now
in the name of one party and now In the
name of the other, as may best suit tho
occasion, harry the country at will and
plunder its wretched Inhabitants for their
own advantage. Such a condition of things
would inevitably entail Immense destruction
of property, even if it were the policy
of both parties to prevent it as lar as prac
ticable. But while such seemed to be the
original policy of the Spanish government,
it has now apparently abandoned It and .s
acting upon tne same theory as the in
surgents, namely, that the exigencies of
the contest require the wholesale annihila
tion of property that it may not prove of
use and 'advantage to the enemy. It is to
the same end that in pursuance of general
orders, Spanish garrisons are now beim
withdrawn from plantations and the rural
population required to concentrate Itself
in the towns.
Would Engage Our Serious Attention.
The spectacle of utter ruin of an adjoin
ing country, by nature one of the most
fertile and charming on the' globe, would
engage the serious attention of the gov
ernment and the people of the United
States in any circumstance. In point of
fact, they have a concern with it which is
by no means of a wholly sentimental
or philantnropic character. It lies so near
to us as to be hardly separated from our
territory. Our actual pecuniary interest in
it is second only to that of the people and
government of Spain. It Is reasonably es
timated that at least from 130,000,000 to
$50,000,000 of American capital are Invested
in plantations, and in railroad, mining
and other business enterprises on the
island. The volume of trade between the
United States and Cuba, which in 1S89
'amounted to about J64.000.000, rose in
J893
to about *103,000,000. and in 1894, the
year before the present insurrection
oroke out, amounted to nearly *96,000,000.
Vexatious Entanglements.
Besides this large pecuniary stake in
the fortunes of Cuba, the United States
finds itself inextricably involved in the
.^present contest in other ways both vex
atious and costly. Many Cubans reside in
.'this country and indirectly promote the
^insurrection through the press, by public
^meetings, by the purchase and shipment of
i. arms. by the raising of funds and by other
^'means, which the spirit of our institutions
(Sand the tenor of our laws do not permit
to be made the subject of criminal prosecu
tions. Some of them, though Cubans at
-iheart and in all their feelings and interests,
jhave taken out papers as naturalized cltl
frf /.sens of the United States, a proceeding re
a sorted to with a view to possible protec
ift^tlon by this government, and not unnat
lirally regarded with much Indignation by
the country of their origin.
TIio Question of Intervention,
These inevitable entanglements of the
fete
1
x«v
United States with the rebellion in Cubs.,
the large American property Interests af
fected and considerations of philanthropy
and humanity In general have led to a ve
hement demand in various quarters for
some sort of positive Intervention on
the part of the united States. It was at
first proposed that belligerent rights should
be accorded to the Insurgents—a propo
sition no longer urged because' untimely
and In practical operation clearly perilous
and Injurious to our own interests. It has
since been and is now sometimes contended
that the Independence of the Insurgents
should be recognised. But Imperfect and
restricted as tne Spanish government of
the Island may be, no other exists there—
unless the will of the military officer In
temporary command of a particular dis
trict can be dignified as a species of gov
ernment. It is now also suggested that the
United States should buy the Island—a sug
gestion possibly worthy of consideration
If there were any evidence of a desire or
willingness on the part of Spain to enter
tain such a proposal. It is urged, finally,
that, all other methods falling, the existing
Internecine strife In Cuba should be ter
minated by our Intervention, even at the
cost of a war between the United States
and Spain—a war which Its advocates con
fidently prophesy could be neither large
in its proportions nor doubtful in Its issue.
Bight, Not Might, Most Bule.
The correctness of this forecast need be
neither affirmed nor denied. The United
States has nevertheless a character to
maintain .as a nation, which plainly dic
tates that right and not might should be
the rale of its conduct. Further, though
the United 8tates Is not a nation to which
peace 1s a necessity, it is in truth the most
pacific of powers, and desires nothing so
much as to live In amity with all the world.
Its own ample and diversified domains sat
isfy all possible longings for territory, pre
clude all dreams of conquest, and prevent
any casting of covetous eyes upon neigh
boring regions, however attractive.
Spain Should Grant Autonomy.
It Is In the assumed temper and dispo
sition of the Spanish government to rem
edy these grievances, fortified by indica
tions of influential public opinion in Spain,
that this government has hoped to discover
the most promising and effective means of
composing the present strife, with honor
and advantage to Spain and with tho
achievement of all the reasonable objects
of the Insurrection. It would seem that
If Spain should offer to Cuba genuine
autonomy—a measure of home rule which,
while preserving the sovereignty of Spain,
would satisfy all rational requirements of
her Spanish subjects—there should be no
just reason why the pacification of the
Island might not be effected on that basis.
Objections Answered.
It has been objected on the one side that
Spain should not promise autonomy until
her Insurgent subjects lay down their
arms on the other side, that promised au
tonomy, however liberal. Is insufficient, he
cause without assurance of the promise be
ing fulfilled, but the reasonableness of a re
quirement by Spain, of unconditional sur
render on the part of the Insurgent Cubans
before their autonomy is conceeded, lr. not
altogether apparent. It ignores important
features of the situation—the stability of
two years' duration has given to the In
surrection the feasibility of Its indefinite
prolongation In the nature of things,
and as shown by past experience, the
utter and imminent ruin of the island, un
less the present strife Is speedily composed
above all, the rank abuses which all pur
ties in Spain, all branches of her govern
ment ana all her leading public men con
cede to exist and profess a desire to re
move. Facing such circumstances to with
hold the proffer of needed reforms until
the parties demanding them put them
selves at mercy by throwing down their
arms has the appearance oi neglecting the
gravest of perils and Inviting suspicion as
to the sincerity of any professed willingness
to grant reforms.
The objection on behalf of the Insurgents
—that proposed reforms cannot be relied
upon—must of course be considered, though
we have no right to assume and no reason
for assuming that anything Spain under
takes to do for the relief or Cuba will not
be done according to both the spirit and
the letter of the undertaking.
Oftefced Our Services.
Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions
and precautions on the part of the weak
er of two combatants are always natural
and not always unjustifiable—being sin
cerely desirous In the interest of both, as
well as on Its own account that the Cuban
problem should be solved with the least
possible delay, it was intimated by thla
government to the government of Spain
some months ago that, If a satisfactory
measure of home rule were tendered the
Cuban insurgents, and would be accepted
by them upon a guaranty of its execution,
tho United States would endeavor to fin.i
a way not objectionable to Spain of fur
nishing such guaranty. While no definite
response to this intimation has yet been
received from the Spanish government,
is believed to be not altogether unwelcome.
A Limit to Our Patience.
Whatever circumstances may arise, our
policy and our interests would constrain us
to object to the acquisition of the Island or
an interference with Its control by any
other power. It should be added that it
cannot be reasonably assumed that tho
hitherto expectant attitude of the United
States will be Indefinitely maintained.
While we are anxious to accord all due re
spect to the sovereignty of Spain, we can
not view the pending conflict in all Its
features and properly apprehend our in
evitably close relations to it and Its pos
sible results without considering that, by
'the course of events we may be drawn into
such an unusual and unprecedented con
dition as will fix a limit to our patient
waiting for Spain to end the contest, either
alone and in her own way, or with our
friendly cooperation.
Deferring the choice of ways and meth
ods until the time for action arrives, we
should make them depend upon the pre
cise conditions then existing and they
should not be determined upon without
giving careful heed to every consideration
involving our honor and interest, or the
international duty we owe to Spain. Until
we face the contingencies suggested, or
the situation is by other Incidents impera
tively changed, we should continue in the
line of conduct heretofore pursued, thus
in all circumstances exhibiting our obedi
ence t-- the requirements of public law and
out regard for the duty enjoined upon us
by the position we occupy in the family of
nations.
Venezuelan Question.
The Venezuelan boundary question ha«i
ceased to be a matter of difference between
Great Britain and the United States, their
respective governments having agreed
upon the substantial provisions of a treaty
between Great Britain and Venezuela, suii
mlttlng the whole controversy to arbitra
tion. The provisions of the treaty are so
eminently just and fair, that the assent of
Venezuela thereto may confidently be an
ticipated.
General Arbitration with Great Britain.
Negotiations for a treaty of general ar
bitration for all differences between Great
Britain and the United States are far ad
vanced, and promise to reach a successful
consummation at an early date.
Oar Finances.
ISf i-J\Ai.
Jr£\&sV
The secretary of the treasury reports
that during the fiscal year ended June 30,
1896, the receipts of the government from
ail sources amounted to *409,475,40X.78. Dur
ing the same period its expenditures were
*434,678,654.48, the excess of expenditures
over receipts amounting to *25,203,245.70.
The ordinary expenditures during the year
were *4,015,852.21 less than during the pre
ceding fiscal year. Of the receipts men
tioned, there were derived from customs
the sum cf *1S0,021,751.67 and from internal
revenue *146,830,615.66. The receipts from
customs show an increase of $7,863,134.22
over those from the same source for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1895, and the re
ceipts from internal revenue an increase of
*3,584,537.91.
Imports and Exports.
The value of our imported dutiable mer
chandise during the last fiscal year v/au
*36^,757,170, and the value of free goods im
ported *409,967,470, being an increase of *6,
523,675 in the value of dutiable goods and
*41,231,034 In the value of free goods over
the preceding year. Our exports of mer
chandise, foreign and domestic, amounted
in value to *S!2,606,938, being an Increase
over the preceding year of *75,068,?X?. The
average ad valorem duty paid on dutiable
goods imported during the year was 89.94
per cent, and on free and dutiable goods
taken together 20.55 per cent.
Movement of Metallic Money.
The total amount of goiu exporieu during
the last fiscal year was *112,409,947 and of
sliver *60,541,670, being an increase of *45,
941,466 of gold, and *18,246,384 of silver over
the exportations of the preceding fiscal
year. The imports of gold were *33,525,065,
and of silver *28,777,186, being *2,859,695 less
of gold, and *8,566,007 more of silver than
during the preceding year. The total stock
of metallic money in the United States at
the close of the last fiscal year ended on
the SOth day of June, 1896, was *1,228,326,
035, of which *599,597,964 was In gold, and
*628,728,071 In silver.
Per Capita Circulation of C23.63.
On the first day of November, 1896, the
total Btock of money of all kinds In the
country was *2,285,410,590, and the amount
In circulation, not including that In the
treasury, holdings, was *1,627,056,641, being
3T
tf
*22.63 per capita, upon an estimated popula
tion of 71.902.000.
National Banks.
The number of national banks organised
from the time the law authorising their
creation was passed, up to October 31,1896,
was 6,051, and of this number S.S79 were at
the date last mentioned in active opera
tion, having authorised capital stock of
*650,014,895, held by 288,902 shareholders, and
circulating notes amounting to *211,412,620.
The total outstanding circulating notes of
all national banks on the 31st day of Oc
tober, 1896, amounted to *2*4,563,807 Includ
ing unredeemed, but fully secured notes
of banks Insolvent and In process of liqui
dation. The Increase In national bank cir
culation during the year ending on that
day was *21,099,429. On October 6,1896, when
the condition of national banks was last
reported, the total resources of the 3,679
actftve Institutions was *3,268,685,813.83,
which Included *1,89*^68,839.08 in loans and
discounts and *362,165.78186 In money of all
kinds on hand. Of their liabilities *1,697,
891,058.03 was due to Individual depositors
and *209,944,019 consisted of outstanding cir
culating notes. There were organised dur
ing the year preceding the date last men
tioned 28 national banks, located In 15
states, of which 12 were organised In the
eastern states with a capital of *1,180,000.
six In the western states with a capital or
*875,000, and ten In the southern states with
a capital of *1,190,000. During the year,
however, 37 banks voluntarily abandoned
their franchises under the national law,
and in the case of Z7 others It was found
necessary to appoint receivers. Therefore,
as compared with the year preceding, there
was a decrease of in the number of
active banks. The number of existing
banks organised under state laws Is
6,708.
Immigration.
The number of Immigrants arriving In
the United States during the fiscal year was
343,267, of whom *40,468 were permitted to
land, and 2,799 were debarred on various
grounds prescribed by law, and returned
to the countries whence they came, at the
expense of the steamship company by
which they were brought in. The increase
In immigration over the preceding year
amounted to 84,131. It is reported that with
some exceptions the immigrants of the past
year were of a hardy laboring class, accus
tomed and able to earn a support for them
selves, and it is estimated that the money
brought with them amounted to at least
*5,000,000. Though it was probably much in
excess of that sum, since only those having
less than *30 are required to disclose the
exact amount, and It is known that many
brought considerable sums of money to
buy land and build homes. Including all
the Immigrants arriving who were over
14 years of age, 28.63 per cent, were illit
erate as against 20.37 per cent, of those of
that age arriving during the preceding fis
cal year.
Work of the Life Savers.
From the life-saving service It Is re
ported that the number of disasters to
documented vessels within the limits of Its
operations during the year was 437. These
vessels had on board 4,608 persons, of
whom 4,695 were saved and 13 lost. The
value of such vessels Is estimated at *8,80,
140, and of their cargoes, *3,846,3SG, making
the total value of property Imperiled $1"
726,520. Of this amount *11,292,707 wat
saved and *1,432,750 was lost.
The Army.
The report of the secretary of war ex
hibits satisfactory conditions in the sev
eral branches of the nubile service in
trusted to his charge. The limit of our mil
itary force, as fixed by law, is constantly
and readily maintained. The present dis
cipline and moralo of our army are excel
lent, and marked progress and efficiency
are apparent throughout its entire organi
zation.
With the exception of delicate duties In
the suppression of slight Indian dis
turbances along our southwestern boun
dary, in which the Mexican troops cooper
ated, and the compulsory but peaceful re
turn, with tho consent of Great Britain, of
a band of Cree Indians from Montana to
the British possessions, no active opera
tions have been required of the army dur
ing the year past.

consequent concentration of troops and
The Mllltln.
The organized militia numbers 112,879 men.
The appropriations for Its support by the
several states approximate *2,800,000 an
nually, and *400,000 are contributed by the
general government. Investigation shows
these troops to be usually drilled and In
spired with much military Interest, but in
many instances they are so deficient in
proper arms and equipment that a sudden
call to active duty would find them in
adequately prepared for field service. 1
therefore recommend that prompt meas
ures be taken to remedy this condition an.1
that every encouragement be given to
this deserving body of unpaid and volun
tary citizen soldiers, upon whose asslst-
During the past year rapid progress has
been made toward the completion of the
scheme adonted for the erection and arma
ment of fortifications along our seacoast,
while equal progress has been made In pro
viding the material for submarine defense
In connection with these works. It Is pecul
iarly gratifying at this time to note tne
great advance that has been made in this
important undertaking since the date of
my annual message to the Fifty-third con
gress at the opening of Its second ses
sion in December, 1893. At that time I in
formed the congress of the approaching
completion of 9 12-Inch, 20 10-lnch and 34
8-Inch high power steel guns and 75 12-Inch
rifled mortars.
This total then seemed Insignificant when
compared with the great work remaining
to be done. Yet It was none the less a
source of satisfaction to every citizen
when he reflected that it represented the
first installment of the new ordnance of
American design and American manufac
ture, and demonstrated our ability to sup
ply from our own resources guns of unex
celled power and accuracy. At that date,
however, there were practically no car
riages upon which to mount those guns,
ana only 31 emplacements for guns and 61
for mortars. Nor were all these emplace
ments in condition to receive their arma
ment. Only one high-power gun was at
that time in position for the defense of the
entire coast. Since that time the number
of guns actually completed has been In
creased to 21 12-inch 56 ten-inch 61 eight
inch high-power breech-loading steel ten
rapid-fire guns and 80 12-lnch rifled mor
tars. In addition there are in process of
construction of one 16-lnch type gun, 50 12
inch, 56 ten-inch, 27 eight-inch high-power
guns and 66 12-inch rifled mortars in all
428 guns and mortars.
The Postal Service.
The post office department Is In good
condition, and the exhibit made of Its op
erations during the fiscal year ended Junu
30. 1896, If allowance is made for imper
fections In the laws applicable to it, is very
satisfactory. The total receipts during the
year were *82,499,208.40. The total ex
penditures were *90,626,296.84, exclusive of
S1.659.898.Z7, which was earned by the Pa
cific railroad for transportation and cred
ited on their debt to the government. There
was an increase of receipts over the pre
vious year of *5,516,080.21, or 7.1 per cent.,
and an increase of expenditures of *3,836.
124.02, or 4.42 per cent. The deficit was
*1,679,956.19, less than that of the preceding
year.
Abuse of Second-Class Bates.
The deficit for the last year, although
much less than that of the last and pre
ceding years, emphasizes the necessity for
legislation to correct the growing abuse
of second-class rates, to which the de
ficiency is mainly attributable. The trans
mission at the rate of one cent a pound
of serial libraries, advertising sheets,
"house organs" (periodicals advertising
some particular "house" or Institution),
sample copies and the like ought certainly
to be discontinued.
Expenditures.
the exercise of care and vigilance by the fairs committed to his supervision. It is
various officers charged with the responsl
billty in the expenditure of appropriations
have resulted in reducing to a minimum
the cost of maintenance of our military es
tablishment. During the past year the
work of constructing permanent infantry
and cavalry posts has been continued at
the places heretofore designated. The sec
retary of war repeats his recommendation
that appropriations for barracks and quar
ters should more strictly conform to the
needs of the service, as judged by the de
partment, rather than respond to the
wishes and importunities of localities. It
is Imperative that much of the money pro
vided for such construction should now he
allotted to the erection of necessary quar
ters for the garrisons assigned to the coast
defenses, where many men will be needed
to properly care for and operate modern
guns. It Is essential, too, that early pro
vision be made to supply the necessary
force of artillery to meet the demands of
this service.
The remainder of our postal revenue,
amounting to something more than *5.000,
000, was derived from box rents, registry
fees, money-order business and other simi
lar items. The entire expenditures of the
department. Including pay for transporta
tion credited to the Pacific railroads, was
*92,186,195.11, which
may
the cost of receiving, carrying and deliv
ering the above mail matter. It thus ap
pears that though the second-class mat
ter constituted more than two-thirds ot
the totul that was carried, the revenue
derived from it was less than one-thirtieth
of the total expense. The average revenue
from each pound of first-class matter was
93 cents. From each pound of second
class, S^t mills. (Of the second class 52,848.
297 was county-free matter). From each
pound of third class, 13.1 cents. From each
pound of fourth class, 15.6 cents. The
growth of weight of second-class matter
has been from 299,000,000 pounds In 1894 to
312.000,000 pounds In 1895, and to almost
349,000,(100 in 1896, and it Is quite evident this
increasing drawback is far outstripping any
possible growth ot postal revenues.

which, under the loose Interpretation of
a loose statute, has been gradually given
second-class rates, thus absorbing all
profitable returns derived from first-class
matter, which pays three or four times
more than its cost, and producing a large
annual loss to be paid by general taxation.
If such second-class matter paid merely
tho cost of its handling our deficit would
disappear and a surplus result which
might be used to give tlie people still better
mall facilities or cheaper rates of letter
postage. I recommend that legislation be
at once enacted to correct these abuses and
Introduce better business ideas in the reg
ulation of our postal rates.
The Navy.
The work of the navy department and Its
present condition are fully exhibited in the
report of the secretary. The construction
of vessels for our new navy has been ener
getically prosecuted by the present admin
istration upon the general lines previously
adopted, tne department having seen no
necessity for radical change in prior meth
ods, under which the work was found to be
progressing in a manner highly satisfac
tory. It has been decided, however, to pro
vide in every shipbuilding contract that die
builder should pay ail trial expenses, and
it has also been determined to pay no speed
premiums In future contracts. The pre
miums recently earned and some yet to be
decided are features oi the contracts made
before this conclusion was reached.
On March 4, 1893, there were In commis
sion but two armored vessels, the double
tr.rreted monitors Mlantonoraah and Mon
terey. Since that date, of vessels thereto
fore authorized, there have been placed in
their first commission three first-class and
two second-class oattle ships, two armored
cruisers, one harbor defense ram and five
double-turreted monitors, including the
Maine and the .Puritan, just completed.
Klght new armored cruisers and two new
gunboats have also been commissioned.
Tlie Iowa, another battle ship, will be com
pleted about March 1, and at least four
more gunboats will be ready for sea In the
early spring.
There have been authorized by congress
since March, 1893, five battle ships, six
light-draft gunboats, 16 torpedo boats and
one submarine torpedo boat. Contracts
for the building of all of them have been
let. The secretary expresses the opinion
that we have for the present a sufficient
supply of cruisers and gunboats, and that
hereafter the construction of battle ships
and torpedo boats will supply our needs.
Department of the Interior.
The report of the secretary of the interior
presents a comprehensive and interesting
exhibit of the numerous and Important af-
impossible in this communication to do
more than briefly refer to a few of the sub
jects concerning which the secretary gives
full and Instructive Information.
The money appropriated on account of
this department and for its disbursement
for the fiscal year ended June 3U, 1893,
amounted to more than *157,000,000, or a
greater sum than was appropriated for tho
entire maintenance of the government for
the two fiscal years ended June 30,1861.
The Public Domain.
Our public lands, originally amounting
to 1,840,000,000 acres, have been so reduced
that only about 600,000,000 acres still remain
In government control, excluding Alaska.
The balance, being by far the most valuable
portion, has been given away to settlers,
to new states, and to railroads, or sold at
a comparatively nominal sum. 1
he patent
ing of lands in execution of railroad grants
has progressed rapidly during the year,
and since the 4tli day of Murch, 1893, about
25,(00,000 acres have thus been conveyed to
these corporations.
1 agree with the secretary that the re
mainder of our public lands should be
more carefully dealt with and their aliena
tion guarded by better economy and greater
prudence.
The Indians.
The total Indian population of the United
States is 177,235, according to a census
made In 1895, exclusive of those within the
state ot New York and those comprising
the five civilized tribes. Of this number
there are approximately 88,000 children of
school age. During the year 23,393 of these
were enrolled in schools. The progress
which has attended recent efforts to ex
tend Indian school facilities and the an-
tions to that end, cannot fall to afford the
utmost satisfaction to those who believe
that the education of Indian children is a
prime factor In the accomplishment of
Indian civilization.
Conditions Improved.
It may be said in general terms, that In
every particular the improvement ot the
Indians under government has been
most marked and encouraging. The sec
retary, the commissioner of Indian affairs
and the agents having charge of In
dians to whom allotments have been made
strongly urge the passage of a law pro
hibiting the sale of liquor to allottees who
have taken their lands in severalty. I
earnestly join In this recommendation.
Allotment of land),
A commission organized and empowered
under several recent laws Is now negotiat
ing with these Indians for the relinquish
ment of their courts and the division of
their common lands In severalty and are
aiding In the settlement of the trouble
some question of tribal membership. The
reception of their first proffers of negotia
tion were not encouraging, but through pa
tience and such conduct on their part as
demonstrated that their Intentions were
friendly and In the interest of the tribes
the prospect of success has become more
promising. The effort should be to save
these Indians from the consequences of
their own mistakes and improvidence and
to secure to the real Indian his rights as
against Intruders and professed friends
who profit by his retrogression.
I indorse the recommendation made by
the preuent secretary of the interior as
well as his predecessor that a permanent
commission consisting of three members,
one of whom shall be an army officer, be
created to perform the duties now devolv
ing upon the commissioner and assistant
commissioner of Indian affairs. The man
agement of the bureau Involves such nu
merous and diverse details and the ad
vantages of an uninterrupted policy are so
apparent that I hope the change suggested
will meet the approval of the congress.
Pensions.
The diminution of our enormous pen
sion roll and the decrease of pension ex
penditure which h&ve been so often confi
dently' foretold, still fall In material reali
zation. The number of pensioners on the
rolls at the close of the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1896, was 970,678. This is the largest
number ever reported. The amount paid
exclusively for the pensions during the
year was *138,214,761.94, a slight decrease
from that of the preceding year, while the
total expenditures on account of pensions,
including the cost of maintaining the de
partment and expenses attending pension
distribution amounted to *142,20S,5a0.59, or
within a very small fraction of one-third
of the entire expense of supporting the gov
ernment during the same year. The num
ber ot new pension certificates Issued was
90,640. Of these, 40,374 represent original al
lowances of claims and 15,878 increase of
existing pensions. The number of per
sons receiving pensions from the Unlteu
States, but residing in foreign countries,
at the close of the last fiscal year was 3,781,
and the amount paid to them during the
year was *582,735.38.
Abases Are Demoralizing.
In my opinion, based upon such state
ments as those and much other informa
tion and observation, the abuses which
have been allowed to creep into our pen
sion system have dene incalculable harm
in demoralising our people and undermin
ing good citizenship. I have endeavored
within my sphere of official duty to pro
tect our pension roll and make It what
It should be. -oil of honor, containing
the names or those disabled In their coun
try's service and worthy of their coun
try's affectionate remembrance.
The Pacific Railroads.
The secretary calls attention to the pub
lic interests involved in an adjustment of
the obligations of the Pacific railroads to
the government. I deem It to be an Impor
tant duty to especially present this subject
to the consideration or the congress. On
January 1, 1897, with tho amount already
matured, more than *13,000,000 of the prin
cipal of the subsidy bonds issued by the
United States in aid of the construction of
the Union Pacific railway, including Its
Kansas line, and more than *6,000,000 of like
bonds issued in aid of the Central Pacific
railroad, including those Issued to the
Western Pacific Railroad company, will
have fallen due and been paid or must on
that day be paid by the government. With
out any reference to the application ot tho
sinking fund now In the treasury, this will
create such a default on the part of these
companies to the government as will give
It the right to at once Institute proceed
ings to foreclose Its mortgage Hen.
In addition to this Indebtedness, which
will be due January 1, 1897, there will ma
ture between that date and January 1,1899,
the remaining principal of such subsidy
bonds, which must also be met by tho gov
ernment. These amount to more than *20,
000,000 on account of the Union Pacific
lines, and exceed *21,000,000 on account of
the Central Pacific lines. The situation of
these roads and the condition of their In
debtedness to the government have been
fully set forth in the reports of various
committees to the present and prior con
gresses and as early as 18S7 tbey were
thoroughly examined by a special commis
sion appointed pursuant to an act of con-
?ustment
tress. The considerations requiring an ad
of the government's relations to
the companies have been clearly presented
and the conclusion reached with practlcnl
uniformity, that if these relations are not
terminated they should be revised upon a
basis securing their safe continuance.
Must Take Action.
In the case of the Union Pacific company,
however, the situation has become es
pecially and Immediately urgent. Proceed
ings have been Instituted to foreclose a
first mortgage upon [hose aided parts of
the main lines upon which the govern
ment holds a second and siioordlus te mort
gage lien. In consequence ot those pro
ceedings and increasing complications,
added to the default occurring on the 1st
day of January, 1S97, a condition will be
presented at that date, so far as this com-
Slie
any Is concerned, that must emphasize
mandate of the act of 1887 and give to
executive duty under Its provisions a more
imperative aspect. Therefore, unless con
gress shall otherwise direct or shall have
previously determined upon a different MO
lutlon of the problem, there will hardly ap
pear to exist any reason for delaying be
yond the date of the default abev* men
tioned such executive action as will prom
ise to subserve the public interests and
save the government fr^ni the loss threat
ened by further Inaction.
Department of Agriculture.
The department of agriculture Is so In
timately related to the welfare of our peo
ple and the prosperity oi our nation thut
It should constantly receive the care and
encouragement of the government. From
small beginnings It has. grown to be the
center of agricultural Intelligence and the
source of aid and encouragement to agri
cultural efforts. Large sums of money are
annually appropriated for the maintenance
of this department, and It must be con
fessed that the legislation relating to It
has not always been directly in the Inter
est of practical farming or properly
guarded against waste and extravagance.
So far, however, the public money has been
appropriated fairly and sensibly to help
those who actually till the soil, no ex
penditure has been more profitably made
or more generally approved by the peo
ple.
Shows a Great Saving.
From the report of the secretary It ap
pears that through careful and prudent
flnanctal management he has annually
saved a large sum from his appropriations,
aggregating during his Incumbency and up
to the close of the present fiscal year near
ly one-fifth of the entltp amount appro
priated.
Value of Farm Products.
The secretary reports that the value of
our exports of farm products during the
last fiscal year amounted to *570,000,000,
an Increase of *17,000,000 over those of the
year Immediately preceding. This state
ment Is not the leBs welcome because of
the fact that, notwithstanding such In
crease, the proportion of exported agricul
tural products to our total exports of all
descriptions fell off during the year. The
benefits of an Increase In agricultural ex
ports being assured, the decrease In Its
proportion to our total exports Is the more
gratifying when we consider that it is ow
ing to the fact that such total exportsfor
the year Increased more than *75,000,000.
Opposed to Free Meeds.
In my opinion the gratuitous distribu
tion of seeds by the department as at pres
ent conducted ought to be discontinued.
No one can read tne statement of the sec
retary on this subject and doubt the ex
travagance and questionable results of
this practice.
The Civil Service.
The progress made In civil service re
form furnishes a cause for the utmost con
gratulations. It has survived the doubts
of Its friends as well as the rancor of its
enemies, and has gained a permanent
place among the agencies destined to
cleanse our politics and to Improve, econ
omize and elevate the public service. There
are now in the competitive classified serv
ice upward of 84,000 places. More than half
of those have been Included from time to
time since March 4, 1893. A most radical
and sweeping extension was made by ex
ecutive order dated the 6th day of May,
1896. And If fourth-class postmasterships
are not Included in the statement, It may
be said that practically all positions con
templated by the clvil-servloe law are not
classified. Abundant reasons exist for
Including these postmasterships, based up
on economy, improved service and the
peace ftnd quiet of neighborhoods. If,
however, obstacles prevent such action at
present, I earnestly hope that congress
will, without Increasing post offlce appro
priations, so adjust them as to permit in
proper cases a consolidation of these post
offices, to the end that through this proc
ess the result desired may to a limited ex
tent be accomplished.
Mast Not Be offensive Partisans.
The civil service rules, as amended during
the last year, provide for a sensible and
uniform method of promotion, basing eli
gibility to better positions upon aemon
strated efficiency and faithfulness. The
absence of nxed rules on this subject has
been an Infirmity in the system more and
more apparent as its other benefits have
been better appreciated. The advantages
of civil service methods In their business
aspects are too well understood to require
argument. Their application has become
a necessity to the executive work of the
government. But those who gain positions
through the operation of these methods
should be made to understand that the non
partisan scheme through which they re
ceive their appointments deinanus from
them, by way of reciprocity, nonpartisan
and faithful performance of duty unaer
every administration and cheerful fiueiity
to every chief. While they should be en
couraged to decently exercise their rights
of citizenship and to support through their
suffrages the political beliefs they nonesi
ly profess, the noisy, pestilent anu partisan
employe who loves political turmoil and
contention, or who renders lax and grudg
ing service to the administration not rep
resenting his political views, should be
promptly and fearlessly dealt with in such
a way as to furnish a warning to others
who may be likewise disposed.
Interstate Commerce.
The interstate commerce commission has
during the last year supplleu abunuaut evi
dence of its usefulness and the importance
of the work committed to its charge. l-*ub
11c transportation Is a universal necessity,
and the question of just and reasonable
charges tnerefor has become of vital im
portance, not only to shippers and carriers,
but also'to the vast multitude of producers
and consumers. The justice and equity oi
the principles embodied in the existing law
passed for the purpose of regulating these
charges are everywhere conceded, and there
appears to be no question that the policy
thus entered upon has a permanent place
in our legislation.
Operations of the Tariff Law.
I desire to recur to the statements else
where made concerning the government's
receipts and expenditures for the purpose
ot venturing upon some suggestions touch
ing our present tariff law and Its opera
tion. This statute took effect on the 28th
day of August, 1894. Whatever may be Its
shortcomings as a complete measure of
tariff reform, it must be conceded that it
has opened the way to a freer and greater
exchange of commodities between us and
other countries and thus furnished a
wider market for our products and manu
facturing.
The only entire fiscal year during which
this law has been In force ended on the 30th
day of June, 1896. In that year our Imports
Increased over those of the previous year
more than *8,500,000, while the vain* ot the
domestic products we exported and whlct*
found markets abroad, was nearly IN,-
006.CC9 more than during the preceding year.
Cannot Jiatly Be Ceeds—ed.
Those who Insist that the cost to ovr
people of articles coming to them from
abroad for their needful use should only
be Increased through tariff charges to an
extent necessary to meet the expanses of
the government, as well as those who
claim that tariff charges may be laid upon
such articles beyond tne necessities of gov
ernment revenue, and with the additional
purpose of so Increasing their price in our
markets as to give American
.manufactur
ers and producers better and more profit
able opportunities, must agree that our
tariff laws are only primarily Justified as
sources of revenue to enable the govern
ment to meet the necessary expenses of Its
maintenance. Considered as to Its suffi
ciency In this aspect, the present law can
by no means fall under Just condemnation.
During the only complete fiscal year of
Its operation It nas yielded nearly *8,000,(40
more revenue than was received from
tariff duties In the preceding year. There
was, nevertheless, a deficit between our
receipts and expenditures of a little more
than *25,000,000. This, however, was not
unexpected.
Depression Not Due to the Law.
The situation was sueh In December,
seven months before the close of the fiscal
year, that the secretary of the treasury
foretold a deficiency of *17,000,000. The great
and Increasing apprehension and timidity
In business circles, and the depression In
all activities Intervening since that time,
resulting from causes perfectly well under
stood and entirely disconnected with our
tariff law or Its operation, seriously
checked the imports we would have other
wise received and readily account for the
difference between this estimate of the
secretary and the actual deficiency, as
well as for a continued deficiency. Indeed,
It must be confessed that we could hardly
have had a more unfavorable period than
the last two years for the collection of
tariff revenue.
Believes It Will Prove Success.
We cannot reasonably hope that our re
cuperation from this business depression
will be sudden, but It has already set In
with a promise of acceleration and continu
ance. I believe our oresent tariff law. It
allowed a fair opportunity, will !n the near
future yield a revenue which, with reasona
bly economical expenditures, will overcome
uU deficiencies. In the meantime, no deilclt
that has occurred or may occur nead excite
or disturb us.
tse of the Reserve Lawful,
To meet any such deficit have In the
treasury, lit addition to a golu teserve ot
*100,000,000, a surplus of more than 3128,000,
000 applicable to the payment ot the ex
penses of the government, aid wincb must,
unless expended for that purpose, remain
a useless hoard, or. If not ext.-avaguntly
wasted, must In any event be perverted
from tho purpose ot its exaction from our
people. The payment, therefore, ot any de
ficiency In the revenue from this fund Is
nothing more than Its proper and legiti
mate use.
Vices of Our Financial System.
The reference to the condition and pros
pocts of our revenues naturally suggest*
an allusion to the weakness and vices of
our financial methods. They have been fre
quently pressed upon the attention of con
gress In previous executive communica
tions and the Inevitable danger of their
continued toleration pointed out. Without
now repeating any of these details, 1 can
not refrain from again earnestly presenting
the necessity of the prompt reform of a
system opposed to every rtile of sound
finance and shown by experience to be
fraught with the gravest peril and per
plexity.
The Greenback Should Go.
I am more convinced than ever that we
can have no assured financial peace and
safety until the government currency ob
ligations upon which gold may be de
manded from the treasury are withdrawn
from circulation and canceled. This might
be done, as has been hertofore recom
mended, by their exchange for long-term
bonds bearing a low rate of interest or by
their redemption with the proceeds ot such
bonds.
Kven If only United States notes known
as greenbacks were thus retired, it is
probable that the treasury notes Issued In
payment of sliver purchases under the act
of July 14, 1890, now paid In gold when de
manded, would not create much dis
turbance, as they might from time to tlmo
when received In the treasury by redemp
tion in gold or otherwise be gradually
and prudently replaced by silver coin.
1
Most Effective Path to Heform.
The plan of Issuing bonds for the purpose
of redemption certainly appears to be the
most effective and direct path to the
needed reform.
In default of this, however. It would be
a step in the right direction If currency
obligations redeemable in gold, whenever
so redeemed, should be canceled Instead
of being reissued. This operation would
be a slow remedy, but It would Improve
present conditions.
National banks should redeem their own
notes. They should be allowed to issue
circulation to the par value of bonds de
posited as security for its redemption, and
the tax on their circulation should be re
duced to one-fourth of one per cent.
Seal Source of Danger.
In considering projects for tne retirement
ot United States notes and treasury notes
Issued under the law of 1890, I am of the
opinion that we have placed too much
stress upon the danger of contracting tno
currency and have calculated top little
upon the gold that would be added to ou
circulation if Invited to us by better and
safer financial methods
Must Abandon Banking Business.
The entire case may be presented by the
statement that the day of sensible and
sound financial method will not dawn upon
us until our government abandons the
banking business and the accumulation of
funds and confines Its monetary operations
to the recclpt of the money contributed by
the people for Its support and to the ex
penditure ot such money for the people a
benefit.
Hot Shot for Trusts.
Another topic In which our people right
fully take a deep Interest may be her*
briefly considered. 1 refer to the existence
of trusts and other huge aggregations pt
cupital, the object of which is to secure th«
monopoly of some particular branch of
trade, Industry or commerce, and so stifle
wholesome competition. When these are
defended. It Is usually on the ground that
though they increase profits, tney also re
duce prices, and thus may benefit the public.
It must bs remembered, however, that a
reduction of prlccs to the people Is not ono
ot the real objects of these organisations,
nor is their tendency necessarily in that
direction. If it occurs in a particular case.
It Is only because It accords with the pur
pose or interests of those managing the
scheme. Such occasional results fall far
short of compensating the palpable evils
charged to the account of trusts and mo
nopolies.
Laws Inefficient for Their Control.
To the Instinctive belief that such Is the
Inevitable trend of trusts and monopolies
Is due the widespread and deep-seated pop
ular aversion In which they are held and
the not unreasonable Insistence that,
whatever may be their incidental econ
omic advantages, their general effect
upon personal character, prospects and
usefulness cannot bo otnervlse than
lniurlous. Though congress has at
tempted to deal with this matter by leg
islation the laws passed for that purpose
thus far have proved Ineffective, not be
cause of any lack of disposition or attempt
to enforce them, but simply because the
laws themselves as Interpreted by the
courts do not reach the difficulty. If tho
insufficiencies of existing laws can be
remedied by further legislation it should
be done.
States Should Take Effective Action.
It should be recognized, however, thut
all federal legislation on this subject may
fall short of its purpose because of inherent
obstacles and also because of the complex
character of our governmental system,
which, while making tho federal authori
ty supreme within its sphere, has carefully
limited that sphere by bounds which can
not be transgressed. The decision of our
highest court on this precise question ren
ders It quite doubtful whether the evila
of trusts and monopolies can be ade
auately treated through federal action, un
less they seek directly and purposely to
include In their objects transportation
or intercourse between states or between
the United States and foreign" countries.
It does not follow, however, that this Is the
limit of the remedy that may be applied.
Even though it may be found that federal
authority Is not broad enough to fully
reach the case, there can be no doubt of the
power of the several states to act effec
tively In the premises.
A Plea for Blgid Economy.
1% concluding tnis communication. Its
last words shall be an appeal to the con
gress for the most rigid economy in the ex
penditure ot the money it holds in trust
For the people. The way to perplexing ex
travagance is easy, but a return to fru
gality is difficult. When, however, it is
considered that those who bear the bur
dens of taxation have no guarantee ot
honest care save in the fidelity of their
public servants, the duty of all possible re*
trenchment Is plainly manifest.
