BUTLER CITIZEN
JOHN H. L W. C. NE6LEY, PROP'RS,
Entered at the Post office at Butle7 as
second-classs matter.
DEC. 12, 1883.
THE~ Court House fire has delayed
the issuing of the CITIZEN and prevent
ed some matters from appearing this
week.
IN answer to the inquiry of a friend,
we would state that the last Congress
was Republican, and Keifer, Speaker of
game, was Republican. The present
Congress is Democratic.
S. S. MEHARD, ESQ., has been ap
pointed by the Governor President
Judge of Mercer county, to fill out the
unexpired term of Judge McDermitt,
dee'd. Mr. Mehard is the law part
ner of James A. Stranahan, Esq of
Mercer, who it is said favored his ap
pointment. He is represented as well
qualified and a lawyer of good stand
ing for probity and honesty. His time
to serve will be to January, 1, 1885,
an election taking place next fall for
the regular term.
FURIOUS FLAMES.
Butler Court House in Ruins.
About 8 o'clock Tuesday morning
fire was 6een issuing from the top of
one of the chimney flues of the Court
House The flue from which the fire
came was one of those up stairs in the
room in which Court is held, from
the smoke on the roof of the building
it was soon apparent hidden fire was
between the ceiling and the roof. The
firemen were promptly upon the ground
and did all possible to save the building,
but all efforts failed and the whole
building was soon wrapped in flames.
At this writing, 12M., Tuesday, noth
ing but the columns in front and the
brick walls remain to tell the extent of
the ruins. The records, we are glad to
say, are all saved—a few may be dam
aged, but none we think are lost. All
the adjoining buildings, around the
Diamond, are sayed. When the flames
reached the cupola and the statue of
General Butler the scene was as sad as
it was grand. We understand insurance
to the amount of $30,000 is upon the
building. The Court, being in session
this week, was removed for the time to
the M. E. Church. Three accidents.we
believe are all that happened—Mr. Ed
ward Wevgand had his eyes badly in
jured by the water from the hose, near
the nozzle, being suddenly thrown in
his face. Mr. Curtis Smith fell some
distance in attempting to climb up in
the inside ot the building in Bearch of
the fire and has a sprained limb. Mr.
Charles Heineman also received some
injury from falling plaster.
The present Court House was com
menced in the year 1853, thirty years
ago, finished in 1854, and, we think, first
occupied in Dec. of that year or winter
of 1855.
President's Message.
The readers of the CITIZEN will find
upon its first page those portions of the
recent Message of President Arthur to
Congress that we deemed of most in
terest to them. The parts that are
not given are mainly concerning our
affairs with certain foreign countries.
As the extras, called supplements, that
are now annually offered to the press
and used by some as a means of circu
lating the annual message of the Presi
dent, have been found often very in
correct, and are printed in such small
type, we have declined to use them,
preferring to giye it in what we know
most of our readers desire, a larger
type, and being therefore more easily
read.
As to the message itself, the general
complaint is that it is non-committal
on the questions of most importance to
the people at the present time. It is
difficult to find out just what his opin
ions are on the currency and financial
questions of the day. The part of the
message most interesting to the people
will probably lie the closing one, rela
tive to the succession to the Presidency,
in certain contingencies. It is a most
earnest hope of all that Congress will
not suffer this session to pass without
enacting a law more clearly defining,
not only the mode of electing the Pres
ident and counting the electoral vote,
but also that clause of the Constitution
which speaks of the "inability" of the
President to fill his office. The recent
events of the country demand this
legislation in order to secure its peace
and permanence.
How They Voted.
All three of the members from this
county in the Legislature, Messrs.
Greer, Donly and Ziegler voted for the
salary bill, paying full expenses for the
continued or called session. They also
voted to pass the bill ever the head of
the Governor after his veto of it. Mr.
Donly, we see it stated, returned to the
Treasury $170.50, which, wo under
stand, was the amount of the 11 dayß
recess taken at the commencement of the
session and five days absence. Mr.
Greer returned SIOO tor, we presume,
days of rece6B taken "at the commence
ment of the session. We see no
mention made in bis account of any
days of absence. This perhaps was
because those days were, as the vendue
bills says, "too numerous to mention."
As to Mr. Ziegler, so far as we have
seen, he appears to have not presented
bis warrant at the Treasury as yet.
Since writing the above we see by
the Philadelphia Times of Saturday
last that Senator Greer returned but
SIOO to the State and Representative
Donly but sllO. The amount of the
warrant presented at the Treasury by
Greer was for $1,950, and that of Mr.
Donly was for $1,940. Mr. Ziegler's
warrant is for the same amount as that
of Mr. Donly, but, as is stated, has not
4>eet» presented as yet.
THE (iOYERNOR'S VETO.
HE SENDS IN A SCATHING
MESSAGE TO THE LEG
ISLATURE—NO AP
PORTIONMENT,
NO PAY.
Members' Flagrant Disregard of
Duty. The Grounds for
Withholding his
Signature.
Fr >a> Harritburg papers, Dec. G.]
The scene in the House Tuesday
morning was a lively one. Almost i
every member was present and the j
chamber appeared more as it did in the
early days of the regular sessions than
it has since the beginning of the extra
session. It was all taik about pay-
That a veto message would be receiv
ed there seemed not the slightest doubt.
It was impossible to tell what the out
come would be should such a paper be
received At 11:30 the Speakers
gavel fell and order was secured. The
private secretary of the Governor was
introduced and presented a communi
cation from the Governor of the Com
monweath. It was laid upon the table
and routine business taken up. It
was the hour of noon before the mess
age was read. It appeared to amuse
the majority in the House and if a vote
had been taken then there is but little
doubt but that the bill would have been
passed. A motion to postpone was
made and debated at considerable
length, and at one o'clock, it was de
cided to adjourn until 4, when the bill
was considered section by section and
was passed over the head of the Go\-
ernor by a large majority in both
branches. The veto message in full is
appended:
EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, COMMON
WEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, OFFICE
OF THE GOVERNOR, II ARRIS BURG, Dec.
4, 1883— To the llouseof Represent
atives of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania GENTLEMEN : ln
accordance with the authority given to
the Governor to disapprove of any
items of an appropriation bill I disap
prove of all the items in the herewith
returned bill, except those items in
Section 3, providing for the pay of cer
tain employees of the Senate, and items
in Section 4 for the pay of certain em
ployees of the House, and Section T
for the expense of serving a writ of
election to fill a vacancy in the House
of Representatives. To ail the other
items of the bill I decline to give my
approval
The members of the General Assem
bly were convened in special session
for the sole purpose of apportioning
the State as commanded by the Con
stitution. The command was upon
them to pass such laws at the regular
session, but they adjourn*! a few days
after their right to pay ceased, with
their sworn constitutional duty unper
formed. They were immediately re
called into session to obey the organic
law, to keep their oaths, and to accord
to the people the most important politi
cal rights. They again deliberately re
fuse to perform their constitutional
duty and are about to adjourn. After
wasting six months in contemning the
Constitution, they now send me this
bill, appropriating over half a million
dollars to pay themselves lor refusing
to do what they were elected and
sworn to do. Every consideration of
law and the simplest principles of com
mon justice protest against such an at
tempt to take the money of the people
without consideration. There is no
law authorizing public officers to pay
themselves for defying the law. Such
an inconsistency could not exist in the
jurisprudence of any enlightened trov
ernment. No citizen in his private
business capacity would sanction such
a principle as that underlying this bill.
The fact that one has been elected by
the people to an office does not of itself
entitle him to pay. He must first per
form the duties of his office. As well
might a judge claim his salary who re
fuses to hold court or try the causes be
fore him. The members of this Legis
lature have refused to do their duty in
compliance with the command of the
Constitution, the vow of their official
oath, and the purpose of their elcctiou.
When this session was convened, in
stead of proceeding at once to perforin
their duty, the members of the Legisla
ture, for their personal convenience, im
mediately took a recess for eleven days.
By this bill every Legislator is given
of the people's money ten dollars a day
for each day of that recess. To sanction
this would be to admit that they might
have taken a recess for the year and a
half remaining of their terms, and have
paid themselves many thousands of
dollars each, while remaining at their
homes and attending to their private
concerns. For over one-half the time
since the Legislature was convened the
Senate has not been in session at all,
having by formal resolution deliber
ately resolved not to sit, or make an
effort to obey the law. On many of
the days when it did hold sessions but
a few minutes were occupied, and no
single official act was done looking to a
performance of duty. The record of
the House of Representatives upon this
subject white no so culpable is yet
highly reprehensible, it not having held
sessions for many days. Yet for the
whole one hundred and eighty-two
days, from Juue 7 to December 5,
whether days of session, no session, or
sham sessions, Lord's days aud holi
days, for all alike, ten dollars a day for
the entire time, is given by this bill to
every Senator and Member.
Monstrous as such a claim would be
under any circumstances, it is yet the
more repugnant to law, equity ar»d
common sense, when asserted by offi
cials who menace the very existence of
Republican Government by refusing to
obey the plainest an I most imperative
of constitutional commands and give to
the people the most sacred and valuable
of political rights. This bill exacts to
the last penny all the compensation
that the most faithful, industrious,
patriotic and law-obeying Legislators
could get for the performance of every
dutv imposed upon them and the reali
zation of every public benefit that could
be expected from them,
Under this bill mileage is claimed by
members and officials for going from
their homes to the seat of government
aud returning, who were present in
Harrisburg when tbe extra session was
called, having been paid by tho State
to be there, aud who have also been al
ready paid for returning to their homes.
So, too, ten dollars a day i* claimed by
this bill for sessions upon days when,
to use the language of the law, there
were no sessions held "at" which
members could be.
It would be useless for uie to go over
tbis bill and discuss its unjust pro
visions in detail, it is a most indelens
ible attempt to take money out of the
public treasury without warrant of law,
shadow of justice, or possibility of right
bv a body of officials which, as the Ex
ecutive of the Commonwealth, I am
obliged to say resists, defies and as
saults the constitutional government of
the people.
There often come times in the history
of popular government when the only
hope of their preservation rests, not
in the functional power given to offi
cials, but in that last and mightiest of
resources, the intelligent and resolute
action of a free people at the ballot box.
This hope alone is left to the lovers of
free government in Pennsylvania lor
the enforcement of the laws and the
preservation of the Constitution. I
have exhausted all my power to that
end without avail, aud confess the
futility of my efforts. Not only may I
be unable to secure obedience to the
Constitution and see that the laws be
faithfully executed, but I may also be
powerless to prevent the gross injustice
attempted against the people in this
bill. So far as lam able, however, I
shall thwart the wrong by this disap
proval.
It is only right for me to say that
there are, 1 know, many members of
the Assembly who have faithfully
striven to perform their duty, and who
by such efforts have equitably earned
their pay. They are in no wise charge
able with the default of this session. I
regret that they should suffer by this
veto. It is their misfortune to be mem
bers of a body whose acts I must view
as a whole. They will have the con
sciousness, however, of having honest
ly tried to serve their State and the
people. The people it is certain will
not fail in the end to recognize and re
ward upright servants and separate
them from the faithless and avaricious.
I have no power to distinguish the
worthy from the unworthy, the deserv
ing from the reprehensible. The fault
of the gross, not the merit of individuals,
is all of which I can take notice.
Seeing no legal reason, however, for
depriving of their pay the employees of
the two houses, whose attendance was
compulsory, and who are in no way
blameable for tbe failure of this session,
[ have approved the items for their
compensation. 1 wish to be under
stood, however, in allowing these items
to approve of the compensation ot these
employees only for those days when
they were necessarily employed about
the duties of their offices. They may
have had official service to perform
upon davs on which the Legislature
was not in session If so they should
be pa d. But for those days on which
they were absent from attendance upon
duties pertaining to the Legislature
and unemployed I do not give my
sanction to their drawing any compen
sation. I regard the word "fixed by
law" in the clause of the bill making
tbe approp. iation for them asrecogniz
ing"this limitation, which, in my judg
ment, is a proper interpretation of tbe
act of 1874.
ROBERT E. PATTISON.
Hox. THOMAS M. BAVNE, member
in Congress from Allegheny county,
has introduced a joint resolution pro
posing an amendment to the Constitu
tion of the United States, providing
for the election by the people of post
masters, U. S. District Attorneys and
Revenue Collectors. This is a move
in the right direction and one that the
public will strongly endorse. Particu
larly in the matter of postmasters has
there been a very general sentiment all
over the country for their election by
the people in the locality interested.
.Mr. Bayne's bill will be watched with
interest. Although tbe road to its
adoption is a long one, yet by active
and continued exertion it is hop
ed the effort will succeed.
Parker Township Items.
One of tbe school bouses of this twp.,
commonly know as the Daubenspeck
school, was burnt to the ground last
Tuesday night. It is supposed by
some, to have been an act of incendiar
ism, but "no telling." It was a great
loss, however, to the people of that dis
trict, as about one hundred and fifty
dollars worth of books was lost, and it
is well known this school hod tbe best
books of any in the township. We
must add that tbe Directors have ex
hibited a surprising lack of energy in
regard to getting tho school in running
order again.
It was a rather naughty act of the
young 1 man "across the hollow," brush
ing the old crippled soldier, we would
rather not tell such a story and won't.
It is said that one of the oldest news
boys in America, lives at Bruin, and
soils the Sunday Leader —and where
does it lead to ?
Merchants here are filling up with a
nice display of Holiday goods.
G. W. Daubenspeck, .Jap, W. Orr
and W. C. Parker of this township are
attending Court this week as Jurors.
Last week Win. M. Emerick and John
McX amara were the honered ones.
a feeling of Christian unity
seems to be prevailing among the peo
ple of this place, and especially is it so
among the ministers who have charges
ia this place.
J. M. Coulter has finished the water
wheel and dam, for running Wolfs
wells along the creek and it is said
works well and will be a vast saving
to the owner in the end.

JAMES NUTT'S TRIAL.
BUT THREE JURORS SECURED
Out of a Panel of Eighty, the Court
Decides that Fayette County
is Biased
AND TRANSFERS THE CASE
TO PITTSBURGH.
UNIONTOWN, Dec. s.—Xo Fayette j
county jury will determine the fate of j
.lames Nutt. After exhausting the i
largest panel of jurors ever drawn in ,
the county, the Court this afteruooii
granted a motion on the part of tbe de
fense for a ehanj;e of venue, aod fixed
Pittsburgn as tbe place of trial.
When the prisoner was arraigned at
9 o'clock this morning the court room,
within the bar, gave a fairly accurate
picture of the Duke's trial reversed
The short, strong figure aDd fat fea
tures of the defendant in the former
case are now mouldered down upon
his bones in the little burying ground
in German township. In his place in
the dock this morning a taller, slender
er figure lifted another smooth, young
face up before the eyes of the Clerk of
Courts, the face and figure of a young
man who pleaded "not guilty to the
cbarg* of murdering the man who bad
risen up from the same chair less than
a year ago to plead "not guilty" of
murderiug tbe father of the present
defendant. The same clerk read the
indictment to each, and gave to each
with equal apparent fervor his official
benediction, "God seud you a good de
liverance." Judge Wilson sit again
upon tbe bench, no more delicate or
dyspeptic looking now than then Be
side him to-day, however, was his soon
to be successor, Judge-elect lugbram
Ab'jut the prisoner were grouped the
same faces that surrounded the Com
monwealth table at the trial of Dukes
W. 11. Play ford, strong and earnest,
with his hair rampant as ever above
his forehead; beside him A. D. Boyd,
young and blonde and handsome. Be
side the prisoner, her long crape veil
sweeping bis knee, as she leaued fre
quently over to whisper to him, was
his mother, the widow of Captain
Nutt. Tbe dead Captain's brother,
whose resemblance to him was so
remarked upon at the last trial sat
near her, by her side with another
brother and one of hers, James Wells.
THE COUNSEL FROM ABROAD.
Added to these familiar figures were
three others. Opposite the prisoner,
towering above all about him, Senator
Voorhees of Indiana, the tall syca
more, sat, his bands crossed upon his
knees, his eyes intently study the face
of each juror as he was called. Ex
changing whispers occasionally with
Voorhees, Major A. M. Brown sat be
tween tbe big Senator and tbe white
haired man with the Emperor William
face and whiskers, Marshall Svvartz
welder. The prisoner was scarcely so
calm, so stolid, rather, as the man
whose verdict of acquittal he reversed.
His lips trembled occasionally during
the first half hour, and he fidgeted
nervously at times in bis chair.
At tbe Commonwealth table sat the
same District Attorney who had pros
ecuted Dukes; at bis elbow young
John whose father's shrewed
speech let Dukes go free to his death;
at the other side of the table I) F. Pat
terson, who had been brought up from
Pittsburg to meet the shock of the
heavy artillery upon the other side.
Behind them, "carefully nursing his silk
hat of ancient black and frizzly surface
upon his knees, spare and stooped,
with a thin face and forehead looking
over the back of bis bead, sat ol 1 As
bury Struble, the step father of N. L.
Dukes, and beside him Lewis Dukes,
tbe dead man's brother. Mrs. Struble
was not present.
From the moment tbe crier called
Wm. L. Stewart, clerk, of George twp.,
the first juror, out of tbe crowd that
throng, d the Court room from bar rail
ing to door, unlil 3 o'clock this after
nooD, when Play ford rose, after the
last name had been called, and ac
knowledging the impossibility of get
ting an impartial jury in Fayette
county, moved for a change of venue,
it was a series of dreary, uninteresting
repetitions of the same questions and
the same answers.
JURORS WHO WOULDN'T DO.
Win. L. Stewart, clerk, of George
township, had formed an opinion. He
would do his best, if sworn, to try the
ea.se upon the evidence, but it would
require some evidence to turn him from
his present opinion The Judge laid
down the rule which he followed
through the panel, that if it would re
quire any of the evidence to be con
sumed in driving Out a present impres
sion the man having such an impression
was unfit to try a case of such grave
importance. Such an acknowledgement
from a juror he ruled to be sufficient
disqualification, and challenges upon it
were invariably sustained. Clerk
Stewart was challenged fur cause. So
was the next man, Elisha llickard, a
sturdy country blacksmith, who declar
ed that his opinion was so lirmly fixed
that no amount of testimony could
change it. William I'atton, a bald
headed carpenter who cauip next, would
have served, but he lives in the section
of the county in which Captain Nutt
used to reside, aiul the prosecution bar
red him out of the box with one of the
four peremptory challenges allowed
them. The defense didn't iike the
hard, stern features of the next man.
.John llanan, an old Dunbar farmer,
and challenged him peremptorily. And
so it went on. The sixth man called,
Thomas J. Conn, a country merchant,
the handsomest man in the panel, had
peculiar ideas about capital punishment,
but so long as the law stood he would
find a veidict in accordance with it and
the facts. The prosecution didn't seem
to admire his peculiar ideas and stood
him aside, to challenge him peremptori
ly at last, when the panel was exhaust
ed and he came up again Harvey
Coburn, an old white haired farmer in
a blue coat and brass buttous, who was
called niqth, had no opinion now at all,
hadn't talked about the case iu llusted's j
grocery store nor to Lewis Dawson, j
but the defense challenged him per- j
emptorily. Playford smiled across to |
the other table when the prosecuti n ,
challenged Christopher Holsley for
cat}ge. liolsley is a bitter Searight j
Democrat.
THE LONESOME TI|HE|-,.
Finally at the twenty-eighth name, |
that of Win. A. McDowell, ex-editor of;
the Qpnius of fjibcrly, a \ ale College
graduate and a njan of general intelli
gence, a Democrat, but not a Searight
partisan, both sides for the lirst time
said, "let him be sworn," and he took
his place in the box. When the court
adjourned foruinnerat 1 o'clock, he still j
sat alone in tbe box. Fifty-eight of the j
80 names in the panel had been drawn j
without finding another satisfactory
juror. Then the lawyers began to talk
cf a change of venue. Voorhees said
at dinner that be did not believe 12 im
partial men could be found to try this j
case in Fayette county, and cited a j
somewhat similar case in Kentucky in j
which Speaker Carlisle was concerned, !
when the jurors had to be drawn from
an adjoiir-g county. Court met again j
in the i f t-ruoon and exhausted the
pant! without getting another juror on !
the first call. Two of the four stood j
aside, Martin Mitchell, a farmer who j
would rather not hang a man but wouid
follow the evidence, and John Conn, a
carpenter, whom tbe prosecution had
attempted to turn away for cause—
these were accepted, making three iu
all. The defense had challenged five
peremptorily and the prosecution three.
Two were disqualified by conscientious
scruples about capital punishment. All
the others bad formed opinions about
the guilt or innocense of the prisoner.
Among them all one man, an old labor
er from Upper Tyrone, Abraham Stew
art, had not read anything about tbe
case in the papers and had no opinion.
The defense hesitated and consulted.
Finally Playford asked: "Wasn't
your father's name Hamilton?" "No,
it was John," was the answer. "Chal
lenged peremptorily," from Mr. Play
ford.
THE CASE SENT TO PITTSBURG.
When the panel was exhausted Mr.
Playford moved for a change of venue,
citing the experience of the day as evi
dence that it was almost if not quite
impossible to get a jury in Fayette
county. James Wells, Mrs. Nutt's
brother, made tbe affidavit required by
the act of Assembly, in which he
simply testified to the efforts made in
court to secure a jary, and gave his
opinion that it would be impossible to
get one.* The prisoner petitioned
formally in writing for the change of
venue. Voorhees and Brown each
made a brief speech, urging the gravity
of the issue, danger in selecting a jury
by extraordinary means, and the strong
partisan feeliug evidently present in
Fayette county. The prosecution made
no opposition to the motion and tbe
Court granted it. There was some
discussion over the selection of tbe
county to which the case should be
taken, Patterson and Johnson for the
Commonwealth objecting to Allegheny
upon the ground that the Pittsburgh
newspapers bad given such full reports
of the previous events that public
opinion was as thoroughly made up
there as in Fayette, they would be sat
isfied with anv other county. Voorhees
and Brown urged the convenience of
Pittsburgh and the opportunity to give
the defendant a speedy trial, to which
he had a right. Tbe Court agreed with
them and said there was no doubt an
impartial jury could be obtained in Al
legheny county, and made the order
accordingly.
The prisoner and bis friends express
ed themselves much pleased with the
change and the selection, and the gen
eral feeling iu town is oue of gratifica
tion and expectation of an acquittal.
It was decided this evening by coun
sel to take up the case in Pittsburgh
the first week of January. The Cornet
band here serenaded Senator Yoorhees,
A. M. Brown and Marshall Swartz
welder this evening. The former and
latter made short addresses, which
were cheered loudly by the large crowd
present.

f'H'jw long did you say?"
"Twenty yparw, I *aid. I'p t<» the time I
mentioned J huj sqff'-rc I I'r 'ii| dis.'.U-'d liver
for twenty years," said Mr. T. S, Hancock, of
Richmond, Va., naif sadly, as though thinking
of that dilapidated section of his life. "At
times I almost wishpd it had pleased providence
to omit the liver from the h 14man anatomy."
"IJad enough—twenty years of that sort of
thing," responded a listener. "What was the
upshot ol it?"
"The upshot was that some time ago I went
down to Scott's drug store in this city, and
bought one of Benson's Capcine Porous (Mas
ters, applied it and was relieved in a few hours,
and am now as sou ml as though my liver were
luaiie of india-rubber."
Benson's—unlike the old kind of plasters—
act promptly. Look for the word CAPCINE,
which is cut in the genuine. Price 25 refits.

ON THE QUESTION OF
LARGE VS. SMALL STORES.
That a large business cat be conducted under considerable less expense than a small one (difference in receipts considered), no ona win gives
the subject a moments tho-u-h: wilt deuy; an 1 nowhere can a better illustration of the truth of this statement be found than with ourselves. We
have tic largest CLOTHING, HAT and' GENTS' FCRNISHISG GOODS Store in America. Our eleven spacious silesroo-.is (not counting in our
Wholesale Departments) are e jual to
ELEVEN GRAND STORES IN ONE.
Our daily sales are Ave times greater than any store in our line. Tbe prices we ask for goods are from 20 to 33 per cent, below all competition
and in many instances 50 per cant can be saved. Tbat is not mere assertion, a visit to and through our house will prove it. It is the aggregate of
our sales and quality of goods bought, and not the protit of a single transaction, which enables us to
UNDERSELL ALL SMALLER COMPETITORS !
