New Greenback Depository at Niles.
One of the manufacturing establish
ments of Niles baying disbursed con
siderable money to their workmen, last
week, one received in the neighborhood
of one hundred and seventy-five dollars,
and wended his way homeward rumina
ting, like Mehitable Ann, on the many
fine dresses, shoes, etc, it would pur
chase for his wife and bairns.. But
place of safe deposit must be sought, out
of the reach of thieves, who break in
and steal. Hia fertile brain actively at
work suggested a coal scuttle containing
coal, and here his possessions found
place and soon his mind was at rest
Whether hia wife -was informed of the
new found safe, we can not say, but du
ring the night she arose and deposited
the contents of the scuttle on the fire,
while her liege lord was dreaming the
happy hours away. The denouement, in
the morning, when facts were disclosed,
the reader may imagine.

Elopement.
A case of the above character is report
ed to us as occurring within the precincts
of South in gton, on Tuesday night of last
week. The circumstances as far as we
could learn are the following: A man
named Samuel Eyster, of Boardman,
Mahoning county, who is a husband and
lather, visited the township of Southing
ton, in the capacity of a canvasser for
books. During his stay in that neigh
borhood he stopped at the house of a
Mr. Anthony, they being relatives of his
wife. While here Eyster succeeded in
winning the affections of a young lady, a
daughter of Anthony, and proposed an
elopement, which was acceeded to by
the lady, the parties coming to Warren
and putting up at the Austin House ; but
her father missing her and Eyster, sup
posed all was not right, and came to
Warren, where he found hia daughter
and entreated her to return with him,
which abe promised to do; but a note
from Eyster, who had sought refuge in
another part of the town, informed her
they would be taken to GarrettaTille by
a privata conveyance which would be
in waiting at a certain locality. Absent
ing herself from her father, which be
supposed would be but a moment, she
sought the place mentioned in the note,
and was taken to Garrettaville. Whith
er the runaways have gone, we are not
informed. The character of the young
lady is said to hav been good.

aads, "unfortunately for said incorporation,
they are not to be found within Its limits nor
indeed in tue Biaie. out in an adjacent eoau

can be given to prove the assertion. If neces

too much trouble to satisfy the whims of our
worthy correspondent. In regard to Govern

ernment lands here worth from $75 to $400
per acre, and are governed by men who
know their business and don't take nalns to
attend to other neoDle's affairs. The man
that came here for government lands got on

Editor Chboficxs : In your last week's
Issue I noticed a statement from of M es-
potamia. giving the amount of corn raised
this season by a venerable old gentleman.
who Der formed the entire amount of labor at
the ripe ut of seventy-one years. Also In
this week's issue Is a statement of the
amount raised by 8. w. Irwin, and thinks
that "Uncle Tim" will have to try again.
Bat Farmer falls to mention one very im
portant Item. He does not give the age of
Mr. lrwin.or now mucn assistance ne naa in
performing the labor. As oar worthy friend
wishes "the old greyheaded larks of Tram
bull" to state what they are doing. I will
state a few items of labor performed by the
writer of this article the past season. He Is
sixty-three years of age.and partially a crip
ple caused by a broken limb, and is necessi
tated to labor in more or leas constant pain.
In addition to milking six cows morning
and evening, without a single failure, tend
ing a garden which has yielded an abundant
supply of various kinds of sauce; planting,
hoeing and harvesting three acres of corn
and one-half acre of potatoes and beans, with
only one day's additional help, he has eat
fifteen acre of grass of fair growth, doing all
the work by hand. Has ground his own
scythe, holding it on the stone with one
hand and turning with the other. Has
mowed, a oread, raked, cocked od. Ditched on
and loaded, pitched off and mowed away the
entire amount with but one-half day's as
sistance. Though he Is com pai led to yield
the palm to his venerable friend as to the
amount of corn to the acre, he thinks perns pa
be can compete with him as to the amount
of labor performed during the season. In
conclusion, hs would modestly enquire who.
In old Trumbull, at bis see, has done better?

To the foregoing, the editor would add that
the writer of the above Is one of the neatest
and most elegant penman In the county.
