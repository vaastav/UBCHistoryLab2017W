ST. LOI'IP. Mo., Dec. If. —A fire start
ed In the basement of the building oc
cupied by the Mermod & Jaccard Jew
elry company, at the corner of Locust
and Broadway, early this morning, and
ln an almost Incredibly short time the
five-story building was completely gut
ted. The total loss will reach $335,000,
fully covered by insurance.
The flre had been burning some time
before it was discovered at 4:40 oclock,
and at 5 oclock the south wall and all
the floors began falling, making it one of
the fiercest fires In the annals of the city.
Next to the boiler room in the basement
was a room used for packing. It is
thought the fire started In the boiler
room, communicated to the packing
room, and, shooting up elevator
shaft, quickly spread over the building.
W. A. Rutledge, the engineer, and his
family lived on the fourth floor. They
barely escaped with their lives. Th?
firemen dragged them unconscious from
their beds and carried them down the
fire escap?. Five ir.ir.utes later the floors
fell. Several other tenants in the build
ing had narrow escapes.
The Mermod & Jaccard Jewelry com
pany was one of th? largest In the world,
nnd, being Christmas season, carried an
Immense stock. One-half of the stock
had been placed in the two large vaults
und was saved, but the rest, ns well as
the building and It? fixtures, was totally
destroyed.
Tha Mermod'A Jaccard company oc
cupied but two floors and the basement
of the structure. On the lifth door was
the repair shop. A large amount of the
repair work had been finished, and most
of it was savec? by the salvage corp3.
The corps also saved a dozen or more
grandfather clocks ranging In value
from $500 to $1800 each, and many old
Vienna vases and valuable pieces of pot
tery. Ihe silverware, melted by the
heat, will be found under the debris of
fallen tlmher. On the first floor, left out
of the valuts, were clocks, silverware,
china, art pottery, cut glassware and
other articles, all of which will be a total
loss. There were over forty tenants ln
the building, whose losses range from
$500 to $iOOO, partially insured,
The Model Cloak company, in the
northeast corner of the building, was
wiped out, sustaining a loss of $,'O,OOO, on
which there was an insurance of three
fourths.
The firm carried Insurance amounting
to $(00,000, which, if the stock in the
vaults Is found intact, will amply cover
the loss sustained.
The building was owned by the estate
of tho into Luther M. Kennett, but was
under leasa to the Mermod & Jaccard
company. The firm estimates the value
of the building at $125,000, upon which
there was an Insurance of $105,000.
Late tonight th» burned-out firm de
cided to continue business, nnd tomorrow
will take possession of the store and
stock of another leading Jeweler of this
city, which they have bought. The firm
that goes out of business is that of A.
Lutzborn & Sans.
AT GRAND FORKS
GRAND FORKS, N. D„ Dec. 10.—The
business portion of the city was threat
ened by another flre tonight, which
might have been more destructive than
that of Friday, when the Hotel Dacotah,
the Mercantile company and Nash
Bros.' butlings were burned.
Shortly after € oclock smoke was seen
coming from the first floor of the big de
partment store of Benner &. Bepg, and
ln less than fifteen minutes the building
was in flames and the fire had spread to
Btahchfleld's clothing house and the H.
A. Stone Jewelry store In buildings ad
adjoining.
After three hours' work the fire was
subdued. The damage to the building
$55,000. Losses to other films will be
and stock of Benner & Begg will be
small.

CHINESE RAILROADS
PROVIDE NO EMPLOYMENT FOR
FOREIGNERS
■ L
Consul General Goodnow Warns Amer
icans Against Going to China
in Search of Work
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.—The first
report to the state department from
United States Consul General Goodnow,
it Shanghai, contains a warning to
American railroad men not to go to
China for employment. Says he: "The
American only Invites starvation who
-tomes here without a definite contract
of employment with some reputable firm
,nade before he leaves America. I must
nlvlse United States railway employe.'
that there is at present no market for
heir labor in China, and should more
roads be constructed there will bo a
market only if these roads are built by
Americans."
The consul general says he has had
many inquiries from Americans as to
he chance for employment in China, so
he describes the small Chinese railroad
systems to show the hopelessness of
looking ln that direction for work. There
are only two railways in operation, with
a total mileage of iiW-a miles. They em
ploy only twenty-seven foreigners, of
whom four are engineers, and the man
agers and division superintendents. The
operatives are practically all Chinese
and a foreigner cannot compete with
litem. The highest salaried natives are
the telegraph operators at $40 per month.
Engineers get $20 to 1.10 and train hands
and track men $6 to $10 per month. All
of this is In Mexican silver, worth 41
cents, gold, on the dollar. The reads
are paying 15 per cent dividends.
Another road Is under construction
from Shanghai to Woo Sung, fourteen
miles, and Chinese are doing all of the
work, and on December ISth the first
sod was turned on the projected road
from Hankow to Peking, the comple
tion of which depends upon the success
"' the Belgian syndicate in floating its
loan.
Mr. Gootlnow recounts the ambitious
schemes of Director Sheng of the Im
perial railways to create a vast system
of railways In central China, and en
closes a map showing the projects. He
says Sheng's plan is to build these roads
as money ran be borrowed outside of
China. He proposes to couple with the
railway loans a government loan of
$■50,000,000 to pay the balance of the Jap
anese war (indemnity. In this way the
option of building the Chinese roads
would be held out to the parties taking
the government loan and the support of
foreign governments for the govern
ment would be secured by allowing the
syndicate to furnish all the materia!
and skilled labor needed for the rail
roads. Mr. Qoodnow points out that
under thesa conditions there will be no
market for American railway material
or labor unless Americans furnish the
money to build the railways.

EVES MADE A MORE VALIANT
STRUGGLE
■
In the Good Time Coming the Reform

vssoolated Press Special Wire.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 19.—William
Lloyd Garrison, the well-known Boston
reformer, addressed the Ethical society
today on the life, character and work
.f Henry George, whom he character
ized as one of the greatest men of all
time. He said in part:
"Never did kings of old fight more
valiantly to win back the Holy Land
from the Saracen than did Henry
George to win his country from pauper
ism. Long after we are gone, men will
contemplate from varying points of
View thi3 Alpine peak of moral force.
"The sunset of the nineteenth century
will presage with added glory the com
ing of the twentieth, because he lived,
thought and wrote."
The speaker briefly rehearsed the
main facts of Henry George's earlier
life and said It was while he was in Cal
ifornia, in its turbulent nnd primitive
period, that his great work, "Progress
and Poverty," grew upon his hands and
eventually came forth like a revolution
Mr. Garrison referred to Herbert
Spencer's rebuff of Geoerge, "whom he
should have welcomed as the brightest
jewel in his diadem," and continuing,
said: "When it became manifest that
Progress and Poverty' was the bugle
blast of one deeply in earnest the battle
raged. George's demand for the Imme
diate restoration of land to those who
were starving by Its misappropriation
was a heresy not to be tolerated, for
vested rights and privileges were en
dangered by such teachings. Land
owners were stirred to their moral
depths and cried out 'Robber!'
"The whole scheme of taxing land
values only was decreed to be a scheme
of spoliation. 'Progress and Poverty'
was constantly refuted, but it constant
ly refused to stay so. Itß vitality is re
markable end It will not down."
Concluding, he said: "His participa
tion in the New York municipal cam
paign was not a prudential step; neither
was the raid of John Brown on Harper's
Ferry, but In the good time coming it
will be granted that Henry George has
made his statue place In Time's Wal
halla."

I.ate, but frankly, a Republican president
acknowledges that the Ropubltean legisia

The president closes a remarkably weak
and meaningless message with a good
word for the civil service laws, which his
officials just now are trying so industri
ously to evade.—Wheeling Register.
President McKinley's first message to

please the one or to gratify the other.—

A DAY WITH THE KAISER
Laborious Boutins of His Royal
Business
That William Kaiser Is not every
body's man It may seem superfluous to
remark. In the present connection,
however, the remark must be taken to
imply that some much nearer approach
tothe accomplished athlete than the av
erage person can supply appears to be
required to put ln an hour-for-hour day
with the kaiser, albeit it would be he.
and not the athlete, who had to carry the
weight of care. The feat was probably
not attempted even by the accomplished
French Journalist who has Just given us
his appreciation of this Interesting po
tentate. M. Leudefs mind's eye it was.
no doubt, that followed the Imperial per
former through his double circuit of
the clock, yet so graphic and Intlmes are
the details that our mind's eye has no
difficulty In following M. Loudet'S.
As, then, the hands of the clock point
precisely to 5 a. m., we are privileged to
behold William Kaiser bounding from
his bed and preparing to propitiate the
English half of him with tho cold tub of
this country. By 6 we meet him fixed up,
in the first uniform of the day and ready
to sit down to breakfast.
In half an hour that meal is dispatch
ed, and William Kaiser proceeds to his
business room, there to take cognizance
of the first batch of letters and docu
ments which have been delivered by a
special service of couriers. At 6:30 the
aids on duty arrive and the general out
door program of the day is discussed and
decided on. At 7 William Kaiser appears
as the family man among his offspring.
At 7:10 he is in his second uniform,
ready to receive his marshals of the em
pire and a succession of superior func
tionaries, each with his individual report
to make. These made, any Important
function that may be in contemplation—
the reception of a distinguished visitor,
or a visit somewhere on the part of the
kaiser himself, for instance—is dis
cussed, and an estimate of the cost it
may involve arrived at. It is here. too.
that the affairs of the imperial household
are gone Into, and the bills of yesterday
duly audited.
At 8 ministers begin to arrive. The
prefect of police makes his report, and
a second lot of functionaries hand In
theirs. In all cases verbal explanations
of the documents put before the kaiser
for signature must be forthcoming. To
get all this done in the time, one would
imagine some less long-winded form
than usual of the German language must
be employed.
At 9 William Kaiser drives out, if the
weather be propitious. If not, he takes
three-quarters of an hour ln ths man
ege. Dismounting, in the latter case, at
9:45, he is in a new and appropriate
costume for the consideration of docu
ments by 10. A matter of fifty minutes
is apportioned to this work. Precisely at
11 William Kaiser appears in his audi
ence chamber, costumed for a confer
ence. The conference is followed by the
reception of various officers, who come to
pay their respects on promotion or for
some other reasons. These receptions
sometimes entail one or more of those
quick changes for which William aKlser
has established a world-wide reputa
tion. It is a delicate attention he is ac
customed to pay to officers in the uni
form of the service to which the visitor
belongs, or of the particular arm there
of. Contingencies are presumably pro
vided against, otherwise the appear
ance say, the British military at
tache, followed by the Austrian, and
succeeded by the naval attaches of Italy
and Russia, might be too much even for
William Kaiser s agility. This portion of
the day's work is appointed to terminate
at 2 p. m. At that hour his majesty re
verts once more to domesticity and pre
sides at the family luncheon. Half an
hour suffices for this refection, and at
2:45 he Is habited to go a-vislting. He
visits generals, ministers and a few of
the public offices. This lasts till 4.
William Kasier has then to assume
the costume ln which he proposes to be
photographed, or in which he may hap
pen to be sitting for his bust, or his por
trait in oils.
At the termination of the sitting he
resumes his usual outdoor habiliment,
and takes carriage exercise until the
hour of 6. At 6:30 he holds a further
reception, and hands back the docu
ments which he has taken the day to
consider before signing. He then dresses
for dinner and assumes the head of the
table as the clock is striking 7. He re
mains the family man until 9, when
he is due, of course ln costume, ln his
fencing room. The penultimate change
takes place at 9:45. At 10 his majesty
"takes light refreshments," which is
not unsuggestive of a well-earned
whlsky-and-soda, rings for his valet,
and retires to rest. But by his bedside
even is a business table, and what Mr.
Pecksniff described as "every facility
for Jolting clown crude notions, even
here."
This, it must be borne in mind, Is
simply William Kaiser's regular day's
work. When the visit of a distinguished
personage takes place, and half the day
has to be spent ln ceremonials of all
sorts, the Indefatigable host lengthens
out the day more. So, too, when
maneuvers are in progress or inspec
tlons being made. Then the Kasler is
'good for half a day in the saddle, and
no sleep at all. On all his journeys, by
sea or land, hl3 work goes with him,
.and is never allowed to leave him. Yet
at the journey's end there he Is, this
extraordinary man, always with the
speech to be spoken, the toast to be
given, ready to come trippingly off his
tongue. And all this restlessness Is to
some purpose, and all this expenditure
of energy to some end. William Kasier
is not disquiet thus in vain. That is
what makes him disquieting to so many.

MINES AND MINERS
Ths Greatest Gold State
The state of Colorado Is about to send
out two well-equipped palace cars con
taining specimens of ores from Colo
rado mines, photographed mining
scenes, milling plants, etc., with de
scriptive literature, which is to be dis
tributed from the cars throughout the
states east of the Rocky mountains, i
The cars will be sent over the leading
railroads of the United States and
Canada, and will be managed some
thing like "California on Wheels" sent ,
out by this state some years since. This
Is one of the many ways Colorado has of
advertising her magnificent mineral re
sources, which, by the way, are of such
merit that It does not seem at all neces
sary to say that this palace car exhibit
is to "spread abroad the facts concern
ing the greatest gold state In the union."
The greatest gold state ln the union Is
California, not Colorado. Since mining
began in either of the states, Colorado
has not in a single instance or any one
year ever equaled the gold output of
California. And as to aggregate gold
output, Colorado will have to scratch
out several hundred millions before it
catches up to California's record. Colo
rado has been for a long time the great
est silver producing state, but is has no
claims to be called the greatest "gold
state in the union." True, It now holds
second place, but is still, as It has al
ways been, outranked by California in
gold product. Colorado has enough to
boast of as a mining region without
claiming more than its due. —San Fran
cisco Examiner.
Fifty Cents a Pan
Pete Burke, ex-city marshal of Yuma
and present constable at Hedges, is re
sponsible for the latest gold excitement.
Burke, who drives the stage from
Hedges to Ogllby. some time since con
ceived the idea that there was gold in
the low black hills lying a mile and a
half from the former station, almost
on the stage route. He forthwith em
ployed an Indian to dig a hole to bed
rock at a certain place that gave prom
ise of richness.
Wednesday evening Burke called to
his employee as he passed the scene of
the search for riches and secured a pan
of the dirt coming out of the shaft. The
dirt was taken to the station and there
panned, and was discovered to contain
about 50 cents worth of coarse gold, In
cluding two good-sized nuggets, one
about 25 cents and the other about 10
cents in value.
Ogilby was immediately In a state
bordering on genuine excitement, and
everyone who could left at once for the
scene of the strike. The country has
probably been located all through the
section.—Yuma Sun.
A New IKCining District
A new mining district has been opened
in Southern California within the past
year. It Is known as the Corn Springs
Mining district, and Is located in the
Chuckawalla mountains in Riverside
county, about forty miles northeast of
Salton and an equal distance west of the
Colorado river. A good wagon road runs
from Salton to the district. The Chuck
awalla Mining, Milling and Water com
pany is the principal operator ln the dis
trict, which has been known for some
time, but which has not been entered to
any great extent on account of the sup
posed scarcity of water. That great
essential is now provided in sufficient
quantities. The Chuckawalla company
lias eleven men at work on Its twelve
claims and has expended in all between
i7OOO and $8000. It is preparing to put up
a 10-stamp mill In the near future. As
says have been obtained running over
$200 ln gold, but the average Is not so
high. There is plenty of firewood and
limber. About twenty men are at pres
ent working ln the district.
Stamp Mill for Barstow
The citizens of this district will be In
terested to know that the officers of the
Kramer-Randsburg railroad are now
figuring on putting up a forty-stamp
mill, with concentrators attached, at
Barstow. This question will be definite
ly decided by the officers of the new road,
who are expected out here from the east
shortly. It is proposed to give cheap
rates for ores, so that It will be possiblj
to both haul and mill the ores from thi:j
camp at a price not to exceed $4 per ton.
No doubt a graduated scale, according
to the value of the ores, will be made.
This forty-stamp mil! will be the moat
substantial and complete that money
can buy. Each stamp will weigh at
least 1000 pounds. Such an enterprise,
backed by the capital of the new/rail
road, will greatly enhance the value of
the mining properties in this district.
This mill is entirely independent of the
Herbert Lang smelter proposition men
tioned in the Miner two weeks since.—
Randsburg Miner.
Rich Strike in the Desert
One of the richest mining strikes ever
made on the desert has come to light
within the past few days. Samuel Tem
ple, well known ln Sun Bernardino, was
the lucky discoverer. For years the land
about Twenty-Nine Palms has been
known to be rich, but those seeking
mines went farther away, and over tho
land in which tills strike was made
thousands have pe.ssed on their way to
the new EI Dorado, Virginia Dale. The
new strike Is located about two and a
half miles from the mill at Twenty-Nine
Palms, and small uamples of the ore
horned out show a long string of gold
In the spoon, although the rock Itfelf
appears to be devoid of colors. The
ledge Is three feet wide on the surface
and can easily be traced for ISOO feet.
Present indications are that it is very
extensive and rich, being estimated to
go $SOO to the ton.
Hetty Green's California Mine
Hetty Green, the famous rich woman
of New York, has owned the Eureka
Consolidated mine in Amador county for
many years, during all of which time the
property has remained idle. As the mine
is supposed to be rich there has been a
great desire to see It in operation, but
it was said no one could buy and Hetty
had too much sense to run it herself.
However, about four manths ago an op
tion was obtained upon the property, and
since that time one of the leading mining
engineers of the country has with as
sociates been engaged in organizing a
wealthy syndicate to purchase and op
erate this property. Several millions of
capital are involved in the transaction,
and It Is understood by those who have
known about the deal that It Is about
concluded. —Sutter Creek Record.

A $250 Nugget
A nugget worth $251 was found last
week on J. C. Marriott's claim in Ho
gum gulch. It was an oval ln shape,
measuring four Inches In legth, one and
one-fourth Inches in width and three
fourths of an Inch thick. He also had
a number of smaller ones, ar.d a good
clean-up of fine gold. On this same
ground a $7G nugget was foqpd by JSd
Marriott and another worth $20 by Boon

it has produced thousands of dollars of

Strike in King George
J. A. jfcCusker, who recently bought

Assessment Work
Now that the year is drawing to a
close, parties owning mining claims ara
busy doing the assessment work on them
in order to keep the properties from be
ing Jumped. Assessment work of this
character rarely proves to be of any
benefit to the property. In order to hold
possession of an unpatented mining
claim at least $100 worth of work must
