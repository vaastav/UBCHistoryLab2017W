PRESIDEtlT'S MESSAGE
FtUo dtizent tf the tnai$ ani Houm of
Rtprtttntau $ :
In the mtdst of unprecedented political
troubles we b vo cause of great grrl:ude to
Oa i for unusual good health and mjit abuo
dant barves'a. You will not b.t surprised to
le rn tbat la the peculiar exigencies of the
time our intercourse with foreign natlors hss
been attended with profound aolicitude.cbitfly
turning upon cur own domestic affairs, a
dltlojsi portion of the American people
Lave, daring the whole yoir-if"B? In
-divide and destroy the
utiioo. A na loo which endures: fac
tious atd ' domestic divis on, is ex
posed to dkrespect abroad, aid oc" party
or bih Is sure, sooner or later, to Invoke
foreign Intervention. Nations thns templed
to interfere are not always abe to resist
tbo touLstls of seeming expediency and
ungenerous ambition, although measures
a opted under such iLfljeuoea eldooi fall to
be unfortunate and ir juri jus to those adopt
Ug them. The disloyal rliifns of the Uul
led States who have offered the ruin of our
country in reward for the aid and comfort
wLluh tbey have Invoked abroad, have
received lesa patronage and tacouragemi ut
tbn they robably exptcted. If it were J ait
to suppose, as tbe i surge, ta have seemed to
aasume, that foreign nations la this
case, disregarding all moral, social
and tre.ty oblgations, wculd act
solely and selfishly for the most speedy
testorstion of commerce, Including sp olady
the acquisition of cotton, those nations ap.
pear as jet cot to have seen their way to
their otjtct more directly or clearly through
the dest-uctlon than through the preservation
of the Uiiion. It we could dare to believe
that foreign nations are actuated by no
higher principle than this, I am quite sure
a second argument could be mado to
show them tbat they cculd teach their
aim more readily and easily by aid
ita to cruih this rtbtlllon than by giving
encourag'mect to the pr loci pal lever relied
on by the exciting of for ln nations to hos
tility agslost u as already intimated, in the
em bar rant men of commerce. Those na
tlors, however, not Imprcbably saw
from the first that it was tue Union
which made as well orr foreign as otr
djmestic oomnierce. They can scarcely fail
to perceive that the eflcrt for disunion pro
duces the existing difficulty, and that one
atronti nation promises more durable peace
atd moro extensive, v luable and reliable
commerce than can the aame nation broken
into hostile frag Heats.
It is not my purpoie to review our discus
sions with foreign State, because whatever
mUht be their wlshe or dispositions, tbe in
tegrity ef our country and tbe ata. illty of our
Government meiuly depends not upon them,
but upon the loyalty, patriotism, virtue arid
Intelligence cf tbe American people. The
correspondence Itself, with tbe usual reserva
tions, Is herewith submitted. I veutire to
hope It will ar pear, tbat we have practiced
prudence atJ liberality towards foreign
power, avrk? causes of irritation, and
with firmness maintaining . our own rights
and honor. SiDce, however, it Is apparent
that here, as la every other State, foreign
dangers necessarily at.ecd domestio difficul
ties, I recommend that adequate and ample
measures be adopted for malntair.iog the
public defences ou every aide. While nnder
