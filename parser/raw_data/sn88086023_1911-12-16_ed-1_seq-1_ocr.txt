Tho dovo of peace 1h here and the
olive branch now waves over the
warring camps that have been astir
since tho Commercial club meeting
Wednesday n'ght. It was announced
to the Ea t Oregonlan th's afternoon
by Senator J. N. Burgess that he will
stop the fight to circumvent the ac
tion of the Commercial club and will
not forward the petitions that were
signed by a number of local people
yesterday.
Along with this announcement
comes the following call for a club
meeting Monday night:
Mooting Monday Night.
"There will be a special meeting
of the Pendleton Commercial club on
Monday evening, December 18, 1911,
at g o'clock for the purpose of sub
mitting to the club a resolution that
hows the good faith of tho Pendle
ton Commercial club to tho Water
users' association of this county. This
resolution in no way rescind the
prcvloui resolutions which were pass
ed by the Pendleton Commercial
flub, ami which were wired to Wash
ington, The resolution to be submit
ted Is entire" y satisfactory to -all coa
terned. and has been endorsed by the
board of managers of the Pendleton
Commercial club and the executive
t'ommttco of tho Umatilla County
Wateruers' association.
"J. E. KEEFE, Jr., Sec "
i.owei; non it.
Tho resolution rerorred to was
written by Judge S. A. Lowell and
has been offered as a friendly solu
tion of tho controversy. It Is entirely
satisfactory to local friends of tho
west cxtcn-lon and has ulso been of
ficially approved by Messrs, Burgess,
Shaw and Guderlan, executive com
m ttee for the Umatilla county water
users' association. It Is satisfactory
to friends of tho extension for the
reason It sets forth the same senti
ments expressed In one of tho resolu
tions adopted Wednesday. At a cau
cus this morning the only objection
ral cd was as to whether the move
was advisable at this time, It being
held that Birch creek nnd McKay
creek people should first file upon wa
ter and then ask the government to
relinquish part of Its filing. In sup
port of this It was contended that If
the government should take uch ac
tion now the benefits might go to
others than the settlors o.n McKay
und H'reh creeks. However, the
1! rch creek delegation expressed sat
isfaction with the resolution and ask
ed for lt adoption. So It was cheer
fully accepted by the others present.
Tho call for tho special meeting
Monday was made hy Vice President
AV. E. Brock in tho abnenco of Presi
dent Sinythe, who left for Portland
last night.
Tho fol owing Is the resolution pre
sented by Judge Lowell and which
hag been endor-ed by the Birch
creek people, by It. K. Johnson and
members of tho Commercial club
' board of managers.
TllO JlOMOllltlOll,
Whereas, It is a fact demonstrated
by long experience that the condi
tions of soli and climate, and tho pe
culiar contour of tho country, touch
ing tho upper brnnchoa of tho Uma
tilla river, and its tributaries east of
Yoakum, notably Wild Horse crock,
McKay crook, the two branches of
IV rch creek, and Bear creek, make
that region a natural soil reservoir for
the lower river In tho dry season of
tho year.
And wherca", it is a further fact
that use of tho waters of said
Htroams by the residents thereon for
Irrigation purpo-es benefits all the
users on the lower river Including tho
Un'ted States government by retard
ing tho early run-off and holding It
back for use in tho lutter months of
tho summer;
And wherens, tho soils upon said
streams !s of the Fame character as
tho soil of tho wheat country and is
possessed of remarkable qualities of
retention of moisture, and whereas,
aub tantlally all the water dlvertod
from said streams for irrigation pur
poses, because of tho contour of the
country, finally returns to the stream,
and ultimately to the Umatilla river
for tho benefit of lower irrigators
thorron.
And whereas, because of these facts
the government will bo benefited In Its
present project, and In its proposod
west extension thereof, by encourag
ing tho ros'den'a along Bald stream
to d'vert as much of said water as
possible.
Therefore bo it resolved, that It Is

Jfewl and Stops Operations,
With thlrty-f ve men on the pay
roil at the present time, the contrac
tors and sub-contractors who have
been commissioned with the task of
constructing the eastern Oregon
branch insane asylum are pushing
their work a fast as possible, while
tho weather permits them to do so,
and the scene at the asylum grounds
Is one of great uctlvity. Already the
excavating is done, the footings in for
the five buildings which will consti
tute the asylum group, and the forms
are being constructed preparatory to
pouring the concrete for the founda
tions; electricians and plumbers are
already on the Job, making their first
connections, anu other preliminary
work is being done as fast as pos
sible. The firm of Olson & Johnson of
Mlssouia, Montunt, secured the gener
al contract for the construction of the
asylum buildings, but a number of
sub-contractors are caring for partic
ular branches of the big Job: C. F.
Carls of Walla Walla, secured the
contract for excavating, the Pacific
Fire Extinguisher company of Port
land Is Installing the electrical equip
ment, the Appling-Griggs company of
Tacoma Is looking after tho plumbing
and Theo M. Barr or Salem, is the
sub-contractor who will put in the
heating apparatus. Murphy Bros, of
this city have N-eii g ven the painting
contract subject to the approval of
the architect. All lumber, cement
and Kind Is being furnished by the
Oregon Lumber company of this city,
while all of the steel for the edifices
conies from Tobawanda, New York.
It Is' estimated that for the main
building, tho laundry and the power
plant, 1,600,000 feet of lumber will
be neces-ary, 140 carloads of cement
and 4 00 carloads of sand.
So eager are the contractors to
push work that , they have Installed
electric lights over the gravel pit In
order that work there can go on
without Interruption during the twen
ty-four hours. Olson & Johnson's
contract calls for the completion of
work by November 1, 1912. and they
declare they will bo ready to turn
the buildings over at that date.

New York, Dec. 16 A verdict of
"not guilty" was returned late yes
terday, freeing Lillian Graham and
Ethel Conrad of criminal charges on
wh'eh they had been held since last
June for shooting the millionaire
sportsman and hotel proprietor, W. E.
D. Stoke-. The Jury reached Its ver
dict In slight'- less than one hour.
When summoned to hear the ver
dict Miss Graham appeared unstrung
and was assisted Into the court room,
trembling. The more spirited Miss
Conrad, came unassisted, but nervous.
When the girls faced the foreman
ho announced the words "not guilty."
Miss Conrad cried, "Thank God," and
went into violent hysterics. She sank
to the counsel table, then Jumped up
again, shrieking and tearing her hair
nnd throwing her arms about .wildly.
It was a' surprise to the spectators,
for Miss Conrad had kept much the
better nerve of the two defendants
throughout the trial.
On the other hand. Miss Graham,
who continually wept during thet rial
and sobbed the mo a when she heard
the verdict, recovered her.jelf when
she saw her companion so affected
and acted as the comforter for her
younger friend.
It was at first thought that Miss
Conrad had misunderstood the ver
dict and tier companion tried to as
sure her that they were free.
"Oh, I know." she sa d. "Tell
mother we are free. Tell her we are
coming home."
' The girl's hystori continued ten
m'nutes.
The Jury arrived at Its verdict after
four ballots. On three of them the
jurymen voted each time 11 to 1 for
acquittal, the one man dissenting be
ing in favor of a conviction of second
degree assault.

Wash'ng'on. Dec. 16. With, free
trade elim'nated, as an issue, and pro
tective tariff matched agaln-t the
theory of tariff for revenue only, a
new tariff battle will be precipitated
between republicans and democrats!
when President Taft's message on the
issues goes to congress next week.
It is said that while the tariff
board's report shows substantial re
ductions may be made in the wool
tariff, 'he average reduction cannot
be gr'.at it the protective principle is I
maintained. The report practically
upholds the republican contention
that all duties should be estimated on
a specific rather than ad xalorem ba
sis. Senate republicans are reported to
have dee'ded to prepare a new bill,
if the house democrats send a wool
bill to them, disregarding the tariff
board report.
In the tariff biil fight the republi
cans expect the Insurgents to aid
them. If the insurgents don't help
it means the democrats will pass.
tho r measure and President Taft,
whn '.s unalterably opposed to any
tariff measure, which disregards the
protective principle, probably vetoe
it.
SIEBERT MAY NOT
BE DISQUALIFIED
John Siebert. councilman-elect;
from the th'rd ward, will not be dis
qualif'ed from taking his seat by rea
son of his failure to complete his nat
uralization within seven years after
filing his declaration of intention, it
being discovered that the law contain-!
ing such a specification was not en
acted until 1902, or eighteen years
after Mr. Siebert flied his declaration
and is not retroactive. However, the
question as to whether or not Mr.
Siebert Is el'gible to take his seat be
fore he becomes a citizen remains
still open and will probably have to
be settled by the council.
Deputy D'stnct Attorney Pruitt.
who gave his opinion yesterday that
Mr. Siebert was ineligible to become
a candidate because of his failure to
complete the requirements within sev
en years, himself discovered his er
ror, but he dec'ares he is still of the
belief that the counellman-eilect in
not ent'tled to take his seat until the
latter part of March because he can
not secure his citizenship papers un
til n'nety day after final application,
which was made yesterday.

wny for Permanent Fair Building.
By action of the district fair board
taken today G. L. Hurd of Stanfleld,
was elected ax president of the board
for the coming year while H. E. Beck
ers was made secretary in lieu of
Thomas FilzGerald who resigned
Other, officers elected are Frank Fra
zler, first vice president; W. R. Wal
pole, of Irrigon, second vice president
and R. M. Mayberry, treasurer.
The resignation of It. "Alexander as
president of the board was presented
and accepted at the meeting. Im
mediately thereafter Mr. Hurd was
chosen to the place and entered up
on his dutleies. ' He Is now at work
upon the proposition ot a permanent
building for the fair and it is the in
tentiun to hold a special meeting here
on the second Tuesday in January to
consider the matter. By that time it
ii thought a reply will be had to an
inquiry made of the O.-W. R. & N.
Co., as to whether or not a permanent
building may be erected on the land
now used by the fair.
Strong arguments for a permanent
building are found In the fact that
each year it costs the fair board about
$2000 to place the canvass roof on the
building and to make other needed
be tterments necessitated by the tem
porary nature of the structure.
At the meeting today N. T. Manela
of the eastern end of the county, was
chosen as a member of the board to
take the place of F. A. Sykes, resign
ed. Other out of town members aside
from those heretofore named are R.

SCHOOL SUPPLY
AGENTS IN BAD
"Agents, Not Welcome" will prob
ably be the .sign displayed by country
schoo's in the future as a result of
action taken this morning at the an
nual meeting of the school directors
of the county. During the discussion
of equipment and supplies introduced
by State School Superintendent L.. R.
Alderman, it was brought out that the
purchasing of supplies through agents
is undesirable for the reason that the
agents arc unreliable and charge ex
orbitant prices for their wares. The
meeting theeupon voted to discourage
the practice of securing any needed
article for the school room In this
manner.
This was the principal matter
brought up for discussion at the
morning sesslon but a number of oth
er important subjects are occupying
the attention of the delegates this af
ternoon. This afternoon. Dr. Calvin White,
state health officer, is the principal
speaker, h's subject being "Eanitation
of the Schools." Other subjects
which will be brought up for discus
sion are "School Support." "Rural
Supervision." "Indu-trlal Work in
Schools" and "School Hoard Meet
ings." Tho seas on will close with a
question box in which all directors
are permitted to submit certain
questions upon which they de-iro elu

Washington, D. C, Dec. 16. That
the Suiter resolution, to abrogate the
1832 treaty with Russia would be
considered an "insult to Russia" If
enacted into law, is the substance of
a me.age conveyed to President
Taft by Secretary of the State Depart
ment Knox today. Knox had pre
viously conferred with Ambassador
Bakhmeteff of Russia.
Diploma'ic negotiations, seeking
the settler-ient of the passport ques
tion have been broken off as a result
of Russia's dissatisfaction over the
house's action.
Russia's message was net a threat.
It does not object to the abrogation of
the treaty but don't 1 ke the language
used by Congressman Sulzer in his
resolution, which flatly charges Rus
sia with bad faith.
Congressman Sulzer consulted with
President Taft and Secretary Knox,
saying that Rus. la's ta'.k of insult Is
unfounded.
, The white house says that the entire
situation is now in the hands of the
senate foreign relations committee and
that it is up to them.
Congressman Sulzer said he believ- .
ed the resolution wo.nd pass the sen
ate whether Russia protested or not.
Congressman Mann, of Illinois, mi
nority leader, who opposed the work
ing of the re;olution, said:
"If the resolution passes the sen
ate, Russia can, if she desires, shut
out all Americans, if the treaty is
abrogated. If we are then determin
ed that Americans shall go into Rus
sia, that country can oniy force its
exclusion by conquering us at the
end of a war.
President Taft ca'.led a special ses
sion of the cabinet this afternoon to
consider the Sulzer resolution. An
executive session began at 4 o'clock.
