"WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 16, 1891.
The Tribune notices that the
name o H. M. Grimes, of
this city, is frequently men
tioned by state politicians
as a probaWe candidate for
Mr. Kern's shoes, and one who could
poll the full vote of the party.
Ox Thursday of last week there
were 612 bills and eight resolutions
presented in the senate, amor
them one bv Plumb to provide for
the retirement of national bank
notes and the free coinage of silver
The work of the dav broke the
record of all past senates.
A "WELL conducted board of trade

Nothing would hare a greater
tendency to bring back disaffected
Nebraska republicans into the party
than the nomination or rlaine as
the standard bearer for 1892. It
has been noticed that at every state,
district, county or township repub
lican meetinsr the mere mention of
Blaine's name has caused a wild and
prolonged applause. He is the man
needed to solidify the party in Ne-
braska.
With a working majority of one
"hundred and twenty-five in the
house of representatives, the demo
crats will have great opportunity to
pass and send to the senate tor con
currence many laws which they
claim is needed by the country. But
as the democratic party is conceded
to be a party of blunderers It
likely its majority in congress wil
work evil rather than good both to
the country and the organization

Our Nebraska senators lost no
ime in, offering measures in the
senate. Among those offered bv
Senator Paddock were the following:
A bill for the protection of trees
and other growth on the public do
main trom destruction by the light
ing of fires on prairies; to create a
permanent tariff commission to
make investigation and report facts
as a basis for legislation similar to
he amendment which is offered to
the McKinley bill; making the com
missioner or hsh and fisheries an
officer of the department of agri
culture; providing for a public
building at Hastings, to cost S75,-
000; providing for the deposit of
Forts Hartsuff, Sheridan and Mc-
Pherson under the homestead laws;
providing for a federal building at
Lincoln to. cost 1000,000; for the
relief of Wesley Montgomery and
the heirs or Lieutenant Commander
Wilson McGunnigle. Senator Man-
derson reintroduced his three batal-
lion-bill, and and also offered a bill
to create postal savings banks; one
to establish a branch mint at Oma
ha; one to divide Nebraska into
three judicial districts, the Platte
river to be the line of division; to
provide that notice of sale of real
estate held under the orders, judg
ment or decree of a United
States court shall be pub
lished in the county and
state where the property is situated,
etc. (this bill was favorably reported
in the last congress); increasing the
appropriation for the purchase of a
site and the erection of a public
building at Omaha to cost 2,000,
000; giving Norfolk a public build
ing to cost $100,000; preventing
the summary cancellation of pen
sion certificates and providing for
hearings in relation thereto; appro
priating S00,000 for buildings for
the military storehouse and offices
at the military depot at Omaha, the
amount to be immediately available.
Mr. Manderson also introduced his
old bill increasing the rate of pen
sions of certain persons. The first
bill introduced in the senate on
Thursday was senator Paddock's
pure food bill. It is nsmbered S. F.
1, and will be pushed by the Ne
braska senator for all he is worth".
Senator Paddock has reason to hope
that the measure will recsive favor
able attention at the hands of tha
present congress.
Statistics show, says an ex
change, that the cattle supply is
gradually decreasing. The farmer
who owns many cattle during the
next five years will make more
money out or them than has ever
heretofore been realized. The short
crops of Europe has resulted in the
killing of many of the cattle kept
for breeding purposes, and the beef
Kunnlv will have to come from this
country for several years to come.
At least four years of unprecedented
prosperity is ahead of the farmer
and stock-raisers of America.
The census statistics and the
claims of the Peffer-Donnelly crowd
are. at variance to a notable degree.
The latter claim that the farmers
own twenty-two per cent of the
nation's wealth and pay eighty per
cent of the taxes, while the former
prove that the farmers own forty
per cent of the taxable wealth and
pay thirty per cent of the taxes.
Fair minded men will accept as re
liable and correct tne census giaus
tics, knowing as they must that the
claims of Peffer and others are made
purely for political effect.
The desperate efforts of the in
dependents leaders and press to
make appear that they suffered no
great loss in Kansas at the election
this fall is not borne up by figures.
Last year there were 424 county
officers and to elect, and the alli
ance elected 324 of them, the repub
licans 71, and the democrats 29.
This year the republicans elected
277, the alliance 127, and the demo
crats 20. The alliance lost 197
offices and the republicans gained
206. It will take an alliance expert
to show how that party has held its
own.
After securing location of a beet
sugar factory, North Platte wants
to" turn her attention toward getting
a plant for manufacturing twine
and rope from hemp. Expensive
machinery is not required in such a
manufactory and the capital needed
could probably be raised among the
residents of our city. Hemp grows
luxuriantly in the Platte valley and
an industry which requires such
raw materials as we can grow are
the kind we want and the ones
which will prove the most profitable
to the investors. It is of double
benefit, making a home market for
the product grown by the farmer
and giving employment for many
laborers.
The Tribune endorses the opin
ion of au exchange that President
Harrison made an unfortunate over
sight in neglecting to mention in
his message the growing evils of
nnrestricted immigration. As long
as the offscourings of other coun
tries are allowed to laud on our
shores we may expect a gradual
degradation of American laborers.
A large per cent of the foreigners
who have been arriving during the
past ten years, and especially the
treacherous Italians, are not of the
class who become industrious law
abiding citizens and the fewer we
have of them the better. The
United States offers homes for the
thrifty foreigners but should not be

Our chief national dagger, he
says, lies in the possible overthrow

be possible to constitute a commis

wise and impartial men. to whom a
consideration of the question of the
evils connected with our election
system and methods might be com
mitted with a good prospect of
securing unanimity in some plan
ior removing or mitigating tnose
evils.
In conclusion the president says:
"I have been greatly rejoiced to
notice many evidences of the in
creased unification of our people
and a revived national spirit. The
vista that now opens to us is wider
and more glorious than ever betore.
Gratification and amazement strug

V NOT LINCOLN'S WORDS;
JNo paragraph has beenjtniore
constantly and persistently quoted
by calamity organs and pessimistic
orators than the following1 !eged
quotation from President Xmcoln:
"I see in the near future," Eaid Abra
nam Lin coin in 1865, "a crisis approach
ing that unnerves me and causes me to
tremble for the safety of my country. As
a result of the war, corporations have
oeen enthroned and era of corruption in
xiign pinces v.in lollow and the money
power of the country will endeavor to
prolong its reign by working upon tb&
prejudices of the people until all wealth!
is aggregated in a few hands and- the'
republic is destroyed. I feel at this
moment more anxiety for the safety of
my country than ever before, even in the
midst of war."
Ex-Senator Ingalls, in a letter to
the Kansas City Star, points out the
facts that neither these words or
anything resembling them appears
in any ot the letters, messages or
speeches of Lincoln. The internal
evidence is against theis authentic
ity. Lincoln did not live more than
a fortnight after the fall of Rich
mond dad decided the fate of the
rebellion, his death occurring in
fact sometime before the war actu
ally closed. Mr. Nicolay, former
secretary and later his biographer,
has never seen such expressions in
the writings or utterances of the
martyred president. Evidently if
Lincoln had given expression to
such gloomy forebodings during
the last two weeks of his life, the
only time he could possibly have'
used such language, it would have
attracted such wide attention that
there could have been no trouble in
citing the exact time, place or cir
cumstances. As it is, nobody has"
ever professed to give the letter,
conversation, message or speech in
which these words occur, making it
absolutely certain that the entire
Suotation , like the famous "Hazard
ircular" and other calamity fiuger
posts, is a malignant and stupid for
gery. Winfield (Kansas,) Courier.
More serious sickness is produced
by allowing the bowels to remain
in a torpid or partially constipated
condition than from any other cause.
In many instances diseases are pro
duced, from which people never
wholly recover. Dspep3ia, piles
and nervous disorders are three, of
the most common and most serious.
They are caused by neglecting the
bowels, and can be prevented be an
occasional dose of St. Patrick's Pills,
which always produce a pleasant

THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
The Tribuxe cannot devote
space sufficient to give the presi
dent s message m full, but gives the
following resume.
The message which wa3 trans
mitted to congress at noon on Wed
nesday of last week, opens with the
affairs of the state department
touchinsr upon the Behring sea
question, meat inspection, tho Bra'
zilian troubles, the New Orleans
lynching, our relations with Chili,
and other matters. In regard to
the Chilian troubles, he intimates
that full and prompt reparation
from that government will be ne
cessary. The Nicaraugua canal
project is endorsed and government
aid recommended.
Under the head of treasury de
partment he congratulates the
country upon its present prosperity
and contentment, and says:
think there are conclusive evidences
that the new tariff has created sev
eral new industries which will
within a few years give employment
to several hundred thousand Ameri
can workiugmen and women."
Speaking of silver the president ex
presses himself in favor of the
double standard but declares that
free coinage would be disastrous.
The war department is briefly
treated. He approves of Senator
Manderson's three batallion recom
mendation. The administration of the post
office department is approved, and
he points with pleasure to the fact
that eight thousand, miles of new
postal service has been established
upon Tailroads, the car distribution
to sub-stations in the great cities
has been increased about 12 per
cent, while the percentage of errors
in distribution has, during the past
year, been reduced over one-half.
He approves the proposed rural free
delivery and advocates the modified
use of telegraph in connection with
the postal service.
The satisfactory growth or the
new navy is referred to. He says:
L commend to your iavorable con
sideration the recommendations of
the secretary, who has, I am sure,
given to them tne most conscienti
ous study. There should be no
hesitation in promptly completing
All 1 1 I
a navy or the oest mouern type,
large enough to enable this country
to display its flag in all seas for the
protection of its citizens, and of its
extending conimercre. The world
needs no assurance of the peacef ul
purposes of the United States, but
we shall prooabty be, m the tuture,
more largely competitors in the
commerce of the world, and it is
essential to the dignity of this na
tion, and to that peaceful influence
which it should exercise on this
hemisphere, that its navy should be
adequate, both upon the shores or
the Atlantic and the Pacific.
There is nothing under the in
terior department heading of special
importance.
The work ot the agricultural de
partment, particularly in securing
meat inspection, is commended. He
refers to the fact that the grain
crop of this year was the largest in
our history 50 per cent greater
than that of last year, and yet the
market that has opened and the
larger demand resulting from short
crops in Europe, have sustained
prices to such an extent that the7
enormous surplus of meats and
hreadstuffs will be marketed at good
prices, bringing relief and prosperity
to an industry that was much depressed.
The civil service commission nas
done a good work, and he recom
mends that the appropriations ior
the commission be made adequate
to the increased work of the next
fiscal year.
TTndfir the head of "Improving
Election Methods" he suggests the
appointment of a non-partisan comr

Editor Casper, the old war horse
of the David City Press, comes out
with a severe tirade against the al
leged democratic editors who de
serted the party for the independent
camp during the recent campaign.
He sizes up the situation about
right when he says that their only
object in switching was to get a pull
at patronage. He does not want
them back in the democratic ranks,
"for," he says, "not one of them
will add one iota to the cause of
democracy in 1892. They know
nothing of democratic principles
and cave less. They are torch
bearers for free drinks. They did
their dirtiest to destroy the demo
cratic party when' they left it, and
now when they find themselves dis
appointed they come running back
like mangy curs. Any democratic
ediior who a f'.w weeks ago was
playing his mud guns on democrats
and howling for the independent
ticket, and is already reconverted to
democracy, is a stinker of stinkers
and is not safe to trust feeding hogs
with corn at 30 cents a bushel."

ular vote, the enactment of a law
providing for loaning money direct

these things are clone he intimates

it certainly will if nothing is done
"for the relief of the people
