The United States cotton estimate
. for the cotton crop has been published
and it shows 0,674,000 bales, Even
this is a little more than we thought
the crop would amount to, but we
told you that the estimate some weeks
ago as published of J11,500,000 was
bosh, and this United States report
bears us out in the statement. Now
we want to see a higher prift* for cotton.
Hon. Stanyarne Wilson has our
thanks for very interesting statistics
from the U. o. Department of Agriculture.o
These bulletins contain
articles of interest concerning agricultural
matters. They are for distribution
and if our farmer friends
will call in we will show them the
list. Mr. Wilson will send any one
selected.
A terrible epidenic of small pox is

For the protiction of the state if

It will no doubt be a surprise to

At the annual meeting of the epworth
Orphanage the board elected
Rev.George Henry Waddell, financial
manager of the Orphanage. Mr.

health. Rev. Whitfield Brooks,
pastor in charge at Prosperty 8. O.
was elected to succeed Mr. Waddell
as superintendent of the Orphanage.
Mr. Brooks is a good man, and well
qualified for his new position.

third turned over in the ditch. The
migrant train took fire and the
eoaohes burned, the loss of life is
estimated at 150. The aooident oeoured

THE GREAT EXPOSITION.
The opening of the South ^Carolina
Inter-State and Weet Indian Exposilion
at Charleeton last Monday wan
a grand suooeee in every particular,
and the promoters and ell those who
assisted in the work are to be congratulated
upon the grand success attending
their efforts. Results exceed
the most sanguine expectations of its
friends throughout the State who
hare lent their aid to the Exposition
and to many of Charleston's own olti
zens. It is going to be the grandest
thing of the kind ever pulled off in
the South, and every man, womaiand
child in South Carolina at least
tin nan nnuihlT errancre to do BO
should visit Charleston during the
six mouths duration of this grand
Exposition. The government exhibit
has been moved from the reeent Buffalo
Exposition to Charleston, and
this alone will well repay any one for
a visit to Charleston, to say nothing
of the thousands of other interesting
exhibits to be seen there. It was a
grand undertaking for Charleston and
the people of South Carolina, and it
will redown to the glory of the oity
and of the State for ages to come. It
will be the grandest illustration to
the hundreds of thousands of >isitors
from a distance, of the pluck, energy
and push of this grand old State that
has ever been shown to the world,
and we believe the futnre benefit to
the 8tate;will repay ten-fold the expense
of getting it under way, and
the pride with whioh the promoters
and their posterity can point back to
the fact that by their efforts they
were in a measure responsible for and
helpful In bringing about the one
thing proving to be the greatest lever
In showing up the great possibilities
of old South Carolina, and showing
to the world that in South Carolina
there is nnity of purpose, and in unity
there is strength, and that the indomitable
energy of her people made
it possible to surmount or remove
every obstacle iu her onward march
to progress, no matter how apparently
difficult when viewed from a distance,
will be sufficient glory for every effort
made, even Id the face of difficulties.
11 hopor to South Carolina, her uoble
aod patriotic sons, the lovers of home
and liberty.
The first day of the Exposition,
Sunday, was devoted to divine
services, of thanksgiving and soliciting
the divine benediction of the
giver of all good gifts, upon the Exposition.
There were several addresses
by eminent divines appropriate
to the- occasion, among them
Bishop Capers, Bishop Dunoan, Dr.
David M. Ramsey, Dr. Alexander
Sprunt, Rev. B. . Elzas, and othass.
Ten thousand citizens joined in the
services.
The Exposition proper was opened
on monday Morning, President Roosevelt
touched an electric button in his
telegraph department at the White
House, that gave the signal for the
opening of the big show, this was
followed by a message of greeting
from the President. The opening
day was a big suooess, there were
4'> 000 people on the grounds, and the
Exposition is well under way
Chauncy M. Depew the distinguished
orator of the day delivered the opening
address, he recieved an ovation
when he appeared on the speaker's

ledge. His address vu a master]7
effort, that reflected credit even upon
Chauncj Depew. There were manj
distinguished visitors present, who
were delighted with the Exposition
and its prospects.
There has been a great deal written
about the Charleston Exposition, but
appreciate it 70a must go to eee it

farmer friends, in diversifying yoi
crops you give broom oorn a try.

corn is now $180 a ton, and that it
difficult to procure it at that hi{
price.
"The value of broom corn depenc
upon its color and fibre, the form
largely controlled by the method an
care taken in curing it, and the latt*
due to the soil conditions where it
grown. ,
The yield of clean, merchantab
broom straw is said to vary from 4<
to 1,000 pounds to the acre. La
year a farmer near Oourtland, Alaba
planted two acres of broom corn. F
gave it no attention except to have
man one day pull up corn where
was too thick. It. was not plough**
hoed or cut at the proper time, belt
allowed to over-ripen, and when ri
was left on the ground until ntlldewe
yet. from the two acres there we
sold l,2i)5;ponndsattwoand hnlf cen
a pound. This corn would have r^d*
brought four cedts a pound had it n
been damaged.
There are several broom factori
in the South, and they are always
the market for broom straw.
Besides the straw, broom corn yieli
as mneh fodder as does Indian co
and also from ten to thirty bushels
seed to the acre, which is very usef
for general farm purposes. Removii
the seed and preparing the straw f
market is a simple and inexpensi
matter. The cultivation is similar
that for Sorghum and Kaffir cor
The richer the soil the better the cro
broom corn will grow however, <
poor or upland soils. The time
harvest varies with the latitude fro
July to September.
In the 8outh the oost of land, labc
and living is much less than in tl
North."
