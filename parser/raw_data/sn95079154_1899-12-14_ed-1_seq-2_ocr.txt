STRAINING AT A GNAT AND SWAL?
LOWING A CAMEL
Governor Tyler in his message to the
General Assembly of Virginia, devoted
considerable space to a discussion of cor?
ruption in elections in the State; but be
seemed unable to discover but oue mark
at which to aim his shaft of criticism of
methods that prevail?that mark being the
use of money to bribe voters. The Gover?
nor appeal's to be smarting under the blow
which the Martin machine recently gave
him, and he is disposed, no doubt, to at?
tribute bis crushing defeat for Senator to
the corruption fund which was so largely
distributed by the machine. Very natural?
ly this has caused the Governor to concen?
trate all his opposition to corruption in
elections upon the one evil be has in view,
and to completely ignore a greater evil
which should have attracted his attention
?the vote stealing evil that is so prevalent
in fome sections of Virginia.
This conduct of Governor Tyler has been
followed by the introduction of a bill in the
Senate by Senator Barksdale, of Halifax,
which is declared to be a measure for the
purification of elections in Virginia. It is
a very-long bill, divided into more than
twenty sections, and its purpose is to pre?
vent the use of money and patronage for
securing the election of candidates. The
Barksdale bill is a good one, if it was
coupled with provisions that would prevent
frauds on the ballot box. By itself it is
nothing more than a humbug. We all
know that money has been used freely in
Virginia to bribe electors and legislators;
and all good citizens must admit that these
practices are very wrong and damaging to
the moral tone of the people of the State.
But very many persons also know, among
them Governor Tyler and Senator Baiks
dale, that the most outrageous frauds, in
the way of ballot box stuffing, false count?
ing and almost countless other tricks, have
been perpetrated under the present elec?
tion law, and have gone unpunished.
What we mean by having knowledge of
these frauds is, tii.it they have been pub?
lished to the world in such a way that any
man who reads the newspapers cannot es?
cape knowing of their existence. Governor
Tyler must know of the Smithers precinct
outrage. He must have heard of thegioss
frauds that were practiced in Congressional
elections in the Second, Fouith, Fifth,
Ninth and Tenth Districts. If he has not
found the evidence to support these
charges it Is because be has not chosen to
seek for it. Let him examine the proof in
the contested ( lection cases from these
several districts, or gain the confidence of
the Democratic leadeis who manipulated
the elections, and he will be supplied
with much stronger proof of vote stealing
than of vote buying.
As long as Governor Tyler and other
Democratic leaders attempt to create the
impression that they are in favor of houest
elections, by talking about bribery and re
miiningsilent upon the question of vote
stealing, so long will their sincerity be
called in question. It Is impossible for
these gentlemen to know of the one evil
without having full knowledge of the
other. It may be that they haven't the
moral courage to attack the whole election
machinery, but as long as they rave about
bribery, and say or do nothintr to prevent
the other great evdls, they will be in the at
tude of "straining at a gnat and swallow?
ing a camel."
iT WILL CONTINUE.
The suggestion of Governor Tyler that
the election laws be so amended as tc
prevent vote buying will hardly receive
favorable action from the legislature, an
Senator Martin opposes it. The Richmond
News, the new Democratic organ, in speak
ine of Governor Tyler's views says :
"The bogie man of "vote buying" and
"controlling elections" is run out every
now and then for what purpose we cannot
conjecture, but we do not believe that the
mass of the people in this State are being
bribed nnd bought up year after year likt
cattle in a pen. The integrity of the citi?
zens of this State is equal to that in any
State in this country, and the people exer?
cise their suffrages in tne manner that
Buits them, and as far as we can judge they
are not grateful to the people who insist
that they are constantly being debauched
and corrupted and their birthrights sold
for a mess of pottage."
This is pretty strong evidence that there
will be no change in the election laws, and
that vote buying and vote stealing will go
on as long as the machine has control.
The existence of the machine is dependent
upon the continuance of the present law
and methods.
Maetinism and ballot reform in Virgin?
ia cannot exist together.
The Senate of Virginia on last Satur?
day passed the House resolution which
called upon tiie Virginia nieuibeiB in Con?
gress to use their efforts to have the next
first-class battleship built by the Govern?
ment named Virginia. In the Senate,
Mr. Barksilale made a bitter speech
against the pa-sage of the measure. He
declared that such a vessel might be used
to extend imperialism, and that the adop?
tion of the resolution might be construed
as an endorsement by the Virginia Legis?
lature of such a policy. If Barksdale is a
fair sample, and we expect lie is, of the
ability of members of the Legislature, this
is a General Assembly which is not like?
ly to reflect much credit upon the State.
No wonder Mai tin can handle it as he
pleases.

The FrederickBburg Free Uince says:
"The close friendship between Senators
Martin' Pilcherand Saunders means that
the next House of Delegates will be abso.
lu ely dominated by United States Sena?
tor Martin, and that no bill not marked
'O. K.?T. S. M.' will have any show of
p.issing the Legislature. The State has
a second Mahone at the helm of the domi?
nant party, with this difference, that Ma?
hone had the Democratic organization to
fight, whilst Martin has it absolutely under
his thumb."
We hear nothing from the Democratic
newspapers about tiie bossism of Martin.
They used to make a great fuss about Ma?
hone as a boss.

The recent message of President Mc?
Kinley lias received more favorable com?

Democratic administration? The South
is growing rich under the Republican
policy, but will try to overthrow that
policy uext year.
A reporter in the Richmond Times says:
' There is little doubt that Senator Flood's
bill to allow the voters to say whether or
not there shall be held a convention to re
vise and amend the constitution will pass.'

THE UNSANITARY DOLLAR.
The Microbes Carried by the Circulating

Chicago Inter Ocean.]
The selfishness of mankind, as well at
ci>vetousness and cupidity, blinds tin
. average pursuer of the almighty dollar tc
its unsanitary condition. He is heedlest
of the death-dealing microbes which swai n
and gambol over the em-raving, and u

'. ever known to refuse a bill because it ba<
e not been recently fumigated, washed
starched and ironed. Neither the banks

currency long enough to subject it to mi

is more particular about the repayment o
the loan when due than it is regarding tin

is the degenerating and demoralizing in

THE PRESIDENT'S MONEY PROPOSALS
Philadelphia Press.]
The President devotes but a small por
tion of his third message to a considers
tion of the money question. There isgoot
reason for this. Congress is already fa
miliar with his opinions on this importsnl
subject. He has presented them in previ
ous messages and they still hold good
since the money and bank legislation whirl
he has urged upon Congress has not yet
been secured. The Secretary of the Treas?
ury is a'trained financier, with a mastery o
all current financial problems. With his re?
port ready for presentation, the Presideni
may well feel that the full presentatior
an J discussion of this important issue ma\
well be left to bis very capable finance
minister.
There are, however, two vital points ir
the money question which the Presideni
feels called to press anew upon the atten
tion of Congress. To support the existing
gold standard and be in a position to meel
every raid upon the Treasury he aski
again for legislation to authorize the Secre
tary of the Treasury to sell short-term
low -rate bonds to maintain the coin re
serve. The reasons for granting thii
power are so obvious, its economy ant
necessity have been so amply demonstrat
ed, that only Congressional inertia and i
financially unsound Senate have preventet
this power being granted earlier to th<
Secretary of the Treasury. It is hardlj
conceivable that the present Congress wil
adjourn without curing thi3 defect. Th<
failure of the national banking law to se
cure the country an elastic currency is ?
defect in our monetary system which tb(
President asks Congress to cur?. In addi?
tion the President reviews his former cur?
rency recommendations which have not
yet been carried into effect by legislation.
The time is now ripe for securing the
changes in our currency and banking law
which the President has urged upon Con?
gress in his several annual messages. The
h?ls prepared by the Finance Committee
of the Senate and the Republican Caucus
Committee of the House place the gold
standard on a firm and permanent basis,
and provide a way for protecting it and
maintaining it for all the kinds of money
' authorized by United States law. Either
of these bills, if adopted, will break the
endless chain, fortify the gold reserve,
bring all our different kinds of currency
into closer relation with each other and
with the gold standard. Either bill will
relieve the national banks of antiquated
restrictions and increase the volume of
their currency. Both forbid the issuing of
paper money once redeemed in gold, ex?
cept in exchange for an equal amount of
gold.
Neither House nor Senate bill promises
to give any greater elasticity to our cur?
rency than it now possesses. The Presi?
dent's recommendations on this score point
to a defect which has existed for thirty
years, though not always to the same de?
gree that iL does now. \ fixed and rigid
b )dy of currency or one which changes
very slowly can never be wholly satisfac?
tory, since a volume of currency which is
ample for normal periods, or for ten
months of each year, must prove wholly
inadequate in those regular periods or ir?
regular panics when an unusual demand
arises for ready money.
Comptroller of the Currency Dawes has
pointed out how this elasticity may be se?
cured by imposing a tax on the increased
bank currency which will permit its issue
when the rate of interest is high and stim?
ulate its withdrawal when tiie demand for
a larger volume of currency is over and
the rate of interest falls to normal. If
Congress will incorporate and pass some
such provision as this, with the other ex?
cellent proposals in the pending currency
bills, the President's recommendations for
currency reform will be realized.
PULPIT PATROITS.
Thanksgiving Day Gave Preachers an
Opportunity to Prove Their
Americanism.
Washington "Star" (Itul). j
One of the most striking features of the
general observance yesterday of Thanks?
giving Day was the almost unbroken note
of patriotism which sounded from the pul
pilts. In this city and elsewhere the ser?
mons appropriate to the occasion were
couched in the spirit of contentment with
prevailing conditions.
The mission of the United States as a
civilizer was recognized. The necessity of
I completing the work undertaken in tiie
far East was emphasized. The slanders
upon the President apd his helpers were
rebuked. Citizens of all denominations
were urged to stand together for the honor
of .he Hag and the extension of American
institutions to the regions now protected
by that emblem. The opportunity at
hand to uplift a irreat mass of people by
I offering to them opportunities for educa?
tion and refinement and a clearer apprecia?
tion of moral responsibities was welcomed.
I Thi-chorus from the pulpits indicated
I how the conservative thinkers anil minis?
ters of the g'-spil feel about expansion.
They are not politicians, catering to a
Sckle constituency. They are not place
seekers, servint: their chances. They art

I I their attainments and their virtues, men
1 ot intellect and responsibility, zealous for
the spread of truth and light, earnesl
workers in a good cause, in whatever nnuu
they preach or whatever doctrines the)
promulgate.
Their united voice of patroitic faith ir
j the country is far more potent than thai

imaginary advantage in party maneuver
inis, revile the nation through its heads
praise its enemies, blaspheme its institu?
tions and invite disaster to its prosperity,
The Reformed Mormons and Roberts.
Si. Louis "Globe-Democrat" (Kep.).
There is no particulur reason forsuprisc
in the fact that the refornial branch of the
.Mormons are hostile to Roberts The on?
ly objection that any one has to the Utah
Congressman is that he is charged with
f J being a polygamist. This body seceded
from the Utah or larger parts of the
I Church in 1860, under the leadership of
Joseph Smith, son of the first head of the
denomination. The ground of the seism
j was the polygamous practices which Brig
l ham Young introduced in the church.
Polygamy had, to some extent, been in
among the leading spiiits of the Mormons
ever since the the last days of the original
Smith, the founder of the Church, but it
was not until 1S52, when Brighain Young
was at the bead of its affairs, and eight
Fears after Smith's death, that plural mar?
riages were announced as a tenet of the
denomination creed. This created a bolt
under the younger Smith. The seceders.
even accepting their own figures of mem?
bership? 40.0U0 or 50,000?are not a sixth
I as numerous as the present Church of
Jesus Christ of latter-day Saints, of which
Roberts is an official; but its hostillity to
the polygamist, is a factor in the case
which should be taken into the account.
The light against Robers which will begiu
when the House meets next Monday is
certain to attract the attention cf the
whole country.
South African Dutch.
F. C. Sclous in London '-Times."]
I have some right to speak on such a
matter, as I first went to South Africa in
11871, and in the following year came in
I contact with the Transvaal Boers. 1 soon
learned to speak their language, and dur
I ing more than twenty years luve had
I a great deal to do with them, and still
have many friends amongst thero, but in
all my long intercourse with these peo?
ple, whether as casual acquaintance,
friend of the family or total stranger, I
have never met with anything but hos?
pitality and kindness. * * * 1 traveled
slowly through the Transvaal by bul?
lock wagon shortly after the retrocession
of the country in 1881, and visited all the
farmhouses on my route. I met with no
insults nor the least incivility anywhere,
nor ever heard any boasting about Boer
successes over our troops, though at that
time I understood and spoke the "Taal"
weil. In common with all who really
know the Boers, who have lived amongst
them, and not taken their character at
second hand, I have always been etruck
with the moderation in speaking of their
victories over our soldiers. As for the
Boers having a contempt for Englishmen
as individuals, that is nonsense.

FUR GARMENTS AND BOAS.
Excesnlve Decoration Is One of the
Featarea of the Present Sen
aon'u Display.
Fur garments and novelties in fur
neckwear are out in full bloom in the
shops, and if the variety shown is real?
ly a good illustration of what is to be
worn, then no one need hesitate about
making a selection. All sorts of cape
lets, collarettes and boac figure in this
department of dress in a bewildering
array of combinations.
Two and even three kinds of fur are
worked in together, and with the addi
I tion of heads, innumerable tails and
feet, the effect is quite as easily Imag?
ined as described. The question of
what not to have becomes the one for
consideration very promptly after a
few moments' reflection. There is
much to be said in favor of these little
novelties, as they' can furnish warmth,
and if you purchase one mnde of.only
one kind of fur, it gives an air of ele?
gance to your costume.
Combinations in fur are stunning in
the coat department where the broad
flaring collars are of fluffy long-haired
fur, chinchilla, sable or fox, on the
baby lamb and sealskin coats. Iu the
smaller things for the neck, the mix?
tures have a patchy appearance. Some
of the first-class furriers will tell yon
that they are making very few of tbe
collaret es and little capes, boas being
in better style. The long round boas
are coming in again, huge in size, as
they are made of bearskin and fox, and
the muffs, round and plain, are propor?
tionately large. In fox, a muff with a
head at one end and n fat bushy tail
at the other is one of the novelties. An?
other fox muff has a head directly in
the center of the front.
Again we see the combination of vel?
vet and lace ou coat revers, and ap?
pliques of black cloth worked in on the
body of broad tail coats; but this is sim?
ply a fad to promote the senson's scheme
for excessive decoration, and add more
expense where there is enough already.
Embroidery of any sort, in fur, is never
more than a passing fancy, as it is
wasted elegance in the first plaoe, and
very poor taste in the second. A knot
of cream Luce, or a jabot of soft lace
at the neck or on the muff, !s always a
pretty addition, but the special craze
which supplants the lace this season
is the use of chiffon plaitings with a
tiny ruche on the edge, all matching
' the fur in color. Wherever lace might
be used for frills, scarf ends and edg?
ings, the chiffon is substituted, brown
chiffon for sable, and gray for chin?
chilla.
Pretty little shoulder capes art? made
of beaver colored velvet shirred around
the neck and down on the shoulders to
give them shape. The edge is finished
with a band of silver fox, below which
falls a tiny plaited frill of chiffon
matching the velvet in color. This has
a narrow ruche on the ed^re and long
scarf ends of chiffon, also fiuished with
a ruche, tie In front. Sometimes these
ends are accordion plaited, and again
they are simply a full straight scarf
with rounded ends, trimmed all around,
i A pale blue or pink chiffon frill may be
, substituted for the more somber color
, on the inside of the neck. A pelerine
and muff of chinchilla outlined with
gray chiffon frills ore the daintiest,
things among the fur novelties.
' A stylish coat is of breitschwanz
i with chinchilla collar, and one of
the Eton shapes with a full front
I is made entirely of chinchilla
, Breitschwanz in its natural gray color
, is used this season for evening wraps,
one specialty being a long cape with
a uhapod flounce, lined-throughout with
1 pink satin. TMnk chiffon frills with
cream lace decorate the Inside of the
i collar, cover the revers and trim the
- front edge, and a hood drapery formed
( of folds of gray m?-ror velvet is carried
around the shoulders*?N. Y. Sun.
