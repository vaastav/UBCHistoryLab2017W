larations for which the business world
lias been waiting. From tho position
which the real meaty part of the mes
sage contains, it looks as if tho president
had given the matter tho most careful
and longest consideration. Tho pith of
tho message is what tho president has to
say about the interstate cominorco law
and tho antitrust law. lie says that
there hr been no timo to test the cQ'ect
of th interstate commerce amendments
made by the last congress. Threo points
that tho persidont formerly recommend
ed were not covered in tho amended law,
hut, says the president in his messago:
"1 do not press tho consideration of
any of thue objects on congress at this
bossion."
Only a few nmerulnu'nts to the inter
state commerce hiw nro recommended,
and none are likoly to cause bitter con
tontion. No elm n go whnt-ovor is sag-
gested in the anti-trust law. " Rather" , al legislation proposed by some agita

The whole message Is a conservative ' .xprossing olsowhero his preference for

sentially eonsorviitivo, rational, and
right that it becomes radical, .linost
revolutionary, in the eyes at least of
thoso who have a hand in distributing
the pntrouago.
Tho president strongly recommends
the simplifying of judicial procedure
and suggests thnt tho supreme court
under special authority from congress
make a thorough revision, of tho rules
of procedure with a view to expediting
the work of the courts. Tho president
recommends ulso that the supremo court
be relieved of much unnecessary appel
late consideration, which the courts bo
low might just nh well disposo of. Tho
president renews his reenmmendntion

Tho recominondatlon for natioual in
corporation of Interstate cointuorco and
industrial organisations is renewed. Pos
sibly next to the president's pronounce
ineut upon the interstate commerce and
anti-trust questions, his iows on the
tarltf will attract the most attention
among business men. lie utrougly rec
ommends a permanent tariff commission
to correspond with the strictly business
organizations in foreign countries that
have charge of tariff revision, lie urge.
that only one schedule nt a time be tak
en up for revision, and thnt only nfter
careful investigation and report by the
permanent tariff cotuini.don. The pres
ent tariff and the corporation tax nro de
clared to be most successful income pro
duccrs.
A leasing system for coal, oil aud gas
lands is approved, also for water power
sites. Th e pre.idont strongly urges
legislation at the short session with a
view to putting into practice some of
the more important eouservution plans
that have been thoroughly thrashed
out. The rei-omiuendatiou for specific
conservation legislation is one of the
very few pointed suggestions put for
ward for the work of the short session.
I'he president approves the secretary
of tho interior's suggestion thnt land
litigants take appeals to the courts in
stead of having to rest their eases with
the land ofiice nnd the secretary.
Generally speaking, our relations with
foreign countries are declared to be in
every wny satisfactory. Tho United
States will direct China's monetary re
form. The course of tho United States
in Central and South American matters
is explained.
Thero is no referenco to tho Rodri
guez incident or to the Mexican insur
rection. Tho only reference to Mex
ico relate to tho ceutcnninl nud the
eordinl reception by Mexico of Ameri
can delegates, and to tho prospective
settlement of the El Paso Boundary dis
pute. However, while thero is no direct
mention of tho Rodriguez incident, the
president makes a vory strong recom
mendation for federal legislation to en
able tho national government to protect
aliens in their political and treaty rights
and safeguard their lives and property
ovon though state overnmenta inny
tind local mobs uncoutroluble and may
be indisposed to protect foreigners nnd
prosecute thnso who violate tho treaty
rights of foreigners.
Tho president recommends tho estab
lishing of n bureau of health and ex
pressly denies that any special school
of medicine would be favored through
such an establishment.
Only twice does the president refer
to "my predecessor," onco in referenco
to c rtain investigations that President
Roosevelt carried on as to conl land
leases in British colonics, and once in
connection wtih the pnyment of tho
Southern Pacific of the claim nrising
out of the successful fight against tho
encroachtnonts of tho Colorado river,
when Presidont Roosevelt personally
solicited aid from the Southern Pacific
and personally promised thnt he would
do what he could to got the government
to reimburse the railroad. This is a
just and honorable debt, and it will be
a national scandal if it i not iui'kly
discharged.
In his messago the prrnident discloses
himself as a most cnutious writer. Ho
lias several times proved himself to lie
vigorous as a constructive statesman
and as a pacificator. He would much
rather act, than write about what he
intends to do, and hii careful and de
liberate, if ponderous message, as chief
executive ought to have the effect of
(piloting down a lot of the senseless agi
tation and smoothing tho way for con
tinued national progress along rational
lines in a spirit of optimism amply justi
fied by tho fuels of tho situation. With
out trying for effect, the president lias
demonstrated his fitness for the job at
this period in the national lifo. Kl Paso
Herald.
Tho President's Message
The message is a rcviow of the va
rious activities of tho deportments of
the government rater than a legislative
plan to be put through the short ses
sion, nnd therefore prssentB vory little
thnt is now or startling. Its philosophy
nnd policy may ho summed up in tho last
paragraph:
T bolievo it to be in the intorcHt of
nil tho people of the country that for
tho timo being the activities of gov
ernment, in addition to enforcing tho
oxisting laws, bo directed toward tho
economy of ndmnistration and tho
enlargement of opportunities for foreign
trade, tho building up of homo indus
tries, and tho strengthening of confi
denco of capital in domestic invest
ment." In other wordn( ProHldont Taft doos
not boliovo that this is tho timo for
radical legislation, for changes in form
of govornmont, for tho adoption of bo
ciullstlo "Istns." Ho Intimates that
generally speaking, there are laws
enough on tho statute books to last for
.sometime nud that thoru is no crying
need for tho introduction of such nov
elties as Oregon is experimenting with
aim as anzoun is writing into us con
stitution. Xo reference is made in the messago
to Xow Me.Uo and Arizona. It Is very
likely that special message will con or
the subject of statehood fur those two
tummoimeulths when tho constitutions
nro submitted with the approval of the
people.
The first part of the messago is de
voted to affaiis of tin department of
state, the progiess of international ar
bitration, t lie negotiation of important t
treaties, the situation in Portugal, Li- (
bona, turkey, .Mouteuegtu, the Jar
Kast, the Latin American Kepublics, Re
ciprocity, the Diplomatic and Consular
selvice.
Oue-tifth of the entire message Is giv
en to this department aud then follows
equally lengthy discussions of tho sub
jects properly grouped under the treas
ury department, the keynote being an
existence on economy uud the introduc
tion of modern methods in department
business, Tho limn estimates for the
fiscal year ending .tune .'10, 1012, are
.0HO,'U 1.01. 1.11!, almost .fiVI.OOO.OOO less
than the appropriations for tho present
fiscal year. This total does not include
'the I'auuma estimate of .fot),000.000. The
estimated revenues are $080,000,000,
which wiuld leave a probablo deficit of
$7,000,000, unless eongiess does not au
thorize the fortifying of the Panama
canal, an expenditure that would invol
ve 1H,000,000. The president advocates
the abandonment of tho haphazard
methods of authorizing public build
ings. As to the Pnyne tariff act, the
president says:
"The schedules of the rates of duty
in tho Payne tariff act have beuu sub
jected to a great deal of criticism, sumo
of it just, more of it unfounded, aud
too much misrepresentation. The net!
wns .lmt...l i.. mir.n nf ii.tnln i-n. I
tiou by tho party which is responsible
for it that a customs bill should be a
tariff for the protection of homo indus
tries, the measure of the protection to be
the difference botwuoti the cost of pro
ducing the imported article abroad aud
the cost of producing it at home, togeth
er with such addition to that difference
as might give a reasonable profit to the
home producer. The basis for tho crit
icism of this tariff is that in respect to
n number of the schedules tho declared
measuro was not followed, but a higher
difference retained or inserted by way
of undue iudustiics and manufactures.
Little, if any, of tne criticism of tho tar
iff has been directed against the pro
tective principle above stated; but tho
main body of the criticism has been bas
ed oa tho charge that tho attempt to'
conform to the measuro of protection '
was not honcstlv and sincerely Kdhcred j
to "
Aftor discussing the work of tho tar
iff board, tho president takes up the
war department. The urmy now mini
bers SO.00O men, nl wl om 18,0d0 nr
engaged in the cimt .ifillory. Ho ad
vocates the passing ( t o pending vol
unteer bill and the -in dishment of a
commission to ileieittiiin u comprehen
sive policy for the nrgm ization, mobili
'nt ion and ailminist rut m . of tho regular
army, the organiei mil tin and volun
teer forces. The neeil ni moro ollleors is
dwelt upon as well a- tl.j speedy forti
fication of eastern pnsn-ooions, including
tho Philippine Islands t.i which as well
as Porto Rico, the Panama Canal, rivers
and harbors, the rest of that part of tho
messago is devoted, advoi-ating a toll for
the Panama Canal not to oxceed $1 por
ton.
Under the heading of tho dopartmont
of justice the president advocates a fed
eral incorporation law, urges tho pay
moat of claims found to bo valid, ruform
and cheapening of judicial procedure,
relief of tho supreme court from unnoc
ossary nppoals, regulation of tho mat
ter of injunctions and tho ineroase in
judicial salaries.
Under tho post oilier department, he
announces that postal savings hanks
will begin business on January 1, 1011 .
In fcovoral towns and cities. The pros
idont points with prido to tho great
Havings instituted by Postmaster (Ion
eral Frank H. Hitchcock in reducing tho
postal deficit nnd returning to tho na
tional treasury $11,1 500,000 of tho appro
priation for tho last fiscnl yonr. Ho al
ludes to tho extension of tho classified
sorvico to assistant postmasters and roe
ommonds that first, second and third
clnss postmnHtors bo plnced undor civil
Horvico. Tho nbuao of tho franking nnd
second elnss privileges nro discussed and
tho adoption of the pnrcols pout on rural
routes ia advocatnd.
Ab to tho navy dopartmont tho pres
ident coincides with Socrotnry Von L.
Moyor, that sovcral of tho nnvy yards
is abolished, dwells on tho introduction

ilisriissioii. Appeals to court in laud
cases, conservation, agricultural lands,
reclamation, forest lands, coal lauds,
oil and gns hinds, water power sites,

the sub divisions in this part of the
.messago. Then the work of the depart

"My experience leads me to believe
thnt while government methods are
much criticised, the hnd results if we
do have bad results--are not due to a
lack of zeal or willingness on the pail
I of the civ il service. On the contrary,
I believe that a tine spirit of willing
ness to work exists in the personality,
which, if properly encouraged, will pio
duce results eipial to those secured in
the best munuged enterprises. In hand
ling government expenditure the film is
not the profit the aim is the maximum
of public service at the minimum of
cost. We wish to reduce the expendi
tures of the government, and we wish to
save money to enable the government
to go into some of the beneficial projects
which are debarred from taking up uow
