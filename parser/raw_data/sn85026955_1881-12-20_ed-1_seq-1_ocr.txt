President's Message.
Tim first aiiuiial message of Preslde.il
Arthur begins with an appropriate and
feeling allusion to the calamity sustain
ed by the country in Ihe tragic death of
his predecessor, and to the touching mau
il'eslalions of syinpalliv anil irood-will
which t.b(! sad occasion cliciicd Irom all
the ualionft of tho earth, and especially
from the people ami sovereign of Great
JJriltaiii. Brief mention la minlis of the
jireseiit stale of diplomatic relations ainl
intercourse with each of the foreign gov
ertimeiils of the world, as well as of par
ticipation of our own country in various
international congresses ami conferences.
An epitomized statement, is furnished,
taUen irom Hie report ol the Secretary
of the Treasury, of the condition of the
national lliiauecs und revenues. The
first important recoiiiiuemlation of the
message is in view of (lie large surplus
Income ol the government, ami the pros.
liectiveol population and Ihe reduction
tiou of the public debt and its burden of
Interest. In view pf the heavy load of
taxation which our pcopliwhavo borne so
long the President concurs w ith (lie Kt-
rotary of the Treasury in recommending
the abolition of all internal revenue tax
es except those upon tobacco in lis vari
ous forms and upon disiilleil spirits and
fermented liipiors, find the special tax
upon inanuiaeiiirers ami Healers in tlicse
articles. Any present reduction in (he
tax upon liipiors and tobacco is deemed
premature in view of the drain upon the
treasury which must attend the payment
of arrears on pensions. In reference to
tliis latter Hiibjoct the President else,
where ivcx Home data In regard to the
enormous amount of work imposed up
on the pension bureau, and suggests, as
n measure of justice as well as economy,
such an increase of the clerical force of
the bureau as will expedite the settle
ment of claim already loo long delayed.
Tim retirement of the outstanding
"silver certlilcntcs" is recommended, anil
the repeal of the- law authorizing their
Issue, al-o Ihe repeal of Ihe law reipiire
Ing thi! coinage of a fixed amount of sil
ver bullion per mouth. 1'nder the law
1(12,000,0111) of silver dollars have been
coined, while only y 1.0011,000 are In clr
eolation. Otherwise Ihe President sug
gests no interference witli the currency,
and no present need of additional legis
lalloii respecting the refunding of the
public debt.
The need of In rift" revlsh n Is rofered lo,
nnd the. suggestion ol a commission for
the purpose favored.
Gen. Sherman's recommendation In
favor of Increasing the army lo ,'M,00U
incu Is approved, and a 'thorough re
habilitation of the navy" urged upon
"every consideration of national safely,
economy and honor."
The President rd'er to the pro .edi
tion of ilm 'war-rome fraud ',1' ami his
desire that it should be vlg i-dy press
ed for the. conviction of the guliiy.
The necessity for some modification of
the judicial system of the I'lillcd Slates,
in view of the great Increase in (lie vol
ume of business in the Federal Courts,
and especially for the relief of the Su
preme. . Court, which is overburdened
with cases, is rccognled and urged up
on the attention of Congiess.
Indian affairs arc treated at some
length, and the President's recommen
dation in relation thereto summed up
under three heads : First, the passage
of an act extending over the Indian
and Indian reservation the protection
mid authority of the courl and laws;
second, the allotment to such Indieim as
may desire It of land in severalty, to be
secured to them by patent an i mule lu
nlicnable lor :.'0 or !' yeara; third, lib
eral npiii'oprlatlon for the support of In
dian schools.
Additional legislation with n view lo
breaking up the revolting practice if po
lygamy In I'lali Ik alronflly recommend
ed. The largest apace devoted to any one
tuple in the message I that given to the
auh)ect of civil sendee reform. The
Pic-blent prefaces what he has lo say
upon this subject by (piollng from and
rcalllriiiiiig certain pasnges in bis letter
of acceptance of the' uomiiialiou of (lie
vice-presidency. The history of civil
nervier reform In Fnglaiid Is briefly re
viewed, and the main principles of the
Publish civil service, aystcin explained.
VVhilo declaring bis readiness to second
any motion of reform which Cungrcs
may adopt, the president point out
some of Ihe practical dllllcultic which
many advocate of reform have I n In
the habit of overlooking or making ilghl
of, ami fliowa the n sdiy of proceed-
lug wllh caution nnd ilclibeisllon. The
v hide dlsciK-loii of the ubecl in the
message Is Intelligent and dNcrtmlnal
lug, and will be read wllh Interest hv
the public. The entile document Is sen
sible ami biislneis-like in It rtatement
nnd suggestions, lluliicd In tone, ami
written In simple direct English, Ills
entirely free from liny flavor of "tal
wnrtlain," or partisanship of any kind,
ami, In short, every May worthy the

about the Capitol yesterday morning, ad
verliscd the fact that the General Assem
bly waa about .to meet. Inside the build

paint and varnish, ihe sight of frescoing
ot tawdry design, ol carpels of the color
of bright leaf tobacco, and group of men
laughing and talking gooil-huniorcdly,
Other members were banking up th

The prevalence of new anil of .clothes
was noticeable. Tho Jteaditistera wear-

walks pacing up ami down trying to get
the still leather coinlortahly ad listed to
their corns before the house were called
to order. The lloor of ihe lobby lias been

members lo order, ami prodeeded lo bus

seemed to be In Mr. Kiddleherger, lit
was not In his seat. He did not answer
the llrst. roll-call. It began to be suppo
sed that lie would not appear, nnd would
for the present thereby admit that there
Is some truth In the rumor ol a duel said
to have taken place between Mr. George

Put while speculation was rife Mr.
Kiddleherger appeared and began voting

It Is satisfactory that Hiirlburt seccen-
trlcilies have been reproved by the State
Department, and we cannot doubt thai
America is sincere In her desire to recon
cile the victor and vampilshed. Ihe
appearance of dictation and partizaiiship
may he explained by imlllnsst of the lu
st ruineiits chosen by the Secretary ol
Stale. U Is not likely that Fnglaiid, or
any F.liropean Stale, will be templed to
