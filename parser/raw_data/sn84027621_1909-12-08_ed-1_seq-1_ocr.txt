shortly after 12 oclock
Opposition to the proposed immed
iate congressional Investigation of the
sugar Import scandals in the New
York custom house and likewise to
any further revision of the tariff at
present absence of any specific rec
ommendation regarding the crisis in
Nicaragua and actual recommenda
tion of legislation to forbid the issuance
uance of judicial injunctions in la
bor controversies without notice and
for the establishment of a system of

Fishkill Landing N Y Dec S
The body of Margaret Doherty the
Vassar student who disappeared Sun
day was found late yesterday in the

carefully planned suicide
Miss Doherty was ambitious to
make her first year at Vassar a cred I

had abandoned a rich parish in New
Jersey to accept his small charge In
Hughsonville expressly that his daugh
ter might be near enough Vassar to
commute Her ambitions however
outran her strength and three weeks
ago she broke down The thought I
that her indisposition had nullified her I
fathers sacrifices for her so preyed
on her mind that the family feared
she might attempt suicide and tried
to keep close watch on her Sunday
morning when her father was at
church furnished the chance she
sought Slipping from the house she
disappeared and the earnest efforts of
many searching parties failed to find
her until yesterday
