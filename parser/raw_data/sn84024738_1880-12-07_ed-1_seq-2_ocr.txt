As wc said Sunday, Mr. Lkwis, in the
prosecution of Ibo Manchester election
judges, assn ted the monstrous proposition
that ?' It is not incumbent upon the Uuitccl
Slates to show fraud or cori upi Ion, or even
mala fides," on their part. This doctrine
is of the very essence ot tyranny. It lends
to sap tbe foundations of tho muniments of
public aud private liberty. It should bc
met at once and crushed, lt means in plain
English tbat a public officer, clothed willi
discretion, and re-quired by law to decide
upon :t given elate of facts, msy be pun?
ished criminally, although he acted wilb fl
pure heart and intended to do right.
The doctrine of the intent as it prevails
in the criminal law is necessarily one of thc
foundation principles of public ju-tice.
Theie is only one criterion bf which the
guilt of men it* to lie tested. [I is whether
the mind ls criminal. And neither in phi?
losophical speculation, uor in reli.ious or
moral sentiment, would any people in any
age allow that a man should bc deemed
trinity unless bis ruiud was so. It is, there?
fore, a principle of our I* ??;)! system, as it
probably is of iverv oilier, that the essence
of an offence is ihe wrongful intent, with?
out svlnch lt cannot exi**t.
Such is the law as expounded by (very
court in Ens-land and ibe United Stutts;
and no case to the contrary can lie pro?
duced. And it ls not only Ijsv, but il is
Justice and morality.
Dr. Waylami, in bil treatise on moral
science, says: "By reference to tbe in?
tention we inculpate or exculpate (libers or
ourielve* without any respect to the hap?
piness or misery actually produced. Let
the result of au act ion be what it may, wt
hold a mau guilty simply on ibe ground of
Intention ; or, on the same ground, we hold
hun innocent." Humor, Ibe great law
writer of Cambridge, quoting thc above,
says: ?'The Judgment of mankind ss hen
pa-sum is laid, bolds this doctrine among
its cherished Jewels. In times of excite?
ment, te*ien men think of vengeance instead
of justice, every guard which reason f-t-ls
around the innocent i* -cast down. But
with the return of reason omes tbe clear
verdict of the public Judgment, thal where
the mind is pure, he who may differ In act
from bis neigh bois has not offended. * * *
Whenever an individual is made to sutler
a punishment which thu coron unity does
not consider be deserve*, so far from i's
glacing on him the muk of contempt, it
