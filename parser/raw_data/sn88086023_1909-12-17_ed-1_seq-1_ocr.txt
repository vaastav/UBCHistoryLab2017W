George Tracy, alias C. W. Arnold,
former driver of the Golden Rule ho
tel bus in this city, is lodged In the
county Jail, churged with the brutal
murder of Andy Rabeal, near Umatil
la on the evening of November 23. He
was arrested on train No. 10, between
The Dalles and Biggs this morning
while on his way back to the scene of
the crime after having unwittingly
eluded the officers in a dozen Cali
fornia towns.
While credit for the Immediate ar
rest Is due to Dell Smith, a former
bartender at Echo, who recognized
the accused man just as Smith was
leaving the train at The Dalles where
Tracy was getting on, it was due en
tirely to the successful work of Sher
iff Taylor and Deputy Wilson that
the identity of the accused man was
discovered Those officers also threw

Though he was extremely nervous
throughout his examination this
morning he expressed no surprise

While the officers are saying little
they are Jubilant over the capture
and say they have the accused man
enveloped in such a strong chain of
evidence that it will be impossible for
him to escape. They refuse, however,
to say of what their evidence consists.

The famous detective bill case wa
decided by Circuit Judge Bean yes
terday afternoon In favor of District
Attorney Phelps and against the in
terests which are seeking to make
the enforcement of the law more dif
ficult. The decision is a decided
victory for law enforcement
and would seem to Indicate that the
district attorney has the power and
I the authority to employ detectives
whenever it becomes necessary In or
der to secure the enforcement of the
local option law.
It will be remembered that more
than a year ago, when violations of
the local option law became numer
ous that District Attorney Phelps em
ployed a detective. In conjunction
with Sam Bannister, a prominent
it-skiem of the east end of the coun
ts', this detective secured informa-'
tiori which when presented to the
giand jury resulted In that body re
turning a large number of indict
ments for violations of the local op
tion law. Most of those indicted en
tered pleas of gu'Ity after one of their
number had been tried and convicted.
The total amount of fines paid into
the coffers of the county at that time
beimj more than $7000.
Detective's Bill Held Up.
In due course or time the detec
tive's bill, amounting to $356 was
presented to tho court. Commission
ers Lee and Walker demurred to its
j payment for the alleged reason that
: they had not been consulted in the
matter. Lee finally came to the con
clusion that the bill should be paid
