HOPE FOR ARMOR PUNT /
Alexandrians are Anxiously Await- I
inff' Government's Decision as to
Site of New Factory. j
i
While not desiring to appear too
sanguine, many people iri Alexandria g
suppose they have reason to believe ^
the officials of the government are
seriously considering the advisability c''
of placing the new armor plant upon tl
the site offered by the city of Alex- k
andria. r:
The Gazette has at different times e
called attention to strange men visit- "
ing the southeastern section of the i'
city during the past summer and the o
fall months, while a man supposed to t<
be a German, was found taking pictures
of the reclaimed ground and the e
property surrounding it. As is stated c
elsewhere, a representative of the si
United States Engineering Depart- a
ment held a conference with several g
of our representative people in the | tl
rooms of the Chamber of Commerce tl
yesterday evening concerning Alexandria's
water front. He said he was .
ascertaining the present condition of 11
the channel which was made shallow
over a quarter of a century ago by jl
flood and the rapid current in theriver
which accompanied it. He may a
have had a two-fold purpose.
Straws show Way Winds Blows. * ^
There is an old saying, "Straws fI
show which way the wind blows."
Should Alexandria be selected as the *
site for the plant there will be im- ^
mediate activity in the real estate Q.
market of this city. Instead of a city w
of twenty thousand inhabitants, Alex- ^
andria wil] be able to list a popula- ^
tion of forty thousand. Houses for
"dwellins: purposes will be in immedi- ^
ate demand, while every store in the p
city will be occupied. ()l
Woolworth to Open Store Here.
One of the straws which has caused t.]
some speculation is the fact that the ja
F. W. Woolworth Company, which c]
conducts the l?r^e five a^d ten-cent q
stores in Washington, Norfolk and
other large cities, has, through Graham
and Ogden, real estate dealers n<
oT Alexandria, leased the store formerly
occupied by Adolp Diedel on the ^
south side of King street, between .
1 c
St. Asaph and Washington streets. ^
The company may be preparing for ^
coming events. The lease extends
for 15 years.
A. gentleman of this city recentlv ^
heard several men talking together in ^
Washington of the installation of the .
new armor plant.The parties seemed ,
I fl
to ho familiar with the claims of othor
cities for this plum. One of
them observed to another that people
of Alexandria, Va., had urged reasons
why the plant should be located-in
their' city which the government'is
studying closely. These ^
parties suggested that it would be the
safest place for such a plant.

Department Visits Citv to c
s
Make Investigation of Conditions, f
A representative from the United t
tatcs engineering; department visit-. F
:1 this city yesterday in order to asertain
conditions now existing on ^
ie Alexandria water front. In the t!
itter part of May, 18S9, incessant
ains for several days caused a fresht
in the river, during which the res- r
rvoir of Johnstown, Pa., gave way c
1 the night, and drowned hundreds j
f people and wrought great damage
o property in that city. 1
While no material damage result- a
d in Alexandria, the tide on that ocasion
reached to th? centre of the
quare on King street, between Lee o
nd Union. Union street was sug- t'
estive of a scene in Venice, the n
horoughfare being covered by water tl
nroughout nearly its entire length, n
c
While the swift current was rag- e
ig in the river a barge broke away ^
rom an upper mooring and sank
thwart the channel between the out?t
lock of the old Alexandria Canal ^
nd Point West, or where the acid ^
rorks of the Alexandria Fertilizer ?
nd Chemical Company now stands, q
he obstruction in the river caused f
ie formation of bars, which were an u
anoyance to navigators for several .x
ears. The barge was finally remov- ^
J, but dredging was necessary in n
rder to obtain a sufficient depth of f,
ater for steamers passing between v
lexandria and Washington. Confess
subsequently made an approriation
for improving the harbor of a
lexandria, and five years ago the 0
otomac in front of this city was y
redged and the mud taken from the a

. .Suffragists Flash Large Velio
Banner While President Wilso
Delivers Message to Congress.
President Wilson's address to Cor
press yesterday was marked by
woman suffrage coup in the pa:
leries?the first real show of orpar
ized militancy in the capital?ant
also by a great demonstration of con
gratulation to the President upor
his re-election, in which many Re
publicans joined with the Democrat:
After acknowledging the prolong
ed cheers and applause which greet
cd his entry to the hall of the Hou?'
the President launched into his ad
dress, reviewing recommendation:
for railroad legislation, a corrup
practices act, and had passed to hi
recommendations for a broader government
for Porto Rico. He was jus
about to begin a sentence ("Tin
present laws governing the island
and regulating the rights and privJ
leges of its people are not just"
when over the rail of the gallery
where sat a party of women sufifrag*
leaders, there fluttered down abovi
the heads of an amazed assemblag*
of Senators and Representatives :
silken banner of suffrage yellow
bearing in great black letters thi
inscription:
"Mr. President, what will yot
io for woman suffrage?"
The suffragists said afterward i
was their protest against the Pres:
Jcnt's plea with Congress for broad
er suffrage for the men of Port*
Rico while he did not mention theii
own cause in his address.
As the banner rippled down th<
suffragists sat smiling and unper
turbed, watching the effect A dim
inutive page, raised 011 the arms <>
men directly under the gallery
grasped the edge of the banner am
snatched it down, President Wilson
attracted by the stir, looked up fron
his reading and apparently taking
in the situation at a glance', smile
broadly and without hesitation or
interruption turned his eyes back t<
lis manuscript and continued his ad
Iress to its end without further de
monstrations.
Policemen and gallery guards
scurried to where the women wen
seated, but contented themselves
with watching the party, as if to pre
rent a further outbreak.
The women who held the banne
were Mrs. .John Rogers, of Nev
York, chairman of the national ad
visory council of the Congressiona
Union; Mrs. YVm. Colt, of New Yorkrepresentative
on the council fron
New York; Mrs. Florence Bayar*

Caroline E. Spencer, of Coloradi
Springs, secretary of the Coloradi
branch of the National Woman'
Party; and Miss Mary G. Kendall
of Baltimore, who . campaigned 11
Oregon for the Woman's Party.
The action of the women in flaunt
ing the banner before the Presiden
was roundly condemned by man)
who spoke their minds freely at th
close of the session, pronouncing i
as a gross breach of etiquette.
President Wilson was greeted b;
loud cheering for two or three min
utes upon his arrival in the hous
which he modestly acknowdelgeO
with smiles, and after shaking hand
very cordially with Vice Presiden
Marshall and Speaker Clarke pro
