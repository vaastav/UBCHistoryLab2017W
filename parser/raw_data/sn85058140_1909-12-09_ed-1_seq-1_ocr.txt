FRENCH fEARS AllAYED
Message of President Taft Has a
Soothing Effeet Upon Euro
pean Countries
Paris Del 8The favorable Im
pression of President Tafts message
reflected In the bourse is reechoed In
the press which calls attention to the
importance of his declarations as to
foreign relations and foresees that the
United States is destined to play an
increasingly powerful part in the
worlds affairs
The Journal des Debats says that if
the United States has not succeeded in
completely winning over the confidence
and sympathy of the Latin republics
she certainly has a potent role in the
far east in the exercise of a prepon
derating Influence in China thus open
Ing Up an immense field for American
investment and by a tactful mixture
of diplomacy and show of force she
has induced Japan to link arms with
her so that they may fetand together
for a status quo in the orient
The Slecle sums up the message as
bespeaking prosperity and confidence
at home and expansion by force or per
suasion abroad It thinks that Presi
dent Tafts remarks on the application
of the maximum duties will do much
to calm European concern over the
new American tariff law

FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN
OF CITY OUT OF SCHOOLS
Four thousand children in Salt Lake do not attend school
They are bettered to be working in the stores and shops of the city and
are thereby violating the compulsory education laws of the state
There are 21000 children amenable to the compulsory education laws
in this city and the school records show that but 17000 are attending
the public schools
These were the startling figures
brought before the principals of all
the public schools at a meeting at the I
city and county building yesterday aft
ernoon and led to an agreement be
tween the principals and Superintend
ent D H Christensen to work for child
labor laws in the state of rtah
Mrs Adolph Simon appeared before
the meeting and made a plea for the
children of Salt Lake declaring that
boys and girls of tender years were
being forced Into the stores and shops
Mrs Simon pointed out the evils of
child labor and showed how it was
having Its effect In Salt Lake and the
rest of Utah
Mrs Simon took statistics gathered
by the Salt Lake school authorities to
show the number of children of school
age who are not attending school and
have not complied with the excuses
provided in the compulsory school at
tenderce law of Utah She said there
were 21000 children of school age in
Salt Lake the age ranging from 8 to
18 years but of this number only 17
000 were attending public prHate and
other schools in the city i
This leaves 4000 not accounted for
and Mrs Simon advanced the theory
that they are at work in stores and
other Institutions of the ctt > She said
there was a crying need for child labor
laws In Utah and that the women of
the city and state should get together
at the next meeting of the state legis
lative body and insist that such laws
be placed upon the statute books
Among other things advocated by Mrs
Simon were a new high school to mak
the west side high school for manual
training and thus provide an added
reason why there should be no child
labor a detention home for girl pub
lic playgrounds for children and more
narks about the city
Trouble for Authorities
Superintendent D H Christens
made a short talk He said the city
school authorities wore having trouble
enforcing the compulsory attendance
law partly through the practice ol
some physicians in signing certificates
showing that the health of the child
not attending school is sufficient to
afford on excuse Superintendent
Christensen said that MI numerous I
cases it had been found that the chil
dren were perfect well and able to
attend school but that they had been
kept out by these excuses
Superintendent Chritenscn agreed
with Mrs Simon that there should be
child labor bWI 1 on the < ituu books
of Utah an < i > Id he hnpII many peo i
ple woulJ RO before tlia next legisla
ture for the puipo < nt iiiiK such
laws drawn and parsed lie bald the
first step for the benefit of the child
bad been taken when the legislature
passed the juvenile court laws and the
compulsory school attendance law but
that these wire insufficient in many
Instances
Though no paper wa signed the
principals went on leioul in fjoi of a
child labor low and will Ink a fight i I
for laws similar to other stales when I
the next Utah legislature gets In ses
