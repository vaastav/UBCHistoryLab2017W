MAC0 MEETING OF FRIENDS OF
9
MOVEMENT WILL CE HELD IN
NEW YORK THIS MONTH TO
DISCUSS MATTER.
WASHINGTON, Dec. parcels
post will be one of the most raiport
act aabjects that the present con
gress will have to deal with,' and the
champions of this movement feel con
fident that gome definite steps will
be taku toward the establishment cf
this sjrstera before congress adjourca
next March..
The fact, that both President Taft,
in his annual message, and. Postmas
ttr Genera Hitchcock in his annual
report, have recommended the ru
ral parcels post, has greatly strength
ened .their hopes, - and they believe
that II encs a system is established
fcr the rural districts, it will only be
a' short time- before it is made gen
eral. James I. Cowles, founder and sec
ictary of tlie Postal Progress League,
says that a vigorous campaign will
be made thU year in Washingtan to
j bring stout the enactment of some
perceU post. legislation.
"Should we fail he continued, 4iw3
shall urga the president to call a
special session 'of tta2nd congress
to take up this matter.
"Every effort is being made by the
members oZ our league throughout
the country to bring about the elec
tion ct senatcis pledged to a parcels
post system. We feel confident that
a majority of the house members are
in favor of such legislation, and now
is our time to make sure of the sen
ace. -
"A mass meeting is to be held in
Cooper Union, New York, Dec. 2J,
which will be. addressed by a number
of prournent business men, and this
will b3 followed by our annual cou
Tentiou in February.
"At present there are two bills be
fore Congress providing for the par
cels post system the Bennett bill
and the Salzer bill. Our league fa
vors the Sulzer bill because-it spec
ifies the limit on packages. If this
bi'l 13 made a law it will save the
people of the country $30,000,000 a
year that they are now pajiug to the
express companies in excessive rates.
Land coEvtrt the annual deficit of the
post office department i-nto a hand
some profit."
Although the sentiment in the
house seems generally favorable to
the parceU post, there is a strong
ractor opposed to it. This is the
house committee on post offices and
