Up to n f;',7 wrt'kn ngn I considered
myself the champion Dyspeptic of
America. Purina: tho years that I
have been ufflk-.ted I havo tried
almost everything claimed to be a
upecitlo for Dyspepsia in the hope of
finding something that would afford
permanent relief, I had about made
up my mind to abandon all medi
cines when I noticed an endorsement
of Simmon Liver Regulator by a
prominent Georgian,, a Jurist whom
I know, and concluded to try its
effects In my case. I have used but
two bottles, and am flattened that I
havo struck tho right thing at last.
I felt its beneticlal effects almost Im
mediately. Unlike all other prepara
tions of a similar kind, no special
Instructions aro required as to what
one shall or shall not eat. This fact
alone ought to commend It to all
troubled with Dyspepsia.

K. I Toner, Secretary of the

speaking of tbe appointment of Gov
ernor Cheney as Senafor from New
Hampshire, says: The Protectionists
have reason to rejoice at the appoint

well equipped by study, travel and
experience to advocate and debate
the question. He was one of the
tounders, and is a member of (lie
Board of Managers of the American

organization of the League was not a

United States Consul General Waller has

New York paper of recent date of an arti

consul in Great llritaiu Is In possession of
trust funds which he Is unable or unwilling
to account for, that lie is In social disre

case to the attention of her majesty's min

THE new cnir suits.
The Secretary of the Navy has accepted
the following bids lor the construction of
the new cruisers and gunboats: Cruiser
No. 2 (Charleston), Union Iron Works of
San Francisco, $1,017,5000; cruiser No. 8
(Baltimore), Cramp & Sous of Philadel
phia, $1,3J5 ooo; gunboat No. 2. the Colum
bia iron Works j Dry-loclc Company of
Baltimore, $247,000. In the case of gun
boat No. 1 no decision has yet been reach
ed as between the bid of lleeder & Sons
and the bid of Cramp & Sons. Although
the Union Iron Works of San Francisco
tmt in the lowest bid on cruiser No. 1 (the
Newark), yet, as the figures exceed the
maximum amount fixed in the appropria
tion bill, the Secretary was unable to ac
cept their bid. He will probably refer the
matter to Congress with a statement ot the
facts, and recommend that the appropria
tion tor the construction of cruiser No. 1 be
Increased, or that the government be au
thorized to build the vessel at one of the
navy-yards.

DOOMED TO SLOW DEATH.
The fato of the Indians captured in the
Miles campaign is practically settled. It
was not dccldod when they were first sent
East whether any of them would he tried
lor crimes or nor. llie l'resident hixs ex
nnilned the case very carefully and has
come lo the conclusion tint lllo confine
incut for all of these Indians in Florida.
where they can do no harm, will be the
most thorough punishment which can be
visited on them. It would bo a travesty on
Justice to have these Indians tried in Ari
zona and new Mexico. There is not a
white . man in either one of tiiose terri
toiles who could sit in a case involving tho
rights or an Indian with any Kind of fair
ness. The conviction of the criminals
would leave their families untouched.
These families would train up children to
revenge tne aeatns ot those who were
punished, and tho result would be a con
tinuation of the lawlessness which for
years has made life and mooertv so inse
cure in the two territories. Asa matter of
fact, the SCO Indians transferred to Florida
have been sentenced to a lingering death.
They havo been brought up in the mount
ain countries, accustomed to iroedom in tno
pure, cold air of high altitudes. Their
transfer to and confinement in tho warm
climato ot Florida will simply result in
their dviuz olf like so manv sheen. Ex

The strain on my nerves was so great that
I nearly lost the use of one of my eyes.
I was suffering very much, and lind never
succeeded in getting anything that would
give me but temporary relief, and that was
of very short duration. The first bottle of
Athlophoros made, a very deciiltd change,
in fact I lird Rome relief from a few doses.
I probably liavc used a dozen bottles, and
it is six months since I had a severe at

am well prepared v I have had limes dur

at linnd a dose or two would drive the
neuralgia away. For neuralgia Allilo
plioro is undoubtedly the best medicine,
and I think I ought to know, ns I have
during the many years that I have suffered
