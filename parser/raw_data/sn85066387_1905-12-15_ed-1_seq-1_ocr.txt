ON STRIKE
Declare That Time
Table Must Be
Changed.
Insist That Lay-Off Be
Given at Outer
Terminals.
If Request Is Denied There
May Be a Walking-Out
of Employes.
The onsen of San Francisco have
taJsen a decided Btsuic against the new
-^*chedul« lcstHuted by Manager Chap
?r.aa cf tfce United Railroads. At a meet
ing held last right, at Eagle Hall, they
passed resolutions requesting the United
H.4lroads to issue a new time table al
. ring five minutes" lay-off at each outer
-. : minus.
'- he men came to the meeting fresh
:r 3i their cars and tile vexations of the
r.ew schedule. They were in a vigorous
Elate cf mind, end President Cornelius
said that, in their present temper, he
coj'3 not vouch for their conduct should
the l-equpst be denied. He inferred that
ihey mieht Etrike.
There were 300 men at the meeting. They
came in platoons as their runs ended,
and ir.any left in the same way during
the evening for their night runs. There
*»re SBOO men employed by the United Rail
, roads, but en eceour.t of the diversity of
hours at which the men work an atiend
c»& nt itfs ,*s -<eft£iA«r<3f is. -good ~oce.-,The
citn" eeeir-ed grim, determined and very ;
mi^ch irritated by the strain put upon
thtm by the new runs.
Their grievance is that the new time
table makes the conditions under which
•..hey work intolerable. The new schedule
la an attempt to keep the same headway
between cars with a less number of cars
or. each route. This is done by reducing
t^-.e time allowed the motorman on his
r'-ute and the time of lay-oSC at the ter
minals. The result, the men say, is to
practically abolish what little time they
had formerly ax the ends of their runs,
to force them to rush their cars along
regardless of the comforts or necessities
of the public, end to keep them in a con
f-'az.i state of nervous tension.
They were free in the expression of
tl cir opinions of this state of things last
y. ght. A motorman of the Suiter-street
. r.e told of having worked his car stead
ily for seven hours without a second at
fejiy of the terminals to get off. The mo
tormen of the Kearny-street line said that
They found It absolutely impossible to keep
to their schedule. On the Ellis-street line
conditions are so bad, a conductor said,
that cars had to be started without glv
ir.g passengers a safe time to get on or
cfi. All of tfce men declared themselves
harassed to nervous prostration by the
jressure of time.
The acceptance by the United Bail
. roads of the request framed last night,
tr ; « men said, will remedy this state of
e^airs. The five minutes' lay -off at the
esa cf each round trip will not only give
ths time necessary for rest and decency,
but will also make the running time more
«iastic, thus enabling the cer crews to
give more attention to the taking on and
cif of the passengers.
President Cornelius of the Carmen's
Union was sanguine In his confidence that
the request would be granted?*" He said,
however, that if it were not granted, con
sidering the present temper of the men,
fee could not exewer for anything. "And
if they refused to work under the pres
ent conditions," he added, '"and 1 had the
power to persuade them to keep at work
1 would not do it. It would be unkind
ness for me to do bo."
Tee resolutions passed will be presented
to the representative of the United Rail
; ads to-morrow.

BARON WANTS
PENSION FROM
WIFE'S FATHER
Objects to His Treat
ment by Cleveland
Millionaire.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Dec 14,— "1 cannot
work. I have not been brought up that
way. I got $40 a week from my wife, but
what is that for a gentleman to live on?"
This was the statement made to-n!gnt
by Baron Max Zigf ried yon Schweidler
Schwartrenburg, who. separated from his
wife, formerly Miss Julia Keidel. daugh
ter of Phil J. Keidel. the Cleveland mil
lionaire, has come to this city to demand
his rights. H e wanta Keidel to support
him in a manner befitting- his station.
The Baron says he married Miss Ke'idel
In New York nine years # ago, having met
her while she was traveling in Europe
with her parents. \u25a0
"After the marriage xnjr wife and I went
abroad," he said. "My father-in-law al
lowed us all the money we needed during
the first year. We spent considerable
time in Paris and Monte Carlo. I recall
now, aa I speak of it, that I lost $12,000
in the Casino while there. But that was
a mere bagatelle. You se©, I had always
thought that Americans who wanted
titles were willing to pay for them. I
know titles only reasonably good that
have brought big money. I figured that
mine was worth millions. For this rea
son I was willing to sacrifice all my in
terests in my family estate. In all these
nine years I have been allowed only
$220,000 by my father-in-law." *
The Baron is living in a rooming
house. The separation between his wife
and himself took place about a year ago.
They were living in Nevf York then. Be
cause they had no money. ; he said, his
wife and their two children returned to
her father's home.' .:. •'
The Baron says h« is a ! lieutenant in
the Kaiser's Fifth Hussars.,. He fears the
publicity of his present affairs will result
in his expulsion from the army.

TWO STATES
FROM FOUR
TERRITORIES
Advocates of Joint
Admission Are
Victorious.
Caucus of House Repub
licans Takes Final
Action.
Measure Adding Two Stars
to Flag Will Be Passed at
This Session.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 14.— The Repub
lican members of the House, in caucus
to-day, unanimously declared In fa\%r of
admitting: Oklahoma and the Indian Ter
ritory as one State, and by a vote of 110
to 65 declared in favor of admitting Ari
zona and New Mexico as one State. Both
statehood questions' are to be contained
In one bill.
The conference which resulted In this
action took place Immediately at the con
clusion of the House session and occupied
an hour and a half. The opposition to
the programme was directed against the
Joining of Arizona and New Mexico, and
It Is understood that Adams of Wisconsin
and Tawney of Minnesota were the only
speakers on this side.
The programme of the leaders was pre
sented at the outset by Hamilton, chair
man of the Committee on 1 Territories, in
a resolution which he offered. It declared'
it to be the sense of the conference that
one State be made- of Oklahoma and the
.lndJan: r TerritQry-and^dh«*State- of 'Ari
zona and-New Mexico," and that the Com
mittee on Territories be "" ; requested to
formulate this plan in one bill."
The Hamilton bill, already introduced,
contains the necessary provisions to meet
this Dlan and undoubtedly will be the
measure reported by the committee.
Hearings on this bill. the question of
embodying a constitutional amendment
prohibiting the sale of liquor In the two
Territories, were begun to-day. Aside
from. this question the bill is practically
in shape to be reported. The liquor hear
ings will not be hurried, and the plan
now Eeems to be to delay reporting the
bill until after the holiday recess. When
It is reported a rule will be brought in
for Its immediate consideration • by tfie
House.
The conference had not proceeded long
when the debate was limited to flve-min
ute speeches, and this action caused com
plaint by those opposing the admission of
New Mexico, and Arizona.
Speaker Cannon took the floor and
spoke vigorously for .the two-State plan.
After' Adams and Tawney had opposed it,
Grosvenor of Ohio took the opportunity
to read a number of newspaper clippings
giving an account of what he termed a
"junket" which a number of members of
the House had taken through the Terri
tories' last summer, at which time they
had publicly stated they would oppose the
admission jointly of Arizona and New
Mexico.

CLARK PAYS
$1,750,000
FOR A MINE
Montananßuysthe
Union in El

First Payment Is Made
on Property and Deeds
Are Recorded.
Famous Gold Producer Is Now
Owned by Millionaire
Senator.
Ececlal Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 14.— Through Los
Angeles men who have mining interests
in El Dorado County the news has been
received here that Senator W. A. Clark
of Montana has- purchased the famous
jUnlon mine on the "mother lode" in that
great mining center. The first papers
have been exchanged,- the first money
paid and If reports be true the transfer
has been regularly recorded at Placer
vllle. The purchase price was $1,730,000,
but' the manner in which payments are
to be made, and when, has not been made
public.
The authority ' for the information is
Phil Larkin, owner of the famous Larkln
mine, a short distance from the Union.
The Union Is one of tue best-known
mining properties in the West. It- was
formerly, owned by Alvinza Hayward and
Charles D. Lane of . San Francisco, who
worked it *to the ' 1400^foot level," ' taking
out immense quantities of bullion. Tha
story of how the vein was lost, how Hay ;
ward, who was a spiritualist, took the
advice of a medium and sold his interest
for a mere trifle, and how the new owners
went deeper and struck richer ore than
the original owners had even dreamed of.
Is part of the mining history of the
State. .
The fifty-stamp mill at the Union was
destroyed by fire on November 4, and has
not been rebuilt and since the fire the
mine has not been worked to its full ca
pacity. Eight months ago the Standard
Oil people offered $1,250,000 for the Union
property, but the offer was declined.
The first intimation that the Montana
Senator was looking at the property came
during his last visit to this State, when
the announcement was made that some
of his experts were examining gold prop
erties in the northern part of the State,
but no particular att© ntion was paid to
the matter. *'
Now comes the statement from an au
thority which here is considered the best
that Senator Clark first offered $1,500,000
and the owners wanted $2,000,000, and that
the final price was a compromise.
