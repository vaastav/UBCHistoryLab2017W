to the National Lawmakers.
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.

Washington; Dec. 3. The president
Bent in the following message to con
press: Foreign Relations.
The present assemblage of the legislative
branch of our government occurs at a time
when the interests of our people and the needs
of the country give especial prominence to the
condition of our foreign relations and the exi
gencies of our national finances. The reports
of the heads of the several administrative de
partments of the government fully and plainly
exhibit what has been accomplished within
the scope of their respee tive duties and pre
sent such recommendations for the better
ment of our country's condition as patriotic
and intelligent labor and observations suggest
I therefore deem .my executive duty ade
quately performed--at this time by presenting
to congress the important phases of our situa
tion as related to our Intercourse with foreign
nations, and a statement of the financial prob
lems which confront us, omitting, except as
they are related to these topics, any reference
to departmental operations. I earnestly in
vite, however, not only the careful considera
tion, but the severely critical scrutiny of the
congress and my fellow countrymen to the re
ports concerning these - departmental
operations. If justly and fairly exam
ined they furnish proof of assiduous and
painstaking effort for the publio welfare.
I press the recommendations they -contain up
on the respectful attention of those charged
with the duty of legislation, because I believe
their adoption would promoto the people's
good.
By amendatory legislation in January last,
the Argentine Republic, recognizing the value
of the large market opened to the free impor
tations of its wool under the last tariff act has
admitted certain products of the "United States
to entry at reduced duties. '"It is pleasing to
note that the efforts we hivo made to enlarge
the exchanges of trade on a sound basis of
mutual benetit are in this iastance appreciated
by the country from which our woolen facto
ries draw their needful supply of raw material.
The missions boundary dispute between the
Argentine Republic and Brazil, referred to the
president of the United States as arbitrator
during the term of my predecessor and which
was submitted to me for determination re
sulted in an award in favor of Brazil upon the .
historical and documentary evidence presented,
thus endin-j a long protracted controversy and
again demonstrating the wisdom and desira
bility of settling International boundary dis
putes by recourse to friendly arbitration.
Negotiations are progressing for "a revival of
the United States and Chilian clai-ms commis
sion, whose work was abruptly terminated
last year by the expiration of the stipulated
time within which awards could be made.
The resumption of specie payments by Chili
Is a step of interest and importance, both in its
direct consequences upon her own welfare as
evincing the tendency of sound financial prin
ciples in one of the most Influential of the
South American republics.

empire which has caused much anxiety and
called for prompt and careful attention.
Either as a result of a weak control by the
central government over the provincial ad
ministrations, following a diminution of tra
ditional government authority under the
stress of an overwhelming national disaster,
or a manifestation upon good opportunity of
the aversion of the Chinese population to all
foreign ways and undertakings, there have
occurred in widely separated provinces of
China serious outbreaks of the old
fanatical spirit against foreigners, which,
unchecked by the local authorities,
if not actually connived at by them, have cul-"
mlnated in mob attacks on foreign missionary
tations, causing much destruction of property
and attended with personal injuries as well as
loss of life. Although but one American citi
ten was reported to have been actually wound
ed, and although the destruciion of property
may have fallen more heavily upon the mis
sionaries of other nationalities than our own,
It plainly behooved this government to take
the most prompt and decided action to guard
Against similar or perhaps more dreadful ca
lamities befalling the hundreds of American
mission stations which have grown up
throughout the Interior of China under the
temperate rule of toleration, custom and im
perial edict.' The demands of the United
States and other powers for the degradation
and punishment of the responsible officials of
the respective cities andprovincesJwho by neg
lect or otherwise had permitted uprising and
for the adoption of stern measures by the em
peror's government for the protection of the
life and property of foreigners, were followed
by the disgrace and dismissal of certain pro
vincial officials found derelict in duty, and the
punishment by death of a number of those ad
Judged guilty of actual participation in the out
rages. This government also Insisted that a special
American commission should visit the province
where the first disturbances occurred for tne,
purpose of investigation. This latter commis
sion, formed after much opposition, has gone
overland from Tien Tsin, accompanied by a
suitable Chinese escort, and by its demonstra
tion of the readiness and ability of our govern
ment to protect its citizens, will act, it is be
lieved, as a most influential deterrent of any
similar outbreaks. The energetic steps that
.have thus far been taken, are all the more like
ly to result in future safety to our citizens in
China, because the imperial government is, I
-am persuaded. entirely convinced that we desire
only the liberty and protection of our own
citizens and redress for any wrongs they may
have suffered, and that we have no ulterior de
signs or objects, political or otherwise. China
will not forget either our kindly service to her
citizens during her late war, nor the further
fact that while furnishing all the facilities at
our command to further the negotiation of
peace between her and Japan we sought no
advantages and interposed no counsel. The
governments of both China and Japan have in
special dispatches transmitted through their
respective diplomatic representatives ex
pressed In a most pleasing man
ner their grateful appreciation of
our assistance to their citizens during the
unhappy struggle and of. the value of our aid in
paving the way to their resumption of peace
xul relations.
The customary cordial relations between
this country and France have been undis
turbed, with the exception that a full explana
tion of the treatment of John I Waller by
the expeditionary military authorities of
France still remains to be given. - Mr. Waller,
formerly United States consul at Tamatave.
remained in Madagascar aftar hia term of
office expired, and was apparently
.successful! in procuring business concessions
.'from the Hovas of greater or less value.
.After the occupation of Tamative and the
declaration of martial law by the French he
was arrested upon various charges, among
them that of communicating military informa
tion to the enemy of France, was tried and
convicted by a military tribunal and sen
tenced to twenty years' Imprisonment. Fol
lowing the course justified by abundant prec
edent, this government requested from that of
France the record of the proceedings .f the
"French tribunal which resulted in Mr. Wal
ler's condemnation. This request has beea
complied with to the extent of supply
ing a copy of the official record,
from which appear the constitution and
organization of the court, the charges as for
mulated and the general course and result of
the trial and by which it is shown that the ac
cused was tried in open court and was defend
ed by counsel. But the evidence adduced in
support of the charges, which was not received
by the French minister of foreign affairs till
the first week in October, has thus far been
withheld, the French government taking the
ground that its production in response to our
demand would establish a bad precedent. The
efforts of our ambassador to procure it,
however, though impeded by recent
changes in the French ministry, have
not been relaxed and It is confidently
expected that some satisfactory solution of
the matter will be reached. Meanwhile it ap
pears that Mr. "Wallers' confinement has every
alleviation which the state of his health and
all the other circumstances of the case de
mand or permit. In agreeable contrast to the
difference above noted respecting a matter of
common concern, where nothing is sought ex
cept such a mutually satisfactory outcome as
the true merits of the case require, is the re
cent resolution of the French chambers favor
ing the conclusion of a permanent treaty of ar
bitration between the two countries-
An Invitation has been extended by France
to the government and people of the United
States to participate in the great national ex
position at Paris in 1899-190:) as the suitable
commemoration of the close of this, the world's
marvelous century of progress. I heartily rec
ommend the acceptance, together with such
legislation as will adequately provide for a due
representation of this government and its peo
ple on the occasion.
Our relation with the states of the German
empire are in some aspects typical of a con
dition of things elsewhere found in a country
whose productions and trade are similar to
our own. The close rivalries of competing in
dustries; the influence of the delusive
doctrine that the internal development
of a nation is promoted and its
wealth increased by a policy which, in under
taking to reserve its home markets for the ex
clusive use of its own producers, necessarily
obstructs their sales in foreign markets and
prevents free access to the products of the
world; the desire to retain trade in time-worn
ruts, regardless of the inexorable laws of new
needs and changed conditions of demand and
supply, and our own halting tardiness in invit
ing a free exchange cf commodities and by this
means imperiling our footing in the external
markets naturally open to us, have created a
situation somewhat injurious to Ameri
can export interests, not only in Ger
many, where they are perhaps most
noticeable, but in adjacent countries.
The exports affected are largely American
cattle and other food products, the reason
assigned for unfavorable discrimination being
that their consumption Is deleterious to the
public health. This is all the more irritating
in view of the fact that no European state is
as jealous of the excellence and wholesome
ness of its exported food supplies as the
United States, nor so easily able on account of
inherent soundness, to guarantee these qual
ities. Nor are these difficulties confined to
our food products designed for exportation.
Our great insurance companies, for example,
having built up a vast business abroad and
invested a large share of their gains
in foreign countries in compli
ance with the local laws and regulations
then existing, now find themselves within a
narrowing circle of onerous and unforeseen
conditions, and are confronted by the necessity
of retirement from a field thus made unprofit
able, if, indeed, they are not summarily ex
pelled, as some of them have lately been from
Prussia. It is not to be forgotten that inter
national trade cannot be one sided. Its cur
rents are alternating and its movements should
be honestly reciprocal.
Our relations with Great Britain, always
Intimate and important, have demanded, dur
ing the past year, even a greater share of con
sideration than is usuaL Several vexatious
questions were left undetermined by the de
cision of the Behring sea arbitration tribunal.
The application of the principles laid down by
that august body has not been followed by the
results they were intended to accomplish,
either because the principles themselves
lacked in breadth and definiteness or because
their execution has been mot-e or less imper-,
feet. Much correspondence has been exchanged
between the two governments on the subject of
preventing the exterminating slaughter of seals.
The insufficiency of the British patrol of the
Behring sea under the regulations agreed on
by the two governments has been pointed out,
and only two British ship? have done police
duty during this season In these waters. The
need of a more effective enforcement of exist
ing regulations, as well as the adoption of such
additional regulations as experience has shown
to be absolutely necessary to carry out the In
tent of the award, have been earnestly urged
upon the British government, but thus far
without effective results. In the mean time
the depletion of the seal herds by means of
pelagic hunting has so alarmingly progressed
that unless their slaughter is at once effectively
checked their extinction within a few years
seems to be a matter of absolute certainty.
The understanding by which the United States
was to pay and Great Britain to receive a lump
sum of 14:25,000 in full settlement of all British
claims for damages arising from our seizure of
British sealing vessels unauthorized under the
award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration was
not confirmed by the last congress, which de
clined to make the necessary appropriation. I
am still of the opinion that this arrangement
was a judicious and advantageous one for the
government, and I earnestly recommend that
it be again considered and sanctioned. If.
however, this does not meet with the favor of
congress. It certainly will hardly dissent from
the proposition that the government is bound
by every consideration of honor and good faith
to provide for the speedy adjustment of these
claims by arbitration as the on'.y other alter
native. A treaty cf arbitration has, therefore,
been agreed upon and will be immediately laid
before the senate. '
The completion of the preliminary survey of
that Alaskan boundary which follows the con
tour of the coast from the southernmost point
of Prince of Vales island until It strikes the
141st meridian at or near the summit of Mount
St Ellas awaits further necessary appropria
tion, which is urgently recommended. This
survey was undertaken under provisions of the
convention entered into by this country and
Great Britain July 2:2, 1892. and the supple
mentary convention of February 8, 1894-
As tc the remaining section of the Alaskan
boundary, which follows the 141st meridian
northwardly from Mount St. Elias to the frozen
ocean the settlement of which involves the
physical location of the meridian mentioned,
no conventional agreement has yet been made.
I call attention to the unsatisfactory deline
ation of the respective jurisdictions of the
United States and tbe Dominion of Canada
In the great lake. at the approaches to the
narrow waters that connect them. The waters
in question are frequented by fishermen of
both nationalities and their nets are theri
used. Owing to the uncertainty and ienorance
as to the true boundary .vexatious disputes and
injurious seizures of boats and nets by Cana
dian cruisers often occur, while any positive
settlement thereof by an accepted standard is
not easy to be reached.
It being apparent that the boundary dispute
between Great Britain and the republic of
Venezuela, concerning the limits cf British
Guiana was approaching an acute stage, a
definite statement of the interest and policy of
the United Sta tes as regards the controversy
seemed to be required, both on its own ac
count and in view of its relations with the
friendly powers directly concerned. In July
last, therefore. a dispatch was ad
dressed to our ambassador at London
tor communication to the British government
in which the altitude of the United States was
fully and distinctly set forth. The general
conclusions there reached and formulated are
in substance, that the traditional and estab
lished policy of this government is firmly op
posed to a forcible increase by anv European
power of its territorial possessions on this
continent: that this policy is as well founded
In principle as it is strongly supported by r'l
merous precedents: that as a consequence the
UnitedStates is bound to protest against the en
largement of the area of British Guiana in dero
gaiion of the rights and against the will ol
Venezuela: that, considering the disparity in
strength of Great Britain and Venezuela,
the territorial dispute betwean mem can ba
reasonably settled oaly by friendly and impar
tial aroitratioa and that the resort to su;h ar
bitration should include the whole controversy
and is not satisfied if ote of the powers con
cerned is permitted to draw an arbitrary line
through the territory In debate and to declare
that it will submit to arbitration only the por
tion lying on one side of it In view of these con
elusions the dispatch In question called upon
the British government for a definite answer
to the questioa whether it would or would not
submit the territorial controversy between
itself and Venezuela in Its entirety to impar
tial arbitration.
The answer of the British jrovernraent has
not yet been received, but is expected shortly,
when further communication on the subject
will probably be made to the congress.
Early in January last an uprising against
the government of Hawaii was promptly sup
pressed. Martial law was forthwith pro
claimed and numerous arrests were made of
persons suspected of being in sympathy with
the royalist party. Among these were several
citizens of the United States, who were either
convicted br a military court and sentenced
to death or imprisonment or fine, or were de
ported without trial The United States,
while denying protection to such as had
taken the Hawaiian oath of allegiance,
insisted that martial law, though altering the
forms of justice could not supercede justice it
self and demanded a stay of execution until
the proceedings bad been submitted to this
government and knowledge obtained there
from that our citizens had received fair trial.
The death sentences were subsequently com
muted or were remitted on condition of leaving
the islands.
Japan has furnished abundant evidence of
her vast gain in every trait and characteristic
that constitutes a nation's greatness. We have
reason for congratulation in the fact that the
government of the United States, by the ex
change of treaty stipulations with the new
Japan, was the first to recognize her wonderful
advancement and to extend to her the consid
eration and confidence due to her national en
lightenment and progressive character.
Cuba is again gravely disturbed, an insurrec
tion in some respects more active than the last
preceding revolt, which continued from 1863
to 1878, now exists in a large part of the eastern
interior of the island, menacing even some pop
ulations on the coast Beside deranging the
exchanges of the island, of which our country
takes the predominant share, this flagrant con
dition of hostilities by arousing sentimental
sympathy and inciting adventurous support
among our people, has entailed earnest effort
on the part of this government to enforce obe
dience to our neutrality laws and to prevent
the territory of the United States from being
abused as a vantage ground from which to aid
those in arms against Spanish sovereignity.
Whatever may be the traditional sympathy
of our countrymen as individuals with people
who seem to be struggling for larger autonomy
and greater freedom, deepened as such sympa
thy naturally must be in behalf of our neigh
bor, yet the plain duty of their government
is to observe in good faith the recognized obli
gations of international relationship. The
performance of this duty should not be made
more difficult by a disregard on the part of our
citizens of the obligations growing out of their
allegiance to their country, which should re
strain them from violating, as individuals, the
neutrality which the nation of which they are
members is bound to observe in its relations
to friendly sovereign states. Though neither
the warmth of our people's sympathy with the
Cuban insurgents, nor our loss and material
damage consequent upon the futile endeavors
thus far made to restore peace and order,
nor any shock our humane sensibilies may
have received from the cruelties which appear
to especially characterize this sanguinary and
fiercely conducted war, have in the least shak
en the determination of the government to
honestly fulfill every international obligation,
yet, it is earnestly hoped, on all grounds,
that the devastation of armed conflict may
speedily be stayed and order and quiet restored
to the distracted Island, bringing in their train
the activity and thrift of peaceful pursuits.
Vigorous protests against excessive fines im
posed on our ships and merchants by the ships,
officers of these islands for trivial errors have
resulted in the remission of such fines in in
stances the equity of the complaint was appar
ent, though the vexatious practice has not
been wholly discontinued.
Occurrences in Turkey have continued
to excite concern. The reported massa
cres of Christians in Armenia and the de
velopment there, and in other districts, of
the spirit of fanatic hostility to Christian in
fluences naturally excited apprehension for
the safety of the devoted men and women, who
as dependents of the foreign missionary soci
eties in the United States all reside in Turkey
under the guarantee of law and usage and in
the legitimate performance of their educa
tional and religious mission. No efforts have
been spared in their behalf and their protection
in person and property has been earnestly and
vigorously enforced by every means within our
power. The presence of our naval vessels which
are now in the vicinity of the disturbed localities
affords opportunities to acquire a measure of
familiarity with the condition of affairs and
will enable us to take suitable steps for the
protection of any interests of our countrymen
within reach of our ships that might be found
imperiled.
The Financial Situation.
As we turn frcm a review of our foreign re
lations to the contemplation of our national,
financial situation we are immediately aware
that we approach a subject of domestic con
cern more important than any other that can j
engage our attention and pne at present in
such a perplexing and delicate predicament as
to require prompt and wise treatment We
may well be encouraged to earnest effort in
this direction when we recall the steps already
taken toward improving our economic and finan
cial situation, and when we appreciate how well
the way has been prepared for further progress
by an aroused and intelligent popular interest
in these subjects. By command of the people,
a customs revenue system, designed for the
protection and benefit of favored classes at the
expense of the great majority of our country
men and which, while Inefficient for the pur
pose of revenue, curtailed our trade relations
and impeded our entrance to the markets oi
the world, has been superceded by a tar
iff policy which, in principle is
based upon a denial of the right
of the government to obstruct the avenues tc
our people's cheap living or lessen their com
fort and contentment, for the sake of accord
ing especial advantages to favorites, and
which, while encouraging our intercourse and
trade with other nations, recognize the fact
that American self-reliance, thrift and inge
nuity can build up our country's industries and
develop its resources more surely than ener
vating paternalism. The compu'.sory purchase
and coinage of silver by the government, un
checked and unregulated by business condi
tions and heedless of our currency needs,
which for more than fifteen years
diluted our circulating medium, under
mined confidence abroad In our financial
ability and at last culminated In distress and
panic at home has been recently stopped by
tbe repeal of the laws which forced this reck
lesfc scheme upon the country. The things
thus accomplished, notwithstanding theii
extreme importance and beneficent effects,
fell far short of curing the monetary evils from
which we suffer as a result of long indulgence
in ill alvised financial expedients. The cur
rency denominated United States notes and
commonly known as greenbacks was Issued in
large volume during the late civil war and in
tended originally to meet the emergencies oi
that period.
It will be seen by a reference to the debates
in congress at the time laws were passed au
thorizing the issue of these notes that iheii
advocates declared they were Intended for oulj
temporary use and to meet the emerjf ency ol
war. In almost, if not all. the laws relating t
them some provision was made contemplating
their vo untary or compulsory retirement A
large quantity of them, however, were kept or
foot and mingled with the currency of the
country, so that at the close of the year 1X7
they amounted to J331 ,99,073. Immediately
after that date and in January, 187, a law was
passed providing for the resumption of specif
payment, by which the secretary of the treas
ury was required, whenever additional
circulation was issued to national banks
to retire United States notes equal in amount
to8J per cent of such additional nationa:
bank circulation until such notes were re
duced to 3JJ,0)3.0M. This law further pro
vided that oa and after tho first d ly of Janu
ary. 1379, the United States notes then out
standing should be redeesel In coin, and lii
order to provida aud prepare for such re-
iemption the secretary of the treasury was
uthorized not only to use any surplus reve
ues of the government, but to Issue bonds of
the United States and dispose of them for
coin and to use the proceeds for
the purposes contemplated by the statute
In May. 1S78, and before the date thus appoint
ed for the redemption and retirement of these
notes, another statue was passed forbidding
their further cancellation and retirement
Some of them had, however, been previously
redeemed and canceled upoa the issue of addi
tional national bank circulation, as permitted
by the law of 137 so that the amount out
standing at the time of the passage of the act
forbidding their further retirement was $36,
81,016. The law of 1878 did not stop at dis
tinct prohibition, but contained, in addition,
the following provision: "And when
ny of said notes may be redeemed or
be received Into the treasury, under any
law, from any source whatever. and
shall belong to the United States, they shall
not be retired, canceled, or destroyed, but they
shall be reissued and made out again and kept
in circulation. This was the condition of af
fairs on the 1st day of January, 1879, which had
been fixed upon four years before as the date
for entering upon the redemption and retire
ment of all these notes, and for which such
abundant means had been provided. The gov
ernment was put in the anomalous situation of
owing to the holders of these notes debts pay
able in gold on demand, which could neither be
retired by receiving such notes in discharge of
obligations due the government, nor canceled
by actual payment in gold. It was forced to
redeem without redemption and to pay without
acquittance.
There has been Issued and sold $95,"01,030 of
the bonds authorized by the resumption act
of 187, the proceeds of which, together with
the gold in the treasury, created a gold
fund deemed sufficient to meet the demands
which mighi be made upon it for the redemp
tion of the outstanding United States notes.
This fund, together with such other gold as
might be from time to time in the treasury
available for the same purpose, has been since
called our gold reserve and $10J,00).000 has
been regarded as an adequate amount to ac
complish its object This fund amounted on
the 1st day of January, 1879, to $111,190,135
and though thereafter constantly fluctuating,
it did not fall below that sum in July, 1892. In
April, 1813, for the first time since its estab
lishment, this reserve amounted to less tban
$100,000,000, containing at that date only $97,
011 ,3:i0. In the meantime and in July, 1890, an
act had been passed directing large govern
mental monthly purchases of silver than had
been required under previous laws and provid
ing that in payment for silver treasury notes
of the United States should be issued payable
on demand in gold or silver coin at the discre
tion of the secretary of the treasury, it was,
however, declared in the act to be the estab
lished policy of the United States to maintain
the two metals on a parity with each
other upon the present legal ratio, or
such ratio as may be provided by law.
In view of this declaration it was not deemed
permissible for the secretary of the treasury
to exercisa the discretion in terms conferred
on him by refusing to pay gold on these notes
when demanded, because by such discrimina
tion in favor of the gold dollar, the so-called
parity of the two metals would be destroyed
and grave and dangerous consequences would
be precipitated by affirming or accentuating
the constantly widening disparity between
their actual value under the existing ratio.
These obligations are the instruments which
ever since we have had a gold reserve, have
been used to deplete it
This reserve, as has been stated, had fallen
In April, 1893, to 197,01 1,33 . It has from that
time to the present, with very few and im
portant movements, steadily decreased, except
as it has been temporarily replenished by the
sale of bonds Among the causes for this con
stant and uniform shrinkage in this fund may
be mentioned the falling off of exports under
the operation of the tariff law until recently in
force, which crippled our exchange of com
modities with foreign nations and necessitated
to some extent the payment of our balances in
gold the unnatural infusion of silver into our
currency and the increase in agitation
for its free and unlimited coinage
which have created apprehension as to our dis
position or ability to continue gold payments,
the consequent hoarding of gold at home and
the stoppage of investments of foreign capital
as well as the return of our securities already
sold abroad and the high rate of foreign ex
change, which induce the shipment of our gold
to be drawn against us as a matter of specula
tion. In consequence of these conditions the
gold reserve on the 1st day of February, 1894,
was reduced to.$6i,433,377, having lost more
than $31. 03,000 during the preceding nine
months, or since April, 1893. Its replenishment
being necessary and no other manner of ac
complishing it being possible, resort was
had to the issue and sale of bonds pro
vided for by the resumption act of 1875.
Fifty millions of these bonds were sold, yield
ing 553,633,295.71, which was added to the re
serve fund of gold then on hand. As a result
of this operation this reserve, which had suf
fered constant and large withdrawals in the
meantime, stood on the 6th day of March, 1694,
art the sum of $107,443,812. Its depletion was,
however, immediately thereafter so accelerated
that on the 3th dav of June, 1891, it had fallen
to $54,873,02., thus losing by withdrawals more
than $42, 00,)00 In five months and dropping
slightlv below this situation when the sa?e of
fcO, 000,000 in bonds was effected for its redemp
tion. This depressed condition grew worse,
and on the 2oth day of November, 1894,
our gold reserve was drained to $7, -69.01.
It became necesiary to again strengthen it.
This was done by another sale of bonds
amounting to 50,0)0,000, from which there was
realized $58,538,500 with which the fund was in
creased to $111,012,021 on the 4th day of De
cember, 1894. Again disappointment awaited
the anxious hope for relief. There was not
even a lull in the exasperating withdrawals of
gold. On the contrary. the irrcw larger and
more persistent than ever. Between the 4th
day of December, 1894, and early in February,
189", a period of scarcely more than two
months after the second reinforcement of our
gold reserve by the sale of bonds it had lost
by such withdrawals more than $;59,000,oiX), and
had fallen to $41,03 ,181. Nearly $43,000,00) had
been wltdrawn within the month immediately
preceding this situation.
In this emergency, and in view of its sur
rounding perplexity, it became entirely appar
ent to those upon whom the struggle for safety
was devolved not only that our gold reserve
must, for the third time in less than thirteen
months, be restored by another issue and sale
of bonds, bearing a rate of interest and badly
suited to their purpose, but that a plan must
be adopted for their disposition promising bet
ter results than realized on the previous sales.
An agreement, therefore, was made with a
number of financiers and bankers whereby

ment has paid In gold more than nine-tenths
of Its United States notes and still owes them
alL It has paid in gold about one-hall of its
notes siren for silver purchases without ex
tinguishing by such payment t of those notes.
And added to'all this we are reminded that to
carry tout uus, astounding financial system the
government ha incurred a bonded indebted
ness of f9".,?0J,00J in establishing a gold reserve
and of $162,31 , 40) In efforts to maintain it
I am convinced the only thorough and prac
ticable remedy for our troubles Is found in the
retirement and cancellation of our United
States notes, commonly called greenbacks and
the outstanding treasury notes issued by the
government in payment of silver purchased
under the act of 1890.
The currency withdrawn by the retirement
of the United States notes and treasury notes,
amounting to probably less than $0,000.0)0,
might be supplied by such gold as would be
used on their retirement or by an increase in
the circulation of our national banks. Though
the aggregate capital of these now in existence
amounts to more than 666,00J,030. their out
standing circulation based on bond security
amounts to only about $i9J,000.000.
I think they ought to be allowed to Issue cir
culation equal to the par value of the bonds
they deposit to secure it, and that the tax on
their circulation should be reduced to X of 1 per
cent, which would undoubtedly meet all the
expenses the government incurs on their ac
count I do not overlook the fact that the can
cellation of the treasury notes Issued under
the silver purchasing act of 1890 would leave
the treasury in the actual ownership of suffi
cient silver, including seigniorage to coin
nearly $178,0 )0,0;0 in standard dollars. It is
worthy of consideration whether this might
not. from time to time, be converted Into dol
lars or fractional coin and slowly put into cir
culation. In the present stage of our difficulty it is
not easy to understand how tbe amount of our
revenue receipts directly affects it The im
portant question is not the quantity of money
received in revenue payments, but the kind of
money we maintain and our ability to continue
In sound financial conditions. We are consid
ering the government holding of gold as re
lated to the soundness of our money and as af
fecting our national credit and monetary
strength. If our gold reserve bad never been
impaired: if no bonds had been issued to re
plenish; if there had been no fear and
timidity concerning our ability to continue
gold payment: if any part of our
revenues were now paid in gold:
and if we could look to our gold receipts as a
means of maintaining a safe reserve, the
amount of our revenues would be an influen
tial factor in the problem. But unfortunately
all the circumstances that might lend weight
to this consideration are entirely lacking. In
our present predicament no gold is received by
the government in payment of revenue charges,
nor would there be if the revenues were in
creased. The receipts of the treasury when
not in silver certificates consist of United
States notes and treasury notes, issued for sil
ver purchases. These forms of money are only
useful to the government in paying its cur
rent ordinary expenses and its quantity
in government possession does not in the
least contribute toward giving us the kind of
safe financial standing or condition which is
built on gold alone. If it is said that these
notes if held by the government can be used
to obtain gold for our reserve, the answer is
easy. The people draw gold from the treas
ury on demand upon United States notes, but
the proposition that the treasury can on de
mand draw gold from the people upon them
would be regarded in these days with wonder
and amusement. And even if this could be
done, there is nothing to prevent those thus
rarting with their gold from regaining it by
the next day or the next hour by the presenta
tion of the notes theyreceived.in exchange for it.
The secretary of the treasury might use such
notes taken from a surplus revenue to buy
gold in the market Of course he could not do
this without paying a premium. Private hold
ers of gold, unlike the government, having no
parity to maintain, would not be restrained
from making the best bargain possible when
they furnished tjold to the treasury: but the
moment the secretary of the treasury bought
gold on any terms above par he would estab
lish a general and universal premium upon it.
thus breaking down the parity between gold
and silver which the government is
pledged to maintain, and opening the
way to new and serious complications.
In the meantime the premium would not re
main stationary and the absurd spectacle
might be presented of an alien selling gold to
the government, and with United States notes
in his hands immediately clamoring for its re
turn and a resale at a higher premium. It
may be claimed that a lrge revenue and re
duced receipts might favorably affect the situ
ation under discu-sion by affording an oppor
tunity affecting these notes in the treasury
when received, and thus preventing their pre
sentation for gold.
Such retention of the metal ought to be at
least measurably permanent, and this Is pre
cisely what is prohibited so far as United
States notes are concerned.
By the law of 1873. forbidding their future
retirement, that statute in so many words
provides that these notes when received into
the treasury and belonging to the United
States shall be "paid out again and kept in
circulation." It will moreover be readily seen
that the government could not refuse to pay
out United States notes and treasury notes in
current transactions when demanded and In
sist on paying out silver alone and still
maintain the parity between that metal and
the currency representing goli. Besides the
accumul tion in the treasury of currency of
any kind exacted from the people through tax
ation Is justly regarded as an evil and it can
not proceed far without vigorous protest
against an unjustifiable retention of money
from the business of the country and a de
nunciation of a scheme of taxation which
proves itself to be unjust when it takes from
the earnings and Income of the citizen money
so much in excess of the needs of government
support that large sums can be gathered and
kept in the treasury. Such a condition was a
peril in time of surplus revenue and led the gov
ernment to restore currency to the people by
the purchase of its unmatured bonds at a large
premium and by a large Increase of its depos
its In national banks, and we easily remember
that the abuse of treasury accumulation has
furnished a most persuasive argument in favoi
of legislation radically reducing our tariff tax
ation. Perhaps It is supposed that sufficient rev
enue receipts would In a sentimental way im
prove the situation by inspiring confidence in
our solvency and allaying the fear of pecuniary
exhaustion. And yet all through our struggles
to maintain our gold reserve there never has
been any apprehension as to our ready ability
to pay our way with such money as we had and
the question whether or not our current re
ceipts met our current expenses has not en
tered into the estimate of our solvency. Ol
course the general state of our funds exclusive
of gold was entirely immaterial to the foreign
creditor and investor. His debt could only be
paid in gold and his only concern was our abil
ity to keep on hand that kind of money.
Inasmuch as the withdrawal of our gold has
resulted largely from fright, there is nothing
apparent that will prevent its eontinnance oi
recurrence, with its natural consequences, ex
cept such a change In our financial methods as
will reassure the frightened and make the de
sire for gold less Intense. It is not clear how
an increase in revenue, unless it be in gold, can
be satisfactory to those whose only anxiety istc
gain gold from the government's store. It can
not, therefore, be safe to rely upon increased
revenues as a cure for our present troubles.
Although the law compelling an increased
purchase of silver by the government was
passed on the 14 th day of July, 1E9J, withdraw
als of gold from the treasury upon the note
given in payment on such purchase did not be
gin until October, 1891. Immediately following
that date the withdrawals upon both these
notes and United States notes increased verj
largely, and have continued to such an extent
that since the passage of that law there has
been more than thirteen times as much gold
taken out of the treasury upon United States
notes and treasury notes issued for silver pur
chases as was withdrawn during the eleven
and half years immediately prior thereto, and
aftr the first day of January, 18;, when spe
cie payments were resumed.
I have constantly bad In mind the fact that
many of my countrymen, whose sincerity 1
do not d-ubt. insist that the cure for tbe ills
now threatening us may be found In the single
and simple remedy of the free coinage of sil
ver. They contend that our mints shall be at
once thrown open to th9 free and unlimited
and Independent coinage of both go'd and sil
ver dollars of full legal tender quality, regard
less of tbe action of any other government and
In full view ol the fact that the. ratio oetveem
the metals which they suggest) calls fee icJ
cents worth of gold in the gold dollar at th
present standard and only 50 cents in intrinsic
worth of silver In the silver dollar.
Were there infinitely stronger reasons than
can be adduced for hoping that such action
would secure for us a bimetallic currency mov-'
Ing on lines of parity, an experiment so novel
and hazardous as that proposed might well
stagger those who believe that stability Is an
imperative condition of sound money. No
government, no human contrivance or act of
legislation has ever been able to hold the
two metals together In free coinage aft
a ratio appreciably different from that which
Is established in the markets of the world.
Those who believe that our independent free
coinage of silver at an artificial ratio with gold
of 18 to 1 would restore the parity between the
metals and consequently between the coins op
pose an unsupported and improbable theory
to the belief and practice of other nations and
the teachings of the wisest statesmen and
economists of the world, both In the past and
present and what is far more conclusive they
run counter to our own actual experiences.
Twice In our earlier history our law makers in
attempting to establish a bimetallic currency
undertook free coinage upon a ratio which ac
cidentally varies from the actual rela
tive value of the two metals not more than
per cent in both cases, notwithstanding
great difficulties and cost of transportation
than now exist the coins whose intrinsic worth
were undervalued in the ratio gradually and
surely disappeared from our circulation and
went to other countries where their real value
was better recognized. Acts of congress were
impotent to create equality where natural
causes decreed even a slight inequality. Twice
in our recent history we have signally failed to
raise by legislation the valne of silver. Under
an act or congress in l7 the government was
required for more than eleven years to extend
annually at least $26,00 ),000 in the purchase In
sliver bullion for coinage.
The act of July 14, 189 , In a still bolder ef
fort increased the amount of silver the gov
ernment was compelled to purchase and forced
it to become the buyer annually of 54,000,000
ounces, or practically the entire product of our
mines. Under both laws silver rapidly and,
steadily declined in value. The prophecy and
the expressed hope and expectation of those
In the congress, who led in the passage of the
last mentioned act that it would r-establlsh
and maintain the former parity between the
two metals are still fresh in our memory.
In the light of taese experlenaes, which ac
cord with the experience of other nations,
there is certainly no secure ground for the be
lief that an act of congress could now bridge
an inequality of 53 per cent, between gold and .
silver at our present ratio, nor is there the
least possibility that our country, which has
less than one-seventh of the silver money in
the world, could by its action alone raise not)
only our own but all silver, to its lost ratio
with gold. Our attempt to accomplish this by
the free coinage of silver at a ratio differing
from the actual relative value would be the
signal for a complete departure of gold from
our circulating, the immediate and large con-
age in the real value and monetary efficiency
of all other forms of currency as they settled
to the level of silver monometallism. -
In a self-invited struggle through darkness
and uncertainty our humiliation would be In
creased by the consciousness that we had
parted company with all the enlightened and
progressive nations of the world, and were
desperately and hopelessly striving to meet
the stress of modern commerce and competi
tion with a debased and unsuitable currency,
and in association with the few weak and lag
gard nations which have silver alone as their
standard of value. All history warns us
against rash experiments which threaten .
violent changes in our monetary standard and
degradation of our currency.
The past is full of lessons, teaching not only
the economic dangers, but the national immor
ality that follows in the train of such experi
ment I will not believe that the American
people can be persuaded, after sober delibera
tion, to jeopardize tneir nation s prestige ana
proud standing by encouraging financial nos
trums, nor that they will yield to the false al
lurements of cheap money, when they realize
that it must result in the weakening of that
financial integrity and rectitude which thus
far in our history has been so devotedly cher
ished as one of the traits of true Americanism.
Our country's Indebtedness, whether owing
by the government or existing between indi
viduals, has been contracted with reference to
our present standard. To decree by act of con
gress that these debts shall be payable in less
valuable dollars than those within the con
templation and intention of the parties when
contracted, would operate to transfer, by the
fiat of law and without compensation, an
amount of property and a volume of rights and
interests almost incalculable. Those who ad
vocate a blind and headlong plunge to free
coinage in the name of bimetallism and pro
fessing the belief, contrary to all ex
perience, that we could thus estab
lish a double standard and a
concurrent circulation of both metals in our
coinage are certainly reckoning from a cloudy
standpoint. Our present standard of value is
the standard of the civilized world and per
mits the only bimetallism now possible or at
least that within th3 independent reach of any
single nation, however powerful that nation,
may be. While the value of gold as a standard
is steadied by almost universal commercial and
business usage, it does not despise silver nor
seek its banishment. Wherever this standard
is maintained there is at its side in free and
unquestioned circulation a volume of silver
currency sometimes equaling and sometimes
even exceeding it in amount, both ma intained
at a parity notwithstanding a depreciation or
fluctuation in the intrinsic value of silver.
There is a vat difference between a stand
ard of value and a currency for monetary use.
The standard must necessarily be fixed and
certain. The currency may be in diverse forms
and f various kinds. No silver standard
country has a gold currency in circulation, bus
an enlightened and wise system of finance se
cures the benefits of both gold and silver as
currency and circulating medium by keeping
the standard stable and all other currency aft
par with It Such a system and such a stand
ard also gives free scope for the use and ex
pansion of a safe and conservative credit
so indispensable to broad and growing,
commercial transactions and so well
substituted for the actual use of money.
If a fixed and staple standard is maintained,
such as the magnitude of safety of our com
merclal transactions and business require the
use of money itself is conveniently minimized."
Every dollar of fixed and stable value has
brought the agency of confident credit In as
tonishing capacity of multiplying Itself In
financial work. Every unstable and fluctuat
ing doliar falls as a basis of credit and Its use
begets gambling speculation and undermines
the foundations of honest enterprise. I have
ventured to express myself on these subjects
with earnestness and plainness of speech be
cause I cannot rid myself of the belief thaft
there lurks in the proposition for the free coin
age of silver so strougly approved and so en
thusiastically advocated by a multitude
of my countrymen a serious menace to our
prosperity and an Insidious temptation of our
people to wander from tbe allegiance they owe
to public and private integrity. It is because
I do not distrust the good faith and sincerity
of those who press this soheme that I have Im
perfectly but with zeal submitted my thoughts
upon this momentous subject. I cannot re
frain from begging them to re-examine their
views and beliefs in the light of patriots,
reason and familiar experience, and to weigh
again and again the consequences of such leg
islation as their efforts have invited. Eren
the continued agitation of the subject adds
greatly to tbe difficulties of a danger
ous financial situation already forced upon us.
In conclusion I especially entreat the peoole's
representatives in the congress who are
charged with the responsibility of inaugurat
ing measures for the safety and prosperity of
our common country tj promptly and effect
ively consider the Ills of cur critical financial
plight I have suggested a remedy which my
judgment approves. I desire, however, to as
sure the congress that I am prepared to co
operate with them fn perfecting any other
measure promising thorough and practical re
lief and that I will gladly labor Trith them ii
every patriotic endeavor to further the interests
and guard the welfare of our countrymon,
whom in our respective places of duty wi
have undertaken to serve. ,
