Washington. The sixty-first con
gress assembled Monday for its final
session. Almost immediately after
convening both houses followed the
custom of adjourning for one day out
of respect to the memory of those
members who have died during the
summer recess. Five senators and
three representatives have died since
the beginning of summer, upon re
assembling Tuesday tne two houses
listened to the reading of the presi
dent's annual message.
The message was unusually long,
running from 30,000 to 40,000 word3.
In a general way the president urged
upon congress the necessity for enact
ing legislation to build up the Ameri
can merchant marine, to conserve the
natural resources of the country, to
provide a new form of government
for Alaska, to "supplement and
strengthen" the Sherman anti-trust
law, to enlarge the scope of the civil
service law, to create a national bu
reau of health, to provide a legislative
basis for workingmen's compensation
lor the limitation of injunctions is-
of organl zatlon and committee
changes n -quired little time. The
opinion is -.gaining ground that little
else than tl le passage of the various
appropriation bills will be attempted.
Statement by leaders of various
parties andl factions indicate that the
short eess.!cn will do little else than
pass the regular appropriation bills.
The regukir Republicans declare:
"Well, we will get the rout'ne out of
the way." The routine being the nu
merous appropriation bills.
The Democrats say: "Well, let's
see what the Republicans will do.
Our turn comes next year."
The inKurgents say: "We are here
to fight for progressive legislation, if
we can get the chance."
Bills to Clean Up.
The big thing staring the legisla
tors in the face is- cleaning up the ap
propriation bills, of which there are !
12. President Taft has been calling !
on the department heads for economy j
and he is expected to continue the 1
process with the legislators. Until ;
these bills are cleaned up it is pretty '
certain that nothing in the way of '.
general legislation will be attempted,

definite has jet been learned of the

there has been no loss of life.
Membirs of the peace commission
returning to Chihuahua reported that
their work was greatly embarrassed
by the fact that soldiers followed at
their heels. At Guerrero, just as they
were beginning to talk with the in
surrectos, a peon arrived with word
that the soldiers were on the way,
whereupon -the meeting promptly
came to an end.
Main Grievance Against State.
At Guerrero, and also at San Anto
nio, the commissioners were told that
the main grievance is against the
state government rather thah against
Dial.
Seemingly authentic reports state
that Guerrero has been taken by the,
revolutionists with some loss of life.
Details are lacking. It Is reported
that General Plata, commanding this
military zone, is to be succeeded by
General Juan Hernandez immediately.
It is learned that the peace com
mission which left Chihuahua to treat
with the insurrectos was acting un
der the authority of Governor San
chez, and not President Dlas.

PRESIDENT TAFT .
SEEKS HARMONY
Washington. In what was said to
be an initial effort to bring about
semblance of harmony in the divided
Republican forces of the United
States senate, President Taft Invited
several regular and progressive lead
ers to the White House.
In Insurgent circles it was said the
preliminary conference with the
president had given no definite prom
ise of success. The president was
reported as conciliatory end Is said
to have declared he was anxious to
do all In his power to bring about
unity of aetion in the party.
At the White House It was not ad
mitted that President Taft was not
making a special effort to bring the
insurgents or progressives Into line.
It was declared with a great deal of
emphasis that Messrs. Cummins, Bo
rah and Brl&tow had been invited to
call only as a part of the president's
plan to consult as many as possible
f the senators and congressmen re
garding recommendations In his mes
sage and the legislation program.
NO BATTLESHIP FLEET
Coast Will Not Be Protected Until
Canal Opens.
Washington. The Paciflo Coast will
not get a battleship fleet until the
Panama Canal is completed, accord
ing to the annual report of the Sec
retary of the Navy. This is a reiter
ation of statements made by Secre
tary Meyer on his recent tour of the
Coast'
An equally important feature of the
Secretay's report is hi free and frank
criticism of the two navy-yards on the
Pacific Coast, both of which. In bis
Judgment, were poor'y located, the
Puget Sound yard because of Its dis
tance from any large city, and the
Mare Island navy yard because of
shallow water, rendering It valueless
in the repair of battleships and heavy
cruioers, and also because of its re
moteness from an Francisco.

SECRETARY BALLINGER
MAY BE IMPEACHED
Washington. A resolution for ths
Impeachment of Secretary Balllnger
has been proposed and , may bs
Introduced In the bouse at any time
Its Introduction is timely. If the min
ority report, censuring Balllnger, Is
adopted by the house, the Impeach
ment resolution will follow almost
immediately, perhaps at the same
time the minority report is adopted.
The probability that the house will
follow that course by a combination
between insurgents and Democrats
worries the administration very much.
If the house should Impeach, the sen
ate must, under the constitution, sit
as Judge on the housa charges.
Only a change In the present situa
tion can prevent the house from
adopting ths report censuring Ballln
ger, and it is argued that then the
house must go on to impeachment or
be ipconslsUinL ' ' -
