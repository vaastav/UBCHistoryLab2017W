in the gallery.
For once social standing was put
aside in order that those of all wa-ks
of life might hear an able speaker on
this subject.
On the stage were many of the fore
most business men of Walla Walla. In
front of them sat Former Senator An
keny and Mayor Rose, both in even
ing dress.
Senator Ankeny introduced Mayor
Rose in a few well chosen words. As
Senator Anken> stepped to the front
Of the stage he was met with deaf

suspicious "dry" called forth, "Who

Regardless of the denial that is being made by the East Oregonian and instigated
by the "Drys" of Walla Walla, we repeat that conditions in Pendleton are exactly as
described by our correspondent. He investigated and we published facts. In substan
tiation we publish the following telegram, signed by two prominent citizens of the
Oregon city.

zen of Pendleton" is not a resident of that place but resides at Chehalis, Washington.
He made the statement himself in the lobby of the Dacres Hotel, Thursday night. He
surely knows where he lives if he does not have any knowledge of the conditions in
Pendleton. WHO LIED ABOUT PENDLETON?
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE "IDLE HOUR?"
State Senator David H. Cox, while a member of the City Council, voted for the
enactment of ordinance which gave protection to the "Idle Hour" and other places
of prostitution. He is well versed in the mode of procedure to blot them out. He and
his followers are posing as "reformers" for the good of Walla Walla. They must take
the responsibility for the houses of prostitution, for they helped to make them, and
a ill not avail themselves of the :aws provision to stamp them out.
In telling of the educational center,
and center for homes, his city was and
afso d c ait with those of his state who
are now engaged helping develop the
state oi Vasoinston.
A Wonderful State.
"If I were asked to name your state
I would term it the state of 'wond rful
opportunity.' We have no breeding
p aces for crime or disease in our city
and you prohibitionists who state dif
ferent of our city either talk through
ignorance or malice and hatred m
your heart. You talk of that form
of dillema that pleased you mo?t. The
per cent of criminality is smaller in
our city than any city in the United
States according to the United States
census department. The proportion
of arrests for drunkenness is smaller
i n our city than any "dry" town in
the country." Here the speaker paid
a glowing tribute to the Salvation Ar
my:
"Here is something for you prohibi
tionists. P t it down on vaper. Sleep
on it tonight—prohibition does not pro
hibit. The working man in our city
frets a drink whenever he wants it.
The working man in a "dry" town
wants a drink as often as do those in
our city, but they must resort to de
ceit to get it. Yes they \>y it by
the bottle and then do not stop until
it is done. Our prohibition friends
do not know this—no they are not in
touch with the conditions —the minis
ter stands on the outside of the sa
loon and guesses."
To the Unsigned Writer.
"I find a catechism in one of your
evening papers for me to answer. If
there is one man I utterly it
is that detestable cur who wi 1 write

name to it. You prohibitionist who
wrote that list of questions—if you

More Important Than Slavery.
"I will dismiss this itt'e matter by
saying: If our prohihtion friends will
lie about one thing they will lie about
another. I regard the liquor question
as more of importance than the ques
tion of slavery. That ouestion in
volved the freedom of 5.000.000 black
men. This question involves the
question of freedom of 80.000.000 white
men. I am opposed to prohibtion be
cause of its utter failure where tried,
[t insnires hypocrisy in the individual
and the man in public office, it con
fiscates private property acquired un
der sanction of law; it is injurious to
the public and a privation to the na
tion: it provides and makes pitfa ls
for the youth of our nation and cuts
lown the public revenue of not only
the nation but state and municipality
without promoting the public welfare;

Temperance and Prohibition.

THE EVENING STATESMAN. WALLA WALLA WASHINGTON.
11 am in favor of temperance, for that
is why I fight prohibitoin. I believe
the average business man of this
country contemptible cowards —why—
because they work under false pre
tenses for fear of losing the sale of
a shirt or paper co lar. The man
who has not the courage of his con
victions has no standing in the citi
zenship of this nation."
Here the speaker to d a story of a
lover not having enough nerve to
propose to the girl he 'oved. As they
were lying on the sandy beach one
day the girl asked the young man
to kiss her. The young man replied
that he could not as his mouth was"
full of sand. To this the young lady
replied, "Swallow it, for you certainly
need ft." "I say to you, if you need
it, for God's sake swallow the mouth!
full of sand. Many view with* a'arm
fhis wave of hypocrisy that is now
sweeping across this country. They
wou'd make you believe that prohibi
tion is temperance, and you are going
to accept it as a substitute. I give
;my endorsement to the W. C. T. U.
| and Catho'ic total absteinanee com
mittee and other such temperance or
ganiaztions. Their cause is the only
f solution to the proposition. When we
treat it as a moral issue, appeal to
the moral sense, then we will win,
but not until then. The fight will
never be won by the blugeon of force,
for the time has never been that we
couM, pnd never will be when the
United Sates can be governed by
radicalism.
Personal Liberty.
"Personal liberty—cannot we take
a drink when we want it —is any one
going to dictate to us what we are to
wear or eat, or how we are going to
worship the Divine Being? To what
end will all this result? Philosophers'
have said the downfall of this coun-i
try would be when the liberty of its'
citizens wa# gone. " Here again the
speaker cited many figures to sub
stantiate his argument.
Mayor Rose then delivered a body
blow at patent medicines and said
the Peruna company gave $50,000 an
nuaUy into the treasury of the Anti-
Sa'oon league, which he said was
made up of rampant prohibtlonists
and others cast off from other po
litical parties. He said the Anti-Sa
loon league worked hand in hand with*
patent medicine people and that the
prohibtionists were so near the Anti-
Saloon league that they helped spend
the blood -money attained by the
Anti-Saloon league.
Turkey and China.
Turkey and China are prohibition
countries and look at them, both dis
graces to the world—opium—the drug
habit has come to replace tlie beer.
The legislature of Alabama gave offi
cers the authority to break into the
nrivacv of y ur homes, stop and go
through people clothes and inflict
humilations on the women, if they
thought intoxicating liquors were to
be found. Prohibitionists listen— the
day wil' never come as God is my
judge, when you or yours or your kind
can ever infringe to that extent on
the fundamental principles of our con- |
stitution. If the clay ever comes that i
my house is invaded by officers they |
will carry him out or, so help me God
carry me out. When that climax is
reached it is the beginning of the end.
The first time the people of Alabama
had an opportunity to voice them
selves on prohibition they defeated the
measure by 20,000 votes. Are we to
profit by the experience of others or
emn'oy experience as our teacher.
"Prohibitionists are co-partners of
the boot-legger. The boy! How much
hovo wo fionrrt of tVip Vtov T)o TV>t
house him up. support him with props
and the like for someday a separation
must be and then he will fall. Learn
him to meet temptation with the spir
it of a man and overcome them as he
comes to them. Do not say to him do
not do it, but use pursuasion and then
fpe »v a eti* tie i s of
mother for a forgiving kiss, because
the lad feels sorry for his resentful
attitude when told he must not. That
.is human nature and there is only one
power that can change it and that is
not prohibition."
On the Other Hand.
Here the speaker changed his at
titude and asked the prohibitions if
they were pround that so many less
1 ons of beer were sod last year
than the year before. "That is your
w rk. are you proud of it." "Yes, Yes"
from several parts of the house.
"Well there were 24,000,000 gallons
more whisky made last year, are you
proud of that also"?
"When my boy was of the proper
age I showed him the temptations of
this life, like a man rather than let
sjome other sho*w them t° him, who
may have some other desire in his
heart. I never heard of Pendleton un
til I came here, but if the newspapers
are to be believed there are more liars
to the square inch in that city than
any ether place in the world. Those
who live off the bitterness and strife of
others had better go out and earn him
self an honorable liveMhood somehow.
In closing Mayor R se paid a beau
tiful tribute to Abraham Lincoln quot
'usr h's famous expression: "You can
fool part of the people part of the time
and all the peop'e s me of the time but
you can't fool all the people all of the
time."'

SAYS MESSAGE OF TAFT IS
DISAPPOINTING THROUGHOUT
LaFollette Charges That President
Seeks to Side Step All Im
portant Issues.
MADISON, Wis., Dec. 17.—(Spec
ial.) —That President Taft's message
to congress is "disappointing," that
Rooseve t policies are sidestepped and
that the tardiness of the executive
in presenting issues of vital import
ance leaves 'congress and the public
to infer, as they we'l may, after the
experience of the special session, that
he is waiting the program of Aldrich

by Senator LaFolette today.
For the first time since the election
of President Taft. Senator LaFo'lette
has determined to 'et the public know
what he thinks of the Taft adminis
tration. In no uncertain terms he
announces his views and the whole
tenor of the article would indicate
that President Taft has forsaken the
"Roosevelt policies."

speech of acceptance last March, and
his many promises. Senator LaFol
lette turns to a discussion of the tar
iff session and declares that the
"public condemns the legislation."
"On Tuesday. December 7, Presi
dent Taft's message on general legis
"''on was presented to congress and
the country," says Senator LaFol'ette.
"It is a document of 40 pages. The
message is silent, where it should
have spoken strongly.
"The man so often quoted in Mr.
Taft's speech of acceptance and in
addresses durintr the campaign is
twice referred to in this message,
as 'my predecessor' who directed
ittention to the 'outrageous condi

ivhere President Taft says that fol
ovving the course ol\'my distinguished

:o congress the consideration and
passage of a ship subsidy bill.'
"We regret to say that the message i
