The Newspaper that
Tells What It Knows
UNITED PRESS ASSOCIATION SERVICE
ROOSEVELT ROARS
Consigns Newspaper to Liars' Limbo and
Wants Government to Prosecute It.
* . WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.—Asking the government
to prosecute Joseph Pulitzer and the publishers of the
New York World for libel upon the good name of the
United States in connection with the charges of fraud in
the purchase of the Panama canal, Roosevelt today sent a
'igorously worded special message to congress. He also
transmitted all the records and papers concerning the
deal.
The message says:
"In view of the constant reiteration and association
of corrupt action with the government in the acquisition
of the canal, I deem it wise to submit to congress all the
information I have. The stories were first brought to my
attention as published in the Indianapolis News. The
stories are scurrilous, libelous and false."
The message continues:
"Delavan Smith, publisher of the
Indianapolis News, shelters him
self behind the excuse that he ac
cepted the statements of the
World. The real offender is Pullt
ser. The great Injury is in the
blackening of the good name of
the American people. It should
not be left for a private citizen to
sue Pulitzer, but he should be
prosecuted for libel by the govern
ment.
It is idle to say that the known
character of Pulitzer and his pa
per Is such that the statements in
the paper should be believed by
nobody, but unfortunately there
are thousands who believe state
ments they see printed, even
though they appear in Pulitzer's
paper. Congressmen are actually
Induced to Introduce resolutions
with reference to these charges."
The president then quoted tho
specific charges as published,
bringing In the names of Charles
Taft, brother of the president
elect, and Douglas Robinson,
MERRITT FILES CHARGES
AGAINST JACK O'BRIEN
Say* City Commissioner Is
Playing Politics to Hold
His Job.
Definite ehargeß Involving City
Commissioner O'Brien in political
manipulation of city crematory
management are filed today by A.
W. Merritt, superintendent, whom
Mayor Moore is trying to depose.
Here is what Merritt tells the
mayor and finance committee in
his written statement:
Merrltt's statement follows:
"Learning, unofficially, that your
honorable body has been appointed
to investigate the crematory de
partment, I beg to submit the fol
lowing, so that you may, it possi
ble, in your recommendation, recti
fy the mistakes made In the early
stages of the department and make
it possible for whoever is responsi
ble for the success of the depart
ment to make good. As it 1b now,
it seems to be a question just who
Is responsible for the success or
nonsuccess of the department.
"If the board of public works is
responsible they should have the
power to appoint and discharge the
superintendent and all other em
ployes.
"If, the superintendent is re
sponsible he should have the
power to select and discharge all
employes.
"Some one man must be the
Judge of the competency or incom
petency of all men employed in the
department, and if in his opinion
any employe is not working for the
Interest of the department it
should be his duty to dlschurge
him, regardless of who his friend
Is.
"Referring particularly to the
appointment of the present assist
ant superintendent will say that
nominally the assistant superinten
dent Is appointed by the superin
tendent with the consent of the
Q»ayor and board of public works.
Mr. Lockhart was never my choice,
and in justice to the mayor, not
his. After I had repeatedly refused
to appoint Mr. Lockhart assistant
superintendent, giving my reasons
that he had told me personally that
he and others associated with him
were going to put the department
out of business inside of a year,
Mr. O'Brien came to me, seeming
ly very much Interested In the suc
cess of the department, aud asked
brother in law of the president.
The message continued:
"These statements sometimes
occurred in the editorial columns
and sometimes in the news col
umns. They are false in every
particular from beginning to end.
The wickedness of the slanders
are surpassed only by their fatuity.
The inventor of the Taft story evi
dently supposed that Taft was sec
retary of war during some period
of the Panama purchase. He did
not become secretary until after
the transaction was closed. The
stories consist of strong, infamous
libels. In form, they are in part
libels on individuals, Robinson and
Taft, for Instance; in fact, they
are libels upon the government.
It Is a high national duty to
bring Pulitzer, who only seeks to
connect government with wrong
doings of the basest, to justice.
The attorney general is consider
ing the form of prosecution."
The remainder of the message
is devoted to a description of the
method of the purchase of the
canal.
me to appoint Mr. as as
sistant superintendent as a person
al favor to him, as he must have
the support of Mr. Lockhart's
friend in council to retain his po
litical situation. He further stated
that if Mr. l.ockhart did not prove
satisfactory he would see that he
was removed any time that I said
the word. I have said the word
several times, giving each time a
new cause, any of which should
have been sufficient, but was al
ways told that we could not let him
go because we must have the sup
port of Mr. lxickhart's council

"The first six months of the op
eration of tills department I was
not only left nlone as to its man
agement but had considerable
trouble in securing the necessary
supplies and the department seem
ed to be considered a joke by cer
tain officials. Immediately upon
the filing of the report which show
ed a profit much interest was
shown by these same officials and
the old garbage men who were
bought out by the city. At this time
I was called into Mr. O'Brien's of
fice and requested to consult with
him every morning with regard to
the details of the department. He
seemed to be very much pleased
with the showing, always assured
me that he was with me and al
ways sorry that conditions were

LABORING IN WANT
CHANGE TO IRK AND
PAY FOR WHAT THEY GET
The meeting at All Saints par
ish house last night for the pur
pose of devising ways and means
of taking care of the unemployed
developed a mass of opinion and
strong utterance, but no practical
method of handling the question
was discovered. A resolution was
passed asking the city" council to
encourage all public improvement
work possible, and a committee
appointed to interest other civic
clubs in the problem.
The attitude of the men inter
ested on the workingmen's side of
the proposition was distinctly In
opposition to any charity relief
measures. What they wanted was
work and respectable wages under
self respecting conditions. The idle
transients willing to work for food
and bed, of which the city has
been represented to be filled, were
not represented, although the In
dustrial Workers' speakers who
were present strongly befriended
the cause of the "tramp," meaning
the man who is traveling about
from place to place, homeless and
in search of work.
There was no chance for misun
derstanding as to the terms on
which work was wanted. They de
manded it at the rate of union pay
and union hours. Thomas Maloney
Cited the city authorities to means
by which the greater part of resi
dent labor could be taken care of
—the plan of day labor on public
work and preference in employ
ment to men with homes and fami
lies. This Is the solution that ap
pears to command least attention
at the city hall. Mr. Maloney said:
"If day labor were In vogue to
day it would take care of 75 per
cent of the unemployed. The
building of the new four mile
water main should be by day labor
at decent wages. The work could
be apportioned according to a
man's needs. We want no soup
house proposition. It would only
attract people who do not care to
labor, but only eke out an exist
ence. The city council has power
to appropriate money for any pur
pose. This new water main could
be built at a profit to he city."
It was the first demonstration
of the kind ever seen In Spokane.

B. J. Tamblin, socialist, suggest
ed that idle men be set to work
building a tenement house on the
site of the city yards. "This has
bees' a benefit wherever tried." he
said, "You can finance national
apple shows and dine James J.
Hill and other magnates. Why not
finance something for the working
man?"
Mayor Moore suggested housing
men. in Billy Sunday's tabernacle.
A fire could be kept there and the
men allowed to sleep on a sawdust
bed. The place would hold 2,000
men.
'Vln regard to the soup kitchen

he stated,. "People say It atttracts
a lot of men who would impose
upon the condition. It would be
well not to have it free, but make a
small charge. It has been suggest

improvements. There is not much
to hope for from that direction, as
It Is difficult to get land for parks
and the board is not doing much
improving."

"The cause of this is quite

$75,000 FOR
LEG AND ARM
DISMEMBERED LINEMAN
BORNE INTO COURT TO
PRESS CLAIM FOR TERRIBLE
INJURIES AGAINST ELECTRIC
LINE.
Walter E. Shore, electric line
man, with his left leg and left arm
gone, was borne into Judge Hun
eke's court room this morning,
supported by two of his friends, to
testify in an action for $75,000
damages instituted by him against
the Spokane & Inland, called for
trial this morning before a jury.
Shore was employed in placing the
overhead electric work at Black
well's switch, near Colfax, in Octo
ber, 1907, when the slacking up of
a wire which he held threw him
against one of the high tension
wires, causing a current of over
6000 volts to pass through the left
side of his body.
The amputation of Shore's left
arm and left leg became necessary
and he has been under a doctor's
care, unable to do anything, ever
since.
The Inland company contends
that the blame for Shore's misfor
tune rests with himself and his
fellow employes and denies legal
liability.
S. R. Stern is appearing for the
plaintiff, and Graves, Kizer &

Incendiary Attempts at Hillyard FoDowed by
Dangerous Fires Here.
Firebugs were evidently at
work in the city yesterday after
noon, and only the fact that the
day was quiet and little wind was
blowing, prevented disastrous con
flagrations.
The first call came to the fire
department at 4:05, when two
small barns in rear of 222 Main
avenue, occupied by Connors'
Bros., mysteriously caught fire.
The department met with no diffi

large wooden structure caught fire

LEGISLATORS PROBING
HUTCHINSON'S CHARGES
Will Inspect |New Asylum
Building Said to
Be Unfit.
Charges made by Senator R. A.
Hutchinson, who said that the new
$65,000 building at the Medical
Lake insane asylum is unfit for
use and unoccupied though erected
more than two years ago, are being
investigated today by several rep
resentatives of eastern Washing
ton in the legislature who went to
the lake town at noon. Lieutenant
Governor-elect Hay, Representa
tives Edge aud Rancher of this city
are with the party.
Senator Hutchinson made his
charges at the recent meeting of
legislators in this city. He said
he was advised that the board of
control would ask an additional ap
propriation of $65,000 to construct
a building to be used in place of
the unoccupied one. He has re
quested that the legislators on
their trip to "ascertain what graft
or other cause is responsible."
The fault in the structure is said
to lie in the fact that it is located
upon low ground and is constantly
damp by reason of the drainage
from the higher ground surround
ing it.
MAY COTTRELL
ON TRIAL
ACCUSED OF FORGING CHECKS
IN THE NAME OF COLONEL
JENKINS, WELL KNOWN
CAPITALIST OF SPOKANE.
Mrs. May Cottrell was placed on
trial before a jury in Judge Hin
kle's court today, charged with
forging Colonel D. P. Jenkins'
name to a check on the Traders
National bank for $52, bearing
date of May 9, 1908. made payable
to Ora Gilmer, which was cashed
at the Blakeley store.
Mrs. Cottrell, well dressed and
seemingly little concerned about
the charge against her, was ar
raigued and entered a plea of not
guilty.
At the hour of the noon adjourn

sworn, consisting of W. R. Elston,

that institution. All candidates
