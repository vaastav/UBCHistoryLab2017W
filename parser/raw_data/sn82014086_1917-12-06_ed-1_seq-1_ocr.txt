While for tb"! moment there are 1:0

; Already the Germans in the Cam

inforcements with the object of blot
ting out the salient, driven into their
line "by General Byng's intrepid dash,
a small portion of which they have re
conquered, but at a fearful price. In
Italy, along the Sctte Comuni and i.he
Asiago plateau, enemy guns of all
calibres have opened fire on the
Italian positions and several hill posi

tacks. Both before Cambrai and in
the Italian region the allied armies

While near- Cambrai it is concede!
that the British will be forced, by rea

a good accounting for any attacks the
enemy may launch.
Likewise, the menace of a dash by
the Austro-Germans down through the
hills and out upon the plains of. Venetia
has been provided for, so far as the
reinforcement of the Italians -by the
British and French troops and the
bringing up of fresh guns is concern
ed. If Field Marshal Von Hoetzendorf,
commander of the enemy troops,
should be able to breach the line and
gain his objective, it will be only after
one of the most sanguinary encoun
ters of the war.
In Mesopotamia the British and
Russian troops have carried out a
successful operation against the
Turks, but just where has not been
stated. This has significance inasmuch
as it is the first report of the fighting
of the Russians with the British m
this region since they formed a con
junction after the British captured
Bagdad.
Although a British official an
nouncement characterizes as- a
"shameful statement" thereports from
Berlin and Vienna that Rumania has
proposed to enter into negotiations
for an armistics with the Teutonic
allies, both Berlin and Vienna reiter
ate that negotiations are in progress,.

EXCITING EPISODE ON ,
THE CAMBRAI FRONT
When American and Canadian Engi
neers Were Rescued From Germans.
With the British Army in France,
Tuesday, Dec. 4. (By the Associated
Press). The best of many exciting
episodes related in connection with
the Cambrai fighting front was that
involving fifty American and Cana
dian engineers, together with some
British fighting troops. These men
were cut oft" in the German turning
movement near Gouzeaucoui t and were
taken prisoner. A German escort of
twenty soldiers cr more started with
them along the road leading from
Gouzeaucourt to Cambrai. As they
were proceeding disconsolately to
wards the zone of the German prison
cages they came upon a small body
of British troops who had also been
cut . oft from.- their .comrades, and were
wandering about.' ' ''.' ! " 1

tried to drive , their captives off to

hurled themselves upon tlieir guards
and struggled barehanded until the
Tommies " arrived and' disposed of the
Germans. The engineers and their
comrades took the German rifles, ar.d
worked their way back with their res
cuers until they were able to reach a

AMERICAN TORPEDO BOAT
-DESTROYED A U-BOAT
Crew of Belgian Vessel Tells of Fight
Which Apparently Was Reported Be-
fore. ', . . '. -.'
An Atlantic Port, December 5. How
an American torpedo-boat destroyer
dealt successfully with a German sub
marine oft the Irish coast on Novem
ber l'7 was told by the crew of a Bel
gian freight steamship, which arrived
here today. Presumably, the incident
is the same one reported in an , Asso

vessels. Forty-five minutes after they
left an Irish port a U-boat appeared
unexpectedly. An American destroyer
dashed straight toward it, and . the
submarine dived. As it passed over
the spot where the U-boat" had gone
down, the destroyer dropped ti depth
bomb. Apparently the explosive was
effective, as the U-boat presently came)
to, the surface and the -crew came out
on deck and raised their arms in sur
render. When the Belgian ship and the
other convoying vessels continued ' on
their voyage they left the destroyer
alongside of the U-boat, apparently
taking the Germans aboard.
TRADE BLACKLIST IS ' ;
4 CREATING A STlR
It- is Said to Duplicate Part of the
British Bill. '
New York, Dec. " .5 Publication of
the first American trade blacklist, that
for South America, containing approx
imately 1,700 names of firms and cor
porations suspected of having Ger
man ; connections or sympathies, cre
ated a stir today among New York
merchants. In some' well, informed
quarters it came as no surprise, but
in other places it had a disturbing
effect. Six months ago, it , is known.
President Wilson ;.and , Secretary Lan
sing declared that the United States
would never have a blacklist. It' is
therefore regarded today as intensely
significant, and as showing the in
finite complexities of the war. that
the United States government., like
Great Britain, has ' been ' forced to
adopt under , the terms of the trading
with -he-enemy act measures for the
convenience and protection of business
and military interests of this country.
The South . American blacklist, by
more than 50 per cent., duplicates the
names of Latin-American firms given
in the British blacklist. The entire
British list, for all countries, now in
cludes 6,000 or more names.

National Unification
of the Railroads
RECOMMENDED BY INTERSTATE
COMMERCE COMMISSION.
IN REPORT TO CONGRESS
Either by Government Operation or
by Suspension for the War of Anti
Trust and Anti-Pooling laws Im
mediate Action is Advocated.
Washington, Dec. 5. Immediate ac
tion to effect national unification cf
the railroads, either by government
operation or by suspension for the
war of anti-trust and anti-pooling
laws, a federal loan and regulation of
security issues to permit more effective
voluntary co-operation, was recom
mended today by the interstate com
merce commission in a special report
to congress.
Separate Report to Be Submitted.
Neither plan was specifically en
dorsed, but an implication that the
majority believed the railroads migut
successfully work out their own uni
fication prompted Commissioner Mu-
Chord to submit a separate report em
phatically urging government control
and saying "the strong arm of govern
ment authority is essential if the
transportation situation is to be radi
cally improved." Any voluntary pocl-
ing plan would fail, to meet war exi
gencies, he declared, because of the
unavoidable influence of selfishness'
among roads. '
There was no disagreement as to the
proposition that competition among
railroads must be diminished, if not
altogether eliminated, to prevent a se
rious breakdown of transportation fa
cilities under the war's strain.
Increase in Rates Inadequate.
The railroads' own proposed solu
tion for the difficulties an increa:se in
rates in order to attract capital was
characterize! as entirely inadequate
by the commission. Even with more
funds, the report said, the shortage of
equipment could not be remedied ma
terially because of the inability of in
dustries to manufacture it. Doubt
also was expressed whether sufficient
capital would 'be attracted in view of
the notation of such enormous quanti
ties of government war securities.
No Duplication of Routes.
These considerations led the com
mission to what it considered an in
evitable conclusion that a high state
of efficiency could be maintained for
the railroads only by thorough co
operation, elimination of duplication
of routes and other elements of ex
pense and energy, and elimination of
ine economic waste which comes frttn
competition. This would "" meain, it
,iuwintdttiP.eineM;, recon
struct ion of the policies under which
; - ' Government Loan.
-A. big government loan to railroads
nas been discussed among high olfi
cials for some time and President. Wil
son is known to have given considera
tion to such suggestions even before
President Rea of the Pennsylvania
railroad advocated the plan on the
witness stand before the interstate
commerce commission in the 1 5 per
ceni. rate nearmg several weeks at$o.
" Authority to Operate.
Authority to operate railroads was
given, the president in the following
section or tne military appropriation
act last year:
.. "The president, in' time of war, is
empowered, through the secretary of
war, to take possession and assume
control of any system or systems of
transportation, or any, part thereof,
and to utilize the same, to the exclu
sion as far as may be necessary, cf
all other traffic thereon, for the trans
fer or transportation of troops, ws
material and equipment, or' for such
other purposes connected with t he
emergency as may' be needful or de
sirable."

To Pool all Coal
Carrying Cars
GENERAL OPERATING COIMIT
TEE OI EASTERN ROADS.
GO IN EFFECT AT ONCE
Idea is That an Enormous Amount oi
ShKting Can be Eliminated by the
Pooling of Cars and Using Them
Iatercfaangeabl y.
Pittsburgh, Pa., Dec. 5. The gen
eral operating committee of the east
ern railroads today decided to ' pool,
effectively immediately, all coal car
rying cars upon the roads it repre
sents, and formally asked the special
committee on national defense of the
American Railway association that
immediate authority "be secured
from the proper government repre
sentative to pool the coal car equip
ment of private owners at home on
the lines of the railroads represent
ed by this committee and establish a
rate of compensation therefor."
What Aofion is Based On.
The action of the committee was
based on the fact that about 80 per
cent, of the coal mined in the coun
try originates on roads represented by
the committee, and that an enormous
amount of shifting can be eliminated
by pooling cars and using them inter
changeably. The new organization is to be known
as the Eastern Railroads Coal Car
Pool with headquarters in Pittsburgh.
FIXING OF NEW PRICE
LAWS IS EXPECTED
Because of President Wilson's Attack
on Profiteers.
Washington, Dec. 5. Early enact
ment of legislation extending the gov
ernment's price-fixing power is ex
pected by administration officials to
follow President Wilson's declaration
in his message to congress yesterday
that authority in this respect is now
too limited.
Under Jaws passed at the last ses
sion of congress, the government al
ready has fixed the prices of coal and
wheat and is controlling indirectly the
pi-ices of many foodstuffs. An ad
ministration measure giving it power
to fix the prices of steel and iron and
many other basic materials failed of
passage. Steel, iron and copper prices,
however, were fixed in a voluntary
figreement made by the war industries
board with producers. This agree-,
ment does not go far enough, officials
contend, since under it the govern
ment has no control over the prices of
manuractured products.
Power will be-songhtbT-congres3to
control pricas not only on all the es
sential raw products, but to limit the
price of all manufacturers and dealers
and distributors as well.
Grain growers are complaining bit
terly to the food administration that
while the government has set a price
on wheat, it has permitted the price
of cotton and many other farm pro
ducts even to run wild. Agricultural
machinery, they claim, gets higher in
price every day.
