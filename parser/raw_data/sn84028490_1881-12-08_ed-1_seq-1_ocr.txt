GUITEAU'S TRIAL.
The Masterly Cross-Questioning
of Judge Porter.
The Assassin Suffers in Porter's Hands—
The Assassin Suffers in Porter's Hands— He Tries to Explain the Divinity
of His Deed.
Washington, November 30. Judge
Porter, of the prosecution, began to
cross-question Guiteau this afternoon.
The prisoner bore the examination with
considerable self-possession, although
he occasionally got fluried and excited.
Question You determined to kill Gen
eral GarUeld, did you not?
Answer I decline to answer that.
That is a very strong way to put it (with
some excitement), i consider myself an
agent of the Deity in the matter. I had
no personal volition in the matter.
Q. Did you say to Oflicer Scott, on
leaving the depot after the murder of
the President, "General Arthur is now
President?"
A. I decline to answer that.
Q Why do you object to answering
that?
A. I suppose I did say that. (Then he
. added excitedly): I want it distinctly
understood I did not do that of my own
personal volition, but on the inspiration
of the Deity. I never would have shot
the President on my own personal ac
count. The Deity inspired the act, and
the Deity would take care of it. The
Deity furnished the money with which
I bought the pistol. I was the agent.
The Deity inspired me to remove the
President, and I had resort to my own
means to accomplish the Deity's will.
Q. The only inspiration you had was
to use a pistol on the President? .
A. The inspiration consisted in try
ing to remove the President, for the
good of the American people, and (im
patiently) all these details are nothing
to the case. The whole matter was iu
the hands of the Deity, and (impatiently)
I do not want to discuss any further. I
appreciate the fact of the President's
long sickness as much as any person in
the world; but that is a very narrow
view to take of the matter.
Q. Did you contemplate his removal
otherwise than by murder?
. A. No, sir (petulantly), I do not like
the word "murder." I do not recollect
the actual facts in that matter (ex
citedly). If I had shot the President of
the United States on my own personal
account no punishment would be too
severe nor too quick for me, but acting
as the agent of the Deity, that puts an
f entirely different construction on the
act, and that is what I want put to the
Court and jun, and to opposing counsel.
I say that the removal of the President
was an act of necessity from the situa
tion, and for the good of the American
people. That is the idea 1 want you to
entertain, and not to settle down on the
cold-blooded idea of murder, because I
never had the' first conception of mur
der iu the matter, ' ' --
Mr. Pin ter Ware you aware that it
was .against human law?
The prisoner I felt the Deity would
take ! care ' ofi' me. I never entertained
the idea or murder lh the whole matter.
I never had any conception of the mat
ter, as,, murder. My mind is perfectly
blank on that subject, and has been.
THURSDAY.
was teau
trial to-day on Recount of the storm.
Guiteau said he was always a man of
peace, and a physical coward.. ;. ,., ";
Jud?;e PorterT-"And vwy cool and de
termined sometimes?" i .
Guiteau "When the Deity Is back of
me. He iff always right, and if he in
spires a man1 to aet, it is rigWr .
Guiteau said, further that if .Mason
and Jones, who shot at him, could prove
they were inspired by duty they would
be . "Jntined. " Porter aHked : whether
Mason' and Jones should be punished
anyway, whether . he escaped. jr.. not.'
Guiteau refused to answer, and" told
Porter he had seen him frighten wit
nesses in New York, but . he could not
scare him as he would give as good as
was sent. A long series of questions,
tending to show that the previous wit
ness had testified that Guiteau was not
always p?aceable, were answered, "I
don't remember." . Judge Porter asked
in an emphatic voice if Guiteau remem
bered saying at the depot that he shot
the President, adding, "You, and not
the Deity." Guiteau answered that the
counsel need not shake his finger at him,
he would not scare. When he spoke of
of himself he associated himself with
the Deity. Guiteau was carefully ques
tioned regarding the notes he had
written to see if he would contradict his
brother and sister, but evaded all contra
dictions by saying he did not remember,
or must nave been mistaken. When
sharply questioned as to the troth of his
testimony yesterday, Guiteau replied
that anything he testified to was true.
He denied knowing what became of the
rest of the box of cartridges. Porter
passed to boarding house experience,
and Guiteau appealed to the court if he
must answer. Judge Cox replied that
he must, and Guiteau told of several in
stances where he could not pay his
board bill, and it was because he had no
money. When he came to Washington
last March he had $4; borrowed $25 from
Maynard, and several days later bought
jthe pistol to execute the Divine will in
'removing Garfield. Took the prettiest
pistol because it would look best in the
library of the State Department. Porter
asked why he practiced shooting at
saplings if the Deity waa to shoot Gar
field. Guitean replied that counsel was
foing too deep into the outward act.
he motive was the thing. Porter then
asked: "The motive waa to kill Gar
field, was it not?" Answer: "The motive
was to remove the President for the
good of the American people." Guiteau
was then led to detail his pistol
Eartice, and said he would have
een acting out of Divine will
if he had removed the President
any time between the middle of June
- and the day the shooting was done. Was
watching for a chance, and thought that
would settle all talk about the outward
act. God was responsible, and was using
him and the court, jury and counsel for
his own ends. He said he had not thought
whether he would or would not support
Blaine, but if he had got the Paris con
- sulship he would have felt under obli
gation to do so. He emphasized his
words by pounding on the rail of the
witness box and saying: "That's my
politics. You tickle me and I'll tickle
you." (Applause, which was suppress
ed.) About his letters to Garliold, he
said ho had sympathy for any President
hounded by hordes of officeseekers, and
at the time he had no idea of killing
the President, and the prosecution could
not turn those letters against him.
He was then cross-examined about
the alleged intimacy with republican
leaders. Guiteau became very much ex
cited when asked where he met Conk
ling, and said at several places, once on
the street. But when pushed for dates
he said he would not ue frightened by
counsel, and he refused to say anything
more about the Paris consulship, for if
counsel did not already understand, they
must be very dull, and the matter was
irrelevant anyway. Blaine's letter tell
ing Guiteau never to speak to him again
was read, and witness claimed all let
ters counsel read were written before
Garfield tried to disrupture the Republi
can party, and it was not fair to use
them against him now. He was never
inspired with the belief that Garfield
would be renominated. Refused to an
swer several questions, and finally broke
in with "Garfield should have stuck by
Grant and Conkling, who made him,
and cast Blaine overboard. Blaine used
him for his own purposes." Pressed
closely to say who told him Garfield's
death would unite the party, he said his
inspiration did. Human life was of lit
tle value if one was ready to go. No
doubt Garfield was happier now than
any man on earth. His Christiau char
acter was excellent, but he was in a po
sition to do the public harm, and the
Deity prompted his removal; said he had
no enmity towards Mason and Jones if
they were inspired by the Deity.
FRIDAY.
Gniteau continued that he regarded
himself as much in the employ of the
Deity as Paul or Martin Luther. The
same inspiration that carried him into
the Oneida community, moved him to
kill Garfield. Referring to the estab
lishment of a theocratic paper, Guiteau
said he failed because the time had not
?et arrived for such a journal. His idea
n founding a theocratic daily paper
was to make it the organ of the Deity
in this world. Said the ideas on the
"Truth" were his own, written four
teen vears after he left the Oneida com
munity, and had no reference to ideas
entertained by Noyes, the founder of
the community, adding: "I have got as
much brains as Noyes." Holding
Noyes's book in one hand and Guiteau!
in the other, Judge Porter continued the
examination, endeavoring to show that
Guiteau's book was not inspiration,
but a strict copy of Noyes's. Guiteau
held his book was inspired. He re
peated his book was written without
any reference to Noyes or his book. He
would have left the Oneida community
before, had he not thought it God's will
that he should remain. A letter object
ed to early in the day was here admit
ted. In effect it discussed the estab
lishment of theocratic dailies in large
cities of the world, and the good they
would the cause of Christ on earth.
Such papers would bring Christ to the
breakfast table every morning instead
of once a week, as at present. During
the reading Guiteau interrupted with
frequent explanations. The letter was
written when Guitean whs za, and
states the writer did not expect to ex
ert much iiilliieuce in that direction un
til he was 30. Several notes and letters
written by the prisoner relative to the
Oneida community, were recognized by
him. Porter resumed his examinution
on points mentioned in the letter. The
prisoner said the idea of establishing a
theocratic press was sound, but not
feasible. Noyes and a Jew others were
the only men in the community who
protected social intercourse. He (pris
oner) was a shaker; he did not believe
in devilish delusions; never had any
such- delusions; believed in a personal
devil and a personal God; believed in
temptation, and when he feels its pres
sure he has first to decide whether the
pressure comes from . the devil or from
God. - Counsel using the word "mur
derer," ... Guiteau broke out, "Judge
Porter "is using that word too
freely." Coming ,' to , , the v. ques
tion ' of insanity, ) i. Guiteau -. said
that ' as -he was 'not. an expert,
he could not say whether he was insane
or not. Referring to his seeing the
President one night with a loaded pistol,
coming from Blaine's house, the prisoner
said he did not iutend to remove him at
that time. The prisoner here broke out
in ribaldry about Blaine and his disrup
tion of the Republican party. ' Return
ing to Garfield's visit to Blaine, the
prisoner said he did not follow the Presi
dent to the White House. He had
visited the President's church several
times, and on all these occasions he had
his pistol. He bad surveyed the position
of the President's pew; did not take out
his pistol or point it at the President;
did not know of a better place to remove
a man than at his devotions. Counsel
here said: "Newspapers inspired you."
Guiteau said: "The Deity inspired me
and the newspapers continued the in
spiration; put it in that shape and you
have it." lie was not ready to remove
the President until June 18th. The
prisoner said he did not intend to remove
the President at church, Went to the
jail about the first week of June. Wanted
to see the accommodations there. Was
there only once. His motive in visiting
the jail was to look at its interior. Ex
pected to live at it after the removal of
the President. He hired a hack to go
toward the cemetery, not jail, sat in
front because of the heat and not for an
opportunity to shoot the President. At
the same time he had his pistol with
him; was an unusually early riser; may
have gone to the river on the morning
of June 18th; fired h.s pistol off when
ne wanted to tne river; sua maintained
he took the precaution to send for Gen
Sherman to receive protection, because
the crowd would think him a dis
appointed office seeker and hang him be
fore he could explain the motive which
prompted him. Mrs. Garfield's presence,
the prisoner again stated, saved the
President's life, June 18ih. The prisoner
nere took np a paper aud ret lined to an
swer questions unless something new
was asked, and Scoville said he thought
the prisoner's objections well founded.
A legal spat then took place between
Scoville and Porter. Continuing, wit
ness said when at the depot July 2d. saw
Blaine and Garfield in most intimate re
lations in the rotunda engaged in close
conversation; shot twice at President
in the back: felt remorse at the deed.
but his duty to American interests com
pelled him to do it. Porter here an
nounced the cross-examination closed.
SATURDAY.
Guiteau in that city by sight, as a young
lawyer. In April saw prisoner at Wash
ington; he said he was going to have the
Austrian mission. The witness told him
the place was an important one, and in
Blaine's line, and that he Ulaine was
known as a polititian. T'.iu prisoner re
plied that he was solid with Blaine. His
impression was that "Guiteau had an
illy-balanced mind; in common parlance,
he did not have good- commons sense."
"Never saw anything in Guiteau to in
dicate he could not distinguish between
right and wrong;" never saw anything
in the conduct of the prisoner that would
indicate he did not know the difference
between guilt or innocence; never saw
anything to indicate he would not be
responsible for a crime. The evidence
created quite a stir in the court room,
and seemed to stagger those about the
defense tnhta. The wister of the Drisoner
was particularly affected, and in tones I
distinctly caught by the reporters, said: !
"lie has perjured hluiseii; tnat is all
there is about it."
Vice President Davis testified: Didn't
belong to either party; had not heard of
the disruption of the Republican party;
didn't believe it would disband until
the democratic party died, and success
of either party would not imperil the
republic. Bailey, Corkhill's stenogra
pher, testified that he took the notes
from which the Herald interview with
Guiteau was published; was paid $500.
Guiteau interrupted that Bailey came to
him under false pretenses as a reporter,
and Bailey admitted it. Guiteau said:
"The following persons have been sub
poenaed as witnesses: President Ar
thur, Blaine, Logan, Conkling, Grant,
Piatt, Dorsey, Jones, Jewell, James Gor
don Bennett, Whitelaw Reid, Geo. Jones,
( has. A. Dana and W. II. Hurlburt, C.
Gorham, Washington Republican; and
Stetson Hutchins, Washington Post, and
files of their papers in May and June,
VV. P. Nixon of Chicago, and file of In
SUNDAY.
Medical experts who have been sum
moned to testify in the Guiteau trial
had a conference at the Ebbitt House to
day. Those called by the Government
first met and compared notes, and dis
cussed among themselves various phases
of insanity as the defense attribute to
Guiteau. Among those present was Dr.
Jamin Strong, Superintendent of the
Cleveland Hospital for the Insane, who
arrived to-day. He was summoned by
both Government and defense, and re
ceiving a second summons from Colonel
Corkhill, went into conference with the
experts for the Government. Among
experts for the deferise, it is undoubt
edly true that Judge Porter's cross-examination
has tended to modify their
previous opinions. Guiteau's manner
on the witness stand, as well as his
ready comprehension and answers to
the questions propounded to him, have
had the effect of unsettling their pre
vious convictions.
MONDAY.
Guiteau m.ide a speech saying he
wanted the insanity experts to under
stand he claimed to have been impelled
by a power he could not control to do a
certain act and the question was
whether that was insanity. James B.
Kiernyn, insanity expert, said he had
studied mental diseases as a specialty
nincc 13T4. Ho sniri if it was truo tliut
the prisoner's habits were really as de
scribed, if insanity prevailed in his
family, if many persons had declared
him insane, and if it was true he had
been dominated by an idea of inspira
tion he would regard the prisoner in
sane. Ou cross-examination Kiernyn
believed a man's mind could be diseased
and his moral nature not; that he did
not believe in a state of future rewards
and punishment; that all the acts of the
prisoner proved insanity; that a mm
who believed he was commanded by
God would act the same as any other
man. Guiteau cried out : "God inter
jects an idea into me and I wo: k it out
my own way. God always get-t the best
brains to do his work, not fools."

conduct unparal

case at several times, besides denounc
ing his associates and brother-in-law.
Guiteau ordered subpoenoas for the fol
lowing named witnesses : U. S. Grant,
Koscoe (jonming, Thomas u. riatt, vv.
H. Robertson, Marshall Jewell, S. W.
Dorsey, Whitelaw Reid, James Gordon
Bennett, William Henry Hulburt, Chas.
A. Dana, George Jones, William Peun
Nixon and Hugh Hastings. He took en
tire charge of the redirect examination
of George C. Gorham, asking that gen
tleman whether he had not in his
newspaper denounced Garfield last sum
mer and predicted the disruption of the
Republican party as a consequence of
his acts, and obtaining with the help of
the Coart an evasive answer to the
effect that the files of the newspapers
would speak for themselves.
WEDNESDAY.
As soon as Judge Cox took his seat,
Guiteau became excited and said: I
am not satisfied with the political situ
ation, as developed in this case. The
President of the United States would
never have been shot if it had not been
for the political situation 1 ask your
honor to subpoena Grant, Conkling and
Piatt. They were so down on Garfield
last spring that they would not speak to
him. I desire to say I will make the
closing speech for the defense after
Scoville has had his say. Scoville says
he has submitted six written questions
to President Arthur, but has received
no answer up to the present time. I
don't want President Arthur dragged
into this case in this way. I think a
great deal of President Arthur. I made
him President, and he knows it.
Drs. Snitzka, of New York, and Netti
grode, of Chicago, were ealled, but
did not answer, and Scoville re
quested attachments for them.
Here rested the defense In
rebuttal. General Sherman was the
first witness. He identified a letter
that Guiteau sent him at the time of
his arrest. A.T.Green. Freenort. Ill-
testified: Knew prisoner's father for
years; always regarded him as a sane
person. Gardner W. Canda, D. Buckley,
Smith Dakins and others, of Freeport,

Its h rvebts have been plenteous; its
varied industries have thriven; the
health of us people has been preserved ;

our destiny in His hands ihe tribute ot
onr grate! ul devotion. To that myste
rious t-xeicise ot His will which has
taken from us the loved aud illustrious
iltizen who was but lately the head ot
lie nation we bow in sorrow and sub
mision. The noem.iry of his exalted
character, ot his noble achievements,
and of his patriotic life will be treas
uied forever as a sacred possession of
the whole people, the announcement
of bis death drew from foreign govern
ments and people tributes of sympathy
and Borrow, which history will record
as signal tokens of the kinship of nu
aoiis and the federations of mankind.
OUR RELATIONS WITH ENGLAND.
The leeliug of good will between our
own Government and mat of Gieai
Biiutiu waa never more marked than
ui present. In recognition of this pleas

The surrender ot anting liuli and his
forces upon the Canauian frontier has
allayed apprehension, alibi ugh bodies
of Hiilisii Indians still cross the border
in quest of sustenance. Upon this sub
ject a correspondence has been opened
which promises au auequte under
standing. Our troops have orders to
avoid, meanwhile, all collisions with
alien Indians.
OTHER FOREIGN RELATIONS.
The presence at the Yotktown cele
bration of representatives of the Ke
Dublican descend uita of .Lafayette and
of bis gallant compatriots who were
our allies ia the Kc volution, has served
to strengthen the spirit of good will
wbicb bos always existed Detween tne
two nations.
You wilt be furnished witb the pro
ceedings of the Hi-metallic Conference
held during tne summer at tue city oi
Paris. No accord was reached, but a
valuable interchange of views was had,
and the Conference will next year be
renewed.
At the Electrical Exhibition and
Congress, also held at Paris, this coun
try was creditaoiy represeniea oy emi
nent spt cialiats, who, in the absence of
an aooronriation. generously lent their
efforts at the instance ot the btate De
partment. While our exhibitors
in this almost distinctively Amer
ican field of achievement have
won several valuable awards,
I recommend that Congress provide for
the repayment of the peisonal expenses
incurred in the public interest by the
honorary commissioners and deleuate.-..
No new questions respecting the status
ot our naturalized citizens in Germany
have arisen during the year, and ihe
causes ot complaint, especially in
Alsace aud Lorraine, has practically
ceased, through the liberal action of the
Imperial Government in accepting our
often expressed views ou the subject.
The applicant of the treaty of 1808 to
the lately acquired ivhemsh provinces
has received very earnest attention. A
definite and lasting agreement on this
point- is confidently expected. The
participation of the descendants of
tsarou von ateuoen in tne xorxtown
festivities, and there subsequent recep
tion bv their American kinsmen, strik'
inslv evinced the ties of good will
which unite the German people and
oui own. Uur intercourse witb
Spa; has been friendly. An
agret ent, concluded in February last,
fixes a . rm for the labors f the Span
ish and American Claim Commission.
The Spanish Government has been re
quested to pay the late awards of that
commission, and will, it is believed,
accede to tne request aa promptly and
courteously as on former occasions.
By recent legislations onerous fines
have been imposed upon American
shipping in Spanish and colonial ports
for slight irregularities in their mani
fests. One case of hardship is specially
worthy of mention. The bark Mason
ic, bound for Japan, entered Manilla
in distress, and is there sought to be
confiscated under the Spanish revenue
laws for an alleged shortage in her
transhipped cargo. Though efforts for
ber relief have thus far proved una
vailing, it is expected that the whole
will be adjufited in a friendly spirit.
The Senate resolutions of condolence
an the assassination of the Czar Alex
andur II. were appropriately communi
cated to the Russian Government,
which in turn has exDressed its svmp
athy iu our lute national bereavement.

CONSULAR AND TRADE RELATIONS.
The consular agretment with Italy
has been sanctioned and proclaimed,
which puts at rest iheconfiiclsot juris
diction in the case ol ciiures on ship
board, several important internation
al conferences have been neiu in naiy
during the year; at the Coi.grets ot
Venice, the Gonetice Congress of Milan
and the Nice Congress of X aiui. This
country was represented by delegates
trom branches oi the public service or
by private citizens, duly accredited in
an houorary cpcity. It is heped that
Cngrt'bs will give such prominence to
the results ot their participation as
they may seem to deserve.
The abolition of ail disci iminaiing
duties against such colonial produc
tions ot the Dutch East Indies aa are
imported hither from Holland has been
already considered by Congress. 1
trust that at the present session the
matter may be favorably concluded.
The insecurity of lit e and property in

particularly to the better protection of
American uiissionains in the Empire.
The condemned murderer of the emi
nent missionary, Dr. Justin W. Par
sons, has not yet been executed, al
though this Government has repeatedly
demanded that exemplary justice be
done.
The Swiss government has solicited
the grodotlices of our diplomatic and
consular agents for the protection of
Us citizens in countries where it is not
iiself represented. This request has
within proper limits been granted. Our
agents in Switzerland have been in
structed to protest against the conduct
of the authorities ot certain communi
ties in permitting the emigration to this
country of criminals and other object
ionable persons. Several such persons,
through the co-operation of the Com
missioners of Emigration at New York,
have been sent back by the steamers
which brought them. A continuance
of this course may prove a more effect
ual remedy than diplomatic remon
strances. Treaties of commerce and navigation
and for the regulation of consular
privileges have been concluded with
Koumania and Servia, since their ad
mission into the family of European
States.
NEIGHBORING STATES.
havint? like institutions aud like aims
of advancement aud development, the
iriendship of the United Mates and
Mexico has been constantly maintained
Tue Government has lost no occasion
ot encouraging the Mexican govern
ment to a beneucial realization ot the
mutual advantage which will result
fiom intimate commercial intercourse
and from the onening of the rich inte-
ior of Mexico to rail way enterprise. I
deem it important that means be pro
vided to restrain tne lawlessness, un
fortunately so common on the frontier.
and to suppress the lorays of the reser
vation Indians on either side a tne uio
Grande. The neighboring Mates of
Central America have preserved inter
nal peace and their out ward relations to
ward us have been those of intimate
friendship. There are eucoui aging
signs ol their growing disposition to
subordinate their local interests to
those which are common to them by
reason of their geographical relations.
The boundary dispute lietween Guata-
mela and Mexico has attorded th's Gov
ernment an opportunity to exercise its
good offices for preventing a rupture
between these Slates and for procuring
a peaceful solution of the question. 1
cherish a strong hope that, in view of
our relations of amity with both coun
tries, our friendly counsels will pre
vail. A special envoy of Guatauiela
has brought to me the condolences of
his Government and people on the
death of President Garfield.
The Costa Itica Government lately
formed an agreement with Colombia
for settling by arbii ration the boundary
question between those countries, pro
viding that the post of arbitrator should
be ottered successfully to the King or
the belgian, the King of Spain and the
President of the Argentiue uomeaer-
ation. The King of the Belgians has
declined to act, but I am not as yet ad-
visea or me acnon or me -ivuig oi
Spain. As we have certain interests
in the disputed territory, which are
protected by our treaty engagement
with one of the Darties. it is important
that the aibitration should not, with
out our consent affect our rights, and
this Government has accordingly
thought proper to make its views
known to the parlies to the agreement,
as well as to intimate them to the Bel
gian and all Spanish Governments.
THE PANAMA CANAL NEGOTIATIONS.
The questions growing out of the
proposed inter-oceanic water way
across the Isthmus of Panama are of
grave national impoitance. This gov
ernment has not been unmindful of the
solemn obligations imposed upon it. by
its compact of 1846 with Colombia, as
the independent and sovereign mis
tress of the territory crossed by the
canal, and has sought to render them
efTeotiie bv fresh encasements with
the Colombian Republic, looking to
their practical execution. The nego
tiations to this end alter tney nod
reached what appeared to be a mutual
ly satisfactory solution here, were met
in Columbia by a disapproval or tne
powers which its envoy had assumed
and by a proposal for a lenewed tego
tiat ion on a modified basis. Meanwhile
this government learned that Colombia
had proposed to the European powers
to join in a guarantee of thn neutrality
of tne proposed 1'anama canal, a guar
antee which would be in direct contra
diction of our obligation as the sole
guarantor of the guarantee of the
Colombian territory and of the neutral
ity of the canal itself. My lamented
predecessor felt it bis duty to place be
fore the European powers the reasons
which make the prior guarantee of the
United States indispensable, and
for which the interjection of
any lore! en guarantee might
be regarded as a superfluous and un
friendly act. Foreseeing the probable
reliance of the British Government on
the provisions of the Clayton-Uulwer
treaty of 18."0, as affording room for a
share in the guarantees, which the
United States covenanted with Colum
bia four years before. I have not hesi
tatetl to supplement the action of mv
piedecessor, by proposing to Her Mai-
esty's Government tne modification of
that instrument and the abrogation of
euch clauses thereof as do not comport
with Hie obliga. ions of Hit United
States towaids Columbia, or with the
vital needs of the two Iriendly pdities
to the com pact.
SOUTH AMERICAN RELATIONS.
This Government sees with great
concern the continuance ot the hostile
relations between Chili and Bolivar and
Peru. An early peace between these
republics is much to be desired, not
only tht they may themselves be
ptrvd lurihir misery and bloodshed,
but because their continued antago
nism has consequences w hich are, ia
my judKmeut, dangarous to the inter
ests of republican government on this
continent, and are calculated to destroy
the best elements of ouriieeand peace
ful civiliz.ition. As in the pi esent ex
cited condition ol popular feeling in
these countries there have been serious
umappietienbioiis 1 1 the position of the
United States, and as separate diplo
matic intercourse with each, through
indepi npent minibters, is sometimes
subject, owing to the want of prompt
reciprocal communication, to a tem
porary ujisuiidei standing, I have
deemed it judicu us at the present time
to send a special envoy act-ret lied to
all and each of them, and furnished
with general instructions w hich will, I
trust, enable him to bring these powers
into friendly relations.
The government of Venezuela main
tains its attitude of waim friendship
aud continues with great reculanty its
payment of the monthly quota ot the
diplomatic debt. Without suggesting
the direction in which Congress should
act, 1 ask its attei.tion to the pending
questions affecting the distiii ution of
the sums thus far received. The rela
tions between Venezuela and France,
growing out of the same debt, have
been for some time past in an unsatis
factory state, and this G .verumet t, as
the neighbor and one of the largest
creditors of Venezuela, has interposed
itself since with the French govern
ment with the view ot producing a
friendly and honorable adjustment.
I regrettbat the commercial interests
between the United States and Brazil,
from which great advantages were
hoped a year ago, have suffered from
the withdrawal of the American lines
of communication between the Brazil
ian ports and our own.
Through the efforts of our Minister
resident at Buenos Ayres, and the
United States Minister at Santiago, a
treaty has been concluded between the
Argentine Republic and Chili disposing
of the long pending Pantagonian boun
dary question, it is a matter or con
gratulation that our Government has
been affoided the opportunity of suc
cessfully exerting its good ii.tluence tor
the prevention of disagreements be
tween the republics oi the American,
continent.
ORIENTAL DIPLOMACY.
am glad to you the
treaties lately negotiated with China
have bttn duly rati tied on both sides
and the exchange made at IV kin. Leg
islation is necessary to carry the pro
visions into effect. The prompt and
liiendly spirit with which the Chinese
Government, at the request of the
United States, conceded the modifica
tion ol existing treaties should secme
careful regard for the interests and
susceptibilities or that government in
the enactment of any laws relating to
Chinese immigration. Those classes of
the treaties which foibid the participa
tion of.citizens or vessels of the United
States in the opium trade, will doubts
less leceive your approval. They wilt
attest the sincere interest which cur
neonle and Government feel in the
commendable efforts of tie Chinese
Government to put a stop to this de
moializing and destructive trafiic. In
relation both to China and Japan some
changes are desirable in our present
system of consular jurisdiction and i
hope at someluture time to lay before
you a scheme for its improvement iu
the entire east.
The intimacy between our country
and Japan, the most advanced of the
eastern nations, .continues to be cordial.
I am advised that tne Jmperor con
templates the establishment of a full
constitutional government, and that he
has already summoned a parliamentary
congress lot the purpose or enecting
the change. Such a remarkable step-
toward complete assimilation wun tne
western system cannot fail to bring
Japan into closer and more beneticia
relationship with ourselves as the chiet
Pacific power.
A question has arisen in relation to
the exercise in that country of the
judicial functions conferred upon our
Ministers and Consuls. The indict
ment, trial and conviction m the Con
sular Court at Yokohorr. a of John Boss,
a merchant seaman on board an Amer
ican vessel, have made it necessary for
the Government to institute a careful
examination into the nature and meth
ods of this jurisdiction. It appeared
that Ross was regularly snipped under
the flaz of the United States, but was
by birth a British subject. My prede
cessor ieit it nis uuiy io maiuwiu tun
position that during his service as a
regularly shipptd seaman on board of
an American merchant vessel Ross was
subject to the laws of that service and
to the jurisdiction of the United States
Consular authorities.
I renew the recommendation wbicb
has been heretofore urged by the execu
tive upon the attention of Congress,
that alter the reduction of such amount
as may be found due to American citi
zens, the balance of the indemnity fund
heretofore obtained from China and
Japan, and which is now in the hands
of the State Department, be returned
to the government of those countries.
The King of Hawaii, in the course of
his homeward return after a journey
around the world, has lately visited
this country. While our relations with
that kingdom remain friendly, tWa
government has viewed with concern
the efforts to seek a repleuishment of
the diminishing population of the is
land Irom outward sources, to a de
gree which may impair the native sov
ereignity and independency in which
the United States was among the first
to testify a lively interest.
Relations of unimpaired unity have
been maintained throughout the year
with the respective governments of
Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Denmark.
Uayti, Paraguay and Uruguay, Portu
gal and Sweden and Norway. This may
also be said of Greece and Ecuador, al
though our relations with those States
have for some years been severed by
the withdrawal of appropriations for
diplomatic representatives at Athens
and Quito. It seems expedient to re
store those mipsions, even on a reduced
scale, and I decidedly recomrot nd Mich
a course with respect to Ecuador,
which is likely within the near future
