HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,
FALMOUTH, Va., Dec. 17th.
Yesterday morning the enemy seemed as
tounded to find us safe on this side of the river.
About 9 o'olock the enemy advanced skirm
ishers along tbe entire lino, eetabliabing pickets
near tbe rirer bank.
We bad a large number of dead on what was
regarded neutral ground. Tbe rebels were
plainly seen robbing the bodies. At 11 o'clook
ladles were seen walking in tho streets of Fred
ericksburg. un Monday rrankiin sent a nag oi truce lor
exobange of dead, which was done. Yester
day Lee sent a flag to Burnside, asking him to
detail men to bury his dead in front of Sumner's
division. Daring the truoe, rebel Gen. Stuart,
in answer to a question, laid Banks bad gone
South, but be did not know where. '
Our entire armr la now encamped on tbe
ground previously oooupled. Tbe army has
been considerably relnforoed.
It Is the opinion of military men that if we
had taken the first rldgo of rebel works, tbelr
opportunity for slaughtering as would hare
been greater than previously. No troops In tbe
world could withstand suoh concentrated fire of
ordnance and musketry.

the woods for miles In the roar of their position,
where they bad been carried during the

Mr. btevens also reported a bill to supply de
ficiency in appropriations for 16G3; whioh waa
made tbe speolal order for Tuesday next.
The House then went Into committee of tbe
Whole on the President's message.
Mr. Noel of Missouri argued that tbe present
organised uemooratio party aid not render un
qualified support to the war, but was oontlnually
tnrowing ODataoiea m ine way or lis prosecu
tion, tie unaeriooK to say mat it was a delu
sion to think that this war might bare been
prevented by the adoption of the- Crittenden
compromise, ll wae true that some of the
leaders of the rebellion had roled for that com
promise, but tbe history of subsequent events
shows tbat if ten or twelve rotes had been nec
essary to defeat that meaeuro, they could hare
been procured. He would go further, and say
tbat there waa nothing in tbe Crittenden com
promise that would have prevented the rebel
lion. The enemies of the Administration beld
out the idea that tbe war was not for the res
toration of peace, but for the abolition of
slavery; but this waa nntrue, although such
might be the result. 1 hey assert that tbe Ad
ministration tramples on the Constitution, and
all the' rights and privileges under that Instru
ment are to be swept by the board, and that
the Union la to be contended for without the
Constitution. He had witnessed some of these
so-called violations of tbe Constitution. When
the war broke out, the enemies of tbe country
were not confined to rebel States, but were
eoattered all over the land. Never waa a con
spiracy so well ooncooted.
notwithstanding me opinion ot Judges Taney
aud Story as to the President's being guilty of
a violation of the Constitution in suspending
tbe privileges of the writ of habeas corpus, he
justified President Lincoln In doing so. It was
bis duty to use all means to suppress the rebel
lion; Confiscation of rebel property ia another
pretext for making war on tbe Administration,
men of the border States who have been tram
pled in the dust take it as unkind that tbe
enemies of tbe war expend tbelr sympathies
only upon the wives and children of men en
gaged In the rebellion. The border Stales wish
to see retaliation visited on tbe rebels for their
crimes.
Again, tho enemies of this war exhibit fright
ful pictures of the finanolal condition of tbe
country; but those who got np rebellion are
responsible lor every drop ol blood, every dol
lar of extraordinary expenditure and for all
Irregularities committed. Mr. Noel proceeded
to contrast tbe ooorse of the anti-war party of
1813 witb that of the present day, insisting
that the parallel was perfect. Ia this conneo
tion be quoted the position ot the Federalists
of Massachusetts at tbat time.
Mr. Thomas of Massachusetts, Interrupting,
said: If the gentleman from Missouri desired
in any way to give character to tbe class of men
whom both of them condemned namely, the
peace Democrats he conld not have pursued a
more efieotual course, for the old Federalists of
New England were the most honest party that
ever lived beneath tho throne of God. v
Mr. Noel, resuming, said be started with the
proposition that the present organized Demo
cratic party was inconsistent. When slavery
comes in as an element of rebel strength, and
the question la presented betweon its perpetua
tion and the preservation ot tbe Union, tbon
let the former die.
