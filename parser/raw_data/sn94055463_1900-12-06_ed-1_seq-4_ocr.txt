THURSDAY , DEC. 0 , 1000.
Senator Allen uaya that Bryan
will bo nominated for president
again in 1004. Say , would not that
bo a niouio for the republican can
didate ?
The Beacon oamo out last week
against the democratic party , and in
iavor of the pooplo'n independent
party again , The Beacon ac
knowledges that the party has frit
tered away its chanced in the last
two presidential campaigns , but it
dooe not acknowledge that the mid-
readers were right ,
There are so many candidates for
senatorial honors , that it is pretty
hard to guess whom the winning
candidates will bo. There is ono
prediction that is more than a guess ,
and that is if Senator Gurrio is
otio of the candidates elected , that it
will add strength to the republican
party for the campaign two years
houoo. The selection of clean and
capable uiun by any party as stand ,
ard bearers , creates confidence in
the organization with the public.
The game of foot ball played at
Lincoln last Thurnday between the
college team of Minnesota and the
boys of the State University at
Lincoln , resulted in o victory for
Minnesota , with a score of 12 to 20.
Neither team had lost a game this
season. Nebraska made the largest
number of scoies against Minnesota
that had been made this season , It
was beef against science. The
Minnesota boys averaged over 200
pounds , while our boys only aver
aged 105 pounds.
The Omaha World.Herald and a
Lincoln evening paper have raised
cry over the fact that Governo
Dietrich cortitlcd in bin oxponflo
report that ho had given 125 to
Homo ono for a barbecue , or for
tickets to scats to a dinner , and
those papers would have it appear
that Mr. Dietrich has committed ai
offouso which makes him ineligible
to the office to which ho has boon
elected. This is only an attempt to
make it appear that there is ground
for a contest. Wo do not believe
that the law of 1800 has been violated
lated in this instance. The barbe-
ouo or dinner was never given , and
had it beou given the effect would
have been the same because Mr.
Dietrich was not giving an "enter
tainmont of a mooting of electors , "
as named in the law , but simply
purchased tickets to a dinner given
by someone else. No cno will deny
that ho had a right to buy a ticket
to a theater , but ho had no right to
buy a theater and give it to the
electors. Kearney Democrat.
Congress convened Monday noon
The receiving and reading of the
president's message was the iiret
duty to command the attention of
both houscp , after admitting new
members. The president's message
is another of his able and compre
hensive papers that delights the
public to rend. In reciting the
progress made in the industrial
avocations the past year , splendid
conditions arc presented. Our ex
ports have largely exceeded our
imports , and secured a handbome-
balance in favor of our national
treasury. This government's deal
ings with our new possessions , and
China , is treated exhaustively , and
every act plainly justified , While
a showing of plain facts cannot bo
disputed , wo notice the opposition
'press , in commenting upon hU
message , speaks slightingly of it ,
yet the subjects presented cannot
bo wholly ignored. lu speaking of
the message editorially , the World-
Ilorald says : "President McKinley *
in the communication that ho sent
to congress yesterday , dealt with
subjects of tuoio importance than
moat of his { [ predoooaBors had to
deal with , "
In the ollioial onnvaHH of the state
vote , we find liio following majori
ties for the republican candidate * :
President AfcICinloy , 7,822 ; U , II ,
Diotrioh , for governor , HOI ; E. P.
Savage , for lieutenant governor ,
2,802 ; Gee W. Marsh , for secretary
of state , 3,701 ; Charles Weston , for
auditor , 4,008 ; William Stnofer ,
for treasurer , 4,030 ; W. K. Fowler ,
for attorney general , 4,817 ; Frank
N. ProtH , for superintendent of pub.
Ho instruction , 4,817 ; Geo. D
Follmor , for land commissioner1
4,142. Without the gain of Custor
county , Diotrioh would have boon
defeated , but the other candidates
would have pulled through , had
Custor given her old time pop ma
jority.
Among the applicants for state
appointment under the incoming
administration , is our own towns
man , Ed. Itoysc , who desires the
position of foorotary of the State
Banking Board , .Probably there
has not boon an application iilcd for
a position in the state , whore the
applicant is more woithy or better
qualified to fill the position for
which ho applies than is Mr. Royso.
llis long experience as assistant
cashier in the Central Nebraska
National Bank , arid his subsequent
oxperieuoo as dnpuly commissioner
of public lauds and buildings , to
gether with his experience as an
abstractor , which requires careful
and accurate work , especially fits
him for the position or secretary of
the state banking board , llin
claim , from a political standpoint ,
can bo second to none. His able
management o ( republican interests
n Custer county the past two ycare
as chairman of the county central
committee , speaks for itself. There
s no county in the state , regardless
of population , that has made the
republican gains that Custer county
lias. In addition to his qualifica
tions and political claim , ho is a
man of mature judgement , clean
roootd , HtricUy moral , honest , uud
in every respect a good citizen , who
anjoys the confidence and esteem
of all who have his acquaintance.

The increasing popularity of

comment among railroad men. It
is aaid that 85 per cent of the pas

STATE CAPITAL GOSSIP ,
Lincoln , Neb. , Deo. 3 , ( Special
Correspondence ) The last week
has boon n vrry lively ono at the
capital for the ronson tlmt the ap
plicants for the plaoos under the in
coming administration have boon on
hand to look after their interests.
The announcement that the heads
of slatu institutions will select their
own subordinates has relieved the
proHHuro Homywhat.
It is conceded by all republicans
that Chairman Lindiay of the state
committee deserves somntlnug hand
some , and that Inn appointment an
private secretary to the governor is
only temporary. Ho was looked
upon OB the right man to help the
now governor past the stormy period
oi the first six mouths. As a party
move , the selection is a wise one.
It is poesihlo for a private hoorctary
to make or mar the political future
of a governor , a fact which Governor
Poyntor now realizes to its fullest
( .y. tent.
The act ot a fusion supreme court
in killing the slate board of trans
portation as soon as it was certain
that fusion job-holders could no
longer derive their living from it ,
was a thoroughly selfish performance
anco which will , however , strike a
responsive cord all over thu state a
very unusual situation.
Tl'ore is a very strong hint that
ether state boards ao : in danger of
being lopped oil by the coming
legislature. The barber's board is
a laughing stock everywhere. The
slate oil inspection has long boon
known to bo a fraud , perpetuated
to make easy berths for political
btrikors. The fact that no oil is
really inspected , that certificates of
fineness have been pasted on vinegar
barrels , and that the whole system
is used to prevent competition in
the oil buHiucGS in Nebraska , justi
fies a message from the governor
abolishing the "bureau. " It is
quite possible such a message will
bo sent in ,
It is now apparent. that the in
coming state officials have concluded
to make a "clean swoop" when it
coinen to making state appoint
ments. They think that the state
has so fur been scandalized by the
people who hnvo hold jobs during
the past four years , that it will be
no mistake to jump them all out of
office and try a full now set , both
upper and lower.
In the meantime there is a dis
position to sec to it that the useless
employes in the various depart
ments are not appointed , and this
disposition also reaches toward the
legislature , as is learned from the
members who have visited this
city in the past wook.
The contest for speakership ol
the house is beginning to warm up.
The general belief is that it will be
settled entirely outtido the sanatoria
fight , and that the legislature will
l-o organized along thoroughly busi
ness lines , rather than as an adjunct
to the senatorial struggle.
'I lib secretary of state realizing
the need of a "oloan swoop" has
bought line no * carpets for the
legislative halls. Llo wanted the
new men to have now things to
walk on , and besides ho wanted to
exotoirto bis last privilege of buying
things with the poplo's money.
The stAte o Miimitteo has con
cluded to kuop open all winter , seas
as to have things ready for the com
ing oamoaign. This move is noted
with satislaction fron all quarters ,
as it is certain to bo productive of
good robiilte. The work that was
done last winter and spring by the
old committee aided in the forma
tion of the splendid organization
which was ctfouled in the campaign
just closed.
The claim of certain counties that
they saved the election of Gover
nor Dietrich ia becoming the sub
ject of much amusmcnt. There are
others entitled tj credit. Without
LautatjlercouiityDiutnoh would have
beou lost. Gage , with ita fourteen
hundred majority , saved the gov
ernorship. If the splendid maj
orities of Burt or Pawnee had boou
reversed the man from Adam
would have boon lost , Custo
county furnishes enough gain to
nave him , while Holt andThurstou
or a dczou other combination gain
did thu buaiussa , The claim of ox
elusive credit by ono county deserves
to bo classed with the celebrated
st-jry of "tho nun that killed the
bear. "
Legislative members and visitors
who oomo to Lincoln to see the
winter performance , will have more
than usual difficulty in securing
jtiartors , Lincoln is pretty well
Hied tip with the natural increase
n population in the last two years ,
ind desirable rooms that heretofore
lave boon at the disposal of the
eglalativo contingent , are nearly all
taken. T'IC ' wiao ones who expect
to spend the winter here are already
ooking up locations.
ADAM GRANGER ,
A Itcmcdy fur Cornstalk lisca o.
Golliob Hisor , supervisor elect of
Mason City , was a city visitor Tues
lay. Ho ban lost fivti head of cattle
with the coniHtalk disease , but ho
thiiiKs ho has a sure preventive of
it now. Ho feeds his cattle millet
lay every morning before turning
them into the stalks , and has lost
no cattle since. Ho thinks the
loath of the cattle is caused by the
ninaUiral cornstalks which grow up
late and never tasseled. This same
theory is maintained by Elmer
Ilogaboom , who lives west of town ,
Llo informed us Saturday that bo
iad gene through his stalk Hold and
cut all such stalks out and burned
thorn. Mr. Iliser says his cattle
did not die from lack of water or
corn , as they were provided with
plenty of both. Ho thinks in ease
a person has not the millet to feed
bin cattle , that straw might be a
sufficient preventive.

after being attacked , and are soon past
