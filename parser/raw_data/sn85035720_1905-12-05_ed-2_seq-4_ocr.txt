COLBY SAYS WINS
IS NOT SATISFACTORY;
Essex County Senator Takes Active
Interest, in the Organization of ;
the House of Assembly.
NEWARK. Dec. 5:?Senator-elect
Everett Colby yesterday limited a ?
statement against the candidacy ot
Samuel K. ltobblns, of Burlington,
for speaker. Although he is not a j
me.mber of the house, Mr. Colby says
he is intensely interested in limited
franchise and equal taxation ideas,
and he feels that his pledges to the
H>ple during the recent campaign
HHMH^ire lhal he U8e whatever inttu
the indorsement of his candl-]
"le l>eol,lG '>?''? given him for (
n^SS&^cement of the principles on j
,'liich tne campaign wan lotigtn in
ny way ho honorably can. Mr. Col- i
v then goes on to nay:
That the message of laws based on
hose principles will lio despurately
enisled by the railroad and public 1
ervire Corporations of our state,
hrough the political bosses who rep
esent them, goes without saying. '
'lie first contest, will come over the i
lection, of n speaker of the house,
vho will have a power, by the up- ;
(ointment- of committees, to mater- '
ally assist or obstruct the passage of 1
hose laws. 1
I am, therefore, strongly of the 1
ipinion that no member of the as- :
iembly, who has pledged himself to I
ho enactment of these principles In- ]
o laws, or favors the same, should 1
'ole in the republican caucus for any '
un^idate for speaker who will not <
leelare himself clearly and unequiv
>cally In favor of the enactment of
iucb laws. ! i
1 inn opposed to the election of Mr.
Bobbins tor two reasons: Kirst, lie;
has declined, I am Informed, to com
mit himself clearly to the support of
these principles. Second, he is re
ceiving. and seems ready to accept,
the support of certain influences
which I have found by experience at
Trenton are bitterly opposed to till i
tlte equal taxation measures for
which we are lighting. Behind hint i
ire the noli ileal bosses and the men
who speak for and represent the rall
?oaus and tho public utility compan
ies in matters of legislation. While j
believe Mr. Bobbins is personally 1
in Incorruptible man, T cannot think
these men would be active In his sup
port if thoy did not have reason to
know that his election as speaker
would help to prevent the full success
sf our measures.
Those, therefore, in favor of equal r
taxation and limited franchises must i
stand together and support some man (
principles, and who is free from the i
influence of these party leaders who ;
have done their utmost to prevent i
their enactment into laws in the past. '

that the probable action of congress

fair solution of the matter.

(The President's message, which
>vas read before congress today, will
3e found in an abridged form on
)age 8 of today's issue.)
WASHINGTON", Dec. 5.?It was a
familiar scene when Vice President
Fairbanks stopped the buzz of conver
sation in the senate chamber with two
strokes of the gavel. There are few
changes in the membership. Death
had taken away Senators Bate (Tenu.)
and I'latt (Conu.). There were no
changes among the senate officials.
The first arrival on the floor was
Senator Sutherland (Utah).
In the senate the proceedings were
brief, but most of the spectators seem
ed to And quite as much to interest
them in observing the senators who
remained 011 the floor after adjourn
ment as they could have experienced
had the session continued longer.
While the house was in session the
president's message was read, and
there was enough of Interest ill that
to hold an exceptionally large uudieuce
during the entire time.
One noticeable feature in the house
was the absence of flowers, which
heretofore have been cothmon to both
chambers. The absence of floral
tributes was due to a resolution adopt
ed unanimously by the senate uml to an
order of the speaker in the house. This
robbed the occasion of much of its plc
turesqueness.
Hepresentative Williams (Miss.), the
leader of the minority in the house, in
troduced a number of bills and joint
resolutions affecting the tariff and
i-ampuign contributions. These con
template free trade with the l'hilip
pi.nes, a reassembling of the United
States ami Uumtdinu joint high com

Another bill proposes to establish a
minimum tariff of the United States.
It declares the existing tariff sched
| Ules to constitute the maximum tnrlff
of the United States and a reduction of
?JO per cent from them Or rates equal to
j four-fifths of the existing duties to con
stitute the minimum tnrlff of the Unit
ed States. The bill extends the opera
tion of the minimum tariff to all such
countries as grunt admission to their
markets of articles the product and
growth of the United States at the
minimum tariff rntes levied by them.
An appeal was made that Mr. Wil
liams might have a minute to reply to
ti question by Mr. Wharton, a new
member from Illinois, who had inquir
ed what Mr. Williams meant by a re
mark about kids.
"With that degree of reverence that
(he personal appearance of my Interro
gator excites In my mind I should re
ply that he is the last man in the house
to ask what a kid is."
Tills rejoinder by Mr. Williams was
received with hearty laughter.

had answered the hitter's salutation
with a "Hello. Henry." Rockwell noted
the change and marveled.

and In sight of a pretty little cottage on

aged to reuch the platform and wave a
response to a little woman standing on
the piazza. Rockwell then hud his
hands full until the express reached
Albany, and be swung out in the sta
tion.
Frank E. Perle.v, secretary to Gov
ernor Higgins. pressed through the
crowd, bearing in bis hand a roll deco
rated with the state seal and blue rib
bons. He thrust the roll into Rock
well's hand and as the letter's eyes
opened wide with amazement said:
"This makes you railroad commis
sioner, Mr. Rockwell."
Rockwell tried to speak, but couldn't.
The news had spread among a dozen
railroad officials, who pressed around to
congratulate him. At last he managed
to say:
"I thank you, indeed I thank you. but
I must take my train on to Buffalo."
When Rockwell stepped from the
train at Albany he whs glad to be earn
ing wages at the rate of $14-1 a month.

ceive $8,000 a year for live years and
expenses.
