COLA, n L I Z A It I).
. The Candidate for Delegate.
Col. Blizard, the nominee lordelegale
to represent McMIun county in the
Constitutional Convention, addressed i
Urge number of hit fellow-citizen at
the Court-House on Monday. .. lie was
JisteneJ to with interested at'ention,
and we think lilt views iu regard to the
necessity (or Convention and the Im-
portant duties which will devolve upon
It, not only accorded with the opinions
of a large majority present, but im
proved thcio with the belief that he
might be fully trusted to reflect and
represent them in that body. Aa our
paper can only reach a limited number
of renders before the election, we will
not attempt to report the remarks of
the speaker in detail. It is sufficient to
state, in addition to what has already
been said, that his views on all ques
tions likely t4 enter Into the delibera
tions of the Convention are pre-eminently
sound, wise and liberal, and gen
erally in linrniony with thos enunciat
ed by loading minds in other portions
of the State. Col. Wizard, as we un
derstand him, does not propose to wipe
out the Constitution of 1834, not to pull
down and tenr to pieces, but to go hear
tily and earnestly for whatever reforms
and amendments of the organic law
may be necessary to the future protec
tion and pence of the people, and to se
cure for all lime to come equal and ex
act justice to all men under the law, of
whatever raco or color. We can only
add, that if the people elect him, Mc
Minn, which ranks among the foremost
counties In the State in point of popu
lation, intelligence and wealth, will have
an honest and able representative in the
Constitutional Convention ; and to that
end we urge all to go to the polls in
their respective civil districts and vote
for liiin.
When Col. Blizard had closed his re
marks on Monday. Col. G. W. Bridges,
who is a candidate for delegate, appear
ed and addressed the people at some
length. Ho was listened to with re
spectful attention. We inferred from
the gentleman's remarks that ho is not
much for " Convention," and presume
that most of his support will eomo from
thoso who are opposed to it.
Tho Judiciary.
Writers in different portions of the
State aro discussing the best iiiouh of
electing a Judiciary, .and ninny of them
argue and insist that the election of such
officers should bo taken out of the hands
of the people and bo committed to the
Legislature, as under tho Constitution
of 1831 before the amendment changing
tho mode. The arguments adduced are
plausible in some degree, if not convinc
ing. And yet wo are in doubt whether
the step would be wise at this juncture.
Whatever the proposed State Conven
tion may do must be submitted to the
people for their ratification and rejec
tion. We aro now reaping some of the
evil effects of centralization. History
and experience both teach that power
is nlwnys stealing from the many to the
few. In framing our form of govern
ment it w as divided into threo co-ordinate
departments, each with its separate
and distinct duties and functions clear
ly defined. But the Chief Executive of
the Nation to-day is but a mere cypher
in the Government, and that august tri
bunal, the Supreme Court of tho United
States, trembles and is demoralized In
the prcsenco of a mnjorily of reckless
politicians in the National Legislature,
For somo years tho wliole tendency has
been towards centralization, both iu the
Federal and Slate .Governments; and
the people of Tennessee would perhaps
do well to retain the election of tho Ju
diciary directly in their own hands
The system is o doubt liable to abuses,
but wo would as soon risk the peoplo to
make good selections for such olllces as
a partisan Legislature.
An Important Law
On the llrst page of the Toft to-day
will be found a copy Of an act passed
tho flrsi of December, 18M, to " amend
the Criminal Laws of tho State." This
act provides that each voter shall vote
in the civil district where ho resides,
and tlmt a violation of tho provision
will render the party guilty of a misdc
monitor, for which he may be indicted
and fined not less than twenty nor more
than fifty dollars. We invito attention
to the act, and ask that our friends give
as much publicity as possible to its
provisions before tho polls open to
morrow.
Tho Floterlnl District.
Col. Nat. Witt and T. M. Ilurkotf. Esq.,
candidates to represent Meigs, Polk and
McMluii in tho State Convention, were
both here In tho early part of the week
circulating among tho people. On Tues
day, Mr. Burkett made a speech at the
Court-House, explaining why it was
that he appeared as a eandldnte. Col.
Witt also made a few remarks. We re
gret that these gentlemen, who are warm
friends, should bo In opposition to each
other on this occasion, They are good,
clever mon, and we have nothing to sny
prejudicial to either.
WST Vote in your own civil district.
' Defeated In the Senate.
House bill for the "payment of the
Slate debt by allowing railroads indebt-,
ed to the State to pay into the Treasury
of the State my of the legally Issoed
bonds, without regard to series or num
bers," lias been defeated In the Senate,
by a vote 01 10 to 7. We are not ad
vised of the grounds of opposition to
the bill which led to Its rejection by a
vote so decided, or whether its provis
ions were peculiarly calculated to re
open the door to fraud and corruption.
But we do think some measure of the
kind should be adopted to relieve the
State and the roads; and bclievo that.
with all tho talent, wisdom and legal
abilicy now congregated at the Capitol.
it would not be difficult to so frame and
construct a law as to guard against the
possibility of abnse. We know it Is
quite common, and even popular, now-a-days
to go for the Railroads, for al
leged abuses of their powers, and some
of them have rendered themselves fit
objects of assaults, but there are lead
ing lines, solvent and doing a legitimate
business, which mcd tho State aid for
the purposo for which it was extended
to them, and these ought not to be in
discriminately classified with tho du
bious enterprises that liavo was I oil and
squandered every dollar they could lay
their hands on. Clean out the rotten
and bogus concerns, but give l! the aid
and comfort consistent with the public
interest to solvent Companies w hose uf
fairs have been administered with some
regard to honesty and fair dealing.
' Whnt we desire in, to see the Stato re
lieved from at least a portion of its lia
bilities and the heavy loud of interest
and taxation it is carrying. If the bill
in question was calculated to do this,
wc regret Its defeat, and trust another
will be adopted having for its purpose
similar objects. To leave the pecuniary
obligations of the State, direct and in
direct, in their present condition, with
out tho mentis of lessening them, or
even to pay the constantly accumulating
interest, will be n step iu the direction
of llcpudintiwn s contingency which
we are certain no Tonnesseean wants to
sec occur.
Against Convention.
The Nashville correspondent of the
Knoxvillo Pre and lkruhl telegraphs
his paper that tho Radicals of Middle
and West Tennessee have organized
and will volo solid against 'Conven
tion." It may be possible there is an
understanding among them to that ef
fect in this coutitv and throughout East
Tennessee, but we don't know that such
is the fact; and all wo have to say In re
gard thereto is this: those who favor n
Convention, and who clamored while
out) branch Of the Legislature hesitated,
have a clear, ascertained majority of
fllty thousand in the State, nud if they
cannot afford to spare time to go to the
polls to-morrow and record themselves
accordingly, we trust they will hereafter
hold their pence and cease to make the
air vocal with their plaints about the
wrongs and oppressions of which we
have heard so much within the last few
years. Either take a step forward, or
dry up, .
The School Law.
The bill abolishing tho present com
mon school system hns passed a third
reading in both branches of the Legis
In t tire. It contains a provision leaving
it with the County Courts tolevyaspc
cial tax for school purposes. The old
law was susceptible of ninny nbttses,
but whether tho one in question Is likely
to be productive of better results, wc
must wait until an opportunity occurs
to become moro familiar with its pro
visions before determining. We pro
pose to publish the bill in full as soon
as we can procure a correct copy.

Southern Comment.
The Mobile Ilegiittr Pius says of the
President's Message: , '
The first Message of President Grant,
received by the wires last n'ght. Is
spread before our readers this morning.
A more careful reading than we could
steal from the copy in printers' lands is
neressarf to justify comment on it It
does not appear to be a strong docu
ment, except in the essentials er luai-
eal dogmatism. It is redolent enough
of reconstruction. Poor Georgia is to
be rooked over again in the reconstruc
tion pot. aecordiug to Presidential ad
vice, while Virginia is to be let In. The
President tells a thumping falsehood
with which to astound mankind when
ho tells Congress we are the freest
people in the world." Then God help
those naiions mat are less ire.
The Message is prudent and conserva
tive in its foreign policy. An abun
dance of sympathy for Cuba, but iioth-
ing substantial a truly Giukt policy
or "rocking on,' and awaiimg events,
lie is for returning to specie payments
noon hut when or how, not indicated ,
that is to say w e are to resume when

to be the message of the chief of the

The following is our latest from
Washington In regard to Tennessee:
The movement on the; part of some
of the Tennessee Congressmen to have
Congress take measures to reconstruct
that State has not met with favor gene
rally in tho Radical party, none of the
leaders of tho House1, favoring the

this reconstruction business is about, to

parly to undertake lo interfere in the
affairs of a Slate fully represented1 in
Congress. No doubt, however, tho at
tempt will be made as foreshadowed in
the resolution ottered cm Saturday by
one of the members from that State. ,

A Louisville dispatch says: .fudge
Hoke, of tho .Tcllcrsou County Court,
rendered an important decision lo-dav
in the case of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky vs. tho Louisville City Na
tional Bank, on the application of the
attorneys for tho defense to dismiss the
rule issued. Suit was instituted to re
cover the tax levied by the State on the
income arising from 'the United States
bonds held by the bank, and the deri
sion, which will apply to all banks hold

Legislature constitutional and the net
of Congress forbidding the tax uncon

The New York Negroes.
Wo have tho authority of P. B. Swee

that n majority of the negroes in New

that the Radical Invention of universal

Reduction of Taxation.
The New Y'ork JYmcs calls upon
Congress to address itself at ouco fo
the ways and means of reduced taxa
tion. That is a point, it thinks, which
should prcredo even the consideration
of specie payment. It says:
"The peoplo can, endure yet longer
tho evil ot a depreciated currency.
They are willing to concede time for the
conversion of outstanding bonds into
others bearing a lower rate of interest,
Bui they aro not willing to sustain a
load of taxation which impairs nil en
ergy, injures nil industry and commerce,
nnd yields a revenue far iu excess of
the actual requirements of tho Govern
ment." Coming to Their Senses.
A Richmond correspondent write
that the late spill iu the Radical party
lias caused a widespread distrust among
the colored people of botli those classes
of white men known as "carpet-baggers"
and "scalawags." They openly
avow their belief on all hands that these
men have sought their support only for
selfish ends, and their confidence only
to betray and abuse it. It is not at all
uncommon to hear idem nver that they
would more readily trust and rote for
General Wise than for nny ol the needy
adventurer that proclaim themselves
so loudly tho friendj of the colored
race.
