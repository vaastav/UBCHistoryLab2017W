THE PANAMA CANAL.
tl ytdl Cost Fully $140,000,000 end will
be FiuUlirrt In lSBti.
The effloial bulletin of the Panama Canal
Company gives a reiume of the ttutoinents of
Uomeunder Gorringe, formerly of the United
Jtates avy, which were published some time
if o in America, giving the result of his in
mcction of the worn done on the canal up to
July of this year. At that time only one
Jeveoteenth part of the actual culting of the
Enl had bosn finishod, while the expenses so
ir incurred nmountod to one-sixth of tlio
estimated total Outlay. Commander Gorringe
tonoluded that the canal would oust eventually
130,000,000, and would be completed at the
late- by January 1, 1890.
The American contractor, Nathaniel McKny,
reports that 20,000 rativos ot the Carribee
Islands are employed in piercing the isthmus.
They earn $1.50 to $2 daily. They are now
mostly occupied in cutting immense trenohos
through the hills, which will bo carried down
to a level with the oocnu. When this wo;k is
finished and the river Ch g (is has beon turned
Iroiu iu oau rse, the most ar luous part of the
andertaking will be ovor. ihen excavating and

the whole oourso of the luture canal. Mr.
MbKay rofrauis from cxpre sing any opinion
as to when tho work will bo completed.
IN THE DEPTHS,
Lota of the Mary Joseph, the Crew of

Tho first particulars of the loss of the Now

Joseph on the bench noar her destination, hav
ing been oast ashoro during a tempestuous and
densely dark night. Since then the inhabit
ants havo been actively searching for other
vestiges and tho remains of those on board,
but lu vain. The Mary Joseph was only of 20
tons, and had a cargo of oonl. She sailed from
North Sydney for Channel Nov. 20, called at
Ingonlsh, C. B,, and on the 22d proceeded for
hor destination. At Ingonish siie took one
passenger a womnn named Kate Williams.
Xlio vessel's orew, numbering five all of

THE BANKRUPTCY BILL
nepvesentatlve Collins' Views as to Its
Chances in the House.
Representative Collins ot Massachusetts,
who has ehavgo of the bankruptcy bill reported
from tho Home committee on the judiciary las'
session, in an interview with an Associated
Pxess representative said: "An effort is being
made to learn if members who wera opposed
to tho measuro have changed their minds since
tho rooent clcotiou. On May 19th an effort
was made to consider tho bill in the House
under suspension of rules, or to have a day set
apart for its consideration. A two-thirds vote
otouiso'Sio object? oi'tflie'(r??en3? &? InblJul
was defeated. It will be necessary to seouie
20 or 30 votes Irom tho opponents of the mea
suro to pass it. Tho greatest opposition is
from the South and We3t. Indiana, Missouri
and Kentucky are almost solidly opposed to it.
Without seouring the necessary two-thirds voto
to get a suspension of the rules, there is no
hope tor the bill. It is on the calendar, and in
Suoh a position that it will be impossible to
roach it in so short a session. An attempt to
Suspend the rules will be made in tho early
part of January."
RAG DISINFECTION.
Scheme to Have the Government
Adopt the Porter Process.
A tyll is to bs offered in the House by a Now
fork member prohibiting tho importation of
paper stock, Whioh Is not disinfected abroad of,

A PERILOUS BUSINESS.
sour White Men Drowned
Smuggling Chinamen.
While
A few days since it was reported at Victoria
B. C, that a throe-ton sloop which lolt there
with 9 Chinamen, who were to be smuggled
nnd two white men .for the American shorn linH
swamped, and nil hands were lost In addi
tion to this disaster, two more white men who
left Foul Bay ab jut seven weeks ago in a leaky
boat, with 12 Chinamen, for Washington
territory, havo not since been hoard of, and
nil are believed to have been drowned. The
temptation to go into smuggling Chinamen
across Hie border is very strong, as lor each
one mnaea me owners ot tlie boat receive gen
erally S25, a sum which well repays those who
make the venture, if they escape with their
lives, elude American customs ffioers, and
manage to return to Victoria to claim their
money from the agents.
Capital for the South,
About 100 gentlemen representing German
American citizens of the States of New York
and Pennsylvania, will roach Washington dur
ing the holidays, en route for the World's fair
at New Orleans. Thence they will send out
branoh parties to explore nnd report to their
people what advantages the Southern Stales
offer for the investment of capital. The party
will represent millions of dollars, and if they
find the Southern section availuble, they intend
to Introduoe their various schemes,
Live Stock and Dressed Beef.
At the meeting of railroad presidents in the
offioe of- Commissioner Fink, New York, ie
cently, it was decided to fix the rates on live
stock at iO cents per 100 pounds, and on dressed
best at 70 cents from Chicago to New York,
the change to go into effoot nt once. Tho
former rates were 20 and 32 cents respectively.
Judge Cooley, the arbitrator, decided tliHt
horeaftor dressed beef ratos are to bo 75 per
cent, greater than tho ratos for live stock.
Unlucky Balloon Voyage.
The balloon Eclipse, the largest ever con
structed in California, which is intended to
make a trip across the Rocky Mountains,
made a trial ascension recently in San Frnn
(iisco, but suddenly descended into Raccoon
Straits, 10 miles awny. The occupants and
the balloon were picked up by boats. The
owner intends taking tho balloon to the
World's Fair at New Orleans.
Overtaken by a Squall.
While eight or ten fishing sohooners wei-o
,ylng nt anchor off Digby, N. S., lately, a
iquttll from tho northwest suddenly struck
them with tremendous force. The vessels at
bnce raised their anchors, cut their trawls, and
Iran for the harbor. A schooner lost hor fore
mast and jibboom, and was onable to pick np
pne of hor dories containing two men, who
(svere consequently drowned.
AGAINST POLYGAMY.
The Text Pr the hep3rt of the rh
i'emm Ul4n
The report of tho Utah oom minion, quoted
in President Arthur's message, boars dute of
Nov. 18. The commissioners believe that
their system of registration was suceossftd in
pi-eventing polygamists from voting nt tho
elections of county olliceis on Aug. 4, mi l fr
n congressional dclegite on Nov. 4. Tiio
officers elected wero general y Mormons but
wore not, in fact, living in polvgamv. Mr.
C in, tlio delcgnc-elect, although a Mormon,
una never i.vea iu poiygimy. Ilio commis-
oilers slMe that. althoiUrh iho iaw his b-i-n '
successiuiiy administered in rospect to the tlis-frunchh-cment
of po ygamists, the eflVct Ot the
same nport the preaching and practice of
polygamy has not been to iniprovo tho tone of
the former or materially diminish tho 1 ltter.
i or a year or more alter tho effort to enforce
tho law was iniliatod, polvgamio teachings
irom the pulpit wero rarely Jieard, and there
were indications that ihe practice of polygamy
might bo expected to at leust decline in a
rntnsute; But diuii-g thb present year'
there appears to hmo been a polygumio
revival. The institution i boldly and dJli.mtly
defended, nnd commended by tho spirit tench
ers, and plural m irriago.i nro reported to have
increased in number. Reporfs Irom all coun
ties but six indicate that 198 males and 263
females have entered polygamy since the pas
sage of the Edmund's act. Three-fourths or
more of the Slormon adults, male or female,
have never entered into the polygamic relation,
yot every orthodox Mormon believes in polyg
amy ns a divino revelation. A considerable
portion of tha report Is dovotcd to a review of
the proceedings m theClawson polygamy trial,
which resulted in tho conviction of Clawson
and a sentence to four years' imprisonment.
The conimi-sioners th'nk it would be stranste
if the conviction of Clawson should not have a
restraining effect upon the young Mormons.
In the Clawson case, a well ns in that of Evans,
who was sentenced to 3 1-2 years' impris n
ment, conv:ction was only possible through
the testimony of the second wife-, which was
obtained With difhcully. Should tho Senate
amendments to the Edmund's net, now pond
ing in the House of Representuli ves, be passed,
they would greatly strengthen the hands both
of the commission and the courts.
Tho commissioners recommend that the
offices of auditor and treasurer be fi'led by ap
pointment. It is not unlikely, they remark,
that finally tho federal government will find it
- . t .. ... .
necessary to take into its own hands all civil
power in the territory.
It is also recommended that the various
county officers be nppointed by the Governor,
subject to a mnjoiily oto of the commission
for confirmation. Several changes in the
powers of o:urts and methods of obtaining
juries are suggested. Also, ptnnlties to bo im
posed upon women for entering into polygamy.
BELL TELEPHONE AHEAD.
Judge Wallace Makes a Decision
Against the Drawbaugh Patents.
In the United States circuit court at New
York Judge Wallace recently handed down a
decision in favor of tlio Ainorionn Boll Tele
phone Company in the suit brought against the
People's Telephone Company to enjoin tho use
by the latter of its apparatus. Tho suit, which
involved a larger amount of money than uny
previous suit in tho United Statoj courts, has
been pending for years. The People's Tele
phone Company represent the intoreslg of
Daniel Drawbaugh of Millstown, P.i., who
claimed that in 1860 and 1867 ho invented an
appliance by which sounds could be conveyed
from place to place by wire, nnd this invention
Sfflolir uSJSg T.y'ldVKK thetf venWon' 'WffilM
Prof. Bell lays claim to ai the original. Two
years ago tho People s Telephone Company
were enjoined from using their iust umcnt,
pending the result of the suit in tlio United
States circuit court. The amount involved in
the suit ng;rogatos about '10,000,000. In his
decis'on, Judge Wallace enters a final decree
making permanent the injunction already
granted, and tho Peoplo's Telephone Company
are prevented from using or disposing of tho
instruments manufactured by them that in any
way confliot with those made by Iho Bell Tele
phone Company under the patents granted by
Prof. Bell. In concluding his decision, Judge
Wallace say s : "Without regard to other fea
tures of the case it is sufficient to say that the
defence is not established and the doubt raised
is fatal thereto." The caso will be at on :e ap
pealed to the United States supreme court.

Department for a ravende cutter', and the re

Mr. Ingalli of Kansas, offered a resolution,
which was agreed to, instructing the commit
tee on publio land to :cpoit such legislation
as may be necessary to authorize tho Secretary
of the Interior to remove all fences illegally
constructed on the public domain of the United
States.
Another redoss was taken and at 1.35 tlie
President's message was received, nnd its
reading at onco piocOoded with.
The message was referred to a committee
and after suitable reference to the death of Mr.
Anthony of K. I., the Senate adioumed.
On reassembling, the chair laid bcloro tho
Senate the annual reports of the secretary of
the trcaniry,and the comptroller of the cur
rency ; also a report of the clork of tho court
of claims containing a statement of all judg
ments rendered by that court during Ihe pass
year. The chair also laid before the Senate, as
memorial, a ioint resolution ol the Vermont
Legislature, urging congressional action look
ing to national control of interstate com
merce. Mr. Vest, of Missouri, offered a resolution
ireeting an investication bv the committee on
Indian nffairs into all leases of lands in tlie
Indian territory lor grazing or other purposes
by the Indian tribes, the number of acres cm
braced in the lo ises, their terms and the per
sons or corporations beccmins the lessees:
Iso directing the committee to investigate all
tho circumstances under which the leases woie
made, the means used in obtaining the leases
referred to nnd whether the leases were
authorized by law. He said ho had information
that ovor 3,000,000 acres hud been leased, nnd
that these leases had been obtained by corrup
tion, fraud or violence. He would be pre
pared to cive the chairman of the committee
names, amounts nnd dates.
A debate on tlio subject of the leases ensued.
in which Messrs. Vest, D wes, Maxoy of
Texas, and Beck of Kentucky, took part. The
debato broadened into a general discussion of
ndian lands and sunnlies. Mr. Beck stnt.nir
that the government paid 40 a head for cattle
worth only '12.
Mr. Dawes ot Massachusetts, said vat these
leases ot Indian lands, whilo wrong, were no
by wire fences ot' thousands of acres of the
public lands of tha United States. Of one.
tract of 120,000 acres of Indian lands, ns many
as 85,000 wero in the absolute and oxclusivo
possession of outsiders, whose herds consumed
everything that grow on if, when the Indian
bureau had been obliged to advertise for be of to
support the Indians ou whose reservations those
herds were feeding. Ilud tho Indians used
the reservations for thomsol ves they could have
supported themselves. The evils consequent
on this leasing 1 tho Indians lands and the
fencing of the publio lands, Mr. Dawes contin
ued, imposed u grave duty on Congress. If
remedial action were not taken in time, tho
public domain would pass irrevocably Into the
possession ot largo 1-nd owners, lorcign and
nntive. Congress had power to clothe the ex
ecutive olhcoi-s of the government with ample
authority in the premises and should do so.
Mr. Confer ot Michigan hoped the resolu
tion would he sufficiently comprehensive to af
ford full protection to the Indians, and In or
der to afford time for preliminary examination
and consideration ho desired the matter to go
ovor lor one day. Tho matter wont ovor.
A bill was introduced by Mr. Hnwloy ot Con
necticut for the relief of the sufforcrs by the

death.
Mr. Vest's resolution oilling for an investi
gation into lea-oa made by Indian tribes of
lunds m the Indian territory was taken up. An
amendment offered by Mr. Conger of Michigan
was agreoJ to, including within the scope of
tho investigation leases ol lands in the Indian

HEALTH HINTS.
The best lung protectors are dry feet
and warm comfortable body clothing, no
exposures, and an abundance of sleep
and rest, aud no late suppers or dissipa
tion. Eating a small piece of soap at stated
intervals is recommended by a Berlin
physician as a better remedy for dyspep

& writer in the British Medical Journal

band of cork. Cut a clean cork in thin
slices and sew close together upon
a piece of ribbon or tape an inch wide.
It can be tied around the affected part
and worn at night.

At about 8 o'clock every night one of
the proctors, with lm attendant "bull

penalty for being out after dusk without
cap and gown is five shillings, and tho
practice is almost universal, a rich har

An additional five shillings is charged if
the offence is aggravated by smoking.
There are occasions of course when it is
impossible to avoid being "ptoctorized,"
but the student soon becomes accustomed
to certain signs which infallibly denote a
proctor's approach, and takes steps to
elude him. The following are the ordi

empty, a quick ana steauy tramp is
heard in the distance (this is most sus

his cap with a bow, ana inquires:

"Yes," says Jones.

'Will you please ca'l on Mr. Hunter

The National Festival of Wales.
The Eisteddfod is the great national
festival of Wales, which had the com
mencement of its history in the remote
past. It was established in the infancy
of civilization and knowledge in th
British Isles. The Eisteddfod has been
tho nursery of the bards and bardism in
Wales, and in the absence of any othei
educational facilities it was the instruc
tor of the people from time immemorial.
According to an old Welsh trial "the;,
are three artifices of poetry andrecoro
among the nation of theKymry : (Welsh)
Gwyddon Gauhobon, who first in tht
world invented vocal song; Hu th
Mighty, who first invented the means ol
recording and preserving vocal song; aud
Tydan, the Father of the Muse, who first
gave rules to vocal song and a system ol
recording;. From what these three men
effected, bards and bardism originated,
the dignities and customs pertaining t,
which were arranged systematical
by the three original bards, 'Plenydd,
Alon,' and 'Gwron.' Three ranks ol
orders constituted what was called Bar
das or Bardism: That of bard or poet,
that of Ovydd or philosopher, and that
of Druid or instructor. Tho motto ol
this institution was nnd is to this day.
"Y Gwir yn crbyn y byd" (The Truti
Against tho World), from which it wouli
appear that the Eisteddfod or Bardisrr
was instituted for the purposo of propag
ating truth.
Thy Eisteddfod was the fount of in
struction, moral and religious, at thi
time of tho ancient Druids. The vehicli
by which instruction, or, as it was prob
ably termed, "Truth," was propagated
was poetry. The Bard wrought tho phi.
losophy of tho Ovydd into sony, and th
Druid or instructor, who was also minis
ter of such religion as the Celtic Cymrj
possessed, communicated to his pupili
the result of tho Bard and Ovydd. Thi
Druidicul verses then probably constitute
tho most ancient poetry of Brituin.
