Th|E CHRISTMAS CALL.
rOR the celebration of the holidays, The Call
will on next Sunday issue its annual Christmas
number. It is well known that with each suc
ceeding year these editions improve, but this year
the improvement will be more notable than ever. The
Call of next Sunday will mark the highest attainment
of journalism and prove one of the brightest holiday
novelties of the year.
A portion of the paper will of course be taken up
with a review of the condition of our great industries
and a forecast of the future that awaits them. In
every case these will be written by experts, by men
who are identified with the industries they describe,
and who, therefore, write of them with the authority
acquired from long experience in their management.
The moral and the intellectual progress of the State
will be given as much attention as the material
progress. Two of the most notable articles of the
number will treat of the growth and the prospects of
our universities. President Kellogg will write of the
State University, and President Jordan of Stanford.
It is well known that these two Californian seats of
learning have brighter prospects than any other uni
versities in the Union. This is particularly true of
Berkeley, whose projected range of buildings has
become the center of interest to the architects of the
world, and whose future home promises to be the
stateliest ever erected for the uses of education and
the advancement of learning.
For the joy of the holidays there will be many
article? of a light and sparkling character. The num
ber will contain stories by such well known and
popular writers as Anthony Hope, Bret Harte, Oc
tave Thanet, John Strange Winter and Edward Ever
ett Hale. These stories are in the best style of their
respective authors, and will make the Christmas Call
welcome to all who like the fellowship of rousing ro
mance.
Throughout the number from first to last every fea
ture will be attractively illustrated in the best style of
modern journalistic art. The pictorial richness of the
edition will be, in fact, one of its notable excellences.
No branch of newspaper making has advanced so rap
idly of recent years as that of illustration, and the
Christmas Call, by its half-tones and other styles of
pictures, will show what modern art has accom
plished in that direction.
Finally, that no department of joyous art may be
lacking to the number. The Call will contain a
Christmas song, distinctively Californian, written by
Miss Ina Coolbrith, and set to music by Oscar Weil.
We can safely assert that this song, by reason of the
beauty of its words and the sweetness of its music,
will be one of the permanent contributions made to
Christmas minstrelsy this season. By itself alone it
will be sufficient to make this edition of The Call wel
come into every cultured home and a delight to every
artistic mind.
TO STOP FAKE FIGHTING.
TO the subject of "fake fighting" and how to stop
it the sporting editors of the land have been de
voting considerable space. There is only one
way, and it is simple.
Every prize-fight is a fake, every prize-fighter a
confidence-man. The event and the calling are alike
illegal. By stopping fights of every sort no mistake
can be made. Then the fighters, their occupations
gone, will quickly drift into the channels of life where
they can be definitely restrained. Most of them will
become vagrants and be easily suppressed. A few of
the more courageous will turn highwaymen or bur
glars, and in due time be within four walls. Here and
there one with some dormant element of decency in
him will go to work.
There is no room for discussion, since in favor of
the prize-ring, with its "Gentleman Jims" and its
Simian Sharkeys, its frauds and its skullduggery,
there is absolutely not a word to be said.
A murderer who had killed four people was recently
twice hanged owing to the breaking of the rope. Jus
tice was trying to get in its work, although in not
causing the rope to break twice more it fell short of
perfection.
The Salvation Army man who explains that he
beat a boy for the purpose of driving the devil out of
him seems to have mistaken the location of that
devil. It was probably under his own blouse.
While the School Directors are figuring out so
beautifully that that money is not missing, they would
add strength to their contentions by displaying the
cash.
OUR GREEK TRADE.
rOR the fiscal year 1896-97 we imported from
Greece as dutiable merchandise books, bicycle
cement, chemicals and dyes, clothing, earthen
ware, fish, currants, figs, raisins, fruits and nuts, al
monds, honey, iron ore, leather, marble, metal, musi
cal instruments, olive oil, paper, cheese, seeds, manu
factured clothing, laces, soap, brandy and spirits,
sponges, manufactures of straw, confectionery, still
wines, bottled wines, manufactures of wood, carpets
and wools — all to the value of $648,173, of which Zante
currants amounted to $574,892, the importation being
28.465,611 pounds. Of non-dutiable goods Greece
sent us art works, antiquities, gums, licorice root,
mineral water, chemicals, fruits, household effects,
ores, manganese, manufactures of zinc, oils and cliff
stone, all to the value of $84,529, making a total im
port trade from that country to this of $732,702.
During the same fiscal year we exported to Greece
books, medicines, clocks and watches, manufactures
of cotton, fish, glucose, cartridges, hides, firearms,
locks and hinges, machinery, stoves, manufactures of
iron, ditto of lead, leather, illuminating oil, tallow,
vegetables, and manufactures of wood, all amount
ing to $109,923, to which add re-export of foreign
merchandise amounting to $840, or a total export to
Greece of $110,763.
Therefore we imported from Greece $621,939 more
than we exported to her, leaving that balance against
us in the trade.
As our principal import was Zante currants, so our
principal export was petroleum, amounting to only
1,250,000 gallons, valued at $95,085.
In Greece the petroleum importation is a Govern
ment monopoly. The tariff on it was 50 drachmas on
100 okes. A drachma is 19.2 cents, or 100 lepta, and
an oke is 2.34 pints. A note in the Greek tariff of
1885 says that the petroleum tariff is 50 lepta per oke;
the duty, therefore, is 9.6 cents per 2.34 pints, or 32.8
cents per gallon. On our export of 1,250,000 gallons
the total duty collected by Greece was $410,000. The
duty collected by the United States on the 28,465,611
pounds of currants we imported amounted to $569,312,
a gain to us in duties of $159,312.
It is obvious from an inspection of these statistics
that whatever reciprocal arrangements are made with
Greece they will be for the benefit of our largest ex
port, petroleum, and of her largest, the Zante cur
rants.
It further appears that if duty is taken off Zante
currants, in such arrangement the interests of Califor
nia raisin-growers will be sacrificed to promote those
of the petroleum producers.
Inasmuch as the petroleum industry is highly or
ganized and is highly profitable, is not subject to the
accidents which beset horticulture, nor to the varia
tions in the market which affect vineyard products,
and is an article of necessity and therefore assured al
ways of a market, to sacrifice the California raisin for
its benefit is a proposition that should meet with the
most stubborn resistance.
As we have shown, the Zante currant is a raisin
made from a grape. Wherever it is admitted to a mar
ket it competes with every other kind of raisin. Its
disastrous competition, when it was free of duty, is
sorrowfully remembered in this State. The record of
those years is written in mortgages foreclosed, vine
yards abandoned and every form of financial distress
that can fall upon a horticultural community.
No such necessity, no such misfortune, has ever
fallen to the lot of the petroleum monopoly. It has
known no competition, no failure of market, no
abandonment of its plants.
The raisin industry here has struggled from the be
ginning. This year it has tasted a degree of pros
perity, but nothing more than to sustain and hold it
together until another crop is produced. If that crop
is to meet free Zantes in the market it will not pay the
cost of production.
In this emergency the authorities at Washington
must weigh the interests of the Standard Oil Com
pany against those of the raisin-growers of Califor
nia, and if the principles of commercial equity pre
vail, there ought to be no doubt of the result.
It is not exactly correct to represent that the Zante
currant import is competitive with a California cur
rant industry. Though there are in Placer County
paying vineyards of the Zante vine, and the Thompson
seedless grape is a similar fruit, yet the Zante import
competes with our raisins of all kinds as a kitchen or
cooking fruit.
The problem that has been before our raisin men is
the use of their product in cookery. Formerly the im
ported Valencia and Malaga raisins were a table
luxury, used as a dessert, and their use quite re
stricted and uncommon. The task of the California
raisin planters has been to put their product in the
kitchen, for use cooked, as a dried fruit that carries
all the wholesome food quality of the grape. In the
kitchen it has been met by the dirty Zante currant.
The latter has been considered in our tariff legislation
since 1816. The tariff of that year put on it a duty of
3 cents a pound; the tariff of 1832 made it free; of
1842, 3 cents a pound; 1846, 40 per cent ad valorem;
1866, 3 cents a pound; 1890, free; 1894, \ l / 2 cents a
pound; 1897, 2 cents a pound.
It was only between 1866 and 1890 that Zante cur
rants became a competing import, and their competi
tion became disastrous after the tariff of 1890. It will
be far more disastrous now if they are again made free,
for, no matter what the tariff may be on tbe large
raisins, the real rate of protection they enjoy is the
duty on Zante currants, their most formidable kitchen
competitor.
0N EXPERIMENT IN FORESTRY.
PRESIDENT McKINLEY in his message to
Congress announced that the Forestry Bureau
of the Department of Agriculture "is giving
special attention to the treeless area of the regions of
the country, and is introducing species especially
adapted to the semi-arid districts. Forest fires, which
seriously interfere with production, especially in the
irrigated regions, are being studied, that the losses
from this cause may be avoided."
This brief statement will have the effect of directing
public attention to what is being done by the Depart
ment of Agriculture for the preservation of our for
ests. The siibject is one of the most important that
confronts our lawmakers, either at Washington or at
Sacramento. Our forests are worth infinitely more
to us than the Philippines or all the islands put to
gether over which so much debate is going on.
One report that comes to us from the East of what
is being done by the Forestry Bureau is worth more
than a passing notice by reason of the promise it car
ries of future good. Early in October the Department
of Agriculture issued a proposal to forest owners that
they prepare a plan for harvesting the merchantable
timber on any given tract under the supervision of an
agent furnished by the department at the expense of
the Government, the only condition being that the
Government should have the privilege of publishing
the financial results for the benefit of other timber
owners.
It now appears that timber-land owners represent
ing 1,000,000 acres of land have filed applications for
Government supervision. In the report that comes
to us it is stated that 100,000 acres of the area arc in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1898.
the Adirondack region, but the location of the re
mainder is not given. This district is large enough to
make an experiment worth something, and the re
sults may be expected to be widely beneficial.
It is clear that if the experiments are to be made
only in the East, the benefits resulting from them will
be almost wholly for the East. The conditions of
Western forests are so widely different from those of
the Adirondack woods that results obtained by a cer
tain line of action in the one could not be counted on
from a similar line of action in the other.
It is to be hoped that California timber-land owners
will imitate those in the older States of the East and
profit by the offer made by the Government. An ex
periment of governmental supervision of 100,000
acres or more of forest land in this State and the
scientific harvesting of its merchantable timber would
be an object lesson in forestry that would be of great
value to the commonwealth.
MR. COLNON, REFORMER.
IN the last days of his term Harbor Commissioner
Colnon presents the most extraordinary reform
spectacle of the age. For four years he has wallowed
in water-front patronage. He has quartered his relatives
and friends upon the State in large numbers, and was
only prevented from converting the Harbor Commis
sion payroll into a directory of Stockton by the late
overwhelming Republican victory. Now, as he is
about to retire from office, he tells the Senate Inves
tigating Committee that patronage grubbing on the
water front is corrupting and should be stopped.
Doubtless if Mr. Colnon were cross-questioned with
reference to collusive contracts, skimped specifica
tions, deficient material, changes in plans designed to
enrich contractors, and the other devices by which
rascally officials rob the State in building ferry depots,
he would become equally as philosophic and reforma
tory. Doubtless he would declare with pain that such
things were fraudulent and disgusting, and that, like
the spoils system, they ought to be suppressed. But,
as in the other case, Mr. Colnon's philosophy comes
too late. After four years of spoils and fraud in
building ferry depots he suddenly awakes to a realiza
tion that-the system is wrong and subversive of econ
omy and integrity in the public service.
Harbor Commissioner Colnon should not in this
matter expect intelligent people to take him seriously.
If he does he is an altogether greener man than his
four years' record as private secretary to the Governor
and Harbor Commissioner would seem to indicate.
So long as the spoils system advantaged him he has
practiced it, but the moment he is about to retire
to private life, loaded down with ferry depot scandals
and a record of which a less respectable and intelligent
man ought to be ashamed, he suddenly reforms and
with loud acclaim joins the ranks of civil service re
formers and becomes a member of the church.
However, the people are not likely to fall into any
such trap as Mr. Colnon is setting for them. Four
years' acquaintance with him has satisfied them that
he is not a reformer, and cannot be. They will think
he is simply putting up a new job on them — appro
priating, as it were, the livery of heaven only to ap
pear later on with another office where, as a building
expert, he can take charge of another public edifice.
Mr. Colnon may think that in verdancy the people of
the State resemble those of Stockton, where for
years he has passed himself off as guide, reformer and
friend, but he is mistaken. No professions of re
form can now save him in their estimation from the
deep and impenetrable oblivion which ought to over
take every official who fails to faithfully discharge a
public trust.
CHICAGO'S THREATENED ANARCHY.
SOME observers of the threatened trouble in
Chicago, the feeling which has led citizens to
walk the streets carrying miniature nooses in
token of willingness to hang a lot of Aldermen, seem
to be unduly alarmed. Nor do they discern the point
at which reform should be inaugurated.
Said one: "All that is lacking to make Chicago the
Paris of the nineteenth century is a modern Mirabeau
or Robespierre."
There may be in this an inkling of truth. The pas
sions of the people have been wrought to fever pitch.
The rights of the public have been bartered, power
shamelessly betrayed, officials purchased as openly as
junk. It is no wonder that honest men say rogues
shall no longer rule unchecked. There will be no im
mediate, mighty revolution. The change must be
worked out in quieter and more effective fashion. Ex
pel the scoundrels from office, put politics into the
hands of decency, send bribe-takers and bribe-givers
to prison and stripes. In this is the solution.
Oddly enough, in counseling the citizens to calm
ness, statesmen do not seem to weigh the circum
stances which have perturbed the general mind. It
does not occur to them that there is a deep and gen
uine grievance; only that citizens are threatening to
reach a reckless extreme. It will not do in this
emergency to place all the blame upon these citizens.
They have been patient and long-suffering, but they
have been goaded to wrath, and it is a righteous
wrath. Concerning the policy of hanging a thieving
Alderman, it is unquestionably bad. The absolute
justice of it is another matter.
A wife whose husband had chased her with the
family carving knife appeared in the Police Court to
state smilingly that she had forgiven him, and was
surprised and grieved to find that the people of Cali
fornia, having been hurt in their peace and dignity,
had not forgiven him a bit. When a wife has not the
sense to protect herself, she should be grateful that
the law has more than she has.
A Kansas woman is in jail on the charge of having
poisoned her sixth husband. The merits of the case
are of course unknown here, and, while poison is a
little severe, there ought to be something done to any
man rash enough to marry a widow who has planted
five formers.
It is gratifying to observe that under its new man
agement of the Report the old trick of labeling the
first edition of the day "Fourth" has been discarded,
and thus that the third and last edition is no longer
marked "Sixth." But the other evening papers still
sin.
There can be no excuse for taking soldiers to Man
ila by way of the Suez canal save the greediness of the
East and its superior pull. As a matter of speed,
economy or health, the proposition is simply ridicu
lous, and the administration ought not to tolerate it.
Adjutant General Corbin could make another great
stroke by arranging for the Western troops to come
back from the tropics by way of New York. The pos
sibility that any of them may pass through San Fran
cisco causes great distress to the Eastern mind.
There need be no question as to whether the Cali
fornia soldiers returning from the Philippines will re
ceive a welcome. Won't the whole city be theirs?
Well!
There should be a law against the fool variety of
bicycle race.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
A talented newspaper woman of New
York writes to a talented newspaper
woman of Denver and asks: "What
do you intend to do about creating
public sentiment for purity of life?" It
must be remembered that the query
is addressed by one who has not the
blessed privilege of voting to one "who
has. The idea is, clearly, that the vot
ing woman has, in respect of the creat
ing of sentiment, an advantage over the
other. As to the regulation of morals
the ballot gives no additional power to
woman. Her influence must be exerted
through her individuality and im
pressed by the spotlessness of her own
life. If she votes to close the brothel,
two of her soiled sisters will vote to
keep it open. Let her be pure, upright,
teach her children modesty and honor.
Let her shut her door in the face of the
libertine. This is her privilege, her
duty and her only method of "creating
sentiment."

It is good news to lovers of animate
that the Royal Agricultural Society,
which gives the biggest horse show in
England, will hereafter grant no prizes
to horses exhibited with docked tails.
As horse 6hows in this country are imi
tations of those of the Royal Society
this benef ent ukase will doubtless
have wide effect, and result in visible
reform. The docking of a horse's tail
is cruel, unnatural, disfiguring and
idiotic. There is for it absolutely no
excuse. There is not a shadow of pal
liation for a crime so brutal worked
upon so fine an object as the horse. To
cut the equine ears close to the head
or to pluck out the eyes would be as
sensible and in the view of Cod and of
thinking men as forgivable. When I
see a noble horse, comeliness and
strength in every limb, beauty in every
curve, yet marred t" having in place
of a tail a miserable stub and futile
wisp fastened so as to point skyward
I confess my blood boils. A horse's tail
is one of its chief ornaments, as well as
a protection against flies and similar
pests. The process of removing it is
shocking, the effect inartistic and crea
tive of disgust. If I had my way every
man conniving at the outrage would
go to jail for a year.

I learn, with surprise, from the
Mecca, published at Denver, that Hon.
Samuel M. Shortridge was recently
elected to the Senate of this State. It
is a duty to inform Editor Clara Foltz
of the paper mentioned that the man

ever, as they are brothers, it is not
strange that so far away as Colorado
their identities should have become
mixed.

A gentleman named Fisher, a news
paper man, favorably known, recently
died after having made several absurd
requests as to the disposition of his
body. I was glad to notice that the
requests were disregarded. A dying
man has a right to the tender minis
trations of those who know that in time
they must, as he is doing, pass to an
other world. But a dead man has no
rights, beyond a decent respect, and
certainly any demand he may have
made upon the living to ignore existing
conventions and subject themselves to
remark or ridicule is so unreasonable
that with clear conscience it may be
thrust aside. Mr. Fisher did not want
a casket nor a hearse. He got both,
and by providing them relatives
showed that they had for the deceased
a more genuine consideration than
would have been demonstrated through
abiding by his whimsical dictates.

The youngest child of the late Jay
Gould has come into possession of his
share of the estate. That is to say,
he has come as nearly into possession of
it as his father allows. To be sure,
Jay Gould is dead and turned to dust,
but the skeleton fingers still keep a
clutch upon the millions they heaped
up before the great financier was
called. I do not believe that the prin
ciple involved in this is right nor wise.
If every man who by shrewdness or theft
gains a great fortune has the right to
regulate it to the end of time, there is
only a question of years as to when the
greatest thief or the shrewdest finan»
cie» shall have all the earth and rule
it from his moss-grown tomb. I re
joice in the spectacle of segregated mil
lions being scattered. I would like to
see every abnormal hoard cast to the
winds. In my estimation such for
tunes as that of a Gould, a Rockefeller
or a Sage have no warrant for exist
ence, constitute a menace to our insti
tutions, and the sooner dissipated the
better.

Writing in the Critique, a little sheet
published at the national capital, a
wise man says, and ■with a fine show
or scorn, that newspapers are run for
money. Observation forces me to a
similar conclusion. Not only are
newspapers run for money, but so is
everything else that is run. I suspect
railroads, factories, banks and farms.
Even the office-seeker has not always
in view the lofty purpose of elevating
the nation. At least, if there were no
salary attached, he would leave the
task of elevation to somebody else.
The preacher expounds texts for
money, and when the money be not
forthcoming, the text will remain un
expounded and dust gather on the pul
pit cushion." This is not said by way of
reproach. Things are so ordered that
money is a necessity. The fact is so
generally recognized, that the acquiring
of money through honest effort is not
regarded as a crime, save by those too
lazy to work. There is no apparent
reason why a newspaper should not be
subject to the general ambition. Its
proprietor has to pay for paper, news
and presses. He has to pay erood
wages to printers and other craftsmen.
He has been known to pay writers, but
rarely, rarely. Money means bread
and clothes and shelter. The money
for which newspapers are run means
all this to an army of employes. So
they ought to be permitted to run.

From time to time it has been a
pleasure to say a word of the Muser of
the Visalia Delta, a person identical
with the lyre of the same paper. In
which of his roles he is the more com
plete example of riotous imbecility I am
unable to decide, and consideration of
the question accounts for a lack of
mention recently of him or his works.
Once I treated him seriously, for his
hebetude is so apparent that I sup
posed he was a wise man in disguise, on
display for the sake of a joke. But
he takes himself in the same manner,
which is an offense. I wrote last week,
I hope with a proper respect, of the
resting place of the dead, venturing the
assertion that it should be away from
By HENRY JAMES
the haunts of trade and the careless
footfall of the throng. After quoting
briefly, this queer creature comments:
"I am surprised that Mr. James dis
plays so much feeling in discussing
this subject. After reading some of
his criticisms I had been led to believe
he was devoid of sentiment. Is it
possible I have been mistaken?" Yes,
it is possible. You were never any
thing else. Because a man in passing
judgment on a daily discharge of
verse so crude that It might be the
work of -a pupil in a school for feeble
minded fails to discover beauty there,
for the sufficient reason that no beauty
is there, no sense nor rhythm, reason nor
excuse, is not ground for supposing him
lacking in sentiment. It may be that
he is merely refraining from being a
fool. I confess to a feeling of senti
ment toward the ordinary dead, but
not toward the Muser. Where he shall
be buried, or when, makes not a par
ticle of difference.

Tesla has now so far perfected a mys

this is the advance stage of any of
Tesla's schemes.

W. A. Brandes, the father accused of
the murder of his little daughter, has
only been in jail a few days, and yet
he has professed religion. The fervor
with which he prays is said to be a
caution to sinners. Far be it from me
to decry religion, which has taken a
strong hold upon humanity and lifted
many a mortal to a new life, a better
ambition and. a sacred hope. But it
seems to me the good there is in it is
sadly weighted by the readiness with
which a Brandes reaches to it for a
comfort he does not deserve, and a
solace merited only by the upright, the
pure In heart and the penitent. With
out any desire to prejudice a prospec
tive juryman, I am obliged to hold the
opinion that Brandes beat his daugh
ter to death, and holding it, can with
clear conscience, express it. If he did
so, what he needs is not the attitude
of humility, the voice of regret, but
hanging. Leaving out the fact that his
own blood was in the veins of the vic
tim, the man who will maltreat a child
is not fit to live. There was a case
in Colorado some years ago wherein a
girl was beaten and abused to death by
a man and a woman. When the people
ascertained the truth, they took the
pair and lynched them. As a citizen of
Colorado then I thought they did exact
ly the proper thing, and throughout
the State I do not remember that there
was a voice of dissent.

be added that Becker at the time of the

When will the East arise to reali

the Chinese of San Francisco live in
defiance of moral law or written code,
that they are beyond the reach of au
thority. The Chinese here maintain a
system of slavery. Under it women
are bought, sold, held as chattels. In
maintenance of this iniquitous system
money is freely spent, conscienceless
lawyers retained, perjury committed,
murder done. Courts seem to be power
less. This is a large country, with
room for many people, but were it a

The society editor has a grievance.
She calls for sympathy, and not in
vain. It seems that she has at hand
a list of adjectives which it is her
pleasing wont to apply to brides. They
are lovely or charming or chic. They
have eyes dark as night or blue and
bright as the heavens. By judicious
selection among these adjectives she
had been enabled, in the past to give
each bride a proper send-off. She had
come to regard the qualifying words
as her own and once deprived of them
could no more write up a wedding than
a legless man could sprint. The griev
ance is that the everyday reporter, the
man who portrays murders and makes
a specialty of the homicidal young
woman, has coolly swiped these adjec
tives. His petticoated assassin is in
appearance the things a bride ought to
be, and that a bride would be if left to the
society artist. I suggest that the style
might be changed. For instance it
might be: "The bride had the air of a
woman just about to commit murder
and in her eyes, cerulean, fathomless,
there gleamed as beauteous a glow as
could light the optics of the fairest
maid or matron who ever butchered a
surprised and helpless man." Unless
something of this sort can be done, the
fashionable wedding will have to be
treated in the cold and formal marriage
announcements.

The coming back of McGlade was a
triumph. He had run away to avoid
going to jail, been captured and landed
in a cell. The officer who convoyed
him pronounced the prisoner "a perfect
gentleman." The friends who Avel
comed him gave him assurance that he
had nothing to fear. The human heart
is kind, and McGlade had been accused
of nothing worse than stealing, the ac
cusation being backed by indubitable
proof.

While the people behind various
Senatorial candidates of the north are
bickering, the people' behind Grant are
sawing wood. lam neither politician
nor prophet, but to the extent of a
modest pile am willing to wager that
the south will bear away the Senator
ship as calmly as it did the Governor
ship. While others were dreaming
they were organizing their fight down
there, and while others are or
ganizing they have their hosts mar
shaled. Burns has no real strength,
because he is known. Some others
might have strength If only they were
known. Grant sees the advantage,
and coming into the contest under the
prestige of an honorable name, is go
ing to put up a race which will leave
the competition winded, and either in
the rear or winner by a nose.

The Providence which led Baldwin to
safety while his betters were being
roasted but shows again that "God
moves in a mysterious way his wonders
to perform." Nor does the undeserved
consideration 1 • Providence fail of hu
man imitation. Here is a man who
erected a death-trap, and who when
after inexplicable delay th"* trap is
sprung defies the authorities to remove
the wreck, quibbles with his workmen
as to the price at which they shall risk
their lives, and seems to have no
thought of the unshriven dead in the
debris of the sepulcher he builded for
them. There is not another city in the
United States in which such dangerous
walls as the Baldwin fire icft would
not have been level with the pavement
forty-eight hours after the tines had
been withdrawn. They stayed up sim
ply because Baldwin, who should not
have been so much as consulted, de
sired that they should stay. As they
rocked and tottered, shedding bricks
and metal, he had rescuers looking for
blistered washstands and cracked pots.
Probably on some lucky days he saved
as much as $11 worth of trash. This
city does not owe Baldwin anything.
For years his very presence has been
a blemish and a reproach. Morally
noisome, socially ostracized, financially
the bete noir of collectors, I do not see
why at thi time, when his personality
should have been swept aside, he has
been allowed to take command. The un
claimed dead within the Baldwin walls
have at least the right to respectful
deference. It is not pleasing that they
should lie and rot to suit the whim of a
querulous and grasping old man.
