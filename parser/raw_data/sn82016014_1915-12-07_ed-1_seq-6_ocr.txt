; Attorney Sr.nwden M.-tr.-h:ill declared
; today that Frani Von Kintelen, the
. Herman ajient, who is accused of com-
Ing to this county to incite Btrikers
; In munition factories, armed with a
Jar ere corruption fund, was "double
grossed" by the iabor men he tried to
" corrupt and despite the expenditure
f several hundred thousand dollars,
: failed to accomplish his mission in any
effective manner- Mr. Marshall Rave
the major credit for IUntelen's fail
ure to the stand taken by high of
ficials in labor organizations.
l "Kintelen only succeeded in cor
rupting some subordinates," Mr. Mar
r shall said, "and he was beautifully
i double crossed. The real labor lead
" ers took prompt steps to check activi
ties. Save for a few small strikes,
: nor.e of his efforts was successful and
. all the strikes he did instigate were
quickly killed by the good men at the
i head of unions. I am not prepared
;to state just how much money Kin
; telen expended but it ran into hun
' dreds of thousands of dollars. Me had
I $500,000 to his credit in one bank."
Mr. Marshall refused to comment
;on David Lamar's activities in the
, scheme beyond saying emphatically
: that he would not be called as a wit
ness before the grand jury a pro
; ceeding which might give him im
- tnunity from prosecution. If suffi
cient evidence is obtained it is ex
.pected indictment will be sought
gainst the labor men who accepted
1 Itintelen's money. Mr. Marshall stat
ed that these men could be prosecut
ed under the Sherman lav on the
ground they had conspired to restrain
the trade of the United States in mu
nitions. Rintelen is at present held a prison
er by the Ilritish authorities in the
Tower of London. No attempt will
be made to extradict him as Mr. Mar
shall says his offense is not extradita
ble. Samuel Gompers, the lubor leader,
who has made statements in public
that he knew strikes were being en
gineered by agents of a foreign pow
er, may appear before the grand jury
here. The arraignment of I'.obert Fay,

New Orleans, Dec. 7. Dr. Bradford

clared the one-crop system as "un
safe and unsound, and the marvel is
that the south has come thus far with

The southern farmers, m? asserted,
have not become rich and prosperous
because the system has been against

jW. J. B30FENS UP
Nebraskan to Fight Lynch as
I McCombs's Successor.
bers of that body have been Inter
ested mainly hi the bomb which Mr.
Bryan left behind him here.
The Nebraskan was mightily inter
ested in the story of the covert move
against Chairman McComba made by
the administration' forces. Hut his
interest centered rather more on the
possibility of Committeeman Fred
Lynch, of Minnesota, gettins power
than upon McComba losing it. In
fact, Mr. Bryan's interest was so in
tense that he authorized a -national
committeeman to announce that if
Mr. Lynch were made chairman he
would denounce that action publicly
and fight the selection with every
weapon at his command.
A Warning to AH.
The Bryan threat is the more sig
nificant in that it not merely applies
to any action at- the present commit
tee meeting but to any future promo
tion of Mr. Lynch to the chairman
ship. It is a warning not only to the
national committee but to the possible
nominee of the 1916 convention that
a campaign managed by Lynch will
be a campaign fought against the
Bryan opposition.
This is the more embarrassing to
the Wilson forces, because they have
already entrusted to Air. Lynch certain
political functions usually reserved for
the chairman of the committee. He i
understood to have begun collecting
funds in New York already. And Mr.
I Lynch is a good collector. In fact, it
is upon the nature of his collections
that the Bryan hostility, which is an
cient, is based.
Too Close to Hill.
Mr. Lynch is accused of being too
much allied with James J. Hill to be a
real Democrat of the Bryan stripe and
the nature of the contributions he re
ceived in the 1008 campaign are cited
as his influence with the money power
and the great corporations. Although
the Bryan influence is not strong
within the committee, its members
fear the effect of any such denuncia
tion by him of a man selected by the
president to run the campaign.
MAD DOG SCARE
Commissioner Porter Makes Wild
llusli to East side in Answer to
a Telephone Call.
The telephone rang in Commission
er W. L. Porter's office this morning
and that official turned to it. He
listened attentively then hung up the
receiver with a bang.
"Mad dog at 313 Branner street,"
he exclaimed.
Turning to Clyde Tresner as he
hunted his overcoat and gloves, he
shouted:
"Get somebody and come, Clyde.
There's another mad dog; down on
the East side."
Three men hurried downstairs and
out to Commissioner Porter's Ford.
The motor ' was cold and it had to be
cranked four'tiraes in three blocks.
Porter had visions of a wild-eyed ani
mal rushing through the East side im
planting microbes in innocent by
standers at every corner. He crouch

Fourth street.
Things seemed to bo unnaturally
quiet on the Fast side. There were
no persons in trees nor on roofs. Even
at 313 Branner there was no sign of
excitement. Commissioner Porter
rushed through the sate and into the
back yard.
"Where's the mad dog?" he de
manded of a woman at the back door.
"Out there in a. crate," was the
reply.
And there in a big crate was a mite
of a white dog. Besides being crated
he was tied with a rope. Out of the
tangle he looked at Commissioner
Porter with a friendly eye and as best
he could wagged his tail. Porter lifted
the crate and disentangled the rope.
The little dog frisked about his feet
and made friends with him instantly.
He didn't look like a mad dog and
didn't act like one. so Porter carried
him out to the car and brought him
to the city building to protect him
from further slander.

John Madden Says Trouble Will Re

Parsons is in an awful mess con
cerning her municipal politics, accord
ing to John Madden, Jr., a Parsons
lawyer. The recent crusade against
city officials of Parsons lias aroused
the town, he says, and there is a
dandy political row in view as a re
sult of the mix-up.
"If things are not ironed out, La
bette county will elect more Democrats
to office next year than at any time
in the history of the county," Madden
told the state house friends today. "I
am a staunch Republican, but there
Isn't any use of dodging the facts.
The recent troubles down there have
certainly stirred up the local leaders
and either side that is beaten in the
primaries will carry its fight to the
general election."

Kan., today pleaded guilty in the dis
trict court to robbing the Chautauqua
(Kansas) State bank of S00. He was
given a sentence of from 10 to 20
years in the penitenti. ry. The bank
was robbed the afternoon of Novem
ber 10. Three men in an automobile
drove up in front of the building and
went inside.. Securing the attention of
Cashier Burns for a rment by a
story that their motor had become dis
abled the men covered the bank offi
cial with revolvers and escaped with
all the currency in sight. A running
fight with citizens followed. During
the battle the robbers were forced to
abandon their machine. The police
received their first intimation that
Wildes was involved when receipts for
bills made out in the doctor's name
were found in the bottom of the car.
Wildes fled to California where he was
arrested. He said in court today he
had two accomplices but was unable
to tell who they were.
Wichita, Kan., Dec. 7. Dr. C. R.

in the federal court here for selling
narcotics contrary to law. He recently
had purchased a ranch near Las Ani

voung sons are living on the ranch at
Hazen in Baca county, Colorado.
CITY RESTS SECURE
Commission Is Confident That tlie
Sixth Avenue Viaduct Will Be
Restored by May 1.
City officials are resting easy with
reference to the Bast Sixth street via
duct matter. They are confident that
by the first of May the viaduct will
again be in condition to be used by
street cars and vehicles. The Topeka
Street Railway company, the Santa Fe
and the Missouri Pacific Railway com
panies have agreed to repair the struc
ture and are having the plans made
to that end. When they are completed
they will be submitted to the city com
mission for its approval and work will
then begin.
The Topeka Ra'ilway company Is
particularly anxious to have the work
done. It is having to transfer its
Oakland passengers by automobile
while the viaduct is out of commis
sion. And this company appears to
have more Influence with the two
railway companies than has the city
commission.
REMEMBER SHUT-INS
'Servant in the House" Will Be Given
fridny Night for Their Benefit
by C. E. Societies.
The Topeka local union of Christian
Endeavor societies in offering the
"Servant in the House'' at the Auditor
ium Friday night is not only giving
Topekans an exceptional entertain
ment, but every person who buy a
ticket will have extended to him an
opportunity of sharing in brightening
the Christmas day of a shut-in.
The Thanksgiving day program of
the Union for years has included the
distribution of flowers amongs those
who are confined to their homes
through sickness or other causes. This
year the regular plans could not be
carried out through lack of funds.
From the receipts of the play Friday
night, it is expected that the fund for
the purchase of flowers will be swelled
sufficiently to make possible a visit
at the home of every shut-in.
The original company will present
the play and only because Friday night
was an open date was it possioie lor
the local union to bring the cast here
at prices far below those charged reg
ularly. Tickets may oe reservea at j.

Commissioner rorter Xanies Assist
ants In the Sanitary Department
to Work Without I'ay.
As an experiment. Commissioner W.
L. Porter has appointed two women
as sanitary police orticers. l ney are
Miss Lorena Shantz and Miss Mary
Grover, both of whom took the civil
service examination held Monday.
They were sworn in Monday evening
after it was round mai iney naa

At present the women will work
without pay. But in event the experi
ment proves successful at least one of
them will be employed on a salary.
She will be placed under the direction
of Dr. H. B. Wood, city health officer,
and will have charge of all sanitary
inspection. She will inspect all cases
of contagious diseases reported and

FOR GERMAN POLICY
Teutonic Paper Says at Conclusion of
Peace It Must lie In
Their Favor.
London, Dec. 7. Telegraphing from
Amsterdam the correspondent of Bea
ter's Telegram company says:
"George Bernhard in the Vossische
Zeitung, anticipating peace discussions
in the reichstag. writes:
" 'The main and whole point Is that
we in the eventual conclusion of peace
shall find an outlet for our interna
tional policy which shall allow us to
pursue our clear goals with the least
friction and risk.
" The aim of this policy can only
be in the interest of the German peo
ple and the German empire.
The wish to liberate other peoples
can only be satisfied if thereby the
military security of the empire and
the peaceful development of til -3 peo
ple are not interfered with.
" 'Our future attitude toward the
enemy or toward neutral neoples can
not be determined by sentiment, but
only by cool consideration as to what
attitude toward future problems
would be Lest for us."
THEY SHOULD WORRY
Steel Men Pay Ittle Attention to Wil
son's Mention of 25 Cent
Steel Tax.
New Tork, Dec. 7. The suggestion
of President Wilson in his annual
message to congress today that pig
iron and finished steel be taxed 25
cents a ton, does not appear to worry
steel manufacturers here. They fig
ure it was stated in their behalf to
day, that even if the tax is enforced
it will mean little as compared with
present enormous profits. Besides
some persons who have considered
the subject do not believe such a tax
can be made lawful.
In figuring on the returns from the
tax it was pointed out that the United
States is today turning out pig iron
at the rate of 38,000,0.00 tons annually
and of finished forms about 34,000,000
tons. The proposed tax, based on this
production, would mean a total reve
nue of ?1S, 000,000 for the government.
