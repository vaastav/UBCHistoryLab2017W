EXPAINED BY CAPRIV!
The Commercial Treaties Negotiated
by Germany Come Up for
Discussion.
Trade With the United States
Under the Most Favored
Nation Treaty.
Opinions of the English Newspapers on
the IPrelident's Message--They Dif.
for Among Themselves.
BESLIN, Dec. 10,-In the rolebetag to-day
Chancellor von Captivi opened debate on
the new commercial treaties, making a
strong appeal for their adoption. He dwelt
upon the fact that present import and ex
port relations would rain both employers
and employes. The measures under
disoussion were necessary to pre
serve Germany's husbandry and com
merce. Continuing, the chancellor said
the immediate effect of the treat'ee
upon the finances of the empire would be a
diminuation of revenue nearly 18,000.000
marks, This was a matter that required
budget consideration. Speaking on the
question of differential treatment of
countries not included in the
treaties, he said it was need
less to speak of Russia. Lamentable
distress in that country could not be re
moved for some time. and it would be use
less to discuss what would be done after
ward. As regards the United States, the?
two governments decided to continue on
the basis of arrangements of 1885, whereby
the Uniteh States received tlo most favored
nation treatment. In connrmtion with al
leged distress in Germany, he s4mi the agri
culture of the country could very all bear,
without risk, reduction in the tari rate to
one and one-half marks. In the ma er of
wine, it had been the aim to compel rrp
competition inst artificial we
schnapps and d-lled "French claret
so as to provide 'o German soil a bett
field for Italian wi against those or
France. Rednuetio in e duties on the
necessaries of life was advantage to
working people. Adver g to the
McKinley law, the ohs ellor Said:
"We wish the con iel of
Europe to preserve their in pen sues
against America. For this pur so they
must unite together. The treaties at cqn
eluded will' give a sure gus tee At1g
future."
Herr Von Kanitz,conservae p ed
the chancellor's policy. He re. fed t

ESTIMATES OF THIE MIESSAGE.
Comment of the English Press oh the
Document.
LONDON, Dec. 10.-Commenting upon the
president's message the Post notices with
satisfaction the absence of any signs of
bluster toward the foreign nations and says
if the message meets with the ideas of the
president's party, Blaine's ohances are
diminished.
The Daily News says: "The president's
message leavees nothing to be desired either
in tone or temper. Harrison is less exasper
ating than Blaine and consequently is more
statesmanlike. He would not speak so ten
derly of reciprocity if his protection were a
a success."
The Standard says: "Harrison's message
is noticeable for its large devotion to foreign
I affairs. This showing is due to Blaine's
activity. The president gliaes with cue.
tomary bland optimisms over several mat
ters hardly doing credit to the American
diplomatists. It must be admitted that the
figures he quotes although justifying the
sanguine hopes of the McKinley law are
sufficient to cause some surprise to adverse
critics both at home and abroad."
"The Gazette says: "The most important
point in the document is that part which
has reference to the result of the McKinley
tariff. The figures presented compare sig
nificantly with the British figures, which
remain stationary calculations. The sup
porters of the McKinley bill are working
out much better than any one in England
had reason to expe:t."
The Globe sarcastically comments on the
message, which, it says, is adroitly traced
on the catch vote lines. The nervous Yan
kees are assured that the government
knows how to climb down, as in the case of
the Chili and the Bering sea dispute. Lord
Salisbury, the Globe adds, need not be
much frightened at President Harrison's r
tremendous menace, and the espression of
concern at the foreign eneronchments upon
territories controlled by the American gov
ernment. The Globe disputes the state
ment iuade in the message that the pros.
perity of the United States is entirely due
to the McKinley bill. On the contrary, it
says, the prosperity of the country is due to I
exceptional harvest here at a time when
Europe is short of grain.
Tile Feeling in Chill.
VALPARnISeo, Dec. 10.-The substance of
President Harrison's statement of the Chil
ian affairs was received to-day and is the
subject of much universal comment. It is
regarded by the Chiliane as decidedly
threatening a rupture and it is.not believed
that the Chilian government will consent
either to apologize or to 1 ay an indemnity.
The majority in congress is known
to be. opposed to any conces
sions, and the Chilian govern
ment would find it difficult to carry
the necessary support for any humiliating d
mieasures. It is now no secret that the gov
ernment is proceeding actively with war
like preparations and artillery of the lat
est manufacturt--s been ordered from
Germtn. '`ilt't ation is complicated by
Sdemand for a large indemnity.
Ohe Chilians have always detested the d
Spaniards, and the hatred is quickened by
this demand. They would challenge
in a second if they did not habv 0a big O
contract on theirm hands in teit. ase;l.
whippingf a nzln that has nW.vi b -een :

is dlAtlinctly opposed to ean aýlpt to draw
FrBine and itusiint l inih alliance. He.
can discover no comuml0s bond of union be
tween the nost.,~e.llghtened people of
Europe and aeoountry almost eastern in its
barbarity, The prevalent idea in France is
that th4ls alianoe will enable her to resin t
her lost provinces, while she will help inn- n
ea lay hands on Constantinople. But C
while Rvsaei will seize every opoertunity rI
of increasing her empire she would not em- p
broil herself with Europe in order to please n
France, and, when 4a10loled, would repudl- ii
ate any claim the latter power might have
on her. In his dpinion the most natural
and profitable alliance for France would
be with England.
Blames Bar Mother.
LorDoo, Deo, 10,-The trial suit of Miss
Florence St. John against her husband con
tinued to-day. The interest in that case
shows no abatement in theatrical ofrcles.
Marinus was again on the stand. Witness
admitted that once after a quarrel with his
wife he tried to force his way out of the
door threatening to leave the house. He
pushed her and she fell on the floor strik
ing the table. Miss St. John afterwards
left the honuse and refused to live with him.
The year following her separation from him
he became acquainted with the actress,
Marie Luella. Marias denies that he had
his wife watched. He said tia first wife was
divorced from him on the grounds of adul
tery and desertion. Marius declared that
itf it were not for Miss St. John's mother
and brother he and his wife could live hap
pily together.
Dropped Out of the Sky.
BaMnAy, Dec. 10.-Lieutenant Mansfield,
who gained quite a reputation by thrilling
paraclute descents from great heights, met
a torrible death here to-day. Only n short
time ago he made a descent ofr ,000 feet
safely. To-day an enormous crowd gath
ered at Victoria garden to watch him repeat
the feat. When the balloon had reached a
height of about 400 feet it burst and imme'
diately began to fall to the earth. Mans
field could not dis ngago his parachute as
it was entangled in rope. He came to the
ground with awful force and was instantly
killed, his body being mangled in a terrible
manner.

HIGH PRAISE.
What Ingersoll Cosaldered the Compll
ment of His Life.
The writer once asked Col. Ingersoll what
was the greatest compliment he ever re
ceived. He thought a moment and said:
"I will tell you. I was strolling about tire
lobby of the Grand Pacific hotel in Chicago
one evening after supper smoking a cigar
and waiting for some friends with whom
I was going to stend the evening. I saw a
vacant chair and eat down in it. Presently
I was accosted by a man sitting near who
was trying to smoke.
"'I noticed that he was crying. He said:
'Stranger, did you over read that?' pointing
to a poster dix feet long and three and one
half wide hangiing against the wall of the
Grand Pacifl office, giving the dream or
vision portion of my speecn at the soldiers'
reunion at Indianapolis only a short time
before.
"'Yes,' I replied, 'I have read it.'
"The fellow sobbed away a few mo
ments longer and continued:
"'StraUger, do you know what I think?'
" 'No; what do you think?'
"Well, sir, I have a copy of that bill hang,

every man that conies in read it, and f tell

From information, official and unofficial,
in regard to the administration of the laws
of Alaska, the attorney generalis impressed
that such administration is not satisfactory,
and that it can only be made satisfactory
by new legislation. The attorney general
called attention to the evils of the fees sys
tem, and advises as a substitute stimulated
salaries in all cases.
He reviews the legal proceedings in the
case of the Chilian steamer. Itata, and
sums up as follows: "Upon the trial of
this indictment it was held by the district
court that these proceedings were iot in
violation of the neutrality laws of the
UnitedStata,'sfirst, because the enterprise
was a legitimate commercial transuation;
second, because the congressioial party of
Chili, not having at the time received rec
ognition from the government of the
United States either as a government de
jure, or as belligerents, acts done by repre
sentativet and in the interest of a party, in
a way hostile against the Chilian govern
menet, were not in violation of the statutes
of the United States. In short, only in the
interest of a government recognized as such
de jure, or as belligerents, that the nou
tratity statutes of the United States can be
vinlnLneil."
"'Without discussing the proposition that
such a transaction was legitimate com
merce, I venture the snagestion that in the
case of serious injury, commercial or other
wise, to the interests of a nation with
which we are at peace, by ships fitted out
in our harbor, the plea of such non-recog
nition would be a very insufficient answer.
If the construction given these statutes by
the trial court shall be sustained on appeal
the statutes should, I think, be amended."
He reports five suits commenced under
the act of August, 1888, requiring all tele
graph lines subsidized by the government,
by and through their own respective corpor
ate officers and employes, to maintain and
operate for railroad, governmental and
commercial all other purposes. such tole
graph lines, and requiring the attorney
general by proper proceedinas to prevent
any unlawful interference with the rights
end equities of the United States in
relation to such telegraph lines.. On
this subject the attorney general says:
in the suits of the United States against
the Central Pacifl Itailroad company and
the Western Union Telegraph company;
against the Southern I'acilti Hailroad com
p:ny and toe Western Union Telegraph
cdmpany, both pending in the northern
district of California, -pending upon de
murrers and motions to dismiss for want

other w ords, they were not inhabitants
of any district except the district in the
state by which they were created." Touch
ing the question of jurisdiction raised by
thoselorporationnot residuntsof California
the attorney-general says the result of such
contention is that a corporation like the
Western Union Telegraph compainy, a New
York corporation which is doing business
in overy state and district in the union,
whlch has the right to sue in the federal
courts of the various distrilta, and if sued
in a state court they move such suits for
litigation in the federal courts, cannot tba
sued in the federal courts in any state out
side of New York. It is not believed that
such is the law, at least whore the govern
ment is plaintiff. Certainly it was not the
intentlon of congress in enactinll the jurli
clary law of 188. to thus make corpora
tions a privileged class.
"I recoummend that section 1 of the not of
August, 1888, (5r Revised ttat.. , 4:p 11,) be
aelnllded by inserting the proviso initials,
after tile word 'irnabnitlrnt,' the following
nentellce, inidely, 'Aid no civil suit shall
be brought before elther of said coulte
against any pwseon by an individual pro
ases, or proceeding in other district than
that wherein he is an inhabitant, provided,
that any foreign corporation may be sued
in any district witore it may be found, pro.
cesa to be served as in like case in the state
where said suit or actison is to be brought,'
uCllsh alendment would restore the law to
what it was for a century prior to the naet
of March 8, 187, and would impose on
these corporations liability to be sued ca.
responding to the right they enjoy to sue
as plaintiffs and to remove suits in which
they are defendants.
HIS IDEA OF REVISION.

Tetrlif;
WAHsIINorrO, Dec. 10.--Mr. Hpringor, who
is likely to be chairman of the ways and
means committee if Mills is offered and
declines the honor, said to-day tlht his
policy with eference to the tariff was to
provide for'free wool;-free Halt, free laurn
ber, free botton ties, frle coal, and free
binding t*ine. He said: "] do not think
we should :attempt a general revision of
the tariff at this time. We should offer the
country relief by passing bills for putting
the articles flamed on the flee list and
sending them to the sRnate. A general
tariff bill cannot be anncte4 into law, and
would keep eongreea here until. October. I
think there should be appointed a strong

The Harvest Boontiful and Prices Above
the Averageo.
WAtuInaToN, Dec. 10.-The report of the
department of agriculture gives the condi
tion of growing wheat as 85.3. Rieturns
showing the condition of coming crops of
winter grains are not generally favorable.
On the Atlantic coast some injury is re
ported on early sown areas from the Hes
sian fly.. The season was not favorable for
seeding in the south on account of con
9tinned dthy wethtbaf' a8d arerminatidn is
slow from the same cause. Rains in the
late autumn have improved the prospect.
In the western states seeding wasee late, the
seedbed hard and cloddy, germination slow
-and growth favorable until November,
when material improvement was seen in
most fields. In some districts the Hessian
fly made its appearance, causing damage.
The crop is 85.3, the average is 97. The
condition of rye is a little higher than that
of wheat, making an aveaage of 88.8.
Rleturns duly consolidated make the aver
ago farm value of the current crop of the.
vyear; Corn, 42.2 cents per bushel; white,
858; rye, 77.4; barley, 54; oats, 32.2; buck
wheat, 57.9; potatoes, 37.1; tobacco, cigar
leaf, 14.1 per pound; manufacturing and
export leaf, 7.5; hay. $8.89 per ton.
The price of corn is 2.9 cents per bushel
more than the average of the ten years
from 1880, and only four-tenths of a cent
less than the average for the decade from
1870. In the states of largest production
the prices are: Ohio 41 cents. Indiana 38,
Illinois 37, Iowa 30, Missouri 33. Kansas 34,
Nebraska 26. The latter state, where corn
is cheapest, has reported a higher value
only four times in fifteen years. The aver
age value of th@ whole crop since 1883 has
been higher only in 1887 and 1890, when the
yield was only twenty bushels per acre. The
value of the wheat crop is 3.5 cents per
bashel higher than the average for the ten
years from 1880, and was exceeded only
once, in 188S, since 1883. In the states of

Conmmlalsioner of NavigLatin.
WAsIuNarTON, Dec. 10.-Comnmisioner of
Navigation Bates, in his atnnual report,
dwells on marine insurance and says we are
fast drifting into udependency on foreign
ulnderwriting. The manifest decadence of
our underwriting power is of material con
corn. It is as necestsry to have marine un
derwriting of our own as comulllerce of our
own, or shipping of our own. Marine in-.
suratlco is it facility and power for the
coulnanid of trade needful in peace, but on
iential in war. The underwritinti of our
enemy is not to be thought of; that of ai
rival inver should be tdeended on. TLhe
cotuisesionter reeomtumnds the iabrogation
of the treaty with Greolt B*ritain which pre
vents the building of armed vessels on tile
lakes and the repeal of the act of 1852 nu
thorizing the laetionialization of foreign
vessels.

An Early Morning Fire Works Havoe In
Thllat Town.
DErM:nsevrre, via RIAVALLr, Dec. 10.-[Spe
cial.]-Early this morning a fire was dis
covered in the Rid Light saloon, which ad
Joins the livery stable of Charles Allard's
stage line. Measures were at once taken to
subdue it, but it was found that too much
headway had been gained, and the best por
tion of the town is in ruins. It is estimated
that the loss will amount to from $10,000 to
$18,000. The buildings were principally on
the east side of the town and the following
firas are the chief euffereas: Lynch
Bros., Hatfield & Harrigan. Red
Light saloon, Lewis & Schon
feldt, H. S. Connor, the Sideboard saloon.
The buildings on the west side of the street
were damaged considerably by scorching,
among them being those occupied by the
Missoula Mercantile company, Geo. H.
Adams, Northwestern bank, Lawyer J. E.
Clinton and the Cliff house. The office
and residence of the Hon. J. E. Clifford, of
Clifford & Hannard, was separated from
the burning buildings by a brick wail and
it was hoped they would be successful in
arresting the fire-at this point. To accom
plish this 'end all efforts were directed.

BUTTE, Dec. 10.--[Special.].-As the moat
effectual method of lessening the senoke
which infests this city, the city council a
year ago passed an ordinance prohibiting
the smelting companies from roasting ore
in heaps, that method causing most of the
smoke. The ordinance was to go into effect
in nine months, giving the companies am
ple time to put up kilns and stacks. The
ordinance went into effect three months
ago and the heap roasting was stopped, so
that Butte has been comparatively free
from smoke this fall. Yesterday the Bos
ton & Montana started up five mammoth
heap roasts, on the grounds that it was
absolutely necessary to do this or
suspend operations. Last night and this
morning the city vas filled with stifling
smoke. Three employee of the Bosaton .&
Montana company were out under arrest
today for violation of the smoke ordinance.
An injunction was obtained front the dis
trict court restraining the company from
heap roasting. The heaps are burning,
however, and it will require the services of
the fire department and a flood of water to
extinguish them.
