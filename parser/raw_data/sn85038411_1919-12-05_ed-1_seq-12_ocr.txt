SCRUM OF HORSES
GIVEN HOSPITALS
Used For Treatment of Men
ingitis, Pneumonia and
Dvsentery
Xew York, Pee. 5. —One of tho
most important contributions to the
United States Oovernment hospitals
Was made this year, by 46 immu
nized horses at Princeton, New Jer
sey, in tho form of serums for the
treatment of meningitis, pneumonia
and dysentery, according to the re
port on war activities of the Rocke
feller Institute for Medical Research
made public here to-day by Pr. Si
mon Flexner, Pirector of Labora
tories. „ _
At the time of the signing of the
.armistice the report says, serum pro
duction for the treatment of the
diseases named was at its height.
'Tho number of doses supplied in
creased from 3,000 in 1917 to 25.000
;ln 1918 and it was estimated that
,the output for the first three months
lot this year far exceeded the entire
■ output for 1918.
The total of 2,035 bottles of serum
was sent during tho year to the
army and naval medical schools,
Washington: to United States army
i camps; naval stations and camps;
iAmerican Expeditionary Force; Hy
genic Laboratory, United States Pub
lic Health Service and the Royal
Naval College In London.
The report emphasizes the suc
cess attending the method on treat
ing Infected surgical wounds which
Poctors Carel and Pakin perfected
and -luring the year, it says, in
strucUons were given to 998 medical
.officers and enlisted men of the
'United States Army and Navy, to
civilian surgeons and to nurses of
the Red Cross and civilian hospitals.
A special appropriation of $55,000
has been made, it is said, to enable
-the war demonstration hospitals to
.continue in active operation until
April 1. 1920.
"A permanent addition lias been
made to the measures now available
for preventing gaseous gangrine, or
for curing it when it arises in con
nection with the industrial or other
accidents of civil life," says the. re
port, anti-serums having boon pro
duced not only for the gas bacillus
(Bacillus Welchii) but also for other
annaerobic bacteria oecuring in cul
tivated soils. In the hospital of the
Rockefeller Institute, tho report savs
researches on the streptococci, edu
cation during tho epidemics of pneu
monia following measles and influ
enza in the army camps, "will be
carried to a conclusion because of
their intrinsic importance and the
menace which ylreptococcio infec
tions present 'n civil life."

TOBACCO INDUSTRY BECOMES
BIG REVENUE PRODUCER,
ROPER S/4 YS IN REPORT
Washing ton, Dec. 5. —Estimates
of $6,000,000,000 as the yield of the
present revenue law for the first
twelve months of its operation will
be closely approached if not fully
realized, Internal Revenue Commis
sion Roper said In his unnual report.
Payments of the first two install
ments, March 15 und Juno 15,
brought Into the Treasury a total
of $2,600,783,000, Mr. Roper said,
while reports already In hand of the
third Installment payable Sept. 15,
fully support the bureau's estimate.
Commissioner Roper said the to
bacco Industry had developed Into
one of the greatest sources of FcU
erul revenue, the total receipts from
this source alone for the fiscul year
ending June 30, 1919, being $206,-
003,660, an increase of $4 8,800,000
over tboso of tho preceding year.
More Cigars Smoked
An onormous Increase In the num
ber of cigaretes manufactured was
shown by the reports, the total for
tho last fiscal year being approxi
mately eight times larger than in
1910. In that year, 8,500,000,000
cigaretes and 8,000,000,000 cigars
wero manufactured, while in the last
fiscal year tho manufacture of ciga
retes had increased to 46,500,000,-
000 while the number of cigars re
mained practically stationary.
Discussing constitutional prohi
bition, Mr. Roper said that probably
50,000,000 gallons of spiritous
liquors would remain In bonded
warehouses when the constitutional
amendment becomes effective Janu
ary 16.
During the year ended June 30,
approximately 99,000,000 gallons of
distilled liquor were produced from
Will Ask Early
Consideration of the
Peace Resolution
Washington, Dec. 5. —A joint reso
lution declaring the 'war with Ger- ,
many "at an end" waa introduced j
yesterday by Representative Tink-j
ham, Republican, Massachusetts, j
He indicated he had acted at the:
suggested of Republican leaders In I
the Senate and said he would ask [
early consideration by the Foreign j
Affairs Committee.
House lenders said they had no !
plans for action 011 the resolution. '
The text of the Tinkham resolu- i
tion follows:
"Whereas, the. resolution of Con- j
gross adopted April 6, 1917, by rea- (
son of acts committed by the then !
German government a state of war j
was declared to exist between that j
government and the United States, j
and. j
"Whereas, the said acts of war of I
the German government have long
since ceased, and,
"Whereas, hostilities between I
Germany and the allied and asso- j
elated powers have terminated;
"Now therefore, be it,
"Resolved by the Senate and s
House and Representatives of the j
United States in Congress assembled, j
"That the said war between Ger-1
many and the United States is here- |
by declared to be at an end."
FINED FOR NEAR BEER SALES
Oil City. Pa-, Dec. s.—Twenty- j
three persons were fined $2," each at:
Cambridge Springs, when they were
found guilty of selling near beer al
leged to contain more than one-half
of 1 per cent alcohol. |
i materials other than fruits, this
figure representing a decrease of
nearly 75,000,000 gallons from the
' previous year's production.
Tho efTect of wartimo prohibition
has presented a problem which is
causing revenue officials "serious em
barrassment," Mr. Roper said.
Holders of heavy stocks of liquor in
bond were forced, under provisions
1 of the last revenue act, to pay an
additional tax Sept. 15. The law
i closing the saloons for the period of
, - the war has left those interests with
. | their products and without means
■ j of obtaining money to make the tax
■ ' payments, he said.
Many Drugs Smuggled.
"Under the law the discretion of
■ the bureau is limited to extending
the time for payment of these taxes
i seven months." Mr. Roper explained.
"Serious embarrassment lias re
sulted as to the course of action
which should be taken in these
l cases to protect the interests of the
• Government without imposing un
■ due financial hardships on the tax
i payers which presumably were not
I Intended by Congress."
i The report revealed a menace in
: Illegitimate traffic in drugs between
this country and Canada and
Mexico. Mr. Roper urged that some
temporary arrangement be estab
lished which would put a stop to
this smuggling.
Expenditures of the bureau dur
i lng the last fiscal year, Mr. ltoper
said, were $20,573,771, an increase
[I of $12,003,214 over the previous
fiscal year. On this basis, he said,
it had cost the Government 0.543
, I per cent to administer the revenue
I j laws and collect the second greatest
i l tax bill the Nation ever has laid.

Cummins Charges
Misrepresentation of
His Railroad Bill
Wa-liiiurton. Dee. s.—After speak
j iag three days, Senator Cummins,
I chairman of the Interstate Com
j meree Committee, concluded late
' yesterday a detailed explanation of
t his railroad bill, designed to meet
I conditions with the return of the
j roads to private ownership and con
| trol.
j Discussing the anti-strike provi
! sion of the measure, as proposed by
the committee. Senator Cummins de
-1 elared "there had been an indus
j trious effort to misrepresent the
> bill," He denied that it interfered
j in any way with railway employes
! or officials who desired to quit work.
Emphasizing that he was not op
! posed to labor organizations, Sen
-1 ator Cummins said the committee,
! in inserting the anti-strike section felt
1 that "the civilization of America
; cannot continue or endure unless
5 organized society can find some plan
i to preserve industrial peace and or-
I der." President Wilson's message
'to Congress Tuesday, he declared,
j was a direct endorsement of the pro
| posed legislation.

GET AMERICANS
OUT OF MEXICO
Sonic Concerns of the States
Prepare to Bring Their
Men to the Border
El l*aa<>, the, Ft, —Cailain
American cancmna operating in
Mexico ordered tlielr border repre
sentatives (o prepare for getting
their American ctnpioyeo out of
Mexico, tn some oanctj tiio definite
insf ructions were given for im
mediate withdrawal of American
eajployera from Mexico,
Hut nets t'< these companies were
ytiibhcld because of the possible
danger, it yttut said, to their em
ployes in quitting the southern re
pu biie.
Danger to A men cans in Mexico,
should diplomatic relations between
the two eountrios be broken off, lias
been seriously discussed on the
border in connection with the
Jenkins coso. It was felt that an
order front the government such as
j was issued by President Taft in 1912
ordering Americans to quit Mexico,
would create an ill-feeling south of
iiut border and might cause blood
shed.
The problem hi gelling the Ameri
cans out of Mexico should diplo
matic relations be broken, would be
a difficult one, according to their
employers, for they Are scattered
throughout the country and many
gre great, distances from railroads
and telegraph lines,
Pompanies preparing to get I heir
employes home hesitated to-day (o
permit publication of their inten
tions, Then it was decided that the
situation appeared so critical that
notice of their action might point
tlie way to safety to other Ameri
cans in the interior.
Should a resolution breaking oft
relations be passed, it was said that
there would be a general exodus of
Americans to the United States.
Argentine Watching
the Situation Between
America and Mexico
! Buenos Aires. Argentine, Dec. 5. —
While the rumors of an offer of
mediation by the A. B. C. powers
| (Argentina, Brazil and Chile) to
settle the difficulties between the
United States and Mexico lack con
firmation, it is known that the Ar
gentine government is closely watch
ing the situation and that the
fofeign office is keeping fully in
formed of the developments through
the Argentine envoys in Washington
and Mexico City. It is much ques
tioned in diplomatic circles whether,
If action towards mediation is to bo
taken by any of the South American
governments, it should be joint ac
tion by the A. B. C. powers, inns
much as the proposal for an A. B.
C. accord which followed the Ni
agara Falls conference of 1914 lias
never been ratified and it is not be
lieved that this principle could now
be appropriately invoked.

CONQUERING THE 1
POTATO WART
Conference Brings Out Effec
tive Measures of Protection
and Eradication
Washington, Pee. 5. Report:
given at a recent conference of offi
cials from West Virginia, Pennsyl
vania, ,m<l Maryland with the Fed
eral Horticultural Board of the
United States Department of Agri
culture, called to consider the status
of the potato wart disease, show that
there lias been only a slight spread
of this recently discovered menace to
the potato industry of AmeHcu, and
that by planting immune varieties
further losses from the dlse:tso can
be practically eliminated. The po
tato wart is one of the most destruc
tive maladies attacking potato c rops
in Europe, and heretofore no means
lias been known for eradicating it
from tho soil, once a garden or a
| field became infected. Not only have
the investigators for the United
Stales Department of Agriculture
found varieties of potatoes which are
immune, but they have devised a
method of thoroughly disinfecting
the soil by the use of steam and
formalydehyde.
As a result of tile conference in
Washington, it is announced that the
State authorities of West Virginia
and Pennsylvania will take steps to
assist gardeners In the infected
regions in the purchase of varieties
of seed known to be immune. Jt
may bo found advisable, also, to un
dertake the disinfection of a limited
number of garden plots. As the cost
of tiiis work is approximately SI,OOO
an acre, the efforts along this line
will be limited until I lie most ef
fective and economical methods have
been discovered.
