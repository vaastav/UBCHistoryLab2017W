VMiiiM Ti s , Dec. 8. [ Special Telegram
( o the HUP. ] Chicago Is to bo the plnco anil
Tuesday , June lit , the date for holding the
national republican nominating convention.
This conclusion was i cached by the national
republican commlttco Lite tills afternoon
niter two hours of speeches by rcpicsenta-
tlvcsof the vntlous cities computing for the
convention and tince ballots by the commit
tee. Omaha eiuno to the front In better form
than was anticipated. On the first ballot bho
was second choice , Chicago leading with
eleven votes and Omaha receiving ten. If
there had been any "dark horse business"
about it , thcro would have been no doubt of
Omaha securing the pii/e. She was the
prime favorite as second choice. Too much
credit cannot bo given Senator Mamlcison
for the iniinner in which ho presented tlio
advantages of Omaha and his speech
is pronounced by everiono lisa masterly
effort and elicited lepoatcd applause. Two
or tluec members of the committed acknowl
edged to this 111 I. coriesiwndont that they
weie won over toOnmhnby the way in which
her claims weio presented. The delegation
sent hero fiom Ncbuisha also did magnificent
wor1 ; , and although its members togiet hav
ing fulled to secure that for which they came ,
they aic satisfied that theii work has not
been in vnln and that the city of Omaha and
< fInto of Nobuiska will deiivo enough benefit
vo i ep.iy them for the trouble anil expend- !
lui ? made. The general comment among
representatives of the vauous delegations
that . ' , ave been in attendant o at
tiio capital to picscnt their respcc-
* 'v6 claims for the convention ,
is that Omaha made a splendid showing and
was highly complimented us being second on
the tirst ballot , standing ahead of such cities
as 1'hiludulphia , Cincinnati , St. Louis and
IndianuiK > lis. It has trunsphcd , since the lo
cation was rnudo that a good deal of "boodlo"
was used by the Chicago lobby. Ciawfoid , of
Florida was hi ought in after the committed
was in session , and without light was ad
mitted tooto by pioxy. Some paitieswlio
were bought , of course , after making a feint
on the llrst ballot , went over bodily.
Chukson , of Iowa , who was ex
pected to stand by Omaha to the
end , went over on the second ballot and it is
generally understood that Klkiiis and Claik-
t > on pulled the wires together for Chicago.
A majoi ity of the Omaha delegation go back
by way of Now York. Congressman Me-
Shuno and ex-Mayor Bojd worked very
earnestly with the republican repicsentativcs
from Nebraska on behalf of Omaha and were
both picsent with the delegation when
General Mamlci son delivered his address to
the committee.
The Proceeding ! * in Detail.
WAsniMiroN , Dec. 8 The icpublican na
tional committee was called to order at 11
this moining in the Arlington hotel by U. F.
Jones , of Pemi'ij Ivmita , its chairman , Sam
uel Fcssenelen , of Connecticut , acting as see-
icturv. In a biicf speech Clinumini .loucs
stated the object of the meeting as follows :
"Gentlemen of the Committee : As stated I

A nx-ess was taken lonj- enough to cnnbli

quarters , and when Chairman Jones agan
tailed tlio committeeto order it \\a
decided to allow each delegation llftcci
minutes in which tp present tlicir claims fo

In their icspectivo cities. The His
delegation admitted was that from Mimic

Wimlom , who ga\o icasons w by lie though

citizens that tlio tta\ cling c\i > cnsc

than if the convention should b
licld in Chicago. Should the convention nice
in Minneapolis , ample hotel accommodation

Ho predicted that the electoral vote of Mis

favor of the nominee ) of the. republican con
vention , whoever ho might be.
Major Roche , of Chicago , in a
business-like manner detailed the
conveniences which could bo ac
corded mcmbeis of tlio convention by Chi
cago. He , as major , would bo pleased to
have the convention meet in a city which
hud grown to bo what she was under the pro
tecting Influence of the tnilff. [ Applause. ]
Senator Cullnm earnestly urged the commit
tee to select Chicago anil he made a biief
resume of the hotel , tallroad and telegraph
facilities of that eitj' . Chicago to day was in
favor of protection and hud been Improved
in other vvu\s since ISM. It had had much
to do in grappling with the element of com
munism anil socialism that hud been spread
ing over the country. It hud been settled bj'
the authorities of Illinois that a man who
disregarded the tights of property and law
and government could not livom Chicago erin
in the commonwealth. [ Applause. ] He
boK.'d | Chicago would be selected , but
whether It weie or not , Illinois and Minnesota
seta , and Nebiuska and Kansas and Io\va
stand by their colois and vote the republican
ticket.
Senator Mandeison spoke forOinnha"that
joung giant municipality situated in the
lieait of the continent ami upon the banks of
the greatest liver in the world. " If
the convention weio held there ,
when its vvotk was completed ,
members of the committee would icalizc that
tlio statements of the gentlemen who vvcro
here lepiesenting Omaha had been chaiae-
tei 1/cd by an immoderate degree of modesty.
[ Applause and laughter. ] In the next elec
tion the republicans \voulcl strive to attain
success and ho believed tliut tliej * would elo
HO. With the magnificent issue that the
cneinv had forced upon tlio party the cast
should not demand that the convention should
be held in that section. The westein states
ought to bo strengthened ; tlio convention
ought to be held in ono of them and Omaha
was the location to bo preferred. It hud no
choice for piesident. It was for the nominee
of the convention.
Congressman Hen Buttervvoith presented
the claims of Cincinnati. This place was pe
culiarly suitable for holding the next republi
can convention. The delegation for which
liospoko was a thoroughly representative
one , its membeis coming from all parts of the
Mate. It did not appear in the intei ests of
any candidate. The selection of u candidate
must be the icsult of the intelligent choice
of a convention rcpiesentlng the preferences
of the republican pattj' . Ohio would put her
lanc-o in rest for the nominee and stand in
the front rank , halting and failing in nothing.
Muiat Halsteud , of Cincinnati , seconded
Hutterwoith In his pnnses of Cincinnati ,
Congressman Hai ry Bingham , in an elo
quent speech , presented the claims of Phila
delphia. Colonel William C. Elatn , of Richmond
mend , Va , pic-scnted an argument in favor
of the lepublican prrty in that stute. To
demonstrate her coidinl lecognltion anil sup
port of the national icpublicun party Vii-
gmiu would give her clectoial votes next
jcar to the icpubllcan candidate for the
picsidcncy. Goveinor Gillette , of Dakota ,
presented the claims of the people of that
tei i itorj' to the recognition of the republican
committee and said thej' would send dele
gates to the next.eoiiveiition on the basis of
two tenitonc-s and ho noped tliej * would bo
lecogni/ed and iiJuilttcd. Ho elcsciibed the
treatment of Dakota by the picscnt admin
istration as the blackest page in the blackest
book of Ameiican history. They had been
ofllieted by a man of "SpatIts" [ laughter ] ,
whoso aim appealed to bo to deprive the people
ple of their homesteads on the most frivolous
pretenses. He begged the committee to let
the next national icpubllcan convention set
near to the people of Dakota. Colonel
Plumber , of Dakota , made an energetic
speech. Formal papers presenting the claims
of Chicago , Minneapolis and Omaha were
then submitted ; and , after some discussion ,
the committee proceeded to take an infoimal
vote viva vocc. It tcsulted as follows : For

Goveinoi Gillette , of Dakota , oflcied a icso-
lution allow ing the ten itoij' of Dakota six
delegates at large in the lepublican national

support of it. Opposition was made bj'
seven al membeis on the ground that the committee -
mitteo hid no Juiisdictlon in the matter.
The amendment oflcied bv Mr. Carey , dele

of Dakota and Washington to elect foul con
tingent delegates , \\ho-e admission would bo
decided bj' the coin cntlon w as adopted , after

- mcnding the committee to push campaign
woik between now and the meeting of the
convention. Mr. Gallagher , de-legate from
tlio New Yoik vv01 kmgmen's party , asked of
the committee some iccogmtion of the cause
of labor. He wanted a committee to further
the views of the labor pailj in the diicction
of a high protective tarilT , a strong nuvy ,
mot o coast defenses , intei nal improvements ,
compulsnij education and other mattcis , anil
to use the surplus and protect the labor of
Ameiican wotkingmon. Thcj' asked for tnu
liberation ol the white slaves us thej' had

tion of Conger , of Ohio , the hearty and full
en operation of the commlttco was voted to

Kiel the City of Thrm.
CIIKMOO , Dec. 8 [ Special Telegiam to the
Hrr. ] t'ovv people , besides Chief of Police
Ebeisold and Captain Ljman Lewis , aio ac
quainted with the fact that in tlio upper right
hand drawer of the captain's desk In the DCS-
plalncs sliect station there is n bunch of pa
pers containing information about the hot
bed of anarchists on the West Side that
would cause some of the icds to shake in
their boots if they only knew the substance
of It. Cnplain Lewis Is n quiet sort of an of
ficial , never giuff toisltois , and appatentlj'
the least aggressive of any captain in the
city. To look at him ono woitld never guess
that he Is engaged in conducting n still hunt
and collecting evidence against the different
red flag organizations which ho intends to
spring on them at some future clay , lint
such i ? the case. During a little talk to-dav
the captain divulged enough of bis plans to
show that a determined cffoit is being made
to get u case against tlio anarchists th.it has
for Its object the banishing , by legal process ,
of any and all of "tho fotcign rascals , " as ho
calls them , who can bo shown to cntcitnin
anaiehlstlc views
"I know that the bulk of their strength is
hero in mj' district , " said the captain , "but
Just now they aie inactive. The hanging
w as a blow that stunned them , and although
thej' eontlnuo to gather In the saloons of
Giicf and Tlorus at 54 and 71 West Lake
street , thej'do nothing wet so than drink beer
and talk. Every evening they meet and ,
aftci cli inking sevciul glasses of beer , their
tongues get loose and they begin to'rnnt. No
doubt if all thej' say in one even
ing at cither of these places , their old
headquaiters , could bo overheard , wo
would have a case against them at once , but
the Instant a policeman shows himself they
quiet their loud exclamations and scatter
like rats. All mj' ofllceis aio , of course
known , and a straiurer in tlicir midst has the
same effect as an oftlcer until they know who
he is and what is his business. Besides ttieso
two places there me numerous private beer
rooms where thoj' meet to harangue and
lash themselves into bccrj' fien/y hut it is
best not to tell where these ate located.
Thus far I don't believe they have a single
resort that wo aie not nwtuo of. They hav o
given up the idea of mass meetings and when
anj thing iniK | > rtuiit needs tlicir attention
they adjouin to the residence of some ono of
their number. Their real meetings me held
onlj' this way and tliej' never go to the same
house twice in succession. Hut wo have even
the houses spotted.
"This dispute with Major Hocho on the
beer question has exasperated them moio
than the hanging seemed to. They hud como
to expect the hanging but that they should
bo denied the beer privilege w as a shock ns
well as a surprise to all of them. Take the
beer away from them altogether and thcro
would bo no more anatchy in my opinion.
That cffci vest cut beverage selves to till
their brains with visional y dreams aiid
theories. The more thoj' drink the more
visionary they become ; the logical patt of
their brains is overcome by their imagination
and thej' fancy all sorts of things. "

LONDON' , Dec. 8. [ Now Yoik Herald
Cable Special to the Hii.J : : Cleveland's
Christmas conundrum Is being guessed nil
round , but nobody seems to know the an
swer. An eminent city man said to mo tills
afternoon1
"Our markets are completely upset ; wo
don't know which way to move. "
I asked him what thu message had got to
do with his markets anj how.
"Well , people say tnero will bo a panic In
the United States , " was the icply.
All sorts of theories are afloat of America
coming round to fico trade soon. Unglish
goods will go to your potts duty free. Cleve
land's stntuo will bo erected bj' the side of
Cobden's. Tuir traders , to borrow a classical
pluasc , are "knocked higher than u kite. "
Tliej' have been Inviting the woikingmcn to
imitate the American commercial sjstcm ,
and now Ameiica , "doubling round" free
trade , u whole Niagaia of cold water
has been pouied down the fair trad
ers back. Thot papers all give , their
intciprctatlons of the message and the people
accept them. Perhaps that is why nobodj'
understands the president. Englishmen
mean by free ti ado the absolute prohibition
of duties on articles and goods produced by
themselves no tuxes on taw matciials or
food. It is in vain that men hcic and there
pointing out that no such policy 'is indicated
by the president's message. A nation docs
not know what to do with its sutplus , and its
chief tnagisttato advises it not to collect quite
so much at the custom house. It shows how
vciy uncaaj' English fieo traders have latclj'
been concerning this position that thej' hall
tliis announcement as the acceptance of their
views. To convert the United .States is in-
indccd n triumph. Tlio Cobclcn club will
henceforth set up a t shrine for the worship
of Piesident Cleveland and send him all its
publications gratis. Cobden founded free
trade ; Cleveland saved it. Such is the
buidcnof the song all tlnough England to
day.
In political circles the message creates ns
much of a sensation as anj where , but its
purpoit is not misunderstood. It is pei.

President Cleveland lias j ct some distance to
travel before ho will bo iccognlicdus the suc
cessor of HobeitPecl.s IJut the English have
made up their mi nets that ho hug rcallj' joined
the true church. Although he is not qmto
ready to avow his conversion , ho will be
ormallj' received in duo season. Their mis
takes are astonishing- . They think that v.'hen
a thing is recommended in the president's
message it is settled. Thej' leave congt ess
completely out of sight. Evcrj' provincial
town local paper states that America has
tinned fico tiadcritnd great is the icputution
of Cleveland and blessed his name.
The fair tiaders were already getting into
n mess owing to intoinul dissentions. Some
of them clamor for a dntj * onlj' on wheat ,
some on manufactures , and othcts want to
tax everj thing indiscriminately. To dnj 's
meeting showed the extent of the schism , for
all tine leaders of the movement absented
thembC.lv cs. Letters from some of them have
been sent , but it is not likely that the chair
man would dare to read them. The proposed
tax on food is especially denounced in these
letters. They cumo fiom men who have a
right to bo heard. These divisions at the
vei j- time an appeal'is being made to the pub
lic for 100,000 with which to eairy on the
agitation , must grcatlj damage the whole
cause. At such a moment Clev eland explodes
his toi pedo under the partj' . The papers tell
them Ameiican free ttado has blown them
into the air , and thejbuliev e it , knowing no
better.
The teal originators of this movement aio
w orkmg men vvhc ) know w hat thej' w ant ane
mean to have it , Thej' compiess their de
mands into a nutshell free t ratio all rounder
or duties all round. They will need Sam
AVcllor's microscope to detect that docti ino
in the president's message. The tory leaders
will now sit down heavily on their hcrctica
followers. The president has dealt a vcrv
adroit blow at the paitj' hcte which cries
aloud for the duties on American linpoi ts. I :
his piellminary skirmish leads to a dispersal
of the fair tradcis , unique distinction will belong -
long to an American president that
of destrojing an English party without
any direct interference in English politics
This can onlj' bo accomplished bj' concessions
in the tariff in favor of English manufactures
If the United States will reduce the duties on
cotton , iron , silk , woolen and other goods to
ten per cent , the fair trade party must dis-
solv o or modify its policj' . "Killed by Cleve
land" maj' bo Inscribed over its grave.
Whether tlio message Is likely to bo followed

are far better able to Judge than jour cories-

LONDON , Dec , 8. [ New * York Herald
Cable Spec-la ! to the Hn : . | President
Cleveland's message obtained entrance into
two confeiences itodoj' ono at St. James
hull , where was held u rattling convention
l > y the national association for the preserva
tion of agriculture und other industncs. It
assembled in order to protest against the
i uin of British'iniluHtrles through unrestric
ted foi cigu competition. The other was the
great unionist conference ut the Westminster
tow n hull. One vv-ts presided over by How
ard Vincent ; M. P. , w ho rcccntlj * made , a
tour of the United States , and of the other
Loul Hartington was chairman.
Said the -former , in the course of his
speech : "President Cleveland's message
vv as probably nojit wholly unussociated with
our demand In England to day for fiscal ri >
foim , "
Very many allusions in botli conferences
were made to the United States. Lot d Pen-
zancet ut the protection meeting at St. James'
'hall ' , said : "While the United States and
Gcrmanj' , whoso fiscal condition is most op-
KHedtoour own , are precisely the nations
which mo JloutUhing above all others , it is
difficult to bo satisfied with things us they
are in England "
The Duke of Rutland said. "They saw
protectionist America able to pay off the debt
mcuried la the late war , nml able to produce
annually i-ii.lHW.lKH ) , while poor fiee tiado
U'luUM.hui togoun hci ' .HITS 10 olar a
Ittle money to support her nrinj' and navy. "
[ Cheers. ]
A resolution was jrassed urging bj' e'onsti-
uUonul means the Imposition of such moder
ate duties us shall put the food producers of
he United Kimrdom In a | > osltlon to compete
on fair and Just terms with those of other
countries. Other tesolutlons were also
Hissed :
"Owing to the heavy imi > ort duties 1m-
> oscd by other nations and to the loss of our
ionic trade icsult Ing front the want of pur
chasing o power on the part of the agricultu
ral Inteiest , which can be distinctly traced to
.ho importation of the produce of foreign
ands , labor and capital press upon her
majesty's government the necessity of tc-
vising our present sjstcm , of so-culled ftce
trade. "
Also : "That this meeting , icali/lng the
increasing want of. cmploj incut among those
whose daily broad depends upon their labor ,
must ultimately result in danger to tlio peuco
mil well being of the nation , counsels the
adoption of modciate duties on nil imported
; oods which compete with our home Indus
tries and labor In eider that Hiitish caoltal
may bo Invested in the cultivation of our own
soil and in working our own mills and lacto-
i ies , without which no amount of buj ing and
selling the productions of other lands can
really conduce to the prosperity of our pee
ple. "
The chairman called attention to the fact
that eighteen regular branches had sent hith
erto leading delegates. He added that in the
hall were assembled representatives of com
mercial and ngiicultuial interests and neatly
every trade fiom well nigh cvciy county of
the United Kingdom. It was no class gath-
ciing. [ Cliecis. ] The landlord was repic-
scntcd , also the farmer and agricultural la
borer and artisan. If they had united action in
the cause of the defense of British industries
they wore bound to win in the end. Till free
trade became univcisal all classes should
unite and iclax no exertion to secure adequate
and legitimate defense of Uiitish industry.
[ Chccis. ]
The number of peers , members of parlia
ment and Influential commands who at
tended and wrote encouiaging Icttcisshowed
that the resolutions hud a largo support in
high quattcis.
It was said that Mr. Blulno had been in
vited to speak , but being in Pans ho was un
nblo to accept. The association intended
printing the picsiclcut's message.
At the Hartington meeting the Earl of
Derby made the lirst speech. In the course
of it he said : "Wo nro accustomed
to quote tlio United States ns u
tjpical democracy. Well , wo aio now
as deniociatiu as thej' , and I am suio that if
in New YOIK or New England disturbances
and sjstcmatic outrages like those in Iielund
had been attempted and carried on thej' would
have been put down far more loughlj' and
promptly than thej' have been by us. "
[ Cheeis ]
The Evening Echo gives fiec trade a icver-
bcration thus to the protectionist meeting :
"Turn to the United States.
What has protection done for Amer
ican farmcis ? Par from helping
it has made him unable to compete profitably
with foreign growers of wheat , notwith-
6.ifUng the virgin soil , no i cut and other
advantages. " We-have it on the highest
Amci Wan authot ity that at pi cscnt lulf the
wheat growers in the west are practically
bankrupt. The anti-free tindo movement
cannot make much head way in face of the
facts , and Mr. Howard Vincent is un cneinj1
instead of a f i iend of the gov eminent whom
ho professes to seivc. "

tinued his easy moncj'-making career at the

Abhton came upon the stage , thcj' mot u

when Sullivan began rapidlj' to makeAshton
hop around the stage and kept him going to
the end.
Hound n. This was very tame , as both
acted on the defensive until Ashton , pluj ing
nt him very fast , drove John L. back a bit.
But , as if nettled bj1 the applause and cheers
for Ashton , Sullivan paid him in full before
time to rest came.
Follow ing a precedent set last night , thcj'
then came up for round 4 , which was added
to the programme. This was a fair specimen
of hard hitting , and when both clinched al
the finish applause was veiy ftcoly even and
no hisses.
