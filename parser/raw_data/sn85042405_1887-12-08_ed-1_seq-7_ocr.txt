BACHELORS IN COUNCIL.
Their Kanlcs Replenished and Their De­
termination to Wage the Good Figlit,
Hardened in Convention Assembled—A
Great Occasion.
The great movement for statehood is
not the only issue now agitating the so­
cial capacities of many good Dakota citi
zens. There is another crusade afoot
which if not as politically important as
the statehood matter, is certainly in a
social way tar more so. The bachelors of
the territory are on the war path, and
from the account of the convention at
Ellendale this week, it would seem that
gore pervades the countenance of the
moon—emblem of the first knock down
for the "bach's". The Ellendale Com­
mercial, which has been truthfully re­
porting the proceedings of this struggle
for liberty by the bachelors, says the con­
vention was enthusiastic and generally
harmonious. There were delegates there
in spirit and person, from all over the
territory—many redoubtable bachelors—
flowers of the cause. Liberty Hall
Bmoked with excitement as the social
revolution surged to triumphant result.
The speeches were full of encouragement
and faith,—war cries for justice—while
the resolutions were sonorous with im­
portance and gave fourth the true ring
The Commercial says of the great occa­
sion:
The convention was called to order by
President Tobin of the Dickey county
•club. It has been rumored in the local
club that the president had aroused sus­
picions by his associations of late, and
therefore it was deemed by that penitent
official, that the object of the meeting
would with more propriety, be presented
by a steadfast brother Col. Steinau of
Ellendale, who declared that the present
movement for the emancipation of the
bachelors from the tyranny of the mar­
riageable woman was bound to succeed,
because it was based upon justice and
had enlisted the flower of the bachelor
population. (Applause.)
On motion of Jesse W. Boyce, the
Sioux Falls attorney, who is known as
the tallest man in the profession, Hon. P.
J. Cumber of Wahpeton, was chosen tem­
porary chairman. W. H. Howe of Mon
ango, W. K. Kellogg of. Jamestown, and
Al. Ward of Aberdeen were made secre­
taries. Walter Goddard of Sioux Palls,
E. J. Schwellnbach of Jamestown, J. S.
Iianney of Ellendale, H. C. Plumley of
Fargo and C. C. Sheppard of Oakes were
selected as the committee on credentials.
F. C. McConnell of Fargo, S. H. Snyder
of Wahpeton, W. H. Ellis of Oakes, C. H.
Day of Sioux Falls and T. M. Evans of
Ellendale were chosen to report on per­
manent organization.
The committees were ordered to re­
port immediately after the noon recess.
Mr. IvIcCumber then addressed the con­
vention. "We have come together from
all parts of the territory,"said he,"to take
council with one another in the inaugura­
tion of a great reform movement—one of
those mighty crusades that every few
years are launched upon society for the
purpose of changing the existing order
in life's customs. No grander cause
ever enlisted human sympathy or aroused
the heroism of desperate men than that
Tvhich inspires our actions today. (Ap­
plause.) This is a struggle of the down­
trodden bachelors of the land to become
free from the tyranny of mariiageble
women. (Cheers) No tyranny has
ever been so merciless as this! (Ap­
plause.) No other class of slaves or
serfs have ever borne so heavy a yoke as
that under which we groan. Never in
the history of the world has the condi­
tion of man boen so pitiable,so sorrowful,
so abjectly miserable as ours is today.
(Applause.) The girl of the period is
daily becoming more capricious, more
heartless, more arrogant and more dis­
dainful. Most of our class long since
bowed their heads to this tyranny and
surrendered all hope of obtaining their
rights. Upon those who are disposed to
stand firm for independence and liberty
the marriageable woman is steadily, in­
sidiously encroaching. Without pity in
her eye, knowing no compassion in her
heart, remorselessly, desperately, with
outstretched arms, she is advancing upon
us, determined to capture, enslave and
subjugate us. (Groans.) The momen­
tous question is, shall wo continue in
this condition of misery, uncertainty and
dread or shall we rise in our might, cast
off the fetters which bind us and hurl
woman from power?"
At this juncture the hall became a
scene of uproar, with the entire assem­
blage cheering, stamping, waving their
handkerchiefs and proclaiming their hos­
tility toward the opposite sex in a babel
of tongues. "Women must go!-' shouted
Clayton Smith, of Jamestown. "Liberty
or death!''
cried
Alderman Lawrence, of
Wahpeton. "Crush the despot!" yelled
Mercior, of Aberdeen. After securing
control of the audience again Mr. Mc
Cumber continued: "There is no mis­
taking the tendency of the times or
the temper of this convention. The
bachelor must have liberty, or chaos will
reign. (Renewed cheering.) Man must
be treated with tenderness and placed on
terms of equality with woman, or revolu­
tion will sweep the land. The marriage­
able woman must cast aside her frigid ar­
rogance and withering disdain and per­
mit the bachelor to pursue the ways of
happiness, unmolested, or these peaceful
Dakota valleys shall echo with the discor­
dant notes of civil war." (Prolonged
cheering.)
At the conclusion of Mr. McCumber's
address the convention adjourned for
dinner. Re-assembling at two o'clock, re­
ports
of committees were received. The
temporary organization was made perma­
nent and tne work of approving the cre­
dentials was quickly disposed of. I. B.
Henyon of Huron introduced some iron­
clad resolutions condemingthe heartless
ness of the marriageable womon declar­
ing the necessity for organization to re­
sist the encroachments of the girl of the
period, and to thwart their fell designs
to wage the battle until she is willing at
least to compromise the issues between
us until the bachelors are freed from
her despotism and guarranteod against
•danger from her wiles in the future.
Attorney E. W. Camp of Jamestown,
supported the above in a learned and pa­
triotic address, stating that from his ex­
perience in Dakota, where there are no
woods to hide from the lightning's shaft
and
tii.»L.der's
roll, or deep caverns for
lie St. Anthony's of the profession to
take refuge in, and contemplate the brev­
ity of life by devout reflection upon the
iiuman skull, no safeguards too strong
could be thrown around the weak brother
prone to stumble in the great crusade.
Doctor Camp's eloquent remarks were
sympathetically applauded, and he re­
sumed his seat flushed with emotion on
the cordial reception accorded his maiden
speech in the cause.
Col. Wilson, of Aberdeen, moved that
the following be added to the resolu­
tions:
Resolved, That in this crusade sgain9t the mar­
riageable women we, the bachelors of Dakota as­
sume the aggressive, meeting force with force,
severity wiih severity, and cruelty with cruelty.
Resolved, That wo prosecute this war with a
view, ultimately, to woman's complete surren­
der.
llesolved, That no man is worthy the name of
bachelor wii) refuses to join us in this great cru
sade.
Mr. Steinau objected to the additional
resolutions on the ground that the to no
was too radical. He explained that while
the girl of the period might be heartless
and cruel, she accomplished her designs
by subtlety and art. He thought the
use of her own weapons would be more
effective.
"Brother Steinau has been practicing
subtlety and art against woman all his
life," exclaimed Kollogg, of Jamestown,
"and what has he accomplished for the
freedom find safety for the bachelors?
Liberty Hall is knee-deep in mourning
for bachelors who have gone astray un­
der Mr. Steinau's sophistry. (Applause.)
All were finally adopted.
It was then announced that the Dickey
county club wished to give the conven­
tion an exhibition of its special initiatory
ceremonies, and it was unanimously de­
cided to have the exercises at once.
Two sturdy candidates entered the por­
tals of the club amid ceremonies impres­
sive, elaborate, and of picturesque details.
The chair appointed a large central coun­
cil from all over the territory, among
which, were I. K. Hyman, Frank Lenz,
Willis Smith and J. T. Bibb of James­
town, Chas. F. Amidon and W. P. Cren­
shaw, Fargo.
The convention unable to conclude all
tbe business which it had in view, ad­
journed subject to the call of the chair­
man.
The Charity Hop.
The ladies who propose to give the
coming charity ball have set next Tues­
day night as the occasion of this much
discussed event. The Valley City orches­
tra will be in attendance if their services
can be securod for the night. Tickets
only SI. Everybody is invited and a
good time absolutely assured.
In Good Hands.
It is said that the ladies of the W. C.
T. U. have taken hold of the public read­
ing room matter and will henceforth
have its affair under their personal su­
pervision. An effort is being made to
raise funds to settle with Mrs. Lindsay,
by selling yearly tickets. It is under­
stood that the ladies are meeting with
good success and are contemplating some
extensive changes and improvements in
the spring. Tho public will applaud this
deserving enterprise and all should give
every encouragement possible.
Northern Pacific Items.
The recent N. P. time card does not
give the people west of Jamestown in
Dakota a daylight train, and a petition
is being circulated in Kidder county, ask­
ing the road for such a train. Several
rumors of change in the trains have al­
ready been heard, and the time of arriv­
ing at Jamestown made later iD the
morning and earlier in the evening.
The railroad company is said to have
agreed to pay $100 a month for water*
from the Bismarck stand pipes. Hereto­
fore the Apple Creek tank has sufficed.
The Dawson Breeze says of the water
scarcity:
Dawson has become such a fashionable
"watering place" (for trains) that the ca­
pacity of the railroad well has, of late,
proved rather inadequate to supply the
demand. The steam pump is kept busy
night and day, and when tho tank is full
the well is often dry, necessitating a shut
down until the well fills up again. To as­
sure a plentiful supply at this season the
road's water train has been hauling the
liquid here from Crystal Springs during
the week. When the road sinks a good
artesian well in place of the present shal­
low one, there will be no scarcity of wa­
ter for its engines.
Puzzle Fiends.
The cow problem" published in The
Alert Saturday night has already been
started on its mission. At a meeting
last evening where some fifteen or twenty
wero gathered together, the problem
was referred to and discussed exhaust­
ively. As usual there was a wide differ­
ence in the numerous solutions presented
—$G, S8, $14 and $54 being some of the
results arrived at. One of the party who
is never in the least disposed to bo out
done and especially not in a little matter
involving only the question of profit and
loss, propounded a "stumper" which is
printed for the edification of the puzzle
workers:
A man starts from an orchard with a
basket of apples. He stops at the bars
leaves half of the number and half an
apple besides at the gate he leaves half
of what remains and another half apple.
He then goes to the old gentleman gives
him half of what remains and still an­
other half apple and has only one apple
left. All this he does without breaking an
apple. Tho question is how many apples
lie started with.
According to the story the original so­
lution of the matter resulted in a matri­
monial event.
Minnewakan Sittings Notes.
The young man who called on his girl
the other night and mistook the cat for
the chair'cushion and sat on it, says he
had no idea that a cat could come up to
the scratch on such short notice.
A new paper, it is said will soon make
its appearance at Minot with Marshal
McClure, late of the Tribune, at the helm.
Mrs. C. W. Sivyer left on Monday last
to join her daughter-in-law, Mrs. W. C.
Sivyer at Spokane Fall, Washington Ter.
W. C. and father will leave for the same
destination in about one month.

Withdrawing in His Favor—Great En­
thusiasm Prevails Over the Kesult—
Many Injured in Riotous Demonstra­
tions of tho Rcvolationista.
PARIS, Dec. 5.—M. Sadl Carnot is
elected president of the French republic,
having received GOO votes from tho na­
tional assembly in congress at Versailles.
At 6,35 p. m. MM. Ferry and Freycinet
withdrew their names in favor of Sadi
Carnot, who was leading at that time
with a strong hand. The latter's election
was then assured and the next ballot
gave him the majority that elected him.
Immediately upon the announcement of
liis election the chamber was filled with
cries of "Vive la Kepublique," and tho
greatest of enthusiasm was manifested.
The first ballot gave M. Sadi-Carnot 803.
M. Ferry 212, Gen. Saussier 148, M. De
Freycinet 76, Gen. Appert 72, M. Brisson
20 and 26 votes scattering.
RIOTOUS REVOLUTIONISTS.
Many Persons Injured in Conflicts With
the Police.
PARIS, Dec. 5.—On a pretext that the
republic was threatened hundreds of
revolutionists and socialists in the even­
ing made for the Hotel de Ville. The
police charged the mob and a number of
persons were wounded. Shortly after
midnight a large crowd gathered in the
Place de la Concorde. Several pistol
shots were fired at the police, who tried
to clear the place, and the crowd stood
its ground. Later, reinforced by a body
of infantry, the police succeeded in clear­
ing the square, and sixty persons were
injured.
Strengthening the Army.
PARIS, Dec. 5.—Pending the election of
President Grevy's successor every possi­
ble precaution has been taken to prevent
an outbreak. All of- the generals com­
manding corps and divisions, who have
been visiting Paris, have joined their
commands.
Indignant at Sullivan's Imprisonment.
LOXDOX, Dec. 5.—The Daily News says
the imprisonment of Lord Mayor Sulli­
van is a national scandal. Mr. Sullivan
is a man of the highest character, public
and private, and the question arises,
which the people of Great Britain are
asking in shame and anger, what man­
ner of a law it must be that converts such
men into criminals. The Standard says
the only effect of the present line of con­
duct of the Nationalists will be to alien­
ate the sympathy of even those English­
men who do not look with disfavor upon
home rule.
GUARDED SACREDLY.
The President's Message in the Hands of
the Printer—All Pretended Abstracts
Simply Speculation.
CHICAGO, Dec. 5.—Washington special
to the News: The president's message
was completed Saturday and read to the
cabinet. Then Public Printer Benedict
was called to the White House. The
president handed him the document
and told liiin that he would hold
him responsible ror for its preserva­
tion from the newspaper hawks that
are always looking after such prey. Mr.
Benedict went back to his office, called in
the foreman of the composing room and
a number of select printers, and told
them that if the message or any part of it
leaked out or found its way prematurely
to the newspapers he would discharge
every one of them. The message consists
of from .22,000 to 25,000 words. All pre*
tended abstracts or extracts of the docu­
ments are simply speculation.
ST. LOUIS SANGUINE.
Committees of Republicans and Demo­
crats En Koute to Washington to Cap­
ture tlse Two Conventions.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 5.—Committees ap­
pointed by the state central committees
of both the Republican and Democratic
parties have left for Washington, with
the view of endeavoring to persuade the
members of their respective national
committees of the expediency
of holding the national con­
ventions in St. Louis next midsummer.
Notwithstanding the strenuous endeavors
now being made to secure the conven­
tions for Chicago, Philadelphia, Omaha
and San Francisco, Missouri is hopeful
that St. Louis can offer superior induce­
ments and is very sanguine that at least
one of the national conventions will be
held there.
Eastern Railway Kulldinsr.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5.—The Engineering
News publishes a summary of the rail­
road building during the past year in the
states south of the Ohio and east of the
Mississippi. The number of miles of
new road constructed is as follows: Vir­
ginia, 3(55 West Virginia, 95 North Car­
olina, 292 South Carolina, 583 Georgia,
835 Florida, 214 Alabama, 364 Missis­
sippi, 119 Tennessee, 287 Kentucky,
564. Total, 3,718.
Tlio Labor Party Next Year.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5.—Secretary Barnes,
of the Land and Labor club, has sent out
an address to the supporters of Henry
George throughout the country, saying
that a national convention for the nomin­
ation of a United Labor candidate for pres­
ident, will probably be held next year.
The address advises the nomination of
local candidates by the party wherever
any organization exists.
Differential to the Canadian Pacific.
CHICAGO, Dec. 5.—The differential al­
lowed by the American transcontinental
lines to the Canadian Pacific in order to
abate competition is 30 cents on first-class
freight to New York, and 20 cents from
Chicago to San Francisco. On other
freight the difference in favor of Cana­
dian Pacific ranges from 25 cents down
to 5.
Blaine vs. Cleveland.
PNILADKLRNIA,
Penn., Dec. 5.—At the
Baptist fair a quilt is being voted for, the
candidates for its ownership being Mrs.
Cleveland and Mrs. Blaine. Great rivalry
exists between the friends of the two la­
dies. Thus tar the president's wife is ia
the load.
Makes Land Higher.
We understand that prices of real es­
tate have risen in the vicinity of Napoleon
—$25 per aero for relinquishments of a
claim is getting the boom fixed. Three
hundred dollars was offered for an 80
acre relinquishment, and refused. That
is on the strength of our being the divi­
sion station on the A. B. & N. W. railroad
that now seems to be a certainty.—[Napo­
leon Homestead.
Flip —Flop.
Judge Warnoclc, of the Jamestown
Capital, seems inclined to flop over to
the one-state side, although ho has here­
tofore been a warm advocate of division.
He is now trying to bolster up the Aber­
deen movement, and in a desperate man­
ner tries to make out that the recent
election was indecisive and that the ma­
jority for division don't mean anything.
We are sorry to note its change of base,
coming, as it does, with the charge that
he flopped on the local option question
just before it came to a vote, and we trust
ho will see his error before it is too late.
