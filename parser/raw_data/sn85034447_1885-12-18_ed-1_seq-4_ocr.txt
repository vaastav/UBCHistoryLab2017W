PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.

Into effect, for which oue year's additional
tltno has boon secured by a supplementary
article signed lu February last, and since
raffled on both sides. As this convention,
so Important to tho commercial welfare
of the two. adjoining countries, has been
constitutionally confirmed by the treaty
making brunch, I express the hope that leg
Islutiou needed to make it effective may not
lone bo delayed, The large influx of capital
and enterprise to Mexico from the United
States continues to aid iu the development
of the resources and la augmenting tho ma
terial well-being of our sister Republic.
Lines of railways, penetrating to the heart
and capital of the country, bring the two
peoples into mutually beneficial intercourse,
and enlarged facilities of transit add to prof
itable commerce, create new markets and
furnish aveuues to otherwise isolated coin
munitios. I have already adverted to the
suggestion for the construction of a ship
railway across the narrow formation of the
territory of Mexico at Tehauntepeo.
PERU.
With the gradual recovory of Peru from
the effects of hor late disastrous conflict
with Chill, and with the restoration of civil
authority in that distracted country, it is
hoped that pending war oiaims of our citi
zens will be adjusted. In conformity with
notification givou by the Government of
Peru, tho existing treaties of commerce and
extradition between the United states and
that qj^mtry will terminale March 31st, 1830.

SALARIES OF CONSULS.
I earnestly urge that Congress recast the
appropriations for the maintenance of tho
diplomatic and consular service on a foot

National interests. At every post where
a représentative is necessary, the salary
should be so graded as to permit him to live
In comfort. With the assignment of ade
quate salaries the so called notorial extra
official fees, which our officers abroad are
now permitted to treat us personal per
quisites, should be done away with.
Every act requiring tho ' certifi

should be taxable at schedule rates, and the
fee therefor re turne 1 to the Treasury. By

I favor, also, an appropriation for tho clo

Doubts may well be entertained whether

Civil service reform does not exact tiffs,

The whining of such a clerk discharged

THE FAMILY FRIEND.
How the People of Different Agoa Have
Kept Warm.
Stove is derived from the Saxon stofa.
One of these sources of domestic infe
licity, however modified its form, is
merely a fire-place inclosed on all sides,
tho air entering from below and carried
off, as in a common grate, by a vent.
The general principle is first, to employ
the fuel in the most advantageous man
ner for heating the external part of the
stove, and secondly, to keep within the
room as much of the air so warmed as
is consistent with wholesomeness and
cleanliness.
A fixed stove (stuba) was used in the
time of the Roman Empire for heating
baths, and in-Germany and Scandanavia
for baths and hot-houses. In the mid
dle ages they were generally construct
ed of brick or tiles, sometimes of slate
or steatite (soapstone), and used for
warming dwellings. They wore huge
structures, sometimes occupying the
whole side of a room, and in Scandi
navia their broad flat surface was the
sleeping-place of the household. The
fire was kindled at the bottom, and the
heat and smoke passed through various
flues before reselling the chimney.
These stoves were economical of fuel, a
matter of much importance in some
parts of Europe. In the homes of the
rich they were sometimes faced with
porcelain or highly ornamented tiles.
Manj- will remember, no doubt, a por
celain stove of this description exhibited
in the Swedish department at the Cen
tennial Exposition in 1870. They have
ovens and flues for cooking, and need
to be replenished witli fuel but
twenty-four hours.
One of the first attempts at making a
stove of iron was that of Cardinal
Polignac in Franco, early in the eigh
teenth .century. Tho * Polignac fire
places, so called, were constructed with
hollow backs, hearths and iron jambs,
to economize heat. In 1716 Ur. D
gliers, of London, modified these fire
places to use them for coal instead of
wood. But neither these nor the Hol
land stoves ever became popular in En
gland, owing to the strong prejudice in
lavor of open fires.
Dr. Franklin's stove, invonted in 1745,
was a great improvement on all that
had preceded it. The principle of its
action was the same as that of the air
tight stoves introduced many years
later. Indeed, it would have been air
tight had it been possible at that time to
make tlie castings sufficiently close-fit
ting. About 1775 Franklin invented
several other stoves, among them two
for the burning of bituminous coal. One
of these had a downward draught, and
consumed its own smoke; the other had
the basket grate or cage, with movable
bars at the top and bottom, winch, after
being filled and kindled at tho top could
be inverted, and so made to burn at the
base. Between 1785 and 1795 Benjamin
Thompson (Count Rumford) devised
several improvements in stoves, ovens,
etc., all intended to economize fuel and
heal.
Previous to 1825 the use of stoves,
generally of the box pattern and of
rude construction,
stores, hotel bar-rooms, school-houses
and churches in the cities and larger
towns. Country churches were not
usually warmed, but the older women
carried their foot-stoves and the
protected their feet with stout leather
overshoes known as "boxes." Iu tho
residences of some of the more wealth
city families cannel and other Englis
coal, generally referred to at the time as
"sea coal," was burned in imported
grates or in Rumford stoves lined with
fire-brick. A large number used the
Franklin stove as an open fireplace,
burning wood in it. The rest of the
world used the capacious, old-fashioned
fireplace. The cheapness of fuel, the
cheerfulness of an open fireplace and
the great weight and rough construction
of the stoves of those days, made the
latter in but little demand. After the
opening of the Erie and Champlain
canals, the introduction of river steam
boats, and the beginning of railroad
travel, the facilities for transporting
heavy goods were so much increased
that the manufacture of stoves soon be
came a leading industry. These were
wood stoves, but anthracite coal, which
was gradually coming into use when
ever a high degree of heat was required
and a strong draught possible,
destined to create a revolution in the
business.
The first attempts were failures, and
it was not until 1838, when Jordon L.

fire could be made from nut and

OYSTER CULTURE.
to
All Experiment WIiloli Promises to
crease the Supply of lilvalves.
Professor W. K. Brooks, in a recent
circular of the Johns Hopkins Univer
sity, gives an interesting account of his
summer's experiments in the Artificial
cultivation of oysters in floats. In July
ho constructed a floating car, made so
as to permit the free circulation of the
water, and having filled it with clean
oyster-shells, moored it in tho channel
at Beaufort, N. C. "As all the oysters
in the vicinity," he says, "were in very
shallow water, they were nearly through
spawning, and the conditions were
therefore very unfavorable; but, not
withstanding this, I immediately
cured a good 'set,' and the young oys
ters grew with remarkable rapidity
account of the abundant supply of food
and fresh water which gained ready
cess to all of them, and the uniform
temperature which was secured by the
constant change of water."
The experiments of Prof. Brooks are
very important, as his method of oyster
culture may be applied in many ways,
of which, as he remarks, the most ob
vious is the production of seed oysters
for planting. Tlie "seed" used for
planting in Maryland and Virginia is
procured from the natural beds of our
littoral waters by touging and dredg
in g' By a small investment in floating
collectors, it appears, any one on tide
water could easily raise large quantities
of much better, cleaner seed than that
now taken from the natural beds. The
oysters thus ^ reared are large enough
tor planting in five or six weeks.
As the author of these experiments
points out, his method can also be used
for the direct production of marketable
oysters, especially over muddy bottoms
and in regions where public sentiment
does not permit any private ownership
of the bottom. The method, ii
adopted, will also do away with the
cessir.y for a title to the bottom and
greatly enlarge the supply of oysters for
tho benefit of the people.— N. Y. Herald.

A PATH OF VIRTUE.
V Each One Rales Illmself Well, the Good
Results Are Hard to Compnte.
t Chinese sage has notably described
the path of virtue. In the Confucian
writings is this passage, speaking of a
Prince who applied himself to govern
well: "He began by putting his house
in good order. His chief care was to
regulate his conduct. Ho applied him
self, above all, to rectify his inclina
tions. He labored very much to invig
orate his resolutions.
In order to
strengthen his resolutions lie strove to
establish his thoughts. Finally, to es
tablish his thought, he aspired to
reasoning, even of the primal origin and
final end of nil creatures, and formed to
himself a clear idea. In effect, the clear
idea of the origin and end of all
tores established his thoughts,
thoughts being established,
strengthened his resolutions. His reso
lutions being confirmed, these served to
rectify his inclinations. His inclina
tions being corrected, these served to
regulate his conduct. His conduct
being rightly ordered, it was easy
to put liis house in good order.
The good order reigning in his house
facilitated the good administration
his States.
< 1 n ■ ; i -

well-governed, gave tone to the whole
Empire, and virtue was made to ilour

ence of one man.
sage gives this current proverb:
Empire, the State, the family,
root of the Empire is in the State; the
root of tho Stato is in the family; the
root of the family is in the person."
But it was never thought by these sages
that tho head person, whether of the
family or of the State, should merely
exert his will, hut should contemplate
tho nature of the law, which is above all
persons alike, but
through the will of the best. Therefore
the Emperor's dress in olden times was
covered with figures of the sun, moon,
dragons, insects, features of nature,
mountains, rivers, to signify that tho
Governor ought to be like all natural
powers, good amj
influence of agreat person goes far, be
cause he comes to greatness by the steps
which are set by the sage in admirable
order. The reason about tho origin and
the end of all creatures is to exercise the
mind on the two mightiest of all ideas,
those, namely, of morals and religion,
for religion reasons of whence we come,
and morals reason of the end or aim of
our coming. Such reasoning estab
lishes our thoughts, because it brings
to a center, whence we can observe cor
rectly the secret of the way of heaven
and earth. Says Confucius: "The secret
of the way of heaven and earth is that
they are one, and without doubleness."
The Prince's thoughts being established,
this strengthened his resolutions," for
fine thoughts are like great company;
and who can live with great company
without gathering strength throughout?
Moreover, if thoughts be clear.y estab
lished, then duty becomes clear, by which
the writ will be exercised to attempt the
duty. By this the inclinations will be
rectified; for by a long triumph of will
or resolution, virtue is transmuted into
nature or habit. Habit is what we have;
and that virtue which is a habit is the
highest kind of virtue, for it is goodness
which lias become ourselves. It is a
plain and easy consequence that
rected inclinations regulated the Prince's
conduct; for his acts then had free
course from a good aud open fountain
in himself. So progresses freedom, ac
cording to Heget's great account of lib
erty—rtne_ greatest that was ever given—
"the spirit s realization of its own na
ture." "If there be virtue," says an
ancient Chinese poem, "what need of
laws? I have heard it said that when
kingdoms were about to go down, they
had many laws." The next step is that
the Prince's "conduct being rightly
dored, it was easy to put his house in
good order." This followed because ex
ample is so strong a force. Confucius
has it another way elsewhere: "Let
there be men taught by means of the
ruler's character, and the Government
will flourish; but without men, the
government ceases." Precept is but
utterance, but example is the power
which the utterance signifies. From
the ruler's own house being in good
order, followed the extension of virtue
through other households, until all
the States and the Empire
itself were flourishing. This is the
leaven hidden in the measure of meal,
which signifies the reproductiveness of a
little good till the whole mass he lifted.
But is not also .the power of bad infec
tion great? Truly, it is so. Bad things
spread like disease. Depraved example
depraves. Yet who ever heard any one
speak of the reproduetivenoss of the
bad? For if the bad tended by nature to
reproduce itself, of necessity it would
be permanent and pervasive forever,
since 'from countless ages it was first
upon the ground, by reason of the low
order of life primitively out of which
Egypt God has called his son. In sum,
and for our guidance, each one lias his
own opportunity to do well that tho
good may abound; and the path is plain
from serious thinking to good govern
ment and to the diffusion t her col "He
does best for the good of the world who
lives nobly in his own house." If eaeli
one only rule himself well, it is hard to

C °Ä « , „
V\ hile there can hardly be two opin
ions as to the propriety of such a ceie
bration, with a special and fitting recog
nition of tlie crowning passage in the
career of its central fnmre, there will of
course be a diversity of views as to the
precise form a memorial observance of
this chai noter should assume, and tho a
detads by which it should be marked,
All must agree, however, that to ade
quateto symbolize and properly perpetn
ate the sentiment which prompts the
proposed celebration, something noble
m conception and permanent in eliarac
ter is necessary. Naturally tlie popular
mind will turn first to a monumental
structure, of some form or other, and
the voioe of the country, oould it find
expression, would 'doubtless favor the
ereition at the National oapital, by the
direct action of Congress, of a sculp
tured group which would portray the
form and features of Columbus, and at
the same time tell, through the medium
of suitable emblematic accessories, the
story of his marvelous voyage and its
unmatched outcome—and the thought
would fiatuvally follow of course that
the structure should be completed and
dedicated witli due ceremonial honors
on the quadrennial anniversary of the
event it is designed to commemorate.
It may and no doubt will be said that
in the matter of erecting monuments
and statues the country has of late years
moved somewhat too fast and with too
little regard for tho unities of art and
history. This is in a sense unfortunate
ly too true. But surely no one can pre
tend that as a people wo have been too
hasty in the recognition of Columbus
and his achievements, nor will any one
be likely to say that they should not be
recognized in the most imposing and
enduring manner possible. In this
spect the United States appears at, great
disadvantage when compared with other
countries whose obligation is at least no
greater, and whose ability, to fitly ex
press it, is certainly much less. The
Republic of Mexico, for example, has
already erected in her capital city a
massive and handsome sculptured group
in honor of the hardy and adventurous
sailor. His bronze effigy adorns the
port of Aspinwall in the United States
of Colombia. The city of his birth has
fitly acknowledged the luster conferred
upon her by lier illustrous son in the
erection of an elaborate and beautiful
marble statue, with ■subordinate figures,
in one of Iter most prominent squares.
Barcelona, where Columbus made re
port of his discoveries to his royal
patrons, lias also paid him suitable hon
ors by costly memorial structures. In
other cities in Italy and Spain, and in
some also in the new world, has his
memory been similarly honored, many of
the testimonials being imposing and
costly, rather less striking and expen
sive, but all conceived ana executed in
the most liberal spirit of graceful ap
preciation. Yet the people of the United
States have been silent and idle all these
years. Shall it longer bo said, to their
shame, that they are too busy with other
things or too niggardly to properly hon
or the memory of the man to which so
much is due ?—Washington Star.

INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.
The Development of the Great Northwest
and Extension of Water-Ways.
The people of the Northwest have in
view certain gigantic projects which
would greatly advantage trade if they
were consummated. It is proposed that
an artificial river, two hundred feet
wide, shall be constructed, which shall
run front Chicago southwest to the
Illinois. This would practically unite
the Mississippi and Lake Michigan. Then,
again, there is talk of turning the trade of
the Canadian northwest, southward, to
the United States, by constructing a
canal to connect Lake Winnipeg with
our lake system. The Bed River of the
North, which forms the boundary be
tween Minnesota and Dakota, and which
runs north into Lake Winnipeg, is navi
gable from Fargo, if not from Brecken
ridge. A vessel would go west from
Lake Superior by the St. Louis River,
cross over tlie divide to the Mississippi
River, follow that river up stream one
hundred and fifty miles, cross over to Red
Lake River, and go west on that to the
Red River at Grand Forks, D. T. On
this route a waterway requiring less
than fifty miles of artificial canal
could be constructed,
make a channel with six feet of
water, which would connect the Mis
sissippi with the lake system and con
nect both the lake systems with Lake
Winnipeg, and the whole of the Sas
katchewan and Hudson Bay country.
This scheme contemplates the uniting
of three basins, that of Lake Superior,
of the Upper Mississippi, and of the
Winnipeg River and Lake. It will cost
about $8,000,000 to construct the canal,
which will be about as long as the Erie
Canal in New York. There is no doubt,
as our population moves westward, that
the demand upon our Government will
become imperative to improve tlie
waterways at tlie Nation's expense. The
union of tlie great lake system of the
Northwest, including, of course, tho
great lakes of the Dominion with the
Mississippi, would greatly advantage
the trade which is building up our sea
coast cities. The Canadian Pacific Rail
way has been completed. It practically
makes a new line between the Atlantic
and the Pacific Oceans. The develop
ment of the Northwest has only just
commenced, and the next few years will
see a mighty emigration to those distant
regions which, only a few years back
wore deemed uninhabitable because too

The Preeious Gems Owned by Mrs. Stan

Few, even among tho royal families of
Europe, have more valuable diamonds
than Mrs. Stanford, wife of Senator
Stanford, of California,
speak authoritatively says her diamonds
are valued at $1,000,000.. Her husband
bought four sets of diamonds for her
when the valuables of Queen Isabella, of
Spain, were sold in Paris and paid up
wards of $600,000 for the four. One
set iä of tlie 6tones known as "blue dia

another has pink rays in its stones; the

especially since the death of her only
son. whom she idolized. On one occa
sion, before his death, she wore nearly
all her jewels at once. It was when
a dinner was given herself and her hus

Now York. She wore a black tulle
dress, embroidered in silver, and its
draperies were clasped with ornaments
made of her diamonds, which she had
