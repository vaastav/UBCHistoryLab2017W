THE GREAT BAZAAR IN
FREEV1LLE.
They were going to have a !;. iac in
that town. There was a good deal of
distress among the poor, lor the panic
came, and hard times came, and some
manufacturers failed, and those who
did not reduced their working force
and a great many operatives were out
of employ, and were wanting help.
Economy and retrenchment were the
order of the day. The ladies, some of
them, did their own sewing. Some did
with but one servant : some did with
out any. They kept their daughters
out of school to retrench school ex
penses, and the academy dismissed one
teacher, a young lady with an invalid
mother. The ladies who kept house
managed very closely indeed, and de
served much credit. Mrs. Millyuu con
cluded not to buy the ten-dollar silk
she longed for, and took one for four.
Even more, she got a friend to smug
gle it from Europe, aud it cost even
less.
Everybody said : 'What a good exam
ple of economy Mr?. Millyun sets us!
There it is not at all necessary, only it
makes it easier for us to do it who are
obliged to do it.'
But Mrs. Jones, the dressmaker,
missed the patronage of Mis. Millyun,
and thought that her work, which had
always been good enough before, was
good enough now. But there was no
use to employ so many hands if she
was not going to have the best custom,
and all of it, too. So two of her sewing-girls
were paid off weeks before the
usual dull season ; and even then it was
not easy, with her sick husband and
lame little boy, to bring her profits up
to the expense point, let alone saving
anything.
Then J udge Rochester set an exam
ple of economy. His haru needed re
pairs; but although material was low
ana labor plenty, it was no time to
have extra expenses; so he let it go.
So poor Dufftale's little boy had no
overcoat, and staid out of school. It
soon became obvious that something
would have to be done for the poor to
keep the wolf from their doors, and
'the bazaar' was the talk of everybody.
The tender glow of benevolence per
vaded society. Judge Rochester gave
fifty dollars, with a warm feeling
around his heart, that did him credit.
Mrs. Millyun gave a hundred toward
paying expenses of getting it up ; and
so on through society.
The young ladies worked early and
late over fancy work and the pretty
costumes in which they were to ap
pear at the bazaar. Tin- wisest econ
omy was practiced. Everybody did
everything herself that could be Anne
by unprofessional hands; and when
necessity called in skilled labor, it was
always expected that a handsome de
duction should be made, as it was a
'charity.' Sometimes the employes
grumbled, but dared not offend rich
patrons ; and so they did it, even though
grudgingly.
'What a blessed thing it is,' said Mrs.
Allen, her fine eyes suffused with mois
ture, 'that we are getting on so well
with the bazaar! Everybody seems so
willing. Thus, Mrs. Johnson finds
time to help us, even with her seven
children; and Mrs. Tribolite has lent
ns her grandmother's brocade for our
'Marie Antoinette ;' and Mrs. Millyun
has given much to bear our expenses.
We shall not be obliged to hire any
thing done scarcely !'
'Humph !' said Miss Mary Bryant,
who was Mrs. George Allen's single
sister, and had five thousand a year of
her own, and no questions asked. As
1 said before, 'Humph!' said Mary Bry
ant 'Who makes the coffee this year?
she asked.
'Oh, we are going to do that our
selves. Mrs. O'Lay asked us two dol
lars a night, and we are going to save
that, and Mrs. Browu said she would
doit.'
'I'll see to the coffee,' remarked Miss
Mary Bryaut, dryly.
'What! you make coffee? What did
you say about cooking yesterday ?'
Not at all. I'm going to pay Nora
O'Lay two dollars a night for coffee
and frying oysters. Her husband is
oat of work, and she has six children.
For the four nights of the bazaar it
will be quite a lift, and she will come
'in at the death' and help clear up.'
'Well, of course, if you pay out of
yeur own pocket, it is nobody's busi
ness, but the Relief Society won't pay
any bills.'
'Generally speaking, I pav my own,'
said Miss Bryant. 'What are the girls
going to make, this afternoon, when
they come here ?'
'Dress dolls. There's a great deal
made on dolls, if you understand iu
If you dress them cheaply and showily,
and sew on the clothes, you more than
quadruple the cost in the profit. Don't
you see?'
'I understand. I was sacrificed to
such dolls in my childhood. Flimsy
tarletan and spangles, and to cut a
titch was to sacrifice a whole wardrobe.
And the doll had on nothing to speak
of during the rest of her natural exis
tence. Do these young ladies pn pose
to immolate the juveniles also on the
altor of economy f
What a queer girl you are ! I don't
know what yon mean! Of course

they want to make all they can for the
bazaar. But here comes the first of
them, while we are talking, aud here
is Mrs. Johnsons man with the dolls
u a clothes-basket!'
lntruth.it was a pretty, a kindly
sight to see the girls gathered together
in Mii. Allen's pretty rooms. Girls
are so pretty in themselves that it
don't mutter what they do; they ar
always the nicest of all things to look
at. But to-day they meant business.
Thtrd were bright, experienced ones
who cut, iudustrious ones who sewed,
and ignorant ones who botched, and
idle ones who shirked, and busybodies
who inspected but did not work, as al
ways iu such affairs. Miss Bryant
came in while they were the busiest,
with her walking-dress on, and the
brightest of smiles on her face.
'Well, girls, how many have 1 got to
dress ?'
'Just as many as you please. There,s
a hundred here, and each of us can
dress oue nicely this afternoon,' said
the pretty dolls'-ehair girl.
That's only twenty. Well, I'll dress
fifty.'
Fifty dolls! O Mis3 Bryant, you
are too good !' And a buzz of approba
tion ran through the crcle.
No, I'm not. Fifty dolls isn't much
to dress for one's bleeding country.
Select fifty of the prettiest and largest.
Put them into the basket, and I'll call
for them in an hour or so.' And Miss
Bryant walked off.
The carriage was at the door, aud
Miss Bryant drove away in it. She
drove a long way up Washington
street, and got out at a droll little shop,
kept by an old lady in a full-bordered
cap.
It would have done your heart good
to have seen Miss Bryant tumble over
the droll little piles of goods that had
lain on the shelves so long, some of
them, that they were quite shelf-worn.
But there were remnants of silk of
bright colors, of bobbiuet lace, illusions,
edgings; summer silks in little checks,
and small remnants of lining silks;
bright merino and wool delaines, balls
of narrow ribbons, odds and ends of all
sorts and kinds. The shelves looked
quite bare when Mis3 Bryant paid the
bill, and the face of the little old lady
grew lovely to behold.
'How comes on the winter, Mrs. Haz
ard?' asked Miss Bryant.
'Freety bad, pretty bad. You see,
I'd rented my upper room to Nelly
Moore and her mother. And now she's
out of work, owing to Mrs. Jones dis
missing her extra help on account of
hard times, and I expect they'll have
to move, and then what I'll do to pay
the rent puzzles me.'
I'll just step up there,' said Miss
Bryant, just as if that was not what
she intended to do.
So, Nellie,' said Miss Bryant, 'you
are not going to be as busy as former
ly for a while. I'm ever so glad, for it
helps me out of an embarrassment.
I've got fifty dolls to dress for the ba
zaar. Of course I'm not so silly as to
do it myself. Here's the material to
dress them. Can you do it?'
'In two weeks yes. if mother will
help on the plain things. It's all hand
work mostly and takes time.'
'Well, the' are of all sizes; some of
them very handsome; some small and
easy to dresB. Now they must be hon
estly dressed, at least all the larger
ones, with the clothes to come off and
put on, just as little girls love them
best; and if you car not do it all, tell
me. Let Catharine Waters do up the
clothes that need It she Is out of
work, too and tell her to send me the
bill.'
Well, it's hard enough on her,' said
Nellie, 'but Mrs. Rochester says that
they cannot afford a laundress this
inter, and keep their cook too.'
'Humph! said Miss Rryant. 'Ill
bring you ronud the dolls before dark.'
When Miss Bryant came back she
felt for a moment as if she had missed
her way and got into a bee-hive, there
was such a busy hum.
I'm sure, 1 try to be economical,' said
one young lady, a teacher of music. I
save a dollar a weekwashing collars and
handkerchiefs, and that's what I'm go
ing to give to t '. r bazaar. I feel as if I
had earned it, almost.'
And the bazaar is to help the poor,'
said Miss Bryant, with that old smile of
hers.
'Of course.'
'What kind of a woman is your washer-woman
?'
'Oli, she's a very respectable woman,
I assure you.'
'Likely to come on the Relief Society
this winter?'
'Certainly not, if she can help it. But
she may, for all that.
'Now, my dear girl,' said Miss Bry
ant, with her dancing smile, 'don't you
think that dollar a week that you save,
at, I am sure, some inconvenience to
yourself, and I am equally certain, some
annoyance to your landlady, would
help the Relief Society more by keep
ing your washerman beyond the need
of its help, by giving her honest pay for
the only part of her work on which she
makes any real profit, than to put it in
to the soup house fund to help, you
don't know who, or how needy or de
serving they really are ? Don't yon see
that you take honest bread to give to
possible impostors ?'
'But, Miss Bryant, don't you approve
of the bazaar? Don't you think the
soup-house is a good thing?'
'Yes. the strikers think so, feeling
suae that their families will be helped
while they fight their employers. Th
froutier towns think so when they have
foreign invasions of needy adventurers.
One who has depended on the soup
house will depend again ; and you do
much to encourage vice and idleness.
No, girls! Have your bazaar. Enjoy
yourselves, and make yourselves prette
and have a good time. God bless you
all! Uut while you are doing it, dou't
discharge the music teacher and teach
the little sisters, if you can afford to
pay her, for she has a mother to sup
port, or somebody else; nor do unsuit
able work ano make yourself ill, when
the fee 'or one doctor's visit will be a
godsend to some poor woman glad of
the job. If you are rich enough to be
OWOSSO,
generous, you can be honest and help
others to be. If you economize, try to
do it all yourselt; don't crowd anoth
er's place. Don't try to teach, and take
the place of a poorer girl who could do
it just as well, or better, who lives on
it, while yououly buy ribbons with the
money.'
'But the example'
'Fudge! as Burchell says. People
who are needy don't want your exam
ple; they want your place. Your room
in the army of teachers is far better
than your company. Now there is a
large class of people bom and bred to
better days, who will grow very cold
and feel very hungry and never tel!
anybody, who will also be decent and
pinched and patient, and I hold it is the
business of good christians to help
these, aud help them with honest pay
for honest woik. aud with such timely
help, delicately offered, as will confirm
them in their own self-respect.'
This was quite a speech for Miss
Bryant. But the result was seen; for
although not nearly so many persons
'donated' work or articles, or were
asked to do so, so much was paid out
for such offices that the re were not so
very many poor folks to help that win
ter, for Freeville is only a small place,
after all.
And the youug folks had a glorious
good time, and will talk of it for yeara
to come. Harper's Bazar.
The Wrong Ashes.
He was a jolly-looking man, with a
round corporation, a burgundy-tinted
nose, and the general exterior of a con
tented mind, and as he entered the
editorial den he offered us a good cigar,
lit another, and said:
How about this local cremation
scheme ?"
'Well, how yourself?"
The fact is," said the stranger, re
flectively, ! had a pretty tough ex
perience with one of these cadaver
roasting concerns once, and I thought
mebbe you might like to make an item
of the facts so as to warn the people
here in time."
"Fire away."
'Well, you see, it was in New Or
leans. My wife died there, and as a
cremation company was having a good,
deal of a boom there just then, she
made me promise to have her spirit
sent up through their flue, as it were.
Said she thought it would be nice and
melancholy for me to carry her ashes
around with me wherever I went in a
vase you understand."
"And yon complied ?
"Why, yes. It was l er last wish,
you know, and besides I thought it
might be useful in kinder preparing her
for the here but never mind that, now.
I sent the remains round to the com
pany's office in a push-cart, got a re
ceipt, saw Marie touched off, so to
speak, and two days after that they re
turned to me a beautiful majolica jar
full of ashes, scented with forget-me-not,
and the stopper tied in with pink
ribbon."
"That was pretty."
"Yes, I was very much pleased at
first but I had to keep the bottle out of
sight after a while, thongh, because
people were all the time opening the
ar, under the impression that it con
tained preserved ginger or chow-chow,
or something."
"That must have been unpleasant."
"Unpleasant well, I should smile
I mean, I should weep. Why, actually,
one day while I was living in New
York, I came home and found a new
servant girl polishing knives with the
remains just think of it.
Terrible, sir, terrible!"
"But, what I was going to say was
this. About a year after my wife was
kindled I mean cremated I was in
New Orleans again, and I happened to
meet the superintendent of the re-rac-tory
ore I should say the corpse-burning
furnace at a banquet, and he got
so full that I had to see him home.
On the way we stopped in a place or
two for a steadier you know how it is
and the result was that he got very
communicative about his company in
fact gave the whole business away.
"Did, eh?"
"Yes, sir; he squarely owned up that
they didn't barn the bodies at all. He
said they just dropped 'em through a
hole in the bottom of the fur mice, took
'em out the back way at night, a.nd sold
'em to the medical students."
"Gracious! And the ashes."
"Mule ashes, sir; nothing but mule
ashes! They would just cut up some
old mule carcass, the superintendent
i aid, pitch in enough to make a bad
smell, and then sell the ashes to the
grief-stricken relatives at $25 a bottle.
Terrible cheeky, now; wasn't it?"
"And all this time you had H
'Had been carrying that old jar of
mule ashes all over the country. Just
imagine how mean I felt."
"You threw it away then?"
"Well no," said the widower, as he
winked a tear out of his left eyo; "the
more I studied over the mattiw-the
more I concluded that mule ashes
weren't so much out of the way after
all. You see, poor Maria was an aw
ful stubborn woman t-r-e-m-e-n-d-o-u-s
stubborn and yes, I kinder
thought mule ashes would do mighty
near as well, all things considered."
And having the resigned sigh of one
who had succeeded in bracing np un
der great sorrow, the anti-cremationist
smiled softly, lit another cigar, and
walked out. Derrick Dodd.

The President's Message
We present herewith the more strik
ing and important passages from Presi
dent Arthur s Message.
To the senate and bouse of reprepreaeutatlves
of the United States.
An appalling calamity has befallen the
American people and their chosen representa
tive since you last met in the halls where you
are now. We might else recall with unalloyed
content the rare proerity with which
throughout the year the nation has been bless
ed. Its harvests have been plenteous; Its
varied industries have thriven; the health of
Its people has tieen preserved; it has maintain
ed with foreigu government undisturbed re
latioiiH of aumity aud oeace. For these mani
festations of his favor we owe to Him who
holds our destiny iu his bands the tribute of
our greatrul devotions. To that mysterious
exercise of will which has taken from us the
lovud and illustrious citizen who was but late
ly the head of the uation , we bow in sorrow
and HiibmtRHlon. the memory of his exalte 1
character, of his noble achievements and of
his patriotic life, will be treasured forever as a
sacred possession of the whole people. The
announcement or his death drew from foreign
governments and peoples tributes of sympathy
uud sorrow which history will record as sig
nal tokens of the kiusbip nf nations and the
federation of mankind. The feeliiikr of flood
will between our government and tbat of
i i(,u Hritain was never more marked than at
present. In recognition of this pleasing fact I
directed, on the occasion of the late centennial
celebration at Yorktown, that asalute be given
to the British flag.
CUSTOMS KKVKNUK.
The revenue from cuhtoms for the past fiscal
year was $198,159,676 02, an increase of $11,
637,61 1 42 over that of tho preceding year;
$138,098,562 3D of this amount was collected
at the port of New York, leaving 60,061,113.63
as the amouut collected at all the other ports
of the country. Of this sum $47,4)77,137 63
was collected on sugar, meiado aud molasses;
$27,285,1124 78 ou wool and its manufactures,
$21,402,334 34 ou irou and steel and manufac
tures thereof; $19,038,665 81 on manufactures
of silks; $10,825,115 21 ou manufactures of
cotton; $6,469,643 '4 on wines and spirits;
making a total of revenue from these sources
or $133,058,720 81. The expenses of collection
for the past year were $6,419,845 20; au in
crease over the preceding year of $387,410 04.
Notwithstanding the increase iu the revenue
from customs over the proceeding year, the
gross vnlue of the imports, iucludiug free
goods, decreased over $25,000,000. The mark
ed decrease was in the value of manufactured
wool $14,023,082 and in that of scrap aud pig
ron $12,810,671. The value of imports of su
gar on the other baud showed an iucrease of
$7,457,474. Of steel rails $4,345,521, of bailey
$2,154,204 and of steel in I mi b, ingots, etc., $1,
620.04H. The exports contrasted with the im
ports were as follows: Domestic merchandise
$888,925,957, roreiga merchandise $18,451,30,
total $902,377,346. Imports of merchandise
$642,664,628. Excess of exports over imports
of merchandise $259,722,718, aggregate of ex
ports and imports $1,545,041,974. Compared
with the previous year there was au increase
of $66,738,688 in the value of exports of mer
chandise, and a decrease of $25,290,118 iu the
value of imports. The annual avemge of in
crease of imports of merchandise over exports
thereof for the years previous June 80, 1878,
was $104,806,922; hut for the last six years
there has been au increase of exports over Im
ports of merchandise amounting to $1,180,668,
108, au annual average of $196,778,017. The
specie value of the exports of domestic mer
chandise was $376,616,473 in 1870, and 883,
925,947 iu 1881 ; an iucrease of $307,809,474 or
13.5 per cent. The value of imports was $135
958,408 in 1870, and $642,664,628 in 1881, an in
crease of $206,708,220, or 47 per cent dunng
each year from 1862 to 1879 inclusive. The ex
ports of specie exceeded the imports. The
largsst excess of such exports over imports
was reached during the year 1864, when it
amounted to $92,280,429, but during the year
ending June 30, 1880, the imports of coin and
bulliou exceeded the exports by $75,891,391,
and during the last fiscal year the excess of
imports over exports was $91,168,650.
ABOLITION OF INTERNAL KEVENUB TAXES.
It seems to me that the time has arrived
when the people may justly demand some re
lief from their present onerouB burden, and
that by due economy iu the various branches
of the public service this may readily be afford
ed. I, therefore, concur with the secretary in
recommending the abolition or all Internal rev
enue taxes, except those upon tobacco In Its
various forms and upon distilled spirits and
fermented liquors, and except, also, the spec
ial tax upon the manufacturers of and dealers
in such articles. The retention of the latter
tax is desirable as affording the officers of the
government a proper supervision of these arti
cles for the prevention of fraud. I agree with
the secretary of the treasury that the law im
posing a stamp tax upon matches, proprietary
articles, playing cards, checks and drafts may
with propriety be repealed, and the law also
by which banks and bankers are assessed upon
their capital and deposits. There seems to lie
a general sentiment in favor of this course. In
the present condition of oar revenues the tax
upon deposits is especially unjust It was
never imposed in the country until it was de
manded by the necessities of war, and was nev
er exacted I believe in any other country even
in its greatest exigencies. Banks are required
to secure their circulation by pledging with
the treasurer of the United States bonds of the
general government The interest upon these
bonds, which at the time when the tariff was
imposed was 6 per cent, is now in most in
stances SK per cent Besides, the eutire cir
culation was originally limited by law and no
increase was allowable. When the existing
banks bad practically a monopoly of the busf
ness there was force in the suggestion that for
the franchise to the favored grantees the gov
ernment might very properly, exact a tax on
circulation, bit for years the system has been
free and the amount of circulation regulated
by the public demand. The retention of this
tax has been suggested as a means of reim
bursing the government for the expense of
printing and furnishing the circulating notes.
If the tax should be repealed it would certain
ly seem proper 10 require the national banks
to pay the amount of such expense to the
comptroller of the currency. It is perhaps
doubtful whether the immediate reduction of
the rate of taxation upon liquors and tobacco
is advisable, especially hi view of the drain
upon the treasury which must attend the pay
ment of the arrears of pensions. A compari
son, however, of the amount of taxes collected
under the varying rates of taxation which had
at different times prevailed, suggests the inti
mation that some reduction may soon be made
without a material diminution of revenue.
The tariff laws also need revision, but that a
dueiegarJ may be paid to the conflicting in
terests of our ci 1 1 .ns important chauges should
he made witb caution. If a careful revision
cannot be made at this session, a commission,
such as was lately approved by the senate, and
is now recommended by the secretary of the
treasury, would doubtless lighten the labors ot
Congress whenever this subject shall be
brought to its consideration
THE roSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The ip.it of the postmaster general is a
gratlf; ing exhibit of growth and efficiency of
the postal service.
The receipts from postage and otner ordina
ry sources during the past fiscal year were $86,
489.816 5h; the receipts from the money order
business were $295,581 89. making a total of
$86,789,899 97. The expenditure for the fiscal
vear was $69,251,786 49. The deficit supplied
out of the general treasury was $2,4V1,129 85,
or 63 per cent of the amount. The receipts
we-e $8,469,918 68 In excess of those of the
previous year, and $4,575,897 97 in excess of
the estimate made wo years ago, before the
present period of busmen prosperity had fair
ly begun. The whole number of letters mall
ed In this country In the last fiscal year exceed
ed 1,000,000,000. The registry system Is report
ed to 8 in excellent condition, having been re
modeled during the past four years with good
reatilts. The amounts of registration fees col
lected duriuur the last fiscal yeai was $712,882
20, an Increase over the fiscal year ending June
30. 1877. of $340,443 4U. Tlie entire number or
letters and packages registered during the
year was 8.338,914, of which only Z.U01
061 or lost lu transit operations of the money
order system are multiplying yearly. Under
the impulse of immigration, or the rapid devel
opment of the newer states and territories and
the consentient demand lor additional means
of inter communication and exchange, during
the uaut year, 338 additional money order urn
ces have been established, makiug a total of
5.4119111 operation at the date of this report
During the year the domestic money orders
aggregated in valueloo,07&Yr9 3o.
A modification of the system is suggested,
reducing the fees for money orders not exceed
ing $5 from 10 cents to five cents, and making
the limit $100 in place or ton.
AN INDIAN POLICY.
For the success of the efforts now making to
to introduce among the Indians the customs
aud pursuits of civilized life, and gradually
to absorb them Into the mass of our citizens,
sharing their rights and holding their responsi
bilities, there is an imperative ueed for legisla
tive action. My suggestion in that regard
will be chiefly such as has been already called
to the attention of congress and have received
to some exteut its consideration. (First) I
recommend the passage of an act making the
laws of the various states and territories appli
cable to the Indian reservations within them,
and extending the laws of the state of Arkan
sas to the portion of the Indian territory not
occupied by the fivo civilized tribes. The In
dian should receive the protection ul' the law.
He should be allowed to maintain in court his
rights of person and property. He has repeat
edly begged for this privilege. Its exercise
would be very valuable to him in his progress
toward civilization. Second, of even greater
importance is a measure which has beeu ur
gently recommeuded by my predecessors in
office and iu f urthurence of which several bills
have from time to time been introduced in both
houses of congress. The enactment of a gen
eral law permitting the allotment in severalty
to such ludians at least as desire it of a reason
able quantity of land secured to them by pat
ent and for their own protection made inalien
able from 20 to 25 years is demanded for then
present welfare and their permanent advance
ment la return for such consideration on
the part of the goverumeut there is reason to
believe that the Indians in large numbers
would be persuaded to sever their tribal re
lations and to engage at once in agricultural
pursuits if persuaded that their hunting days
were over and that is now for their best inter
ests to conform their manner of life to the
new order of things. By no greater induce
ment than the assurance of permanent title
to the soil cau they be made to eugage iu the
occupation of tilling it t he well attested re
ports of their Increasing internet in husbandly
justify the hope and belief that the enactment
of such a statute as I recommend would be at
once attended with gratifying results. A re
sort to the allotment system would have a di
rect and powerful influence in dissovlng the
tribal bond which is a prominent featuieof
savage life, and which tends bo strongly to
perpetuate it Therefore 1 advise a liberal ap
propriation for the support of Indian schools,
because of my confident belief that such a
course is consistent witb the wisest economy.
Even among the most uncultured Iudian
tribes there 1b known to be a general and ur
gent desire on the part of the chiefs and older
members for the education of their childreu.
It is unfortunate, in view of this fact that
during the past year the means which have
beeu at the command of the interior depart
ment tor the purpose of Indian instruction
have proved to be utterly inadequate. The
success of the schools w Inch are in operation
at Hampton, Carlisle and Forest Grove,
should not only encourage a more generous
provision for the support or those institutions,
but should prompt the establishment of others
of a similar character. They are doubtless
much more potent for good than the day
schools upon the reservation, as the pupils are
altogether separated from the surroundings of
savage life and brought into coustant contact
with civilization.
POLYGAMY IN UTAH.
There are many other phases of this subject
which are of great interest but which cannot
beiucluded within the becoming limits of tins
communication. They are recorded ably in the
reports of the secretary of the interior aud the
commissioner of Indian affairs. For many
years the executive iu his annual message to
congress has urged the necessity of stringent
legislation for the suppression or polygamy in
the territories and especially in the territory of
Utah. The existing statute for the punishment
of this odious crime so revolting to the moral
and religious seme of Christianity has been
nerlsteully aud COntemntUOUSJV violated ever
since its enactment. Indeed, in spite of com
mendable effoits on the part of the authorities
who represent the United States in that terri
tory, the law has in very rare instances been
enforced, and for a cause to which reference
will presently he made is practically a dead
letter. The fact thut adherents of the Mormon
'hunch, which rests upon polygamy as its cor
ner stone, have recently been peopling in large
numbers Idaho, Arizona and other of our
western territories is well calculated to excite
the liveliest interest and apprehension. It im
poses upon congress and the executive the du
ty of enlisting against this barbarous system
all the power which under the constitution and
law they can wield for its destruction. Kefet -
encehas been frequently rrade to the obstacles
which the United States officers have round tn
their efforts to uunisb violations ol law. Prom
inent among the obstacles is the difficulty of
procuring legal evidence sufficient to warrant
a conviction even n the case of the most no
torious offenders. Your attention is called to
the opinion of the supreme court of the United
States explaining its judgment of reversal in
the case of Milep, who has tieen convicted ef
bigamy in Utah. The court refers to the fact
tbat the secrecy attending the celebration of
marriages in tbat territory makes that part of
polygamy very difficult, and the propriety Is
suggested of modifying that law of evidence
which now makes a wile incompetent 10 testi
fy against her husband. This suggestion is ap
proved. I recommend also the passing of an
act providing .that in the territories of the
United States the fact that a woman has tieen
married to a person charged with bigamy shall
not disqualify her from appear
ing here as a witness upon bis trial for
that ofTense. 1 runner recommend legislation
by which eny person solemnizing a marriage
in any of the territories shall he required, un
der stringent penalties for neglect or refusal,
to file a contract of such marriage In the su
preme court of the terrltoiy, unless congi.'ss
devise other practicable measures for obviating
the difficulties which have hitherto attended
the efforts to suppress this iniquity. I assure
you of my determined purpose to co opernte
with you in any lawful and decreet measures
which may be proposed to that end.
THE CIVIL SERVICE.
Tn mv InttAr neCAntlner tnn nomination for
the vice presidency I stated that in my judg
ment "bo man should be an incumbent of an
office, the duties of which he is for any cause
unfit to perform, or who is lacking in mai anu
liv fldAlltr. or iniecrilv which a runner admin-
istrat'on of the office demands." But opinion
has heeti widely divided upon me wisuom or
various reformatory schemes which have leeu
suggested and of certain proposed regulations
crnvurntni Mm nnonirit merits t . the public of
fice. The efficiency of such regulations has
been distrusted mainly because iney nuveseeni
ed to exalt mere educational and abstract tests
uiime irnnnrnl business canaci: v and even sue
cial fitness for the particular v ork in hand. It
seems to me that the rules mai snou'u u ap
nliod the mnnnffHinent of public service may
properly conform in the main to such as regu
late the condition of successful private busi
ness. The original appointments should be
based upon ascertained fitness. The tenure of
office should be stable. Positions of responsi
bility should, so far as practicable, be filled by
the promotion of worthy and efficient officers.
NO. 31.
The Investigation of all complaints, the pun
ishment of all official conduct should be
prompt, and thorough. The views expressed
in the foregoing letter are those which will
govern my administration of the executive of
fice. They are doubtless shared by all intelli
gent and patriotic citizens, however divergent
in their opinions as to the best methods of put
ting them into practical operation. For ex
ample the assertion that original appointments
should be based upon ascertained fitness is not
open to dispute; but the question how in prac
tice such fitness can tie most effectually ascer
tained is one which has for years excited inter
est and discussion. The measure which, with
slight variations in its details, has lately beeu
urged upon the attention of congress aud the
executive, has as its principal feature the
scheme of competitive examination. Save for
certain exceptions which need not be here
specified, this plan would limit admission to the
service only to its lowest grade, Hnd would ac
cordingly demand that all the vacancies in
high, r positions should be filled by promotion
alone. In these particulars it is in conformity
with the existing civil service system of Great
li itain, and, indeed, the success which has at
tended the system in the couutry of Its birth is
the strongest argument which has been urged
for its adoption here. The facts should not,
however, be overlooked that there are certain
features of the English system which have not
geuerally been received with favor in this
couutry among the foremost advocates ofe
ivil seerAlv rotor in.
FOREION RELATIONS.
Save for correspondence, to which I sbal
lefer hereafter, iu relatiou to the proposed
canal across the isthmus of Pauama, little has
occurred worthy of mention in tne diplomatic
relations of the two countries. Early in the
year the Fortune May claims were satisfacton
ly settled by the British government paying
in full the sum of $15,000, most of which has
beeu already distributed. As the terniB of set
tlfiueut included compensation for injuries
suffered by our fishermen at Ashee Bay, there
has beeu relumed i nun the gross award a sum
which Is deemed adequate for those claims.
By recent legislation onerous finee have been
imposed upon American shipping in Spanish
aud colonial ports for slight Irregularities in
manifests. The tests on the case of hardships
are especially worthy of attention. The bark
Masonic, bouud for Japan, entered Manilla lu
distress and is there sought to be confiscated
under the Spanish revenue laws for an alleged
shortage in her transhipped cargo. Though
effoits for her relief have thus far proved un
availing, it is expected that the whole will be
adjusted in a friendly spirit
Our agents iu Switzerland have been in
structed to protest against the conduct of the
authorities of certain communes in permitting
the emigration to this country of criminals and
other objectionable persons. Several such per
sons, through the co-operation of the commis
sioners of emigration at New York, have beeu
sent back by the steamers which brought them.
A continuance of this course may prove a
more effectual remedy thau diplomatic remon
strance.
Treaties of commerce and navigation and for
the regulation of consular privileges have been
concluded with Roumania and Servia since
their admission into the family of European
states.
I regret that the commercial interests be
tween the United States and Brazil, from
which great advantages were honed a year ago,
have suffered from the withdrawal of the
American lines of communication between the
Brazilian ports and our own.
A question has arisen in lelatlon to the exer
cise in Japan of the judical functions confer
red upou our miuisteiB and consulsThe indict
ments, trial, and conviction, in the couBular
courts at Yokohama of John Ross, a merchant
seaman ou board au American vessel, have
made it necessary for the goverumeut to In
stitute a careful examination Into the nature
aud methods of this jurisdiction. It appeared
that Ross was regularly shipped under the flag
of the United States, but was by birth a Brit
ish subject- My predecessor felt it bis duty to
maintain the position that during his service
as a regularly shipped seaman ou board an
American merchant vessel, Hose was subject
to the laws of that service, and to the jurisdic
tion of the Uuited States consulate authorities.
THE PANAMA CANAL.
The Questions growing out of the proposed
inter-oceanic water way across the Isthmns of
Panama are of grave national importance.
This government has not been unmindful of
the solemn Obligations imposed upou it by its
compact of 1846 with Columbia as the indepen
dent and soverign mistress of the country cross
ed by the canal, aud has sougut to render
them effective by fresh engagements with the
Columbian republic looking to le'ir practical
execution. The negotiations to thl s end, after
they had reached what appeared to be a mutu
ally satisfactory solution were met In Columbia
by a disavowal of the powers winch its envoy had
assumed and by a proposal for renewed nego
tation ou a modified basis. Meanwhile, this
government learned that Columbia h.d propos
ed to the European powers to join iu a guaran
tee or the neutrality or the proposed r mama
canal, a guarantee which would be in direct
coutraveutlou of our obligation as the sole
guaranteer of the integrity or Columbian terri
tory and of the neutrality of the canal itself.
My lamented predecessor felt it his duty to
place before the European powers the reasons
which make the prior guarantee of (he United
States indispensable, and for which the inter
jection of any foreigu guarantee might be re
garded as a superfluous aud unfriendly act
l''oi seeing the probable reliance of the British
government on the provisions of the Claytou
Bulwer treaty of 1850, as affording room for a
share in the guarantees which the United
States covenanted witb Columbia four years
he; i; e, I have not hesitated to supplement
the action of my predecessor by proposing to
her Majesty's government the modification of
that lustrument and the abrogation of such
clauses thereof as do not comport with the ob
ligations of the United States toward Colum
bia, or with the vital needs of the two friendly
parties to the compact
INTERNATIONAL RULES.
I invite your attention to the propriety of
adopting the new international code of rules
for the prevention of collision on the high seas
and of conforming the domestic legislation of
the United States thereto, so that no confusion
may arise from the application of conflicting
rules iu the case of vessels of different nation
alities meeting in tidal waters. These Inter
national rules differ but slightly from our
own. They have been adopted by the n.tvy
department for the governance of the war
ships of the United States on the high seas and
in foreign waters, and through the action of
the state department in disseminating the rules
and lu acquainting shipmasters with the option
of conforming to them withont the jurisdic
tional waters of the Uuited States they are now
very generally known and obeyed.
THE SIGNAL SERVICE.
The separate organizatlou of .the signal ser
vice is needed by the secretary of war, and a
full statement or the arrangement of such per
manent organization is presented in the report
of the chis signal officer.
IMPROVEMENT OF RIVERS AND HARRORS.
The report of the chief of engineers furnish
en a detailed account of the operations for the
improvement of rivers and harbors. I com
mend to your attention the suggestions con
tained In this report lu regard to the connec
tion of our fortifications, especially our coast
defences and recommeud au increase of the
strength of the engineers battalion by which
the efficiency of our torpedo system would be
improved. I call yonr attention to the remarks
upon the improvement of the south pass of the
Mississippi river.
NEEDS OF THE NAVY.
The report of the secretary of the navy ex
hibits the condition of that branch of the ser
vice and presents valuable suggestions for Its
improvement I call your special attention
also to the appended report of the advisory
board which has convened to devise suitable
measures tor increasing the efficiency of the
navy, and particularly to the report as to the
character and number of vessels necessary to
put It on a footing commensurate with the
necessities or tne government, i cannot too
strongly urge upon vou my conviction that
every consideration of national safety, econo
my and honor imperatively demands a thor
ough rehabilitation of our navy, with a full ap.
precision of i he fact tbat compliance with the
sugg stlons of the head of that department
and of the advisory boaru must involve a large
expenditure or the public moneyr. I eaimst
ly recommend such appropriations as will ac-coinpli.-h
in the end what seems to be so de
sir tble. Nulling ran be more inconsistent
witb true public economy than the withhold
ing of means uectsaary to accomplish objects
intrusted, by the constitution, to the national
legislature. One of these objects, and one
which is of paramount Importance, is declared
by our fundamental law to be the provision
for the "common defease." Surely nothing is
more essential to the defense of the United
States and all the people than the efficiency of
our navy. we have far many
years maintained with foreign government-
relations of honorable peace,
and that such relations may be permanent in
desired by every patriotic citizen of the repub
lic. Uut ir we read the teachings of history
we shall not forget that In the life of every
nation emergencies may arise when a resort to
arms can alone save it from dishonor. No dan -ger
from abroad now threat ens this people,
nor have we any cause to distrust the friendly
professions of other governments, but for
avoiding as well as repelling dangers that
may threaten us in the future we must be pre
Eared to face any policy which we think wise
adopt; we must be ready to defend our har
bors against aggression, to protect hv the dis
tribution of our ships of war over the highways
of commerce the varied Interests of our foreign
trade and the person and property of oar citi
zeuB abroad, to maintain everywhere the honor
of our flag and the distinguished position
which we may rightfully claim among the na
tions of the world.
THE MERCHANT MARINE.
The continued decline of the merchant ma
rine of the United States is to be greatly de
plored. In view of the fact that we furnish so
large a jTopoition of the freight, of the com
mercial world, and tbat onr shipments are
steadily and rapidly increasing, it Is a cause of
surprise that not ul is our navigation inter
est diminishing, it is less than when our ex
ports an.1 imports were not half so large as
now, either iu bulk or in value. There must
be some peculiar hindrance to the development
of this interest or the enterprise and energy of
American mechanics and capitalists would
have kept this country at least abreast of our
rivals in the friendly contest for oceau suprem
acy. The substitution of iron for woodmd of
steam for sail bnve wrought great revolutions
in the carrying trade of the world, but these
changes could not have been adverse to Amer
ica, if we had given to our navigation interest
a portion of the aid and protection which have
been so bestowed upon our manufactures. I
commend the whole subject to the wisdom of
congress with the suggestion tbat no question
of greater magnitude or farther reaching Im
portance can eugage tbelr attention.
PRESIDENTIAL INARILITY.
Questions which concern the very existence
of the governmeut and the liberties of the peo
ple were suggested by the prolonged illness of
the late President and his consequent incapac
ity to pei f. n in the functions of his office. It
is provided by the second article of the consti
tution in the fifth clause of its first section,
tbat in case of the removal of the President
from office, or of his death, resignation or ina
bility to discharge the powers and duties of
his offic", the same shall devolve on the Vice
President. What is the intention of the consti
tution in its specification of inability to dis
cbarge the powers, and duties of said office as
one of the contingencies which calls the Vice
President to the exercise of Presidential func
tions? Is the inability limited in lis nature to
long continued intellectual incapacity, or has
it a broader import? What must be its extent
and duration? How must its existence be ee
tablished? Has t he President whose inabil
ity is the subject of inquiry, any voice in deter
mining whether or not it exists or is the
decision of that momentous and
delicate question confided to the Vice-President
or is it contemplated by the constitution
tbat congress should provide by law precisely
wbat should constitute inability, and how and
by what tribunal or authority it should be as
certained? If the inability proves to be tem
porary in its nature, and during its continuance
the Vice President lawfully exercises the
fuuctions of the executive, by wbat tenure
does he hold his office? Does be continue as
Presideut for the remainder of the four years'
term, or would the elected President if his In
ability should cease iu the interval, be empow
ered to resume his office, and if, having uch
lawful authority, he should exercise iu would
the Vice President be thereupou empowered
to resume his powers and duties as Bucb? I
cannot deubt tbat these important questions
win receive your early and thoughtful consid
eration.
Deeply depressed with the gravity of the re
sponsibilities which have so unexpectedly de
volved upon me, It will be my constant purpose
to co-operate with you in such measures as
will promote the glory of tie country and the
prosperity of its people.
