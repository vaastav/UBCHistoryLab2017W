"J,i|ual suffrage was the one ques
tion upon which all parties were
agreed In the last campaign, their dif-.
ferenees relating only to the method
of securing the form. While the
Pemocrn 11 <? and Itepublican parties
failed to commit themselves to a na

recognize the fact that a national
amendment will come when the reform
Is adopted in a suilicient number of
States to make its adoption by the
nation prohiihle. The Democratic
party, which builds upon a foundation
which Is essentially ethical ?the doc
trine of brotherhood?has that reason
for welcoming the co-operation of
women In the work which lies before
the party, and it has especial reason
for regarding 'woman suffrage with
favor at this lime, since the influence
of the women in the close States was
sufficient to determine the result.
"I have saivcd for the last the reform
which will involve the fiercest contest,
and which will, when accomplished.
bring the largest benefit. namely,
abolition of the saloon.
"The Pemocraitic party, having won

having received the support of nearly
all the Prohibition States and the

"The argument that national pro
hibition is an assault upon the rights
of the States has little weight in the
Staites which have already adopted pro
hibition. and its weight in the nation
will therefore diminish as the num- i
her of prohibition Staites increases.!
The Democratic party is the party of
the people and the home is the people's

COMIM.AINTS AIIOIT COAL
PltlCKS HKINU ADVAM KD
Complaint* have reached the depart
ment that coal prices were advanced
recently largely because of the activ
ity of certain independent dealers, not
heretofore in business, who are re
ported to have contracted with the
chief coal companies for virtually
their entire unsold output for the
winter. It was charged that these
dealers, scenting fat proilts. had tried
to corner the available supply, and
thus forced up prices.
These and other complaints under In
vestigation will he considered with a
view to prosecution if warranted un
der Federal laws, which require that
the supplies in question must have
been in or for interstate commerce.
Proposals in Congress looking to a
remedy for the problem ranged from
a discussion of the omnibus hatcheries
bill, which would provide for lish
hatcheries in twenty States, to a dec
laration by t 'bait-man Henry, of the
Rules Committee, after a conference
with the President, that he thought
Congress would conduct an Investiga
tion of the high cost of living. They
embraced resolutions by Representa
tives Borland and "Mil. providing for
general investigations; a resolution by
Campbell, of Kansas, which would pro
vide for an embargo on boots, shoes
and manufactured leather goods, and a
bill by Representative Sabath, of Illi
nois. designed to aid Federal employees ?
to meet the situation by increase from
10 to i*"i per cent the salaries of those i
earning up to S1.S00 annually.

"In our efforts to establish an effici

wrote to the President, "we llnd our
selves embarrassed by several condi
tions which are of a national character
anil cannot be satisfactorily controlled
by State regulation."
The commissioner enumerated these 1
conditions as follows:
Rack of definite and uniform stand

lack of standard and uniform pack- ,
ages for the transportation and sale i
of food products; difficulty and expense ?

The present administration, the ,\t

more effective dissolutions of monopo

solicitous to avoid prosecutions for

During the year ten of these cases have
been finally determined, and of thirty
six cases now pending, fifteen. Includ

Of those disposed of. one was the caso
of the National Register Company,
, whose conviction was set aside by liie
Court of Appeals, annulling two counts
of the indictment and construing the
1 third so as to make a successful re
trial impossible, and the Attorney

The report says considerable progress
has been made in the government suits
against the Southern Pacific Railroad
affecting title to oil lands. The lands !
; involved in the litigation. Mr. Uregory
says, aggregate over 150,OrtO acres, said
to be worth $500,000,000.
Enforcement of the white slave
traffic law led to 494 indictments, .134
convictions, fifty-four cases nolle
pressed, forty-five acquittals and 400
cases still pending. Since the law was
passed there have been 1,537 convic
tions. sentences aggregating -.408 years
and fines totaling SITi'.OCO. Legisla
tion is urged to enable wives to testify
against their husbands
Despite country-wide investigation of
reported breaches of neutrality and
other criminal acta arising from the
war, many of the cases were found to
have violated State rather than Federal
laws. Most of the plots involved dif
ficulty in obtaining evidence. The
Mexican situation has led to thirteen
indictments, affecting sixty persons, of
whom twenty-five have been convicted.
"Mere plotting alone," says the re
port. "is not criminal. Planning or
preparation in this country of a mili
tary expedition designed to start from
a point outside this country seems not
to he forbidden by law. Hence many
activities which produce constant fric
tion cannot at present be reached."

A noiltrat diplomat who saw the re
moval of flenernl t'orakas. head of the
Venifcelos recruiting bureau. and tho
former chief of police, Maroudas. from
the Parliament llott.se, described their
condition as pitiable. General I'orakas
looked as though he had heert almost
killed. According to the description,
blood poured from his head. Ills
clothes had been lorn, his eyes wore,
blackened and swollen from blows re
ceived during his examination before
the magistrate. His companions were
in even worse condition. Photographs,
now in the hands of tho British, were
taken of these men.
Another prominent Venisselist was
shot down In cold blood, while Mr.
Rendel. a British diplomat whose house
was attacked, says ho saw another
prominent man named Descali repeat
edly clubbed with rifles in the hands
of regulars, and kicked in the body
until he fell unconscious. Mr. Kendel
also reports that while ho was in Jail
he saw a number of Venlzelists kicked
and clubbed.
The dispat.-hes state that the corre
spondents have impartial testimony to
tho effect that no sliots were fired from
Mr. Renders house, which was not only
llred into by regular soldiers, but that
the soldiers foreell their way into the
house to the room of Mr. Rondel's
sister, who was ill in bed.
