Aleck Devine, the editor and proprie
tor of the Billings Herald, has gone to
railroading in 8t. Paul. After designat
ing Col. Searlesas Col. Sellers at the las'
press meeting. Aleck became the victim
pf deep seated remorse, and it is thought
that it was for this unfortunate Lapsus
tinguie that he so suddenly left th

medium of a car bumper.
It is surprising that Judge Coburn,
after receiving notice through the paper»
of his suspension from < ffice, went ahead
with court business, putting Dawson
county to a needless and inexcusable ex
pense. The Judge, of course, knew that
his suspension took effect at once.
We look upon t he comments of the pres»
Of the lower country 7 as unwarranted, in
view of the fact that suspensions from
office, means to vacate forthwith.
One of the very first acts of Senato r
Vest at the opening session of the Senate
was in behalf of Montana. It was a bill
to amend the sections of the revised
statutes, relating to the Yellowstone
Park, also to provide permanent reserva
tions for the Indians in Northern Mop
tana. The latter bill contemplates the
cutting down of the vast areas now use
lesslv held by Indians, and ojiening them
to white settlers.
It is pfeasing to note that the Chron
icle has not hammered in vain at the
proposition to enlarge Ft. Ellis, also that
several of oar citizens have written to
Senators and Congressmen asking their
assistance in the matter. In the mean
while» strong petition should be sent to
our delegate requesting his assistance
and securing his approval of a scheme
that has for its end the advancement of
Bozeman and the creation of a market
for Gallatin valley produce.
It. was reported in New York last week
that the Northern Pacific had ordered
thoir workmen on the proposed branch
to.Butte via Gbrrison, to stop work,
consequently the Union Pacific had also
ordered their men on the branch to
Helena to quit. In the meanwhilt
Agent Stokes publicly announces that
the Northern Pacific have only tempor
arily suspended operations, awaiting
warm weather, and a gentleman jus>
from Darling informs us that from thre«
to five hundred men are busily engaged
there in grading the Union Pacifi«
branch. The month of February will
probably tell the tale, when the present
pooling arrangement between the com
panies will cease.
. William Henry YtmiferOilt, of New
York, the richest man in America and
the wealthiest in the world, died Sud
denly snd painlessly at his residence on
the 8th inst., of apoplexy or cerebral
hemorrhage, aged Bixty-four years and
seven months. Mr. Vauderbilt's fortune
a gn at part of which was inherited, i.
eatimsted at $21)0,1)00,000. His iuconn
was calculated as to) ows : 12,372,000 a
year from government bonds, $7 305,00t
from railway stocks, $576 605 from mis
cellaneous securities ; total, over $10,00» -
000 a year, or $28,000 a day, $1,200 an
hour, or $19.75 a minute. The deceased
left a will, by which his large railroad
interests will be managed by his
sons, his confidential adviser, or some
suitable Person selected by the heirs,
w ho will do all possible to concentrât»
the vast wealth, and avoid also the pann
which would be créait d by an immedi
ate division of the stocks or their tquiva*
lent* in money.
THE MESSAGE.
Elsewhere we publish that portion of
the President's message which more
particularly interests us of the west. The
m îssage, instead of being a marvel of
brevity is unusually long, but by the
time President Cleveland has written
his eighth message, he will perhaps
hive learned that golden newspaper rule
of condensation and "Boil 'er down."
Extreme paitisan papers, auch as the
Pioneer Press join in stating that with
out a single exception, the views of the
President upon every one of the multi
tude of subjects which he touches are
wise ami sound. The document par
takes ofthat flavor which pervaded the
messages of old-time, early-day Presi
dents. It is a candid comprehensive
disquisition upon the affairs of this
country that every citisen should read.
In the matter of silver the President has
not touched the popular chord, but he
has made the strongest argument against
silver coinage that could • have been
made—an argument that will meet with
tho combined antaganisui of all Demo
crats in Congiess and all friends of the
farming and laboring classes. He re
commends (he appointment of six com
tnis-ioners, three to be chosen from
army circles, who shall investigate the
Indian question in all its details, decid
mg u|hui rruiuvirm »in* »11 piwvH<*l ij««»
lions, as their different degrees of bar
barism may prescribe. Such a commit
tee, composed of practical men, experi
em-eri with Indian affairs, with power
and well-defined duties given them by
Congress, would soon rescue our Indian
policy from the rule of injustice to both
Indian and white, into which it has
fallen. The President speaks with no
uncertain sound regarding the Mormon
question, indicating a strong desire to
see polygamy exterminated, and expres
sing a determination on his part to en
compass that end. The Chinese ques
tion he views from a standpoint of
justice to those who are in America,
ami expresses a willingness to second
am remedial measure of restriction
within the treaty limits, which Congress
in its w isdom may enact.
