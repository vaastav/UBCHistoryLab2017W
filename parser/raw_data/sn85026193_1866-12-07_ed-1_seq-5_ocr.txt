President's Message.
Message the President of the United
State for the two Houses of Congress at
the Commencement of the Second Session.
IMm Oitisxnt of tte Senate and Hwm of
Jlepronentativei :
After a brief interval the Congtesa of
the United States resumes its lfgislallve
labors. An all-wise aad merciful Provi
dence has abated the peetilcnco which
visited our shores, leaving its calamitous
traces upon some portions of onr country.
Peace, order, tranquility, and civil author
ity have been formally declared to exist
throughout tho whole of the United States.
In all of the Slates civil authority has sn
persceded the coercion of arms, and the
people, by their voluntary action, are
maintaining their governments in full ac
tivity and complcto operation. Tho en
Agreement of the laws is no longer "ob
eli acted iu any State by combinations too
powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary
oaree of judicial proceedings;" and the
ntmoslllus engendered by tea' war are
rapidly yielding to the beneficent Infla
caw of our froe institutions, and to the
kindly effects of unrestricted social and
eoramendal intercourse). An entire resto
ration of fraternal feeling must be the
earnest wish ot every patriotic heart; and
we will have accomplished our grandest
national achievement, when, forgetting
the sad events of the past, and remember
ing only their Instructive lessons, we re
mise our on ward career as a free, pros
perous and united people.
, la my message of tbe 4th of December,
tSSBj, Con cress was Informed ol the measnree
wblcb bad bean instituted by the Executive
with a vlsw to tbe gradual restoration ol the
States In which tbe insurrection occurred to
their relations with the General Government.
Provisional Governors had been appointed,
Ooaventlont called. Governors elected, Leg.
Matarea assembled, and Senators and Rep
voeenutives cbosen to the Congress ol the
Molted States. Courts had been opened for
the enforcement of laws Ions in abeyance.
Tbe blockade bad bsen removed, custom
house re-establlsbed, and tbe Internal reve
nue lawa pnt lu force, in order tbst tbe peo
ple might contribute to the national Income,
foetal operations bad been renewed, and ef
forts were being mado to restore them tos
their former condition of efficiency. The
v "States themselves had been asked to take
Part In tbe blub function of amendtnir Mia
Oonatltutlon. and ot tbns sanctioning the ex-
udcmoq 01 Airican slavery as one ot tbe
legitimate resells of oar internecine stran
gle Having progressed tbns far, tbe Eiecativo
Bepartmeut loand that it had accomplished
early all tbat was wltbln tbe scope ot Its
eooalitullanal authority. One tblnar, how
ever, yet remained to be done br fore the
work of restoration conld be completed,
and that was tbe admission to Congress ol
loyal Senators and Representatives Iron tbe
States whose people had rebelled against
the lawful authority of tbe General Govern
ment. This question devolved upon the
respective Houses, which, by the Constitu
tion, are made tho Judges of the elections,
returns, snd qualifications of their own mem
bers; and Its consideration at once engaged
tbe attention of Congress.
la the meantime, the Executive Depart
mentno other pi in having been propos
ed by Congress continued its efforts to
perfect, as far as was practicable, the res
toration of the proper relations between
the citizens of the respective States, the
States, and the Federal Government, ex
tending, Irora time to time, as the publio
interests seemed to require, the judicial,
revenue, and postal systems of the coun
. try. With the advice and consent ot the
Senate, the necessary officers were appoin
ted, and appropriations made by Congress
for tho payment ot their salaries, Ibe
proposition to amend the Federal Con sti
nt iod, bobs to prevent tbe existence of
slavery within" the Uuited States or any
place subject to their Jurisdiction, was rat
ified by too requisite number of States;
and on the 18th day of December, 1805, it
was officially declared to have become
valid as a purl of the Constitution of the
United States. All of tbe States in which
the insurreo ion hd existed promptly
amended their Constitution, so as to make
them conform to the great chat ge thus
effected in tbe organic law of the land; de
clared null and void all ordinances and
liwsol secession; repudiated all pretended
dkbts and obligations created for tbe revo
. Vttionary purposes of tho insurrection; and
f -otjeedad, in good fuitb, to tlie enactmet t
f measures for tbe protection and ameli
oration, of tho colored race. Congress,
however, yet hesitated to admit any or
these States to representation; and it was
not until near the close of tbe eighth
month of the session that an exception
was made In tavor of Tennessee, by tbe
admission of her Senators and Represent
atives. I deem It a subject or profound regret that
Congress baa thai tar failed to admit to seats
loyal Senator and Representatives from tbe
ether flutes, whose inhabitants, with those
of Tennessee, had engaged lu tbe rebellion.
Tea States more than one-tourtb of tbe
wbtla Dumber remain without representa
tion; the seats of fllty members in the House
Of Representatives and twenty members in
the Senate are yet vacant not hy tbelr own
consent, not by tail ire of electljo, but by
the refusal of Congress to accept tbelr cre
dentials. Tbelr admission, it Is believed,
wonld have accomplished much towards tbe
renewal and strengthening of our rein ions
aa one people, and removed serious cause
for discontent on the part ol the Inhabitants
pt those States. It would bavo accorded
with tbe great principle enunciated lu tbe
Declaration of Independence, tbat no peo
ple ought to bear tbe burneu oftsxitlon,
Hd yet be denied tbe right of represents
tioa. It wonld have been in consonance
with tbe express provisions ol the Confu
tation, that "each State shall have at least
one Representative," and "that no Bute,
without lis consent, shall be deprived ol Its
equal suffrage In tbe Senate " - These provi
sions were intended to secure to every State,
and to tbe people ol every State, tbe right
Of representation lu each Uouaeof Congress;
ad so Important was it deemed bv tbe Irani
an of the Constitution that the equality of
tbe States io tbe Seoa'e should he preserved,
tbat not even hv an amrudm-ot ol tbe Con
stitution csu any State, without Its consent,
be denied a voice In that brauch of the Na
tional Legislature,
It la trna. It h is been assumed thai, the ex
istence of the States was terminated by tbe
rebellious acts of their lubaoitauta, aud tbat
the lusurrectloa having been suppressed,
they were tbeneelorward to be considered
merely as conquered territories. Tbe Legla
atlve, Kierotive and Judicial Departments
f tbe Government bavt, however, with
(rest distinctness and unifirm consistency,
refuaed to sanction an ursompilon so Incom
patible with the nature ot usr Republican
system, and with tbe profmed ntJete of
tbe war. Throughout the recent htgielattoa
ot Congress, the undents! 1 fet makes It
self apparent tbat these ten pt lit leal comma
allies are aothlng lose I ban Stales ol Ibis
Da loo. At tbe very cornweDoenent of tbe
rebellion, each House declared, with a aaa

tbey have, lor Judicial purpose, been divi

vided. Tbe same recognitloa appears la the
recent legislation la reference te Tennessee,
which evidently rrsts upon tbe fsct that tbe
functions of tbe But were not destroyed
by tbe rebellion, but inertly suspended ; and
tbat principle la, of course, applicable to
tboae States which, like Tennessee, attempt
ed to renounce "heir places In tbe Union.
The action of the Executive Depart
ment of the Government npon this sut ject
has been equally definite and uniform, and
the purpose ot the war was specific
ally stated in the Proclamation Issued by
my predecessor on the 22d day of Srptem
der, 1863. It was then solemnly pro
claimed snd declared that 'hereafter, as
heretofore, the war will be prosecuttd for
the object of practically restoring the con
stitutional relation between the United
States and each ot the States and the
people thereof, in which Biates that rela
tion Is or may be suspended or disturbed."
The recognition of the States by the
Judicial Department ot the Government,
has a!so been clear and conclusive In all
proceedings sffuctlog them as States, had
in tbe Supreme, Circuit and DWtrict
Courts.
In the admission of Senators snd Repre
sentatives from any and all ot the Slates,
there can be no Just ground of apprehen
sion tbat persons wboaro disloyal will bo
clothed with the powers of legl-Ution ; for
this could not happen when the Constitu
tion and laws are enforced by a vigilant
and failhlul Congress. Each House is
made the ''Judge ol the elections, returns,
and qualifications of its own membors,"
and may, "with tbe concurrence of two
thirds, expel a member." When a Sena
tor or Representative presents bit certifi
cate of election, be may at once be admit
ted or rejected ; or, should there be any
question as to his eligibility, bis creden
tials may be referred for investigation to
the appropriate committee. If admit
ted to a seat, it must be upon evidence sat
isfactory to the House ot which he thus
becomes a member, and he possesses the
requisite constitutional and legal qualifi
cations. If refused admission as a mem
ber for want of due allegiance to the Gov
ernment, and relumed to his constituents
they are admonished that none but per
sons loyal to the United States will be al
lowed a voice In the Legislative Councils
of tbe Nation, and the political power and
moral influence of Congress are t us ef
fectively exerted in the interests of loyal
tv.tothe Government and fidelity to tbe
Union. Upon this question so vitally af
fecting the restoration of the Union and
the permanency of our ptewnt form of
Government, my convictions, heretofore
expressed, have undergone no chacge;
but, on the contrary, their correctness has
been confirmed by reflection and time,
If tbo admission of loyal members to seals
in the respective Houses of Congress was
wise and expedient a ) ear ago, it is no
less wise and expedient now. If this an
omalous condition is right now if, in tho
exact condition of these Slates at the pres
ent time, it is lawlul to exclude them irom
representation, I do not see that the ques
tion will be changed by theifllux ot time.
Ten years hence, If these States remain as
tbey are, tbe right of representation will
be no stronger the right of exclusion will
be no weaker.
The Constl.ntlon ol tbe United Stales
makes It the doty of tbe President to recom
mend to the consideration ot Congress "such
measures as he shsll Judge necesssry or ex
pedient." I know 01 no measure more Im
peratively demanded by every consideration
ot national Interest, sound policy and equal
Justice, tban tbe admit .'.on o." loyal memhers
Irom tbe now unrepresented States. This
wonld consummate tbe work of restoration,
and exert a most salutary influence in tbe
re-establlshment ol peace, harmony and fra
ternal feeling. It would tend greatly to re
new tbe conhdence of tbe American people
In the vigor and stability of their Institutions
It would bind us more closely together aa a
nation, and enable ns to show to tbe world
tbe inherent and recuperative power ol a
Government tonnded upon tbe will of the
people, and established npon tbe principles
ol liberty, Justice and Intelligence. Our in
creased strength and enhanced prosperity
would irrelragibly demonstrate tho fallacy of
tbe arguments against free Institutions drawn
Irom our recent national disorders by the
enemies of republican government. Tbe ad
mission ol loyal membera from the States
now excluded Irom Congress, bv allaying
donbl and apprehension, would torn capital,
now awaiting an opportunity for Investment,
Into tbe cbannels of trade and indastry. It
would alleviate tbe present troubled condi
tlcnol those States, aod, by Inducing emi
gration, aid io the settlement of fertile re
gions now uncultivated, snd lead to an In
creased production of those staples wblch
have added so greatly to tbe weiltb ol the
nation and the commerce ot tbe world. New
tit lis ol enterprise would be opened to our
progressive people, and soon the devastations
ol war would be repaired, aod all tbe traces
of our domdsttc differences effaced from the
countrymen.
In our efforts to preserve " the unity of
Government which constitutes us one peo
ple," by restoring the S ates to the condi
tion which they held prior to the rebel
lion, we should be cautious, lest, having
rescued our nation from perils of threat
ened dtsiotegralionwe resort to consolida
tion; and in the end absolute despotism,
as a remedy for the recurrence of similar
troubl-a. The war having terminated,
and with it all occasion for tbe exercise of
powers of doub ful constitutionality, we
should hasten to bring legislation within
the boundaries prescribed by the Consti
tution, and to return to tbe ancient land
marks establish 60 by our fathers lor the
guidance succeeding generations. " Tbe
Constitution which at any time exists, un
til changed by an explicit and authentic
act of the whole people, is sacredly obli
gatory upon a l." " If, in tbe opinion of
the people, the distribution or modifica
tion ot tbe constitutional power be in any
particular wrong, let it be corrected by aa
amendment in tbe way to which the Con
stitution designates. But let there be no
change by usutpttion ; for it is the cus
tomary weapoo by whioh free govern
ments are destroy ed." Washington spoke
these werds to his countrymen, when, fol
lowed by their love aod gratitude, be vol
nntarily retired from the cares of publio
life. " To keep all things within the pale
of onr constitutional powers, aod cherish
tbe Fedorai Uuioa as tbe only rock of
safuty," were prescribed by Jeftbbson as
rules of action to endear to bis "country
men the true principles ot their Constitu
tion, aud promote a union of sentiment
and aciloo rqutlly auspicious to their ban;
ploess aod Baieiy " Jackson held that the
action of ibeGmieral G vernment should
always be strictly conflued to tbe sphere
of its appropriate duties, and justiy and
forcibly urged that our Government la not
to be malnuloed or onr Uuin preserved
by invasions tit tbe rights and powers of
the several States. Ia thus attempting to
make our General Government strong, we
make It weak. Its true strength consists
in leaving individuals and 8-ates as much
as possible in tht madvM; la maklrg itself
tell, not in its power, but in iu benefloeDCf j
not in its omirtl, but in its protection;
not in biuding the Stale -uore closely to
the centre, but leaving each to move uo
obalr uctKl In lie proper constitutional
orbit," These are the teachings of men
whose deeds and service s have made them
illustrious, and who. long since withdrawn
from the somes of Lie, base left to their
country th - rich legacy of their example,
their wisdom aud tbelr patriotism. Draw
ing fresh inspiration from their lessous,let
as eaiuia'e tuem la love of country and
respect lor tbe CooMiutiion and the laws.
REPORT THE SECRETARY OF THE
TREASURY.
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury affords much iufnrmsllon re
s poct'Dg the revenue and com mi-roe of tbe
country. His viewa upon the currency,
ant wiib 16 renca to a proper adjustment
of onr revenue system, internal aa well aa
tmpoHt, are r-m amended to the earulul
eonoideratMMi nf O Nngrcna. In my ltat ao
01 meaatga I exoroewad uiy general views -noon
1 bene subjects. 1 aetdwiwooly ceil
attention Ui tbe neoeaviiy of carrying into
every department of tbe Government a
system of rigid accountability, thorough
retrenchment and wise economy. With
t.o exceptional nor unusual expenditures,
tho oppressive burdens of taxation can be
lessened by such a modification of onr
revenue laws as will be consistent with the
public faiih, and the legitimate and neces
sary wants of the government .
The report presents a much mors satisfac
tory condition of our finances tbau one year
ago tbe most sanguine eonld have anticipa
ted. During tba fiscal year coding tbe SOth
01 June, 1, the last year of the war, tbe
publio debt was Increased ISMHWJ.&3T, and
and on the 31st of October, 1S63, it amount
ed to J. 740,854.70. On tbe 81tday of Octo
ber, ltl6. It bad been reduced to $i.551,S10,
000, ths diminution, during a period of four
teen months, commencing September 1st,
1865, and ending October 3d, lStio, having
been t.'06.379.53. In tbe last annual report
on tbe state of tbe finances. It was estimated
tbst during the three quarters of tbe fiscal
year ending the SOth ot Juno last, tbe debt
wonld be Increased 1113,194.947. During that
period, however, It was reduced $31, 1W 887,
the receipts of the year having been 0 P0.
005 more, and tho expenditures t200,529,ti5
less than tbe estimates. Notblug could
more clearly indicate tban those statements
tbe extent and availability ol tbe national re
sources, and tbe rapidity and safety with
whlcb, under our form ot government, great
military aud naval establishments em be dis
banded, and tbe expenses reduced Irom a war
to a peace footing.
During the fiscal year ending the SOth ol
June, 1866, tbo receipts were ,V8,0.i-.J OJO,
aod tbe expenditures f.V2v).750 940, leaving an
available surplus ol (37,28 l,t30. It Is esti
mated that the receipts for the flcal vrar
ending tbe SOth June, 1877, will be $47.1,061,
880, and tbat the expenditures will reach tbe
sum of (316 448.074, leaving In tbe Treasury
a surplus ol (158,K13,S08. For the fiscal year
ending June 80, 1868, It Is estimated tbat tbe
receipts will amount to (4:tfl 000 000. and that
the expenditures will be i"0 247.641 show
ing an excess of (8.1,?52,3ott In favor of tba
Government. These estlmattd receipts may
be diminished by a reduction of excise and
Import duties; but, alter all necesssry re
ductions sbsll hsve been made, the revenue
ol the present snd of following years will
donbtless be sntllclcnt to cover all legitimate
charges npon tbe Treasury, and leave a large
annual surplus to be applied to tbe payment
of tbe principal of tbe debt. There seems
now to be no good reason why taxes may not
bo reduced as the country snvances in popu
lation and wealth, and yet tba debt be extln-
gulshed wltbln tbe rexl quarter of a century.
The report of the Secretary ot War fur
nishes valuable and important informa
tion in reference to the operations of bis
Department during the past 01 r. Few
volunteers are now in the servico, and they
are being discharged as rapidly as they
can be replaced by regular troops. The
army has been promptly paid, carefully
provided with medical treatment, weil
sheltered and subsisted, and is to be arm
ed with breech-loading small arms. Tbo
militury strength if tho nation has been
unimpaired by the discharge i f volunteers,
the disposition of unserviceable or perish
able stores, and retrenchment of expendi
ture; Sufficient war material to meH any
emergency bos beeu retained, and, from
the disbanded vt luuteers standlrg ready
to respond to the national call, largo ar
mies can be rapidly nrganiz- d, equipped
and concentrated. Fortifications on the
coast and frontiers, have received, or are
being prepared for more powerful arma
ments ; like surveys and harbor and river
improvements are in the course of eoer
gutic prosecution. Preparations have been
made for the payment of the additional
bounties authorized during the recent ses
sion of Congress, under such regulations
as will protect the Government from fraud
andsecure to tbe bonorably-discbarged sol
dier the well-earned reward of his faith
fulness and gtliantry. More than six
thousand maimed soldiers have received
artificial limbs or other surgical appar
atus ; and f irty-one national cemeteries
containing tbe remains i t 104,526 Union
soldiers have all ready been established.
The total es Imate of Military appropria
tions is $25,205 009. V
It is stated in tbe report of tho Secretary
of the Navy tbat the naval force at this
time consists of two hundred and seventy
eight vessels, armed with two thousand
three hundred and fifty one guns. Of
these, one hundred and fifteen vesstls,
carrying one thousand and twenty-nine
guns, are in. commission, distributed
chiefly among seven squadrons. The
number of men In the service is thirteen
thousand six hundred. Great activity and
vigilanca have been displayed by all tbe
squadrons, and their movements have
been Judiciously and efficiently arranged
iu sucu a manner as would best promote
American commerce, aod protect tbe
rights and ioteres s of our countrymen
abroad. The vessel j employed are under
going repairs, or are laid up until their
services are required. Moat ot the iron
clad fleet are at League Island, in the
vicinity of Pnlladtlphla, a place which,
nntll decisive action should be tsken by
Congress was selected by the Secretary
of the Navy as the most eligible location
for that class of vessels. It is Important
tbat a suitable public station should be
provided for the iron dtd fleet It is
intended that these vessels shall be in
proper condition tor any emergency, and
it is desirable that tbe b it acctp'tug
League Island tor navsl purposes, whico
pasix-d the House ot Representatives al its
last session, should receive final action at
an early day, lu order that there may be a
suitable public station for this class of ves
csels. as well as a navy yard ot area suffi
cient for the wauls of the services on the
Delaware river. The Naval Pension
Fund amount to $11,750,000, having been
increased $3,750 000 during the year. The
expenditures of the Department for the
fical year ending 80th of June last were
$13324,526, aud tbe estimates fir the
coming year amount to $23,508,433. At
tention is invited to tbe condition of our
seamen, and tbe importance ot legislative
measures for their relief and improvement.
The suggestions in behalf of ibis deserv
ing class ot our fellow citizens are
earnestly recommended to the favorable
atteneion of Congress.
The report of the Postmaster General
presents a most satisfactory condition of
the postal servico, and submits recom
mendations which dewve the considera
tion of Congress. The revenues of the
Department lor the year ending June 30,
1866, were $U 8S6 086. and the expendi
tures $15 852 0?l, showing an exoeeaof tbe
latter of $065,0U3. In auticip tlion of this
deficiency, however, a sped sppropiU
tion was made by Congress, io the set ap
proved July 28. 18C6. Including the
standing appropriation of $700,000 for
free mail matter, as a legitimate poiilon of
the revenues yet remaining unexpended,
the ac'uxl deficiency for the past year i
only $265,003 a sum wl:hin $51,141 ol
the amount estimated In tbe anuulr-p rt
of 1864. Tbe decrease of revenue, com
pared with tbe previous year, was one and
one tilth per cent., add the increase of x
pendilures, owing prtocip-tlly to Ibe en
largement of the mail service in tbe South,
was twelve percent. On theSOtb ol June
last there were in operation six thousand
nine hundred and thirty mall routes with
an aggregate length of one hundred aud
eighty thousand nine bu dred aud twenty,
oue miles, ao aggregate annual transpoi
tation of eeveo'y-onem 11 00 tight hundred

The report of ths Secretary of ths Interjil
exhibit the condition of thosa branches 00
the public service which am committed to
this supervision. During tbe last fiscal year,
four million six hundred and twenty-nine
thousand three hundred snd twelve acres of
publio land were disposed of, one million
eight hundred and ninety two thousand fit e
hundred aud sixteen serosa ol wblch were
entered under the homestead act, Tbe pol

lands has under. one essential modiflcatlona.
Itnmedlotn revenue, and not tbelr rapid set
tlement, was tbe cardinal feature ol our land
system. Long experience and earnest dis
cussion have resulted In the conviction tbat
tbe early development of onr agricultural
resources, and Ue diffusion ot sn energetlo
population over our vast territory, are ob
jects of far greater Importance to the na
tional growth and prosperity thsn the pro

bidder in open market. Tbe pre-emption

A a subject upon which depeeds an
immense amount of the production and
commerce ot the country, I recommend to
Congress such legislation as may bo
necessary for the preservatiou of theleveej
ot the Mississ'ppl river, it is a mailer ot
national importance that early steps
should tie taken not only to add to tbe
efficiency of these barriers against de
structive inundations, for the removal of
all obstructions to the free and safe navi
gation of that great channel of tra le and
commerce.
Tbe District sf Columbia, under existing
Isws, lsuotentlil-d to tbst representation
in the Natlonsl Councils wblcb, from our
earl lei-t history, baa been uniformly accorded
to each Territory eetabliabed Irom time to
time within our limits. It maintains peculiar
rtlttiona 10 Congrats, to whom tbe Oonstl
tutlon hss granted the power of exercising
ex lusive leglelatlon over tbe seat of govern
tneut. Our fellow cltissns residing in tbe
District, wbo-e interests are tbns confided to
tbe special guardianship of Congress, exceed
la number tbe poj.ulutlon of several of our
Territories, and nojuM reason is perceived
why n delegate of their choice should not be
admitted to a seat in tbe House ot Represen
tatives. No mo.te seems so appropriate and
effectual ot euabllng tbem to make known
tbelr peculiar condiilou and Wants, and of
securing the lourl legislation adapted to
them. I therefore recommend tbo paseage
01 a law au horis og tbe electors of tbe Die
trict of Columbia to choose a delegate, to be
rliowed the same rights and privileges as a
dt l-gBti representing a Territory. Tbe In
creasing enterprise and rapid progress of im

It wsa reasonably expected that the pro
eeedlngs thus contemplated, would produce
a crisis ot great political Interest In the, Re-
ohlto ot Mexico, The nowly sppointed
mister of tba United Btatoa, Mr. Campbell,
wss therefore sent forward, on tbe Wib day
of November laat, to assume bis proper func
tions as Minister Plenipotentiary ot tbe
United BtaWs to tbst Republic It wss also
thought expedient tbat he sbonM be attend
ed In tbe vicinity ot Mexico, by ths Lieuten
ant General of lhe Army of the United States
In re-establishing and mnlntatnlng necessary
and proper latercourse wltbytbe Republic of
Mexico. Deeply Interested In the csuse of
liberty snd humanity, It seemed an obvious
duty 00 our part to exercise whatever Influ
ence we possessed for the restoration and
permanent establishment In that country, of
a domestic and republican form of govern
ment. Buch was tbe condition ot affairs In regard
to Mexico, when, on the Ibid of November
laat, oiliclsl Intormstlon was received Irons.
Paris, tbat the Emperor of Franca had some
time belore decided not to withdraw a de
tachment of bis forces In tho month ot No
vember past, sccordlug to engagement, but
that this decision was made with tbo purpose
of withdrawing tbe whole ot those forces In
tbe ensuing spring. Of this determination,
however, the United Btatns bad not received
any notice or Intimation ; aud, so soon aa tbe
Information was received by the Government,
care was taken to make known its dlsscut to
tbe Emperor of Franco.
1 cannot lorego the hope that France
will reconsider the subject, and adopt
some resolution in regard to tho evacua
tion of Mexico which conforms as nearly
as practicable with the existing engage
ment, aud meet tbo Just expectations of
tbe United States. Tho papers relating to
tbe subject will be laid belore you. It Is
believed tbat, with the evacuation of Mex
ico ty the txpeditlonary torces, no sub
ject for se,rlou differences between France
nd the United States would remain. The
expressions of the Emperor and tho peo
ple uf Francs warraut a liopo that tbe
traditionary friendship between the two
couutriea might iu tbat case be renowed
and permanently teslored.
A claim of a citizen of the United Slates
for Indemnity for spoliations committed
on the high seas by tho French authori
ties, in iheexetciseof belligerent power
against Mexico, has been met by the Gov
ernment 1 t FraDCe with a proposition to
defer sen lenient until a mutuul conven
tion for tbe adjustment f all dainis of
ci'izens and subjects of both countries,
arising out of the recent wars on Ihlscou
tiueui, sbtil bo agreed upon by the two
countries. The suggestion is not deemed
unre tttouablo, but it belongs to Congress
to dirt c1. the manner in w hich claims for
indemnity by foreigners, as well as by citi
zens pi the United States, arising out of
tbe late civil war, shall be adjudicated and
determined. I have no doubt tbat th'j
subject of all such claims will engage
your aiieniion al a convenient and proper
tune.
It is a in titer oi regret that no consider
able advance has b en made towards an
adjustment of the differences between tbe
United States and Great ilritain, arising
out ol the depreda'ions upon our national
commerce aud other trespasses committed
during our civil war by British subjects, in
violation of international law and treaty
obligations. Tho delay, howover, may bo
believed to bave resulted in no small de-
Sree Irom the domestic situation of Ore at
itain. An vuiiru change of ministry
i ccuind in that country during tho last
semi 011 of Parliament. Tho attention of
tho new tnitiibtiy was called to the subject
at an eaily day, and there is some reason
to expect thai It will now be considered
in a becoming and triondly spirit the im
portance of an eaily disposition of the
question cuon t be exaggerated. What
ever might be Ibe wishes c f the two Gov
ernment, li ii manifest that good will aud
fiienduhip between the two countries can
not bo established until a reciprocity, in
the practice of good ftiih end neutrality
Bbuull be restored bctwecu tho respective
nations.
On the Gih of June list, in violation of
our neutrality laws, a military expedition
and enterprise against the liritish North
American Colonies was projected and at
tempted to be carried on within tbe terri
tory and Jurisdiction of the United States.
In obedience to the obligation imposed
upon tbe Executive by tho Constitution,
to see that the laws uro faithfully execu
ted, all citizens were warned by proclama
tion, against taking part in or aiding such
unlawful proceedings, and the proper
civil, military, and naval officers were di
rected to take all uucessttry measures for
tbe enforcement ot the laws. Tbe expe
dition tailed, but It has not been without
its tatal consequences. 8 .me ot our clll
zcls who, it war alleged, were engaged In
the expedition were captured, and bave
been pruught to trial, as tor a capital of
fence, in tue Province of Canada. Judg
ment and sentence ot death bave beeu
pronounced against some, while others
have been acquitted. Fully believing in
the maxim of Government, that severity
of civil punishment for misguided persons
who have engaged in revolutionary at
tempts whlcb bave disastrously failed, is
unsound aud unvtise, such rt presentations
have been made to the British Govern
ment in behalf of tho convicted persons
as, being sustained by an enlightened and
bumanejudgment, will, it is hoped, induce
in their ta-es an exercise ot clemency aod
a Judicious amnesty to all who were en
gaged in the movement. Counsel has
been employed by tho Government to de
fend citizens of tue Uuited Stales on trial
for capital 'deuces in Canada ; and a dis
continuance! of the prosecutions which
were Instituted in the couttsof tbe United
States against thoee who took, part In the
expedition has been directed.
1 bave regarded tbe expedition as not ot.ly
political Io Its nstuie, but as bIboIo a great
measure foreign Irom tbe Untied Btates In
Itscauso, cbaracterand obj-cts. Ibe attempt
was understood to be marie In sjmnsti.y
with au Insurgent party In Ireland, aud, by
striking at a British Province on this Conti
nent, was designed to aid In obtalutng re
dress for political grievances wblcb, It was
assumed, tbe peopld of Ireland bad suffered
at bauds of tbe British Government during
a period of several centuries. Tne persons
engaged In it were chiefly natives of that
couotry, some ot whom bad, w till j others
bud not, become citizens of tbe United
Btates under our general ltwsol natural 14
tion. Complaints of wiaguveroment lu Ire
land continually engage ibe attention ol the
British nation, aud so great an Skitalioo Is
now prevailing iu Ireland tbat Ibe Brltlsb
Government bave deemed It necessary to
suspend Ibe writ of babeaa corpus in that
country. These clrcumalancea must neces
sarily modify the opinion wblcb we might
otberwlae bave eoleruiued In regard to an
expedition cxpresrly prohibited by onr neu
trality laws. t)o ljog as tt ose reuialu upon

ment, so long aa he does not voluntarily re

that the peril may be successfully and
finally passed, without impairing its
origlnlnal strength and symmetry The
Interests of the nation are best to be pro

the complete obliteration of our past

to the early accomplishment of thrse great
