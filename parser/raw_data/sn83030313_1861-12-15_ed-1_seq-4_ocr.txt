THJK SITUATION.
From the. movements of the rebels during the |
past day or two, in congregating their lories in
large u.asses between Ocaquan and Manas, us ami
iii the vicinity of Acotink und Colchester, it is
thought that they anticipate an immediate attack
by the grand army of General MeClellan.
The terror? of conflagtavion have seized upon the
city ol Charleston, South Carolina?tho nursery
and hotbed of rebellion. A terrific fire ha. been
raging there since Wednesday night, wbi h has
destroyed nearly all the business portion ot Die
City up to this time, mid in last accounts the flame?
were still spreading so fast over the business dis
trict and fashionable dwelling? In the direction of
the Ashley river that Die total demolition of the
most valuable portion of the city is imminent.
We give to-day in our columns a detailed ac
count of Charleston, and of the district which has
suffered by the fire, Illustrated by a map of the
city of Charleston, with copious references. The
-dark portions of the map represent the progress
of the destructive element, and although it seems
to cover a comparatively small space, yet it in
cludes the most Important linriceis part of ti t city. ,
The fire is aet down to the work of en Lti' C'ndiaiy.
It If believed tu be tht net of the negroes, about
whohs discontent SBd contemplated insurrection

in Charleston and Its vic.nity tor some time i
feint. Whether the conflagration had ksorigii* in this

throughout the country, and all over the world.

Our news from Missouri to-day is not without

into RavyunaU with a cargo of pork nud salt fish,

Burning ?>f Clinvliilnu-HeportKl \cgio

\Sro publish this morning details by telegraph
of t)m almost total destruction by fire of
the business portion of the city of Charles
ton?ov.o of the most extendvo coufkigrn
turns which ever took place on the American
continent. The news In brief reached thin city
yesterday forenoon, and created the greatest
excitement. Rut the particulars which we fur
oisli our renders this morning are appalling in
the extreme.
It appears that the fire broke out about nine
o'clock on Wednesday night, in ltussell A Co.'3
wash factory, in Hazel street, at the intersection
of Kast Bay street, close to the Cooper liver
and extended across the street to Cameron's
great iron foundry, where rebel cannon have
been manufactured ever since the rebellion
broke out. It extended along E;r-t Ray
Street to Broad, and through Broad street
in the direction of Meeting street. By
refcreiice to the map which wo pul?li h
on our first page, it will he seen that
the burned district extends from East Buy on
the cast to King street west, and from Broad
street south to Queen street north. But the lire
was still raging, and had crossed to the south
side of Broad street, in one portion of that
street. How far it may hare since travelled
south, north and west it is impossible to tell.
As it. is. the heart of the city is burned out,
and property to the amount of ten millions of
dollars is consumed.

omen and a type of the future desin.v >;i of
the rebellion?
M hat. was the pree"?6 origin of the fire is not
yet satisfactorily settled. But there Is a gene
ral belief that it was the work of the incendi
ary. Among the poor whiles there is ample
cause for discontent -oppression of the dirc.-t
Kind. M bother any of these have taken the
present opportunity to avenge thvmsvht-. or
whether tiny have acted in concert with the
negroes, we are unable to determine. It is
staled that a quantity of arms was found under
the floor of a negro's cabin, "all new and in j
good order.'" lie could have only obt .iiied '
them from w hile men. Other negroes were found i
to have kuivos and bntcbets secreted. D is ;
stated, indeed, that, a negro who has been ar- :
reded is the ineendiary, ninl that h'. .v.-l was |
iiut the currying out of a plot tevi led by j
sonto of the negroes to their masters la this
connection ll may be observed tita', in the ab
sence of the firemen in the army, the
negroes were called upon to work the en
gine.. and tlioy broke the two best of
them. We are informed that ike negro
iiiMitr .ctioiv was promptly suppres-ej. }!n|
of that the evidence is not very satisfactoryt
for we are told that they were to be joined by
large bauds of negroes from the country, who
were to come in armed at night. Another ac
count 'fate* that u servile insurrection had
actually broken ?> it in the country two days
previous to the fire, end thati! was sthi inpvo
gre.-s: but tbie is not confirmed. It is evident
Rut the terror which prevailed could not have
the result of an accidental fire, however
extensive. V.'e ore told that families were
barricading tbeir house;, and that the greatest
consli ination prevailed.
[? will be recollected by our readent that
j to n. rul Drayton, who commanded the relv.-l
force at Port Royal, took pains to state that
the Have wore nil quiet, and s.howed no dispo.
eition to leave their maulers or join t!ic federal
fctnudanl. We thought at the time that this
statement looked suspicious; and it in probable
that ci.bcr llraytoo was dissembling or that
the negroes dissembled in order that they
might lull suspicion. The slaves a;e cunning,
and this is ju t ?Lc course they would be likely
to pursue if they meant mischief.
Should the new ? of the insnr rection prove true
it will sp ten or and constcrn it ion all ovet

to discourage the rebellion?tho bridge burn

Union rally in North Carolina, and now the
awful catastrophe which reduces Charleston?

oily was the bead and front of the rebellion,
and it is now blotted out by the hand of Provi
dence; and the operations of the stone fleet in
the mouth of its harbor will prevent forever
its resurrection.

We published recently an important piece
of intelligence from the capital of Spain, to
the effect that orders had been issued to General
Prim and his staff in tie middle of November
to hold themselves in rrndhiess to leave for
Mexico without delay, instead of ut the cad of the
month, as originally intended. By intelligence
since received, we learn that the General sailed
on the 2titli of November, and was expected at
Havana on the l*>tb of December. Meantime
Have divisions of the expedition have already
sailed for Vera Cruz, and the first division
were within thirty-six hours of that port I
at the last accounts. The Espana gives
a pretty clear idea of Ihft nature of the military
expedition of which General l'riin is ordered in
it: ' em! haste to assume the command. "In politi
cal circles," it says, "tho project of forming in
America a confederation of all the republics of
Spanish origin, with Spain at the bead ol it, is
now being discussed. Such a measure, it is af
firmed, would possess groat advantages both
for Spain and for thoso little States. 'I his an
nouncement foreshadows tho attempt ol Spain
to reconquer all her old colonies, under the guise
of recovering debts from the Mexican govern
ment and of obtaining redress for the maltreat
ment of her subjects in Mexico. It is with a
view to this end that the staff of General l'riui
consists of a largo number of civil aswoll as
military officers. They arc needed for gover
nors of Spanish-American provinces. The Spa
nish journals have long since claimed the Cbinca
Islands, which are mines of wealth, and no
doubt these will now he -Matched from Pom.
The tone of the speech of the Queen of Spain
leaves no doubt about, the ulterior designs of
(lie expedition to Mexico.
Tho soizuro of St. Domingo, the oldert Ame
rican posse sion of Spain, was Lev first step in
a new career of conquest on the American con

Spain, adds the That?, will naturally see in
this IripaUiti expedition, in which she is joined
i by Great Britain and Prance, "a substantial
i proof that she is rapidly regaining the
' place which tic onco occupied in the

houses iu New York which would be glad to

VERDICT OF THE JURY,
kf.j k(i) &t.
Atiolhor of those fnghf'iil trngodica which rhlll the blood
lu ono's veins has occurred in this oily. Abc-ot teno'clock
yesterday morning Bernbord I*?y, aged twenty-Ave,
ami who did business as exchange broker uudoi the Citt
sens'Bunk, corner of Canal street end tin litwory, wne
'mind behind his own counter, with h's throat cut frota
car to car, nod his tnauiirmln body widtering in a large
t oo] of blood. A young man next door heard a hoary
fall about the time specified, and, rushing iuto tho ex
change ofllco of I? B. Levy Si jjon, found tlecoa.-tod ua
abovo described, aDd la the la t. strii.;gie of death. H*
Immediately rushed out and sent a ni'sienger in
all baste to Captain Bowling, of the Sixth
precinct, who waa prompily ou the spot, with
a detachment of police. A crowd of peojilo eurroun ed
the door; no ono waa allowed to outer ovcopt tho re
porter and tbo police. From the appearance which the
wound presented, it might have been inflicted by de
coased's own liande or by the bauds of a murderer. Ae
the matter stands at present,it Is Impossible tosay which;
but strong suspicion, it ia stated, rests on a woman
Whose name it is uot proper to publish at
present, and with wbovn deceased waa on terms of inti
macy. She has been known to threaten hU life several
times.
The following facts were communicated to our reporter
by a member of decens?d's family:?Deceased and his
brother, David Levy, left their residence in Third avenue
about nina o'clock A. M., having v. .th theru two bags,
containing eight hundred dollars. Ha- iag deposited
tho money In the office, David I/ivy left to transact s ome
busin-cs at the Commissary's oitheln White street,
and other ptaces, deceased hat iug previously gone
out and rotured with a sugar aud the Uurau.,
evidently with the intention of sitt'rg down to
read the news, lu tho meantime throe man, two of
\vh >ra were butchers, entered the office to t an riot
some b isiness, an 1 left soon alter. These moi. aro known
to tho brothor of deceased, who pays they are rospecta
b!c. 'flic brother, after an absence of about thrco ipiar
toof an hour, returned and found do. eased lying dead,
with hts throat cut. An ordinary sir d pocket kni'e,
apparently new, was fo nd closed on th > sole of ths
counter, and at a litlle distance lay the I!?.iui.i?,
looking as If it had not boon opened. The
young man who hoard the deceased fall sia'.ea that,
although If could usually hoar oonvorsat i n; through the
parti'Ion between the exchange offlc? tutd his own place
of bu'ine?s, on this occasion everything w?' unusually
quiet, and he hoard no noit-'e whatever but the
full. Two b.ijs, containing gold, lay on ono
of tho shelves, and on a kind of stand,
that could be ("tsi'.y reached from l be outside of tho coun
ter, lay a large bundle of bank notes. This show* that if
deceased hue boon murdered it must have been for re
vest,to ?ud noi for gain.
Coroner jackman, on being not tiled of tho off sir repaired
to tho spot, and, after taking charge of the office audits
effccte, ordered the body to ho removed to the Sixth pro

boon euipsnnelled, it was arranged to proceed w ith the
Uir[uest, when the following evidence was elicited ?
