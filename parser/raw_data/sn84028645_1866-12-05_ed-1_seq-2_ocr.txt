Flatulency.
iThe most common cause of this difficulty
i indijeUun. .When tlie natural fluids of
the stomach are secreted in an.;uulicaltby
State, fermentation rapidly takes plaee; and
the stomach and associated viscera 'become
distended with gas; 'giving rise to frequent
eruotatlon-or belchifig.. The quantity, of
gas thus accumulated is often enormous
The treatment for this disorder 'should be
