School, Notes,
Last Friday aftoruooii Tonuliern'
Training Class III obscsved a vor
iutoreislhig and woll rendored
I'Jiiglisli lesson given under the
direction of iMisrf O.slioine. The
lesson was "The Courtship of
Miles iStauilisli," ami llio pupils
iiiohuled tliu seventh and eighth
U rades. A literature lesson taught
in tins way is very interesting and
certainly shows great tffort on tliu
part of the teacher who deserves
credit and appreciation.
Two very interesting banket
ball games were played at the
Public .School Auditorium Friday
evening, Docombor 10th. The
gaino hetwenn tho Feslus and Sto.
d'eiievieve boys was a masterly
elToilou both sides aud tho score
was 40 to 23 in out favor. Tho
I'tniyville and Ste. (ienovievo girls
pitted a good game resulting in
the defeat of our team. However,
there are several points to bo
considered. Tho members of the
opposing team were older and
liayo received quite a bit of train,
ing. Our girl team is composed
of younger girls who may bo con
sidered raw recruits. They have
not had much practice and this
being their first game wo hope
thoy will do bettor next time.
After tho games a social was held
in tho Auditorium.
On Friday evening, Decetnbor
17th, tho Festus and Ste. Gene
vieve boys will engage in a basket
ball game at Festus.
.Miss Morton has organized a
Sewing Class. This certainly
ought to be appreciated as Miss
Morton is doing this in addition
to her teaching. She deserves
much credit for it and we trust
that she will progress with her
class.
On Saturday evening, Decem
ber 18th the third number of the
lijceuiii Course will be rendored
at the Public School Auditorium
at 8 p. m. Tho admission is 25
and 40 cents. Reserved seats urn
10 cei.tb extra. The great treat of
the evening will be tho program
given by the famous "Dickens
Man," William Sterlincr 13attis.
l'lioso who have read Dickens'
works will appreciate to a greater
extent the entertainment given by'
Mr. Hattis while the younger
generation who have not read his
works will be more than eager to
procure Dickens' works right away
and acquaint themselves wtth the
line old author. "
"STOP THIEF."
Do you like a good laugh? We
know yon do and that is why you
can't afford to miss "Stop Thief."
It bubbles over with fun and
laughter. When .lack Doogan and
his accomplice "dnatcher
Noll'', two thieves in disguise, en
ter tho Carr homo, where a
wedding U about to tu1e place,
tho fun begins, Tho wedding
presents disappear and then re
appear in the most mysterious
manner, turning up on tho most
unsuspecting persons, from Mr.
Carr to the minister. Mr. Carr
and the groom believe themselves
to bo victims of kleptomania, aud
tho plot becomes more complicat
ed. You could't miss the comedy
ot the disturbance of tho dignified
wedding party by two crooks who
lifted everything in the home that
wasn t nailed down or glued
tight Come and give youiself a
Christmas treat on December 23rd

"This will be the most import
ant Farmers' Week ever held In

Agriculture is preparing to make

of the College of Agriculture,
University of Missouri. "The
Missouri State Board of Agri
culture will be with the College
of Agriculture and will cooper
ate with the College in making
this event the greatest annual
Farmer Conference.'' Dean
Mumford also calls attention to
these facts about Farmers'
Week: That the Farm Bureau
Federation will hold its fiVst
session here since its complete
organization and important policies-
will be determined. Also
that the Rural Life Conference
of which Dean Mumford is Pres
ident, will hold its session at one
of the important niglit meeting
this year. - Edmund des Brun
ner who has charge of the Rural
Church Survey in the. United
States for the Inter Church
World Movement will speak at
this session and will give valu
able information gotten from
this investigation. Also Mrs.
Jesse Fields Shambaugh of Page
County, Iowa, will speak at this
session. Mrs. Shambaugh while
county superintendent of schools

most advanced plans upon com
munity organization and recrea
tion of any in the country.

uary 17th and close wjth a ban
quet the evening of January 22.
A complete free program will

In these days of expensive
fuel it' is worth while to pay at
tention to a source that is too
often neglected: the old stump
field.. Most if not all of the
coniferous trees have 'no tap
root, but lay hold uwh tho
ground with a widespreading
network of superficial roots that
plutpl the spll iko a gigantic,
many-fingered ljand. Rgfch,
stumps and roots are therefore
easily blown out by a shot or
two of dynamite. If they are
tho stumps and roots of any of
tho pine trees, they are full of
pitch and reain that burn with a
flame as iiot andclear aB oil.
General Meiioher, chief of the
U. S. Air Sorvice, has started a
movement whoreby the airplane
industry may he given govern
mental aid. Tho general states
that by July first every airplane
built during tho war will be
raved unB"te.
