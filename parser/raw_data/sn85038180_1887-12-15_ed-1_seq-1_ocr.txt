Cleveland's Issue !
I
He Boldly. Takes His Stand In
Favor of Free Trade!
The President's Message to the
Fiftieth Congress, at its opening ses
sison, may be taken as Mr. Cleveland's
key-note for the campaign of 1888.
It may have been that when Mr.
Cleveland resided in Buffalo, he knew
enough to step under shelter when
the rains descended, and the floods
came. Nothing he has accomplished
during his stay in Washington, how
ever, would suggest such a thing'
After discussing at soiLe length the
subject of revenues, and the surplus
in the Treasury, the President says
this :
"Our scheme of taxation, by means
of which this needless surplus is taken
from the people and put into the
public treasury, consists of a tariff or
duty levied upon importations from
abroad, and internal revenue taxes
levied upon the consumption of tobac
co aud spirituous and malt liquors. It
must be conceded that none of the
things subjected to internal revenue
taxation are, strictly speaking, neces
saries; there appears to be no just
complaint of this taxation by the
consumers of these articles, and there
seems to be nothing so well able to
bear the burden without hardship to
any portion of the people.
But our present tariff laws, the
vicious, inequitable and illogical
source of unnecessary taxation, ought
to be at once revised and amended.
These laws, as their primary and
plain effect, raise the price to con
sumers of all articles imported and
subject to duty, by precisely the sum
paid for such duties. Thus the
amount of the duty measures the tax
paid by those who purchase for use
these imported Articles. Many of
these things, however, are raised or
manufactured in our own country,
and the duties now levied upon foreign
goods and products are called protec
tion to these home manufactures, be
cause they render it possible for those
of our people who are manufacturers,
to make these taxed articles and sell
them for a price equal to that de
manded for the important goods that
have paid customs duty. So it happens
that while comparatively a few use
the imported articles, millions of our
people, who never use and never saw
any of the foreign products, purchase
and use things of the same kind
made in this country, and pay there
for nearly or quite the same enhanced
price which the duty adds to the im
ported articles. Those who buy im
ports pay the duty charged thereon
into the public treasury, but the great
majority of our citizens, who buy do
mestic articles of the same class, pay
a sum at least approximately equal to
this dut' to the home manufacturer.
This reference to the operation of our
tariff laws is not made by way of in
struction, but in order that we may be
constantly reminded of the manner
in which they impose a burden upon
those who consume domestic products
as well as those who consume import
ed articles, and thus create a tax upon
all our people,"
.t seems that the tender-hearted,
sympathetic man is moved solely by
his love for the poor consumer. He
has discovered that duties on im
ported articles that can be manu
factured in this country only increases
the cost to the consumer, fills the
pockets of the manufacturer, and
works against the business of the
country. The logical deduction,
from the President's line of reasoning
is that the way to improve the busi
ness of the country, reduce the surplus
in the Treasury, and have good times
generally, is to throw out of employ
ment all the labor employed in manu
facturing interests in this country,
impoverish the manufacturers, close
up the factories, shut down the
furnaces and the mines, and put the
money if there be any available, into
the pockets of European manu
facturers. Such is the declaration
upon which Grover Cleveland will
come before the people of this country
next year.
The most objectionable features
about the President's declarations is
that they are erruueous. In the first
place, a protective tariff does not in
crease the price of home-produced
articles to the extent of the duty im
posed. The experience of this country
proves the contrary. The argument
of the President, all through the
message reads more like the speech of
a third-rate Democratic demagogue,
than like the utterances of a states
man. Tbe Republicans will gladly
take up the cudgel Mr. Cleveland has
kindly lain before them, and beat his
officials head off with it, next year.
It is still understood, we believe, that
Mr. McKitterick will build the M. E.
Parsonage.
Don't Experiment.
You cannot afford to waste time in
experimenting when your lungs are
in danger. Consumption always seems,
at first, ouly a cold. Do not permit
any dealer to impose upon you with
some cheap imitation of Dr. King's
New Discovery for Consumption,
Coughs and Colds, but be sure you get
the genuine. Because he can make
more profit he may tell you he has
something just as good, or just the
same. Don't be deceived, bnt insist
upon getting King's New Discovery,
which is guaranteed to give relief in
all Throat, Lung and Chest affections.

Welsh Preachers.
j by rev. fred. ednyfed evans, D. d.
Christmas Evans, the seraph of the
Welsh pulpit, was born on the Esgair
wen Farm, near the town of Llan
dysul, in the County of Carmarthen,
S. W., in a small hut, on Christinas
duy, 1766. He was born in poverty.
His first master was a Jehu, and he
drove the lad furiously. Beethoven
said that Sossini would have made a
grand musician if flogged well when
a boy. Rosseau said, "I was born
weak, ill-treatment made me strong."
Perhaps the ill-treatment which the
boy Christmas received at the hands
of this Jehu, had some part in the
formation of that strong body and
oaklike character which the future
Christmas Evans possessed.
His thirst after knowledge became
intense. Having already mastered
Welsh reading, he turned his atten
tion to English, and he became am
bitious enough to attack the Latin
grammar. In returning from a fair
with a copy of Buayan's Pilgrim's
Progress in his prssession, he was at
tacked by a company of ruffians who
left him in an unconscious condition.
It was at this time that he lost his eye.
His teacher was the Rev. David
Davis of Castelthywel, a splendid
scholar and a celebrated poet. It was
he that composed these well
lines which have reference
known
to Dr.
Priestly and his peculiar views:
"Here lie at rest, in oaken chest
Togetber packed most nicely,
The bones and brains.flesh.blood and veins
And soul of Dr. Priestly."
Ooe of the most noted of Welsh
boards met Davies on a rainy day,
covered with layers of straw fastened
with ropes, and such a sight astonish
ed the poet, and he cried out:
"O Bard and Teacher famed afar
Such sight I never saw;
It 111 becomes a house like yours
To wear a roof of straw."
Davied like a flash replied :
"The rain is falling fast, my friend,
Vou know not what you say,
A roof of straw, methinks, does well
Beseem a wall of clay,"
At thi3 time both teacher and pu
pil were Arminians, but the pupil in a
few years changed his views of Chris
tian doctrine, and became a Baptist,
and of course a Calvinist. He was
baptized by the Rev. Timothy
Thomas of Aberduar, and from him
received his first lessons in Theology.
Mr. Thomas administered the first
baptism near the beautiful town of
Llandilo, four miles from Llandebic,
my native village. Huudreds had
gathered together and were filled with
inspiration, not because they were
near Grougar Hill where Johu Dyer
sang, or near Golden Grove where
Jeremy Taylor preached, but because
that a mighty man of God had come
there, a mac bold and eloquent, to
preach the word and baptize believers.
In his old age this Elijah would ex
claim sometimes; "I have baptised
during my ministry over two thou
sand persons, and among them was
the greatest preacher of his time,
Christmas Evans."
This seraph of the Welsh pulpit,
Chritmas Evans, preaching in a place
in South Wales where thousands had
gathered together in the open field
is thus described: "The one-eyed lad
complied with the request of Rev.
Daniel Davies, the pastor, and slowly
pulled out of his pocket, not an ele
gant clerical sermon case with chaste
ly written contents, but some very
queer, dirty-looking papers inartistic
ally put together, containing, most
probably, a rather full sketch of his
sermon, but as it there appears giving
littie promise, at best huge, cumbrous,
Puritanical, disgeeta membra, vital
only to himself. He turns aside,
loiters awhile about the rough
scaffolded platform, and then makes
his way abstractedly beyond the
neighborhood of the crowd, some of
whom have noticed the mysterious
communication between Daniel
Davies and the old-looking man, and
wondered whether the minister could
ever think of such an absurdity as to
ask him to preach. While he muses
the fire slowly kindles, thoughts ac
quire a startling vividness. Having
found his way back to the platform,
and the singing concluded, he stands
up; such a scarcrowish spectacle even
to a rustic audience, that many of the
people, satisfied that the Velinvoel
pastor had made a grave mistake,
leisurely dispersed, some to get a lit
tle refreshment, others to rest them
selves about the hedges after a weary
journey aud to shelter themselves
from the burning sun, others group
themselves together, talking freely
and most probably comforting oue
auother that when the other preach
ers come on, then they will have
magnificent sermons; thin one surely
would have sense enough to be
short.
Meanwhile, in the midst of a too
general hum and restless, the preacher
had read for his text; "And you, that
were sometimes alienated and enemies
in your mind by wicked works, yet
now hath reconciled, in the body of
his flesh though death, to present you
holy and uublameable and unreproach
able in his sight." His first move
ments were awkward, stiff and wrestl
ing, while his observations were per
haps crude and commonplace rather
than striking or novel, but he had not
proceeded far before, having thus
pinioned himself, he took one of his
wildest flights, bursting forth at the
same time into those ummelodious
but all-piercing passion shrieks under
which his hearers often confessed his
resistless power. Closer and closer
drew in the scattered groups. The
crowd becomes dense with eager lis
teners as they press on insensibly to
wards the preacher. He gradually
gets into the thickening plot of his
simple but dramatic representation,
while all, forgetful of the spot on
which they stood, old men and wo
men accustomed to prosy thoughts
and ways, look up with open mouths
through smiles and tears. Big burley
country folk, in whom it might have
been thought the faculty of imagina
tion had long sirce been'extinguished.
became engrossed with ideal scenes.
The preachers present (and they were
many) became unexpectedly dazzled
with the brilliancy of this new star
on the horizon, they start on their
feet around the young man, look
hard at him in perfect amazement;
loud and rapturous confirmations
break forth from their lips, "Amen,"
"Bendigedig," (blessed), "Gogoniant,"
(glory) "Diolch byth" (thanks for
ever), fall tumultuously upon the ear,
the chorus swells forward from the
platform to the extreme margin of
the crowd, and to the occasional loud
laugh there has now succeeded a
baptism of tears. The excitement is
at its highest, but the 'weeping and
rejoicing continue until worn out na
ture brings the scene to an end."
The popular preachers that were to
follow him with their magnificent
sermons were not to be found. He
was known henceforth as the great
Christmas.
It is great blessingjthat every man
is not a preacher, but it is a great
calamity if every preacher is not a
man. You cannot in this instance
separate the man from the true preach
er. The strong characteristics of the
man appear in the preacher. His
nature .had strong elements which
were not at all times under perfect
control, and indeed to keep them at
all times under perfect control would
be to put out the fire, and a preacher
without fire in him is worse than an
iceberg. Christmas 'Evans was full
of electricitv, most of which was used
in the pulpit to a sublime purpose.
The soul-stirring truths that moves
him and the people photographed
themselves upon his wonderful
countenance. He was perfectly carried
away with his subject. Sometimes
he would laugh loud while preaching,
apd his laugh was of the Leviathan
kind, jand half his laugh would break
into fragments the faces of a hund
red pulpit dudes. He was at home at
Penuel, and he lingered so long in the
holy piace until his countenance be
came transfigured. He could never
seperate himself from his work.
Sometimes he was discouraged, sad
and melancholy, and was at times
very severe with himself. The three
great preachers of this time in Wales
were Christmas Evans, John Elias
and Williams of Wern. John Elias
was a finished orator, an able theolo
gian, and an extensive reader; Will
iams was a metaphysician, a keen
reasoner, and a captivating speaker.
Christmas Evans was an independent
thinker, a born poet and a fiery
preacher; Elias' mind was fully
furnished; Evans' was brilliantly
furnished. There was infinitely more
variety in Christmas Evans' preaching
than in that of John Elias or of
Willliams of Wern. Williams could
hold his imagination under control,
but Christmas' imagination carried
him along, and he carried his audience
with him. Elias is tame and com
monplace in print, but even the ink
in Evans' sermons is warm and the
words are winged. In my next I
shall dwell upon the voice, jesture,
language, etc., in Welsh preaching.
Philadelphia Pa.
Col. A. C. Thompson.
Some of the friends of Col. Thomp
son have begun to agitate the ques
tion of his renomination for a third
term. Without saying anything dis
paraging to the candidacy of any oth
er Republican who may seek a nom
ination, we wish to say that the peo
ple of this District can do no better
than to send the Col. back, for a third
term. The old prejudice against the
name "Third Term," is unreasonable
in the extreme. No man claims the
right to a third nomination, but in
case the people see fit to reward a
faithful service for two terms with a
third nomination, we fail to see the
impropriety therein. Col. Thompson
is an active and influential member of
the House, doing honor to the consti
tuency that sent him there. Under
a Democratic administration he has
necessarily been prevented from doing
as much for his District and its peo
ple as he would have liked, and we are
not sure that it would not be a good
thing to send the Col. back for a term
under James G. Blaiue or Johu Sher
man as President. For it is pretty
well settled in the minds of the Amer
ican people that Mr. Cleveland will
retire at the close of his first term.
This District could not find a better
candidate, nor a more earnest, active
Republican, than Col. A. C. Thomp
son. His patriotism is attested by a
bullet wound through one of his
lungs. Such are the men the people
should delight to honor.
Belfield's Adventure !
How The "Maj." Played It On The
Chicago "Beats."
In the spring of 1882 "Maj." Bel
field, of Pierre, Dak., had an adven
ture in Chicago of which he has al
ways felt rather proud. I met him in
the caboose of a Northwestern freight
train out between Blunt and Rous
seau while he was returning from the
Garden City.
"When a plain-looking old bloke
like me goes to Chicago," said the
Major, "he's got to keep his eyes
peeled."
"Did they try to work you, Major?"
"Took me for a yearling," he re
plied, as he whetted his pocket-knife
on his boot-leg. "Picked me up for a
pilgrim from Oshkosh. 'Lowed I
was on my bridal trip, I reckon."
"But you were too much for them,
Major?"
"They tried to drive me with a
straight bit, but I laid down with 'em
in the shaf 's, an' afterwards kicked
the top off'n their wag'n," he contin
ued. It might be incidentally men
tioned that the Major was proprietor
of the River Front Livery Barn and
Corral. "When I got through buck
in' I was the only live critter on the
grounds."
"But how did it happen, anyhow?"
"W'y, it was like this: I was walk
in' 'long a street, with the buildin's
loomin' up like cou't-houses on both
sides, sorter try in' to see my way out,
when a slick-lookin' cuss, with soft
clothes on an' a big watch-chain, come
up an' sticks out his hand, an' says
he: "W'y, Mr. Brown, how are you?
Thunder ! But I'm highly glad to
see you ! When'd you come down, and
how's Aunt 'Melia and all the folks?'
an' all the time he a-workin' my arm
up'n' down 'sif he thought I was a
pump an' he had jes' poured two
quarts of warm water in my head to
prime me. I let him pump, an' felt
'round under my coat and found my
gun was there yet, an' my belt under
my vest was full o' ca'tridges, an' I
could feel my knife yet in my boot
leg, so says I: 'Who be you?'
" 'W'y don't you know me?" says
he, 'I'm Seth Green, old Abner Green's
son, who. used to go to school at the
Shake Hollow school-house. I know
you.' 'Well, then,' says I, 'if that's
the case, who be I ?' 'You're 'Squar'
Doty, of Oshkosh,' says he. 'No, I
ain't,' says I. 'You ain't?' says he,
an' his lower jaw began to fall. 'Then
who be you?' 'My name is David
Rogers, an' I'm from Sheboygan.'
'Oh, ah,' says he, 'I beg your pardon
mistakes will happen. Down for
pleasure, I presume?' 'No, not ex
ac'ly,' says I, 'I brought down 'bout
two thousand to invest in agricultu
ral machinery.' 'Hah? Hey?' says
he. "Oh, excuse me ag'in I got a
very important engagement an' must
hurry 'long.' He went off walkin'
fast, an' I sorter soldiered 'long look

says he. 'You're Dave Rogers, of
Sheboygan, my father's ole friend!'
'Who be you?' says I. 'My name is
Asa Smith you must remember me,'
says he. '0, yes, that's so,' says I. 'I
remember you well. How you gittin'

Rogers,' says he. 'I'm comin' up to
old Sheboygan to see all the folks
'bout the Fourth of July. Would
you mind takin' a short walk?' 'No,'
