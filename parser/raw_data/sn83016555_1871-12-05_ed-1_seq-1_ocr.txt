There was a crush at the Varieties la
night to witness the opening of one of
most elegant theatres in the world. There
is nothing in this country that surpasses
it. and probably few. it any, that can equal
it. The entrance from Canal street is a
wide, elongated stairway, brilliantly lighted
by a profusion of small clusters of gas
burners. Our friend John G. Fleming has
exceeded himself in artistic display. The
architecture inside is very near to per
tectiou, not only in the carving but the col
oring. The stage is a fairy scene.
The opening address, read by Mr. Law
rence Barrett, was up to the average ot
such productions, and delivered in that dis
tinguished actor's best style.
The play was probably well enough for
an opening night, but a very uncomfortable,
inconvenient seat, from which the stage was
pretty well liid, or only seen in glimpses
between bobbing heads, and as nearly shut
oil from sound, drove us home at the end of
tin- tirst act. A cold northern blast sweep
ing down the side aisle, and a surging crowd
of occupants of " standing room only " be
hind one's chair, arc not specially inviting
auxiliaries to the comforts of a theatre
There are, however, some very choice seats'
hut they are not in the • section K, orches
tr.i stalls," third row back. We could not
see much of the company, but they uu
lioubtedly made a favorable impression up
on the audience.
i ke same play will be repeated to-night
"t'rnpe on Ihe Door."
The New Orleans National Bank, which
w.ts recently the scene of the Boyd-Rainey
tragedy, had a sad and sombre appearance
yesterday, for there was "crape on the
door." This eruble m of mourning was dis
played on the occasion of the death of .Mr.
Alexander Wheel ess. the founder of the
bank, and its first president. Mr. Wheeless
was ill only a few days, ami was out on the
streets as late as Thursday of last week.
He was a witness to the killing of Mr.
Rainey, and gave his testimony on the
Boyd trial last week Tho*grrajie .ou the
door yesterday did not shutout trom view
the shattered glass in trout of the desk at
which poor Rainey was standing when the
fatal shot was tired that speedily ended bis

Taken altogether, the fifth State Fair of
the Mechanics and Agricultural Fair Asso
] oiation ended successfully, notwithstanding
the weather and other circumstances were
against it. The display of articles was very
extensive, varied and superior, so superior
as to elicit encomiums from visitors from
every portion of our l uion. Exhibitors en
tered into the spirit of the occasion, anil
greatly assisted the board of directors in
their laudable efforts to promote vital inter
ests of Louisiana. Fnfortunately, the time
was not well chosen for a vast number of
visitors to attend. Our planters and farmers
in the autumnal months are compelled to
remain at home, yet many of them for
warded excellent samples of their produc
tions, all of an order far above ordinary.
Of machinery there was an abundant dis
play, some of which was for the first time
introduced into this section of the South,
giving citizens an opportunity to compre.
heml the immense advantages of labor
saving contrivances. This department is
deserving of unlimited praise. Of live
stock there was almost complete lack, if we
except a few horses, none being extraordi
nary. The racing created scarcely a ripple,
divulging nothing in particular to speak of.
However, there was au interesting showing
of chickens.
The art gallery was, indeed, a pretty
sight, and it would be difficult to find auv
ta;r that could cipial it in specimens or ex
tent. Articles ior household use were al
most without number, and they were ar
ranged with superb tact. More ot oar own
manufacturers came forward this than in
any previous year, anil they appeared some
what encouraged. These are the exhibitors
who should receive every cure and aid; they
are the representatives x\ho should speak
for this community in this State fair. Much
depends on their talent, and if they do not
make an effort one of the main pillars of
this association must tali; they are second
only to tillers of the soil. It is to be hoped
that the next exposition will advance
greater inducements to our home manu
fat Hirers.
In stead of forty bales of cotton there
should have been two or three hundred;
id of a few samples of sugar and
s . nip there should have bet a hundreds of
entries. Every producer of rice and tniir
should be urged to forward samples of Lis
best.
Hit* managers have now by experience
1- arned many usetul points in public expo
sitions, and in future they will avail their
selves of tloir hard earned knowledge.
speck more of liberality on their part will
not be lost, nor will it tie wrong on the part
of exhibitors to help themselves instead of
depending ou department superintendents.
Let every director, or other person fiuau
i.illy interested in the fair, abstain from
entering any article for competition. Such
curse will prevent
reeahle remarks, i
We liave contributed our mite to make I
- State Fair successful, ami will probably )

Name for committee on Fi.rt St. Philip canal.
Tue committee on obstructions -it the
mouth ol the Mississippi ;iyer reported.
A statement was made that vessels draw
ing nineteen feet had crossed the bar. Ahst
th.it the Kssayous liad performed some
good work, having kept one channel about
eighteen or twenty f et deep. The Kssay
on.s is now at Southwest Pass re.elv for

livered here the first of next year, but it is
not likely she will arrive at that time.
Some satisfactory progress has been mail •
in surveying the St. Philip canal.
Ihe same committee read a statement
■- •owing some expenses attending a vessel
arriving or departing this p >rt. The figures
an' simply frightful. Thirteen thousand
j one hundred dollars for a sailing vessel.
| loaded with cotton, ts rather expensive.
'll;*' committee on railroads read ij letter
I lrom Mr. W . Gaylord. New York, in refer*
• to the Baton K iuge and Shrgrepor:
| road, hut the prospects are iVot jirilliaut fer
j that line. Mr. Gaylord has offered to sell
j his interest, and there is little good to com •
i out ot it, trom present appearances.
I A proposition lrom Mr. Morgan was read.
| He otters to build a railroad front Brashear
j to Courtableau, provided Louisianians or
some one else would construct another
section from Courtableau to Shreveport.
This proposition, although a good one iu
itself, can not be thought of at present,
fays the committee, as it is impossible to !
obtain sufficient funds to meet Mr. Mur- |
gait's proposal.
1 he report of this committee was lengthy
and exhaustive, handling the subject with
spirit. A committee on the resolution was
appointed.
1 lie committee offered a resolution intent'.
ing to deprive several railroads in this State
ol a portion of their rights. The resolution
was adopted.
The city license committee had nothing
further to report.
A report trom the quarantine committee
suggested many changes. Evidently, the
committee does not like the present law. A
committee was asked for.
It was announced that hills of lading are
at present given for cotton raised above flu
Redriver raft to Sr. Louis, and many bales
are going that route to-day. Producers had
no other cours", and probably wilt not until
the raft shall be broken up. A corps of

llfi'etiug at the Place d'Armes.
Notwithstanding the inclemency of the
weather and the prevalence of hissing wiuds
that blew fitfully from the north, northeast
and northwest, laden with the iey breath
from Siberian snows, there was a large
meeting last night at the Place d'Armes of
the friends and admirers of the late Lieuten
ant Governor Oscar J. Dunn.
Early in the evening crowds of persons,
wrapped in overcoats, shawls and comfort
ers that might have chimed with the de
sires of an Esquimaux, began to pour into
the spacious square, which was brilliantly
illuminated by a thousand lamps that threw
a ghostly glare over the squads of moving
spectators.
There were three stands erected, the
first or grand stand being at the Orleans
and Sr. Claude street side of the square, the
second, at the St. Peter street entrance, and
the third at the St. Ann street entrance.
Each stand was decorated with uu Amer
ican flag, and trom each resounded strains
of mournful music by different bands.
< >u the front of each stand were displayed,
in large letters, the words "Dunn, tel! the
boys to hold together."
'I lie meeting was addressed by various
speakers, among whom were lion John
Ray, Hon. J. Henri Bareli, Him. S. B. Pack
ard, Hon. James Lynch. Major T. Morris
Chester, Colonel (f. \V. Carter, Senator J.

The policing of the square was under
the charge of John W. Roxbourough, chief
marshal, and his assistants, aided by T. De
S. Tucker, L L. Thompson, A. Bertonneau.
G. C. M ason and G. C. Norcross, who com
posed the committee of arrangements.
•The inclemency of the weather without
doubt lessened the number of attendants,
and depressed the ardor of the speakers.

The Opera of Mlanon.
The plot of this charming opera of Aru
brois© Thomas, which has been produced
at tiie Opera House, may be briefly stated
thus: Mirjnot i is a member of a strolling
band of gypsies, and helps them earn their
living by street performances. She once
refuses to take part in one of the exhibi
tions, and Junto, the chief man among the
Bohemians, threatens to heat her unless she
goes (in with the show, and is only pre
vented from doing so by IVilhtlm Miexter, a
handsome, wealthy young man, recently
from the university, now traveling for
pleasure, who happens along and interferes
with the cruelty of Jurun with ehivalric
promptness. He subsequently carries his
generosity so tar as to ransom the nrettv

during the mouth of November was $11,

City Attorney's Office.
in the Connorcase, now before the Fourth
District Court, the city seeks to expropriate
a square of ground in front of the city
Waterworks, which was sold in 18(i7 as
batture property for $13,000. As the two
large suction pipes from the reservoir to the
river pass through this square, the owners
ot the property, abopt, a year ago. offered it
to the city for the modest sum of $00,000.
Tin authorities refused to pay that price,
and in the suit now pending, midis of our
best citizens, members of the Citizens' As
sociation, come forward and testify that
the property is worth from forty to fifty
thousand dollars, notwithstanding the fact
that there are now two large ponds on the
square, which the City Surveyor estimates
will cost the city $10,000 to fill up.
ihe property formerly belonged to the
hens ot Livaudais, and was sold by the city
in ISo,. one half of the proceeds going to the
city and one half to the heirs—the heirs re
linqundiing all future rights to the batture.
Now. this is one of the cases which the
Citizens' Association may look into, and
when their committee of fifty come to ex
amine the records at the City Hall, and fer'
ret out the unnecessary expenses of the citv
administrators,qierhaps. some one out of the
fifty vigilants may be able to see that the
little item oi forty or fifty thousand dollars,
less the half of thirteen thousand dollars!

Perhaps Mr. C. E. Girardey may give

dignified tone in meeting the accusations of
members of his own party, we pronounce
in his favor.
I lie fact-is, political matters are so com
plicated, ami may become more so during
the coming year, that we require an astute"!
able, and withal a liberal and honorable
man to till the executive chair of the State
—one possessing the administrative ability,
wi'li the firmness of execution to meet and
master the questions, a proper solution of
which will add to the material wealth of
the State, and to the prosperity of all
classes ot our citizens. And in If. C.
Yt armot li the mass of the people of the
State recognize these merits, and without
a-kiug Democrats, Customhouseites, "pas
siveites," "aetiveits" or any other "ites" a
concession or a compromise of their princi

is the man" will rest upon the respective
merits ot the candidates; and as his are
tiaii-eendant, above, beyond and superior
t" any man of this State, "he is the uian''
to lie the representative of the people.

and as he is not the law maker, bat the
executor and gttardiun of the law, i*guilt

As he lias been found to be an honest offi

vindicator of the rights of all classes before
the law, we will support him as the choice
ot the Republican party of the State of
Louisiana, subject to the nominating eou

"All hail the Chief," the most noble and
able of Southern Governors.
"Our choice" for Lieutenant Governor in
187'2, as will be. seen by reference to our first

political record of this gentleman shows no
blemish, nor can his most violent political
opponents charge him with corruption or
faithlessness to bis constituents. As au able
representative of his class, in whom his fel
low citizens place implicit faith, he will, in
the next gubernatorial canvass, poll a
