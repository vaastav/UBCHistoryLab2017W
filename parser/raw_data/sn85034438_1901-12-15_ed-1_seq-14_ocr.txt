IRGINIA URGED TO MAKE EXH?BITS
AT THE ST. LOUIS EXPOSITION
Committee of Former Virginians Write to The
r Times About the Importance of the
World's Fair to Be Held
There in 1903.
(Written for Thc Sundey Times.)
There is considerable interest manifest
??d here in tho proposed World's Fair
?at St. Louis in 1903 to celebrate the cen?
tennial of the Louisiana Purchase. There
is a bill pending In the Legislature pro?
viding for an appropriation adequate to
?pnablc this State to make creditable ex
fclblt**..
The following letter has been received
by The Times from Hon. Henry T. Kent,
formerly of Ixuilsa caunty, chairman of
tho committee, nnd other former Vir?
ginians, urging this State to steps to be
represented:
St. Louis, December 10, 1901.
Editor of The Times:
Sir,?The und'Tslgncd have h-eon inp
pointed a committeo of thc Virgini.i So?
ciety in St. Louis to co-operate in tlie
promotion of Virginia's participation in
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, nt
St. Louis, in 1903.
The scopo of thc work of the commit?
tee is to aid in securing an appropria?
tion for a State Building and an exhibit
nnd to act with tbe State officials in mak?
ing the exhibit as comprehensive ns pos
eible and in facilitating in every way
possible tho work by means best suited
to the conditions to he met.
The magnitude of the exposition mny
he best judged by ?a few-facts and fig?
ures as follows:
Thc Centennial Exposition at Philadel?
phia covered ""of. acres; the Paris Expo?
sition of 1900 336 acres: tho Columbian
Exposition at Chicago 633 acres: the Pan
?American Exposition nt Buffalo "550 acres.
The St. Louis Exposition will cover 1,200
acres.
The construction cost of the Paris Ex?
position was J9.O00.O00; that of the Co?
lumbian Exposition -"ls.";2L'.0iV"i. The cost
of thc St. Louis World's Fair, accord?
ing to the estimate of the Director of
"Works, will be ?30.000.000. of which
amount Congress has appropriated ?5,
000.000.
Little need be said of the historic sig?
nificance of this exposition. If all else
that Thomas Jefferson did were wiped
out, the great act of statesmanship in
the peaceful acquisition of the Louis?
iana, territory would immortalize him.
In his special message President Jef?
ferson's words were: "On this import?
ant acquisition, which adds to our coun?
try territories so extensive and fertile,
and to our citizens, near brethren to par?
take of the blessings of freedom and
self-governm-'iit. I offer to Congress and
the country my sincere congratulations."
How much greater cause for congratu?
lation, after the experience of a century,
?during which time there have been carv?
ed out of the purchase ten States and
two territories, with a population of 14.
000.000. among the most thrifty and en?
terprising people of the globe, whose
wealth is estimated at twenty billion dol?
lars, nnd the annual products of which
are from three to live billion dollars.
I In the light of these facts, the late
President McKinley, in issuing his proc?
lamation inviting all the nations of the
earth to tak0 part In tho commemoration,
aptly speaks of it as "an event of great
Inteijest to (the United! States and of
abiding effect on -'th.llr v?1e\^lopmen*(."
President Roosevelt in his annual mes?
sage says: "It is one of three? or four
great landmarks in our history?the great j
turning-point in our development. It
Is eminently fitting that all of our peo?
ple should join with heartiest good-will
in commemorating it."
No American statesman has ever had
such an imposing memorial as the expo?
sition will be to the great work of Thos.
?Teffcrf-on. tho illustrious Virginian. Out?
side of the benefits to the State in the
exhibit of her material resources, which
will surely attract capital to develop the
same, there are sirong historic and sen?
timental considerations why Virginia,
more than any other State, should take
official part in this centennial. Many of
the States have already taken action,
headed by Illinois', which has made an
appropriation of $250,000.
The Legislatures which will meet this
?winter in different States, have, through
their leading men, indicated their inten?
tion of being represented upon a most
liberal scale.
Without wishing to dictate, it has been
suggested that the Virginia State Build?
ing should be a reproduction of Monti
cello. No building upon the grounds
would be looked upon as more historic,
or would be visited with deeper interest
than the. home of tho author of tho
Louisiana Purchase.
With much propriety, it has been also
suggested that a reproduction of the ro?
tunda at the University, so inseparal.'ly
connected with Jefferson's name, would
be most befitting. But. whatever the
model of the building may be, no argu?
ment seems necessary to insure upon the
part of the old Commonwealth some ap?
propriate building upon the grounds as a
meeting-place for the thousands of her
children scattered over the length and
breadth of this country and as an evi?
dence of her deep interest in the cele?
bration of an event which marks the
work of her illustrious son.
x\s a prominent and public-spiritsd cit?
izen of the State, wc- address this com?
munication to you. earnestly urging the
exertion of your influence, in bringin*:
about official action upon the Pa*"t of
ginia?. . , nt'ii?il?

ROADS TRAIN
Accomplished Excellent Results on Its
Southern Tour.
SEVERAL STATES VISITED.
Good Roads Associations Formed And a New
Era in Road Building Commenced.
Lands Double in Value
Wiih Good Roads..
(Special Dispatch to Thc Times.)
ATLANTA, ga., December 14.?The
past ten days in the work of the South?
ern Railway good-roads' train, the offi?
cials of the Department of Agriculture of
thc National Government and the officers
of thc National Good-Roads' Association
In their campaign for better highways in
the South have been most interesting and
most productive of good results. In
many respects the Montgomery conven?
tion, which was the culmination of the
Alabama work, was the most successful
eo far known in the tour of the. train.
The Alabama conventions, held at Bir?
mingham and Mobile, were district af?
fairs, being for North and South Aala
lama, respectively.
That at Montgomery took In the
?whole Stato and completed the work in
Alabama in a most successful and satis?
factory manner. At the convention
?were delegates from at least two-thirds
of Alabama's? sixty-six counties. Every
Foction of the State was well represented.
The greatest Interest was shown. Every
delegate felt the importance of the. ob?
ject for which the convention was call?
ed and every one was anxious to partici?
pate In the work of putting Alabama
ahead in tho matter of road-building.
If indications count for anything, therei
"svili bo in the near future one of the'
greatest eras in road progress in that
State yet known in the L'nion. It is not
too much to say that thc convention was
the? turning point in tlic agricultural and
commercial development of the State.
Three days Avere given up to convention
?work. The addresses wore all of high
order and of the most practical charac?
ter1. These were deliverd by many
representative Alabamians, as well as by
the gentlemen accompanying the good
roads' train.
EVERY INTEREST REPRESENTED.
Every interest in the State?educational,
Oo you
Know
That two-thirds of thc adult nooulation
of this country are sufferers with Piles
In its various forms? Well, it is a fact,
yet wo do not hesitate to say that all
sufferers can be cured by the use of

religious nnd agricultural?combined in
the con\-ontion work, and every one of
these interests advocated progressive
measures on the part of thc people and
the officials to furtK?r the cause. The
address of President Moore on the open?
ing day touched fully upon the question
from almost every standpoint.
Many of thc illustrations were given up
to the work of the Southern Railway
good-roads' train, showing roads in North
Carolina?, Tennessee and Alabama before
the. work and after it was eompletod. Mr.
M. A. "Hays, of the Southern Railway,
spoke of the relationship between rail?
way transportation and that over the
common highways of the country and. of
the effect improved highways would have
on river, rail and water transportation
and of the development of agricultural
regions now at distant points from rail?
road stations.
SOUTHERN RAILAYAY.
He explained the interest of President
Samuel Spencer and other officials of thc
Southern Railway in the good-roads'
movement, showing that the interest of
that company nnd the people it served
were common, so far as related to this
subject. State Superintendent of Pub?
lic Instruction J. AY. Abevcrombie dis?
cussed the relationship of public schools to
the country roads. He made thc argu?
ment that if the school system of Aala
bama was to be Improved there must be
tirst the improvement of the roads lead?
ing to the school-houses.
Professor Frederick Duggar, of the
State Agricultural and Mechanical School
at Auburn, showed how groat an im
provment there would be in agricultural
interests, and especially in certain por?
tions of the year, by the building of im?
proved thoroughfares.
GOVERNOR'S PROCLAMATION
The convention was participated in by
Governor AYilliam D. Jelks, of that State,
and Commissioner of Agriculture Poole,
the latter of whom presided at all ses?
sions. Governor Jelks took enough in?
terest in the arrangements for this and
the other road conventions to issue a
proclamation, calling thc attention of the
people to the Good-Roads' Conventions.
Up to date, he is the only Governor who
has thus emphasized thc importance of
the road meeting. A State organization
was formed.
Tho Executive Committee at once made
?arrangements to push the work of orga
i nization in every county in Alabama.
The Legislature was asked by resolution
to create the office of Public Highway
Commissioner of the State and to pass
such laws as are needed to further the
interest of improved roads. Of thc six?
ty-six counties in Alabama, five of them
have provided for improved highways,
and they now have country road sys?
tems equal to those of any county in
thc United States. Montgomery has 130
miles, Jefferson 215 miles. Madison 1-0
miles and each of tho other counties a
long distance of the Dcst earth and mac?
adam roads.
LANDS DOUBLE IN VALLE.
Reports from all these counties show
that farm lands had doubled in -A'alue
along thc improved roadways and that
there had been a large increase in all
farm products.
One encocraging feature of the gath?
ering at Montgomery was the presence
of the entire faculty and over four hun?
dred students from the State Agricul?
tural and Mechanical Collego at Auburn,
over 100 miles distant.
AT ATLANTA ,
The train arrived at Atlanta Monday
morning of this week for the first stop
in Georgia, and which is the eighth city
to lie visited o:i the present tour, two
etops each having heretofore been made
in North Carolina and Tennessee and
three In Alabama. An entire week's
stay was scheduled here, with convention
sessions on AVednesday, Thursday and
Friday. The Atlanta road work was
the making of one half-mile of macadam?
ized road and some djrt road on the out?
skirts of Atlanta, on the road leading? to

SICK MADE WELL,

Marvelous Elixir of Life Discovered

Cures Every Known Ailment.
Wonderful Cures are Effected That

The Secret of Long Life of

The Remedy is- Prce to All Who Send

After years of patient study, and delv?
ing into the dusty record of the past, as
well as following modern experiments in
the realms of medical science. Dr. James
XV. Kidd, 1711 First National Bank Build?
ing, Fort Wayne, Ind., makes the start?
ling announcement that he has surely d's
DR. JAMES WILLIAM KIDD.
covered the elixir of life. That he is able
with the aid of a mysterious compound,
known only to himself, produced as a
result of the years he has spent in search?
ing for this precious life-giving boon, to
cure any and every disease that is known
to the human body. There Is no doubt
of the doctor's earnestness in making his
claim, and the remarkable cures that he
is daily effecting seems to bear him out
very strongly. His theory which he ad?
vances is one of reason and based on
sound experience in a medical practice of
many years. It costs nothing to try his
remarkable "Elixir of Life," as he -?alls
it, for be sends it free to any one who is
a sufferer, in sufficient quantities to con?
vince of its ability to cure; so there is
absolutely no risk to run. Some 0f the
cures cited are very remarkable, and but
for reliable witnesses would hardly be
credited. The lame have thrown away
crutches and walked about after two or
three trials of the remedy. The sick,
given up by home doctors, have been re?
stored to their families and friends in
perfect health. Rheumatism, neuralgia,
stomach, heart, liver, kidney, blood and
skin diseases and bladder troubles dis?
appear as by magic. Headaches, back?
aches, nervousness, fevers, consumption,
coughs, colds, asthma, catarrh, bronchitis
and all affections of the throat, lungs or
any vital organs are easily overcome in a
space of time that is simply marvelous.
Partial paralysis, locomotor ataxia,
dropsy, gout, scrofula and piles are quick- !
ly and permanently removed. It puri?
fies the entire system, blood and tissues,
restores normal nerve power, circulation
and a state of perfect health is produced
at once. To the doctor all systems are
alike and equally affected by this great
"Elixir of Life." Send for the remedy to?
day. It is free to every sufferer. State
what yon want to be cured of and tha
sure remedy for it will bo sent you free
by return mail.
Tho convention was attended by people
from almost every section of the Statt
and was a most representative body.
There were representatives of commer?
cial bodies of different counties and a
great many farmers, as well as leading
business men from the towns and cities.
The convention was opened with an ad?
dress -of welcomo on the part of Mr. XV.
L. Henderson, chairman of the Commit?
tee of Arrangements; Mayor Livingstone
Minis, of Atlanta, and President J. K.
Orr, of the Chamber of Commerce.
