What the Sparrow Chirps.
BT PEARL RIVERS.
1 am only a little sparrow,
i' A bird of low degree;
Mv life i 8 of little value,
But the dear Lord careth for me.
He gave me a coat of feathers ;
It is very plain, I know,
With never a speck of crimson,
For it was not made for show.
But it keeps me warm in winter,
I And it shields me from the rain;
Were it bordered with gold or purple,
Perhaps it would make me vain.
And now that the spring-time cometh,
I will build me a little nest,
With many a chirp of pleasure,
In the spot I love the best.
I have no barn or storehouse,
I neither sow nor reap ;
God gives me a sparrow's portion,
But never a seed to keep.
If my meal is sometimes scanty,
Close picking makes it sweet;
I have always enough to feed me,
And "life is more than meat."
I know there are many sparrows;
All over the world we are found,
But our Heavenly Father knoweth
When one of us falls to the ground.
Though small, we are never forgotten;
Though weak we are never afraid ;
For we know that the dear Lord keepeth
The life of the creatures He made.
I fly through the thickest forest,
I light on many a spray;
I have no chart or compass,
But I never lose my way.
. And I fold my wings at twilight,
Wherever I happen to be;
For the Father is always watching,
And no harm will come to me.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Senate and Bouse of Representatives:
In addressing my third annual message to the
law-making branch of the government, it is i
gratifying to be able to state that during the
past year su cess has generally attended the ef
fort to execute all laws found upon the statute
books—the policy has been not to enquire into i
the wisdom of the laws already enacted, but to I
learn their spirit and intent, and to enforce I
them accordingly.
The past year has, under a wise Providence, 1
been one of general prosperity to the nation, i
It has, however, been attended with more than s
usual chastisements in the loss of life and pro- i
perty by storm and fire. These disasters have (
served to call forth the best elements of human I
nature in our country, and to develop a friend- i
ship for us on the part of foreign nations which l
goes far towards alleviating the distress ocoa- i
sioned by these calamities. The benevolent, 1
who have so generously shared their means .
with the victims of these misfortunes, will reap '
their reward in the consciousness of having per
formed a noble act, and in receiving the grate- '
fui thanks of men, women and children, whose
sufferings they have relieved.
The relations of the United States with for- i
eign powers continue to be friendly. The year i
has been an eventful one in witnessing two great
nations, speaking one language and having one I
lineage, settling by peaceful arbitration disputes
of long standing, and liable at any time to i
bring those nations into bloody and costly con
flict. An example has thus been set, which, if l
successful in its final issue, may be followed by i
other civilized nations, and finally be the means i
of returning to productive industry, millions of <
men now maintained to settle the disputes of <
nations by the bayonet and the broadside. I; I
transmit herewith a copy of the treaty allu- i
ded to, which has been concluded, since the ad- i
journment of Congress, with her Britannic t
Majesty, and a copy of the protocols of the <
conferences of the commissioners by whom it i
was negotiated. This treaty provides methods <
for adjusting the questions pending between the I
two nations. Various questions are to be ad- !
justed by arbitration. 1 recommend Congress i
at an early day to make the necessary provision
for the. tribunal at Geneva and for the several
commissions on the part of the United States
called for by the treaty. llis Majesty the King
ot Italy, the President of ths Swiss Confedera- .
tion, and his Majesty the Emperor of Brazil,
have each consented, on the joint request of
the two powers, to name an arbitrator for the
tribunal at Geneva. I have caused my taanks
to be suitably expressed for the readiness with j
which the joint request has been complied with,
by the appointment of gentlemen of eminence
and learning to these important positions. His
Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, has been
pleased to comply with thejoiut request of the
two governments, and has consented to act as
the arbitrator of the disputed water boundary
between the United States and Great Britain.
The contracting parties in the treaty have un
dertaken to regard as between themselves cer
tain principles of public law for which the
United States have contended from the com
mencement of their history. They have also
agreed to bring these principles to the knowl
edge of the o ; her maritime powers, and to in
vite them to accede to them. Negotiations are
going on as to the form cf the note by which
the invitation is to be extended to the other
Powers. I recommend the legislation necessa
ry on the part of the United States to bring in
to operation the articles of the treaty relating
to the fisheries and to other matters touching
the relations of the United States towards the
British North American possessions, to become
operative so soon as the proper legislation shall
be had on the part of Great Britain and its
possessions. It is much to be desired that this
legislation may become operative before the
fishermen of the United States begin to make
their arrangements for the coming season. I
have addressed a communication, of which a
copy is transmitted herewith, to tha Governors
of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana,
Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin, urging upon
the governments ot those States, respectively,
the necessary action on their part to carry into
, effect the object of tbe article of the treaty
which contemplates the use of the canals on
either side connected with the navigation of the
lakes and rivers forming the boundary on terms
r of equality by the inhabitants of both coun
tries. It is hoped that the importance of the
object and the benefits to flow therefrom will
. stcuie the speedy approval and legislative sanc
i tion of the States concerned.
1 renew the recommendation for an appropri
ation ior determining the true position of the
forty ninth parallel of latilude where it forms
the boundary between the United States and
the Briti-h North American possessions be
tween the lake of the Woods and the summit
* ol the Reeky Mountains. The early action of
Congress un this recommendation would put it
, in the power of the war department to place a
force iv the field during the next summer. —
' The re-Utii ption of diplomatic relations between
Prance and Germany have enabled me to give
directions lor the withdrawal of* the protection
extended to Germans in Prance by the diplo
* matic and consular representations of the Uni
ted States in that country. It is just to add
) that the delicate duty of this protection has
3 been performed by the minister and the con
sul-general at Pans, aud the various consuls in
* France, under the supervision ot the latter,
' with great kindness, as well as with prudence
and tact. Their course has received the com
- mendation of tbe German government, aud has
" wounded no su-ceptihility of the Freuch. The
government ot the Emperor of Gemany con
tinues to mauifest a tiiendiy feeling towards
the Uuiied Siates, and a desire to harmonize
with the moderate and just policy which this
government maintaius in its relations with
Asiatic Powers, as well as with the South
American republics. I have given assurance
STAUNTON, VA., TUESDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1871.
/&*'sfak
that the friendly feelings of that government
are fully shared by the United States. The
ratification of the consular and naturalization
conventions with the Austro-Hungarian Em
pire have been exchanged. I have been offi
cially informed of the annexation of the States
of the Church to the Kingdom of Italy, and
the removal of the capital of that kingdom to
Rome.
In conformity with the established policy of
the United States I have recognized this change.
The ratifications of the new treaty of commerce
between the Unired States and Italy have been
exchanged. The two powers have agreed in
this treaty that private property at sea shall be
exempt from capture in case of war between
the two powers. The United States has spared
no opportunity of incorporating this rule into
the obligation of nations. The Forty-first Con
gress, at its third session, made an appropria
tion for the organization of a mixed Commis
sion for adjudicating upon the claims of citizens
of the United States against Soain growing out
of the insurrection in Cuba. That Commission
has since been organized. I transmit herewith
the correspondence relating to its formation
and its jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that this
Commission will afford the claimants a com
plete remedy for their injuries. It has been
made the agreeable duty of the United States
to preside over a Conference at Washington
between the plenipotentiaries ot Spain and the
allied South American republics which has re
sulted in an armistice, with the reasonable as
surance of a permanent peace.
The intimate friendly relations which have so
long existed between the United States and
Russia continue undisturbed. Tbe visit of the
third son of the Emperor is a proof that there
is no desire on the part of his government to
diminish the cordiality of those relations. The
hospitable reception which has been given to
the Grand Duke is a proof that on our side we
share the best wishes of that government. The
inexcusable course of the Russian Minister, at
Washington, rendered it necessary to ask his
re-call, and (o decline to longer receive that '
functionary as a diplomatic representative. Tt
was impossible, with self respect, or with a just '
regard to the dignity of the country, to permit I
Mr. Catacazy to continue to hold intercourse
with this government aft> r his personal abuse i
of government officials, and during his persis- i
tent interference, through various means, with
the relations bi-tweeD tho United States and
. .1
other powers
In accordance with my wishes, the govern- I
ment has been relieved of further intercourse
with Mr. Catacazy, and the management of tbe i
affairs of the Russian legation has passed into I
the hands of a gentleman entirely unobjec- 1
tionable. I
With Japan we continue to maintain intimate •
relations. The cabinet of the Mikado has, 1
since the close of the last session of Congress,
selected citizens of the United States to serve
in offices of importance in several departments
of government. I have reason to think that
this selection is due to an appreciation of the i
disinterestedness of th>j policy which the Uni- I
ted States have pursued towards Japan. It is i
our desire to continue to maintain this disinte
rested and just policy with China as well as |
Japan. The correspondence transmitted here- I
with shows that there is no disposition on the i
part of the government lo swerve from its es- i
tablisbed course.
Prompted by a desire to put an end to the :
barbarous treatment of our ship-wrecked sai
lors on the Corean coast, 1 instructed our min
ister at Pekin to endeavor to conclude a con- i
vention with Cores for securing the safety and
humane treatment of such marines. Admiral
Rodgers was instructed to accompany him with
a sufficient force to proteel him incase of need.
A small surveying pany sent out, on reaching
the coast, was treaeberoU-_f attacked at a dis- t
advantage. Ample opportunity was given for
explanation and apology for the insult. Neither ;
came. A force was then landed. After an ar- i
duous march, over a rugged and difficult coun- i
try, ihe forts from wbich the outrages had been
committed Wore reduced by a gallant assault
and were destroyed. Having thus punished i
the criminals, and having vindicated the honor
of the flag, the expedition returned. Finding i
it impracticable, under the circumstances, to i
conclude^ the desired convention, I respectfully i
refer to the correspondence relating thereto,
herewith submitted, and leave tbe subject for i
such action as Congress may see best to take.
Tbe republic of Mexico has not yet repealed
the very objectionable laws establishing what is
known as the "free zone on the frontier oi
the United Statts It is hoped that this may
yet be done, and also that moie stringent meas
ures may be taken by that republic for restrain
ing lawless persons on its frontiers. I hope
that Mexico, by its own action, will soon relieve
tfsis government of the difficulties experienced
Irom these causes.
Our relations with (b_ various republics of
Central and South Aineiica continue, with one
exception, to be cordial aud friendly.
1 recommend sotue aedoii of Congress regard
ing the overdue instalments under the award
of the Venzueian Claims Commission of 1866.
The internal di-sensioos of this government
present no justification for the absence of effort
to meet their -oieuari treaty obligations.
The ratification of an extradidon treaty with
Nicaragua has been exchanged.
It is a subject for congratulation that the
great Empire of Brazil has taken the initiator;
step towards the abolition of slavery. Our re
lations with that Empire, always cordial, will
naturally be made moie so by this act. It is
not too much to hope that tbe government, of
Brazil may hereafter find it tor its interest as
well as intrinsically right to advance toward en
tire emancipation more rapidly than the present
act contemplates.
The true prosperity and greatness of a nation
is to be found in the elevation and education of
its laborers. It is a subject for regret that the
reforms in this direction, which were volunta
rily promised by the statesmen of Spain, have
not been carrier! cut in its West India colonies.
The laws and regulations for the apparent abo
lition of slavery iv Cuba and Porto iiico leave
most of the laborers in bondage, with no hope
of release, until their lives become a burden to j
their employers. I desire to direct your atten
tion to the fact, that citizens of the United
States, cr persons claiming to be citizens of the
United States, are large holders in ioreign lands
of this species of property, forbidden by the
fundamental law of their alleged country. I
recommend to Congress to provide, by stringent
legislation, a suitable remedy against the hold
ing, owning or dealing in slaves, or being inter
ested in slave property in foreign lands, either
as owners, hirers or mortgages, by citizens ot
the United States.
It is to be regretted that the disturbed condi
tion of the Island ol Cuba continues to be a
source of annoyance and of anxiety. The ex
istence of a protracted struggle in such close
proximity to our own territory, without appa
rent prospect of an early termination, cannot
be other than an object of concern to p> opie
who, while abstaining from interference in the
affairs of otber powers, naturally desire to see
every country ia the undisturbed enj tyment of
peace, liberty, and the blessings of tree institu
tions. Our naval commanders in Cuban waters
have been instructed, in case it should become
necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives
and property of bona Jide American citizens,
and to maintain the diguby of the flag. It is
hoped that all pending questions with Spain,
growing out ol the affairs in Cuba, may be ad
justed iv the spirit of peace and conciliation,
which has hitherto guided the two powers in
their treatment oi such questions.
To give importance and to add to the effi
ciency of our diplomatic relations with Japan
and China, aud to further aid in reiaining the
good opinion of these people, and to secure to
the United States its share of the commerce
destined to flu* between those nations and the
balance of the commercial world, I earnestly re
commend that an appropriation be made to
support at least four American youths in each
of ihose countries to serve as a part of the offi
cial family ot our ministers there. Our repre
sentatives would not even then be placed upon
jptteisf.
an equality with the representatives of Great
Britain and of some other powers. As now
situated our representatives in Japan and China
have to depend for interpreters and translators
upon natives of those countries who know our
language imperlectly, or procure for the occa
sion the services of employees of foreign busi
ness houses or the interpreters to other foreign
ministers. I would also recommend liberal
measures for the purpose of supporting the
American lines of steamers now plying between
San Francisco and Japan and China and the
Australian line —almost our only remaining
lioes of ocean steamers —and of increasing their
subsidies.
The national debt has been reduced to the
extent of eighty-six millions fifty-seven thou
sand one hundred and twenty-six dollars and
eighty cents during the year, and by the nego
tiatiou of national bonds at a lower rate of in
terest the interest on the public debt has been
so diminished that now the sum to be raised for
the interest account is nearly seventeen million
dollars less than on the Ist of March, 1869. It
was highly desirable that this rapid diminution
should take place both to strengthen the credit
of the country and to convince its citizens of
their entire anility to meet every dollar of lia
bility without bankrupting them ; but in view
of the accomplishment of these desirable ends,
of the rapid development of the resources of
the country, its increasing ability to meet large
demands and the amount already paid, it i 3 not
desirable that the present resources of the coun
try should continue to be taxed in order to con
tinue this rapid payment. I, therefore, recom
mend a modification of both the tariff and in
ternal tax laws. I recommend that all taxes
from internal sources be abolished, except those
collected from spirituous, vinous, and malt
liquors, tobacco io its various forms and from
stamps.
In readjusting the tariff, I suggest that a care
ful estimate be made of the amount of surplus
revenue collected under tho present laws after
providing for the current expenses of the gov
ernment, the interest account, and a sinking
fund, and that this surplus be reduced in such
a manner as to afford the greatest relief to the
greatest number. There are many articles not
produced at home, but which enter largely into
general consumption through articles which are
manufactured at'home, such as medicines com
pounded, &•_., irom which very little revenue
is derived, but which enter into general use. —
All such articles I recommend to be placed on
the 'free list." should a further reduction
prove advisable, I would then recommend that
it be made upon those articles which can best
bear it without disturbing home production, or
reducing the wages of American labor. I have
not entered into figures, because to do so would
be to repeat what will be laid before you in the
report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
The present laws for collecting the revenue
pay collectors of customs small salaries, but
provide for moieties, shares in all seizures,
which at principal ports of entry particularly,
raise the compensation of these officials to a
large sum. It has always seemed to me as ii
this system must at times work perniciously.—
It holds out an inducement to dishonest men,
should such get possession of those offices, to
be lax in their scrutiny of goods entered to en
able them finally to make large seizures. Your
attention is respectfully invited to this subject.
Continued fluctuations in the value of gold,
as compared with the national currency, has a
most damaging effect upon the increase and de
velopment of the country in keeping up prices
of all artices necessary in every day liie It
fosters a species of gambling prejudicial alike to
national morals and the national finance- If
the question can be met as to how to give a fixed
value to our currency, that value constantly and
uniformly approaching par with specie, a very
desirable end will be gained.
For the operations of the army in the past
year, the expense of maintaining it, the esti
mates for the ensuing year, aud for continuing
sea coast and other improvements, conducted
under the supervision of the War Department,
I refer you to the accompanying report of the
Secretary of War.
1 call your attention to the provisions of the
act of Congress approved March 3, 1569, which
discontinues promotion in the staff corps of the
army until provided ior by law. I recommend
that the number of officers iv each grade in the
staff corps be fixed, and that whenever the num
ber in any one grade lulls below the number so
hied that the vacancy may be filled by promo
tion from the grade below. I also recommend
that when the office of chief of a corps becomes
vacant, the place may be filled by selectiou from
the corps in which the vacancy exists.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows
an improvement in the number and efficiency
of the naval force, without materia) increase in
the expense of supporting it. This is due to
the policy which has beeu adopted, and is being
extended as fast as our material will admit, of
using smaller vessels as cru'seis on lhe several
stations. By this means we have beeu enabled
to occupy at once a large exrent of cruising
ground, to visit more frequently the posis where
the presence of our flag is desirable, and gen
erally to discharge more efficiently the appro
priate duties of the navy in time of peace, with
out exceeding the number of men or the expendi
ture authorized by law.
During the past year the navy has, in addi
tion to its regular service, supplied the men and
officers for the vessel- of the coast survey, and
has completed the surveys authorized by Con
gress of the Isthmus of Darien and Tehaunte
pec, and under like authority ha 3st ".it out an
expedition completely furnished and equipped
to explore the unknown ocean of the -North.
The suggestions of the report as to the ne
cessity for increasing and improving the mate
rial of the navy and the plan recommended for
reducing the personnel el the service to a peace
standard, by the gradual abolition of certain
grades of officers, the reduction of others, and
the employment of some in the service of the
commercial marine, are well eousidered and de
serve the thoughtful attention of Congress.
I also recommend that ail promotions in the
navy above the rank of captain be by selection
instead of by seniority. This course will secure
in the higher grades greater efficiency and hold
out an incentive to young officers to improve
themselves in the knowledge of their profession.
The present cost of maintaining the navy, its
cost compared with that of the preceding year,
and the estimates for the ensuing year, are
contained iv the accompanying report of the
Secretary of the Navy.
The enlarged receipts of the Postoffice De
partment, as shown by the accompanying report
of tbe Postmaster General, exhibits a gratify
ing increase in that bra_ch of the public service.
It is the iudex of the growth of education and
of the prosperity of the people—elements high
ly conducive to the vigor aad stability of repub
lics
With a vast territory like ours, much of it
sparsely populated, but all requiring the ser
vices of the mail, it is not at present to be ex
pected that this department can be made self
sustaining ; but a gradual approach to this end,
from year to year, is confidently relied on, and
the day is not far distant when the Postoffice
Department of the government will piove a
much greater blessing to the whole people than
it is now. The suggestions of tbe Postmaster
General for improvements in the department
presided over by him are earnestly recommend
ed to your special attention. Especially do I
recommend favorable consideration of the plan
for uniting the telegraphic system of the United
States with the postal system.
It is believed that by such a course tbe cost of
telegraphing could be much reduced, and the
service as well, if not better rendered. It would
secure the further advantage of extending the
telegraph through portions of the country
where private enterprise wiil not construct it.
Commerce, trade, aud, above all, the efforts to
bring a people widely separated into a coniaiu
niry ot iutercst, are always benefited by a rapid
intercommunication. Education, the ground
work of republican institutions, is encouraged
by increasing the facilities to gather news from
all parts of the country. The desire to reap the
benefit of such improvements will stimulate
t education
I I refer you to the report of the Postmaster
i General for full details of the operations of last
i year, and for comparative statements of results
• with former years._
There has been imposed upon the Executive
branch of the government the execution of the
, act of Congress approved April 20, 1871, and
commonly known as the Ku-Klux law, in a por
i tion of the State of South Carolina. The ne
cessity of the course pursued will be demonstrat
ed by the report of the committee to investi
gate Southern outrages. Under the provisions
of the above act, I issued a proclamation calling
the attention of the people of the United States
to the same, and declaring my reluctance to ex
ercise any of the extraordinary powers thereby
conferred upon me, except in case of imperative
necessity, but making known my purpose to
exercise such powers whenever it should become
necessary to do so for the purpose of securing
to all citizens of the United States the peaceful
enjoyment of the rights guaranteed to them by
the Constitution and the laws.
After the passage of this law, information
was received from time to time that combina
tions of the character referred to in this law ex
isted, and were powerful in many parts of the
Southern States, particularly in certain counties
in the State of South Carolina. Careful inves
tigation was made, and it was ascertained that
in nine counties in that State such combinations
were active and powerful, embracing a sufficient
portion of the citizens to control the local au
thority, and having, among other things, the
object of depriving the emancipated class of the
substantial benefits of freedom and of prevent
ing the free political action of those citizens who
did not sympathize with their own views. A
mong their operations were frequent scourgings
and occasional assassinations, generally perpe
trated at night by disguised persons,—tbe vic
tims in almost all cases being citizens of different
political sentiments from their own, or freed
persons, who had shown a disposition to claim
equal rights with other citizens. Thousands of
inoffensive and well-disposed citizens were the
sufferers by this lawless violence.
Thereupon, on the 12th of October, 1871, a
proclamation was issued in terms of the law,
calling upon the members of these combinations
to disperse within five days and to deliver to
the marshal or military officers of the United
States all arms, ammunition,uniforms.disguises,
and other means and implements used by them
for carrying out their unlawful purposes. This
warning not having been heeded, on the 17th
of October another proclamation was issued
suspeudmg the privileges of the writ of habeas
corpus in nine counties in that State.
Direction was given that within the counties
so designated, persons supposed, upon credita
ble information, to be members of such unlaw
ful combinations, should be arrested by the mili
tary forces of the Uuited States and delivered
to the marshal to be dealt with according to law.
In two ot said counties (York andSpananburg)
many arrests have beeu made. At the last ac
count the number of persons thus arres-ted was
one hundred and sixty-eight. Several hundred,
whose criminality was ascertained to be of an
inferior degree, were released for the present.
These have generally made confession of
their guilt. Great caution has been exercised i
in making these arrests, and notwithstanding '
the iarge number, it is believed that no inno
cent person is now in custody. The prisoners
will be held for regular trial in the judicial tri
bunals of the Uuited States. As soon as it
appeared that the authorities of the United
States were about to take vigorous measures to
enforce the law, many persons absconded, and
there is good ground for supposiug that all ot
such persons have violated the law. A full re
port of what has been done under this law will
be submitted to Congress by the Attorney-
General.
In Utah there still remains a remnant of bar
barism repugnant to civilization, to decency,
and to the laws of the United States. Terri
torial officers, however, have been found who
are willing to perform their duty iv a spirit ot
j equity and with a due sense of sustaining the
majesty of the law. Neither polygamy nor
any other violation of existing statutes wiil be
permuted withiu the territory of the United
Stales It is not with the religion of the selt
btylel saints that we are now dealing, but with
their practices. They will be protect-d in the
worship of Uod according to the dictates of
their consciences, but they will not. be permit
ted to violate the laws under the cloak of re
ligion. It may be advisable for Congress to
consider what, in the execution of the laws
against polygamy, is to be the status of plural
wives a_d their offspriog.
The propriety ot Congress passing an en
abling act authorizing the territorial legislature
of Utah to legitimize ail children born prior to
a time fixed in the act might be justified by its
humanity to these innocent children. This is a
suggestion only, and not a recommendation.
The poiicy pursued towards the Indians bus
resulted favorably, so far as can be judged
from the limited time during which it has been
in operation. Tnrongh the exertions oi the
vinous societies of Christians, to whom has
been entrusted the execution oi the policy,
and the board of commissioners authorized by
the law of April 10, 1869, many tribes of In
dians have been induced to settle upon reser
vations, to cultivate tbe soil, to perform pro
ductive labor of various kinds, and to partial
ly accept civilization. They are being cared
lor in such a way, it is hoped, as to induce
those still pursuing their old habits of life to
embrace the only opportunity which is left
them to avoid extermination. I recommend
liberal appropriations to carry out the Indian
peace policy, not only because it is humane,
Christian-like and economical, but because it is
right.
I recommend to your favorable consideration
also the policy of granting a territorial govern
ment to Indians in the Indian territory west of
Arkansas aod Missouri and south of Kansas.
In doing so every right guarantied to the Indi
ans by treaty should be secured. Such a course
might in time be the means of collecdng most
of the Indians now between the Missouri and
the Pacific and south of the British possessions
into one territory or one State. The Secretary
of the luterior has treated upon the subject at
length, and I commend to you his suggestions
I renew my recommendation that the public
lands be regarded as a heritage to our children,
to be disposed of only as required for occupa
tion, and to actual settlers. Those already
granted have beeu in great part disposed of in
such a way as to secure access to the balance by
the hardy settler who may wish to avail him
self of them. But caution should be exercised
even in attaining so desirable an object.
Educational iuterests may well be served by
the grant of the proceeds of the sale of public
lands to settlers. Id ■ not wish to be under
stood as recommending, in the least degree,
a curtailment of what is being done by the gen
eral government for the encouragement of ed
ucation.
The report of the Secretary of the Interior,
submitted with this, will give you all the infor
mation collected and prepared for publication
in regard to the census taken during the year
1870, the operations of the Bureau of Educa
tion ior the year, the Pateut office, the Pension
office, the Land office, and the Indian Bureau.
The report of the Commissioner of Agricul
ture gives the operations of his department for
the year. As agriculture is the groundwork
of our prosperity, too much importance can
uor be attached to the iabors of this depart
ment. It is in the bauds of an able head, with
able assistant, ali zealously devoted to intro
ducing into the agricultural production of the
nation ail useful products adapted to any of
the various climates and soils of our vast terri
tory, and to giving ali useful informatiop as to
the method of cultivating the plants, cereals,
and otber products adapted to particular local
ities. Quietly but surely the Agricultural Bu
reau is working a great material god, and if
liberally supported, the more widely its influ
ence wiil be extended and the less dependent
we shail be upon the products of foreign coun
tries.
The subject of compensation to the heads of
Number 12.
■B^———___________
Bureaus and officials holding positions of re
sponsibility, and requiring ability and character
to fill properly, is one to which your attention
is invited. But few of the officials receive a
compensation equal to the respectable support
of a family, while their duties are such as to
involve millions of interest. Ia private life
services demand compensation equal to the ser
vices rendered, and wise economy would dictate
the same rule in the government service. I
have not given the estimate for the support of
government for the edsuing year, nor the com
parative statement between the expenditures
for the year just passed and the one just pre
ceding, because all these figures are contained
in the accompanying reports, or in those pre
sented directly to Congress. These estimates
have my approval.
More than 6ix years having elapsed since the
la_t hostile gun was fired between the armies
then arrayed against each other—one for the
perpetuation, the other for the destruction of
the Union—it may well be considered whether
it is not now time that the disabilities imposed
by tho XlVth amendment should be removed.
That amendment does not exclude the ballot,
but oo'y imposes the disability to hold offices
upon certain classes. When the purity of the
ballot is secure, majorities are sure to elect of
ficers reflecting the views of the majority. I
do not see the advantage or propriety of ex
cluding men from office, merely because they
were, before the rebellion, of standing and char
acter sufficient to be elected to positions requir
ing them to take oaths to support the consti
tution, aod admitting to eligibility those enter
taming precisely the same views, but of less
standing in their communities.
It may be said that the former violated an
oath, while the latter did not. The iatter did
not have the power to do so. If they had ta
ken this oath, it cannot be doubted they would
have broken it as did the former class. If
there are any great criminals distinguished a
bove all others, for the part they took in opposi
tion to the government, they might, in the judg
ment of Congress, be excluded from such an
amnesty. This subject is submitted for your
careful consideration.
The condition of the Southern States is, un
happily, not such as all true patriotic citizens
would like to see. Social ostracism for opin
ion's sake, personal violence, or threats to
wards persons entertaining political views op
posed to those entertained by tho majority of
the old citizens, prevents immigration and the
flow of much-needed capital into the States
lately in rebellion. It will be a happy condi
tion of the country when tho old citizens of
these States will take an interest in public af
fairs, promulgate ideas honestly entertained,
vote for meu representing their views ami tol
erate the same freedom of expression and bal
lot in those entertaining different political con
victions.
Under the provisions of the act of Congress
approved February 21st, 1871, a territorial
government was organized in the District of
Columbia. Its results have thus far fully re
alized the expectations of its advocates. Un
der the direction of the territorial officers a
system of improvement has been inaugurated
by means of which Washington is rapidly be
coming a city worthy of the nation's capital.—
The citizens of the District have voluntarily
taxed themselves to a largo amount for the
purpose of contributing to the adornment of
the seat of government. I recommend liberal
appropriations on the part of Congress, ia or
der that the government may bear its just share
of the expense of carrying out a judicious sys
tem ot improvements.
By the great fire in Chicago, the most im
portant of the government buildings in that
city were consumed. Those burned had al
ready become inadequate to tha wants of the
government in that growing city, and, looking
to the near future, were totally inadequate. 1
recommend, therefore, that an appropriation
be made immediately to purchase the remain
der of the square on which the burned build
ings stood, provided it can be purchased at a
fair valuation, or provided that the Legislature
of Illinois wiil pass a law authorizing its con
demnation for government purposes ; and also
an appropriation of as much money as can
properly be expended towards the erection of
new buildings during the next fiscal year.
The number ol immigrants, ignorant of our
laws, habits, &c, coming into our country an
nually, has become so gieat, and the imposi
tions praciie.d upon them so numerous and fla
grant, that I suggest Congressional action for
their protection. It seems to me a fair subject
of legislation by Congress. I cannot now state
as fully as I desire the nature of the com
plaints made by immigrants of the treatment
they receive, but will endeavor to do so during
the session of Congress, particularly if the sub
ject should receive your attention.
It has been the aim of the administration to
enforce honesty and efficiency in all public offi
ces. Every public servant who has violated
the trust placed iv him, h»s been proceeded
against with aii the rigor of the law. If bad
men have secured places, it has been the fault
of the system established by law and custom
' for making appointments, or the fauit of those
j who recommend for government positions per-
sons not sufficiently well known to them per
sonally, or who give letters endorsing the char
acters of office-seekers, without a proper sense
of the grave responsibility winch such a course
devolves upon them. A civil service reform,
which can correct this abuse, ia much desired.
In mercantile pursuits the business man who
gives a letter of recommendation to a friend to
enable him to obtain credit fr m a stranger, is
regarded as morally responsible for the integri
ty of his friend and his ability to meet his ob
ligations. A reformatory law which would en
force this principle against all endorsers of per
sons for public place would insure great cau
tion in making recommendations. A salutary
lesson has been taught the careless aud the
dishonest public servant in the great number
of prosecutions aod convictions of the last two
years.
It is gratifying to notice the favorable change
which is taking place throughout the country
in bringing to punishment those who have
proven recreant to the trusts confided to them,
and in elevating to public office none but those
who possess the confidence of the honest and
the virtuous, who, it will always be found, com
prise the majority of the community in which
they live.
In my message to Congress one year ago, 1
urgently recommended a reform in the civil
service of the couutry. In conformity with
that recommendation, Congress, in the ninth
section of "an act making appropriations for
sundry civil expenses of the government and
for other purposes," approved March 3d, 1871,
gave the necessary authority to the Executive
to inaugurate a civil service reform, and placed
upon him th- power of doing so. Uuder the
authority of said act, I convened a board of
geutlemen, eminently qualified lor the work,
to devise rules and regulations to effect the
needed reform. Their labors are not yet com
plete, but it is believed that they wiil succeed
in devising a plan which can be adopted to the
great relief of the Executive, the heads of de
partments and Members of Congress, and
which will redound to the true interests of the
public service. At all events the experiment
shall have a fair trial. I have thus hastily
summed up the operations ot the government
during the last year, aud made such sugges
tions as occur to me to be proper for your con
sideration. I submit them with a confidence
that your combined acrion will be wbe, states
manlike, and in the best interests of tbe whole
country. U. S. GRANT.
Executive Mansion, December 4'.h, 1871.
A little boy had lived for some time with a
penurious une'e. The latter was one day walk
ing out, with the child by bis side, when a friend,
accompani'd by a grayhound, addressed him.
The little fellow never having seen a dog of so
slim and slight a texture, clasped the creature
around the neck, with the impassioned cry,
"Oh, doggie! doggie 1 do yon live with your
uncle, too, that you are so thin?"
The latest things out—cats on the back shed.
