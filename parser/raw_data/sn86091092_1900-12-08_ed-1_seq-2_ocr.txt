THE PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE.
Presidential messages, like presi
dential elections, have their good
points. Upon the convening of
each session of Congress it is the
custom and duty of the President to
inform the Congress of the relations
of the government with other gov
ernments and of the state of domes
tic affairs, with a view to enacting
such legislation as the conditions
thus disclosed might . require.
Thomas Jefferson originated the
custom of sending a written mes
sage to Congress instead of deliver
ing a personal address, and doubt
less for the same reason that he also
put an effectual stop to the clamor
of cabinet officers for the privilege
of appearing before Congress to
argue and contend for their proposed
measures. However, the use of the
presidential message to communi
cate to Congress such legislation as
the executive deems wise and
timely is now practically obsolete,
and the occasion is rather made one
for retrospect and gratulation. For
instance, in President McKinley's
latest message there is no legislation
either specially urged or discouraged,
although there are several questions
pending of great national portent
like the Nicaragua Canal, subsi
dies for ships, relations with colonial
empire, the trusts, and so on, that
might with great propriety be given
particular executive weight in one
direction or another, but are in fact
in the extremest case given only a
mild and formatassent. The power
the executive will wield in such
legislation is therefore not what is
derived from a bold and ringing
plea to the country for or against
pending measures, but from influ
ence exerted privately upon mem
bers for their support of the admin
istration program. Meanwhile the
President's message is still extant,
and since it no longer serves the
purpose of directing legislation it
has come to have another meaning,
and this it meets admirably. It
now simply tells in more or less
ornate and loftly phrase the stoiy
of the nation's r progress and partici
pation in world events and gives
the citizen fine ideas of national
virtue and justice and purpose, un
tainted by partisan sophistry or
selfish advantage. In his message
the President speaks to the whole
country, belongs to the whole
country, and for the time being
there is no rift or discord in the fair
picture of national grandeur and
power drawn with such simple dig
nity by the hands cho-en to hold
the national name highest among
all other things in the world.—

IN PRAISE OF NEVADA.
"In the last decade the popula
tion of Nevada has fallen off more
than 3000, but" says Ambrose
Bierce, "Nevada is still populous
enough to have a store and a black
smith shop, a watering trough, two
United States Senators (not very
good ones) and brilliant prospects
behind it. Its exports last year
were three potatoes hurled across
the state liue at a California orator
denouncing sin. The balance of
trade has always been in favor of
Nevada, which buys nothing abroad
and sells offices to non-residents
only. The capital is Carson Cross
Roads, but the governor lives in
Arizona for his health. The legis
lature meets in the Central Pacific
Railway office in San Francisco.
Nevada is sometimes called 'The
Battle-Born State,' because it slip
ped into the Union when everybody
was watching Pickett's charge at
Gettysburg. At that time all the
inhabitants, it was said, could have
sat in the shade of a single tree, but
there was no tree. Now there are
two."

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE,
(Continued from page 1.)
RURAL FREE DELIVERY EXTENDED
"The continued and rapid growth
of the free postal service is a sure
index of the great and increasing
business activity of the country.
This most striking new develop
ment is the extension of rural free
delivery. This has come almost
wholly within the last year. At
the beginning of the fiscal year
1899-1900, the number of routes in
operation was only 391, and most
of these had been running less than
twelve months. On the 15th of
November, 1900, the number had
increased to 2,614, reaching into
forty-four States and Territories
and serving a population of 1,801,
524. The number of applications
now pending and awaiting action
nearly equals all those granted up
to the present time, and by the
close of the current fiscal year about
4,000 routes will have been estab
lished, providing for the daily de
livery of mails at the scattered
homes of about three and a half
millions of rural population. This
service ameliorates the isolation of
farm life, conduces to good roads
and quickens and extends the dis
semination of general information.
Experience thus far has tended to
allay the apprehension that it
would be so expensive as to forbid
its general adoption or make it a
general burden. Its actual appli
cation has shown that it increases
postal receipts and can be accom
plished by reductions in other
branches of the service, so that the
augmented revenuer» and the ac
complished savings together mate
rially reduce the net cost. The
evidences which point to these con
elusions arq, presented in detail in
the annual report of the postmaster
general, which, with its recom
mendations, is recommended to the
consideration of Congress. The
full development of this special ser
vice requires such an outlay of
money that should be undertaken
only after a careful study and thor
ough understanding of all that it
involves.
alaskan boundary.
"The work of marking certain
provisional boundary points, for
convenience of administration,
around the head of Lynn canal, in
accordance with the temporary
rangement of October, 1899, was
completed by a joint survey in July
last. The modus vivendi has so far
worked without .friction and the
Dominion government has provided
rules and regulations for securing to
our citizens the benefit of the recip
rocal stipulation that the citizens or
subjects of either power found by
that agreement within the tempor
arv jurisdiction of the other shall
suffer 110 diminution of rights and
privileges they have hitherto en
joyed. But however necessary
such an expedient may have been
to tide over the grave emergencies
of the situation, it is at best but an
unsatisfactory makeshift, which
should noc be suffered to delay the
speedy and complete establishment
of the frontier line to which we are
entitled under the Russo-American
treaty for the cession of Alaska.
"In this relation I may refer
again to the need of definitely mark
ing the Alaskan boundary where it
follows the 141st meridian. A con
vention to that end has been before
the Senate for some two years, but
as no action has been, I contem
plate negotiating a new convention
for a joint determination of the me
ridian by telegraphic observations.
These, it is believed, will give more
accurate and unquestionable results
than the sidereal methods hereto
fore independently followed, which,
as is known, proved discrepant at
several points on the line, although
not varying at any place more than
700 feet.
AMERICAN POLICY OUTLINED.
"As was said, 'the policy of the
government of the United States is
to seek a solution which may bring
about permahet safety and peace
to China, preserve territorial ad
ministrative entity, protect all rights
guaranteed to friendly powers by
treaty and international law, and
safeguard for the world the princi
ple for the equal and impartial trade
with all parts of the Chinese em
pire.'
"Faithful to those professions
which, as it proved, reflected the
views and purposes of the other oc
operating governments, all our ef
forts have been directed toward end
ing the anomolous situation in
China by negotiations for a settle
ment at the earliest possible mo
ment. As soon as the sacred duty
of relieving our legation and its de
pendents was accomplished we with
drew from active hostilities, leav
ing our legation under an adequate
guard in Pékin as a channel of ne
gotiation and settlement—a course
adopted by others of the interestèd
powers. Overtures of the empower
ed representatives of the Chinese
emperor have been considerately
entertained.
"The Russian proposition look
ing to the restoration of the imper
ial power in Pekin has been accept
ed as in full consonance with our
own desires, for we have held and
hold that effective reparation for
wrongs suffered and an enduring
settlement that will make their re
currence impossible can best be
brought about under an authority
which the Chinese nation reverence
and obeys. While so doing we
forego no jot of our undoubted
right to exact exemplary and de
terrent punishment of the respon
sible authors and abettors of the
criminal acts whereby we and other
nations have suffered grievous in

It "knocked" some of the pride
out of The Mail last week when
the superintendent of census an
nounced the population of the dif
ferent towns of Idaho and Blackfoot
wasn't mentioned. It was only
incorporated towns that were looked
upon as worthy to be included, as
others have no established limits,
no city government, and are con
sidered only as a part of the popula
tion of the county to which they
belong. Little "incorporated" vil
lages with less than 200 people were
given prominence, but Blackfoot
with her 1200 souls, one of the
most important towns in the state,
was shut out because it had not
been incorporated. But. within
three months we may have a city
government of our own.— Mail.
OUGHT TO BE LIMITED.
There seems to be a determination
to pass the ship subsidy bill through
with the first legislation. We do
not believe the thing can be stopped,
but we believe the life of the bill
ought to be limited to ships built
in the next two years. And our
reason is that indications all point
to a new fuel for steamships which
will revolutionize the carrying
trade; an invention that will reduce
the cost of fuel perhaps 85 per cent.
The argument in favor of subsidies
has always been that American
ships could not, without subsidy,
compete with foreign steamers run
ning from countries where great
subsidies are paid their ships. But
the main cost has been the coal. If
that factor can be practically elitqi-"
minated and the ships made large
enough to carry great cargoes, we
believe American ships can run
and fair profits be made without
any subsidy. Indeed, if the inven
tion proves a success it will give to
one of the big greyhounds of the
sea a couple of thousand tons more
space for cargoes. — Salt Lake
