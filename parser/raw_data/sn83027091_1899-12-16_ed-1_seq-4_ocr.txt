IS KILLINU NEGROES A CRIME
The Colored American has no sym
pathy with polygamy and no toleration
for palygamists but the hysterical
clamor and mnch ado raised by the
Ile Of il onnntrv Oor ho oeatitiK or
Brigham H Roberts when crimes
equally aa heinous as tbat with which
he is chBrged are dismiseed with a
wink certainly tries our patience to
the limit Here is a man compelled to
step aside upon an allegation of eome
body that he has married more wives
than the law allows He is denied the
position to which te was fairly elected
and his sovereign state is today with
out repref cntation in the lower house
ofCongres3 Without going into the
details of the case we eubmit that a
dangerous precedent 13 established when
a duly ceitifltd legislator bearing
prima facie evidence cf hia title to
recognition is rotused admission on the
unproven statement of one or more
persona whose knowledge of the tacts
may be optn to question We think
Roberta credentials gave him the
right to be sworn in and that the
charges should have gone to the proper
committee just as is the rule in other
cases wnere a scat is contested In thus
shutting Robeits out without process
of law we are inclined to believe that
a mistake has been made wbich in he
future when majorities are slender
may return to plague those who are
partus to the present transaction
Roberts is an innocent man until his
guilt and unfitness are established by
authorities qualified to paes upon the
evidence Drought forward
The milk in tho cocoanut with ua is
this- If the virtue and dignity of Con
gress are so tenderly regarded why in
the name of common sense and de
cency is not the rod of chastisement
directed with like viTwr toward others
whose claims to membership are
tinged with blocd and whose alleged
election are the result cf theft forgery
and aseasslnation Why is no protest
raised no hue and cry sounded from
the firesides of the land when fiends
like Bellamy of JSorth Carolina whose
veil of victory rings discordantly with
the groans of Negro victims now lying
at the bottom of Caoe iJear itiveu wny
do not Uhe fair women of our land
circulate petitions to purge our Con
gressional halls of a man who exiled
hnndredsof families from Wilming
ton and caused mothers and babes to
perish from exposure and fright in the
forests of Hanover County If Roberts
Is objectionable from the violation of
one article of jhe moral code Bellamy
and his kind are inconceivably so as
enemies to every command in the
decalogue If the public weal demand
ed that Roberts be unhorsed tne good
name of the nation in no less a degree
demanded the exit of Bellamy and every
other member who comes from dis
tricts where ballot suppression in
timidation and murder deprive the
electors of their lawful privileges

West Virginia Favored by nature and
environment this rich and resourceful
commonwealth over against tbe blue
Allegbani a amid the hum of the
spindle the merry click of the miners
pick and the mutual roar of tbe coke
furnace has given to ihe world tbe
tbe subject of this tketch Phil
Watera known far and wide as the
B jy Orator of the K mawha He fiist 1
saw the light m lieesburg Va how
ever August 27 1873 and is the son
of Kev J W Waters a leading mem
ber of the Washington Annual Con
ference of tbe Methodist Episcopal
Church From boyhood Phil was
noted tor his marvellous powers of de
claiming in public He entered Mor
gan College Baltimore Mrt at the
age of eleven graduating m 191
During his stay there he won tbe prize
for the best English oration also tbe
declamatory medal lie then attended
Howard Univereity for a Diief period
being compelled to leave on account of
nickness
Having acquired a love for the study
of law and possessing tbe quality of
mind bent adapted to tbat intricate
branch of knowledge he matriculated
at the University of Michigan and
graduated in the class cf 95
Mr Waters is best known on account
of hia remarkable political career His
success in politics has been of the most
phenomenal and meteoric cbaracter
and while brilliant and and dtsbing in
execution every step lorward has been
gained and kept by the force of bard
and well diiected effort ceaseless activ
ity and a degree ot industry almost
beyond description He burned his
midnight oil and though by no
means an ascetic ihe frolic had no
charms for him when clean cut work
was to be performed upon which his
reputation as a man and scholar might
depend
Ho began his political career when
only fifteen years of age canvassing
the seventh Congressional district of
Virginia for John E Roller against
Ex Governor C T OForrall in 1888
speaking in every county in the dis
trict In 1892 before he had attained
his majority he was choeen as a dele
gate to the West Virginia State Repub
lican Convention and attracted wide
spread attention by bis speech nomi
nating Hon G W Atkinson for gov
ernor The same year be canvassed
the second Michigan congressional
district for Gem Spajldlng
Immediately after graduating from
the University of Michigan Mr Waters
settled in Charleston West Virginia
He was a delegate to all tbe conven
tions of 1896 and at the state conven
tion of that year again presented the
name of Mr Atkinson in a marvel
lously magnetic speech
The Cincinnati Enquiier eaid The
speech of the yonng olored orator
Phil Waters was the gem of the con
vention Ho was elected permanent
secretary of the stato convention tbat
selected delegates to tbe national con
vention at St Louis though there were
only six colored delegates out of a body
numbering nine hundred This was
the first instance where a cokred man
had ever been thus honored in the
state He took an active part In the
stirring campaign wbich followed and
was tendered the position of private
secretary by Congressman Dorr bat
declined In 1S97 he was elected li
brarian of the House of Delegates be
ing the first colored man to be named
for this distinction Aftei wards he was
appointed by Gov Atkinson aa corpor
alion clerk in the office of the Secretary
of State Not only was be the first
colored man to receive such an appoint
ment in the history tf West Virgins
but was the first republican clerk tbat
bad sat at a desk in tne Executive De
partment for a quarter of a century
Owing to tbe favorable corporation
laws of West Virginia Mr Waters
writes more charters for corporations
than any other similar clerk in tbe
United tiiates He has issued as high
as fony per day It is also said tbat
he U one of the most accurate aud
rapid pensmen in the state if not act
ually the very best Mr Waters was
one ot the delegates at large to the
National Republican League of Clubs
that met at Detroit in 1898 He Is close
to the powers in West Virginia and
being an ardent champion ot his race
has thus been able to be of valuable ser
vice in a number of trying emergencies
He enjoys the fullest confidence of all
the ttate officers from Gov Atkinson
down
Mr Waters is highly respected by
the classes aud tbe masaes wberever he
iB known and with bis little family
atauas lur all that is essential to tue
social and moral advancement of tbe
Afro American people He is in great
demand upon all public occasions re
ceptions etc His epeecb Introducing
the lamented Douglass to Charleston
citizens in 1892 and the farewell ad
dress delivered at the close of thercctut
reception teudered by West Virgmia to
Booker T Washington are regarded
as masterpieces ot forensic eloquence
Though praised upon all bands Mr
Water has too much mother wit to
allow his head to become swollen
Plain and unassuming he never con
eiders tbat he knows it all and it is
a source of perennial pleasure to seea
the inspiration oflered in his den
surrounded by one of tbe beet stocked
libraries in the entire commonwealth
or discussing with a mutual friend
some plan by which lhia mundane
sphere might be mado better brighter
and happier He If a mixer in the
truest seaseof the word and is popular
with all elements regardless of political
affiliations
When the historian of the twentieth
century comes to write of those wbo
have contributed generously to the
civilization of the times ana who have
added force to tbe wheel of progress

his most brilliant page the name and
