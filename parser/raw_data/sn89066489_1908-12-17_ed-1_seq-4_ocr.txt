TO STEAL A SEXAT0K.
Indications are that It let the de
liberate Intention of the Republican
lender to sieal a I" tilted States
Senator. It now looks like the high
handed and outrageous acts of that
party during the days of Count Rod
man, are to be repeated in Missouri.
This is their first opportunity in
nearly forty years, and it shows
clearly that the leopard has not
changed Its spots and that the sins
of the father Is handed down to the
sons for many generations. We
promise those gentlemen, that no
matter how smooth the deal Is en
gineered, the people will under
stand and It will be more than fifty
years before they again come into
power, If they dare to consummate
this premeditated fraud. The voter
of Missouri have elected a majority
of Democrats In the two houses of
&he legislature. For Republicans to
lect a United States Senator they
must by fraud corruptly overturn
ithe will of the majority of voters In
the state.
'Senator Stone has returned to Mis
souri from Washington, and In an
Interview in St. Louis is quoted as
saying:
"This filing of contests at the last
minute leads my friends to believe
that It Is for no good purpose. They
Are suspicious that some revolution
ary tactics are contemplated.
"Of course the Republicans have
the power, but 1 am determined that
it they adopt any unfair crethods In
unseating legally elected Democrats
be people of the State shall know
the tacts."
Of course the people shall know the
loci, and they will not be tooled by
Mr. Hadley's sophistries. The facts
1 . '. . .
remain that Seuator Stone has been
re-elected by a majority of the voters
and if he is cheated out of his elec
tion It will be by tho greatest fraud.
ADK01T GOVERNOR HADLEY.
Governor elect Herbert S. Iladley
announces with a flourish through
the newspapers, that he Is unalter
ably opposed and will bitterly com
bat any effort by the Republican
majority in thtf legislature to unseat
ing any Democrat on a technicality,
who is entitled to his seat. So far so
good, and sounds mighty fair and
honest in Governor Hadley. That
statement Is for the public. Now,
one can almost see the lid to the left
optic of the governor elect descend
i;ig as he quallfiesforlthe benefit of
his partisan workers, that where
Democrats cannot produce' tax re
ceipts they should be unseated. Mr.
Swanger, the present Secretary of
State, was elected Representative of
Sullivan county at a time when the
legislature was overwhelmingly Dem
ocratic. That questlon"was raised
as to his eligibility when on demand
he failed to produce a tax receipt
from that county, but that techni
cality was brushed aside, andjhe was
awarded his seat. A number of oth
er contests were smarted in the Senate
and always with the same result,
when that fact alone was the reason
for contest. But now a United States
Senator is at stake, and while every
semblance of fairness must be main
tained by Mr. Hadley, who was elect
ed on the reform plea, still he man
ages to find a ready loop hole for
himself while aiding his party schem
ers. Very adroit Mr Hadley.
Mr. Bryan killed a real bear In
Mexico and was arrested In Texas
for exceeding the limit In killing
dupks, and some papers are mean
enough to say that these are unfail
ing signs that he is a candidate In
1912. - -
PROMISING A SCRAP.
When that part of the President's
message, which provided for secret
service surveillance over the mem
bers of Congress, was read, there was
blood on the enr of every belligerent
member, and there are times when
they are all in that mood, And imme
diately there was a resolution pre
pared and introduced, expunging
that portion of the message and a
rebuke for the President for darelng
to reflect upon members of that an
gast body, and a committee was ap
pointed to deal with the subject.
But Teddy didn't scare worth a cent,
and it is reported that he immedi
ately set to work to collect and ar
range his data for a supplemental
message bearing upon that subject,
and some Intimations were dropped
from the White House, that the Pres
ident had the 'goods' on some" of the
members and would not be slow in
giving out the Information to the
public. The ardor of the committee
has evidently cooled considerably
and at a meeting on Monday It was
proposed by John Sharp Williams,
as the Democratic representative of
the committee, that the "President
be given the opportunity to produce
some specific Instances explaining
the objectlonal generalisation In his
message." The Republican mem
bers took this suggestion under con
sideration. If Teddy has something
np his sleeve, this wonld give him a
splendid opportunity to flash it on
Congress. Anyhow, the ardor of the
congressmen have cooled and will
still further cool before they force
such an issue with Roosevelt. Sick

The Neodesha, Kan., Sun In plac
ing the Verdigris river In nomination
as the crookedest stream ever, says:
"There Is a curve In this river to
sharp .that It a boy wants to go
around It on skates Je has to bend
the runners." The Rich Hill Review
rlps in defeuse of home pride and
remarks: "Pshaw, the Verdigris isn't
in it with the Marias Den Cygnes, for
It Is so crooked that every fish taken
from its waters has been found to be
a filleted with curvature of the spine."
Now these two editors are both can
dtdates for president of the ananlas
club.
The Vernon County Democratic
convention held in Nevada last Sat
urday, nominated the Hon. James
B. Johnson for representative by ac
clamation. Mr. Johnson Is a well
known jurist in Southwest Missouri,
an eloquent speaker and hlspopu
larlty and fitness for the office is
demonstrated by this vote of confi
dence by his party. He will unques
tionably carry his full party strength
and be elected by the old time Demo
cratic majority.
A group of five old settlers, promi
nent in the affairs of the county, In
cidentally congregated together op.
on the north side of the square last
Tuesday morning and engaging In
reminiscences. R. D. Henry, proprie
tor of the Henry Hotel, mentioned
the fact that he came to this county
In the year 1867, . Aaron Hart spoke
np with the Information that he had
arrived here the following year, '68.
Col I. M. Smith, County Recorder,
stated that 1869 was the date of his
settlement In the county, whereupon
It was discovered that W. E. Walton
and W. T. Cowan had settled here In
the years 1870 add 1871 respective
ly. That five gentlemen should Inci
dentally come together and discover
that they settled in a new country
consecutively each one year apart at
about the same time of the year, Is
remarkable, to say the least.
