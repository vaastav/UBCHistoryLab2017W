Hnglneer Comminslowemlilp.
Good authority at the White House to
day says that tho President lias not yet
settled the question of the permanent se
lection of an Engineer Commissioner for
the District.
This and the promulgation of a civil ser
vice ord. r are two things eagerly awaited
by the local public. The civil service or
der still hangs tire, because the President
has not had time to tinally revise it and
append his signature.

Owing to the great interest to be made In
the disposition of the government printing
office, it may be said that the order does
not afreet that Institution, so far as can be
learned. If the President exempts the print

special order. The opinion of the Attorney
General that the office Is not legally within
the classified service has been before
the President a long time. It has not been
made public, as the ('resident has tho only

WEBSTER ACQUTTEU.
Tlie Jury Kindt Him Not Guilty of
Mnmslanuhter.
The Jury In the case of William Webster,
on trial yesterday and today In Criminal
Court No. 2 for manslaughter, in connec
tion with the death last summer in Ana
costia of James Shoemaker, this afternoon
returned a verdict of not guilty. Webster
was thereupon released from custody.
When the trial was resumed this morning
the defense called Dr. A. C. Rauterberg as
a witness. The roost important feature of
Dr. Rauterberg's testimony was his opinion
that a blow on the left side of the body
would not be likely to cause a tear In en
Intestine on the right elde.
After brief arguments to the Jury by As
sistant District Attorney Shillington for
the prosecution and Mr. S. D. Trultt for
the defense. an<l a charge by Judge Brad
ley. the Jury retired. As stated, the twelve
men decided on acquittal.
The defendant Webster, late yesterday
afternoon took the stand In his own behalf.
His account of the incident of the 30th of
last May was. in substance, that he was oc
cupied in gathering lanterns and chairs at
the lawn party and carrying them into a
summer house. A number of boys were
playing there, shoving one another around
in chairs. He told them to leave and they
refused to obey. The Shoemaker boy was
sitting in a chair which the witness wished
to place on a pile. The boy declined to
move when told to give up the chair. Ac
cording to Webster, he placed his hands on
tho back of the chair and attempted to
raise it. at the same time putting his left
foot forward to prevent the boy from fall
ing. In this manner the defendant claims.
Shoemaker was accidentally hurt. He had
known the boy from infancy, he said, and
bore him no malice.

OUR MILITARY NEEDS
Deficiency Bill Taken Up by the
House.
_ /
APPROPRIATIONS FOR SIX MONTHS
The Senate Begins the Considera
tion of Pension Bills.
VICTORY FOR CANAL BILL
On motion of Chairman Cannon of the
| appropriations committee the House of
j Representatives went into committee of the
whole immediately after the reading of the
journal today. Speaker Reed vacated the
chair, which was assumed by Mr. Dalzell
of Pennsylvania, and the House proceeded
to the consideration of the urgent deficiency
bill for the support of the military and
naval establishments during the six months
beginning January 1,
Mr. Cannon said It was difficult, almost
impossible, to tell with ordinary certainty
how much money would be required during
the next six months, but this bill was
based on the best estimates.
Mr. I'nderwood (Ala.) interrogated Mr.
Cannon with a view to securing a state
' ment as to the disposition to be made of
the volunteer army.
Mr. Canrion said the treaty of peace had
j not been ratified. It might be ratified in
January, it might not be ratified for
months. No one could tell what was in
front of us. We must deal with a sltua- ,
lion. The volunteer army might be mus
tered out and its place taken by the regu
lar army. That was a matter for the fu
ture to decide, hut he felt confident that I
the treasury would be rich enough and
Congress wise enough to meet any emer
gency.
Mr. Snyers (Tex.), the ranking minority
member of the appropriations committee,
gave his unqualified indorsement to the bill
It did not affect in any way, he said, the
legislation regarding the volunteer and reg
ular armies. It simply made appropria
tions to support the present military anu
naval establishment. In answer to ques
tions he said the bill was based on the the
ory that the volunteers would continue in
the service until July 1, lSDO. If they were
mustered out the appropriations would be
covered back into the treasury.
Mr. Livingston (Ua.). in supporting the
bill, expressed the opinion that the law un
der which the volunteers were mustered
Into service was subject to double construc
tion (ls to the time when they should be
mustered out. That law said they should
be mustered out when the purpose for
which they were enlisted had been accom
plished, or when hostilities had ceased. He
ivelieved if the President was disposed to
keep the volunteers In the service until the
regular army had been reorganized this
bill appropriating money- for their payment
would strengthen his hands.
I iijust to Volunteers.
Mr. McRae (Ark.) said there was no pur
pose on his side of the House to oppose the
appropriations in the pending bill, but he
did not believe that it* passage should be
conj?trued as in any way Interpreting the
act creating the volunteer army. He gave
notice that at the proper time he would
otter an amendment declaring that nothing
in the pending bill should construe, extend
or modify section 4 of the act of April 22
creating the volunteer army. He said he
would not have pressed this amendment
had it not been for the President's declara
tion in his message that he would muster
out the volunteer army as soon as the reg
ular establishment was Increased. It whs
unjust to the volunteers to hold them In the
service when Congress had given a solemn
pledge that they should be mustered out as
soon as the war ended.
\\ hy should they now be held in service,
a hostage for the passage of an act to in
crease the regular army? Unless his
amendment carried the War Department,
aiready headed in that direction, would con
strue this bill as an extension of tho fourrh
section of the act of April 22. He believeo
it was the purpose of the President to hole,
the volunteers until a large standing army
v as provided.
Drnioi rnl. und Increase of the \rroj-.
"The army on h jieace footing numbers
but IW.OOO," Interposed Mr. Cannon. "Do
the gentleman and his side of the house
stand ready to support a bill to increase
that army to meet the necessities of the
government in Its present emergency and
those which confront it?"
"\N e will meet that question when it
arises." replied Air. McRae. "We are op
posed to u large standing army, and we are
opposed to holding the volunteers to per
form the duty of regulars and be vised as
a club to force us to create a large stand
ing army. Let reorganization of the army
cume in the regular way."
Mr. Cox (Tenn.) contended that under the
law the volunteers were entitled to their
dlsoharge the moment hostilities ceased.
He supported the McRae amendment, as
did Mr. Bland.
Mr. Hemenway said he could not under
stand how gentlemen could desire the mus
tering out of the volunteers until a stand
ing army was provided large enough to
properly govern our new possessions. Cer
tainly no one would contend that 26,One
men would be sufficient.
"Do you favor the retention of the vol
unteer array in the service until the reg
ular army is Increased?" asked Mr. Bland.
'If an increase of the regular army Is
deemed necessary," replied Mr. Hemen
way. "I do, I believe, if necessary, that
the volunteers should be held in service I
until their time of enlistment expires."
Mr. Dockery (Mo.), a member of the ap
propriations committee, differed from his
colleague, Mr. Livingston. He did not be
lieve the pending bill could possibly be con
strued to modify the volunteer act. If any
of its provisions did so a point of order
would lie against them.
Mr. Underwood (Ala.) asserted that the
volunteers who enlisted did so with the
understanding that they would be mustered
out as soon as hostilities ceased and since
hostilities had ceased there had been a
daily uverage of BOO applications for dis
charge
He was opposed to keeping men in the
field who volunteered for patriotic pur
pofes. He, as well as his colleagues, te
ceived letters every day urging their dis
charge. If an Increase in the regular army
was found to be necessary he stood ready
to vote for it. But an increase should r.ot
be forced thrcugh under the threat that
unless It was granted the- volunteers would
be kept In tho field.
Mr. Caniion'* View.
Mr. Cannon said the advocates of the Mc
Rae amendment sought to anticipate the
construction to be placed upon tha act of
April 22.
When challenged by Mr. Fleming (Ga.)
to give his own construction of that act
Mr. Cannon replied that aliunde and Inde
pendent of that act he thought the Presi
dent would place a wrong construction upon
It and be subject to the censure of subllc
opinion were he to muster out the volun
teer army if Congress should fall to provide
an army in excess of 28.000.
Mr. Fleming declared that the volunteers
had enlisted under tha promise that they
would be discharged when the war was
over. He could not understand why the
chairman of the appropriations committee
should oppose tho McRaa amendment
which simply provided that nothing in the
pending bill should construe or fhodify the
act of April 22.
Mr. Cannrm said he saw no good purpose
that would be subserved by Its incorpora
tion. It would simply give some gentle
men on the other side an opportunity to
flap their wings and proclaim with sound
and fury their friendship for the volun
teers. (I/aughter.)
SENATE!.
At tho opening of today's session of tha
Senate It was decided that the adjournment
today be until Monday next.
It was also determined to give one,hour
of today's session to the consideration of
pension bills.
In connection with the consideration of
bills on the pension calendar Mr. Vest
(Mo.) snld: "l do not want to be captious I
about this pension business, and do not want 1
to set myself up as a reformer, but this
thing of passing a lot of pension bills aim- .
ply by the reading of the titles and when a
quorum of the Senate is not present has got
to be stopped."
After fu?her referring to the methods by
which pe. jn bills are passed by the Sen
ate, Mr. Vest said: "Men of the south have
sat here and permitted these bills to be
passed, having sume delicacy about entering
ob>ectlon? to the course of procedure. Re
cent events have obliterated sectionalism,
and we are once more united and are one
country and one treasury. We can therefore
eonie here nnd object to this spoliation, and
I use the word advisedly, without fear of
ha\ing our motives impugned or our words
misconstrue^. W? are paying out in round
figures annually for pensions,
and it is o? dtitSjto And out why it is that
thirty-threg; yeafi after the close of the
cfril war tw tiiwit of pension claims shows
so enormoifc a aKi. I have been criticised
by some oi my ^?opte because I have not
taken a mJj.; determined stand on this pen
sion questlwi. *
"1 want,#twever. to pay munificently and
liberally In pensions. I regard such pay
ment as a sacred duty, but I do object to
the passage of these bills without proper
consideration and with the same restric
tions that are hedged about other meas
, "res."
Mr. Gallinger (N. HO. as chairman of the
pension committee, agreed with Mr. Vest
in his desire to have the pension bills care
fully considered. He thought a quorum of
the Senate ought to be in attendance when
the pension calendar was considered.
To Modify Clayton-Bnlwer Trenty.
During the consideration of bills on the
pension calendar Mr. Caffery (La.) intro
duced this resolution". "That it is the sense
if the Senate of the United States that the
President enter into negotiations with the
government of Great Britain for the purpose
of abrogating or modifying the Clayton
Bulwer treaty so farl&nd to the extent the
same may be deemed to prevent the United
states from owning, constructing, control
ing or operatipg aij interoceanic canal
.across the Isthmus of Darien."
The anti-scalping bill passed yesterday
by the House was received, and at the re
quest of Mr. Cullom, chairman of the com
mittee on interstate commerce, was laid on
the table Instead of being referred to the
committee. A similar bill has already been
reported by the Senate committee on Inter
state commerce.
A considerable number of pension bills
had been passed before th? senators, one
or two at a rime, began to leave the cham
ber. Finally, true to his warning, Mr. Vest
raised the point of no quorum. Forty-eight
senators responded to their nam>s, and con
sideration of the pension bills was resumed.
At the expiration of the one hour allotted
to the consideration of the pension calen
dar. twenty-six bills had bjen passed.
The Moses Estate Relieved.
A bill for the relief of the administrators
of William B. Moses, deceased, who was
on? of the sureties on the bond of Capt.
Howgate, a. disbursing officer of the United
States Marine Corps, whose defalcation in
1880 created a great sensation, was called
jp by Mr. Hoar. It had been favorably
reported by the judiciary committee. Thj
government's claim against the Moses es
.ate amounts to J13.470 and the bill relieves
he estate of the payment of that sum. in
vi;w of the fact that, through the efforts
of Moses, the government was enabled to
realtzo a considerable amount of its claim
against Howgnte. The bill whs passed.
The Senate at 1:50 p.m. went into exeou
? ive session.
A Treaty K at! fled.
The Senate, In executive session, rntitled
the treaty for the extension of the time for
the completion of the Mexican boundary
for one year. There wa? no opposition and
no debate.,,
At 2:15 U?e Senate resumed business In

race, Tierce having rushed hint, und at 7
o'clock Pierce was still getting away from
Miller and gaining on Waller, while the
latter slept. Pierce was only five miles and
a tenth behind Waller at 7 o'clock, and by
s o'clock Pierce was once more at the top
if the string. At that time ho appeared
fresh.
Albert, the long-distance walker, climbed
away up the list of riders at 4 o'clock, and
going up to second place shortly before 6
o'clock he left the track and lost some of
his advantage. He did wonderful work,
but the general opinion Is that Albert has
not strength to hold out with Pierce.
Several Falls DtirInK the Mifht.
Cistac left tho track at 3 a-m., but reap
peared a few minutes after 8 o'clock. There
were a number of falls during the night,
none resulting seriously.
Waller dozed- for a moment about 4
o'elock, awoke with a start, wobbled and
grabbed Frederick, who was riding at his
side. Both fell hi a heap, and their wheels
were broken.
"Teddy" Hale fell asleep and dropped
from his wheel. He lay for a moment and
then awoke with a start. Jumping up, he
rubbed his eyes and remounted his wheel.
As luck would havo it he was not in the
way of anybody while he lay on the track.
Stevens slipped and fell, and a number of
others had unimportant falls through the
night.
At 8 o'clock Pierce was tliirty-seven mi Us
behind the best record, made by Miller last
year.

THE STANDING ARMY
Opponents of Permanent Increase of
It Are Chiefly Democrats.
WHAT BER. WHEELER TODS DOING
He Can Remain in Both Congres
sional and Military Service.
ARGUMENTS PRO AND CON
The question as to the right of General
Wheeler to participate In the work of Con
gress while holding a commission in the
army Is only a side Issue In the organized
Rntagonism to the permanent increase of
the army. It is recognized that a bill of
some sort permanently Increasing the army
is to be put through Congress.
The opponents? chiefly democrats?to a
considerable standing army have in this
contest about to open the sympathy of anti
expansionists generally, though some of
these have not the fear of a standing army
which is entertained by most democrats.
The democrats will probably endeavor to
make a party question of the proposition,
and within that party most of those who
are. really expansionists retain their preju
dice against a large military establishment.
Whtrlfr nn a Champion.
In this connection if Is generally under
stood that General Wheeler appears in the
House at this session as a champion of the
army, in antagonism to the general senti
ment of his party. It is believed that his
desire to participate in the work of this
session is Inspired as much by a purpose to
assist in army legislation and to contend
against the prejudices of his party in that
regard as by any other consideration.
The routine matters relating to the in
terests of his district, it is said, any of
his colleagues would be ready to care for
in his name.
General Wheeler has resolved not to re
sign his commission within the House or
in the army. 'Sesterday early In the day he
contemplated resigning from the army, but
reserved his decision until he should have
a chance to consult with the President. It
is understood to have been after this con
sultation with the President that he came
to the decision that ho could legally retain
both places, and, as he states, Is based upon
the opinion of the Attorney General.
The Time for Action.
It is anticipated that as soon as the gen
eral offers to vote or to participate in any
way In the work of the House the question
will be raised, and there will be a rather
lively discussion. Aside from the fact of
his holding a different position with rt
Kpcct to military legislation from that of
most of his party, it is deemed to be a
matter of principle that a man sUDject to
an authority that at any time might de
mand his abf-ence from the House while
that body required his presence, thus in
volving a conflict, cannot retain a seat in
the legislative body.
The public significance of the contro
versy, however. Is In the fact of the oppo
sition to army influences and that u certain
element in Congress will contest every step
of the progress of legislation looking to the
organization of a large standing army and
to an extended military authority in any
territory of the United States.
Spirit of Autagonism.
This is evidently going to be the line of
the contest that is going to occupy much
attention during this session and in tile
succeeding Congress. The spirit of antag
onism was disclosed in the consideration of
the military deficiency bill in the House to
day. und a similar state exists in the mil
itary committees of both houses of Con
gress.
No doubt Is entertained that the military
?army and navy?deficiency bill will be
passed without further obstruction than
the consumption of time in debate, intend
ed not to affect the fate of that measure,
but in anticipation of the struggle to come
later on. Every question Is now being con
sidered with relation to its bearing on mat
ters to come up in the future, and in both
houses men are lining up for a most earn
est contention.

FINANCE AND TRADE
Higher Prices Marked the Early Trad
ing in Stocks Today.
CLOSE WAS SOMEWHAT IRREGULAK
American Sugar Took the Lead in
the Advance.
GENERAL MAKKKT REPORT
Special 1 Msj?tf'h to Tbe E* onlng star.
NEW YORK, December S.? An increa.se
in the volume of ccmmission buying and
evidence of an intention on the part of the
active interests to sice greater attention
to their specialties resulted in higher prices
in all parts of the list this morning. The
character of the business had improved
noticeably over night,' and recent sellers
were conspicuous among the early buyers
today.
An advance of 4 per cent in American
Sugar and the general strength of th>- in
dustrial department helpeJ the ?nt.re n-.ar
ket.
Several of the low-priced shares which
have been noticeable merely because of
rt( ent resistance came forward as prob
able leaders in the railway list. Atchison
preferred may be noted among the issues
which seemed to feel the influence of the
new interest lrom old sources. The pros
pect of early dividends and the certainty
that they are amply earned were again <m
phasized as the factors behind this move
ment.
The growing improvement in the position
of the adjustment bonds was also influen
tial in the upward movement. The stock,
however, failed to hold its early gain.
The announcement that Missouri Pacific
had paid off its entire floating debt was
followed by a moderate demand for that
stock. Recent returns from this property
have been somewhat above expectations,
and this payment of an objectionable obli
gation materially improves the prospects
of the stock.
The Pacific Issues are supported, but are
not attracting any considerable demand,
even though the 1 per cent dividend on
Northern Pacific is considered the begin
ning of a fixed regular disbursement. Any
pronounced disposition on the part of the
public to take an interest in these shares
would probably result in the hurried re
tirement of the stories relative to internal
friction.
The buying of American Sugar was the
feature of the day's trading, owing to the
liberal proportions of the demand and the
character of the interests supposed to be
represented. The trade war continues to
deereaso in significance since the independ
ent refineries and the American company
seem to be so thoroughly in harmony In the
matter of rates.
The concert of action in this particular
could scarcely have been more complete
ljid the American company issued instruc
tions to its rivals. During the afternoon
this stock was especially strong in the
presence of a reactionary tendency else
where.
American Tobacco. Federal Steel and
stocks of this character reflected the pres
ence of the larger interests, but there was
little effort to advance prices.
Metropolitan Traction was decidedly
strong and Is making steady progress
toward the new prices suggested by the
character of its management and Its new
dividend rate.
Brooklyn Rapid Transit was In good de
mand from time to time, the best buying
coming, as heretofore, from the so-called
Flower party. Moderate profit-taking was
in progress during the first trading, and
the marker took on the itvgular appearance
so noticeable at the beginning of the week.

crowded, a great many ladies occupying
seats, both within and without the bar.
The prisoner's mother set by his side and
feelingly grasped his arm. His aunt w?>,
likewise by his side.
After the conclusion of Mr Robsrt \V
Wells' address Sjnator Blackburn opened
by asking the court or opposing counci l
to correct him should he not conflu* hlnv lt
to the testimony In the case.
He then drcv.- a brilliant word picture of
Hladensburg and the part It played In the
war of 1SU:. From that he dwelt upon the
unfortunate circumstances in which the
young man was reared, and which were :ig
gravated by his enforced Idleness. TUn
cpeaker then dwelt upon the good char

of the history of the case, lu thts recital
he emphasized the fact that liarrou h?d

pose of attending a picnic that night, also
that the application made from the wit

previous to the quarrel over cards, which
quarrel occurred half an hour before the
shooting.
He then sifted Coch's testimony in regard
to the statement that Barron had a^ked
Coch for his (Barron's) pistol, shortly he
fire the shooting, and denied the probabil
ity of the truthfulness of Coch's statement.
He dilated at length upon the vituperative
language employed by Keyworth toward
Barron after the game of cards.
He continued upon the theory that Key
worth was not lu the bar when Rarron en
tered. but came out from a room in an Hg
gressive manner, and tnat Barron fired in
self-defense. He argxied tliat the state
must establish a case >?f constituting ever}
element of murder, beyond a reasonable
doubt, before the jury could consistently
bring in a verdict of guilty.
He also remarked upon the astute and
galling cross-examinstlon of Mr l'urkv r by
the prosecution, conducted by Mr. Rogers

timony of the witness t'och, and later paid
his respects to that of Stephens, who testi

practice adopted in this case of employing

cution and by renderiug an explanation of
his presence to the effect that the prisoner
was a friend of persons ciose to him and
by reciting the law as applicable to the
