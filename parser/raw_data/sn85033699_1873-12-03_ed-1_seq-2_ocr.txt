NASHVILLE UKTOK AND AMERICAN, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1873.

GOLif opened in Now York yester
day' at 208h advanced to 109, and
closed at opening rates.
Tennessee Bonds advanced slightly

being quoted at 73,, and the new at 73.

The protocol between Secretary Fish
and the Spanish Minister, as it comes
tons, is a hard piece of English. Our
telegraph editor has made the most of
it, but it is still as cloudy as the
weather.
The Telegraph reports a gratifying
increase in the business of Macon, Ga,
within a few days, and a revival in trade
prospects generally. The Republican
says the same maybe said of Savannah,
where business is more cumbrous and
less sensitive to the effect of outside in
fluence. Dr. Beke has sent to tho London
Times the following extract from a let
ter recently received by a mercantile
house from a resident at Borna, in
Western Africa. It is dated Aug. 12,
1873: "I am proceeding, to-day or
to-morrow, to Munuco, Upper Congo.
In a few days we expect there the Liv
ingstone expedition, which can not pro
ceed from St. Salvador. Livingstone
himself is a prisoner in a town twenty
days from here, but is entirely without
maans to pay his ranBom. Assistance
has, however, been sent to him, and he
may be here in a month or so." If Dr.
Livingstone should be ransomed, he
ought to be brought home, for it is
questionable whether his " researches "
will amount to very much.
IIOW THE GOVERNMENT BOIATEK
ED UP THE COOKES.
The Milwaukee Sentinel, the leading
Republican journal in "Wisconsin, 'in
enumerating the causes of the Bepub
1 lican defeat in that State, says the Jay
Cooke failure shook public confidence,
and caused a loud demand for reform
at "Washington. It appears from de
velopments which are not disputed, that
the government was in the habit of
bolstering the Cookes in the most un
warrantable ways. The Secretary of
the Treasury allowed Cooke's bank in
"Washington the use of large sums of
money without security. Deposits of
government money in other banks
throughout the country were secured
according to law, but the Cookes were
made an exception. How could the
government lose two hundred thousand
dollars by the failure of the First Na
tional Bank of "Washington, if the
law had been complied with? And
the sum lost might have been much
larger had the suspension of the bank
occurred at an earlier date. A cor
respondent of the New York Sun makes
a statement on the authority of the
Hon. John Lynch, of Maine, who was a
member of the House Committee on
Banking and Currency, that there was
atone time a government deposit of
$7,600,000 in this same First National
Bank. This was discovered during' the
investigation last winter of the causes
which led to the failure of the Mer
chants' National Bank, of "Washington.
It is also stated that the First National
was at that time engaged in an effort to
bolster up the tottering Merchants' at
the government expense. "Whether or
nofcthe deposit of 87,600,000 was fully
secured it is impossible to say. The
law requires that the Secretary of
tho Treasury shall demand from all
United States depositories ample se
curity "in United States bonds and
otherwise." The United States bonds
must be put up aa security. If the
law was violated in the case of the
3200,000 deposit, it may also have been
violated -when there was a deposit of
S7,600,000; and, if the crisis had come
then, the Government would have been
compelled to stand the larger loss.
This case demands investigation, and
it should not be delayed. The country
should know whether the Secretary of
the Treasury has been in the habit of
depositing money in Cooke's banks
without the security demanded by the
law. If the Secretary is guilty of this
unlawful proceeding, let the fact be
made known, and let him be punished
as he deserves. If he were a Democrat,
the country would not be long in learn
ing the exact state of the case, for
there are Congressmen who would
hardly have waited for an organiza
tion to proceed in the matter of inves
tigating so serious a charge. The fact
that the Secretary is a Republican
should not be allowed to screen him.
AN AXAUAMA SENATOR.
The subjoined confession, published
inthe.Mbn70ieri Advertiser, shows the
kind of stuff of which Radical Senators
are often made in the Southern States:
C. "W. Hatch is the Senator from Hale
county elected by the negroes over the
regular Republican nominee and a
Democrat and to whose admission to
his seat in the Senate when the Legis
lature met a few days ago, unavailing
opposition was made. This confession
is fully sustained by official letters fully
confirmingandrepeating it.ptisdueto
Senator Harris, of Russell, to say thathe,
though a Republican, raised the objec
tion to Hatch and called for an investi
gation before seating him; but the ma
jority of his party were against him
and they voted Hatch in. Here is
Hatch's confession:
Mobile, Ala., Jan. 4, 1871. I,
Charles "W. Hatch, Postmaster at
Greensboro', Hale county, Alabama, do
confess that I have taken from the
mails the following amount of money
order funds, while in transmisaionfrom
the following postoffices to the deposit
ing office at Atlanta, Ga.: February
19 1870, from Greensboro', Ala., 8419;
May 27, 1870, from Greensboro', Ala.,
June 22, from Greensboro', Ala.,
S12: June 25, 1870, from Greensboro',
Ala 8105- June 30, 1870, from Tusca
W Al 8500; July 6, 1870, from
llx.W Total, $1,759.
I feel that under the existing circum
stances it is my duty to myself and
faSly to sign this. The above has
been done by my ovn free will

THE' PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
In his first paragraph Gen. Grant
throws out a bait for. the "Liberals'
stating that "political partisanship has
almost ceased to exist, especially in the
agricultural regions," which is a neat
way of glossing over the recent rebuffs
of Radicalism. The offset of two mil
lions of British claims against the fif
teen millions we received, with the pros
pect of more such offsets not only from
Great Britain but from other nations,
"will be sad news for the tax payer who
learns it first from this message. The
condition of the Texan border is slur
red over with characteristic disregard
of all Southern interests. San Domin
go comes again to the surface in a
short but suggestive paragraph, -while
the right of expatriation is pretty well
established.
The reference to our Spanish troubles
is rather brief and unsatisfactory,
though its assertions of Spanish con
cessions are positive far more so than
the protocol accompanying. Half the
space occupied is devoted to a doubt
ful diagnosis of the Cuban situation
per se, entirely out of place in a domes
tic State paper. Through the officious
Sickles we have been giving the Span
iards too much of this advice unasked,
and hence the reaction of their self
conceit -which has incited them to pre
cipitate present complications.
The President devotes large space to
finances and thepanic. The real causes
of our commercial constipation are in
geniously hidden in a cloud of com
monplace truths, which Grant or his
party have never attempted to reduce
to practice. Some of the suggestions,
which he fails to endorse, will
arrest attention, while others
will excite ridicule for instance,
his fear that convertible bonds would
make the government pay out more in
terest in summer than in winter. Jay
Cooke called the national debt a nation
al blessing, and the President speaks
of thepanic as "a blessing in disguise."
But it is so thoroughly disguised that
he does well to contradict this view by
urging Congress to prevent if possible
the recurrence of such blessings.
There is brave talk of economy and
an important but impossible step sug
gested in civil service reform. "With
this we have a wholesale whitewashing
of the corrupt rings which haveswamp
ed the fortunes of the District of Co
lumbia, as well as the suggestion of
residences for Cabinet officers at gov
ernment expense, palaces for the Sena
tors, etc. Brave talk of economy. It
will not reach further than the Nash
ville Customhouse.
The suggestion of a riparian canal,
running along the whole Atlantic and
Gulf Coast, to protect our timid ship
ping, fails to appear in this message.
In its place looms up a big ditch from
the Rocky Mountains to the Missouri
river, designed to encourage migration
to a barren desert, while millions on
millions of arable land remain unoccu
pied in the older States, and Iowa far
mers complain of being too far from
market. Surely the Northern Pacific
has given our people a dose
of this forcing business in the
matter of premature settlements.
The President urges the scheme of
postal savings depositories, but con
tents himself with a bare reference to
the telegraph project.
The amendment to the constitution
which he suggests, in reference to leg
islation during the last twenty-four
hours of Congress, will meet with gen
eral endorsement, and is the best point
in this very verbose message.
SOME INSTRUCTIVE FACTS.
In all cases where the contest be
tween the Democratic and the Repub
lican parties in New York at the late
election was a square one, the latter
was beaten. To show this a compari
son is made by the New York World be
tween the votes which Mr. Nichols,
Democratic candidate for Comptroller1,
and Mr. Fort, Republican candidate
for State Treasurer, received. These
two are taken as the fairest basis of
comparison, because neither was en
dorsed by the Liberals. Their votes
therefore gaveafair Ideaof the strength
of each party. A comparison of the
vote shows the following result:
Vote for Nichols, Democrat 333,802
Vote for Fort.Repiiblican 329,235
Nichols in excess of Fort 4,507
Thus it will be seen that on a leading
candidate in each party, neither of
whom had the indorsement or support
of the Liberals, the Democrats poll 4,
567 more votes than the Republicans.
The case of Sweet against Taylor for
the office of State Engineer was a much
stronger one, and had the Liberal vote
been given to the latter, as it was not,
it would have failed to save him. The
Btrengthof the Liberals, or rather of
those who cling to that organization, is
shown by a comparison of the vote for
Mr. "Willers and Mr. Nichols on the
Democratic side, and Mr. Hopkins and
Mr. Thayer on the Republican side:
Willers, Democrat, indorsed by the
Liberals, received 341,090
Nichols, Democrat, who was not so
indorsed, received u.w,oi
The Liberal vote for 3!r. "Willers. . 7,294
Hopkins, Republican, indorsed by
theLibetals, received ,337,975
Thayer, Republican, wlio was not
indorsed by the iioerais, re
ceived 330,475
Liberal vote for Mr. Hopkins 7,500
Thus the managers of the Liberal par
ty have been able to control a few more
than 7,000 votes. The former Liberal
vote was not all cast for the Liberal
ticket; thousands of those who cut
looe from the Administration Repub
lican party last year have cast their
vote with the Democratic party and
voted the entire ticket, and will hence
forth act and work with the Democrats,
with an earnestness and conviction that
indicated perfect satisfaction and trust
in the party and cause of reform to
which they hud attached thomselyes.
The official returns of the Wis
consin ejection completely nega
tives the pretense set up by
the Administration organs that the re,
Bult in that State was brought about
by the Republicans staying away from
the polls. They show," affirmatively and
positively, that it was a victory for the
reform party gained bolely by the posi
tive strength of that party in the State.
A comparison of the State election of
1873 with that of 1871 both what the
in
politics exhibits the tollowing facts:
" 1871. ' 1873.
"Washburn 78,301 1 Taylor 81,035
DooHttle 08,910 Washburn.. 00,254
Total 147,211 Total 147,859
This comparison of the votes for gov.
emor shows an increase of the whole
.number of votes cast in 1873 over 1871
of G18 votes. The Chica go Times says
"The increase is wholly on the side
of the reformers; on that of the admin'
lRtratin-niHtB. the returns show a COD
spicuous loss of positive as well as of
relative popular strengtn. xn ion
Wfwhbnrn received 78.301 votes; in
1873, this pretended 'farmers' friend:
and 'best Governor "Wisconsin ever
had,' received only 66,224 votes, and
fbft vnfcpn rnvfiii to the other adminis-
trationist candidates show this to be
within 2,000 of the utmost strength of
me attminiB irauoiuH t pnrujr m jdwu.-
sin. In 1871, Doolittle, as tne uemo
era tic' candidate, received 68,910 votes
in 1873, and in the first electoral con
test of the new reform organization
the reform candidate for Governor re
oeWaa SI fiSS vnfpH n. maioritv of 15.'
411 over his administrationist oppo
nent, and mcluding a positive acces
sion to the popular strength of the op
nnn turn nf 12.725 votes; An examuia
ttrm nf fliA official tables further shows
that in only eleven counties was the
number of votes riven for "Washburn
in 7a fhnn thi number he receiv
ed in the same counties in 1871, while
in forty-seven counties, the administra
tionist candidate received more votes
than he received in the same counties
in 1871. On the other hand, in forty
fivfl counties the reformers cast more
votes in 1873 than the 'Democrats' cast
in the same counties in 1871, and in
thirteen counties cast fewer votes in
1873 Tinn in 1871. Everv wav. and by
every comparison that can be made,
the evidence is clear and unavoidable,
showing not merelv a relative victory.
but a positive victory, won by positive
superiority of numbers."
The Boston Eerald hits the nail on
the head when it says: Had Horace
Greeley been elected President, and the
panic had come, how every anti-Greeley
oracle in the land would have cried
aloud, "I told you so." In fact,
they did demonstrate in advance that
the election of Greeley would shake the
whole fabric of the public credit and
plunge the country into bankruptcy and
ruin. It is a singular fact that all the
evils they predicted under Greeley have
come under Grant, and it seems to in
dicate that the organs are cross-eyed.
At a meeting held in New York at
an early day of the late financial
troubles, Judge Pierrepont, one of the
staunchest supporters of the Grant ad'
ministration, said:
"Our troubles come of a vicious
system of finance, which has atiniulat
ed foreign imports, led to luxury and
extravagance m every walk of life,
Truth now asserts her sway, and sham
crumbles into dust; and the day of
reckoning has come, and the insane rev
elry must bo paid for."
Our "vicious system of finance'' is of
Republican parentage, and has been
hitherto lauded to the skies by Repub
lican orators. What have Judge Pierre
pont's Republican brethren in Con
gress to say now.
THE CURREXCT QUESTION.
Washington, Nov. 30. Thero is an un
mistakable feeling in favor of some en
largement ol the currency, mose wno
have canvassed most carefully claim that
free banking and an incontrovertible bond
will in the House have from thirty to fifty
maioritv. Plans are numerous, but a ma
jority turn on this pivot, though the mode
is made to serve either tneory. -Uie na
tional bankins interests are also aroused,
and the conservative influences of the com
mercial centers is being visibly rallied
There seems little doubt that, outside of
Boston. New England will be largely in
favor of an increase. 3Ir. Sumnerwillfavor

free banking, making the banks redeem in
greenbacks, the government to redeem these
in gold or bonds, me west ana oouin

"OCEAN PERIES."
Underfills heading, the Cincinnati Times
publishes this fine bit of word-painting:
There is something inexpressimy sau ami
dreadful about the idea of a wreck far out
at sea. All the elements ot the sublime,
the mysterious, and the awful are united in
the destruction of a ship upon the ocean by
collision, fire, or storm; or, more terrible
yet, wrecked upon the breakers, gored and
ground to pieces by the cruel rocks, rent
and torn hv tlie screaming hurricane, and
sucked down by thefoaming.swirlingwhirl-
pools. And how awful is the cloud ot
mystery that surrounds the fate of those
ships that sailed away to sea and never re
turned! From the lofty deck, as the
snowy sails were shaken out and
caught the bracing morning breeze, depart
ing Joyed ones waved us a fond f arewell,
and the last flutter of a handkerchief is
seen tlirough tears that bjur and dim the
vision. Then come the montlis of waiting;
at first, calmly, hopefully; then with a vague
uneasiness which is more than lialf pre
sentiment; then with open anxiety, dread
uncertainty, and at last fixed despair. What
a grim and horrible pathos is in all tliat!
What imaginings haunt them who saw those
who were held dear go out from shore in
that ill-fated ship that was never heard of
again! What dreadiul pictures will the
horrified imagination draw of the scene
when that gallant ship went down in mid
ocean! A sky as black as in, save when
vivid tongues of flame dart thrpugh the
sable pall. Clouds and sea are com
mingled in hideous uproar; the mad
dened ocean bojjs and roars and
tosses its foaming crests to the sky. Amid
this war of winds and waves, in the thick
darkness, in the ghastly glare of tho light
ning, the (loomed ship is straggling like a
living thing for life, now forced to the sum
mit of a mountainous wave, caught by the
shrieking, howling winds, whirled about,
torn, butletted, then dragged down by the
waters again, as though they envied the
winds their chance to torture her, into the
black depths of the trough, crushed, pound
ed, whelmed, until she straggles up again,
like a poor wounded thing, ainqng the bay
ing, snarling hounds? Soon tlie unequal
conflict is over, 3ir)g)ed with the roar of
the elements, sounds the slfrilj, terrible cry
that only a hunian oul sends forth when
it looks at last into the very face of death;
and the winds and water? are howling in
triumph over the grave of thoir victim.

PRETTY AND UOIiY WOMEN.
No woman can say truthfully that
she does not care whether she is pretty
or not. Every woman does care. The
immutable laws of her being have made
physical attractiveness as much
natural glory to her as strength is to a
man.
T I T i 11 il i 1 -w
iiere i may oe tola that what l am
saying is superfluous, for perfect beauty
has no need of art to enhance it, and
that those who have been born with
hard, or worse, with perfectly uninter
esting features, do not want to be told
that physical attractiveness isindispen
sable to them. But it is especially to
the plain, and to the generally ill-
favored that I address these words of
advioe and warning, and should Beau
ty's self find a few usef id hints, I see
no reason why she should not avail her
sett ot them, i know that there are
people who look well anywhere and
anyhow no vulgarity, no carelessness
of speech, dress or attitude seems able
to oisencnann mem. nuz tnese rareiy
gifted persons are but the exceptions
that prove the rule, and even in their
case what Sir Philip Sidney spake is
true ne says mere is in mat weu-cnos
en surroundings
"Which does even beauty beautify,
And most bewitched the captiveu eye;"
and Herrick, too, in his "Poetry of
Dress," seems to have had an astute
appreciation of how beauty may be
beautified. These men lived in the six
teenth century a time when color m
dress was an understood and valued ad
junct, and before we had learned to
make our dwellings intolerable to the
eye. -
An immense number of ill-tempered,
ugly women are ill-tempered because
they are ugly. They do not know it;
their friends don't understand, and
make no allowance; but heavy, indeed,
is the burden upon these poor women,
and pernicious m its effect upon their
moral character very often. 1 have
heard it said that ugly women are
always bad tempored. This is an over
statement; but there is a certain degree
of truth in the saying, cruel as it is
An ugly child cares nothing for its ug
liness; but when it grows older, and
perceives that it lacks something which
is prized and honored, and is twitted
with the deficiency, and neglected
through it, and is reminded of it
every time it looks in the glass or
in another face, the constant disap
pointment begins very early to embit
ter the whole nature, and creates a mel
ancholly shyness. And when the de
sire to attract awakes with years, and
the young girl finds her fairer friends
preferred before her, the vain endeav
ors to please by other means dishearten
her, and she grows sarcastic, ill-natured,
envious of everybody, though half un
consciously; many other faults follow,
ana she becomes unnappy ana morose.
No one ever knows what she suffers;
but she does suffer very acutely.
I am certain that however laudable
the efforts of ugliness to attract by
learning, by accomplishments, by gen
era! usefulness, or by satire, nothing
really compensates for the want of per
sonal beauty. The best that an ugly
woman can do is to make you forget
that sue is ugly ior tue time Demg;
she cannot compensate. And while I
should adyise all women to become as
intelligent and clever as they can
whether they be plain or pretty, still I
wish mere beauty were made more an
acknowledged and honorable art than
it is by all those to whom God has given
eyes and an intelligent brain. It is not
sin nor a folly to long, as every
woman longs, to be lovely. She is so
constituted, and her beauty "is a glory
to her."

lished a dry nursery for the care and feed
