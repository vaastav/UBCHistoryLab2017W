The proceedings of the Senate are aa atroagly
flavored with the interna*! tad ?l?m. Tbnt
body, being already orir>?nix<vl. waa at one*
prepared for buiiineaa, and batioeaa waa imaaa
diately commenced by Messrs. Wil?oa, Samanr
and Wade, in a perfect avalanche of radical bill*
and resolutions levelled al the lata reltelliaaa
States. Tba schedule presented by Seaator ^nai
nor ia of itaalf abaolulaly astounding. Ii eoai
prebends "a bill to carry out tbe principle* of a
republican form of government in tke District
of Columbia (a regular overhauling, no doubt,
of tbe District laws making diaeritninatioa* be
tween whites and hlacka ; a bill prrscriliiag an
oith to maintain a republican fona of govern
ment in the rebel Stales; a bill la put in etr.
cntion the guarantee of a republican form of
government in the constitution of the t!ait?d
States (thia ta, perhsps, a sort of territorial
bill for the South); a bill to enforce tbe
amendment of the constitutional prnkiMtioa of
slavery; a series of resolution* declaratory nf tbe
duty of Congress to loyal ci twits (fieedmen)
in the rebel Slates, and a aeries of r?- oilntions
touching the duty of Congreas with respect ta
guarantees of national aecurily and national
faith in the rebel Slates." Tkto bill probably
involves a little Hcaxoninff of confiscation.
This is Mr. Sumner's schedule for tbe opening
day of the Sennte, and we think It eaoagb for
one day. His colleague, Mr. Wilaon, with bis bill
to secure the freedom of the inhsbitaata of tbe
States declared in rebellion; and Mr. Wade, of
Ohio, with his bill to regulate tbe elective Iran
chise in tbe District of Columbia, followed in
the same direction. Tbe question roettra, M If
we have such things In (be gr?*en tree what
shall we have in the dry*" Tbeae proceedings
In both bouses clearly indicate an ultra radial
and revolutionary system of Soutbera reeoa
struction aa tbe policy reaolved upon by tba
radical leaders of the repnblicaa majority of
this Congress. However improbable aad
visionary we may bave beea inclined hereto
fore to consider the remoraeleaa propuaiiiooe
for Southern reconstruction of aucb fanatical
leaders as Stevens of the House and Samner ol
the Senate, we are now brought laoe ta bee
with the danger of their enloroemeal.
The opening proceedings of the two bowsoa
of Ibis Congress foreshadow Um practical re
duction oftho excluded Southern Staten to the
status ol Territories conquered from a foreign
enemy and slill in a state of revolt. (Toercioa!
There is nothing here but coercion.* Tbe radi
cal leaders of this Congress seem to be no raged
at the conciliatory experiments of restoration
adopted by President Johnson, and which, in
preparing the minds of the Southern people for
the great change which baa come upon them,
have been aUendad with such wonderful suc
cess. His patient aad patriotic tsbiri ia view
of tbe earliest possible restoration of tbe South
to law and order, industry, prosperity and po
litical harmony with tbe North, excite, appa
rently, bo consideration aasoag tba majority in
eitber house of Congress.
Tbe Prsaidsat's mesaage, whish. it is si
peeted. will be read before both bonaaa to-day.
may resnlt in some manifestations of a better
spirit. His ststcment of tbe views and pur
poses by which be has been guided In his
policy of Southern restoration may perhapa
have the good effect of checking tbe radical
leaders in tbeir mad career. As it stands, tbe
first day's record of the Tbirty-nintb Congress
foreshadows not only a merciless rule of des
potism in the reconstruction of tbe excluded
Southern States, bnt tbe first chapter in a radi
cal reconstruction of tbe government of tbe
United States itself, or a quick and decisive
popular reaction against tbe party in power.
If the republicans have now tbe strength of a
giant, let them remember that it is not always
wise to use it aa a giant. They can sfford to be
magnanimous, while tbe helpless Southern
States, disarmed and impoverished, cannot
afford to be lntmctnble.

the faces of tbe four csndidates tor Mayor of this

are worthy the glance of a voter. In the face of
the present Mayor it is easy enough to see just
what we have found? a man of small, thrifty
cunning, boundless conceit and nsrrow views.
Hooker's face is th? perfect type of tbe tin
man? Isrge snd bold, with plenty of good in
tentions and an eye to bustneos - the head of a
burly brewer, butcher or baker. Hoffman's
face shows infinitely mora of trained intellect ?
an intellect that porcsivs* and weighs with tho

?election of capable men. It doee aat ssetter
how or by whom men come in. Wbat they da
when elected is the importaat point. Good
municipal government la not nseseaartly de
pendent upon party. II would undoubtedly
be better for the general lntereet if the muni
cipal agents were never rhoeen eiclueirely
from a single party.
The Tammany Hall tlchet ie made up of men
of a single party, and of one foction of that
' Their csmaaiga Is one of iateraeoia* war, yid. '
If successful, the groat interests of the city, the
woalth of its merchant princes, and the heavy
taxes of its people will be squandered to re
ward favoriU s and punish opponents. We have
tried that on. The Gunther faction refused to
illuminate the city in honor of the national
victories, and cheers in its meetings the rebel
General-in-Chief. The Ilecker party is a reform
party without chance of election or the possi
bility of improving our government, if elected.
It is useless to experiment with these parties
again. The Union party gives us the only
chance for something new. Though there is
mnch that is unacceptable to many people in
the State and national policy of this organisa
tion, it has carried us through the war, and may
give us a good municipal government. Mr.
Roberts, tho candidate for Mayor, is a mer
chant, a man of liberal views, benevolent and
patriotio spirit, acoustomed to the management
of men and the direction of great enterprises.
It has been said of blm that he does
not know how many (/ouncilmen there
are, and has never handled the wires of the
City Hall. That is greatly in his favor, and
ought to improve his chances. If he does not
bow the nnmber of votes In the Common
Council he knowa nothing of tho value of each,
nex how. mueh it costs to engineer a corrupt
scheme to a successful conclusion. So far so
good. When an ancient governor was taunted
in a similar manner by a like competition he
calmly replied that it was true he did not know
how to play the fiddle, but he knew what was
better ? how to make a small city a great em
pire. That is the skill we require. Mr. Roberts
may have it. He bas given the best evidence
of his ability to establish commercial connec
tions between New York and the most wealthy,
prosperous and populous portions of the globe,
and ho may help to make our city unparalleled
in Its advantages? if not a grand ompire, at
least the first city of the globe. We want
nothing but a succession of sensible and sound
municipal governments to accomplish this great
ond. Lot us, then, try it on.
O'Gorman, as candidate for Corporation
Counsol, may bo the right man for that placc.
Let us try it on. These two officos are tho
right arm and the brains of the government.
Filled with competent and patriotic mon, thoy
will givo what wc want ? wise counsel and
vigorous administration. O'Roberts and O'Gor
man are the only men offered that show a chance
of election, or probability, if elected, of satis
fying the junt expectations of our misgoverned
people. Lot us try thom, und if they fail us

during the performanoe of Chriatsaae paala

ment is a candid expression of thaoptaloa of the
audience that the play and the players amount
to nothing, ?nd that those wbp maaufketurs the
scenery deserve all the oredit In opera, how
ever, a call for the stage carpenter- very rarely
occurs, because the aedieeee find, easagh
to praise in the music and the staging. ' We eee
that the case is very different in The AJHoaa,
as presented by Oily Gammon and his troupe.
In the first place, the opera is sadly out ; thea
the artists substitute their own music for that
of Meyerbeer ; the libretto is so very absurd
that the World threatens a dead author with
"an invoice of straight jackets" if he ever writss
another one like it ; the leading people bowl
stentorianly ; the chorus sings in G sharp while
the orchestra is playing in C ; the tenors shout
with a lustiness not demanded by the com
poser ; the brass trumpets completely over
power the stringed instruments ; the conductor
strives in vain to allay this rashness, and Oily
Gammon, with a glass of lager beer in bis hand,
thinks that it is all vory fine, nnd wonders why
the ladies and gentlemen of the audience gel
up and go out Under these clrcumstanoea
who is there to applaud oxcept the stage oar?
penter, unless the boys in the gallery choose to
stamp for Oily Gammon himself, and, with aa
eye to fun and broken English, demand
"speech t" "spcoch !" in tones as lusty as those
of tl.e chorus. The World says that "the Man
caniUa tree occupies the greater portion of the
stage and it might have added that the tree
and the ship constitute the greater portion of
the opera. But why should lovers of music go
to see an imitation tree and a painted ship
upon a painted ocean ? The Stuyveaant pear
tree is a much greater curiosity than the Man
oanilla tree in the opera, and real ships may
be observed, at the expense of a few cents, by
a trip over one of thq ferries or a visit to the
docks. Our musical public used to go to the
opera to bear good music and good singing;
but now, in default of these, Oiiy Gammon
offers them a tree and a ship, and they are com
pelled to applaud, not fine artists, but excellent
mechanics ? not great actiug, but nice triage
carpentry. Alas, for the opera in this metrop
olis! Alas, for the musical status of New
Tork !
