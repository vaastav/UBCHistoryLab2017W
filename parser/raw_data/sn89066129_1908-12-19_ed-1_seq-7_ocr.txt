INVALID'S GAD PLIGHT.
After Inflammatory Rheumatism, Hair
Came Out, Skin Peeled, and Bed
Sores Developed Only Cutl
cura Proved Successful.
"About four years ago I had a very
severe attack of inflammatory rheuma
tism. My skin peeled, and the high
fever played havoc with my hair,
which came out in bunches. I also
had three large bed sores on my back.
I did not gain very rapidly, and my
appetite was very poor. I tried many
'sure cures' but they were, of little
help, and until I tried Cuticura Re
solvent I had had no real relief. Then
my complexion cleared and soon I felt
better. The bed sores went very soon
after a few applications of Cuticura
Ointment, and when I used Cuti
cura Soap and Ointment for my hair
it began to regain its former glossy ap
pearance. Mrs. Lavlna J. Henderson,

Bessie's Task.
"Mamma," said little Bessie, at table
one noon, "I'm to write something to
read at school next Friday, but I've
forgotten what the teacher called it."
"An essay, perhaps,' suggested Bes
sie's father.
"An oration," offered the little
maid's high-school brother, teasingly.
"A valedictory," prompted a senior
sister.
"No," said Bessie, suddenly bright
ening. "I remember now what it is
it's an imposition."
Starch, like everything else, is b&
tag constantly improved, the patent
Starches put on the market 25 years
ago are very different and inferior to
those of the present day. In the lat

jurious chemicals are omitted, while
the addition of another Ingredient, in
vented by us, gives to the Starch a
strength and smoothness never ap
proached by other brands.

Why Joyner Left Home.
"Are you ready to receive the obli

preme hocus-pocus of the Order of
Hoot Owls.
"I am," said the candidate, firmly.

Laundry work at home would b
much more satisfactory if the right
Starch were used. In order to get the
desired stiffness, it is usually neces
sary to ussj so much starch that tho
beauty and fineness of the fabric is
hidden behind a paste of varying
thickness, which not only destroys the
appearance, but also affects the wear
ing quality of the goods. This trou
ble can be entirely overcome by using
Defiance Starch, as it can be applied
much more thinly because of its great
er strength than other makes.
The Color Line Again.
That the criterion of beauty is very
dissimilar among different races is not
often more strikingly exemplified than
in the following anecdote of a Vir
ginia negro. At his request the "young
master's" baby son had been fetched
out for Tim's inspection. He looked
earnestly for some moments, then elec
trified the bystanders with this un
qualified praise: "Marse Garrett, dat's
de pretties' white chile I ever seed!"

It is now possible to secure a homestead of 160
acres free and another 1 60 acres at $3.00 per acre.
Hundreds have paid the cost of their farms (if
purchased) and then had a balance of from $10.00
to $ 1 2.00 per acre from one crop. Wheat, barley,
oats, flax all do well. Mixed farming is a great
success and dairying is highly profitable. Excel
lent climate, splendid schools and churches, tail
ways bring most every district within easy reach
of market. Railway and land companies have
lands for sale at low prices and on easy terms.
