HOW TO TREAT IMMIGRATION
No Nonsense Wanted Over John
Fcv More Foreigners Wanted
Anyway
WASHINGTON December lOThe Pacific
Coast delegation in Congress came to Wash
ington with if possiblemore positive anti
Chinese views than ever They claim that
the legislation which was designed to put a
top to Chinese immigration has not proved
effectual and they insist on more stringent
measures The statement is made that
eighteen thousand Chinese have entered the
country during the year of which number
at least four thousand entered fraudulently
Congress will be asked to pass legislation
that shall hereafter peremtorly shut out
these people from our borders It will be
I necessary to look into this question of immi
gration frankly and in full and deal with it
soberly and wisely It is not unlikely that
the time is near at hand when the country i
will find it desirable to change its historic J
policy of hospitality Many people have the
idea that it is the part of duty and our mis
sion to offer an asylum to the poor and op
pressed of other nations but we are under
no obligation either political or moral to
assume such a charitable office for distressed
mankind In the past we have welcomed
the stranger not wholly from benevolence
but in part at least because we could advantageously
vantageouSly sot him to work We felt that
we had a large contract on our hands in the
shape of a continent to subdue and were
glad of stout arms and hearts from abroad
Bat times change and we change with them
On every side the cry now goes up that a
crowded population isf making competition a
I farce and the chances of snccess in each
case less labor is organizing from Calais
to San Francisco to protect its wages against
this surging sea of supply In this
emergency it is a grave question how to
treat immigration and especially such
immigration as holds aloof from citizenship
and native society and it is not a question
to be settled by cant and reiteration of
commonplaces If the majority of the peo
pIe of the United States do not want any
more foreigners of this undesirable class to
se ttle here they have a perfect right tQ say
I so and to put this preference into law
V Eight Bourn a Day
WASHINGTON December lOThe Federa
tion of Labor Unions of the United States
and Canada resumed its session today and
rook up for consideration the resolution providing
viding that the eighthour rule shall take
effect from May first next The question
used general debate and developed a diversity
versity of opinion as to the best method of
accomplishing the desired result Some of
the delegates favored a gradual adoption
some proposed a fine for working over hours
while others urged that double pay be exacted
acted for extra work and others again advo
cated a general consultation with the employers
ployers in order to secure united action
On reassembling at 2 oclock the eight
hour resolution was passed with the
amendment that while it shall go into force
May 1st such organizations as were not ca
pable of doing so at the time lend their as
sistance to those who would undertake to
carry out the resolution A discussion of
the subject of arbitration showed that many
unions considered arbitration as first neces
sary before resorting to boycotting and
trikins V I

FORTYNINTH CONGRESS

WASHINGTON December The following
is todays Senate proceedings
After the reading of the journal Mr Ed
munds introduced a bill to provide for the
establishment of a postal telegraph Be
ferred to the Committee on Postoffices and
Postroads In introducing the bill Mr
Edmunds said it was the same bill he had
introduced at the last session of Congress
which went to the Committee on Postoffices
and Postroads and was reported upon by
that committee so late in the session thai
the subject could not be considered by the V
Senate before the expiration of the session
He hoped thp committee wouldnow take the
earliest opportunity to reportit
A resolution offered by Mr Morrill was
agreed to ordering the payment from the
contingent fund of tho Senate of the actual
and necessary expenses of the Senate com
mittee appointed to attend the funeral of

A joint resolution introduced by Mr Mor

gents of the Smithsonian Institute John
MacLean of New Jersey Asa Gray of Massa
chusetts and Henry Coppe of Pennsylvania
and also appointing on the same Board
General Meigs of Washington in V place of
General Sherman rendered ineligible by the
removalof his residence from Washington
Dolph introduced a bill to repeal the law of
last session providing for a settlement of
the claims of officers and enlisted men of tim
army for the loss of private property des
troyed in the military service of the United
States This is the law to which the Presi
dent calls attention in his message as indefi
nite in its terms and on which he says If
it is to remain on the statute books it needs
amendment In moving a reference of the
bill to the committee on military affairs
Dolph cited the Presidents comments and
had the clerk read from the report of the
Secretary of War the statements that offi
cer with regard to the law in question and
to the difficulty experienced in its interpre
tation From these statements it appeared
that one of the claims presented was for an
indemnity for loss of clothing of a family of
six another for household furniture des
troyed in the great fire in Chicago and an
ther for the loss of two gold watches Mr
Dolph said he saw no reason why the Gov
ernment should act as insurer of the prop
erty of officers and soldiers in its army any
more than of the property of any more of
its servants and agents He objected to the
law also upon the ground that it established
no limit to the amount of property that
should be paid for and that it did not sufficiently
ficiently define the character of the articles
that were to be covered by its provisions
Cookrell saw noreason for any difficulty
in the interpretation of the law
Logan was opposed to the Government
Becoming insurer but the act complained
of admitted of no doubt as to its interpre

pew who has chnrge of Vanderbilts affairs I
pending the opening of the will said to a
I
representative of Cyrus Fields Mail and
Express this afternoon Tho will is all
right know its provisions but ordinary
delicacy forbids me to say what those pro
visions are Vanderbilt has had his affairs
in such shape the past three years that he
could step out at any moment and matters
would go along without perceptible change
The condition of his health was not satis
factory to him
HE WAS THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WOELD
His wealth exceeded all that of all tho Roths
childs put together Cornelius Vanderbilt
will have control of the interest in the New
York Central and Michigan Central and a
supervisory share in the Western roads
notably Northwestern William K will
have charge of the West Shore interest and
those of the Nickel Plate roads and with an
interest in the roads of Chicago Frederick
Vanderbilt is a director in all the roads I
must decline to tell what I know in relation
to the division of Government bonds and I
other portions of the estate George Van
derbilt the youngest son is 21 years old
He has no aptitude for railroad operations
The World says Vanderbilt was pecu I
Early reticent as to the disposition of his
property but after many interviews with his
intimate friends it is evidently the general
belief that Cornelius will be given the bulk
of the fortune in accordance with the Com
modores known wish that one member of
each succeeding generation be so endowed
It is remarkable how high Cornelius stood
in the estimation of men yesterday The
day before he was nobody today he is a
king
V
EVERYBODY SPEAKS WELL Or HTM
Of his conservatism and his executive V
ability
An intimate personal friend of Vander
bilLs said today Vanderbilt took the
deepest interest m politics but belonged to
no party Having selected candidates of
either party whom he thought the best men
few did more than he to promote their suc
cess In such cases he was extremely liberal
I in gifts to campaign funds He never cared
much what a mans views were on pnblio
questions or those in which ho was particu
larly interested but tried more to find out
if the candidate was a square man He had
a theory that if a man was unreliable or
corrupt no matter how favorable he might
be to his interests he Vanderbilt would be
one of his first victims and that a man who
was honest and had courage when he felt
the responsibilities of official position
would studythe merits of questions affect
ing Vanderbilts interests and would come
out substantially on his side The result
was he frequently astonished his friends by
supporting men they believed to be hostile
but in almost every instance the result
showed

man of this church over twenty years He
took an active part in all the duties of his
office and served on manv committees In
all matters where the aid of the church was
asked Tie was extremely liberal A great deal I
of E his money went into the contribution

was often called upon to pass around He I
had no morbid fear of death his attitude
was one of calm hope although for some

and deliberately stole a herd of twentyfive
cattle belonging to Americans When the
soldiers put in appearance the cowboys
asked them their authority for crossing into
Texas and driving off cattle The leader
told them they had better go back to camp
Titus asked the AdjutantGeneral for the

WASHINGTON December lOThe warm
endorsementgiven by the President in his
message to Captain Eads and his Tehuan

of surprise to members and Senators The
friends of Eads are of course very much
elated and the adherents of the Nicaragua
canal scheme are correspondingly depressed
Last summer a reexamination showed that
the work of constructing the canal would be
much easier than was before estimated
Eads has been looked upon by many people I
in Washington being very successful in
promoting legislation His scheme appar

NEW YORK December lOThe Chamber
of Commerce held a special meeting today
to take actiou upon the suggestion contained
in the Presidents message in relation io the
repeal of the law regarding the coinage of
silver dollars The Committee on Finance
and Currency reported that after careful
consideration they had unanimously agreed
to support the President of the United
States and the Secretary of the Treasury in
the stand they had taken in relation to the
suspension of the coinage of the present sil
ver dollar and recommend the adoption of I
a resolution to that effect and the memori
alizing of Congress to have the compulsory
act of February 1878 repealed The report
was adopted and copies ordered printed and
sent to members of Congress
The Journal of Commerces leader urges
with almost fanatical zeal the immediate
action of Congress on the line of policy set
forth by tho President and Secretary Man
ning It declares that if Congress does not
grapple with this question now and settle it
at once that it will probably drag along for
months During all this time it will keep
business men in a state of indecision and
alarm highly injurious jf not fatal to the
success of all commercial enterprises

HERES A PRETTY MESS
Judge Zaiics Fairness Not Ques
tioned A Picnic for the Police
and the Prostitutes
Judge Zanes decision in the Vander
cook case was a great surprise most of
the intelligent community and has been
the starting point for more sensation
The decision is being discussed by all
classes of people Bolivar Roberts said
to a DEMOCRAT reporter that he always
thought Judge Zane was honest in his
decisions and that he thought this morn
ings decision ought to be enough to sil
ence the cranks who have been everlast
ingly howling about Zanes unfairness
A rising young lawyer expressed him
self in the following language He is a
Brutus but I think his decision is
wrong
An old Mormon who has had much to
do with judges and courts in Utah said
to areporter that he never had any doubt
as to the conscienciousness of Judge Zane
nor of his morality but his decision is a
bigger bomb shell than if the Territory
had been placed under martial law
The result of the Courts ruling spread
like wildfire to all quarters of the city
andeven prominent attorneys gathered
in groups and questioned for the first time
the legal propriety of the unexpected de
cision
The admission that such cases were tri
able by the District Court and by indict
ment seemed a settler in favor of
something more just than a Mormon justices
tices court but from the law the resoluto
judge decided in favor of the Territorial
statutes which give all favors to the
prosecution save the one boon of a trial
in a justices court by a jury of twelve
menA great many went directly to Police
headquarters expecting to hear Vander
cooks examination at 1 oclock but as
that gentleman is out of the city the trial
was temporarily postponed The be
mirching evidence attending these cases
is something appalling to the refined
minds of many ladies and gentlemen who I
will have to run the gauntlet to prove I
their innocence

i
Thin Carleton Company closed their en
gagement last night with another
I crowded auditorium to witness The I
Mikado and the successful season I
played here is gratifying alike to the
opular baritone and the management of
the Opera House V
The humorous and ingenious libretto
Of The Mikado has had a splendid
interpretation at the hands of Carletons
artists and the ingenious and appropriate
music has had a firstclass orchestration
This was particularly noticeable in the
accompaniment of many of the pieces
To Sit in Solemn Silence and The
Criminal Cried as He Dropped Him
Down for examplebut it was in the
life and vim that some of the principals
imparted to the characters and the very
careful attention to discipline and detail
displayed at every point wherein Carleton
has achieved his success His company
is secondclass CQTjspaied with the one he
broughtVus before but yet his managerial
ability has repeated a like success Miss
Louise Paullin and Miss Alice Vincent
I
have given us an ideal and charming
Yum Yam and PittiSing but not so much
can be said of Leumaines NankiPoo I
He is a lazy tenor with some good upper I
notes which his English phlegmatic tern I
peramentinduces him to use very sparing I
be much in
ly and his acting appears to
the same strain of feeling Drew has made
KoKo a fine piece of comedy but not
better than may be expected of Spencer
of the home company should the ama
teurs reproduce the opera KoKos
scenes with Katishaif Carletons production
duction is to be taken as the correct I
thingdispel the hypercritical illusion j
that the home company burlesqued the i
piece too much Drew bringing in the
regular Bowery style of tragedy with good I
eff ctand indeed a review of Carletons i
erformance magnificent production as i
it has beenis one of credit the ama
tour company The PoohBah of Greens I
felden was firstclass work somo of his
solos revealing a grand voice and his ad i
mirable acting making a very favorable I
impression Carletons part of the Mik
ado was nothing new except his little I
business with PittiSing and the part i
is not as may be imagineda favorite one j
with him But the public cry for Mik i
