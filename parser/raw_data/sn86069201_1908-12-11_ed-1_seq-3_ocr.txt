Gov Wilson commuted the sentence
of Robert Hocker tho negro who was
to have been hanged at Lexington
In stating his reasons for commuting
the sentence of Rocker to life term In
the penitentiary Goy Wilson said In
a long opinion that he did not think
that Hocker had prcmcdltatedlv com
mitted the crime and that the story
of tho killing was probably not told In
Its entirety to the jury The commu
tation of pocket created some excite
ment at Lexington although there
was little of the mob spirit expressed
The Governor seems to like halrspltt
ting and hypothetical propositions
Wo might assume that the whole sto
ry Is never told and thereby grant
clemency Tho truth Is tho pardon
Ing power Is a dangerous thing In the
hands of any one man It should be
vested In a commission consisting of
men who aro Independent politically
and who will give bond never to ac
