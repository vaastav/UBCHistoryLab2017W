military conduct and service ?r supernumerary old
hem, and forced upon the department an unpleasant
duty. It i* believed, however, that me decisions
Shall; reached were fair, impartial and for tlic good
of the service. In accordance with the sauio act the
number of enlisted men was on July l reduced to
?o,?oo; indifferent soldiers were discharged, the
?tandard of recruits was raised with a view to Im
proving flic character ol the rank and die, and the
following lable of organization was established:?
Enlisted men of engineers 301

The staff of general officers was also reduced to

they could be of more lieneflt to /he service.

for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1809, were
$80,044,042 ; the expenditures lor the year ending
June 30, 1370, were $67,055,075, which sum in

and narbor Improvements, $3,915,900. Thus, dur
tag the year 1869-70, the reduction In expenses lu
the War Department amounted to $22,958,867 06,
and, during the year 1870-71, a tur.hor reduction of
$17,665 ,675 40 was made. For tbe uexi fiscal year

The total estimate for military appropriations for
Uie fiscal year ending June 30, 1873, Is $3-',416,472.
ui this csiuuaie the sum of $1,153,no" is necessi
tated by the prohibition or the use of unexpended
balances of former years, thus requiring estimates
lor rcapproprtatiou of such sums as nave re

The actor July 12, isvo, repeals the appropriation

SKRVICE8 OF THE WOOFS.
The reports of the General of tne Army and of the
division and department commanders, herewith
tobmitied. will convince the conutry that the
oncers and men of the army have performed the
duties devolving upon them laithlmly and welL
Though these duties, resulting from the determin..
tlon of the government to eniorce tne laws lor the
collection of the revenue and for the suppression
?f armed insurrection. have lew agreeable features,
$bey are perioraled with that cheerful energy
Which is the result oi discipline. The records of
the department show that loo applications for
troops tor various purposes and ior military protec
tion have been made since January l, 1871, all of
which, where the necessity required it, have beta
promptly responded to.
It is wltu treat embarrassment and difficulty that
the appropriations rnsde at the last session or Con
gress?reduced as tney wete below ihe estimates of
the ccpartmeunt?can bu so economised as to
answer the pressing requirements ot the service.
The operations ol active wariare 111 Aiizona, lu con
hection with Indian ultlleulttes there, ore such as
necessarily require large expenditures, and the
causes which have produced tnis necessity
were not anticipated by Congress when
tne appropriations were made. Ihc offi

BBCOMMEHPATTOK. . I
I recommend that the extra lieutenants now an* J
thorl/.ed by law to serve as regimental adjutants ami J
quartermasters In tlie artillen, cavalry and infantry
regiments, as provided by sections 2, 8 and 4 oi the !
act of July 28, lsTO, be discontinue l as vacancies
occur in tcose grades. This would effect an ultimate
reduction ot eighty lieutenants; would result In a
yearly saving, 11 the redaction should be completed,
oi nearly $ieo,ooo, and would oe or no detriment to
the service,
it is lurther recommended that the grade of quar
?ermaeter-senreant lor ibe companies ol cavalry,
liUantry and heavy artillery be abolisned. The
duties of tins non-commis.-ioued officer before tho
late war w ere uruaily discharged by tlic first ser
geant, and me present strength of a company is
such thai a return to the old system in this respect
oan well be made.
Willi regard to the grade-; of enlisted m"n known
as company artificer and compaur wagoner, the
atate of the service is now such its to jusilij the
recoinineiilaiioii that they, too, be discontinued,
OLd their duties devolved upon a smaller number
of private soldiers, detailed tor exira duly service
and employed uudcr direction of the Quartermaster
Department, btiouid tins recommendation be
adopted 1,165 enlisted men would i>e dispensed
wiih, a; a gross yearly saving of $412,740. From
this deduct tUe probable co,-.t of extra duty men,
estimated at two thirds the number ot artificer*;
and w air oners?|7J,-40?and the net saving will be
over f 840,00*.
Dy the aci of March .1, is?:i, the first six r?gl
meats of cavalry are each allowed one veterinary
surgeon at a compensation of $7s per month. Hy
the act ot July 28, 1866, the four other cavalry regi- i
meats are provided with tlic same organizedion,
wnh the additional allowance of one veterinary
Burgeon to each, at a compensation ol $loo per
mohib; that Is to sa?. two veterinary surgeons arc
allowed to each or ihe latter regiments, one at a
suiary of |75 per month and the other ut fl'K'. To
remedy this defective organization I recommend
that two veterinary surgeons be auihorlv,ed for
each cavalry regiment, at a compensation or f 100
pr month, and t hat the provisions ol the acts above
cited be repealed.
In the general rerulatlons ot the Rrmv ot 1867 a
plan is prase hied by which soldiers who ur< frngal
enough to save their pay shall have a safe deposit
for it. Hie outline is simply this:-?Not less than
8a may i?e deposited at any one tune with ihe
pannasier at pay dav, when a eneck nook will be
given the n.idier la which tne amount of deposit
will oe enter.,d. These deposits catiuot bo drawn

long to Hie personal e-ia'c of Ihe soldier, volnn
tartly ouutidcu b\ hira io ihe trust of the United
Blares uuii. he receive? ttnal payment on dlacharge.
Toe Mnehw ol uusp.au are various, u prevents
tbo viejous practice of (ontiding moucv 10 commis
sioned officers tor sale keeping, which Injures dis
cipline by the Invariable distrtites engendered and
H avoids Ute lumbering of the ua?toitj by constant
catty of pay not drawn.
Uy the restriction contained in section 7, act of
July 12, 1670, winch was interpreted bylheireav
ary Department to apply io those deposits, it be.
came mmmma lo lame an order for rescinding this
regulation, and to cause all the deposit* To is>
drawn from Uic Treasury by soldiers holding check
tK?oks. The amount was considerable, aud it is
feared many men were induced to desert by thus
coming into possession of unusually large sums
daring flicir form of scrvlre instead of receiving
tftern when discharged. It is room mended thai
provision be made to meet this unexpected tjipllca
Uou of the iegialative res:notion that the benefits of
the regulation may he restored to the soldier.
The law authorizes ihe enlistment of men who
eighteen years of age, and Uy Its languago "iho
nit snail b
wi eulisiiaeiit taken by ihe recruit snail be con
ciliative as to tna ago." The appeals to the depart
ment for the discharge of soldiers are almost iinm
beriesa. The toroe ol cleroa employed upon this
branch of office duty la not aufficient to ouawer the
repeated application* for dlacharge which fill the
orpo/iuirui mail a, aud thr stereotype refirat .natch
mart tn most- eases be given only stimulates the ap
plicant to obtain renewed appeals from per
eons of tnflncnce ami chaiactcr, who willingly
apply to the department, wttu a request for assist?
ante, "without reflecting upon the embarrassment
whtct. ia given, or upon the coat or a rcauit so easily
Iretw.ninemied and so difficult, to justify. The en
Itafjieni of each recruit and the cost of transporu
*'in to hla regtmcut involves au a vera bo expense
til $80 tn each case, liy bta di-charge this amount
In a total loss to the government.
The greater number or tno-e for whom this cosily
favor Is asked ore uuiler the age of twenty-one

law regarding oRiiiinients Ik- amended, and that
no recruit l?e permitted to cnt t ihe service wnoas

Experience shows that the age of enlistment for

Is advised that the law be so amended that hereaf

made at me age of twelve years.
It was round linpuesiole to prepare, in time for
buIhuHskm] to Congress at its last session, a system
or regain Ions tor the administration of the affairs
ortlwnrmv, as contemplated by inc. act of July 15,
187a A board of competent and experienced ofll
cers has been for some months diligently euga red
in the com nihil ion oi it cone or regula tons, and the
work Is rapidly approaching completion.
IIKSEKTIONR
.lining the past few moDths have largely increased,
'ihe reports received at tne department indicate
tha' the reduction of tne pay of soldiers iroin six
teen to thirteen dollars per mouth has comrlbuied
greatly to this result, as rar i.s those men are con
cerned who enlisted prior to July l, 18JI, the dale
of reduction.
MILITARY PRISON'S.
The board of odicers directed to Investigate the
subject of mtUMrv prison* and prison discipline m
the HrtUsii army visited, last summer, the only
military prison now in Canada. viz., the one at
ouebcc, and through the courtesy of the Inspector,
Coloucl H. If. Williams, were enabled to witness its
practical workings. The board were very favor

has been to equalize the selections for that list from
both tne higher and lower grades of the oflic rs en
titled tobe placed upon it. so mat it may nor be
filled to au unreasonable extent by officers oi high
rank, and consequently greater compensation.
There have been sixteen deaths of retired officers
during tne pad year.
THE CEMETERY IN MEXICO.
By the act approved September '28, 1850, appro
priation was made of $1u,i?o<j lor purchasing, wall
ing and dltcuing a piece of land near the city oi
Mexico, ior a cemetery lor sucU of the officers aud
soldiers of our ariny as leil m battle or died in and
around that cuy during the Mexican war, anu lor
tne iutermeut of American citizens w ho have died
there.
in December. 1809, a report was made hv the Vice
Coa-ul oi ihe United States at tue cuy of Mexico, to
the effect that in eou-equeuee ox neglect and the
want of meuns lor repmrs, many depredations were
being commuted, and that tne cemetery presented
a lamentable appearance of ucapidatiou. Au ap
peal was made to this department for funds to the
amount o: nnout one thousand one hundred i.nd
fifty dollars to be sent to the Consul to ensure lilni in
restore the cemetery to a condition creditable to the
United States govern menu The War Department was
toitunaieiy able to meet tne temporary demand,
but could not comply with a lurtber suggestion ior
the employment ol a superintendent at a .salary of
$50 per month instead or f-'J, rue rate heretofore
paid, and wnicn is ueemod insufficient. By the act
oi Jniy 31,11-52, iliere was appropriated ?i,4lJ 34,
and by the act of AuguSl 31, 1853, $3,o0b for the nnr
cna.se of the cemetery, under the direction of tno
President, and these sums were all disbursed by the
Department oi Mate. It is recommended that,
as tne general subject or national cemeteries is
now administered bv the War Deparrmeut, a special
act be passed placing mis cemetery npon toe same
footing as other cemeteries with a regularly ap
pointed superintendent, and thai a sufficient por
tion of the appropriations ror national cemeteries
be made applicable to ihe repair and preservation
of the one lu question. The latest report of the condi
tion oi the cemetery shows mat, with the temporary
aid afforded by tnis deparrmeut, its condition was
very materially improved. An appropriation or
is asked by the United States consul to com
plete the repairs aud to construct an artesian well
lor irrigation to preserve the shrnboery and save
the annual tax for water.
'1HK MONTANA INDIAN WAK CLAIMS.
By the tenth section of the act of July is. 1870, the
Secretary of War was requlroa to Investigate into
what are known as tho Montana Indian war claims
011*67, and to report to Congress the names oi the
persons entitled to relief, together witu a statement
of the wets ana suras upon wbicn each report may
be based. The lavesiig lion was conuded to an
Inspector General ot the army, whose report, setting
forth the nature and amount oi tne claims and the
amount required for an equitable settlement of
them, was submitted to Congress at the lust session
and commended to favorable consideration.
To complete the investigation, there remained to
bo submitted a list of tuc persons entitled to relief
and a statement ot the award equitably due to each
claimant. The list, when nearly finished, was, wun
most of the papers connected with the case, de
strovcJ in the late lire at Chicago. A greater part
of me original voucners, however, had bceu re
turned to their owners after certified copies had
been taken, and new coules can oonseqnentlr be
obtained. 1 lie claimants have been called upon
by advertisement to lurnl h such copies, or,
tu default thereof, to fl.e statements of
weir claims, and in this way the lost evidence
will be measurably renewed. With these papers
and such daia as survived, a new report of awards
can be made which will probably prove as reliable
as Hie one destroyed. Jnis report will bo laid be
fore congress without material delay, its early prep
aration depending wnolly upon the promptness
with w hich claimants respond to (lie Invitation to
replace their evidence.
MILITARY rOST AT FOBT SMELLING.

SALES OF CLOTHING.
The proceeds or sales of clothing from June 30,
1870, to the present dale amount 10 the sum of
$1,876,729 si, all or which, as collected, is turned
Into the Treasury and cannoi be used bv the depait
ment. Home of the purchasers Have not been able,
ou account of the disastrous eiTecta ol Hie Chicago
fire, lo meet tUclr engagements promptly, but the
ttnio of payment lias been cxtend'-d. a great
amount oi old clothing and equipage is unfit lor
army u-e, and hence larger appropriations will be
come necessary. Ihe cost of tran-portaiion lor this
year has been about $!,500.000, whicn is but little
less than lor the previous year. The reduced army
is compelled to increased activity lo compensate for
its loss In cumbers.
Tho appropriation for
St KR At AND QrABTlER3
has not been sufficient to shelter the army In a man
ner c-sentlal to its comfort and health, and hence it
is earnestly desired that the appropriation asked lor
that purpose may not be reduced.

The law forbids trie purchase by the Secretary of
War oi anv lamia wiir.out special authority of Oon
gress. New posts oil the remote auu unsettled
frontier or that State ha\e generally been located
on the public lands belonging to the
Mute, us tuere ore no public lands
available owned by the United Mates In 1exs?. As
soon as this department begins to erect shelter for
the troops, speculators enter these lands, and hence
clstms ari?e for rent and timber to an amount far
bevond ilieir value. An net authorizing the depart
ment to qntct line to sues already occupied, and ro
purchase such as may hereafter be required, Is
neccs-ary to remedy the evil.
Tint <OMMI?uARV nRPARTMKNT.
Tho report of Ihe Commimury General of Subsist
ence shows that the army has been well supplied
uurlng the pu-d year. 1 agree wuh him that accord
ing to tho varying necessities of troops stationed in
the funereal chmates of the country, there should
be authorized lor tssua substitute articles, so that
the b?od of the ?o)dt< r may be at times varied from
tn<< regular ration. Hi nee the last annual report a
detailed statement lias been furnished the Depart
ment ol the interior of the expenses Incurred in tne
fiscal year of 1760-70 by Uie Subsistence Department
in lurnishiiig supplies for Indians, which snows tho
amount to have been over $1,000,000, of which
$1,200,000 has been repaid by trausler at the Treas
ury. 11 is desirable that appropriations for tho sub
sistence 01 Indians wuon necessary be made lor the
disposition ol tne interior Department, as tho sum
s no dice fond or this Department, based upon the
appropriation actually necessary for Uic support of
the army 1* not large enough to allow auy pomou
to itc diverted from Its legitimate use witnout em
barrassment to t'iC service.
MElHCAL M ATTIC IIS.
Owing to tho ?eii( lency existing in the clerical
force ot the surgeon General's omce, a large nmu
l>er or official demands ror information lrom the
records o the ofllco lor the setuementof pension
and oilier emima liave remained unanswered,
ruder tno act of Congress aoinorlzing the appoint
ment of no.spltul stewards, that force has neen
str. ngu ened, and It is hoped that the accumulated
work will he rapidly disposed ol. There were 2bfl
military posts requiring medical attendance on
jniy 1, 1870. The number or mcuical officers is in
sufficient for the service, and 1 renew the recom
mendation that the law prohibiting promotions and
appointments in that corps be repealed.
Part tii st of the Medical and Surgical nistorv of
the War is uear completion and will be laid before
Congress duttng lu coming session, when, It is
hoped, sufficient appropriation will no made to con
tinue the nub.icauon of the remaining parts. The
report of the Medical Statistics of the Provost Mar
shal General's bureau, the compilation of which
was authorized ov the act ol July 28, 1808, Is also
neatly completed and Is in process of being printed
at the government printing office, it is expected
thai the entire report will be printed an I rea ly lor
distribution during the approaching session.
The corps of Engineers during tho past year has
been actively engaged upon the works tor
THE DKPBNUB OK OrH SKA COASTS
on river and Itnroor improvements, and in snrveys
and reconnaissances and construction ot light
houses. With the appropriations granted for forti
fications in our principal harbors, these works
along the Northern Atlantic and Paoinc ooasts uave
hecn pushed forward in their modifications as
rapidly as the circumstances would permit, and
already the bstt nes are beginning to assume the
character needed bv tha requirements of modern
warfare. The modiiicatl ns reioired to looktotne

heavy earthen batteries lor the largest gnns and
mortars.
THE FN(J INKERS.
Since tho last report the battalion of engineers
has been reduced to 304 enlisted men, an i consti
tute* ait efficient hodv of troops, and is careiuiiy
Instructed and drd ed tu its dunes. The engineer
posts and depots of Jefferson llnrrackg and Verba
buena Island have been broken up ami me
troops are now concentrated at Willett's
Point and West Point, New York. Besiuos
assisting m the Instruction of the cadets of
the Mituary Academy, the battalion of engineers
consulate* the school for the trials with torpedoes
for the deiencc oi our harbors, and takes charge or
the depots tor the bridge trains and equipage and
engineer tools lor the use of tb army in general.
The appropriation asked lot torpedoes and ouier
purposes at the engineer depot at Willett's Point
and recommended to Congress.
A visit made to WUlet's Point In September last
gave me an opportunity for inspecting closely the
management oi me past and lor observing the ad
vantages offered the men In drill and discipline, and
in tbc education necessary for that arm of die ser
vice. Ihe result was very gratifying. The thorough
mode of instruction and the pertected drill of the
battalion deserve commendation.
bausiactory progress has beeu made in the prose
cation of works for the improvement 01 rivers mid
harbors and or the surveys connected inerewtth.
The annna. report of tne Chief ot Engineers con

THE ARSENALS.
During the fiscal year small-arms and ordnance
stores to the amount of $lo,o.?.Odo have been sold,
and the entire proceeds, except a small sum re
tained to meet expense of preparing other stores
for sale, have pas ed into the Treasury beyond ttio
control or this department. The operations at the
arsenals have been confined to the inanuiaclute
or supplies required by the troops, to the care of
stores on hand, and to the manufacture of oue
or two experimental gun carriages, it is hoped
that congre-s will grant vne appropriations naked
for to carry out the plans tor the continuance ot
the work at ihe great arsenal ot construction for
the Mississippi valley at Kock Island. Several
kinds ot experimental rifles and carbines, as re
commended by the ht. Louts board, have been
mannfactnred at Springfield Armory for compara

OPERATIONS IT THE SIGNAL STATIONS.
At Fort Whipple, Va., instruction liai been given
in me meteorological nafles and studies inquired tit
the signal stations tor observations and reports of
storms throughout tho Untied States, and 111 mili
tary signaling and telegraphy to officers
pf the army and navy. During the year the
observation and report of storms hai been neces
sarily ratcer in the process of organization ior fit
~ iliaii as fiouimetcTy 6ig,
tiifo success hiaii as completely oig.imzod. A duty ;
without precedent has uad to be originated in nil us ?
details or plans ami discipline?the observation,
reports and mode of makiug public the ucccssary
deductions and reports. Tho progress made has
been fully ns great as could have been anticipated,
and has secured valuable results and gives promiso
ol extended uselulness.
By n comprehensive telegraphic organization each
of ihc signal stations is in teiepraphic communica
tion wpii the Signal Office at Washington, and Irons
each ol tlicm dailv and nlglitlj weatr.cr reports are
received at the Department. Tnese reports are
stud;ed, bulletined and charted at tno office of the
t'liiot signal officer, and are inrnishcd at the same
time to most ot the principal cities and ports or too
country. The deductions rrom the sfmty of the re
ports itre instantly telegraphed to tne press and
bulletined as soon as practicable at the observing
oitic s, in board or trade i< oms. merchants' ex
changes. and o'her prominent places, and during
the past year there have issued tti this manner from
the ('lucf Signal Office and tne observing stations
fifty thousand charts.
in tho month of October the display ol c .ntionary j
signals, announcing the probuolo approach of <
storms, was commenced, lor the first time to the
United States,at twenty ports upon the lakes and j
Atlantic and Oulf coasts. These signals are ar- 1
ranged to be dlspiaye i at anv hour of the day or
night, upon the receipt of telegraphic orders Iroin i
Washington.
(While ihc service has been rapidly organized and
pressed to these results each step has iieeu taken
ouly w hen the public mind seemed to be educated
and prepared lor it and the public necessity de
manned it. The average time of the lecclpt by tele
graph oi the r- ports and observations made simul
taneously from all the stations t nrouguout the United
Stales has been lorty-flve minutes. The average
time elapsing between the moment at. which tele
grams were sent to the office at Washington from
t he most distant stations to tnat at which the de
ductions are insole, punished and Issued to the
press has been ninety minutes.
Of the deductions publlsned from the office sixty
nine per cent are, utter a careful examination of the
statistics, considered to have nceu fuPy verified.
This percentage, increased by ttioso regarded as
partially verified, will make an aggregate of ninety
per cent of average verifications.
it has been tne policy of the department to diffuse
as widely as possible, tor the use ol eo operating in
stitutions and for scientific atnty everywhere, tho
meteorological information collected at its stations
and upon us records. It Is believed that the
United Htates now possesses a service more exten
sive and better onraniced for these purposes than
that ol any other country.
The steadiness, regularity and promptness with
whtob the varied labors Incident to a work co
extensive with tho United Htates, and which
requires in its details a vigilance reaching through
both night and day, have neen accomplished, illus
trate the advantages gained by placing these dntles
under military direction. A rigor less than that of
military discipline would fall to sccuro the accuracy
and strict obedience to orders which nave been
necessary.
Under the second section of the sot of July 24.
lfttiC, to aid in the construction ot telegraph lines,
and to secure to the government tne use of tno
same for postal, mliiary and other purposes the
Postmaster General lias fixed tne ratea at which
telegraphic communications for the government
shad be sent. The plan and method or compensa
tion have worked well, and are lonud to be of much
economy to tne signal service.
Tne wlsoom of Congress in alToMing facilities for
its prosecution Is dauy exemplified, The labors of

Dkak Sir?In our sales of eoiu recently we have
experienced great annoyance by the return to Us
from buyers of slightly worn coins, which, wc are
informed by the Custom House officers, are rejected
by them because of receut orders from you. Coins
slightly discolored or covered more or less with

House lor similar reasons. For so ion.' u time tiie-e

mutilated nave been lor years commonly rojeoed,
but those to which we rc.cr aro pieces which,
through ordinary wear and tear?uauiral attri
tion?have s.lghtly lost In weight. The rusty ami
discolored corns, we understand, are lejected
simply because ihcy arc such, without any claim to
loss in weight or value. More recently we have had
several coins returned to ua j.criect in appearauce,
evidently little used since being Issued, but still
ciatmed to ne "snort." These we nave examined
caiefudy, and are convinced that, if the weight is
wrong, as it appears to be, the mint which l.-sued
the colu is at fault. In such a case, whero the coin
bears no evidence of having been tampered with,
and Is not worn, tan tne Treasury i.ep.irtmciit
properly disown Its own cullrt? Attain, where appa
rently no provision la made for retirement of worn
or dlscoli red coins, or, rather, no effort made by
tiie general government to retire such upon drat

Messrs. Townsenp, Lyman a Co., New oneaus,
La.:?
Gentlemen?I have received your letter of the
4th lust. lu relatiou to recent rejections of light,
rusty and discolored coin by 'lie customs officers of
this port, lor tlie aliened reason tout this office de
clines to receive such coin from t num. As it has
been tor years and still Is the acknowledged custom
of the c luiunintlty to reject com which has Peen
undiluted either by punching. soldering. ,
thing or sweating, your reierence to sucn ,
com will need no reply from me. In re- i
gard to genuine coins which have become :
lmui through ordinary wear in naudliug. 1 would I
state that mis ottlce does not reject lor ??slight'' loss
as you seem to believe, uulcss the loss 01 iroin one
to turce per cent on the lace value of the com is con- l
sidcred slight, fieces which bear uo evidence ot j
having uceu tampered with, and do not snow a loss I
111 weight ol more loan one per cent, are received as
cuneut, and tins standard will exclude but very
lew cuius wmch have not been reduced ov s.uiie uu
lawiul means, such us iiirnmg, nnug or sweating.
The appearance of coin niter having been snbmitted
to the sweating process, being so very sun par to
tuat of legitloiutciy worn coin, it becomes necessary
to exclude sucn coin when it snail luii m-.ow a cer
tain stands, d. therefore me weight lest becomes an
important one lu determining the value 01 ah coin.
As the law docs not deilnc how much a coin
may lose in weight and suit be a legal tender lor
the value expressed upon us lace?winch irom
tue nature ol the case is a very difficult problem
to solve. Inasmuch as any speciucd uhowuuco
might, and prooably woain. stimulate unlaw. 11
practices lu Inc debasement of new and lull weignt
com, and as each Treasury Office is in a in- a-a re
responsible for its own transactions the above limit
has oeen fixed as at once tue most Inst and eq.ilt
ante ol any that cau oe estaffiisued oeiweeu the
government, its agents and those who hold its
nsaes of com. In relation to discolored and rusiy
coins, l would say there can be uo question as to
the propriety and Justice ol rejectlug lhcm us un
merchantable, thus Blueing the ex pen-a: ol oleaa
hi ,- mem and of any m.,s incident thereto upon

1' >r instance, if, for the suae of smety, United

ored uy rust or corrosion, or, tf, for the sage ol de
basement, experiment or otner reason, it Is ex
posed to the action oi acids and tnereby lis appear*
mice Is changed, 1 see uo reason why the govern
ment should at its own expense clean soch coin. I
cannot coincide wuu your suggestion mat some
corns found to be considerably lfgnt, although ap
parently not inneh worn, wore issued by me Mint
In that courtliion, and I tiling yon have out to ac
qnamt yourselves witn the many effective means

Sir?Yours or the l <tn instant lu reply to that of
Messrs. Townsend. Lyman A Co., on the sublect of
the .ejection, by you, of coanlerieit, light and de
laced gold coin. Is approved. Wuu regard to coun
terfeit and Bach or tne light anu deiaced coin as
owes its diminution or de.acement to filing, sweat
ing, or any other illegal practice, yon correctly stale
thai there can be no question as to tue right or pro
priety of the government to refuse to receive it. As
to such of tue light and deiaced colu, however, as
owes lis diminution or dciaccment to natural wear
during the pieces* ol prolonged circnluiion, tne
quo .lion very prorerly arises whether or not the
government is bound bv any principle of law or
justice to redeem it, regardless of tho extent of
abrasion or diminution. It is tho practice, aud, as
lar as 1 know, has always been, of the I intc i Mates
Assistant Treasurer at New Voracity, through whose
oitice the bulk of our coinage passes, to reject no
coin, however light, if the diminution Is the result
of natural wear and use; in souie ot the oilier lu.ie
penncnt Treasury offices a different practice lias
obtained, but no general rule on the subject has as
yet beeu adopted and lUo preponderance oi the
evidence as to past practice aeems to be iu favor of
that In vogue In Hie New York office. Ol late, how
ever, so much light ruin lias made its appearance
and been presented to our indopeudeat Treasury
officers, and the los i re-ulting troin us recomago
has been so great, wniie the practice of sweating
and thai or filing and re-recding the periphery, have
been reduced to such a science as to inmost defy
detection, tUat a different and general rn.e seems
to be demanded, both lor ttie purpose of pun.ylng
onr coin circulation and for tne protection ol the
government. An Investigation of the mint laws of
almost all the principal Powers of Europe will dem
onstrate that they have by law nxod a limit, be
yond which uo allowance is made for natural abra
sion, aim 1 cannot doubt that among some at least
of tnese Powers the subject was luliy considered
Willi u view to the Justice ol the limit prescribed,
both as to the government and tho private citizen,
Moreover, 1 believe Congress would long since have
in.ffie a similar provision if the siloject bad been
properly brought before it. This I propose to uo at
lis coming session. The Intimation on tue part or
Me is s. Townsend, Lyman A Uo. that some oi the
coins in qaeatlon must have been light at the tune
of their coinage, or mat the mint at which trier
were corned is responsible for tnelr ligiit weight, is
untenable, as the law provides ample and sufficient
safeguards lor tho speedy detec.lon and punish
ment ol the coming aud Issuing by officers or the
Mint or any of Its branches oi any light pieces.
Supposing, then, that ml tho United Mates
coiuage is originally of standard weight,
may not the department with equal
propriety prescribe regulations for its re
ception ana redemption, a* It now does for the
reoeption and redemption of lis currency. It has
long since been a rnic to dednct a proportionate
amount irom badly mutilated notes, aud wlio ques
tions eliner the propriety or the right 1 These regu
lations are necessary botn for the maintenance ot a
clean aud proper circulating medium and tne protec
tion ut the government agninst iraud and imposition.
Were tue department to redeem all note* no matter
how badly muUlaled, it will readily be seen what
an opportunity such a practice would open (or
designing persons to destroy whole notes, and
present them In fractional parts. So also If tne
government will rcectvo and redeem at their lull
value, coins, no matter how light, even on account
of natural wear, it would open a way lor great
deception and iraud by tlie sweating, and filing,
und re-reeding processes, winch, an already stated,
olten defy detection. The rejection of light coins
may for a time ami in certain instances operate
harshly, aud seemingly unjust; but a regular and
general compliance with Hurh a regulation wonld
pnrlly onr coin cremation and pat it in the condi
