A butter expert in an
up-to-the-minute
plant
The new Troco plant, just completed, is
the latest, most up-to-date margarin plant
that it is possible to design.
It is under the supervision of A. E. Hoffman,
a famous butter expert, who for 30 years
has made butter, judged butter and taught
butter making in leading dairy schools.
Famous in the butter world
Mr. Hoffman was famous for the peculiarly
sweet, delicate flavor of his butter. He puts
this same sweet, delicate flavor into Troco.
The white, nutritious coconut fat which
replaces butter fat must meet an exacting
laboratory test.
All milk used comes from selected herds
and is twice pasteurized.
What you can't expect
Troco is the fancy brand of nut margarin,
with quality standardized. You can count
on fresh, appetizing deliciousness.
What you can't expect is price cutting to
compete with other brands. Troco may
always cost a few cents more.,
Ask your dealer. If yours hasn't it In
Btock tell him to order it. All leading
dealers should supply Troco

Photos show party placing American flag on a peak of Mount Blanc
when the peak was named after President Wilson.
Part of the limestone pyramid, which forms the peak of Mount
Blanc, known as the highest mountain in Europe, split and fell a few
days ago and started a giant avalanche which traveled nearly ten
miles. The great mass of limestone, rock, snow and ice tore out the
whole forest of Pourtoud. It threw giant pine trees and boulders about
like matches and marbles. It came to a halt just at the edge of the
Italian village of Pourtoud. The dislodged piece of the mountain peak
took 600 feet from the peak's height which was 15,782 feet and left
Mount Blanc below Mount Rosa in height

THE TOPEKA STATE JOURXAL
BY MARGARET RORE .
New York, Dec. 4. Fifth avenue
windows of today look like lawn fetes
or Easter, bazaars. Fluffy, crisp and
cool organdies, embroidered nets and
laces, sunshades and bathing suits, and
leghorn and-maline hats have routed
the sterner fashion stuff of winter.1
The Palm Beach-Hot Springs , crowd
are casting eager eyes upon this torrid
zone raiment, and the stay-at-homes
cast no less ardent orbs. For, be it
known, it is this advance summer re
sort clothing that sets the style for
northern spring and sumnTer wear,
and it is an open secret that manu
facturers are already making spring
and summer clothes along the very
same lines indicated by the resort
finery, which is now doing a thriving
business for the retailers.
. Flower effects in both color, pattern
and line hold sway in many different
realms of fashion. One house is show
ing a window of soft crepe silk skirts
adorned with hand-blocked flowers
that swirl about the hem. There is a
white skirt, bordered in gay black
eyed Susans. Another shirred model
of canary yellow crepe uses a moUf of
gorgeous nasturtiums. Plain colored
silk skirts are selling very well to the
southern trade, especially modes of
cornflower blue and rose pinks.
Other nobby skirts are developed in
combinations of silk and wool. One
house is showing crepe made up with
yokes and panellings of duvetyn. :jlar;k
and white is most conspicuous in this
line. Even white wash skirts glow
with some fleck of color. Narrow
bandings of copper color edge the
pockets and belt of many models.
Large, floppy hats in summery
shades to match the rainbow tints of
dresses, blouses, and skirts abound.
Ribbon hats seem most popular. Wide
Roman stripe ribbon fashions many
chapeaux and demands no additional
trimming. These gay hats are worn
with sport and white costumes.-. Rub
berized silk is pressing to the fore as
a bat fabric. One charming model of
rose color trimmed with flowers of the
same material is being shown.
The shiny effects given by grlycer
lned feathers, ribbons, and shellaced
braids are being resurrected for next
season. Many of the most exclusive
shops are selling hats of cire taffeta,
trimmed with uge bows of self-material.
Organdie itself fashions many
of the airiest hats. Flame color Is
very popular. All cloth fabrics are
very good, by the way. A house which
sells importations Is asking a fabulous
price for a demure poke bonnet fash
ioned of porcelain blue taffeta and
trimmed with vari-colored appliqued
flowers of silk and wool.
Organdie has been found fit for a
brand new fad. This Is its use for
little corsage bouquets. Rich evening
gowns of stiff brocades and metallic
cloths are given a wee ingenue fleck
by the flower of organdie at shoul
der or bodice, the "sweet-girl-grad-uate"
effect Is continued by little
puffed sleeve dresses with hish-waisted
shirred bodices and full skirts. The
baby sleeves are generally of organdie
and are trimmed with eyelet embroid
ery or beading.
' Dame Fashion seems more fickle
with her warm-weather dresses than
any other part of her wardrobe. There
are Princess models with long-waisted
bodices made. from organdie or Voile,
and full skirts of a contrasting taffeta
There are tunic dresses of taffeta with
Medici collars of organdie. There are
beaded chiffons and georgettes, and
duvetyn, the winter's favorite mater
ial, continues into this warm-weather
stock. There are many jacket blouses
of crepe trimmed with gay duvetyn
collars and cuffs.
Dress, skirt. And suit makers seem
agreed on the slogan "Back to the
Soil," for all the hems show a notice
able drop, Nine Inches above has
come to be the standard height. In
contrast to the winter vogue for twelve

STREET CAR CASE TO JURY
Joseph . Donnelly . Asks for $10,000
Ravages In Accident. '
A public service corporation that is
now charging- 8 cents and is asking
permission to charge 19 cents for
rido of two blocks is not a friend of
the Jury in the second division of the
fhawnee county district court, Elisha
cott, negro attorney, asserted in his
argument before the jury today.
The Topeka Railway company and
Walter slonroe, a. negro, are co-defendants
ih a suit brought by Joseph
Donnelly, a negro, for the death of his
wife, Sarah DonneUy, who was killed
a year ago when she was struck by
Monroe's Ford car at Fifth aifd Kan
sas avenues. Donnelly asks f 10,000
from the Btreet Railway company and
Monroe. Each of the defendants have
their own attorneys and each is seek
ing to shift the burden of the judg
ment upon the other in case such a
judgment is given in favor of the
plaintiff. -
Donnelly charges that the Street
Railway company is partly responsi
ble because of a pile of sand left in the
center of the intersection. Monroe's
car struck this sand, causing him to
lose control of it. It then struck the
woman, dragging her several feet and
causing her injuries of which she died
a uay later in a local hospital.
Tom Doran. in his argument after
all the evidence had been presented,
expressed to the juryv the belief that
they would not render a verdict
against the Topeka Railway company
their friend.
"Your friend," repeated Scott. "A
corporation that is charging you eight
cents for a ride and is now asking the
industrial court for permission to
charge you ten cents for a Jide of two
blocks. I'll say that corporation is
no friqnd of mine."
The jury retired to deliberate upon
the evidence at noon today.
Following Mrs. Donnelly's death,
Monroe was tried on a charge of man
slaughter, but acquitted by a jury in
the firfct division of the district court.

Wool Dress Goods
Ninety days ago piece goods were sky high. Today the prices
have slid into the cellar, and within the week we have been able to
buy woolen dress fabrics on a very satisfactory basis. .
To insure a complete selling of the entire -lot this week, we are
pricing them much lower than if they were to remain in stock for two
months. .
Only the most staple goods are represented in the line, and these
in the most desirable shades.
Bear in mind that a great portion of these goods are going to be
sold this week, and some one might possibly be disappointed in find
ing that a desired fabric is sold out.' That will be unavoidable, Tele
phone information concerning the pieces will be cheerfully given, but
no goods will be cut on phone orders. .
