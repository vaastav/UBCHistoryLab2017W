THE NEED OF A GREATER NAVY.
The great American squadron of
battleships has left Hampton Roads
for the Pacific ocean and many east
ern newspapers especially in the larger
cities on the Atlantic seaboard are
fearful of consequences and are pro
phesying all sorts of dire and Injuri
ous results. These apprehensions are
based partly upon self interest and
partly probably upon actual fear.
These newspapers and the people
whose sentiment they express and
there is no doubt that these are
many, however, are too prejudiced
and too much .under local Influences.
They do not take into considera
tion that the United States has be
come a two ocean power and that the
interests of the extensive Pacific
coast and the American colonial pos
sessions in the Pacific must from now
on be protected and looked after.
In the great West where the people
are more apt to view this question
with impartiality and coolness, the
action of the Roosevelt administration
in sending the fleet to the Pacific
meets with much approval and is be
lieved to be the right thing at the
right time. The Pueblo Chieftain evi
dently expresses the views of the peo
ple of the Rocky mountain states and
territories well and precisely in an
editorial which is well worth reading
and considering. Says the Chieftain:
"In nothing will the cruise of the
battleships to the Pacific be more val
uable to the nation than in the dem
onstration of the double frontage of
this country. Ever since its begin
ning the great republic has faced the
Mpnt'" and this has been the atti
;reat civilized nations,
ption. But the victory
.ussia and the awaken
las brought about a
It is not sufficient for
we safeguard our At
d leave the Pacific
cou. ances of peace or war.
The Pacittc coast demands considera
tion of and for Itself, and no nation
situated as we are situated can afford
to neglect its evident duty.
"Great Britain also, by reason of
its possession of Australia and India
and Canada, is confronted with a sim
ilar problem, and has solved It, tem
porarily, by concluding an alliance
with Japan, a cheap substitute for a
Rreater navy and an enormous ex
rendlture for coast defenses.
"It will be surprising If we do not
hear in the near future a great deal
about the unprotected condition of
the Atlantic seaports. WTlth the bat
ileships in the Pacific we shall expect
the New Yorkers and Bostonlans and
Phlladelphlans to waken some morn
ing in a state of blue horror and
imagine themselves bombarded by
the allied fleets of Europe. All of
which will contribute to a proper un
derstanding of the danger of leaving
the Pacific coast without proper pro
tection. "The plain geographical fact Is that
this Is a two-ocean country, and we
have got to have a two-ocean navy. If
wo need a navy at all, we need one
that will take care of both sides of
the continent. The opening of the
Panama canal will be an immense ad
vantage in the scheme of national de
fense, but with the Increasing vol
.ime of commerce which that canal
will undoubtedly bring there is no
reasonable prospect that the United
States will be able to decrease its
navul appropriations, at least until
some international agreement upon
this subject Is reached.
, "The problems of Atlantic and of
Pacific defense are Independent of
each other and they should be con
sidered Independently. We caunot Af
ford to be without a reasonable navy
in the Pacific as we have been for
many years, We cannot afford to be
without a reasonable navy in the At
lanticas we are going to be for sev
eral months to come."
There is another good reason why
next year's irrigation congress in
Albuquerque should be a success.
Considering the large number of sa
loons that have existed in the Duke
City for the past twenty-seven years
the Albuquerqueans have evidently
had considerable experience In Irrigating.
Governor George Curry's swinging
around the circle in the Sunshine Ter
ritory is doing great good In many
directions, especially in this that
his visits are occasions during which
'the people get together" and be
come imbued with a strong and uni
ted public spirit for the Advance-of
the commonwealth, ;
THE PEOPLE WILL DO THE
CHOOSING.
The Washington Post, right on the
ground in. the national capital and
about as well posted a newspaper as
there is on this great North Ameri-:
can continent handles the presidential 1
situation and the powerful pressure1
brought upon President Roosevelt to
talk, in a very proper, judicious and,
fair way in a recent editorial. Its
reasonings and conclusions will meet
with the approval of the millions of
American citizens who do the elect
ing of the executive of the country
every four years. Says the Post:
"Presidential candidates and those
who think they are candidates are in
tortures over the 6ilence of President
Roosevelt. Their retainers, camp fol
lowers, swampers, roustabouts, and
hangers-on generally share in the pal
pitations of their leaders. There is
a deafening chorus of yells and a
horrible pressure of 'influence, all
directed against the silence of Theo
dore Roosevelt. He is beset by letter,
telegram, and note; by open challenge
and crooked insinuation; by politici
ans and petticoats, the aim being to
extort from him, by fair means or by
foul, a statement that may throw light
upon his attitude toward the next
presidential election. What is want
ed, more particularly, Is a direct and
official statement from him that he is
not a candidate for re-election.
"No one with bowels of compassion
can fail to sympathize with the sorely
tried individuals whose pathway to,
the White House is blocked by the
stocky and silent form of Theodore
Roosevelt. It Is too bad, of course,
that the President will not speak at
the behest of all the persons who are
willing to succeed him or who have
friends who are willing to serve as
President. Yet, if an innocent by
stander may be permitted to inject
a remark, it seems just a little intru
sive on the part of these good peo
ple to prod the President so relent
lessly. Are they not in danger of for
getting that he is supposed to know
what he is about? Are they sure they
are not stepping over the bounds of
politeness when they Intimate that a
second statement from him will vali
date the first or prove It a He?
"The public demand for Mr. Roose
velt may be such as to make it im
possible for him to refuse renomina
tion and re-election. The Post has
expressed the opinion that, as matters
are drifting, this may be the case. But
the public demand is one thing and
one man's desires another. It Is the
people of the United States who are
choosing a President. If they want
Mr. Roosevelt, they will get him, and
declarations piled mountain high will
not stop them. If they do not want
him, no revocation of his election
night declaration supposing that he
wore capable of such an act would
secure him the Presidency.
"Would It not be well for overeager
persons to remember that J.r. Roose
velt is in a position to know the will
of the people better than any other
man, and that he Is fully aware of the
fact that whether he speaks or
keeps silent the will of the people
will prevail? Would it not be more
seemly to leave Mr. Roosevelt's busi
ness to Mr. Roosevelt, Instead of
trying to compel him to reiterate
something he has said already?"
REMOVE , THE TARIFF FROM
WOOD PULP.
The recommendation of President
Roosevelt in his recent 'message to
Congress that the tariff on forest pro
ducts be either taken off or greatly
reduced meets with approval all over
the country except with those few for
tunates who are called the lumber
kings. These are not many but they
are powerful. They have grown very
rich during the past twenty years and
naturally do not care to stop. Under
the present tariff laws and the pres
ent methods of using the timber
which still exists in limited areas in
this country it is but a question of a
decado or two that a lumber famine
will come to pass. In this the thou
sands and thousands of newspapers of
the country are vitally interested.
Wood pulp is one of the principal In
gredients used in the hianufacture of
white print paper and the consump
tion is enormous and constantly grow
ing. A stop must be made and that
promptly, There are vast supplies of
timber .from which wood pulp can be
secured in Canada and Central and
(South America. The tariff on wood
pulp should be abolished at any rate
for tho next two or three decades, in
order that tho forests In this coun
try might be fostered and timber
again Increased so that in the future
there will be no danger of its exhaus
tion and scarcity.
Concerning tho president's recom
mendation the Denver Republican be
lieves rightly when it says:
"Some of tho Michigan lumber
kings object to the president's rec
ommendation that all tariffs on for
est products bo removed. They have
grown rich over the protection given
their lumber interests and they fear
an invasion from the forests of Can
ada. "The need of checking the destruc
tion of timber in the United States
may, however, prove more powerful
than these objections. Every one
knows that tho forests of this coun
try are in danger of exhaustion, and
that there is especial danger that the
home supply of wood-pulp will be con
sumed. But In Canada there are vast
areas of virgin forest from which all
the timber needed in the United
States could be drawn, thus protect
ing our, forests and preventing an ab
normal advance In the price of lum
ber. "Both the need of protection to our
forests and the demand for cheaper
building material unite in approval of
the president's suggestion to Congress
respecting the removal of the present
tariff, provided Canada would agree
not to enforce an export duty."

HERVEY AS ATTORNEY GENERAL
Referring to the appointment of
James M. Hervey, as attorney gen
eral of the territory by Governor Cur
ry, the Register-Tribune published at
Roswell, Mr. Hervey's home and
knowing whereof it speaks, makes the
following very favorable comment:
"The appointment of James Madi
son Hervey as attorney general last
Thursday, is one that gives general
satisfaction to all of the people of the
Pecos Valley, and will go far toward
inspiring the fullest confidence; In
tho territorial administration, which
however, good at heart could not at
tain the best results without a
legal adviser who is absolutely
above reproach and Incorruptible.
These two adjectives exactly de
scribe Mr. Hervey, the writer making
this statement from a very close per
sonal knowledge of more than a de
cade. There la another point about
his selection, also, and that is that
while Governor Curry may be new in
the ways of government he has a
mighty long head in his selection of
aides. With Jaffa, Hervey and Leahy
at his hand, he has advisory council
that is not equaled In any state of
which we know, and the results of
their association will be deeply bene
ficial to the peop of New Mexico."
TAFT STOCK IS GOOD.
The opposition to the nomination of
Secretary William H. Taft as the Re
publican candidate for tho presidency
is bringing to the front all sorts of
fairy tales to show that he ha3 no
chance for tho nomination. They
quote history to show that no man
ever went from the U. S. Senate
to the White House, no one ever suc
ceeded in the election to the
presidency from the vice presi
dency, and that no man was ever nom
inated who did not have his own state
delegation solidly behind him. They
ignore the many precedents on the
other side." Certainly Roosevelt went
from the vice presidency to the presi
dency and Garfield and Harrison from
the U. S. Senate to the executive of
fice. In 1892 Cleveland was nominat
ed by the Democracy against the solid
opposition of the party in his state
and he was elected. In 1888 the Indi
ana delegation was in part strongly
for Judge Gresham, and, at first, did
not favor Harrison. In 1880, the Ohio
delegates when the convention assem
bled had no thought of nominating
Garfield.
Tho Taft opposers are too san
guine and take too much for granted.
Secretary Taft may not have tho solid
Onio delegation next June but that he
will have a large majority of the dole
gates from the Buckeye state favor
his candidacy is too well established
even at this early date to be suc
cessfully gainsaid. U. S. Senator J.
B. Foraker, his opposer, Is a very
adroit, skillful and successful politi
cian, who in addition has tho prestige
of being a U. S. Senator and a man
of great wealth, and yet his animosity
to Secretary Taft may not give him
control against the secretary's nomi
nation in the Ohio delegation. Up
to date the supporters of the Taft
movement ought to have good cheer
and great hopes. There is nothing on
the political horizon so far to scare
them in the least respect.
In republishing an article from the
New Mexican in which present condi
tions and the great increase in the
tax valuations of the county as well
as its rapid advance during the year,
1907, are treated the Tucumcarl News
voices its opinion of the work of this
newspaper in good vigorous English
and tells the truth concerning the
course of the New Mexican not only
for Quay county but also for the en
tire territory. Says the News:
"These figures are compiled by the
Santa Fe New Mexican, the paper of
New Mexico that always makes the
Interests of the territory its own!
The New Mexican spares no trouble
or expense to always say good things
about Quay county."
