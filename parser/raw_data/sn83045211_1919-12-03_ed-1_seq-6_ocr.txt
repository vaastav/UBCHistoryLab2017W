Jlr, !'n". chni-gi'd that rpiiivp gov
ernment expenditures were "the most
vital fnctoi'-" in increasing the cost'of
' HWus nod 't-gued that It wn mgent'r
lercK..if tr Keen down public expenses
fAr this lfnson ns well as because of
the drain on the t-ixpavers.
Against Excess Profits Tax
The present revenue laws need revis
ing to meet new conditions, he said, lie
referred particularly to the excess
profits tax laws as being "objectionable
even as a wartime expedient " It wvi
be still more objectionable in ncncetlni" '
he added. "Less harmful forms" of
deriving funds for the government
should be mployed. the secrptnrv said,
adding that the excess profits tax had
been responsible for much of the
crease in living costs because it had
been passed on to the consumer.
"It encourages wastefu1 expenditures,
puts n premium on overcapitalization
and a penalty on brains," the secietary
continued "It discourages new en
lures nnd new enternriset. and estab
lishes old cutures in their monopolies.
In man. instances, it acts as a con
sumption tax. is added to the cost of
production upon which profits are
figured, ditennining prices. It hns
been, an 1' will so long ns it remains on
the statute boohs, continue to be a
material factor in the increased cost of
living."
Mr. Glass also urged redrafting of
the revenue Inws to prevent the evasion
of federnl taxes through the investment
of wealth in the obligations of states
and municipalities. He snid laws should
be enacted which would compel the re
porting of such incomes, although thev
are wholly tax exempt, and that that
sum with other income of nn individual
should be computed as the basis for as
sessing federal taxes on the nniouut de
rived from taxable sources.
Europe's Needs Exaggerated
Relations between conditions in Tu
ropc and those in the I'liited States
xverc discussed also by Mr. Glass, lie
, Bald that, undoubtedly, there was a verv
great need in Europe for financial as
fdstancc, but that the situation had
been much exaggerated.
''We must all feel deep sjmpalhy for
Kurope today," he said, "but a must
I not allow our sympathy to waip our
Judgment and, by exaggerating Euro
pean financial needs, make them more
difficult to fill. The problem
of financing Europe belongs largely f
the exporter because industries cannot
be reopened without raw stocks. Gov
ernment financial assistance in the pat
and talk of future government or bank
inp aid to finance exports have appar
ently led our industrial coucerns to the
erroneous expectation that their war
profits, based largely on exports, will
continue indefinitely without any risk
on their pait To them will full the
profits of experts and upon them will
fall the consequence of failure to make
the exports."
The Treasury will continue its pol
icy, in effect since the armistice, to re
store private initiative nnd remove gov-
, ernmental contiol and interference
with respect to the nation's foreign
trade, Mr. Glass said. Only through
thl means, he argued, could a "liealtln
economic life be gained." He added that
removal of any influence by the govern-
'' ment should provide the incentive for
American commerce to go into the world
markets and establish itself.
.Ratification of the peace treaty will
measurably stimulate export trade, Mr.
' Glass declared, because operation of the
pact 'would eliminate numerous politi
cal risks nnd provide u surer invest -ment
basis. lt ...
Closely related to any activities of
the covcrnment in foreign trade is the
aubject of incorporated government
agencies, withdrawal of wliicti Mr.
Glass strongly urged. He Baid their
'manifest weaknesses" were pioof suf
ficient that such arrangements were
bot happy ones for the government nor
for the persons charged with adminis
tration of the corporation. While not
Baying that any of the agencies, created
during the emergencies of war, had
s ,been guilty of wastefulness, Mr. Glass
pointed out that there was no objective,
guch as business profits, to hold cxpeu
rHfrpq down. On the other hand,
officer managing the agencies operate
on a. capital lor wmen mere is no nc
..niintnlillttv or check and always have
access to more funds if a real need
exists. Cases where government funds
are employed semi -independently, air.
""V Glass declared, "largely justified gov
ernment red tape in accounting."
sjieturning to the estimated govern -
Bjnt expenditures for the hsral year
ending June 30. 1021, Mr. Glass said
the military establishment would ask
nnnronrlations aggregating $080,578,-
ftfrr. Of this sum. SS07.302.000 would
be required, ne saw, ior maintenance
the, army proper, while $85,40S,000
would be apportioned to the national

receive $0,778,037.
For the navy, the appropriation of

Failure of Hitchcock to See
President Furnishes Fuel
for Rumor Factory
DEFINITE STATEMENT SOON
lly CLINTON W. GILI1EKT
Stnff ( orrrMMjnclent ef the Klfnlnff Tnlillc
Twicer
Wushliiglon, Dec. 3. The Presi
dent's illness Is again agitating Wash
ington The Senate, especially the Re
publican side of it, is biiHV suggesting
that the 1'iesident is Incapacitated at
present, many senators declining cs
terdin that the President did not write
his la-it message to Congress.
Several circumstances have con
tributed to this new outbreak of rumois.
Tor o'i thing the President V recovery
' "s been etttemeh slow. Th -n too,
there lnve been no official bulletins in
mnn weeks. TIhko bulletins were
stopped because there was virtually no
hangi! in the President's condition from
dm to da. and so toe daily announce-
j nients weie meaningless.
I Then failure of Senator Illlchcoek to
seetivo an appointment v ith the I'resi
i dent on Satuiday started the story that
Sir. Wilson was worse The attitude
I of those who surrounded the President
I adds to the uiniors.
, Quest ions about the Picsident'n actual
I condition piouike resentment. The ini
jp'icition is that speculations us to the
President's health are prompted bv
I utilities i1 ml not b a legitimate in
! terest of the public in the chief of the
nation.
I I he Pieslilent's friends allow the
irmnois to grow and grow until a denial
Negro Colonel Gets Llberlan Post of them can no longer be avoided, and
Washington, Deo. 3. (1? A. P.) then some statement is issued which
Colonel Chillies Young, letired, " tho I tt'iitla to sot them at rest. That point
onlv negro army ollicer to attain that ' ip being rint hed again. Some formal
lank, has been selected as military at- ' "tntcment about the Piesldent's condi
aehe to Libetm nt the lequest n'f the ' tion uuinot be mucli lunger delajed.
'Mean republic. Some jeurs ago As to the President's actual condition
Colonel louug oiganizcd the military it is difficult to obtain nnvthiug more
establishment of I.ibeiia than indications. The fuilme to see
Senator Hitchcock was without signifi
cance, Hitchcock's relations with the
President are complicated by the con-.
test over the Senate leadership.
Neither he nor Senator t nderwood
can go to the White House without
starting rumors that the White House
Is favoring one or the other In the Sen
ate contest. Beneath the surface some
obscure maneuvering is going on to get
each on the front page of the newspapers
or to keep one or the other off that
page. This situation in some way con
tributed either to the announcement
that the President hail summoned Mr.
Illchcock or else to bis failure to ob
tain an appointment. The Piesidcnt
did sec Secretary linker on Sunday, just
before the secretary's departure for
Panama. This was the day after the
failure of Mr Hitchcock to see him. It
should set at rest the storj that the
President had suffered n i elapse nnd
become once more unable to lecehe
visitors.
Thoie is another little fairly well
authenticated story which indlciites the
President's activity and capacity.j,Mrs.
WiKon showed a friend nt the White
House a mil's of stenographic notes
which she sins the President had pre
pared as memoranda on some Subject
upon which he was working. These,
notes were described by the person who
saw them as pcifcctlj clear and well
formed.
"Impertinent" and Peislstent
If this story is true, unci theie is no
reason to doubt it. it should dispose
of the rumor that Mr. Wilson is par
alzctl in his light hand Een accept
ing the story that the President inn
sign his name with his left bund, per
haps invented by some one to account
for his undisputed signature-, to docu
ments, it is not to be supposed that he
can write stenographic clianieters with
his left hand, nor for that matter with
a light hand which bus been recently
paralyzed.
Theso two circumstances to show how
slim is the evidence reg.uiling the Pres
ident's actual condition. If ou nsk,
you lire told stories like the foregoing,
but nnything more definite is icfuscd.
It may be simply that those who sur
round the President nie unable to un
derstand the public point of view and
regard his illness ns a prhute matter
regarding which everjbody is some
what impertinent.
Or it may be that they are so clear
In their own minds about his condition
that they cannot understand the doubt
and confusion existing thioughout the
country.
This much may be confidently ns-
sertcd, the bralu of tho President Is
perfectly clear. His mind functions
ns clearly as ever It did, but his nerv
ous condition is such that not much
mental work can be done by him. The
quality of his mental operations Is as
good as ever, the quantity of them has
to be restricted. And it is almost
equally sure that the President has suf
feied no such paraljsls as would be ap
parent in speaking, in his face, or iu
the use of his right hand.
It may be accepted as true bejonil
doubt that the President is incntnllt
capable of performing the duties of his
.office, but that iu the ititerests of his
recovery he is forbidden by his phy
sicians from performing nny of them
thnt it Is not absolutely necessary for
him persoiialb to do.
TliciP is little doubt that he did not
write tho message. You can not obtain
a definite: statement from any one that
ho did or did not. but the evidence Is
sufficient that the message was put to
gether from the lecommendations of
various cabinet officers. It is not like
ly that ho. President's physicians would
permit him to write a long message such
as that.
It was not necessary for him to per
form this labor. The usual Presi
dent's message for many jcars has been
nut together much as this one was. And
Doctor Gfa-.sou would naturally insist
that the President should avoid this
labor. The fniiiire to write the message
is not significant. The Republican sen
ators nre playing small personal politics
in insisting upon it in public statements
ns impiutnnt.
Is Still "a Very Sick Man"
Doctor Grayson said to me p few
dns ago tl)af the "
a very sick man and would be so for a
long time." Physicians do not allow
"very sick men'' to Indulge in pro
tracted mrntnl labor, when that labor
cap be avoided.
12ven though he did not write It, the
message Is the President's, read, ap
proved and signed by him.
Cabinet Regal as Powers
In the Mime way the President Is not
being consulted upon the Mexican situ
ation. Tho probability is that he is
cognizant of tho difficulty with Mexico
and if Secretary Lansing's handling of
it for he reads the newstia'iers nnd hns
them read to him. Rut Mr. Lansing
is now really secretary of state, just ns
the other cabinet officers arc now the
real heads of their departments. The
United States has. In effert. n commis
sion form of government. Secietnrics
who ncer could take a step without
consulting tho President feel very in
dependent now.
The President is nervous nnd excit
able, especially on the subject of the
treaty, absorption in which broke him
down. Ho is improving, but very slowly.
Wc have no longer a one-mnu gov
ernment and the very persons who once
were angry because we had a one-man
government nre now angry because It
hns censed to be one.

When we were approached with the offer to buy out
right for cash a warehouseful of skins, we were astonianed
that any big fur skin merchant would so sacrifice his stocks
' (at the sacrifice of his season's profits). But it was not our
business to inquire when the goods were there and we had the
