OPPOSED TO NORMALS
The editor of the Advocate publish
ed at Richmond in Ray county says
that Captain Fams member of the
legislature from that county will op
pose appropriations of the state funds
to our Normal Schools He alsofavois
the abolition of the ofiics of State
School Superintendent Friends of
the Normal Schools would do well to
bear this in mind and keep an eye on
Captain Farris this winter
LIGHT LITERATURE
A contributor in last issue of the
Graphic entered a very earnest plea
tor what is known as light literature
but there are points on which he failed
to touch Admitting all that the writer
claims that a boy who has the in
grained devilishness in his nature suffi
cient to make a thef desperado or
rowdy will find means to develope the
predominating traits of his character
whether he reads a dime novel or a
dictionary still there is one feature
common to all so called light literature
which the writer does not notice It is
this A continuous course of novel
reading acts on the young mind some
what similar to a steady diet of cakes
puddings and sweetmeats Mental
dyspepsia sets in and a distaste for
plain mental food is the result The
memory becomes treacherous the
mind weakened and the judgement in
some cases distorted Excess in any
thing is dangerous and unless guided
by moderation both as to quantity and
quality it is especially strong in this
one direction The works of AValter
Scott Irving Goldsmith Charles
Reade Dickens Eggleston and others
of that class can hardly be compared
with the blood and thunder Jesse
James and Claud Duval style of fiction
Indeed we know of one who was cured
of a taste lor the blood and thunder
trash by one reading of the Waverly
novels and has never had patwnce to
sit down to that kind of food sin ce
The Graphic believes that as inmost
other questions truth lies between the
two extremes of opinion on this matter
DOTV
There are two kinds of content
Without one or the other any life how
ever successful in a pecuniary way
will be a failure The kind of content
however which is rather to be avoided
than desired is that lazy content which
satisfied with to day makes no prov
sion lor the future It comes properly
under the head of shiftlessness and is
more common further south where the
elements are more kindly and the fiat
work or freeze strive or starve is of
less force But the content which
accepts present conditions cheerfully
yet couples ambition and duty there
with is a happy faculty to be cultivat
ed and cherished by the posessor
Speaking of this subject the Fireside
Journal says Many people spend
their lives in hunting for a place in the
world that they were never intended to
fill They never settle down to any
thing with a contented feeling or feel
that what they are doing is by any
means work suited to their abilities
They have a sunny ideal of a very noble
life which they would like to reach in
which their power would have free scope
where they could make a very bright
record but in their present position
their life is but a humdrum prosy out
line in which they can accomplish
nothing worthy or beautiful and there
fore it is of little use to try So they
go on discontented with their lot and
sighing for something else and while
they sigh the years glide by and they
find at the end they have missed every
opportunity of doing anything worthy
themselves The truth is ones voca
tion is not some far off possibility but
the simple round of duties that the
passing hour brings No day is com
monplace if we only had eves to see its
splendor There is no duty that comes
to our hand but brings us the possibili
ty of kingly service
A new scientific work entitled
Problem of Human Life is creating
quite a stir among people interested in
scientific literary and religious topics
It seems that the Professors of Prince
ton college at the head of which is the
venerable and learned Dr McCosh do
not take the same view of the work
that many others do Prof McCloskie
who it is presumed speaks for the facul
ty and with the knowledge and appro
bation of Dr McCosh says It is be
cause we value our precious religion
that we notice a book which defends it
with the weapons of ignorance and
reckless speculation and which is so
plausible as to have secured the en
dorsement of editors clergymea and
teachers of science We understand
the book has met with a large sale in
Kirksville and is endorsed by some of
our leading local scientists

Did yon ever think that cutting
down your expenses just one cent a day
will keep your family well supplied
with pood newspapers the year rcund
yet how many well to do people there
are who imagine they cant afford a
good paper oi magazine because the
times aretso tight
the Christmas st Nicholas
The great holiday number conies la
den with its seasonable freight of mirth
and good cheer and chiefest among its
special feature is a Christmas story by
Louisa ST Alcott entitled Grand-
mammas Pearls
Other timely features are first the
bright colored frontispice by R B
Birch a snow scene with children
pony and dogs and an unmistakable
Christmas flavor TLen there is a
graphic ace ount of a long dog sledge
journey on Lake Winnipeg capitally
illustrated by Farny a Uhrisnias poem
by Nora Perry and a clever short story
The Cbistmas Faries that is a true
story as well Malcolm Douglass con
tributes a pathetic little Christmas tale
and two pages are given to the words
and music of a simple but tuneful
Christmas Carol
Besides the foregoing there is much
that is not a whit less attractive just
because it does not happen to be more
appropriate to Christmas than to any
and every season The beginning of
The Story of the Field of th Cloth ot
Gold for instance a charming tale
weaving in most delightfully the
principal incidents of the famous meet
ing of the Kings in the GoldVn Valley
Mary and her Garden a six page
poem written by Eva L Ogden en
grossed and beautifully illustrated by
Alfred Brennan which deals with
some little known adventures of con
trary Mary An amusing Al
phabet of Children with a picture
for eacn letter A quaint and
highly original fairy tale by
Frank R Stockton who also con
tributes another installment of The
Story of Viteau
J T Trowbridges serial The Tink
hani Brothers Tide mill is alse con
tinued with three chapters of accumu
lating interest
In addition to all this is an article on
whale hunting in Japan by William
Elliot Griffis and The Discovery of
the Mammoth oy C F Holder with
a startling picture by James C Beard
Among the good gifts that Decem
ber brings us is Demorests Monthly
Magazine The Christmas number
is replete with suitable articles for the
season well written and of a highly
interesting character Mrs Alexander
the popular English novelist continues
her story The Admirals Ward and
the shorter stories are well worth read
ing All the Christmas articles are
usually good including Jennie Junes
Christmas Sermon in her Talks
with Women The article on Home
Art and Home Comfort will give the
ladies some good hints and Current
Topics are as usual full of interest
The Kitchen has not been forgotten
and the Fashions are carefully attend
ed to Among the poems is A Christ
mas Dream by Margaret Sangster
beautifully illustrated The art depart
ment embraces a charming oil picture
of a German lady of the sixteenth cen
tury two fine steel engravings and a
great variety of other illustrations On
the whole the Christmas number of
Demorests Monthly Magazine is a
decided buccess and cannot fails to
give pleasure to its readers
Ike Mississippi
Some interesting and extraordinary
data have just been compiled respect
ing the Mississippi It appears that it
boasts no fewer than 55 tributary
streams with a total length of naviga
tion of 16571 miles or about two-
thirds of the distance round the world
Even this however represents but a
small amount ot the navigation which
follow when the Federal Government
has made the contemplated improve
ments in the Upper Mississippi in the
Minnesota Wisconsin and other rivers
in which it is now engaged But while
the Mississippi has 16571 miles navi
gable to steamboats it has 20221

KASHIMITON LETTER
From Oitr Regular Correspondent
Washington D C Dec 7 1882
There was a slim atteudance of
Representatives at the opening of Con
gress on Monday the slightest I have
seen in my eight years observation
here The laggards are always numer
ous at the beginning of a session in
years when there is no speakership to
settle but what tt was that kept such
an unusual number behind this year
can hardly be explained unless Speak
er Keifers ruling that 11 o clock should
be the hour was too much for them
People who work from sunrise to sun
set will have some difficulty in com
prehending the tardiness of a Congress
man who finds 11 or even 12 oclock
too early for him to be in his seat but
there are many of them The greet
ings among members of both parties
were unusually cordial The cheerful
ness of the day appeared to dwell on
the democratic side as they discussed
what they would do in the next Con
gress Every one was curious to note
the demeanor of the defeated members
who were represented in such large
numbers upon the floor Robeson
upon whom the eyes of the gallery were
often centered was very active going
about among his colleague and no
one would have inferred from his man
ner that he is an intensely disappointed
man He did not extend many of his
calls to the democratic side probably
because of the jokes and chaffing he
met with there Much of the talk
among members on the republican side
was made up of explanations by those
who had been defeated for re election
of the peculiar cause which led to that
result Jay Hubbell was one of the
absentees In running over the repub
lican side the figures most sought after
by the galleries were the diplomatic
and courtly
On the Senate side of the canitol the
change of pleasant greeting compari
son of notes about the past falls cam
paign and other subjects keDt up a
perfect buzz of conversation in the
chamber As is usual on the first day
ot a session everybody was in good
humor The chamber with the hand
some new carpet lately laid new chairs
and desks freshly varnished wore a
bright and cleanly appearance Some
of the desks were decorated with floral
tributes which added to the pleasant
surroundings Senator Voorhees was
the lavorite among the senders ot bou
quet He had no less than three on
his desk Mr Logans desk was al
most covered with a bank of flowers
having his initials in blue set in a sur
rounding of white flowers Senatots
Ingalls and Lnpham were also the re
cipients of tributes of this kind Don
Cameron appears alittle stern just now
A prominent newspaper correspondent
went to him just after the Senate met
on Monday and asked him what he
thought of the appointment of his ene
my Clayton McMichael as United
States Marshall for the District of Col
umbia
The ex proprietor of Pennsylvania
nearly jumped out of his chair as this
proved the first intimation he had of
of the news He said he had not read
the morning paper and could scarcely
credit it Mr McMichael he said had
never been more than a half-and-half
Republican and had always opposed
him This was all Mr Cameron
would say but he immediately called
General Logan aside and began whis
pering to him with much earnestness
which was interpreted as evidence that
Mr McMicheal would not find plain
sailing in his path to confirmation
As the result ot conversations with
several members of Congress of both
parties I find that both sides seem
moved by a desire to proceed prompt
ly with the work in hand attend strict
ly to business and make good use of
their limited time and talents The
Presidents message was received here
with varying degrees of criticism and
approval but the preponderance of
entiment is that while it does not rank
as one of the ablest of state papers it
was nevertheless constructed with a
great deal of shrewdness so as to touch
a popular chord upon all the various
questions concerning which the people
have lately expressed themselves and
to steal away from the Democrats a
good deal of their loudest thunder
There was not the usual experience of
printing the message all over the coun
try before it was sent to Congress A
rumor was current in newspaper Row
Saturday night that a copy of the mess
age had been procurred and was for
sale to correspondents desiring it One
or two I believe were taken in by this
bogus copy but when President Arthur
heard the rumor he sent word hat he
wouia nice 10 get a copy mmseii as nis
own message was not yet finished and
this might save him all furthei trouble
Though the Garfield Monument Fair
was not financially a success it devel
oped a number of amusing incidents
One was the development of Congress
man Houck of Tennessee and one
Wiggins of somewhere as Presidential
candidates A gold watch was voted
to the most popular candidate ard in
spite of the fact that votes were cast
for more than twenty five candidates
among whom were such well known
names as James G Blaine Samuel J
Tilden and Dr Mary E Walker the
friends of Houck and Wiggins fairly
astonished themselves by the strength
they were found to possess But
Houck carried off the election
The President will take a hand in
the social festivities this season which
will be opened with the New Years
reception at the White House Hav
ing a good deal of pride about doing
such things correctly and brilliantly it
is probable that the round of recep
tions and dinners will be in keeping
with the predictions for an unusally
brilliant season List winter while
the President was writing his commu
nications to Congress and his notes to
personal friends on paper deeply bord
ered with morning it was proper that a
degree of restraint should be observed
at the Executive Mansion The season
of official mourning was long ago end
ed and the occasion for it has faded
from the memory of most people here
In preparation for the fitting reeeption
of guests at the White House the in
terior has been improved The scaf
folding are still up in the halls and ves
tibule but the work of decorators will
be completed in a few days

One of the hardest of all business
enterprises is the publishing of a news
paper It is not necessarily so hard
but is made so by he carelessness to
use a very moderate term of the sub
scribers in settling their accounts Men
who will promptly pay other bills wdl
neglect or refuse to pay for their paper
The newspaper business is not such a
bonanza that the publishers can afford
to furnish the paper for nothing or wait
years for hard earned pay If a paper
ever misses tne subscriber the pub
lisher is sure to hear of it but in many
cases he may wait until his locks whiten
with age before the subscriber will
come around manfully and discharge
his part of the obligation We pre
sume many who intend to pay neglect
it until the amount runs up so large
that it frightens tbem The part of an
honorable man is if he cannot pay the
whole amount at once to pay what he
can from time to time and thus reduce
the amount until it all settled Chi
