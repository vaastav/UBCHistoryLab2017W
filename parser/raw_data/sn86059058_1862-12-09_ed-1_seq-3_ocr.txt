Other business of minor importance
was transacted, when Stevens ottered a
aeries of resolutions, referring the vari
ous parts of the President's message to
tee appropriate committees.

l)oolittle said he understood that in sll
cases of arrest, liberty had been offered
if the persons arrested would take the
oath of alleigance.
fie would like to have the resolution
lie over.y j
Saulsbury said be bad referred to these
two persons becnuse he had never heard
any charge against them.
They bad been arrested iu a loyal
State, and for uo offence whatever.
Peaceable citizens in Delaware and
Marylaud, had been arrested and drag
ged from their homes, and he thought
they had at least the right to enquire
into the matter. There was no disposi
tion to ogpose the government at all.
After discussion the President an
nounced the special order to be the bank
rupt act, which was informally laid over.
T'essenden from the Committee on Fi
nance, reported a bill concerning judg
ment on certain suits brought by the

passed.
The Bankrnnt bill was taken np and
postponed until Thursday, the lth, and
made the special order for that day.

ed thnt the Committee on Indian affairs

ing the Secretary of War to report to the
S nate the number and rank of aides-de
camp appointed under Act of Congress
of August, ISO, and also the number
and rank of those drawing pay and not
in active service. Adopted.
Stevens introduced a bill to indemnify
President iincoln and others tor sus
pending the writ of habeas corpus, and
for all acts done in pursuance thereof.
The bill is the same as that offered
last week.
Vallandigham objected to reading the
bill the third time. Therefore, under the
rule, the question recurred, " Shall the
bill be rejected?" The House refused
to reject 34 against 90.
The bill was then read a second time
Stevens mored to postpone the fur
ther consideration of the bill to next
Tuesday, and to make it the special
order for that day.
Vallandigham objected.
Cox desired to refer it to the Judiciary
Committee.
Stevens then asked that the bill should
be put on its passage.
rl be main question was ordered 83
against 47.
Olia expressed surprise that any ob.
jeetion should be made to the postpone
ment when an opportunity for its discus
I sion could be afforded. If postponed
until Thursday, it could be exurainad
with care and wisdom, which the House
' could bring to bear upon the subject.
What he objected to especially was
that a measure of such great impor
' tance, and upon which there was such a
diversity of opinion, should he so hurri
edly thrust through the House.
The Pretddeut had authority by law to
exercise all the power he had exercised
";' in regard to Habeas Corpus. He cou
curred with the gen leman from Penn
sylvania (Stevens) that a bill of this
character was proper. But while thus
concurred, he should regret to see the
bill hurried through the House without
ten members knowing its legal provis
ions. It was discreditable to the House and
country, and h should feel ashamed to
return to his constituents and say that
Congress had passed an act without per
mitting p. word yea or nay to be said on
the sulrject
He hoped, for the credit of the House
and country, that the matter would be
postponed.
Vnllandigham said he had objected
only to the bill being made the special
order.
Colfax differed from Olin. He said ho
did not think the immediate passage of
the bill vonld be discreditable to the
House. Instead of this it would be
creditable.
This question had been discussed all
over the bind, as to whether the Presi
dent had the power to suspend the writ
of habeas corpus during the rebellion.
He stood ready to vote for the bill to in
demnify him.
Ho hoped that it would pass at once.
Stevens was about addressing the House
on the subject, when Vallandigham raised
a question that Stevens had no right un
der the rules to do so.
Stevens asked three minutes to ex
plain. Mr. V. objected unless others have a
similas privilege.
Holman moved to lay the bill on the
table. Not carried 4;") to 78.
Stevens explained that it was not his
intention to put the bill on its passage,
but Ootponement was prevcted.
Thomas of Mass., desired an amend
ment in order that those who had been
illegally imprisoned might have their
remedy.
Stevens, in further explanation, said
he doubted the pewer of the President to
suspend habeas corpus, except from ab
solute necessity during the recess. He
held that Congress had sovereign power,
not the President.
He had carefully copied the bill from
precedents of the English parliament for
the lrst two centuries, not adding a word
except what was necessary under the
present circumstances of the country.
The President was justified in exer
cising the power at the time of onr ex
treme peril, when traitors were found in
nearly every household and township
North and South. The bill passed J0
against 45.

New York, Dec. 7. The Herald savs
the Navv Department has received re
liable information of the whereabonts of
the pirate Alabama. The Vanderbilt
ails to-day or to-morrow to look after
her.
The Herald has a Harper's Ferry dis
patch stating that General Geary, with

d,dUU l nr.um y , pieces oi artillery anu
500 cavalrv, marched upon Winchester
on the 3d, and demanded its surrender,
which was complied with, the people ex
hibiting many signs of joy at their ar
rival. He reports General Slocum as having
left Harper's Ferry on the 1st. He met
the enemy's cavalry under White, Hen
derson and Bailyat Charlestown, routing
them and marching into Berryville.
The same evening he again met the
enemy, drew him into a trap and killed
five and wounded 18.
The same evening he bivouaced three
miles beyond Berryville.
The next day he advanced beyond
Oquoqnon. skirmishing with the rebel
cavalry, and bivouaced in Ark Hollow,
between Berryville ahd Winchester.
Our troops captured 100 horses and
mules and several wagon loads of flour
belonging to the rebel army.
At Winchester they also took twenty
five rebels, who were paroled. Seventy
five conscripts claimed protection, which
was granted. Five of our own prisoners
were released. Gen. Geary then, in pur
suance of orders, returned to Harper's
Ferrv, though large deputations of citi
zens begged him to remain. Our only
loss was one man slightly wounded.
A special Washington dispatch of the
6th to the Times says: Certificates of
$.)0,000 each, to the amount of two and
a half millions of dollars, have been
stolen from Treasurer Spinner's desk.
Fortunately, they were unsigned. Meas
ures were taken to prevent engraving
any more of the snme kind.

Blockade off Wilmington, N. C, )
December 1. )
A schooner this morning attempted to
run the blockade at New lulet, but was
chased ashore by the United States
steamers Mt Vernon and Cambridge
and soon destroyed. About 8 A. M. the
Cambridge returned with the schoouer
Emma 1 uttle of Nassau, also trying to
run the blockade.
At noon the steamer Brilliant of Nas
sau, was chased by the United States
steamers Daylight and Mt. Vernon,
thus making three vessels lost to the
rebels in one day. Tail is the eighth
vessel either captured or destroyed by
the Cambridge, Mt. Vernon and Daylight
within thirty days.

army.
Stuart's cavalry is on this side the
Rappahannock operating between the
positions of Sigt-l's corps and Burnside's

Denotation Among the Rebels.
New York, Dec. 8. The following dis
patches are published to-day:
Army ok the Potomac. Dec. 7. A la
dy who came over the river yesterday
under a flag of truce, represents the con
dition ol'the rebel army as destitute be
yond description, and that they cannot
possiblv maintain their position during
the winter. Quite one-third of the array
are without shoes, and hundreds almost
wholly without clothing.
Hard work on intrenchments, insuffi
ciency of food, scarcity of clothing are
sending regiment after regiment to the
hospital.
Many citizens of Fredericksburg, men,
women and children, are encamped in the
woods back of the city and dare not re
turn for fear of being shelled from their
houses.
The rebel enmp fires have almost en
tirely disappeared immediately in front
of Falmouth, and no troops can be seen
behind many of the entrenchments. Not
withstanding all these indications the
fords and weak places of the lines are
strongly guarded opposite Fredericks
burg. The weather is intensely cold
with three inches of snow, and the
ground frozen hard.
There is no army news that can be
telegraphed.
Part
of Bnrnslde's Army across the
Potomac.
New York, Dec. 8. The Tribune says: j
Although we have no news of importance
from the Army of the Potomac by tele
graph, it can do no harm to repeat an
announcement made in a Washington
paper on Saturday, and doubtless already j
in Richmond, that a portion of the army
had probably crossed the Rappahannock
at Port Roval.
Rebels Stirring about Wilmingion-
Nf.wberx, Dec. 4. From information
received through what is deemed a relia
ble source, we learn that the rebels of
late have become suddenly and unusu
ally active in and about Wilmington.
They are mining the roads leading to
the city from Topsail Inlet
In W'ilmington the rebels are actively
engaged in moving heavy gnus. Whether
these guns are being moved out of town
with a view of the evacuation of eastern
North Carolina, or to new positions or
fortifications, we don't know.
Cold Ntglits on the Rappahannock.
Headquarters Army of the Potomac,
Near Falmouth, Va.,
November 7.
Last night was intensely cold, and
some of the troops Ruil'ered for want of
blankets. Ice formed in the Potomac !
at Acouia Creek. To-duv the sun came i
out bright and cheerily, but the air coi.
tinues cold. The roads are hard and
very rough.
Deserters state that Jackson had ar
rived near Fredericksburg and joined
bis forces to those already there. They
also report that the enemy has extended
his lines several miles farther down the
Rappahannock.
The report that Major Spaulding is
under arrest for unnecessary delay in
the transportation of the pontoon train
from Washington is unfounded. That
otfieer has been commended by his supe
rior officers for having overcome weighty
obstacles in executing his orders.
There have been no field movements
t o-day.
Heavy on Senator Carlisle.
Wheelixg, Va., December 6. The
State Senate to-day passed a preamble
and resolution setting forth that Mr.
Carlisle had violated the instructions of
the body that elected him in failing to
sustain the legitimate efforts of the Gov
ernment to suppress rebellion, in oppos
ing by his vote and speeches in and out
of the United States Senate measures ab
solutely necessary to the preservation of
the Union and enforcement of the laws,
and in opposing the admission of the
new State of W estern Virginia into the
Union, and requesting him to resign his
seat. The resolution will come up in the
House on Monday, and will probably pass
by a large majority.
In the House to-day a resolution was
offered requesting the U. S. House of
Representatives to pass the U. S. Senate
bill now pending before it, without alter
ation or amendment.
It wiil come up on Monday, and will
pass by an almost unanimous vote.
Gov. Pierpont endorses the President's
emancipation policy.
Washington fos?lp.
Washington, Dec. 7. Mr. Steven's
resolution denouncing as guilty of a high
crime any person in the Executive or
Legislative branch of the Government
who shall propose to make peace or ac
cept or advocate the acceptance of any
such proposition on any other basis than
the integrity and entire unity of the
United States ahd Territories as they ex
isted at the time of the rebellion, the con
sideration of which was postponed until
Tuesday a week, will be fully discussed,
as several are already preparing to speak
on the subject This resolution is not
supposed to be aimed at the Administra
tion, as its policy is known to be that
no peace is admissible at the cost of a
single acre of the Union.
1 he resolution ot allandigham, pro
posing "-a Convention bv the States,
which is pending from last session, will
soon come up for consideration in the

Union officers, and makes a very pa
