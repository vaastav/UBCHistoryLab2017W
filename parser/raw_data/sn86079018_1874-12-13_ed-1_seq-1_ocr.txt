THE MODEBN INQUISITION.
Whe n the Republican, the organ of organ
ized plunder, gets thoroughly wanned up to
its work, it can put in some of the heaviest
sort ot misrepresentation. Its capacity for
maligning the people of the South is simply
enormons, and it is never so happy as when
it is engaged in circulating statements that
nre not only untrue, Voit so absolutely false
as to make it a matter for special wonder how
men wfio have lived among us for years can
calmly sit down and endeavor to permanent
ly injure those who have never wronged
them. It can cram more malice and unchar
itubleness into a brief paragraph than all the
other Republican journals in the country put
together, and it is a maddening reflection
that the men who write in this way, the men
who dip their pens in gall whenever they
write about the South, do not and cannot be
lieve what they would have their friends in
the North accept as gospel.
The follow ing is an instance of the Repub
licans savagery and unfairness :
The White Leaguer haa sworn in his wrath
that though the negro may demand and collect
pay for lus work, he shall never rote in peace,
unless it be as a reinforcement to the parly
whose candidates are always of one race, while
the old Last Di' cher, the unconverted Bourbon,
the uuconquered secessionist, never has and
never will forgive any one who had any agency
in depriving him of his slaves. For years this
hostility has been latent or passive, but never
crushed out. Every report of a Democratic vic
tory at the North brings out smiling thousands
of waiters aud watchers in the South to congrat
ulate each other upon the prospects of the tidal
wave, which, like political Messiah, they have
waited for these many years.
This is scandalous. There is not a syllable
of it that is true, and either the person who
wrote must have known that it was untrue,
or he has become unable to distinguish right
from wrong, truth from falsehood.
In regard to the allusion about the White
League, nothing could be more unfair or un
just. It is not the members of the White
League who intimidate the negro; it is not
they who threaten the negro; but, strangely
enough, it is the Radicals, white and black,
who have inaugurated a reign of terror in
this State, which, to those unfamiliar with
the facts, would seem to be incredible. It is
a /act that not only in this city and through
out the country parishes, it is as much as a
negro's life is worth to vote any other than
the straight Radical ticket. On election day
a poor ignorant but brave negro came hob
bling into this office and told us he liad just
been shot through the foot by another negro,
localise he had dared to vote the Democratic
ticket.
Several colored men came round to get
white escorts to conduct them to the polls for
protection, and declared they had been
threatened by L ading Radical negroes with
death if they failed to vote the Radical ticket.
This intimidation unquestionably prevented
several thousand negroes in this city alone
from voting with the Conservatives last elec
tion, anil in the country it was much worse.
There the common lield hands are victims of
horrible superstitions, and they regard the
President as a sort of god, to offend whom is
to niärit condign punishment. Their super
stitions and their fears are all wrought upon
in the most artful manner by white and black
demagogues, and the powerful influence of
the church is brought to bear to keep the de
luded and ignorant creatures in line.
So absolute is the fear inspired by the
dreadful threats of torture and of wi*ch
craft that the negro has been afraid to men
tion the subject of politics, or to impart the
actual condition of affairs to their white em
ployers' or to such white men as they had
reason to believe would do them no wron
They are gradually becoming restive under
the lash of their party leaders, and slowly,
Very slowly the light is breaking upon their
benighted visions.
A gentleman, whose name we liave not just
now the authority to use, but whose asser
tions would be accepted thoroughout the
Union as authority, tells us that he has just
returned from a trip through several of the
country parishes, aud everywhere the negroes
would come to him and tell him with every
appearance of abject fear, how they wanted
to act with the white people, as they knew it
was to their interest to do so, but how impos
sible it was for them to escape the vengeance
of their secret societies.
They said, "Massa, we be killed sure ef we
vote tie Demokrackic ticket ' W hat says the
Republican to that ? What say the people of
the North to this dreadful political inquisition,
ns deadly and as all-pervading as that which
has blackened the history of Spain? What
says President Grant to this refutation of
his unwarranted assertion in his last stump
speech, that the negroes voted with the Re
publicans because they knew who their friends
were ?
The Republican is correct when it says there
is and has been intimidation exercised in
Louisiana, but it grossly errs in attributing it
to the White League instead of the Radicals,
black and white.
There is no more crying shame to-day in
this country than the terrorism exercised over
the ignorant negroes of the South by corrupt
white Radical men and negroes, aud the ad
ministration of Grunt lias been especially
conspicuous in maintaining this state of
aff.urs. The President can put an end to this
modem inquisition if he will, and we now
call upon him in all earnestness to see that
the poor negro who lives in momentary fear
of his life, be accorded the
same protection
that he so promptly extends
Bonds and thieves.

NEW ORLEANS.
What a beautiful city, what a charmin
climate ! remarked our recent visitors.
Everything was new to them. Winter, with
its sports and frolics, they left behind, and
found here what seemed to them spring, with
its flowers and foliage. They roved and ram
bled everywhere, plucked the golden orange
from the tree, picked the moss clinging to
the monarch of the forest, the live oak, which
defies time, and ever, with its green leaves,
betokens the vigor of youth ; saw the French
Market, crowded with the fruits and vege
tables of the earth, the fowls of the air and the
fish of the sea, and a population, composed of
all nationalities and speaking all languages—
even the Chinese, the Japanese and the Choc
taw. They all thought and said, this should
be a happy place to live in.
And so it should be. There is no city in
the world which has the natural advantages
of the Crescent City. The Father of Waters
takes its rise far up north, near Lake Super
ior, and in its descent receives tributaries
flowing from the Alleghanies and the Rocky
Mountains, forming valleys unsurpassed in
fertility, and affording navigation for thous
ands of miles. And yet, though nature is
propitious, New Orleans is not what it should
cr ought to be. Laws, bad laws, framed and
passed by bad men, and administered and
xecuted by the worst of the bad, are the
chief, nay, the sole cause of the decline in
the prosperity of the city. To secure the
South to flie support of the Republican party
the infamous reconstruction acts were passed,
and the execution and enforcement of these
acts were intrusted to military satraps who
excluded from the right of suffrage all but
scalawags, carpet-baggers and negroes, and
installed in all offices the worst class of the
North and West, the jackals who followed
the successful march of the Federal forces, to
plunder an overpowered people.
The rule of this class commenced with War
moth and culminated with the usurper Kel
logg. Such laws as the Metropolitan Police,
Election and Registration laws were passed
solely for the purpose of keeping in power
this vast army of plunderers. Schemes of all
kinds were gotten .up with no good intent,
with no good purpose, but only to fleece the
people, and to pay for bonds issued only to
till the coffers of the carpet-bagger. Forty
millions were added to the State and twenty
millions to the city debt, and the people forced
by infamous courts to pay taxes to pay the
interest of this enormous debt, created for no
purpose of utility.
AVe have the same heavens above ns, we
have the same teeming soil and the same de
licious climate which bad men can neither
chaDge nor destroy, and yet we are told that
we are permitted to enjoy the bountiful gifts
of nature, but must be the hewers of wood
and drawers of water to a set of actual thieves ;
that the fields of industry must become a
waste and the great marts of commerce a des
olation. Arc we to submit quietly to such
outrages and indignities ? Is manhood gone ?
Are we the slaves of knaves and political
tricksters ?
AVhen we have natural, inherent rights which
infamous laws cannot annul, andif such laws—
and we have them—are attempted to be en
forced by the unscrupulous usurpers, armed
resistance becomes a necessity—becomes a
virtue—becomes patriotism. Actual sover
eignty is in the people—the people rule—the
people govern—the people, through their
repräsentatives, fairly chosen, adopt their
own government and promulgate their own
laws. This recognized dogma of sovereignty
cannot be destroyed; it may be ignored for a
time, but it will assert itself, peaceably or
forcibly. It cannot be given up—it cannot
be abandoned. This supreme power, this
sovereignty is installed only by the voice of
the people, and when any attempt is made to
strangle this voice, convulsions must follow.
Is not this attempt now being made ? Ere
another year rolls round, visitors then in this
city may well exclaim, with more enthusiasm
than our recent friend, what a glorious place !
what a paradise on earth !—what walks and
drives !—what gardens ! — what flowers and
fruits, and what generous and noble hospi
tality ! Change our laws ; change our rulers
and usurpers ; establish an honest govern
ment, based upon the declared consent of the
governed—then will New Orleans enjoy all
the natural advantages which nature has
given then will it flourish as a grand mart
of commerce, and then will it become a city
worthy of the great river which flows by it.
Remove all oppression ; take off all unjust
burdens ; dismiss all unworthy officers ;
place in position the good and the honest ;
enact wise measures—then will the people be
contented and prosperous, and then will the
ten talents given us be increased an hundred
fold.
" But from the best sources of information at
my command. I have always believed the pres
sent State officers received a majority of the
legal votes cast at that election." Yule Presi
dent Grant's late message to Congress—portion
relating to Louisiana.
Good for Grant. Could Kellogg A Co. ask
for a better friend ? Kellogg never claimed
that he got a majority of " the votes actually
cast at that election ; " he merely suggested
that he would have had a majority if his
friends had voted, and Grant put him in with
bayonets. Now. Grant, seeing that Kellogg's
plea is too thin, comes to his relief by swear
ing that he did not require the strength of
his party vote, but really got a majority of
the votes " actually cast.'* Good for Grant!
" If employment can be given to all labor offer
ing itself, prosperity necessarily follows. "— Vale
President s message.
Let the result of the past fourteen years
answer this silly platitude. Previous to the
fall of 1873 was labor in any country ever so
fully employed as in this, anil .it such high
wages ? Where is the real prosperity ?

DESERTING THE PARTY.
The refusal of the President to station
troops inside the State-House, for the pur
pose of assisting Kellogg and Packard in their
scheme to defraud the people of their Legis
lature, will be a damper -upon the hopes and
expectations of the Radical crew whose chances
for luture power in this State are slim indt ed.
Knowing fall well that the Democratic
party has carried the day ; that it is entitled
to a large majority of the Assembly, and that
the future control of the Government must
inevitably pass into its possession, the Repub
lican leaders can see no salvation for their
party except by the repetition of the outrage
ous frauds that were so successfully practiced
in 1872.
There is no lack of desire on their part and
no restraining sense of jnstice and propriety,
to deter them in prosecuting an y course which
might promise redemption. Bat the fearful
deficiency in power and in moral courage will
induce these desperate adventurers to think
very seriously before they take any step which
will carry with it such great responsibility
and will involve such serious consequences to
themselves.
Their sole hope and reliance then are upon
the United States army. If the troops can be
placed at the disposal of Packard, so that he
can order them to take possession.of the State
House and permit no one to enter the build
ing, except with a pass from him, no one for
a moment doubts that the defeated and routed
Radicals would hesitate an instant to do any
thing that might be required to giv e them the
control of the Legislature.
But without this physical support, this in
terference by the National Government with
a State Legislature, no attempt will be made
by Kellogg to force npon the people a Legis
lature of his own election and choice.
The failure, then of the effort to induce the
President to " anticipate danger," by guard
ing the State-House with troops, must be re
garded as highly significant, and, in fact, it
may be considered as an abandonment of the
Republican party of this State to its own fate,
and its future existence mast depend npon its
own ability to sustain itself, without aid from
the Federal Government.
THE PRESIDENTEN LOUISIANA.
That portion of the President's message
referring to the political condition of this
State, and explaining his interference with its
government, is eliciting from the press of the
country some very sharp comments.
The reasons assigned by Grant for recog
nizing and sustaining the Kellogg usurpation
are so puerile and contemptible that they
are scarcely entitled to any respectable con
sideration. They may be deemed sufficient,
however, by the political and partisan admirers
of the President, to freely justify him in his
conduct toward Louisiana. But the impartial
and intelligent public cannot be imposed upon
by such specious arguments as he has put
forth to explain away one of the most palpable
and flagrant violations of every principle of
republican government.
The St Louis Republican, in reviewing the
message, thus speaks of the President's po.
sition :
'Considering that the present State administra
tion of Louisiana had be*en the only government
in the State for nearly two years, that it has been
tacitly acknowledged anil acquiesced in as such
by Congress and more than once expressly ac
knowledged by me, I regarded it as my clear
duty, when legally called upon for that purpose,
to prevent its overthrow." A careful study ol
these words reveals the preposterous doctrine
that any organization "tacitly acknowledged and
acquiesced m by Congress anil acknowledged by
me" as the lawful government of a State, is the
lawful government of that State, and must be
maiutained by force of arms, if need be.
The organization thus recognized by Congress
and the President as the State Government mav
he only a dozen of persons ; the whole people
may he organized against it ; it may be an usur
pation of conspirators : it may have any charac
ter : nevertheless—if it can manage to sec: re
from the President an acknowledgement and
from Congress a mere acquiescence—it is the
State Government, jit' tnia doctrine be com-' t, a
Republican President, with, not the appro- al, b t
the mere acquiescence of a Republican majority
in Congress, has authority to declare everv one
of the twenty-two Democratic States of the Union
in rebellion, Ly recognizing the defeated Repub
lican candidates as their lawful Governors.
The "present State administration ot Louis
iana " never hail any existence, and could not
now- live a day. but for the sup port of the
Federal Government. The President, then,
cannot claim to have found a government,
legally organized and in danger of overthrow
by armed resistance, and therefore entitled to
the support ot the National Government. He
first created the Kellogg fraud, and then hav
ing done so, consistency required him to
stand by and defend his bantling, a bastard
as it was and as weak as it has shown its elf to
be in the eyes of the whole country.
So questionable was its birth that Congress
refused to acknowledge its legality, and has
compelled the President to shoulder the en
tire responsibitity of the usurpation in this
State.
In conclusion the Republican says :
* All the messages that the President has sent to
Congress on the Louisiana question, and all that
he may have occasion yet to send, cannot dis
lodge from the public mind the conviction that
he acted most unworthily in it. Had he done
bis strict duty he would have let Louisiana alone
till a case had been made for his action. He
would have waited to see what the people of the
State would do—what government they would
have established aud recognized.
After that would have come the time for his re
cognition. It is no part of bis duty to determine
who was fairly and legally elected Governor in a
State, and. on tLat determination, to make him
Governor. If it were, why did he not make
Brooks, who. admittedly, " received a majority
of the legal votes actually cast'' at the election
of 1872 in Arkansas, Governor of that State?
Why did he recognize Coke Governor of Texas,
when it is a notorious fact that the < lection at
which he w-as chosen, was illegal ? The Presi
dent did right in Arkansas and Texas and wrong
in Louisiana.
He made Kellogg Governor, and then recog
nized him, interfering in a matter which he
ought io have carefully avoided as long as possi
ble. He made Kellogg Governor, not because he
believed him to have been legally chosen, for
with tkao point he had nothing whatever to do,
but simply because Collector Casey and Marshal
Packard requested him to ; aud on this insignifi
cant personal consideration rest3 the whole
Louisiana t rouble.

A PLOT TO SEAT THE RADI
CALS.
An Expose of the Intentions of the Re
turning Board.
Everything Arranged.
Ii proo were now wanting to show that there
was and is on hand a cold-blooded and desperate
conspiracy to defraud the people of our State out
of their successes in the late election.tand to seat
in the Legislature Radical candidates at all
hazards, the action of the Returning Board would
be sufficient, butas in many other conspiracies
the p : ot has leaked out through channels not
thought of. Below we give the letters of a col
ored Custom-House official, the originals of
which we hare in our possession, showing how,
as early as December 5th, this outrage on the
white people of the State was not only contem
plated but thoroughly planned.
By this correspondence it wall be seen those
within the ring already knew what would 1)6 the
action of the returning officers, and such men as
the com ictcd swindler, A. W. Faulkner, and P.
H. Carter, wc re to be sent for to assume their
seats in the Legislature. The secrecy to be ob
served, the dark-lantern manner in which these
di feared men were informed that everything
would be rig.' fc down I ere indicates too plainly
bow complete the scheme is. The injunction to
burn tin letters, trie caution not to tell any one,
brand the plot at once as too dark for the light of
day.
Kellogg andI: j political advisers must imagine
the citizen- of Louisiana are children to submit
to this open-handed theft of their rights. It
excels the coolness and bravado of the highway
man, and coming from a whipped mongrel
canine almost approaches the ridiculous, were
not such a grave and important matter at stake.
Both the candidates written to were defeated
and the following letters snow what was required
of then t? cocure their seats :

BUTCHERED.
The Two Brothers Estopinal Slain by the
Brothers Marrero.
The Bloody- Handed Pair Still at Large.
Brief mention was made in the several daily
journals a few days ago of a fatal affray which
occurred last Wednesday evening, on Magnolia
plantation, parish St. Bernard, wherein two mon
were killed.
The circumstances attending this tragedy
prove it to be one of the most shocking that wo
have ever been called upon fo chronielc, and
herewith we will detail them as elicited beforo
the Justice who held the inquest upon the
bodies of the deceased. The brothers Mathieu
and Joseph Estopinal, residents of the parish of
fct. Bernard, labored in various capacities during
rolling season for Mr. Herman Marrero, cn the
Magnolia plantation, and there being a balance
of $20 due Mathieu Estopinal, he agreed with
his employer to take a barrel of sugar in pay
ment.
He provided a barrel which Marrero ordered
filled, and which was left in the sugar-house to
drain. Not many days subsequent the barrel
was removed, and with a lot of other sugar
shipped to this city, but whether the barrel was
shipped on the express order ot Marrero, or
whether it was done by mistake, hag not been ex
plained; however, it was removed, and the fact
coming to the knowledge of Mathieu Estopinal,
he forthwith called upon Marrero for an explana
tion. In company with his brother Joseph and a
friend, Manuel Messa, he repaired to Marrero's
house on Wednesday evening, about 8 o'clock,
and questioned him regarding the transaction.
Leaving his brother and friend Messa at the
ROAD GATE,
he approached the door of Mr. Marrero's house,
and summoning him to the porch inquired rela
tive to the shipment of the sugar, desiring to
know if by this he (Marrero) meant to defraud
him of his just dues. Marrero's answer was that
he did not propose to deprive his family of sugar
for any man.
Estopinal insisted that he would not submit to
being defrauded in that manner, and affirmed
that if Marrero persisted in what was evidently
an intention to act a part unbecoming a gentle
man, there would he trouble.
Marrero straightway proposed it could be ad
justed by what he termed a fair fight, and sug
gested that they adjourn to the pnhlie road.
Marrero thereupon re-entered his house and
shortly came forth? accompanied by his younger
brother James, and the three walked to the road.
Arriving there Estopinel endeavored to avoid a
collision, and the brothers of each, that is Joseph
Estopinal and James Marrero, endervored to
prevent a difficulty.
Herman Marrero, persisted, however, and es
sayed to strip himself as though he contemplated
only a pugilistic encounter. Mathieu Estopinal
nothing daunted by Marrero's apparent wrath,
prepared
For. THE CONFLICT.
Instead of the pugilistic onslaught which the
Estopinal« contemplated, Mathieu Merrero, alter
haviug discarded his coat, made a stop backward
and drawing a six-shooter, fired upon Mathicn
three or four times, striking him first in the at»
domcn, and thou in the shoulder.
The wounded man was prostrated by the sec
ond shit, and while on the ground was fired
upon twice. As Herman Marrero fired the first
shot, his brother James, who had at first ex
pressed himself desirons of having nothing to d-*
with the difficulty, produced a navy six, and
placing it at the throat of Joseph Estopinal,
fired.
With a ery of horror the latter threw his arms
up and turned to escape, but as he did so he re
ceived another ball in the right side, just below
the armpit. So close was the muzzle of the re
volver, in the last instance, to the body of its vic
tim, that his cio< lies were tired ; and as the un
fortunate man fell, his garments blazed until he
was fearfully burned.
He was met by a relative or friend aud taken
to the sugar-house, where ho
EXPIRED
in a short time.
Mathieu Estopinal remained lying in the road,
not dead, but evident'y dying. The men who
had committed this fearful deed were no where
to be seen, nor has the closest search yet re
vealed them.
Mathieu Estopinal was removed to his home,
where he expired Friday morning at 6 o'clock,
and where, before his death, Justice E. E. Nunez
took his dying declaration.
Mathieu Estopinal was Coroner of the parish,
wherefore it devolved upon Justice Nunez to hold
an inquest upon the bodies of the dead brothers,
whereat the above version of the unfortunate af
fray was obtained.
The deceased brothers were regarded in the
community as industrious and good citizens, and
the treachery by which they were slain is very
generally deprecated by all citizens of the parish
Both brothers leave families, who were solely de
pendent upon them for support.
Ft be Co. No. 14's Ball.— The boys of this com
pany certainly deserved a great deal of credit for
the ball given by them last evening at Exposition
Hall. It was one of the most pleasant affairs we
have had the good fortune of attending this
season. Beauty w as plentilnl and elegant dresses
in abundance, every one present enjoyed them
selves very much and "tripped the light fantastic
toe" till the wee hours of the morning. We re
gret to learn that at half-past 4 o'clock Jaeger
disappointed them with music, but the members»
with their motto of "Perseverance" before them,
were not at a loss, for they engaged the services
of the 13th United States Infantry Band, who
performed, with good time, all requisite music.
Htaub.— ÿarout out on the prairies, during the
Fremont expedition in 1842, an old and time
stained newspaper was found, but how it came
there could never be learned. Subséquent in
vestigations have brought to light the fact that
it was only one out of Staub's mail, dropped on
the way. His gathering comes from everywhere
to the headquarters. 69 Canal street, where can
be found the news matter of the world at the
lowest rates. Like an Oriemal Pacha, he shakes
his three tails and glories in his rank as the
cheap news man of our city.

WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN £
Reinforcing the State-House.
We learn that there is going on extonsive war
like preparations at the State-Honso. Commis
sary stores have been carried into the I mild ing.
and a heavy supply of ammunition and arm»
placed in the several rooms. There is evidently
a big scare on hand, and tho police are very ex
cited over I he prospect. At a late hour last nigh!
dispatches passed over the police wires calling
for detachments to reinforce the State-House,
and before morning there will probably be more
than two hundred Metropolitans in the building»
The doors are tightly closed and a strict waU K
kept. What is the meaning of all this it is difficult
to say, as our city is remarkably quiet and Hier#
is no 'hing to create such a fright. " The guilty
My when no man pursueth."
Rumors were carrent on the street that Ander
son and tho Returning Board lnd left the city by
boat, but a Bulletin reporter discovered Anders
son at his residence at a late hour, so the rejiort
must he untrue.

material, and is one of the most popular in the
Crescent City Regiment. Ever ready for duty,

pliment paiif it is deserved. Wo congratulate
the men and officers on their success.
SCHOOL EXHIBITIONS.
WASHINGTON GIRLS' SCHOOL.
We had the pleasure of witnessing tho exhibi
tion of the above school. The recitations anti
pièces were well rendered. The vocal music
under the direction of Prof. Brardelee was very
tine. The whole affair passed off well, and tot»
much praise cannot be awarded to tho Principal,
Miss Wilder, and her able assistants for their
trouble.
THE MODONOOH GIBES' SCHOOL NO. 2
We witnessed the exhibition of the abo7W
school. The recitations were of the highest
character. The singing, under the direction of
l'rof. Watts, was woil rendered, aud although
there were over two hundred voices, ttio time
was excellent and the music was choice.
The whole exercises reliected great credit rat
the Principal, Mrs. Pitkius, and her able aotiat
ants.
It gives us pleasure to announce that Mr. C. H.
Lawrence, of the widely known house of C. H
Lawrcnce A Co., has returned to tho city after
spending the summer anil fall in the New Eng
land States making purchases for his house, and!
enlightening the citizens of those hyperborean,
regions concerning tho political condition of tho
oppressed Louisianians. The gentlemen com
posing this firm aro widely known throughout
the country._ ■
We learu that Mr. J. J. Wallace, of the Varie
ties, leaves our city for a short time on a trip tin
Galveston, where he intends playing at the Opera
House his original drama, in four acts, entitled,,
"Man from America." Later, wo understand,
this play will be produced here, and Iront what
we hear those who have read it say it will ho an
event in amusement circles. We commend Mr-.
Wallace to the hospitalities of our Texan friends,
as he is a gentleman of culture and high attain
ments.
The Rev. J. W. Bonham has. for the past week,
aided by the Rector of the Church, tho Rev. 8.
Burford, tho Bishop of the DioccHe aud a larg*
number of city and country clergy, held a very
interesting Mission >u our city. It has result« JS
in waking up the lukewarm aud arousing tl!o iu
different and careless. Mr. Bonham is an Eng
lishman, and as an Evangelist has attained most
deserved honor and reputation. His preaching;
is remarkably forcible. All are invited to come
and hear him, at any and all the services adver
tised among the special notices.
There will he given a grand concert for t he
bern fit of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the
Annunciation before the holidays. A number of
the German Quartette will sing, as also that
New Orleans favorite, Miss Fairex. assisted b?
many well known amateurs. We sincerely trust
that there will be a hearty response to this cal ii
for so good a cause, and hope that in tho good
heer and gladness of Y'ule Tide tho Chnri-h
of tho Annunciation and its concert will ht
remembered.__________
Grant's Trump Card.
[From the N. Y. Herald, j
Cuba is a trump held in reserve. If Congres»
does not accept his domestic recommendation»,
or if the laws it passes do not answor his expec
tation*. the President looks to the redeeming in
ffnenre of a popular foreign war. He has got
things in such a train that he can precipitate »
war with Spain whenever he chooses. The cur
rency, the South, and tho civil service are sni
jeets within the control of Congress. Bnt the
foreign relations of the Government are exempt
from such control, except in the last resort, andf
may be so managed by the Executive as to lea't
Congress no choice as to whether it
shall defend the national honor. The Presi
dent has got the Spanish question into
such a state that it can be fanned into a (tame
whenever he thinks it expedient, and he relies ot»
the country to support him in a war in which the
abolition of slavery in Cuba and breaking the
yoke of colonial servitude will be the leading,
ideas. Bnt Gen. Grant makes a stupendous in 13
take if he thinks he can play this desperate
game with success. England lias got her claims
ti r tho Virginius outrage settled, because her
Government had no selfish ulterior objects. On r
npericr claims for reparation have been
..nneied to linger, and if it shall appear in the se -
quel that the President has nursed tin m in erde;
to keep alive a pretext for war to serve party
end-, he will be borne down by a storm of publia
indignation.
The Charter Oak stove, for many; years, has
stood p e-c minent! v the greeted <•! all stoves,
and stiii holds the palm over all othi r machine
tor cooking. There are six d:fl. rent styles of
stoves, and vet they are all on tho stme prin
ciple. and each and every o.-e gu; ranteed. But
the greatest feature is that the p'-icos of these
valuable household treasures have 1-eeri reduced
so as to place them within the reach of ail.
