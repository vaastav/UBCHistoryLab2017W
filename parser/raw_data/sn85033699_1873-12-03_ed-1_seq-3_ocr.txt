A large party of these men assembled at
the Louisville depot yesterday evening,
prepatory to going out to Glasgow Junction
via the Louisville and Nashville road.

groups, with their blankets slung

ginger-bread and cheese, while lKrttles of
whisky were handed about from one to an
other in a very hospitable and generous
fashion. The writeiinoticed one old coon
who had been badly sold in the purchase of
a pinchbeck watch, which stopped about
the time he got to the depot. One
of the party seized the "time
keeper," gave it a vigorous shake,
and as a faint tick was heard,
rapturously exclaimed. "Why, Taylor, she
goes diirn her, don't you hear her go?"
It was sad to observe howquickly the gleam
of hope vanished from "Taylor's" counte
nance, us the ticking ceased after a few
spasmodic efforts.
Another gray headed sinner, who gave

The earnest but futile efforts made yes

We presume it was the police court fiend

The Sjmngjield Republican is nonpluss
ed: "A singular, not to say startling, piece
or intelligence comes from the Wheaten
Female Seminary in Norton, Bristol coun
ty. We are informed that the young ladies
of that institution met, a few days ago, and
after comparing notes on the "causes and
extent of the panic," actually passed a se
ries of resolutions to the elfejt that, hereaf
ter, they would keep themselves informed
in business matters, and for the present,
would abstain froinallunnecessary expendi

Burdett, of the Peoria J.Yrietc, is discon

anybody lias seen a black-and-tan dog, ans

street in company with a hard-shell turtle,
please halt the eloping pair, as they are the
property of the editor of this paper. We
are fondly attached to the dog on account
of his vagabondish, Bohemianish liabits.
lie knows every dog in Peoria by name,
and is on speaking terms with uine-tcntlis
of the granger dogs that, come in under the
wagons, and he knows more of the
inhabitants of this city than the
tax-collector does. The turtle is a
more recent acquisition. It was
placed in the back yard yesterday, and the
dog spent an hour and a half trying to en
tice it to come out of its shell and be so
ciable. The old iron-clad maintained his
reserve, however, until the dog crammed
his nose against the forward part and began
to snitr. The pair seemed to come to some
understanding at once, for the dog made an
impetuous remark on a very high key, and
they both startedon a trip afterDonaldson's
balloon. When the dog jumped over Fish
er's barn we thought he had struck the
eastern current and would get right tlirough,
but we learn since that he landed and was
seen sauntering along like a whirlwind, the
turtle staying right by him. We should le
very sorry to lose the dog now, as he has
acquired another important and valuable
quality. He knows more about turtles than
any other dog in the country, ard it's
mighty hard to find a real good turtle dog.

December Mnjjnxlne..
The principal articles in the Old and
Xcw for December are the "Giant Yous,"
a story from the French of George Sand,
"Charity at Cost," "Ferns," "Checkmate to
Apaches," a sensational tale, and auother
paper on "Country Sights and Sounds."
These are all readable and instructive.
That on "Charity at Cost" deserves special
mention, a it discusses in an interesting
manner the important subject of taxation
as related to charity. The principles main
tained in this paper are in accordance with
sound economy. This suggests to us the
general remark tliat the Old and Xeio usual
ly has some able contributors, whose
thoughts are practical and calcu
lated to lead men in safe ways.
On the other hand we find that its pages
are sometimes oien to writers whose
thoughts undoubtedly have a mischievous
tendency. We will not withold our opin-
... ... . t . i j
ion, either, mat some 01 us euuonais are
hut little better. They are notuufrequent
ly tinged with a hue of sophistry, which
must lie distasteful to every intelligent
mind. For instance, the last editorial con
tains this unqualified statement: The
War of the Rebellion will be looked upon
in history as the fulfillment of the obliga
tion in A ip nmistitulion that the nation
should guarantee Republican governments
to 1 he States." This betrays either an ut
ter ignorance of constitutional law, or a
most" censurable disregard for the truth.

EDUCATIONAL.
Wilson County Tcnchcrs' Institute.
To the Union and American:
The second meeting of the "Wilson
County Teachers' Institute" was held at
Lebanon on the 21st and 22d of November,
beginning at 7 P. M. of the 21st.
About thirty teachers of the public
schools of the county were present, more
than have ever attended any siniil.tr meet
ing in the county. In addition to those
connected with the public schools, several
members of the faculty of Cumberland
University and the Principal of "Corona"
were present, and rendered valuable aid
in carrying out the programme of the In
stitute and in making the exercises inter
esting and of practical benefit to those most
concerned.
Lectures were delivered on the following
subjects by the gentlemen whose names
are appended, each lecture being followed
by a general discussion of the subject, in
which all to a greater or less extent par

The "query box" vvas then opened and
a large number of questions answered. A
very interesting and in some instances a
very amusing exercise.
A constitution was auopteu providing
that meetings of the Institute shall be held
semi-annually time and place to be fixed
by the Executive Committee, and that ac
tual or prospective teachers are eligible to
membership.
A vote ot tlianks was tendered to the
deacons of the Presbyterian Church for the
use of the basement-room during the ses
sion of the Institute, to the citizens of
Lebanon and vicinity for hospitality shown
to the members, and to the publishers of the
Lebanon Herald, Union- and American
and Hejmblican JJanner for publishing the
programme of the Institute.
lakms into account the inclemency ot
the weather, the meeting was a decided
success.
Teachers seemed to realize the impor

ideas and of adopting from the mass of
suggestions offered, such principles as would
best promote success in their profession.

The Governor's Message.
Louisville, Dec 2. Gov. Leslie, in
his message delivered to-day to the Legisla

aqamst the lawlessness existing in some
counties of the State, stating tliat while he
has no authority to call out the militia, as
it would conflict with the regular constabu
lary force of disturbed districts, yet re
commends the appointment of a Commis
sioner to proceed to the disordered districts
and secure the arrest ot the parties guilty ot
complicity or connivance with "the Ku-
Klux.

The message announces the liquidation
of the State debt in full, being last year

ernor savs, concerning colored people,
whilst our colored population are straggling
so earnestly and with a measure of hopeful
success, to educate their children, it occurs
to me that we should shape out
for them a system of schools and
offer them at least the countenance of
our approval in theirelfortstoward improve
ments. In each of the annual messages I
have heretofore delivered to the General
Assembly, I called attention to this subject
and made recommendations suggestive of
my views. I now renew those recommen
dations and earnestly invite your attention
to this important interest. Our own sense
of justice, it seems to me, will not allow us
to longer ignore this demand.

Humors of the Morning:.
San Filvncisco, Dec 2. The Legisla

adjournment yesterday is considered a trick
of sharp practice to give the Demdcrats.and
Republicans time to complete their plans
against Booth and the Independents whom
he leads. It seems to be generally con
ceded, however, that Booth will be elected
for the long term and some Democrat for
tlie short one. Who the latter may be has
not been definitely settled. There is a re
port that Casserly is working to defeat
Booth, but it is not generally credited.
There are all sorts of rumors of bargains, com
promises and combinations, but the pro
ceedings to-day will probably tell the story.

Text of the Proctocol
Between Secretary Fish and the Span

Protocol of the conference held at the De
partment of State, at Washington, on the
20th of November, 1S73, between Ham
ilton Pisli, Secretary of State, and Bear
Admiral Don Jose Palo de Barnabe, En
voy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipo
tentiary of Spain.
The undersigned having met for the pur
pose of entering into a definite agreement
respecting the case of the steamer Virgin-
ms, which, while under tlie llag of the
United States, was on the 31st of October
last captured on tlie high seas by tlie fepan
ish man-of-war Tornado, have reached the
following conclusions:
fapain on her part stipulates to restore
forthwith the vessel referred to and the sur
vivors of her passengers and crew and on
the 2oth day ot December next to salute
the flag of the United States. If, however,
before tliat date Spain should prove to tlie
satisfaction of the government of the Uni
ted States that the Virginius was not en
titled to carry the flag of the United States
and was carrying it at the time of her cap
ture without right and improperly, the sa
lute will be spontaneously dispensed as in
such case not being necessarily requirable,
but tlie United btates will expect in such
case a declaimer of intent of indignity to
its llag in the act which was committed.
Furthermore, if on or before the 25th of
December, 1S73, it shall be made to appear
to the satisfaction of the United States that
theYirgiiusdidnotrightfulljcarrj'the Amer

TIIE LATE DISASTER.
The Survivors in London.
LoNnoNjDec. 2. Herald Cable Eleven
of the survivors from the Ville du Havre
departed for Paris to-night. The Railway
Company kindly provided a saloon
car for them. During their short
stay in London everybody vied with each
other in comforting the survivors. The
storekeepers refused toj accept payment.
These oilers were resisted with difficulty.
The steamer's agents provided funds, while
Morgan Brown and others offered a home
to all. This was unnecessary as several of
the survivinggentlemensavedenoughfuiKls.
Mr. Bishop had three hundred pounds in
English notes and gold. It is a remarkable
fact that several others, seemingly, had
ample time to dress completely. Bishop's
watch stopped at 28 minutes after 2;
Cramer's watch stopped exactly at
half-past two. This leads to the suppo
sition that much valuable time was lost
in lowerering boats. Owing to the utter
absence of discipline after the collision,
no orders were given. The officers
were distracted. Each helped himself.
The long , boat contained no first
class passengers. Sailors and coal boys
rushed and took possession. The Scotch
ship was prevented from preparing imme
diately for rescue from its ignorance as to
whether serious damage was done
the steamer, which arose probably
from. inability to communicate
in French. Consequently the Loch Erne's
boats were not lowered until tlie steamer
had gone down. No life preserver was in
its proper place. One gentleman, search
ing through four cabins, ascertained
that the occupants of three or
four cabins in midships were
probably killed when the Scotchman
struck the Ville du Havre. Tlie most of
those rescued had been floating from half
an hour to an hour before they were picked
up. The Scotchman had little comfort to
extend to the rescued, beyond open and
hearty good will.
The ladies chauged. their drenched night
dresses fov sailors,' clothlnp't It soon, how
ever, liecaiue a question whether the Loch
erne all'xiled safety to those on
board. Capt. Surmount declared his
determination to transfer the crew to some
other ship when possible, leaving t?i.Q Pas
sengers behind. This, was. resisted by the
mate and. Belknap, and after consultation
With the carpenter,, they overcame with
some difliculty Sunnont's opposition.
When the Trimountain was sight
ed lhe transfer was effected
and the American Captain offered the ladies
increased comfort in a neat calyn occupied
by his wife. Still when a landing was ef
fected at Cardiff at twilight on "Monday,
tlie. ladies, were in a state of sem.i-nud.ity,
some having only blankets, to, protect them.
