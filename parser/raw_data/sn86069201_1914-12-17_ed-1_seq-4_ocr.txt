Giving Away MONEY.
If we advertised that we'd give every man who comes to us in the next few weeks $2. or $3. or $5., every
man in a radius of a hundred miles would come. But when we quote such prices as these on our
HART-SCHAFFNER & MARX SUITS AND OVERCOATS
It amounts to giving you money.
If we offered you a $5. gold piece
for $4.50 it would be giving you
half a dollar; would'nt it? We of
fer you $22.50 clothes value for $16.75; if that is'nt
giving you $5.75 we'd like to know why not.

feeding the hungry, clothing the naked
and relieving the sick and distressed.
Many little boys and girls in Lancas
ter ara going to dppriv e themselves of
the annual pleasure of giving Xmas
presents to their dear ones, and are
going to contribute their funds which
they have so fondly hoarded and
cherished for this purpose, to the
Belgians. Surely He will remember
and reward such acts, and they will
feel the blessed assurance that "it is
more blessed to give than to receive".
However' the matter of succoring this
stricken nation is not a passing duty,
but one that must be continued until
better times dawn upon them. Christ
mas comes but once a year, and there
is always someone near home whose
life may be brightened by some little
contribution from our abundant store.
Therefore in our laudable effort to as
sist these for off self appointed charges,
let us not neglect the suffering which
may probably be found at our very
doors. Let us see to it that during the
festive season there is none within our
knowledge, our means permitting, who
goes without a small amount of those
things which makes Christmas. Per
haps but for our beneficence some
little stocking might be found empty
on Christmas morning; but for our
charitv some little tot might go hungry
on Christmas day. Before we expend
our surplus in the assistance of those
so far away, let us know that there is
no suffering near our own homes which
our bounty might relieve.
We are authorized to announce G. T.
Ballard Jr. as a candidate for the
democratic nomination for sheriff of
Garrard County to fill out the unexpir
ed term of the late C. A. Robinson
subject to the action of the Democratic
party in August primary 1915.
"The poor we have with us always."
With the rapidly approaching holiday
season, let us remember this, not with
a passing thought, but substantially.
It is well enough to help the Belgians,
surely this afflicted nation needs all
possible assistance, but always "char
ity begins at home", and while we are
making merry ourselves and giving of
our sustenance to those who are less
fortunate, let us see that those who
are at our very doors are not allowed
to suffer and that their Christmas is
made at least comfortable.
The recent call of the Record for the
assistance of our people in the relief of
the Belgians is meeting with liberal
response in the hearts of our people,
and scarcely a day passes but that the
columns of the Courier Journal chron
icles the name of some Lancaster or
Garrard county donor to this fund.
This is not a passing charity, but one
that must be kept up until peace comes
to this troubled nation, else there will
be untold suffering. Pen cannot des
cribe conditions there, and but for the
charitabl kindness of the big hearted
people of this country, the suffering
would have been many times greater.
The stream of contributions continue
to pour in in an undiminished stream,
and ship after ship laden with provis
ions and clothing for their relief is dis
patched upon their journey of mercy.
Let not this human duty to a stricken
nation fall upon a charitable few. Let
us all take a hand in doing the work of
the Master. Sunday schools, churches,
fratern?! organizations, schools, indi
viduals all should have a part in this
most laudable undertaking, that of
Christmas began with music when
heaven's choir sang it in Bethlehem
two thousand years ago. Earth caught
the glad refrain, and has been chant
ing Christmas carols ever since.
Christmas-tide comes in with "Merry
Christmas" greetings and goes out
with "Happy New Year" benedictions.
Surely if Christmas means so much
Christ means more and we should be
guarded against making more of Christ
mas than of Christ, more of the gift
than the giver. This being true, care
should be taken to observe Christ's
birthday in an appropriate way.
If on your birthday, gifts were given
to all your friends and no gift to your
self, would it gladden your heart? If
not, then why should our Lord's heart
be gladdened under such treatment?
Previous to twenty five years ago
most Bible schools had what might be
called a "Getting Christmas". The
Christmas tree was hungwith presents,
some from teacher to class and the
reverse, others from people to pastor
and from friend to friend. Little
thought was given to the poor that are
with us always and still less was that
of giving to Christ as a birthday offer
ing. But the new service, "White
Gifts for the King1' is changing this
old order of things by providing three
all-importantgif ts, first-SELF-, second,
SERVICE-, and third, SUBSTANCE.
Let each of us do what we can to
change the "Getting Christmas" into
a "Giving Christmas" for then, and
then only, can Christ look upon Christ
mas as His birthday. Above all things
let us remember that it is "not what
we give but what we share, for the
gift without the giver is bare."

DELIGHTFUL DINNER.
Mr. J. R. Haselden was the host last
Friday evening for a most elaborate six
o'clock dinner in honor ot the pastor,
deacons and elders of Christian church.
The beautiful apartments were em
bellished by artistic decorations of
green and with the brilliant lights made
it a most pleasing scene. Covers were
laidjfor 18, with dainty nlace cards
bearing an appropiate verse and a
picture of a colored waiter attached, all
being the ingenious work of the host
himself. The genuine hospitalty ex
tended made the occasion one long to
be remembered by each gusst
NOEL.
After an illness of several months
Mr. W. T. Noel died at his home in
Buckeye, Tuesday evening, at six
o'clock.
He was familiarly known as "Billy
Noel" and will be missed by a host of
friends in town and his home section.
He was born and reared near where he
died, being the son of Squire R. A.
Noel and Patsy Burton.
When quite young he married Miss
Lort Ray, who together with eight
children survive him.
Mr. Noel was forty six years old the
seventh of last July. From his early
youth he was a member of the Baptist
church. After short services at the
grave he was buried in the Lancaster
cemetery today, the funeral services
being conducted by Rev. J. W. Beagle.

family in extending sympathy to the
bereaved widow and children.

SMALL CROWD AT PUBLIC
SALE OF LATE STEVE E,
OWSLEY.
Owing to the day being one of the
worst of the winter, the thermoneter
hovering around zero, the crowd was
small at the Owsley sale. A dinner
was served the crowd and did much for
the enjoyment of the inner man.
The farm of 220 acres was taken
down at ninety dollars and thirty cents
an acre and was rented for the year
1915 ta Boone Sander? and Mike Rogers

BAZAAR
CHRISTMAS GffTS AT THIS BAZAAR.
Miss Lena Bright will have her an
nual bazar at her residence on Water
street Dec. 18. This is a chance to
buy-your Xmas gifts cheaper than you
can make them. Miss Lena-wilp have
toys and dolls fcr the children, fancy
work for thegrown tips and will ,also
handle a line of hand painted china.
Never did the world need Christmas,
with all its strength and power and
beauty and its gentleness and its char
ity, as it needs it today. The Christ
mas chimes will ring from the cathe
dral at Rheims, as well as from St.
Paul's. That is the beauty of Christ
mas; it cannot be destroyed; its cul
ture cannot be overthrown. It is an
ever-present memory and a never
dying hope. The first Christmas carol
was "Peace on earth; good will to
men."
Keep bright these fires of hope and
faith. Light all the candles upon the
Christmas tree. For a moment let the
children, at least, forget the darkness
that covers half of Europe, and let
them know that not war itself can
postpone the coming of fhe Christmas
morn, with all of its surprises and its
joys, affection and its delight. For
every Christmas is a well-spring of
strength and beauty and glory, hasten
ing the time when the lighted candles
in each separate home shall make bright
the remotest corners of the earth.

THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
Like all of his public utterances,
President Wilson's address to Congress
was full of sober serious thought. He
calls attention to the empty markets
of the world that are open to us, but
we cannot supply them because we lack
ships. He says that we have "stunted
and hindered the development of our
merchant marine and now we need
ships and have not got them".
Attention is particularly directed to
two subjects; economy in government
expenditures, and the subject of nation
al defense. He is opposed to a larger
standing army, but development of the
national guard of the states is encour
aged. He adds that anything beyond
this would mean that we had lost our
self-possession by a war with which
we had nothing to do.
PAY YOUR TAXES.
At the last meeting of the city coun
cil Mr. Herron was instructed to have
a complete list of all paid and unpaid
taxes by the next meeting night, which
will be the first Monday night in Jan
uary, that the entire list may be read
before the council and those not having
paid by that time will be advertised
besides paying the usual penalty. A
good many are still in arrears with
their water rent, which must be paid
or the water will bev shut off. Mr.
Herron has been very lenient with the
tax payers, in fact too much so, until
now that "patience has ceased to be a
virtue", you must pay your taxes and
water rent, or suffer the humility of
having your home advertised. The
city is in dire need of this money and
should be paid at once to avoid the
extreme measure that the council will
take at its next meeting.
CHRISTMAS HOMECOMING.
One of the great features of Christ
mas is the home meeting. How many
hundreds of thousands who have been
separated throughout the year will now
be gathered together once more under
the old home roof.
It is well that it should be so. It
warms the heart to read of the trains
to the north and the trains to the south,
east and west being filled with people
going home for their Christmas holidays.
Gladstone once said; "I am told that
the strain of our commercial life has
loosened even the bonds that unite the
family; that in the struggle for exist
ence the parents forget the child and
the child forgets the parents". God
forbid that this should be so. If the
parents did not think of the children
they would not have them home, and
if the boys and girls did not think of
their parents they would not go home.
Blood is a great deal thicker than wa
ter, and nothing will alter it. If pos
sible spend your Christmas at home.

BY ASTONISHED MULTITUDE.
When the Great Andes came to
his platform a few nights ago he car
ried a glass dish, and it was soon
realized that he had in it something
out of the ordinary. A large crowd
soon surrounded him, all eager to see
what was in the dish. When told it
was a tape worm ahd still alive, some
threw up their hands in horror and
backed away, while others drew near
to get a glimpse of the monster. All
were anxious to know who it came
from and how long it was. When Mr.
Andes was ready for his health talk
he picked up the dish, and put a lead
pencil under the worm. It was still
alive, and would squirm back and
forward like a snake. The 3,000
people present were astonished at
seeing such a monster, and especially
alive. It came from the system of
Robert Boltmire, of East Broad. He
has been a sufferer from stomach
trouble and indigestion for four or
five years, and in that time had used
many medicines, endeavoring to get
cured. Andes' Great Prescription has
removed every ache and pain, and he
has used only one bottle. Standing
beside the platform before the enor
mous crowd. Robert Boltmire said:
"My stomach would bloat after meals.
what I ate would not digest, and my
food would lay on my stomach like
a lump of lead; would have shortness
of breath, heart would beat fast.
Sometimes my appetite was good; at
other times would eat very little my
bowels were badly constipated; I was
weak and gradually running down
every day. Very often would have
dizzy spells and sharp pain3 about my
heart. Hardly a day passed but what
had headache; but to-night after suf
fering tor years all my pains and bad
feelings have disappeared, and owe it
all to Andes' Great Prescription."
The tape worm that came from this
man is 47 feet long.
Andes' Great Prescription cures ca
tarrh of anv form, indigestion, stom
ach, liver, kidney or bladder disorders,
purifies the blood, builds up run down
systems, and will remove worm3 from
grown folks or children. Price, $1,00
per bottle, 3 for $2.50, six for 5.00.
Amies' Great Oil, the modern won
der, cures head noises, hard of hear
ing, stiff or drawn joints, rheumatism,
lumbago, sciatica, sprains or strains,
and will relieve any pain in three
minutes. Price, 50c per bottle, 3 for
1.25.
All these great medicines are now
sold in Lancaster by the McRoberts
Drug Store.
