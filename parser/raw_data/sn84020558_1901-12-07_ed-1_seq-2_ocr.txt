The United States industrial commis

SOLVING Eut E'rl Problem,
THE SERVANT but actually un
CHKL. PROBLEM, nounces that It has
found the cause of
a trouble whi- h is one of the chief
topics of conversation at every tea
table from Phoenix to Pembina and
from Bar Harbor to Santa Monica.
The commission reaches the conclu
sion that the great diiTicuIty is with
the housewife herself. The American
v.oman. it finds, is domineering and
tyrannical. She wants to hue a per
son; not that person's labor. She
wants to command, an J insists that
the person commanded shall he not
only socially inferior, but shall not for--gtt
the inferiority. She demands per
sonal service, and insists upon com
manding all cf the servant's time. In
the United States, where the major
ity of servants are American born, and
where there is a prejudice against tiie
drawing of class distinctions, not even
the increased compensation which do
mestic "help" receives as compared
with factory wcrk and similar coin
retin employments, is sufficient to
overcome the aversion to domestic em
ployments. Tne commission in
trusted the servant invest ig-ation
to Gail I-.aufchlin, a woman L..
L,. H who sent out five thousand
printed interrogatories to employers
and servants.
The conclusion as to the lack of bus
iness principles is summed up as follow-
:
Household lcibor has not had apr'ip
to it the economic rrnciples v. iaieh
have been applied to other occupations,
it has not been put 0:1 a bu-ine'3 ba-siss.
The relation of employer and employe
is still regarded aj largely a personal
relation. A personal -iallon .jetvejn
employer And employe incvitablly be
comes the relation of superior and in
ferior, rather than a contract between
equals, and this is what has developed
in domestic service. To remove the
social stiirma from domestic service,
and thus attract into that service a
larger n:i:.itcr of intelligent employes,
household l.-bor must be established
on a business bai..
That household labor r.hould have ap
plied to it the business jtrlncriples
which are applied to other classes of
labor is the opinion of those who have
pivpti t he bv-t t houirlir to iiiis suh-
iect. Thnt ti is should be done is also j
the opinion of quite a number of em
ployers who responded to the request of
the schediilfs sent out for suggestions
of chants advisable in our present
domestic servant system.
Taking this view, what would be the
changes necessary? First, there would
have to be definiteness as to the work
re-L'ire-i. Specific pivis to be per
formed should be the subject-matter
of the contract. That this is possible
has been shown by the fact that such
a contract is. at least rornetirr.es, made
with Chinese servants; that the sys
tem has proved more sut'sfrictody thm
the method now Kcneriil!;.' in voue is
the oxnr-?o'l o.-iaion of the employer
who reported th far-t.

which have given rise to it.
In speaking of the reason which
prevent women from entering domes
tic service, rean Marion . r.ilbot, cf
the University of Chicago, expressed
the opinion that the objections already
referred to. viz., indeflnitenesa of
hourr. unlit sleeping- accommodations,
the impositions of restrictions, etc.
were causes of which social position
was the result. The reasoning is vlid.
but these "conditions are themselves
from an underlying cause. That un

s-rvl'-e the contract is, usually, for the

expected to perform not only certain

X-'nlversal gratitude awaits the man
who can discover just where the ucfect
is in our public school
HAD system that will nc-
FI'EI.LIXH. count for the fact that
with the average "edu
cation" acquired in thecommon schools
there goes an inability to spell. Many
theories are advanced to explain why
correct spc-liin seems to be a vaniEh
ins accomplishment. The explanation
most generally accepted is that the
schools of today are too much given
to fads, the following of which require
th? abandonment of the former system
of teaching Hpelllns. which made prod-
izics of so many pupila. Under the
rule of the cominB iceneral in ba.

At the Jiorthwcsteru University (at
Chicaso) fully Vol pupils, many
whom would have Krsduate.1, have
b.-cn set to studying a little green sp-.d
lintf book. Prof. Clarke says that
large proportion of former graduates
were poor spellers, and that it has been
decided to withhold parchments here
after until the pupils shall have mas
tered the a-t of spelling word3 in com
mon use. It is not the Northwestern
University students alone who shew
thi3 defect, but afro those who have
been admitted to that institution from
other schools. Prof. Clarke has mad'
a list of the words which pupils who
hoped to receive their diplomas last
rear wrestled with in vain. Among
them are these, as they were spelled
Kxccrcise. tyreny, con-istant, shad.low

It Is a curious fact that the pupil:
who were guilty of these atrocities de
clare that tiie school authorities ore
"unnecessarily revere." Prof. Clark
affirms that the whole fault lies with
t::e grammar uehool, where rpe'llinjr is
taught by the worst :?::iods. "Tb
