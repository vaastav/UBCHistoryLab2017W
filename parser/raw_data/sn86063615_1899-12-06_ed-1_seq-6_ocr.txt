legacy and example.
The nrty-alxth conrnss coorenes In Its first rem
lar session with the cosntry In a condition of un
tunal prosperity, of nnlTenal good will among the
people at home, and In relations ot peace and friend
ship with erery government ot the world. Oar for
eign commerce has shown great increase in Tolome
and ram. -The combined imports and exports for the
year an the luxest eier shown by a single year in
all onr history. Our exports for 1899 alone exceeded
by mors than a billion dollars onr Imports and ex
ports combined In 1570. The imports per capita are
10 per cent less than In 1ST0. while the exports prr
capita ars 8 per cent more than in 1S70, showing the
enlarged capacity of the United States to satisfy the
wsnts ot Its own lncresslns population, as well as to
contribute to those of the peoples of other nations.
Exports of agricultural products were 1781,776.11;.
Of manufactured products we exported In value $329,
C32.14C, being larger than any previous yesr. It Is a
noteworthy fact that the only years In all osr history
when the products of our manufactories sold abroad
exceeded those bought abroad were IMS and 1899.
Gorernment receipts from all sources for the Uses!
yesr ended June 39, 1199, Including tll.793.31l.il.
part payment of the Central raclfic railroad indebt
edness, aggregated iC10,9&00(.:S. Customs receipts
were 120G.US.4S1.75, sad those from internal revenue
tr73.117.ltl.il.
For the fiscal year the expenditures were 170,091,
CC4.03, lesrlng a deficit of JS9.Ul,t;3.67.
The secretary of the treasury estlmstes that the
receipts for the current fiscal year will aggregate
fHO.SM.li:. and upon the basis of present appro
prlstlons the expenditures will aggregate JC00.9M.lli.
leaving a surplus of 1(9,000,000.
For the fiscal year ended June 10. 1S99, the In
ternal revenue recelpta were Increased about $100,
tiuO.OOO. The present gratifying strength of the treasury Is
shown by the fact list on December 1, ISM, the
srsilsble cssh balance was 1178.001,517.7:. ot which
S.74(.90i.C was In gold coin and bullion. The
-undltlons ot confidence which prevail throughout
the country have brought gold Into more general
im, and "customs receipts are now almost entirely
paid in that coin -
The strong condition ot the treasury with respect
to cash pa band and the favorable showing made
by the revenuea have made It possible for the
secretary-of the treasury to tabs action tinder the
provisions ot section 3S94, revls&l statutes, relsting
to the sinking fund. Receipts exceeded expenditures
for the first five months ot the current fiscal year
by 113.1U.CS.S.J1. and, as mentioned above, the sec
retary ot the treasury estimates tilt there will be
a surplus ot spproxlmstely 840,000,000 at the end
of the year. Under aueh conditions, it was deemea
advlssble and proper to resume compliance with
the provisions of the sinking fund lair, which for
eight years hss not been done because of deficiencies
in the revenues. The tressury department, there
lore, offered to purchase daring Kovember 335,000,000
ot the S per cent loan of 1904, or the 1 per cent
funded loan of 1907. at the current market price. The
amount offered and purchased during November wss
318,408.600. The premium paid by the government
on such purchases wss t2.2S3.sa and the net savin
in interest was about 13.8S5.O00. Tbe success ot
this operation was sufficient to induce the govern
ment to continue the offer to purchsse bonds to
and Including tbe 23rd dsy of December, instant,
unless the remainder of the 133,000.000 called for
should be presented In the meantime for redemption.
MORE MONEY NEEDED.
It I Recommended. That Larfter Issue
of National Bank Note Be
Authorized.
Increased activity In Industry, with Its welcome
attendant a larger employment for labor at higher
wages-gives to the body of the people a larger power
to absorb tbe circulating medium. It is further
true that, year by year, with larger areas ot land
under cultivation, the Increasing volume ot agri
cultural products, cotton, corn and wheat, calls for a
liner volume of money supply. This is especially
noticeable at the crop harvesting and crop moving
period.
In its earlier history, tbe national basking act
seemed to prove a ressonsble avenue through which
heedful addition to tbe circulation could from time to
time be- made. Changtng conditions hsve appsrently
rendered it now Inoperative to that end. The high
margin In bond securities required, resulting from
lsrge premiums which government bonds command
in the market, or lbs tax on note iaiues, or both
operating together, aKPear to be the Influences which
Impair Its public utility.
The attention of congress Is respectfully Invited to
this important matter, with the view of ascertaining
whether or not such reasonable modifications can be
made in tbe national banking act as win render its
services In the particulars here referred to more re
sponsive to the people's seeds, I sgsln urge that
national banks be authorized to organize with a
capital cf 135.000.
AS TO GOLD STANDARD.
Secretary of Treasury Should Be Re
quired to Issue Bond to Main
tain It.
I urgently recommend that, to support tbe existing
gold standard, and to maintain "tbe parity in value
of tbe coins ot the two metsls (gold snd silver) and

A Most Remarkable Remedy That

A Free Trial Package Sent ny Mall

Free trial patffcres of a most remarkable
remedy arff being mailed to all who will

suttfeTltiE of lost manhood that the Institute
has decided to distribute free trial pack

The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct to
the desired location, sit Inn; strength and de

all the ills and trouDlcs that come from
years of misuse of the natural functions
and has been an absolute success In all
cases. A request to the State Medical In

the equal power cf every dollar at all times In tbe
market ard In tbe payment or debts. tbe secretary
of the treasury be given additional power and
charged with the duty to tell United States bonds
and to employ such other effective means as msr be
necesssry to these ends. Tbe authority should In
clude the power to sell bonds on long and short
time, as conditions may require, and should provide
for a rate of Interest lower than that fixed by the
act cf January It, 1875. While there la now no
commercial fright which withdraws gold from the
government, but, on tbe contrary such widespread
confidence that gold seeks tbe tressury, demanding
psper money In exchange, yet tbe very situation
points to the present as the most fitting time to
make adequste provlilon to insure the contlnusnce
of'che gold standard and ot public confidence in the
ability and purpose ot the government to meet sll
its obligations in the money which the civilized
world recognizes ss the beet. The financlsl trane
arttons of the government are conducted upon a gold
basis. We require gold when we sell United State
bonds end use gold for their payment. We are main
taining the parity of all tbe money lesued or coined
by authority of tbe government. We are doing
theie things with the means at hand. Happily, at
the present time, we are not compelled to resort to
loans to supply gold. It hss been done In the pait,
however, and may have to be done In the future.
It behoovea us, therefore, to provide at once the ben
meana to meet the emergency when It ariees, and the
best means sre those which are the moifcertsin snd
economical. Those now authorized hae the lrtue
neither of directness nor economy. We hsve slready
eliminated one ot the causes ot our financial plight
and embarrassment during the years 1893. 1894. 1833
snd 1S96. Our receipts now equsl our expenditures;
deficient revenues no longer create alarm. It us
remove the only remaining cause by conferring tbe
foil and the neceerary power on the secretary (
the treasury and lmpoae upon him the duty to uphoM
the present gold standard snd preserve the coins of
the two metals on a parity with each other, whlth Is
the repeatedly declared policy of the United States.
In thla connection 1 repeat my former recommenda
tions that a portion of the gold holdings shall be
placed In a trust fund, from which greenbacks shall
be redeemed upon presentation, but when once re
deemed shall not thereafter be paid out except for
gold.
MERCHANTMARINE.
Urgent Need of Legislation to router
Its Groirtli Strongly Em
phasized. The value ot an American merchant marine to the,
exteniton of onr commercial trade and the strength
ening of onr power upon the sea invites the imme
diate action of cone re is. Our national development
will be onesided and unsatisfactory so long as the
remarkable growth of our Inland Industries remains
unaccompanied br progress on the peas. There Ii no
lack of constitutional authority for legislation which
shall glte to the country maritime strength commen
surate with Its Industrial achievements and with It
rank among the nations of the earth.
The pastyear has recorded exceptional activity in
our shipyards, and the promises ot continual pros
perity In shipbuilding are abundant. Advanced leg
islation for the protection of our seamen has been
enacted. Our coast trade, under regulations wisely
framed at the beginning of the government and since,
thou a results for the past fiscal year uncqualed In
our records or those of any other power. We t-ball
fail to realize our opportunities, however. If we com
placently regard only1 matters at home and lend
ourselves to the necessity of securing our share In
the ralnablo carrying trade of the world.
Last Tear American vessels transported a smaller
share of our exports and Imports than during any
former year In all our history and the measure of
our dependence upon foreign shipping was painfully
manifested to our people. Without any choice of
our own, but from necessity, the departments of the
government charged with military and naval opera
tions in the East and West Indies bad to obtain from
foreign flags merchant vessels essential for those
operations.
The other great nations bare not hesitated to
adopt the required means to develop their shipping
as a factor in national defense, and as one of the
surest and speediest means of obtaining for their
producers a share in fore'gn markets. Like vigi
lance and effort on our part cannot fail to Improve
onr situation, which is regarded with humiliation
at home and with surprise abroad. Even the seem
ing sacrifices which at the beginning may be In
volved will be offset later by more than equivalent
gains.
The expense is as nothing compared to the advant
age to be achieved. The re-establishment of our
merchant marine InvoHes In a large measure our
continued Industrial progress and the extension of
our commercial triumphs. I am satisfied the Judg
ment of tbe country favors the policy of aid to our
merchant marine, which will broaden our commerce
and markets and upbuild our sea carrying capacity
for the products of agriculture and manufacture,
which, with the Increase of our navy, mean more
work and wages to our countrymen, as well as a
safeguard to American interests In every part ot the
world.
TRUST LEGISLATION URGED.
"Whatever Power Congress Has
Should Be Promptly Ascertained
and Asserted.-
Combinations ot capital organized Into trusts to
control the conditions of trade among our citizens, to
stifle competition, limit production and determine
prices of products used and, consumed by the people,
are justly provoking publtc"discussIon, and should
early claim the attention ot the congress.
iue mausinai commission, creaiea oy me act ot
the congress of June IS, 1S9S, has been engaged in
extended hearlnc&uno-a he -disputed questions In
volved In the subject ot combinations In restraint ot
trade' and competition. They have not yet completed
their investigation. of this subject, and tbe conclu
sions and recommendations at which they may ar
rive axe undetermined.
The subject Is one giving rise to many divergent
views as to the nature and variety or cause and ex
tent of the Injuries to the public which may result
from large combinations concentrating more or lets
numerous enterprises and establishments which pre
viously to. the formation ot the combination were
carried on separately.
It Is universally conceded that combinations which
engross or control the market of any particular kind
of merchandise or commodity necessary to the gen
eral community, by suppressing natural and or
dinary competition, whereby prices are unduly en
hanced to tbe general consumer are obnoxious not
only to the common law, but also to the public wel
fare. There roust be a remedy for the evils Involved
In such organ Izatlbn-r. If the present law can be
extended more certainly to control or check tbese
monopolies cr trusts, It should be done without delay.
Whatever power the congress pos
sesses over this most important sub
ject should be promptly ascertained
and asserted
President Harrison on Trusts.
President Harrison In his annual message of De
cember's, 1SS9, says:
"Earnest attention should be given by congress to
a consideration ot the question how far the restraint
ot those combinations of capital commonly called
trusts' is a matter of federal jurisdiction. When
organized, as they often are, to crush out all healthy
competition and to monopolize the production or sale
ot an article of commerce and general necessity they
are dangerous conspiracies against the public good
and should be made the subject of prohibitory and
even penal legislation.'
An act to protect trade and commerce against un
lawful restraints and monopolies was passed by con
gress on the 2d ot July, 1EW. Tbe provisions of this
statute are comprehensive and stringent. It declares
every contract or combination. In the form of a
trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in the restraint of
trade or commerce among the several states or with
foreign nations, to be unlawful. It denominates as a
criminal every person who makes any such contract
or engages in any such combination or conspiracy,
and provides a punishment by fine or Imprisonment.
It invests the several circuit courts of tbe United
States with Jurisdiction to prevent and restrain vio
lations ot the act and makes it the duty of the
several United States district attorneys, under he
direction ot tbe attorney general, to institute pro
ceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such
violations. It further confers upon any person who
shall be Injured In bis business or property by any
other person or corporation by reason of anything
lorDiaaen or accarea 10 oe uruawiui oy me act the
power to sue therefor in any circuit court of the
United States, without respect to the amount In con
troversy, and to recover threefold the damages bj
him sustained and the costs of the suit. Including
reasonable attorney fees. It will be perceived that
the act is aimed at every kind of combination In tbe
nature of a trust or monopoly In restraint of inter
state or International commerce.
The prosecution by tbe United States of offenses
under the act of 1830 has been frequently resorted to
in the federal courts, and notable efforts In the re
straint of Interstate commerce, such as the Trans
Missouri Freight Association and the Joint Traffic
Association, have been successfully opposed and sup
pressed. President Cleveland's Trust Advice.
President Cleveland, In bis annual message of De
cember 7. 163S more than six years subsequent to
the enactment ot this law after stating tbe evils of
these trust combinations, says:
Though congress has attempted to deal with thli
matter by legislation, the laws passed for that put.
pose thus far have proved Ineffective, not because ot
any lack of disposition or attempt to enforce them,
but simply because the laws themselves, as Inter
preted by the courts, do not reach the difficulty. If
the Insufficiencies of the existing laws can be reme
died by further legislation. It should be done. The
fact must be recognized, however, that all federal
legislation on this subject may tall short of its pur
pose because ot Inherent obstacles, and also because
of tbe complex character of our governmental sys
tem, which, while making the federal authority su
preme within Its sphere, has carefully limited that
sphere by metes and bounds which cannot be trans
gressed. The decision of our highest court on this
precise question renders It quite doubtful whether
the evils ot trusts and monopolies can be adequately
treated through federal action, unless they seek di
rectly and purposely to Include In their objects trans
porta tlon or Intercourse between states or between
the United Stales and foreign countries.
"It does not follow, however, that this Is the limit
of the remedy that may bo applied. Even though
It may be found that federal authority Is not broad
enough to fully reach the case, there can be no
doubt ot the power of the several states to act ef
fectively In the premises, and there should be no
reason to doubt their willingness to Judiciously ex
ercise such power."
The state legislation to which President Cleveland
looked for relief from the evils of trusts has failed
to accomplish fully that object. This Is probably due
to a great extent to the fact that different states
take different views as to the proper war to dis
criminate between eril and injurious combinations
and those associations which are beneficial and neces
sary to the business prosperity ot the country. The
great diversity of treatment tn different states
arising from this cause and the Intimate relations
ot all parts ot the country to each other without re
garding state lines In the conduct of business have
made the enforcement ot state laws difficult.
It Is apparent that uniformity of legislation upon
this subject In the several states Is much to be de
sired. It is to be hoped that such uniformity, found
ed In a wise and jut discrimination between what
la Injurious and what Is useful and necessary In
business operations may be o-fetalntd, sad that means
may be found for tbe congress, within the limitations
cf Its constitutional power, o to supplement an ef
fective code ot state legislation as to maie a com
plete system of laws throughout the United Ststes
adequate to compel a general observance of tbe
salutary rules to which I bate referred.
The it hole question is ho Important
and far reaching that I am sure no
part of It will be lightly considered,
but every phase of It will have the
studied deliberation of the congress,
resulting In wise and Judicious action.
F0REIGNRELATI0NS.
Diplomatic Healing With Other Na
tions During the Year
Set Forth.
A review of our relations with foreign states 1.
presented with such recommendations as are deemed
appropriate.
Tho long pending boundary dispute between the
Argentine Repabllc and Chile was Mttlcd In March
last by the award of an arbitral commission, on
which the United States minister at Buenos Ayres
served es umpire.
Progress has been made toward the conclusion of a
ccnventlon of extradition with the Argentine Repub
lic. Having been ad.lsed and consented to by the
United States senate, and ratified by Argentina, it
only awaits the adjutment of tome slight changes
In the text before exchange.
In my last annual message I adverted to the claim
of the Austro-Hungarian government for Indemnity
for the killing of certain Austrian and Hungarian
rub J ecu by the authorities of tho state of Pennsyl
vania, at Lat timer. while suppressing an unlawful
tumult of miners, September 10, 1897. In view of tuc
verdict cf acquittal rendered by the court before
which the sheriff and hit deputies were tried for
murder, and following the established doctrine that
the government may not be held accountable for in
juries suffered by Individuals at the hands of the pub
lic authorities while acting In the line of duty In
suppressing disturbance cf the public peace, this gov
ernment, after due consideration of the claim ad
vanced by the Austro-Hungarlan government, was
corn-trained to dec'lne liability to indemnify tbe suf
ferers. It is gratifying to be able to announce that the
Belgian government has mitigated the restrictions on
the Importation of cattle from the United States, to
which I referred in my last annual message.
Having been Invited by Belgium to participate in
a congress, held at Brussels, to revise the provisions
cf the general act of July 3. 1S90. for the repression
cf the African slave trai". to which the United States
was a signatory pcrty, this government preferred not
to be represented by a plenipotentiary, but reserved
the right ot accef-Ion to the result. Notable changes
were made, those especially concerning this countr
being In the line of the Increased restriction of the
deleterious trade in spirituous liquors with the native
tribce. which thli government has from the outset
urgently advocated. The amended general act will
be laid before the senate, with a view to Its advice
and consent.
The Bolivian Rebellion.
Early In the year the peace ot Bolivia was disturbed
by a successful Insurrection. The United States min
ister remained at his post, attending to the American
Interests In that quarter, and using, besides, his
good offices for the protection of the Interests ot Brit
ish'' subjects In the absence of their national repre
sentative. On the establishment of the new govern
ment cur minister was directed to enter Into relations
therewith. General Pando was elected president of
Bourn on October 23.
Our representative has been Instructed to use alt
permissible friendly endeavors to induce the govern
ment of Bolivia to amend Its marriage laws so as to
gtva legal status to the non-Catholic and civil mar
riages of aliens within Its jurisdiction, and strong
hopes are entertained that the Bolivian law Jn this
regard will be brought, as was that of Peru some
years ego. Into harmony with the general practice of
modern states.
A convention of extradition with Brazil, signed
May 14, 1S97, has been ratified by the Brazilian legis
lature. During the past summer two national ships of the
United States have visited Brazilian ports on &
friendly mission and been cordially received. The
voyage of the Wilmington up the Amazon river gave
rise to a passing misunderstanding, owing to confu
sion in obtaining permission to visit the interior and
make surveys in the general interest ot navigation,
but tho Incident found a ready adjustment In har
irony with th close relations of amity which this
government has always sedulously sought to cultivate
with the commonwealths of the Western continent.
Coutroversy With Colombia Settled.
The claim growing out of the seizure ot the American-owned
newspaper, the Panama Star and Herald,
by the authorities of Colombia, has been settled,
after c controversy of several years, by an agreement
assessing at $30,000 the Indemnity to be paid by the
Colombian government in three Installments of 1 10, 000
each.
The good will of Colombia toward our country ha
been testified anew by the cordial extension of facili
ties to the Nlcaraguan canal commission In their ap
proaching investigation of the Panama canal and
other projected routes across the Isthmus of Darlen.
Toward the end of October an Insurrectionary dis
turbance developed In the Colombian republic. This
movement has thus far not attained any decisive re
sult and Is etlll In porgress. Discussion of the ques
tions raised by the aetlon ot Denmark In imposing
restrictions on the importation of American meats
has continued without substantial result in our favor.
The neighboring Island republic of Santo Domingo
has lately been the scene of revolution, folio wine a
long period of tranquillity. It began with the kllllns;
of President Heureaux, In July last, and culminated
loathe relinquishment by the succeeding vice presi
dent Of the reins of government to the Insurgents.
The first act ot the provisional gorernment was the
calling of a presidential and constituent election.
Juan Isldro Jlmlnez, having been elected president,
was Inaugurated on the 14th of November. Relations
have been entered into with the newly established
gorernment.
Central American Republics.
The experimental association of Nicaragua, Hon
duras and Salvador, under the title of the Greater
Republic of Central America, when apparently on the
threshold of a complete federal organization by the
adoption of a constitution and the formation of a
national legislature, was disrupted In the last days
of November, 1S9S, by the withdrawal of Salvador.
Thereupon Nicaragua and Honduras abandoned the
Joint compact, each resuming its former Independent
sovereignty. This was followed by the reception ot
Minister Merry by the republics of Nicaragua and
Salvador, while Minister Hunter, In turn presented
his credentials to the government of Honduras, thus
reverting to the old distribution of the diplomatic
agencies ot the United States In Central America for
which our existing statutes provide. A Nlcaraguan
envoy has been accredited to the United States.
An Insurrectionary movement, under General Reyes,
broke out at Bluefields In February last, and for a
time exercised actual control of the Mosquito terri
tory. The Detroit was promptly sent thither for the
protection of American Interests. After a few weeks,
the Reyes government renounced the conflict, clvlng
place to the restored supremacy of Nicaragua. During
the interregnum certain public dues accruing under
Nlcaraguan law were collected irom American mer
chants by the authorities for the time being in ef
fective administrative control. Upon the titular gov.
ernment regaining power a second payment of these
dues was demanded. Controversy arose touching the
validity of the original payment of the debt to the
do facto regent ot the territory. An arrangement wa-j
effected in April last by the United States minister
and the foreign secretary ot Nicaragua whereby the
amounts of the duplicate payments were deposited
with the British consul pending an adjustment of
the matter by direct agreement between the govern'
meats of the United States and Nicaragua. The con
troversy Is still unsettled.
A nleaslng Incident in the relations ot this gov
ernment with that of Chile occurred In the generous
assistance given to the warship Newark when In dis
tress In Chilean waters. Not alone In this way lias
the friendly disposition of Chile found expression.
That country baa acceded to the convention for the
establishment of a bureau ot American republics. In
which organization every Independent state of the
continent now shares.
The exchange of ratifications of a convention for the
revival of the United States and Chilean claims coin-
mission and for the adjudication of claims heretofore
presented but not determined during the life of the
previous commission has been delayed by reason of
the necessity for fresh action by the Chilean senate
upon the amendments attached to the ratification ot
the treaty by tne inttei states senate. This for
mality Is soon to be accomplished.
TRADE FIELD IN CHINA.
Appointment of Commission to Inves
tigate and Report on It
Recommended.
In view ot disturbances in the populous provinces
of Northern China, where are many ot our citi
zens, and of the Imminence of disorder near the
capital and toward the seaboard, a guard of ma
rines was landed from tbe Boston and stationed
during last winter In the legation compound at
Peking. "With the restoration of order this pro
tectlon was withdrawn.
The Interests of our citizens In that vast empire
have not been neglected during the past year. Ade
quate protection has been secured for our mis
sionaries and some Injuries to their property bare
been redressed.
American capital has sought and found various op
portunities of competing to carry out the Internal
improvements which the imperial government Is
wisely encouraging, and to develop tbe natural re.
sources ot the empire. Our trade with China has
continued to grow, and our commercial rights un-

In my message io congress of December 5. 1SW.
I urged that the recommendation which had been
made to the speaker of the house of representatives
by the secretary of the treasury on the 14th of
June, 1SSS. for an appropriation for a commission to

THE PAWSTXPOSITION.
Mr. McKlnley Thinks United States
Will lie Well and Profitably
Represented.
The death or President Faure in February las
called forth thofe sincere expressions of sympathy
which befit the relations of to republic, as closely
allied by unbroken historic ties as are the United
States and France. , , .
Preparations for the representation cf the Indus
tries, arts and products of the United States at the
world's exposition, to be held In Paris next yea-,
continue on an elaborate and comprehensive wale,
thanks to the generous appropriation provided by
congress and to the friendly Interest the French
govertment has khown In furthering a typical exhibit
of American progress.
There has been allotted to the United States a
considerable addition cf space, which, while placing
our country In the first rank among exhibitors, does
not sulfice to meet the Irtcreaslnglv urgent demands
of our manufacturers. The efforts or the commis
sioner general are ably directed toward a strictly
representative display of all that most characteristic
ally marks American achievement in the inventive
arts and most adequately shows the excellence or our
natural Deductions.
In this age of keen rivalry among nations for
mastery in commerce, the doctrine oi evoiuuoT ana
the rule of the survival of the Attest must be as in
exorable in their operation as they are positive In
the results the bring about. The place won In the
struggle by an industrial people can only be held
by unrelated endeavor and constant advance In
achievement. The present extraordinary Impetus In
every line of American exportation and the as
tounding increase In the volume and value of our
si are in the world's markets may not be attributed
to accidental conditions
The reasons are net far to seek. They He deep In
our national character and find expression year by
year in every branch of handicraft. In every new
device whereby the materials we so abundantly pro
duce are subdued to the artisan's will and made to
yield the largest, most practical and most bcnenciai
returns. The American exhibit at Paris should, and
I am confident will, be an open volume, whole les
sons or skillfully directed endeavor, unfaltering en
ergy and consummate performance may be read by
all on every page, thus spreading abroad a clearer
knowledge of tbe worth of our productions and the
justice of our claim to an Important place tn the
marts of the world. To accomplish this by judicious
selection, by recognition of paramount merit in
whatever wallr of trade and manufacture It may ap
pear, and by orderly classification and attractive
installation, is the task of our commission.
The United States government building is ap
proaching completion, and no effort will be spared
to make It worthy, in beauty of architectural plan
and in completeness of display, to represent our na
tion. It has been suggested that a permanent build
ing of similar or appropriate design be erected on a
convenient site, already given by the municipality,
near the exposition grounds, to serve in commemor
ation of the part taken by this country in this great
enterprise, as an American national institute, for
our countrymen resortirg to Paris for study.
I am informed by our commissioner general that
we shall have In the American sections at Paris
over 7,000 exhibitors, from every state in our coun
try, a number ten times as great as those which
were represented at Vienna In 1S73, six times as
many as those in Paris In 1878 and four times as
many as those who exhibited in Paris In 1S89. This
statement does not include the exhibits from either
Cuba, Porto Rico or Hawaii, for which arrange
ments have been made.
A number of important international congresses on
special topics affecting public Interests are proposed
to be held In Paris next summer in connection with
the exposition. Effort will be made to have the
several technical branches of our administration ef
ficiently represented at those conferences, each in
Its special line, ard to procure the largest possible
concourse of state representatives, particularly at
the congresses of public charity and t medicine.
VERY FRIENDLYWITH GERMANY
Onr Relations, Says the President.
Continue to De Mont
Cordial.
Our relations with Germany continue to be most
cordial. The Increasing Intimacy of direct associ
ation has been market! during the year by the
granting permission in April for the landing on our
shores of a cable from Borkum Emden. on the North
sea, by way of tbe Azores and also by tbe couctuslon
on September 2 of a parcels post convention with
the German empire.
In all that promises, closer relations
of Intercourse and commerce and a
better understanding between two
races bavins- so many traits In com
mon, Germany can be assured of the
most cordial co-operation of this gov
ernment and people.
We may be rivals in many material paths, but
our rivalry should be generous and open, ever aim
ing toward the attainment of larger results and the
mutually beneficial advancement of each In the
line of Its especial adaptability.
The several governments of the empire seem re
luctant to admit the natural excellence of our food
products and to accept the evidence we constantly
tender of the care with which their purity Is guarded
by rigid Inspection from the farm, through the
slaughter house and the packing establishments,
to the port of shipment. Our svstem of control over
exported food staples invites examination from any
quarter, and challenges respect by Its efficient thor
oughness. It Is to be hoped that in time the two govern
ments will act in common accord toward tbe re
alization of their common purpose to safeguard the
public health, and to the Insuring of tho purity
and wholesomeness ot all food products Imported
by either country from the other. Were the con
gress to authorize an Invitation to Germany, In
accordance with the pending reciprocity negotiations,
for the constitution of a Joint commission of scien
tific experts and practical men of affairs to conduct
a searching Investigation of food production and
exportation In both countries and report to their
respective legislatures for the adoption of such
remedial measures as they might recommend- for
either, the way might be opened for the desirable
result Indicated.
Efforts to obuin for American life insurance com
panies a full hearing as to their business operation
in Prussia have after several years of patient rep
resentatlon happily succeeded and one of the roost
important American companies has been granted a
concession to continue business In that kingdom.
I am also clad to announce that the German in
surance companies have been readmitted by tho
superintendent of Insurance to do business In the
state of New York.
Subsequent to the exchange of our peace treaty with
Spain, Germany acquired the Caroline Islands by
purchase, paying therefor 15,000,000. Assurances have
been received from the German government that the
rights of American missionaries and traders there will
be considerately observed.

"We Have Remained Faltbfnl to the
Precept of Avoiding Bntanffllnfr
Alllances."
In my last annual message X referred to the pend
ing negotiations with Great Britain in respect to the
Dominion ot Canada. By means of an executive
agreement, a joint high commission had been cre
ated for the purpose of adjusting all unsettled ques
tions between the United States and Canada, em
bracing twelve subjects, among which were the ques
tions ot the fur seals, the fisheries ot the coast and
mntltrnous inland -waters, the Alaskan boundary.
the transit of merchandise In bond, the alien labor
laws, mining rights, reciprocity in trade, revision
of the agreement respecting naval vessels in the
Great lakes, a more complete marking of parts of
the boundary, provision for the conveyance of
criminals, and for wrecking and salvage,
iluch nrocress had been made by the commission
toward the adjustment of many ot these questions
where It became apparent that an Irreconcilable
difference of views was entertained respecting the
delimitation of the Alaskan boundary. In the failure
of an agreement as to the meaning ot articles 3 and
4 of the treaty of 1825, between Russia and Great
Britain, which defined the boundary between Alaska.
and Canada, the American commissioner! proposed
that the subject ot the boundary be laid aside and
that the remaining questions of difference be pro
ceeded with, some of which were so far advanced as
to assure the probability ot a settlement. This
being declined by the British commissioners, an ad
journment was. taken until the boundary should be
adjusted by the two governments. The subject has
been receiving tbe careful attention which Its Im
portance demands, with the result that a modus
Vivendi for provisional demarcations In the region
about the head of Lynn canal lias been agreed upon;
and It Is hoped that the negotiations now In progress

TO PROTECT FOREIGNERS.
It Is Urcred That Federal Courts Have
Jurisdiction Where Personal
nights Are Involved.
For the fourth time In the present decade, ques
tion has arisen with 'tbe government of Italy in re
gard to the lynching of Italian subjects. Tb- latest
of these deplorable events occurred at Tallulah, La ,
thereby five unfortunates of Italian origin were
taken from Jail and hanged.
The authorities of the state and a representative of
the Italian embassy having separately Investigated
the occurrence, with discrepant results, particularly
as to tbe alleged citizenship ot the victims, and It
net appearing that the stale had been able to discover
and punish the violators, cf the law, an Independent
Investigation has been set on foot through the agency
of the dpanirent of state, and is still In progress.
The re-n.lt 111 enable the executive to treat the
question with the government of Italy In a spirit
of fairness and justice. A satisfactory solution will
doubtIe& be ieached.
The recurrence of these distressing manifestations
of blind mob fury directed at dependents or native
of a foreign country suggests that the contingency
uas arisen ior action oy congress in tne direction of
conferring upon the federal courts jurisdiction In
this clasi ot international cases nhere the ultimate
responsibility of the federal gorernment may be in
volved. Tbe suggestion is not new. In his annual
message of December 9, 1391, m predecessor. Presi
dent Harrison, said:
"It would, I believe, be entirely competent for
congress to make o Cense a against the treaty rights
of foreigners domiciled In the United States cogniz
able In the federal court-. This has not. however,
been done, and the federal officers and courts have no
power In such cass to Intervene either for the pro
tection of a foreign citizen or for the punishment of
bis slayers. It sceirs to ne to follow. In this state
of the law, that the officers of the state charged
with police and Judicial powers in such cases mut.
In the consideration of International questions grow
ing out of such incidents, be regarded in such sense
as federal agents as to make this government an
swerable for their acts In cases where It would be
answerable If the United States had ued Its con
stitutional power to define and punish crimes against
treaty rights " '
A bill to provIJe for the punishment of violations
of treaty rights cf aliens was introduced In the senate
March 1. 1883, and reported ravorably March 30. Hav
ing doubtless in view the language of that part of
article ill of the treaty of February 26. 1S7I. be
tween the United States and Italyn which stipulates
that "the citizens ot each of the high contracting
parties sfasll receive. In the states and territories of
the other, most constant protection and security for
their persons and property and shall enjoy In this
respect the same rights and privileges as are ot
shall be granted to the natives, on their submitting
themslveB to the conditions Imposed upon the na
tives,' the bill so introduced and reported pro
vided that any act committed In any state or terri
tory of the United States in violation ot the rights
of a citizen or subject ot a foreign country secured
to such citizen or subject by treaty between the
United States and such foreign country and con
stituting a crime under the laws of the state or ter
ritory shall constitute a like crime against the
United States and be cognizable In the federal
courts. No action was taken by congress In the
matter.
I earnestly recommend that the subject be taken
up anew and acted upon during tbe present sesalon.
The necessity for some such provision abundantly
appears. Precedent for constituting a federal juris
diction In criminal cases where aliens are sufferers
is rationally deduclble from the existing statute
which gives to the district and circuit courts of the
United States jurisdiction of civil suits brought by
aliens where the amount Involved exceeds a certain
sum. If such jealous solicitude be shown for alien
rights in cases of merely civil and pecuniary import,
how much greater should be the public duty to take
cognizance of matters affecting the life and the rights
of aliens under the settled principles of International
law no less than under treaty stipulation. In cases
of such transcendent wrong doing as mob murder,
especial 1 when experience has show n that local
justice la too often helpless to punish the offenders.
After many years of endeavor on the part of this
government to that end. the Italian government has
consented to enter Into negotiations for a naturali
zation convention, having for one of Its objects tbe
regulation of the status of Italians (except those of
an age for active military service) who. having been
naturalized in tbe United States, may revisit Italj.
It is hoped that, with the mutually conciliatory
spirit displayed, a successful conclusion will be
reached.
NEW TREATY WITH JAIPAN.
President Reports That It Is Working
"Well Pacific Cable Recommen
dation Renewed.
The treaty ot commerce end navigation between
the United States and Japan on November 3, 1S94,
took effect in accordance with the terms of its 13th
article on the 17th of July last, simultaneously with
the enforcement of like treaties with the other1
powers, except France, whose convention did not go
into operation until August -t, the United States be
ing, however, granted up to that date all the prlvl
leges and rights accorded to French citizens under
the old French treaty. By this notable conventional
reform Japan's position as a fully Independent sov
ereign power Is assured, control being gained of taxa
tion, customs revenues. Judicial administration.
coasting trade and all other domestic functions ot
government, and foreign extra-territorial rights be
ing renounced.
Comprehensive codes of civil and criminal pro
cedure according to Western methods, public in
struction, patents and cop rights, municipal admin
istration. Including jurisdiction over the former for
eign settlements, customs tariffs and procedure, pub
lic health and other administrative measures have
been proclaimed. The working of the new system
has given rise to no material complaints on the part
or the American citizens or interests, a circum
stance which attests the ripe consideration with
which tbe change has been prepared.
Valuable assistance was rendered by the Japanese
authorities to the United States transport ship Mor
gan City while stranded' at Kobe. Permission has
been granted to land and pasture army horses at
Japanese ports of call on the way to the Philippine
Islands. These kindly erldences of good will are
highly appreciated.
The Japanese government has shown a lively In
terest In the proposition of the Pacific Cable Company
to add to Its projected cable lines to Hawaii, Guam
and the Philippines a branch connecting with the
coast of Japan. It would be a gratifying consum
mation were the utility of the contemplated scheme
enhanced by bringing Japan and the United States
Into uirert telegraphic relation.
Without repeating the observations of my special
message of February 10, ls99, concerning the necessi
ty of a cable to Manila, I respectfully invite atten
tion to It.
I recommend that In case the congress should not
take measures to bring about this result by tbe direct
action of the government, tne postmaster general be
authorized to Invite competitive bids for the estb-
llebment ot a cable; the company making the best
responsible bid to be awarded tne contract; tne
successful company to give ample bonds to lnure tbe
completion ot the work within a reasonable time.

tend to accomplish the desire of both governments
that grave crimes go not unpinlhed, but also to
repress lawlessness along the border of the two coun
tries. Tbe new treaty stipulates that neither gov

of crimes committed exclusively within tbe territory

THE SAMPAN SETTLEMENT.
United States Got All That She Cared
For In the Final
Division.
Important events have occurred in the Samoan Isl
ands. The election, according to the laws and customs
of Samoa, of a successor to the late King Mai U to
Laupepa. developed a contest as to the validity of
tbe result, which Issue, by the terms of the general
act, was to be decided by the chief Justice. Upon
his rendering a judgment in favor ot Malletoa
Tanu. the rival chief, Mataafa, took up arms. The
active Intervention of American and British warships
became Imperative to restore order, at tbe cost ot
sanguinary encounters. In this emergency a joint
commission or representatives cf the United States,
Germany and Great Britain was sent to Samoa, to
investigate the situation and provide a temporary
remedy. By Its active effort a peaceful solution
wa.-i reached for the time being, the kingship being
abolished and a provisional government established.
Recommendations unanimously made by the com
mission for a permanent adjustment ot the Samoan
question were taken under consideration by the
three powers parties to the general act. But the
more they were examined the more evident It became
that a radical change was neccessary In the relations
of tt powers to Samoa.
The Inconveniences and possible perils ot the tri
partite scheme ot supervision and control in the
Samoan group by powers having little Interest in
common In that quarter beyond commercial rivalry
has been once more emphasized by the recent events.
The sugge-ned remedy of the joint commission, like
the scheme it aimed to replace, amounted to what
has been styled a trl dominium, being the exercise
of the functions of sovereignty by a unanimous
agreement of three powers. The situation had be
come far more Intricate and embarrassing from every
point ot view than ft was when my predecessor la
1S34 summed up Its perplexities and condemned the
participation In It of the United States.
The arrangement under which Samoa was admin
istered had proved impracticable and unacceptable
to all the powers concerned. To withdraw from the
agreement and abardoa the Islands to Germany
and Great Britain would not be compatible with our
interests in the archipelago. To relinquish our
rights in tbe harbor of Pago Pago, the best anchor-
ace in the Pacific, the occupancy ot which bad been
leased to the United State In 1S7S by the first
foreign treaty ever concluded by Samoa, was not to
be thought of either as regards the needs of our
nary or the Interests of our growing commerce with
tbe East. We could not have considered any prop
osition for the abrogation of the tripartite control
which did not confirm us In all our rights and safes-nerd
all our national interests In the Islands.
Our views commended tbemselve3 to the other
powers. A satisfactory arrangement was concluded
between tbe governments of Germany and of England,
by virtue cf which England retired from Samoa In
view of compensations in other directions, and both
powers renounced in favor ot the United States ail
their rights and claims over and in respect to that
portion ot the group lying to the east of the one
hundred and seventy-first degree or west longitude,
embracing the Islands of Tutulla. Ofoo. Olosenga and
Manua. I transmit to the senate, for Its constitu
tional action thereon, a convention, which besides
the provisions above mentioned also guarantees u-j
the same privileges and conditions in respect to
commerce and commercial vessels In all of the
Islands of Samoa as these possessed by Germany.
Claims have been preferred by white residents ot
Samoa on account of. injuries alleged to have been
suffered through the acts ot the treaty governments
In outline down the late disturbances. A convention
has been made between the three power for the
investigation and settlement of these claims by a
neutral arbitrator, to wnich tne attention of the
senate will be Invited.

Diplomatic Relation Reviewed.
Following the exchange ot ratifications ot the
treaty of peace the two governments accredited
ministers to each other, Spain sending to 'Washington
the Duke ot Arcos, an eminent diplomatist, pre
viously stationed In Mexico, while the United States
transferred to Madrid Hon. Bellamy Storer. Its
minister at Brussels. This was followed by the
respective appointment ot consuls, thereby fully re
suming the relations Interrupted by the war. la
addition to Its consular representation In the United
States, the Spanish government has appointed con
sals for Cuba, who have been provisionally recog
nized during the military administration ot tle
affairs ot that Island.
Judicial Intercourse between the courts of Cuba,
and Porto Rico and ot Spain has been established.

Negotiations are about to be had for defining the

which tell Into abeyance by reason of tbe war. I
trust that those will Include a favorable arrange
ment for commercial reciprocity under the termt
of sections 3 and 4 of the current tariff act. In
these, as in all matters ot International concern, no
effort will be spared to respond to the good dispo
sition cf Spain, and to cultivate In all practicable
ways the Intimacy which should prevail between
two nations whose past history bas so often and in
so many ways been marked by sincere friendship
and by community of interests.
I would recommend appropriate legislation in order
to carry Into execution article VII. of the treaty
of peace with Spain, by which tne United State
assured the payment of certain claims for Indemnity
of its citizens against Spain.
SULTAN IS TROUBLESOME.
Situation of American Cltlxenn In
Turkish Empire Remains. Cn-
atlMlactorjr.
The United States minister to Turkey continue,
under Instructions, to press for a money payment
In satisfaction of Its claims for Injuries suffered by
American citizens in the disorders of several yearj
put and for wrongs done to them by the Ottoman
authorities. Some of these claims are of many
years' standing. This government is hopeful ot a
general agreement in thla regard.
In the Turkish empire the situation of our citizens
remains unsatisfactory. Our efforts during nearly
forty years to bring about a convention of natural
ization seem to be on the brink; of final failure
through the announced policy of the Ottoman gprte
to refuse rercgnltlon of the alien status of native
Turkish subjects naturalized abroad since 1SC7. Ou
statutes do not allow this gorernment to admit any
distinction between the treatment of natlTe and
naturalised Americans abroad, so that ceaseless con
troversy arises In cues where persons owing in tbe
eye ot international law a dual allegiance are pre
vented from entering Turkey or are expelled alter
entrance. Our law In this regard contrasts with
that ot the European states. The British act. rr
Instance, does not claim effect for the naturalization
or an alien In the event of his return to bis native
country, unless the change be recognized by the law
of that country, or stipulated br treaty between it
and tbe naturalizing state.
The arbitrary treatment. In acme Instances, of
American productions in Turkey has attracted at
tention ot late, notably Is regard to our Sour. Large
shipments by the recently opened direct steamship
line to Turkish porta have been denied entrance on
the score that, although of standard composition and
unquestioned purity, the Sour was pernicious to
neslth because of deficient "elasticity" as indicated
by antiquated and untrustworthy tests. Upon due
protest by the American minister, and It appearing
that tbe act was & virtual discrimination agalnu
our product, the shipments in Question were admitted.
In these, as in all Invtances. wherever occurring,
when Amerlcaa products may be subjected in a
foreign country, upon specious pretexts, to discrim
ination compared with the like products of another
country, this government will use Its earnest efforts
to secure fair and equal treatment for Its citizens
and their goods. Falling this, it will not hesitate
to apply whatever corrective may be provided by tb
statutes.
Tbe International commission of arbitration, ap
pointed under the Anglo-Venezuelan treaty of 197,
rendered an award on October Z Iasu whersby the
boundary line between Venezuela and British Galana
la determined, thus ending a controversy which bas
existed for the greater part of tbe century. Tbi
award, as to which tbe arbitrators were unanimous.
while not meeting the extreme contention ot either
party, gives to Great Britain a Urg shire of the
Interior territory In dispute and to Venezuela the
entire month ot the Orinoco, Including Bart ma Point
and tbe Caribbean Littoral for some distance to the
eastward. The decision appears to be equally satis
factory to both parties.
Venezuela has onee more undergone a revntatloa.
