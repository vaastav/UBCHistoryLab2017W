MASTER OF GARNERED MILLIONS
IT is a remarkable fact that on June 30 of this year the Union
Pacific Railroad Company had $55,968,882 ready cash in its treas
ury. So much appears from the annual report of the company
issued last week.
This astounding sum is far greater than the big life insurance
companies have been accustomed to keep on hand.
Where did it come from? Well, chiefly from the sale of North
ern Pacific and Great Northern stocks that Harriman bought for the
Union Pacific in 1901. when he sought to gain control of the system
then and now held by James J. Hill and Pierpont Morgan. Harri
man's raid failed, and having failed he has no further use for the
stock. In his view corporation stocks are useful only as a means
to get control of the operation, physical and financial. It is- in the
operation of great plants, the handling of big contracts and valuable
patronage, and. above all, in the power to rig the stock market, that
the vast fortunes are made. For instance, the positive informa
tion that Southern Pacific would declare a 5 per cent dividend and
Union Pacific 10 per cent was worth a fortune to any one who knew
it six months ago. Harriman knew it. and so did a few of his fa
vored friends.
The money that Harriman 'paid for the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific stocks was borrowed on bonds secured on the
Oregon Short Line and other Union Pacific properties. Therefore
the money realized on the sale of these stocks was, in fact*' borrowed.
It need not be supposed, therefore, that Harriman will pay it back.
Not at all; he will, continue to pay the interest, and keeps the
principal to buy more railroads. The report does not say what
specific disposition was made of the m&iiey. but adds that "since the
close of the fiscal year it has been applied in the construction of new
lines and to the acquisition of other property."
These facts serve to explain the marvelous and widespread finan
cial activity of Harriman. and indicate his methods of operation. We
hear of his purchase of the Chicago subways, of the Salt Lake and
Los Angeles electric road by way of casual operations on the side.
Then we learn that he has bought control of the great Baltimore and
Ohio system, and there is nothing improbable in that. We know
from the figures of record that he has had control of $55,000,000 of
ready cash belonging to the Union Pacific. . We know that he
handles a $20,000,000 surplus belonging to Wells. Fargo & Co., and
whatever the surplus of the Southern Pacific Company, that, like
wise, is his to control.
Union Pacific is. of course, the foundation of his fortune. He
reorganized that company in 1893 and got control. With the
arrival of prosperity the road began to make money hand over fist.
The security became so good that Harriman was able to borrow vast
sums on the company's bonds. With that borrowed money he
bought control of the Southern Pacific and came near taking in the
Hill system. He has made a colossal fortune by handling other
people's money, and is now in control of 27,000 miles of railroad. If
there are any more railroads to sell he is ready to buy them. If
the money is not .ready to his hand in some great accumulation of sur
plus he can always borrow it by a further issue of bonds secured on
Union Pacific or Southern Pacific properties.'
There is no reason why this process of absorption should not go
on indefinitely, and, in fact, it is certain to go on until the whole
railroad system of the country is concentrated in two or three hands,
or ultimately, perhaps, in one ownership. It is obvious, moreover,
that the process will not stop with railroads.
THE DELEGATION AND THE DRAWBACK
WE beg to draw the attention of the California delegation in
Congress to the plank in the Republican platform on which
they were elected, reading as follows:
, We favor, the enactment by Congress of an amendment to the
existing tariff law providing, as a measure of relief in San Francisco, that
for the period of three years all building material may be admitted into that
port free of all duty. r •\u25a0>\u25a0
Representative Kahn treacherously opposed the passage of a
bill exempting from duty materials for San Francisco when it was
offered last session, and made a silly argument against it. Other
members of the delegation followed his lead. Mr. Kahn now has
an opportunity to repair his , bad faith to. the city he represents.
The platform of his party is mandatory, and even if there were
nothing of the kind, in the document, common honesty to his con
stituents would dictate his duty to. forward the interests of San
Francisco.
We may be allowed to hope in the same relation that the eminent
publicist and aspiring statesman, Mr. M. H. de Young, will untwist
his legs on this ground. Let him make up his statesmanlike -mind
and tellus on which side of the question he elects to stand; We
realize that with his extensive ' knowledge of economic theories
dragging him one way and his pocket viciously hauling in an opposite
direction, the selection of a course must be agonizing, but We are
ready to bet on the pocket in this distressing tug of war.
A DOUBTFUL CONFLICT
THE most important undeveloped coal and oii fields in the
United States arc locatedjn \Vypmirig. Their extent is^well
defined,, and the Government is miking air attempt to reserve
them for the use of future generations.; Whether this-endeavor
shall prove succ;essfHl or a failure" depends on the strength of a
triple conspiracy between the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio
EDITORIAL PAGE
Grande and the Standard Oil trust — -that is to say, Harriman, Gould
and Rockefeller.
With the purpose >of preventing monopoly of undeveloped coal
and oil beds, Secretary Hitchcock, by executive order* recently with
drew from entry 6,000,000 acres of land" in the Rocky Mountain
tier of States. A large part of the reserved lands is in Wyoming,
where these three big corporations have been especially active in
locating fraudulent claims. The' Interstate Commerce Commission
has been engaged in the investigation of these' frauds, ; and prosecu
tions are certain to follow, as well as suits to set aside the entries.
It nee<d not be supposed that the fight will' be won easily/ .The
political power of the great triple combination; is vast. and wide
spread. Itis hinted that Senator Warren of Wyoming uses his
influence in promotion, of Union Pacific interests.- We know how it
is with California and Nevada Senators, and we are not ignorant of
the influences that control Senatorial elections in other States. So
when it is announced that the national executive is engaged in a
struggle with the wealthy and powerful triple alliance of corpora
tions named there seems, reason to regard the' result as doubtful.

From Foreign Mines Conies
Metal for Our Nickels
THE only. real competitor of On
tario as a nickel producer is the
French penal colony, New Cale
donia, in. the South Seas, says Pro
fessor A. P. 1 Coleman In a report pre
pared for the Ontario bureau of mines.
Though the United States has dropped
out of the race as a producer of nickel
ore, It is still one of the most impor
tant - countries for the refining and
utilization of the metal nickel, much
the greater part of the Canadian metal
being treated at Constable Hook. N. J.
The Sudbury nickel field has long
been known as the most important
source of that metal in America, if not
in the world, but the work of the last
three years has brought out more and
more strikingly the unique character
of this mining region. It has been
proved that all the ore deposits of any
economic Importance are at or near
the outer margin of a huge lacco
lithic sheet of eruptive rock a mile
and a quarter thick, thirty-six miles
long and seventeen wide. This sheet
is now in the form of a boat-shaped
syncline, with . its pointed end to the
; southwest and its square end to the
northeast. The rock composing this
! sheet is norite at the outer and lower
edge, merging . into granite or grano
diorite at; the inner (upper) edge. The
ore bodies are round the margin of
the norite or ' along dikelike offsets
from it and have evidently segregated
from the rock while still molten, though
they may have undergone later rear
rangement by circulating water.
In a chapter devoted to the uses of
nickel it is pointed out that Switzer
land, Austria-Hungary and France
within the last few years have adopt
ed *pure nickel Instead of the nickel
copper alloy for their coinage. The
pure metal does not tarnish or change
Golden Fruit Ripens Earlier in
Northern Citrus Belt
THE orange groves of Northern
California are scenes of Intense
activity Just now. as the picking
season is at its height and the
golden fruit Is already being shipped
to different parts of the East for
market. There are thousands of peo
ple in California who are not aware
that citrus fruits ripen much earlier
in the northern part of the State than
they do in the southern part, and the
oranges that are early sent to the
market are supposed to come from
south of the Tehachapl. And if the
people of the State where the fruit
is grown are ignorant of these im
portant facts, what shall we say of the
people of the East to which the fruits
are shipped? • * • There are few
people in the East who know that
citrus fruits are grown in Northern
California. The reason for this is
that Los Angeles has been in the lime
light-so long as an advertiser than it
has made the Eastern people think
that it Is the only part of the State
producing citrus fruits. When the
north :;.will advertise its products as
freely, persistently and consistently as
the people of "the south have done this
section will be better known and the
