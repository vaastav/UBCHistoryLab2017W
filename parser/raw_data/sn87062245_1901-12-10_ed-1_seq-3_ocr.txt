SUBJEff OF A SPECIAL MESSAGE
President will Commituicato tho
Terms of tlio Proposed Gift -Senator
Dopow Introduces a BUI to
Establish a National University
In Washington
President Roosevelt will send to Con
crcsB a special message Including in It
a letter recently written to liim by An
drew Carnegie In which lie proposes to
gle IUIpOIouu to the American people as
a fund for the cstabliihmcnt of a college
of higher education In this city
Before writing his letter Mr Carnegie
consulted the presidents cf various great
American collegit including Or Elliot of
Harvard Dr Giiman of Johns Hopkins
and Trot Andrew D White of Cornell
the present Ambassador to German At
a recent White House luncheon tie de
tails d the proposition were discussed
and met with general approval
Mr Cnrntsleh Proportion
Ilr Carnegies idea in a general way Is
to turn this sum of money over to the
United States Government to bo held in
trust for tLc maintenance and operation
of the proposed college just as the funds
that maintain the Smithsonian Institution
are now bandied
It is not to be a national university
The Government Is to be in no way con
nected with it except to take care of the
money and to be represented by a board
of regents such as now controls the af
falrsof the Smithsonian Institution found
ed by James Smlthson with a gift of
1 000000 to be used In the diffusion or
scientific knowledge
If Mr Carnegies gift is accepted by
Congress It will mean the end of the long
talked of projKr for the establishment in
Washington of a national unlvcreity as
recommended by George Washington and
by nany other distinguished people since
bis time
A School fur Higher nducntlon
The institution that Mr Carnegie bus in
mind is in no sense r national university
It Is rather a school for the teaching of
the higher branches of scientific educa
tion and intended to be supplemental to
the great colleges throughout the United
States
The details of the plan are set forth in
Mr Carnegies letter and very few pcr
Eons in Washington are acquainted with
them One cr two ot the loading men of
the Senate and House have been scuai
cj on the subject and faor Mr Carnegies
plans wmrre sd to be wise practical

Senator Tryc yesterday Introduced his
ship subsidy bill The measure Is now In
an accessible position on the calendar
Tho new measure differs radically from
the former bounty bills In that it is
shorter and simpler It is divided Into
four titles and fifteen sections and con
tains about 2700 words
The new bill docs not provide American
registry for foreign ships owned by
Americans It makes no distinction be
tween fast and slow steamers except as
the former may obtain mall contracts un
der the act ot 1S91 It contains no spe
cific requirement for export cargo on tho
ground that it would be a violation or at
tempted evasion of treaties with tho
United States and further on the ground
that it Is unnecessary because the subsidy
rate Is so low lhat ample export cargo
must be carried in order to avoid loss
Kor n Itirel tmerlcnn MtvIcc
The flrsttitlc Ocean Mall Steamships
is devoted to amendments to the ocean
mall act of 1S91 Under tho bill the
Postmaster General Is required to con
sider the national defence and the marl
time interests of the United States as
well as postal Interests In providing for
the transportation of American ocean
malls Tho purpose or this amendment Is
to free the United States rrom depend
ence upon British German and French
auxiliary cruisers Tor its ocean mall ser
vice and to substitute a purely American
Ejslcm
The present limit of ocean mall con
tracts ten j cars Is increased to fifteen
years to correspond with tho limit of
the recent German and French contracts
The present obsolete and unscientific
classification of mall steamers provides
only four classes 20 knot steamers of
8000 tons lG knot steamers of 5000 tons
14 knot steamers of 1500 tons and 12
knot wooden steamers of 1500 tons The
new bill provides sev u distinct classes
and is based on the progress of ship
building and mail requirement abroad
during the past ten jears
2Vfi ClnNltipntlon find Itntrs
Corresponding with the new classifica
tion in vessels arc changes la the rates
of mall pay The present ratet J2 1
and 07 cents were fixed by tho House of
Representatives In 1S91 The bill passed
by the Senate that year fixed the rates
at J6 3 150 and Jl Experience uij
shown that the present rates are too low
for tbe faster mall steamers and too high
for the slower
The Pryc bill restores the old Senate
rate or JG for twenty knot steamers in
creasing from S000 to 10000 tons tho
minimum size and the rate of 3 for
steamers provided the size Is
Increased from 5000 tons the present
minimum to 8000 tons the modern Brit
ish and German mall size
Slow Steamer Dropped
The bill leaves at the present rates or
reduces mail pa for slower and smaller
steamers It drop3 altogether the obso
lete wooden steamer oi only twelve knots
as no longer eligible for ocean mall ser
vice The rules fixed by the bill are max
imum rates Mall contracts arc open to
competition and will be awarded at rates
as much below the maximum as will se
cure an American mall service
The proposed maximum mail rates per
gross ton per hundred nautical miles are
Over 10000 tons 20 knots 27 cents 19
knots 25 cents Over 5000 tons IS
knots 23 cents 17 knots 21 cents 16
knots 19 cents 15 knots 1 7 cents Over
2000 tons H knots 1 5 cents
Rates for mail steamers to tbe West
Indies Central America and Mexico can
not exceed 70 per cent of the maximum
rales on account of their shorter vojages
and smaller coal supply
One Cent Per Ton lor lOO tlllex
The second title General Subsidy
includes the general subsidy for all ves
sels steam or sail which are not under
mail contract This general subsidy U
uniform one cent per gross ton per one
hundred nautical miles for not exceeding
sixteen entries In one ear This amount
is sufficient according to the latest fig
ures to equalize the difference in Ameri
can eamens wages and in the cost of
buldlng ocean steamers in the United
States and Great Britain referred to In
President Roosevelts message and Sec
retarj Gages report
To promote the building of new ocean
vessels an additional allowance of one
fourth or a cent per gross ton Is made ror
five years Any vessel to receive the gen
eral subsidy must carry mails if required
must train In seamanship or engineering
one American south for each 1000 torn
The owner must agree to hold the vessel
the service of the Government if re
quired ror defence tbe pay for sucb serv
lc to tbe appraised by a representative of
the Government and of the owner These
requirements arc taken substantially rrom
the ocean mall act of Ulil
An vessel receiving subsidy must be
class A 1 and at least oce fourth of the
crew must be Americans
kmU Not Klltitlltl to Mount
A vessel going to a foreign port less
than 150 miles from the United States or
making Itss than half its vojage on salt
water Is not entitled to subsld Barges
canal beats tugboats and wrecking ves
sels are alio excluded
The thltd title Deep Sea Fisheries
provides an annual bounty of J2 a ton for
deep sea fishing vessels and of Jl a
month for American citizens when ci
gjged in deep sea flsherips
The fourth title General Provisions
provides that a vessel shall receive only
one form of subsidy and that a vessel
which has received a subsid shall not
be sold to a rorclgner except by consent
oT the Secretary of the Troasurj The
President shall deslgnato heads of de
partments to provide regulations to carry
out this bill
In lie 4nlled I p fler It eeN
An attempt will be made to call up the
bill as soon as the Senate reconvenes af
ter the holiday recess and tlm tight
which marked the close of the last ses
sion bids fair to be repented Tho Demo
crats have already organized to make an
effort to defeat the measure

Graccland Cemetery tract for a park and
matters of minor Import occupied tbe at
tention of the Northeast Washington Citi
zens Association at Its meeting 1 ist night
In the Northeast iTomple These matters
wore brought before tho assclatlou
through communications from other simi
lar bodies
A resolution was read which was re
cently adopted by the Cathedral Heights
Citizens Association relative to the run
ning of through cars over suburban roads
Into tbe city on a half hour schedule It
was also set forth In the resolution hat
the suburban roads maintain through the
diy a schedule of cars fifteen minutes
apart The matter was discussed and
formally endorsed
A member of the East End Association
was present and explained tho project of
utilizing the Graccland Cemetery tract
for a public park The property Is so sit
uated as to be peculiarly suitable ror a
park It appears to bo practically use
less tor any other parpose owing to the
position ot the streets Intersecting Mary
land Avenue which runs across the tract
diagonally
It was brought out In tho discussion
that the Mulligan Hill site known as
Mount Hamilton only a rew blocks away
is Included in the report of the Park
Commission as a public park For this
reason it was thought doubtful whether
the cemetery site could also be used ror
a park Tho project however was en
dorsed by vote or the association
Among the Items considered In tbe rou
tine ot the evening wero the supplying ot
scats to femalo clerks In department
stores the new union station street
lights on Maryland and Massachusetts
Avenues opening of New York Avenue to
tho Uladensburi Road and the assess
ment of real and personal property
The association also took action look
ing to the compulsory provision by the
stieet railway companies ot vestibuled
cars so as to protect the motormeti from
the cold and inclement weather A com
mittee of the association will advocate
legislation to this end before the District
committees In Congress

New York anarchists talked In Yiddish
before an assemblage of red flag follow
ers at Phoenix Hall last evening
Legislation against anarchism bo
said Is like trying to dam a rushing
stream No law ever Impeded the ad
vance of progress Anarchism Is no new
invention of ours It Is the primeval as
piration for rrccdom that only changes
its form at different periods of history
Why talk about being practical
he asked when there Is so much misery
and poverty in the world Why be prac
tical when there is no hope but In the
radical change
There are more anarchists all over the
vorld he asserted than anyone Im
agines Everywhere people arc tired of
governments and arc dors what they can
to evade the laws There Is not a capi
talists or merchant but who cheats the
Government ot taxes and tariffs
Lewis Gordon of South Boston said
that anarchists hail not been frightened
out of existence that thev were Juit as
much alive as ever that no power on
earth can crush them orstay the advance
of their sacred cause

Claim
Indisputable Evidence
You have road our oft ropeated statement In use for over 30 years It
was in the early sixties that Dr Pitchor first made use of the description now
universally known as Castoria With a record of over fifty under five years of age
out of every hundred deaths it was the AMBITION OF EVERT PHYSICIAN to
discover a remedy suitable for the ailments of infants and children that would
decrease this distressing mortality In Castoria that relief has been found
Let us take the statistics covering the deaths in the City of New York for
the past 30 years and here we find the benificent effects of a combination of drugs
excluding opiates and narcotics so long sought for namely CASTORIA
Of the total number of deaths in ew York City in 1870 50 per cent were
under five years of age in 1880 46 per cent in 1890 40 per cent in 1900 35
per cent only Just stop to think of it
Until 1897 no counterfeits or imitations of Castoria appeared on drug store shelves
but since that date Mr Fletcher has been called upon to suppress a number of these
frauds While the record for 1900 does not come down to our expectation it is
owing to the carelessness of mothers when buying Castoria The signature of Chas
H Fletcher is the only safeguard and he alone is authorized to use the doctors name

General Wood during his stay in Wash
ington was1 much in the company of the
President Scarcely a day passed without
the two tormer Rough Riders Wood was
the first colonel of the famous regiment
talcing long horseback rides together Both
are intrepid horsemen and probably were
somewhat disappointed that the cares ot
official life or the necessity ot attending
dinners compelled them to return to the
White House by T oclock nt the latest
One day last week when It rained al
most continuously for twenty four hours
the Presidents brougham was ordered at
3 30 in the afternoon Tho President and
General Wood roughly dressed and wear
ing long coats were driven away It was
7 oclock before they returned and when
the President nalked across the portico
to the door of the White House his shoes
looked as though be had Indulged la a
long tramp over muddy country roads
The President Is quite as rond of walk
ing as he Is or riding His endurance Is
such that he thinks little of a Qve mllc
tramp Although he Is not an extremely
fast walker he gets a large amount of
exercise from it His Is a short stride
but he sets his feet down hard swings
his arms vigorously and lets Ills body nnd
shoulders work easily from the hips
When the President comes In from a long
walk he never slackens his pace until
he passes through the door of the White
House
On such occasions he never wears un
overcoat In rnct he regards this gar
ment as superfluous as far as affording
comfort Is concerned To use a statement
he once made when Civil Service Com
missioner he doesnt think a man Is
much good who has not enough blood In
his veins to keep his body warm without
an overcoat
CHECK FOR STANDARD OIL
3ny Hell Mocrn Inlm Product lint
Cannot Control Outpnt
THE HAGUE Dec S A well known
financier said today that during two days
last week the shares of the Moera Enim
Company were well maintained but are
now dull There Is no reason to believe
that the Standard Oil Company is buying
the shares They would be ot no use to
that company because according to law
the seat ot the company must remain at
Amsterdam
A contract with the Moera Enim Com
pany would only give tho Standard Oil
Company control over the selling of tho
oil This possibly would not meet with op
position from the shareholders Neither
could such a contract be opposed by the
Government
Officials say however that the Minis
ters would never allow the tnnsfer of
the concession of the Moera Enim Com
pany to a foreign corporation The con
trol of the production of the oil by the
Standard Oil Company Is thus rendered
lnipo8ilbIe

mutely Kml Controvert
A lull has come In the factional contest
ror the control or the Republican party in
Missouri between R C Kerens national
committeeman and Secretary Hitchcock
The Preildcnt Is looking into the antece
dents and general political virtues ot
Charles F Wenekcr who has been rec
ommended tor the position of surveyor of
the rort of St Louis the point of conten
tion betrien the warring factions
The appointment of Mr Wenekcr who
has long been prominent In St Louis poll
tics will Le in the nature of a compro
mise It Is understood that Weneker had
tho recommendation of William Marlon
Reedy ot Sl Louis whom the President
called to Washington for a conference in
regard to tne Missouri situation While
the President is investigating the matter
lowever there Is llttlo likelihood that an
appolutment will be made
In the meantime It Is understood that
several candidates hoping that the Pres
ident n ay turn to a third party la Ms di
lemma are grooming for the place The
President haa much confidence In the
Judgment of Representative llarthjldt or
St Louis with whom he has several times
consulted In regard to the situation and
It is possible that Mr Bartholdt may
name a cindldate who will meet with the
Presidents approval Such action on the
par of the member from Missouri would
mean a turndown for tho Kerens fiction
Inasmuch as Bartholdt Is opposed to tho
national committeeman and his friends
