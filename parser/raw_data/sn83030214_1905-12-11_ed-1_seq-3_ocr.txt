REPORT ON POSTOFFICE.
THE DEFICIT $Uj572£84.
Mr. Cortelyou Shores That It Is
Caused by "Franking Evil."
Washington. Dec. 10.— Postmaster General Cortel
you in h:s annual report for the last fiscal year
gays that while a self-sustaining condition of the
j>ostofflce D«?i>artment would be gratifying, he la
j€*s concerned about the deficit than the efficiency
O f a<s- rr l strallon. For the fiscal year 1906 the total
i*e*:pts from all sources were $152,826,585 and total
expenditures J167.151.9c-9. leaving a deficit of
PU32JM.
In connection -with these figures the Postmaster
General directs attention to the increased amount
of free matter handled, which, he says, averaged
J2.5S per cent of the entire weight carried, or a lots
in revenue of $19,822,000. "Manifestly," he says,
•*&«<! the matter now carried free been required to
Ijave been prepaid, notwithstanding the large ex
penditures for the rural free delivery service, there
mold have teen no deficit."
Answering some of the criticisms which he sayt
have been directed against the postal service, h»
jays that much of It overlooks the unusual condi
tions existing in this country. Its great extent of
territory and its widely scattered population. With
the introduction of rural free delivery, as yet un
finished and other details of postal development In
complete, he thinks it la the part of wisdom to
proceed conservatively until the present service Is
more nearly perfected. "In other words," says he,
"it is believed that for the time being attention can
t« more profitably devoted to an improvement in
tie service already established than to an Im
mediate consideration of such questions as the re
duction of the rates of postage, a parcels post,
postal savings depositories, a postal telegraph and
telephone and kindred subjects."
REMEDY FOR FRAXKINQ EVIL. „
Km a remedy for the "franking evil," of which be
cD-p.a-.:.5. the Postmaster General suggests that
there are sound administrative reasons why It
would be better business policy for each department
to pay postage upon Its mall matter, according to
Its class, than to return to the practice of re
quiring government free matter to be prepaid by
cottage rtarnps in the same way as similar mat
ter mailed by the public The weight of opinion,
he says, is in favor cf the plan suggested, bo
modified as to eliminate the necessity of affixing
stamps, but maintaining the principle that each de
partment be charged with the whole expense of
conducting its business. He adds:
From this change there would come some great
advantages; the tendency to use the mails for mat
ter that ought to be otherwise transported would
be restrained; merchandise. Including heavy quan
tities of printed matter not requiring expeditious
haul!:.? would be cent by cheaper modes of con
veyance; only matter requiring expeditious de
liven- and on which the poFtage can be properly
paid." p.p for government business, would be sent

RATING FOR RSAPPOIXTAIENTa.
Discussing appointments of postmasters, the Post
master General ears that under instructions re
cently Issued a careful ratine, based on Inspectors'
reports. Is given to each postofflce. and that this
rating carries weight in determining the question
of rcappointaMßts. He says that fourth-class post
masters will be retained during satisfactory service,
white In the case of presidential postmasters their
reappo:ntment will be determined by the ratings
The Postmaster General speaks of New- York
Cltv as the great distributing point for the interna
tional mall service. The question of improvement
in the facilities in thaT and other cities is being
carefully considered. He states that the generally
accepted practice, both as to location and arrange
ment of poetoffices in these cities fails to give ade
quate facilities. The Ch.cago poetofflce. he says, is
lamentably dencient in certain essentials.
The work of purifying the mails, the report shows,
Is not confined to the suppression of frauds and
latteries, but includes as we.l the exclusion there
from of obscene, indecent, and scurrllious matter,
»cd the iranlabmeat of those found to have de
posited such matter for transmission. It adds that
a more strict enforcement of these statutes recently
las brought about highly gratifying results.
The work cf tne postofflce Inspectors is praised,
a -d the opinion Is oxpectod that many of them are
underpaid- A similar view is expressed with re
■peet to poataffice clerks and letter carriers, city
and rural.
Governmental control of the pneumatic tube ser
vice and mail wagon service is recommended, and
In the latter case an appropriation is asked to pur
chase wagons of approved pattern for carrying' the
mails.
NEEDS OF MAIL CLERKS.
An Increase of 5.77 per cent In the amount of
ordinary mail handled, as compared with 1&04, Is
noted la the railway mail service, which the Poet
majrter General says dhows a normal growth, with
gratifying maintenance of efficiency. In the year
12 clerk* were killed while on duty and 125
seriously Injured. Every effort, he cays, has been
made to surround the clerks with every possible
safeguard. The arduous and hazardous duties inci
dent 10 the service, he declares, call for some legis
lative action that will make provision for clerks
worn cut In the service and maintain its efficiency
by the gradual elimination of superannuated clerks.
The present method of determining the rates of
pay to transportation companies for carrying the
ma;ls ;s not regarded by the Postmaster General as
altogether satisfactory, and he says that while he
la not prepared to recommend specific changes he
believes that certain inquiries being made by him
will afford data on which to base future recom
r. ittona. He thinks worthy of serious con
sideration a suggestion that a substantial saving
icojld be effected in railway mail transportation by
forwarding bulky periodicals and mailable mer
fflSai disc by fast freight, but that when transported
$? what ordinarily is known as "fast mail" such
■Biter should pay extra postage.
An appropriation of 10,000 for sending three ex
perienced postal officials abroad to study foreign
postal systems is asked.
Interest in the enactment of legislation looking to
the upbuilding and encouragement of the American
merchant marine is set forth at a reason for im
proving the transportation of mails to foreign coun
tries, and the Postmaster General says that the
Cut trail steamero ol other countries leaving ports
of the United States will more and more absorb
our for<-;j;n mall transportation until such time as
the United Suites provides an. adequate compen-
I*l "• - the outward voyages of steamers of equal
spe»d and regularity of schedule. The unprece
dented expansion of trade and foreign commerce, in
the opinion of the Postmaster General, justifies
prcrept consideration of an adequate foreign mail
Jervice. Kxpc-ndittires to this end, he says s*>em
fully justified.
THE PARCELS POST.
The Po=tmr».str-r General says an effective do
mf=iic parcels post system could be organized
Usßtantlally as express companies conduct their
service, and as parcels post service is conducted in
othrr countries. While he does not deem it wise
*t this Tirnr- to ask Congress for such a stem, he
Mrssstly recommends that third and fourth class
matter b<* merged at the rate of one cent for two
ount-es. In this way, he says, all merchandise par
cels r.ot exoeedlns four pounds in weight would
continue to be carried at one-half the rate now
cnarpr-r! and afford a great opportunity of dls
tr! but ing; light package? to a multitude of plac«s
ret reached by express companies.
_ Dealing with second class matter, Postmapter
G?n»ral Corte'.you clares the statute to be inhcr
*JHly wrong. Hp bases this opinion on the fact
Oat m the last fiscal year the total weight carried
at one cent a pound and free was 863J.07.138 pounds.
"Jf," says he, "it cost the government as much as

As regards the rural free delivery service, the

at a lower rate of expense.

IMMIGRATION PROBLEMS.
Report of Bureau Tells of Increase
in Arrivals.
Washington, Dec. 10.— In presenting the annual
report of the Bureau of Immigration, Commissioner
General Sargent refers to the magnitude and
gravity of the problems presented by the growth of
the alien population of the United States. "These
problems," he declares, "loom so largely In the
prospect of our country that It may be said, with
out giving Just causa to charge exaggeration, that
all other questions of public economy, relating to
things rather than to human beings, shrink into
comparative insignificance."
In his annual message to Congress President
Roosevelt discussed the immigration question at
length, so that those features of Commissioner
Sargent's report bearing on the class of immigrants
desired, the Inducements offered by transportation
companltts to Immigrants to come to America, laws
to be enacted, and the attitude toward the Chinese
have been substantially published.
There are many details, however, given in the re
port. The total arrival of aliens reported for the
year, 1,026,4 ft), represents an increase over the preced
ing year of 2.3.629. Of this increase the continental
ports of the United States report 136,940 and the
Canadian ports 13,840. At the Insular ports the in
crease was 2.843, although tho arrivals at Porto
Rico were less by M than in 1904. There also was
a large increase in arrivals at Southern ports
while a decrease is shown for the Pacific ports
which Is accounted for in some measure by th»
Russo-Japanese War.
Of the Increased arrivals above referred to, Aus
tria-Hungary sent 58.537 over 1904; Russia, 39.756;
Italy, 2S.JS3, and the United Kingdom, 49.544. This
Increase from the last mentioned country, says the
Commissioner, is somewhat offset toy the decreases
from Germany, Switzerland and Sweden. Notwith
standing the Increase from Italy, that country,
says the Commissioner, may be regarded as having
probably reached the high water mark.
From thla showing Commissioner Sargent vent
ures the prediction that the chief sources of future
Increases in Immigration are those two countries
in Europe which have tha greatest surplus popu
lation, probably Russia and Austro-Hungary.
"With these facts a. view," he says,.. "It will be
possible to calculate with reasonable certainty on
the character of immigration, in its greater bulk,
for some years to come— least of lAiropean im
migration." Commissioner Bargain does not lose
sight of the increased number of immigrants from
European Turkey, a field which, although practl
taiiy inexhaustible, he says, .a but a virgin to the
ictivities of the transportation agent.
The importance of a proper understanding of the
contract labor law is dwelt upon in the report.
No feature of the Immigration law, he declares,
has proved so difficult of enforcement as that which
was parsed for the protection of labor in this
country from unfair competition by aliens. The
chief obstacle in the way of such enforcement, he
says, is the erroneous impression that it is a meas
ure wrung from Congress against its will by the
power of organized labor, "exacting all it could
obtain rather than seeking simple justice."
"This Impression is so widely prevalent." he says,
"that it produces at least an indifference to the
enforcement of the law, if not a hostile bias against
It, and credits the law-making branch of the gov
ernment with no worthier motive for enacting it
than selfish fear. Because of such impression, the
bureau finds Its efforts to enforce the law either
reluctantly submitted to or resisted, actively or
passively, and itself viewed as in some sort a
branch or agency of organized labor, sensitive to
that body's interest, responsive to its wishes, and
thus essentially different from other parts of the
executive government of the United States. "Per
haps labor itself," he adds, "is not altogether free
from blame for this false public Impression, and
thus unconsciously has played into the hands of
those interests which find it to their account to
alienate public sympathy by encouraging such a
view."
As an Illustration he cites an occasion last year
when a branch of organized miners urged the
bureau that an offending company, on which it
originally had been active in fixing the responsi
bility for a violation of the law, should not be
prosecuted because the miners and the company
had reached a settlement of their differences.
Commissioner Sargent remarks, however, that
despite these obstabeles, the bureau has never re
laxed its efforts to make the law effective
HOUSES' SLOW START.
Little Legislation Expected Before
the Holidays.
Washington. D* ; 10. — The first Important
measure which -*'W receive the attention of the
Senate will bo the- Panama Canal Emergency
Appropriation bill, and its consideration will
begin this week. Some Senators predict that It
will become a law before the close of tho week,
but others have expressed the opinion that final
j action will be deferred until the week following.
I There will be no effort to prevent the passage of
j the bill in some shape, but there will be some
opposition to the proposed restoration of the
55,500,000 subtracted by the House from the
amount to be appropriated.
Regardless of the sura, the bill will be utilized
as a basis for the general discussion of the
canal question, it is expected that the debate
will deal largely with the question as to whether
the canal shall be constructed on the sea level.
There is some conflict of opinion as to whether
the bill shall be referred to the Committee on
Appropriations or the Committee on Interoceanic
Canals.
The general expectation is that there will be
comparatively little additional legislation be
fore the Christmas holidays. Several other
measures will be vigorously pressed, but, with
the exception of the Merchant Marine bill, the
sponsors of the bills do not count on early con
sideration. Senator Gallinger will call up the
Merchant Marine bill at the first opportunity,
and is hopeful that action will not be long de
layed. No one counts upon even getting a re
port from the committees on the railroad rate
bill until some- time after the holidays. The three
measures mentioned are considered the moat
important that will come before the Senate in
the session, and they will receive much atten
tion until they are finally disposed of.
The consideration by the Senate of the joint
statehood bill and the bill for the reduction of
the duty on Philippine Importations into the
United States will necessarily be postponed until
after the holidays. No one now expects any
effort to modify the tariff unless in the direction
of Senator Lodge's bill providing for a max
imum and minimum rate. The Massachusetts
Senator regards this proposition with much
favor, and will press it strenuously if he re
ceives any encouragement to do so.
Much of the time this week will be devoted to
the reorganization of the committees, and there
is hope that the announcement of changes can
be made before Thursday. Senator Mitt-hell's
death will be announced by Senator Fulton to
morrow, but it is not probable that the an
nouncement will cause an adjournment of the
Senate.
Speaker Cannon will announce the committees
of the House to-morrow. This will practically
complete the organization of that branch. The
committees will meet some time this week for
organization, the appointment of sub-committees
and the assignment to them of pending meas
ures.
In due time the sub-committees will report to
the full committees and they in turn to th*
House In this manner the wheels of legisla
tion will be btarted. With the long session
ahead, however, no important results are ex
pected until after tht holiday recess. The Ap
propriatlona Committee, which perhaps has the
heaviest task to perform, will first consider
either the Legislative or the District of Colum
bia Appropriation bill. But the outlook is that
neither of these measures will receive committee
attention before the holidays.
That there will be no la«k of legislative propo
sitions is indicated by the 5.963 bills which hay.»
already been introduced In the Houst-. Many of
these are private bills.
It is usual to fix the holiday adjournment for
about December '21 to allow members to reach
their honn-s for Christmas. While no dat~ thus
far has been decided, this adjournment is fully
expected on Thursday. December 21.
Leaders are disposed to hasten consideration
of the Philippine Tariff bill, and hearings will
undoubtedly begin as coon as the Ways and
Means Committee has organized.

TO AID MERCHANT MARINE.
Admiral Detcey Outlines Services It
N Could Render to Navy.
[From The Tribune Bureau.)
Washington, Dec. 10.— The bill of the Merchant
Marine Commission, together with the report
E urine now before Senate Committee on
ereou. is now before the Senate Committee on
Commerce, with every prospect of a favorable re
port to the Senate, and the friends of the measure
believe that the prospects for favorable action
by Congress are excellent. In his message the
President says: "I ask your earnest consideration
of the report with which the Merchant Marine
Commission hag followed Us long and careful In
quiry"; and on the fact that the President Is In
sympathy with the proposed legislation its pro
moters largely base their hopes.
The new bill Is similar to that reported a year
ago, but contains some Important changes, notable
among 1 them being the extension of the time when
tho coastwise laws shall apply to the Philippines
until April, 1909; an increase of $250,000 for the
subvention of the American LJne between New-
York and Southampton, and an Increase of $217,000
to the present Jine between San Francisco and
Australasia.
It is urged that the increased subvention of the
American Lane is rendered necessary by the action
of Great Britain in granting a new subsidy of
$1,100,000 to the Canard Line, besides loaning that
line the funds with which to construct the two
new turbine steamers which It recently put In
commisdon, at an extraordinarily low rate of In
terest, 2% per cent. With the increases granted
by the proposed legislation the total subvention
of th« American Line would amount to $1,007,000
and of the San Francisco-Australasian line to
$500,000.
Estimating the cost to the Treasury of the pro
posed measure for four years, the commission say*
that the first year there will be a net gain, be
cause of the tax on tonnage, of $616,750. The sec
ond year the balance will be on the other side of
the ledger, and the net cost will amount to $1,687,
000. The third year the net cost will amount to
$3,532,000 and the fourth year to $4,252,000.
Summing up the advantages which are *«» accrue
from this outlay, the commission enumerate* them
as follows:
First— A force of 10,000 naval volunteers—
can officers and men of the merchant marine
trained to the naval service and holding the same
relation to the regular navy held toward the regu
lar army by the . present militia and National
Guard.
Second— A new fleet of from 200,000 to 300,000 tons
of steel mall steamships, the naval reserve of fast
transports, ammunition ships, supply ship*, col
liers, repair and hospital ships, dispatch vessels,
etc, described in the accompanying report of Ad
miral Dfwty. as assential to the efficiency of our
fighting fleet la war.
Third— A net addition to our cargo (and fishery)
tonnage of I,Soj,ouo tons, increasing fourfold the
actual ocean shipping of the United States, and
giving us, exclusive of our distinctive lake and
coastwise vessels, a merchant marine much larger
than the entire merchant fleet of France or Nor
way, nearly twice that of Italy, and fully twic»
that of Japan. Such a new merchant tonnage
would enable the United States to carry under its
own flag not 10 per cent, as now, of its own Im
ports and exports, but 30 or 40 per cent, earning for
our own country, Instead of $20,000,000. from $65,000
000 to $60,000,000 a year in freight and passenger re
ceipts.
Fourth— Finally, the creation of ten regular new
or strengthened American steamship lines to South
America, Central America, Africa and Asia, sup
plemented by a large and active fleet of "tramp"
or cargo vessels, inevitably opening- new markets
for many thousands of additional bales of American
Cotton and thousands of tons of grain, flour, provi
sions, and manufactured goods — total amount of
increased trade arid increased employment for the
whole American people impossible to state now in
specific figures, but certainly flftyfold or a hundred
fold the entire cost of the "national subventions.
Accompanying the report of the commission is the
report made by .Admiral Dewey as admiral of the
navy and president of the General Board, in which
he declares that the greatest service which the
merchant marine could afford to the navy In time
of war would consist of providing fast vessels to
be used as scouts and capable of a sustained sea
speed of twenty knot, but tho admiral adds:
The navy would need a number of colliers with a
cargo capacity of at least 5,000 tons each, and with
sufficient speed and steaming radius to enable them
to accompany a squadron of battleships. There
should be five such colliers for each squadron of
eight battleships, with its attendant cruisers. A
number of colliers of less speed and carrying
capacity would also be needed for the purpose of
keeping the coal supply replenished at the various
coal depots and for other purposes. The existence
of a large United States merchant marine, from
which the colliers could be drawn, especially the
fast colliers, would be of great advantage to the
navy.
Ammunition ships of about 4,000 tons carrying ca
pacity would be required for the purpose of re
plenishing the ammunition supply of the fleet and
for accompanying the fleet with reserve ammuni
tion in case of* a contemplated action. These vessels
should have sufficient speed and steaming radius to
enable them to accompany a squadron of battle
ships. There should be one such vessel for each
squadron of eight battleships with its attendant
cruisers.
One of each of the following- type 3 would be re
quired for each squadron of eight battleships, with
its attendant cruisers, destroyers, etc.: Supply ship,
with cargo capacity of from 4,000 to 5,000 tons; tank
or distilling: .ship, with capacity of 1,000,000 gallons
fresh water; hospital ship, repair and torpedo depot
ship.
Speed would not be an essential in these vessels,
as they would rot ordinarily accompany the fleet
when cruising at full speed, but would habitually
lie at an advanced naval base of operations conve
nient to the fig-htin? fleet or cruise by themstlves
between ports. These vessels, should, however
have a sustained sea speed of at least twelve knots.
In case of a long voj ga by a large fleet, such as
Admiral'Rojestvensky's. vessels of this type would
accompany the fleet.
A number of transports would also be needed by
the Navy Department for the transportation of
a force of marines for the establishment and de
fence of advanced naval bases. Each transport
should be capable of carrying at least one bat
talion of marines (about five hundred men), with
complete outfit of field and camp equipage, and
should have not less tha:i twelve knots speed.
It will also probably be found necessary to pro
cure a number of small fast vessels for duty as
dispatch boats, a3 district scouts off the coasts or
the United States, and for harbor entrance patrol
in cases where the channels are mined, etc., as well
as a number of tugs and steam lighters.
It Is Of course Impossible to foretell the extent of
the needs of the navy in any future war. they
being dependent altogether on the size of the United
States navy at that time and the nature of the
campaign to be carried out: but summarizing the
above, the number of auxiliary vessels necessary
for naval purposes would be. roughly, as follows,
basing the number upon a squadron of eight battle
ships, with attendant cruisers, torpedo boat de
stroyers, etc.: Twenty-knot scuuts. eight for each
squadron; lr.-knot squndron colliers, rive for each
squadron; slower colliers, dependent upon circum
stances isay. roughly, rive for each squadron); 15
kr.ot ammunition ships, one for each squadron. 12

squadron; tf-knot tank and distilling ships one .or

squadron: 12-knot repair and torpedo depot shine,
one for each squadron; IS-knot dispatch boats.. dis

ASK FOR MRS. MACLAURIN.
Friends of Pastor Said Not to Know
Her Whereabouts.
Mental strabismus, according to the Rev.
Archibald B. MacLaurin, caused Mrs. Georglna
MacPherson to make serious charges against
him to the board of deacons of the Sixteenth
Street Baptist Church. Contrary to general ex
pectations, the pastor occupied the pulpit yes
terday, preaching to about sixty persons, the
sermon generally being considered a comment
ary on his own situation.
"The Lord loveth a good fighter," he said to
the almost empty church, "when the fighter
has a good cause, and will defend him to the
end."
Mrs. MacLaurin was not at any of the services
at the church, neither was she to be found at
home. Friends who had sought her did not
know where she was, it was said at the church.
After the service the pastor stopped at the door
to shake hands with a few. parishioners and to
discuss with them the church situation. He
was asked why his wife had missed coming to
the service for almost the first time in his
pastorate. The minister would not answer at
first but finally said: "Go and ask her."
"But she is not at home," some one objected.
"Oh, they're pretty w^ll trained there, aren't
they?" he parried back. Concerning the charges
which have been made against him all the
clergyman would say at fhe time was: "Every
man gets his day, and mine will come along with
the rest ."
It was rumored early in the day that the super
intendent of the Sunday school. Morris A. Lewis,
would resign, having joined the party In oppo
sition to Mr. MacLaurin. When the Sunday
school met Mr. Lewis and all his teachers were
present. The Rev. Mr. MacLaurin intimated
that Mr. Lewis might cease to be superintendent
of the school whether he resigned or not.
"I believe he is not among my supporters,"
he said. "But there will be a meeting of the
officers of the Sunday school to-morrow night.
At that meeting Mr. Lewis may be superseded
by a new superintendent. If anybody resigns
there are plenty to take their places."
"I am vindicated," he said a little later. "My
opponents have failed to substantiate any of
their charges. Look at my record. I have
given away thousands upon thousands of dol
lars. Just around this neighborhood. Just ask
any of the merchants about Ijere. I helped one
woman, especially."
"Why did Mrs. MacPherson, admitting that
you befriended her. take- the action that she
has?" he was asked.
"She la afflicted with mental strabismus. Don't
forg«t that word, gentlemen— mental strabis
mus."
