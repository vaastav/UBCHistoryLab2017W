" A DELAY
In Completing a Portion of tlie
New Tariff Bill.
Sugar, Whisky and the .Income Are
the Causes.
.Distiller Want nn Unlimited Itendrd l'i-
rled This Would Ucf.ut the AilinlnN-
trntleu's l'urpoxe Sueur Schrdule
and Whisky Tax Are Tied Up.
'
Washington, Dec. 4. Sugar, whtshy
and the Income tux nre the sources of
the dolej- In completing the portion of
the tariff bill which Is te raise revenue.
The contradictory ruperts en the Mil -
' jeets of the whisky tx and the income
tax are simply the results of the con
stant changes of plan by the committee
Hself. Secretary CnrlUlu Sunday in
formed the majority members wl e
visited him, that he had delayed tinul
revision and completion of his report, in
the hope that se me decisive action
would be taken by the committee, but
that, in view of it failure te reach
any conclusion, he was new compellcd
te submit his report without any dis dis dis
ussiouef the relief that would be nf
&rdcd the treasury from taxation of
whisky. The difllculty that new eon-Jk-enta
Mr. Carlisle, as well as the ma
jerity of the members of the commit
tee, in dealing1 with the whisky tax is
that the distillers, whlle content
with only an incroase of ten
oents n gallon, if no mere can
be obtained, are at work among
tiie members of the heuse creating a
strong movement in favor of an un
limited bendod period. Should this
succeed it would defeat the very pur
pose which the administration would
have in view, if it sought te rains ad
ditional revenue by au increase of the
whisky tax, since, if the bended period
b made unlimited, instead of three
years as at present, whisky distillers
could expert all their whisky and store
it at Iterinuda, or any ether foreign
pert, and bring it book te the United
States only as the trade demanded.
Thus the govcrnment would derive
even less rovenue than aV present.
Mr. Cleveland Is bolieved te favor an
increase en whisky of thirty cents, but
he opposes any extension of the
bended period, or any ethor step which
, will be of tlnanciul advantage te the
whisky distillers. The sugar schedule
is intimately tied up with the whiky
tax. There is a growing belief that
the heu.'e or failing in the house,
then in the senate will -, reject the
Wilsen bill prevision for the gradual
ibolit.en of the bounty. It is under
stood that Mr. Cleveluad, while sanc
tioning it, 'is net irrevocably wodded
te the bounty, and that its rejection in
the house is thereupon net impossible.
Should the bounty project be wiped out
and a duty of one cent a pound levied
en raw Migar instead, an entire remod
eling of plans for raUiug rovenue
would be imperative, slnce the treas
ury would have millions every year in
net being compelled te pay bounties,
and would besides derive an enormous
increase from the raw sugar tax. In
this case thcru would be no need
of nn increased tax en whisky.
The question of an income tax
has net yet progressed sutlleiently
te be criticised into a bill, bocause
that subjact, tee, is found in the final
determination of the revenue what
will Hew Inte the treasury from sugar
and whisky. In a word, the democratic
party is te-night en the eve of its first
regular session, as hopelessly at sea en
the manner of cnrrylng out its tnriff
reform pledges, as It was nearly four
months aero en the eve of the extraordin extraerdin
nr5 session en the subject of sliver.

WRECK ON THE LEHIGH.
Cars Hurled lata Uensci and AU Tatre
Fire
Wilkesbahiie, Pa., Dec 4. An awful
wreck occurred en the Lehigh Valley
railroad at Whlte llaveu early Satur
day morning, caused by a rear eud cel
lisien. Twenty-eight cars piled up aud
were thrown against houses which are
built close up te the track. Several of
the buildings took fire and the llre de
partment had a hard battle. One
brakemun was killed and two in
jured. Engine Ne. 193 going enst overtook a
coal train leaded iit(Jreensbrldge, N. J.,
two and one-half mlTes from here.
The crash was Inevitable. The
engineer revcrsed his engine and with
the fireman jumped and saved thelr
lives. The engine then started back nt
a terrific rate of speed and at Stockton
street crossing, Phllllpsburg, crashed
into the Dorethy, the crew of which
jumped when they saw the
runaway engine coming. The 102, be
ing the heavicst of the two locomo
tives, succeeded in pushing the "Doro "Dero "Dore
thy" back a distauce of two miles te
the Abbett street crossing, Seuth
Eaaten, where they celli le 1 with
Engine Xe.. 4l, drawing nn
costbeuud coal train. lluilroad lluilread
er6 say that the engines enme past the
Eufcten stntlen at a rate of fully forty ferty ferty
five miles an hour. The wreckage Is
strewn along the tracks for a great dis
tance Strange te s.ay none of the en
gines left the track. The crew of l'n l'n
gine 193 can net be found.
It Is feared that two or three men nre
buried in the wreckage, which Is being
cleared up us fast us possible. The
llagman and brnkettuui of the train
have net been seen since the accident
occurred. This is the most disastrous
wreck that has occurred siuce the
strike begun.
NOBLE GIFTS.
A Chicago YVuumii IJehNuvs a Hundred
Thousand Dellar en O'lmrltr.
Cuicaoe, Dec. 4. Four charitable
institutions in this city, nnd one in
Cleveland have been made richer by an
aggregate sum of nearly $100,000. The
generous donor of this magnificent en
dowment is Mrs. Mux Rothschild, of
2113 Prnlrle avenue. The institutions
which thus share her wealth nnd are
the recipients of her generosity are the
Michael Reese hospital, tlie Jewish
Manuel Training school, en Canal
street, the Old People home en Sixty
seventh street, and the Jewish Orphan
asylum at Cleveland, ().
It has been Mrs. Rothschild's inten
tion for some time te make these dona
tions and te de it en the national day
of Thanksgiving. Hut she is se very
averse te the notoriety that she posi
tively declined te make known the
amounts she has given te thee several
institutions, except te their trustees,
nnd the public will only knew them, If
at all, through the published annual
reports of the beneficiary Institutions.
Max M. Rothschild died September 5
last, leaving an estate valued at ever
$1,000,000. His widow, who was born
Rescf idler, is wealthy in her own right,
having inherited a lure amount from
the Michael Reese estate
During their whole married life Mr.
and Mrs. Rothschild devoted much of
their time and a great de.tl of money
te uuostentntious charity, or, rather,
te assisting worthy peer te help them
selves. In this work they did net per
mit the lines of nationality or creed te
limit their bounty. Every worthy per
son who needed help that came te their
knowledge received it.
REDUCTION OF INTEREST.
Clitru?e Suvlni; ltnl IIau f.t-si Demand
ft.r Meney.
Chicago, Dec, 4. After January 1
next the interest rate en savings de
posits in most of the Chicago banks
will be reduced te 4 per cent This
action is the result of the heavy accu
mulation of funds for which no em
ployment eun be found.
The Northern Trust Ce. has an
nounced that such will be their course,
aud ether banks will, take similar action
seen, beveral meetings of ellicials of
the various savingh banks have been
held lately at which the question was
discu- ed, and it is said that a prac
tically unauimeus decision was finally
reached that in view of the steadily in
creasing amount of idle funds and the
small demand for leans the banks, in
justice te themselves, could net de
otherwise than cut down the rate paid
en deposits.
It Is expected that the immediate ef
fect of the abeve rule will be a draw
lug down te some oxtent of savings de
posits. Persons whose accounts amount
te any considerable sum will seek
investments paying a mere remunera
tive rate than that offered by the
banks.
Se far ns the banks are concerned,
however, they are In a position te per
mit of a much greater reduction of
their surplus than is at all probable,
as a result of the enfereraent of the
rule.

yet has refused te co-eporato with the
ether governments for material defense
against anarchist outrages.
