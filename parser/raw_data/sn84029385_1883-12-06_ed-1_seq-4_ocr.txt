Is It A Joke?
Junction City Union: "The ghastly
story comes from Dickinson County that
y. p. "Wilson is endeavoring to find
some one to bring Mm out for Congress.
JJe is getting tired trying to beat An
derson witli some one else all the time."
A Cold Day.
A severe storm, accompanied by a
blizzard, swept OTer New England last
Monday. The election of a tariff reform
Speaker is supposed to have caused this
storm. It is usually a cold day when
New England gets left.
Isn't She A Daisy.
The Beflectok is sent to its sub
scribers now as a seven column quarto,
the largest paper in the county and one
of the largest in the State. Its man
agers are determined to merit the favor
which the public is bestowing upon the
paper, and its enlargement and conse
quent increase of reading matter is a
step in this direction. Look at it, ad
mire it and then come in and sul
scribe for it.
Soldiers Home in Kansas.
The movement for the establishment
of a Soldier's Home in Kansas has be
come gigantic in proportions. Blank
petitions were sent to the various posts
of the Grand Army in Kansas,Nebraska,
Colorado, New Mexico, Missouri, Indian
Territory, and Arkansas, asking Con
gress to establish a Soldier's Home in
Kansas, and they are to be placed in
the hands of the Kansas congressional
delegation. It is estimated there
will be 12,000 signatures from the state
of Kansas alone.
Liquor licenses.
The statistical tables issued by the
commissioner of internal revenue for the
last fiscal yeaf show.among other things,
the number of wholesale and retail liquor
licenses issued by the government in the
several states: The question: Does pro
lubition prohibit? is answered so far as
it relates to New England states as fol
lows: In Maine the increase over 18S2
of retail liquor licenses was 137; in Ver
mont, 27; in New Hampshire, 110; and
in Rhode Island, 14. In Maine during
the last fiscal year there were ten licen
ses issued to wholesale liquor dealers.
The President's Message.
President Arthur sent his message to
the House on Tuesday. It is oppress
ively long and contains nothing remark
able. The usual congratulations are
extended to the country, and our rela
tions with foreign nations are consider
ed at an unprofitable length. He op
poses governmental control of the tele
graph, and asks that power be bestowed
upon the executive to veto objection
able features of any appropriation bill
without killing the entire bill. The
message closes by recommending furth
er legislation for the protection of the
Negro. The Reflector will contain
the message in full next week, when it
will be considered at greater length.
A New Source of Revenue to the City.
Last Wednesday the six saloon keep
ers of Abilene were arrested under the
recently enacted ordinance which de
clares saloons common nuisances. The
cases were brought before "Squire Clark,
and the plea of "not guilty" was enter
ed. The defendants were found guilty
by the Court and a line of $50 assessed
against each. There was no apparent
"kicking" on the part of the saloon
men, and the $300. were paid into the
city treasury. This is probably only the
beginning of a series of prosecutions
which will put a comfortable sum of
money into the city treasury, and not
too moderate nor too high a tax on the
liquor traffic. The city authorities seem
to bo in earnest.
Blaine's Idea About the Distribution
of the Surplus.
Senator J. G. Blaine, of Maine, in a
little manifesto to the people of this
great Republic, advocates the "distribu
tion of the revenue coming from whis
ky and tobacco among the various
states, the ratio of distribution being
based on the population.
Coming from a Maine statesman, this
idea has a novelty about it which charms
at first sight. For thirty-two years
Maine has had a prohibition law which
declares the liquor traffic illegal, and for
an equal number of years she has re
fused to receive a revenue from the sale
or manufacture of liquor within her own
borders. And right in the face of this
home-virtue, as it were, comes the de
mand for money derived from the liquor
traffic in other states! Shades of de
parted moonshiners! Virtuous Maine,
for Maine and Blaine are one, contribu
ting no part of this revenue, is yefe wil
ling to accept enough money to run its
government from the sin and shame of
the people of other States !
If Mr. Blaine's plan should be adopt
ed, prohibition Kansas woidd receive
yearly about $2,000,000. The state
taxes of Kansas would be paid by Ken
tucky or some other license liquor state,
and that which is denounced as a sin
at home would be a delightful source of
revenue coming from a sister State.
The plan is absurdly ridiculous and
hardly deserves serious consideration.
It shows to what extent, however, this
rapidly growing national surplus afcums
the republican party. To get rid of it
without touching the tariff, is the idea
of that party, wedded as it is to high
protection, combinations and monopo
lies. The internal revenue tax on whis
ky or tobacco must not be repealed or
distributed among the several states.
Seduce the tariff on the necessaries of
life, and retain the tax on luxuries.
Editorial Ends.
Railroad frauds and a tariff reform
movement will make Kansas democratic
North Carolina will levy no state tax
next year. The "Western North Carolina
Railroad Company will pay into the
Treasury $600,000, which sum will car
ry the State Government.
A destructive fire in Chicago, last
Saturday, destroyed the building occu
pied by the Evening Journal and the J.
B. Jeffery printing company. Loss
about $140,000, well covered by insur
ance. The election of Carlisle as Speaker is
said to bring McDonald, of Indiana, and
Morrison, of Illinois, before the people
as prominent presidential candidates.
Either one of them would make a strong
fight.
The railroads, monopolies and corpor
ations were in favor of Randall for
Speaker, and the democrats of the House
were in favor of. Carlisle. That's the
reason why the latter gentleman was
chosen Speaker,
The illumination in the western sky
which startled New York City one even
ing last week, has been meteorological
ly explained, as it were. In the forma
tion of the House of Representatives,
not a man east of the Alleghenys was
chosen to fill an office. To be bom in
the East is no longer a saving qualifica
tion. J. "Warren Keifer received the empty
honor of the nomination for Speaker of
the House at the Republican caucus
last Saturday night at "Washington.
Ex-Speaker Kiefer didn't propose to
waive his right in this matter, and de
spite the protestations of his party he
demanded and received an endorsement
of his course while Speaker of the Forty-Seventh
Congress.
The Democratic caucus, Saturday
night at "Washington, nominated Carlisle
for Speaker on the first ballot, the vote
standing: "Carlisle, 106; Randall, 53;
Cox, 30. There were 18S democrats hi
the caucus, and Carlisle's nomination
was made unanimous. Randall and
Cox took their defeat very philosophi
cally, and pledged themselves to work
for the party. There was a noticeable
absence of all bitterness.
Have our republican friends read that
temperate and proof-convincing address
from the Virginia democratic state
committee? It shows Mahone up in
a true life, and Ave may find room for it
next week. Perhaps one or two of our
esteemed contemporaries, who have as
siduously and even virtuously circulated
Mahone's terrible story, will have man
hood enough to publish the defense.
The bloody shirt is getting altogether
too ragged for effective service.
5r
Republican journals, as is the case
with the New York Times, should not
rail against First Assistant Postmaster
General Hatton. He "stands in" with
the administration, and is popularly
considered a leading member of the
coalition, composed of Mahone, Chal
mers, Gorham and others, which is to
give the solid south to Arthur in the
next republican presidential convention.
It is all owing to how a republican looks
at the solid South whether it seems
beautiful to him or not.
Gen. Grant attended a wedding at
Philadelphia, and while in the city he
casually remarked to a reporter: "New
York is certainly republican when the
party is undivided, and I don't see any
thing just now to divide it. It is idle
to even hazard a guess at the probable
Republican candidate for President.
Ohio is still republican in a presidential
year, and Pennsylvania is sure. There
fore, the outlook for next year's contest
is very promising." Gen. Grant's re
marks remind us of a lecture we once
heard on the thing-in-itself-unknowa-ble.
Speaker Carlisle.
The democratic party of tlris country
has reason to congratulate itself on the
election of Mr. Carlisle, of Kentucky,
as speaker of the Forty-Eighth Con
gress. He is a man of able parts, pos
sessing a sound judgment, a strong will,
a cultivated, practical mind and a thor
ough knowledge of parliamentary law
and usages. "With Carlisle in the chair,
the democrats need not look for a dam
aging "party blunder."
The election of Mr. Carlisle was ako
the triumphant expression of a great
principle in National politics and econ
omy, and the the democratic party there
by declares itself in unequivocal lan
guage the champion of this principle.
The election of Mr. Carlisle gives to
the democratic party of the country a
a living issue. The party's attack on a
high and unjust tariff, railroad extor
tions and the power of monopolies, has
not been a mere battle of words. It is
found to be sincere in its professions,
audits unmistakable attitude will in
spire confidence and a victorous sup
port. "With a republican Senate and Execu
tive, it is hardly possible for the demo
cratic House to reduce the present tariff
rates at this session. But the election
of Speaker Carlisle is an earnest of what
will be done when the propitious time
arrives.
It cannot now be said that the demo
cratic party is Janus-faced and slow in
its movements. It is to-day the party
of progress; it embraces a living, vital
issue the reduction of the cost of the
necessaries of life and the pruning of
an extravagant Governmental system.
Opposed to this idea of the amelioration
of the condition of the people stands
the republican part'. It is behind the
car of progress.
The tide is strongly in favor of the
democrats, the light is coming nearer
and growing brighter, and the triumph
of principle over greed and conniption
is only a matter of a few months time.
The Electoral College.
The newspapers of the country are
pretty generally making use of that
time-honored privilege of electing the
president a year in advance of the elec
tion. If the figures of political papers
should be correct there would be no use
in holding elections, and both parties
would enjoy the supreme pleasure of
possessing the president. But to be
serious, the outlook is very favorable to
the democrats. Here is our table:

The Lawrence Canning Company put
up this season 280,000 two-pound cans
of tomatoes, 200,000 two pound cans of
sweet corn, 25,000 gallon cans of apples
and about 50,000 cans of beans and oth
er vegetables and fruits. They intend
to double the capacity of their works
next year. All of these vegetables are
raised in abundance in Dickinson coun
ty, and what is to prevent Abilene from
having a canning factory?
Junction City Union: The Junction
City Provision Company began slaugh
tering hogs last Saturday, the 24th.
About forty hogs were killed. A large
number of citizens were present to wit
ness the opening of this new business
enterprise. The establishment was
built and finished to the most minute
detail under the personal supervision of
Messrs. Comstock and Tolen, and neith
er pains nor expense were spared in mak
ing it as complete and perfect as possi
ble. Its capacity is 500 hogs daily, and
a corresponding number of beeves.
There is storage for 1,500 tons of ice,
and the buildings are located so as to
bring the ice from the Republican river
by steam power. About fifty hogs have
been slaughtered each day since. Scott
buys for them. The company will be
gin packing and shipping immediately,
but do not expect for awhile yet to
work up to their full capacity.
"Why wouldn't a packing house pay
in Abilene? It would make an excel
lent hog market and would do away
with the live weight shipping to Kan
sas City.

John B. Clarke, of Missouri, was nom

second ballot; JohnB. Leedom, of Ohio,
was nominated for sergeant-at-arms by
acclamation; John G. "Wintersmith, of
Texas, was nominated for doorkeeper
on the first ballot; Lycurgus Dalton, of
Indiana, was renominated by acclama
tion for postmaster, and Eev. John S.
Lindsey, pastor of the Episcopal church

ly nominated Chaplain. Thus was the
House organized by the democratic cau
cus at Washington.
A correspondent to the Kansas City
Times from Topeka says that attorney
ceneral Johnson, Auditor McCabe and
State Treasurer Howe will ask for a
re-nomination at the hands of the Ke
publican State Convention. After say
ing a few good words for Secretary
Smith, who wants to be Governor, the
correspondent pays a "high compliment
to Auditor McCabe in these words: "He
has performed the duties of his office so
well and with such utter abandonment
of tentation or proud feeling, that to go
back on him now would be a deadener
to the republican party. "When the
precedent was established last year,
giving colored men a recognition, and
Mr. E. P. McCabe was nominated for
auditor, hundreds of men predicted
that he would be a complete failure, but
in this they have been terribly disap
pointed. In the face of every obstacle
and' misgiving, he took hold like a man,
has conducted himself as a man of abil
ity and is deserving to be renominated."

There are 401 electoral votes and it
takes 201 to elect. The democrats can
afford to lose New York and yet have
the majority. It is almost certain that
California, Colorado and Nevada will
cast their votes for the democrats as they
did for Hancock in 18S0. If such hap
pens to be the case the democrats can
afford to lose Ohio and Indiana and still
have 213 votes 12 more than necessary.
And it would be just to put Maine,
Massachusetts and "Wisconsin in the list
of doubtful states. The democrats will
cany New York, Ohio and Indiana
next year, and will elect the president.
Amusements.
The "Hidden Hand," by the White
ley company, drew a large audience to
Bonebrake's Opera House last "Wednes
day evening. The general feeling, at
the close of the performaece, was one
of disappointment. The ' 'new version' '
of the play is not so interesting as the"
old, and the company is not a strong
one. Miss Ilattie Irving, as Capitola,
was vivacious, independent and slangy
enough for all purposes, but her voice,
form and general tone and color were
not equal to the cast. The character of
"Wool was well taken hi spite of its ex
aggeration, and Major Warfield was
reasonably good. Taking all in all,
however, the Whiteley's did not nearly
meet the expectations of the audience.
The "Williams' Dramatic company ap
peared at Bonebrake's Opera House last
Friday and Saturday evenings before
pleased audiences. Miss Matie "Wil
liams as the "Little Duchess" was
charming, original,artistic and decided
ly pretty. The play is one of consider
able interest, and its parts did not suffer
at the hands of the company, the mem
Ifers of which were all good. Averag
ing the whole, the "Williams' is the best
amateur company which has visited
Abilene this season. Saturday evening,
as "Kathleen Mavourneen," Miss Wil
liams deepened the favorable impression
she had made the nignt previous, and
confirmed the belief of her audience
that she was possessed of refinement
and a great deal of artistic ability.
Manager Bonebrake occupies a hard
position. It is his endeavor to secure
good troupes for his Opera House, but
along with many others he is sometimes
imposed upon, as was the case with the
Hidden Hand company. The White
ley's came highly recommended; they
drew the largest audience ever seen in
Clay Center; Manhattan and Junction
City gave them large audiences and the
Emporia and Wichita papers spoke very
highly of them. The fact of the matter
is, the company is one of the poorest on
the road, and it is high time for the
press of the state to take this matter in
hand and mercilessly expose All such im
positions as the Whiteley Hidden Hand
Company.
