PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
'(Continued from Face One)
"the necessity of economy in govern
ment appropriations and expenditures
and the avoidance by congress of prac
tices which take money from the treas
ury by' indefinite or revolving; fund ap
propriations.
- Thjs year's estimates "strikingly" Il
lustrated the Importance of -specific ap
propriations, the president "added, the
transportation act having "disturbed"
the relationship between cjjje,ot re
ceipts and expenditures to the eztent of
over a billion dollars.
"It is obvious," the message contin
ued, "that these 'arge payments have
already seriously limited the poyern
tnent's progress In retiring the floating
Bebt." ..
. The president renewed some of" the
recommendations he mads at the opening
f the last session, and added:
"I do not feel it my privilege at pres
ent to suggest the detailed and particu
lar methods by which these objects may
he attained, but I have faith that the
Inquiries of your several committees
will discover the way and the method."
The only recommendations for other
than domestic matters wag that for a
loan to Armenia to be administered
through American commissioners to
avoid "further tempting opportunities"
lo revolutionary tendencies In that coun
try," and for granting independence to
the Philippines "to keep our promise "to
lie people of those islands."
TEXT OF PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Waatiington, Deo. 7. President Wll
cn's annual message to congress follows:
"When I addressed myself to perfjrm
rtg the duty laid upon the president by
lie constitution to present to ou an an
nual report on the e:ate of the union, I
found my thought dominated by an im
r.ortal sentence of Abraham Llncoln.s.
"1-et us have faith that right makes
might, and in faith let us dare to do our
!uty as re understand it." a sentence
immortal because it embodies in a form
5f uttrr simplicity and purity the essen
:i il faith of the nation, the faith ih which
t was J-nceived and the faith in which it
us grown to glory and power. With
Jiat faith and the birth of a nation
Vended upon It cime the hope Into the
nrld that a new order would prevail
lliroughout the affairs of mankind, an
jrder in wh'ch reason and right would
take precedence of covetonsness nad force,
and I believe that Ixpress the wish and
purpose of every thouphtful American
Rhen I say that this sentence marks for
D in the plainest manner the part we
liould play alike In the arrangement of
pjr domestic affairs find in our exercise
of influence upon the affairs"" of the
wrrM.
"I!y this faith arid by this faith alone
cm the world he lifted out of Its present
confusion and despair. It was this faith
which prevailed over the wicked force of
:!vmar.y. Yon will remember Vhat the
1-ginning of the end of the war came
v-hen the German people found them
selves face- to face with the conscience
of the world and realized that right was
everywhere array ed against the wrone
that their government was attempting to
perpetrate. I think therefore, that it is
true to say that this v.-ns the faith with
which our gallant men went into the field
end out upon the seas to make sure of
victory.
Mission of Democracy
"This is the mission upon which de
itmcracy came Into the world. Democ
racy is an assertion of the right of the
individual to live and to bo treated justly
as against any attempt on the part of
any combination of individuals to make
laws which will overimrden him or which
will destroy his equality among his fel
lows In the matter ot right or privilege,
and I think we all realize that the day
has come when democracy is being put
upon Its final test. The old world is just
now suffering from a wanton rejection
of the principle of democracy, and a sub
it itutlon of the principle of autocracy as
aserted. in the name but without the au
ihority and sanction of the multitude.
Thta is the time of all others when de
mocracy should prove Its' purity and its
spiritual power to prevail. .
Tnlted States Should Lead
It is surely the manifest destiny of the
t'nited States to lead in the attempt to
make this spirit prevail. There are two
ways in which the United States can as
sist to accomplish this great object: First,
by offering the example within her own
borders of the will and power of democ
racy to make and enforce laws which
are unquestionably just and which are
equal In their administration laws which
secure its full right to labor and yet at
the same time safeguard the integrity of
property and particularly of that prop
erty which Is devoted to the development
of industry and the increase ef the nec
essary wealth of the world. .Second, bv
standing for right and Justice as towards
individual nations. The law of democracy
in the world should be for Jhe protection
of the weak nations, ths. nation which is
struggling toward Its right and towards
Its proper recognition and privllige Irt the
family of natlona. "ITie United States
cannot refuse this role of champion with
out Turning the stigma of rejection upon
the great and devoted men who brought
its government Into existence and estab
lished K in the face of almost universal
opposition end Intrigue, even n the face
of wanton forpe, or for example against
the orders in cou'srll of Great Britain and
'.he arbitrary Napoleonic decrees which in-
flved ns in what we know as the War
jf 1812.
Duty of Congress to Remedy Injnatlees
I urge you to consider that the dis
play of an immediate disposition on the
part of congress to remedy any injustices
or evils that may have shown themselves
in our International life will afford the
most effectual offset to the forces of chaos
and tyranny, which are playing so dis
astrous a part in the fortunes of the free
aeople of more than one part of the
world. '. ' '
-The United States is of necessity the
sample democracy of the world and .the
triumph of democracy depends upon it
success.
"Recovery from the disturbing and
sometimes disastrous effects of the. late
war has been exceedingly slow on the
other side of the water and has riven
promise, I venture to say, of early com
pletion only In our otm fortunate coun
try; but even with us the recovery halts
an.l is impeded at times and there are
Immediately Serviceable acts' of legisla
tion which H seems to- me we ought to
ittempt. to assist that recovery and prove
the indestructible recutpemtive force of a
great government of the people. One of
these Is to prove that a great democracy
can kei house as successfully and is si
businesslike fashion aa any other gur
srnment.

. Budget By-stun I. Kereasary
"It seems to me. that the first step to
wards proving this is to supply ourselves
with a systematic method ot handling
onr estimates and expenditures and
bring-inir them to the point where they
will not be aa unnecessary strain upon
our income or necessitate unreasonable
taxation. In other words- a workable budg
et system and f respectfully surest that
two elements are essential to such a sys
tem ; namely, not only that the proposal
of appropriations should be In the hands
of a single body, such as a single ap
propriations committee Jn each house of
the coneress but also that this body
should be brought inio such eo-opertitlon
with the departments of the government
and with the treasury of ttie United, as
would enable M to aet upon a complete
conspectus of the needs ot the govern
ment as the resources from which it
must draw its Income. I reluctantly ve
toed the budget bill passed by the last
session of the congress hecwune of a
tonstHutional obJfcWon. The house of
representatives subsequently modified the
dill In order to meet this objection. In
the revised form I h'i - i.m.
coupled with action already taken by
the congrress to revise its rulee and pro
cedure furnishes the foundations for an
effective national budget system. I earjx
estly hope, therefore, that one of the first
steps taken by the present session of the
congress, will bejto pass the budget "bill.
Nation's Finances Improving-
"The nation's finances have shown
marked imfcrov(ementt during the past
year. The total ordinary receipts of J6,
694.000,000 for the fiscal .year 1920 ex
ceeded those for 1919 by J1.542. 000,000.
while the total net ordinary expenditures
decreased frem $18,514,000,000 to $6,403.
000,000. The gross public debt, which
reached ts highest point on August 31.
1919. when it was $26,596,000,000. had
dropped on Nov. 30, 1929 to -$24,175,000,-000.
There has also been a marked de
crease in holdings of government war se
curities by the banking institutions of
the country, as well as In the amount of
bills held by the federal reserve banks
secured by government war obliKations.
This fortunate result has relieved the
banks and left them freer to finance the
needs of agriculture, industry and com-
I merce. It has been due in larse part to
the reduction of the public debt, espe
cially of the floating debt, but more par
ticularly to the improved distribution of
government securities among permanent
Investors. The cessation of the govern
ment's borrowings except through short
term certificates of indebtedness had been
a matter of great consequence to the peo
ple of the country at large as well as to
holders ot Liberty bonds and ictory
notes, and has had an important bearing
on the mattor of effective credit control.
The year has been characterized by the
progressive withdrawal bf the treasury
from the domestic credit market and f-om
a position of dominant influence in that
market. The future course will neces
sarily depend upon the extent to which
economies are practised and upon the bur
dens placed umon the treasury, as well as
uipon industrial developments and the
maintenance of tax receipts at a suffi
ciently high level.
Great War Debt to Mature Soon
"The fundamental fact which at pres"
out dominates the government's financial
situation is that seven and a half billion
dollars of its war indebtedness mature
within ttie next two and a half years.
Of this amount, two and a half billions
are floating debt and five billions Victory
notes and War Savings certificates.
"The fiscal program of the government
must be determined with reference to
these maturities. Sound policy demands
that the government expenditures be re
duced to the lowest amount which will
permit tjie various services to operate
efficiently and that government receipts'
from taxes and salvage be maintained
sufficient! high to provide for current
requirements, including interest and sink
ing fund charges on the public debt and
part of the Victory laan before maturity.
With rigid economy, vigorous salvage
operations and adequate revenues from
taxation, a surplus of current receipts
over expenditures can be realized lnd
should be applied to the floating debt.
All branches of the government should
co-operate to see that this program is re
alized. Necessity of Economy
"I cannot over-empnasize the necessity
of economy in government appropriations
and expenditures and the avoidance by
Hie congress of practices which take
money from the treasury by indefinite or
revolving fund appropriations. The es
timates for the present year show that
Over a billion dollars of PYnpnHDnrds
were authorized by the 4ast congress in
addition to the amounts shown in the
i usual compiled statements of appropri-
I ations,
i . .
This strikingly illustrates the im
portance of making direct and specific
appropriations. The relation between the
current receipts' and current expenditures
of the government during Hie present
fiscal year.f as well as during the last fis
cal year, as well as during the last fis
cal rear, has been disturbed by the ex
traordinary burdens thrown upon the re
turn -of the railroads to private control.
Over $600,.000.000 has already been paid
to the railroads under this act $.150.
000,000 during the present fiscal year:
an4vit is estimated that further payment
aggregating ipessibly $650,000,000 still
must be paid to the railroads during the
current year. It is" obvious that, these
large payment have already seriously
limited the government's congress in re
tiring the floating debt.
Revision of Tax Laws Advocated
"Closely connected wTith this, it seems
to me, is the necessity for an immediate
consideration of the revision of our tax
laws. . Simplification of the income and
profit taxes has become an immediate ne
cessity. These taxes performed an indis
pensable service, during the war. The
need for their simplification, however,
is very great, in order to save the tax
payer inconvenience""ind expense and in
order to make his liability more certain
and definite. Other ancj more detailed re
commendations with regard to taxes, will.
no doubt be laid before you by the sec
retary of the treasury and the commis
sioner of internal revenue. (
About Treatment of Disabled Veterans
It is my privilege to draw the atten
tion of congress for .very sympathetic con
sideration of the problem of providing
adequate facilities for the care and treat
ment of former members cf the military
and naval forces who are sick or disabl
ed as the result of their participation in
the war. These heroic men can never
be paid in money for the survice they
patriotically rendered the nation. Their
reward will lie rather in realization of
the fact that they vindicated the rights
o their country and aided in safeguard
ing civilization. The nation's gratitude
tnust be effectively revta'ed to them by
the most ample rprovision for. their medic
al care and treatment as well as for their
vocational training and placement. The
time has come when a more complete
program can be formulated and more sat
isfactorily administered for their treat
ment and training and I 'earnestly urge
that the congress give the matter its
early consideration. The secretary of
the treasury and the board of vocational
education will outline in their annual re
ports proposals covering medical care and
rehabilitation, which I am sure will en
gage your earnest study and command
your most generous support.
Vrred in His Previous Messages
"Permit me to emphasize once more
the need for. action upon certi.in matters
upon which I dwelt at some length in my
message to the second session of the 66th
congress. The necessity for example of
encouraging the manufacture of dye-
stuffs and related chemicals; the import
ance of doing everything possible to pro
mote agricultural production along econ
omic lines, to improve agricultuial mar
keting and to make rural life more at
tractive and healthful ; the need for a law
regulating cold storage in such a way as
to limit the time during which goods. may
be kept in storage, prescribing the. meth
od of disposing of them if kept beyond the
permitted period and requirir. g goods re
leased from storage in all cases to bear
the date of thier receipt.
Marking Cold Storage Frodurts
- "It would also be most serviceable if
it were provided that all goods released
from cold storage for interstate shipment
should have plainly marked upon each
package the selling or market price at
which they went into storage, in order
that the purchased might be able to
learn what profits stood between him and
the producer or the wholesale, dealer. In
deed, it would be very serviceable to the
public if all goods . destined for inter
state commerce were made-'.o carry upon
every packing case whose form made it
possible, a plain statement of the price
at which they loft thn hands of the pro
ducer. I respectfully call your attention,
also, to the recommendations of the mes
sage referred to with regard to a fedral
liense for all corporations engaged in in
terstate commerce.
In brief, the immediate legislative
need of the time is the remvoal of all ob
staples to the realization of the best am-
bitions of our people in their several
classes .of employment and the srtength
ening of all instrumentalities by which
difficulties are to be met and removed
and justice dealt out whether by law
or by some form of mediation and con
ciliation. I do not feel it to be my privi
lege at present to suggest the detailed
and particular me'.liods by which these
ohjects may be attained, but I have faith
that the inquiries of your several com
mittees will discover the way and the
method.
Requests "Loan to Armenia
'In response to what I believe to be the
impulse s, of sympathy and opinion
throughout the United States, I earnestly
suggest that the congress authorize the
treasury of the United States to make the
struggling government of Armenia such a
loan as was made to several of the allied
governments during the war nnd I would
also suggest that it would be desirable
to provide in the legislation itself that
the expenditure ot the money thus loaned
be -under the supervision of a commis
sion or at least a commissioner, from the
United States, in order that revolutionary
tendencies within .Armenia itielf might
not be afforded by the loan a further
tempting opportunity.
Independence of Philippines.
"Allow me to call your attention to the
fact that the people of the Philippine Is
lands have succeeded in maintaining a
stable government since the last action of
congress in their behalf and have thus
fulfilled the condition aet by the con
gress as precedent to a consideration of
granting independence to the islands. I
respectfully submit that this condition
precedent h: ing been fulfilled It is nowi some, whether m America or eisewh.

pie of the islands by granting them th4
independence which they so honorafcl:
