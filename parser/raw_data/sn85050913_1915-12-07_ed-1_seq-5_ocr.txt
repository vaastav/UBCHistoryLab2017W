Washington,. Dec. 8.—The joint
^'i session of the senate ahd house con
veoed -today to listen to President
Wilson's annual message. The gal
leries were .filled and much, interest
-was manifest iif. what the nation's
Jhead might say upon the various is
iues of theday. The president de
rTroted most of his message to consid
eration of national preparedness
and boldly threw down the gauntlet
.'to the opposition. Following is a
review of the document:
Gentlemen of the Congress—'Since' I
?last had the privilege of addressing
you on the state of the UnloU the war
of nations on the other side of the sea,
Which had then only tie
gun to disclose
i?its portentous proportions, has extend
ted Its threatening and sinister scope
'|untll it has swept within its flame
tsome portion of every quarter of the
j-jglobe, nbt" excepting our own hemi
„||spbere, has.altered the whole face of
.^international affairs, and nowpresenta
^a' prospect of reorganization and re
fe|construction. such as statesmen and
IPlpeoples have ne^er been called upon
&':vto attempt before.
The president tells how this country
l^lpracttted neutrality' and declares that
vv^be hopes that when the time comes
X&for readjustment and recuperation this
country will be of infinite service. Be
^ferrlng to Central and South American
^problems, the president declares that
~%we should retain unabated the spirit
which has'ihsplred us throughout the
whole life of our ^government and
l~«
wMch was so frankly put into words
!by President Monroe.
We have been put to the test in the
*5t3Wr "0f Mexlco. snd-WW bave'stood the
test Whether we have benefited Mex
ico by the course we have pursued re
mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in
"her own hands. But we have at least
froved that we Will not take advan
tage of hM in her distress and under
take to impose upon her an order and
government of our own choosing. Lib
erty is often a fierce and intractable
thing, to which no bounds can be set
and to which no bounds of a few
m«ta's 'choosing ought ever to be set.
Every American who has drtinl^ at

Edition must subscribe without reserva-
S: nltion to the high doctrine of the. Vlr
4 Jglnia bill of fights, which in the great

days in which our government was set
up was everywhere, among us accept

trine is, "That government is or ought

all the various modes and forms of

PRESIDENT WILSON'S LATEST
•"•'iia:
2«.j^
picture, fife
(From snapshot taken on Nov
of the spirit of law and independence
and liberty and mutual service.
The president calls attention to the
meeting in Washington recently of
representatives of the pan-American
republics and
says
that economic ad­
justment is Inevitable in the nex gen
eration.
No otte who really comprehends the
spirit of the sreat people for -whom yft
are arointed to speak can fall to per
6ivo that their passion ia for poace,
their genius best displayed.In the prac
tice of the arts of peace. Great democ
racies are not belligerent They do not
seek or desire wnr. Their thonjjfit Is
of individual liberty and of tie freo
labor that supports life and the uil
censored thought that quickens it
Conquest
and
Out of such thoughts grow all our
policies. We regard war. merely as a
means of asserting the rights of a peo
ple agalnat aggression. And we are
as fiercely jealouft of coercive or dicta
torial power within our own nation
as of aggression from without. We
will not maintain a standing army ex
cept for uses which are as necessary
In times of peace as in times of war.
SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN
ft* FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE.
IncrMM Standing Regular Force—Feur
Hundred Thousand Cltlieen Soldiers.
But war has ne^er been .a mere mat
ter of men and gunfi. It is a thing
if disciplined might. I* out citizens
are everjto light effectively, upon a
sudden summons, they*- must know
how modern fighting is done, and what
to do wheu the summons, comes to
render themselves Immediately avail
able and immediately effective. And
the government must be their servant
in tills matter, must supply them with
the training they need to take care of
themselves and of it. The military
arm of their government, which tbey
will not allow to direct them, they may
properly use to serve them and make
their Independence secure, and not
their own independence merely, but
the lights also of those with whom
they have nude common cause, should
they also be put in Jeopardy. They
must be fitted to play the great role
'in the world, and particularly in this
hemisphere, for which they* ar* quali
fied by principle and by chastened am
bition to play.
It is with these ideals in mind that
the plans of the department of war for
more adequate national defense were
conceived which win Ire laid before
you. and which I ur^e you to sanction
and put into effect as scon as they can
be properly scrutinized and discussed.
Tbey seem to me the essential first'
steps, and they, seem to me for the
present su$cient
Tbey contemplate an Increase of the
gtkntHng force of the regular army
from its praBntotrqurito k®23 I1*
cers and 102,985 enlisted men of all
services' to a strength" of T.lSfr'offlcws
and 184,707 enlisted men, or T41,843
all told, all services, rank and file, by
the addition of fifty-two companies of
coast artillery, fifteen companies of en
gineers, ten regiments of Infantry, four
regiments of field artillery and four
aero" squadrons, besides 750 officers re
quired for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all important
duty of training the citizen force of
Which I shall presently speak, 792 non
commissioned officers for service in
drill, recruiting and the like and the
necessary qnota of enlisted men for
the quartermaster corps,- the hospital
corps, the bhlnance department and
other similar auxiliary services. These
are the additions necessary to render
the army adequate for Its present du
ties, duties which it has to perform
not only upon our owa continental
coasts and borders and at our Interior
army posts, but also ii\ the Philippines,
In the Hawaiian Island^, at the isth
mus and In Porto Rico.
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part of Its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale
should Occasion arise the plan also
contemplates supplementing the army
by a force of 400,000 disciplined citi
zens, raised in Increments of 133,000 a
year throughout a period of three
years? This it Is proposed to do by a
process of ienlistment under which the
serviceable men of the country would
be asked to bind themselves to serve
with the colors for purposes 6f train
ing for short periods throughout three
years and to come to the colors at call
at any time throughout an additional
"furlough" period of three years. This
force of. 400,000 men .would be pro
vided with personal accouterments as
fastj. as enlisted and their equipment
for the field nude ready to be supplied
at any time. They would be assem
bled for training at'stated intervals at
convenient places in association' with
suitable units of the regular army.
Their, period of annual training would
not necessarily exceed two months In
the year. 1
the president says It is up to the
patriotic young men of the country to
respond to this call.
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
5f
dominion are not In our
reckoning or agreeable to ofir princi
ples. But just because we demand un
molested development and. t^e undis
turbed government of our own llv«*
upon our own piinclplcs of right and
liberty, we resent, from whatever
quarter it may come, the aggression We
Ourselves will not practice. We insist
upon security in prosecuting our self
chosen lines of 'national development.
We do more than that. We demand it
alscrfor others. We do not confine our
enthusiasm for Individual liberty and
free national development to the Inci
dents and movements of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel it wher
ever tliere Is a people that tries to walk
In these difficult paths of Independent^
and right From the first we have
made common cause with all partisans
of liberty on this side the sea and have
deemed ft as important that our neigh
bors should be- free from all outside
domination as that we ourselves should
be have set America aside as a whOle
for the uses of independent nations and
political freemen. '-'f:
FOR GREATER NAVY.
Always Looked to It as Our F|r*t and
Chief Line of Defense.
The program which will be laid be
fore you by the secretary of the navy
is similarly conceived. It involves only
a shortening of the time within which
plans long matured shall be carried
opt, but It does make definite ahd ex
plicit a program which has heretofore
been only implicit, held in the minds of
the committees on naval affairs and
disclosed in the debates of the two
houses, but nowhere formulated or for
mally adopted. It seems to me very
cUf thtft it will be to the advantkge
of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the
navy upon a final footing of strength
and efficiency and to press that plan
to completion within the next five
years. We have always" looked to the
navy, of the Country as our first and
chief line of defense we have always
seen it to be our manifest course! of
prudence to be strong on the seas.
Year by year we have been creating a
navy which now ranks very high in
deed among the navies of the maritime
nations. We Bhould now definitely de
termine how we shall complete what
we have begun and bow soon.
The program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
Ave years of ten battleships, six battle
cruiser?, ten scout cruisers, fifty de
stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-five coast subm&ines, four gun
boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni
tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one
repair ship. It is proposed that of this
number we shall the first year provide
for the construction of two battleships,
two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers,
fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines,
twenty-five coast submarines, two gun
boats and one hospital ship the second
year two battleships, one scout cruiser,
tea destroyers four fleet submarines*
fifteen coast subnparlnes, One gunboat
and one fuel oil'ship the third year
two battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet
submarines and fifteen coast subma
rines the fourth year two battleships,
two battl» cruisers, two scout cruisers,
ten destroyers, two fleet submarines,
HfteeO coast submarines, one ammuni
tion ship and one fuel oU ship, and
the fifth year two battleships, one bat
tle cruiser, two scout bruisers, ten. de
stroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen
coast submarines, one gunboat, one am
munition ship and one repair ship.
The secretary of the navy Is asking
also for the Immediate addition to the
personnel of the navy of 7,500 sailors.
2,000 apprentice seamen and 1,500 ma
rines. This Increase would be ruffl
ctent to care for the ships which are
to be completed within the fiscal year
1917 and also for the"~number of me^.
which must be put in training to man
the ships, which wli^ be completed
early in 1918. It is also necessary that
the dumber of midshipmen at the Ka
val academy at Annapolis should be
Increased by at least 900 in order that
the force, of officers should be more
rapidly added to, and authority is.ask
ed to appoint for engineering duties
only, approved graduates of engineer
ing colleges, and for service In the avi
ation corps a certain number of men
taken from civil life.
If this fun program should be carried
out we should have built or building in
1921. accoidlng to the estimates of sur
vival and atandards of classification
followed by the general board of the
department, an effecttvevnavy constat*
Ing of 27 battleships of the first line, 0
battle cruisers, 25 battleships of tte
second line, 10 armored cruisers, 13
scout cruisers, 5 first cjas% cruisers, &
second class cruisers. 10 third' class
'mi'.'i-
meiiah,
ci uisers, TL08 ctestroyfers, 18 Tleet sub
marines, 157 coast submarines, 6 mon
itors, 20 gunboats, 4 supfply ships, 15
fuel ships, 4, transports, 3 tenders, to
torpedo vessels) 8 vessels of special'
types arid two ammunition ships. This
would be a navy fitted to our needs
and worthy of our traditions.
But armies and instruments of war
are only part of what has to be con
sidered if we are to consider the su
preme matter of national self sufficien
cy and security in all its aspects.
There are other great matters which
will be thrust upon our attention
whether we will or not. There is, for
example, a very pressing question of
trade and shipping involved In this
vgreat problem of national adequacy.
Tt is necessary for many weighty rea
sons of national efficiency and devel
opment that we should have a great
merchant marine. The great merchant
fleet we once used to make us rich,
that great t6dy of sturdy sailors who
used to carry our flag into every sea,
and who were the pride and often thtj,
bulwark of the nation we have almejst
driven out of existence by Inexcusable
neglect^ and Indifference and by a hope
lessly blind and provincial' policy of
so called econotale protection, ft is
high time we repaired our mistake and
resumed our commercial independence
on the seas.
With a view to meeting these press
ing necessities of our commerce and
availing ourselves at the earliest possi
ble! moment of the present unparalleled
opportunity of linking, the two Ameri
cas together in bonds of mutual inter
est and siervlce, an opportunity which
may aerit return again, if we miss it
now, proposals will be made to the
present congress for the purchase or
construction of ships to be owned and
directed by the government similar to
those made to the last congress, but
modified in some essential particulars.
I recommend these proposals to you
for your prompt acceptance with the
more confidence because every month
that has elapsed since the former pro
posals were' made has made the ne
cessity for such action more and more
manifestly imperative. That need was
then foreseen. It is now acutely felt
and everywhere realised by those fof
whom trad& is waiting, but who can
find ho conveyance for their goods. I
am hot so much interested in the par
ticulars of the program as I am in
taking immediate advantage of the
great opportunity which awaits us if
we will but act in this emergency. In
this matter, as in all others, a spirit of
common counsel should prevail, and
out of it should come an early solu
tion of this pressing problem.
SHOULD AGREE ON POLICY

Rsoommends Early* Adaption of Msas
ures Qivina Ttnm .Fuller Jwstios.
The president recommends the earfy
adoption of bills for th? alteration and
reform of the government of the Phil
ippines and for rendering fuller polit
ical Justice to the people of Porto Rico,
which were submitted to the Sixty
third congress. The president refers
to the increased cost of carrying out
the plans for the armed forces of the
nation and tells of the fiscal problems
confronting the government
Oh the 90th of June last there Was
an available balance in the general
fund of the treasury Of $104,170,105.78.
The total estimated receipts for the
year 191% on the assumption that the
emergency revenue measnre passed by
the last tionferess will not be extended
beyond its present limit, the 81st of
.December, 1915, and that the present
duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar will
be discontinued after the 1st of. May,
1916, will be 1070365^00. The balance
of June last and these estimated rev
enues come therefore to a grand total
of $774,53$,606.78. The total estimated
disbursements for the present fiscal
year, Including twenty-five millions for-,
the Panama canal, twelVe millions for
probable deficiency appropriations and
150,000 for miscellaneous debt redemp
tions,' will be $753,891,000, and the bal
ance ha the general fund, of the treas
ury will be reducid to *20,644,G0o.7£.
The emergency revenue net If contin
ued beyond its present tlme^mitation
would produce daring the^balf year
tlicta-remalning about forty-one mil
lions. The duty of 1 "cent per pound
on sugar If continued Would produce
during the two months of the fiscal
year remaining after the 1st of May
about fifteen millions. These two sums,N
amounting together to fifty-six mil
lions, if added to the revenues of the
second half of the fiscal year would
yield the treasury at the end of the
year an available balance of $76,644,
005.7&
the additional revenues required to
carry ont the program of military and
naval preparation of which I have
spoken would, as at present estimated,
be for the" fiscal year 1917 $93,800,000.
Those figures, taken with the figure^
for the present fiscal year which I
have already given, disclose our finan
cial problem for the year 1917. As
suming that the tax£fl imposed by the
emergency revenue act and the pres
ent duty on sugar are to be discontin
ued and that the balance at the close
of the present fiscal year will be only
$20,044,806.78. that the disbursements
fbr the Panama canal will again be
about $25,000,000 and tbfft the addi
tional expenditures for the army and
navy are authorized by tbe congress,
the deficit In the general fund of tbe
treasury on the 90th of June, 1917.
will be nearly $235,000,000. To this
sum at least $50,000,000 should be add
ed to represent a safe working balance
tot the trOasdry and $12,000,000 to In
clude the usual deficiency estimates In
1917, ahd these additions would make
a total deficit of some $297,000,000: If
-the present taxes should be continued
throughout this year and the next,
however, there would be a balance in
the ''treasury of. some $76,500,000 at
'?p. J-
the end' of the present fiscal year and
a deficit at the end of the next year of
only sbme $50,000,000, or, reckoning ill
$62,000,000 for deficiency appropria
tions and. a safe, treasury balance at
the endt of tbe year, a total deficit of
some $112,000,000. The obvious moral
of the figures is that it ib a plain coun
sel of prudence to continue all of the
present taxes or their equivalents and
confine ourselves to the problem of
providing $112,000,000 of new revenue
rather thaa $297,000,000.
How shall we obtain the new rev-,
enue? We are frequently reminded
that there are many millions of bonds
which the treasury is authorized nnder
existing law to sell to reimburse the
sums paid out of current revenues for
tbe construction of the Panama canal,
ahd it is true that bonds for the
amount of $222,432,000 are now avail
able for that purpose. Prior to 1913
$138 000,000 of these bonds had ac
tually been sold to recoup the expendi
tures nt the isthmus, and now con
.stitute a considerable item of the pub
lic debt But I for one do not belieye
that, the people of this country approve
of postponing the payment of their
bills. Borrowing money Is shortsight
ed finance. It can be Justified only
when permanent things are to be ac
complished Which' many generations
will certainly benefit by and which it
seems hardly fair that a single genera
tion should pay for. The objects we
are how proposing to spend inoney for
cannot be so classified, except in the
sense that everything wisely done may
be said to be done in the Interest of
posterity as well as in our own. It
seems to me a clear dictate ff pru
dent statesmanship and. frank finance
that in what we are now, I hope, about
to undertake we should pay as we go.
The people of the country are entitled
to know Just what burdens of taxation
they are to carry and to know from the
outset now. The new bills should be
paid by internal taxation, --v..
NATION'S SECRET FOES
y/M SH0ULD.BE CRUSHED.
Gravest Danger to Country Comas
From Within Our Own Borders.
The president says-that the precise
reckonings of tbe problem to be met
are set forth in the report pf the secre
tary of the treasury. J'':
I have spoken to you today, fi^nt!^
men, upon a single theme, the thor
ough preparation of the natfota to care
for its own security and to make sure
of entire freedom to play the Impar
tial role In. this hemisphere and in tbe
world which we all believe to have
been provldentiailly assigned to it I
have had in my mind no thought of
any immediate or particular danger
arising out of our relations with other
nations. We are at peace with all the
nations of the world, and there In rea
son to hope that no question in con
troversy between this and' other gov
ernments will lead to any serious
breach of amicable relations, grave as
some differences of attitude and policy
"have been and may yet turn out,"to be.
I am sorry to say that (be gravest
threats against onr national peace and
safety have beep uttered within our
own borders, inhere are citizens of the
United States, I blush to admit, born
under other flags, but welcomed under
Our generous naturalization laws to the
full freedom and opportunity of Amer
ica, who have poured the poison of dls
Idyalty Into the very arteries of our
national life, who have sought to bring
tbe authority and good name of our
government into contempt, to destroy
our industries wherever they thought
it effective for their vindictive pur
poses to striked them and to debase'
onr politics to tlie uses of foreign in
trigue. Their number is not great as
compared with the whole number of
those sturdy hosts by which our na
tion has been enriched in recent gen
erations out of virile foreign stocks,
but it Is great enough to have brought
deep disgrace upon
us
and to have
made it necessary that We should
promptly make use of processes of law
by which we may be purged of their
corrupt distempers.
America never witnessed anything
like this before. It never dreamed it
possible that men sworn Into its own
citizenship, men drawn out of great
free stocks such as supplied some of
the best and strongest elements of that
little, but bow heroic, nation that in a
high day of old staked Its very life to
free Itself from every entanglement
that had darkened the fortunes of tbo
older nations and set up a new stand
ard here—that men of such origins and
such free choices Of allegiance Would,
ever turn In malign reaction against
the government and people who had
welcomed and nurtured them and seek
to make this proud ^country once more
a hotbed of European passion. A lit
tle' while ago such a thing would have
seemed incredible. Because It was in
credible we made no preparation for
It We would have been almost
ashamed to prepare for it as if we
were suspicious qf ourselves, our owrv
comrades and neighbors! But tbe ugly
and incredible thing has actually come
about and we are without adequate
federal laws to deal with it I urge
you to enact snch laws at the earliest
possible moment and feel that in doing
so I am urging you to do .nothing less
than save the honor and self respect
of tbe nation. Such creatures of pas
sion. disloyalty and anarchy must be
crushed out They are not many, but
they are Infinitely malignant, and the
hand of onr power should close over
them at once. They have formed plots
to destroy property, they have entered
into conspiracies against the neutrality
of the government tbey have sought
to pry Into every confidential trans
action of the government In. order to
serve Interests alien to our own. It Is
possible to deal with these things very
effectually. I need not suggest the
terms In which they may be dealt With.

I wish that It could be said that only
a few men, misled by mistaken senti
ments of allegiance to the governments
under which they were born, had been
guilty of disturbing the self possession
and misrepresenting the temper and
principles of tbe country during these
days of terrible warr when it Would
seem that every man who was truly an
American would instinctively make it
his duty and his prldd to keep the
scales of Judgment even.and prove him
self a partisan of no nation but his
own. But It cannot There, are some
men among us and many resident
abroad who, tliougtr\born and bred in
the United States and calling them'
selves Americans, have so fotgotten
themselves and tbelp honor as citizens
as to put their passionate sympathy
with one or the other side in the great
European conflict above their regard
for the peace and dignity of the United
Sthteft. They also preach and practice
disloyalty No laws, I suppose, cafi
reach corruptions Of the mind and
heart bat I sboifld npt speak of others
without also speaking of these and ex
pressing the even deeper humiliation
and scorn which every self possessed
and thoughtfully patriotic American
must feel when he thinks of thein and
of the discredit they are dally bringing
upon us.
Wbat 4a npre important is that the
Industries and resources of the country
should be available and ready for

fn' the meantime may I riiafce this
suggestion? The transportation prob
lem is an exceedingly serious and
pressing one in this country. There
has from time to time ot late been rea
son to fear that our railroads would
not much longer be able to cope' with
it successfully, as at present'equlpted
and co-ordinated. I -suggest that It
would be wise to provide for a com
mission of inquiry to ascertain by a
thorough canvass of the whole ques
tion whether our laws as at present
framed and administered are bs Serv
iceable as they might bA In the, solu

a problem that lies at the very foun
dation of our efficiency as a people.
Such an inquiry ought to draw out
every circumstance and opinion Worth
considering, and we need to know
•11 sides of the matter if we mean to
do anything in the field of federal leg
