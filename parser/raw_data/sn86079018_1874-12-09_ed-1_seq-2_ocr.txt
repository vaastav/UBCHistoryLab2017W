NEW ORLEANS, DECEMBER 9. 1STL
A GLIMPSE AT_THE MESSAGE
Tim President's message, published through
out the country yesterday, is a very shame
1;,I document, r.nd will not foil to call down
L' .cure njion the Admini vtratiou 1 ■ f '' - i
thinl ing i len in all quarters of tie: ountry.
It is a lamentable confession of v.iai.iu.,s and
a proclamation of the President'.- incapacity
f >r dealing v.ith questions ot national impor
I ; -icc. Ho presents the country to the world
in the attitude of a badly governed nation,
v. ith a t -udency to disintegration, and flutters
in the face oi the world a dishonored flag.
Nine years after the close of the war be
tween the States, he exhibits to the gaze ol
the world a country one-halt free and the
other half under the rule ot the bayonet,
though all the States are nominally < quah> in
ia tl.<; confederation. He points Ins bloody
„word towards Louisiana as an illustration ot
the wisdom of his rule, and rails Congress to
witness that in oppressing lier people and in
maintaining a usurpation over them he has
simjilycarriedontthethrc.it ho uttered wnon
he sent his first message to them on the sub
j( ,;t. It i:, a grand thing for the President of
the United States to be able to say to Congress
" I said 1 would do wrong, and 1 have done
wrong."
Having committed an error i.i recognizing
I'iiithhack first as Executive of the Slate, and
siihseqeutly Kellogg, neither of whom bad
been elected by the people, Ire claims credit
for contiuning in that error, and rather glories
over (Lie; fact that, so tin - , the people of tiro
Slate, though, almost a unit a yd ire i Kellogg,
have been unable to place their chosen officers
in power. Notwithstanding his shameful and
utterly unwarranted interference in Louisiana,
and disregarding the fact that tlie infamous
•Jud ;o whoso mid-night order Lie sustained
■m compelled, by the fear ot Lap« acliment
and by popular scorn, to resign the position
he had disgraced, the Pre ddeut ii is the hardi
hood to declare that :
The whole subject of Exec s tive inti r
li-ivucc with (he affairs ol a Kate is repug
nant to public opinion, to tue feelings of
those who from their official capacity must
be used in such interposition and to humolf
tiio.se who must direct. t?) Euless most clearly
on the side of law, such interference becomes a
crime. With the law to support it. it is con
domed without a hearing. I desire, there
fi.r -, that ah necessity for Executive direction
in local aifairs may become unnecessary and
obsolete.
After this hypocritical profession lie goes
into a somewhat extended argument to prove
that while tho citizens of the Southern States,
"the better part of them," desire " to do no
violence, either to individuals or to laws
existing," they have been guilty of justifying
or denying violence in certain localities—
violence which they could have prevented.
We believe it was Andy Johnson who first
publicly achieved the distinction of proving
Mr. Grant to have intentionally auuded tell
ing tho truth, and since that time we have
js.-ver heard anybody stickle for the Presi
dent':, veracity. Certainly there is a boldness
and a dash about his false statements which
lift thrill very larabove the ingenious evasions
and despicubh lies retailed for party purposes
by his hired tools in the South. The follow
ing extract we commend to orv readers as
specially rich, rare and racy :
Let there bo fairness in tu- tu: eu - -ion of
S: luthcru questions, the advocates of both or ill
political parties giving honest, truthful re
pnr.s of occurrences, condemning the wrong
and upholding the right, and scon all will be
well.
This, in view of the insolent altitude as
-.uin d by himself and his bully of an Attorney
G.nnal towards the ^people of New Orleans,
-id to tho delegation sent by them to respect
fully petition lor relief, is decidedly refresh
ing.
HI.-; /.iiY.-i.s.v tu us, under all • •!.- ambiance:«,
!..., been conspicuous. Numb-:s of people
r .member as it it were yesterday, a little man
standing like a bullied school boy confronting
the committe from New Orleans, n the White
House, while in every lineament of his bloated
face was a stolid determination to d teat the
men who had iLured to defy the mandate of his
Attorney General, and com.- t > Washington.
Th. v remember, too. tho insolent bravado oi
• Lie military Attorney Gem nil who s tood glar
ing at tho committee like an orge, resenting
their presence as an insult to his mighty self.
They arc both of them superb samples of fair
men: Heaven preserve us from all such I
The vi ry next sentence in tho message
might be an extract from a Radical stump
speech, and Wl suspect, was intended as a
plank in the President's third term platform.
Entier existing conditions tlic negro votes
flie Republican ticket because he knows his
ion is am of that party. Many a good citi
. en votes the opposite, not because he agrees
witu the great principles of Stat which sepa
rates parties, but because gen.-rail, ho is op
posed to negjro rule. This is . most delusivi
cry. Put the negro as citizen md a yob r as
la: i ; and must remain, nnd soon parties will
> divide d, not on the color line, but on priu
le, and then we shall have no complaint of
sectional interference.
That Grant did not write a lire of -hi- mes
-1 re we deem so certain as not i>> need argu
ment, and that Williams wrote ever; word of
it wo believe is equally sure. Ï: bears all
through the slimy impress of tue man who
has led tho President to the v.rv brink of
destruction. Wo regard the mes. rege alto
gether as an excellent 1 v m- rntic card for
the campaign of ls7i',, and pr ir--, conclu
- it civ, that so far as the President is c.on
i rued lie is wedded to his idols. V. e shall
>eo how lar Congress will sustain ' ui.

THE VIBOIIîIïïS.
The President in his annual message could ,
not overlook the a finir of the A iigmius. There ,
nu,y be State reasons which prevented an early ,
settlement of the claims of our Government j
against Spain, for the execution, in a summary
manner, of the crew ol that vessel.
Britain, owing to the civil war both in Spa
and in Cuba, was not as nrgen
bringing Spain to terms ; but alter granting
duo delay pressed her
kdg«d. and the sum agree
li.fi i -abjects, en Lourd ot thr vessel, were in
Great
s usual in j
-r granting ;
claim, ii was açknow
greed upon paid. Eng
d of the vessel, were in
> better position than American citizens, and
the claim for indemnity for the murder ot
American citizens should have been urged
loir ; ago, and if Spain delayed or declined to
recognize it, prompt measures to force a com
pliance should inr. e been adopted.
Great Britain, in the protection of its sub
jects and the assertions of its rights, acts with
decision. Let us give an instance, worthy ol
all example. /
The English wc-re expelled from the Falk
land Islands by a Spanish force in 17119. The
subject was brought before Parliament, and
the Earl of Chatham, in reply to the Ear} of
Hillsborough, who repres ntecl the Govern
ment in the Cabinet, rose and said:
" The noble Lord talks of Spanish punctil
ios in the lolty style and idom of a Spaniard.
We arc to be wonderfully tender of the Span
ish point of honor, ns if they ixad been the
complainants, as if lin ■;/ liad received the in
jury. I think he would have done better to
have told us what care had been taken oi the
English honor.
*■ AI y Lords, laut well acquainted with the
character of that nation, at least as far as it is |
represented by their court and ministry, and
should think 'tliis country dishonored by a
comparison of the English good faith with
the punctilios oi a Spaniard. My Lords,
tho English are a candid, an ingenuous
people, the Spaniards are as mean and crafty
as they are proud and insolent. With their
ministers I have often been obliged to nego
tiatc, and never met with an instance of can- j
dor or dignity m theit^proceedings; nothing |
but Low cunning, artifice and trick. Alt
S
long experience uf thc-ir want of eaii. b r and
good faith, I found myself compelled to talk
to them in a peremptory, ftecisivc tone. < >n
this principle I submitted my advice to a
trembling counsel for an immediate declara
tion of war with Spain."
If we only had a few sucli statesmen In Con
cress and in tlx Cabinet, the lives of Ameri- [
can citizens would be as sound and as safe in j
every part of the world as those of English- J
men. AVe te-ur that we have none at present. 1
In this A'irginius matter, delay in tho settle
ment of the rights of our Government, and
the pay of a just indemnity for the outrage,
must bring the present Administration into
contempt. National honor, national rights,
require, in their maintenance, prompt ection.
SUPEEI0Ä DISTRICT COURT.
Among other business transacted Monday
morning in this court was a rule taken by the
Sherifi', through his attorney, Mr. E. J. Ellis,
to compel the clerk of the court to issue writs
ot fieri facias in the city tax cases -some ten
thousand iu number which writs, the public
will remember, were suspended by the City
Council a few days since.
The clerk of the court accepted service of
the rule, and at < wee submitted the same.
The rule was made absolute, and tho clerk
directed to issue all tlie writs. It seems rath
er singular that the city was not made a party
to the rule, and more strange still that these
writs should be issued in direct opposition to
the iuutruetions of the Council.
AYo have always understood that the plaintiff
in judgment was tho only party interested, or
had the right to sign fur cr order uf. fa.
AVe would like to bo informed by what au
thority the Sheriff üas proceeded in the mat
ter ot the tax writs, without the cousent of the
city, through her legal representatives, or the
order of the Administrator of Finance.
Since writing the above wo leam tint the
rule referre i to was, upon the motion of Mr.
Ellis, for the Sheriff, rescinded, he having as
certained that the Council desired a stay ol
proceedings in suits for taxes of 1874. Air.
Ellis explains that the Sheriff 's rule was sim
.. .. , , . , . , ,
ply to cause writs to be placed m ins hands
which were issued sometime ago, m conform
ity with thf order of the city's legal advisers,
and which weio still iu the hands of the Clerk.
The city vus not mane a party, because it was
purely a matter, Air. Ellis says, between the
Sheriff and the Cl rk. The City Attorney,
ho asserts, is not authorized to stay
proceedings unices bv special res
olution of the Council. and in his
order he must quote such resolution. Tki^
had not been done to the'knowledge ot the
Sheriff, and hence the rule fo:
the writs t
Sheriff.

DEMANDS
It L :u. excellent precaution to nave two
strings to oni s bow, and no one seems to un
derstand that fact better than Mr. E. H.
Walsh, the aspirant for the office of City At
torney. Mr. Walsh was an assistait under
Mr. Lac-ev, and lias been a candidats for the,
position which he knew was to be made vacant
by the resignation or displacement of Geo. S.
Lacey.
He solicited the place from Mayor Leeds
and th« members of the Council, and went so
far us to address the subjoined letter to Mix
Leeds. It appears, however, that while solicit
ing the Council for the position he was
maneuvering with Kellogg.
He appears therefore i t the attitude of a
man who was asking for a favor from parties
in his opinion, had no right to grant
Will
that favor: in the attitude of respectfully pe
titioning while quietly preparing himself to
change his petition into a demand.
It Mr. Walsh thought tho Council was. os
lie now claims, powerless to till the vacancy
occasioned by the resignation oi'Mr. Lacey,
why did Le appear before it as an ap
plicant for tho office ï
speaks ter itself, and taken iu connection
wkk his later effa ions is remarkable indeed:

' Tlie raids of United States troops upon the
. people ot Edgefield county, fc>. C., wno railed
to vote for Grant's third-term friends at the
late election, are likely to have a different ef
fect from what was anticipated. Goaded be
yond endurance by the arbitrary arrests which
have lately been made, and doubtless encour
aged by the result of the November elections,
the most respectable citizens ot l-ldgcfield as
sembled in mass meeting on Monday last and
determined upon a thorough investigation into
the proceedings of ihe United States marshals
who have been engaged in these outrages,
and upon procuring evidence of the numerous
instances of intimidation of voters by the
Radicals which have taken place in
that county. A committee was appoint
ed for this purpose, and it was also
charged with the duty of ascertaining the
number of gin houses, barns, and other build
ings, which have been burned since the elec
tion, and reporting a reiqedy for the preven
tion of incendiarism. It was shown that the
charges made against the citizens were viie
slanders. Five political arrests had been made
in the county, but not a single charge had
been sustained, and all the accused had been
released. A colored ex-member of th Legis
ture, named Simmons, said that he did not
believe that as much intimidation was used on
tho day of election by the whites, as by the
colored people, and that the shooting at Carry
Ke
added that the majority of the colored nicu
had been w rought up to such a state cf ex
citement, that they did not desire quiet, and
they had plainly told him that they wante-1
nothing to do with him, it he was in favor of
peace with the whites.

THE CITY ATTORNEY'S WAR.
There was considerable curiosity felt
yesterday over what would probably be the
termination of the battle. At the Hall so firm
was Mr. Jonas fixed that it was thought to be
an impossibility to unseat him without the in
terposition of the courts. This morning
Walsh, Kellogg's appointee, appeared before
Hawkins, and addressed the court as follows :
I hold in my band a commission troru Gov.
Kellogg, appointing me to the office of City
Attorney, made vacant by the resignation oi
Geo. 8. Lacey, Esq. i would therefore ask
that the Court would recognize me as Attorney
to represent the city in causes before it. In
asmuch as there are no assistants, I would
state to the Court I am the only'person au
thorized to represent the corporation now.
Hawkins took the commission, read it and
ordered that it be spread on the minutes, and
II. H. AValsh be recognized as the only City
Attorney.
In the Clerk's office all this time tlie wheels
were put in motion and the K< 11 egg machinery
set grinding.
The State, through H. C. Dibble, Assistant
Attorney General, filed, under the intrusion
act, a petition, setting forth that on the -7th ot
December, G. S. Lacey, City Attorney, ten
dered his resignation, which was accepted ;
that by law it is made the duty of the Gov
ernor to till such vacancy lor the unexpired
term ; that accordingly he appointed and
commissioned H. 3L AAalsh to tne position,
who at once qualified and entered upon the
discharge of his duties, and is entitled to
occupy and hold the same tor the unexpired
term ior which said Lacey was elected, viz :
until April, 1377.
Petitioner further alleges that B. F. Jonas,
Esq., ot this city, has attemped to infrude
into, is usurping and is unlawfully assuming
to hold and exercise the said office of City
Attorney. Petitioner shows that said Jonas
claims said office by virtue of a pretended
election of the Council of the city; is not
authorized to till a vacancy in the office of
City Attorney atoresaid, and ihe said pretend
ed election is null, absolutely void and of no
effect.
Petitioner joins in these proceedings H. H.
AValsh, in order that he may be decreed to bo
entitled to tne said office. It further prays for
an injunction to prevent B. F. Jonas from as
suming to discharge the functions ot said
office.
Hawkins has ordered the writ at once to he
issued, and, strange to say, without bond or
notice.
There are seventy thousand men out of em
ployment in New York, all of whom arc ad
\ vised to "go West." Eul exactly what tiny
are to do In the AVest they nr- not advised.
The most bashful man of his time is wouhl
be Gov. Smith, of Arkansas. He proclaimed
himself Governor in a very abrupt way, and
then his diffidence so overcame him that he
hid his blushing face and the rude public has
not seen him since.

it was also proposed to give a number of en
