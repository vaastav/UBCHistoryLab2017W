Washington, Dec. 5. The anntal
message of President McKlnley was
Eent to congress at noon. It io an ex
haustive document, containing about
23,000 words, and Is the longest execu
tive instrument in the history of the
government. An intelligent synopsis

To the Senate and House ot Representatives:
At the threshold of your deliberations
you are called to mourp with 'your coun
trymen the death ot Vice President Ho
bart, who passed from this life on the
morning of November 21 last. His great
soul now rests In eternal peace. His pri
vate life was pure and elevated, while his
public career was ever distinguished by
largo capacity, stainless integrity, and ex
alted motives. He has been removed from
the high ofllce which he honored and dig
nified, but his lofty character, his devotion
to duty, his honesty -of purpose, and noble
virtues remain with us a priceless legacy
And example.
OUTSPOKEN FOR THE GOLD STAND
ARD.
Increased activity In industry, with Us
welcome attendant o larger employment
for labor at higher wages gives to the
body of the people a larger power to ab
sorb the circulating medium. It is further
true hat year by yar, with larger areas
df land Under cultivation, the increasing
voldmd bt agricultural products, cotton,
corn and Wheat, calls for a larger volume
of1 mbney supply. This is especially no
ticeable at the crop-harvesting and crop
moving period.
In its earlier history the national bank
ing act seemed to prove a reasonable ave
nue through which needful additions to tho
circulation could from time to time bs
made. Changing conditions have appar
ently rendered it now Inoperative to that
end. Tho high margin In bond securities
required, resulting from large premiums
which government bonds command in the
market, or the tax on note ls3ues, or both
operating together, appear to be the in
fluences which Impair its public utility.
Tho attention of congress s respectfully
invited to this important matter 'with the
view of ascertaining whether or not such
reasonable modifications can be made in
the national banking rict as will rebder Its
service In the particulars 'here referred
to more responsive to tho people's needs.
I again urge that national banks be au
thorlzod to organize With a capital of $25,
000. I urgently recommend that to support
the existing gold standard, and to maintain
"the parity in value of the coins of the
two metals (gpld and silver) and the equal
power of eyery dollar at all times in the
market and in the payment of debts," the
Bedrdtdry "df the treasury be given addi
tional power and charged with tho duty to
sell United States bonds and to employ
such other effective means as may be nec
essary to thosp ends- The authority
should include the power to sell bonds on
long and shprt time, as conditions may
require, and should provide for a rate of
Interest lower than that fixed by the act
of January 14, 1875. While there is now
no commercial fright which withdraws
cold from tho government, but, on the
contrary, suoh widespread confidence that
gold seeks the treasury demanding paper
money in exchange, yet the very situation
points to the present as the most fitting
time to make adequate prpvhMon to in
sure the continuance of the gold standard
and of public confidence in the ability and
purpqse ,of the government t,o jneqt nil its
obligations in the money which the cjyl
llzed world recognizes as the best. T,he
financial transactions of the government
a'rp cdnducted Upon a gold basis. -We
receive gold when we soil United States
bonds and use gold for their payment. 'We
are malntiplpg,the parity of all .the money
'ijisued or colhed by" authority ot 'the gov
ernment'. "Ware doing1 these thhga With
the means at'hand. Happily at the present
tl,me we are not compelled to report to
loans to supply gold. 'It bfis beep done In
the past, pwev.er, and may have to be
dono in tho future. It behooves us, there
fore, to prdVlde at onco the bdst means to
meet tho emergency when It arises, and tho
fcdat means are those which are the moit
certain and economical. Those, now au
tpdrled hoVe the virtue neither of "dl
rectjadss ndr' economy. vVo "havq already
'eliminated one of the" causes of 6Ur finan
cial plight and embarrassment during the
years 189. lBOi, i86 arid 1896. Our receipts
ndw equal our expenditures; deficient far
nuds no longer create ahum Let us re
move 'the fcniy .remaining cause by pon
fer'rlng tho full and necessary power on
the jecrqtary of the treasury add imppse
uppn him te duty to unhold the present
golp standard and preserve the colds of
the two me'tAIs on n parity with each
other, whldh is the repeatedly declared pal
lcy;pf the United States,
In this connection I repeat my former
recommendations that a portldn ot the
gold holdings shall bo placed In a trust
t
fund from which greenbacks shall bo re
deemed upon presentation, but when onpe
redeemed shall pot thereafter be 'paid out
except lur guiu.
After prdnouhcing for a gold standard,
I the president urges aid for ,thp merchant
iu urine.
TRUSTS.
Combinations df capital organized into
iruiis io cunirpi me cauuiuons 01 iruue
among our Citizens, JLo stifle competition,
limit production, and determine the prices
of products Used rind consumed by the peo
ple, are justly provoking public discussion,
and should early claim the attention of th?
congress.
The industrial commission, created by
the act of the congress of June 18, ISSfS.
has bppn, engaged in extended hearings
upon the disputed questions Involved In
thb subject of combinations In restraint of
tradtf and competition. They have not yet
completed their Investigation of this Bub
Ject, And the conclusions and recdmmen'
datlons at which they may arrive are un
determined. The sdbject is one giving rise to many
divergent views as to tho nature and var
iety or cause and extent of tho injuries to
the public which may result from largo
combinations con tentratlng more or less
numerous enterprises and establishments,
which previously ;o the formation of the
combination Were carried on separately.
It is universally conceded that combina
tions which dngrMs dr coiltrol the market
of any particular .kind of merchandise or
commodity, by suppressing natural and or
dinary competition, whereby prices are
unduly enhanced to the general consumer
ire obnoxious not only to the common law
but also to the public welfare. Thero must
be a remedy for tho evils Involved in such
organization". If the present law can bo
extended more certainly to control or
check these monopolies or trusts, It should
be done without delay. Whatever power the
congress possesses over this most import
ant subject Bhould bo promptly ascertained
and asserted.
It is apparent that uniformity of legis
lation upon this subject in the several
statC3 Is much to be desired. It is to be
hoped that such uniformity founded in a
wise and just discrimination between what
is injurious and what Is useful and neces
sary in business operations may be ob
tained and that means may be found for
the congress within the limitations of its
constitutional power so to supplement an
effective code of state legislation as to
mako a complete system of laws through
out the United States adequate to compel
a general observance of the salutary rules
to which I have retired.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
A review of our relations with foreign
states Is presented with such recommen
dations as are deemed appropriate.
Tho long-pending boundary dispute be
tween the Argentine republic and Chile,
was settled In March last by the award
dt an arbitral commission, on which the
United States minister at Buenos Ayres
served as umpire.
NICARAGUA CANAL.,
The contract of the Maritime Canal com
pany, of Nicaragua, was declared forfeited
by the Nlcardguan government on the 10th
of October, on the ground of ,pon-fulfUl-ment
within the ten years' .term stipulated
in the contract. The Maritime Canal com
pany has lodged a protect against this ac
tion, alleging rights in the,premlses which
appear worthy of consideration. .This gov
ernment expects that Nicaragua will afford
tfbe protestants a full and fair hearing upon
the merits of the case.
Tho Nicaragua canal commission, which
had been engaged upon the work ot exam
ination and survey for a ship-canal roUte
across 'Nicaragua, 'hav'ng completed its
labor's and made its report, was dissolved
on May 31, and dn JUne 10 a new com
mission, known A3 the Isthmian canal
commission, was organized under the
terms .of the act approved March 3, 1829,
for the purpose of examining the Ameri
can Isthmus with a view to determining
the most practicable and feasible routo
for a ship canal across that Isthmus, with
its probable cost, and other essential de
tails. The great importance of this work can
not be too often or too strongly pressed
upon the attention ot the engross. 'In niy
message pf a year ago I expressed my
views of the .necessity of a panal which
would link the two great odeans, to which
I again Invite your consideration. The
reasons then presented for early action
are even stronger now.
The portldll or tho message dealing With
pur foreign relations shows no especial Inci
dent. The Nlcarnguan cunal is urged. Our
trade relations with China arc being
watched, and a good word is then spoken
for the Paris exposition. In speaking of
Great Britain, progress of tho Alaskan
boundary is mentioned.
NEUTRALITY IN SO,UTH AFRICA.
This goyernment has maintained 'an At
titude ot neutrality In the UrifdrtUnate
contest between Great Britain and the
Boer states of Africa. We have remained
faithful to the precept -of 'avoiding en
tangling alliances as to affairs not of our
direct concern. Had circumstances sug
gested that te parties to the quarrel would
have welcomed" any kindly expression of
tho hope dt the Amerjcar) pfdple ihKt war
might be ayerted( good offices would hayp
be,e,ri gladly tendered. TheUnlievl States
representative at Pretoria was early in
structed to Jiee that all neutral American
Interests be respected by the combatants.
This has been an easy task in view ot the
ppsltjye declarations pf both British und
Bppr authorities that tho personal and
property rights of oUr 'Citizens should 'be
observed.
Upon the withdrawal of the British agent
from Pretoria the United States consul
was authorized, Upon .the request of the
British government and with the assent
pf the Bout African apd Orange Fjreo
State govrnmreflto, U eejclqe the cus
tomary gopd dpiqcs of a neutral ,fdr the
care of British interests. In the discharge
qf this function I am happy t.o say that
abundant .opportunity haf beep afforded o
show thp impartiality of this government
tqwfird bpth the cpniMtfinU.
The lyuclilpg of Italjui nubjcpts i,n Lou
isiana is tOjferre, tp and a BatUfadlbry
soiutldn Is expected. Tlie messag'd theh
quotes frdm President Unrrlsyhs 'nicssage,
of 1801 concerning a laSv to punish crimes
agdlnst treaty rights. Congress Is urged
to take up the subject anew. Tho ex
changes of amenities between Mexico and
this country and Japan are detailed.
SAMOA.
Important events have occurred In tho
Samoan islands. The election, accord
ing to the laws and customs of Samca,
of a successor to the late king, Mallctda
Laupepa, developed a contest as to the
j Validity ot the result, Which issue, by
me terms oi me general nqt, was to be
decided by the chief justice. Upon his
rendering a Judgment in favor of Malle
toa Tanu, the rival chief, Mataafa, took
up arms. The active intervention of
American and British warships became
Imperative to restore order, at the cost
of sanguinary encounters. In this emer
gency a Joint commission of representa
tives of tho Unlfe'd States, Germany and
Great Britain was sent to Samoa to In
vestigate the situation and to provide a
temporary remedy. By Its active efforts
a peaceful solution was reached for the
time being, the kingship being ab llshsd
and a provisional government establish
ed. RecommendatlpnB unanimously made
by the commission for a Permanent ad
justment of the Samoan question were
taken under consideration by the three
powers parties to the general act. But
the more they were examined the more
evident it bdeame that a radical change
was necessary In the relations of the pow
ers to Samoa.
The arrangement under w'lich Samo:
was administered had proved impractic
able and unacceptable to all tbe powers
concerned. To withdraw from the agree
ment and abandon the islands to Germany
and Great Britain would not be compati
ble with our Interests In the archlpelagi.
To relinquish our rights In the harb r
of Pago Paao, the best anchorage in th?
Pacific, the occupancy of which had be n
leased to the United States In 1878 by th:
first foreign treaty ever concluded by Sa
moa, was not to be thought of either as
regards tbe needs of our navy or the In
terests of our jrowlng commerce with the
east. We could not btve considered any
proposition for tho abrogation of tbe tri
partite control which jfd not conflr J us in
ail our rights and safeguard all our na
tional rights in the Islands.
Our v'ews commended themselves to the
other powers. A satisfactory arrange
ment wis Concluded between tho gov
ernments ot Germany and of England, by
virtue of which England retired from
Samoa in view of compensation In other
directions, and both powers renounced in
.favor of the United State3 c'l theli rlgh s
and claims over and In respect to that por
tion ot the group lying to the ea3t of the
onft hundred and seventyfirst degree of west
Vmgitude, embracing the Islands of Tutuiln,
t)foo, Qlosenga, and Manua. I transmit to
the senate, for Its constitutional action
thereon, a. convention, which besides thp
provisions above mentioned also guaran
tees us the same privileges and conditions
In resnept to commerce and commercial
vessels in all of the Islands ot Samca a3
those possessed by Germany.
THE PLEDGE TO CUBA.
My annual message' of last year
was necessarily devoted, In a great
part, to the consideration of the
Spanish war and of the results it wrought
and the conditions it imposed for the fu
ture. I am gratified to announce that the
treaty of peace has restored friendly rela
tions between the two powers. Effect has
been given to its most important provis
ions. The evacuation of Porto Rico hav
ing already been accomplished on the 18th
of October, 1898, nothing remained necessa
ry there but to continue the provisional1
military control of tho Island until tbe
congress should enact a suitable govern
ment for the ceded territory. Of the char
acter dnd scope of the measure to that end
I shall treat in another part of this nioi
sage. The withdrawal of tho authority of
Spain from the island of Cuba was ef
fected by the 1st of January, so that the
full re-cstablishment of peace found tho
relinquished territory held by us In truut
for the Inhabitants, maintaining under the
direction of the executive, such gsVern
raent and control therein as sboUld conserve
public order, restore the productive condi
tions of peace so long disturbed hy the in
stability nnd disorder which prevailed for
tho greater part of the preceding three de
cades, and build up that tranquil develop
ment of the domestic sta,te wberohy alone
can be realized the high purpose, as pro
claimed n the Joint resolution adopted by
congress dn the 10th ot April, 1893, by
which the United States disclaimed any dis
position or intention to exercise sovereign
ty, Jurisdiction, or control pver Cuba, ex
cept, for the pacification thereof, dnd as
serted its determination when that was ac
complished to leave tho government and
control ot tho island to Its people. The
E ledge cdntalned In this resolution is ot the
Ighest honorable obligation and must be
sacredly kept
I believe that substantial progress bps
been mado In this dlrcctlqn. All the ad
ministrative measures adopted in GUba
have aimed ,to fit It for a regenerated ex
istence by enforcing the supremacy ot
law and justice; hy placing wherever prac
ticable the machinery pf admln)8.tratlpn in
the hands df tho Inhabltanfs; by Institut
ing heeded sanUary TefdraBj, by spreading
education; by fostering industry and
trade; by Inoulcating publlo morality, and,
In shprt, by taking .eyery ratipnal step to

Unity which fits an VnJlght'elxM community

After the Cuban question, the message

lations with Laln. In sneaking of TUrkpy,

' "j-rtTErtNATtONXL ARBITRATION.
In rcspdnso tp the 'Invitation ot his
tpajeety, thp mpdror of ,Russta, delegates
from' tWcntyslx countries Wero assembled
ftt The Hague on the 18th df May, 'as mem
bers of a'cbjerpneo in the Interest of peace
The commission frpra the United Suites
"consisted pf tho Hon. Atidrew D, White, the
Hon. Seth'Lofr, the Jfon, 'Stanford Newel,
Captain Alfred T. "Mahttn. of the United
States navy,. Captain WJUhm Crozler, rff I
the United' Stdtes army, and the "Hon I
Frederick W. tfolls, secretary. Tho occa-1
s,on seemed to be opportupe for the serious
consideration of a plan tor the pacific
adjustment of International differences, a
subject in which the American people have
beep deeply interested for many years, and
a definite project for a permanent Inter
national tribunal was inoluded In the in
structions to the delegates of the United
States.
Tho final act of the conference Includes
conventions upon the amelioration of the
laws and customs of war n land, the
adaptation to maritime warfare of the
principles of the Geneva convention of
18(H, and the extension of judicial meth
ods to international cases. The Conven
tion for the Pacific Settlement of Interna
tional conflicts embodies the leading fea
tures of the American plan, with such
modifications as were rendered necessary
by the great diversity of views and inter
ests represented by tbe delegates. The
four titles of the convention provide for
the maintenance of general peace, tho ex
ercise of good offices and mediation, the
formation of commissions of Inquiry, and
International arbitration.
THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT.
Since my last annual message, and in
obedience to tho acts of congress of April
22 and 26, 1398, the remaining volunteer
force enlisted for the Spanish war, consist
ing of 34,834 regulars and 110,202 volun
teers, with over EOOO volunteer officers, hps
been discharged from the military service.
Of the volunteers, 667 officers and 14,831
men were serving In the Philippines, nnd
1650 of the regulars, who were entitled to
bo mustered out after the ratification of
the treaty of peace. They voluntarily re
mained at the front until their places
could be filled by new troops. They wera
returned home In the order In which they
went to Manila, and are now all of them
out of the service and In the ranks of
citizenship. I recommend that the con
gress provide a special medal of honor for
tho volunteers, regulars, sailors and ma
rines on duty In the Philippines who vol
untarily remained In the service after
their terms ot enlistment had expired.
By the act of March 2, 1899, congress
gave authority to Increase the regular ar
my to a maximum not exceeding 65.0Q0 en
listed men, and to enlist n force of 35,000
volunteers, to bo recruited from the coun
try at large. By virtue of this authority
the regular airay has been increased to
the number of 61,999 enlisted men and
2248 officers, and new volunteer regiments
have been oiganized aggregating 33,050 en
listed men and 1524 officers. Two ot these
volunteer regiments are made up of col
ored men, with colored line officers. The
new troops to take the places of those re
turning from the Philippines have been
transported to Manila to the number of
581 officers and 26,322 enlisted men of the
regular army and 594 officers and 15,3S
enlisted men of the new volunteer force,
while 504 officers and 14,119 men ot the
volunteer force are on the ocean en route
to Manila.
The forso now in Manila consists ot 9v
officers and 80,578 regulars, tuid 594 officers
and 15..3S8 of the volunteers, making an
rggregate of 1499 officers and 45,966 men.
When the troops now under orders
Brill reach Manila the force In the ar
chipelago Will comprise 2051 officers and
63,483 men. The muster out df the gredt
volunteer army organized for the Sranlah
war and the Cientiou of a new army, the
transportation from Manila to San Fran
cisco of those entitled to discharge, and
the transportation of the new troops to take
their places have been a work of great mag
nitude well and ab. done for which too
much credit can not be given the war de
rartment. The Insular mall service Is next treated,
showing how It has been improved by
United States postal anthoiltics Tho navy
Is praised.
PATENTS.
Our future progress and prosperity de-
pend upon our ability to equal, If not sur
pass, other nations In the enlargement and
advance of science, Industry and commerce.
To Invention we must turn ns one of the
most powerful aids to the accomplishments
of such a result. The attention cf tho con
gress Is directed to the report of the com
missioner of patents, In which will be
found valuable suggestions and recom
mendations. PENSIONS.
On tho 30th of June, 1899, the pension
roll of the United States numbered 991,
519. These Include the pensioners of the
army and navy in all our wars. Tho num
ber added to the rolls during the year was
40,991. Tho number dropped by reason of
death, remarriage, minors by legal limi
tation, failure to claim within three years,
and other causes, was 43,1SC, and the num
ber ot claims disallowed was 107,919. Dur
ng the year 89,054 pension certificates were
issued, of which 37,077 were for new or
original pensions. The amount disbursed
for army and navy pensions during tho
year was $1381355.052,95. "which Vyas $1,651,
461.61 less than the sum of the appropria
tions. Tho Grand Army of the Republic at its
recent national encampment held in Phil
adelphia has brought to my attention apd
to that ot tho congress the wisdom apd
justice of a .modiflcatlpn pf thp third sec
tion of the act nf June 27, 1890, which pro
vides pensions for the widows of officers
and enlisted men who served ninety days
or more during tho war of the rebellion
and wero honorably discharged, provided
that such Widows are without 'other means
of support than their daily labor and were
married to tho soldier, sailor or marine on
account of whose eerylpe they claim pen
sion prior to the date of the act.
Thp present holding df 'the department
Is that if the widow's Income aside f0m
her dally labor does n,Qt exceed In amc-u;$t
what her pension would Jje, towlt, $96 per
annum, she would h,e d,eerae tp bo without
pther meaps of support, than her daily la
bor, and would bo entitled to a pension
tinder this act: w'hllo If tho widow's in
come independent- pf the ampunt repelyed
by her as tho result pf 'her dally labor
exceeds '$96, she Wul'd 'not bo pePslonablo
under the act. I 'am advseil by the com
missioner ot pensions that the amount ot
the income allowed before title to pension
would bo barred) h?s varied widely undei
different ndmlnlstratldhs of tho penplon
office, as well as 'dUrlrig different peridtto
of the samo administration, nnd has; been
thp cause of Jut cpmplajnt anil crUlpiera.
With tho approval, df the Bccre,ta,ry df
the Interior thd cdmmlssloner of nenslohs
recommends that, In order to mpke tho
practice at all times uniform apd tp d,o
Justice to the dependent widow, tho
amount of Income allowed independent ot
the proceeds of her daily labor should not
be less than $250 per annum, and he urges
that the congress shall so amend the
act as to permit the pension office to grant
pensionable status t6 Widows under tho
terms of the third section of the act of
June 27, 1S90, whose Income aside from
tho proceeds of dally labor is not in ex
cess of $250 per annum. I believe- this to
be a simple act of justice and heartily
recommend It.
The next census, Pacific railways, pres
ervation of forests and tho agricultural In
terests of the Country are dlccuxHed, nnd
then the president deals nlth the Philip
pine; question. He reviews the ceding of
the Islands to the United States by Spain
and says that no opportunity was lost to
nsstire the people of the Islands of our de
sire for their welfare. Events ore re
viewed which led up to an outbreak, quo
tations being made from the leport of the
Philippine commission.
THE PHILIPPINES.
The unfavorable circumstances connect
ed with an active campaign hayo not been
permitted to Interfere with the equally
important work of reconstruction. Again I
invite your attention to the report of the
commissioners for the interesting and en
couraging details of the work already ac
complished In the establishment of peace
and order and the Inauguration of self-governing
municipal life in many portions of
the archipelago. A notable beginning has
been made In the establishment 'of a gov
r nmont in tho Island of Negros, which
Is deserving of special consideration. This
was tho first Island to accept Amorlcan
soerelgnty. Its people unreservedly pro
claimed allegiance to the United States
and adopted a constitution looking to the
establishment of a popular government.
It wa3 impossible to guarantee to tho
people of Negros that the con
stitution ho adopted shoufil bo the ulti
mate form of government. Such a ques
tion, under the treaty with Spain and in
accordance with our own constitution and
laws, came exclusively within tho juris
diction of the congress. The government
actually cet up by the Inhabitants of Ne
gros eventually proved unsatisfactory to
the natives themselves. A new system
was put into force by order of tho major
general commanding the department, of
which the following are the most impor
tant elements:
It was ordered that the government ot
the island of Ncgrcs should consist of a
military governor appointed by the United
States military governor of the Philip
pines, and a civil governor and an advisory
council elected by the people. The mili
tary governor was authorized to appoint
secretaries of the treasury, Interior, 'agri
culture, public instruction, an attorney
general, and an nudltor. The seat ot gov
ernment was fixed at Bacolod. The mili
tary governor exercises the supreme ex
ecutive power. He is to see that the laws
tre executed, appoint to office, and fill all
racancles in office hot otherwise provided
for, nnd may, with the approval of the
military governor of the Philippines, re
move any officer from office. The civil
gdvernor advises tho military governor on
all public civil questions and presides over
the advisory council. He, In general, per
forms the duties which are performed by
secretaries df state In our own system of
government.
The advisory council consists of eight
members elected by the people within ter
ritorial limits which are defined in the or
der of the commanding general.
The times and places of holding elec
tions are to be fixed by the military gov
ernor of the island of Negros. The qual
ifications of voters are as follows:
(1) A voter must be n male citizen of
the island of Negros. (2) Of the age of
21 years. (3) He shall be nble to sneak.
read, and write the English, Spanish, or
I Visayan language, or 'he must own real
property Worth $500, or pay a rental on
real property of the valuo of $1000. (
Ho must have reuded In the island not
less than one year preceding, and In the
district in which ho offers to register ns
a voter not less than three months im
mediately preceding tbe time he offers to
register. (5) He must register at a time
fixed by law before voting. (6) Prior to
such registration he shall havo paid all
taxes due by him to the government. Pro
vided, that no Insane person shall bt al
lowed to register pr vote.
The military governor has the right to
veto all bills or resc'utlons adopted by
the advisory council, and his vetj is final
it not disapproved by tho military gover
nor of the Philippines.
The advisory council discharges all the
frdlnary duties of a legislature. The usual
duties pertaining to said offices are to bo
performed by the secretaries of tho treas
ury, Interior, agriculture, public Instruc
tion, the attorney general, and the audi
tor. Tho Judicial power is vested in thrpo
Judges, who are to bo appointed by tire
