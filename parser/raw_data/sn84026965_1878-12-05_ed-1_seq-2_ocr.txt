THURSDAY MORNING, DEC'R 5, 1878.
FROM COLUMBIA.
OUR EDITOKJAL LETTER.
Since its organization, the Legislature
has been industriously engaged at the
work before it with a view of effecting
an adjournment before Christmas, and
the prospect for accomplishing this result
is good, since both Houses have passed
the concurrent resolution fixing the 23rd
of this month as the date of final adjourn?
ment, and it cannot now be changed
without consent of both the Senate and
House of Representatives. The date was
fixed thus early in the session, in order
to stimulate the members to work rapid?
ly, so that a short session might be se?
cured and the wishes of the people car?
ried out. If this date had not been fixed
thus early, the introduction of bills, reso?
lutions, &c., would have continued, and,
instead of adjourning before Christmas,
we would only have taken a recess and
returned for an indefinite period after the
holidays, while by the course pursued it
is expected to wind np with a session of
only twenty-eight days.
THE WORK
to be done in the time allowed is con?
siderable, and the financial portion of it
will be very embarrassing. There are
deficiencies from last year which will
have to be paid off out of the next tax
.levy; the Bills of the Bank of the State
are still a very troublesome problem to
deal with; the report of Commissioner
Coit upon the floating indebtedness of
the State presents a little over a million
dollars of indebtedness after scaling it to
fifty cents on the dollar, which must be
provided for, and then comes the ordi?
nary expenses of the government The
?ession has not progressed sufficiently to
tell what will be done with the Bills of
the Bank of the State, or the floating in?
debtedness, but, of course, the deficien?
cies of last year and the expenses of the
government for the current year must be
met in full, and unless the present Leg?
islature makes very material reductions,
the rate of taxation will of necessity be
very much increased. The present body
not only is embarrassed by the expenses
of the government during their own
term, but will also have the additional
burden of clearing up the arrearages of
last year. The members of both Houses
have addressed themselves assiduously to
the task, and in addition to the short ses?
sion, there is every probability that the
per diem will also be cut down. Dr.
John Wilson, of our delegation, has in?
troduced a bill fixing the per diem of
members at
THREE DOLLARS PER DAY,
and there is very little doubt that it will
be adopted, and thus the Legislature
having cut down their own compensa?
tion, will be enabled to curtail other ex?
penses without subjecting themselves to
criticism. Three dollars a day is a small
compensation, but it is sufficient to se?
cure the services of as good men as can
be procured at higher salaries, and there?
fore it is all that the State ought to pay.
The reduction will make the position a
more honorable one than it would be
with a high salary, for the experience of
every State has been that high salaries
for members of the Legislature brings
into competition for the office a class of
aspirants who care more for the money
than for the honor of representing their
constituents. There are a number of
arguments which will be adduced in sup?
port of this bill if necessary. It is, how?
ever, useless to occupy the time of our
readers in recounting then, for nine
tenths of them,are fully satisfied that the
reduction should be mado, and it is this
well-known public sentiment which will
secure its passage. Dr. Brown, of our
delegation, filed a protest against one
Hastings Gantt, who was elected to the
House of House of Representatives from
Beaufort, on the ground that he is dis?
qualified to serve as a member because
he is known to have accepted
A BRIBE FROM PATTERSON
in some of the legislation concerning the
Blue Ridge Railroad. The protest will
result in expelling Gantt, and, although
another Radical will be elected, the
party will learn that it is useless for
them to continue electing their corrupt
men to office, for they will not be admit?
ted to seats in a body which will in
future be controlled by gentlemen. Mr.
Murray has introduced, among others, a
bill to employ convicts sentenced to
County jails upon the roads and streets
under direction of County Commission?
ers, which, if passed, will utilize a set of
criminals who have hitherto been a bur?
den without any benefit to the County.
Last session of the Legislature there
were fifty charters granted by the Legis?
lature which could have been given by
the Clerk of the Court in each County,
and these charters at a moderate estimate
cost the State twenty thousand dollars.
The same thing was begun again this
session, but has been checked by indefi?
nitely postponiug the first one presented.
This motion to postpone was made by
Mr. Murray, and a spirited debate of
half an hour followed, after which the
motion was carried by a majority of two.
It has, however, put a stop" to this useless
consumption of time and expenditure of
money.
There are several very important mat?
ters which are being carefully approach?
ed by their advocates, and upon the re-'
suit of these movemeuts will depend very
great interests of the State. Prominent
among these is the movement which was
introduced by General Gary in the
Senate
TO REPEAL THE BOND COURT,
which in all probability will pas3 both
branches of the Legislature soon Un?
less this is done, there is a strong proba?
bility that the Court will decide the
State debt valid, inasmuch as the testi?
mony of Kimpton and others was kept
out of reach during the trial of the caic,
and the State's attorneys were cnly able
ti present a part of the evidence going
to show the fraudulent character of por?
tions of the debt. It is, therefore, it
ee ?ms to us, the duty of the Legislature
to step in and protect the people from
the burden likely to be rivcied upon
them forever.
THE rHOSPHA fL QUESTION
fa up again, but has not Leon dcvclcfed
sufficiently to be the subject of much
comment, though it is a very important
matter for the whole State. In a future
letter wc wiii endeavor to give a review
of the subject, and speak of what dispo?
sition should be made of it.
The Legislature, though composed of
new members principally, is fast becom?
ing familiar euough with law-makiug to
call the ayes and noes, which is some?
times done on the most trivial matters,
at a cost t > the State of about fifteen
dollars for each call. It is frequently
done for the purpose of making capital
for men who think they are voting on
the popular side of the question. It is
proper, in voting upon main questions,
that the roll should be called whenever
it is desired ; but when it takes 'he shape
of electioneering, and is done over every
little motion, it becomes rather an ex?
pensive mode of electioneering, and
should not be indulged in.
There will soon be a change in the
Superintendent of the Penitentiary, as
Col. Parmele intends to resign, and the
Anderson and other delegations are press?
ing the claims of Maj. T. B. Lee, the
first Superintendent, for re-appointment,
with excellent prospects of success. Maj.
Lee is a very efficient aud competent
gentleman, who would, no doubt, suit
better for the office than any man we can
find.
The Supreme Court has just decided
the cases of Smalls and Cardozo against
them, so that these worthies will be
brought to puuishment at last, unless
they are pardoned by the Governor,
which we trust will not be done. There
has been an abundance of foolishness in
South Carolina towards the criminals
who have infested our State, and it is
about time now, we think, to let justice
reign for a term at least. Under the
sentences Cardozo goes to jail for two
years, and Smalls to the Penitentiary for
three years.
GOV. HAMPTON'S CONDITION
has been quite alarming to his friends
recently, and the worst results were fear?
ed. He has been unable to sec company
lately, and has been threatened with se?
rious complications from his wounds.
On Saturday it is thought his system
reached the crisis from the wound, and
during that day his physicians, even,
dreaded what twenty-four hours might
bring about. Telegrams were sent, and
doctors came on special trains from Au?
gusta and Charleston, and on Sunday
earnest p?ayers for the restoration of the
Governor to health went up from every
pulpit in Columbia, and on Sunday
evening all of tbe congregations of the
city assembled at the Methodist Church,
where a union prayer-meeting was held
for the purpose of continuing the suppli?
cations to a Throne of Grace in his be?
half. His situation is, it is thought,
slightly improved, though it is still criti?
cal, and his friends watch with great
anxiety the varying indications. His
restoration to health will be a slow and
tedious process, which will, when it is
accomplished, leave him with a stiff limb
for the remainder of his life. The peo?
ple of the State have learned by the
Governor's absence to appreciate him
more highly than they ever did before,
and it is now certain that on next Tues?
day he will be elected United States
Senator to suceeed Patterson on the
fourth of March. The probability is
that his election will be unanimous.
THE JUDGESHIP
of the Third Circuit, to fill the vacancy
occasioned by tho death of Judge Shaw,
was filled on last Tuesday by the election
of Hon. T. B. Frazer, of Sumter, who is
an able and high-toned gentleman, by
whose election the Bench of South Caro?
lina has secured an upright and pure
Judge to replace the lamentsd Shaw.
THE UNITED STATES COURT
is still in session, Judges Bond and Bryan
presiding. It is, however, robbed of its
promised importance by the continuance
of most of the election cases, and the
attendance, outside of the jurors and
lawyere, is composed of about four-fifths
of negroes, many of whom have been
brought hither at the expense of the
Government to tell their marvelous tales
of intimidation, fraud, &c. Tiie cases
are evidently intended to get up Repub?
lican campaign literature, for, to give an
example, Mr. Peebles, of Sumter, was
arrested, gave bond and went home, after
which the witnesses were examined in
Columbia, and their testimony taken
down. Judge Northrop and E. W. M.
Mackey are both directing the prosecu?
tions without much credit to themselves
or benefit to the Government. As mill?
ers in the outrage business, they appear
to be a very diminutive success, not be?
cause the spirit is unwilling, but became
the flesh is weak.
Columbia bids fair to be very lively
this winter, but it is likely that the mem?
bers of the Legislature will be kept too
busy and receive too little pay to afford
them much opportunity for participating
in it. M.
The Supreme Court of South Carolina
has decided, in the case of Elihu Daven?
port and wife againstElizabeth Caldwcll,
that the Probate Court has no jurisdic?
tion under the Constitution of this State
to parti Lion real estate. The decision is
a startling one to the legal fraternity
throughout the State, as perhaps nine
tentbs of the estates which have been di?
vided since reconstruction have been par?
titioned in the Probate Court, and this
decision unsettles all titles which have
been acquired under such sales. The de?
cision is good law, as the highest Court
in the State has rendered it, but there
can be no doubt that it is a very unfor?
tunate one for the people, not only be?
cause it invalidates hundred* of titles,
but also because it necessitates the par?
tition of estates in the Circuit Court,
which will be a slower and more expen?
sive mode of procedure. The Legisla?
ture is looking into the matter, and will
do all that can be done by that body to
remedy the evil, but, as the defect is con?
stitutional, any relief which may be at?
tempted will be of doubtful validity.
The people and the bar will no doubt
a^ree with us when we express the opin?
ion that it would have been better for
the Supreme Court to have stretched the
law to sustain the jurisdiction of the Pro
bale Court raOicr than have rendered a
decision which will work mi much injus?
tice and inconvenience without con?
ferring any good in compensation there
GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.
We publish in this issue the annual
message of Governor Simpson. As a
State paper it is concise, clear and prac?
tical. The Governor does not deal in
fanciful speculations or abstract theories,
but places before the Legislature the
living questions of tbe day, upon the
consideration of which depend the peace
and prosperity of the people of the State.
The message truly urges two tilings as
essential to the progress and prosperity
of the State: good government, which it
asserts wc now have, and the develop?
ment of the differeut departments of hu?
man industry. While government can?
not create capital and labor in a country,
it cau and ought to protect capital, en?
courage labor, and by wise and judicious
legislation render each of these efficient
in developing the agricultural, commer?
cial and manufacturing interests of the
State. The miserable government of
eight years paralyzed capital, demoral?
ized labor and brought the people of the
State to the verge of ruin. Two years of
intelligent and honest government has
done much to repair the ruin brought
about by the Radicals, but much yet re?
mains to be done, and it will require the
wisdom of the executive and legislative
departments combined with renewed
energy and industry to restore general
prosperity. The message in its tone is
mild and considerate, and its recommen?
dations will claim tbe attention not only
of the Legislature but of the whole coun?
try. *
President Hayes, in his annual mes?
sage sent to Congress on last Monday,
dwells at length on the frauds and in?
timidation practiced at the late elections
in the South, especially designating the
States of Louisiana and South Carolina,
and declares his intention to investigate
and punish the guilty parties. This is
all right as far as it goes, for a number
of those charged with the offences have
been discharged upon preliminary exam?
ination, and the intimidation, of which
so much has been alleged, will be shown
to be falsehoods, made by Radicals for
Northern consumption. Again, we have
not heard of the arrest of a single Radi?
cal by the Federal authorities for intimi?
dating Democrats, when it is well known
that colored Democrats were ostracised,
beaten and excluded from church mem?
bership because they voted against the
Radicals. Colored Radicals voted with?
out molestation or hinderancc, while
colored Democrats were denied these
rights. The President holds that Con?
gressional elections, in every district, are
justly a matter of political importance
throughout the whole country, and while
this is true, how much more important is
the election of President by the millions
of voters of the whole country? and
if fraud in the election of a member of
Congress is a great crime, what is the
nature of the crime that foists upon the
forty millions of the inhabitants of the
country a fraudulent President, who was
defeated by half a million of votes? Mr.
Hayes holds his office by one of the most
stupendous political frauds ever imposed
on a people, and ill becomes him to lec?
ture on the subject until his own skirts
arc cleansed.
The Abbeville "Moonshiners."
The facts of the supposed attack on
revenue officers in Abbeville County, as
given by the Press and Banner, are as
follows:
1. A posse of revenue officers came to
the Lowudesville neighborhood still
hunting.
2. They found a still, but not an illicit
one.
3. A few reckless youths came near
the house where the "revenues" were
spending the night; remaining 300 yards
from the house, they sent one of their
number to warn the "revenues" that a
large force of armed and dangerous men
were not far off, and if they valued their
lives they must leave the county within
three hours.
4. The revenue officers hurried off to
Abbeville Court House.
5. The house was not "surrounded."
G. There was no "band of armed men
of at least forty."
7. The practical jokers did not even
come to the house.
The Abbeville Medium says : "The re?
port that the revenue officers had been
attacked and fired upon in this county,
near Lowndesville, has proved to be all
a hoax, and thus more Radical thunder
is destroyed. The truth seems to be that
they were at the house of Mr. Harden
having a good time, and that some
drunken men fired pistols near the house,
but did not shoot at anybody at all.
Tbe revenue officers paid no attention to
it whatever, and said that they were
never treated better anywhere in their
lives."
The Ninety-Six Guardian says of the
Revenue disturbances which occurred
recently in Abbeville county:
"The disturbance which occurred near
Calhoun's Mills, in this county, last
week, between a posse of revenue officials
and some citizens of that locality, is un?
fortunate in view of the amnesty arrange?
ments made this summer by Governor
Hampton with the Federal government.
We are not prepared to blame the citi?
zens, for wc know them lobe law-abiding
and peaceable, and we know that the
officers, or some of them, of that squad,
are good men, acting in the line of their
duty. In the absence, then, of definite
knowledge, wo forbear to criticise the ac?
tion of cither party, iiut wc would urge
upon our people the advisability, even
the policy, of strict obedience to the law.
We have no particle of k unless lor the
onerous burden of revenue taxation.
Hut it being the law, there can be no
two opinions as to the expediency, even
the desirability of observing it strictly."

SUPREME COURT DECISION.
The Court of Probate "Without .Turisilic
tlon in the I'urlltlun of Itoal Estate?An
Important Ouestion Settled.
The Supremo. Court lias filed its de?
cision in the case of Elibu Davenport ct
ux. against Elizabeth Caldwcll. The
chief point of interest to the public is
contained in the following extract:
The fifth and eighth grounds of appeal
relate to the jurisdiction of the Court of
Probate in cases of partition of real es?
tate. If that court has no jurisdiction in
cases for the partition of real estate, then
all its proceedings in relation thereto
were null and void, and should be so de?
clared. Where nothing appears on the
face of the proceedings to show a want
of jurisdiction, and .lie objection is not
made in the court below, it cannot be
taken in the Court of Appeals. (Varney
vs. Vocb, 3 Hill, 237.) But, as was held
in Hill vs. Robertson. 1 Strob., p. 1, "the
proceedings of a court of limited juris?
diction in a case clearly without its juris?
diction are absolutely void, and may be
so declared wherever the question is pre?
sented, whether directly or collaterally."
Neither can failure to take objections at
the proper time, nor consent, can give
jurisdiction. (Gallman vs. Gallinan, 5
Strob., 207,) except in cases where, under
certain circumstances, the court might
take jurisdiction. (Miller vr, Furne, Bail?
ey's Eq., 181.) Where the case is such
that, under no circumstances, could it be
brought within the jurisdiction, then ob?
jection may be made at any stage of the
proceedings, as was said by Moses, C. J.,
in Walker vs. Creaswell, 4 S. C. Rep.,
856: "We have no hesitation in saying
that, whore there appears lo be a clear
want of jurisdiction, the court is not pre?
vented from so declaring because the ex?
ception is not made by the party against i
whom it is to operate." And again:
"When a court takes cognizance of cases
in which the very nature of its organiza?
tion prevents it from entertaining the
issues made between the parties, and its
means of administration prevent an en?
forcement of any judgment it may there?
in pronounce, the objection to its juris?
diction may be made at any time."
The objection, therefore, in this caso;
although it should properly have been
made in the Circuit Court, has not come
too late, if, as contended, the Probate
Court has no jurisdiction in a case for
the partition of real estate, and the ques?
tion must therefore be considered.
The act of the Legislature, Sec. 41,
Rev. Stat., 573, does undertake to con?
fer such jurisdiction. But the court
concurs in the views expressed by Moses,
C. J., in his separate opinion in Mc
Namee vs. Waterbury, 4 S. C. Ren.,
167-S, that to determine the limits of the
jurisdiction of the Court of Probate, we
must look to the constitution, by which
instrument jurisdiction is conferred. In
this respect the constitution of 1SGS
differs widely from that of 1790. By the
latter the judicial power of the State was
"vested in such superior and inferior
courts of law and equity as the Legisla?
ture shall, from time to time, direct and
establish," and it was left to the Legisla?
ture to distribute the judicial powers
amongst the several courts so establish?
ed ; while by the former (constitution of
1S0S) the judicial power is vested in the
several courts named, and in such mu?
nicipal and other inferior courts as the
General Assembly may deem necessary,
but the jurisdiction of each of those
named?amongst them the Court of Pro?
bate?is defined and specified. The
jurisdiction thus defined und specified by
the constitution can be neither enlarged
or diminished by the legislative power of
the State, which is itself the creature of
the constitution, and controlled by the
provisions of that instrument which con?
stitutes fundamental law. Looking to
the constitution, then, for the limits of
the jurisdiction of the Court of Probate,
we find those limits defined in section
20, article 4, and, as there defined, cases
for the partition of real estate are not
embraced. The Court of Probate is, un?
questionably, a court of inferior and
limited jurisdiction ; when the exercise
of any power is claimed for a court of
that character, it must be shown to exist
by express grant, or to be necessarily
consequent upon some power clearly
given. The power here exercised by the
Court of Probate is not expressly grant?
ed in the constitution, nor is it necessa?
rily consequent upon any power which is
given. The conclusion follows that the
power does not exist.
It is possible that, had the decree of
the Court of Probate been final in its
nature, its adoption by the Circuit Court
might have operated as a decree or judg?
ment of that court, which, unquestion?
ably, has jurisdiction in partition of real
estate. But such is not the case, and
the decision of the Circuh; Court, while
it affirms the decision of the Probate
Court, remands the case for further pro?
ceedings in that court. The judgment
of the Circuit Court, therefore, failed to
cute the defect of lack of jurisdiction,
and neither judgment can 3tand.
It is unnecessary to consider the re?
maining grounds of appeal, as they are
in effect disposed of by the conclusion on
the question of jurisdiction.
The judgment of the Circuit Court is
reversed, and the case remanded, with
instructions that the proceedings in the
Court of Probate be dismissed, so far as
t/icy relate to partition of real estate.

Tlic Wilson-Sanders Bud.
An affair of honor, known to have aris?
en between Mr. James L. Wilson, of
Yorkville, and Mr. George M. Sanders,
of Sumtcr, culminated in a duel near
Pineville, N. C, in which both parties
escaped unhurt.
During the recent fair at Columbia
these gentlemen were together on the
fairgrounds, having been schoolmates a
few years ago at Yorkville. and out of the
discussion of some trivial matter grew a
difference which resulted in Mr. Wilson
addressing Mr. Sanders a note inviting
that gentleman to meet him in Augusta.
Mr. Sanders replied accepting the invita?
tion, but before he could get off to Augus?
ta, whither Mr. Wilson with his second
had gone, an officer stopped him, and
thus for A few days the matter was at a
stand-still. Finally, it was arranged to
meet at Pineville, S*. C, and accordingly
all parlies passed up on Tuesday itfter

Synopsis of the President's Message.
Washington, December 2.
The Presidents anniiid message was pre?
sented to Congress today, lie thanks
the Divine Being for His continued be?
stowal of countless blessings upon our
country. Wc are at peace with all na?
tions. Our credit was propably never
stronger before. There have been abun?
dant harvest, reviving our industries, and
there is promise of continued prosperity,
lie reviews the history of the yellow
fever epidemic, and says: The fearful
spread of this pestilence has awakened a
very general public sentiment in favor
of national sanitary administration,
which shall not only control quarantine,
but have the sanitary supervision of in?
ternal commerce in times of epidemics,
and hold an advisory relation to the State
and municipal health authorities, with
power to deal with whatever endangers
the public health, and which the munici?
pal and State authorities arc unable to
regulate. The national quarantine act,
approved April 2!?, 1S7S, which was passed
too late in the last session of Congress to
provide the means for carrying it inte
practical operation during the past scososi
is a step in the direction here indicated.
In view of the necessity for the most ef?
fective measures, by quarantine and
otherwise, for the protection of our sea?
ports and the country generally, from
this and other epidemics, it is recom?
mended that Congress give to the whole
subject early and careful consideration.
The permanent pacification of the
country by the complete protection of
till citizens in every civil aud political
right continues to be of paramount in?
terest with the great body of our people.
Every step in this direction is welcomed
with public approval, and every inter?
ruption of steady and uniform progress
to the desired consuination awakens gen?
eral uneasiness and widespread condemna?
tion. The recent Congressional elections
have furnished a direct and trustworthy
test of the advance thus far made in the
practical establishment of the right of
suffrage, secured by the constitution to
tbe liberated race in the Southern States.
All disturbing influences, real or imagin?
ary, bad been removed from all of these
States.
The throe constitutional amendments,
which conferred freedom and equality of
civil and political rights upon the colored
people of the South, were adopted by
the concurrent action of tbe great body
of good citizens who maintained the
authority of the national government
and the integrity and perpetuity of the
Union at such a cost of treasure and
life, as a wise and necessary embodi?
ment in the organic law of the just re?
sults of the war. The people of the for?
mer slave-holding States accepted those
results, and gave, in every practicable
form, assurances that the thirteenth,
fourteenth and fifteenth amendments,
and laws passed in pursuance thereof,
should, in good faith, be enforced, rigid
idly and impartially, in letter and spirit,
to (be end thai the humblest citizen,
without distinction of race or color,
should, under them, receive full and
equal protection in person and property
and in political rights and privileges. l>y
these constitutional amendments, the
Southern section of the Union obtained
a large increase of political power in
Congress and in ihe Electoral College,
and the country justly expected that
elections would proceed, as to the enfran?
chised race, upon the same circumstances
of legal and constitutional freedom and
protection which obtained in all the
other States of the Union. The friends
of law and order looked forward to the
conduct of tiiese elections as offering to
the general judgment of the country an
important opportunity to measure the
degree iu which the right of suffrage
could be exercised by the colored people,
and would be respected by their fellow
citizens ; but a more general enjoyment
of freedom of suffrage by the colored
people, and a more just and generous
protection of tiiat freedom by the com?
munities of which they form a part
were generally anticipated than the
record of the elections discloses. In
some of those States in which the color?
ed people have been unable to make their
opinions felt in the elections, the result
is mainly due to influences not easily
measured or remedied by legal protection;
but in the States of Louisiana and South
Carolina at large, and in some particu?
lar Congressional District outside of
those States the records of the elections
seem to compel the conclusion that the
rights of the colored voters have been
overridden, and their participation in the
elections not permitted to be cither gen?
eral or free.
It will bo for the Congress for which
these elections were held to make such
examinations into their conduct as may
be appropriate to determine the validity
of the claims of members to their seats.
In the meanwhile it becomes the duty of
the Executive and Judical Departments
of the Government, each in iLs province,
to inquire into and punish violations of
the United States which have occurred.
I can but repeat what I said in this con?
nection in my last message, that what?
ever authority rests with mo to this end
I shall not hesitate to put forth, and I am
unwilling to forego a renewed appeal to
the'legislatures, the courts, the executive
authorities, and the people of the States
where these wrongs have been perpetrat?
ed, to give their assistance towards bring?
ing to justice the offenders and prevent?
ing a repetition of the crimes. No means
within my power will be spared to obtain
a full and fair investigation of the alleg?
ed crimes, and to secure the con?
viction and just punishment of the
guilty.
It is to be observed that the principal
appropriation made for the Department
of Justice at the last session contained
the following clause : "And for defray?
ing the expenses which may be incurred
in the enforcement of the act approved
February twenty-eighth, eighteen hund?
red and seventy-one, entitled "An act to
amend, an act approved May thirtieth,
eighteen hundred and seventy, entitled
an act to enlorce the right of citizens of
the United States to vote in the several
States of the Union, and for other pur?
poses, or any acts amendatory thereof
or supplementary thereto."
It is the opinion of the Attorney-Gen?
eral that the expenses of these proceed?
ings will largely exceed the amount
which was thus provided, and I rely
confidently upon Congress to make ade?
quate appropriations to enable the Exe?
cutive Department to enforce the laws.
I respectfully urge upon your atten?
tion that the Congressional elections, in
every district, in n very important
sense, are justly a matter of political in?
terest anil concern throughout the
whole country. Each State, every polit?
ical party, is entitled to the share of
power which is conferred by the legal
and constitutional suffrage. It is the
right of every citizen, pos-essing the
qualifications prescribed by law, to cast
one uuintiinidated ballot, and to have his
ballot honestly counted, :-'n long as the
exercise of this power and tho enjoyment
of this right arc common and equal,
practically as well as formally, submis?
sion to the results of tho suffrage will be
accorded loyally and cheerfully, and all
the departments of government will fee]
the true vigor of the popular will thus
expressed. No temporary or adminis?
trative interc-ls of government, however
urgent of weight, will ever displace the
zeal of our people in defense of the prima?
ry rights of citizenship, They under?
stand that the protection of liberty re?
quires the maintenance, in full vigor, of
the manly methods of free speech, free
press, and free soli'rago, and will sustain
the full authority of government to en?
force the laws which are framed lo pre?
serve these inestimable rights. The ma?
terial progress and welfare of the States
depend on tho protection afforded to their
citizens. There can he no peace without
such protection, no prosperity without
peace, and the whole country is deeply
interested in the growth ami prosperity
of sill its parts.
While the country has not yet reached
complete unity of feeling and reciprocal
confidence between the communities so
lately and so seriously estranged, I feel
an absolute assurance that the tendencies
are in that direction, and with increas?
ing force. The power of public opinion
will override all political prejudices, and
all sectional or State attachment-?, in
demanding that all over ou.' wide terri?
tory the name and character of citizens
of the United States shall mean one and
the same thing, and carry with them
unchallenged security and respect.
A favorable view is taken of the rc
cstablishment of a Chinese legation in
the United States, and mention is made
that a treaty looking to the furtherance
of commercial intercourse between Japan
and America has been made, and will be
submitted for the consideration of the
Senate.
The President then refers briefly to
the Halifax award, saying that the cor?
respondence will be laid before Congress.
Reference is made to the termination
of the insurrection in Cuba, and while
expressing confidence in the strength of
the Mexican government to repress in?
cursions into our territory, he says: "I
shall take the earliest opportunity to re?
cognize their ability to restrain ma?
rauding parties." He hopes the coming
international exibition in Mexico will
tend to a better understanding and in?
creased commercial intercourse between
the two countries.
After summarizing Sherman's report,
the President says: "In the present
financial condition of the country, I am
pursuaded the welfare of legitimate busi?
ness and industry of every description
will be best promoted by abstaining from
all attempts to make radical changes in
existing financial legislation. Let it be
understood that during the coming year
the business of the country will be un?
disturbed by governmental interference
with laws affecting it, and we may con?
fidently expect that resumption of specie
payments, which will take place at the
appointed time, will be successfully and
easily maintained, and that it will be
followed by a healthful and enduring re?
vival of business prosperity."
The creation of additional Circuit
Judges is recommended as a remedy for
the delay of justice and possible oppres?
sion to suitors, occasioned by the great
increase in the business of the Supreme
Court and t f the courts in many of the
circuits.
The President concurs in the recom?
mendations of the Secretaries of War and
the Interior, that Congress should pro?
vide for the organization of a corps of
mounted Indian auxiliaries, to be under
the control of the army, and to be used
to keen unruly Indians on their reserva?
tions or repress disturbances. This
would weaken the restless clement among
the Indians by giving a number of young
men congenial employment, and would
aid the army in the task for which its
numerical strength is sometimes found
insufficient. The President thinks, how?
ever, that although this force must occa?
sionally be employed to prevent or re?
press, Indian troubles, wise preparation
should be made to that end, and greater
reliance must be placed on humane and
civilizing agencies for the ultimate solu?
tion of the Indian problem. It is alike
our duty and interest to help the Indians
attain the highest degree of civilization
possible for them, and past experience
with many tribes affords great encour?
agement for a continuance of the civil?
izing policy. The President expresses
no opinion as to whether or not the con?
trol of the Indian service should be
transferred from the Interior to the War
Department, but hopes Congress, in de?
ciding that pending question, will not
overlook the considerations above indi?
cated.
A Sao Accident.?The following
particulars arc given of a sad accident
at Edgefield on the 25th ult.: Charles S.
Harrison, an estimable young man of
about 22 years of age, in company with
Capt. Bclanger, a friend of his, were
shooting at a mark with a pistol, and
from some cause or other the ramrod be?
came detached from the pistol and fell to
the ground.
Capt. Belanger picked it up, and,
whilst trying to replace it on the pistol,
the weapon fired, the ball entering the
forehead of young Harrison, who was
standing by him, just between and a lit?
tle above the eyes. Harrison fell and
died in a few moments. He was a young
man of unexceptional character, and be?
loved by all who knew him, and was a
son of Col. Stewart Harrison, who once
filled the office of Clerk of Court with so
much distinction and ability for a num?
ber of years. He leaves a widowed
mother, a brother and a sister, besides a
circle of friends, to weep and mourn over
his early grave.
The Edgefield Rifles, of which he was
a loved and honored member, buried him
this afternoon a 4 o'clock with military
honors in the village cemetery, and as
the reverboanuing echo of the volley
which they fired over his grave died away
among the hills and was lost in the even?
ing breeze, itsigned a mournful requiem to
his departed young spirit and warned his
comrades and friends of the often too
frequent and careless handling of fire
arms.
?Nemo.
Tax on Ton.vcco.?Notwithstanding
the protest of Commissioner of Internal
Revenue Raum against the proposition,
the Southern and Western tobacco man?
ufacturers will make an earnest effort to
secure a reduction of the tobacco tax
from twenty-four to sixteen cents per
pound. It will be remembered that the
House last year passed a revenue bill
making, among other reductions, a re?
duction of the tobacco tax. It is now
with the Senate finance committee. Mr.
Birwell, who represents the Southern
tobacco men, arrived here to-day, and
feels confident that the tobacco move?
ment will succeed.? Washington Klar. ?
