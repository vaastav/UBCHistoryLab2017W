GALLIPOLIS.
THURSDAY. ! : DEC. It. 1861
. yTbe annual Message of Presi
dent Lincoln was read to both branches
of Congress on the Sd iaat. Its length
precludes us from giving it entire, and
as it has been published for some days
past in the Cincinnati dailies, many of
which circulate in our counties, most
of oar readers will ere this hare pe
rused it, and willingly excuse us from
its publication.
It opens with a rery short and pithy
congratulation on the health of the na
tion, and abundant harvest of this year.
Without any prefatory remarks, the
President at once pitches into the af
fairs of the nation in a style peculiar to
himself. Our Foreign relations are
briefly adverted to, and all anxiety in
regard to difficulties therewith, shown
to be unnecessary from the facts that
the rebels received muchlesseneourage
ment abroad, than was at first anticipa
ted, and the interest of other nations
being manifestly furthered by prompt
aid in crushing out the rebellion.
But the President is not unmindful
that preparations for war should be
made in time of peace, and therefore
urges measures for defence of our
coast line and lake harbors.
Also for the construction of a rail
road to conotel the loyal parts of Ten
nessee and North Carolina with Ken
tucky. This road would be of immense
service and will doubtless meet with
prompt attention from Congress.
Why we should longer hesitate to
acknowledge the Independence of Li
beria and Hajti, the President don't
see. On this point, many will see vari
ous good reasons for not doing it.
Under the present status of our govern
ment, it is hardly advisable to stir up
any new questions in which the "nig
ger" U made the prominent feature.
It is enongh now to dispose of the
tangled and knotty questions surround
ing him at home. Those outside of
our limits can bide their time.
His remarks on the Ju.liciary are
sound, and if adopted will be of great
advantage and convenience in the ad
ministration of Justice.
On the collection of claims due
Northern loyal men, from citizens of
seeeded States, he does not take the de
cided stand we could wish to see adopt
ed. He leaves the wh le matter to
Congress, and by it we hope to see
adopted such measures as will force
the seceshera to disgorge part of the
plunder, thus taken from oar fellow
citizens. It is morally right. The
mode of enforcing it may not be
strictly legal, but those who claim
equity should do equity. This, the
traitors have not done, and we are
therefore in favor of Judge Freese's
mode of enforcing collections.
The President touches lightly upon
the power of the Court of Claims, but
directly to the point. As it now stands,
the labors of the Court are very often
fruitless. Make its judgment final, and
end all useless litigation. The business
will be hereafter largely increased by
this war, and now i the time to place
the Court cn a firm bsis, and some
thing more certain and conclusive, than
a voluntary arbitration.
He recommends the re annexation
of that portion of the Dis'rict of Co
Iumbia which was r-liiiqui.-hed to Yir
ginia. This is right if only to place
the refractory village of Al undris un
der loyal rule, and as much of Virgi
nia territory aa possible. She is in I
fair way to be dismembered, and anv
fragment annexed to loal States is so
much rescued from treason and des
potisra.
The oiilj remaining topic of interest
is the "Contraband question," and It is
cot easy to solve, either for the Txesi
dent "or any other man."
The fact that it has already caused
fin outbreak in the Cabinet, and a dis
cord where all should be harmony, is a
sufficient excuse for leaving it to Con
gre68, as the President has done.
We did expect to see the Adminislra
tion adopt tome line of policy on this
vexed question, which would enable
the public to see what object they had
in view, and whether the perpetuity of
the Union and slavery was the design
of this war, or the preservation of the
Union at all hazards, and let slavery
lake care of itself. It ia certainly the
bull that has madly attempted to butt
the train off the track. If in the eon
test it should itself be thrown over the
embankment and the train move on,
we say "sarved 'em right,"
On the whole the President has evi
dently had an eye to the welfare of the
Union men in the rebel States, and by
very possible means endeavored to
r
of those who wish to return to their al
legiance. HU honesty of purpose n
manifest, bat we doubt the policy.
Time will how. .
J3 Mr. Pmslzt Mabtih, living
near the mouth of Raccoon, had his at
tention drawn on Monday morning, to
a riderless horse with saddle and bridle
on, which bore the appearance of hav
ing been in the water, and his suspicions
being aroused that some unfortunate
strsnger had attempted to ford the
creek and lost his life, led him and
others to investigate the matter. Tbey
found where tha horse entered the
water, and where he came out on the
opposite side. The creek was dragged
between those points, but no body was
found.
Since writing the above, we learn
that the horse belongs to a Mr. Watson
who had loaned it to a school teacher
in his neighborhood. We could not
learn the name of the man supposed to
be drowned.
Coworbssiosal. The President's
Message was sent in Tuesday noon.
Resolutions passed the House by a large
majority, confiscating the slaves of
rebels. Resolutions were also adopted.
that the President be requested to order
Mason and Slidell to be confined in
felon's cells until Cols. Corcoran and
Wood should be released from their
barbarous treatment, and should re'
ceive the attention due to prisoners of
the United Slates. It is evident that
work will be done promptly, and that
retaliation will be one of the measures
to bring the rebels to terms.
Tbe Triasubt Rkport. Secretary
Chase'a report is finished. It is said
to contain a more profound and original
discussion of financial questions than
the treasury reports for many years
past. It estimates the public debt in
1 863, at the present rates of expendi
ture at eight hundred millions. It
will recommend a tax upon promissory
notes, and also upon bank notes in
order to remove them from circulation,
and substitute the currency of the
United States, and deeds of eon
vevanee, a duty upon liquors and
tobacco, and an inciease of those upon
tea, coffee and sugar.
It touches the Slavery question in a
paragraph advising the confiscation of
rebels property, as a means of rev
enue. He excepts slaves, because the
United States cannot become a slave
holder, but he recommends emanei
pation and the employment of the
liberated negroes in the service of the
Government.
Death or Old Residents. Two
of the oldest residents of Gallipolis
died during the past week. Mr. Mat
thew Walxer, on Saturday last, in the
73d year of his age, and Mr. Peter
Crapdu on the following Monday even
ing, aged 82 years. Mr. Walker was
a native of Berwick. Scotland, and emi
grated to this country and settled in
Gallipolis ia the year 1817, where he
resided up to the time of his death.
Mr. Chapdu was a native of France
and came to Gallipolis about the year
1810. His remains were followed to
the grave by the Masonic Fraternity,
of which he was a devoted member.
They were honest men.
3TFrom the Richmond Examiner
we quote prices of provisions in that
market at wholesale prices. Baron
(hog round) 23 to 26 cents. Butter 45
to 50, very scarce. Corn meal 80 to
85. Candles 20 cents. Coffee, none
in market. Hay 3 1 25 per cwt Pig
Iron 845. Leather 65 cents, demand
far beyond supply. Pepper 70 to 75
cent, very scarce. Salt, 8 9 60 to 810
per sack, dee. Ac. At Lynchburg, salt
ia np to 820 per sack. No wonder
Flovd and Wie wanted a foot-hold in
the Kanawha Valley. Happy country
where such prices prevail.
7The Sorghum crop in Illinois
this year is estimated at 81,000,000,
and enough of it to keep down the
price of cane sugar and molasses. In
La Salle county, 2250 barrels were
made of sorghum syrup. In the State
of Iowa, large quantities were made
1so. In Indiana almost enough to
supply the entire demand. Thus are
we becoming every day more indepen
dent of the South and her manufac
tures. Dr. W. S. Wortmah. This eminent
physician informs us that he will be in
Gallipolis on Tbcrsdat, December 19M,
and those wishing to consult him will
have an opportunity by calling at the
Valley House on that day. Dr. W. is
very successful in the treatment of lung
diseases, as hundreds in this county can
attest, and it will be gratifying to many
to learn of his coming. His patients
accord to him skill and success in the
treatment of all forms of chronic dis
ease.
Dog Lost. -A black and white
spotted pop of the "English Coach"
breed, atrayed from Mr. W. H. Pxe

XrThe lot of a soldier ny be sj
hard one, but if there is anything eon-
nected with the service still more so,
...... . , .
rt is the lot of a Government horse or)the
mule. We were forcibly reminded of
this fact by the appearance of a few
hundred that arrived at our wharf last
week, on board the Gleenwood and
Mary Cook. They not only exhibit the
horrors of war and its infernal destruc
tion of life and property, but -also a
carelessness on the part of teamesters,
wagon-masters, dec, that is most repre
hensible. Tbe terrible effects of star
vation manifested by those Irving skel
etons, are too apparent to deceive any
one. Excessive labor baa not brought
it about. Many of them have no marks
of harness or anything showing that
they ever were worked at all. Indeed
we have been credibly informed that
large numbers of horses sent up Kana
wha, had been tied up to trees or picket
ed out without food or water for days
at a time. Men who would suffer such
a state of things, ought to be taken out
some fine morning and shot, without
distinction as to his standing, whether
as an officer or driver. There must be
now in our county over one thousand
head of these "Rosinantes," all from
"Rosencrans"' division. Aside from
mercy to poor dumb brutes, the cost of
their keeping may be of benefit to our
farmers. Whether the Government
would not hsve saved money by shoot
ing or giving away one half of them,
and selling the other half for what they
would bring, is a question not very dif
ficult to solve. Should the war close
in the spring not one in ten would then
sell for the cost of keeping. But so we
go, and "how not to do it" seems to be
the order. Capt. Boogebs, the gentle
manly Quarter-master at this post is do
ing his utmost, under the circumstances
by which he is surrounded, to save
these horses. If a little discretionary
power to sell, exchange, or even give
away some of them were allowed him,
we are confident it would prove bene
ficial to the Government. As it is he
ean do nothing but suffer them to pine
away and die, in consequence of the
crowded condition of the stables, where
as if they were in other hsnds, they
might in many cases be saved. We
hope to see this point attended to.
Rapid Bridge Bcildiko. The Fif
teenth New York Regiment, says a
Washington correspondent, this after
noon made a first attempt at pontoon
bridge building, near their camp on the
eastern branch of the Potomac. The
pontoons of India-rubber were inflated,
and a bridge of one hundred and eighty
eight feet long laid in thirty three
minutes. Fifty men then crossed at or
dinary and double quick time, and on
the run, and horses walked over.
The regiment is supplied with a pon
toon train and tools for constructing
bridges and fortifications.
tW Jefferson Davis by his last mes
sage, did the Union cause great service,
by declaring that he had appointed
Mason and Slidell embassadors of the
Southern Confederacy. " But for this
admission, it would be hard if not Im
possible to show the fact, and appear
ances would be sgainst us. In conse
quence of neglecting to search their per
sons or bagcrage, all papers going to
show their mission were destroyed, and
they might have set up the plea that
they were only passengers on their way
to Europe. Luckily for Capt. Wilkes,

proof of this all important fact. Thus

ty with England, on this or any other
point, has signally failed. Let us hope
for its continuance, at least until all ac
counts are squared with Davisdom,
then if the British lion feels disposed to
show his teeth, our gallant volunteers
will pay their respects to him, by wsy
of "easing off" their return to civil
life.
ryWe noticed with pleasure the
Government teams under charge of Mr.
Wing ate, busily engaged one day last
week in bauling gravel upon the square
and side-walks, when it was necessary
for the convenience of the U. 9. officials-'
If all the wagon-masters were as alien-1
live to their duty ss our friend Wingate, I
would be a happy time for the horses
at least. Although busily engaged eve- j
ry day, the teams under his charge look
as fine as though kept in a band box.
He evidently understands his business
as well as duty, and his drivers also.
Seeing the effects of the teams upon our
wharf and streets, he is willing, when
they have nothing else to do, to make
all possible repairs by hauling gravel,
cinder, dec. This is so different from
the course pursued by most of our ar
my men, that we cannot refrain from
bestowing upon it our hearty commen
dation, and trust it may be continued.

Report of thb Skc-itabt or rat
I'timob. This report furnishes some
'imtig tatiaties regarding the op
w erations of the General Land Office,
bnsioeM rf
states, has been sensibly affected br
the decline of business throughout the
country. On the 30th of September,
1861, there were 55.555.595 25 acres
of the public landa which had been sur
veyed but not proclaimed for public
sale. The lands surveyed and offered
at public aale previous to that time, and
those subject to private entry, amoun
ted to 78,662,735 64 acres, making an
ggregate of public lands surveyed and
ready for sale, of 134,218.330 89
acres. The net income from sales du
ring the last fiscal year will hardly
reach the sum of 8200,000. -The
grants of swamp and overflowed lands
to the States' have absorbed a large
amount ot valuable lands and caused a
heavy drain upon the treasury. The
claims of the several States cover an
Sgregate ol 67,895.577 40 acrea.
The bounty land warrants and scrip
issued under different acts of Congress,
previous to September 30, 1861, em
brsce an aggregate of 71,717,172 acres
ol land.
The propriety of issuing bounty land
warrants to tbe volunteers is, tbe bee
retary says, subject of discussion.
and must be determined by Congress
He expresses his disapproval of such
grants, for the reason that a warrant
for 160 acres to each volunteer engaged
in the service would absorb over one
hundred millions of acres, and destroy
all hope of derivin? any revenue from
the public lands for many years, at the
aame time affording but little benefit
to our soldiers.
Our Indian affairs are described as
being In a very unsettled condition, the
spirit of rebellion having been instilled
into a portion of the Indian tribes by
emissaries from the insurrectionary
States. The payment of annuitiea to
these Indians has been suspended.
The insurrection of the Southern
Stales haa affected the Patent Office to
a very great extent. The receipts
from January 1 to September 30, 1861,
were 8102,808 18; and the expendi
tures were 8185.594 05, showing an ex
cess of expenditures over receipts of
882,785 87. During the correspond
ing period of tbe last year the receipts
were 8197,348 40, being 894,840 22
more than the receipts for the same
part of this year.
Tbe Secretary expresses his gratifi
cation at the unprecedented success of
the means taken for the suppression of
the African slave trade. Five vessels
have been seized, tried, and condemned
by tbe Courts. One slaver has been
taken on the coast of Africa with about
nine hundred negroes on board, who
were conveyed to the republic of Li
beria. One person has been eonvicted at
New York as the captain of a slaver,
having on board eight hundred cap
tives, snd two others, (matesof a dif
ferent vessel,) and another onrat Bos
ton for fitting out a vessel for the slave
trade. In the first named ease the pen
alty is death; in the other it ia fine and
imprisonment. Hitherto convictions
under the laws prohibiting the slave
trade have been very rare.
The report closes with a statement of
the condition, financial and otherwise,
oi tne amerent public institutions in
the District.
WAR NEWS.
Gen. Patterson has called for a court
of Inquiry of his conduct in the cam
paign of last spring an J summer.
Lieut. Hare of the New York 31st
has been placed in close confinement.
charged with sleeping on his post in front
of the enemy. The penalty if convicted
is death.
Indications seem to justify the belief
that the whole rebel force on the Up
per Potomac is preparing to retire.
Arrivals from Kentucky bring cheer
ing news of the prospects of the Union
forces. It is stated positively that the
. , i 11
rebel Buckner has a much smaller force
. . . . .
than has been generally estimated.
.,. , ,. . ,
His army at Bowling Green is less than
20,000 strong, and arrangements
are
already perfected which will compel
him to surrender or retreat rapidly into
Tennessee.
It is the intention of Gen. McClellan
to consolidate the different companies
of each regiment of the regular army.
Tbe exigencies hitherto had made it
necessary to scatter that force so that
hardly a whole regiment of the old
army wss together. To effect this con-
solidation, a number of companies of
infantry are to be sent to Fort Pickens,
where the rest of their regiments are
stationed, and other companies are to
be brought from Pickens here, to fill up
the regiments to which they belong,
thus in a little while each of the regi
it ments will be all together for tbe first
time since the Mexican war, and in
time since
many instances for tbe first
they were organized.
Flag Officer Foote, commanding the
Mississippi Flotilla, wants a thousand
more seamen from the lakes. The De
partment could spare him but six hun
dred, and now needs all that can be
raised on the seaboard.
A brigade of Gen. Mc Call's division,
with a squadron of cavalry and battery
of artillery, supported by another bri
gade of the same division, went out
ten miles toward Drainsville, last night,
the direct object being to capture two
notorious Secessionists named Coleman,
and to procure forage. When near
Drainsville, the two Coleman brothers
were seized, and three brothers Boole,
notorious Secessionists, who were in
the habit of shooting down Union men, 1
whether citizens or soldiers. Fifty
seven wagon loads of grain were
brought in. No enemy was seen.

PHILADELPHIA, December 7.
I
The substance of the news from Port
Royal by the Vanderbilt, at New York,
is as follows:
General Viele'a expedition had not
yet sailed, but was expected to leave
immediately upon the arrival of an ex
pected accession of troops.
Beaufort still remained unoccupied,
but was visited daily by officers of the
army and navy, and the two gun boats
Kept watcn and ward over ber fortunes.
During the few days which preceded
the sailing of tbe Vanderbilt, stables
had been constructed on Hilton Head
Island for eleven thousand horses; nu
merous ordnance store houses had been
erected, and the entrenchments across
the Island had been completed and the
guns mounted.
In addition to all this, several im
port ant reconnoissances hsd been made,
which had resulted in establishing the
fact that the whole seaboard from Ty-
bee Island to Charleston is virtually in
the hands of the National forces, it
having been entirely deserted by the
wniieinnaoitants.
On the other point of the island, at
the northern extremity of St, Helen
Sound, a field work was found which
had mounted four or five guns, but it
was entirely abandoned, as was also a
battery on the A she poo and one on the
Uoosaw rivers.
The greatest distance reached inland
was twelve miles, and the reeonnoiter
ing party approached within thirty-two
milea of Charleston.
Tbe blacks everywhere seem to have
remained behind when their masters
fled, and welcomed our men with re
joicing.
In some Instances the cotton houses
were set on fire on the approach of the
Union troops, but this incendiary move
ment was by no means so general as
the Charleston papers would have us
suppose.
Immense quantities of the staple are
already for transportation, and under
the regulations recently issued by Sec
retary Chase will soon be feeding the
looms of the .North.
[From the Gallipolis Journal.]
Ma. Harper: An article appears in
the last number of the Journal written
by the "Forty-firslers" from the court
house which deserves a passing notice
They speak of "the kind and generous
manner .n which they were treated by
ladies and citizens of Gallipolis. ' This
we know to be true. But how was this
kindness and generosity reciprocated?
Let those of us who suffered by the de
struction of our property answer.
The regret at not "being able to eat a
lhanksgiving supper at our hospital
was a one si, led affair altogether. One
special cause of Thanksgiving on part
of many of our citizens, was the de
parture of the Forty-first. As to the
"accursed traitors ' they "snow" are
among us, why did they not seize them,
or quarter upon them, Instead of quar
tering on and destroying tbe property
of the best Union men in our town?
Even if we have traitors among us,
hitherto, their presence had not pro
duced one-tenth of the dissatisfaction
the "Forty Craters' did, in the few
days they were here, and a common
remark about town was, that Jenkins
himself, would not have been more de
structive. It may be some of our ladies "will
tarry" until the end of the "big war,"
but hardly on account of any of the
"forty-firsters," unless the service
should improve both their manners and
morals, a thing devoutly to be wished
for, but hardly probable, so long as of
ficers countenance insolence in their
men, and wink at petty depredations
npon poultry yard and hen roosts.
That they were "all right on tbe goose

the waters edge. The crew were placed
in irons and on the 21st the Nashville

Thursday states that a desperate fijht
took place a day or two since in Wirt

much larger number of Moccasin Ran
gers. Capt. Simpson s men were in a
house fettinff something to eat, and
the house was surrounded by the Moc
casins, who demanded surrender.
Capt. Simpson declined and a fight en
sued. Some eight or ten of the Moc

number killed of the Moccasins is the
notorious Pat. Connoly, who has boas
