- The contest has a great educational
value and Is based upon the following
points: Identification of varieties
one-third, scoring one-third,
correct placing of plates of same
variety one-si\th, and reasons for so
placing ono-sixth.
When one realizes the great variation
in coloring, shape, size, etc.
which the same variety of apples
will take on in different sections .of

that it is no easy task lo merely

The "Corn Clnb Spirit."
At a corn show held at New Martinsville
recently it developed that s
two boys stood tied for first prize? ?
the prize offered for the acre pro- '
duction contest. oBth hail produc- '
ed god crops, both had carefully se- ?
leered and prepared their exhibits,
and now they stood with only a t
fraction of one point between them, s
The judge decided to do a little per- 1
sonal questioning. The hoy who I
stood a trifle the higher was well I
dressed, alert and confident in the t
support of a father and grandfather,
who hud not only donated the use t
of the acre of ground but had occa- ,

donally helped and always encouriged
the boy when his enthusiasm
ihowed signs of wilting under the
nflucnce of the long, hot summer
lays. 0
The other lad was poorly clothed
tnd had no relatives at the show to
itrengthen and encourage him and
ike'wise none at home. In fact the
toy had paid ten dollars rental for
lis land and had done every part of
he work himself.
When the first hoy heard of these
drcumstances he hesitated. There
vitliln Ills grasp, was the coveted
>rize?the free trip to the prize
vinners eoursh at Morgantown. He
lad scored the highest and the prize
vas legally his. Then he thought
if the discouragements which his riml
had overcome and in spite of
vhich lie liad so nearly won. Hi
hought of what the encouragement
ad the trip would mean to the poor
my anil lie hesitated no longer.
'Give the prize to the other hoy,"
in said." I would like to take tin
rip hut the other boy has earned

Then the county superintendent
rot busy. He stirred around among
he business men and the prosperus
farmers in the audience and in
few minutes announced that neitlir
hoy need be disappointed, that
tonoy was no.w available to send
otli hoys oil the much prized trip.
So tliis explains why Wetzel couny
will have two boys at the prize

ilotment of one to a county.

Currency Program in Operation.
WASHINGTON. Dec. II.?Without
fnrtnnl nntlnn flip. I)pmnf?rnts nf Mm
senate put Into operation the drastic
program tliey have adopted for the
consideration of the administration
currency bill. The Republicans, after
two hours of debate, prevented a
vote on a motion calling for continuous
sessions of the senate daily
front 10 o'clock in the morning until
11 o'clock at night with a two-hour y
dinner recess, hut the majority press- ]
ed "the bill forwar.d at every opportunity
and kept the senate in session
lust night. y
When Senator Kern presented a c
resolution which would have bound j
the senate to the proposition to sit 13 r
hours a day the Republicans ntaou u |
vigorous protest, declaring such ac- a
tion was unnecessary and would pre- t
vent intelligent consideration of the
bill. Senator Norris tried to obtain
an agreement for shorter daily ses- f
sions, witli an agreement to vote on i
I the bill by December 20, but tills was ti
{ defeated. The Kern resolution went |j
over. ' J
| The action of the Republicans foi- a
lowed a minority conference, which
decided to olTer formal protest against
the Democratic program, but agreed f
to make no concerted effort to pre- c
vent speedy consideration of the cur- t
rency bill. {

Pindell Again Nominated. 1
Henry M. Pindell, Peoria, ill., pub- t
Usher, was renominated today by.s

Russia. Mr. l'indell's nomination
failed in the extra session after it became
a center of attention because of |
publication of certain alleged eorre- <
spondcncc with Senator Lewis. 1
Brand Whitlock of Toledo was i
nominated for minister to Belgium '
and George Fred Williams of Boston,
was nominated for minister to Greeco

Opposes Hetcli Hetcliy Bill. 1
Declaring the rights to be conferred
by the pending lletch Hetcliy
bill were In direct conflict with the
water laws of California and failed
to protect the farmers of San Joaquin
valley, Senator Works opened the
fight In the senate today in opposition
to the measure which proposes
a new water supply for San Francis- I
eo. The senator read telegrnms from '
' ettlers to support his statement that
99 p*cr cent, of the irrlgatlonists were
opposed to the bill.
Senator Works declared that after
San Francisco had constructed a
plant to take 400.000,000 gallons of
water each day from the. lletch
Hetcliy basin, it would find the laws
of California would restrict tnv
amount to 161.000,000 gallons of
less.
' Do you know the penalty for perjury?"
nslied the cross-examining
lawyer sternly.
"Yes, sir," said the stubborn wltncsr.
"Well, sir, what Is the penalty for
oorjury?" thundered the lawyer.
"It's Retting elected to the assembly
and going on n lecture tour."
answered the witness.?buffalo Express.
