W had intended issuing the President's
message in an extra so as to supply our
city subscribers, and send it up country
by Tuesday morning's mails, but as it was
not telegraphed to S Paul did not get it
until late Monday night, then, as there
wrere no upward mails until Saturday the
•extra would not pay.
PORK.—Immenso quantities of prime
fresh pork are brought to town from the
country. I would bear eomparrison wi tli
that raised anywhere. The price ranges
from $2,75 to $3,50 per cwt. Some of our
merchants are bushy engaged in paeking.
"WOOD.—While this article, of the best
quality, is a drug in the market, at 81,50
per cord and while we have some fifty
subscribers on our books who have receiv-
their paper regularly and as regularly
promised to bring wood, "as soon as sled-
ding is good," we have not, to the best of
our knowledge, being able to obtain one
€ord this season, for which we have not
paid cash. This state of affairs cannot
last long—that is, if we can help'it. W
now say to these subscribers, once and for
the last time —Sledding is first rate, wood
is plenty, and if you do not pay in wood,
or something else, within four weeks from
this time, your names como off the books,
and if you can get another paper for three
years as cheap as you have this, you are
at liberty to do so. W certainly shall
not restrain you The only visopro we
make to the above is, that if the weather
ahould change so as to render the execu-
tion impossible os very difficult, we shall
•extend the time. But all old debts must
be paid up this winter, at least up to Vol. 4.
W do not intend this as a dun of course
not: but if these dehnquints do not "pay
up,"wc fear they will find, one day, that
there is a material capable of producing a
good deal hotter fire than wood. "Ven-
geance is mine &c."
W E A ER &C —I would be an effectu-
al silencer on old croakers to see ourfrom
"Winter" weather. Here it is, the 12th
of December, and the Mississippi river not
frozen hard enough to bear teams, and
scarcely foot passengers Indeed above
Upper town, the river is entirely open
But one day yet has the mercury been as
low as 20° below zero, and that only for an
hour or two in the morning. Most of the
time it has been coquetting among the
twenties above. Minnesotians grumble
at this kind ot treatment, and long for the
"happy days gone by," when we could
have steady, bracing weather. But appear
ances indicate that we may have the de-
sired change soon.
UB SLEIGHING—Has been excellent.
This and the glorious moonlight nights,
now in vogue, tempt all who can beg, bor-
row or steal a team, to turn out.
GOOD NEWS.—By a letter received from
Col. Miller's son, on a visit to his father
in Harrisburgh, we learn that the Col. is
recovering quite rapidly and expects to
join his Regiment by the 1st of January.
This news will sheer his many friends here
to whom his past condition has been a
cause of great solicitude, and be a matter
of congratulation to his regiment.
—Head Mr. 8trong's advertisement.—
Ha has an excellent stock of Farming
Tools and Agricultural implements, com
prising, reapers, mowers, fanning mills &c,
&e. This establishment will be a great
benefit to our Farmers, saving them, much
trouble, inconvenience and expense in
transporting those articles from St. Paul.
Give Mr. S. a call, and examine his stock.

MOFFAT'S LIFE PILLS
AND
Free fromJall mineral Poisons.
Thegreat popularity which MOFFAT'S LIFE
PILLS and PHCEKIX BITTERS have attained
in consequence of the extraordinary cures ef
fected by their use, renders it unnecessary for
the proprietor to enter into a particular analy
sis of their medical -virtues or iropertiiE.—
Havi&g been more than twenty years before
the public, and having the united testimor.y
of more than Three Millions of persons who
have been restored to the enjoyment of perfect
health by them, it is believed thai their repu
tation as the best vegetable medicine now be
fore the public, admits of no dispute. In al
most every city and village in the United
States, there are many who are ready to testify
to their efficacy in removing disease, and giv
ingto the whole system renewed vigor and
health.
In cases of Scrofula, Ulcers, Scurvy, or Entp.
lions of the skin, the. operation of the LIFE
MEDICINES is truly astonishing, often remov
ing, in a few days, every vestige of theseloath
some diseases, by their purifying effects on.the
blood. Bilious Fevers, Fever and Ague, Dgspep
sia, Dropsy, Piles, and in short,most all diseases,
soon yield to their curative properties. No
family should be without them, as by. their
timely use much suffering and expense may I
saved. Prepared by
