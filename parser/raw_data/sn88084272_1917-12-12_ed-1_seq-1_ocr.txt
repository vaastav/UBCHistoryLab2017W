A This city was subjected to a
terrific bombardment early
today as the result of a fire in the
shell loading plant of the Bethlehem
Steel company, about a mile below
Xew Castle.
The blaze which is of unknown
origin, started In a building in which
were stored 15,000 shells loaded with
trinitrotoluene, one of the most vio
lent of all explosives. The shells were,
ignited and the contents flew in every
direction. The building was destroyed.
uno man, a guard, was Killed.
Man' Head Itloirit Off.
The fire broke out about s oclick
this morning. At S.lo the fire was
i eported to be communicating to
every building. The flames caused the
explosion of loaded shells and they
v ere scattered everywhere. The roar
of the explosion resembled a bom
bardment of the town.
One report said chief Jacobs, of the
plant guard, was struck by a shell and
his head blown off.

The Xeu- Cattle plant of the Beth

roon after the outbreak of the war in
Europe. It was created to fill foreign
contracts for war munitions. It has
ben devoted almost exclusively to
loading shells. Its con miction cost
about $1,000,000 and it employed be

is estimated at $200,000.

LONDON, Eng., Dec. 12. The Timei
In editorial in unusually heavy
type, calls for a "prompt, search

"the reversal of fortune" on the
British front during the tremendous
struggle on the southern side of the
new Cambrai salient November 30
and the two following days.
"It was prehaps hardly possible
from day to day," the Times adds
"and certainly unwise to attempt an
authoritative account of the situation
a whole, though we cannot longer
be satisfied with the fatuous esti
mates, for example, of the Cerman
losses in men and morale which have
inspired too many of the published
messages."

"The published and censored ver

and blame, if any and where due,
should take shape in prompt disap

The Times forestall a possible
charge that in Its article it is in

by saying:
"There la no question whatever o

"An enemy misconception," he con

Great Britain, are aiming at the de

called the freedom of the seas. This
formula, if it possesses any relevance,
can only be used to indicate some new
limitation in war time upon bellig

suggested for land warfare where ex

with oen. Kaledines and other lead
ers of democratic oiganizations in
Russia, declared to the Associated
Press yesterday that the movement to
overthrow the BoUihenkl w.13 sup
ported not only by the Cossr.cks. but
by almost all the leaders of the other
parties. Thuse leaders, it was said,
are confident they will be able to
make short shift of the Boljheviki.
They also feel certain they will be
able to present a formidable fight
ing force by spring.
To Lead 400tKM Coxaaekn.
It Is said that thousands of Cos
sacks already have left the fighting
tront and rallied to Kaledines's sup
port, and it is expected he will soon
have the entire force of 400.000 Cos
sacks at his disposal.
The officials in London assert that
the plans embrace the solidification of
southern Russia, the reestablishment
of order, the reorganization of sup
plies and the establishment of a new
allied fighting front to protect the
rich Russian granaries and coal and
mineral fields from the Germans.
Anticipate Guerilla Warfare.
They add that a form of guerilla
warfare may possibly prerede the re
establishment of b solid fishting
front, owing to the present disorgan

the Bolsheviki peace negotioations.
American Troop Desired.
The question of allied support which
the officials declare Is necessary If
Kaledines and the other forces loyal
to Russia and the allies are to be suc

must be laid, especially the question
nf the eventful sending of an Ameri

with the forces holding the new front.
