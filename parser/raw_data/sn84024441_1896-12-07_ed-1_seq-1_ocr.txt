Ttie following message was transmitted
today liy the President of tlie United States
to both brandies of Congress. Its reading
occupied the greater portion of the busi
cess day in botn:
To the Congress or the United States:
As representatives or the people In the
legislative branch of their government, you
have assembled at a tune when the strength
and excellence or our Tree Institutions and
the ritncss of our citizens to enjoy popular
rule have been again made manifest.
A political contest involving momentous
consequences, fraught with feverish appre
hension, and creating aggressiveness so in
tense as to approach bitterness nnd passion,
has been waged throughout our land and
determined by the decree of free and Inde
iwnctetit surf rage, wltlout diurubancc of
our trnnijuillitv or the least sign of vv eakuess
in our national structure.
vw.cn we consider thi-c incidents and
contemplate II. e peaceful obedience and
luai.ty submission which have succeeded a
heated cirtSh or political opinion, we dis
cover abundant evidence or a determina
tion on the p irL of our countrymen to abide
b ev-.-rv verdict or the cpular will and
to Iks controlled at all times by nn abiding
faith In the agencies established for the
direction or the an airs or tlic-ir pjve-iiiuicnt.
Thus our people exhibit a patriotic dis
position which entitles iliem to demand of
those who undertake to make and execute
their laws such raithful and unselfish scr
1 ice 111 ilnir behairas can onlj lie prompt
ed by a serious appreciation of the trust
and confidence vvmch the acceptance of
public dutvlnvltci.
In obedience to n constitutional rc
qu rement. I herein submit tothe Congress
-, ream lrrormatxixi concerning national nr
fnirs. will) the suggestien of null legis
lation as in n. y judgment is necessary and
expedient To secure brevity and aold
tiresume narration, I shall omit many
details concerning matters witUn fediral
control, wlilch though by 1.0 rreans unim
portant, are n ore profitabl discussed In
departmental reports. I shall also fur
ther curtail this communication by omit
ting a minute recital of many minor inci
dents connected with cur foreign relations
which have heretofore found a place In
executive messages, but are now con
tained In a report of the Secre tary of State,
which Is herewith submittal.
At the outset of a reference to the more
important matters affecting our relations
Tilth rorelgn powers, it would nflord me
satisfaction ir 1 could
TtiKKKi.'. assure the Congress
that tlicdivturLeil con
dition In Asiatic Turkey had, during the
past year, assumed a Mess hide jus and
M'Midy aspect, nnd that either as a , onse
iniencc or the awakenings jf the Turkish
government to the demands of humane
civilization or as the result or decisive
action 011 the part of the great nations
having the right by treaty to .uterfere ror
the protection of those exposed to the
rage of m.iet bigotry nnd cruel fanaticism,
the shocking features of the situation had
been mitigated Instead, however, of wel
coming a scftened disposition or protec
tive Intervention, we have been effhtted
by continued and not uiifrcijuent tc ports
of the wanton destruction of homes and
the bloody butchery or men, women jiiel
children, made martyrs to their profession
or Christian faith.
While none of our citizens in Turkey
have thu r.r been killed or wounded,
though often In the midst of dreadful
scenes of danger, their safetv in the ru
tuiu is by ho means assured. Our govern
ment at home and our minister at Con
stantinople have left nothing undone to
protect our missionaries In Ottoman territory.-
who constitute nearly all the indi
viduals residing there who have a right to
claim 0111 prelection on the score of Ameri
can citizenship Our efforts in this direc
tion will not be relaxed; but the deep reel
ing and svinpathy that have teen aroused
nmong our people ought not to so fur blind
their reason and Judgment as to lead them
to demand impossible things. The out
breaks of blind fury which lead to murder
and pillage in Turkey occur suddenly nnd
without notice, and an attempt on our part
to force such a hostile presence there as
might tw effective for prevention or pro
tection would not only be resisted by the
Ottoman government, but would be re
garded as an Interruption of their plans by
the great nations who assert their exclu
sive right to intervene in their own time
und method for the security of life und
property In Turkey.
Several naval vessels arc stationed in
the Mediterranean as a measure of c.iu
tlon and to furnish all possible relief and
refuge tn cas; or emergency.
We have made claims against the Turk
ish government for the pillage and de
struction of missionary property at ilar
pootand Marash during uprisings at those
places. Thus rar the validity or these de
mands has not been admitted, though our
minister, prior to such outrages and in an
imitation of danger, demanded protection

A nuuiUeruf Armenian refugees havlngar

Our recentlvnppointed Consul to Erzcroum

reason his formal exequatur from the

lieve that the present soinlier prospect in
Turkey will be long permitted to oifend
the tight of Christendom. It so mars the
humane and enlightened civilization that
belongs to the-close of the nineteenth cen
tury that It seems hardly possible that the
earnest demand of gesiel people throughout

The Insuricxthm In Cuba still continues
with all Its perplexities it is difficult to
perceive that Buy progro-ss has thus far
liecn made towards
CJL.1JA. the pacification of
the island, or that
the situation of affairs as dtpicleel m my
last uunuul message aji In the least Im
proved. If Spain still Lc Ids Havana and
the seaports and all the considerable towns,
tie Insurgents still roam :.t will over at
least two-:hirdsottlieiuland country.
If the determination of Spain to put
down thelnsurrcclion seems but to strength
en with the lapse of tin. e, and Is evinced
by her unhesitating devotion of largely In
creased military and naval forces to the
task, there is much reason to believe that
the insurgents have gained In point of
numbers, and character, and resources, and
arc none the Ies determined In ther resolve
not to succumb, without practically se
curing thcgre-.it objects for which they took
up arms. If Spain las not set rt-estab-llsfccd
her authority, neither have the in
surgents jt made gcod their title lu be
regarded as an Independent state.
indeed, as Hie contest has kotie on the
pretense that civil government exists on
the Islam, except so far as Spain Is able
to maintain it has been pracelcally aban
UoiicJ. s,paiu does keep on Toot such a
government, more or less Imperfectly, in
the targe towns and the immediate suburbs,
itut, that exception being made, the entire
country is cither given over to anarchy or
is subject to the military occupation of
one or the other party. It Is re-ported,
indeed, on reliable aulnority, that at the
demand or the commander-in-chief of the
insurgent arm, the putative Cuban gov
ernment has now given up all attempt to
exercise lis functions, le-aviinr that rrov-
crnment contcs&cdly I what there is the
best reason lor sipposii,3li, al ways lo have
bceii.lnractugovcrument rnerelon paper.
Were the Spanishariiiicsnh'e tonicc-l their
antagonists 111 the open or in pitched battle,
prompt and decisive results might be looked
for, and the immense superiontv or the
Spanish forces in numbers, discipline and
eiiuipmeint could hardly fall to tell great Iv
to their advantage. Uut they are called
uikjii to race a foe that shuns general en
gagements, that can choose anil does choose
lis own ground: that rrom the nature of
the country is visible or invisible at pleas
ure, and Mint fights only from ambuscade
and when all the advantages or position
and numbers are on Its side. In a country
where all that Is Indispensable to lire In
the way or food, clothing and shelter is so
easily obtainable, especially by those born
and bred on thesoil.it is obvious that there
Is hardly a limit to the time; riiirinr- whirh
hostilities or this sort may be prolonged
ilcauwhile, as in all cases of protracted
civil stnrc, the passions of the combatants
grow more and more Inflamed and excesses
on both sides become inure frequent and
more deplorable.
They are also participated In by bands
or marauders, u 1 o, now In the- name of one
party and now In the name of the other,
as may best suit the occasion, harry the
country at will and plunder ItH wretched
inhabliantsfor their own advantage. Such
a condition of things would Inpvhably en
tall Immense de-struction of property,
even If it were the policy or Loth parties
to prevent It as far as practicable-. Hut
while such seemed to be the original policy
of the Spanish government, it has now ap
parently abandoned It, .-nd Is acting ui on
the same theory as the insurgents, namely
That the exigencies of the contest require
the wholesale annihilation of property, that
it may not piove of use and advantage to
the enemy.
It Is to the same end that. In pursuance
or general orders, Spanish garrisons are
now being withdrawn from plantations, ami
the rural population required to concen
trate itseir in the towns. The sure result
Wouid seem to be that the industrial
value of the island Is fast diminishing,
anil that unless thereis a speedy andradical
change In existing conditions it will soon
disappear altogether. That value consists
very largely, of course, in its capacity to
produce sugar a capacity already much
reduced by the Interruptions to tillage

THE TACTS IX THE CASE.
The opponents of the plan of recognizing
the gold Democrats insist that it was due
to the fight they made that Mr. Woodward
stepped down nnd out at the last moment.
The fact is, however, that iir. Wood
ward was all but handed the official letter
of appointment on Saturday, and only de
clined because he was afraid of the enemies
he would make it lie filled the position.
Ills partner, Mr. Lothrop, indicated this
course and this reason in an interview ex
clusively with The EveiilngTiir.es on Sat
urday last.
Mr. Hatina announced the appointment
at an early hour this morning, und bo'h
he and Col. Parker and Senator Procter
were much relieved by the settlement of
the matter. Mr. Uniina went to the C.ip-
Itol during the afternoon.
As already suited in The Times. Mr.
Woodward was taken to sec Mr. Ilanna by
Col. Parker on Saturday afternoon. Col.
Parker had made two attempts prcvlously
to find Mr. Woodward, but the latter was
non est inventus, as the sbcrirf reports
when he can't find a man. Finally 'he
missing wonld-bechalrman vvis located and
was speedily walked or waltzed by Col
Parker to the Arlington, where they waited
1111 Mr. Ilanna came back from the White
House.
WOODWAKD WAS DI3IXCLINED.
At the subsequent Interview Mr. Wood
ward stated that he was disinclined to
serve, and Messrs. Ilanna, rroctor anl
Tarkcr did all they could to persuade him,
so It Is stated.
lie was given until Monday to think
it over, and in the meantime Mr. Ilanna
Instructed Col. Parker to select a gold
Republican for the place In case it had
to b filled by another. Col. Parker nt
once concluded to nominate Mr. C. J. Bell,
who wo seen, and Indicated his-vvilllngness
to serve the citizens.
At 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon Mr.
Woodward called upon Col. Parker at the
latter's home and finally and absolutely
declined the chairmanship. Col. Tarker
at 9 o'clock Informed Mr. Bell.
This morning at ID o'clock Col. Parkor
and Mr. Uell went to the Arlington, and the"
latter was introduced to Mr. Ilanna for the
first time The national chairman asked
Mr. Bell if he would accept the chairman
ship, nnd the latter said he would. There
upon Mr. Ilnnna handed him the nbove
quoted letter of designation.
Mr. Bell and Col. Parker then departed,
Uie former promising Mr. Ilanna to call this
evening for further discussion of the in
auguration details.
GAVE $2,000.
Mr. Bell, before noon today, received a
letter from Mr, Woodward, as follows:
"lion. C. J. Bell,
"American Security nnd Trust Company.
Washington, n. C: ;
"My Dear Mr. Bell: I have this moment
heard of your appointment as chairman of
the inaugural committee. They could not
have made any better selection, and I ex
tend my hearty congratulations.
"Mr, Lothrop wishes to head the sub
scription witli ?1.000, and you may add
the san.e amount for, yours, vcrr sincerely,
"S.W. WOODWAKD."
Col. Tarter stated today that he had
done his deity In the first instance in nam
ing Mr. Woodward, and it gave him great
personal pleasure to designate Mr. Bell.
"The place having been refused by a gold
Democrat." bald he. "I" was told to
select a gold Republican. T at ence chose
Charlie Bclu I am very much relieved and
grattricd by the outcome.
"There Is no truth, absolutely none, in
Ike statement that Mr. Woodward was
forced out after he had accepted. He Indi
cated, way back In SeptVniber. that he did
not oa re to serve, bat I thought he would do
it nevertheless." r
Mr. Hell had already Iwgnn work when
seen by The Times rcporte-r. llehadatype
written list of. the committees to be ap
pointed, nnd had. In addition to Woodward
i Lolhrop's offer, received several sub
scriptions. Air. Hell Is thirty-eight jeurs old, and was
horn In Dublin, Ireland. He came here in
1S" and established the-banking houseof
Belli Co. In 1 803 he became president of
the American Security and Trust Company,
succeeding Col. -. T. Brittoti. He is a Re
publican, although not entitled to a vote. im
Is Identified as a director with many of the
great corporations of the city.
The local conmiilteeM will be slowly and
carefully appointed.
THE RIGHT TITIXG.
While there Is a general feeling that Mr.
Woodward has elono the proper thing, by
resigning, none f tl.e'Scintors care o-siie-cinlly
to say so for lublieatloo. When Sen
ator Proctor was askeel niwut it he said:
"When Mr. Woodward's name was first
mentioned in this connection he said he
could not accept the appointment. He was
at once besieged by peop'e who wanted tills
and that, nr.il this strengthened his de
termination. He found it would take at
least three months cjf his time, and fortius
reason was glad to give It up.
'Xootlierrcasouhcld vylt'i him. Hcwrote
to Mr. Parker some time ago, refusing
any such appclntment. Col. Parker lias
held the letter ever since, horing that
enough influence euuld tie brought to 1 ear
on him to secure a reversal of his decision.
Hut Mr. Woodward could not be moved,
so the other appointment followed."
At this pc int Senator Proctor was called
away, cud seemed pleased to escape any
further questioning.
MESSAGE DISPLEASED ALL
Friends and Opponents Alike Dis
appointed by Its Tone.
Seems All Talk nnd, Jfo Substance.
Senators; Had Looked for St rout;
State Paper uh'lIIh Last.
The President's mysage was a disap
pointment to Senators- Even his friends
they are not many could not help show
ing their feelings.
The fact that the message generalized so
much wasthcfirstsourceqfdlsapiiolntment.
It struck them as all talk and but few
recommendations- Of course. Lis p0UUc.1l
opponents could see butflittlc good in it.
Tbe nearest approach to'unanmlty on any
one subject was on that part relating to
the war in Cuba. Ills intimations that
the time might arrive when this country
would be obliged to take action even for
the sake of bumnrtjty, called for the ex
pression of approval.. Xoone seems to
think that Spain will overgraut autonomy
to Cuba, or that the Cuban's will ever
again trust Spain's promises.
Exception Istakcn bymany to the sugges
tion that is made that this country should
never take possession of Cuba. Senators
think that the time is coming, nnd is not
far distant when Cuba and HavveUl will
both be sheltered by the American flag.
That part of the message which smiles at
the belief held by-manyAmericans that
this country could easily conquer Spain, in
case of war, called out several indignant
protests. Several Senators thought the
tone of this part was ep'lrely too humble.
His threat to foreclose the Union Pacific
unless Congress takes somoaction between
this and the 1st of Janunry, meets with ap
proval lu many places. It is held that he
can do nothirg else than to follow the
law, and that law has been imperative for
some yearsnow. He wlllgelbutllttlecredit
on this line.
Republicans, in fact Democrats, laughed
at his panegyric on the Wilson lull. Every
one ki.ovvs that the revenues are not suffi
cient to meet expenses, and his effort to
make the country- believe otherwise was
held to be ludicrous. His suggestion to
use the surplus was met with the query:
"Well, why den't he use it? It Is under
his contiol. What's the use of telling
Congress nlout it? He can use it, and
use itnow, if he desires." f
The paragraphs devoted, to the denuncia
tion of trusts met with a rlmilar reception.
Republicans and Democrats Loth hold that
he has It in his power todrpl trusts a death
blow. It Is a waste of time to talk about
them to Congress.
Ills recommendation for the reUrcment
of greenbacks does not fall on fruitful
ground, lie suggests no way out of the
difficulties Into which'thc country might
be tbiown. There seems to be an earnest
desire to reform the finances, but the
chances .are thati rorornrwill not be along
the lines he suggest;
Something dlfrerent-was expected in the
last regular message, of President Cleve
land. It wa'1tIiougnt he would make a
strong contribution to state papers. That
is why friends and opponents were disap
pointed, i

That trouble never comes sinslehanded,
is nu old saving, trite and true.
Right on the heelsof Mr. S.W. Woodward's
declination to serve as chairman of the
inaugural committee, owing to the oppo'l
Uoii of leaeUag local Republicans, comes
n mysterious theft committed in his mag
iilliccnt home, on Wyoming av enue. Mount
Pleasant.
Mr. w oodwnrd's boudoir was entercel by
n burglarlast Friday night, and hesecure-d
about a thousand dollars' worth of Mrs.
Woodward's Jewelry and silverware.
The theft was not discovered until Sat
urday mornlng.and Mr. Woodward wasnot
apprised of it until about noon, when he
was with Mr. Ilanna at the Arlington.
Friday evening Mrs. Woodward spent
with some friends next door to the Wood
ward home on Wyoming avenue. Mount
Pleasant. Hostess and guests were path
ered on the side of the house opp.n-ttethat
on which is Mrs. Woodward's apartments
It Is supposed that the thief or thieves
enteri'd the house at about 8 o'clock Friday
eve-nlng, but there is no ixisitlve knowledge
on the iioiut or on any other.
The raiders left no trace behind them
except the atisence of the valuables which
were takn. No windows or doors were
broken, and tliere was no evidence of vio
lence to any portion of the house.
SWEPT THE DRESSER CLEAN.
The thief simply swept the dresser clean
of the jewels and silver toilet Instruments
on top and dispossessed the top bureau
drawer of all its treasure.
Every effort has been made to suppress
the news of the robbery, and until this
morning it had been kept a secret be
tween the Woodward family and the de
tectives. The family were instructed to keep In
closest secrecy the details of the job.
When a Times rcportercalled at the house
and asked to be shown the place where
the robbery had been committed the serv
ant who came to the door referred him to
Mrs. v oodward.
"Vounewsjiapermen are simply Lorrlble,"
smilingly saldMrs.WcoJwardomemoments
later. Learning that the substantial facts
were In the possession of The Times, she
consented to give the exact version of the
robbery, which is given above.
DETECTIVES ARE ACTIVE.
The larceny wasnot the work of a sneak
thief, cltlier amateur or professional, but
was committed. It is believed, by some one
well acquainted with the recesses and
ramlflcnUons or the Woodward mansion.
One of the pieces was a solitaire of great
value. The millionaire merchant Is greatly
worried over the loss of Uie gem, and Its
disappearance is said to be one reason why

ference on Saturday, the day tbe theft was
discovered.
. Mr. Woodward was anxious, owing to
the peculiar-circumstances surrounding the
nbsenceof the gem, that the matter should
not leak out, nnd the police certainly have
maintained the utmost secrecy concerning
It Is said that when the purloiner of the
ring Is discovered and the mist of mystery
cleared away some rather interesting de
velopments will follow.
The pawn shops and second-hand stores
are being closely watched and other steps
taken by the police, but when asked about
the larceny they are as mum as clams.

The House presented a bright and cheer
ful appearance this morning when the gal
leries were thrown open to visitors. The
old carpets had been replaced and the brass
furnishings ot the chamber had been scoure-d
until they were as bright as a gold dollar.
The galleries were crowded to overflow
ing long before Speaker Reed called the
House to order.
CONGRATULATIONS IN ORDER.
The members ot the House, like the occu
pants of the galleries, commenced to put
in an appearance as early as 10 o'clock,
although the hour of meeting was 12. Tho
Republicans from tho West nmlMiddle West
who secured a renoinlnation and were not
engulfed in the wave ot free silvertsm
which swept over those Commonwealths,
congratulated themselves and each other
upon their good fortune. It was an easy
matter for a stranger to sit In the gallery
nnd select the winners ot the Congressional
handicap of 1SSG.
The defeated members took their Ill
fortune philosophically. Some said that it
was the best thing that couhl have hap
pened to them; that it costs much more
than the salary to remain in Congress,
and. that they would-now return home
and endeavor to amass the competency
which it was not possible to secure In
public life. Others wcro looking forward
to places orprefcrment under the new ad
ministration which' will enable them to '

aucouneed their intention to spend tho
next year in foreign travel.
HE DEFEATED SIMPSON.
Chester Long, of Kansjs, wln looks more
like a prosperous New England merchant;
than a Western lawyer, who was morethan
usually conspicuous today by reason of tha
fact that he wa defeated in the election
last month by Jerry Simpson, the Populist
member from Medicine Lodge, whom Mr.
Long defeated two years ago.
The only Republican ineiubers ot the Kan
sas delegation who weathered the political
storm were LToelerickanil Curtis, the furmer
a prominent member of the Judiciary Com
mittee. "Hsre" Mercer, of Nebraska, the secre
tary of the Republican Congressional com
mittee, one of the two Nebraska members
who secim-d a re- IcsHIon, was the- recipient
of many cordial congratulations from his
Congressional friends. Someof the veteran
men; be-r.-.of the House, sue h asMcCreary, of
Kentucky, who declined a reromlnatlon;
Payne and Curtis, of New Vork; Richard
son and McMilhn, of Tenne-isc-c-. Walker,
of Massachusetts, and Giorvenor, of Ohij;
were also. much in evidence, and each, as
lie moved aLout the chamber, received a
small ovation from his friends.
Rlcbardsun was repqate-dly pointed out as
the roan who will be a promising candidate
for tbe Speakership when the Democrats
regain their control of the House and Gen.
(losv encr, of Ohio, was also an object to the
galleries who remembered him as the
"Rialliematician" last winter of the
McKir.ley boomers.
