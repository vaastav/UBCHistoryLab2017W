Chief Justice Kent was seen yester
day afternoon soon after the message
of the president was made public. He
was shown a copy of the clause rec
ommending joint statehood, and was
asked for his views. He replied, after
having read it, there was nothing to
be said. He said he had talked with
the president last summer about joint
statehood and had made known to him
the strong opposition to it in this ter
ritory, he president replied that ho
had not yet made up his mind on the
subject whether he would recom
mend jointure for Arizona and New
Mexico or whether he would recom
mend that there be no statehood leg
islation with regard to those territo
ries. Judge Kent urged upon him to
choose the latter alternative. ! The
president took the view that the mat
ter was not one which concerned the
territories alone, but one which affect
ed the nation at large, not for the
present only, but for all time. The
chief justice said that the president
left him with an impression that he
was inclined to Jointure and he ad
ded, "I know of nothing since which
would have likely changed his mind."
Judge Kent was therefore not surpris
ed by the recommendation of joint
statehood. As to the future, the chief Justice
said much would depend upon thefc

forth In my report to the secretary of
the interior. They have not since been
changed."
J. C. Adams, president of the anti
joint statehood league, when seen last
night and asked about the president's
message in regard to joining Arizona
and New Mexico,. said: "Notwithstand
ing the message of the president, I be
lieve the joint statehood bill will be
defeated. The cause of Arizona will
be more ably presented than ever be-
no bill at all would be prefernble. But ;

He had understood that .the coming
bill would provide an educational qual-
i ification by which some of the condi
i tions of jointure with New Mexico
would be ameliorated.
Regarding the latter part of the
statehood clause with reference to
gambling. Judge Kent said that he
did not think that that was a part
cf the recommendation with, respect to
admission. He believed' that It was a
recommendation for lglslation for the
territories pending statehood or in the
event of the failure of a statehood bill
to pass, urns recommendation su
ever had, the anti-joint statehood lea
gue has for months been industriously
gathering information"? which will un
doubtedly prove to every fair minded
member in either house of congress
that not only is Arizona opposed to be
ing joined with New Mexico, but that
i it would be a foul blow dealt to a pa
triotic and wealthy territory."
Mr. Adams continued: "Doubtless
thousands of people In Arizona were
amazed to read the recommendation
of Joining Arizona and New Mexico in
the president's message. They have for
years been led to believe that the pres-

"It is certainly a bitter disappoint

coterie of lawyers who are dissatis

Mr. Roosevelt may be in other parts
of the country it was certainly at a
very low ebb in Phoenix. The people
had heard so much of the president's
friendliness for the west that at first
they refused to believe that he could
have done this thing. There was no
where a disposition to lie down, but
on the contrary, to fight all the harder
through congress for the defeat of the
president's wishes, though his partici
pation in the fight makes it all the
more difficult.
It is understood that the bill which
the president will favor will leave the
people of this territory no voice what
ever in the matter; or rather that the
question is to be put before them in
such a way that they will vote for the
constitution rather than against it.
The bill it is said, is to be different
from the Hamilton bill in this. It will
first wipe out the boundaries between
the territories of New Mexico and Ari
zona, established in the early sixties,
thus creating the "territory of Arizo
na" and wiping New Mexico off the
map entirely. The next step will be
to admit the territory of Arizona to
statehood and when that is done the
question will come before the territory.
If the constitution should be rejected
Arizona and New Mexico would find
themselves joined together anyhow.
The plan is said to have been deter
mined upon by the representations
which have been made to Beveridge
and his associates that the sentiment
of Arizona is overwhelmingly against
jointure while that of New Mexico is
about equally divided. In that event
such a bill as the Hamilton bill would
be of no effect to say nothing of a
bill with the Foraker amendment.

The directors of the board of trade
held a meeting last night at which a
number of things were attended to but
the interest in all was overshadowed
by an unhappy interest in the recom

which was unanimously carried, recit

firmly protesting against admission

carried that a copy of this resolution

From Manitoba a lady writes Tier
reasons for the faith that is In her as
to miracles wrought in the present
day:
"I have been a great traveler in this
and lands beyond the sea," she says,
"and is is not surprising that my di
gestive apparatus, never very strong,
should have become thoroughly de
ranged from the effect of the starchy,
highly seasoned, greasy dishes usual
ly set before, wayfarers. .
"I became the prey of all the dis
tress and wrechedness that accompany
dyspepsia, even to the development at
times of an acute state of paralysis
of the lining of the stomach, when I
could eat nothing, but merely sip
warm milk till I was nearly starved
and looked like a half-live skeleton.
"My brain grew sluggish and In
somnia punished me till I became a
hysterical wreck. My only hope and
desire at this time was that I might
reach the , end of a painful life, and
that speedily.
"I heard of the pre-digested Grape
Nuts food, and some months ago,
without one grain of faith in it. bought
a box. I found to my surprise that
after one day's use of it I was already
benefitted, and by the time I had used
all of the first-package I became con
vinced that the days of miracles are
not yet over so great was the Im
provement that had came over me. It
was the opening of the door, as It
were, to goocT health and energy of
brain and body. It gave me new vig
or, mental and physical, my digestion
was restored, all the distressing symp
toms of a disordered stWmach passed
away, ."and: the nervous, hysterical wo
man at last began to know what it
really is to live. My eyes grew bright
er and my body rounded out with re
turning flesh. In the first three week
I gained ten pounds in weight and 100
in strength and energy .
"The indescribable relief that came
when I realized that I could discard
the nauseating - drugs with which I
had been so long dosing myself and
use in- their stead a food so delicious
and strengthening aa Grape-Nuts, may
be imagined.
