SPNISH ISFLUENZA
IS MORE DEADLY
jHAN WAR
The appalling rftvage of Spanish in-
fltiCMa in this, country . are perhaps
best realized by the-statement recent
ly made, tlint more deaths have result
ed in littlo more than a month from
this - disease than through out whole
eighteen months participation in the
'battles of the European v.ar.
Our greatest dM?cr miw, Klcclare
authorities, is the great Ai.ierican ten
dency to forget easily and to believe
the peril is over. Competent authori
ties claim the coming of cold weather
is very apt to ibring a rettrn of this
discaise and there should bo no let up
throughout the winter months of the
following easily observed precautions,
remembering that iwflucnan, is far as
ier to prevent than euro.
Influenza is a crowd disease. Avoid
crowds as much as possible. Influenza
germs spread when ignorant and Care
less persons sneeze or cough Without
using a handkerchief. Cover up each
cough or sneeze. Do not Spit on the
floor, sidewalk; In street cars or pub
lic places. Avoid the use f common
tirlnkiiitg cups and roller towels in
public places. Breathe some reliable
germicidal and antiseptic air to do-
stroy the germs that do find lodgement
in your nose and throat.
Remember, no safer precaution
against influehaa conld be employed in
this manner than to get frtm the near
est drag store a Complete Hyomei out
fit consisting of a bottle of the pare
oil of Hyomei and a little vest pocket
nard rubber inhaling device, into which
a few drops Of the oil ire poured. You
should carry this inhaler nKout with
you during the Jay and each half hour
or go put it in your moutl- and draw
deep breathj of its pure, healing germ
killing air into the pasxaijes of your
nose, throat and lungs;
By destroying germs befere they ac
tually !bogin work in your blood, you
may make yourself practically immune
to infection.
All these suggestions about Spanish
influenza are equally true in the pre
vention of colds, catarrh of nose and
throat, bronchitis and ven pneumonia.
Don 't become careless. Do your part.
-Keep the germs away; Yon may save
yourself a serious illness and the loss
of several weckg work. Danl J. Fry.
BACK TO REFORM SCHOOL
