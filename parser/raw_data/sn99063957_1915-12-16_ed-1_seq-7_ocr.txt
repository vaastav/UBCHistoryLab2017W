Daniel J. Fry, tho popular druggist,!
has been in tho drug business long
enough to have bis own opinion of thoj
best way of selling medicines. He snys!
the plan adopted by Mi-o-na, the great
dyspepsia remedy, is the fairest he has!
ever heard of. He doesn't believe that!
a medicine ought to be paid for milcsa
it does the user somo good. And Mi-o-na
is sold under a positive guarantee
to relieve dyspopsia or to refund the
money, You simply leave 150 cents on
doposit with Daniel J. Fry and if, after
you have used the box of Mi-o-na yon
decide that it has done you no good, all
3 ou have to do is to tell him so and ho
will return your money.
Hundreds of people have boen relieved,
of stomach agonies by using this re-1
mark able remedy. It is not simply a:
food digester; it is a medicine that puts
all of the digest ivo organs into normal
condition and gives ruddy, glowing, vig"-l
orom health. A ehango for the better;
will be seen after the first few. doses
of Mi-o-na, and its continued uso will!
eoon give the power to cat anything at
any time and not suffer distress after
ward. Mi-o-na is sold under t positive guar
antee to refund tho money if it does
not cure. This is tho strongest proof
that can be offered as to the merit of

Henry ClewsHopes Congress
Will Proceed
Xew York, Dec. II. After nine
months' of adjournment congress has
reopened, facing mauy new and serious
problems. As yet its temper has not
been fully manifested, and it is too
early to ilwide whether" it will prove a
conservative body or an excitable ono.
Should it show a disposition to con
servative action, as seems most prob
able, the present business' revival may
continue unchecked, while should it
display disturbing tendencies the re
verse would promptly happen.
Preparedness and revenue .are evi
dently to be the controlling issues.
Both of these are sequences of the war,
and nearly all other problems are large
ly connected with or affected by this
K.uropean crisis. President Wilson 'b
message met with general approval,
though not arousing any special en
thusiasm except when he touc'aed the
cause of patriotism. His discussion on
preparedness seems to have been lis
tened to with intense interest, and, the
problem which he thus ranked first
will undoubtedly be a subjevj of pro
longed and strenuous debate. Moder
ate preparedness at reasonable cost
would prolia.dv command the support
of sound public opinion, and there is
no occasion whatever for hysterical ap
peals to a sense of danger which at
tho worst is remote; while the degree
of prepnredness is best left to the judg
ment of experts, who are not influenc
ed by the thirst for notoriety or fat
contracts. Of courso preparedness
means increased public expenses, and
whether these will be met by bond is
sues or increased taxes is' not yet di
vulged. The pay-as-you-go method, or
taxes, is the wisest aud will act as a
wholesome restraint, rind the presi
dent's message contained some sug
gestions in the direction of economy in
public expenditures to partially offset
the new demands it would have mot
with public approval.
Tariff aud shipping arc-acheduled to
come in for Berioua attention, and there
are no chances of serious disturbance
in these problems. 'Intrinsically there
is really nothing in domestic political
affairs that need cause anxiety if the
peopc and its representatives oaly man
age to keen cool. Grave questions of
an international diameter are in Pro
cess of solution and at anv time others
may arise, so that calmness and justice
oecome tne rust auty or all who are in
legislative or government control. For
tunately I resident ilson is execution
ally strong in judicial qualities, ami as
tor his neutrality tllat has aready prov
ed strong enouali to involve him h
heated discussion from both sides; than
wincn no netter evidence can be toiim
of its rei'.lity. Our relations with all
the belligerents, continue to be of ti
most delicate nature; and it is to be
sincerely desired that congress will
neitlier embarrass rrcsident Wilson nor
Secretary Lansing in their diplomatic
course, which uas tlms Jar been con
spicuously .firm, patient, sound and
neutral. ' . .
(Ireat interest is now being mani
fested in our foreign trade. The no
lablo convention of prominent Ameri
can inunutactureis and merclinnts in
terested in export trade held in thin
city this week is to be followed by sim
ilar conventions in omer cities of tne
I'nitcd HtatCB. This is a most welcome
and necessary movement and should be
encouraged by all broad-minded and in
telligent business men. When this war
is over and conditions begin to settle
down once more to the normal, the
necessity of a foreign outlet tor our
surplus manufactures will become
more, and more imperative. Respecting
miners ior our raw materials we need
feel no concern, since there will be a
good foreign demand for all thata we
can spare. Hut for our munuOnctured
surplus the question will bo totally dif
ferent, and before, very long the
Pnited Ktutes with its tremendous in
dustrial deevlopiuent will feel tho ur
gency of expansion as never before.
In less it is satisfied, depression and
industrial disturbance will inevitably.
rouow. Happily tne toor of oiiportun
ity has been opened wider thaa ever
to American enterprise by tio unfor
tunate but temporary crippling of for
eign manufacturers. Our lending finan
ciers, merchants and .manufacturers are
already working upon intelligent nnd
fiusighted lines, the results of which
will be new fields of employment for
both American capital and American
labor, iiy all means let the good work
go on,
Our domestic steel industry con
tinues ou the rush. Many establish
ments have orders on hand that will
absorb their full outpoot until duly,
1HI0. Production in muny lines is sur
passing all records and a number of
large concerns have already announced
plans for enlargement of plant. Prices
continue advancing and promise to go
still higher, though it should be borne
ill mind, that this tudency will check
orders, tho railroads having, already
deferred many of their large purchase's
on this account, while numerous build
ing enterprises have been indefinitely
postponed because of tho increased cost
of building materials. A runaway mar
ket in steel products has seemed im
minent. .It is to be hoped that it will
be checked, inasmuch as it would be
injurious to many important industries,
not less than the steel tcado itself,
which might thus invite a severo re
action. Tho stock market continues more or
less unsettled by derangements grow
ing out of the war. Home conditions
remain exceedingly satisfactory anil
trade revival continues unchecked.
Western business is in excellent condi
tion because of a good harvest and
cheap money, while in most sections
huiiicsB is ba-k to normnl, being in
some instances oven better than nor
mal. The cnes of unusual activity are
confined chiefly to the Iron and steel
regions as well ns to cities where the
making of munitions has become of un
usual importance. The feverislniBss
arising from these causes Is spotty and
nui general, irane as a wnole In vol
ifme is not largely in excess of last
year. In values, however, the increase
is very unusual owing to rising pric
es and speculation which magnify or
distort our so-called prosperity. Kail
road traffic is heavy owing to' the rush
of grain and munitions, also to tho
Isrger shipments of westbound merch
andise. Higher freight rates, ample
traffic and reduced expenses combine
to mnkn tho present season one of ex
ceptional pront to railroads. How
permanent these factors will be remain
to be seen; and if our great transporta
Conservatively
tion lines are in future allowed to
make a living profit, it will be hotter
for all concerned. The public must
nave better tramc tacuitics tho expan
sion of which has been checked by un
reasonably repressive policies of the
goverumeut and iuterstutc commission.
It is a promising symptom that Presi
dent Wilson suggested a commission
for the purtiose of studying railroad
problems, the proper solution of which
is so vital lo Rational welfare.
While the agricultural, industrial.
mercantile and transportation outlooks
are each promising, the same is to be
said of the fiuancial outlook. Our
banking institutions are in exception
ally good position. The new reserve
"system works smoothly and has vastly
increased the supply of credit. . fco, too,
has tho tremendous influx of gold,
amounting to about $400,000,000 so far
this year. There has been an. amaz
ing expansion of credit, as is strikingly
shown by the loans of New York banks,
many of the larger institutions in New
York having shown an increase of
over .100 per cent in about a vear. One
concern alone has deposits of a year
ago, anu several otners aro carrying de
posits of over $10(1,000,0011, $200,000,
000 and $300 ,000,000. This growth of
deposits is, of course, largoly duo to
the expansion in loans which have in
turn been greatly augmented by oper
ations connected with tho Anglo-French
loan nnd other .important internation
al issues, not to mention the extensive
credits granted to several of the Eu
ropean boLiirerents. In spite of these
extraordinary operations, the money
market continues abundantly supplied
with funds at easy rates. Tho stimulus
of these conditions should not be over
looked. We are already in a period of
inflation and this has much to do with
tho nrevailing rise in values and the
activit" which that tendency inevitab
ly promotes, conservative bankers are
alive to tho dangers which the mone
tary situation invites.
January dividend payments 'promise,
to be larger -than usual as a result of
trade revival at homo and the effect
ot war profits. A year age the January
divideud aud interest payments re
corded amounted to about $240,000,000,
or $15,000,000 below the previous yonr.
This loss will)0 more than made good
