Little Rock, Aiik., November 30
L. S. Allard was shot in thq mouth
and d ngerously wounded, at Hot
Springs, last night, by hlp'son. Cad
Allard. Family troubles were the
cause. Both father and son formerly
published a paper In Illinois, and at
Hot Springs.
L. S. Allard and the editor of this
paper served in the Mexican war in
the sarao company I, 4th Indiana
infantry, Willis A. Gorman Colonel
and were attached as the warmest
of friends, although he was second
Lieutenant and tho writer hereof a
private soldier. We have not eeen
Allard since a eljort time after the
close of that war, thirty years ago,
and have heard of hi,m but two or
bree times since; but In those early
days of our lives we jtnetv hjm to be
a most honorable and generous man.
Tbo above dispatch therefore gives us
a shock of sorrow.
The Chicago Times a few days sgp
referred to womau suffrage in Wyom
ing territory as follows:
Woman suffrage is a failure in Wy
oming, because, having acquired the
right to exercise the elective franchise
and having at the first election or two
polled her ballot and fouud nothing
exhilarating in the process, she no
longer musters. Certain lewd women
of the baser sort take a band in the
glorious work of reform, but the wo
men whose votes woud bo desirable
if women are to vote, never go near
tho polls.
This sweeping assertion, does not ap
pear to be in accordance with the
facts. A gentleman citizens of- that
Territory In a letter to the Infer Ocean.
says :
The better class of females are large
ly represented at the polls here. They
are accompanied by mule friends or
relatiyes, end 1 have never seen elec
tions conducted In any other Western
city ae orderly as they are here. The
influence of good and pure women at
the polls has proven mnst salutary for
good, and thus far I have failed to see
any evidences of their degradation,
inconsequence of their havinc been
clothed with the elective franchise.
My own observation and the ex
pression of. opinion which I have
hoard on the subject, lead me to assert
tHat -oman suffrage is a complete
success.
And Gjen, Thayer, late Governor of
that Territory., in on of his Messages
said:
Woman suffrage has. now been in
practical operation in out; territory for
six years, and hsB. during' the time,
increased in popularity and a the
confidence of the people. In my
judgment, its results have been ben
eficial, and Its Influence In favorable to
the bet Interests of the community.
A right or privileze. once eranted, Ir
rjot easi'v surrendered. In this oaap
it is difficult to perceive any good
reason why St should be.
The Chicago Times Is not good au
thority on any subject.
The forty-fifth Congress assembled
last Monday, a.nd upon the fact being
communicated to U)p President, his
annual message was read by his pri
vate Secretary. The message aB a
whole, is very statesmanlike In
character, and will be general' deem
ed satisfactory. HIb referenoe to the
outrages committed In some of (he
southern states in the recent election
for members of Congress la a Btrong
indication that he at last realizes that
he is the victim of misplaced confi
dence. He says: "xx the 8'atea of
Louisiana and South Carolina at
large, and In some particular con
gressional districts outbide of those
states, the records of the election
seem to compel the conclusion that
the rights of the colored voters have
been overridden, and their participa
tion in tbo elections not permitted to
be either general or free."
The President then promises :
In the meanwhile itbecomes the duty
of the executive and judicial depart
ments of the government, each in its
province, to inquire intoaud punish
all violations of the laws of the
United StateB which have oc
curred. I cau but repeat what I said
in this connection in my last message,
that whatever authority rests with me
to this end I shall not hesitate to put
forth, and I am unwilling to ferego a
renewed appeal to the legislature, the
courts, the executive authorities and
the people of the states where these
wrongs have been perpetrated, to give
their assistance towards bringing to
justice these offendersand preventing
a repetition of the crimes. No means
within my power will be spared to
obtain a full and fair investigation of
the alleged crimes, and. to seoure the
conviction and just punishment of the
guilty.
Regarding the rights of citizenship
and the puritj' of elections, his re
marks are excellent. He says: It Is
the right of every citizen, possessing
the qualifications preecribed by law,
to oa-t one unintimidated ballot, and
to have his ballot honestly counted.
So long.as the exercise of this power
and the enjoyment of this right are
common and equal, practically as well
as formally, submission to results of
the suffrage will be accorded loyally
and clieerful'y, and all the depart
ments of the government will leel the
true vigor of the popular will thus ex
pressed. No tempornry or adminis
trative interests of the government,
however urgent or weight.?, will ever
displace the zeal of our people in the
defence of the primary rights of oltl
zenphip. They understand that the
protection of liberty requires the
maintennnoe iu full vigor of the man
ly methods of free speech, free press,
and free suffrage, and will sustain the
full authority of the government to
enforce the laws which are framed to
preserve these inestimable rights
The material progress and Influence
of tho states depend on the protec
tion offered to their citizens. There
can be no such protection, no pros
perity without peace, and tho whole
country is deeply interested In the
grow.th and prosperity ofall its parts.
While the country has not yet
reaohed a complete unity of feeling
and reciprocal confidence between
the communities so lately and so Beri
ously estranged, I feel an absolute
assurance that the tendencies are in
that direction, and with inoreainR
force. The power of public opinion
will override all political prejudioe,
all sectional or state attachments, in
demanding that all over our wide
territory the name and charaoter
"Citizen qf the United States" shall
mean one and the same thing and
carry with them unchallenged securi
ty and respect.
