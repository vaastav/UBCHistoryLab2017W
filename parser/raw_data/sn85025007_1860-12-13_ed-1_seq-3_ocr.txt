la Senate, Wednesday Deo. 12.
The Senate was called to order at noon,
and after prayer, and the reading of the jour
n&Mr. Bigler, of Pennsylvania introduced
an amendment to the Morrili la.'in. b!ll
which on his motion, was referred to tno
Committee on Finance.
Mr. Hunter, of Virginia, from t-.ie Com
mittee on Finance reported back the lrcasu
rv Note bill, passed by the House ol Rep
resentatives, with sundry amendments.
The first amendment, providing that t.io
lowest denomination oi' thy notes should be
fifty instead of one hundred dollars, was
agreed to.
* The second amendment provided that tho
recepts of the sales oi tho public lands should
be set aside to redeem these notes, anu tliat
they be limited in amount to ?3,000,000.
The amendment was advocated by Mr.
Hunter and Mr. Fessenden and opposed by
Messrs. Simmons,Collamer, Wade and oth
ers.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. Wade, of Ohio, introduced an amend
ment providing that nothing in the bill
should be construed to limit tho power <>
Congress to dispose of the laud as i*. should
deem proper.
Mr. Wude thought that unless tin* amend
ment was adopted, there might be a miscon
ception. He called upotUbe friends oi tne
Homestead policy and ol the Pacific Railroad
to sustain it.
Mr. Clinj;man was surprised that any
Senator should object to the United Mates
paying its debts with its own property, lor
the reason that he wished to give the piypei
ty away. He was like the man who a?. ine
end of his career, declared that he had lost
all, but that he had given away.
Mr. Hunter thought that it might be dim
cult to pass the Treasury notes with the
amendment. He fielievcd, that the enect or
the amendment would be injurious to tno
value of the notes.
Mr. Gwin opposed the amendment, an
said he saw no necessity lor it. ^
Mr. Wade defended his position, and call
ed for the yeas and nays.
The amendment was adopted b}' yeas
28, nays 27. . .
The question then reeurr.ing upon the
amendment, as amended.
Mr. Hunter thought that the clause had
beeu rendered nugatory, and could not vote
for it.
Mr. Gwin called for the yeas and nays.
Mr.-Trumbull said there was no necessi
ty for that; no one was in iavor ol the
clause.
The amendment as amended, was then
rejected.
'The hill was then ordered to be engrossed
and having been read the third time, was
passed.
Mr. Crittenden, or Ivy., introduced a pri
vate memorial, which, on his motion was
referred to the committoe on private land
claims.
Several other memorials were reterreu,
aud papers permitted to be withdrawn iiotn
the files. .
The Senate then took up the resolution oi
Mr. Powell, of Kv., providing for the ap
pointment of a Committee of thirteen to con
sider the President's Message.
Mr. Wigfall, of Texas, continued the dis
cussion of the question oi his personal con
sistency, as assailed by Mr. Douglas, yes
terday. lie quoted the record, and argued
at length to vindicate bis consistency.
During his speech, he gave \vav to a m<>
tion of Mr. Yulee, ol Ha., to roconsider the
vote by which the Treasury note bill was
passed ; which motion was entered on the
journal. . . ,.
Mr. Wigfall, having finished his vindica
tion, proceeded to oousidcr the resolution,
lie did not believe that Mr. Douglas, and a
friend of his from Missouri, could refer tlr.s
difficulty to two justices of the peaoe, and
settle it before sundown. This was a ques
tion which could be settled by the people
the States, only. Whipped syllabub whs not
the remedy for the patient, now. The Union
could not be saved by eulogies.? The South
demanded that she should be allowed peace.
He would tell the Senators i>:i the other si?.e
of the Chamber the condition upon which
he would consent to remain in the. Union
with them. They must abolish abolition
societies, stop abolition newspapers, and stop
the clamor now raging in their nuusr.?
j Laughter on the. Republican sioe.j lou
laugh in mv face. [Additional laughter.]
He called upon the Union-saving Senators
to look at the derision and contempt which
mot his proposition. He besought them to
look?"Jew est el ab hos.'e uoceri. ? mild
they still contiuue to by for the privilege of
paying taxes to sustain the manufactures,
build the roads, and clean out the harbors of
this*people, who would hold the I'lnon to
aether with hemp. The people ol the rsortn
would soon know the spirit of the South,
and it might be "where the battle wrec?r
was thickest," learn that "Cotton was
King.'' [Applause in the galleries.]
The President, pro tan, Mr. Foot, said
that if the disorder was repeated, he would
order the galleries to be cleared.
Mr. Hate thought that if ever there Wns
a time in which the galleries should be
cleared, it was now.
Mr Wigfall said that if the mdecent in
dignity was repeated, he would move n< t
only that the galleries be cleared, but tunt
the doors be locked, and the Senate be allow
ed to deliberate in peace.
Mr. W., continuing h^s argument, sa:d
he knew the game of the Northern represen
tatives. They knew that when the calami
ty incident upon disunion cacne ; when the
factories stopped, the ships rotted, and the
operatives aud sailors saw starvation staring
them in the face, their heads would not be
safe upon their shoulders, but they hoped
'ere the treasury was drained of its last dol
lar and while confusion reigned supreme to
make soldiers of these starving operatives.
The confederacy of our fathers had gradually
been changed. The bounds ot Massachu
setts had been extended until the whole peo
ple were included within them-and the en
fire Union governed by the Massachusetts
school of which the Senator from fcew lork
(Mr. Seward) bad protested himself a red
lower Tbis consolidation he would ever
onpose, but when be was called upon, as be
would be before many days, to vote upon the
government for a new confederation, he
would advocate the conscuuti^i oui la
thers had adopted tor all the States. Un
der this confederated government when the
border States came in. he cxpocted to as
sist to adjust the /<???/? relations with
the Northern States, lie (set;liir*d th';!
Mr. Douglas in his NorfoU >pe^ h h. t
promised to hang Mr. Lincoln, u he did not
administer the government accoruing to his
(Mr D.) views, and to gibbet the 'P
Virginia if, in the exe.cise of their rights
they dared to rebel against Mr. Urocojn. _
Mr. D.. always seemed to thin* everybody
entitled to manage tlu-ir own affairs, except
the neople of a sovereign state.
He trusted, he continued, that the South
would soon be able to dictate a trewty in
Fan en! Hall, the cradle of liberty, but the
o-rave of the constitution. Gentlemen > xou .d

John Brown Wide-awake f'retoriaus that the
Senator from Xew York had bidden to main

insure the fruits of their victory.
Mr. Seward said he would like to know
the grounds ou which the Senator made the
statement.
Mr. Wigfall ?aid lie had spen the speech
published in the newspapers.
Mr. Seward said the first mention of the
subject ho ever heard, was in a letter he re
ceived from the South. lie could not imag
ine out of what the misstatement had grown.
He was confident that he bad never recom
mended to the Wide Awakes to continue
their organization after the election.
Mr. Wigfall said that the Senator's de
nial was ail ho could ask. The fact that
the Wide Awakes still continued their or
ganization in menace to the South was un
doubted. He adverted to the decreasing
numbers of the conservative Senators and

Mr. Wigfali, at 4 o'clock, gave way to a
motion that the Senate go into Executive

The Senate, after some time spent in se
cret session, adjourned.
Houso of Representatives.
j After prayer and the reading of the JY.ur
nal,
| The Speaker, pursuant to the order uf
| yesterday, called the States for the subrais
j sion of propositions relative to the present
| cundition of tbecountry.
Nearly two dozen different propositions i
i were'presented, and referred to Special Union I
! Committee. Many of them proposed amend- ?
| men Li to the Constitution on the slavery j
j question, and ali looked to conciliation.
Mr. Thayer, of Mass., preseated a series
of resolutions proposing certain concessions
j for the peace of the country.
Mr. Adrian, of X. J., offered a series of j
! resolutions to the eil'eet that the doctrine of !
j non-intervention by Congress, either to pro
hibit or protect the domestic institution of
! slavery in the Territories of this Government
i should be adopted on the ba.?.is of compro
i miso between the North and South; thereby
j leaving tlie whole question of slavery in tho
I Territories to be determined by the people,
I and laws of climate. And further, that any
| territory should be admitted into the Union
?' with such ;i constitution a^ a majority of the
people might adopt, provided it be republi
can in form*, without any regard whether said
constitution permitted or prohibited the do- j
mestie institution of slavery. And airain, j
that all statutes enacted by any State Legis
lature, in conflict with or in violation of the
Constitution of the United States and the
lows of Congress made in pursuance thereof,
j should be repealed. And lastly; that the fu
gitive-slave law is constitutional, and the
i law of the land; and, as such, should be re
I sptctcd and observe.'!.
The plan uf Mr. Smith of Va , provided ibat
( the committee of thirly-three shall take into
consideration (lie policy of excluding from
the Federal Union each member thereof,
which by her legislation shall nullify un
act of Congress.
Mr. Leake, of Va.. proposed a c institu
tional provision, either that Congress should
have 110 power over slavery either in the j
State* or Territories, or that it should give j
protection to slavery: that Territorial Leg- j
islatures should protect slavery, and that no I
slave should be freed by passing in transitu j
thrcugh any of the Slates of the Confedc-!
racy.
Mr. .Jenkins, r.f Va.. proposed an amend* !
ment to the Constitution, and the more ol!i- j
cient execution of the Fugitive Slave Law. j
Mr. Noel, of Mo., submitted a proposition ]
for an amendment of the Constitution, abol- !
ishing the otliee of President, and creating i
in lien thereof an Executive Council of three, I
with power to veto any measure againpt sla
very.
Mr. Mai lory's resolution provided for the
establishment of the line of 30? iiOrT the
North to be free and the South, slave.
After a very large number of resolutions |
of similar character and purport had been!
presented, the call upon States was finished. !
Mr. Stallworth, of A la., asked to 'no excused j
from serving as a member of the committee j
on Military Affairs, say ing t hat he did not ex- \
pcct to remain long a member of the House, j
On motion his request was granted.
Some other business* of no general inter- j
est was transacted, and at 2} o'clock, tho j
House adjourned.
Tie Prince George's Conviction and Escape, j
At the last term of tho Circuit Court, a man
nnmed'David Hooper, was indicted for the
robbery of a watch. This case was removed
