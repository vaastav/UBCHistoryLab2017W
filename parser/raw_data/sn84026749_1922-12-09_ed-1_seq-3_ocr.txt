At Least One Year Will Elapse
Before Definite Action
la Taken.
By OEOROE R. HOLMES,
(tnesraattsaal New. Servtee.)
The sentence of death ha? bean
passed on the Railway Labor Board.
that It appeared certain today there
wUl be ft stay of execution tor at
'eaat a year.
Republican leaders of all shades
of opinion In Congress ?greed today
with President Harding that the
storm-tossed board, ?a at present
constituted, has outlived Its useful
ness. But ths method by which the
ex?cution will be carried out was ?
matter of considerable discussion and
divergent views.
A careful survey of the existing
?ttufttlon in Congress disclosed to
Administration leaders that there le
hut alight hope of carrying out be
tween now and March 4 more than a
amali part of the far-reaching recom
mendntiona made by President Hard
ing in his 'message.
Senate Jam Blocks Action.
The House, under pr?teurs, could
accomplish the major part of Presi
dent Hardlng'a program, but'it would
avail nothing because of the log
Jam In the Senate. Next week the
Senate becomes embroiled In the
fight over the Herding-Lasker ship
subsidy bin. The result Is In doubt,
with ? tew wavering votes holding
?the fate of the bill. But the fighting
It certain to be prolonged and bitter.
Senate leaders privately expressed
the opinion today tnat If the Senate
could be whipped into passing the
ship subsidy bill and the ten big
eupply bills In the ten working weeks'
that remain before March 4, they
would be well sattofled.
If the President's program la to
be carried out. therefore, it would
apparently necessitate an ex?-a ses
sion of the new Sixty-elghTn Con
great, with Ha reduced Republican
majorities. Immediately after the ex
piration of the .Sixty-seventh on
March 4.
Avete? to Extra Session.
President Harding Is not in favor
Of ?n extra session next summer.
He has expressed himself emphati
cally on this point, saying he believed
the country waa tired of Congress
and was deserving of ? good long
rest.
Nevertheless, th? President's mes
sage will be made the vehicle for a
aew drive for an extra session. Sena
tor Lafoilette of Wisconsin ?nd his
so-called "progressive" lieutenants
from the grain belt, will conduct the
drive. They will insist, they said
today, that the urgent need for ac
tion In the railroad and agricultural
"?situations necessitate an extra ses
sion, ?nd they will quote from the
President's message to back up their
argument.
Farm ? Id Possible.
It ?nay be possible. Administra
tion leaders said today, to carry out
in the neat tee weeks portions of ths
President's program dealing With
agricultural relief, through extension
of farm credit?, and also the consti
tutional amendment prohibiting
child tabor. The opposition to these
parte of his program Is insignificant.
No attempt, however, will prob
ably be mad? to open up the rail'
road situation. Senator Cummins of
Iowa, author of ths transportation
act, seid today he would introduce
no legislation In the present session
to abolish the Labor Board.
"We can't get any action on such
ateista tlrrri at this session, why in
troduce ItT" asked Cummins.
Ones th? railroad eltuatlon 1?
opened up la the senate, some lively
flgbtln? to certain. La Follette,
Brookhart. Norrto, Lsdd. Capper
and other Of the so-called Progres
sive group are merely biding their
( time ?nd waiUng Cor an opportunity
t? tear ths Esch Cummins bill to
?bred?. _

Josephine Lucchese Especially
Good in Difficult Role
of Violetta.
The brilliant singing ?nd artistic
ability of Josephine Lucchese, In the
difficult role of Violett?, made not
able an artistic and pleasing pres
entation of Verdi's La Traviata by
the San Carlo Grand Oner? Com
pany last night at Poll's Thester.
Her exquisite singing of the dif
ficult double air "Ah. fore e lui"
and "Sempre libera'' in the first sot,
the joy and despair of coloratura
sopranos, won her an ovation. Her
voice is exceedingly oleer ?nd car
ries true In the upper register, and
while not poeeessed of great volume
la sweet and well rounded In the
lower.
She was well supported by Romeo
Bosoaccl, as ths Impassioned Alfredo
and Mario Valle a? the tether,
'.lorgio Oermont. Her duets with
both these artists were delightful,
especially that touchlngly beautiful
picture of hope In the face of
despair, th? "Parigi O cara" of the
last act, and In the two duets, "Dits
all giovine" and "Imponete" with
the elder Oermont In the first
?cene of the second set.
Bosceccl waa In better voice than
on his first appearanoe Tuesday
night and roes to ?sverai truly great
moment?.
Valle was also in good form ?nd,
though he failed to,make the most
?f the ?penine part of hi? one
great air 1? the score, "Di provenas
li mar." h? overcame this Impres
sion by the beauty and fervor of
the close.
The last act was made a picture
of sustained beauty, though the ex
quirite delicacy of the muslo in ths
opening half of the act was marred
somewhat by an Impromptu cough
obbligato en the part of the large
audience. Lucchese and Boscacct
achieved their moat artistic work
of the week In this dlfftoult scene,
so often overdone by less skilled
singers.
The remainder of the cast was
well balanced and furnished good
support for the principals Frances
Morosinl appeared ?a Flora, Anita
Klinova aa Annlna. Mario Novelli
?? Gaston?) Francesco Curcl a?
Baron Douphol, and Natele Cervi aa

Aa In the other performances of
the week the work of the orchestra,
under Aldo Franohettl, was Worthy
of the highest commendation. While
th? overture was marred by th?
arrivai of late corner? the orchestra
won over the audience by fts fin
ished musicianship in ths ethereal
Intermesso which opens the hurt ?ct.

powering the Judiciary to determine
