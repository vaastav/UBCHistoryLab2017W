TUNNEL PROJECTED
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT WORK
AT THE HANNAH GROUP.
VALUABLE MINING CLAIMS
Operations Will Cost Large Sum—Tun
nel to Be 800 Feet Long—Ore
. Assays Well in Gold—Con
t rad Strike.
(Special to Inter Mountain.)
Anaconda, Dec. 7.—The owners of the
Hannah group of mining claims, located
West of Anaconda, are preparing to un
dertake some extensive development
work In the near future and before the
snows of this winter pass away will
have a force of men engaged in running
a tunnel 800 feet in length with which
they expect to tap the main ore bodies,
prospected and developed near the sur
face, and resulting, it is said, in the dis
closure of veins, vast In extent and con- )
tabling values very satisfactory to those
who are endeavoring to add one more
paying proposition to Montana's list of
mines.
Lon Burnett, who has a large interest
in the property, along with several other
Anaconda residents, asserts that on one
claim of the Hannah group, the develop
ments of the past few months have de
monstrated that there exists, within the
boundaries of that claim, a well defined
vein of the width of 60 feet, opened up
at a depth of 50 feet from the surface,
and which will average in excess of $6
per ton. Enough work has been per
formed to satisfy the directors that they
are in possession of a mine and not a
prospect, hence they are going to push
the tunnel to completion as
rapidly as possible, with the
expectation of thus establishing perma
nent workings. It is also planned tc
build a mill at. a convenient spot nea'
by, as soon as possible, after the tunnel
cut3 into the vein.
Another vein iMs feet in width has
been explored and some very high val
ues In gold taken therefrom.
For a long time thé district in the
vicinity of the Hannah mine has bee«
looked upon with favor. Some en
deavored to discourage those who had
put their faith in the region, but not
withstanding ail that had been said,
they have forged ahead, spent their
money freely, but judiciously, until at
last they are beginning to realize that 1
they have acted wisely in not showing
the white feather.
A few days ago an important discov- ;
ery was made in some adjoining claims !
owned by E ,L. Conrad and W. C. Smith
and known as the "Alpine group.'' \
They are sinking a shaft and at a depth
of 60 feet have opened up a 3-foot lead. |
A number of assays have been taken, I
