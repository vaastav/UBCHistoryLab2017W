AMERICAN SETTLERS WELCOME
AND DOING WELL.
The Portland Oregonlan, of Part
land, Oregon, published a cartoon on
the immigration of U. S. people to
Canada, in Its Issue of October S,
1999. The picture was accompanied
by the following article:
"Losing American Cltlxens. The ex
odus of American farmers to Canada
continue to be a phenomenon of the
first Importance. More of them are
crossing the border this fall than
ever before, and they are flocking
from all parts of the country. Former
ly It was the Middle West alone which
thus lost the heart of its citizenship.
Now all sections of the Union suffer
alike. The regret which we cannot
help feeling over the migration of
many thousands of excellent cltlxens
has an economic side which causes
some concern. The 70.000 farmers
who will go to Canada to lira this fall
will take with them some $70,000,000
In cash and effects. This Is by no
means a negligible sum, and makes a
Tory sppreciable drain on our re
sources. But, of course, the most se
rious loss is the men themselves and
their families, who hsve forsaken the
land of the free and the home of the
brave to dwell under the rule of a
monarch.
Why do they go? Naturally the
cheap and fertile land of Western Can
ada attracts them. Each emigrant
goes with a reasonable expectation of
bettering his fortune. Indeed, In a
few years he may grow rich through
the abundant crops he can raise and
the increase of land values. But per
haps that is not the sole reason for
the astonishing migration. There Is
a common notion abroad that in Can
ada life and property are appreciably
safer than they are here. Murders
are not so frequent, and are more
speedily and surely punished. Mobs
snd the so-called 'unwritten law' are
virtually unknown in Canada. Again
the law Is a vastly more ascertainable
entity there. Canada does not per
mit its Judges to veto acts of the leg
islative body. When a statute has
been enacted it Is known to be the
law of the land until it Is repealed,
this naturally Imparts to Canadian
civilization a security and stability
which we have not yet attained.
"We must remember, in the same
connection, that the Canadian protec
tive tariff Is far less exorbitant than
ours, and much less boldly arranged
for the benefit of special favorites.
Hence there Is an impression, very
widely diffused, that the Canadians
are not so wickedly robbed by the
trusts as we are in this country. Rea
sons like these sufficiently account for
the exodus of a body of citizens, whom
we can ill afford to lose, but they do
not much assuage our regret that they
cannot be retained in the United
States."
Speaking of this, a Canadian Gov
ernment representative says that the
Americans who cross the border are
most welcome. The splendid areas
of virgin soil, a large quantity of which
is given away as free homesteads, lie
close to existing railways and to those
under construction. The railway lines
that are assisting in this development
are the Canadian Pacific, the Cana
dian Northern and the Grand Trunk
Pacific The latter is built entirely on
Canadian soil, and has opened up a
wonderful stretch of land. Along this
line during the year about closed thou
sands of American settlers have made
their homes. They have built the
towns, and immediately began as fac
tors In the building up of the great
Canadian West.
Agents of the Government are lo
cated In various cities throughout the
United States who will be pleased to
give any information that may be de
sired to further the interest of the
settler.
A Risky Thing.
"I think I'll go home."
"But It's only 11 o'clock, old man.1
"Well, there's nothing doing at the
club."
"I know; but consider. Once I
went home at 11 o'clock and earn
near establishing a dangerous prece
dent"

were his ears tied together with a fine silken thread? Perhaps you are about to buy a !
horse because you like his " ginger " ? Are you sure it is health and high spirits, or IS
