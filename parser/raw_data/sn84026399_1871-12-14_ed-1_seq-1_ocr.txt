THE PflSIDENTS MESSAGE.
To war-worn Ablitionists, accustomed
to find in each President's Message them
selves berated, their motives aspersed,
and their devotion to Impartial Liberty
sti-matized as impelled by sectional hate
and in essence little better than treason,
it must be refreshing to read (his Mes
sage, wherein aversion to Slavery at home
and abroad, with recommendations that
cur citizens be forbiden to hold slaves in
countries where human bondage is still
legal, congratulations on the initiation of
enfranchisement in lirazil, hopes that the
process may be hastened, complaints that
Spain's semblance of emancipation in Cu
ba and Porto llico is a mockery, &. &c ,
are so promineut. The fact that the Pre
sident who thus nobly embodies and enun
ciates the better impulses of our people
was himself a partisan of Slavery down to
the outbreak of our great Civil War, so
far from weakening the force of his de
monstrations against the discarded
scourge and shame of our country, but in
ten?ifics and emphasizes that testimony.
Just compare this Message iu its relations
to Shivery with one cf Uuchanau's uttered
barely twelve years ago, and the immense
benefieicnt strides made by our Republic
within that period will be manifest. Let
none doubt that the melioration is perm
anent, and far more likely to be increased
than diminished.
Our Foreign Relations appear to be
satisfactory in the main, and the Presi
dent is right in regarding and represent
ing our late Treaty with Great Britain,
whereby our grave differences with that
power are submitted to friendly arbitra
lion, as a striking evidence of progress iu
true civilization. Grant that the Treaty
in question is less favorable to us ou some
points than might fairly have been ex
pcit:d that we should have insisted on
a total abolition of war on private proper
ty (other than contraband) afloat still
we hold that Treaty a theme of just felic
itation, honorable to both jarties, and
auspicious to the future peace of Chris
tendom. We believe Gen Grant's felici- j
tations thereupon will be fully responded
to by a great majority of his countrymen.
We judge that our relations with Spain
are more critical than the President's
guarded language would indicate ; other
wise, we should strenuously object to his
indorsement of Secretary Robeoson's sug
gestion as to the necessity for increasing
and improving the material "of the Na
vy." Wc protest against any such in
crease. If we need more vessels and more
men for any present emergcuey, let us
hire them, and pny the bill; but there is
no need of a permaneot increase. Oa
the contrary, we suggest that half the
National vessels now rotting idly, iu our
ports be sold to the highest bidder, and
no longer watched and guarded at a use
less cost while they grow daily more and
more unseaworthy and unserviceable If
we ever want more war-vessels, these will
be found good for nothing but breaking
up and eold as old iron. Let us break
them up at once, now that iron is in de
mand at good prices, and not eat their
heads off twice more. If we need more
guns in the West Indies, call home our
ueless parade fleet from the Mediterra
nean. Secretary Itobeson is a jolly good
fellow, and we wish him all matrimonial
and other felicity ; but his "suggestion"
implies more officers and more expense,
whether he knows it or not, and that the
country will not stand. Avast, there,
skipper! for you are rushing on sunken
rocks which your chart seems to take do
note of!
The President's recommendations that
the Internal Texas be swept away, those
known as Stamps and those levied on Li
quors and Tobacco, will meet with gen
eral approval. 31 ay wc not hope that
Congret-s will act promptly and decidedly
uu this recommendation 1
As to tariff revision, the President re
fleets very nearly the average sentiment
of the People. Rut we guess his true
friends in Congress will make haste slow
ly in reducing the revenue from this
source. The fact that the Debt has done
more than anything else to make the Ad
ministration and the party supporting it
strong and popular. So many Millions
paid off each month arc to Gen. Grant's
Administration what Uniou victories on
hard fought fields were to Mr Lincoln's.
No financial difficulties beset a rule which
is thus amply supplied with revenue and
using it for such a purpose. The fact
stated by the President that the annual
burden of the Debt is now Seventeen
Million less than it was wheu he was in
augurated is a perlcct Vicksburg to his
supporters. Now, you cannot both eat
your cake and save it ; and, if tax repeal
is to be the order of the day, we shall soon
have reached the end of debt reduction.
And when we have btopped reducing the
Debt, it will weigh upon us much more
heavily than it now does, while reducing
outgoes, by contracting uew loans at a
lower rate of interest wherewith to p:ty
off old ones, will be found impracticable.
We respectfully suggest, therefore that
swecpiug away Fifty Millions per annum
of internal reveuue may well suffice for
one session. Wheu Tariff reduction shall
be in order, the Prcsideu't plan may in
the main be safely followed.
With regard to the Ku Klux outrages
in certain localities at the South, the Pre
sident's representations are sound, mod
erate, and will be heartily approved by a
large majority of his countrymen. Those
outrages must be suppressed ; peaceable
citizens, however powerless and despised,
must be protected in, their humble homes.
STROUUSBURG, MONROE COUNTY, PA., DECEMBER

and, if the States cannot or will not do
this, the Union must and will. We
heartily regret that National interposition
is necessary ; but it is, we rejoice that it
has been decreed, and bids fair to prove
effectual. The denunications of "martial
law" in Opposition journals and speeches
are based on untruth. There has been
no proclamation of martial law ; nothing
more than a vigorous assertion of the su
premacy of statue law to conspiracy, viol
ence, and murder. If any have abscond
ed from their homes because of the Pre
sident's Proclamations, their guilty con
science were their accusers. We wish
the President had seen fit, moreover, to
indicate his adhorence of the carpet-bag
villainies whereby several Southern States
have been impoverished and their credit
broken down villainies which partially
explain . but in no manner excuse the
crimes of the Ku Klux prowlers; but he
is right as to these miscreants, and, bo
far, the country is with him. , .
Another suggestion that will strike the
people as both proper and just, is the one
that the Government take possession of
the telegraphic wires and manage them
as it does the Post office. This plan has
been tried in England with great suc
cess. We will have cheaper communica
tion between the people, and one of the
shackles on the press will be removed.
We can never have an entirely free so
long as it has to submit to the exactions
of a set of private speculators, bent more
on enriching themselves than on accom
modating the public.
The Presideut meets every question
presented to the minds of the American
people in afair and candid manner. His
recommendations are in nearly all re
spects wise and progressive and the coun
try will see in them that we have a Pre
si lent who is no less wise in peace than he
was illustrious in war.
The True Theory About Fresh Air.
The following facts on "open windows
at night"is from Hail's Journal of Health :
"Very much has been written on this
subject, and written unwisely ; the facts
are that whoever sleeps uncomfortably
cool will get sick. To hoist the window
sky high when the mercury is at zero is
an absurdity. The colder a sleeping ap
partments is the more unhealthy does it be
come, because cold condenses the carbonic
acid formed by the breathing of the
sleeper. It settles near the floor, and is
re breathed, and if in a very condensed
form he will die before morning. Hence
we must be governed by circumstances :
the first thiugisyou must be comfortably
warm during sleep, otherwise you are not
refreshed, and inflammation of the lungs
may be engendered, and life destroyed
within a very few days. An open dcor
and an open fire place are sufficient for
ordinary purposes in cold weather.
When other windows are opened, it is
to have them down at the top two or three
inches, and up at the bottom for the same
space, in miasmic localities ; and these are
along the water course, besides mill ponds,
marshes, bivouacs' river bottoms, flat
islands, and the like. It is the most im
portant from the first of August until
several severe frosts have been noticed,
to keep all external doors and windows
closed, because the cool air of sunset
causes the condensation of the poisonous
emanations which were caused by the
heat of the noonday sun to rise far above
the earth. This condensation makes the
air "heavy" by the great solidification of
the emanations by cold ; these resting on
the surface of the earth in the more
concentrated and malignant form, they
are breathed in the lung and swallowed
into the tstomach, corrupting and poison
ing the blood with great rapidity. Hy
daylight these condensations arc made so
compact by the protacted coolness of the
night they are too near the surface of the
earth to be breathed into the system ; but
as the sun begins to asend these heavy
condemnations begiu to rise to the height
of several feet above the ground, and are
freely taken into the system by every
breath and swallow ; hence, the hours of
sunrise and sunset are the most unhealthy
hours of the twenty-four in the localities
named ; and noon tide, when the sun is
the hottest, is the most .healthy portion
of the d;y, because the miasmic so much
ratified that it ascends rapidly to the up
per regions. The general lessons are :
First avoid exposure to the outdoor air
iu miasmatic localities for the hours includ
ing suurise and sunset. Second, having
a blazing fire on the hearth of the family
n
room at these hours to rarify and send
the miasma upward. Third, take break
fast before going out of doors in the morn
ing, and take tea before sundown , then
being out at night is not so injurious.
The question whether or not Goldsmith
Maid had beaten the public time of
Dexter in the great trot against Jjucy, on
the Cold Si-ring track, at Milwaukee, on
the 0th of September last, or whether
the time she then made was a valid record,
Ins been passed upon by Wilkes' Spirll
of the Times, which says, after review
inir all the statements iu regard to the
performance, that those "who bet that
Goldsmith Maid beat Dexter'a public
time, have won ; and gentlemen who
sought the judgment of the Spirit, and
who have received money on a converse
decision, should hand it back. Final
iudginent has siranly been retarded, and
they bow have that judgment upon what
may be considered a decree of the full
bench.."

Cure for the SmaU-Pox
A eoarespondeut says he cured himself
of a severe case ol small pox by the fol
lowing remedy, and begs to wake it
known that other sufferers may find speedy
relief. It was simply by taking a sweat
of cream of tarter one tablcspoonful of
cream of tarter, one tablcspoonful of browu
sugar, put ioto a large sized bowl ; boil
ing water poured over it, filliag ap the
bowl ; then left it be well stirred, and the
patient drink it all, as hot as it can t-c
taken (being, of course, in bed and well
covered up).- This- sweat univearally
sends the disease to the surface, prevent
ing afterwards sickness or death, or of
being marked, which is greately dreaded
by some, especially the ladies.

Russian Bristles.
The sources of the vast majority of the
bristles of eoromerco are the interminable
forests of Northern! Russia. Here, for
thousands of miles in extent, the land is
covered with wood pine trees, larches,
oaks, beeches, rowans, and other cone,
mast, acorn and berry-bearing trees, the
fruits of which form a delicious diet for
swine, which in a sort of half wild state,
and more or less under the surveillance
of swineherds, swarm in prodigious num
bers. It need not be supposed that all
these swarms surrender their bristles to
the bristlemerchant. The pigs under
culture for the bristle crop arc mostly a
priviledged race, that pasture near the
great tallow factories of Russia, where
the animals, reared too far from the
habitations of men to be consumed for
human food, arc boiled down for the sake
of their fat. The swine are fed on the
refuse of the tallow houses at certain
seasons, and become in prime condition
after a few months' feeding. The bristle
harvest is reaped, or rather is uprooted,
in the summer, by a process which re
minds one of the quill plucking of the
Lincolnshire gcesc, but which is really
not so cruel as it appears at first view.
When the animals arc well fattened,
after months of unlimited feasting, and
their bristles are iu the finest order, they
have to compensate their hosts for their
entertainment They arc then driven in
multitudes into a kind of kraal, or fenced
enclosure, where they are crowded as
thickly together as they can stand, and
perhaps rather more so. Here, bydint
of kicking, striving, struggling, and
scrambling together, they are sure to get
considerably heated, in which feverish
condition they are seized by the pluckers,
who have then but little difficulty in pul
ling up the pristles by the roots. This is
no sooner accomplished than piggy is
allowed to regain his liberty, and scam
pers off again to his pasture. The spec
tacle is not a very delightful one, as may
be imagined, nor is the extemporaneous
concert, improvised on the occasion, very
agreeable to the ear. That the bristle
harvest is really reaped in this way, any
one may satisfy himself by inspecting a
consignment of undressed bristles, before
they have been passed through any ctcaus
ing or purifying process. He will see
that the stiff hairs have been forcibly
dragged up by the roots, and he will see
further, in the case of Siberian bristles,
that together with the roots of the stiff
hair there has been torn away no in
considerable portion of the softer wool,
which by a kind of provison of Nature
underlies the bristles in the severe North.
Shooting Flames.
An explanation is offered of the "shoot
ing flames" and "balls of fire," supposed
by some to be disconnected with ordinary
ignition, that may deserve consideration.
When trees or other green woods arc
burning, gases are distilled, or evolved,
through the action of the heat. Most of
the gas is likely to be carburetted
hydrogen, such as is used in streets and
houses. This is thrown up until it meets
the oxygen of the atmosphere, when it is
consumed in the shape of flame. In an
ordinary fire, the air has free access to
the gas as fast as made, and the gas is
consumed at once, without rising. IJut
when acres of trees or houses arc burning,
the air cannot always get into the centre
of the mass. In other words, the oxygen
of the air is consumed about the edges of
the conflagration, or before it has pene
trated far into the interior. Hence quali
ties of carburetted hydrogen escape un
consumed but heated to a very high
temperature, and, being wafted by the
wind? ahead of the fire, may be rods in
advance of its bulk, when finally touched
off stray spits of flame or flying fragments
The result is a flash much like that of
funpowder. Frequently during a con
flagration, most frequently in a great one,
Games arc seen flashing high in the air,
to appearance quite disconnected with
the flames below. This is said to be
simply the sudden iguition of a mass of
inflammable gas, as it reaches a more
abundant supply of oxygen.
Plain Talk to Girls.
Your every day toilet is a part of your
character. A girl who looks like a "fury"
or a "sloven" in the morning is not to be
trusted, however finely she may look in
the evening. No matter how humble
your room may bo, there are eight things
it should contain, namely ; a tuiiror, wash
stand, soap, towel, comb, hair, nail, and
tooth brushes. These are just as essen
til as your breakfast, before which you
should make good use of them. Parents
T
who fail to loiviJo their children with
such appliauecs, uot only make a great
mistake, but commit a siu of omission
Look tidy in the morning, and, after the
dinner work is over, improve your toilet
Make it a rule of your daily lilo to "dress
up" iu the afternoon. Your dress may
or need not be anything better than cali
co ; hut with a ribbon or flower, or some
bit of ornament, you can have an air oi
self respect and satisfaction that invari
ably comes with being well dressed. A
girl with fine sensibilities caunot hcip
feeling embarrassed aud awkward in a
ragged ami dirty dress, with her hair uu
kempt, should a neighbor or stranger
come in. Moreover, your self-respect
should demand the decent nppareliing of
your body. You should make it a point
to look as well as yon can, even it you
know n-vbody will see you but yourself.

Spiced Beef.
Take a piece of beef from the forcrjuir
ter, weighing teu pounds. Those who
like fat should select a fatty piece ; thoso
who prefer lean may take the shoulder
clod, or upper part o'f the fore log. Take
one pint of salt, one teacup of molasses
or brown sugar, cue tablcspoonful of
ground cloves, allspice and popper, and
two tablcspoonful ot pulverize. 1 saltpetre.
Place the beef in a deep pan, and rub
wuh the mixture Turn and rub each
side twice a day for a week. Then wash
off the spices; put in a pot of boiling wa
ter, aud, as often as it boils hard, turn in
a tea cupful of cold water. It must sim
mer for five hours, on the back part of
the stove. When cold, press under heavy
weight, and you will never desire to buy
corned beef of the butcher again. Your
pickle will do for another ten pounds of
beef, first rubbing into it a handful of
salt. It can be renewed and a piece kept;

Infinite are the works which Societies
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
find to do. The Boston Association is at
present devoting itself to the extirpation
of the glanders, a disease dangersous alike
to the horse and the man who handle
him. Death by glanders iu the human'

horses the disease is engendered by
badly ventibited stobles A specific poi

danger arc euhauccl by poor fool and

inferred from the fact tint duri.v th-i

Slandered horses. One rinn has lately
died of the lisea.se there, aud in a single
stable as many as eight horses. The
