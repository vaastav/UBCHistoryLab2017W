HI You know that I have been with you
HS seven years. In entering your service ,
j' I my mother gave me her blessing , and
H , I commuted me to the care of heaven
Hf 1 and yourself. I was seven years o
B' Ege the day I first sailed * with you , and
Hfi I am fourteen now. Have I ever given
Hj1 i you any cause for complaint , sir ? "

Hk "I will tell you , and then you may

Hf I my mother said to me : "Frank , you are
HJ I now going to sea. Most of your trips
Hf I "will be made from New York to New

"Captain , something .is wrong , for
she never removes the light until I set
foot in the cottage , after it has once
"been " placed in the window. "
"Are you sure that you are In sight
of the cottage ? "
"Yes ; for I can see it , although in
I distinctly , in the moon's rays. "
"Well , we will land you , , and you
can soon learn what is the matter. "
It required but a few moments to
set Frank Ludlow upon shore , and
with a heavy heart , he bent his steps
toward the home of his youth.
Frank had reached a little grove
HB which adjoined his youthful home ; but
BB here he paused and stood for some
KB time in silence. Tears started into his
BB eyes , and he repeated the name of his
BB mother in a low tone. Then , as if
| B afraid to go forward and satisfy him-
B self , he called in a louder voice , and
B still louder , but only an echo came
B back to greet his ears.
B A faintness came over the lad , and
he sank back upon the ground. But
I he started to his feet again as if he
had been stung by a serpent. He had
m seated himself upon freshly turned
B earth , and its dampness chilled him.
B He turned to look upon the spot , but
B the tears blinded his vision. He brush-
B ed them away , however , and then
B gazed upon the earth where he had
B sunk.
B -A fresh mound met his gaze. It was
H a new-made grave ; and , with a cry of
B agony , the boy fell upon it. He call-
H | ed upon his mother to come hack , on-
B ly for a moment , to bid him farewell.
m But silence , deathly silence , was

around him. Presently a hand touch
ed him , and he started to his feet. Ho
recognized one of his neighbors , and
he asked :
"Loring , whoso grave is this ? " ,
"You were calling her name just
now. " '
• "My mother ? "
"Yea , Frank. "
"Oh , tell me all about it , Loring. "
"Come into the cottage first. "
The boy obeyed. As he entered the
humble house where he had seen so
"
many happy days , it appeared to him
that he could hear his mother's voice
calling upon his name. He fancied
that he could hear her footsteps cross
ing the apartment to meet him. But
she was not there. He entered the
room where the signal had usually
been placed , and gazed earnestly
around. Everything appeared to be
just as he had last seen it , and he could
not bring himself to believe that his
mother , who had embraced him at
parting only three months before , was
now sleeping in the cold grave.
He glanced toward the window. The
lamp was there , in its accustomed
place , but it was not burning. The
boy approached and gazed upon it.
The wick was blackened and crisped ,
showing that it had been lighted ; but
the oil was entirely exhausted , showing
how it had become extinguished. Si
lently the devoted son regarded this
evidence of a mother's remembrance
and love , and then , turning to the
neighbor , he asked : "Loring , how long
has my mother been dead ? "
"She was buried only yesterday. " '
"Could you not have kept her body
until I came ? "
"No ; we did just as your mother in
structed us to do. "
"How was that ? "
. "For a week before her death your
mother kept that light burning in the
window. "
"She expected my return ? "
"Yes. "
"Well , go on. "
* 'Five days ago your mother .called
me to her side , and then asked me to
bring her the light. I did so. She
gazed upori it , and smiled. Then she
told me to fill it afresh and trim and
light it. I did so , and she told me to
set it in the window. "
"Bless Her bless her ! " sobbed the
boy.
boy."When
"When I had replaced the light , she
said : 'In an hour I shall be no more.
I should like to see my dear boy once
more , but I fear I shall not be able to
do so. But keep the light burning In
the window until the oil is exhausted ,
andit goes out of itself. Then , and
not until then , place my body In the
grave. If my boy arrives , he will see
the light if it be still burning , and will
hasten here. He will gaze upon my
pale , cold face , and read there the
words of blessing I would speak. If
no light be burning , he will know that
his mother is no more ; and , bending
over my grave , he will weep and
mourn my loss. But tell him I am not
lost. Tell him to look up to the blue
arch above him , and in heaven's win
dow he will see the light which.his
mother placed there , burning brightly ,
a signal and a beacon for him. ' Say
ing this , she died. "
"And you did as she requested ? "
"Yes ; the grave was made in the
grove yonder. At sunset yesterday the
lamp went out , and we then placed her
poor body to rest. "
Frank Ludlow did not sleep that
night , but set himself to work to beau
tify and ornament the spot where slept
that dear clay. When morning dawn
ed , the fresh , green sod covered the
mound , and flowers had been planted
upon it. This done , with a heavy
heart , the lad set out to rejoin his
ship.
ship.When
When he entered the cabin , the cap
tain asked :
"Well , Frank , was the absence ol
the light explained ? "
"Yes , sir. "
"Why , was it not burning ? "
"It has been transferred , sir , to one
of the windows of heaven. I shall only
see it when I have made my last voy
age across the dark river of death. "
Frank set about his duties with ap
parent cheerfulness ; but it was evident
that he was heart-broken.
The ship was again upon its return
voyage from New Orleans. It was opposite
"
posite the point where stood the lone
ly cottage and where slept the mother's
clay. The entire ship's officers and
crew surrounded the couch of the dy
ing boy. He asked :
"Captain , are we not near the cot
tage ? "
"Yes , Frank ? "
"But can you see the light burning ? "
"It is not burning there , Frank. "
"But it is burning up "yonder , for I
can see it. "
The brave boy did not speak again.
He smiled , and his spirit passed
quickly away.
Did he not see the light his mother
had placed in the window of his heav
enly home , even before he had reached
it ?

What Mary Gave.
She gave an hour of patient care to
her baby sister who was cutting teeth.
She gave a string and a crooked pin
and a great deal of good advice to the
three-year-old brother who wanted to
play at fishing. She gave Ellen , the
maid , a precious hour to go and visit
her sick baby at home , for Ellen was a
widow , and left her child with its
grandmother while she worked to get
bread for both. She could not have
seen them very often if our generous
Mary had not offered to attend the
door and look after the kitchen fire
while she was away. But this was not
all Mary gave. She dressed herself so
neatly , and looked so bright and kind
and obliging , that she gave her mother
a thrill of pleasure whenever she
caught sight of the young , pleasant
face she wrote a letter to her father ,

swift or slow advancement to fortune ,
position and reputation from meager
and unpromising beginnings. Every
man who , unaided by family influence
and fortunc.makes his way to the front
by honorable industry and well direct
ed ability , is a hero In the eyes of
youth a hero who has sustained the
test of manhood , met the conditions of
worthy success , and passed victorious
ly the obstacles which He in every path
to fortune. Whenever such a man
tells the story of his success , he re
veals the qualities which have brought
him Influence , reputation and prosper
ity , and demonstrates again the fami
liar truth that a man's fate lies in his
character and not in his conditions ;
that heroic resolve , unshakable pur
pose , and courageous devotion are not
at the mercy of accident and- the ca
price of circumstances , but work their
way and their will to the victorious
end. When the story of such a life is
told , the eternal romance of all noble
striving pervades it ; that romance
which shines upon the world in the
eye3 of each succeeding generation of
youth , and which draws every ardent
spirit with Irresistible insistence. For
the promise of life , intelligently under
stood , is never broken to those who
are willing to meet the conditions of
its fulfilment ; it Is broken only to those
who misread it or who fail to stand
the tests which it imposes. The ro
mance of the successful career lies in
the contrast between its meager prom
ise and its noble achievement ; be
tween the materials with which it had
to deal and the imperishable uses to
which those materials have been
put.

CANTON , O. , Dec 3. Mrs. Nancy
Allison McKinley , mother of the pres
ident , was stricken with paralysis
yesteray morning and it feared that
her death is only a question of a
• short time.
The paralysis at present Is of but
amlld form , but owing to her extreme
age , nearly 80 years , Dr. Phillips , the
attending physician , can give but Httlo
hope to the family. Mr. Abner McKin
ley , of New York , has been visiting
her for a few days and when his
mother was stricken this morning im-
mafiiatley communicated with the
president by telephone. The latter
asked if he better start at once , to
which Abner McKinley replied he had
best wait a further report from the
physician , who would make a call in
time to advise by 1 o'clock.
The physician's statement to the
family was that there was little doubt
that the attack would ultimately re
sult in death , but that there was no
indication as yet as to when the end
might come. The attack was very
light and in a younger person would
not necesarily be regarded as danger
ous , but to one of her advanced years
there is every pi obabillty that the at
tack would become aggravated. The
end , he said , might be in a short time
or it might be in a week or even
longer interval.
WASHINGTON , Dec. 3. President
McKinley left the city at 7:30 : o'clock
last night over the Pennsylvania rail
road to hasten to the beside of his
sick mother at Canton , where he will
arrive today. With him went Judge
Day , assistant secretary of state. The
president had made hurried arrange
ments for his departure , and during
the afternoon disposed of a large vol
ume of business awaiting his atten
tion. He reached the station unattend
ed a few minutes before the time for
the train to leave. Desiring to avoid
any demonstration the president in
structed the coachman to drive to the
baggage entrance , where Assistant
Secretary Day , Secretary Porter and
Executive Clerk Cortleyou awaited
him.
him.The
The president's stay at Canton will
depend upon the condition in which
he finds his mother. If she improves
he will return to Washington in time
for the opening of congress and latei
go again to Canton.
CANTON , O. , Dec. 3. The presi
dent and all other members of the
McKinley family not already here , are
en route to the bedside of Mother Mc
Kinley tonight. The message from the
president was addressed to his brother
Abner , who has been visiting at the
home of their mother for several days.
It caused the mother much cheer and
comfort.
The president had not yet been sum
moned to the bedside of his aged
mother , who , no doubt , is rapidly
nearing the end. But true to the de
votion he has always shown for wife
and mother , he could no longer re
main , knowing that b s mother was
seriously ill. Without waiting for the
telephone message which had been
arranged for at 5 o'clock , he began
preparations for coming to Canton.
Mrs. A. J. Duncan , of Cleveland , a
daughter of Mother McKinley , who is
in Chicago visiting her daughter
Sarah , who is attending school there ,
telegraphed that she would be in Can
ton this morning. Miss Helen McKin
ley makes her home here with her
mother.
What was feared when Mrs. Nancy
Allison McKinley was stricken with
a slight attack of paralysis , is to
night regarded as almost a certain
ty ; that is the early death of the pres
ident's mother. As the day advanced
she grew gradually worse and the
members of the family felt that she
was slowly sinking , although after she
fell in the semi-comatose state early
in the day there was scarcely an ap
preciable change.
Dd. Phillips thinks the develop
ments of the night will decide the
matter. He expects no material change
before morning. Although he arrange !
to call at any time during thei night
that he may be summoned , a change
for the better by morning he would
regard as an indication of a temporary
ary rally , and that the end will not
come for some time. Should the
morning condition be for the worse ,
he expects the patient to sink very
rapidly. The disease , he says , is not
primarily paralysis , but senility , the
result of old age , which has produced
partial paralysis. In such cases he says
there is a general breaking down of
the powers and nothing left upon
which to build up strength and tnc
basis of recovery.
The doctor said after he saw Mrs.
MfKmley that there was some slight
evidence that the facial expressions
of the patient were less ricid than
they were early in the day , this heing
noticeable when she. endeavored to
comply with his request to show her
tongue , although she was unable to do
this.
this.The
The patient is taking liquid nourish
ment at intervals , and will not suler
from want of food. Mr. Abner McKin
ley said last night that he thought his
mother was sinking rapidly and he
feared the end was not far off.
