old standards of wage and industry in

After placing himself upon record
as believeing in the "adequate wage

Tlie president of the United State
in his message to Congress, stamp
his approval upon a plan which
thinks will bring to satisfactory term
inatiou all industrial disputes, which
in the past have led to war and labor
unrest, lie says:
"In the matter of international di
putes which have led to war, states
men have sought to net up artntra
tiou as a remedy lor war. Does tin
not point the way for the settlement
of industrial disputes, by the estab
lishment of a tribunal, fair and just
alike to all. which will settle luuus
trial di-putvK, which In the Vast have
led to war and disaster,?''

That fs' exactly what this newspaper
and others, what many o" Americas
most prominent citizens have urged
the, formation of such ; tribunal, aiid
which has been called a Court of lu
dtistry.
Such a plail.' .Mr. President, and
gunlemeit of Congress, will open the
way for industrial America to travel
upon the straight road of justice to
all classes and conditions of men."
This is the road. President U ilson
says, leads to "economic and social re
form." .

Pallas Athene, tho 'personifying all
wisdom, probably, hesitated n little
and rubbed her eves before she be
came accustomed to her sudden en
vironment. That is what America Is
doing now. Europe needs America's

of a quick ending of the strike.
Terms Closely Guarded.
Indianapolis. Dec. n. --Settlement
within twenty-four hours of the strike
of Irtil.tiOii bituminous eoal miners of
tho country which had its Inception
i more inaii nve weeks ago, was con
fidently predicted today.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon the ex
eculive board and scale committee of
the I'nited Mine Workers of America
were scheduled to go In session to
discuss a proposal made by President
Wilson to jonn l.. l.ewts, acting pres
ident, and William (lieett. secretary
treasurer of the organization. Satur
day night. The proposal was ap
proved 'by the miners' officials, who
agreed to urge the executive -board to
! accept it as basis for settlement of
jthe strike.
I The terms of the proposal .-ubmitte l
to Mr. Lewis and Mr. Green Saturday
tili;hi still were a carefuly guarded
.secret tins morning.
While none cf those present at the
waslilustou conterence would give
out any details of the President's
proposition, it was believed in most
circles that the new otter did not con
template any advance in wages above
the II pe rcent previously siiggeste 1
by the government as basis for set
tlement of the strike.

Opposed by Hitchcock
"The senate itself is required to act
en the treaty, said Mr. mtencock.
I'nder the constitution, tile President
is required to submit treaties ta the
senate for disposition. He has done
this with the German treaty. The
senate has not acted finally nor dis
posed of ft. It merely lias refused to
idopt proposed amendments, reserva
tions and three resolutions of rat iti; :t-tion.
"The treaty still is pending in the
senate, on the desk of the Vice Presi
dent and the President is not require.!
to withdraw and resubmit it. The
duty of disposing; of the treaty de
volves itself upon the senate without
other action by the President."
Senator Hitchcock reiterated bis.
objection to bringing the treaty be
foi' the senate again "to have it
kicked around lik a football before

bear, and he has had to bear many of
them, lias been brought about by his
intense earnestness lu that direction.
Von can rely thoroughly on every
promise he niake.

the stoppage of work in Hip mines we
I are facing the most difficult indtis
