THE RED RIVER REBELLION
Some* over zealous f. leads of tlii°
country are becoming very much .alarm
ed for fear that should m liters come to
a crisis with the Red River settlors this
country would be made a thoroughfare
for the troops sent by the Canadian
Government in rutting down r ‘iat
fractious population.
Wc consider these fca s groundless,
lathe first place we : ardly think the
government of Great Britain woulu
have the presumption to ask a favor of
that kind from us, who still smart under
the treatment wo received from that
government during the late Rebellion,
and in the second place it is conceded
all around that those Seikirkers have
our warmest sympathy in the position
they have taken. They are doing
nothing more nor less than asserting
the right of self government. In fact
their position hardly reaches out to that
point, they merely a.-k for the privi'ege
of a little '.oice in the selection of rulers
for their territory, and are opposed not
only to having their country disposed
of as merchantable property, but them
selves handed over bodies and souls as
part of the merchandize.
The Red River Rebels still holdout,
and Gov. McDougall dues not move a
peg from his posi ion at Pembina He
is in no condition to show any authori
ty without troops, and unless trans
ported through our territory it would
take many months to send him any as-
that kiud. Perhaps, now,
after all, tho matter may end, as it 1
should, annexation of their tend 1
tory to the United States. We know
that a large portion of the population
are favorable to the project; this is more
particularly true of the French half
breed ; it is not, however, so certainT ow
the Scotch and English half breeds feel
on this subject; but as a choice between
becoming the subdued subjects of Can
ada, or anuexatiou, they would uu- 1
duubtedly accept the latter alterative. |
DEATH OF A D- RICHARDSON
' ibis noted journalist and writer, who
was shot by 31 cFarland in Kow York
city a few weeks ago, died on Thursday
last from the effects of his wound.. A
day or two previous to his decease 3lr.
Richardson was married to 3lrs. 31c
Farland, Henry Y ard Beecher perform
ing the ceremony, and Horace Greeley
being one of the witnesses. We think
many of the newspapers throughout the
country are committing a great wrong
in forestalling public opinion against
McFarland in this affair, for this case
undoubtedly, like all others, has two
sides to it It is only natural of coarse,
that under tiic circumstances, 3lr.
Ilichardsou should have the press come
t,o his rescue, but we are hardly pre
pared to admit that because of tliis dis
graceful transaction 3lr. Richardson
should be canonized as a martyr, 3lrs.
McFarland as a saintly heroine, and
Mr. 3lcFarlund condemned before the
public and country as a cold blooded
murderer. Before justifying fully Rich
ardson’s course, let us wait for the evi
dence in the case on both sides, for
perhaps, after all, 3lcFarlaad may be
able to show some palliating cireuai
stances which will temper and soften
the crime for which he now stands
condemned. Prying into household af
fairs is not only contemptible, but wick
ed io the extreme, and when carried to
such an extent, as to cause the separa
tion of man and wife, it is not surpris
ing if someone should g-t hurt. There
is too much of this business goixg on
all over the land, and the sooner the
people are convinced that ‘‘what God
has joined together let not man put
asunder,” the better it will be for the
country generally.
For Sergeant ax-Arms. The
two Norwegian papers published in this
State that have always battled so nobly
for the Republican cause, are out in fa
vor of Col. Ole 0. Johnson of Dane
county for Sergeant-at-Arms of the
nest Assembly.
Col. Johnson served with honor and
and distinction during the war, and
representing as he does our large Nor
wiegan population, nine tenths of whom
are Republican to the core, it must cer
tainly be conceded that he has strong
claims on the position, especially since
that class of our voters wore ignored
at the late State Convention, to give
away to others. In speaking thus we
do not wish in any way to prejudice
the claims of other worthy and we I
qualified candidates v\h) have been
named throughout the Stat: icr this

Defaulter.— The Mansion Star
reports that John O’Rourke, treasurer of
Juneau County, is a defaulter to the amount
of $907,57. -This amount, however, Mr.
O'Rourke's bondmen and friends have se
emed to the county, and the office has been
placed in bands of Thomas Weston, one of
the principal sureties.
A man, while bunting on the hills
below Coon Creek, near La Crosse,
tracked a fox some distance, and final

that lay against the side hill. The hole
j being large enough to admit the man as
j well as the fox, he thought it best to
j capture the sly chicken-thief. So, put
| Cng on heavy mittens to prevent the
; fas from-biting him, he crawled into
the log. He was about to bag the
game, when, to his horror, the log be
gan to roll down hill with fearful voloc
ity. and the poor fellow was almost

I Pi is cries for help were hoard by some
wood-choppers, who went to the rescue,

Custom of Giving Bridal Gifts,
i Speaking of this subject the New-
I York World has the following sensible
remarks;
“As things go now a-days, an invi
tation to a wedding is no laughing mat
ter. Those pasteboard squares, with
their entanglement of monograms, sum
mon us to take part in a great many
absurdities of custom; but,of all these
the most absurd and burdensome is that
of giving presents. The fact is that
marrying people practice upon all their
friends at the present day a system of
bare f cod extortion, without giving
them the right to resent or expose it.
Tbers is no pretense of spontaneity or
sentiment in those gifts; they are pur
chased because they must be; and this
the receiver well understands. The
exactions upon people of moderate
means, rating their affections before the
town by the number of dollars they
are ab e or willing to invent on the oc
casion, and mortifying them if the gift
be small by parading it. with name at
tached, in contrast with the outlay of
wealthier friends, is so essentially vul-
gar and indelicate that it is a wonder I
how it ever came to be tolerated in
any society claiming to be refined.
The custom is absurd, also, as well as
vulgar and burdensome, when one ;
comes to reflect upon it. The mutri- ;
raonial party really gain nothing, for
they have to pay the same in value
when the donors invite them to a
similar occasion; so their gifts are sim
ply loans. How many times the bride
must have said, 'Thank you very much ;
how lovely it is !” over this amount of
plate, when she knows that the equi
valent which must be given for it in
the future would purchase a uniform
service after her own heart. As it is,
each couple find themselves possessed
of a heterogenous mass of silverware
not only unlike in design, but with ;
excesses and deficiencies which nobody |
could foresee. We have heard of one |
bride with self-control enough to smile
secretly on receiving her fourth soup- j
ladle, and her white lies of gratitude i
must surely L-e pardoned to her for
their very heroism.”

MURDER, IN GRANT COUNTY.
The Platteville IH'Oiess says that
Christopher Ko'ly, living ab >ut a mile
and a half east of Fairplay, in the
smthern part of Grant county, was
murdered Monday night, the 15th nit.
His wife did not teport his murder un
til Tuesday evening, when she went to
Fairplay and informed the authorities.
From her statement it would appear
that on Monday night someone came
to the house after all had retired and
called for her husband* lie got ud
and went out. She then fell asleep and
slept till morning, and when she got up
they found him lying outside the door
with ‘.he back part of his head smashed
in. The Dubuque Herald gives the
following details obtained from Daniel
Kelly, a son of the murdered mac,
living in Dubuque :
Christopher Kelly, a man fifty-two
years of age and an old well-known
citizen, lived in a small house two miles
east of Fairplay, and had a small farm
of forty acres. With his wife he came
over to Dubuque on Sunday the 1-lth to
make a visit to his son and returned
o-i Mondayjthe day following. He left
Dubuqe about 10 o’clock A. M., on
the 15th, and went to bis home near
Sinsinawa Mound, where he arrived
between three and four o’clock on the
evening of the same day. lie was seen
doing his chores that night, when he
was in good health ; ho was also seen
in bed by a neighbor, between 9 and
10 o’clock at night. He was found
dead about 7 o’clock tl e next morning,
within about six paces of the door. He
tiad four large gashes in his head, and
his skull was completely smashed in;
a scratch, supposed to have been made
by a hand, was seen extended down
tke right jaw. lie was completely
covered with snow, indicating that the
j murder had been committed before the
snowstorm came on, there being a heavy
snow that night. His wife states that
she awoke in thtf night feeling cold,
and found that Kelly was missing.
Thinking he might have gone and slept
in another bed, there being two beds
in the same room, she went to sleep
again. Upon waking between six and
seven in the morning, she got up, and
started out to feed the stock, but had
hardly proceeded as far as the corn
crib, probably ten paces from the house,
when she discovered a heap on the
west side of the h mse, about six paces
from the door. She went up to it
smoped down and took hold of it, and
found it was the body of her husband.
Sue then wemjro her sou's house, John
Murray, about a quarter of a mile dist
ant, to get soiri-j help. Murray re
turned with her and removed the body
into the house. They then went out,
shut the door, and returned to her
son ( s house.
Kelly was not supposed to be worth
much in actual cash. He had no land
ed property said his son, and had noth
ing more than about 8500 worth of
personal property. The general pre
sumption at the pres nt time is against
John Murray, who it is believed had
some spite against him It appears
that Murray had two little pigs, weigh
ing about fifty pounds each, which were
running round the old man’s place and
eating Iris chickens, which annoyed
Kelly, and he told Murray he would
kill the pigs if they were not removed.
Murray was heard to say a few days
; after this that if the old man crossed
; his path ho would kill him.
i After the murdei a bloody hammer,
an ax with a short handle, covered
; with hair and blood, and a bloody shirt
were found stowed away in one of the
chambers. 31 array is a son of Mrs.
Kelly by a former husband, and is a
man thirty-one years of age. He and bis
wife Ine in a small house on the other
corner of the forty acres, lie has not
been upon good terms with the old man,
though there is no difference except
some of the trivial masters already
mentioned. He and his wife are known
to have been at Kelly’s Monday eve
ning.
31urray and his wife and Mrs. Kelly
were ail arrested on Thursday, after the
coroner’s inquest, and were held for ex
amination, which commenced on the
next Wednesday, at Fairplay, before
Justice Henry Mann. After a patient
uud full investiga ion, the two women
were discharged and 31 array was held to
bail in the sum if 810,000 to await the
action of the Grand Jury. As it is not
at a 1 probable that he can obtain bail
to that amount, he will be lodged in
jail. There seems to be little doubt in
the public mind of his gr it.
Ine manner of the killing was so
barbarous and demoniacal, .Kelly’s head
being completely hammered in, that
the whole community wore horrified at
the event, and the excitement during
the preliminary examination was very
great.

Omaha, 18G9.
Dear Bumj
Hast ever been in Omaha, where rolls
the dark Missouri down, and four strong
horses scarce can draw au empty wagon
through the own ? Where every bubble
late or soon, from frothy substance
overflowing, is made a very large bal
loon, by constant and persistent blow
ing ?. Where muddy waters rise and
swell, with fearful and restless might;
where fish are caught by sense of smell,
because they cannot see to bite? Where
sand is blown from every mound, to fill
your eyes, and ears, and tl rout; where
all the steamers are aground, and all
shanties afloat ? Where taverns have
an anxious guest for every corner, shelf
and crack, with I aif the peop e going
West, and all the others coming back ?
Where whisky shops the live-long
night are vending out their poison juice;
where men are often pretty tight, and
women deemed a trifle loose ? Where
“beats” and “blacklegs, ’ thick and
hale, or deep in faro, cards and vices;
where real estate is still for sale and
held at most outrage a s prices ? Wheic
threats are ail the run, and bloody
scalpers come to trade ; where every
thing is overdone, and everybody un
paid ? If not take heed to what I say;
you’ll find it just as I h tve foua 1 it ;
and if it lies spun your way, for God’s
sake, reader, go around it ! Omaha.

We have examined various testimonials
in the form of letters, extracts fromjforeign

the Doctor's skill in treating diseases o
