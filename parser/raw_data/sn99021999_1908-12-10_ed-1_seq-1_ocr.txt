bnt and canals of the country to the end
Uliut this nation shall have the greatest
system of waterways In the wcrld, sained
headway at the opening session of the an
il i si meeting of the Rivers and Harbors
K reus here today.
The scheme contemplates 1500,000.000 worth
(f federal bonds for internal watercourses.
In be distributed over a ten-year period of
S.rf' 'hm isTio annually. Following; the lead of
1'ienident Roosevelt and President-elect
Tnfi, both of whom before the Joint con
servation meeting advocated the Issuance
of government bonds for constructing per-n.i.r.-nt
public Improvements, enthusiastic
lido: rt mi'nt was given the proposition at
tlic coupled by Vies President Fairbanks,
Annrew Carnegie and Joseph E. Ransdell.
The aatliertng likely will adopt resolutions
asking congress to authorise the bonds.
Leading figures In the nation's public, ln
dcrtrial and commercial Ufa Indicated their
Interest In waterway improvements by their
IV es nee and participation. The speakers
Included Vice President Fairbanks, Andrew
(a:nrle. Ambassador Bryoe, Beth Low of
New Tork. Representative Joseph E. Rans
tlt'.l. Representative Champ Clark of Mis
souri, Governor Oeorge E. Chamberlain of
Oh gun and Samuel Gompers.
Upwards of 1.500 delegates, representing
forty-four states, and territories of Alaska,
New Mexico, Hawaii and Porto Rico were
In attendance. Perhaps the largest repre
sentation from any one city waa from
Nashville, Tenn., Including ten delegates.
The congress resembled a political conven
tion, the various delegations, under blue
and white banners, denoting their respec
tive states and territories, were grouped in
the Willard hotel auditorium.
Addres of Aairrw Csririle,
Interest cantered in the address of An
drew Carnegie, who received an ovation
when he declared he would lend his aid to
Inaugurate an extensive system of water
way Improvements.
Mr. Carnegie made a characteristic speech
In which he took issue with the Jc units
as to the Tutor of the country. "These
people," he said, "are alwaya talking about
how slow the world travels. The trouble
with them la that they are looking forward
tc much. Let them look back where we
on ce were and where we stand today."
After proclaiming the American constitu
tion the greatest instrument ever drawn,
Mr. Carmgie declared that there were many
things that the state could not possibly
. do; that if the general government has not
the power under the constitution, the peo
ple could make new constitution. Mr.
Carnegie warned the delegates against the
considers tijn of sectional projects, declaring
thut pnjects national in their scope were
what was wanted. The speaker bestowed
great praise upon what he termed the bril
liant work In connection with the Panama
canal. H expressed the belief, however,
I. at the utilisation of our own waterways
was of Infinitely more importance than the
Panama canal and wished that our own
waterways had been improved before the
Panama canal project had been taken up.

H4 expressed the belief that If congress

Fottner Mayor Low said that the present
greatness of New York was due largely to
the Erie canal. He said New York would
support national waterway projects as
heartily and unreservedly as any other
State.

G vi rnor Banders of Louisiana spoke of

gramsIn a letter to John E. Benton of
Keenc, N. H , who wrote asking advice
as to the good and bad points of the di
rect primary law, Senator brown today
wrote as follows:
Permit me to ssy that, in my Judgment,
a fair primary law is a long step in the
direction of a truly representative form of
government. It allows eveiy voter, whether
in the city or in the country to have a
voice in tiie selection (rt -nominees, a re
sult rarely realised under the other or
convention ssiem. Instead of depriving ths
country voter of a voire In tiie choice of
officers, the primary law allows his voices
to be hrard and counted and at the same
time di p: Ives the cities of the controlling
Influence which they usually enjoy, undor
the convention system of selecting candi
dates. The rarest value of the primary law
is the power it gives the peopie to endorse
the faithful officer and to repudiate the
faithless. I nder the old system the man
In public life was usually able to cnnirol
a convention and secure his renomlnatlon
whether he had been faithful or otherwise

people to administer tne primary cure ana

DAVIS CASE WITH THE JURY
County Attorney Conclude Argument
Late in Afternoon.
BECOMES DRAMATIC AT FINISH

The fat of Charles E. Davis, tried on
the charge of murder in the first degree
for the alleged hilling of Dr. Frederick '
Kustln September 2, s ill rests with the
Jury. The Jury went out at 5:1S yesterday
afternoon, took a recess for dinner at
and rosuroed deliberations within an hour
after In its room at the court house, ad
joining the criminal chamber where the
trial waa conducted.
At t:li o'clock Wednesday afternoon the
twelve men who must decide whether or
not Charles E. Davis shot and killed Dr.
Frederick Ruetin as the result of a suicide
pact filed into the little Jury room that
opens off the criminal court room to begin
their deliberations.
The closing argument of County Attorney
English ended at 4:55 o'clock and Judge
Bears began reading his instructions at
once. This consumed twenty minutes and
when he finished the Jurors were led into
their chamber and the door was locked be
hind them.
As .soon as the Jury had retired Charles
E. Davis, the defendant, was taken into
custody by . Sheriff Bralley and Deputy
Sheriffs Thompson and Gardipee led him
Into the sheriff's office, where he was al
lowed to remain until dinner time.
As soon as the Jurors disappeared the
crowd that filled the court room began
to melt away. A few lingered to discuss
the case or In the hopes of a speedy ver
dict, but within ten minutes after the case
closed the court room contained only a few
'tragglers of the hundreds who had watched
the case with consuming interest.
Eaa-Hak oa Final Addreaa.
County Attorney English began his final
address to the Jury at i o'clock and during
the three hours lie occupied he was listened
to with intense interest. He began at once
by urging the Jurors not to consider ths
individual who was charged with the crime
nor to be swayed by the sorrow his con
viction might cause others, but to adhere
strictly to Justice.
During the eariy part of his address Mr.
English was skillful in the use of sarcasm
when discussing the defendant's case. At
times he became dramatic. The last half
of his address was devoted to a close re
view of the evidence. He ridiculed the alibi
of the defendant, designating It a "toilet
room alibi." When he spoke of Mrs. Abbie
IRtce. the chief witness for the state, he be
came Intensely dramatic.
"All the wealth and influence the defense
could muster has been massed against this
little woman in an effort to break down
her testimony," he said. "Every name that
months of research could reveul has been
hurled at her."
Then in a voice of suppressed feeling Mr.
English related the story from the Bible
of Christ and the woman taken in adultery
in which Christ used the words. "Let him
amongst you who is without sin case the
first stone," and after her accusers had
melted away said to the woman, "Go and
sin no more."
Girl ta JaiL Davis Abroad.
"Contrast that treatment with the treat
ment this unfortunate young girl haa re
ceived at the hands of the defense. Do
you think that aince the story of this girl's
sin has been told she has not expiated for
her sin? During ths long days shs has
been in custody while this defendant has
been at liberty do you think she has suf

WASHINGTON. Dec t.-AJthough pass
ing a night of comparative rest at the
Emergency hospital, the condition of Senor
Don Juan Barrios, minister of foreign af
fairs of Guatemala, and minister to ths
United States on a special mission, is re
garded today as still critical. The diplomat
was injured seriously in aa automobii ac
cident . yesterday, but his chance of re
covery are considered fairly good.
Ail ths other nembers of the party, who
so narrowly escaped death when a big
touring car turned turtle near the new
highway bridge over the Potomac are re
ported to have been injured much less
seriously than Senor Barrloa . The Guate
malan diplomat suffered a fracture of the
skull, concussion of the brain and abrasions
of the face and body.
The police are searching ths city today in
efforts to recover about 11,300 stolen from
Senor Barrios by some one who crowded
around the overturned automobiles and its
unconscious occupants.
Senor Barrios had three $1,000 bills and
perhaps three $100 bills in a long pocket
book bearing his name. That could not
be found after the accident.
Government officials in Washington were
peculiarly touched by the accident, owing
to the fact that Senor Barrios and his
party consisting of General John Drum
mond, Senor Luis Toledo Herrarte and a
chauffer, were on their way to Mount
Vernon to place a wreath on the tomb of
Washington at the request of ths president
of Guatemala.

country. Pittsburg was an exception with
sixty nine "social marriages" this year, as
against sixty-five last year, and Chicago
was stationary with US. Compilers of the

MORE JOBS FOR DEMOCRATS
Plan to Legislate Present Bank
Examiner Out of Office.
DRAFT OF BANK GUARANTY LAW
Geverser-eleel Bballeaberrer Pro
roses ta Have Isaagaral Ball with
Staff af Bath Geveraen
- Prcseal.
(From a Staff Correspondent.)
LINCOLN, Dec . (Special.) Republi
can bank examiners who are now holding
down Jobs will, in all possibility, have to
give way to democrats after the legis
lature gets to grinding. Governor-elect
Shallenberger has a plan for a law
guaranteeing bank deposits, whloh will
change the present banking board com
pletely. Governor-elect Shallenberger plans to
draft a bill or have drafted a bill, to
guarantee bank deposits, which will not
be objectionable to the department of
banking at Washington, thereby permitting
the operation under the law of the national
banks.
The law which It Is planned to enact
will provide for a limited assessment upon
each bank that is when the assessment
Is levied for a year that will b the limit
of the amount any bank will have to pay
in that year.
The law will empower the governor to
appoint a board composed probably of
bankers or others who are fitted for the
work to superintend the working or en
forceroent of the law.
This board probably will consist of three
members who shall serve without pay,
receiving only their expenses like the
regents of the Stat university. The gov
ernor-elect would permit the banks to
have a say or st least recommend some
of the bank examiners, for he believes as
each bank will be responsible in case of a
failure, the banks should have something
to say in the matter of getting competent
examiners.
"One of the objections raised by the de
partment at Washington against permit
ting the national banks to operate under
the guaranty law," said the governor-elect,
"is because under the Oklahoma law there
is no limit to the assessment which might
be made against the banks. I have talked
to the national bankers and I believe from
what they tell me this objection will be
eliminated by fixing the amount of the
levy specifically at a certain rate. Then
each bank will know exactly what It has
to pay to the guaranty fund.
"I would incorporate in the law a provis
ion empowering the governor to appoint a
banking board to look after the enforce
ment of the law. I am satisfied I ran find
plenty of capable men who will serve in
this cspaclty without pay, for the good of
the state. This board would have general
control, the aame as the regents exercise
over the affairs of the State university.
"The appointment of such a board wou'd
in no wise reflect on the state officers who
now compose the State Banking board. But
looking over the number of boards to which
state officers belong. I am convinced there
sre too many. The state officer should
have more time to attend to the duties of
his office."

Chairman Kennedy was ths first to speak
and he paid a warm tribute to the stales

people.
Mayor Dalilman spoke briefly and re
ceived an ovation from the children when
he arose to apeak. The mayor was fol
lowed by Governor Sheldon of Nebraska,
who arrived early Wednesday morning.
The governor was g vm a tremendous
cheer, the boys and girls being especially
enthusiastic and Jumping on top (if their
chairs and waving their handkerchiefs as
would some of their fatheis and muthe.s
at a political convention or woman's cluu
meeting.
Governor Sheldon aJdresse! himself at
once to the boys and girls, saying:
"We are preparing the generations ss
they grow up lor ths future work which is
to be done on the farms. Some men work
a lifetime io organize some business system
or to develop some variety of grain which
Is adaptable to their soils and climates,
then such expositions as this gather the
information and the graphic illustrations,
the actual grains produced t getlier, anl
the boys and girls and the men and women
may see with their own eyes what has
been done and learn how it was don, thus
securing information whi h It has required
a lifetime to collect in a very few m nutes.
Best that taa Me Pradared.
"We are gathered here today to see the
very beat which can be produced in all
parts of the country', and we are glad to
have the great exposition ou Nebraska soil,
where theie are men who are giving their
lives to make our agricultural products
better.
"The great law of heredity holds good In
the vegetable kingdom as well aa in the
animal kingdom and men have found that
belter plants may be secured by selection
of the parents the same as we did when we
decided the Texas sleer must go and we
have replaced him with the Shorthorn, Gal
loway and th Hereford.
"Now we are going to replace our scrub
and common grains and plants with ths
higher type the type that we may be as
proud of as we are of our Hertford and
Galloways."
The governor told the children that h
hoped after seeing the National Corn txpu
snkm many of them would be influenced
to go the farms and make that their life
long home, as there was no other place
where such a good home could be made
and where they would have such frarduut
