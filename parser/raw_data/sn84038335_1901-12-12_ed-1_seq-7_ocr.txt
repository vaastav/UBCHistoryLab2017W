Old-fashioned Training
Its Strong: and Weak Points.
The strong point of the old-fashioned
training was the stress laid upon moral
ity and virtue. "Be good and you'll
be happy," was the common precept set
before the growing child, But as the
girl grew up to maidenhood she was
often sorely puzzled to reconcile those
past teachings with her present condi
tion. She was good. Her soul was
pure as the lillies of her garden. Her
heart was undefiled. And yet die was
desperatly unhappy by reason of physi
cal ailments common to women.
This was the weak side of old
fasliioued training: It ignored the
needs and requirements of the body.
Alllts effort was to guide the heart and
mind. The body might stumble along
anyhow, and it generally did.
Many a sweet-faced, modest-minded
young girl has had her first doubts of
the goodness of Providence come in
through the door of physical suffering.
Why must I suffer in this way she
asks," Why does tny back ache, my head
throb and my side pain, so that I am
fain to creep away into a darkened
room and forego the pleasures which
belong to my season of life?"
NO ANSWER COMES
as a rule to these questions. The young
woman looks around and sees scores of
similar sufferers. She is told it is apart
of the burden laid upon women, and she
shapes her shoulders to her heavy load.
Tliis is all a mistake. Proper train
ing, proper physical care would many
times prevent these miserable condi
tions. But in any case, however dis
tressing the present condition, it can be
cured by the use of Dr. Pierce's Favor
ite Prescription, if it is a disease curable
by medicine.
«I write a few lines to thank you for
your advice and grand remedies, to
which I owe my health, and perhaps
my life," says Miss Flora I. Greer, of
107 Howe Street, Akron, Ohio. "My
trouble started during my childhood,
but did not prove serious until 1893,
when I met with an accident caused by
horse running away. From that time
I did not see a well day. I suffered at
every monthly period with terrible
headache, irritation of the spine and
pains in my heels so I could not bear
them resting on the softest pillow.
What I suffered pen could never de
scribe. I had soreness through my
hips and ovaries all the time and con
stant backache. Was afraid to be alone,
imagined that every one hated me, and
everything looked like a mountain.
One doctor would tell me one thing
ailed me, another would say something
altogether different, but tliey only re
lieved me. I then wrote you in April,

Iowa Party in California.
From a letter just received from Mrs
Annie Shultz Pierce, of Pasadena, Cal.
we learn that Mo. Valley, Iowa, is pret
ty well represented in the Golden State
at this time. Mrs. M. Hllnkiron, a for
mer resident of this city, gave a party
at her daughter's, in Pasadena, on
October 21st 1901, to her Iowa friends,
at which time the following were pres
ent:
Mesdames Burton, Poland, Crawford
Keneday, Arthur, Fenner, L. M. Kel
logg, Miss Fenner, Miss Burton, and
Miss Mathews, of Wisconsin.
Mr. and Mrs. £. A. Boies, and Mr.

many otberB not mentioned. This bap
a decidedly Iowa sound to the list.
D. M. Scott, of Griswold, is in the
city attending to business matters and

and followed your advice from April to
July. I took five bottles of Doctor
Pierce's Favorite Prescription, and four
of Golden Medical Discovery' and five
vials of 'Pellets.' Have not had a
single symptom of my old trouble so
far. Can sleep good nights, work hard,
and can eat solid and substantial food
without distress. There are several of
my friends taking your medicines with
the best results since tliey have seen
how they helped me.
If any one wishes to know more of
my case and will enclose a stamp I will
answer any question they wish to ask."
RKAI.TH FOR WOMEN.
The use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Pre
scription has brought health to thou
sands of hopeless women. If you are
sick it will almost surely bring health,
to you. In all the huueireds of thou
sands who have used "Favorite Pre
scription" for womanly ills, only two
in every hundred* have
failed of a perfect and
permanent cure. And
even these two in every
hundred have been bene
fited, their pains eased,
their burdens lightened,
their lives made nappier.
Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription establishes
regularity, dries enfee
bling and unhealthy
drains, heals inflamma
tion and ulceration and
cures female weakness.
From the first change ol
life, when the girl be
comes a woman to the

ana a cure for womanly
ills.
"Your letter just re
ceived," writes Miss Rose
Kilfether, of 43 West
Sharpnack St., German
town, Philadelphia, Pa.
"Words fail to express
how thankful I am to you
for your advice. I must

I "Godsend to women"
a preservative of hea
ia
confess that for the length of time 1
have been using your medicine I have
found it to be the most wonderful ami
best remedy for female troubles that
I ever have tried. Sorry I did not
know of your Favorite Prescription'
years ago, but will gladly tell my
friends who are suffering, of your won
derful medicine."
There is no aloliol in "Favorite Pre
scription and it is entirely free from
opium, cocaine and all other narcotics.
Sick and ailing women are invited to
consult Dr. Pierce, by letter, free. All
correspondence held as sacred and
womanly^ confidences guarded by the
same strict professional privacy which
is observed in the personal consulta
tions of Dr. Pierce and his staff (num
bering nearly a score of physicians)
at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute, Buffalo, N. Y. Address Dr.
R. V. Pierce, Buffalo, N. Y.
It sometimes happens that the dealei
tempted by the little more profit paid
by less successful preparations, will try
to press a substitute upon the customer,
claiming that "it is just as good as
Pierce's.'' It is well to remember at
such a time, that the claims of superi
ority made for Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription do not rest on mere words,
but upon cures. Thousands of weak
women made strong and sick women
made well testify to its superiority over
other put-up medicines for women.
THK BIBI.E OF THE BODY,

Recalls the Days of Long Ago
H. Newton tIns morning received a
memento that quite vividly recalls to
(us mind the days of long ago. when
as station agent, for ihe S. .\c I', at
ltiver Sioux he sold tickets, checked
baggage, sent messages, and acted as
general utility man for the Company,
while the Indians from the nearby
reservations on the outside howled
their disapproval of the white man's
advauce. The memento was in the
form of a weekly balance sheet show
ing the total transactions lor the

date January h. l.y.'.t, and shows the
total ticket sales fur the seven da\s

Death of Conductor Walling.

and most popular conductors on the
Northwestern road, passed away Satur
day afternoon while being brought to
ISoone from the hospital at (,'larinda.
Last summer Mr. Wallmg's mind be
gan to fail him, and a few weeks ago
it was decided to send him to the state
hospital at Clarinda, hut the physicians
there gave his friends no hope for his
recovery. Saturday moiniug word
reached the city that he could uot live
and was being brought to Boone. The
Northwestern sent a special car for
him and everything possible was done
for him, but his life passed out before
the train reached liione. Mauytfriends
were at the depot to show their respect
for the departed one. Mr. Wallinp
was with the Northwestern road when
it was built through this part of the
state. For many years he had charge
of the company's coal yards at Moin
gona, and later had charge of the
"pushers" on the Moingona hills. Of
late years he has been a passenger
coudctor aud among the entire force
there was none more generally es
teemed, aud his death has brought sor
row to hundreds of railroad men.
