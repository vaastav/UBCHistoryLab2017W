Thrc. tiusIncss-Hko highwnjmen met
George YW Gammon in iho Santa l"e rail
road j arils at Nineteenth and l.ihcrty
streets last night and robbed him in the
latest approved fashion. They look everj--thing
ho h.id, except his underclothes,
sewks and li.it. It was a cold night, too,
the wind piercing and tho ground snow-covcrc-el.
The police are puzzled to under
stand why the robbers didn't do a complete
job of it. IJere is what Gammon lost:
Ono mcno.it.
One waistcoat and vest,
dm' p ilr of trousers,
lino pair of shoes,
Twcntj -eight dollars in monej-.
To offset this. Mr. Gammon saved:
One new -uit of underwear.
One pair of woolen socks.
One liat. almost Rood as new; and
His life.
"lie ought to he thankful for that." mut
tered one old lopper, after hearing the
story of Gammon't. expriiencc.
T.'ie way is long and the shadows are
tliick and M.n 1; in that portion of the town
vrhcie Gammon met with his experience.
Interlacing railroad tracks spread like an
illy woven wilt otr the dlstriit. and a
stranger trudging through it with a lan
tern in one hand takes, his life in the other
after nightfill. Big, lumbering box cars
come booming out of the d irkness and
tiery headed switch engines pant and ro ir
a., they skurry hither and thither through
tho night. It i an ideal spot for crime's
playground after dusk. Hut Gammon didn't
know this, liecauo ho had just come to
town from Topek.u
Gammon, who is a farmer from I5Iue
Springs, Mo, and was en route home, got
oft the train in the railroad jards and
Marled across the interwoven tracks to Me
his friend. O'Donncii. who keeps a. saloon
at Seventeenth and Genesee streets, which
Is hard by. Gammon was trudging along
dodging box cars and feeling as comforta
ble as it is possible in a new Helton oxer
coat, a spick and span suit of black worst
ed, a new pair of shoes and three silver
dollars to jinglo '- lib? r"u.-ers pocket, to
hay nothing of 23 in crisp green bills
tucked snUgly away in his inside xest
pocket. He was thinking of a steaming
hot Tom and Jerry he intendid haling with
his friend O'Donnell when a big and gruif
oke camo booming out of. the darkness:
"Hold up jour haml, pjrdner; here's
where jou pay tribute."
It was a, tierce oico that pierced the
night air. and when a shadowy outline with
a sh idowy revolver in a. shadowy hand
Klided into his presence, to enforce the com
mand. Gammon slid his hands up into the
air above his head. Out of the same dark
rets two more phantom-like forms, larger,
taller, camo gilding as r lnforcements to
the possessor of the large olcc.
"Search him!" commanded the first shad
ow y form.
One of tho taller men sidled up to Gam
nton and went through his pockets as deftly
lis ho could have.done it himself. Nothing
escaped the riimble lingers of the rogue, not
even the crisp, green bills in the inside vest
pee ket.
AVlien tho men had searched Gammon,
one of the sm iller ones said:
"Jim, that's a good overcoat de guv's got.
It would suit jou. He's got on purtj- good
'tegs, too."
Jim was the tall man. Ho promptlv took
hold of Gammon's overcoat and pulled it
off. Gammon begged th" men not to un
dress him in tho cold night,
""Tell with jou." answered the big mm.
"You make a break an' I'll blow jer brains
cut " r
When one of the sm ill men attempted to
rt move G immon's cout and vest, he planted
a big fist on his jaw. Tills tii Med the

fiimi the tali inanlto lie still or he "would

Almost everybody believed joteiday that

"Thais a touch of genuine Dikota

what a terror this would lie if it was bit

Dr. S. G. Gant. mamger of the University
Medical college football team, narrowly es
caped being crushed to death In a folding
bed while visiting his old home in Cow gill.
Mo, Sund iv-. The bed was one of those
massive affairs that stand around the
house during the dnj' pretending to be a,
bookcase. The doctor had been in bed but
a few moments when the lieavj- top lurcheel
forward, drawing the mattress and the
doctor toward the wall with a heavy,
scraping noise that aroused the household.
A'sisler of the doclur'a saw- the bed as it
began to close up and ran to her brother's
aid, arriving in time probablj' to save his
life, although she was not quick enough
to prevent him from being badlj- bruised.
The top of the bed caught him lij- the neck
and shut off his wind like a vice, tearing
some of the muscles in the lnck loose.
Members of the familv- hastened into the
room and pried the bed ap irt. A telegram
was sent to this eitv- for Dr. Jaliez Jack
son, who went down on tin iirst train. Dr.
Jackson said lat night that Dr. Gant was
not seriouslj" hurt, but th it Ids escaiw
from d. -ith was remark liile. Had his sister
not been in the room Dr. Gant would have
been strangled to death and it is probable
that fatal injuries would hive been in
tlicted had she not been present to break

Washington. Dee. 13 The outlook for
changing the civil service law is being
nctivelv canvassed among ltepubliqan nitm
liers ot the house as a lesult of tlie con
ference held Siturday night. The mem
bers of the -special committee having the
matter in clnrge are tr.vmg to to shape a
lull that it will commiud the support of a
number of divergent elements. One ot these
is tlie Democratic minontj, which, combin
ed with the Kcpublicans opposed to the
present law. would be stiong enough to
t.ury a bill, lint in e invasslng the situa
tion it has been found that Democratic
members would favor a complete repeal of
the law. but would oppose anj tiling short
ot a iepe.il. As the Republican movement
is not toward complete lcpial but rather
for modilication of tlie l.iw.therc appears to
be no basis bv- which the anti-civil service
reformers of both parties c in unite.
It is claimed, however, th it a modification
ot tlie lull will receive the votes ot two
thirds of the Republican members and will
have a good chance of passing the senate
and receiving tho president's signature.
Dr. Pearson, of Xortli Cirohna. who in
augurated tlie movement and is .1 member
ot the sin ei il committee sajs the essential
modilieations of tlie 1 iw likely to be ton
sidercd lij- the committee, are as follows:
Including from the operations of tlie law
cases in winch one govtmment oiiicer is re
sponsible for the 'lets of his subordin ite,
as public collectors of revenue. c imina
tion of those already covered into tlie
chi'situd service without eNamiration. so
as to put them on a footing with new ap
plicants, change of ex iininations so as to
make them more piattieal and less theoret
ical; distinct provision against life tenure
and for a. stated term of service; aflirma
tion of tlie rights of heads of departments
to remove, reduce or promote, in tlie in
terest of the public; a limitation of the
law to specihe dep irtments. bureaus, etc.,
and an exclusion of those not enumerated.
Arother point that will matcriillv- figure
in the discussion of the subject 1 the
alleged rapid and unauthorized enlaige
ir.cnt of tho functions of the iiil servue
commission. Tlie opponents of the com
mission assert that the original law was
never Intended to apply to tinure ot ollice
and removals, and that the commission,
glowing from a corrs of three commis
sioners and several clerks to a large In
st. tution, Ins arrogated to itself not only
the rank of a deputment. but the power
of dictating to lit ads of dcpirtments what
action tliej- shall take, and, fuither, to
employ .ittornevs to make pleadings. ,ls in
the case of the Virginia collector of in
ternal revenue. An attempt will be m ido
to define the exact functions of the com
mission. NO BUSINESSJN THE HOUSE.

Washington. Dec. 13 Kxccpting the re

be considered to-morrow, the house did
no public business to-dij. The entire ses
sion was consumed in adjusting a person li
dispute between Mr. Hepburn, Republican,
of low.i. and Mr. Norton, Demoerat. of
Ohio, which grew out ot a controversy
th.it occurred last week during the deb ito
on the penion bill. Iho point at issue was
as to whether a certain word used by
Mr. Norton, but winch he afterwards dis
claimed any intention of using, should ap
pear in tlie permanent record.
The house, by a part- vote, IPC to 321,
sustained Mr. Hepburn.
