'flr.9 slavery lo its prcioot limits. Enough of tor
titory is now open to slavery, to preserve U two
tiundred Tears. Twentv generations of slavef.
allowing ten years to goneratiu'n, will thus havej
to live and die in bondage. This cannot he glnd
tidings of salvation. It is cold comfort to the
young man nod woman of to day, to be told that
in two hundred years bis race shall bo free. Tho
Republican party propose to preserve tho compro
mises of the constitutionhave they considered
the nature of these compromises? It is ono thing
to compromise our own interacts for tho tuko ol
the Union, and quite another, to sacrifice tho rights
of the black man for '.he benefit of tho Uni m to
ourselves. Yet northern men boast of their ac
commodating spirit in this matter. All the South
ever meant hv Union, is her rieht to crush nod
hold the negro in bondngo to make use of the
North as her body guard her blood hound and
to hold our territory free to plunder. Tho gloiious
Union has been cemented with the blood and brains
'of the slave. Its formation at first was cruel, nnd
violent, againut right. Its founders excused them
selves, because of tho allogcd necessity of tho
... . rinrnnfiA mrainst foreicn foes. No

'foreign nations, on the contrary they have much
to fear from us, from the spread of our coirupt
morals. Abraham Linooln was elected by two
'millions of male white citizens. Count them by
'souls and how many men voted for him? It takes
'gomethinff to ma'ke a man. Ono must have a soul
Wore ha can claim an immortal Foul. Most dido
'do not Vot, they are vctcd. Though the Repub
licans have elected their President, they bavo to
sneak off the fugitive to Victoria's dominions and
ask her to expand her crinolino to protect him
from the bloody beak and talons of tho American
' Eagle.
The Republicans as men, are unwilling lo hear
'of tho compromises of the roturn of the fu
gitive of the suppression of insurrection for lib
erty. They accuse us of injustice when wo judge
them by their,party platform. They honor Juhn
. Brown. Let them como out honestly and tell the
elaveholder that he has no rights which they are
bound to respect tell the South that if another
Nat Turner a black Kossuth, should arise, they
. will render him aid in the spirit of LnFayette and
of John Brown ; that if the slaveholder comes
iier after his fugitive, they will welcorao him to a
'hospitable grave. Abraham Lincoln eays the fu
gitive must be returned; the Republicans say he
ehall not be roturnod: Let them provo their faith
by their 'works', and we will. believe.
Divided from Slavery we shall stand, being free
from the most dangerous element to freo institu
'tions. Every nation which has planted it has
found it the viper which has poisoned its life
blood. The Anti-Slavery Society has 1 jng labored
to prove this, and tbo voico of the ages concur in
its testimony. "But who hath believed rur re
port?" We are weak in numbers, but weighed,
' with -justice in the scale, we are mightily stronger
'than party, than church, than state. Who shall
'take our census ? "One shall chaso a thousand,
and two put ten thousand to flight," Tho old
'castles stood for ages, but tho Httlo ivy planted

CONVENTION IN BOSTON.
On last Monday, the third of December tho
Sunday previous being tho anniversary of John
Brown's execution a Convention was called to
moot in Boston to examine the all important ques
tion: ,-IIow can American Slavery bo abolished?
No filter place and no fitter time could have
been eeleoted for such a gathering. There roll the
Waves of Boston harbor into which on outraged
people rebelliously emptied the British tea chests,
which, for the time, represented British taxation
and oppression. There stands the Cradle of Lib
erty old Faneui! Hall whose name will outlast
the granite pile whioh marks the spot where War
ron and his companions successfully defied the
.power of the British troops. There too, linger yot
tho remembrance and the influence of the testimo
nies borne to the cause of freedom by the Hun.
occks, the Otiscs, and the Adams, the latohets of
whose ehoes the citizens of Buson are to-day un
worthy to unloose
"How can American Slavery bo abolished?"
John Brown discussed that question at Harper's
Perry in hi own peculiar way, albeit the discus
sion was conducted in precisely tho same manner
that the patriots of other days discussed at Lex
ington, and Concord, and Bunker Hill, and iu the
streets of Boston a question of similar import:
How can British Oppression be abolished? It may
bs that John Brown and the fathers were mistaken,
tut they certaiuly were sincere; and it was no
wonder that such men as he and they living out
thoir own convictions of right, and attesting thoir
faith by their life's blood, should be put down iu
the category with fools, and rebels, and traitors.
" We apprehend that a solution of the great pri
mary difficulty heretofore found, and hereafter to
be experienced in the abolition of American slave
ry, may be extracted from the fumiliar proverb'
" Where there ii a will, there is a wat," for it
ii a lamentable fact that the American people
have not now, and nover had, the will to abolish
slavery, else the way would have been found, and
the deed done. Having an unregenerated public
opinion to deal with, the way by which tho hand
ful! of workers can abolish slavery is to so change1
publio sentiment that from cities and villages.from
cross roads and by-ways, from prairies and forests, I
(here shall oome a Toioe domandiug that this crime
shall cease; the voico of the people echoing tho :
voice ef God. And to effect such a chango is ojore
work of time.
Tho crimo of American slavery h so outrageoup,
tho insults it offers to God and tlio wrong" it in
flieti upon man nro so terrible, it is tin wi.r.d -r
that every heart that beats for truth nnd ri,ht N
impatient fur lis overthrow, and count cuch line
inuct of its continuance as a year, luch year as
an ago. But when it is remembered thut the sys-
is eutrenchoti bohind two hundred years of
popular usuago nud legislative enactments, and
that it has tho sanction of tho Church and the
support of tho Stato, it is no cause for surprisa
that, tho comparatively recent efforts of a moro
handfull of opposors have not been sufficient to
beat down the mighty forco with which they have
to contend.
A convulsion in tho government, an insurroc'.ion
among tho bondmen, might causo the brcuking of
fetters, but would only be a partial success, for ii
the Bluvoholdora woro left unchanged in
principle, thoir tyrauny and oppression would be
come manifest in another form as soon as opportu
nity presented. It is tliereforo a re-formation of
public sentiment which is Deeded, nnd tho spcedi
cut way of accomplishing this is tho constant pre
Isentalion of Anti-Slavery truth, and the consistent
1.. . . , fi ,
lives nt ilioso w no truly lovo irceaom. mere is an
abundance of Anti-Slavery sentiment in the land,
but little, very li'tlo Anti-Shivery principle. The
first, ejmpathizod with John Brown in his gallant
strugjj'o against tho opprctsors in the South, and
was even moved to tears by thoughts of tho hero
iu his prison cell, and of his fato u j on the gallows;
but has now forgotten what
manner ot man lie
wos. The other honors him to-day as it honored
him then, for his devotion to tho causo of man,
for his fui'.hful and ready obedieneo to God's re
quirements as read in tho light of his own convic
tions of duly. That fluid sentiment, which is so
easily moved to and fro, must to chrystalizcd into
liriu and iinperiihablo Principle; and ono of the
means of doing this, is for tlioeo who truly hate
slavery to so livo that every ono may read thai
haired in thoir actions. And so long ns each re
tails his own view s as to what constitute! ihc most
christian nnd most effective means to wage an ag
gressive warfare ngiinst slavery, actions will pro
bably diflir; but each one's convictions of ri-)it
should bo his 'own guide, uud after having e'eans
ed his skirts of Blavcry, wo would say to each and
all, act out your own conscientious views of duly,
uso that weapon and employ those means that jou
believe you can rightfully aud most tfl'eulivoly
use.

!
THE BATTLE OF LEXINGTON.
Bancroft, in his history of the United States,
mentions tho fact that of the seven men killed at
the battle of Lexington, ono was a John Bkuw.n,
who, it seemed in 1775 dared to tuko his stand
with those, who foolishly and fatally to themselves
opposed tho power of tho Biitbu government.
Tho report of tho old muckct which a Joha Brown
fired on the plains of Lexington in '75 was heaid
throughout the land, os was the crack of tho rifle
of nnothor John Brown at Harper's Forry in '5'J.
Bancroft says :
"So fell Isaac Muzzy, and so died the aged Rob
ert Monroe, the saina who iu 1703 had been ensign
at Louisburg. Jouathau Harrington, Jr., was
struck in front of his house on tho north of the
Common. His wife was at the rvindow when he
fell. With the blood gushing from his breast he
rose iu her sight, tottered, foil ogain, then crawled
on his hands and knees towards his dwelling ; the
ran to meet him, but only reached him us he ex
pired on tho thrcshhold, Calob Harrington, who
had gono into the meeting house for powder, was
shot as ho came but. Samuel Hadlcy aud John
Brown were pursued and killed alter they bad lett
tho green. Ashael Porter, of Woburn, who hud
been takeu prisoner by the march, endeavoring to
escape, was shot within a few rods ot tho Com
mon. "
".Seven of tho men of Lexington were killei'
uiuo wou
nded-a quarter part of those who stood
in ur:ns on tho green, Thoy aro tho villago heroes
who were more than of noblo bluod, proving by
their spirit that they wero of race divine. They
gavo their lives in testimony to tho rights of man
kind, bequeathing to their country an assurance of
success in the mighty struggle w hich they had bo
gun. Their names are held in grateful rcniem.
Drunce, ana the expanding miilious ot 11,01.- coun
trymen rcnow und multiply their praise from gen
eratiou to generation. llicy lullulud their duty
not from accidental impulse of tho moment ; their
action was tho slowly ripened fruits of Providence
and of timo."
Can it be true ? A telegraphic despatch, dated
Lebanon, Ky., Dec. 1st, states that fifteen negroes
aud one whito man, their leader, had been hung
by the citizeus of Burkvillc lor attempted insur
rection. If tho above is truo, tho proceedings of
tho mob must hao beou vjry summary, for the
announcement of the punishment precedes the
information of the crime. If not al ogether a
boux, it is probably greatly exagerated.
j
MOB LAW IN BOSTON.
The telegraph gives information that tho Con
vention which assembled in Boslou on tho 3rd
inst, was taken possession of by a party vf Union
ists, who, with a single eye to tho glory of God
und tho perpetuity of tho Republic, trampled un
der foot tho rights of Northern men. lo is doubt
ful how Boston papers will characterise this act,
but out here, we should call it tho triumph of mob
law.
CRITICISE BOTH PARTIES AND SECTS.
Presbyterian Church.
The Phe'ident's Message was not roceivod in
time to permit our making any extracts. There
somo passages wo shall put upon record next
week,
G. B. Stebbins in his remarks iu the Michigau
Convention, said, "Anti-slavery speakers triiicisu
the platforms of the political parties, why nut
criticise the creeds of tho church?" We should
do it, so far as slavery is concerned, but ou an
anti-slavery plutform no further. We criticise tho
pro-slavery positions of tho Democratic und Re
publican parties, but we du not criticise their
viows of Tariffs, Bunks, Internal Improvements or
Homestead exemption. They may be intensely
for or agaiust any or all of theso, but if they be
anti-slavery, we must travel out of our path if we
attacK t&cm, ao with sects. It they show a
clean anti-slavery record, it is not for abolitionists
to enquire whethoi tbey are hetrodox or orthodox
believers in universal talvation or infant damna
tion. If they are pro-slavery, wo should oriiiciso
that feature in thoir position; but so long as thore
are found faithful abolitionists of all theological
opinions, it would seem hardly necessary either
to assert that John Brown was not anti-slavory
because he was orthodox, or that Parker Pillsbury
is not true to tho cause of the oppressed because
his theology would not pass as genuine in the

ANOTHER BEREAVEMENT.
Died, November 27th, 1S-C0, at the residence
of her father John M. llolmoB, Mastersvillc, Har
rison Co. Ohio, of I'iptheria, Sakau E. Holmes,
aged Seventeen ycais ami Five nionlhs.
This is the third daughter that within a few
months our friend has been called upon to part
with, and the fourth, and only remaining ono was
lving tick when Saiiih wos buried.
Abl y Foster recently Visited Hairison C . on
her anti-slavery mission, nud it would seem had
deepened tho interest of Sarah iu the cause of the
captive, and created in her heart a desire to do
more for his redemption than sho had before done.
When, for her, Time was about to close and Eieruity
open, when sorrowing relatives were standing
by her dying bed, she spoke of many of her
friends, and especially named Mrs. Foster, and
said that when she saw how much that friend
freedom was doing, and learned of tho sacrifices
she had mado nud was continually making, she
w ished that she, herself, could do something for
tho cause, and referred to tho gift of his life that
John Brown had freely mndo, laying it down for
the oppressed slave. Possessing in her own right
a buiall humus! ;n Lcr grauuratliei'o estate
amounting to about $100 her last request was,
that it should be given to the Anti-Slavery Society.
Her father assured her that her wish should bo
complied with provided her surviving brother, who
would be tho legal heir, made no objection. After
her decease, her brother, together with all the rest
of tho family,- expressed a strong desire that
Sarah's wish should bo carried out.
When tho legacy is received, it would bo well lo
appropriate it iu such a maimer as to make the
dying tcstirtinny of ohr young friend dccoinpli.h
all, and cvcti more than she hoped. Wo pl.icj the
j6'"1''10 fact of llur i"t pon record, f;eliig
strong assurance that that record will, of itself, be
blest to the cause i f human freedom.
From the Logan County Gazette.
WHAT WILL LINCOLN DO!
Mr. Lincoln is in the unpleasant prc'iicaaicnt of
the man in the fable, who had two wives, ono ol
whom plucked the black, ar.d the other tho white
hairs from his head. GiJdings pills out every
white huir he can discern; while Mr. Curwin and
Ewing are quite as dili-cnt in plucking out the
black ones.
Whether tho party by which Mr. Lincoln was
elected shall bocomo a white Republican or re
main a 31uck Republican organization, depends
wholly upon tho dilior.eo and adroituess of the
respeotivo hair-pullers.
We iaolino to tho belief that Ewing, Curwin,
and thut class ol men will give tone to tho admin
istration, provided we shall have another adminis
trator; aud thut Giddings and his traitorous con
federates will bo excommunicated from tho politi
cal church, aud couoigticj to tho eternal
uumna-
tion of publio scorn und detestation.
Such is to bo tho political future, if tho late
speech of Seuator Trumbull, of Illinois, delivered
in Sprioglield, within hearing of Mr. Liuoolo, is
not wholly dostitute of significance. It is patriot
ic in tono, national in promise und profession, and
wholly free from the dirty and trousonablo cant
which has hitherto marked tho stump spcechos of
tho Republican party. It contains uo denuncia
tion of tho Fugitive Law, nor of tho Dred Scott
dechion; no lying complaint of southern agress
ion, nor despicable caut about the southern slave
oligarchy; no encouragement of nullification, judi
cial or legislative; but is just such a 6peoch as
Senator Douglas might have made, and avows Mr.
Lincoln's purposes to bo, just such as Mr. Doug
las' might havo becu. If Rcuublicaus had talked
hitherto in this spirit, and conformed their acts to
such talk, thore would be nunc of tho troubles
which so vex and porplex tho people now.
Has this speech any real tigniUcauce ? We in
cline to believe it bus, and that it was inspired by
Mr. Lincoln himself. So think the Whito Repub
lican press, so far as wo kuow, wbilti tho Rluok
Republican press denounocs Trumbull as an im
pertinent meddlesome fsllow, who has epukeu
without authority, and of things whereof he is
