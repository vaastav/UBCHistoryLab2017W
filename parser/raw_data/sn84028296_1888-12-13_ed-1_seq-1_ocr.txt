There is aManlJp!
in Maine! "
So very absent minded that on go
ing np bis on ftepa, to bis own door,
he saw on a card that be wold be
b-tck in two honrs, so he sat down to
wait for himself. As we have had no
late advises we cannot say whether he
is waiting there yet or uot. But this
serves to illustrate how some people
are waitinz for themselves, . fo: it is
seldom that harvests are reaped with
out sowing, and be who is waiting like
MacCawber for .jornething to turn up
is just simp y waiting for himself,
since it is one's self that puts out the
energy, that makes the cause, that
produces the effect. We think that
we are safe in saying that thousands
of people of Henry county have had
and now have the energy to rtach our
store, and by their energy they have
found the cause that produces the de
sired economical effect. We don't
know that there are any who have
never tried our goods and prices but
if there are they must be waiting for
us to bring our store to them; we
want to say that we can't very we'.l
tote this store up and down the earth,

present supplying a long array of cus
tomers who just at this particular time

Jiow (iaiirdlos; the Jail.
Bmisixghaji, Ala., Dec. 10. The Have
murder mystery has been solved!! A terrible
riot hus . resulted. The mob stormed
the jail, bent on lynching Hawes, the mur
derer. A sheriff's posse opened fire on the
maddened crowd and shot to kilL As the
volleys rang sharply on the air a score of
citizens threw up their hands with wild cries
and groans of pain and sunk to the ground
dying or wounded. There were ten killed
outright, two fatally shot and ten wounded
more or less severely. The city is in a tumult
of intense excitement and Hawes ia still safe
in jail.
The stcry of the terrible affair is as fol
lows: Saturday afternoon the announcement
was given out that the mutilated body of the
missing mother, Mrs. Emma K. Hawes,
whose daughter May was murdered, had
been found in the murky water of the lake
at Lakeview, a suburban resort, and a half a
mile only from Eastlake, where the body of
her daughter May was recovered. The
rumor proved true, and in halt an hour
thousands of excited men, women and cbil'
dren hurried forward to the lake. The sus
picion had gone abroad early in the day that
nsely the body bad been secreted there, as.it
was only about 300 yards from the Hawes
home.
About 11 o'clock four determined men set
to work to drag the lake with grappling
hooka. 5ear II o'clock one of the hooks
struck a heavy, yielding substance, and soon
ihe mutilated corpse lay on the bank.
The combined strength of four men was
vequired to land it. The body was weighted
.town with heavy pieces of "fish-plate" rail
road iron tiea around the neck and waist of
the murdered woman. She was completely
clad, and around her neck and waist were
tied heavy scarlet cords known to have been
at the Hawes residence, to which were at
tached six iron pieces weighing about ten
pounds each.
Toe hack of the dead woman's skull shows
the horrible story of the tragedy. It had
been crushed in with some blunt instrument.
presumably an ax The entire occipital
bone is crushed in, and there is a gaping
cavity tbat is o-ily half concealed by her
heavy auburn hair. Her right band was
badly skinned across the back, as if injured
in a struggle for life, and the appearance of
the face and hands indicate : that the bodv
had been in the water several days. The
body as soon as found was taken to the shore
and laid out with the iron weights which
bad held it to the bottom still tied around
the neck and waist
As it lay on the bank the crowd of carious
and indignant spectators crowded around
and momentarily increased until it swelled
into a surging multitude. The feeling of
Horror, rase and desperation increased mo
mentarily until it reached the point of
frenzy. Fiercn tora-it. of vengeance were
heard coming from lips whose utterances the
people of Birmingham have long siuce
learned to know mean what they say, and
strong men almost cried in the intensity of
tneir excitement.
Meanwhile toe search for the body of the
youngest child ot lira. Hawei went on, but
up 10 S o'clock Sunday night it had not been
found;
Late S iturday afternoon a mob bejan to
conwvgats at Sacomt and Ihird avail no and
Nineteenth street Ic swelled to fully 10,0'K)
in number Talk of lynching Hawes and
his two nojrro accomplices in the murder was
b. ja i d ou every hand
By Mayor Tnompson'S order Marshal Pack
ard had surrounded the jail with a large
posse. li.ese ineu were armed with Win
chester r 11 and a Gatling gun.
At n:i im ;ln Saturday the mob around the
county jail t-egan slowly pressing back the
outer guard, and advanced down Twenty
flrsr, street to the mouth of the alley leading
to the jail entrance. The alley ia about a
hundred feet long and twenty wide, and is
tbe only approach to the jail. When the
crowd readied the mouth of the alley Sheriff
bnnth, from the jaiU. warned them lo stand
baca lime and aain. He yelled to them' to
keep back, as they would be fired on if they
advanced up the alley. Finally he called
oat.: ,-I will count three, and if a man re
mains in the alley we will fire.
He counted three, and the crowd feel back
a little, and the officers did not are. This
seemed to mlce the mob bolder tnd again
they pressed up the alley, bneriff Smith
yelled to tnem; "I will count fire, and if
you do not fall back we will fire." He
counted five, while the mob hooted, yelled
and continued to advance up the alley. Then
the officers opened fire, which was at once re
turned by the mob.
At least a thousand shots were fired. Then
the mob fell back leaving the ground covered
with dead and wounded men. Several dead
were hurriedly carried away by their friends
before identified. ' '
Postmaster M. B. Throckmorton was shot
through the body,-and is dead. He was near
the front of the mob trying to disperse it

Hawes was seen in tbe jail after the at
tack,' He appeared unconcerned aad saidt
"Yes, I know what the shooting meant..
Tbat crowd wanted my life and they can
have it! -.tf ;
He seemed to feel that the mob would sac.
ceed in getting in the jail, and he dressed
himself and expressed hit readiness to ac
company the crowd as toon at they reached
him. He still stoutly -asserts hit innocence
of the charge of having murdered hit wife
and child. ' ' - .
Sheriff Smith "and Marshal Pickard both
regret tbe terrible affair, but feel that they?,
did their dntv. . , t
A petition to Governor Beay waa circu
lated Sunday and received 10,000 tignatarei
demanding tbe removal of Bneriff Smith,
All day Sunday Birmingham continued in
to malt ot excitement There was, how
ever, no further attempt at storming the
Jail
The Second regiment of Georgia arrived
oa a special train, and at night 500 toldien,
with two Gatling run, guarded the jail.
It was reported Sunday night that Sheriff
Smith, Martbal Pirkard and others bad been
jailed on warrant. -
Una vary rtmarkable feature is that nearly
very man killed waa shot in the back, show
ing that the crowd had turned away when
the firing wat begun. Postmaster Throck
morton was shot in the lower back through
and through ; A, D. Bryant was shot through
the heart from the rear. : Many point to this
at very damaging to the officers.
The military seem to have complete eon
trol of tbe city, and it it hoped that no
further resort to arms will be made. CoL
Jones, in command ot the militia, Sunday
night issued a proclamation calling upon all
citizens to refrain from assembling in the
neighborhood of the jail, and requesting
them not to assemble in crowds anywhere in
the city. He invokes the aid ot all good citi
zens to assist the authorities in allaying the
excitement, and preserve peace and good
order.
A similar proclamation has been issued by
Mayor Thompson who calls upon all law
abiding citixans to "put aside their private
grievances and guard with loyalty
the public peace, and maintain the law and
order of our city."
A report reached the city during Sunday
evening that bands ot miners were prepar
ing to march on the city to renew the attack
upon the jail Col. Jones believes, however,
that his force is sufficiently strong to resist
any such movement.

amble and resolutions were adopted reciting

vice promises of the party; all civil service
reform associations are urged to take, such
action as will keep their principle constantly
