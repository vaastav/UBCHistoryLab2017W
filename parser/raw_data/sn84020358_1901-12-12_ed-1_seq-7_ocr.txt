CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.
George N. "Wallace's Resolutions for
Municipal Ownership Rejected Other
Business. . ' .
There was an unusually good attend
ance at the regular meeting, of the
Chamber of Commerce last night. The
principal matter for consideration was
George M. Wallace's motion concerning
municipal ownership of gas plants, wa
ter works, street railroads, telephones,
etc. This matter was presented to the
Chamber last June and then referred to
the executive committee, which com
'mlttee reported against the adoption of
any of the resolutions At last night's
meeting the report of the committee
was accepted and there was a debate
on the matter of adoption. Mr. Wal
lace, who has undoubtedly Investigated
the subject very thoroughly, was the
first and principal speaker He cited
much data giving (the experience of
many other , cities in the .world who
have municipal 'ownership of publlp
utilities. There contained many on
vlnclng proofs of his contention' and
Mr. Wallace was gltfen k the closest of
attention by all present.
.Hon. C. S. Hamilton stated that if
any fault was to be found with charges
for service by any of the companies
that he favored an attack on that spe
cific matted and not on "aft companies
In this wholesale manner. He favored
adopting the executive committee's re
port.
William Trueman was the next
speaker. He favored Mr. Wallace's res
olutioh and said that he considered It
the ally practical way to settle the
question of too much taxation.
' Henry H. Newton was another speak
er and he favored the adoption of the
resolutions in a modified state. He con
sidered them too broad in scope to be
dealt with in their entirety.
A formal vote was taken on the adop
tion of the resolutions, and they were
rejected by a vote of 16 to 9.
Hon. J.i D. Dewell reported for the
legislative committer to which Was re
ferred the matter of proposed changes
in the bankruptcy law. Upon his sug
gestion the Chamber voted to invite
Referee Newton of the colal United
States bankruptcy court to read a pa
per on the subject at the next meet
ing.
The invitation to become a member
of the National Board of Trade was re
spectfully declined. To the committee
on legislation was referred the proposed
petition to congress for the repeal of
the 15 per cent, ad valorem duty on
hides imported into this country.
The following gentlemen were elected
members of the Chamber: John C.
Clarke, J. Wilder Howe, W. F. Merrill,

j The Kind You Have
Always Bought
Bears the
Signature
of
On Alaska by Dr. Jackson, Renowned
Missionary.
Dr. Sheldon Jackson, the superintend
ent of education for Alaska, who was
in this city yesterday and addressed th8
meeting of the New Haven Indian asso
ciation, is a figure of no little interest.
First as a missionary to the natives and
later as a government official, he has
spent well-nigh a generation In Alaska,
and there is probably no one living who
is better informed with regard to that
whole country than he is. Years before
some of those who are now regarded as
! Alaskan pioneers ever heard of that
part of the world Dr. Jackson was al
ready "roughing it" in the wildest parts
of Alaska. He divided his time pretty
impartially between the bleak sub-Arctic
section, where neither tree nor shrub
, is found, and the more accessible south
ern section in whose moist and compar
atively warm climate vegetation be
comes almost tropical in its luxuriance.
Dr. Jackson walked over the bleak
shores at Nome years before gold was
discovered there. Last summer he was
there again and found a city of 12,000
people, with its miners taking out gold
dust at the rate of a million dollars ft
month. A Norwegian reindeer herder
whom the doctor hired in 189S and
brought to this country to help take
care of the government reindeer, at a
salary of twenty-six dollars a month, Is
now a millionaire, all in gold from
Nome. i
Dr. Jackson la not only pre-eminent
for his general knowledge of Alaska,
but he Is also an enthusiastic believer
In its future. He says the resources of
that wonderful country have thus far
been barely touched, and that the world
will yet be astounded by the revelations
of its natural wealth, not only In go'd
and copper and coal, but also In Its fish
eries and In the valuable timber tracts
of the southeastern sections.
The salmon pack of the Alaska can
neries this year Is in Itself valued at
$8,000,000, or more than the United
States paid for the whole country at
the time that Secretary Seward was
reproached for paying Russia $7,200,000
for "a worthless, Godforsaken waste."
Dr. Jackson says that what Alaska
needs now is carefully considered leg
islation and more corporations and syn
dicates that will go in to build it up.
In this connection he pays a compli
ment to the New Haven men who are
members of the Kaasan Bay Mining
company, whose record in Alaska he is
familiar with and the character of
whose work he commends very heartily.
He says the Kaasan Bay company has
gone into Alaska with the evident In
tention of building up the Interests of
the country as well as its own. i
Dr. Jackson also spoke of the Plmas
tribe in New Mexico. Up to a short .
time ago they were entirely independ- I
ent, requiring no assistance. Recently,
however, their territory has been in
vaded by the white man and their sup
ply of water cut off. Over eight thou
sand of them are starving and are In a
deplorable condition. This would all be
changed and they could again care for
themselves If the government would
only appropriate enough money for the,
completion of the San Carlo dam.
The lecture was extremely Interesting
and Instructive to all, especially those
of the local Indian assoc'ation, who
give considerable time and attention to
the work of carrying the message of
Christ to the inhabitants of this far
away country.
Dr. Jackson's friend and associate,
Governor John G. Brady, is a Tale
graduate of 1874 and well' remembered
here.
N. J., will preach in the Congregational
church at both services Sunday In ex
change with Professor Stevens. It is
understood that Mr. Jones comes here
with reference to a possible call to the
pastorate of the church in case that
step Bhould become mutually agreeable
to him and the church. It Is probable,
and desirable, that there 'will be a large
congregation present.
The announcement of the marriage of
John A. Martin and Miss Genevieve
Persian! on December 10 was sent out
yesterday. They will be "at home" af

The friends of Miss May Allen, who
was stricken blind while in her class
room at Mt. Holyoke seminary, the first
part of last week, will be greatly pleas
ed at hearing of her recovering it to a
certani extent. It came back to her
Tuesday night. She has been under the
j treatment of Dr. Swain pf New Haven
and was totally blind up to Tuesday
night. The attack was a sudden one
and was brought on by nervous trou
ble. . -
George Gardner will hereafter have

I Rev. J. E. Wildman went to New Ha

Swain about the ti-ouble with his ear,
from which he has been suffering for
some time. Dr. Swain removed a
! growth from hla ear which caused de
cided relief.

Yesterday morning's fire was at least
two miles from the nearest hydrant,

M.-Steinert & Sons, 777 Chapel St.
There was quite a fire here Wed
nesday morning over In the Street
Jones estate property in which there
was a loss of live stock, hay, etc., be
sides a large barn.
The fire was at the property rented
by Charles E. Anthony which belongs
to the Street Jones estate, and is situ
ated over on the road about a quarter
of a mile west of the main turnpike
and west of the house where Albert
Jones and his mother reside.
The alarm of fire was given in the
borough, the first gong being blown at
3:35 yesterday morning. The barn with
its contents was entirely destroyed.
There were in the barn seventeen
cows, one bull, a pair of horses, sixty
tons of hay, twenty tons of unthreshed
rye straw, 3,000 pounds of leaf to
bacco In cases, wagons, farming uten
sils and a set of double . harnesses,
which were totally destroyed.
The barn when built and later on
with, the addition cost $4,000. The barn
was 60x120 feet.
The live stock belonged to Willis W,
Cook of Mt. Carmel, having been pur
chased by Anthony on a conditional
sale. The contents of the barn belonged
to Mrs. Anthony.
The barn was Insured for $750 in the
National and the contents of the barn
were insured for $1,500 In the Wind
ham. There was no insurance on the
Cook property.
Mr. Anthony, who is In the milk bus
iness, said that the last time he was in
the barn was at 8:30 Tuesday night and
that the milk was kept in the other
barn, a few feet south of the one de
stroyed. He left the milk barn at about
2:30 and started in to the borough to
deliver milk.
When he left home there was no
sign of a fire. When delivering the
milk he learned of the fire and drove
back home, where with the assistance
of Willis Rose and son they were able
to save the milk barn,, although the
north end was somewhat burned. The
south barn was saved though having
lots of water In it.
The loss will be upwards of $7,000
or $8,000. The cause of the fire is un
known. There was a fire some twenty
years ago on the same site in which a
barn with a large number of live stock
was destroyed.
Rev. J, Owen Jones of Bound Brook,
Threatened to Shoot Her Because
Married Against His Will.
Henry J. Brooks, a man who is living
this winter with his family at No. 504
Orchard street, was arrested last night
by Patrolmen Cooper and Byxbee on
the charge of breach of ithe peace, said
to consist in attempting.ito prevent his
daughter from getting married.
It seems that early In the fall a band
of gypsies camped at Hie outer end of
Goffo street and Included in the band
were the leader, a man named Wil
liams, and the Brooks family, consist
ing of father, mother and daughter.
Chief Williams had a spn, who was In
love with the Brooks' daughter. As
the season grew colder the band sepa
rated, the various members finding
quarters for the winter. ; The Brooks
family settled on Orchard street and
Chief Williams and his son on Hamil
ton street.
Young Williams and , the Brooks
daughter, were engaged,. but the elder
Brooks strongly objected., Nevertheless
the young, couple had arranged to be
married last night and , the wedding
took place, being approved by the
bride's mother. The bride's father,
Brooks, was displeased, however, and
while the wedding was going on he re
paired to nearby saloons and drank
copiously. Having thus fortified his
courage he returned to his home with a
revolver and waving the gun he stated
that he Intended to shoot his daughter
who had Just been married and her
mother, his wife, who had countenanced
the marriage. Before he could carry
out his threats he was arrested by the

wer convention of 1850, an dfor this rea
son would be of untold value to the
country.
He admitted that the new treaty re
tains the general principle of neutrali
zation, as did the original Hay-Paun-cefote
treaty, but he urged that It does
not re-enact or keep alive any of the
provisions of the treaty of 1850. All
natlonB would be treated on terms of
fairness and equality by allowing all
to use the canal in time of peace and
shutting out all in time of war in case
it should be found desirable to do so
In short, Senator Cullom urged that
there Is no provision In the pending
convention which would lnterfeie with
our right as a nation to close up the
waterway to any belligerent power. He
contended, thatthe provision in regard
to the policing of the canal, applies only
to Its control In times of peace and not
In time of war.
Referring to the fourth article of 'the
treaty, which was not contained in the
old treaty, Senator Cullom held that
the provision relating to the change of
sovereignty would make no difference
In the conditions - as the same rule
would apply to the sovereignty of the
country traversed hit the canal should
come to the United States. Under that
Improbable condition the canal could be
closed in case of war, Just as it could
bo in case the sovereignty should re
main where it now is, as the senator
predicted it would remain. In this con
nection he quoted from President
Roosevelt's message saying that the
United States Is not seeking to extend
its borders and addlng that the chances
were ten to one that this country would
not seek to secure new territory In that
direction. As a matter of fact, he said,
the people do not want more territory
than we now have, but are content to
leave the boundaries as they at present
exist.
ATTACK ON CANAL TREATY.
(Continued from First Page.)
traversed by the before mentioned
canal shall affect the general principle
of neutralization or the obligation of
the high contracting parties under the
present treaty."
The effect of this provision, he said,
was Inevitable' to surrender control of
the canal belt in case the ownership of
the soil embraced in it should pass to
the United States. He pointed out
that this restriction had not been in
corporated in the first treaty and said
u was entirety out 01 yiace in Tne re
vised agreement.
Senator Cullom congratulated the
senate and the country upon the fact
that there are two things in connec
tion with the new treaty upon which, he
said, practically all are agreed. One
of these was the desirability of the su
percesslon of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty and the other that of the neces
sity for the constructoin of an isthmian
canal.
He contended that the new treaty
radically changes the conditions pre
sented by the first Hay-Pauncefote
treaty, clearly relieving it of the neces
sity of such an amendment as that
made to the old treaty upon the sug
gestion of Senator Davis, because the
treaty Itself would permit the United
States under international law to own,
manage and defend the canal in any
way that it may choose. In other
words, he added, In a war -with Great
Britain or with any other power the
treaty would bs suspender under the
law which governs nations, until the
war should ba concluded, vWien it wutiid
be revived and again enforced. He
dwelt upon the fact, which he said, was
the most important circumstance to be
considered, tha tthe new treaty super
sedes and abrogates the Clayton-Rul-

Budapest, Dec. ll. Replying in the
Hungarian Diet to-day to a demand
that the shipment of horses from Hun
gary to South Africa be topped, on the
ground that it constituted a violation
of Hungarian neutrality, the premier,
Koloman de Szell, declared that the
question whether, in international
law, horses were regarded as war ma
terial, and that to supply them consti
tute a violation of neutrality, had never
yet been decided, hence the government
had not stopped and did not intend to
stop the traffic. While fully sympa
thizing wlth the Boers, said the pre
mier, the questioner ought to have real
ized the impropriety of abusing the
British, who, in difficult times, had
shown their sympathy for Hungary.
The British .nation, he added, deserved
Hungary's esteem. The premier's
statement was approved by the major
ity of the house.
