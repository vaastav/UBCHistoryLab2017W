Incident occurring in the progress of our
civil war hve forced up"n my attention tbe un
certain eute of international questions touching
the riglts of freemen in thta country, and of
United Slate Citizens abroad. In regard to
orjie givernmcnti thec right are at legist
partiallly defineil by treaty. In no instance,
however, is it expressly sKpuUted that in the
instance of civil- war a foreigner residing
in this country, within the lines of the insurgents,
is t't te exempted from the rule which classes
him as a belligerent in whose behalf the govern
ment of his couutry cannot expreß auy privilege
or immunity from that character. I regret to
ay, however, that auch claim have been put
forward, and, in some instance, in behalf of for
eigners who have lived in tbe United States the
greater part of their lives. There is reason to
believe that many pcrsoiia born in foreign coun
tries, wlm have dtclaml their intention, to be
come ritixens. or who have been fully naturalized,
hvt evade! the military duty required of them
by denying the fact and throwing upon the (lov

hlhcult or üaracticabie to obtain this proof,
from the wmit f goi les to the proper sources of

to send periolical v lists of the name! of petNons

I again submit to your consideration the ex

co'jrgement of emigr tion. Although thi source
of national wealth ia again following with greater
freedom than for cveral vears before the insur
rection occurred, there is ftiil a great deficiency
of latiorera in every field of industry, especially
in agriculture and in our mines, as well as of iron
and coal as of frecious metal. While demand
for labor ia thus increased here, tens of thousands
of persons, destitute of remunerative occupation, j
are thronging our foreign Consulates and offering
to emigrate to the United Sutcs if essential but
very chesp assistance can be afforded to them.
It I easy to see that under the aharp discipline of
civil war. the nttion is beginning a new life

Injuries unforeseen by the Government and
unintended may in some cases have been in
flicted upon the eubjecta or citizens of foreign
countries, both at sea and on land, by persons in
the rervice of tbe United btAtes. As this Gov
ernmcnt expects redres from other powera when
similar injuries are inflicted bv persons in their
service upon citizens of the United States, we
mu3t be prepared to do justice to foreigners. If
the existing judicial tribunals are inadequate to
this purpore, a special court may be authorized,
with power to hear and decide such
claims of the character referred to as
may have arisen under treaties and public law.
Conventions for adjusting claims by your com
mission have bceu prot6ed to some governments,
but no definite answer to these propositions has
ytt been received from auy. In course of the
session, I shall probably have occasion to request
you to provide indemnification to claimants. De
crees of restitution have been rendered and dama
ges awarded by the Admiralty Court, and in
other cases where this Government may be ac
knowledges! to bo liable in principle ind where
the amount of that liability has been
ascertained by an informal arbitration.
TAXl.NO rOEEiGN CONSULS.
The proper officers of the Treasury havedeemed
themselve-s required by the law of the United
States upon the subject to demand a tax upon
the incomes of foreign C-wisuls in this country .
While such ademand may not bean indication
of public law or perhaps, of any existing treaty
between the Unite! States aud a foreign country,
the expediency of io far tnodifykig the act as to
exempt from tax the income of such Consuls as
are not citizens of the United States, derived
from the emoluments of their office, or from
property not .situated in tbe United States, is sub
mitted to your generous consideration. I make
this suggej-tion upon the ground that a comity
which ought tobe reciprocated exempts our Con
suls in nil other countries from taxation. To
the extent thus indicated the United States, I
thiuk, ought not to be exceptionally illiberal
to international trade and commerce.
THE NATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM.
The operations of the Treasury during the
last year have been successfully conducted.
The enactment by Congress of a national
banking law his proved a valuable support to
the public credit, and the general legislation in
relation to loans has fully answered the expecta
tions of its favorers. Some amendments may be
requried to perfect existing laws, but no change
in their principles, or general scope, is believed to
be needed. Since these measures have been iu
operation all demands on the treasury, including
the pay of the army and navy hive been prompt
ly met and fully satisfied. No considerable body
of troopa, it is believed, were ever more amply
provided, mere liberally and punctually paid,
and it may be added that by no people were the
bürden incident to a great war more cheer
fully borne.
CONDITIO OF THE TÄEASCRT.
The receipts during the year from all
sources, including the loans and the balance in the
Treasury at lis commencement were $901 ,125,
C74 b6. The aggregate disbursements. $S'J5,
7,G3() C5, leaving a balance on the 7th of Ju
ly. Ifb3, of $532,90-1.421. Of the receipts,
there were derired from cutom. $&) ,U59,f-12 40;
from internal revenue, $37,6 10,767 U5; from tli
rect taxes. $14,510.301; from land. $167,-
Cl 7 17; from miscellaneous sources, $301,661,

the aggregate of $y01,112,Gl"S fG. Of the dis
bursemcnt., there were $233 ,539 ,222 for peu
sions. iic : $421,652,059 for interest on public
debt; $247.21)? ,465 01 for war depa-tment;
$5!1).23.600 Kl for the navy department; $632,
410,507 for the pivment of fundel and temp )
rriry debt; making an aggregate of $;85,766,
630 55, and leaving a balance of $538,904.421
Hut tbe payment of the fundel ami temporatj
debt having been made from moneys borrowed
during the year, must be regarded as merely
nominal payments, aud tlie monies borrowed to
make them a merely nominal receipts; and their
amount, $15!, 0-6,635 .07, should therefore be
deducted from tlie receipts and disbursements.
Tbis being done, there remains as actual receipts
$71 1,709.995 5? leaving the balance as already
stated. The nctual receipts and disbursements
for tlie first quarter and the estimated receipts
and disbursement for the remaining three
quarters of the current fiscal year of lt64, will be
rhown in detail by the reports, of the Secretary
ol the Treasury to which I invite your
attention. It is sufficient to say here, that it is
not believed that ihe actual results will exhibit a
slate of tbe figures lew formidable to the country
thaw the estimates of that officer heretofore sub
muted, while it is confidently expected that ;it the
close of the yetr both disbursements and debts
will he found very considerably lessi than has been
anticipated.

rivers. A naval farce has been created on these

performances of the heroc men of the navj, at
this period they are crceT mure wonderful than
the ferviccs of our mechanics od artizans in the

new form of naval power. Ourcocatry has ad
vantages superior to any other nation, in our re
sources of iron and timber, with inexhaustible
quantities of fuel in the immediate vicinity of
both, and all accessible in and in close proximitr
to navigable waters, without the advantage of
public rUks. The resources of the nation ha?e
been developed and its power displayed in the
construction of a navy of such magnitude, which
has at the very period of its creation rendered
signal service to the Union. The increase of the
number of seamen in the public service from
7,000 men in the spring of lfc61 to about 24,000
at the present time, has been accomplished with
out especial legislation or extraordinary bounties
to promote that increase. It has been found,
however, that tbe operations of tlie draft, with
tbe high bounties paid for army recruits, is be
ginning to affect ungenerously tbe naral service,
aud will, if not corrected, be likely to impair its
efficiency bj detaching" peamen from their proper
avocation and inducing them to enter
tbe army I therefore respectfully eug-
re-t that Congress misht aid both the
army aia! naval service by adequate provision on
tbe subject, should at the same time be equable
to the communities more especially interested.
I comment to your consideration the suggestions
of the Secretary of the Navy in regard to the
policv of fostering and training reamen for naval
service. The Naval Academy is rendering ?igr
nal service in prepariug Mi ithipmen for highly
responsible duties, which in alter life they will be
required to perform, in order that the country
should not be dec rived of the proper quota of ed
ueatcd officers for which leg il provision has been
made at the Naval School The vacancies caused
by the neglect or omiss-ion to make nomination
from the States in insurrection have been filled
by the Secretary of the Navy. The School is
now more full and complete than at any previous
period, and in every respect entitled to the fa
vorable consideration of Congress.
POSTAL AFFAIRS.
During the past fiscal year, the financial condi
tion of the Poet OfHce Department has been ono
of increased prosperity, and I am gratified in be
ing sible to state that the receipt of postal reven
ue has nearly equalled the entire expenditure;
the latter amounting to $1 1, 314,000. t4 and the
former to $11,163,781) 59 leivinga deficiency of
but $250 417.25 In lf?60, the year immediate
preceding the rebellion, the deficiency amounted
to $565,1)70.549. The postage receipts of that
year were $264,52,219 less than those of lb63.
The decrease since 1660, in the annual
amount of transportation, has been only about
25 per cent", but the annual expenditures on ac
count of the same has been reduced 35 percent.
It is manifest, therefore, that the Postollic De
partment may become self sustaining in a few
yeirs.even with the restoration of the whole ser
vice. The international conference of Postal
delegates from tho principal countries of Europe
and America, which was called at the suggestion
of the Postmaster General, met at Paris on the
11th of May last, and concluded its deliberations
on the ?Uh of June. The principles established
by the conference, as best adapted to facilitate
postal intercourse between nations, and as the
basis of future conventions to inaugurate a gen
eral system of uniform international charges at
reduced rates of postage cannot fail to produce
beneficial results.
RfronT or the secretary or the interioe.
I refer you to the report of the Secretary of
the Interior, which is herewith laid before you,
for the useful and varied information in relation
to the public lands, Indian affairs, patents, pen
sions and other matters of public concern, per
taining to this department. The quantity of
lands disposed of during the last and the first
quarters of tbe present fiscal year was three mil
lion eight hundred and fifty one thousand five
hundred and fifty-nine acres, of which one hun
dred and sixty one thousand nine hundred and
eleven acres wereßold forcash; one million four
hundred and fisty-six thousand five hundred and
fourteen acres were takeu up under the Home
Stead law and the residue disposed of under laws
granting lands for military bounties, for railroads
and other purposes. It also appears that
the sale of public lands .is largely in
the increase. It has long been a
cherished opinion of some of our widest states
men that the people of the Utates States had a
higher und mere enduring interest in the early
settlement aud substantial cultivation of the pub
lic lands than in the amount of direct revenue to
be derived from the sale of them. This opinion
has had a controling influence in shaping legis
lation upon the subject of our national domain. I
may cite a an instance of this the liberal measures
adopted iu reference to actual settlers, the grant
to the Stales of the overflowed lands within their
limits, iu order to their being reclaimed and ren
dered fit for cultivation The graut to railroad
companies ol alternate sections of land upon the
contemplated lines of their road when completed,
will largely multiply the facilities of reaching our
distant possessions. This nolicy has received its
most signal and beneficent illustration ia recent
enactments granting homesteads to actual met
iers. Since the first day of January last the be
fore mentioned quantity of one million four hun
dred and fifty-six thousand five hundrcti and four
teen acres of land has been taken up under its
provision. This fact and the amount of sales
furnib gratifying evidence ol the increasing set
tlement upon the public land?, notwithstanding
the great struggle in which the energies of the
nation have been engaged, and which has re
quired so large a withdrawal of our citizens from
their accustomed pursuits
I cordially concur in the recommendttion ol
the Secretary of the Intcior suggesting a modifi
cation of the act in favor of those engaged in the
military and naval service of the United State.
I doubt not that surveyors will che fully dopt
rtwh measures as will, without essentially chang
ing the general features of the system, secure to
tlie greatest possible extent its benefits to thoe
who have left their homes iu defense of the coun
try in this arduous crisis.

I invite vour attention to the views of the Sec
retary of War as to thesa ropriety of raising, by
appropriation of legislation, a revenue from the
mineral lands of the United States.

When Congress asemb!ed a year ago. the war !
iad alre-my lasted nearlv twenty months, and
had airei'iv lasted nearlv twenty months, and
there had been many conflicts on both land and j
sea with varying results. The rebellion had been j
prcs-ei back into reduced limits; yet ins tone of
public feeling and opinion at home and abroad
was not satisfactory. With other signs, the pop
ular elections, then just past, indicated unei !
ness among ourselves, while amid much that was :
cold and menacing, the kindest words coming i
frnm "Pnfland were uttered in aroenta rf Tiifr i
but we were too blind to surrender. Our com
merce was suffering greatlv by few armed ves
sel built upon and furnished from foreign shores,
and we were threatened with such additions from
the same quarter as would sweep our trade from
the seas and raise our blockade. We had failesi
to elicit from European Governments anything
hopeful upon this subject. The emancipation
proclamation, which was issued in September,
was running its aligned period to the beginning
of the new year. A month later the final proc
lamation came, including the announcement that
colored men of suitable condition would be
received into the war service.
POLICT OK LMANCirATlOX AND EMPLOYMENT OK
NEGI.0 ROLDltM
Tbe policy of emancipation and of
employment of black soldiers, gave to
the future a new aspect, about which
hopes, fears and doubts contended in un
certain conflict, according to our political system,
as a matter of civil administration. The General
Government haa no lawful power to effect eman
cipation in any State, and for a long time it l ad
been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed
without resorting to it as a military measure. It
was all the while deemed possible that necessity
for it might come, and that, if it should, the crisis
of the contest would then be presented. It came,
and, as foreseen, it was followed by dark and
doubtful days. Eleven months having been
passed, we are permitted to take another review.
The rebel borders are pressed etill farther back.
and, by the complete opening of the Mississippi
River, the country dominated over bv the rebel-
ion is divided into distant parts. Practical com
munication between them and Tennessee and
Arkansas has been substantially cleared of in
surgent control and influence: and the citizens in
each, and owners of slaves and advocates of slave
ry at the beginning of the rebellion, now dec-late
openly for emancipation in their respective
States. Of those Slates not included in the
emancipation, Maryland and Miouri (neither of
which, years ago. would tolerate any restraints
upon the extension of slavery into the Territor
ies) only dispute now is as to the best mode
of driving it from their own limits. Of I hose
who were slaves atthe beginning of the rebellion,
fully one hundred thousand are now in the United
States military service, about one-half of which
number actually bear arms in the ranks, thus giv
ing the double advantage of taking so much labor
from the insurgent cause and supplying the places
which otherwise must be tilled with so
many white men. So far as tested, it is difficult
to say they are not as good soldiers as any. No
servile insurrection or tendency to violence or
cruelty has marked the raesure of emancipation
and arming the blacks. These measures have
been much discussed in foreign countries, and
contemporary with such discussions the tone of
the public sentiment there is much improved.
Where the same measures have been fully dis
cussed, supported, criticised and denounced, the
annual elections are highly encouraging to those
whose special duty it is to bear the country
through this great trial. Thus we have the
reckoning; the crisis which threatened to divide
the friends of the country is past.
PLAN FOR RfcCO.VSTRUCTION.
Looking now to the preseut and future
and with reference to a resumption of
the national authority within the States
wherein that authotity has been suspended,
I have thought fit to issue a proclamation, a
copy of which is herewith transmitted. On ex
amination of this proclamation it will appeir, as
is believed, amply justified by the Constitution.
True the form of an oath is gjven, but no man is
coerced to take it. A man is only promised a
pardon in case ho voluntarily takes the oath.
The Constitution authorizes the Executive to
grant it on terms as fully established by judicial
and other authorities. It ia also proffered that if
any of the States name a seat of government it
shall be in the mode prescribed set up. Scch
Government shall be recognized and guaranteed
by the United States, and that un Je;- it the State
shall, on subscribing to the constitutional con
ditions, be protected against invasion and domes
tic violence. The constitutional obligation of the
United States to guarantee to every State in the
Union a republican form of Government and
to protect the State in the caee ks stated,
is explicit and full. But why tender
the benefits of this provision only to a State
government set up in this particular way? This
section of the Constitution contemplates a case
wheiein the element within a State was favora
ble to a repulican government in this Union may
be too leeble for an opposite and hostile element
external to and even within the State, and such
are precisely the cases with which we are now
dealing. Au attempt to guarantee and protect a
revisel stale of trovernmetit, constituted in whole
or in preponderating part from the very element
agninst whose hostility and violence it is to be
protected, is simply absurd Tbere must be a
test by which to separate opposing elements so as
to build only from the sound, and that test a sui--
ficient and liberal one, whi"h accepta ound
whoever will make a sworn recantation of his
former unsoundness, but if it he proper to require
a list of admission to the political body, an oath
of allegiance to the Constitutor of the United
States and to the Union under it, why not also to
the laws and proclamation in reyard to lavery?
Those laws aud prochmation w ete enacted and
put forth for the urjos-e of aiding in the sup
pression of the rebellion. To gi re them the fullest
effect, there hail tobe a pledge for their mahlte-
iw:ice. In ray judgment they have aided and
will further aid the cause for which they weie
enlisted. To give up this principle would be not
only to relinquish a lever of power, but it would
also be a cruel and astounding breach of faith. I
may add at this point that while I remtin in my
present positiou 1 sdiall not attempt to retrsct or
modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall
I return to slavery any person who i made free
by the terms 'of the proclamation or by art of
Coiigies. For thce and other reason it is thought
fest that the support Of theae rMns sh ill te
im lüde! in the oith, and it i believed the Ex
ecutive may lawfully claim it In retnrn for pardon

which may be aceer.ted y them as a rallyW-f ,

jection to a premature presentation of a plan by
the National Executive consists in th danger of
comtntttance ia point which coa!d be more safely
left to further developments Care ha been
taken to so shape the document as to avoid em
barrawment from this source. In saying that oa
certain terms certain classes will be pardoned,
with their rights restored, it is not sail that other
classes on other terms will never be included.
In saying that a reconstruction will be accepted
if presented in a specified. way, it is not said that
it will never 1? accepted in any other way. The
movement by State actions for emancipations in
several of the States not included in the em mci
pation proclamation. are tntters of profound
gratulation; and while I do not repeit in detail
what I have heretofore o earnest! v urged upon
this subject, my general views and
feelings remain unchanged, atd I trust
that Congress will omit no fair oppor-
tur.ity of aiding these important steps to the great
consummation.
the Wax power the main reliance. .
In the midst of other care, however
Important, we must r.ot lose sight of the
fact that tbe war power is still our main
reliance. To that power alone can we look, yet
for a time, to give confidence to the people in
contested regions that the insurgent power will
not again overturn them. Until that confidence
shall be established little can be done anywhere
for what is called reconstruction. Hence our
chiefest care must still be directed to our army
and navy, who have thus far borne their harder
part so noblv and so well, and it may be esteemed
fortunate that in giving the greatest efficiency to
their indispensable arms, we do also honorably
encourage the gallant men, from commander to
sentinel, who compose them, and to whom, more
than all others, the world must stand indebted
for the home of freedom disenthralled, regenera
ted, enlarged and perpetuated.

Whereas, It is now desired by gome persons

and all who have engaged in any way in treating
colored persons or white persons in chnrge of
such otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war,
and which persons may be found in the United
