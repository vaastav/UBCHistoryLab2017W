SIZE! OF THE COTTON CROP.
Experts s-ill dL-agree as to the
size of the cotton crop. Some say
it will go to 10,250,000 tales,
while ethers say it will not exceed
9.250.000. Tne extremes Rre a
million bales apart. Ta'ent rarely
is uuaaimeu, and never so over
the size of a cotton cr p . The
McFaddens of Philade'puia and
other bears will continue to pre
dict a big outcome, but the weight
of opmion is against them.
Takirgone year with another it
is Been that just about one half of
the crop is oiaikt- d tyDo-embir
1, and if we use this as a basis this
year, we find that the crop will
be 9,600,000 bales; and this is as
good an estimate, or raiher calcus
Jation, as can be made at present.
Thcre are some who believe high
prices have hurried the crop to
market, and that over one -half of
it had been marketed by December
1. In 1896 there was marketed at
tne close of November 54.83 per
cent. It is therefore possible tha't
the crop wili not turn out to be
9,600.000 bales. It is best to take
that aggregate as a maximum.
Such a crop is below consump
tion. Ii would be far below con
sumption if the diplomats had not
managed to close China another
year to the cotton goods trade.
There seems to be no limit to the
delays they are able to create. But
even if China be wholly and alto
gether dropped from the problem,
cotton t-hould, and ur.doiib'edly
will, cross the 10-cent mark, and
stay acioss it, until iat least all
can see that a big crop is assured
next year.

It is very trying to au Ameri
can to have the example of the
United States in Asia cited as a
justification of British tyranny
in South Africa.Tais is precisely
what occurred in the discussion
in Parliament, and the fact that
such a thing is possible disarms
American criticism on England's
policy, while it must turn back
attention to the fa!e Dosirion in
which cur own country has been
placed.
We cannot tell how far Timo
thy Healey was justified in say
ing that the conduct of the Brit
ish soldiers in South Africa had
not been "as black as that of the
American troops in the Philip
pines." Probably in neither case
has the actual conduct of the sol
diers been as biack as it had been
painted. American soldiers have
always been credited with snort
conduct everywhere. But accept
ing the phrase in the broader
sense as meaning the general
m'litary policy pursued for , the
sut j igaiion of the inhabitants, it
is very nsarly identical, and not

There's many a big,
healthy looking man
who is weak in the
lungs. Probably half
or two -thirds ot ms
lung surface barely
knows the contact of oxygen. He's the
kind of man, who, when a cough attacks
him, goes galloping down the road
toward consumption. Many such a man
has found strength and healing for weak
lungs and tissues lacerated by coughing
and drained by hemorrhages, in the use
of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discov
ery. The healing power of this medi
cine in pulmonary diseases seems little
short of marvelous at times, so extreme
are the conditions which it cures. The

no narcotics.
"When I started to take your 'Golden Med
ical Discovery,' writes Mr. A. F. Kovotny, of
New York, N. Y., Box 1437. I had a regular
consumptive cough, of which I was afraid, and
everybody cautioned me and warned me con
cerning' it I was losing weight rapidly, was
very pale and had no appetite, whatever. Now
my condition is changed entirely. I do not
cough at all, have gained eight pounds in
weight, have recovered my healthy color, and
my appetite is enormous. I can recommend
your medicine to everybody who may be in need
f the same, as it is a sure cure."

THEAEMYBILLA FAILURE.
In order to expadite the army
reorganization, the bill which
psss;d the Senate at tha last ses
sion was Ti ported with amend
ments in the House and wes pases
ed ia that form. It was intended
that it should then go to a com
miltee of confeieLc?. But the
amendments ara so extensive as to
leave little of the Senate bill be
yocd the enacting cliuse. Tha
Senate cannot recognize its own
child. So the present disposition
of the military comm'ttee of the
Senate is to treat it as a new bill
originating in the House and to
discuss and amond it o that basis.
This is wise. If the Senate
should substitute an entirely new
bill it might be wiser still. It is
not a mere party opinion but a
military fact that the Democratic
proposition lo extend the opera
tions of the present law for two
years would be a great deal better
for the army, as well a-i for the
nation. The Houae bill has noth
ing to recommend it, even to
those "who believe ia army ix

creasing the Presidential patron
age. It is calculated not for the
needs of the army but for the de

better than this it had better do

for the Senate to adopt it. The

Mr. Bryan failed for the sec
ond time to be -elected President,
but defeat did not deprive him
of the power of trenchant critis
cism. In a twelve-huodred-word
analysis of President McKinley'a
tventy-five thousand word mes
sage he has exposed its sophis
try and uumasked the imperial
policy of the present Rapublican
leadership. Wbila the President5
and which even omits trials by
jury,
This demonstration that the
Democrats at Kaasas City we re
absolutely correct in declaring
imperialism to be the param6unt
issue of the campaign is not the
only incisive exposure of the in
defensible nature of the Republi
can policy. We are to have a ship
subsidy bill ostensibly to pro
mote foreign commerce when
our foreign trade has been in
creasing by leaps and bounds,
VZftT
spite of the fact that American
manufactures and the products
of Americaa mines have been
protected lo the point nf exclud
ing foreign products of a similar
nature and the erection of as
high a barrier against foreign
trade as it was possible to raise,
tbe abundance and excellence of
American products have created
a constantly growing demand for
them, aad in face of this it is
now proposed to spend millions
from the public treasury to sub
sidize the ships of a few trans
portation corporations on the
plea of increasing a commerce
which is increasing by the hun
dreds of millions annually from
natural causes.
All the denunciation of Repub
lican imperialism and subservi
ence to the greed-swollen trusts
indulged in by Mr. Bryan during
the campaign be shows to have
ben fui'y justmea by the rec
ommendations of the President
in his message to Congress. Io is
a plea for colonial subjugation,
for the abandonment of the
principle of the consent of the
governed and the return of cam
paign contributions by direct
subsidies from the public treas
ury to the only corporate indus
try not already subsidized.
Mr. Bryan indulges in no vain
regrets over defeat. He recog
rnz?s tha a, rrv j rity of the too
pie voted for imperialism and
the perpetuatfon and extension
of trust domination whether they
were aware of it or not. He
simply points out that all dis
guise had been thrown off since
the election, and the Republican
leaders are proceeding to do just
what ne prophesied they wou'd
do if saccesuful.
