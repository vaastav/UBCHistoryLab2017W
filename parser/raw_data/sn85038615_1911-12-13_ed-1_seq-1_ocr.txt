The committee adhered to the con?

turbing topic before tho committee
?was left as It was four years ago. The
champions of presidential preference
primaries and S'atc-wldc primaries
for the selection of delegates to the
convention In States where primary
laws are not operative were defeated.
They were led by Senntor Horah, of
Idaho, who contented himself with a
minority report from the subcommit?
tee on call, of which ho was chairman,
and with a brief speech to the com?
mittee. The meeting was unique In
two respects: There was a complete
absence of bitterness and the proceed?
ings were conducted with open doors.

In January to begin the work of or?

The wishes of the Taft committee

The expected and long-heralded row
over the primary question proved a
flash in the pan. The following mem?
bers of the committee were appointed
to draft the call: Messrs. Borah, of
Idaho; Kellogg, of Minnesota; Ward,
of New York; Rosewater, of Nebraska,
and Capers, of South Carolina. The
com' ilttee was appointed at tho morn?

in an hour the committee had agreed

objected to tho constitution of the pro?
posed prl>Stt court, pointing out that it
grave the British Empire only the wimc
representation ns that accorded petty
Central American republics. Further?
more,, he said, the bill permitted an
appeal front the British I'rivy Council
to the prize court, but no correspond?
ing nppenl front the United States Su?
preme Court, the representatives of the
United (States having discovered that
under thflr_ Constitution it Is Impos?
sible to carry on appeal from their
Supreme Court to any International
tribunal.
It was therefore possible, Dord Sel
borno argued, to get two sets of con
Hlcllng Judgments.
The naval prize bill pnssed Its third
reading In the. Bouse of Commons on
December 7. but Its rejection by tho
Lords had been predicted.
According to the London Dally Tele?
graph the rejection was determined
upon by the Lords to prevent the gov?
ernment from ratifying the declaration
Of London. This procedure will delay
the passage of tho prize bill for two
years, and the declaration of London
cannot bo ratified until the prize bill
hae received the royal assent.
NOW AMONG LEADERS
United Ii tu ten Mukc? Record fh Speedy
Ilnttlrithlp Construction.
Washington, December 12.?The old
reproach that American battleship?
were so long building that they be
i-itne obsolete by the tlmo they were
commissioned no longer applies. Ac?
cording to Chief Constructor R. M.
Watt, in his annual report, the United
States Is now among the lenders in the
rapidity of battleship construction. Ho
attributes this to the adoption of good
management, which he says means
"knowing exactly what you want to do
and then seeing that It Is done in
tho best and most rapid way." which
might be one way of describing tho
modern system of ''scientific manage-,
nient."
In tho faro of this great reduction
of time in tho construction of naval
vessels thtro has been a similar and
progressive reduction In the cost of
construction. Tbc chief construrtor de?
clares that "lh<- total cost per ton ot
displacement ot battleships recently
built by contract for the United States
Is less than that of previous United
States battleships, and less than that
of similar foreign vessels."

Chicago as a guest of the National
Business Congress, gave out the stale,
mint last night that henceforth his
life will be devoted to the salvation of
the poor, the down-trodden and the
Unfortunate.
Mr. Martin was well known ns a
member of clubs In Now York, Paris
and Rome.
"My mission now is to solvo tho
problem of poverty and banish mis?
ery," said Mr. Martin. "I have tiuit
puzzling my brain to devise ways to
feed and entertain the idle rich, and
shall be content hereafter to be known
as the poor man's friend."
Mr. Sfartln snld he had already taken
up his life's work and declared that

Delhi. IriiUa, December 12.?King
George V. and his consort. Queen Mary,
were to-day proclaimed Emperor and
Empress of India. The culminat.ng
act ot the English monarch's accession
to the throne of his vast Indian domin?
ions took place amid a scene which
for richness of color and magnificence
? ?f decorations probably has never been
surpassed in modern times.
The crowning was followed by an act
of generosity on the King-Emperor's
part, of which a slight hint had already
been given. The Viceroy proclaimed
that the Klng-Empcror was to donate a
larg- sum of money to promote popu?
lar education, and that further hand?
some gifts would be made.
Another important change announced
by Eord Ilnrdlngc was that the seat
of government was In future to bo
transferred from Calcutta to Delhi.
Ilrilllnnt Scene Presented.
The huge amphitheatre which had
been erected In the Durbar camp was
thronged from an early hour. The
bright tissues and sparkling gems of
the many Indian princes and the smart
uniforms of the soldiery contrasted
strongly with the white dresses of the
European women and the sober garb of
civilian ofllclals.
The great feudatory princes and
rulers of India, with the leading
I'.ritish officials, occupied seats of
honor near the- pavilion located In the
centre. Screened from the gar.rt of
the curious by a lattice framework,
a number of mahuranls and other In?
dian ladles of high rank occupied two
sections of the front galleries.
The Interval of waiting was beguiled
by the playing of military music. The
EOldlcrs played a large part In the
Durbar, and a guard of honor com?
posed of !0iV picked" n-.en was drawn
up before the central pavilion. Troops
of every arm surrounded the arena In
a compact mass, and lines of soldiers
extended along the route of this royal
approach. ?

little band of veterans, the survivors
of the armies which had made the
present Durbar possible. lhe old

military formation as they marched
to the privileged place allotted them,
but generally It was Impossible, and

Almost Immediately the vice-regal

drawn by blooded horses, with out?
riders uniformed in scarlet and gold.

Then the bopmlng of an imperial
salute announced the upproach of the
Emp-?ror and Empress. The royal car?
riage drawn by four magnificent
horses was almost hidden from view
by the gaily caparisoned escort. The
Emperor wore a robe of Imperial pur?
ple, a surcoat of purple, with white
satin breeches and silk stockings. Ho
1 was decked with the collars of the
orders of the Garter and the Star of
India, and also with the star of the
latter order. The Imperial crown con?
sisted of a band of diamonds, studded
with large emeralds and sapphires,
with rubles in the centre nnd n cap
of purp'e velvet turned up with ermine.
I The Queen-Empress's dress was of
white satin, embroidered with a de?
sign of roses, thistles and shamrocks,
with a border of lotus flowers. The
St-r of India embroidered the front
of her dress. Hor Majesty's Imperial

Measure Is Vigorously Opposed
by Several Democratic Leaders,
and Eight Republicans Cast
Vote Against It?Fight
Waged Largely Along
Political Lines.
Washington, D. C, December 12.?
The Sherwood service pension bill,
which would add upwards of ?10,000,
000 to the government annual expendi?
tures by granting Increased pensions
to Civil and Mexican War veterans on
(he liasis of length of service, wan
passed by the Mouse to-night, dcBpllc
the determined opposition of many
Democratic leaders. Secretary of the
Interior Fisher had estimated that the
bill would add $75,000,000 to the pen?
sion roll If the 100,000 veterans eligible
tuk?; advantage of the Increased wage.
Light Republicans voted with the
eighty.four Democrats against the I 111.
Speaker Clark voted with the majority
of his party for the hill, and Demo?
cratic Leader Underwood and Fitz?
gerald, of Now York, chairman of
the Appropriations Committee, voted
against it.
The bill now goes to the Senate,
where there Is a disposition to pass
some form of amended service pension
legislation. Senate lenders. however,
will proceed slowly In the considera?
tion of this legislation, and many
House Democrats voted for the meas?
ure In the belief thin the Senate would
not pass It.
The Sherwood hill would establish
the following basis of pensions: For
service for ninety days to six months,
$15 per month; from six to nine months,
$20 per month; from nine months to
one year, $25 per month; more than
one year, (30 per month.
Changes Made In mil.
Two Important changes were mad?
In the Sherwood bill during the all
day buttle over It. A Joint amendment,
by Representatives Hauch, of Indiana,
und Cox. of Ohio, struck out the pro?
vision denying entrance to Federal
soldiers' horn's of veterans recefving
more than $10 a month, and refusing
to State homos Federal aid for the
support of such pensioners.
The redlstrlctlon against the pay?
ment of any pension to a veteran
Whose Income exceeds $1.0on a yenr
was voted out, on tho motion of Rep?
resentative Rucker. of Colorado.
The fight on the 'bill was waged
along political lines to n considerable
extent, and members of earn party
charged the other party with bun?
combe, in "their attitude toward the
old soldiers."
Prominent Democrats attacked the
bill as directly opposed to the Demo?
cratic principles of economy and de
etriictlvc of the plans to reduce the
tariff.
Chairman Fitzgerald, of the Appro?
priations Committee, fought it be
cause of its tremendous draft on
the treasury. Representative Harri?
son, of New York, a leading Demo?
crat on the Ways and Means Com?
mittee, declared that the bill "knocks

Wednesday Club Plans
to Bring Other Stars
Here in Spring.
GRAND OPERA IS
ULTIMATE GOAL
Semi-Annual Seasons Discussed
at Annual Meeting of Club.
Proposition Is to Make Af?
fair of 1912 Greatest in
History of Organi?
zation.
Seventy-five members of the Metro?
politan Grand O;iori chr.rus, ibe Metro?
politan Orchestra. Madame Alma Gluck,
prlma donna of Unit organisation, six
op?-ra stars to he chosen from such
names of Caruso. Rlccardo Martin.
Geraldlne Farrar, Louise Homer and
Madame Schumnn-Holllk, Z'.mbaltst,
the Russian virtuoso, and the famous
Richmond pianist, John Powell, will
be brought hero to augment nnd assist
the chorus of the Wcdnosduy Club In
giving this city next spring the great?
est music festival In Its history.
Such are the plans outlined and en?
thusiastically adopted last night at
the annual meeting of the Wednesday
Club at tho Jefferson Hotel.
Going Afl.er Chorus.
Louis K. Weitzel, organist and choir?
master of the Grace Street Presbyter
Ian Church, and for years the nccom
pantst of the club, was chosen by tho
executive committee to conduct tlio
work of the Richmond chorus, and
w-as Instructed to begin Immediately
the difficult task of organizing and
welding together a singing body of
four or live hundred local voices. Jan?
uary 2 was named ss the night for the
tirsl meeting of the chorus, by which
time all preliminary details will have
been arranged. The hoard ot" gover?
nors will secure immediately a suit
abb; hall fur rehearsals.
According to the plans already
agreed upon, Richmond will be given
next May its first concert, In which
the most celebrated and accomplished
artists of the musical world will ap?
pear. The Wednesday Club will givo
this city grand opera except for the
stage setting and the costuming. Cor?
respondence between President J. G.
Corlcy, of the Wednesday Club, nnd
the directors of the MetropolfTnn Upera
Company disclosed the fact that many
of that famous organization could be
engaged for a local concert at reason?
able rates, as the company can stop
over here either going or returning
from Atlanta.
Wnnl Operatic Music.
When It was found that the week
of opera In Atlanta fell at tho lime ot
the May Festival here, the board of
governors immediately met and re?
commended the adoption of the fol?
lowing resolution:
''Resolved, That In the opinion of
tills board. It is desirable to give,
operntlc music in concert form at the
approaching festivals, and to that end
to organize forthwith a local chorus
and engage a portion Of the Metro?
politan chorus to sing in conjunction
with the local chorus, provided it is
found practical to blend Hie two
choruses."
This resolution was unanimously
adopted, after the fear of some mem?
bers had been allayed that the intro?
duction of the Metropolitan chorus
nnd the singing of operatic music
would result In the dissolution of the
Wednesday Club. The board of gov?
ernors assured the members, however,
that such was not the Intent of the
resolution, and made clear that the
Metropolitan chorus was designed to
augment the Wednesday Club chorus
of 100 or 500 voices.
Radical Action Needed.
Lively discussion was provoked wTien
P sldent Corley suggested that two
festivals he given each year tinder
the nusplces of the Wednesday Club,
a midwinter concert of purely oratorio
music, to bo sting hy the Wednesday
Club chorus, assisted by regular ora?
torio stars and an orchestra (fecus
lomed to play oratorio music, and a
May Festival of grand opera to be
clvcn by the Metropolitan company
In Its entirety, to consraft o the full
performance of two three operas.
Radical as this suggestion seemed, it
was enthusiastically indorsed by IT.
T. Meloney. "the father of the Wed?
nesday Club." In a speech which point?
ed out the need for radical action on
the part of the club to preserve Its
position nnd educational power. He
called this suggestion the eventual so?
lution. Had it not been demonstrated
that Richmond hns no auditorium with
a stage suited to the production of
grand opera, it is probable that Iii?
club would have, adopted the seml-an
nunl festival plnn.lnst night. As It
stood, conviction was expressed thai
within the year, the Wednesday Club
must mnke arrangements to give
Richmond a season of grand opera.
With Atlanta. Washington, Philadel?
phia. Roston and many smaller cities
having their seasons of Metropolitan
opera, It was agreed that Richmond
demanded and would shortly get a
similar operatic festival. The progres?
sives In the club say that If grand
opera Is to come here. It should come
under the auspices of the Wednesday
Club, nnd from the enthusiasm shown
on the subject last night, it seems cer?
tain that such will shortly be the
case. \.
Iteal Opern Stars.
Immediately after the adoption hy
the club of the resolution concerning
the Metropolitan chorus, President
Corley announced that the services
of the Metropolitan Orchestra had been
bttl?ffled for the coming festival.
Madame Alma Gluck, whose wonder?
ful voice captured th/1 hearts of those,
who heard her at th'n last festival, has
also been engaged, Mr. Corley stated.
In addition, five of the shining lights
of the New York opera are to be sign?
ed up, as soon as possible. The se?
lection Is to be made from the stars

few hundred yards away.

Amendment* Killed.
By .adoption of nmendmetits offered
by Mr, Don Leuvy, ihe Hoard eliminated
from control of the proposed adminis?
trative, board the KIre, Police and
Health Departments, which, under the
original committee plnn adopted by tho
Aldermen, will continue as heretofore.
The amendments bring the paper back;
to Just what was originally recommend?
ed t.i the Council, other amendments
proposing submission of the matter to
popular vote, and the appointment In?
stead of election of members of tha
proposed board, being rejected.
President Peters suid that as soon
as the smoke had cleured away a little
a special meeting of the Common Coun?
cil would be. called, probably for next
.Monday night, to take up the question
of concurrence In the administrative
board ordinance as amended by tho
Aldermen. The four-word rcdlstrlct
ing ordinance goes to the Mayor for
his iinnl signature as soon as it Is enn
grossed.
Voic Wildly Cheered.
Every member of the Board of AH
tlermen was In his scat when President
Whittct's gavel fell last night, and
more than .100 people were standing
In the limited public space within the
chamber, while outside the corridors
j and staircases were packed with cit?
izens, waiting eagerly for news ul
better and progressive, government.
Applause rang frequently through
the house, and was echoed oack from
tho halls, spectators being apparently
In favor of tho whole ordinance as it
came from the Council and shorvlng
no approval when the vote wus an?
nounced eliminating the Fire. Police)
and Health Departments. The fca<
was expressed that this move would
result In a deadlock In the two
branches and the delays that could
only spell defeat. Leading advocates
of the plan, however, Including mem?
bers of the special committee which
drafted It and of tho commercial or?
ganization* which have given it such
unanimous and hearty support, predict
that hot less than thirty Councilman
will come out for the Administrativ?
Hoard, now that the Police, Flro and
Health Departments have been ox*
eluded.
K?mest and open canvassing for
votes went on throughout the cham?
ber both before the meeting and dur?
ing the reading of the minutes and
other preliminaries. A quick poll
showed only eleven Aldermen who
would certainly vole for the Adminis?
trative Hoard with the I'.lrschborff
amendments, and it was considered
dangerous to force the Issue on that
vote, although Mr. Ilohson, Colonel
Orundy and others fought hard to tho
last for a clear-cut vote for the whole
proposition Just as it came from tha
lower branch.
Pour Word Pinn First.
The redist riding ordinance came tu?
first, and Its reading was dispensed
with. It was reported, as a substitute
for a tlvn ward paper ortet ed by Coun?
cilman Ratcllffo last February, ha
having been the first to propose the
reduction of the Council by cutting
down the number of wards. It was
jocalled that there was open laughter
in tho body when the paper was tlrst
offered, the campaign of education of
the past ten months having produced
wonderful results.
Mr. Don Leavy. for the advocate"
of tho ordinance, stated that It w?<
so evident that a reduction was ne?
cessary and since redistrlctlng tvaa
tho plain duty of the Council the pm
per would be submitted to a.-vote with,
out argument, unless the opposition
raised .questions which needed to ba
answered. The argument was brief*
