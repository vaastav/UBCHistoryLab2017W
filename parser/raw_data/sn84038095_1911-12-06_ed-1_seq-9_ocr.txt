MESSAGE OF
THE PRESIDENT
Mr. Taft Champions Anti-Trust Stat
ute—Net Repeal or Amendment
but Supplemental Legislation
NEW REMEDIES ARE SUGGESTED
Tobacco Trust Decision An- Effective
One—Federal Incorporation
Is Recommended.
To toe Senate and House of Repre
I sentatives:
I This message Is the first of several
jwhlch 1 shall send to congress during
the interval between the opening of
Its regular session and its adjourn
ment for the Christmas holidays. The
amount of information to be commu
nicated as to the operations of the
government, the number of important
subjects calling for comment by tbe
executive and tbe transmission to con
gress of exhaustive reports of special
commissions make it impossible to In
clude in one message of a reasonable
length a discussion of the topics that
ought to be brought to tbe attention
of the national legislature at its first
regular session.
The Anti-trust Law—The Supreme
Court Decisions.
In May last the supreme court band
ed down decisions in tbe suits in equi
ty brought by the United States to en
joui tbe further maintenance of the
Standard Oil trust and of the Ameri
can Tobacco trust and to secure their
dissolution. The decisions are epoch
making and serve to advise the busi
ness world authoritatively of tbe
•cope and operation of tbe anti-trust
act of 1890. Tbe decisions do not de
part In any substantial way from tbe
previous decisions of the court in con
struing and applying this .important
statute, but they clarify those deci
sions by further defining tbe already
admitted exceptions to tbe literal con
struction of the act. By tbe decrees
they furnish a useful precedent as to
the proper method of dealing with the
capita] and property of illegal trusts.
These decisions suggest the. neeQ.pnd
wisdom of additional or supplement
legislation to make it easier for the
entire business community to square
with the rule of action and legality
thus finally established and to pre
serve tbe benefit, freedom and spur of
reasonable competition without loss of
real efficiency or progress.
No Change In the Rule of Decision,
I Merely In Its Form of Expression.
The statute in its first section de
clares to be illegal "every contract,
combination in the form of trust or
otherwise or conspiracy in restraint
of trade or commerce among tbe sev
eral states or with foreign nations"
and in tbe second declares guilty of a
misdemeanor "every person who shall
,monopolize or attempt to monopolize
or combine or conspire with any other
person to monopolize any part of the
trade or commerce of tbe several states
or with foreign nations."
In two early cases, where the statute
was Invoked to enjoin a transporta
tion rate agreement between Inter
state railroad companies, it was held
that it was no defense to show that
the agreement as to rates complained
of was reasonable at common law, be
,cause it was said that the statute was
'directed against all contracts and com
binations in restraint of trade, whether
•reasonable at common low or not It
was plain from tbe record, however,
'that the contracts complained of in
those cases would not have been derai
led reasonable at common law. In sub
Isequent cases tbe court said that tbe
statute should be given a reasonable
'construction and refused to include
within Its inhibition certain contrac
tual restraints of trade which it de
nominated as Incidental or as Indirect.
These cases of restrant of trade that
the court excepted from the operation
of the statute were instances which
at common law would have been call
ed reasonable. In the Standard Oil
and tobacco cases, therefore, the court
merely adopted tbe tests of the com
mon law and in defining exceptions to
tbe literal application of tbe statute
only substituted for tbe test of being
incidental or indirect that of being
reasonable. and this without varying
In the slightest tbe actual scope and
effect of the statute. In other words,
all tbe cases under tbe statute wbicb
have now been decided would have
been decided the same way if the
court had originally accepted in its
construction tbe rule at common law.
It has been said that the court by in
troducing Into tbe construction of tbe
statute common law distinctions has
emasculated it This is obviously un
true. By its judgment every contract
and combination in restraint of inter
state trade made with the purpose or
necessary effect of controlling prices
by stifling competition or of establish
ing in whole or in part a monopoly of
such trade is condemned by the stat
ute. Tfie most extreme critics cannot
jlnstance a case that ought to be con
demned under tbe statute wbicb is not
'brought within Its terms as thus con
St rued
The suggestion is also made that tht
isnpreme court by. its decision in the
tvvr-v
last two cases nas i-omiiMttf'i
,J
court the undefined and
cretion to determine whct'if- a '-!c '1
restraint of trade is withm rhc term*
of the statute This is wi:ol!y iiKtrue
A reasonable restraint of com
mon law is well understood and Is
clearly defined, 't does not rest in the
discretion of the court. It unist be
limited to accomplish the purpose of a
lawful main contract to which in order
that it shall be enforceable at all it
must be incidental. If it exceed the
needs of that contract it is void.
The test of reasonableness was never
applied by the court at eomman law
to contracts or combinations or con
spiracies in restraint of trade whose
purpose was or whose necessary effect
would be to stifle competition, to con
trol prices or establish monopolies.
The courts never assumed power to
say that such contracts or combina
tions or conspiracies might be lawful
if tbe parties to them were only mod
erate in the use of the power thus se
cured and did not exact from tbe pub
lic too great and exorbitant prices. It
is true that many theorists and others
engaged in business violating tbe stat
ute have hoped that some such line
could be drawn by courts, but no court
of authority has ever attempted it
Certainly there is nothing in the deci
sions of the latest two cases from
wbicb such a dangerous theory of ju
dicial discretion in enforcing this stat
ute can derive tbe slightest sanction.
Force and Effectiveness of 8tstuts a
Matter of Growth.
We have been twenty-one years mak
ing this statute effective for the pur
poses for which it was enacted. The
Knight case was discouraging and
seemed to remit to the states the whole
available power to attack and suppress
tbe evils of the trusts. Slowly, howev
er, the error of that judgment was cor
rected, and only in the last three or
four years has the heavy hand of tbe
law been laid upon the great illegal
combinations that have exercised such
an absolute dominion over many of our
industries. Criminal prosecutions have
been brought, and a number are pend
ing, but juries have felt averse to con
victing for jail sentences and judges
have been most reluctant to impose
such--sentences
on men of respectable
fr'Hku'nding In society whose offense has
been regarded as merely statutory.
Still, as the offense becomes better un
derstood and tbe committing of it par
takes more of studied and deliberate
defiance of the law we can be confi
dent that juries will convict individu
als and tbat jail sentences will be im
posed.
The Remedy In Equity by Dissolution.
In the Standard Oil case the supreme
and circuit courts found tbe combina
tion to be a monopoly of tbe interstate
business of refining, transporting and
marketing petroleum and its products,
effected and maintained through thir
ty-seven different corporations, the
stock of which was held by New Jer
sey company. It in effect commanded
the dissolution of this combination, di
rected tbe transfer and pro rata distri
bution by tbe New Jersey company of
tbe stock held by it in the thirty-seven
corporations to and among its stock
holders, and the corporations and indi
vidual defendants were enjoined from
conspiring or combining to restore
such monopoly, and all agreements be
tween the subsidiary corporations tend
ing to produce or bring about fucther
violations of the act were enjoined.
In the tobacco case the court foahft
tbat the individual defendants, twen
ty-nine inv number, bad been engaged
in a successful effort to acquire com
plete dominion over the manufacture,
sale and distribution of tobacco in this
country and abroad and that this bad
been done by combinations made with
a purpose and effect to stifle competi
tion, control prices and establish a
monopoly, not only in the manufacture
of tobacco, but also of tin foil and lic
orice used in its manufacture and of
its products of cigars, cigarettes and
snuffs. The tobacco suit presented a
far more complicated and difficult case
than tbe Standard Oil suit for a decree
which would effectuate tbe.will of tbe
court and end the violation of the stat
ute. There was here no single hold
ing company, as in the case of tlw
Standard Oil trust. Tbe main company
was tbe American Tobacco company,
a manufacturing, selling and holding
company. Tbe plan adopied to de
stroy the combination and restore com
petition Involved the redivision of th«
capital and plants of-the whole trust
between some of the companies con
stituting the trust and new companies
organized for tbe purposes of the de
cree aud made parties to it and num
bering. new and old. fourteen.
Situation After Readjustment.
The American Tobacco company
(old), readjusted capital $02,000,000:
the Liggett & Meyers Tobacco company
(new), capital $07,000,000: the P. JLorll
lard company mew), capital $47,000,
000. and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco
company (old), capital $7,525,000. are
chiefly engaged in the manufacture
and sale of chewing and smoking to
bacco and cigars. The former one tin
foil company is divided Into two. one
of $825,000 capital and the other of
$400,000 The one snuff company is
divided into three companies, one with
capita) of $15,000,000. another with a
capital of $8,000,000 and a third with
•hwftss
S£s THE DENISON REVIEW
THE DENISON REVIEW, WEDNESDAY, DEC. 6, 1911
a capital of $8,000,000 The licorice
companies are two. one with a capital
of $,".758,300 and another with a capi
tal of $2,000,000. There is also the
British-American Tobacco company, a
British corporation, doing business
abroad with a capital
of $20,000,000.
the Porto Rican Tobacco company,
with a capital of $1,800,000. and the^
corporation of United Cigar Stores,
with a capital of $9,000,000.
Under this arrangement each of the
different kinds of business will be dis
tributed between two or more compa
nies with a division ,of the prominent
brands in the same tobacco products,
so as to make competition not only
possible, but necessary. Thus the
Rmoking tobacco business of the coun
try is divided.so that the present in«
dependent companies have 21.39 per
cent, while the American Tobacco com
pany will have 33.08 per cent, the Lig
gett & Meyers 20.05 per cent, tbe LorU
lard company 22.82 per cent and tbe
Reynolds company 2.66 per cent. The
stock of tbe other thirteen companies,
both preferred and common, has been
taken from the defendant American.
Tobacco company and has been dis
tributed among its stockholders.
All
covenants restricting competition have
been declared null and further per
formance of them has been enjoined.
The preferred stock of the different
companies bas now been given voting
power wbicb was denied it under the
old organization. Tbe ratio of tbe pre
ferred stock to tbe common was as 78
to 40. This constitutes a very decided
change in tbe character of the owner
ship and control of each company.
In tbe original suit there were twen
ty-nine defendants, who were charged
with being the conspirators through
whom the illegal combination acquired
and exercised its unlawful dominion.
Under tbe decree these defendants will
bold amounts of stock in the various
distributee companies ranging from 41
per cent as a maximum to 28% per
cent as a minimum,' except In tbe case
of one small company, the Porto Rican
Tobacco company, in which they will
hold 45 per cent. The twenty-nine la
dividual defendants are enjoined for
three years from buying any stock ex
cept from each other, and the group is
thus prevented from extending its con
trol during tbat |)eriod. All parties to
the suit and tbe new companies who
are made parties are enjoined perpet
ually from In any way effecting any
combination between any of the com
panies in violation of tbe statute by
way of resumption of tbe old trust
Eacb of the fourteen companies is en
joined from acquiring stock in any of
the others. All these companies are
eujoined from having common direc
tors or officers, or common buying or
selling agents, or common offices, or
lending money to each other.
Size of New Companies.
Objection was made by certain in
dependent tobacco companies tbat this
settlement was unjust because it left
companies with very large capital in
active business and that tbe settle
ment that would be effective to put all
on an equality would be a division of.
the capital and plant of tbe trust into
small fractions in amount more near
ly equal to tbat of eacb of the inde
pendent companies. This contention
results from a misunderstanding of
the anti-trust law and its purpose. It
is not intended thereby to prevent the
accumulation of large capital In busi
ness enterprises in wbicb such a com
bination can secure reduced cost of
production, sale and distribution. It
is directed against such an aggrega
tion of capital only when its purpose
is tbat of stifling competition, enhanc
ing or controlling prices and establish
ing a monopoly. If we shall have by
the decree defeated these purposes
and restored competition between the
large units into which the capital and
plunt have been divided we shall have
accomplished the useful purpose of
tbe statute.
Confiscation Not the Purpose of th»
Statute.
It Is not tbe purpose of the statute
to confiscate the property and capita
of tbe offending trusts. Methods of
punishment by fine or imprisonment
of the individual offenders, by fine o!
the corporation or by forfeiture of Its
goods In transportation are provided,
but the proceeding in equity is a spe
cific remedy to stop the operation of
the trust by" injunction and prevent
the future use of tbe plant and capital
in violation of the statute.
Effectiveness of Decree.
I venture tc say tbat not in the his
tory of American law has a decree
more effective for sucb a purpose been
entered by a court than that against
the tobacco trust As Circuit Judge
Noyes said In bis judgment approving
the decree:
"The extent to which it bas been
necessary to tear apart this combina
tion and force it Into new forms with
tbe attendant burdens ought to demon
strate tbat the federal anti-trust statute
Is a drastic statute wbicb accomplishes
effective results, which so long as it
stands on the statute books must be
obeyed and which cannot be disobey
ed without incurring farreachlng pen
alties. And. on the other band, the
successful reconstruction of this or
ganlzatlon should teach that tbe effect
of enforcing this statute is not to de
stroy. but to reconstruct: not to
molfch. but to recreate in accordance
with the conditions which the congress
has declared shall exist among the
people of the United States."
Common Stock Ownership.
It has been assumed that tbe pres
ent pro rata and common ownership In
all these companies by former stock
holders of the trust would insure a
continuance of the same old single con
trol of all the companies into which
the trust has by decree been disinte
grated. This is erroneous and is based
upon the assumed inefficacy and innoc
uousness of judicial Injunctions. The
companies are enjoined from co-opera
tion or combination they have differ
ent managers, directors, purchasing
aftd sales agents. If all or many of
the numerous stockholders, reaching
Injto the thousands, attempt to secure
concerted action of the companies with
a view to tbe control of tbe market
tfajeir number is so large that such an
attempt could not well be concealed.
a4d its prime movers and all its partic
ipants would be at once subject to con
tempt proceedings and imprisonment
of a summary character. Tbe immedi
ate result of the present situation will
necessarily be activity by all the com
panies under different managers, and
tb^n competition must follow or there
will be activity by one company and
stagnation by another. Only a short
tiine will inevitably lead to a change
In (ownership of the stock, as all op
portunity for continued co-operatloa
mist disappear. Those critics who
speak of this disintegration In the trust
us a mere change of garments have not
given consideration to the inevitable
working of tbe decree and understand
little tbe personal danger of attemptr
ing to evade or set at naught tbe sol
emn injunction of a court whose object
is made plain by tbe decree and whose
inhibitions are set forth with a detail
and comprehensiveness unexampled in
the history of equity jurisprudence.
Voluntary Reorganizations of Other
Trusts at Hand.
Tbe effect of these two decisions bas
led to decrees dissolving tbe combina
tion of manufacturers of electric
laknps. a southern wholesale grocers'
association, an interlocutory decree
against the powder trust, with direc
tions by the circuit court compelling
dissolution, and other combinations of
a similar history are now negotiating
with the department of Justice looking
to "a disintegration by decree and re
organization in accordance with law.
It seems possible to bring about these
reorganizations without general busi
ness disturbance
Movement For Repeal of the Anti
trust Law.
But now tbat tbe anti-trust act is
seen to be effective for the accomplish
ment of tbe purpose of its enactment
we are met by a cry from many differ
ent quarters for its repeal. It is said
to be obstructive of business progress,
to be an attempt to restore old fash
ioned methods of destructive competi
tion between small units and to make
impossible those useful combinations
of capital and tbe reduction of tbe cost
of production that are essential to con
tinued prosperity and normal growth.
In the recent decisions the supreme
court makes clear that there is noth
ing in the statute which condemns
combinations of capital or mere big
ness of plant organized to secure econ
omy in production and a reduction of
its cost It is only when the purpose
or necessary effect of tbe organization
and maintenance of the combination
or tbe aggregation of Immense size are
the stifling of competition, actual and
potential, and the enhancing of prices
and establishing a monopoly that tbe
statute is violated. Mere size is no
sin against the law. Tbe merging of
two or more business plants necessari
ly eliminates competition between the
units thus combined, but this elimina
tion is in contravention of the statute
only when the combination is made for
purpose of ending this particular com
petition in order to secure control of
aud enhance prices and create a mo
nopoly.
Lack of Definiteness In the Statute.
The complaint is made of the stat
ute that it is not sufficiently definite
in its description of tbat which is for
bidden to enable business men to avoid
its
violation. Tbe suggestion is that
we may have a combination of two
corporations which may run on for
years and tbat subsequently the at
torney general may conclude that it
was a violation of tlie statute aud that
which was supposed by tbe combiners
to be innocent then turns out to be a
combination in violation of the statute.
The answer to this hypothetical case
is
that when men attempt to amass
such stupendous capital as will enable
them to suppress competition, control
prices and establish a monopoly they
know the purpose of their acts. Men
do not do such a thing without having
it clearly in mind. If what they, do is
merely for the purpose of reducing the
cost of production, without tbe thought
of suppressing competition by use of tbe
bigness of the plant they are creating,
then they cannot be convicted at tbe
time tbe union Is made, nor can they
he convicted later unless It happen
that later on they conclude to sup
press competition and take tbe usual
methods for doing so and thus estab
lish for themselves a monopoly. .They
can in such a case hardly complain_lf
the motive which subsequently is dis
closed is attributed by the court to the
original combination.
New Remedies Suggested.
Much is said of the repeal of this
statute and of constructive legislation
intended to accomplish the purpose
and blaze a clear path for honest mer
chants and business men to follow. It
may be that such a plan will be
evolved* but I-submit that the discus
sions which have been brought out In
recent days by the fear of the con
tinued execution of the anti-trust law
have produced nothing but glittering
generalities and have offered no line
of distinction or rule of action as defi
nite and as clear as that which tbe su
preme court itself lays down in en
forcing the statute.
Supplemental Legislation Needed, Not
Repeal or Amendment.
I see no objection, and indeed I can
see decided advantages. In the enact
ment of a law which shall describe
and denounce methods of competition
which are unfair and are badges of tbe
unlawful purpose denounced In the
anti-trust law. The attempt and pur
pose to suppress a competitor by un
derselling him at a price so unprofita
ble as to drive him out of business or
the making of exclusive contracts with
customers under which they are re
quired to give up association with oth
er manufacturers and numerous kin
dred methods for stifling competition
and effecting monopoly should be de
scribed with sufficient accuracy in -a
criminal statute on tbe one hand to
enable tbe government to shorten Its
task by prosecuting single misdemean
ors Instead of an entire conspiracy and
on the other hand to serve the purpose
of pointing out more In detail to
the business community what must be
avoided.
Federal Incorporation Recommended.
In a special message to congress on
Jan. 7. 1010, I ventured to point out
the disturbance to business that would
probably attend the dissolution of these
offending trusts. I said:
"But such an Investigation and pos
sible prosecution of corporations whose
prosperity or destruction affects the
comfort not only iof stockholders, but
of millions of wage earners, employees
and associated tradesmen, must neces
sarily tend to disturb the confidence
of the business community, to dry up
tbe now flowing sources of capital
from its places of hoarding and pro
duce a bait In our present prosperity
that will cause suffering and strained
circumstances among the Innocent
many for the faults of the guilty few.
Tbe question which I wish in this
message to bring clearly to the con
sideration and discussion of congress
Is whether. In order to avoid such a
possible business danger, something
cannot be done by which these busi
ness combinations may be offered a
means, without great financial dis
turbance. of changing the character,
organization and extent of their busi
ness into one within tbe lines of tbe
law under federal control and super
vision. securing compliance with tbe
nnti-trust statute.
"Generally in the industrial combina
tions called 'trusts' tbe principal busi
ness is the sale of goods in many states
and In foreign markets—in other words,
the Interstate and foreign business far
exceeds tbe business done In any one
state. This fact will justify the fed
eral government in granting a federal
charter to such a combination to make
and sell in interstate and foreign com
merce the products of useful manufac
ture under such limitations as will se
cure a compliance with the anti-trust
law. It is possible so to frame a stat
ute tbfct. while It offers protection to a
federal company against harmful, vex
sitious and unnecessary invasion by the
states, it shall subject it to reasona
ble taxation and control by the states
with respect to its purely local busi
ness.
"Corporations organized under this
act should be prohibited from acquir
ing and holding stock in other corpo
rations (except for special reasons,
upon approval by tbe proper federal
authority), thus avoiding the creation
under national auspices of the holding
company with subordinate corporations
in different states, which bas been
sucb an effective agency in tbe crea
tion of the great trusts and monopo
lies.
"If the prohibition of the anti-trust
act against combinations In restraint
of trade Is to be effectively enforced
It is essential that tbe national govern
ment shall provide for tbe creation ol
national corporations to carry on a le
gitimate business throughout the Unit
ed States. The conflicting laws of the
different states of tbe Union with re
spect to foreign corporations make it
difficult. If not impossible, for one cor
poration to comply with their require
ments so as to carry on business in
number of different states."
I renew the recommendation of the
enactment of a general law providing
for the voluntary formation of cor
porations to engage in trade and com
merce among the states and with for
eign nations. Every argument wbicb
was then advanced for such a law and
every explanation which was at that
time offered to possible objections has
been confirmed by our experience since
tbe enforcement of the anti-trust stat-

H. L. FITCH RESIDENT MANAGER
Company With Unlimited Capital
Takes Over Menagh Mill— Mr.
Fitch Experienced Miller.
As bas been announced previously,
the Menagh mill has been sold to the
Doud Milling company of Manning.
The Monitor of Manning gives a brief
history of this excellent company,
which we are privileged to publish. As
will be seen the company has been in
the milling business for many years
and have abundant capital for carry
ing on the business. The Monitor
says:
"While the constituency of tbe
Doud Milling company is generally
known in this community and ub
word of commendation or explanation
is necessary in its behalf, yet as com
parative strangers in our neighboring
county seat, it may not be out
place to give a short history of the
main stockholders of this concern.
"Its present officers and cbief
stockholders are R. G. Sutherland and
H. W. Pollock.
"Gord, as he is familiarly known,
is the present cashier of the First
National bank, one of the very sound
est financial institutions of western
Iowa, and a bank of which Manning
and vicinity may be proud, containing'
deposits as shown by its statements in
excess of $600,000.00. He has worked
in this bank since 1893 and has been
actually a busy man as cashier since
the retirement of O. E. Dutton, more
than two years ago. While not active
ly engaged in "the management of the
milling business, Mr. Sutherland's
sound financial judgment has contrib
uted largely to its present success,
While his ability as a banker is too yell
known in this part of the state to need
any commendation from us.
"H. W. Pollock, secretary and.active
manager of the Doud Milling company,
has been a resident of Manning since
1888, excepting a period of about four
years during which time he was en
gaged in the banking business in Illi
nois and Iowa, coming to Manning as
active manager of the Milwaukee ele
vator, then owned by James Pollock.
He. has been engaged in the jgrain and
milling business practically all bis""
life, except the interval before stated,'
and while he does not pretend to be
an expert miller, he has acquired such,
a thorough knowledge of the business
as manager that he is fully competent^
to act in that capacity, were not bis V,
other duties so heavy as to preclude
this.
"Mr. H. L. Fitch, also a stockholder
in this company, and head milled at
this point, has been engaged in? the
milling business here and elsewhere
for fifteen years and goes from this
point as manager at Denison with all
of these years of successful experience
back of him.
"The quality of flour manufactured
by the Doud Milling company is such
that they have been able to success
fully compete with the best brand
manufactured in any mill and it goes
without saying that the quality of tbe
output of both the local and Denison
plants will be maintained at its hither
to high standard.
"While it is sometimes out of place
to indulge in unlimited endorsement
yet we i'eel that the stockholders in
this concern are entitled to a great
deal of credit.
"They are comparatively young men
and started in the business with a
small amount of capital and with a
reasonable amount of business and
have so successfully added thereto
and increased the same that it became
necessary for them to either erect an
other mill at Manning or buy else
where or lose the sale of car loads of
their products.
"We are informed at this time the
mill is nine car loads behind with their
orders and that within this week an
unsolicited order came to jt for more
than one thousand sacks of flour. The
quality cf its flour commends it to
home consumption and precludes the
necessity of our home merchants im
porting to supply their trade. The ca
pacity of their irJll at Manning is sev
enty barrels, and that of the Denison
plant is one hundred barrels per day,
and with this addition the company
will no doubt be able to fill its orders
after getting the new plan in opera
tion. which will be about December 1st.
"Messrs. Pollock and Sutherland are
also chief stockholders in the Earling
Grain company, and H. W. Pollock
and company, which plants with Doud
Milling company, now own and con
trol seven elevators and two flour
mills, situated as follows: Two elevat
ors and a flour mill in each of the
towns of Manning and Denison, one
elevator at Earling. one at Adair and
one at Bagley.
"Mr. Fitch will have personal super
vision over the output of the Denison
plant and will retain general super
vision of the manufacture in the home
concern and his place as expert miller
will be supplied by George Mehuron, of
Superior, Neb."
