John IIossack was murdered at his
homo near Madora a few night ago.
The particulars are about as follows:
Somewhere near 13 o'clock an assas
sin entered the house, and while Wr.
Hossack and his wife were in lied,
struck Ilossack twice, once with the
sharp edge of an axe, just above and
back of the right ear. crushing the
bone the first cut. The murdered
man was sleeping on the reair side
of the bed, his wife on the front,
and how long before the wife awak
ened is not fully known, but sufficient
time elapsed to allow the assassin
to get away without leaving amy
clue. Mrs. Hossack says she was
suddenly awakened by some noise
pmd saw a flash of light and called
her husband, who did not answer,
Whereupon she at once struck a light
nnd beheld the ghastly sight of him
lying in a pool of his own blood with
no further signs of the murderer.
The axe was found forty or fifty
feet away from the house under an
outhouse. The ferocious dog, kept
by the family had. to all appearances,
been drugged. The murdered man
was an old citizen, highly respected
end a prosperous farmer, who did
not have an enemy in the world so
fair as known. A year ago last sum
mer he was a eamdidate before the
republican county convention for
treasurer of Warren county and came

except one or two married children..
Two boys of about 10 and 12 years
were in an adjoining room and the
otheris were up stairs. Mr. Hossack

BPIEOI TEST TO BR
Supreme Court to J*nsa on Ui« Tito*
A mrmlment,
Iowa City, Dec. 3.—Attorney Gen
eral Milton Remley, Senator Titus!
nnd Attorney General-elect Mul
lau of Iowa, in conference here,
formulated a plan whereby they
hope to secure a speedy opinion
of the supreme court and put an endi
to the Titus amendment muddle.
While they refused to state their
llan which was' agreed upon, it is
understood that they have made, ar
rangements for a test case in the su
preme court at an early date. The
case as proposed will be brought up
in a district court before a judge
who will give a speedy decision and
will at once be carried up as the
case is tried.
The supreme court, it is under-!
stood, is not adverse to advancing
the case on the calendar and rfrnder-i
ing a decision at once. The argu
ments will probably be submitted
to the supreme court in advance and
everything be in readiness in ordeif
that a decision enn be rendered,
promptly. Jt is expected that the
decision willl be made the first day
the supreme court is in session. None
of the state officers is disposed to
question the right of these men,'
elected at the last election, to takn
charge of he offices and none is will'
ing to make the test.
The case, as proposed, will be an
earnest controversy and it is ex
pected that both IJemley and Mullan
will champion the cause of the newly
elected man who win make the test.
Both of these men believe that the.
amendment should be construed ac-,
cording to the intent of the author/
Senator Titus, who thought he was
framing a bill which would lengthen
the terms of the o^.ecrs whose terms
expired on the first Monday in Janu
ary, 1903.

not only charged with having open

express purpose of keeping delec

says it was for the best interests of
the family to keep the letter from
his wife, and on this ground will
base his defense.

of a member to resign at a future

raise the point formally, but merely
called attention to it so in future it
could not be used as a precedent.
Mr. Dolliver's resignation, he saiJ,
had been tendered to take effect De

been elected to fill a vacancy which
did not exist at the time of the elec

in the future. Mr. Bailey said he did
not desire to press the matter, but
desired the protest to be filed. The
speaker stated, that inasmuch as ob
jection had been made, Mr. Conner
would step aside until the protest
had been disposed of.

•Judge* Holmes of Polk County Decide*
JPierce-Slewart Citse
Des Moines, Dec. 3.—After weeks oi
waiting since the suit was instituted
last summer, Judge Holmes in they
district court has handed down an
opinion in the Pierce-Stewart Home
stead case. It is held that a receiver'
must be appointed as provided in the
original agreement, to sell the prop
erty of the Iowa Homestead to the
highest bidder, but in the meantime
Pierce is to be left in possession ofi
the Homestead property. With the
exception that the property must be
sold by a receiver the victory is one
for Pierce, the court holding that
SStewart cannot hold to the terms of
the charter as to his employment
after the expiration of the charter.
No receiver has been named by the
court, an opportunity being first al
lowed to the interested parties to
agree, if possible, upon some person
to act in this cajiaeity. In case of a
failure to agree the court will then
appoint a receiver for the purpose of
selling the Homestead property, with
the. exception of the real estate, the
sale of which is to be. determined by
the parties themselves.

INO Danger Tbnt Be -Will Be Recalled
from Peking.
Washington, Nov. 29.—There is no
truth to the story that Conger in
tends to return home. The depart
ment has given the matter an em
phatic denial. There is no difference
of opinion, and the administration is
more than satisfied with the work be
ing performed by Iowa's distinguish
ed diplomat.
It developed yesterday the chief
point in the exchanges concerning
China which thave been going on dur
ing the last few days among the
powers relates to the wisdom of de
livering an ultimatum to China, using
the expression "ultimatum" in the
text of the demand to be handed to
the Chinese envoys, involving the pos
sibility of resulting in a declaration
of war against China in case the de
mands of the ultimatum are not com
plied with. It appears some of the
powers desired t.lie express use of the
word "ultimatum" in the demand rel
ative to the decapitation or other ex
treme punishment of eleven princes
or other high officials responsible for
the outrages, and this view of using
the most extreme term of diplomacy
seems to have found favor with the
ministers at Peking. When it be
came known at several capitals a con
siderable dissent oecanie manifest.
'About a week ago Japan took the in
itiative in the appeal for modera
tion. This received favorable con
sideration of the United States,
France, Russia! and probabiy Great
Britain. About the same time Sec
retary ITay took steps to express the
view of this government wais inad
visable to proeeed to the extent of an
ultimatum against China, but the de
mand should not be beyond what
China reasonably might have the
power to coTfiply with. The unanim
ity of sentiment among the powers
gives grounds for tne belief that
the demands of the ministers will be
modified by the omission of the term
"ultimatum," although it is not yet
clear what the final attitude of the
remaining powers, Germany, Austria
and Italy, will be.

A representative of lhe Associated

prominent members of the European

"We are planning no new campaign.
There is no reason why Agoneillo
should go to Hong Ivong to give the
Filipinos a further supply of the mu
nitions of war. The fact that Agon
eillo has just leased a home in Paris
shows he intends to remain there
and watch events. The reports of
our commit,tees.at Kobe, Yokohama,
Sfacao, llataviii, Hong Kong and
Bangkok show that they ai-e all
working well. This is also evidenced
by the fact that 30,000 rifies were
smuggled into Manila last month.
The war is no nearer the end than
'ever. Filipino resources are still
great, as can be juilgcd by the fact
that Aguinaldo is continuing to keep

CANAL KIUHT8 ABE 8ICORKV
Secretary Buy Gets Coneeasions Pram
Government of Nicaragua.
Washington, Dec. 3—Secretary Hay,
for the government of the United
States, and Senor Corrca, Nicaraguan
minister, signed a treaty whereby the
latter government concedes to the
United States the necessary rights
and privileges within her bestowal
for the construction of the Nicarag
uan canal.
This action is ta'.:cn in anticipation
of congressional action upon the
pending Nicaragua canal bill and the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty. Pending the
submission of the treaty to the sen-
ate, which body must ratify the
agreement, its terms will not be
made public. It is generally under
stood, however, that generally Nica
ragua grants to the United States
government, the exclusive right to
construct and operate the canal be
tween the Atlantic and Pacific across
Nicaragua, including the free use of
the Sau Juau river and of Luke Man
agua as part of the water course.
Nicaragua is al.so to rid herself of
any outstanding treaties that would
tend in any wa.y to abridge the priv
ileges to 1)0 acquired by the United
States. It is understood also that
Nicaragua concedes to the United
States full authority to police the
canal. Nicaragua is to receive in
compensation a certain amount of
securities of the canal construction
company and although it is not pos
sible now to learn the figures set
down in the treaty, it is believed to
approximate $5,000,000.
The state de| airtmc.nt, already Vtn
entered into an agreement on similar
lines with the republic of Costa liica.
This was because Costa Rica has es
tablished a claim to the right bank
of the San Juan river, which must
of necessity form about a third of
the length of the canal, should the
Nicaragua route be selected and.
be constructed on the lines which
will be suggested by the Walker com
mission.
An understanding* also has been
arrived at with the'United States of
Colombia covering the same rights
as are conveyed by Nicaragua and
Costa Rica .iu the case of the Nica
ragua route. So the state depart
ment now has cleared the way for
such action as congress may care to
taue in the. ease of cither of the
canal routes which have been found
feasible.

the motive of an overture from the

Boers be conciliated.
"If men like Botha and De Wet vol
untarily surrender and bind them
selves not to act against us in the fu
ture," the Statist will say, "is there
aziy good reason why a promise
should not be given not to send them
out of the country? Mr. J. B. Robin
son suggests that Botha and De Wet
should be invited to take seats in the
legislative council that would be es
tablished. The suggestion is worthy
of approval. The Boers should not,
be excluded, even from the begin
ning, from anything which can safely
be given them."

Manila, Dec. 4.—Sunday in Yigan
was a great day for the American
cause. Twenty-two hundred natives
of the region, nearly all fighting
•rebels, crowded the church and took
the oath of allegiance to the United
•States. The oath was administered'
by the priest. All but 500 of those
taking the oath were bolomen. The
number included the 1,300 bolomen
who had previously surrendered.
The proceedings in the church oc
cupied the entire day ana included
an address by General Young and an
exhortation by the priest. Scarcely
any rebels remain in the vicinity of
Santa-Maria. General Young attri
li-uies this fact to three causes—the
ire-election of President McICinley,
the arrival of a strong body of troops
the especially rigid enforcement
tandwar
af measures, and the deporta
tion of prisoners to Malay. He re
.ports -that it. is necessary. to occupy
all the barriers in order to protect
the natives from the vengeance of
jTagalo raiders,
A suspended enemy is half con
quered.
Some of the orange growers of
Florida cover their trees with tents
so arranged as to admit the sun
.light on one side and keep out frosty
winds- on the other. In each tent
is an oil lamp which is lighted on
cold nights to keep the trees warm.
The nioh -fyho does wrong inten
'tionally always plans an exfcuse for
doing it in advance.
In various parte of India otters
aire used by the natives, to catch fish
for them. So rapid is the speed, if
the otter under water that' no fish
csp escape them. Whep. pot work
ing- the otters are tied to sfykes^ like
chained dogs.
One-third of all the oars made in
this country are sent abroad. All
the oars used on British war vessels
come from the United States. Our
oars are renowned for t^eir light
ness, strength, durability and beauty
of finish.
There is a. bill before the Vermont
legislature to authorize tne issut of
$10,000,000 of state bonds for implor

Silk material is no modern affair.
It is known that silken garments
were worn, 2,500* years before the

NOTES FROM THE CAPITA
Des Moines. Timber 4. tOOO.
Dr. Lewis Schooler chairman mt
the general army post committee,
has sent word to Captain J. A. T.
Hull that the committee has selected
a site for an army post and has se
cured the money necessary for its
purchase. The site selected is th©
Drisco-Denny property, located about
three and one-half miles south of the
business center of the city. The next
step toward scouring the post will be
the appointment of a commission by
the government to visit this city and
decide if the army post committee's
proposition is to be accepted. No
one anticipates that there will be
any objection. On the other hand,
everyone who has been associated in
any way with the movement expects
the spring of 1901, or at least th*
early summer, to see an army post,
composed of a regiment of cavalry,
completely established and in fuU
operation within walking distance of
Des Moines. In establishing the post
\s
ei!-y £ov?rnment
will prob­
ably begin with an expenditure of a
little less than $1,000,000. After it it
established the money spent in its
management will amount to over
$50,000 a month.
The. official figures show that the
proposition to hold a convention to
revise and 'amend the constitution
was lost by 555 votes. The lirsi
rough draft of 1 he official figures
showed the convention had been car
ried by a narrow margin. But when
the abstracts were checked over it
was found there had been errors in
transcribing the returns' from the
abstracts for the purpose of getting
at official results. The chief source
of the trouble was in the returns
from Tama county. This had been
credited with l.OQu too many votes
for the convention, a "2" having been
mistaken for a "3." The total vote
cast for the convention according to
the official figures was 17G.337 and the
total vote against it was 176,892. The
official figures on the Titus amend
ment cio not alter materially the
semi-official figures given out, the
majority for the amendment being
upwards of 30,000.
Two handsome pieces of marble

are of life size and are of the purest
Parisian marble. 'They were sculp

the figures agree they are striking
likenesses of ex-Governor Larrabee
and his wife.
