Speaker Kf.ifbu was with tho West oil
the way through no the silver question. Ho
/oted for tho Bland hill Npy. VIBT7, mid for
the Slot thews sliver resolution Jan. 28,1878,
He was not present Fob, 28, 1878, when tho
House passed the bill, but his colleague, Mr.
Jones, staged that if lie had been present ho
would have voted to override tho veto.
Mn. Edward MoPiierrok had precisely
the same number of votes for Clerk that Mr.
Kclfer had for' Speaker. So tho opposition
of the machine Stalwarts amounted to noth
ing. They were compelled to voto for a man
who has been hostile to tho third-term idea
ever since it wqs brqqobed, 3Jr. McPherson
has long been the most aggressive antl-Cmn
eron man in Pennsylvania, unless Charles ft
'Wolfe may be considered ahead of him in
this respect. Nino of the Pennsylvania
mcpibers voted for McPherson In Uie caucus
—u fact Wjiich tends to show that Mr. Cam
eron is not so Influential in his own State as
he protends to be.
Tun London Valin TclcuvaiiU, in discuss
ing Uie question of Gnlteau’s alleged insanity,-
says: “ it) such cases the verdict of mankind
at largo Is moro to bo trusted ’ than a Jury,
and undoubtedly Uie general voice demands
that Uultonu shall pay tho full penalty of his
crime." From the manner In which Uultcuu
hits been allowed to take charge of the case,
to dictate to witnesses and counsel, to brow
beat Uie Court and stump-speech.tho Jury, it
would appear that lie is to expound the law,
to decide upon Uio testimony, to coach the
Jury, and ultimately deliver Uio verdict.
What the jury may have ultimately to do
with the case remains to he seen, hut Unis
far they seem to have been entertained, like
'.the rest of tho crowd, by Uie antics of tbo
tpriaonor, . .
The Cincinnati Gazette may be supposed
to know what it Is talking about when It

An organ of Uio Prohibitionists, speaking
ot the present prosperity of the United States,
soys:
As a country, our success for the past flvo or
six yours (7) has boon perfectly pboooineiml, and
it rests upon sovorul foundation stones, tbo
chief of vrblcb Is Uio system of Governmental
protection to home Industries by tbo Imposition
of duties on Imports.
Not exactly. The “chief of which Is the
system “of big production of wheat, corn,
cuttle, cotton, hogs, butter, ohecso, and
petroleum, sold at high prices in Europe
since 1877. When Uie panic struck tills
country in 1873 It had “enjoyed “ twelve
years of uninterrupted high tarlifon consum
ers, and for five years it experienced the
better times, notwithstanding Uio “bless
lugs ” to be derived 1 tram high protective
taxation of consumers. f JJho “ phenomenal
of the country began with a suc
cession of short crops lit Europe in 1877 and
ii simultaneous scries of lona crops In this
ebuutry, of which enormous surpluses were
sold in European markets at high prices.
The tariff had about as much to do with r*
storing the prosperity 6f Uio country as a
beggar set on horseback has to do with tbo
speed aiid strength of Uie animal he rides
and spurs. Thu “ protected ” classes handi
capped the great unprotected industries of
the country, like the mounted mendicant,
charged them two price# for their wares,
and then hired advocates in and out of Con
gress to ridiculously pret«ml\hat such exac
tions are good fovthu unprotected classes I
There is nothing inoro absurd or false thnn
tho allegation that tho restoration of prosnor
ity since 1878 la duo to a tax of f»0 per cent on
goods purchased by consumers.
The Philadelphia Press blundered badly
In coining to the support of Father Kelley’s
proposition for the repent of tho taxes on
whisky, beer, and tobacco. Still it seems to
think that n blunder well stuck to is better
than the truth. It says of The Tiuuune
comments on Kelley’s speech:
.9 i.ar,
. A.im
. 80.00
Tub CmcAno TntmrNß claims that It has re
peatedly urged Unit ♦.VMWO.iWd or so of ibo sur
plus rovnuie, derived from Unitor, be appro
priated among iho Htntes to alii In building up
and maintaining free schools. This is very well
did It not further Insist that Me. Kelley ami
those thinking wllh him prtunst against this and
want to donate that sum to tho llqnor-dcniers.
“ Not n dollar for free schools, but millions for
free saloons” Is tho motto it ascribes to those
who favor Iho abolition of tho Internal (axes.
If Tim Timur.s'R writer had taken tho troublo to
road Judge Kelley's speech before ho com
mented on ft, ho would have seen that one of
tho chief points to bo gained by the repeal of tho
Internal taxes Is that it will nlford tho States iho
opportunity of securing for themselves Iho
revoimo which tho General Government remits.
If tho Vntm writer hail road Tin: Turn
r.NE ns faithfully ns ho has rend Kelley’s
speech, ho would know that this paper has
noticed and exposed tho fallacy referred to.
Tho General Government would not “ nlford
the .States the opportunity .of securing for
tjimnsclvcs the-rnvenno which the General
Government remits ” by taking tho taxes olf
whisky,beer, and tobacco. Such.tnxcs, tobo
effective, must ho uniform. • One Stale could
not impose them unless all did. Otherwise,
tho manufacturers would remove to tho
State or States which did not tax thorn. And
It is Improbable that all tho Slates could,
agree upon n uniform revenue system, or that
It would ho equally enforced If they did.
Thera Is nothing In the Kelley prop
osition. Tho /Vcss goes on to notice
tho Philadelphia suggestion
that tho General ' Government should
collect Oio Interim! revenue .taxes and
divide thorn, or part, ot thorn—say tho tax
on spirits—among tho States for educational
purposes. The Chicago Tiihiune wilt ho
heartily in favor pf that proposition when
tho tlmo conics. Jint until tfiu enormous de
mands on.account of pensions uro satlsticd it
may bo thought that any scheme for tho ro
dmtjon of tho revenue is premature amt pos
sesses only a speculative interest.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The lirst message of President Arthur
will we fonr prove n disappointment to tno
country. It is needlesly extended hy his In
cluding within it unusually full abstracts of
tho reports and recommendations of tlm Sec
retaries of Slate, Treasury, War, Navy, and
Interior Departments, and also of some of
tho minor bureaus. This recapitulation of
Uio recommendations of the departments Is
largely unaccompanied by any IndorHumejit

docs Indorse them.
Humnkes a graceful nml appropriate rcfcr
cnro to lilr illustrious predecessor mill to Uio
aolloti ot tho Governments of other nations
concerning his death; Following this he de
votes more than a column of this paper to a
summary of our relations with foreign Gov
ernments, all of which are of tun most amica
ble character. That part of this review re
lating to Mexico, Chill, Tern, ami Bolivia In
dicates that this Government will employ Its
best efforts to establish peace and promote
friendly relations with all these peoples, lie

Unapproves of the recommendations of
tho Secretary of-the Treasury that tho law
authorizing silver certificates to ho Issued to
depositors of silver bo repealed, on tho
ground that they nro unnecessary because
tho National banks can furnish all the cur
rency needed; amt ho advises that the coin
age of silver dollars bo limited to the discre
tion of tho Treasury Department. It is.not
likely that either of these, recommendations
will meet tho approval of tho country; the
American people nro not likely to forego a
currency redeemable on demand in coin for
tho purpose of enabling private.banking cor
porations to issue their notes, nut redeem
able in coin, to Increase their circulation.■.
After repeating in detail the operation? of
tho Treasury in funding the debt, and giving
tho details of the increase in public revenue,
ho thinks it bettor to reduce tho rovenno by
a reduction of taxation than to keep up the’
present taxes and pay olf tho debt. Ho there
fore advises tho repeal ot ail tho Internal
revenue (axes except those imposed on to
bacco, distilled spirits] and fermented Hq
uors, With regard to the tariff he advises
tho appointment of u coimntsson to revise
tho taritl laws.
Ho indorses the recommendation option.
Blionnan for an increase In the army, nml
also the recommendation for an Increase
and reorganization of the navy.
To Ids great credit, tho President thinks
that tho (lovornment should now begin tho
policy of giving National aid to education by
sotting apart n fund to bo employed by the
. States for educational purposes. •
He enumerates tho recommendations of
the Postmaster-General, and tacitly approves
them, and announces that ho‘has given In
structions for, Uio proper prosecution of all
persons guilty of fraud In tho matter of star
route’ postal Hcrvlco. Ho urges generally
that relief bo given to Uio overburdened
Supreme Court, and suggests that much of
the business transferred to Uio Federal
courts because of tho War might now bo
restored to the State courts.
Ho Indorses at considerable length mens-*
ures for tho solution of the Indian problem,
Including an abandonment of tho recogni
tion of the Indians us tribes, tho extension
over them of tho laws of tho'Statcs and Terri
tories in which tho Indians aru located, ami
the allotment of loud to tho Indians In sev
eralty, and a liberal prevision fur Uie educa

Ho repeats Uio difltoultlcs which aland in

Congress to dellno particularly tho meaning
of that clause of the Constitution.
bbnatob shbbman’s fondino bill.
The bill Introduced Into the United Slates
Senate by Mr. Sherman to authorize a » per
cent live-year optional loan la a very differ
ent proposition from that urged In the last
Congress by Messrs. Uandali, Carlisle, and
Tucker, ami fathered by the Demouratio ma
jority. It was then proposed to compel tho
Secretary of tho Treasury to sell at par a
short-time bond bearing » per cent Interest
ns lliu only means for refunding tho 1500 mill
ions of old bonds which wore soon ,to be
come subject to call and for avoiding the
continued payment of 0 amt 5 per cent Inter
est. It was further proposed by the prepos
terous Democratic scheme to coerce tho Na
tional banks to subscribe for these short
bomla nt the lowest interest over known,
without regard to their own Interests
nr necessities. The country protested
against that measure as Impracticable with
out tho coercive feature, ami unfair with tho
element of coercion. Since then the old fi
amid per cent bonds have been extended
hulpllnltly. nt tho rate of i\}i per cent,
and may bo jpdeomod by tho Government In
any amount ami at any time It secs lit to call
them. This option Is of such obvious ad
vantage that it would he doubtful policy to
surrender It c.von to save one-halt of 1 per
cent Interest, and there would be good reason
to antagonize any scheme fora!!per cent
bond of a llxcd term. Jhit Senator Sher
man's bill avoids this question altogether.
' Tho tc\t of tho bill Is ns follows:
He it eimrted, etc., That tho Bcorutnry of tho
Treasury Is hereby authorised to receive nt tho
Treasury amt at tho ollicn of any Asststant-
Treusnrcror tho United .States legal money of
tho United States to iho amount of &VJ, or any
multiple of that sum, tlnd Issue lu exchange
therefor an equal amount of registered or cou
pon tiuudsof tiio United Unites of iho duuoml
nations of fSO, SIUO, $.500, SI,OOO, and ftio.ooo, of
sueii form as hit may proscribe, hearing Interest
nt the rate of a pur cunt per annum, payable
quarterly orHcmt-anmmlly at the Treasury of
too United Stales. Such bunds shall bo exempt
from all taxation by or under State authority,
and be payable at Iho pleasure of the United
States utter Jan. 1.1M7, the order of-their pay
ment. to bo determined bymw, nr, In thu absenco
of such legislation, by tho ruins and regulations
to bo prescribed by tho Secretary of Iho Treas
ury. Tho money deposited under this net Hindi
bo promptlv applied solely to tho redemption of
bonds of Iho United States bearing U l /j percent
Interest, and the aggregate amount of deposits
under this act shall not exceed tho sum of TdOU,-
UU.IIK). .
This Is brief, clear, amt to tho .paint. It
involves no contingency of disappointment
or embarrassment. It proposes Hint tho Gov
ernment shall say to capitalists, largo and
small, American ami foreign, that if they
have any money which they desire to Invest
at per coni In a shape upon which they
will bo able to rcnll/o at any limn they may
waiit current funds, tho Government will
give them that opportunity In amounts of
§r.n, sioo, SuOO. Si,ooo, or £IO,OOO, limiting tho
aggregate loan to $:iOO, 000,000, ami reserving
tho right to call In any part of tho loan ut
any time It chooses. The success of this
plan would place Uio loan upon tho sanio
basis ns tho present' extended bonds, with
tho dlircrcnco that tho Government would
save one-half of I per cent. Us failure would
leave tho Government In Just as favorable a
situation ns It Is now. A partial success
would save Interest to tho extent that tho
new bonds should lie taken.
There is no possible objection to Senator
Sherman’s proposition, even thougli it be.re
garded ns tentative. If .it he assumed that
the great bull: of capital which naturally
seeks, investment In Government securities
nt n low rato of interest Is already tied up In
bonds, then, ot course, Uio holders oS.ytf
per-cents will not enro to lake a per cents
witli no guarantee of a longer duration. But
it is .possible that Uio re is a largo amount of
unemployed capita) which will seek tho U
percents, because such bonds will he in Uio
nature of a “call loan,” Inasmuch nt tho
holders can always get par for. them in the
open market with accrued Interest, and since
there will bo no danger of much variation in
value above or below par. In case capital shall
come forward forsuch Investment, bo it much
or little, there will be an opportunity to save
ope-jinif of 1 pur cent Interest on Uio amount
that shall be invested, since thopur cents
will be retired to that extent. This Is thoohly
kind of refunding bill Uiat should bo sug
gested ot thl&time. Us adoption cannot pos
sibly embarrass the Government, but may
possibly result In saving ono-lmlf ofl percent
interest on §1100,000,000, or 81,000,000 a year.
THE UNITED STATES TKEABUB7.
Tho showing mode by this year’s report of
the Secretary of tlio Treasury Is very re-’
markable and most gratifying. It Is literally
a complaint that there is too much revenue—
a condition that rarely occurs In the history
of any Government' and almost never with
out universal ami bitter protest against an
excess of taxation. The surplus revenue of
last year was something like 5(10,000,000. One
year ago Mr.'Shormnivthen Secretary of the
Treasury, estimated that the surplus revenue
for the u ext fiscal year would be 800,000,000.
As a matter of fact the surplus has proved to
bo more than $100,000,000. A year ago then\
was a dollcloney under the requirements of
the Sinking-Fund law of more than $51,000,-
(XX), owing to Uie falling elfin revenue
during tho six years succeeding the panic of
187JJ, The requirements for the last fiscal
yiar have been fully mot and tho deficiency in
tho fund on former years reduced to $10,000,*
000; hut tho requirements for the presontflscal
year are already exceeded by tho redemp
tion of bonds in July, August, September,
and October, so that, at the present rate, tho
deficiency In the sinking fund'-will not only
bo qumplutolv supplied, but by noxt July
tho Government will have reduced its debt,
at a more rapid rate than It over promised.
The estimated surplus of the next fiscal year
is over $105,000,000.
in Uio face of tills showing it Is not strange
Unit the Secretary of the Treasury should urge
upon Congress a speedy and equitable reduc
tion of taxes. The increase of rovepuo Is
about equally divided between' Uio internal
and customs taxes, each class having yielded
about §11,000,000 more than during Uio pre
vious year. Tim Secretary pointedly recom
mends the retention of taxes on whisky,
beer, and tobacco as legitimate subjects ot
taxation, but assents to a repeal of all the
other items of internal taxation ex
cept that on bank circulation, which lie re
gards as properly taxable because circulation
is a direct source of protit to Uie banks under
Uie privilege extended by the Government.
In other words, lie would like to see the
taxes on bank cheeks, on deposits, on capi
tal, on matches, and on cosmetics and patent
medicines repealed ns a partial means to the
reduction of Uio surplus revenue, ajul recom
mends a revision ami reduction in the tariff
tuxes us the principal*relief, lit this matter
Uie Secretary Is undoubtedly .lit harmony
■with the preponderating sentiment ot the
country,
Judge Folgerdispiayshls Now York origin
mid dependence chiefly lit his treatment of
the silver question.. It was a subject Utat re
quired no treatment whatever at Utq present
time. A .simple statement of tho status of
Uie stiver coinage would have suftlced. It
appeal's that about SJH,OOO,OOO of standard sil
ver is In circulation lu coin and about
§(«J,0(X),C00 in the shape of certificates.
Theso two Items represent about. tho
entire Block of standard silver In tho
country, ami yet Secretary Folgor, wlio
has been In olllcoonly a few weeks, descants
on. Uic futllo oiforta of the department to get
the silver Into circulation, as ho admits
that gU tho standard dollars are In circula
tion, either in coin or in tho shape of certifi
cates, it Is Incumbent on him to explain how
ho would proceed to got any more of lb In
circulation except by Increasing the coinage.
Hut the Secretary Is also troubled about tho
assumed existence of " several standards of
value,” as represented by coin, by sliver cer
tificates, by legal-tender, and by National
bank notes. Tho fact Is that there is nut]/
one standard of value—tho double standard'
of gold and silver at a fixed ratio of values.
The stiver certificates are precisely the same,
ns the stiver dollars as the gold certificates
M ould ho the same us gold dollars If the
Treasury Department would Issue them.
Doth are legal-tender. So also arc tho green
backs, .which are redeemable in gold ami sil
ver. Tho National-bank notes, redeem able In
legal-tender, are upon exactly tho sumo,
plane, and currently accepted hy the people
oven In preference 4" gold or silver, ilut
Secretary Folgor, taking his cue from Wall
street, recommends tho repeal of the legal
tender property of the greenbacks, thu early,
retirement of silver certificates, ami thu sus
pension of sliver coinage, ami resorts (o far
fetched and Incorrect statements to support
this greedy, selfish, ami hazardous policy.
On a par with Ids other statements on this
subject, ho suggests a highly Improbable em
barrassment about tho payment of Govern
ment bonds In silver, because "between the
adoption of tho Devised Statutes, Juno ft.*,
1874 J and 1878, silver coin was not legal tend
er.” As tho great hulk of tho 4}( pur cunts,
4 four cents, am! extended njtf-per cents, un
der tho refunding acts, have been Issued and
accepted since the remonetization of silver,
no such question can he raised In regard to
them; Judge Folger’s remarks on silver and
legal-tender only Illustrate anew tho inad
visability of calling a NmvrVorkur to Oio
head of tho Treasury Department.
Thoro are other recommendations in the
report, some of which ’ may meet with favor
nt tho liumis of Congress and the remainder
with disfavor. It Is not likely, for Instance,
that Congress will agree to tho recommenda
tion suggested by tho Controller of the Cur
rency ami approved hy tho Secretary that
tiro National banks shall be allowed to ex
tend their charters as they expire without
going through the process of liquidation and
reorganization. The facts in tho Secretary’s
report are satisfactory, hut many of his ar
guments are fallacious, ampsomo of his sug
gestions avis calculated to bring about unnec
essary disturbance.
THE SHAME OF GUITEAD’S TRIAL.
Mhe coarse, vnlgar'lmpndenco of (Jnltcau
Is exactly paralleled by the audacity of Ills
counsel. Scovlllo’s purpose In calling dis
tinguished public men to the witness-box is
plainly to dignify thu trial of the .infamous
wretch. Ho seeks to surround the prisoner
wltlnm air of respectability by compelling
respectable men to testify in his behalf, Just
ns Gnitonu wlien n free man sought to in
oronan his Importance by forcing himself
into the company of people of prominence.
The defense of Gnlioan Is the complement
of (iulteuu’s life. It is characterized by the
low arts and thu impudent assumptions
which distinguished the assnsin’s career
from youtti to middle ago.
During tha Presidential campaign (Inltcnu
hung about the Republican headquarters In
Now York City, and absolutely forced the men
of National reputation and prominence gath
ered'thereto know him, and, of course, to
despise him. Coi. Hinton, one of the assist
ant clerks, says yjat "his'campaign speech
was regarded as ridiculous, Ids presence ns a
nuisance, (ml himself as an asinine .fool.”
Hut still he appeared there dally, with Ihodc
sign, no doubt, to inaku himself known ns a
basis for 1 his subsequent demand for an
oRIco. And now Ids counsel, with equal
impudence and equal 111-taste, seeks to drag
into court to honor tho nssasln these men
upon wliom the wretch forced Ids acquaint
ance.
Tho crowning act oC this systematic elTort
to'dignify ussnslnatlon consists lusubpamn-
Ing the President of tho United States nn the
ground that (lullonu had tho linpdrtlnenco
to address a letter to him when he was a
candidate for tho Vice-Presidency.' Sir.
Scovlllo Is careful to say that ho will not
compel tho President to appear, lie wants
him to appear voluntarily, and ha publishes
daily to the country notice of tho fact that
ho will shortly Interview tho President on
tho subject of testifying In Gultcan’s behalf.
One would think that tho preservation of
Ouitcau’.s life Is ,of tho first Importance,
Judging by tho names of tho witnesses which
tho defense is careful to have pulnlshed.to
tho country. Put when they appear on tho
stand, ns in tho case of Judge Davis, it Is
bought to ho shown that Clnltejiu’s pica that
the Jtcpubllcan party was In danger of being
destroyed by President Garfield had some
Justification in view of the political situation.
Itcomes within a hair’s breadth of an attempt
to Justify tho shooting! Inn word, Onlteuu

THE MAYOR’S VETO OF THE POLE EVIL,
The Mayor's mossngo accompanying his
veto of tho ordinance authorizing Uio Mutual
Union Telegraph Company to erect tele
graph poles and string wires thereon In vio
lation of the general ordinance prohibiting
tho nuisance Is the ablest and strongest
public document ho has contributed during
his local service. He Is entitled to tho thanks
of the cmninunlty f or defeating tho auda
cious Job, for tho logic of his argument com
pelled all tho Aldermen to vote against tho
passago over his veto oxcopt those who had
some personal Interest In tho measure which
outweighed public considerations.
The reasons which Mayor Harrison has -
given for vetoing tho ordinance may bo hur
riedly summarized as follows: (1) The suc
cession of ungainly poles along* tho streets
mars tho beauty of the city. (3) Tbo net
work of wires Is a permanent obstruction to
prompt attack upon tires. (3) Not only Is
tbo safety of property put In Jeopardy, but
tbo safety of human life Imperiled by pre
venting tho ready uso of firc-oacnpcs. (4) Tbo
general ordinance forbidding tbo erection of
additional telegraph polos and wires was
passed only last spring, and it was proposed
to nullify It at tho very first occasion for en
forcing It. (5) Thu Mutual Union originally
petitioned for tlm privilege of entering tho
cltyLy underground cable, accepted the reg
ulations Imposedby Uic Department of Pub
lic Works, and actually began tho laying of
the cable, and put down audio of It. (*») Thu
cable system, If. properly constructed, is en
tirely practicable, and is in satisfactory oper
ation In other cities.. (7) “Thprelsashrowd
suspicion that this ordinance is a purely
speculative scheme, out of which a fow men
Hot belonging to'tho Mutual Union corpora
tion expect to mnko handsome stuck profits.”
(8) lUicanau tho ordinance did not merely
exempt tbo Mutual Union from the prohibi
tion of meeting poles for telegraph, electric,
and telephone purposes, hut extended to that
corporation In general terms vast privileges
which would soon grow into a giant monop
oly.
Each of theso reasons fs abundant justifi
cation for tho Mayor’s veto, and all of thorn
combined eonstltutomn overwhelming con
demnation of tho sohonio of corruption
whorehy a corporation was to purchase tho
privilege of endangering public safety for Us
own profit. Tho ordinance proposud to grant
tho company the right to “erect poles ami to
strlng.and maintain wires and electric con
ductors along and across tho streets and
alleys of tho City of Chicago.” It was the
pretense of tho Mutual Union Company and
Its representative In .tho Council that it de
sired only to obtain tbo privilege of entering
tho city above the ground Instead of under
the ground. Tbo Mayor exposed completely
tbo deception of this fraudulent pretense.
Had that been tho only purpose in
view, It would not have been neces
sary to IncluUo' all tho streets and
alloys of the city within tho terms of .the or
dinance nor to specify “electric conduct
ors” ns wotl ns telegraph wires. •The lan
guage of tho ordinance as corruptly passed
by tho Connell would hayo unaided tho cor- '
porfttion that bribed tho members to erect
poles anywhere and (svovywhole, and' not
merely to string telegraph wires thereon, but
also telephone wires and conductors for tho
oluotrlo light and even electric motive power,
thereby legalizing a permanent and outra
geous menace to tbo safety of property and
human life. It was probably tbo Mayor’s, ex
posure of .tho comprehensive and dangerous
sl-odo of tho ordinance which deterred soino
of tho Aldermen who voted fur tho ordi
nance In tho' first place from voting for Its
passago oyer the veto.' There Is gtouud for
a much stronger suspicion of tho motives of
tho fourteen Aldermen who voted to pass
tho rascally ordinance after tho ’revelations
of the veto message than tho suspicion which
attached to the original passago of Uio meas
ure.
It Is to ho hoped -that this will ho tho Inst
elfort to’seenro an exemption • from the gen
eral prohibition of tho toloifruph-polo nui
sance. It is only by strict and steadfast ad
herence to such prohibition that tho city cun
over ho rescued from the disfigurement and
tho dangers of telegraph polos along tho
streets of Chicago. The business of this
clty'ls valuable enough to warrant all tele
graph or other uleotrlo companies in tho
future to Uiorcaso their facilities under
ground at, ah additional uxpense, and the
welfare of tho community demands that they
shall bo compelled to adopt that course.'
Thh testimony touching tho recent disas
ter In Minneapolis shows that the agency
which led to the destruction of the four
llourlng-mllls was precisely the same as ttiat
wldoli ocoasioned the loss of tho groat
“Washburn MIN” four years ago—namely:
carbon or mill dust. The resenrehoH
made at that time • showed that
tho Innampiahlo and almost impalpa
ble dust of Hour, bran, and middlings
will explodo like gunpowder, whether in ttio
form of n gas or nut, when it is brought in
contact with heat. Since that time greatenro
Ims been nsed by the millers In keeping their
mills clean and ns free (rom tills dust ns is

struction of three of the mills without ex
plosion, wliilu the fourth mill, this Minne
apolis, which had been closed some time for
repairs, and In which tin? dust had largely
accumulated, was destroyed by explosion.
The lesson of the disaster would seem to ho
tho oxoroiso of constant vigilance to keep
the mills us clean fis possible, ami ,tho adop
tion of every precaution against the intro
duction of Ure tunny fonp.
