VOLUME 8. 1TANKTON, DAKOTA TERRITORY, THURSDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 7, 1882.
A Washington Iclogram upon tlio snb-: Mr. Ward will be catisfactorily unpple
joct of civil nervico reform BOJB Xiopre- mooted by his efforts.
Heutntive Norcrons, of Massachusetts baa
introduced a bill to create a board of
electors, to consist of one from each state
elected by the people, and eligible the
mime as the membors of tbo houso of
opri's^iitut ives. The term of office is six
years. The country is to be
divi.k'd into
postal districts, and postmasters shall be
elccted by the people of the respective
districts, subjeol to the confirmation of
the board of electors, or by the post
master-general. All other civil officers,
as provided for in articlo 2, section 2, ol
the constitution, except members of the
cabinet, ambassadors, other foreign
ministers and United States jadges, shall
be elected and examined or confirmed by
the house of electors. The houso of elec
tors shall mako all rules governing its
confirmations, elections of examinations
of civil officers. Congress shall determine
What
class of postmasters shall be con
firmed by the house of electors and what
by the postmaster-general, and shall
designate what officers shall be elccted,
examined or confirmed by the house of
electors, and also who slmll make ap
pointments of minor officers. Congress
shall have power to provide by law ior
the filling of vacancies that may happen
when the houso of electors is not in
session. The election or appointment of
all civil officers not appointed by the
president as provided shall be for the
term of five years. The president Bhall
have power to remove any officer of the
civil service for any reason except politi
cal.
A Washington special to the St. Paul
Pioneer-Press says:
Delegate Pettigrew of Dakota uaya that be
intends to press for passage tho bili providing
for a division of Dakota into two territories.
While he intends to dfr all he can to secare tho
passage of the Dakota admission bill, he is in
clined to think there is little prospect of this
being accomplished this season but in the
event of a failure to secare this, he thinks it
very important to the people of Dakota that
there should be a
division of the territory.
Haid that in the talks had with senators, be un-
derstood it was the purpose of those having the
Dakota admission in charge to press it to pas
sage as early as possible. The bill is the first
one in the senate calendar as unfinished busi
ness. Chairman Burrows of the house com
mittee on territories Baid he intended to do all
he could to secure the passage of the bill this
this session. The bill is the thirty-sixth in
ordebon the house calandar. Among the meas
ures which precede it are some very important
ones, which it is very doubtful can be passed
thiB winter, and as unanimous consent cannot
be obtained to take the Dakota bill up out of
its order, it is extremely probable that the
house bill cannot be passed. The bill will.
thereforet have to come from the senate, and
unless it is buried on the speaker's table, will
be passed by the house this winter. It is pos
sible the democrats may defeat tho bill by fili
bustering to prevent it being taken from tho
speaker's table.
It is well enough to look out for the
division bill in case admission fails, but
if the admission measure is first on the
senate calendar, we can see no
reason for a failure of tho
statehood project, excepting through
filibustering tactics. It is more thnn
probable that Delegate Pettigrew is not
an ardent advocate of admission,
while the experiences of last fall have
bred a desire to rid himself of tlio north
half of the territory and the powerful
anti-Pettigrew element it contains.
Should southern Dakota become a state
within the next half year, there would be
little chance of the election of Mr. Petti
grew to any important office. His selfish
ambition would naturally lead him to
defer statehood, if possible, in his own
interest without regard to the wishes of
his constituents. He has already de
clined to assist in removing the only ob
stacle between us and statehood—the
Yankton county bond matter. This does
not make it appear that ho is ardently
desirous of the admission of Dakota,
It will be seen by the proceedings of
of the city council that tlio long drawn
out combat between that body and his
honor, the mayor, has. come to an end,
L. H. Eliot, one of the mayor's previous
appointees having been nominated and
confirmed city marshal at the last meet
ing. Pat Brennan, having been elected
to the office of sheriff of Yankton county,
resigned his position as city marshal and
and the necessity for filling the vacancy
induced tlie council to concentrate a suf
ficient number of votes upon Mr,
Eliot to give him tho place. The ap
pointment ia a good one, as the new mar
shal has experience, capacity and lion
esty. It is probable that tho people
generally do not know the cause of this
elongated contest. Our recollection
that the temperance issue was raised in
the beginning, and through this means,
several of the alderman got into the
habit of voting against tho mayor's
nominations and could not break off sud'
denly.
In retaliation to tho other element in
the council, refused to vote for a pro
Minced temperance mac for president
oE the city legislature, and dur
ing all the weary months since
tho spring election, that body
has been destitute of a regular presiding
offioer. Tho gap was filled, however, at
the last meeting by the election of Alder
man M. T. Woolley ae president and the
cruel war is over. Mr. Woolley would
have filled all tho requirements in the
beginning, and now that the long defer
red honor rests upon his head, it is cer
taiu that ho will perform his duties ably
and impartially. Just who comes out
ahead is nncortain, but both sides seem
to Lave cordially shaken hands ovor the
sanguinary chasm.
Another election tqiulo by the council
at its last mooting was that of General
W. H. H. Beadle for member of the board
of education, to fill the vacancy
occasioned by the resignation of Itev.
Joseph Ward, of the fourth district.
General Beadle is pro emiucntly qualified
for tho placc and the excellent service of
noes
ird
Wo fully believe it would be better for
all interested to have the city charter so
amended as to make the mayor of the
city Hie presiding officer in the council.
Tliis consideration is his due and the
people are not liable to elcct a man as
the head of municipal affairs unless he
is qualified to perform this work.

Sent for by Baker Pasha.
Corporal Gephard Leberecht Blucher,
poBt schoolmaster at Fort McHenry, a
few days ago received from Baker
Pasha an offer of a position on his staff
to aid in the reorganization of the army
of the khedive of Egypt. Corporal
Blucher is a lineal descendant of the fa
mous Marshal Blucher, prince of Wahl
stadt, of Waterloo fame, after whom he
is named. He graduated at the universi
ties Bonn and Heidelberg. In 1865 he
entered the Prussian army as a second
lieutenant tin the first regiment of the
guards, and during the Austro-Prnssian
war was aid-de-camp on the staff of the
general commanding the seventh corps,
Subsequently he was chosen a military
attache of the German legation in
Egypt, and resided for a long time at
Rnmleh. While in Egypt he aoqoired
the Arabic tongue. In'1867 he was pro
moted to a first lieutenancy, and in the
Franco-Prussian war he again performed
the duties of aid-de-camp. During the
campaign he was appointed military ad
ministrator of the department of the
marine, which post he held until the
withdrawal of the Prussian army of oc
cupation. In 1880 ho quitted the army
and came to America. Sixteen months
ago he enlisted in the Second artillery as
schoolmaster. Corporal Blucher first
knew Baker Pasha when he was Captain
Valentine Baker.
Railroad Rates at St. Paul.
St. Paul Pioneer-PresH.
The cut-rate passenger business was
quite active yesterday, and a decided im
provement upon that of Saturday and
Sunday. PnsseDgers bought tickets for
all points. Tlio traffic was rather quiet
early in the day, but later it revived at
the assistant ticket offices. At the Union
depot there wns no rush, but a steady
demand that kept the boys fairly busy.
It was reported that the Albert Lea route
had made a change in its rates from Chi
cago to St. Paul. The rate of $1.00 from
Chicago to Chaska has been withdrawn.
The rate from Chicago to Albert Lea is
$1.00, and from Albert Lea to St. Paul
S5.25, making the rate for the whole trip
S5.25 instead of S2.20 via Chaska. What
effect this will have on Chicago travel
remains to be seen hereafter. Excur
sionists have gone to Chicago by the dol
lar route and return by the $2.20 route,
that is now a 55.25 one. In freight mat
ters, the Omaha line has advanced the
rate in grain and flour between St. Paul,
Minneapolis and Chicago, from 5c per
100 pounds to 7}£c per 100, which latter
is now the saaie as the cut-rates by the
Chicago, Milwaukee &St. Paul. Aside
from the above items, there have been
no other ehupges. Busines now isof the
routine order, and officials and agents
pursue their avocations as if there were
no such trifles as cuts.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
It Receives General Commendation In til.
Senate.
Washington, Dec. 1—The senators list
ened with great attention to the reading
of the president's message. It was very
generally commented upon as being vig
orous in style, bold in its recommenda
tions, and withal extremely temperate
and well timed. Like all of President
Arthur's public papers, it is regarded as
a masterpiece of composition and schol
arly writinr. The only adverse criticism
heard generally upon the republican side
of the houso was upon tho proposition
to abolish the tax on tobacco. Senators
Windom and Allison among others, ex,
pressed themselves as not in accord with
the message on this point. Senator
Logan said tho message was satisfactory
and indeed masterly. Senator Ingallsfc
in his incisive way said biusquely: "Tbe
tone of tho message is ambitious."
Taken AB a whole it was regarded by the
senate with satisfaction.
His views regarding civil service re
form, which have been outlined in these
dispatches, meet the views exactly of the
republican members. In fact, there is
not a single republican who dares to say
aught against the reform movement.
This statement is borne out to-day in the
proceedings of the honse, when as an
ticipated in these dispatches nearly a
week ago, a decisive step was taken in
the direction of legislation upon the sub
ject.
The president's views and recommen
dations in regard to politioal assessments
are also regarded as a good departure
from the old school.
As to his recommendations regarding
the reduction of taxation the drift of
sentiment among republicans is in exact
accord with them.
These three topics, civil service reform,
political assessments, and tax reduction,
including tariff revision, are regarded
tut tho three principal features of tbe
message, and are very highly commended
by senators au.l members of all parties.
In commenting in oonnootion with the
message upon tho president's recent ao-
tipn with reference to tho star-route
trials, the suggestion wae made by a
member this evening that President Ar
thur was evidently trying to build up
the shattered fortunes of the republican
party, and to reunite and harmonize the
elements into which the party has dis
solved. The liojw is expressed that this
is really the president's purpose.
Curious Humor*.
Washington special to New YorkSnn:
We are told that a petition is now quiet
ly circulated asking congress to repeal
so much of the appropriation bill for tbe
current year as makes the retirement of
General Sherman compulsory upon his
attaining the age of sixty-four. One of
the arguments in favor of this measure
is, that in esse of tbe retirement of Sher
man, as the law now provides, the com
mand of the army will devolve upon
Lieutenant-General Sheridan during
what may prove a critical presidential
campaign. The supposed hostility to
Sheridan on the part of tbe democratic
metnbeiB is the remembrance of his cele
brated banditti dispatch sent at the time
he was in command in New Orleans. On
the other hand, it is averred that a com
bination of the friends of- Sheridan and
Hancock will ask that the grades of gen
eral and lieutenant-general be revised—
the understanding being that Sheridan
shall be promoted to be general, and
Hancock to be lieutenant-general.
Others, who are inimical to both Sher
man and Sheridan, say that they prefer
that the former shall retire next year, as
the law now provides and when they
have elected a democratic president, as
thoy expect to do the following year,
should Sherman continue to be objec
tionable, they will revive the grade of
general, and promote Hancock to tbe
place and command of tho army. The
advocates of the latter course claim that
there would be ample justification for it
in the precedents established by Sheri
dan's own promotions. In 1864, when he
was promoted to be major-general, he
imped Hancock, who ranked him as a
rigadier and when in 1859, Grant made
him lieutenant-general, he over-slaughed
Halleck and Meade, although the former
was a full major-general before Sheridan
was even a major.
THE REGISTRY LAW.
A Protection Against Fraud—It Works
Well in a Mining Country.
Deadwood Times.
As this is a republican government,
where the will of the people is the law,
and as the will of the people can only
become known through their votes in
elections, it is of vital importance that
elections should be fair and honest.
We all kao what desperate and unscru
pulous politicians and factions are cap
aple of. It is a notorious fact that all
manner of crime and rascality has been
resorted to, to defeat the will of the
and secure victory for parties
'he oharge of corrnption and fraud can
not be laid at the door of any particu
lar party. clique, faction and
Everv
party in the land has'been guilty of it,
and some unfortunately, especially in
the great centers of population, depend
directly upon chicanery and such sharp
practice for their success. Men do not
comprehend the importance— the abso
lute saeredness, of their franchise, or
they would guard^it as their life and
honor, as the visible embodiment of
liberty and all that is good and glorious
for the down-trodden of p-11 lands. The
man who sells his vote is a renegade to
his race. Votes have been bought and
sold in open market, men have voted
time and again, falsely and illegally.
Repeating has become a profession.
The will of the people has been defeated
by fraud and this in a republic is the
unpardonable sin. Knowing thei psrils
tha't threaten the very existence of a
republic, we cannot be over cautious,
neither can we throw too many safe
guards, even though they may be incon
venient and vexatious, around the ballot,
to keepit pure and honest, to have it,
as it is intended to be, an expression of
the will of the people. The Kapid City
Journal takes exceptions, and as it ap
pears to us, without solid reasons to the
registry law passed two years ago for
the benefit o! the Black Hills counties.
The Journal knows that in the early days
unblushing frauds were perpetrated.
It was to prevent them that the registry
law was passed. As for the inconvenience
of the law, that is a childish arguement.
All laws are objectionable to evil doers.
If the law does not reach the evil, let it
be amended until it does. We -cannot
but think that fraudulent voting is an
evil, and that tbe present law
does in a measure remedy
it, the Journal to the contrary, notwith
standing. The Journal's argument does
not touch what might be regarded as
objeotionable in the act, but is a special
plea, reeking with demagoguery in aid
and comfort of every turncoat, bilk, and
repeater in the country. The Journal
complains of the inconvenience the law
causes. This is the truth, it is inconven
ient—it ia very inconvenient and per
haps wrong, according to the Journal's
logic, to have to go a mile, or perhaps, a
dozen miles, to vote, but if tho voter re
gards his right he does go, and should
also go and register.
"Eternal vigilance is the price of lib
erty," to which may be added a little
personal inconvenience, and perhaps
toil. Bat unfortunately, the eternal
laws are so arbitrary, we have no elevator
to hoist us into heaven, we must do
something" to get there. This nation
foandfreedom through hard knocks, aiul
can only keepit by guarding and work
ing for it. The Journal speaks of the
unjust workings of the law at Lead City.
The monopoly, corruption faction, at
tempted a swindle on the people but
lacked the brains to carry it out. A tool
of tbe monopoly, with unbounded appe
tite for dirty work, but with no sense to
speak of, attempted to fix up (he regis
try lists. The names of all men then
employed, or whoever had been employed
by the monopoly—the living, the dead,
the absent, the present, all were therein
recorded. Not in alphabetical order, as
the law commands, but in a jumble,
just as they appeared on the pay rolls.
The brilliant head and the brilliant tail
of this neat job wagged with joy, but it
didn't work, in tact, it was a boomerans,
which flew back and would have knocked
their brains out, had nature so furnished
them. Men had to stand at the polls
many minutes before their names could
be discovered and identified among the
confused jumble. By this means, the
trioksters ruined themselves through
their own stupidity.
The registry law does protect elections,
if it is observed. Let us retaiu this law,
and if need be, amend it. The people
want the law. Tho Pioneer copies the
Journal's article, with the the endorse
ment, "a sound articlo." Where sound

GOVERNOR ST. 10NN.
He Explains the OUM tT His Rcmnt
Dcfeit,
Chicago Tiaea.
tx-Gov. tit. John, of WAS
by a reporter for the Times last night
just alter he had finished his remarks in
tbe Grace Methodist Episcopal church.
Amid a hundred interruptions from peo
ple who claimed to hail from Kansas,
people who used to know bim when be
lived in Chicago, and people who wanted
to know him for the first time, the re
porter succeeded in ascertaining how the
great prohibitionist viewed the politioal
harizon. since he had become tbe under
participant in the fight "Governor,"
siid the reporter, "how do you and your
friends take the recent disaster to tbe re
publican party in Kansas?"
"Well, if yon mean how do I feel, I can
say that I was never happier in my life."
"I suppose the German and general
foreign vote was tbe main oause of your
defeat?"
"The foreign vote had nothing at all
to do with it. There are not six thousand
German votes in Kansas."
"What was tbe cause of your defeat?"
"Why it was caused by the oombined
effort of the entire liquor interests of the
country."
"How did the liquor interests work to
injure you
"They organized three hundred liquor
leagnes in Kansas. The influence of
these leagues was wide-spread. Nothing
was left undone by them which would
slander and vilify republicanism. The
republicans of the state were apathetie
daring the last eleetion. The democrats
were wide-awake, and the aim of the
liquor interests of the whole country was
to traduce me."
"Then the fight was not so much
against the republican party as it was
against St. John
"That's it, exactly. It was the
liquor
men's hatred of St. John that has made
Kansas a democratic state. In killing
me
off the liquor men felt revenged for the
impetus I had given to prohibitory con
stitutional amendments, and by striking
at me they thought a death blow would
be given to the prohibition movement
throughout the countiy."
"Has it been given
"Not at all by no means. The torn
perance question stronger in the
coun
try to-day than it ever was and this be
cause of my defeat in Kansas. The
defeat will unite the temperanee people
of this land The power and prinaplee
of the liqnor men have now been brought
to
light, and we will know how to meet
them. Temperance work and temperance
organization will be more thorough in
every part qf the country, and the liquor
interests will then be unable to single
out one man and one state upon which
to heap its vengence, but wfll have to
fight the solid front of many men and
many states. Let them try it.''
