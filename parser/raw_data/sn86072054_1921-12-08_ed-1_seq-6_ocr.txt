DESIRABLE LECISLA '/ /OA
. A FLEXIBLE tariff policy. and an industrial
* * tribunal have been the most discussed scggcstions
.. made by President Harding in his message to Con
gress. 1 he public recognizes and hails common sen:><
legislation where ever it appears, and the unanimous
v, agreement reilected in the press upon these two issue;
.}?. measures the need for both.
A fixed tariff rate which may have beer
. fair and just al the time oi its declaration may, in si>
months become under a developing change ol condi
? tions either over-taxation or undcMaxation with nc
means of relief. If a non-parti/.an. or a bi-partizai:
tariff commission, could be appointed by congress with
power to make such adjustments as occasion demanded
it is hardly necessary to point out that constant adjust
ment could be made in exact ratio to prevailing condi
tions, and there would be no waiting lor months for a
change that was justifiable immediately.
; While there may be objection irorn those who will
be wary of turning over the tariff policy either to a
JJ commission or to the executive, the proposition of Mr.
Harding's regarding an industrial tribunal, will find
- fewer dissenters. The fact that a somewhat similar
" court was able to ward off one ol the most threatening
strikes in the recent controversy between tl#s railroad
operators and their employees, demonstiates the
f" efficiency of such a body.
More and more the very necessities of life, are in
' i dangered by the strike. The recent milk strike which
affected millions of people and the meat strike which
. . is now in progress and whose effect is being shown in
?r* rioting, will serve to illustrate just how perilously the
" whole industrial world is balanced. When a group ol
workers or a combined group of workers can tie uj
the transportation of a nation, can cut off the food
- supply of the public, it is high time that there should
be some way of handling such situations other than
~ leaving it to an embittered, antagonistic body ol
employers and employees.
??' An industrial tribunal where each side may air
?Z. difficulties and get impartial attention, where abuse*
:;2v; may be ironed out while work proceeds as usual, i<
J. surely a better way to handle a situation wherein the
general public has always been the greatest fuffercr
T
.VOir TO MAKE GOOD
HERE may be some points about the hnglish
?i- * Irish Free State compact that will have to rcccive
further attention before becoming entirely satisfactory
? but the heralding of actual adjustment is sufficient tc
J make the very stars sing. The Sinn Fciners. according
v to report, are entirely pleased, and Ulster is to have
* one month in which to consider the Irish Free Stat<
*2? Dolicy and if not pleased she can withdraw to her for
mer status in .her relation tb'Englaiid and'her separate
boundaries will be definitely outlined.
Juit what difference can be read into (Wearing
allegiance to the king, and swearing to "be faithful to
His Majesty, the King" cannot be made out by the
average person, yet the sentence smacked of something
good to the Sinn Feiners, who balked consistently at
the oath of allegiance.
If the Irish Free State performs its duties as a
dominion as well and reliably as has Canada. Au
stralia and other dominions which have amply demon
strated their ability to engineer their own destinies, it
will not be many years before Ulster will be glad to
tear down the barriers and make of Ireland a whole
nation working In complete accord.
The thing to do now is to wipe out the past so
far as possible, and to build anew from the ground
up. Ireland has had a most stormy time, and is
seamed, and rive|. and cleft with dissention that only
time can erase, but there is complete assurance that
time will erase them, if given honest and faithful
assistance.
THE CONSORTIUM
AN E\V term has been creeping into news reports,
has been employed most frequently in the Wash
ington Conference discussion regarding foreign invest
ments in China. The word is "consortium" and its
meaning is obscure to most people. Because of lack
of understanding the term has aroused suspicion and
the "consortium" has been referred to as a term mean
ing dollar diplomacy.
In order to enlighten the public as to the consor
tium and its purpose the New York Tribune explains
i; in n lengthy editorial which says in part:
" The consortium ir, in the nature of a financial
league of peace- I he principal nations which have
eronomic and financial relations with China in times
past have been under constant temptation to compete
greedily for privileges?to their own injury and to the
dissatisfaction of China. To end this unwholesome
rivalry financial groups of the various nations said:
'I .ct each of us agiee to cease grabbing and henceforth
co-operate.' Hence the .consortium.
"Under governmental auspices hanking groups in
the United States. Great Britain. France and Japan
came together and at a gathering in New York on
October 1 5. 1020. adopted the consortium's consti
tution. This provided that the 'open door' principle
should be respected and that if China applied for
loan-, to cany through large economic developments
the application should not be to the financiers of par
ticular rountlies hut to the joint organization, which
would allot the appropriate participation to its mem
ber;. The financial statesmen were p. year ahead of
tSr oolitical tat."men in striking at the heart of the
Chinese problem."
o
If th?? Empire Fuel Company succeeeds in mak
ing the government give up that $f?7,000 oxcess
profit tax it will bo setting the wheels in motion for
a lot of hard thinking among some other coal com
panies around here. Companies that paid their
e::c(!is profits taxes with out much grumbling lu
those guy. glad days, wouldn't mind retrieving seme
of that easy money, now that the market has closed
up like a trap. Still, tho. getting money back from
the government usually costs 100 cents to the!
?"ollar. and that's that.
Six hundred American soldiers have arrived
from Germany, the first detach meat to be sent home?
from r.ccnpation service in that country. The men
brought back with them 73 German born wives and
habit*?, so that thorn will be several new classes in
Americanization started right away. It must be a
curious sensation to start a youth away in battle
array to subjugau an enemy, and have him return
to the family roof tree subjugated and accompanied
by the enemy.
Automobile manufacturers are indignant over
the blame that is being placed upon automobiles for
the- Increasingly numerous accidents that have been
recorded the past yoar. The men who are building
cars for the public claim that the automobile Itself
is a nearly perfect machine, and. in the hands of a
driver using ordinary care there would be no
danger. The blame for accidents and fatalities lies
with pedestrians, and bicyclists, and others who
misuse the highways, and with reckless and crim
inal drivers: There is ample, ground upon which to
base th:s plea. So machine is fool proof, and no
machine is responsible for the careless pedestrian
who deliberately, even though unintontially, com
mits suicide by walking in front of it.

placed in the county jail last
night by Special Constable J. E.
Masters of that city to await the

A TRIBUTE TO ANNA
I stand beside the glittering cas
ket
Banked with flowers of beauty
rare
Thoir fragrance wells from bloom
ing baskets.
And linger on the ambient air.
Shadows that disappointments'
cast.
To haloa turn when memory
breathes
Its sweetrtess on the buried past,'
And round it's tomb love's gnr-j
land wreathes.
At rest she peaceful slumbers;
here
Beneath a wilderness of flowers.;
Love's tribute to one held ho dear:
Hallows the sweetly solemn!
hours. j
Amid tho stillness sorrow born ;
A voice from somewhere seems 1
t o say? j
"Weep not. death's night is l>ut|
the morn I
That ushers in the golden day." ;
We mourn for those we cheerish
dear.
*TIs well, but brooding harbors
gloom.
Submission jewels sorrow's tear.
And. softens shadows thai dark
the tomb.
The body is of nature's mould.
It sleeps to walco to living
green.
The spirit hath a nobler goal.
Beyond the purple star flocked
screen.
Death's Angel. Mercy's messenp
er,
The racking pain forever stills.
The living are the sufferers,
And love the cup of sorrow fills.
Some sweet mysterious presence
here!
'Tis real as love, silent as
thought.
Maybe the soul still lingers near.
Who knows? And who can eay
it naught?
