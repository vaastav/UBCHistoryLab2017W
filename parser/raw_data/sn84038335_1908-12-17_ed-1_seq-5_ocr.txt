In an early day when Davy
Crockett was a memoer of
congress from Tennessee, and
John J. Crittinden, of Ken
tucky, and was at his zenith in
popularity, it so happened that
both Crockett and Crittinden
attended a "big show" in which
there was a very large baboon,
before which stood Mr. Crittin
den and Davy Crockett observ
ing him remarked, "I never
saw two persons favor each
other so much as this baboon
and Crittinden!" On seeing he
had made a blander, he re
marked, "If I knew which gen
tleman to offer an apology to I
certainly would do so."
This is the question now with
the president and congress if
it could be determined which is
entitled to an apology for the
discourtesy—Roosevelt or con
gress—it certainly should be
tendered. The message of the
president is certainly a little
out of the ordinary way of ad
dressing the Congress of the
United States by a president,
but we must remember that
we have had but one Roosevelt.

Drainage Ditch
Matter In Court
An effort was made by the
attorneys for the Harrison
Potiawattamie drainage board
to bring up for hearing yester
day the question of dissolving
an injunction secured by sev
ex-al property owners along the
drainage ditch, by which the
boat is restrained from pay
ing the contractors, the West
ern Dredging company, the per
centage withheld for the com
pletion of the contract. The
attorneys for the petitioners,
however, said they were not
ready for trial and would not
be until they could have an en
gineer inspect the work and
see if it has been completed ac
cording to contract, and Judge
Green allowed the hearing to
go over until the first day of
court in Harrison coumty.
About $1,700 is withheld
from the contractors by this
action of the court, and it was
stated by W. H. Killpack, rep
resenting the board, that about
$1,200 of this is on the Boyer
cut off No. 1 and Boyer cut off
No. 2 of the completion of
which he thought there could
be no question. He said the
principal controversy was with
reference to the Willow creek
ditch, and that even if the
money should be withheld on
that work there should be a re
lease of the funds withheld on
the other ditches.
The attorneys for the peti
tioners contend that the whole
is one contract with one com
pany and that the separate
items, and that unless the en
tire system is Lie in good
working on! •. 10 part of the
percentage withheld under the
contract should be paid. It
was further stated to the court
that if there were to be a re
lease on the part held on the
cut off ditches the contractor
would probably forfeit the re
mainder, as it was believed he
could better afford to do this
than complete the work accord
ing to the specifications.—Non
