eollugo , delivured his Icuturu , "Social
Inequalities , and Uiuir Uomudics. " It
was tlui first cUbrt of the trcntloman cm
the platform in this city and iUurvedasa
very happy introduction , because it
brought to the attention of the pcoplo a
man who inny bo esteemed as an orator
possibly without a peer , and certainly
without a superior in this city , lie spoke
in Mibstanco aa follows :
"At a time like the present , when
social di&eontout is deep-seated , wide
spread and ominous ; when many are disj
contented with thuir lot and when the
principle of einiallty lias run its ground
On the trite , but self-contradictory maxim
that one man is as good as another and
'n great deal better,1 it is worth while to
consider what society has done , or what
it has failed to do to elevate and ennoble
the laboring man. The very atmosphere
is thick with wild and visioiiary .schemes
for elevating the working classes and
every saloon is a rostrum for theories ,
vain and deccitlul , sot forth by men who
have not mustered their first principles.
Kvery now. political agitation is
leavened with hypocritical professions
of logard for the toiler ; uvory ambitions
sychopant hones to ride to preferment
over tno workingman. and every politi
cian is making capital out of the tiillbr-
dices which have ufi&en between the em
ployer and employed , and which have so
Ircquontly resulted in riot ? which liuvo
ended in the lamentable destruction of
property. I'rom every side the wage-
worker is pushing the attack. From
every point of view he is computing how
labor may bo protected fiqm being
crushed by the pitiless power of mono
poly. Certainly , lio\yoyjr , the toiler will
not bot.tor his conditiuii by giving him
self over to the. leadership of commun
ists and socialists , who f > how him only
the humiliating and degrading side of
his fate ; who put into his hand the sword
and dynapiito with the hope that , \yhou
disorder hab made pillage possible , he will
reap the reward , i'hcy diu not benefit
your follqw-meu yesterday , and they will
not benefit you in tlic future ; they will
make them pay tiio inevitable penalty
of such aii unholy leadership.
The speaker then paid a uril-
liunt tribute to the church , which
bo landed as the church of the poor , and
illiterate whom it had never rejected , and
plcaso l' ° ( li which would never bo rejected
by them. Ho iJjPu quoted from a letter
of Bishop Potter'ln reply iC OPP Mmt gen
tleman had received , which mdiiceu n
graphic description of the poor and lowly
in the tenement districts of Now York ,
lie stood there , he said , between the cap
italists and monopolists on one side try
ing to crush out tlio life of their victims ;
aii'l , on tliu other , the laborer , seeking
vainly under self-appointed socialistic
nnd communistic leaders , to grasp his
rights from those wiio denied them to
him. The leotuicr then made reference
to the condition of labor ut the dawn of
Christianity , and how , under the bcnoli-
cnnt inlluonco exerted by the power
which had overthrown paganism , the
dignity of labor had been ollecteil ,
Tins was followed by contrasting
the condition of labor at the
present time , and incidentally
referring to the achievements of science
which he claimed could make a false eye ,
Insert a false tympanum which almost
equaled that of nature , grafted flesh
which adhprcd to the body , and trans
fused blood which poured through the
voinfi , oven going so far , ho fcareU , as to
create a false heart , And yet , all these
discoveries had been imulo by labor and
toil. Christianity raised man higher than
ho had been in pngnn times. Ho did not
enter into the question whether it was
wi.se for man to begrasmng after wealth ,
but ho took it as a fact Unit tliu command
of Ciod wan verified that a man must earn
his bread by the sweat of his brow. Is it
surprising therefore that without ( Jed the
laborer whould be asking himself why
should lie be tolling while others are en
joying the fruits of hie ) toil ? Why should
4lie many bo made use of for the advan
tage of the fmvv Why is it that all can
not bo upon a perfect equality ?
The workimrmim asked that ques
tion when ho suw men idle
through no fault of their own , but
through the reckless speculation of
others. Ho asked that question of the
father with 1)0 ) cents a day on which ho
has supported himself and family. Ho
asked it us ho saw the poor people hud
dled together in kennels , buffering In
poverty and lifted up to dciislon like
sDoils upon a bloody spear. It was a fact
that there WIIH a gulf between wealth and
Dovurty nnd that that gulf WIIH continu
ally widening , The poor were getting
poorer and the rich getting richer. Ami
yet , that \ \ as imttho necessary or imtur.il
result of the evil accumulation of wealth.
It WUH owing to the fact that unjust
means were mndo use of In acquiring
wealth and that iini'uir nnd unjust use
vvus mudo ot wealth when it was ac
quired , It was easy to lay bare the wound
that lay on the social body but it was jiot
so easy to give the romcdy. Henry
George , nnd others who stand on the.'plat-
form with him , thinks that wholcQtroublo
conies from the private owner
ship of land , and that , oncu that evil is
removed , nil will go wnll.
Tim speaker then suininnri/eil George's
alleged philosopy that them can bo no
such tiling as piopcrty in hind , undUmt
there Is no power on pal th that can elvo
a valid and legitimate title to ownership
in land. Man possesses man : ho belonges
to himself , and has a right to the use of
lu.s faculties and what his faculties pro
duce. It thlb wcro true , as man cannot
innle or pioilticc land , ho cannot , thero-
foio acqimo title to land , and if ho does
acquire it , ho robs others. Tlie dilHciilty
with George's theory is that it is un
just , not permanent , umUf ho goes thus
far , it was noeoosury for him to go still
fai HUT , It is not true thut man belongs
to man. Ho belongs to God , Ids creator.
Hut , even if he did Belong to hiinxelf , he
would be compelled to lay aside all claim
to personal property ns well as rpal
estate , because the substance of pet'boiuil
property comes from the earth and is not
nmlo by man , ,
The spanker then referred to the
fallacy of the equality of'ovury indi
vidual , and the impossibility of equal
distiibution of the laud , exemplifying
the propositipu by several forcible Hlus-
( jauuiia , Ho Hum /spoL'e / about the iiliw
of repression ascnuuciatvil by the capital
ist , and hold that whUo the principle
necessitated and employed force through
out the world , that WRS hot ! remedy for
the inequalities mentioned. Repression
failing , education vfnt suggested , but
education of the kind sitggcstcd , was not
what would nmlillornto the con
dition of the musses , Incidentally ,
the speaker mudo * n masterly
reference to the doctrines Inculcated by
Inncrsoll , his stvlo , his lack of logic , his
Hllbcrnllsiu. nnd the failure of his preach
ing to satisfy the poorer classes , who
wcro unable to enjoy the religion of good-
living. plenty and comfort FO landed by
the in ( idol. Ho closed with the statement

After looking over the whole field , the
speaker saw no hope iu society ,
in either repression , or educa
tion without religion. Ho saw no hope
in lectures on socialism or communism.
Ho saw no hope in those means suggested
in the president's message , arbitration ,
legislation and co-oporation. lie saw no
hope in the general diffusion of the prin
ciple of equality. Ho saw It only in
Christianity and in the principles It lays
down. It was Christianity which was to
ri'dncm society as it did l',800 , years ago.
Christianity was to remove the modern
paganism which was infesting the world-
Christianity that taught chanty to all. To
gain all these things they needed more of
tno gospel of Christ and less of Henry
George.

TUB THIIID DAY'S WOKK.
The IHonmrkablo Itcconl or the Ii-
cyclists at the Imposition.
The bicycle race at the exposition
building furnished some magnificent ex
hibitions of good riding yesterday. All
the men were in goo'd shape and rode
without any breaking down. Dlngloy ,
who on the day before threatened to col
lapse , pulled himself together and did
some magnificent work. Bullock also
held out well , and Is doing remarkably
considering the experience and training
lie jias had. Prince , as usual , cut out the
pace , with Schock pushing him harden
on ids spurts of speed ,
The attendance last night was not
nearly what it should have been. There
ought to be 3,000 people in the building
every jlay. ft is a pity that Omaha people
ple don't Uuow a good thing when they
have it.
At 10:30 : last night the score stood :
Prince , IJflO miles , 3 laps ; Dlngloy ! ! 88
miles , 5 laps ; Schock. 8SO miles , 5 laps ;
Uardwickc , D71 miles , 1 lap ; Bullock , iMfi
milcn , 2 IHPS. The score iu detail was as
follows :

Some world-beating work lias been
done at this tournament. Last night it
was announced that Piincc had covered
the fust ! ! 7."i milca in 24 hours. The
world's record for this distance was
made by Morgan in Minneapolis a few
weeks ago , this being 37C miles in twenty-
four hours. As Prince in that lime
covered 8)0 ! ) miles , ho has beaten all pre
vious records by 10 miles.
Another remarkable thing about this
race is that it is the lirst 0110 on record in
which all the contestants have stuck to
tno'r ' wheels the third day , barring accid
ents. _

CHANGING TJIB CIMUTIill.
Tlie TAX Question Demands the At
tention of the Committee.
The committee on the proposed amend
ments to the city charter continued their
work yesterday afternoon continuing the
discussion of section 70 , providing for the
levying of the various city taxes. The
city treasurer's statement was presented ,
showing the assessed valuation of prop
erty in the city for the year 1880 to bo
$12,000,000 , wlnlo its real value was in
excess ot $100,000,000 , and that the total
indebtedness of the city on December 1 ,
1830 , was about $1,000,000. , , Councilman
Lee proposed to confer the power on the
city to loy.y a tax for gone-rat purposes of
twenty mills on the dollar , which is eight
mills in excess of the maximum per cent ,
which may bo levied under the present
chatter. Mr. Crcigliton thought this
would bo an exorbitant levy and declared
himself as strongly opposed to it. lie
said the conferring of a power to levy
such a tax \yould defeat the very object
for which itrus intended , namely , the
growth and improvement of the city.
City Attorney Council stated ( hutwhile ,
the pioposed raise of the rate ot taxation
for general purposes , from twelve mills
on the dollar to twenty , might bo exces

was entirely inadequate To supply the
fund and the city council , in older < o
entry on the improvements which had
been made during the past year , auil
which were only a small porportion of
what the pcoplo had asked for , had been
oblidgeit to contract indebtedness sev
eral thousand dollars in excess of the
amount furnished by the twelve mill
levy , A lengthy discussion followed be
tween Mr. Poppleton and the city attor
ney on the right of the city to contract
debt inc.xcess of funds on nand. It was
finally decided upon a perceiitngo of
levee for the general fund was fixed at
fourteen mill , and for the maintenance
of sewers at one-half mill , while the rate
of tuMition for maintaining curbs , gtt- )
teis and pavements was reduced from
four to three mills. The levy for main
taining the policy department was raised
fropi one and one-halt to five mills , and
that for keeping Up the fire department
