ARABI'S SENTENCE.
Arabi Pasha haa escaped with a sentence
of banishment, which, under the circum
stances, is almost equivalent to a free
pardon. This termination at his trial
appears to have been largely caused
by the embarrassment into which the
English Government had been forced
by its anomalous position in regard
to the prisoner. It is, however, very ques
tionable whether the Khedive's method
V ould not have been the best. The Egypt
ians will not understand the clemency ex
hibited, or else they will understand it too
well. The truth appears to be that the
trial could not have been carried on pub
licly without producing developments
which would have injured the Sultan and
X hedive. It is true that no consideration
of this kind ought to have interfered, be
cauße the Sultan and the Khedive are
both distinguished humbugs, who are
quite incapable of doing anything which is
not inherently discreditable. Bat Eng
land has for a long time thought it neces
sary for the protection of her interests to
make-believe that these Asiatic im
postors were respectable rulers, and she is
not willing to have the "seamy side" of
her foreign policy exposed to all the world.
So it was found necessary to let Arabi off
lightly, and be, who is as big a blackguard
as either the Sultan or Khedive, and would
cat either of their throats cheerfully if he
saw any profit to himself in the operation,
will now go to Europe, and probably be
lionieed for a eeason, and then proceed to
intrigue and cabal against the Egyptian
Government. It would have been much
better to let the Khedivo deal with him.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The President's Message, which we pub
lish this morning, is a basinets-like docu
ment, md crammed with references, sugges
tions, and more positive recommendationi,
in regard to a great number of subjects. It |
illuatrateß, as inueed every document of I
the kind must do more and more, the rap
illy increasing Ecnpe and complexity of the
Government of the United States. In
fact, Presidential messages in these days
are becoming recapitulations of the reports
of the heads of departments more than
anything else, aod they are cumbrous
because of the extent of the ground they
have to cover. A mere glance at the sub
jects treated of in this message will indi
cate its heterogeneous contents. It begins
with the assnrance that cur foreign rela
tions are on a satisfactory basis. It refers
to the Nicaragua canal question and the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty ; states that remon
strances addressed to the liuseian Govern
ment regarding the persecution of the Jews
have been received courteously ; suggests
that more power be given the Executive to
deal with propositions for International
Conferences on various matters ; speaks of
trouble with Spain about consular fees ;
states that Germany hes invited the United
States to take part in an Exhibition next
year, and refers the matter to Congress ;
pays a pasting tribute to the late United
States Minister, G. P. Marsh ; Btates that
the Swiss Government has taken steps to
prevent the emigration to this country of
pauperß and criminals ; gives Congre.s a
mild reminder tbat it is time the Japanese
Indemnity matter was settled : refers to
the Chinese claim for transit through the
country under the new law, and indicates a
belief that they ahould not be excluded ;
briefly discusses the Hawaiian Treaty, with
hints looking towards ita modification ;
commends the Mexican Boundary question
to Congress, and proposes a Commission
to deal with it ; reviews the Chile-Peruvian
war, and expresses the opinion that owing
to the obstinacy of the Chilean Govern
ment it is useless for the United States to
attempt any further intercession ; politely
pooh-poohß Mr. Blame's Peace Congress ;
suggests legislation to harmonize the
United States with other nations in regard
to rules for collisions at sea, and for an
agreement upon eomo general method de
termining the latitude and longitude, and
regulating time ; approves the proposition
for putting all diplomatic officers upon
salaries and covering fees into the treasury;
and so forth, almost ad infinitum.
Of the more weighty and interesting
matters which are topics of general die
cussion the President has also something
to say. He agrees with the Secretary of
the Treasary in recommending a considera
ble reduction of revenues. He is in favor
of abolishing all internal revenue taxes ex
cept those oa distilled spirits, malt liquors
and tobacco, which would cut off about
5J0.000.000, and leave about * ( .»5, 000, 000 of
revenue. He urges the necessity of re
vising the tariff, and, though he disclaims
any desire to do away with protective du
ties, he thinks the moreartbles can be put on
the free list the better it will be. He calls
attention to the s.lver coinage, recommend
ing its suspension. He discusses the iiuan
cial question, coinciding with Secretary
Folger in deprecating the too rapid liquida
tion of the public debt, and pointing out
the dangers which must arise if our
immense surplus continues to bo raised,
and a considerable part of it is applied to
this work. His views on these two ques
tions arc conservative and judicious, and
indicate personal examination of it. In
regard to the tariff, he somewhat curiously
thinks Congress will derive enlightenment
from the labors of the Tariff Commission.
This shows that the President is of a very
sanguine and confiding nature. His own
views, however, are such as Congress
could very well afford to accept as its
guide in the premises, for he is emphatic
in behalf of a thorough revision and a very
considerable reduction of duties. We
judge from his representations in this re
gard that President Arthur is well fitted to
become an active member of the Cobden
Club, if he does not already belong to that
institution.
In referring to the report of the Secre
tary of War, he speaks of the urgent need
for better fortifications on the Pacific, char
acterizing those now existing as utterly
useless, and expressing a hope that Con
gress will attend to this important matter.
Some space is given to the question of the
retirement of army officers, whicn is evi
dently a tangled subject, and it is recom
mended that more attention be paid to the
arming of the State militia. Tae river
and harbor appropriation bill affords him
an opportunity to propose an amendment
to the United States Constitution, allowing
the Executive to veto separate items in ap
propriation bills, in accordance with the
principle already incorporated into fourteen
State Constitutions, among which that of
California is numbered. This is certainly
a very judicious proposal, and it is clear
that if adopted it will have a most whole
some deterrent fiiect, and enable the Presi
dent to nip many a flagrant job in the
bud. The paragraphs relating to the Navy
are somewhat melancholy. The President
evidently feels that there is wry little to
be said on this aubject, and he refers al
most sarcastically to " such vessels as we
"possess." In connection with this he
discusses the decline of our mercantile
marine, but his ideas en that matter do
not appear to have been thoroughly
digested. He however recommends the
reconstruction of the Navy in conformity
! with the proposals of the Advisory Board.
Hia review of the Postal Department ia
made the vehicle for an argument in favor
of the redaction of domestic letter postage.
He urges this measure with a good deal of
enthusiasm, and refers to the experience of
England to show that it is certain to pay.
The Postal service in fact is already be
coming a paying institution, and in a few
years, at the present rate of progress, will
return a large revenue. The views of the
President upon Civil Service reform w ill be
received with satisfaction by tha country
generally. He takes bold and positive
grouuJ on behalf of reform, and expresses
himself in the clearest manner. He de
clares himself in favor of abolition of the
spoils system, establishment of genuine
competition, permanence of tenure, and the
extinction of ciEciai patronage altogether.
He says that experience has convinced him
of the necessity of relieving the Executive
from the intolerable burden of appoint
ment making. In fact he speaki on this
subject as every President since Lincoln
has spoken. On the subject of Political
Assessments he is equally frank and thor
ough-going. He is for the abolition of the
system, and he admits the troth of all that
has been urged against it. It is perhaps
unnecessary to inquire whether the recent
elections have had anything to do with the
positiveness of the President's expressions
on these topics. It is enough to know that
he has by this last message committed him
self fairly and fully to the approval of the
most sweeping reforms that Congress can
be eot to p»". Oi the Tinrp imwwlautfcl
question*, therefore, that is to say, the
tariff, finance, coinage, civil service reform,
a id political assessments, the President has
placed himself fully abreast of the most ad
vanced thought of the time, and if Con
gress is only able and willing to follow him
in this intrepid policy there n no telling
\ what reaction it may not eet ap.
FOUL PLAY.
The American clipper ship Joseph S.
Pinney, from Havre to San Francisco, in
ballast, had a strange experience while on
her way out. Oa sounding the pumps one
morning in the North Atlantic, she was
found to be making water fast. All hands
were sent to the pumps, and after working
through the night the water in the hold
was so reduced that it became possible to
make an examination. And then it was
discovered that a deliberate attempt had
been made to scuttle the ship. Three
auger holes had been bored in the bows,
and the author of the mischief had care
fully plugged the holes through the skin,
bo that it should not be possible to detect
what had been done until it was too late.
Oi course the discovery of the leak saved
the Bhip, for it waa easily stopped. But
all the Captain's efforts to find oat who
committed the crime proved fruitless. It
waß a horrible deed, and especially bo be
cause the Captain's wife and family were
on board. The case recalls Charles l^ade'a
Btory " Foul Play," in which the mate of
the vessel plays exactly the same trick,
but is more Buccossful. In this instance,
however, it is diffi;ult to asekn a motive
for the crime, and it mußt be remembered
that the man who committed it took his
chances of going to the bottom with the
ship, or of undergoing all the sufferings
which shipwrecked people are exposed to.
It seems very improbable that the criminal
will be discovered cow that the crew have
I all dispersed, but the man who could do
I such a thing must certainly be a very sin
gular kind of scoundrel.

San Johe, December 4th. — This afternoon
at 2 o'clock tho large frame warehouse near
the S )utheru Pacific Iliilroad depot, owned
by Berry k Evans, of tbij city, containing;
absjut 1,!)00 tons of hay, was, together with
its contents, totally destroyed by tire. The
hay wa§ valued at $lti per ton, and wa« in
sured at $10 per ton to tho amount of SlB,
--509, including §2,000 on the building. The
I insurance is divided between more than a
dczen companies, none carrying more than
81,000. Owing to the distance from water
the fire department did not go i:.t > Bervice.
While the Empire steamer was beirg driven
to the above Muz?, the driver, Mike Canao,
in attempting to avoid a ccl'i-i n wiih a
bugsy, had the wheel of the engine catch in
the turn-off of the street railroad track at the
corner of Second and Santa Clara street*,
was thrown off, and very badly icj ired
about the head. The team then ten away,
and in turnirg from Santa Clara into Fimt
street upset the engine and badly wrecked it.
This checked their career, and probably
saved a number of lives, aa the street wag

The cabin of an old bachelor earned Wil
son, a resident of the Puyallnp Vuliey for
the last fifteen years, was entered last Satur
'la7 n 'Kht by a person unknown, who beat
Wilson with a club until he thought him
dead, and then robbed the house tf all its
contents of value. The extent of the loss is
unknown. M ilson had just sold hia farm,
and was supposed to have a good
deal of money, ard the desire to get this
money was undoubtedly the obj»ct of tie at
tempted murder. WiUon was alive at la it
accouots, but the chanc?* for recovery wir3
strongly against him. A man named Burke
has been arrested on smpicioo, and the evi
dence against him is of a strong circum
stantial charae'er. A Viglance Committee
was organized iv the valley, »nd threats of
hanging are freely made in cisc of the cri-xe
being traced to Burke.
