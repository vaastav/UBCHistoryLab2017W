"I tbink," said I, "it's the most ex

Haflles smiled.
"Not quite all that. Bunny; still,

that's it!"
And be was gone before a double
knock on the outer door had done ring
ing through the rooms, to return next
minute with au open telegram and a
face full of news.
"What do you think?" said he. "Se
curity's that fellow Addeubrooke, the
police court lawyer, and he wants to
see me instantor!"
"Do you know him, then?"
"Merely by repute. I only hope he
doesn't know me. lie's tha ch ip who
got six weeks for sailing too close to
the wind in rue Sutton-Wilmer case.
Everybody wondered why he wasn't
struck oif the rolls. Instead of that
lie's got a last rate practice on the
seamy side, and every blackguard with
half a case lakes it straight to Bennett
Addenbro'ske. lie's probably the one
man who would have the-cheek to put
tn an advertisement like that, and the
one man who could do it without ex
citing suspicion. It's simply in bis
line, but you may bo sure there's some
thing shady at the bottom of it. The
odd thin,' is (hat I have long made up
my mind to g 1o Addeubrooke myself

"And you're .oh.g to him now?"
"This Minute," said Baffles, brushing
his hat, "Mid i o are you."
"But I came in to drag you out to

"You Khali 1 inch with me when we've
Been this f-l'ow. Come on. Bunny,

Mr. Bennett Addeubrooke occupied
ubstautial ofiices iu Wellington street.
Strand, an J was out when we arrived,
but he bad only just gone "over the
way to (tie ouit," and live inmates
sufficed to pie luce a brisk, fresh col
ored, rcso'a'u ' y king man, with a very
confident, rather festive air rud black
eyes that opened vide at il;e sight of
Rallies.
"Mr Cilasspool':"' exclaimed the law
yer. "My nr. me," said Bailies with dry
effrontery.
"X'it up ;t bor-l's. however!" said
the other slyly. "My dear sir, 1 have
seen you lake far too many wickets to
make any mistake!''
For a single moment Hallles looked
Venomous. Then he shrugged and
smiled, a: id tin- smile grew Into a little
cynical chuckle.
"So you have bowled me out in my
turn?" Baid he. "Well, 1 don't think
there's anything to explain. I am
harder up than I wished to admit un
der my own name, that's all, and I
want1 that 1.000 reward."
"Two thousand," said the solicitor.
"And the man who Is not above an
alias happens to be just the sort of
man I want, so don't let that worry
you, my dear sir. The matter, how
ever, Is of a strU tly private and confi
dential character." And he looked
very bard at me.
"Quite so," snld Baffles. "But Uiero
was something about a risk?"
"A certain vh,i Is "nv.-lved."
"Then surely three heads will be bet

1.000; my friend here wants the other.

We are both cursedly hard up, and we
go into this thing together or not at
all. Must you have bis name too? I
should give hirn my real one, Bunny."
Mr. Addenbrooke raised bis eyebrows
over the card I found for him; then he
drummed upon it with his finger nail,
and bis embarrassment expressed It
self In a puzzled smile.

I rather intended to appeal to the er

"We are adventurers," said Raffles
gravely.
"But you respect the law?"
The black eyes gleamed shrewdly.
"We are not professional rogues, if
that's what yoir mean," said Baffles,
smiling. "But on our beam ends we
are. We would do a good deal for
1,000 apiece, eh, Bunny?"
"Anything," I murmured.
The solicitor rapped bis desk.
"I'll tell you wnat I want you to do.
You can but refuse. It's illegal, but it's
illegality in a good cause. That's the
risk, and my client is prepared to pay

"I I. now his son," I remarked.
Rallies knew him, too, but said noth

The lawyer drew his chair nearer

on i-idier kii'-e;
"Cn Tuesday of last week I bad a

President Roosevelt's annual message
has been delivered to congress, open
ing with a plea for the co-opera lion of
all classes In continuing the country's
(prosperity and. in correcting existing
evils, for a "square deal" for every
body, the message first takes up the
question of corporations and railroad
rate legislation. The president says:
Coriiornllone.
I am in no sense hostile to corpora
tions. This Is an age of combination,
and any effort to prevent all combina
tion will be not only useless, but In the
end vicious, because of the contempt
for law which the failure to enforce j
law Inevitably produces. The corpora
tion has come to stay, just as the
.trades union has come to stay. Each
can do and has done great good. Each
should be favored so long as it does
good. But each should be sharply
checked where it acts against law and
Justice.
Experience has shown conclusively
that it Is useless to try to got m.y ade
quate regulation r.n-l f.."-i.-'-. of
these great corporations by state ac
tual. Such regulation and supervision
can only be effectively exercise; by a
sovereign whose jurisdiction is coex
tensive with (he Col 1 work of the cor
porationsthat Is. by the national g.iv
ornhieut. I believe that this re-gelation
and supervision can be obtained by the
enactment of law by the congress. If
this proves Impossible, It will certainly
be necessary ultimately to confer in
fullest form such Jpowcr upon the na
tional government by affirmative ae
ment of (he constitution.
The laws of (he congress and of the
several statot hitherto, as passed upon
by the courts, have resulted more often
in showing that the states have no
power In the matter than that t'.ie na
tional government has power; si that
there at present exists a very uiiforfu
iiate condition of things, under which
these great corporations doing an in
terstate business occupy the po -.i;i i:i of
subjects without a sovereign, neither

Railroad Hate Legislation.
As I said in my message, of .Dec. (1
last, the immediate and most pressing
need so far as legislation is coaceined
is the enactment into law of some
scheme to secure to the agents of the
government such supervision and regu
lation of the rates charged by the rail
roads of the country engaged in inter
state traflic as shall summarily and ef
fectively prevent the Imposition of un
just or unreasonable rates. It must
include putting a complete stop to re
bates in every shape and form. This
power to regulate, rates, like all similar
powers over (he business world, ihiuU

(his power to establish a maximum
rate as being essential to any scheme
of real reform in the matter of railway
regulation.
It is worth while considering whether
It would not be wise to confer on the
government (he right of civil action
against (he beneficiary of a rebate for
at least twice the value of the rebate.
This would help stop what is really
blackmail. Elevator allowances should
be stopped, for they have now grown
to such an extent that they are demor
J'i::!ng and are used as rebates.
Private Car Linen.
All private car lines, Industrial roads,
refrigerator charges and the like
.should be 'expressly put under the su
I)ei vision of the Interstate commerce
commission or some similar body so
far as n-t-.n and agreements practical
ly affecting rates are concerned. A re
bate in icing charges or in mileage or In
a division of the rate for refrigerating
charges Is just as pernicious as a re
bate in any other way.
There should be publicity of the ac
counts or common carriers. Only In
this way can violations or evasions of
the law be surely detected. A system
of examination of railroad accounts
should be provided similar, to that now
conducted into the national banks by
the bank examiners. A few lirst class
railroad accountants, If they had prop
er direction and proper authority to in
spect books and papers, could accom
plish much In preventing willful viola
tions of the law.

In my last annual message for an in
vestigation by the department of com
merce and labor of general labor condi
tions, especial attention to be paid to
the conditions of child labor and child
labor legislation in the several states.
Such an investigation should take into
account the various problems with
which . the question of c hild labor is
connected. In such a republic as ours
the one thing that we cannot afford to
neglect is the problenl of turning out
decent citizens. The future of the na
tion depends upon the citizenship of
the generations to come. The children
of today are those who tomorrow will
shape the destiny of our land, and we
cannot afford to neglect them. The leg
islature of Colorado has recommended
that the national government provide
some general measure for the protec
tion from abuse of children and dumb
animals throughout the United States.
I lay the matter before you for what I
trust will be your favorable consider
ation. An to Women Who Work.
The department of commerce and la
bor should also make a thorough inves

industry. Over 5,000,000 American wo
men are now engaged in gainful occu
pations, yet (here is an alnlost complete
dearth of data upon which to base any
trustworthy conclusions as regards a

with less friction and e s harmful ef

case. This whole mailer In' reality
forms one of the greatest sociological
phenomena of our time. It is a social
question of the first import mice, of far
greater Importance than any merely po
litical or economic question can be.
In any great labor disturbance not
only are employer and employee inter
ested, but also a third party the gen
eral public. Every considerable labor
diilk ulty in which interstate commerce
is involved should bo .investigated by
the government and the facts officially
repoVted to the public. .
TtiNtii-nnce.
The gi-Ojiit Insurance companies afford
striking examples of corporations
whose business has extended so far
beyond the jurisdiction of the states
which created them as to preclude
strict enforcement of r-- .t-!i-, r,j
regulation by the parent states. In my
last annual message I recommended
"that the congress carefully consider
whether the power of the bureau of
corporations cannot constitutionally be
extended to cover Interstate transac
tions In insorar.ee." He-.-oqt events
have emphasised the importance of an
early and exhaustive consideration of
this question, to see whether it is not
possible to furnish better safeguards
than the several states have been able
to furnidi against corruption of the
flagrant kind which has been exposed.
It has been only too clearly shown
that certain of the men at the head of
these large corporations lake but small
note of the ethical distinction between
lionosty and dishonesty. They draw
flie line only this side of what may be
called law honesty, the kind of honesty
necessary in order to avoid falling into
the clutches of the law. Of course the
wily complete remedy for this condi
tion must be found in an aroused pub
lic conscience, a higher sense of ethical
conduct in the community at largo and
especially among business men and in
the great profession of the law. and in
the growth of a spirit which condemns
all dishonesty, whether la i-h-b man or
! pi poor man, whether it takes (he shape
of bribery or of blackmail. But much
can be done by legislation which is not
only drastic, but practical. There is
ue.-d of a far stricter and more uni
form regulation of the vast insurance
interests of tins' country. Ihe United
('tares should In th!-; reject follow the
policy of oilier nations by providing
adequate n.Ui.rm.l supervision of com
mercial interests which are clearly r.a
1 oual in character.
I repeat my previous recommenda
tion that the congress should consider
whether (he federal government has
any power or owes any duty with re
spect to domestic transactions in in
surance of an interstate character.
That state su'icrvision has proved In
adequate is generally conceded.
The Revenues.
There is more need of stability than
of b.e attempt to attain an ideal per
fection iu the methods of raising rev
enue, and the shock and strain to the
business world ccitain to attend any
serious change In these methods ren
der such change inadvisable unless for
grave reason. It in not possible to lay
down any general rule by which to de
termine the moni'-at when the reasons
for will outweigh the reasons against
such a change. Xo change can be
made on lines beneficial to or desired
by one section or one state only. There
must be something like a general agree
ment among the citir.et.s of (he several
states that the change is needed and
desired in the interest of the people as a
whole, and (here should then be a sin
cere. Intelligent and disinterested ef
fort to make it in such shape as will
combine, so far as possible, the niaxi
n r.'.n of gjj.i to tire people at large
wiili the minimum of necessary disre
gard for the special interests of locali
ties or classes, but In time of peace
the revenue must, on the average,
taking a serir-; of years together, equal
tha expenditures or else the revenues
must be increased. Hast year there
was a deficit. Unless our expenditures
can be kept within the revenues then
our revenue laws must be readjusted.
It is Impassible to outline what shape
s'.-.ch a readjustment shou! 1 take, for
it is as yet too early to say whether
there will be need for it. It should ba
considered whether it is not desirable
that the tarlf" laws should provide for
applying as against or in favor of any
of e- nation maximum and minimum
tari:? rr(es established by the congress,
so as to secure a certain reciprocity of
tre itment between other nations and
ourselves.

Every consideration of prudence de
mands the addition of the element of
elasticity to our currency system. The
evil does not consist In an Inadequate
volume of money, but In the rigidity
of tills volume, which does not respond
as it should to the varying needs of
communities tuul of seasons. Inflation
must be avoided, but some provision
should be made that will Insure a
larger volume of money during the fall

protect the integrity of the elections of
its own otlicials Is Inherent and has
been recognized and affirmed by re
peated declarations of the supreme
court. The e is no enemy of free gov
ernment more dangerous and none so
Inridioue, as the corruption of (ho elect
orate. Xo one defends or oyciisos cor
ruption, and it would seem to follow
that n-tie would oppose vigorous meas
ures to eradicate it. I recommend the
enactment of a law directed against
bribery and corruption in federal elec
tions. The detail:; cf snc'i a law may
be safely left to the wise discretion of
the congress, but it should go as far as
under (he constitution It is possible to
ro and should include severe penalties
against him who gives or receives a
bribe Intended to influence his act or
opinion as irn elector and provisions for
the publication not only of the expend
itures for nominations and elections of
all candidates, but also of all contribu
tions received and expenditures made
by political committees."
I desire to repeat this recommenda--tion.
All contributions by corporations to
any political committee or for any po
litical purpose should be forbidden by
law', directors should not be permitted
to use stockholders' money for such
purposes, and, moreover, a prohibition
of this kind would be, as far as It
went, an effective method of stopping
the evils aimed at in corrupt practices
nets.
The IIilKiie Conference.
The first conference of nations held
at The Hague in 1S09, being unable to
dispose of all the business before it,
recommended the consideration and
settlement of a number of important
questions by another conference to be
called subsequently and at an early
date. These questions were the follow
ing: (1) The rights and duties of neu
trals; (Li the limitation of (he armed
forces on land and sea aud of military
budgets; (?,) the use of new types and
calibers of military and naval guns; (4)
the inviolability of piivale property at
sea in times of war; (5) the bombard
ment of ports, cities and vll-pges by na
val forces. In Octoeer, l!)('l, at the In
stance of the iute.yar Hamoi.tary union,
I issue.l invitations to all the powers
signatory to The Hague convention to
send delegates t si: -ii. a conference
and suggested that it be again held at
The Hague.
From all (he powers ii"eertance was
received, coupled in some cases with
the condition that we should wait until
(he end of ihe war then w iglng be
tween Russia and Japan. The emperor
of Bussia, immediately after (he t-eaty

this war, In a note pre-ented to the

In recommending that the conference
be now caded. The United i tates gov
ernment in response cxprcrod Its cor
dial acquiescence and stand that It
would as a matter of courre take part
In the new conference and endeavor to
further its aims. We assume that all
civilized governments will support the
movement and that the eauference Is

will do everything In itsjwver to se
cure the success of the "conference to
the end that substantial progress may
be made In the cause of international
peace, justice and good will.
Monroe Doctrine.
There are certain essential points
which must never be forgotten ns re-
gards the Monroe doctrine. Ia the first
place, we must as a ur.tiou make It ev
ident that we do not; iuieud to treat it
In any shape or wry n au excuse for
ngiraodizemeut on mo part at the ex
pense of (ho i public.' the south. ,
But we laut make u evident that we
do not intend to permit the Monroe doe
trine to be used by any nation on this
continent as a shield to protect it from
(lie consequences of ita own misdeeds
against foreign nations. The Mouroo
doctrine does not fori o rts to Interfere
to prevent the puis h-men of a port

not assume the form of territorial occu- ,
