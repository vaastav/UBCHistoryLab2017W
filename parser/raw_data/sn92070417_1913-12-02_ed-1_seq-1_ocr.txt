ASKS FOR ANTI-TRUST LEGISLATION AT EARLY DATE
The Executive Siates That Re Will Address a Special Message to
the Lawmakers Upon This Subject Some Time During the
,. Present Term Reading, Which is Done in Person, Re-
quires But Thirty Minutes Galleries Are Crowded
i With Interested Spectators
Washington, Dec. 2. President Wil-jthe'
son read his first annual message to
congress today at a joint session of
Doth tranches at 1 o'clock in the
house chamber. The message, among
the briefest documents of its kind
from any president, about 3,000
words long, required less than 30
minutes for reading, though it treated
upon a variety of subjects..,
The Mexican situation President
Wiiscn' dismissed with brief comment,
reiterating the sentiments he expres
sed in a special address to congress
upon the same subjects some time
ago, and expressing the belief that
the Huerta government slowly was
crumbling and that the United States
probably would not be obliged to alter
its policy of waiting.
Wants Trust Legislation
No plan for the first legisla
tion was presented ether than mention
of the desirability of an early amend
ment to the Sherman law, "to pre
vent private monopoly more effectual
ly than it has yet been prevented"
and an announcement that the presi
dent would later address a special
message to congress dealing solely
with that subject.
The Mexican Situation
The message opened with this com
ment on the Mexican situation:
"There is but one cloud upon our
horizon. That has snown itself to
the south of us and hangs over' Mex
ico. There can be no certain pros
pect of peace in America until Gen
eral Huerta has surrendered his
usurped authority in, Mexico;, until
it is understood on all hands, indeed,
that such, pretended, governments will
not be countenanced or dealt with by
the goyersment of the United States.
We are the friends of constitutional
government in America, we are more
than its friends, we are its champions,
because in no other way can our
neighbors, to whom we would wish
in every way to make proof of our
friendship, work out their own deve
lopment in peace, in liberty."
The president observed that the
power and prestige of the Huerta gov
ernment was rapidly crumbling and
added:
"We shall not, I believe, be obliged
to alter our policy of watchful wait
ing." ;
! A Slight Delay
President Wilson arrived at the
capitol just before 1 o'clock today to
read in person his first annual mess
age to a joint session, of congress.
He went at once to Speaker Clark's
room, where he was met by a com
mittee of the house and senate and
escorted into the house chamber and
to the rostrum.
The joint session and the reading of
the message did not begin promptly
at 1 o'clock, as had been provided,
because of the failure of the senate
roppsa in timA to ee.t over to the
honse chamber. It was within one-era and it was feared that the three
minute of one before the senators (men entombed had perished. Res

Everything was in readiness early
today for President Wilson to appear
before a joint session of both houses
of congress at 1 p. m. to read his first
annual message. The senate met at
11 a. m. under a plan to march to the
house chamber just before 1 o'clock.
The house arranged to assemble at
noon and then recess until the hour
for the reading.
Hours before the time set for the
president's appearance the corridors

OPPOSED TO HINDUS
Vancouver, B: C, Dec. 2. H. H.
Stevens, Vancouver's parliamentary
representative, returned from Ot
tawa last night with the an
nouncement that the federal govern
ment was considering legislation to
deal with the Hindu question in Brit
ish Columbia. A radical measure, Mr.
Stevens said, would be presented at
the next session of parliament.
; Formerly Hindus were barred from
Canada under a regulation compelling
them to travel by direct steamer from
India, there being until a few months
ago no such service in existence. Now,
however, certain steamers make the di
rect voyage and Hindus are entering
the province in large numbers. A
court decision recently, in the case
of a forcible deportation, was to the
eMect that Hindus could be deported
only for such cases as would apply
to any foreign citizens.

intimations that the jurors had been
approached.
Counsel for Lyman called . the
court's attention to the newspaper ar
ticles, declaring there was no truth
in them. Edward A. Regan, special
counsel for the government, said there
had been no suspicion of communica
tion between the jurors and the 'de
fense, but counsel joined in stating
their bfeH t that, the puMiahed1 minors
had made it impossible to continue
with the present jury. Judge. Well
born ordered a recess while he con
sidered the advisability of ordering a
new trial.

Mr. Spaan deuied that there was
good friendship between Dr. Craig and
Dr. Knabe. He said there was never
any promise of marriage or any talk
of marriage betweeu the two.
"Dr. Knabe was a mannish woman,
a fighter, but she was not success
ful," said Hr. Spaan. "She borrowed
money from her friends frequently
because she was unable to make a
living at the practice of medicine
and at the time of her death she was
preparing to train herself for physic

He asserted that her cousin, ,Dr.
Augusta A. Knabe, knew that she was
despondent because of her failure in
life, and had told a friend, who would
be produced as a witness, that she was
afraid Dr. Knabe would commit sui

COLORADO GRAND JURY SAYS
EMPLOYES HAVE MUCH FOR
WHICH TO PROTEST
Pueblo, Ool., Dec. 2. The task of
issuing warrants for the arrest of the
25 officials and1 members of the Unit
ed Mine Workers of America, who
were indicted late yesterday by the
United States grand jury, was begun
today by court officials! here. The
warrants will be placed in the hands
of United States Marshal Dewey C.
Bailey, who, it is said, had received
assurances from attorneys represent
ing the indicted men that they would
be produced when wanted1.
The indictments charge conspiracy
to monopolize labor and conspiracy
In restraint of interstate commerce.
The one charge was based on the pro
vision of the federal anti-trust law
prohibiting any number of workmen
to conspire to monopolize labor. The
other was based on the provision of
the same law prohibiting restraint of
trade between two states. ,
-The indictments .followed, several
weeks' investigation of conditions ex

ligation scores of w finesses were ex
amined, including Governor E. M.
Ammons, officials and representatives
of the coal companies operating prop
erties In the various districts, offic
ials and members of the United' Mine
Workers of America, and peace of
ficers and citizens of the coal. dis
tricts. The report of the jury criticised
acts of the operators in a number-of
instances, saying that, from testimony
deduced, "there existed reasonable
grounds for many of the grievances
complained of by the miners."
The jury criticised mine-owned sa
loons in, the coal camps, some of
which, It said, were conducted con
trary to law. Camp marshals, in some
instances, were accused of having ex
ercised a system, o espionage. The
jury found that some phases of the
"scrip system apparently are still in
use and are the sources of complaint
from many miners."
The jury report declares it had
found that the "state laws have not
been enforced so ast'' give, all per
sons concerned equals rights." It
says: "The coal companies have been
sufficiently Influential to nominate,
elect and control many county offi
cers and have dona so with the re
sult of complicating the Industrial
situation by arousing political preju
dice." Tiie jury gives space to Its findings
of violations of the eight hour law
and the method pursued by the Unit
ed Mine Workers in their conduct of
the strike.
Of these methods the report says:
"The ,methods pursued by the Unit
ed Mine Workers of America in their
endeavors to force recognition of their
union by the coal mine operators in
this state are an insult to conserva
tive and law-abiding labor."
On another point the report says:
"Evidently no qualification is nec
essary for membership in the United
Mine Workers of America, other than
a promise to pay dues, which are ap
parently used to support insurrection
and lawlessness when necessary to
force their demands by intimidation
and fear whenever strikes are called,
with the result of injuring other
trades and the entailment of hard
ships and1 privations on the people of
the entire commonwealth."
Recommendations attached urge
the impartial enforcement of the laws
anil the enactment of new laws to
correct the evils mentioned.
