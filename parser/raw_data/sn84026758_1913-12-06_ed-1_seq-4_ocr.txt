Christmas Drawing Near
As will be seen by the culen- '
dar. uiul also will observed in
the advertising in the Messed
ger. the Christmas season is
near at hand. Never before
have the merchants of this;
county commenced as earlv as
they have this t ear to exploit,
and call attention to their
Christmas displat of Christmas
and holiday goods. Because of
the rush this week our force
has been taxed, and our read
ing matter space curtailed, but
we have added additional pages ;
which containing interesting
advertisements as well as read- j
ing.
t >ur advertisers are worthy of ;
your patronage, and we believe !
that a careful pursual of ouri
columns will be of financial ad
vantage to our readers.
The President’s Message
President Wilson delivered
his annual message to Congress
last Monday on the assembling
of the Senate and House, lb
observed the custom set by him
of reading the message himself
instead of sending it over to be ;
read by a clerk. This act alone!
has made President Wilson very
popular with the people. They
know he is attending to their;
business faithfulh and that In
is not leaving others to perform
the duties assigned him.
Touching the Mexican situ- j
ation. the President declares
that President Huerta is a usur
per and that his forced presence
ill the ollice of President is the
stumbling block to peace in
that country. But he is insis- *
tent that this government shall
maintain its policy of watching
and waiting, and of refraining
from any interference, hopeful ;
that when the end comes—the
downfall of Hureta—we shall
‘•see constitutional order restor-!
ed in distressed Mexico ly the
concert and energy of sueli of
her leaders as prefer the liberty ■
of their own people to their own 1
ambitions."
Naturally.the President urges
Congress to action towards the I
enactment of a satisfactory!
measure of currency ami bank
ing reform. In respect io“curb
ing the Trusts" the President
advocates legislation supple
mental to the Sherman Anti-
Trust law in the direction of
“preventing private monopoly
more effectually than it has yet
been prevented." This is a
somewhat indefinite deliver
ance,but the President promises
a special message on this sub
ject in the future, in which, no
doubt, he will lay down recom
mendations in detail
The message include a recom
mendation of legislation for
making candidates for the Pres
idency subject to nomination
by public primaries, leaving to
national conventions only the
formal acceptance of the popu
lar nomination and tie- formu
lation of party platforms. The
national convention lias its
drawbacks, also its evils: hut it
staggers imagination to consid
er the proposition of the popu
lar nomination of candidates |
for the Presidency by great po
liticalfprimaries.
With recommendations of a 1
better equipment of the Bureau I
of Mines,an employers' liability
law for railroad employes and
better regulations for the em
ployment of sailors, and with
congratulations to Congress for
♦he diligence and good temper
has displayed, the President
ses a message that will afford I

Free Entertainment
OUR shop window is certainly providing the
public a lot of free entertainment this week.
At considerable expense we have had installed an in
genious automatic window-sign that puts Mrs. Piper
and Hindu magicians on the blink. The purpose
of the sign is to demonstrate the famous
5-PLYCollars
•‘THE COLLARS OF QUALITY"
and give ocular proof of their superiority over the 3 and 4-ply
collars that are on the market.
Interest in this window-show, however, is not confined to collar
buyers or collar wearers, for the fair-sex is well represented in
the throngs that gather daily.
Triangle 5-Ply Collars arc the name price as ordinary 3 and
4-ply collars, but are so tar in advance that we have thought it
to the public interest to Rive practical demonstration of their
superiority. The extra ply, flexible intcrlinings, the scientific
notching at bending points to prevent cracking, tho Stout-Stay
that fortifies the buttonhole—are a few of the reasons why
Triangle Collars outlast other collars two to one. Tho laundry
has no terrors for Triangle Collars.
A visit to our windows will not only entertain you, but give you a lot of
valuable collar information that you will appreciate.
Also wo have prepared interesting little souvenirs for all visitors.
