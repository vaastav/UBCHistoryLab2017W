by Illegal and wanton imprisonment.
It Is time the people were aroused to their

trampled under foot, while the power of correc

of tbe efficacy of the Plantation Bitters from

War unknown to civilisation until tbe middle
of the 17th century. ' Humboldt makes favora
ble mention of tbe febrifuge qualities of this
article as an Antidote for Fever and Ague, In
termltUtt and Malaiious Fevers, ia his eztea
slve South American travels. The Countess
wife of the Viceroy of Tern, having expe
rienced the beneficial effects of tbla Bark, sent
it to Europe In 1640. It was soli by the
Jesuits for the enormout turn of it own wight
in stiver, and was thus oalled Jisoits' Powers.
Io 1658, Sir John Talbot employed It with
ereat succcs! in France. In tbe treatment of
Fever and Ague, Dyspepsia, Nervous Affeo-
tions, Loss of Appetite, Weakness and Debit!
tj, Palpitation of tbe Heart, Diarrhass, etc,
under the name of English Powders; and In
1679, he sold the secret of Ha origin to Louis
XIV, by whom it was divulged. It is now a
standard remedy io sll Pharmacopoeia, and
is employed In preparing the Plantation Bit

Bilious, Intermittent and Chill Fevers, en
gendered by the change of water and diet of
travelers, particularly upon western rivers, are
prevented and cured by the Plantation Bitten.
Tbey are also reliable to prevent sea sickness.
