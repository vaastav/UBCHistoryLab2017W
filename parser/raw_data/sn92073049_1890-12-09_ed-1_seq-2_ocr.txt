A FEW WORDS OF A PERSONAL
V NATURE.
A
A TIME HONORED custom re
quires that any one taking upon
himself the duties of an Editor, shall
intimate to the public something of
the purposes and intentions which are
to actuate and guide him in the dis
charge of his grave responsibilities.
It will not be amiss, therefore, for me
to make the usual personal and ex
planatory observations at the thresh
hold of my entrance upon the duties
of my new position.
As to my qua!i6cation for the duties
ot journali3m, the readers of The Pro
gressive Farmer will be able to judge
softer the lapse of a little time. I may
say, however, that I am conscious of
an earnest purpose to be use
fal to the great constituency of the
paper; and if application and pains
taking industry can enable one of
my humble gilts to serve them ac
ceptably, I do not despair of earning
the good opinions of those for whom
I shall write and labor.
It may, cot unreasonably, be asked
what qa-ii'ficaticna for conducting a
journal devoted to the interests of
farmers cvi a mm possess whose life
has beeu, for the most part, spent in
the Gospel ministry ? To any who
may ak this qiestion, I make this
reply:
I was brought up on the farm, and
have performed with my own hands
every species and kind of farm labor
kro.vn to the people of my native
Sta,te. I understand the hardships of
farm life, from an actual experience
ot them; and I know about the limi
tations placed upon the manhood of
ttie farming classes by partial and un
fair laws. I have not forgotten the
hardships of my own early life upon
the farm; and I have not suffered my
self to drift out of sympathy, for so
much a 3 one hour, with the class in
which I was born.
Furthermore, I am thorough y in
sym pithy with the principles and aims
of the Farmers' Alliance. I believe
that simple justice, to say nothing at
all of mercy, requires the execution
of speedy reform of both State and
national laws, ia the interests of the
farmers of this country. I must not
"be misunderstood I could never be
induced to write a line or utter a
word in advocacy of the enrichment
of the farmers at the expense of any
other class of my fellow citizens.
Such advocacy would be the advocacy
of class legislation; and I hate class
legislation eve a as I hate its author
the devil. I say I am in sympathy
with the principles of the Farmers'
Alliance. The questions that relate
to the embodiment of those principles
in actual laws, are questions of method,
and they are to be solved by the wis
dom of practical statesmanship.
I want to say, once for all, that I
am a Democrat have never : been
anything else. But that statement of
my political faith must not be taken
. as an admission, on my part, that I
wear the collar of any self appointed
clique of political bosses, in or out of
office. When I say I am a Democrat
I mean to be understood as saying
that I am the friend of that theory of
government which locates all the
rights and powers of just government
in the people themselves. In my
opinion, all the people are better,
greater and grander than any part of
the people.
My hand is unused to holding the
Elitorial pen; and I take it up with
much of distrust of my own powers.v
And were it not for the fact that I
am conscious of an earnest wish and
purpose to use it for the good of our
. toiling American citizenship, I should
lay it down, and take it up no more.
I bespeak, most earnestly, the in
dulgence and kindly help of all . my
brethren in the field of journalism,
and shall do all in my power to merit
their confidence and esteem.
Baylus Cade.
The Progressive Farmer, under its
new administration, starts off! rather
briskly. , We quote:
" The Progressive Farmer has been
boycotted by the News and Observer.
We no longer see it, but a friend has
kindly handed us soma clippings from
it, by which we learn that it is ' still
doing business at the old stand ' and
with its accustomed persistency in
misrepresentation. It falsely charged
President Polk with being in a ring
to elect Mr. Calhoun, of Georgia, to
the Senate. We ask the editor of
that paper to publish the following
letter from President Polk, written to
the Atlanta Constitution ."
Now the first statement made above
is untrue; but the new editor was
probably misled about that. Connect
necting the News and Observer with
" accustomed persistency in misrepre
sentation" is an untruth for which
there is no excuse.
What we said about Col. Polk in
connection with the Georgia election
we think was entirely justified ; nor
do we think that :he letter which The
Progressive Farmer asks us to print
ii proof to the contrary of what we
said. Had any friend of Col. Polk
called that letter to our attention in a
decent way we would have printed it
cheerfully, just as we were the firs:
paper in the State to print; his letter to
Mr. Norwood. But the contemptible
manner in which the matter is brought
to our attention forbids us from doing
what is asked as an act of courtesy,
and we do not think that justice to
Col. Polk r : quires it, as in our opinion
the letter does not put the matter in
an aspect inconsistent with what we
have heretofore suggested.
The above article appeared as an
editorial in the News and Observer of
the 3d in st.
If the editor of the News and Ob
server had been as careful to ascertain
the truth as he was to resent a fancied
insult, he would have known that " the
new administration " had nothing
whatever to do with the issue of The
Progressive Farmer in which the
article he complains of appeared.
Brother Ashe could have save i this
draught upon his " genius for blun
dering" by simply looking at the
name at the top of the editorial page
of The Progressive Farmer. But no.
Our neighbor was not looking for
names. He seems rather to have been
looking for a red rag. He was sure
'the new administration " had a red
rag somewhere about his person, and
he was expecting " the new adminis
tration" would shake it at him; and,
mistaking the red glow of his own
heated iauaginati ;n for the red rag
aforesaid, ho rushes into print and
denounces " ihe new administration "
for circulating an untruth, for being
misled, and for calling his attention
to. Col. Polk's letter in an indecent
way. Brother Ashe pnblished the
above article on the 31 inst , in the
face of the fact that " the new admin
istration " had written him on the 2d
inst that he knew nothing of the mat
ter cornpldned of.
The 41 new administration " intends
to be entirely fair and courteous in
his treatment of hn brethren of the
press, including brother Ashe, of the
Nexus and Observer ; and he intends
to expect the same fairness and cour
tesy from his brethren of the pres3,
including brother Ashe, of the News
and Ob$ever. And brother Ashe may
save himself some annoyance by mak
ing a careful note of this fact and
wearing it in th? crown of his hat, if
ho cannot trust his memory.
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
PRESIDENT HARRISON pre
tends to think the' McKinley bill
has not been tried long enough to en
able the people to see its effects upon
prices.
We went to a friend the other day
to buy a breech-loading shot gun;
and we were told that 35 per cent,
must first be added to what the same
gun cost last year; and then six dollars
must be put upon the 35 percent, ad
dition, before the price at which the
gun jould be now so d was reached.
We wanted a pocket knife; and our
dealer said we must pay one dollar
and ten cents for our favorite blade.
We remonstrated, by telling him we
never paid more than sixty cents for
that make of kniveg in our life. Our
friend smiled and simply said, " you
have forgotten the new tariff upon
knives.' We are satisfied the new
law has taken effect hereabouts.
A DARKEY'S IDEA OF THE
FORCE BILL.
AN old negro came to a friend of
ours the other day, and said:
" Boss, what is dat Force Bill I hears
dera talkin' so much about?"
Our friend explained the Lodge
Bill to him in the simplest way he
could command. After the explana
tion was concluded, the old man held
his head on one side, and chewed his
tobacco reflectively for a minute or
two; and then delivered himself to
the following effect:
" Hit 'pears to me dey's fixin' ter
git some moah niggers killed."
ADVICE TO CORRESPONDENTS.
DONT write to The Progressive
Farmer unless you have some
thing important to write.
2. Write short articles. We do
not want long essays. Nobody reads
long articles. Make it short, and to
the point.
3. Don't mix business matters with
communications. Write what you
want published on one sheet,, and
what you wantrto say on business on
another. Don't write at ali unless you
can write moderately good English.
The editor has no time to rewrite
your articles and you should not ex
pect him to do it.
4. Write items of news on a postal
card. The editor will agree to make
verb and noun agree in an item on a
postal card. But he cannot agree to
do so if your article is long.
5. When you write for us use
simple words. Words of "learned
length and thundering sound " are
out of place anywhere; and they are
especially so in a newspaper article.
An old saw illustrates this very well.
A young man in the olden time drove
up to a farmer's house, and a negro
man came to care for his horse and
buggy, upon which the young man
delivered himself to the following
effect:
" Disengage the quadruped from the
vehicle and stabulate him with an
abundant quantity of the nutritious
aliment commonly called hay; and,
when the Aurora bedecks the eastern
horizon, I will reward you with a
pecuniary compensation."
The negro called his master, and
f.old him, "there is a Dutchman out
here'
The young man would have done
so much better if he had said : " Un
hitch the horse from the buggy, put
him in the stable and give him plenty
of hay; and, in the morning I wiil
give you a dime."
Use simple words. In long words
there is often a meaning lurking
which plain people do not suspect.
6. Please believe that it will do the
editor good to print wh it you write,
if it is worth printing.
We do not want you to wait until
you can write elegantly and accurate
ly. But if you have anything to say
to the public, send it on in short,
pointed articles, and it will delight us
to print it. We are honestly in sym
pathy with all who desire to help us,
and 77e will be as kind and indulgent
as we can.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
PERSjNS who know President
Harrison well say he is endowed
with a conscience, that is sensitive to
the slightest shades of moral distinc
tion; and men who live near his per
son in Washington declare him to be
a sincere and humble Christian. But
the message which he sent to the Con
gress last Monday is not creditable to
his moral perceptions, nor to his Chris
tian chara ter.
In this message the President seeks
to justify the iniquity known as the
VicKinley bill; and the only argu
ments he employs for that purpose
are sophistries and selfishness. How
can any man, with an unbiased judg
meut, argue, for example, that a pro
tective tariff can benefit any but the
owners of the manufacturing estab
lishments of the country ? Does the
President of the United States not
know that such a tariff as that em
bodied in the McKinley bill enhances
the prices of commodities used by the
great masses of the people? Does
not the control of a home market
mean that consumers are forced to
buy all sorts of manufactured articles
from those whose manufacturing
plants are located in this country ?
Have not these manufacturers, who
are protected from outside competi
tion, the power to charge consumers
any price for their wares that falls
within the value prescribed by the
tariff ? Suppose, for illustration, that
the tariff upon axes is forty per cent.
ad valorem - that is, forty per cent, of
the value of axes after their manufac
ture. Cannot the manufacturers of
axes add the forty per cent, to the
output of their factories, and force
every man who buys an ax to pay
forty per cent, more for it than it
would cost him if competition were
not shut off by the tariff ? Does not
this illustration apply to every article
protested by the wicked the deliber
ately and meanly wicked legislation
which Mr. Harrison seeks to excuse
and perpetuate in his message ? The
McKinley bill then brings no benefits
to the consumers of the country.
But the President U363 the old,
threadbare argument the resource of
sophisters and fools, to say nothing of
knaves, that the tariff inures to the
benefit of workingmen. Let us see.
Suppose Andrew Carnegie to be in
possession of the intire iron and steel
industries of the country. Suppose
further, that the workingmen engaged
in making iron and steel in the mills
of this great metal kiog ire not satis
fied with their wages, and demand an
increase of pay. Let us suppose,
moreover, that their demand for ad
vanced wages is denied, as such de
mands usually are. What follows?
One of two things. The men work on
at the unfair and unsatisfactory rate
of pay, or they strike for an increase.
If they work on, they do so under the
sickening sense of wrong and injustice,
because they have no means of com
pelling greed to make a concession in
their favor. And if they strike, they
will be forced. into submission by the
compelling power of empty stomachs,
long before the demand for iron and
steel will raise the prices of those
commodities so high as to enable the
products of foreign mills to come in
over the tariff. This is the simple
reason why a protective tariff never
has benefited workingmen, and never
will benefit them. No doubt the
masters whose business is protested
could . afford to give their work ng
men better pay that is, they could
divide their increased earnings with
the men who labor to make those
earnings. And, in that case, protec
tion, so called, would be & conspiracy
of masters and men against the con
sumers of the country. But, in the
case that actually exists, and always
has existed, protection is a conspiracy
of masters against both consumers and
workingmen. Without garniture of
any sort, this is what the President of
the United States offers in his annual
message to the millions of toilers in
thi3 great country.
It ia one of the curiosities of Re
publican statesmanship that the same
message which tries to fasten the hate
ful McKinley bill upsn the people of
these States should contain an argu
ment in favor of reciprocity between
this country and the Central and
South American States. Has Benja
min Harrison lived to this present
time in enlightened and freedom lov
ing America, and has he risen, by ac
cident or otherwise, to be the Chief
Executive of this Republic, without
finding out that absolute "free
trade " is nothing else but rec procity
universally applied ? The logic that
will open the ports of the United
States to the commerce of Central and
South America will open those same
ports to the commerce of every nation
under heaven. Surely the day of
wonders is not past.
The message we are considering in
dulges in trie usual dull, dreary
platitudes of Republican statesman
ship about the establishment of steam
ship lines to extend our commerce
and enable us to recover some part of
iihe world's carrying trade. Mr. Har
rison's ideas of what ought to be done
to re establish our prestige on the
high seas, seem to be entirely ex
hausted when he asks Congress to
put its hand into the public Treasury
and give somebody some money to
establish steamship lines between this
country and Central and South
America. It seems never to have oc
curred to the astute Benjamin that
the infamous navigation laws, written
upon the national statute books by
the Republican party, have had any
thing to do with driving our flag from
the oceans of the world The Presi
dent intimates, in his message, that
he wants ail sorts of things done;
and he wants those who do them to
be paid out of the public purse for
their doing.
The message shows by its tariff
twaddle, and by its partiality to the
employment of subsidies, and by its
hyposritical commendations of the
Fojce bill, that the President and his
party have learned nothing from the
results of the late elections. Well,
it may be better for the country in
the long run that those lessons should
be thrown away upon this administra
tion.
Taken as a whole, and taken in its
parts, the message is weak weak to
the very verge of stupidity. The only
element of strength in it is its stub
born refusal to see the pla n hand
writing of recent events. But how
could a message advocating the the
ories of the dominant party in the
present Congress be statesmanlike in
any particular ? The way to answer
that question one does not see.
SEND FIVE CENTS.
BRETHREN Robert Reddick and
James W. Twine, of Nicanor
Alliance, Perquimans county, have
had the misfortune to los their
horses, and brother James F. White
asks the treasurers of the sub ordinate
lodge3 throughout the State to send
five cents per member to him to enable
those unfortunate brethren to pur
chase horses with which to make next
year's crop. Please send money to
brother Jas. F. White, Nicanor, N. C.
A PLAIN QUESTION.
Does The Progressive Farmer ad
vise the members of the legislature
who are pledged to vote for Senator
Vance to disregard their pledges?
Let the people have an answer.
News and Observer.
Most certainly The Progressive
Farmer does not, never did, aad
never will, advise any member of the
legislature, or anybody else to disre
gard a pledge to do anything If any
man pledged himself to vote for Sen
ator Vance, and violates his pledge,
he wiil show himself unworthy of any
man's confidence.
This is our idea of political morality.
We wonder if it suits the News and
Observer. Has our contemporary's
moral furniture gotten awry, that he
should ask us so elementary a question
in political morals ?
If our friend should get in any
other moral tangle in the future we
hope he'll ask us about it. We always
take pleasure in imparting instruction
to those who need it.
AN ORIGIAL GENIUS IN JOUR
NALISM.
Col. Polk's letter, elsewhere printed,
makes but a poor showing for him in
the Calhoun matter. It appears on
the face of it that he was knowing to
the whole transaction and lent the in
flnpnr-.A nf his name to the lin&r. It
was only when the indignation which
"he feared would result," did come
to upset the plans of Macune and
Turner and Calhoun, that the Colonel
took occasion to deny that he was a
party to the scheme. It seems that
he had spoken to the members of the
legislature on the subject of the Sen
atorship, but he did not then warn
them against the Macune ring. He
allowed the people to believe that he
and Macune were working the thing
together until the balloon burst. Had
the scheme proved a success, would he
ever have broken his silence ? Appar
ently it is only because of the wreck
of the ring that the Colonel has sought
to clear himself from association with
the tattered ana torn balloon. We
think the people will say that the Col
onel wrote his letter too late.
The above article appeared, as an
editorial, in the News and Observer of
this city, on Nov. 20. We want to
ask the editor of the News and Ob
server a few simple questions and
make sooie observations which may
greatly benefit our neighbor if he
will ponder them a little.
How does the News and Observer
know that Col. Polk " was knowing
to the whole transaction ?" How does
onr neighbor know that Col. Polk
" lent the influence of his name to the
ring?" How does brotner Ashe know
that Col. Polk " allowed the people to
believe that he and Macune were
working the thing together until the
balloon burst?"
We have not overlooked the fact
that our neighbor says that his infor
mation appears on the face of Col.
Polk's letter. But the letter was
written to deny the very facts that
our neighbor insists upon; and the
letter does deny those very fasts. We
have known for sometime that it was
unsafe to trust the Neivs and Ob
servers alleged sources of information;
and we are not at all surprised to find
that no such facts, as that really virtu
ous paper insists upon, "appeared on
the face of Col. Polk's letter." But
while we cannot trust our neighbor's
alleged sources of information, we are
by no means so positive about the
trustworthiness of certain extraordinary
sources of information which our
friend very frequently draws upon.
The fact is, we are not positively cer
tain that we know what those extraor
dinary sources of information are.
We have constructed hypothesis after
hypothesis to explain the matter; but
we are not quite certain of our con
elusion yet. For instance, we have
thought that it may be possible that
our brilliant friend of the News and
Observer has the power of getting cer
tain lines of unsavory information
through his olfactories. We know
there are certain birds gifted with this
power; but there has not been a man
within our knowledge whose smelling
powers had sufficieut sweep to reach
from Raleigh to Atlanta; and we have
been forced to dismiss our friend's
nose from the problem altogether.
We have wondered if our neighbor
got his facts in this case, as in several
other recent instances, from an unerr
ing and rare instinct. But then we
remembered that the philosophers
have all agreed together taat unerring
instinct is the possession of the lower
animals alone; and we would not
think, for a moment, of classifying
our brilliant brother of the tripod
with any order lower than the angels.
We have instituted several other sup
positions to explain the matter; but
have been reluctantly forced to
abandon all of them but one as un
tenable. We have about settled down
to the conviction that our neighbor's
wonderful superiority to his journal
istic friends and associates is due to
his original and powerful imagination.
Indeed we think it is a waste of eaor
mous possibilities for our friend to
bury himself in the obscurities of
mundane journalism. Such powers
should be left free to range through
the spaces, and expatiate upon the
wonders of the unseen universe. The
conviction grows upon us that the
editor of the News and Observer should
turn his powerful imagination to the
cultivation of Epic poetry. Such
powers as his are by far too fine to
be employed about the dissussion of
questions of economic politics; such
a splendidly creative imagination
should betake itself, with the least
possible delay, to th society of the
immortal Nine and the heights of
Parnassus.
HOW ABOUT THE BOYCOTT?
Raleigh, N. C , Dec. 2, 1890.
Editor Progressive Farmer Bear
Sir : I see in your issue of this date,
that the News and Observer has boy
cotted The Progressive Farmer,
which conveys to your readers a very
wrong impression. When The Pro
gressive Farmer was moved here,
the News and Observer was left at its
place of publication; but we were
asked to send it to Col. Polk's resi
dence Mr. Browder's. We did so.
And that is all I know, about the
matter, or that I have been able to
learn.
Li ihe matter of exchanges we are
not at all illiberal; and taking vn
intimation to mean that you .
copy of this paper at the 0ffih !
have directed a copy to be left th 1
as I would have done at any tim '
the suggestion of The Phoo,? at
Farmer. Bss.sIVt
Very respectfully,
In justice to the News and 0hs
we publish the above note with It
following comment: e
The business manager of The p
gressive Farmer says the KtWs Eo
Observer came to this office regui
until about two months ago, when
visits suddenly ceased. The pres U3
editor of The Progressive pARy
knows nothing of the facts of th"B
case outside of what he has been tol?
Mr. Browder says the copy 0f i'

EDITORIAL NOTE;
All persons interested in the
Peanut Union of Virginia and North
Carolina will please give attention
to the notice of brother Boykin in this
issue.
Mr. G. B. W. Dunn, of Marl
boro, S. C, has sold his farm at that
place, and will henceforth live at Mt.
Airy, N. C. His correspondents will
take notice of the change of his ad
dress. Hon. T. R Jernigan, editor and
proprietor of the North Carolina In.
telligencer, called at this office on Fri
day of last week, and extended a
warm greeting to the new editor of
this paper. Mr. Jernigan is a gentle
man of hne gifts and culture; and he
makes the best weekly paper that
comes to this office. We wish him
and his paper the abundant prosperity
wmsn ne ncmy deserves.
We comtemplate making some
changes in The Progressive Farmer
with the beginning of the next vol
ume which will add greatly to its at
tractiveness and usefulness. Those
changes will entail a large additional
nntlav nf mnnflv Wa hnno r.ni-
readers and friends will appreciate
our efforts to please and benefit tfcra,
and encourage us in our arduous
labors by sending large clubs of sub
scribers. We most heartily thank all
onr friends who have helped us
hitherto, and we promise to use al
ways our very best efforts to serve
them and the cause of truth and
righteousness. Send on the names,
friends, and we will benefit and de
light you in the future as we have not
done in the past.
An exchange prints an inter
view with Senator Ingalls in which
the Senator expresses a strong hope
of re election to the Senate. Hope is
a radiant thing, and no one can be
sorry that she turns her bright face
towards, and beams upon the pictur
esque Senator from Kansas. We are
reluctant to dispel the fond conceit
which Mr. Ingalls indulges. But a
strong sense of philanthropic obliga
tion forces us to say, that infinitely
more numerous are the disappointed
predictions of radiant Hope than are
those that have been fulfilled by the
3vents. If the members of the Kan
sas legislature are true men the Sen
ator will find ere long that radiant
Hope has been to him nothing but a
painted-faced siren whose song was
sung to deceive. So mote it to !
