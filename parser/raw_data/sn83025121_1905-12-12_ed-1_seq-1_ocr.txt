Work on tho Kohala ditch continues to maka progress that fairly assures
a flowing of tbo fructifying waters at tho timo "nominated in tho bond." It
is hoped that tho first section of fourteen miles from Honokano west will bo
completed by tho first of July next, so that water will bo delivered in timo
for planting. An additional six miles will bo built to windward as far as
Waimanu.

Considering that constructive operations woro not begun till April 10 this
vear, the- progress has been most rapid. Indeed it adds laurels to tbo credit
of the Territory of Hawaii for vigorous activity. Nino of the fourteen miles
under construction aro in rock tunnel, of which tho following nro the data of
progress: April, 1461 feet; May, 5100 feet; June, 8715 feet; July, 7207 feet;
August, 5195ifcct; September, 3347; October, 3307; November, 2978 feet.
About SOOO feet moro romain to b'o completed beforo all tho borings will
be finished, which will be in about four months. Tor tho remarkablo progress
tnaiio much of the credit is due to tho Japanese. Tho lnbor is being entirely
performed by this nationality, who exhibit especial proficiency for rock excavating
work.
About ten miles of the fourteen will be lined with concrete and cement
plaster through porous strata to obviato tho loss of water from seepage. This
work is now under way and being pushed ns fast as tho tunneling is completed.
The Concrete Construction Co. of Honolulu has the contrnct for making forty
cubic yards of sand a day for this purpose. This material is distributed
through tho tunnels by means of nn 18-inch gauge tramway which was
used in conveying the excavated rock from the tunnels to the dumps.
The ditch will havo a capacity of convoying 70 millions of gallons in
twenty-four hours, and while it will not be nlwnys full it is expected to havo
an avcrago flow of 45 million gallons a day from the twenty or more streams
it intercepts between Waimanu and Kohnla.
This water will bo delivered on tho plantations at an altitude of from 1000
to 950 feet, and sold to the different plantations through tho district who will
make reservoirs at their own expenso to Btore tho night flow'.
Kohala, Union Mill and Hawi plantations and tho new Wight land west of
'Hawi -will derive the greotest benefit, and it is confidently hoped to incrcaso
the tonnage of sugar output of the Kohnla district from its present volume of
.lujuu ions a year to zu,juu.
Should futuro conditions mako sugar unprofitable, then this water will bo
useful for irrigating small farms and supplying tho wants of a densely settled
community, such as' those existing"undcr similar water-projects "in" Southern
California.
The inception of tho project is duo to Col. Sam. Parker and J. T. Mc-Crosson,
though it did not assume a substantial status till tho Hind cstato and
Mrs. Samuel Parker lent thoir financial nssistanco.
It is cstimnted tho ditch will cost when completed about $750,000, and the
Hawaiian government, under tho terms of tbo franchise, will havo tbo privilege
of acquiring it nt this figure.
The wbolo constructive part of tho entcrpriso is in chargo of M. M.
O'Shaughnessy, C. E., who oxecutcd tho Makaweli and Koolau aqueducts in
previous years in a successful manner.
Tho Kohnla ditch bids fair to add greatly to tho material progress of tho
big Island of Hawaii, though tho tourist and kamaaina will regrot tho disappearance
of tho many picturcsquo waterfalls now ornamenting tho bluffs
Waimanu and Kohala. In futuro tho Btrenms that mako these beautiful
objects will bo intercepted by this work and thoir contents led out to tho
farm lands, whero they will create new beauties of landscapo besides increasing
tho prosperity of tho Islands to a degrco at present difficult to calculato,

SCHWEITZER TALKS ABOUT
HIS MANILA BREWERY! PLAN
Louis Schweitzer, secretary of tho Honolulu Brewing & Halting Company,
which manufactures 1'rlmo beer, returned from a tour of tho Orient yesterday
on tho Korea, accompanied by Mrs. Schweitzer.
Mr. Schweitzer's mission in tho Far East was to investigate tho field and
ascertain whether tliero was room for another brewery. Associated with Senator
Hocking, also of tho Honolulu brewery, and two San Francisco capitalists,
Mr. Schweitzer was armed with authority to mako a thorough investigation of
the prospocts, nnd the choice now practically lies between Shanghai and Manila.
Whilo in tho latter city Mr. Schweitzer enme in contact with the San
Miguel Brewing Company, which claimed to have a monopoly in tho business
of brewing beer, in Manila at least, and that company made public statements
to that effect, quoting old Spanish laws to back up its contention.
This did not scare Mr. Schweitzer oil and he obtained a ruling from tho
Attorney-General of tho Philippines, which indicated that if Mr. Schweitzer
wanted to go ahead and establish a new brewery thoro was nothing in the
franchise grauted the San Miguel peoplo to prevent a competitor from entering
tho field.
Shanghai wns looked upon as n promising Held for a brewery.
"Shanghai is certainly tho Paris of the Far East," said Mr. Schweitzer,
"and everything is on tho move. Thero is business everywhere. The streets
aro lined with rickshaws and other vehicles and crowds of peoplo aro moving
up and down nnd the stores are busy places.
"I saw Lorrin Andrews and he told mo ho was doing well. In fact he
oaid he had made $750 a day or two after getting thero and that was more
money than he had made in Honolulu for some time. Ho does not intend to
come back to Honolulu.
''Can we ship Primo beer to tho Orientl Well, there are a lot of agonts
there who would like to get our beer but the steamship companies won't make
us a rate. Therefore, we can not enter the market.
"As to whether we will build a brewery over thero, either at Shanghai or
Manila, I can not stato just now. I have not yet made' my report."

manager. Late that night a fracas was to be started between over thirty Russians
and Americans near the hotel, but the polico succeeded in preventing

Lieut. Slavery's Task
in Hawaiian
Waters,
A copy of the annual report upon the
Improvement of Pearl and Honolulu
harbors, Hawaii, In the charge of J. R.
Slattcry, First Lieutenant, Corps of
Engineers, U. S. A., has been received
from the author. The report gives
much valuable Information concerning
the commercial aspect of the harbor of
Honolulu.
The first portion of the report contains
an extract from tho annual report
of the Chief of Engineers to the
Secretary of War, as follows:.

the charge of Col. W. II. Heuer, Corps
of Engineers, until April 14, 1905. This
harbor is S miles west of Honolulu.
Before Improvement there was a bar at
Its entrance with a low-water depth of
10 feet on Its crest and a coral reef
on either side. A full description of
i the harbor Is found in Senate Execu
tive Document No. 42, Fifty-third Congress,
second session. The project for
Improvement contemplated dredging a
channel 200 feet wide and 30 feet deep
at mean low water, at an estimated
cost of $100,000. Congress approved
this propoct by appropriating $100,000
in the act of March 3, 1899.
Contract was made In 1901 for doing
the work required. Dredging was begun
In March, 1902, and completed In
August, 1903, which resulted In a chan

range of tides at the entrance Is about

"One matter needing attention Is that

(Associated Press Cablegrams.)
ST. PETERSBURG, December 12. The situation is ominous
with reaction and coercion facing each other.
It is understood that the government is against universal suffrage
and favors permitting the franchise to be exercised only by
rent payers, merchants and the educated classes.
The capital resembles a military camp. Artillery are conspicuous
in the streets. Tho patrols have been doubled.
Workingmcn's meetings have been dispersed while loyalist
meetings are undisturbed.
It is now the popular belief that the government has chosen
Trepoff and Ignatieff to execute a program of repression and that
the entire Cossack strength of the empire will be mobilized for the
purpose.
Churches have been desecrated, landlords have been murdered
and their property pillaged.
