FOR MAYOR I
JOHN JOHNSON.
- OTTB KEXT MATOH.
John Johnson will be the next Mayor
of Memphis. Public opinion runs an
mistakably to that result. We dislike to
see oar Southern people divided, and if
we knew gny remedy to prevent io d
plorable a result, we would suggest it.
For the opponents of Mr. Johnson, we
entertain feelings of respect. That they
are sincere in their opposition to him,
we do not doubt, bnt we cannot avoid
the conclusion that they are pursuing a
mistaken policy. It is not denied that
Johnson has done well, and he is a bold
man who thinks be could have done bet
ter. We want to get the city out of
debt. We want its employes paid in
money, and ht has made a fair begin
ning. He has eiven satisfaction. He
has taught the people that a really supe
rior mind is equal to all emergencies,
He is grappling with the public debt, and,
if re-elected, will place the city in a fair
condition in regard to its finances.
Would it not be folly to turn out such a
man for one who would be obliged to
pursue his policy, or make a great
lilnndi-r? Mass meeting or no mass
meeting, convention or no convention,
the neonle will support Johnson. He is
their candidate and will be re-elected.
We regret to see some of our best citi
zens opposing him. We shall not quar
rel with them for that. We simply ask
. them, though their own qualifications
may be in all respects equal, if not supe
rior, to those of Johnson, to recognize
the unmistakable voice of the people.
We dislike to see antagonism among
friends. We dislike to see the Southern
people divided. But the affairs of Mera
nhis reauire a strong, firm mind and a
devotion to them that nothing can shake.
Johnson possesses that mind and that de
votion.
THE LAST HOPE.
The list of deadPresidential candidates
in the Democratic party is large. Hoff
man was a year since prominent, and
had his host of friends. tfPendleton and
Hendricks have disappeared. John
Quinpy Adams is not now spoken of.
Othrs have gone the same way. There
is not now a prominent Democrat in the
field. Tom Scott was the last experiment,
but made no great sensation. Public
opinion among the masses of Democrats
has been fur sometime drifting toward
the policy of inaction and to the ulti
mate support of a Republican in oppo
sition to Grant. And so, after the de
struction of the prospects of a Demo
cratic candidate, the question is nar
rowed down to an anti-Grant Republi
can. Before next July the tide may
' turn. No one can tell. The Democratic
look-out is very dark. The Republicans
have now an opportunity of quarreling
to the conteut of their hearts. The only
hope the Democrats have is in the dis
ruption of that party. It is a desperate
one, but it may ba realised. If the Radi
cals possessed a little of the magnanimity
which is common to civilized communi
ties, they would, now that their power is
undisputed, proclaim a general amnesty,
declare peace and invite the South to
re-enter the councils of the country,
Thev can well afford to do that. It
would strengthen and secure their tri
umph. But they possess no magnanim
ity. Having grown rich and powerful
by robbiag and abusing the Soath, they
have no intention of discontinuing their
programme. And so, our Democratic
Preaidential lights are going out one by
one. and taking- their places with the
dead issues of the country. They are
suffering the penalty of being just, hon-
est and Christian. They are fine men,
but the people of the North do not want
Cat men.
"The sale of Paymaster Hodge's
house at Washington, says the Iloston
Post, terminates the somewhat ineffec
tive attempt of the Government to get
back the money it allowed its specula
tive servant to squander opon the bulls
and bears of Wall street. The insuffi
ciency of the'amount realized to reim
burse the Government leads to regret
that the accident of discovery came when
it did; since now it is stated that Hodge
was operating for a fall, and that, had
he been allowed to continue a few weeks
longer, he would not only have retired
with individual wealth, but would have
been able to refund all that he had ta
ken from the Treasury." If that be so,
why not allow the Government thieves
to go on with their operations nntil they
can refund the stolen moneyT How
many are going on now ?
A Northern exchange says the visit
of the gilt-edged son of the Czar of Rus
sia to New York has, affected every
branch of industry in that volatile city,
and has even invaded the literature of
the metropolis. One of the journals
tells us that " Union Square is all a-flut
ter with Russian Hags, wnich gave it a
very gay appearance. Some of tbs iah-
vostchiks on the droschky-stand there
are getting miniature Muscovite nags
made, with which to adorn the head
stalls of their horses. One sabakootch
elovek declines to pay this compliment
though, because he has an absurd idea
in his head that the Russian sailors will
eat np his axle-grease if they get
chance."

Wi Bpn the good people of that fine

Hang him to anything else except that.
We care very little about the fact of
hanging, hut if you attempt to hang him
to a lamp-post a thousand scabbards
will lean from their swords in his de

fate than that of hanging. Do anything
you please with him, bnt don't spoil his

The Washington Patriot says: " Borne
time ainee aa inventor applied to the
Patent Office for a patent fur a new
process of embalming, and in order to
comply with the supposed requirements
of the law, that a model he deposited in
the office, he prepared a neatlittle coffin,
with a glass face, in which be deposited
the remains of a tiny infant, which had
been embalmed by his process. It be
ing considered not desirable to make
the Patent Oiliee a catacomb, the model
eras retorned to the inventor for burial."
