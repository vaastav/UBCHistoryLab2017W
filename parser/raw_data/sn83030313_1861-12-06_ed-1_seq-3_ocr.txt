in believed that by these two provisions a large amount
of revenue now lost will be Kav.nl to the dopartmeut.
naval minus.
It is suggested for the consideration of Congress,
whether the privilege, by tho act of tho lato session, con
ferrod upon soldiers, to Rend letters without prepayment of
postage, should not bo extended to s:illoi s and marines in
thr actual service of the United states, under such regu
latious ua tho department shall provide.
MAIL CABRIKH'S FIE.
By the act approved March 8, 1426 (section 20) , it is
provided that a malt carrier shall ret eive and deliver for
mailing at the next office any letter delivered to lnm for
that purpose more than a mile from such office, ilo is
entitled for such carriage to demand and receive one
cent from tho postmaster for this service. Under tin
prepayment system now adopted, this provipiun should
be amended so as to allow him to demand tin* fee of the
writer, in money, and of tho postmaster only when tho
loiter shall bear a prepaid stamp fur cue cent additional
to tho postage.
NBWSI'APEKS.
By tho existing law (scction 10 of act approved March
8,1845), " nouspapors" are declared to embrace printed
matter issued by numbers, and published monthly, and
aro entitled to the sain a privilege of freo exchanges and
low rntos of postage us daily and weekly newspapers en
joy. It is aacei'taiut d that this classiticntlon is abased
by the publication of monthly issues of printed matter
chiefly designed as an advertising circular, or to procure
free exchanges for the proprietor, and they are often tout
gratuitously.
I recommend that the dellnition of a nowspaper a3
given by that act, be amended by substituting the words,
published nt short staled intervals of not more than one
week, for tho words, '? published at short stated inter
vals of not more th&u "no month. " Also, that the privi
lege of free exchango of publieations be limited to news
papers as thus defined, and literary, educational or reli
gious periodicals published not less frequently than once
a month.
It is found that considerable frauds aro perpetrated
upon the revenues of tho department, by publishers of
newspaiiers, who include, miugiod with th>i packages sent
to their regular siibscribem, numbers of tlioir Issues
which are not sent to their regular subscribers, and
which are, therefore, subject to postage as trans. cut
matter.
To remedy this evil I recotnmond that discretion he
given to the head of this department to exclude, tempo
ral lly , from the mails nay news; aper or periodical whose
proprietors or ugon is shall send any of their issues wilti
onl projiayment of postage to othjr than 6on? Jid>: nub
Bciibers; or, otherwise, that an express penalty be im
posed tor such act.
00?nitSt*i0Mjii. post iiornn.
It is frequently found expedient, in cctmoclion with tho
progress of railroad communications or changes of princi
pal transportation ro;tes, to cbaiiijo the termini of Con
gressional mail route.; intersecting them.
1 suggest, for the oonsid<!i'atl"n of Congress, tho pro
priety ot expressly authorizing this department to chango
the to. mini and lint s of Congress!' r.al mail routes inter
aecttng principal routes on which the mails are carried
daily, whenever tho postal service can bo theroby im
proved.
ADDITIONAL MAILABLE MATTt.'t.
The twelfth section of the act of 1S61 declares sundry
additions to matter which may be sent through the mails.
Various applications have been made to Include othor
)iko matter, not expressly named therein, as mailable
matter.
It is suggested whether it would not ho expedio it
to invent ibo department with the discretion to ailow
such other matter to be transmitted through
the mails, at corresponding rates of postage, rb the Post
master General shall by order designate and allow. The
public convenience and the revenues of tho department
would derive benefit from such discretionary power.
CARRIKR'8 KKK.
I renew the recommendation of my predecessor, that
power be given to tho department to regulate tho car
rier's fee, not exceeding the amount of two ccnts for tho
delivery of <.aoh lotter. It cannot bo sustained lit somo
of the cities and districts without an increased rat#, bo
long as it is discretionary with the party addressed to
employ the services of the carrier or not, no just reason
>8 perceived why the former discretion should not be
given lor tho purpose of facilitating so import act a
brand' of the postal service.
IjRANUI OKFlr.tS.
Requests have been made from several cities for the
establishment of brunch offices for tho receipt and do
livery of li tters auxiliary to the city Post ORice. 1 lru. e
boon unwilling to establish them without some provl l<n
being mado to meet the additional expense, for whicu i lie
same foo allowed to oarriers, one cent, would be siiiE
cient. By tho law authorizing their establishment (lbt7,
chapter 03, sec. 10) no charge is permitted for this addi
tional service. I respectfully suggest, for the considera
tion of Congress, tho propriety of amending that law and
of granting this authority; and also of investing this dc
Ktment with tho authority to erect in any city b >x-pil
for the receipt of letters to be mailed, to b>; thence
collected by carriers, for which the fee of one ccnt each
letter shall bo prepaid by stamps.
C WIFirATIOH OF POSTAL LAWS.
A revised code of the postal laws, bringing together in
proper arrangement the various statutes now gathered
only by tho examination of the legislation of many years,
would greatly facilitate the performance of their duties
by the numerous o:licers and agents atta^ lied to this de
partment. This subject is respectfully commended to tho
attention of Congress.
RAILROAD SERVICP.
In the la.",t annual report of my predecessor mention is
mado of tho refusal or neglect ol a large number of rail
road companies engaged il the conveyance of mails to
execute the contracts required by law of all contractors
for the performance of their duties. Tills abuse continues.
When a railroad is constructed through a district of
Oountry, competition in the conveyance of passengers,
mails and mo: than liso rouses on the route. Demand is
immediately made tor (ho mails, aud without reference to
the importance of the olliocs to be supplied, at a compen
sation m'.ich above that previously paid for coach nud
horse service. Increased speed is tho only ad
vantage which tho service gains, although with
respect to private business this is invariably accom
panied with a great reduction of cost. Tho
subject demands attention from Congress, and that mea
sures bo adopted to enable tbe government to contract on
fair terms with lli ac companies. The existing rates of
compensation are iu my judgment too high, and even at
such rates tho government is at tbe mercy of the com
panies. The government has the power to compel them
to carry tho mails at fair ratts, us it has the right to tho
use of all private property necessary for its purposes,
upon making Just compensation ; anil provision sh ield be
made to resort to this power when fair arrangements
cannot bo made by way oi con ti act. This would enable
the department to deal with the companies on equal
terms.
CT1ANGE OF CONTRACTS FOR DISH.0VA1.TY.
Soon after t tie commcucomont of my term of ofllco tho
country felt the sho^k of internecine arms. In view of
tho great crime ntt'-mpted against tho existenco of tho
nation , it became tho duty of this, in common with tho
other departments of the government, to put forth all its
Anergics to prevent tho consummation of that crime. By
tbe existing laws all pot masters and mail carriers, anil
nil other persons cngiifcd in handling the malls of tho
United States, or in clerical service, wero required to
tako the usual oath of allegiance to this govoiument,
ob well as for tho faithful performance of their duties.
Whenever it was made apparent by their declarations,
or by their conduct, that thero was a practical re
pudiation cf tho obligation of this oath, whether
the party was a postmaster or a postal contractor, I
ordered a rcmovlfl from olllce In tho one case and the
deprivation of contract in the other. Not only woe it
unsafe to intrust the transportation of tho malls to a per
son who rofuscd or failed to rccogniso the sanctions of an
?ath, but to continuo payment of public money to the
enemies of tho government and their allies, was to give
direct aid and comfort to treason in arms. 1 could not
thus permit this branch of government to contrlbuto to
its own overthrow. No other courso could have reusona- I
bly been expected by such contractors. The bona Jile
observanco of that oath, aud tho duty of allegiance i
itself, entered into anil became a condition, a
part of tho consideration, of tho contract itself.
This failing, the department was equitably and
legally discharged from its literal obligations.
Protection on the part of government, and alleglence on
the part of tho citizen, are correlative, and arc conditions
mutually depen lent In every contract, and the highest
public interest demanded the rigid enforcement of this
rulo of action. Occasional local and transient incon
venience resulted of necessity, but far lets than would
reasonably have been expected. Loyal men, everywhere,
sustained this action, and speedily furnished the requisite
means for continuing tho sorvico without increased ex
pense. Theiso changes wero mainly called for in parts
of Virginia and Maryland, and in Kentucky and Missouri.
In iuo same and m neighboring districts, the duties
of th ? appointment olllco have been very onerous
from the great number of changes required in post
offices according to changing phases of public senti
ment, individual action, aud military occupancy. It is
believed that these |Kisitions, with rare exceptions, aro
now held by men of unquestioned loyalty. Where such
men could not be found, tbe offices have been discon
tinued ratlior than they should be held by repudiutors of
public faith, and us d for purposes hostile to the per
petuity of our national institutions.
DISLOYAL PUBLICATIONS EXCLUDED FROM THE MAIIit.
This department was also called upon to act upon
another question, alike novel and important Vari
ous newspapers, having more or less influence within
tho si here of their circulation, woro represented to
be, and wero in fact, devoting their columns tn tho fur
therance of the schemes or oir national enemies. These
eflbrts were persistently directed to the advancement of
hostile interests, to thwart tlio efforts made to preserve
tho integrity of tho Union, and to accomplish tho results
of open treason without incurring its judicial penalties. To
await the rosults of slow judicial prosecution was to allow
crime to be consumatod, with tho expectation of subse
quent punishment, instead of preventing its accomplish
ment by prompt and diroct interference.
The f'roedom of the press is secured by a high constitu
tional sanction. Rut it is freedom and not .'icense that is
guaranteed. It is to bo used only for lawful purposes. It
cannot aim blows at tho existence of the government, tho
constitution and the onion, nud at the same titne claim Its
protection. As well could the assassin strike bis blow at
human life, it the Siimu time claiming that ins victim
ebotild not commit a breach of tho peace by a counter
blow. While, therefore, this department neither enjoyed
nor claimed the power t'i suppress such treasonable pub
lications, but left them frco to publish what they pleased,
it could not be called u poo to give them circulation. Jt
could not and would not interfere with tho freedom se?jred
Tiy law, but It could and did obstruct the dissemination
cif that license which was without the pale ol tho eoasti
tutionond law. Tbe inaUs established by !!>e I t. it u
States government could not, apon au> kuowi princii
of law or public right, be t'or its destruction A
well could tho common carrier tie legolly required to
transport a machine designed for th<? destruction of tb?
?vehicle conveying it, or an Innkeeper be compelled to en
tertain a traveller whom Ji ? 'uk w to bo Intending to com
lnit a robbery In his ho". ?
I ilnd these v ie?.a supported by the itigh authority of
tho latoJiHtice Story, of the S'ipf.'m# Court of the I'nited
States. Qe says in i-n imenting on that clause of the
constitution re, urlug tho freedom of the preffs:?
' That this amendment was intended to cure to on ory
rfti^-n ati absolute ri^ht to speak, or write, or print what
soever ho mi>ht. please, without nny responsibility/
imblic er private therefor, id a supposition too wild to be
Indulged in by any rational man. This would be to allow
to every citizen the right to destroy itt bis pleasure the
reputnlion, the |ieace, the property, and even th- per
Bonal safety, of every other citizen. A inan might, out
of mere malice or revenge, accuse another of the in< st
infamous crimes; might excite agaln6t bim the indigna
tiuu ( f all his fellow citizens by the most atrocious calum
nies; might disturb, nay, overturn all his domestic
pence and embitter his parental iiflecti ms; might inllict
the most distressing punishments upon the weak, the
timid and the innocont; mluht prejudice all a man's civil
and political and private rights, and might stir up sedi
tion, rebellion and treason, even against the government
itself, iu the wantonnou of bis passions or the corruption
of Ins heart. Civil society could not go on under such
circumstances. Men would then be obliged to resort to
private vengeance to make up the deficiency of
the law; and assassinations and savn^o cruellies would bo
perpetrated with all the frequency belonging to barbarous
and cruel communities. It is plain, then, that the lan
guage of this amendment imports no mare than that every
man has a right lo spoak, write and print his jpiulons
uj.oii any subject whatever, without any prior restraint,
so always that he does not injure any other peiS'n in his
rights, person, property or reputation; and so always that
ho does not thereby disturb tbu public peace, or attempt
to subvert the government."
Of the cases presented for my action, upon the princi
pies above named, 1 have, liy order exclvded from the
mailt twelve of these treasonable publications, of which
s .'Veral h id been previously presented by tlic grand jury
as incendiary and li'istilo to constitutional nrtkority.

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.
TmmPDAY, Dec. 5?6 P. M.
Money grows more abundant day by day. Bank
ers and brokers refuse to allow over three percent
for money deposited with them, and many houses
decline to receive money at any rate of interest.
Still the street brokers generally pay 0 per cent for
loans on stocks. First class paper passes easily at
5 a 5% per cent, and names which till lately were
not current except at very high rates can now be
passed at 7 a 8 per cent. It does not seem to have
been remarked that the distinct pledges contained
in the President's Message and the reports of the
departments, with regard to the recovery of
Southern debts due to loyal creditors, Impart a new
value to paper which has been in very low repute
here since the war broke out. Congress will proba
bly at this session provide a means for the recovery
of these debts, and thus a large portion of what
is generally considered "dead paper" by our banks
may turn out more valuable than is supposed
Quite a large number of Southern debtors would
pay what they owe but for fear of the despotism
under which they live. The consciences of the
more dishonest debtors will have to be quickened
by our troops.
Nothing is doing in exchange to-day. Some
leading bankers cling to the belief that rates mnst
advance and specie flow out. It is abundantly
evident that, even if their views are correct, the
flow of spocie could not prove so heavy as to in
convenience the banks: there is no such demand
for bills as could cause a weekly shipment of over
a quarter of a million. We could spare twenty
millions to advantage.
Stocks Were quiet to-day. Business remains
dull, operators generally being anxious to hear
from England and to read the report of the Secre
tary of the Treasury before buying. Virginia sixes
rose 1 percent; Missonris were steady. The move
ment in the railway shares was irregular. Galena
rost %, Rock Island %, Michigan guaranteed %;
while, on the other ban 1, Erie declined %, Hudson
%, Harlem preferred %, Reading %, Michigan
Central %, Milwaukee and Prairie du Chien%, Cen
tral, Harlcni old Panama, Illinois Central, Toledo

The National Hank Note Company arc printing
the bonds for the last United States loan of
$50,000,000. They will be registered bone's of
$1,000, $-),000 and $10,000, and coupon bond? with
scrai-anniiul coupons attached, of the denomina
tions of $500 and $1,000, having twenty years to
run. The coupon bonds are to be protected t > the
peculiar tint work patented by the National L. :ik
Note Company, which has proved such an effectual
safeguard against counterfeiting, and which has
been adopted by a number of banks wl se notes,
made by the old combination of engravers, have
been successfully counterfeited of late. .This new
contrivance, by multiplying the name of the insti
tution and denomination of the note many times,
prevents alteration, while the difficulty of copying
the intricate work defeats the art of the hand en"
graver, and the introduction of various colors
proves an insurmountable obstacle to tie photo
grapher. It is well known that the United
States demand notes are of that cx< eedinely
black, heavy, coarse style of work which
has beon so successfully counterfeited of
late, and it would be well for the govern
mcntto procureanew sctof plates, with tie 1at< s*
improvements, in anticipation ol the discovery of
counterfeits. The first instalment ol the second
batch of 7.30 notes will go on to Washington to"
morrow. The company has already transmitted to
Washington about $29,000,000 of demand notes,
$19,000,000 of which Mr. Chase is believed to have
issued.
Mr. John A. Stevens, President of the Bank of
Commerce, is in Washington, in consultation with
the Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Stevens is
popularly supposed to be in favor of a national
bank of issue, whose notes shall be a legal tender;
such a bank to be, if required, a bank of deposit,
but on no account a bank of discount. The pub
lic were disappointed to-day at not receiving the
report of the Secretary of the Treasury; it will not
be ready until Saturday, and it is probable that
the New York public may not be enabled to read
it before Monday or Tuesday. When the Secreta
ry was here a few days ago, he stated to friends
that he had not determined upon a financial policy.
He knew, when he said this, that it would be
necessary to adopt gome new policy, as the re
sources of the associated banks can hardly enable
them to shoulder more than perhaps $100,000,000
beyond what they have taken already. The public
have relieved them of some $10,000,000 of 7.30
notes, and the popular subscriptions continue fair:
but it is idle to disguise the fact thn* they do not
supply money as fast as it is needed by the govern
ment, or as fast as it should be supplied in order
to enable the banks to place fifty millions to the
?credit of the Treasury Department every sixty or
ninety (lays. There are many who believe that the
difficulty will be overcome by authorizing a further
is?-ue of say $200,000,000 of United States note*,
beating no interest, and creating them a legal ten
di'i The public is fully prepared for something of
?',(> Wind, and, so long as the government pro
? steB the war with vigor and energy, and people
are allowed to hope that the rebellign will t,?
t s peedily and thoroughly crushed out, almost any
t quantity of government paper will be received with
i AMcrity and floated for an indefinite period.
The Sob-Treasurer has called upon the banks for
j another instalment of ten per cent on the secont)
fifty million loan. When this is paid, ninety per
cent of tho whole loan will have been drawn bv
the Sub-Treasurers, and the associated banks will
have $5? ,000,000 to the credit of government. The
following was the business of the Sub-Treasury to
