OBITUARY.
Hon. E. I. Humphrey, m Distinguished 3Iin
ister of the Presbyterian Clinrch.
Louisville, Ky,, Dec. 9. Rev. Dr. E. P.
Humphrey, on of the oldest and most distin
guished ministers in the Sooth, died suddenly
this afternoon, at the residence of his son,' Judge
Alex. P. Humphrey, in this city. Dr. Humphrey
was not only noted throughout Kentucky and
the South, but his reputation was extensive in
the East, and he was reearded as one of the
ablest men in the Presbyterian Church. He
was born at Fairfield, Conn., Jan. 8. 1809, and
was consequently in his seventy-fifth year at the
time of his death. His father was a Presbyter
ian minister, and president of Amherst College,
Massachusetts. Dr. Humphrey acquired bis
collegiate ed oration at tbat Institution, and
graduated in 1828. He pursued his professional
studies at Andorer Thelngieal Seminary, and
was licensed to preach in 1833.
Other Deaths.
BcrrALO. Dec. 9. Thomas Coatesworth, a
prominent Business man of Buffalo, died this
morning, aged sixty-six. He was owner of one
of the largest elevators in the city.
Washington; Dec 9 Capt. S. S. Blackford,
formerly of the Capitol police, dropped dead
on Indiana avenue, this city, about half-past 10
this morning. Capt. Blackford was originally
from Ohio, but after serving throughout the
late war, and losing an arm in battle, he came
to this city to live, and was for several years
captain of the Capitol police. He was subse
quently connected with the Agricultural Depart
ment, where be was employed at the time of his
death. He leaves a widow and one daughter.
Capt Blackford has been a familiar figure about
the. Commissioner 's office since the beginning of
of the license year, and he has probably done
more hard work in the temperance cause than,
any other person in the District,

Mrs. B. was so touched that next d ar she
came to THE WHEN and bought a complete

cuffs and handkerchiefs. Then she bought
him a, lot of goods to put in them, and a pair

Efforts to Form tiin Molders of the Country
Into vompact Boay.
Cleveland, Dec. 9. A national convention
ef raol-iecs, wPV'jsfrs Knights of Labor, has
been in session fu this city almost continuously
for two days, an i delegates are present from all
large cities of the United States and Canada.
The convention was called for the general
benefit of tbe trade and a more perfect organiza
tion. The prime object is to form State assem
blies of Knights of Labor, composed exclusively
molders. aod in this way, with effective
workers to draw more men into their ranks.
Then an attempt will be made to have all
Knights who are not members of tho molders'
union to join the latter organization, thus
making a double compact.
The Revolt Among the Knights.
Philadelphia, Deo, 9. Members of the pro
visional committee of Philadelphia Knights of
Labor, who issued tbe anti-administra'.ion circu
lar on Saturday last, have received responses
from nearly every section of the country. It is
said that the committee is surprised at the sup
port it is receiving, and it is anticipated that
representatives from all the disaffected local as
semblies will soon meet in convention to formu
late plans for union.

Pittsburg, Dec 9. This afternoon President
0 Smith, of the American Flint glass Workers'
Association, ordered a general strike of the
tableware workmen, to take effect to-morrow.

Strong Evidence Against Kobinson.
Cleveland. Dec. 9. In the trial of James
Robinson, at Ravenna, to-day, strong testimony
against the prisoner was introduced by the
State. Carl Grimm, a Cleveland saloon-keeper,
swore tbat Robinson was in his place the night
of tbe robbery of Benedict & Ruedy's store.
Two of Benedict & Ruedy's clerks testified that
Robinson was in the store the day before the
burglary. Baggageman Kinney, of the Cleve
land & Pittsburg road, identified the prisoner as
one of the men who went with the stolen furs to
Pittsburg. A. R. Todd, a brake man on the
Pittsburg," Ft. Wayne & Chicago road, posi
tively declared that Robinson rode on his train
from Pittsburg to Alliance on the night of the
tragedy, and conductor Ohiigher. of tbe Cleve
land & Pittsburg road, was pretty certain that
Robinson was a passenger on hi train from Al
liance to Ravenna. Rev. Carl Weiss, a passen
ger on the train, positively identified the pris
oner as one of tbe men who assisted in the res
cue of McMunn.

cates of a June encampment held their gronnd
vigorously, the committee decided to yield to
the wishes of tbe local committee, and selected
Sept. 12 as tbe date for tbe assembling of the
encampment. Regarding the Grant memorial
proposed to be erected in Washington, the com
mittee favored a simple testimonial to cost not
more than $30,000. This evening a reception
was tendered Commander Rea and staff and the

CARNOT'S DIFFICULTIES.
Goblet Finds Dlranelf Unable to Form a Cabi
net, and Faliieret Uodert tket the Task.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
London, Dec 9. M. Goblet has informed
President Carnot that, owing to the refusal of
several statesmen to join him, he is enable to
form a Cabinet Tbe President has therefore
made another appeal to M. Fallieres, who has
aereed to undertake the task. The fact that
there is a lack of cohesion among the French
Republican factions which is almost hopeless, is
abundantly evidenced by President Carnot's ill
success in forming a Cabinet, and his nomina
tion of M. Fallieres to undertake the work
abandoned by M. Goblet confirms tbe desperate
straits in which the President finds himself.
M. Fallieres is proverbially a weak
man in respect of everything that
combines to constitute a statesman, and could
not in any circumstance command the robust re
spect necessary to control the Chamber in his
capacity as Premier. He occupied the position
of Prime Minister on a previous occasion for a
period of ten days, and on the eleventh day,
while addressing the Chamber, completely col
lapsed and came very near dying from the effects
of overexertion and worriment, his brain hav
ing temporarily given way. It is believed by
many who admire the gentleman's personal
qualities that M. Fallieres has never fully recov
ered from that attack, and it is confidently pre
dicted that he would permanently loose bis mind
should he again attempt to fill an office much
too broad in its scope for his mental
grasp. To men not thoroughly imbued
with the idea that tbe President is
wholly ingenuous it is evident that M. Carnot is
seeking a weak and inoffensive man as Premier,
hoping thus to control the Ministry himself,,
while the strong men in the Cabinet he would'
place in subordinate positions. Such a combina-:
tion would doubtless work well if the 'iror f
men could be induced to submit to 51. Car not"
domination, but this seems to be furtl rv
moved from possibility than even the harmoniz
ing of the Republican groups, and another
presidential election may be found necessary at
a means of terminating the crisis, which does
not seem to have been finally dissipated by the
peaceful election of Gravy's successor last Satur
day. It is definitely known that M. Fallieres will

The Radical groups will meet soon to discuss
the attitude to be taken by the party toward M.

The Paris states that the first act of tbe new
Ministry will be tbe adoption of repressive
measures against the Paris Municipal Council.
With this object in view a bill will be introduced
to modify the mode in whicb members tf the

Money That Grevy Saved.
Paris Dispatch in London Daily TelecrapU.
Economists are amusing themselves just now
with calculations as to M. Jules Grevy's savings
during bis tenure of office as head of the state.
The figures brought forward show that the "old
Juras3ien" must have feathered his nest very
nicely, and that, with the natural instinct of the
French peasant, he must have rilled many a
'long stocking" with his pay and his perquisites.
His expenses amounted to an average of 780
per month, so that he had a clear 9GC,O0Of, or
38,640 at the end of the year. Tbe state paid
for tbe warmin&r, cleaning and repairs of bis
dwellings, as well as for the expenses connected
with tbe nseful work of the blanchisscuses de
gros and de fin who looked af ler the presidential
linen and bleached the presidential table
cloths. It was the generous state, too,
which paid nearly 3.000 for the "installation'',
of "son-in-law Daniel's" offices aod secretaries
at the Elysee, and, as the economists and calcu
lators remarK with sighs and groans, it is proba
bly the state which will have to ray for "Dan
iel's deroenagement" from the Elysee and the
"installation" of his bnreancratio and domestic
accessories in the magnificent mansion whicb he
is to inhabit in tbe Avenue de Jena. It will thus
be seen that, if M. Grevy did not spend with the
lavish munificence of a parvenu or a nouveau
riche, he was not deeply imbued with a demo
cratic disdain for bullion.
FREDERICK WILXIA3T.
The Physicians Have Not Changed Their
Opinion Letter from the Stricken Prince.
Berlin, Dec 9. It is reliably stated that the
physicians who conducted the examination of
the diseased part of the Crown Prince's throat
have not, as previously reported, changed their
original opinions regarding the nature of tbe
malady. The statement that any of them en
tertain optimistic views with regard to the ulti
mate recovery of the patient is entirely without
foundation.
Crown Prince Frederick William, in a letter
dated Dec 4, writes from San Remo that the
inflammation and other dangerous symptoms of
his disease bavs subsided under treatment, and
tbat bis general physical health has all along
been excellent. He has never, be says, at any
time lost strength. His appetite is, and
has been good, and his appearance
is that of a person in perfect " health.
He purposelv communicates these details for
the reason tbat exaggerated accounts of his
condition have beon circulated. He has full
confidence in bis Dhysicians. in spite of tbe at
tacks made upon them by newspapers and oth
ers, and expresses the hote that he may, per
haps, after long and carefnl treatment, be able
to again devoie himself to the fatherland.
M. SADI-CARNOT-S ANCESTRY.
The Story of Ilia Grandfather, the "Organ
izer of Victory."
Chicago News.
As Napoleon III became President of the
republio and Emperor of France, not so much
on account of his own personal abilities and
deeds as for the reason that he was '"the nephew
of bis uncle." so iSadi-Carcot has just been
elected President of tbe French republic, not so
much for what he has done himself as for the
reaeon that be is the grandson of bis grand
father. Modern France is poor in great men
livine, but has an abundance of men bearing
the names of the truly great men of a past gen
eration. One of these, a man of genius, was Lazarus
Nicholas Marguerite Carnot, the "organizer of
victory", cf the first French republic. He was
thirty-eight vears old when elected a member of
the National" Assembly in 1791, in which body
he rapidly achieved distinction through the ex
treme scope of his revolutionary fanaticism.' He
proposed the confiscation of the property of the
church and the nobility and tbe destruction of
all the fendal castles, and voted for the execu
tion of the King. But not until he took hold of
the direction of the army did his genius fully
declare itself. His call upon tbe masses of the
people to enlist was the first step toward the
modern universal oblieation to military service.
The first army thns formed from the ranks of
the people Carnot led in person against the Aus
trians and achieved some substantial successes
at Wattignies in 1793, He directed the move
ments of Pichgru and Jourdan in 1794 and 1795,
and continued to be the moving spirit in all the
sobseQuent military successes of tbe republic.
Through him Napoleon was appointed gen-eral-in-cbief
of the Italian army. But when Na
poleon, after his successes, was elected consul
for life, Carnot. true to his republican princi
ples, thenceforth opposed him to the last. Soon
after Napoleon's assumption of the imperial
crown Carnot withdrew from public life alto
gether. After the Russian campaign, however,
when be believed France in danger, he came
forward again and offered Napoleon his services.
He was appointed governor of Antwerp and held
the city until after the downfall of Napoleon.
After the restoration of the Bourbon king he
continued true to the anti-royalint party but
soon left France and lived in exile at Magde
burg until his death in 1823.
Napoleon I, with.bis unrivaled insiebt into
the character and value of men, paid of Carnot,
he was a "silly fellow and easily dured." and
Carnot con firmed the estimate of his silly egotism
by pretending to be tbe savior of bis country by
directing to have the single word "Carnot" in
scribed upon his tombstone, and saying that
"France would look upon his grave as a place
of pilgrimage.'" The French do not go so far as
that, but they really consider Carnot the most
adorable, though not the most glorious, hero of
tbe revolution.
The following anecdote, by no means of his
torical authenticity, nevertheless iudicates the
extravagance of tbe faith the French reposed in
the resources found in the genuis of Carnot.
'After tbe battle of Waterloo 'Napoleon in bis
flight stopped for a short rest at a roadside inn,
when" an old officer stepped hastily into his room
and sainted curtly. It was Carnot. "You are lost,
sire." were his first words. Thwre was no reply.
"Have you conceived a plan to save your coun
try and mine, sireP continued Carnot. Abrug
of the shoulders was all the reply. Then Carnot
pulled a paper from his-pocket and handing it
to Ni.poieon said: "There is a plan, sire, made by
yonr old master in the art of war.
Follow it strictly and you will
yet save our France." Napoleon
took the paper. "But," added the narrator,
"Napoleon did not take the advice, he did not
folio7 Carnot's plan, and France was lost." So
deep roted is the faith in Carnot's genius in tbe
French mind that anecdotes like the above are
invented to show that even after Waterloo it
was only Napoleon's supercilious contempt for
Carnot' advice tbat brought about the final de
feat of France.
It is this intetsity of admiration for the Car
not of the revolutionary period to which ftl. Sadi
Carnot now owes bis elevation to the presidency.
His father, Hippolyte Carnot, still alive, was
never cf any real importance in public life.
Nevertheless, his steady adherence to republic
an principles made the French believe that the
revolutionary tendency was hereditary in the
Carnot family. Hippolyte went so far as at one
time to embrace socialistic opinions, but he
soon changed bis mind again. Under tbe sec
ond empire he made it a point to follow his
father's example of opposition to Napoleon by
refusing to take the oath of allegianse to the
Emperor when elected to the Legislative A&seui
bly. Tbat demonstration was repeated three
times, and it constitutes about tbe whole of the
public life of Carnot the father.
Francois Sadi-Carnot, bis son, is now fifty
years old. He is a civil and naval engineer. He
did distinguished service to the government of
j the national aerense, in iou-x. i

pected t continue the conservative policy fol
lowed bv bis predecessor, Grevy. He has given
much time to economic studies, chiefly to tho
works of John Stuart Mill. 6ome of which he has
translated. That knowledge of economics may
become of great advantage to the French treas
ury in its present fearful condition of confusion
ant deficit.
Not having done anythins as yet of sufficient
prominence to warrant a judgment upon tbe nat
ure and force of his ineenuitr, he is, neverthe
less, hopefully looked upon by all the parties of
the political world of France, while the other
European powers will stand on guard and wait.
They may be supposed to propound the question
whether the grandson is inclined to believe him
self the heir of his grandfather's military gen
ius. Should he become inflated with auy such
ilea he may consider himself destined to be an
other "organizer of victory," and proceed to
plunge a continent into war.
GENLKAL FORKIGN NEWS.
The Bl.mnrck Forgeries Believed to Be the
Work ot Important Personages.
Beklin, Dec. 9. The Cologne Gazette says
that Russia's hesitation justifies the sunposition
that the publication of the forged letters sent to
!the Czar concerning the relations between Ger
many and Russia would lead to the indentifica
tion and compromise of importance personages.
"We must assume," says tbe paper, "that per
sonages sheltered by sex or position co-operated
to place the forgeries in the Czar's hands. Such
instruments could be found in French ladies
married into noble Russian families. Besides
these, there are Russian officials and ex-diplo-mates
and Jesuit and Polish elements who have
actively worked to produce a breach between
Russia and Germany."
Germany's New Military Bill.
Berlin, Dec. 9. The new military bill re
quires Germans in the second class of the land
wehr to remain liable to service until they have
completed their thirty-ninth year, after which
time they are allowed unrestricted liberty, and
may emigrate. The first class of tbe landsturm,
which consists of men no to the age of forty
two years, capable of bearing arms, but who
are not serving in any branch of the army,
will hereafter remain liable to service until the
age of thirty-nine. The second class of the
landsturm is made to comprise those who have
served, or are liable to serve, and are between
thirtv-nine and forty-five years of aga. The
general effect of the bill is to increase the active
reserve.
Itnssla'a Military Movements.
St. Petersburg, Dec. 9. It is semi-offieially
slated that the reports published in the Aus
trian and German newspapers regarding the
movements of Russian, troops are incorrect.
Since the return of tbe Czar from Copenhagen
there has been no order issued to reinforce the
troops on the Galician frontier, the recent move
ments in tbat locality having been made in obe
dience to orders issued more than a year ago.

MR. BLAINE'S POSITION.
While Not Seeking the Nomination, lie
Will Not Run Away from It.
Washington Special. I
"Joe" Manley, of Maine, one of Blaine's clos
est friends, who is here, has this to say of the
relations of Mr. Blaine to the Republican presi
dential nomination: Mr. Manley was asked if
the interview with Mr. Blaine cabled from
I aris was to be regarded as an announcement
that he is a candidate. 31 r. Manley said that
the interview did not indicate tbat; that it
showed simply that Mr. Blaine is an enthusiast
in the cause of protection, and cannot keep
silent under what seemed to him such great
provocation; that Mr. Blaine does not care for
the nomination; that every member of his fam
ily objects to bis acceptance of a nomination;
that Mr. Blaine could add nothing to his fame
by being President; tbat he has means enongb
to live comfortably, is contented, and is busy
with things that interest him; tbat be could get
no rest in the presidency; that, on the contrary,
he would be "hauled about" by the thousands
whom he knows, and tnat he would not look
forward to another candidacy with any degree
of pleasure. Mr. Manley was asked if it was
probable that Mr. Blaine would announce that
Ire was not in the field, and make way for other
combinations. He replied that Mr. Blaine's
friends have insisted tbat he ought not to do
that; tbat it might injure the party and create
the impression that Mr. Blame considers Repub
lican success doubtful, and that it was his duty
to the party to keep silent on the subject, and
to accept the nomination if it should be tendered
to him. Mr. Manley was of the opinion that
Mr. Blaine would accept the nomination if the
convention should tender it to him.

Sirs OR MATTERS
Where the Democrats Look for Assistance
la Their Anti-Tariff Campaign,
gpeclal to the Indianapolis Journal.
Washington, Dee. 9. There is just one heps
for the tariff reformers in Congress, and tbat
hope lies In tbe assistance of a number of West
ern and Northwestern Republicans who want
changes in the tariff. The followers of Mr.
Randall, w&o sternly oppose a reform of the
tariff, are as numerous and as potent as they ever
were. But there is no disguising the fact that
there are quite a number of Republican members
from Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, and one or
two other prairie States who are willing to assist
in reducing the taiiff. But. inasmuch as the
administration Las determined to have free
wool, it may to that these Republicans will not
favor any kind of a measure that may be
brought up. In any event, tbe Democrats
from Ohio will refuse to vote for a bill in which
is free wool. The tariff reformers will also
drive from the Democratic party in the House m
number of votes on account of the failure to
atiolieb internal-revenue taxation. A majority
of tbe Democrats would prefer the abolition of
the internal taxes to a reform of the customs
duties, were it not for the fact that tbe party is
pledged to tbe latter. A very strong effort will
be made, by the administration, to have a tariff
bill passed embracing what was outlined in tbe
President's message.
Little linpe for Dakota.
Special ta the IndianaDolls J"urniu.
Washington, Dec 9. The people in Dakota
who have been voting on and working for state
hood during tbe past four or five years, are
about ready to throw np their - bands. Mr.
Springer, of Illinois, who is to be chairman of
the House committee on Territories, announces
his determination to fight the admission cf Da
kota if tbe Territory is to be divided, and since
the great bulk of the people in Dakota wans
division on an east and west line more than
they want statehood, because there ia nothing
homogeneous between the north and south sec
tions, nrefer to stay out in the cold to coming ia
without division. Tbey will simply ask lor divis
ion, and if tbey cannot get that they will likely
have nothing. They declare that Mr. Springer
is opposed to statehood as well as division, be
cause he knows' that statehood for tbe whole
Territory is im practicable, and that as long as
he talks about it on that score be puts the ques
tion beyond the pale of practicability.
