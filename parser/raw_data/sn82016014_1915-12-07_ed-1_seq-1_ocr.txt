AYashington, Iec. 7. -PrewMlent
Wilson in bis annual address to
eoiigi e.-s today laid down the ad
ministration plans for national
defense and told his hearers it
was necessary for I he new and
br in d doct r ine of la n-Amor ica.
With sharp words tie arraigned
American cii izens who by their
sympathy ftr the foreign belliger
ent had endangered tiie neutral
ity of the 1'iiitetl States.
America never witnessed any
thing like this before. declared
the president with deep feeling.
The president's outline of the
plans for national defense and the
need l'r them was received in
silenee by the senators and repre
sentatives hut with rapt attention
and deepest interest.
Wo insist on security in prosecut
ing our self chosen lines of national
development," said he. "We do more
than that. We demand it also for
others. We do not coating our en
thusiasm for individual liberty and
free national development to the in
cidents and movements of affairs
which affect only ourselves. We feel
It wherever there is a people that
tries t- walk in these difficult paths,
of independence and rig lit. From
the first we have made common cause
with all partisans of liberty on this
side tiie sea and have deemed it as
important that our neighbors should
he free from all outside domination
as that we ourselves should be; have
set America aside as a whole frr he
uses of independent nations and pol
itical freedom."
Then a tense silence settled down
over the hall as the president began
reading in a low, even voice which
could be heard everywhere. His ref
erence to all parts of the American
continent standing so far as we are
concerned on a "footing of genuine
equality." aroused the first applause.
Then the allusion to "I'nited States
aid but not coercion" of Mexico, evok
ed more enthusiasm. Many members
followed the address from the printed
copy.
Mrs. Gait There.
Mrs. Gait watched the president
closely, but occasionally glanced over
the house galleries. Another burst of
applause followed the reference to
"setting America aside as a whole for
the uses of independent nations and
political freemen."
Slap at Foreigner-.
When he referred to foreigners
within the I'nited States hoi-dors,
who while small in number "have
brought deep disgrnee npon us.
and necessitate use of processes of
law ny which we may Ik4 purged
of t heir corrupt d istempers.M
the greatest enthusiasm was
shown, and loud applause inter
rupted. Finally, at 1:42 o'clock after
having been reading steadily
more than an hour, the president
finisluMl. and another outburst of
cheering; took plae as he left the
chamber anil started back to I he
White House. The joint session
dissolved, the senate filed hack to

Berlin, Dec. 7. The war office an
nounced today that the French forces
in southwestern Herbia near the Var
dar river, have been compelled to re
treat. The capture of Ipek, Montenegro,
also is announced.
German participation on a large
scale in the Mesopotamian campaign
is probable, according to reports
reaching Switzerland. The naming of
Field Marshal Von Der Goltz as com
mander of the Turkish forces in
Mesopotamia is commented upon in
this connection.
In some quarters it is suimised that
German efforts against the British in
the east may be directed towards the
Persian gulf rather than the Suez
canal, as has been hinted. The gen
eral war council of the entente allies
is being continued in Paris under the
presidency of General J off re, the
French commander in chief. An un
confirmed report that a Bulgarian in
fantry regiment mutinied when or
dered to the Gallipoli peninsula to
fight with the Turks has reached
London through Amsterdam. Three
hundred of the mutineers are said
to have been shot.
Distrust of Greece continues to be
expressed by the press of the entente
powers, notably by French and Italian
newspapers. More vigorous measures
to induce Greece to comply with the
allied demands are again being urged.
According to reports through Hol
land, the German lines? In France and
Belgium have been heavily reinforced
within the past fortnight.
The reaswmbling of the Russian
duma, set for December 18, has been
indefinitely postponed by an imperial

Democrats Want President in

Xatlonal Convention to St.
Louis, Is Report.
Washington, Dec. 7. The Demo
cratic national convention at St. Louis,
June 12. 1916, with Woodrow Wilson
as presidential nominee, appeared the
probable result of the national meet
ing today of the Democratic national
committee.
Sentiment among the Democratic
chieftains this afternoon veered
toward St. Louis as the probable con
vention city. The fight narrowed
down to the Missouri metropolis, Chi
cago and Dallas, with the strength in
the order named. Balloting was ex
pected to begin about four o'clock.
BEST IfH YEARS
Retail Business Is Unusually
Heavy in Topeka.
Prosperity Is Apparent
Every Line of Trade.
in
"The best since 1907.
This Is the verdict of the leading
business men in six lines of merchan
dising in Topeka in answer to a ques
tionaire issued by the Associated Ad
vertising Clubs of America. The busi
ness condition of Topeka is so good
that the merchants unhesitatingly
name this year as the best in the last
eight.
J. Will Kelley, secretary of the
Commercial club, gave out the ques-
tionaires to the business men at the
request of the New York office of th
Associated Advertising Clubs. The
data compiled will be used in a com
parative report of business conditions
in all parts of the country.
In Topeka datum was gathered
from dry goods stores, clothing stores,
hardware uteres, jewelry stores and
drug stores. The condition in thes-
lines is taken to be indicative of the
general business thermometer.
Lots of Silverware.
Jewelry Ftore owners say that peo
ple are buving more solid silverware
this year than ever before. This can
be taken as a good indication of pros
perity, the storekeepers say.
The statements of the various stores
show a healthy increase in the per
centage of business in November, 1915,
ovr a similar period in 1914.
The paper bouses in Topeka are do
ing more business this year than ever
before, which indicates that there is a
general increase in all lines of trade,
as most merchants use paper to wrap
their packages. The increase in wrap

Germans Turn
to Smite French
in Balkan Crash
London, Dec. 7. The campaign
against the main Serbian armies
having been closed, it is expected
..General von Gallwitz, with his
German forces, will join the Bul
garians in Macedonia in an effort
to crush the French and British
-armies before they become much
stronger.
Information from Berlin indi
cates that the German forces en
gaged in the earlier movements in
the Balkans have now been de
tached for the purpose of sharing
in the attack on the Franco-British
forces along the southern
Macedonian front. Dispatches
from Athens partly corroborate
this theory.
As it is reported, two German
divisions are co-operating with
the Bulgarians near Strumitsa.
There is little to report from
the other fronts, save the usual
minor operations. The French,
however, are carrying on a par
. tieularly energetic bombardment
of the German lines in the Cham
pagne. In Mesopotamia the Germans
. are beginning to show consider
- able . interests in the campaign
which is developing in favor of
the Turkish allies.
It is reported from Geneva that
, the Germans under Field Marshal
'; Von Der Goltz are preparing an
- extensive, campaign which will be
' directed toward the Persian gulf
by way of Bagdad.
Further impetus is gien to
. peace talk by the papal consistory,
at which Pope Benedict delivered
an address calling upon the bel
ligerents to make a just and im
mediate peace.
The effect of the dismissal of
the German military and naval
attaches at Washington on the
German public is not ascertain
able, aa the German newspapers
have not been permitted to pub
lish even the bare facts of the
incident.

I . ,
j German Embassy ay Action Is
'Very Unfriendly."
Washington, Dec. 7. Emphatic re
fusal by the state department of the
reasons actuating the United States in
The action was interpreted at the
Germany embassy today as "very un
friendly' The German government, through
Ambassador Bernstorff at Washing
ton, and Ambasador Gerald at Ber
lin, it was stated at the embassy had
requested that the reasons for the re
call be given privately to the German
government; if the state department
did not care to make public the
reasons.
Secretary Lansing, in his reply, re
fused any information either privately
or publicly, it was said.
State department officials made no
attempt to minimize the effect such a
reply would have upon the German
government, but it was pointed out
that Secretary Lansing is abiding
strictly by custom in his refusal, and
furthermore, that the refusal has the
effect of calling for a show down on
the part of Germany.
Right up to the moment of leaving
for the capitol, the president dis
cussed with the cabinet today the sit
uation between Germany and the
United States. Armed with all infor
mation possessed by the state and jus
tice departments regarding the activi
ties of the German diplomats, the pres
ident left to give his scathing arraign
men of hyphenated Americans who
plan conspiracy against this govern
ment. Whether the German government is
behind the activities of Boy-Ed and
Von Papen and whether it sanctions
and approves their acts is the key to
the situation as the cabinet sees it.
The declaration of the president was
1 made today with the cabinet's full
approval.
Back of Mexican Revolution.
The department of justice Is still
investigating reports that German
agents were back of alleged plans
for a counter revolution in Mexico to j
be heade dby General Huerta. Attor-f
ney General Gregory said today, how
ever, that no new information on the
subject had been called to his atten
tion recently.
One reason why the American gov
ernment will not furnish Germany
with specific reason for the request
for the recall of Captain Boy-Ed and
Captain Von Papen is its determina-
tion to keep secret the sources of its
information.
Wilson Approves It.
President Wilson has fully approved
Secretary Lansing's decision and it
was said authoritatively today it will
be adhered to no matter what Ger
many does.

T. Price of Minneapolis in hurling
Price's wife to her death over a cliff,
Charles D. Etcheison, a traveling
salesman of Washington, D. C, is due

tion. Mrs. Price was killed November 28,
1914, one day after she had been giv
en $60,000 by her father.
Etcheison was arrested in Washing
ton Sunday, by operatives of a private
detective agency, and was brought to
Chicago last night. Accompanying
him was Mr. Armstrong, who said the
prisoner had confessed.
"Mrs. Price was the daughter of Da
vid H. Fridley, member of one of the
oldest Minneapolis families,' Etchei
son is reported to have said in his
confession, 'and the day after she got
the money she and Price and I went
to the matinee together. We returned
to the Price home, and Price suggest
ed an automobile ride.
"She sat in the rear with her dog
Price and I in front. Price stopped
the ear near a steep embankment. He
muttered something about tire trouble
and asked his wife if she did not want
to get out and give the dog some
exercise.
"As Mrs. Price stepped out, Price
put one arm in front of her and I put
an arm .in front and we gave a fling.
Down she went. Price picked up the
dog and threw it after his wife."
When they climbed down the em
bankment, Etcheison is reported to
have said, they found the woman still
alive, and Price struck her head with
a stone.
"We told everybody that she step
ped over the cliff to save her dog,"
the officials said Etchieson confessed.
"Price cancelled my noties for
$1,200 he held, and gave me $3,500
to boot."
Stand by Husband.
Minneapolis, Dec. 7. Etchison and
his wife in company with George
Armstrong, assistant county attorney,
arrived here shortly before noon. Mr.
Armstrong said that when Etchison
confessed to the crime in a room in
a Chicago hotel yesterday, Mrs. Etchi
son, who had professed great con
fidence in her husband's innocence,
fell in a faint. She said she would
stand by her husband. Etchison was
taken to the county jail.

and in Mexico itself. The governor !
told the president that the recogni- '
tion of General Carranza had gone !
far toward establishing order. He j
predicted the speedy elimination of i

"Texas has been the Belgium of the

1 3 H. S.JJIRLS OUT
Pretty "Sorority Sisters" Sus
pended by Superintendent.
Charged With Violation of
State Fraternity Law.
Thirteen Topeka high Rchool girls
were suspended today by Superintend
ent H. B. Wilson for alleged violation
of the high school fraternity law.
They will be out until the next meet
ing of the school board, the next reg
ular session coming January 3.
The girls that were let out are Hel
en Lucas, Georgia Neese, Mary Sam
son, Esther Paxton, Katherine Dolan.
Rhea Robinson, Irene Seery, Helen
Whitted, Harriet Hill. Dorris Rosser.
Nan Weightman. Beatrice Shake
shaft and Jessie Bemett.
Approved by Hoard ljust Night.
The suspension of the girls was
considered and approved at the board
meeting last night, said Mr. Wilson.
"A feeling on the part of the board
that the high school was permitting
an organization or sorority, if you
wish of the kind barred under the
state law to exist caused the action."
The immediate action was brought
about by a dance at Helium hall Fri
day night by the alleged L. A. U. or
ganization. The girls were summoned
to the supoalntendent's ofnee and dis
missed pending aa Investigation.
Superintendent Wilsoh'asked the girls
for a statement regarding their at"
tions and Miss Jessie Burnett wrote
him the following:
"Several weeks previous to the uar-
ty given December 3 I came to see
yc-j, asking under what conditions the
party could be given which would be
thoroughly approved bv von and the
school authorities in general.
iou stated the only possible way
for a party to be given was to hnvi
the mothers of the respective girls
assume the responsibility. Under
those condit'ins you gave your con
sent, a snort time afterwards I came
to you asking your consent for a meet
ing of the girls. You consented to a
meeting at which the mothers were to
te present and I further stated that
several of the girls would be present.
The above meeting was held at my
house on Tuesday, according to Mr.
Stout, before Thanksgiving. The party
was given December 3. Yon renuested
that I see you the following Saturday
morning. I gave you a list of the
mothers' names and the girls for
whom the party was given.
(.signed) "JESSIE BURNETT."
Superintendent Wilson, the girls al
lege, demanded that the sentence "You
showed some hesitancy and doubt
about this" be substituted for "You
consented to a meeting at which the
mothers were to be present and I fur
ther stated that several of the girls
would be present."
Miss Burnett refused to insert this
sentence, she said, as it was a fabri
cation on her part.
The signing of the statement by
Miss Burnett, the leader of the al
leged L. A. L's would not have kept
the thirteen girls from beim; sus
pended, but would probably help to
get them back in high school sooner.
A card is signed by every high
school student in the fall agreeing to
taboo fraternities and sororities, says
Mr. Wilson.

County Clerk Refuses to Submit
Records to Inspection,
November 24 Was a Big Daj
for One Railroad.
One thousand, on hundred and
eighty-eipht consignments of liquor
were carried into Topeka, prohibition
capital of the world, in the fifteen
days between November IB and 30 by
two railroads and one express com
pany, according to reports made by
the carriers to Shawnee county offi
cials. In size tho shipments range
anywhere from two quarts of whis
ky to two and a half barrels of beer.
There are three express- companies
and four railroads which act as com
mon carriers between Kansas City and
Topeka.
The Santa Ve'n report for the fif
teen days wan 4 1 5 shipments. The
Rock Tsland reported 168 shipments.
The Wells-Fargo Express company re
ports to the county clerk 0& fahip
ments in a statement which consists
of forty-four pages.
Efforts to keep the reports of liquor
shipments from being made public are
being made by O. K. Swayse, Shawnee
county clerk. This morning when
asked by a reporter for permission
to glance over the statements Swayin
refused. In an opinion handed aown
last month, S. M. Brewster, attorney
general of Kansas, ruled that such
reports are a matter of public record
t and that the public has ar rlcrht to
mem. j ne reports or the railroads
were obtained from the county nttr
ney'a office- which is of the opinion
that the. public has th right to know
what is going on In public places.
A Wet Thanksgiving.
Topeka's thirst for consumption of
"joy-water" evidently took a spurt the
day before Thanksgiving, November
25, for on November 24 one railroad
alone unloaded 6 8 shipments of booze
at its Topeka station. This is about a
third more than usual. Another rail
road unloaded 36 consignments.
The average day's shipment of
liquor into Topeka by one railroad
alone is startling. On December 1 a
j transcontinental railroad unloaded the
thirsty Topekans: One box of whisky,
one-half barrel of beer, one box of
liquor, one case of beer, one-fourth
barrel of beer, one cask of beer, one
fourth barrel of beer, one case of
beer, one case of whisky, one cask of
beer, one box of liquor, one cask of
beer, three cases of beer, one-fourth
barrel of beer, one box of whisky, one
cane of beer, one box of whisky and
one cask of beer.
