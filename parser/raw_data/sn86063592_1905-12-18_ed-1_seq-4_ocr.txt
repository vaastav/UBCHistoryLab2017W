THE WEST.
Papers which come to our exchange
table from the north and south, from
1 ho taut and our own went rulterateJ
that thtt sentiment of the east la too
much BKalnat the weirt to permit of
Justice being done ui on any quentlon.
They point out that western men aru
left oft the Important committees, that
wcHtern' atatea cannot secure a fair
share of the appropriations, and refer
to many Instance of discrimination
agalnHt (he went. The east admits it
and many of the papers say frankly
that the policy of the east l oppose!
to that of the went and that It Is self
preservation that actuates the eastern
members. , t , . . ,
Hut western men have after' all
shown a great deal of aptitude in hold
ing their own. The east opposed the
reclamation service, yet the west se
cured that benlflcent legislation.
There are , always some men among
the eastern memebers who may be de
pended upon to do justice regardless
of sectional consideration. .AsvJhe
years go on'ft'wlli become 'easier for
western WelTWUfv their way. The
populatloajashiftiag rapidly, fHV ,
ward.' Tne center will' soon" be" west
of the Mississippi.. ' The far ;eatern
state b'aVe reached the limit of (heir
growth and are struggling desperate
ly to hold their own'. The great west
has already commenced Its develop
ment. , The vast trade with the Orient
It la It Infancy, the resources of the
states and territories of the west are
wholly embryonic. Where one acre
of land la cultivated today, by the
application of scientific methods of
the senate were almost ' balanced,
Warren showed that he dared not
rtand for hla convlcttloni against a
majority of bis party.
This man from a neighboring west
ern state admits that be believes Now
Mexico should be admitted as a sep
arate state, He knows there 'is a
close light on. Many of bis republi
can associates and all of the western
men with one or two exceptions will
have manhoo.1 and decency enough
to vote for the separate admission of
this territory. Warren will be brand
ed all over the west as a poltroon and
a weak loward, If he does violence to
his convictions and vote against jus-
Ltlce to this territory because an east-
em, faction of his party happens to
want him to,. . ', ' ,
We have always heard that Warren
was an honest and an able man, but
if he repeats his course of last year,
he will find few westerners who can be
made to believe It. "

gotten a fair "count when the" court of
appeals decided -against bin -flva to

-The."N"ew Mexican hope that tne

paying Iq the neighbor hood of. pijehalf
of our legitimate expenses of govern
tnent New Mexico and its people
have dealt yery kindly with Judge
Freeman, they have honored him Aha
shown their appreciation of his ability
and services In a number of ways. The
Judge' will hardly deny that his taxes
for 1905 are certainly not higher, In
dollar and cents that he would have
to pay had ho remained In hia native
state of Tennessee! nor that some of
the big cattle outfits in the lower Pe
cos Valley would have to whack up
much more handsomely In other com
monwealths than they do In New Mex
ico. He can scarcely have overlooked
the recent census bulletin which
showed that the railroad lines In Maw
Mexico are assessed less than ten per
cent on their -commercial walue al
though the assessed valuation In
other ; states, Including Tennessee,
ranges from 40 to 120 per cent and
(axes must be paid accordingly;, nor
will Judge Freeman deny that the
valuation of other property in this
Territory Is less than one-third on the
average of Its true value and that the'
per capita expenses of the Territory
of vNew Mexico are less than the 'per
capita exepnues or tne state or Pen
nsylvania, or the state of Colorado, or
the state of Tennessee. Wbjy should
the Judge therefore growl about taxes,
which certainly do not rent heavily

that the .unselfish spirit of Christmas
