Washington. The menage of Preal
dent Roosevelt was road la both
fiousea of conrresi Tuesday. In sub
stance the document was as follows:
To tha Senate and House of Represen
tallvea: Tha financial standing of tha
nation at tha present tlma la excellent,
and tha flnanrlal menssement of tha na
tlon'a Interests by tha government dur
ing tha laat seven years has shown tha
moat satisfactory resulta. Hut our cur
rency system la Imperfect, and It la ear
neetly to ba hopexl that tha currency
commission will be able to propose a
thoroughly food ayalem which will do
away with tha existing defecta.
During tha period frnm July 1, 101, to
Beptemben M, 190, thera waa an Increase
In tha amount of money In circulation of
0S,Ml,tW. The Increase In tha per capita
during thla period waa 17.08. Within this
tlma thera wara several occasions when
It waa naceaaary for . tha treasury do
partment to coma to tha relief of tha
money market by purchaaea or redemp
tlons of United States bonds; by Increaa
log depoalta In national banka; by stim
ulating additional Issues of national bank
notaa, and by facilitating Importations
from abroad of gold. Our Imperfect cur
rency system has made these proceedings
necessary, and they were effective until
the monetary disturbance In the full of
MOT Immensely Increased the dllllculty of
ordinary methods of relief. Ry the mid
dle of November the avnllnbls working
balance In the treasury had been reduced
to approximately ili.ouo.noO, Clearing
house associations throughout the coun
try had been obliged to resort to the
expedient of Issuing clearing house cer
tificates, to ba used as money. In this
emergency It waa determined to Invite
oubacrlptlona for tr-n.mm.oiio 1'anumo cunnl
bonds, and tlon,n),(XiO three per rent,
certificates of Indcbtednesa authorised by
- the act of June 13, ltf8. It wna proposed
to redeposlt In the nnlloiiHl bunks the
proceeds of these Isstiea, and to permit
their use aa a hnala for addltlnnnl circu
lating notea of national hanks. The
moral effect of thla procedure was so
groat that It waa nnresau'ry to iKsue only
124,831, 9K0 of the Panama bonds nnd I1R,
iM.&UO Of the certmuntes of Indc htedneaa.
During tha period from July J, l!sil, to
September SO. l!nt, the balunce between
the net ordinary receipts and the net
ordinary expenses of the government
ahowed a surplus In the four yenrs lima,
loj, iMM. ami 1W. and a deficit In the
years 1904, lWXt, luos and a fractional part
of the fiscal year HW. The net result
waa a surplus of !9,2K.1,413.M. The finan
cial operations of tha government during
thla period, bnsed upon these differences
between renelpts and expenditures, re-e-.ilted
In a net reduction of the Interest
bearing debt of the t'nltcd HtMes from
. t!W7,14l,040 to ISirj.Ha.lWO. notwithstanding
that there had been two aalea of Panama
renal bonda amounting In the aggregate
' to fr4,631,9XO, and an Issue of three per
cent, certificates of ludehtedneas umler
tha act of June 1.1, 1SIM, nmoiintlng to
16,4.M.bU0. Iterundlng operatlona of the
treasury department under the act of
March 14, won, resulted In the conver

mind that sxacHv ss the anarchist Is the
worst enemy of liberty and the reeii I lon
ary tha worst enemy of order, so tha
men who tWend the rights of property
have most to tear from the wrongdoeta
of great wealth. Slid Ilie men who are

Natd of Ctntralliatlon.
The propossl tn make tha na
tional government supreme over, and
therefore to give It complete control over,
the railroads and other Instruments of
Interstate commerce Is merely a propos
al tn carry out to ths letter one of tha
prime purposes, If not the prima purpose,
for which tha constitution waa founded.
It doea not represent centrnllsnllon. It
represents merely tha acknowledgment
of the patent fact that centralisation lm
already roms In business. If this Irre
sponsible outside business power la to be
controlled in (he Interest of the general
public It ran only be controlled in one
way; by giving adcipinle power of con
trol to the one sovereignty rnpshle of ex
ercising aurh power the nallonnl govern
ment. To abandon the effort for national
control means to abandon the effort for
all adequate control and yet to render like
ly continual hursts of action by slate leg.
Islaturea, which cannot achieve the pur
pose nought for, but which ran do a
great deal of damage to the corporation
without conferring any real benefit on
the public.
There ehonld be regulation by the na
tional government of the great Interstate
corporations, Including a simple mot hod
of account keeping, publicity, supervision
of the Issue of securities, abolition of
rebates and of special privileges, There
should ba short-time franchises for all
corporations engaged In public business;
Including the corporations which get
jHjeer from water rights. There should
' nstlnnal aa well as state guardianship
of mines and forests. The Inhor legisla
tion hereinafter referred to should con
currently be enacted Into law,
To accomplish this, means a certain In
crease In the use of not the creation of
power, by the central government. The
power already exists; It docs not have
to be created; the only question Is
whether It shall he used or left Idle
end meanwhile the corporations over
which tha power ought to be exercised
will not reuiuln Idle. The danger to Amer
ican democracy lies not In the leaat In the
concentration of administrative pnwef In
responsible and accountable hands. It
Ilea In having the power Insufficiently
concentrated, so that no one can he held
responslhln to the people for Its tiso.
Concentrated power Is palpable, visible,
responsible, easily reached, quickly held
to account, Democracy Is
wherever the admlnlstrutlon
III lent power Is scattered among
a variety of men who work In
secret, whose very names are un
known to the common people. It Is not
In peril from any man who dcrlvea au
thority from the people, who exerrlaea

I also renew my recommendation that
tha prim iple of the tight-hour day
should as rapidly and a fsr sa precl
ralile be extended to the entire wnrkl every way. Moron. ir, I bellevo that the
being carried on by the government!
the present law should be amended to
embrace contracts on those puhile
works whlrh the present wording of
the act seems to exclude.
Would Double Salarlet ef Judges.
I moet earnestly urge upon the eon
gresa the dtitv of Increasing the totally
Inadequate salaries now given to our
Judge On the whole there la no body
of public servants who do a valuable
work, nor whoee moneyed reward la ao
Inadequate compared to their work. I'e.
ginning with the supreme court tha
Judges should have their Salaries dou
bled. It l not befitting the dignity of
the nation that Its moet honored public
servants should be paid sums so small
compared to what they would earn In
private life thnt the performance of
public service by them Implies an eg
reedlngly heavy pecuniary sacrifice.
It la earnestly to be desired that soma
method should ba devised for doing
away with the long delays which now
obtain In the administration of Justice,
and which operate with peculiar sever
Ity against persons of small mesne, and
favor only the very criminals whom II
la moat desirable to punish. These
long delays In the flnul decisions of
rssea mske In the aggregste a crying
evil; and a remedy ehouii be devised.
Much of this Intolerable delsy la due
to Improper regard paid tn technicali
ties whlrh are a mere hlnderance to
Juatloe. In some noted recent esses thla
over-regard for technicalities has re
sulted In a striking denial of Justice,
and flagrant wrong tn the body politic
Labor Laadara Criticised.
At tha lost election certain leadera of
organised labor made a violent and
sweeping attack upon the entire Judi
ciary of the ciiiilitry, an attack couched
In such terms aa to Include the moat
upright, hottest and hroiid-mlndcd
Judges, no less than those of narrower
mind ami more restricted outlook.
Last year, before tha house com
mittee on Judiciary, these same
labor leaders formulated their de
mands, specifying the hill that
contained tiictn, refusing all compro.
mlse, stating they wished the principle
of that bill or nothing. They Insisted
on a provision thnt In a labor dispute
no Injunction should Issue except to
protect a property right, and specifical
ly provided that the right to carry on
hiiNlness should not be construed us a
property right; and In a second provis
ion their bill made legal In a labor dis

reasons theri for. so that the congress
ran If It rtesltes ex mine and Investigate
the same,
Tor many of the shortcomings of
Justice In our country our people as a
whole are themselves to blame, and the
Judges and Juries merely bear their
share together with the public as a
whole. It Is discreditable to us as a
people thnt there should be difficulty In
convicting murderers, or In bringing to
Justice men who aa puhllo servants
have been guilty of corruption, or who
have profited by tha corruption of
public servants, The result Is equally
unfortunate, whether due to hslrspilt
ting technicalities In ths Interpretation
of law by Judges, to sentimentality and
class Consciousness on tha pert of
Jurlea, or to hysteria and eeneatlnnnl
Ism In the dally press. For much of
thla failure of Justice no responsibility
whatever Ilea on rich men as such, We
who make tip the mass of the people
cannot shift tha responsibility from our
own shoubb rs. Hut there la an Impor
tant part of tha failure which has spe
cially to do with Inability to hold
to proper account men of wealth who
behave badly.
The Modern Corporation,
The huge wealth that has been accu
mulated by a few Individuals of recent
yesrs, In what has amounted tn a eo
clsl and Industrial revolution, has been
aa regards some of these Individuals
made possible only by the Improper use
of the modern corporation. A certain
type of modern corporation, with Ita
officers and agents, Its many Issues of
securities, end Its constant consolida
tion with allied undertakings, Anally
becomes an Inatrument ao complex ae
to contain e greater number of ale
memo that under varloue Judicial da
clslons, lend themselves to fraud and
oppression than any device yet evolved
In the human brain. Corporations ere
necessary Instruments of modern bust
nrss, They have been permitted to
become a menace largely because the
governmental representatives of the
people have worked slowly In provld
Ing for adequate control over them
Our great clusters of corpora
tlons, hugs trusts and fabulously
wealthy multimillionaires, employ tha
very beat lawyers they can obtain to
pick flaws In statutes after their
passage; but they also employ a class
of secret agents who seek, under the
advice of experts, to render hostile
legislation Innocuous by making It un
constitutional, often through the Inecr
tlon of what appear on their face to be
legalised PiucKllsting and boycotting "--
In every form, legalising, for Instance, , drastlo and sweeping provisions sgnlnst
those forma of the secondary boycott
which the anthrnclts coal strike com
mission so unreservedly condemned:

account of Ita exercise, to the peopto.
Legislation for Wageworker,
There ore many tnattera affecting Inhor
and the status of the wageworker to
wlilch I should like to draw your atten
tion, but an exhaustive dlscueslon of the
problem In all Its nspects Is not now nec
essary. I bellevo In a steady ef
fort, or perhaps It would bo more
accurate N to say In steady efforts
In many different direction-., to bring
about a condition of affairs under which
the men who work with hand or with
brain, the laborers, the superintendents,
the men who produce the market nnd the
men who find a market for the articles
produced, Kim 1 1 own a fur greater share
than at preaent of the wealth they pro
duce, and be enabled to Invest It In the
tools and Instruments by which all work
Is carried on, As far as pimrtlhlc I hope
to sno n frank recognition of the advan
tages conferred by machinery, organisa
tion and division of labor, accompanied
by an effort to bring about a larger share
In the ownership by wage-worker of rail
way, mill and factory.

plus of nearly one hundred millions of j bor. c.mlnutlon of women labor, short-
receipts over expenditures, a reduction
of the IntereHt-boarlng debt by ninety
millions, In spite of the extraordinary ex
pense of the 1'anama canal, and a saving
of nearly nine millions on the annual
Interest charge.
Control of Corporatlona.
Aa regarda the great corporations en
gaged In Interstate business, nnd rspn
dally the railroads, I can only repeat
what I have already again and again suld
In my measagea to the congress. I be
lieve that under the Interstate clause of
tha constitution the I'nlted Klatcs has
complete and paramount right to con
trol all agencies of Interstate commerce,
nd I believe thut the national govern
ment alone ran exercise this right with
wisdom and effectiveness so us both to
secure Justice from, and to do justice to,
the great corporations which are the
moat Important factors In modern busi
ness. I believe thnt It Is worse than
folly to attempt to prohibit all com
binations as Is done by the Sherman
anti-trust law, because such a law ran
be enforced only Imperfectly and un
equally, and Its enforcement works al
most ss much hardship as good. I
strongly advocate that Instead of an un
wise effort to prohibit all combinations,
there shall be substituted a law which
ehall expressly permit combinations
which are In the Interest of the public,
but shall at the same time give to some
agency In the national government full
power of control and supervision over
them. One of the chief features of thla
control should be securing entire pub
licity In all matters which the public
has a right to know, and furthermore,
the power, not by Judicial but by execu
tive action, to prevent or put a stop to
every form of Improper favoritism or
other wrongdoing.
The railways of the country should be
put completely under the Interstate com
merce commission and removed from
the domain of the rtnll-trunt law. The
vwe,r of the commlnsioD should ix.
tnorougrrgoing, so trial u coum exercisti
rotnidete eupervlalon and control over
the liisue of1 securities it well ax over
the ruining and lowering of rule. As
regards rates, at least, thla pouir should
be summary, v . . Rates mi i ; U- nmuo
aa low aa la compatible with giving prop
er returns to all tha employes of the rail
road, from the highest to the lowest,
and proper returner to the shareholders,
but they must not. for Instance, be re
duced In such fashion ss to necessitate
e, cut In tha wages of the employes or
the abolition of tha proper and legitimate
profits of honest shareholders.
Telegraph and telephone companies en
gaged In Interstate business should be
put undeT the Jurisdiction of the Inter
state commerce commission.
It Is very earnestly to be wished that
our people, through their reprenentatlvee,
should act In 'this matter. It Is to
the Interest of all of us that
there should be a premium put upon In
dividual Initiative and Individual ea
rning of hours of all mechanical Inhor;
stock watering should bn prohibited.
and stock gambling so fur as Is posal
ble.dlscourugod. There should be
progressive Inheritance tax on large
fortunes, industrial education should
be encouraged, As far aa poxHlbla we
should lighten the burden of taxation
on the small man. We should put a
premium upon thrift, hard work, and
biiHlnrsa energy; hut these qualities
cense to be the main factors In accu
mulating; a fortune long before thnt
fortune reaches a point where Jt would
be seriously affected by any Inheri
tance tax such as I propose. It Is emi
nently right that the nation should fix
the terms upon which the great for
tunes are Inherited. They rarely do
good and they often do harm to those
who Inherit them In their entirety.
There should no longer be any palter
ing with the question of taking care of
. the wageworkrrs who, under our prea
. ent Industrial system, become killed,
' crippled, or worn out as part of the
regular Incidents of a given busi
ness. As far as concerns those
who have been worn out, I call your
attention to the fuel that definite
steps toward providing old-age pen
sions have been tsken In many of our
private Industries. These may be In
dennltely extended through voluntary
association and contributory schemes,
or through the agency of savings
bsnks, as under the Massachusetts
plan.
Urgent Need of Reform.
Our present system, or rather no sva.
tern, works dreadful wrong, and Is of
benefit to only one class of people the
lawyers. When a workman Is Injured
what he needs Is not an expensive and
doubtful luwsult. but the certainty of
relief through Immediate administra
tive action. No academic theory
about "freedom of contract" or "consti
tutional liberty to contract" should be
permitted to Interfere with this and
similar movements.
Tending a thoroughgoing Investiga
tion and action there Is csrtaln legis
lation which should he enartud at once
The law, parsed at the last session of
the congress .grunting compensation to
certain classes of employes of the gov
ernment .shuuld bs extended to Include
all employes of thu government and
should be msde more liberal in lie
terms. There Is no good ground for
the distinction mailt In the law be
tween those engaged In hasurdous oc
cupations and thusi: not so en
gsged. The trrms of the act pro
viding compensation should be made
more liberal than In the present
act. A year's compensation Is not ade
quate for a wage-earner'a family In the
event of his death by accident In the
course of his employment. And In the
event of drath occurring, say, ten or
eleven mAmhs nfle the accident, the
family would only 'ecclve ns compen
tutlon the t-ijttivuli nt of one or two
wna explicitly taken out from under
that protection which the law throws
over property. The demand wae made
that there should be trial by Jury In
contempt cases, thereby most seriously
Impairing the authority of the courts.
All this represented n course of policy
which, If carried out, would mean the
enthronement of class privilege In Ita
crudest and most brutal form, and the
destruction of one of the moat essen
tial functions of the Judllcafy In all civ
ilised lands.
The violence of the crusade for thla
legislation, and Its complete failure,
lllustrstn two truths which It Is essen
tial our people should learn. In the
llrst place, they ought to teach the
worklngman, the laborer, the wage
worker, that by demanding what Is Im
proper and Impossible, ho pluys Into the
hands of his foes. Such a crude and
vicious attack upon the courts, even If
It were temporarily successful, would
Inevitably In the end cause n violent
reliction and would band the great
mass of rltlxena together, forcing them
to stand by all the Judges, competent
and Incompetent alike, rather than to
see the wheels of Justice stopped.
Thn wageworkrrs, the worklngmrn,
the laboring men of the country by the
way In which they repudiated the ef
fort tn get them to cast their votes In
response to nn appeal to rinse hatred,
have emphasised their sound patriotism
and Americanism. Hue!) an attitude
Is an object lesson In good cltlxnishlp to
the entire nation.
Judicial 8yetem Sound.
Our Judicial system Is sound and
effective nt core, ' and It remains,
nnd must ever he maintained, as
the safeguard of those principles of lib
erty snd Justice which stand at the
foundation of American Institutions; for,
ns Iluike finely said, when liberty and
Justice are separated, neither Is safe,
There are, however, some members of
the Judicial body who have lugged be
hind In their understanding of these
great and vital changes In the body
politic, whose minds have never been
opened to the new applications of the old
principles made necessary by the new
conditions. Judges of this stamp do last- .
Ing harm by their decisions, because they '
convince poor men in need of protection
that the courts of the land are pro
foundly Ignorant of and out of sympathy
with their needs, and profoundly Ignorant
or hostile to any proposed remedy. To
such men It seems a cruel mockery to '
have uny court deride against them on
the ground that It desires tn preserve
"liberty" In a purely technical form, by
withholding liberty In any real and con
structive sense. J
There are certain decisions by various
courts which have been exceedingly det
rimental to the rights of wage-workers.
This Is true of all decisions that decide
that men are, by the constitution, "guar
anteed their liberty" to contract to enter
a dangerous occupation, or to work an
undesirable or Improper number of hours,
or to work In unhealthy surroundings;
and therefore cannot recover damagea
when maimed In that occupation, and 1
cannot be forbidden to work what the
legislature decides Is an excessive num
ber of hours, or to csrry on ths work
under conditions which ths legislature
decides to be unhealthy. Decisions
such as those nullify tha legislative
effort to protect the wage-workera who
most need protection from thnae employ
ers who lake advsntsge of their grind
ing need. They halt or hamper the move
ment for securing better and more equi
table conditions of labor.
There Is also, I think, ground for the
belief that substantial Injustice Is often
suffered by employes In consequence of
the custom of courts Issuing temporary
Injunctions without notice to them, and
punishing them for contempt of court In
Instances whore, as a mstter of fact.
they have no knowledge of any proceed
Ings. Organised labor la
under the unjust restraint which
cornea from repeated resort to thla
plan of procedure, Its discontent
has been unwisely expressed, and
often Improperly expressed, but there
ts a aound basis for It, and the or
derly and law-abiding people of a com
munity would be In a far stronger posi
tion for upholding the courts It the un
doubtedly existing abuses could be pro
vided against.
Injunction Mutt Remain.
The power of Injunction Is a great
equitable remedy, which should on no
aocouut be destroyed. But safeguard
the Interests of the parties Inspiring
them; while the demagogues, the cor
rupt creatures who Introduce black
mailing achemqs to "strike" corpora
tions, and all who demand extreme
and undesirably radical, measures,
show themselves to be the worst ens
mles of the Very publln whose loud
mouthed champions they profess to he
Ileal damage haa been done by the
manifold and conflicting interpretations
01 the Interstate commerce law. Con
trol over the great corporations doing
Interstate business rsn be effective only
If It Is vested with full power In an
administrative department, a branch of
the federal executive, carrying nut
federal law) It ran never becffectlve If
a divided responsibility Is left In both
the states and ths nation; It can never
be effective If left In the hands of the
courts to he derided by lawsuits.
Respect for Law Must Be Upheld
The courts hold a place of peculiar and
deserved sanctity umler our form of gov
ernment, ltespect for the law Is essen
tial to the permanence of our Instllu
tlons; and respect for the Isw Is hugely
conditioned upon respect for the courts,
It Is an offense against the republic to
say anything which can weaken tills re
spect, save for the gravest reason and In
the most carefully guarded manner. In no
oilier nation In the world do the courts
wield such vast ami far-reaching power
as In the I'nlted Htales. All that is nec
essary Is that the courts us a whole
Should exen lae this power with the far
sighted wisdom already shown hy those
Judges who scan the future while they
act In thu present. I.rt them exercise
thla great power not only honestly mid
bravely, but with wise Insight Into the
needs and fixed purposes of the people
so that they may do justice, and work
equity, so that they may protect all per
sons In their rights, ami yet break down
the barriers of privilege, which Is the foe
or right,
I Forest Preservation,
If there Is any ona duty which more
than another we owe It to our children
tn perform at once, It Is to save tha for
ests of tills country, for they constitute
the nrst and most Important element In
the conservation of the natural re
sources of thn' country. . , , Just as
a farmer, after all his life making his
living from his farm, will, If he Is an ex
pert farmer, leave It ae an asset of In
creased value to his son, so we should
leave our national domain to our chil
dren, Increased In vulue and not worn
out. There are small sections of our own
country. In the east ami In the west, In
the Adlrondacks, the White mountains
and the Appalachians, and In the Itocky
mountains, where we can already see for
ourselves the damage In the shape of
permanent Injury to the soil and the
river systems which comes from reckless
deforestation. It matters not whether
this deforestation la due to the actual
reckless cutting of timber, to tha fires
that Inevitably follow such reckless cut
ting of timber, or to reckless and uncon
trolled erasing, especially by the great
migratory bands of aheap, the un
checked wandering oT which over tha
country meane destruction to forests and
disaster to the smsll home-makers, the
settlers of limited means
Thanke to our own recklessness
In the use of our splendid forests,
we have already crossed the verge of a
timber famine In this country, and no
measurea that we now take can, at least
for msny years, undo the mischief that
haa already been done. Hut we ran pre
vent further mischief being done; and It
would be In the highest degree reprehen
sible to let any consideration of tem
porary convenience or temporary cost
intsrfere with aurh action, especially as
regards the notional forests which the
nation can now, at this very moment,
control.
The lesson of deforestation In China
la a lesson which mankind should have
learned many times already from whet
has occurred In other places, Denuda
tion Isaves nsked soli; then gullying;

Needs of tht Secret Service.
Last year an amendment W's Incor
porated In the measure providing for the
secret service, which provided that there
should be no detail from the secret serv
ice and no tranafer therefrom. The
amendment In question waa of benefit ta
no one excepting to erlmlnsls, and
It seriously hampers the government In
the detection of crime and the sec dug
of Justice, The chief ergomrt.' In
favor of the provision wss 'hat
Ihe congressmen (lid not tiiem-
ualvea wish to be Investigated I v
secret service men. Very little pi nun
Investigation haa been done In the pint;
but It la true that the work of the secret
eervlce agents waa partly responsible for
tha Indictment and conviction of a aen
ator and a congressman for land frauds
In Oregon. I do not believe that It le

In any branch of the public, eervlce, end

convicted such criminals who were In
the exscutlve branch of the government,
eo In my belief we should be given smple
means to prosecute them It found In

considered desirable a special exception
could be made In the law prohibiting the
use of the aeeret eervlce force In Invee

Tha Army.
As regards the army I call alt
to t'i" fact that while our Junior
cere and enlisted men stand very
the preeent eystem of promotion'
seniority results In bringing Into
higher grades many men of med
rapacity who have but a ehort tin

Is to encourage thrift and economy In
the wage-earner and person of mod
erate means. It le believed that In the
aggregate vast sums of money would be
brought Into circulation through ths In
strumentality of the postal eavlnge
banka.
Parcel Poet."
In my laat annual message I com
mended the postmaster-generals
recommendstlon for an extension of the
parrel post on ths rural routes. The
establishment of a local parcel post on
rural routes would be to the mutual
benefit of the farmer and the country
atorekeeper, and It la desirable (hat the
routes, aervlng more than 15,000 000
people, should be utilised to the fullest
practicable extent.
Education,
With the limited means hitherto pro
vided, the bureau of e ducatlon has
rendered efficient eervlce, but the con
grees haa neglected tn adequately sup
ply the bureau with means to meet the
educational growth of Hie country.
I earneatly recommend that this un
fortunate statu of affairs as regards
Ihe national educational office bs reme
died by adequate appropriations. Thla
recommendation la urged by the repre
sentatives of our common schools and
great state universities ami the leading
educators, who all unite In requesting
favorable consideration end action by
the congress upon this subject.
Thn prfsldont points out thn niTa
ally of hotter orgnnlxnttun of tno vnrl
miH bureaus responsible for the puhllo
henllli, nnd limes thn plnclng of all
soldiers' hnnies under Iho Jurisdiction
of the war department.
Statehood.
On the question of statehood the
president snya:
I iiilvix'iile the Immediate admission of
New Mexico nnd Annum as states. This
should Ih done nt Ihe present session of
the iiingress. The people, of the two ter
ritories hnve made It evident by their
voles that lliey will not come In as nns
slate. The only alternative Is tn admit
them us two, and I trust that this will be
done without debtv.
Interstate Fisheries.
I call the attention of the congress to
the Importance of the problem of (he
llnherlea In the Interstate waters. On the
(treat lkes we are now, under Ihe very
wise treaty of April II of tide year, en
deavoring la come to en International
agreement for the preservation and sat
isfactory use of Ihe fisheries of these wa
ters whlrh can not otherwise be achieved.
Lake Krle, for example, has the richest
fresh water fisheries In tha world; but It
Is now controlled by Ihe statutes of two
nations, four states, and ona province.
ami this province by two different ordi
nances In different counties. All these
political divisions work at cross pur
poses, und In no rase can they achieve
protection to Ihe fisheries, on the one
hand, and Justice tn the localities and In-
dlvldusla on the other.
Foreign Affaire.
This nation's foreign policy Is baaed
on the theory that right must bs done
between nations precisely ss between
Individuate, end In our actlona for the
last ten years we have In thla matter
proven our faith by our deeds. We
have behaved, and are behaving, to
warda other natlona, ee In private life
en honorable man would behave to
wards hla fellowe.
Latin-American Republics. 1
The commercial and material prog
ress of the 10 Itln-Amerlcsn republloa
la worthy of tha careful attention of
the congress. The International nureau
ef the American Republlca le doing a
ueeful work In making theee natione
and their resources better known to
us. and In acquainting them not only
wnn us ee a people ana witn our pur
poses towerda them, but with what we
nave to exchange for their goods.
Panama Canal.
Tha work on the 1'anama canal la be
ing done with a apeed, efficiency and
entire devotion to duty, whlrh make It
a model for all work of the kind. The
men on the lathmua. from Col. Uoethala
and hla fellow commissioners through
tha entire list of employes who are
faithfully doing their duty, have won
their right to the ungrudging respect
and gratitude of the American people.
Ocean Mall Llnea.
I egaln recommend thn extension of
the ocean mall act of 1191 eo that satis
factory American ocean mall linns te
South Amsrloa, Asia, the I'lullpplnea.
and Australasia may be established.
Hawaii.
I call particular attention to ths Ter
ritory of Iltwall. Ths Importance of
those Islsnds Is apparent, and the need
or improving their condition and -developing
their resources Is urgent.
