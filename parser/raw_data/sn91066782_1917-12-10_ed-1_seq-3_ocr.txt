Washington, D. C, Dec. 10, To a
young olllcer commanding the first flo
tilla of American destroyers to reach the
war zone when the United States entered
the world war, Secretary Duniels turns
in his annual report, made public to-day,
to find the war slogan of the naval serv
ice. Asked by the British admiral to
whom he reported when his ships fwould
be ready fyr work against the subma
rines alter the long voyage, the officer ;
replied:
" e are ready now."
"That was not the language of boast
ing," Mr. Daniels says iu describing the
incident. "It was the prophecy and
pledge of our service with those fighting
in a common cause.
"During peaceful years the navy has
been quietly but steadily perfecting it
self to meet the time of war. Now the
hour for which it has been preparing
has arrived. Our sword is drawn, and

the particulars revealing how Morse ob
tained the presidential pardon.
"Many of the details of these mat
ters," it is stated, "were the subject of
correspondence which the planum left
in defendant's possession and according
ly plaintiff can furnish said details only
by reference thereto."
The particulars not being considered
can this be done, but it can be done to
the satisfaction of all concerned and in
harmony with every patriotic purpose.

sacrifice for the common good a sacri

he savs, and legislated for the navy
with vision and wisdom.
This was done, too," he adds, "in the
broadest spirit of national patriotism by
members of all political parties."
Striking figures contained in the re
port showing the war expansion of the
navy include the following:
Since Jan. 1, 1917, the naval force has
increased from 4,500 officers and 08,000
fathers."

country in a position to furnish as many
and as powerful ships as will come from
any other country. It would be a last
ing calamity if, when this war ends,
there should linger as a burden upon a
people already heavily taxed by war a
competitive program of costly naval con
struction. This country will, no doubt,
take its proper place in bringing about
such provisions in the peace treaties as
wil never again constrain any nation to
adapt its naval program to the program
of some other nation from which there
is the compelling menace of possible and
unprovoked attack. Such compulsion is
the very negative of natural and orderly
naval development. It means the tyran
ny of a program dictated by apprehen
sion rather than the free choice of a"
standard suggested bv national needs
and supported by national ideals. An
international navy, on the contrary, will
make possible such naval development
as each nation deems tilting for its own
people. It will also serve "the parlia
ment of man" by providing a naval force
ample enough to give validity to inter
national decrees and strong enough to
keep inviolate the pcaee of the world."

Another suit against Morse for com
pensation for alleged service was brought
in the supreme court in 1914 by Max
C. Baum, a New York real estate deal
er. He asked for $100,000 and claimed
that it was largely, through his efforts
that President Taft was induced to par
don Morse. Baum declared that he was
retained by Morse both at conferences
and by letter, and was promised he
would be made wealthy "beyond his
wildest dreams" if he succeeded in bring

LABOR CONSCRIP
TION NOT NECESSARY
TO WIN THE WAR
But Sec. Wilson Suggests That Should
It Become Necessary the Industries
Should Be Conscripted
Also.
' Washington, Dec. 10. Conscription of
labor, Secretary Wilson told Congress in
bis annual report to-day, is not likely to
oe necessary ior tne winning ot the war,
but he suggests that should it become
necessary for the government to con
script labor, it should at the same time
conscript the industries on which they
are engaged.
"Almost insuperable obstacles arise,"
isnys the secretary of labor, "when labor
disputes occur under circumstances in
which the employers permit organization
by their workmen only on pain of dis
missal. ' Since in such cases the work
men have no responsible business repre
sentatives, only one party to controver
sies can be conveniently or satisfactorily
beard. In such cases, also, the workers,
being prevented by their employers from
organizing on a business basis, tend to
fall away from the pacifying influence of
conservative, constructive and respon-l
sihle labor organizations and to come un
der that of irresponsible revolutions. As
most labor lawlessness is traceable to
this cause, responsibility for it cannot be
wholly diverted from the policy hardly
patriotic in time of war of arbitrarily
obstructing labor organization of the
conservative type.
"The department is of course aware of
proposals, more popular earlier in the
war than now, to Fettle lalor disputes
by coercing wage earners. But these
proposals are both unfair and imprac
ticable. There are also widely regarded,
and not without reason, as unpatriotic.
It is enough to say of them here that in
the view of this department public sen
timent cannot be expected to tolerate
conscription of labor-for private profit,
fchould industrial conscription become
really necesary in order effectively to
prosecute the war. a policy less likely
to be considered one sided would lie de
sirable.
from ahv source only $10 a month and
the seamen $5 a month, receipts in ex
cess of these amounts being placed in
the postal savings bank to the credit o
the interested parties, or otherwise din
posed of as desired. Purchases of cloth
ing, etc., can be made with the funds of
the interned aliens, under the direction
of the inspector in charge of the intern
ment station.
The department's work in mediating in
wage disputes, enormously increased by
war activities, have affected practically
a million men and have been eminently
successful
"The number of labor disputes eallin
for government mediation increased sud
denly and enormously with the begin
ning of the war, savs the report;
"In a large number of instances th
conciliators have been able not only
bring about agreements in cases of exist
ing differences often arising from mis
understandings but to avert the threat
ened strike altogether.
The success which has attended th
department's representatives in the grea
majority of disputes has been mos
gratifying.' In many instances through
the efforts of the department strikes
which would have involved thousands of
workers engaged in great operat ions were
quietly averted and industrial" peace
maintained. All this was accomplished
without publicity and the consequent ex
citement which invariably attends in
diistrial disturbances when heralded in
the press. Great plants thus secured un
interrupted production for stated periods
some of the agreements running for a
year and others for the period of the
war.
"Labor has discovered that it has
standing iu the government machinery of
its country whenever it.s demands are
based on its industrial ano constitution
al rights. Kmplovers, on the other hand,
have found in the department a defender
against unreasonable exaction.
"Reports now at hand indicate an im
pending call for not less than 150,000
skilled workers of many classes, involv
ing over 30 mechanical trades, to serve
in the various shipyards engaged in
constructing vessels for the shipping

officers and 30,000 men. In addition to
this and to the vast orders for material
placed, the expansion of the air service
and to many wholly new activities de
veloping from war conditions, training
facilities have been provided for 113,050
men exclusive of the naval academy and
other regular service schools.
For the first time, the secretary does
not make public the report of the gen
eral board of the navy, llis synopsis
of the board's work shows that it has
been of a most confidential character
and the report is withheld for that rea
son, Mr. Daniels says. This report is the
usual source of the future building pro
aram of the navv. The secretary con
tents himself this vear, however, with
recommending that the remainder of the
three-year program already approved be
authorized, including throe battleships,
one battle cruiser, three scout cruisers
nine fleet submarines and a number of
auxiliary craft.
The secretary asks that the permanent
enlisted personnel be increased to 120,000
blue jackets, 10,000 apprentice seamen,
7,000 men in the trade schools and 4,000
for the air service. For war purposes he
asks that the figures be 180,000 blue
jackets, 24.000 apprentices, 14.000 in
trade schools and ltl.lHHl in aviation.
Mr. Daniels again emphasizes his feel
ing that promotion should be made on
the basis of merit throughout the navy
and that the "fetish" of seniority be
abandoned, "from admiral io ensign."
He recommends that the selective system
now be extended to the staff as well as
the line. He also expresses the convic
tion that every candidate for admission
to the Kaval academy should be com
pelled to serve a year before the mast as
an enlisted man before entering the
school.
The report declares that the inter
changes between the naval services of
the allied powers and the navy have
been "particularly frank and free," add
ing that this partnership of democratic
nations will vet "insure a lasting peace.
It savs that when the call came, the navy
supplied gunners and guns for merchant
craft without an hour's delay.
The report touches on the various na
val conferences attended by American
officers but adds nothing to what is'
known of the questions taken up or de
cisions reached. Throughout the lengthy
document the secretary is careful , to
avoid any statement that might lie of
service to an enemy.
The secretin pavs tribute to the ma
rine corps, which has lived up to its best
raditions, he savs, as will be shown
when the war is over. The marine regi
ment in France, he savs, will soon lie con-
iderablv augmented in its service with
Jeneral Pershing's army.

WILSON REFUSES PARDON.
A plan for enabling every American
mother to have the care she needs when
her baby is born is proposed by Miss
Julia C. Lathrop, chief of the children's
bureau of the V. S. department of labor,
in her fifth annual report, made public
to-day. Through federal grants like
those made for agricultural extension in
this country, Mia Lathrop suggests that
the state, and federal governments could
combine in the United States to make
accessible and available to every mother
her lowest infant mortality rate. The
government of New Zealand, whose in
fant mortality rate is scarcely half that
of the United States, has for several
years afforded to New Zealand mothers
care at childbirth. .
If the lives and well-being of mothers
and babies in the United States are to be
protected. Miss Lathrop believes that
public health nurses must be maintained
to show the mother miles out in the
country and the mother in the crowded
tenement how to care for herself and her
children. Schools and universities should
