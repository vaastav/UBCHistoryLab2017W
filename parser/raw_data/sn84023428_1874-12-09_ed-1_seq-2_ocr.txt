Congress n.ct oh Monday. The I'reS'
iJont'g mcs&igo in liiglil y complimented by
all parties. The following are hints of what
It contain.', were published on Monday.
And associated press despatch says
The president's message was not quite com
pleted. owing to a delay in receiving the
report of the. Districts of Columbia com
misaioiiers, a reference to which will be
added to the message, Monday morning
Although the rrestnent has shown the
Mcfsagc to no pen-on other than those of
the cabinet and the copyists, there is the
best reasoll for believing it will contain
substantially the following points, foundud
on an expression of the President to inti.
mate friends since th messago was Mib
mitted to and cordially indorsed by the
cabinet ou Friday last : The President
says that, although be did not commence
tb? preruratinn of his message until week
ago Friday, some of the newspapers pre
viously prognosticated its contents, al
though he had consulted nobody ns to
what it would contain. There is no doubt
the nicssngd will state that our relations
with all foreign powers are friendly and
without distuibiiree, though there is an
unsettled question with Vcneztiula, which
has not paid the awards of the joint com
mission under the convention of 18GG.
Congress, it will be recollected, strongly
expressed its sense on this subject in Feb
ruary, 1873. The President, in his mes
sage of last December, said there was
reason to believe the hesitancy of that
republic in recognizing the claims sprung
in part, at least, from r.-ul difficulty in
discharaiii" them in connection with its
obligations to otlior governments, and
therefore the expediency of further for
beuratiec on tho part of our government
was believed to bo worthy of the consid
eration of Congress. In additiuti to Vcn
zuelii we have unsettled questions with
Spain, growing out of the affair of the
of tho Virginiui and other grievous trans
actions on the part of the Spanish author
ities in connection with events in Cuba.
The magnitude of the offenses has not
been reduced since the President's previ
ous message, a year ago. A this unset
tled condition of affairs in Cuba cannot
long continue, it may becomo necessary
for other nations, with our own, to inter
fere to terminate the insurection which
has so long prevailed, the Spanish govern
ment having unsuccessfully attempted to
suppress it. In tho moan time the com
ineice of nil countries, and especially that
of tho United States, suffers, the flags of
the United Slates and Englaud having
l een insulted. Tho president says in this
conversation, although he does not state
the fact in his message, that the United
States purehaso about 80 per cent, of the
Cuban exports, and therefore tho duties
paid by American citizens contribute to
this extent in helping Spain to conti.iuo
the war against tho Insurgents, The
President had hoped thai by the meeting
of Congress, Monday, the pietent negoti
ations with Spain would havo ended, but
in this ho has been disappointed. He
therefore says in his inessago littlo or
nothing ubout the iudemnity, pending the
negotiations, but at u future time will
present the subject to the special consid
etation of Cougress.
The positional' tho President on the
financial question is positive. He desires
aud will recommend the resumption of
specie payments at tho earliest practical
day, but does not believe this pan be
reached as soon ns the first of January,
187G. He does not name any day, leav
ing Congress to devise means to seeure
this desired end, it being the duty of Con
gross to do so. Tho legul-tonder clause
of the currency act should be repealed, to
lake effect as to contracts madj after tho
day to be 6xed by law for its repeal.
Power should be given to secretary of the
treasury to obtain gold from and after the
date fixed by the resumption of specie
payments by the issuanco of bonds. In
addition to this, tho rewuuesof the gov
ernment should bo in excess of the ex
penditures to support resumption ; greater
economy should be practiced in alljdepart
nienlB of the government, aud If necessary
the customs and internal revenue laws bi
changed, in order !o secure a larger
amount of revenue. With the return of
specio payments, banking should bo free.
Vill-holdorj should continue to bo protect
ed as at present under tho banking law,
and thero shoulJ bo no limitation to the
volume of the curroncy, as the communi
ty itseif should determine what amount is
icquired for business transactions, instead
of leaving tho executive, secretary of the
treasury and Congress to fix the limit. It
would bo the duty of Congress, however,
to make regulations regarding free banks
of issue, and to state the conditions on
which they can be organized and transact
business, tho legislation to be iu accord
ancc with the new order of things, or, iu
other words, tho resumption of specie
payments. There should be no monopoly
by fixing the amount of issue. Tho Pres
ident will recommend that Congress do
not interfere with tho present currency
act, passed dnring the lust session, unless
to nmend it so as to conform with a plan
.of the resumption of specie payment.
Tte I'rcaidcot will nuke no reoommen -
datioo on the subject of internal improve
nicula by 'he general government, but
will merely refer to the fact that Congress
has a It end v appointed committee on
transportation routes to the seaboard,
which has already mado its report, and
will give further information from wore
recent investigations,
Considerable space is devoted t affairs
in Arkansas, the reasons given why he
declined to interfere in the recent difficul
ties in (bat state, and ho adverts to the
facts narrated in his special Bieaaugo to
Cungress, in February, 1873, relative to
Louisiana, in which he said he had no
specific recommendation to mako on the
subject, but, if there were any practical
way of removing those difficulties by leg'
Dilation, then be earnestly requested that
the question might be taken at that ses-
of Congress. Ho was extreme! anxious
to avoid any pretense of undue interfer
ence iu state affairs, and, if Congress dif
fered with him as to what ought to be
done, be requested its immediate decision
to that effect, otherwise he should feel
obliged, as far as he could, by the exer
cise of legitimate authority, to put an
end to tho unhappy controversy which
disturbed tho peace and prostrated the
business of Louisiana, by the recognition
uud support of that government which
was recognized and upheld by tho courts
of the state. It seemed advisable that
he should state which courso he should
feel bound to pursue in reference to the
matter, in the event of no aetico beios
taken by Congress at that time, but sub
ject to any satisfactory arrangements that
might be made by tho parties to tho con
troversy, and which of all things was
the most desirable. It would be his
duty, so far as it might be necessary for
him to act, to adhere to tho government
heretofore recognized by him. The pres.
ident again submits this question to Con
gress, and will continue to act as ho has
horetofore ncted relativo to the affairs of
Louisiana, unless otherwise controlled by
Congress.
Tho President reiterates his confidence
in tho Jniian peace policy. If adhered
to he says it will produco additional ben
eficial results, nnd ultimately free the
frontier of Indian depredations. He al
ludes to the civil service reform, as close,
ly adhered to as the opposition manifested
against it permitted. Its results havo
been made beneficiul, having elevated the
capacity and tone of appohtmentr iu the
several departments of the government,
but it would bo impossible to continue the
reform without, the direct support of Con
gnjss, sanctioned by the people. He al
ludes te the reports of the heads of the
several departments which accompany the
message, and calls attention to their re
spective rcccommcndations. Ho again rec
ommends tho pussago of a law establish
ing a court for tho adjudication of claims
of aliens against the government, a bill
for which purpose was introduced by
Judgo Lawrence at tho previous session
of Congress. Tho President docs not al
lude to Utah affairs, tho subject being
left open for future consideration. He
calls attention to tho fact that Cliinose
emigrants continue to be brought to the
country under the condition of slaves, ac
cording to contract, snd also women,
whose character is such as to demoralize
the communities in which they are loca
ted, aro brought over. Ha itivites legis
tioo on this subject, saying it will bo his
pleasuro as well as duty to enforce any
law ou the subject
Tho annual report of Secretary Rob-
eson sljows the navy to be in a remarka
bly efficient condition, both as regards the
number of vessels, their armament, and
sea-going qualities. Their prerent num
ber is 103, with 1254 guns, tho arma
ment having been slightly increased by an
increase in tho number of guns on the new
ships. Of the iron-olads, or armed ves
sels, 16 lira of a class and in condition for
actual and efficient service ; four others
of the class of powerful doublc-turreted
monitors are actually on hand undergoing
repairs, and a fifth is well worth the same
attention, but the rcmaiudcr may be count
ed as really useless for any active and
eflicent purposo One-balf of the steam
navy adapted to cruising is in commission
and in actual service This number of
vessels cannot be prudently diminished,
but if it is to be maintained there must be
a gradual and constant addition to the ta
vy to supply tho places of those which are
each year fouud to bo worn out and unfit
for further service, and for this purpose
a fixed amount of tonnage should bo built
every year. This amount may be small,
but it should be constant and unfailing
To this end tho depmtmect has accumu
lated a large amount of live-oak timber in
tho various navy-yards, where it will year
ly improve in condition and be available
as the very best material for the frames
of any ships it muy at any time bo neces
sary or desirable to build.
The Virgioius affair is referred to, as is
the presence of yellow fuverat Peosacola.
An account is given of tho naval drill in
the gulf of Mexico, and uredit awarded to

The secretary calls atteotioo to the im
portance of the bydiograghio office, and
recommends that it receive from Congress
such mpport as may place it on a footing
with the most important of such institu
tions abroad. He thinks special attention
should be givon to the surveys of the
North I'aoifio ocean. He alludes to the
report concerning navy yards to be made
by the Senate naval committee, and re
news the recommendations made in his
previous aonual reports in reference to oa
vy yards and urges the propriety of in
creasing aud developing their resources.
He calls attention to the use of torpedoes
as a means of naval warfare. The disci
pline of the marine corps is reported cred
itable, but the force should be enlarged.

On the town there has been a debt, of long

The Grand List is now. I think, forty-two

it is, in my opinion, our duty to enter into
such arrangements with the corporation as
to lift it by a few installment!. It is not
with us as it is with growing towns. Al
ready they have men of wealth, and more,
from time to time, are to be expected.
Such towns, therefore, will be in a better
condition to meet such liabilities in the fu
ture than in the present. The contrary
is the case with us. We have no men of
wealth, and not but a few in, what way
be called, easy circuin tauces. I look for

may come, will be nnlv such ss buy out

impose, and, if no bankruptcies follow, tow

therefore, the future holds out no better
prospects than tho present. And, for one,
I prefer to sacrifice ourselves, who have
involved our town in this great calamity,
rather than fasten it upon posterity, who,
so far as the future may be divined by the
present, will have burdum enough of their
own. Doe any one reply "that the town
cannot meet such installments, as I sug-ger-t."
My answer is ready. We can do
it as well as any in the coming twenty
years. At any rule, if we cannot, none
during the life of the bonds can. Then,
in honor, not to say in morals, it is im
peratively onus to reliovo tbe coming
town, from such a crushing load. There

to it) let a town meeting be convoued at
tho earliest day, to test the taxpayers on
the matter. Better to settle the matter
now than to have so appalling an incum
brance lie upon our properly. Nay let
this matter go down and what prudent

Mr. Editor:
In your editorial of Dec. 2d, I notice
a tiradd on your representative, who if as
vilo a man as you represent him to be,
should not be allowed to enjoy the confi
dence and respect of such a largo propor
tion of all who know him, and go unscathed,
except by editors whom he does not pat-
rouize. I am not a member of tho party
that elected him, but am a member of his
family, eoncqucntly have taken iutercst
in this matter of "mileage grab" enough
to ascertain tho facts in tho case, which are
as follows: The said representative was a
member of tbe mileage committee, he
labored for the short route for Lamoille
County, together with the adoption of the
same plan throughout tbe State and in the
final adjustment of this county was the
only one who voted for the short route.
After this he consulted other represent
lives similarly situated in this county. who
could not got to Monlpelicr by public con.
veyance in any one day, except by rait
and they dooided as it was the custom of
tbe Stste, and the only route they trav
eled by publio conveyance, to accept it.
Your representative is not a policy man
to receive or rejoct this fee as a praotical
politician might ; but did receive pay for
110 miles, Johnson representative for
117 and Eden representative prorata
Now would it not be a hard matter to make
this community believe that these men did
all commit an unpardonable wrong by ac
cepting this fc. Would it not be well
for the publio to know that you are actu
ated by a personal hatred, and tha. bis
opinion of you is such that he deems your
article of too little consoquenee to answer,
This explanation I trust you will deem
proper for me to make, and thanking you
for past personal favors,
I remain Yours truly,

On the 22nd day of Si plnnber a young
one night
clothes were. Mr. Smith niaJe some re
ply, to the effect that they brought them
Iu with them, supposing that he referred
to their coat, which they had thrown off
in the Gold, while at work. But Pcrlc ns
said lie didn't mean that, but referred to
the ololbos of Miss Ball. Smith then
drew out a story which led him to suspect
thst he was on a clue and so bo thought
he would quietly follow it np.
Taking into bis confidence Geo. Bron
son. tbey went to the young man's homo
in Fairfax and there the boy's mother.
Mrs. Riggs. told them the same story
that he had. with some other particulars.
The story in brief is that a man named
John Mason, soma fifty years old, aud a
spinner by occupation, had spent consid
erable time at Mr. Riggs' when uot at
work in the factories at Fairfax, Euos
burgh Falls, Sholdon or elsewhere. He
had been thero the week beforo tbe mur
der and told them that when ho came
again ho might bring a friend with htm.
On Saturday night July 25th the next
day after tho murder, two men came to
their house after they had retired and
tried to get in, one calling on both Mr.
and Mrs. Riggs to open the door, but
they refused them admittance, Mrs. R.
is positivo that the man calling was John
M ason.
Ho was not seen aftor for some six
week, when ho returned there, and in
conversation went on to describe bow
Miss Hall was murJored. He said it
was dono by one man, though another
was preseut; that he sprang in behind
her, seized her and when she screamed ho
struck heron tho head with a stone; that
ho then drew her over the fence, which
ho had previously thrown down, and drag
ged her to the thicket; that she (here
caught hold of a staddle aud he 6truck
her hand with a club breaking thee of
the fingers : that other blows wore then
dealt, and they drew her further on into
tho woods ; that they pushed her watch
aud belt one side into the leaves (and the
woman gave such description of tho watch
as he gave her, and it is said to he toler
ably like); that after they hud lain her
behind the stump she rolled be: lieud
for some time und then breathed her last ;
they then laid her out ami went down to
tho stream nod washed themselves, taking
along her bundle; that they examined
her wallet before leaving her, but found
nothing in it but her teacher, a certificate
and some poetry clipped from a paper;
they first buried her bundle, which he
said contained her drawers, night dress,
slippers etc , in the sawdust at the mill
but afterward took out a stotio from the
underpiuing and thrust it in thero.
Tho young man Perkins says that one
of tbo men then went off south towards
FniiTux and the other camo to St. Albans
and took the train south. Mrs. Riggs at
the time called the utteotion of Deputy
Sheriff Ilalbert to tho mutter, and he
went to her house and investigated it.
But he had no confilence in, it, and the
woman herself says that folks don't al
ways believe what she tells.
But thero is another and even more sus
piuiojs circuit stance iclated by her, relat
ing to the Minard murder, which occurred
only a few days before tho murder of Miss
Ball. The next day after that murder,
and before it was known in St. Albans,
she says that Mason c.ime to lior house
and told her all about it. She had not
then heard of it, but afterward h:urd the
faots as they betsamo known to the public,
and they uorrosponded with the story that
ho had told her. At that time she asked
him to fix tho clock, which was out of re
pair. He said he coulJu't for he hadn't
any tools not even a knifo. She says she
knows that he had previously hndakuite,
for she had used it and broken the point
off one of the blades. She was then asked
to give a description of the knife, which
she did, aud it corresponded precisely with
the appearance of the knife that was taken
from the body of Minard. She was aikcd
if sbe should know tbe knifo on sight, and
she thought she would. A large numbor
knives were then produced and she se
lected one that she was very positive was
Mason's. It was the same knife that was
taken from the body of Minard.
Muson disappeared shortly after relat
ing the story to her and his whereabouts
are not know. While the authorities are
by no means sanguino this will lead to a
discovery of the murderer of either victim,
yet the story is sufficiently suspicious so
that they will learn what moro about it
they can. Masou had known Miss Ball,
ha-i seen ber at her sister's in Sheldon, and
it is said he acquired a viol.mt dislike for
her. Mrs Riggs says when he told her
tho strange story he said the girl was mar
dered frem ill-wjll and uot to cover up an
other crime
