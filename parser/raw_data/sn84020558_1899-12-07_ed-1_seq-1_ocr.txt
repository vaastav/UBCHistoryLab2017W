THE
ONLY SENATE DAY
There Was No Open Ses
sion of the House.
THE FINANCIAL BILL IN
Making a New Eule by Which, a
Vote "Will Be Beached Next
"Week -Eight Hundred measures
Were Introduced in the Senate.
The Contested Election Caees for
a Seat.
Washington, Dec. 6. Nearly SOO bills
and Joint resolutions, several important
concurrent resolutions and petitions,
numbering hundreds, were presented
to the senate today. The majority of
the bills were old stagers. Few were
of national interest and importance.
Mr. Aldrich had the honor of intro
ducing the first measure in the senate.
It was the financial bill drawn by the
senate committee on finance, of which
Mr. Aldrich is chairman, and probably
was the most important measure in
troduced during the day.
Resolutions were offered providing
for an investigation by the judiciary
committee of all phases of polygamy
recently presented in connection with
what is known as the Roberts case, ex
pressing the sympathy of the senate
for the Boers in their war with Great
Britain, and declaring that Senator N.
B. Scott of West Virginia is not en
titled to a seat in the senate. Mr. Har
ris, populist of Kansas, was appointed
temporary member of the committee
on privileges and elections. The ap
pointment is important and significant
because the committee has under con
sideration the Quay, Clark and Scott
contests.
A meeting of the senate committee on
privileges and elections has -been called
for tomorrow. .
At the opening of the session the re
ports of the secretary of the treasury,
the attorney-general and the con
troller' of the treasury were presented.
Senator Cullom presented a bill
to provide a form of government
for Hawaii. Pettus presented a bill to
repeal the war stamp act. Rawlins
presented a resolution providing for
the full investigation of alleged polyga
mous practices in the United States.
Mason offered a resolution extending
the best hopes of the senate to the
Boers in their contest for liberty.

members of the house of representa
tives gave their unanimous approval
today, to the house financial bill, re

rule be prepared for the immediate
consideration of this measure. The
terms of this special rule are practi
cally agreed upon and provide that the

The caucus of the republican mem
bers of the house was resumed at 2
o'clock to consider plans for considera
tion of the financial till. The mellng

terest manifested gave promise of a
protracted session.
MR. ROBERTS' PAY.
Washington, Dec. 6. Whether the
pay of Mr. Roberts of Utah is stopped
as the result of the action of the house
in refusing him a seat, has not been
passed upon by the house officials and
will not directly arise until the Janu
uary pay certificates are issued by
Speaker Henderson.
Representative Taylor, chairman of
the republican committee to investigate
the case of Mr. Roberts, has called a
meeting of the committee for 11 o'clock
tomorrow. Mr. Taylor says the initial
meeting will be to determine upon a
line of action. He could not say how
soon the committee will be able to re
port. o
A TALE OF HORROR
The Burning of a Negro at Maysville
Kentucky.
Maysville, Ky., Dec. 6. Richard
Coleman, colored, the confessed mur
derer of Mrs. James Lashbrook, wife of
his employer, expiated his crime in
daylight today at the hands of a mob
consisting of thousands of citizens, by
burning at the stake, after suffering
torture and fright beyond description.
The dreadful spectacle occurred on
the peaceful cricket grounds of this
city. The barbarities inflicted upon
this young negro by the citizens of one
of the most highly civilized cities of the
state are almost beyond belief, and can
only be accounted for by the intense
horror created by a long consideration
of the atrocious crime of which full
confession had been made by Coleman.
The place of execution had been se
lected weeks ago in accordance with all
other arranged details of the pro
gramme mapped out by the leaders of
the mob. The prisoner was dragged to
a sapling and strapped against the
tree, facing the husband of the victim.
Large quantities of dry brush and
large bits of wood were piled around
him while he was praying for speedy
death. James Lashbrook, the husband
of the victim, applied the first match to
the brushwood. A brother of the vic
tim struck the second match. Some
one with a knife was viciously slash
ing at the prisoner's chest.
By a sort of cruel concurrence of ac
tion on the part of the mob no fatal
shot was fired. The purpose seemed to
be to give the wretch the greatest pos
sible amount of torture. A fatal shot
would have been merciful, but there
was no mercy in the crowd sur
rounding Richard Coleman. As the
flames arose, his horrors increased. He
made vain efforts to withdraw his
limbs from the encroaching fire, and
his eyes rolled in a frenzy of suffering.
The ropes securing him to the tree
were burned and his body finally fell
forward into the burning pile. Even
then, although it was not certain
whether he was. living or dead, the
vengeful purpose of the crowd led them
to use rails and long poles to push his
body back into the flames.
It is not certain how long life lasted.
During the process, while his voice
could be heard, he begged for a drink
of water, his tongue protruding and
his eyeballs fairly starting from his
head. At the end of three hours the
body was practically cremated. Dur
ing all that time the members of the
family of Mrs. Lashbrook had re
mained to keep up the fire and keep up
the body in position where it would
continue to burn. After three hours a
nephew of Mrs. Lashbrook was still
pushing the body on the burning em
bers. It is said that on the march through
the city the prisoner's eyes had been
burned out by acid thrown in an egg
shell. In all the thousands who con
stituted the mob there was not a sin
gle effort made to disguise or conceal
identity. No man wore a mask. All
the leaders of the mob are well known
and there are hundreds of witnesses
who can testify to their part in the
tragedy. They Include the leading citi
zens in all lines of business, and many
are members of the church.
o
MOURNING ENVELOPES.
The Black Bordered Variety Proscribed
In France.
Paris, Dec. 6. The French postoffice
is being deluged with letters of com
plaint over the enforcement of the de
partment's recent order prohibiting
the passage through the mails of en
velopes bearing the customary black
border in token of mourning. The
new rule psrmits the use of note paper
with as deep a border as the sender de
sires, but the cover must be white, or
may be tinted, but is not to have a
black edge. '
The postoflice department gives as
its reason for the new regulation that
mourning envelopes are too easily
tampered with. They can be opened,
it is officially explained in answer to
the numerous complaints, and if the
gummed edge is torn or frayed in the
process, a little ink rubbed over the
surface makes everything look right.
One consequence of the new order is
the increased sale of envelopes with
tinted edge and it is not improbable
that the use of these as a token of
mourning may entirely supersede the
use of the time-honored black bor
dered variety.
o
RETURNED EMPTY.
San Francisco, Dec. 6. The trans
port Glenogle arrived today from
Manila. She did not have any pass-
J engers.
GRIEVANCE ADJUSTED.
Bloomburg, Pa., Dec. 6. The griev
ance over the wages of 230 car builders
employed by the American Car &
Foundry company at Berwick has been
adjusted and the men have returned to
work after a three days' strike.
o
LULL IN WAE NEWS
Boers Closing on Ladysmith a Week
Ago.
London, Dec. 6. Again there is a
complete lull in war news. Ladysmith
has established heliographic commun
ication with Frere, and it is reported
that all was well up to Sunday.
A dispatch from the Boer laager by
way of Lourenzo Marquez, dated
Thursday, November 3.1, confirms the
report that the commandos have been
closing in upon Ladysmith and mount
ing big guns in new positions.
JOUBERT IS ILL.
But the
Boers continue
Ladysmith.
to Worry
Pretoria, Dec. 6. General Joubert is
indisposed and has arrived at Volks
rust across the Transvaal border for
medical treatment. All Is quiet at
Kimberley.
LATEST FROM LADYSMITH.
London, Dec. 6. The budget of news
from Ladysmith which arrived today
brings the story of the beleaguered gar
rison up to November 29. In spite of
the rumors of a retrograde movement
upon the part of the Boers the stories
just received show that the garrison
though still strong was suffering from
confinement, restricted diet and an in
creasing volume of Boer artillery fire.
o
SICE SOLDIERS
Repulse a Filipino Attack
and
Capture Prisoners.
libnila, Dec. 6. Lieutenant Colonel
Parker of the Forty-fifth infantry com
manded at Vigan, province of South
t
Ilcos, when that place was attacked on j
Monday, December 4 (not last night as
previously reported) by a force of In
surgents. The American force consist
ed of company B of the Thirty-third
regiment and 150 sick men, many of
whom shared in the first attack, which
was made at 4 o'clock in the morning
and lasted until 8 o'clock. The Filipi
nos who were estimated to have num
bered about 100 men and who were
commanded by General Mino came
from the outskirts of the town to the
post. The fighting was from housa to
house and almost hand to hand. The
Americans captured eighty-four rifles
and several prisoners. The official re
port says three men were wounded.
Colonel Bisbee is sending reinforce
ments to Vigan on board the gunboat
Wheeling. Colonel Parker praised the
bravery of the sick American soldiers.
Every man who was able to stand
handled a rifle during the attack.
ON AGUINALDO'S TRAIL.
Washington, Dec. 6. General Otis to
day cabled to the war department that
he had had no word front Colonel
Young for a we?k. This is taken to in
dicate that Young is continuing in his
hot pursuit of Aguinaldo and prob
ably is in a country where he regards
it as unsafe to use couriers.

DREADED HIS WEDDING.
Belleville, 111., Dec. 6. Fred Vogel
sent a bullet into his brain this morn
ing a few hours before the time set
for his wedding with Mrs. Emma Fer
renbach of Freeburg. Vogel and Mrs.
Ferrenbach, whose maiden name was
Struntz, were engaged to be married
ten years ago, when she was a girl o
eighteen. They quarreled and sepa
rated and later Miss Struntz was mar
ried to Ferrenbach. About two years
ago the couple were divorced. Vogel
reappeared and pressed his suit until
finally Mrs. Ferrenbach consented to
marry him.

Phoenix was clothed in purple yes
terday, a mark of honor to the Elks
gathered here from nearly every lodge
in Arizona. Tucson, one of the strong
est lodges, was singularly not repre
sented, though a large delegation was
expected yesterday morning. Flagstaff
and Prescott sent down many gentle
men in tall hats and purple and as fine
linen as is ever manufactured into
dusters. They made a day of it, lack
ing, perhaps, some of the excitement of.
the first day of the carnival, but no
more fun could have been crowded
into it unless there had been more
hours.
Aside from the B. P. O. E. demon
strations and the foot ball contests at
the park there was little of the car
nival in evidence. The musical pro
gramme was not carried out, and that
part of it devolving upon the Chinese
and wild Indians perhaps never will
be executed. It was discovered that
the Celestials and aborigines could not
be made to understand that an agree
ment was a sacred thing.
The crowd on the street was not quite
so dense as on Monday, although it was
estimated that there were more peo
ple in town. Two days and nights of
oven a carnival is calculated to wear
off the wire edge of curiosity, so that
many residents as well as visitors pre
ferred the seclusion of their homes to
the racket of the town. Some of the
visitors, especially those from Tucson,
went home on Tuesday night and
more last night.
The weather, concerning which there
has been some apprehension since
Tuesday morning, cleared yesterday af
ternoon, giving assurance of at least
two more unbroken days of Arizona
sunshine.
THE ELKS ON PARADE.
A Magnificent Representation of the
Order Was Witnessed.
The cowboys and Indians gave way
yesterday to the Elks, and joined in
making the parade of the day a most
interesting feature of the carnival
week. The train brought Elks from
all parts of the southwest to the city,
and never was such a large gathering
of the members of a secret society seen
in this city. The crowds were as much
interested in the parade of the morn
ing as they were in the first great pa
geant of the carnival.
The parade was a magnificent af
fair. While there were not as many
beautiful floats as were seen on Mon
day, the parade was full of interest. It
represented the strength of the Eiks in
the southwest. The sentiment which
was illustrated by the floats was beau
tiful. One represented Justice, and
was very prettily designed: another
showed the charity of the Elks, one
"Fidelity," and the fourth brotherly
love.
The parade formed at the corner of
Seventh street and Adams, marched
down Adams to Fifth avenue, thence
south to Washington street, and east
on Washington to Seventh. All along
the line the streets were thronged.
The Elks were attired in linen dusters
and wore plug hats. Each member
carried a cane which bore a purple rib
bon tie. On the lapels of their coats
the Elks wore the handsome badge
of the day, which was of purple color,'
with an elk's head hung from a key. On
the key was the word "City," which
signified that the key of the city was
theirs for the day.
The reviewing stand at the court
house plaza was occupied by the queen
of the carnival and her maids of honor.
As the Elks passed this stand the plug
hats were raised in honor to the
beautiful young ladies who are the
central figures of the social side of the
great carnival. Washington street was
fairly packed with people. The spec
tators formed a compact wall for
blocks, and hundreds viewed the spec
tacle from the roofs of business blocks.
It was a grand opening of the day
claimed by this society, and the Elks
have reason to feel proud.
The chief officers of the order led
the pageant on horseback. There were
three of them, one bearing the Elks'
flag. The Pioneer , band came next in
line, followed by a carriage containing
the exalted rulers. Twenty-eight Elks
marched after the carriage, and em
braced the members of a visiting so
ciety who came to participate in the
pleasures of the day. Then came the
float "Charity." A beautiful girl held
a purse toward a widow and her son,
the scene representing the benevolence
of the Elks. The float was dressed in
j purple, the chosen color of the Elks,
as were the other two floats that fol-
lowed. Then came twenty-three Elks
followed by the float "Justice." A
I great eagle was placed on this float,
hovering over the head of a goddess of
I liberty, who held the scales of justice
I In one hand, the other resting on a
! sword at her sich?. A carriage con-
taining members of the Albuquerque
: society preceded the Albuquerque band.
and five Elks from New Mexico walked
after the band. The third float fol
I lowed in the line. It represented
"Brotherly Love." An immense cup
, provided a feast for a dozen small
boys who wore sailor hats, and sur
rounded the cup enjoying the good
things placed at their disposal. A
clock in the background marked the
hour of eleven.
Thirty-four Elks came next and after
them the fourth float, "Fidelity." An
elk's head rested on a pedestal and was
guarded by two young ladies and a
young man, who were prettily cos
tumed. The last contingent of the
Elks followed and there were fifty-four
of them. The Indian school band led
the cowboys and Indians and the indus
trial floats that came next. Doc Good
in rode at the head of the cowboys.
There was not such a large turnout as
was seen on Monday, but there was a
good representation and they formed
a most interesting feature of the pa
rade. The "Curio" was represented by a
handsome float which contained In
dian art tastily arranged. Following
the float came the Indians dressed in
the paint and feathers of warriors Tho
i Salt River valley was represented by
me iwo noats that appeared in the
Monday parade, one showing the immi
grant coming to the valley and the
other displaying the prosperity which
results from settling hern. A string
of "jerky" was strung on the cover of
the emigrant wagon, and made a
most realistic adornment. Lawrence &
Clark participated with a display of
carriages which were occupied by lit
tle girls. The three floats of the Indian
school were in line, and the spectators
were glad to get a second view of
these interesting representations of the
industrial life of that institution.
The fire department turned out to
the alarm sounded by the Elks, and
contributed to the interest of the pa
rade. Chief Fromm rode at the head of
the division, followed by Mariner's
juvenile band, and the engine, hook
and ladder and hose carts followed,
the most of the apparatus bearing
elaborate decorations. Ezra Thayer's
float was witnessed again, as was also
Andrews & Son's bicycle float and the
Ilallwood Cash Register company. The
rear of the parade was formed by a
contingent ot Indians.
During the morning the Elks re
ceived the visiting delegates at their
rooms, and the badges were distributed
among them. Prescott lodge No. 330
came down in a body on yesterday's
excursion and the following members
of that lodge appeared in the parade:
George Ruffner, J. Hudgens, E. E.

ELKS ON THE DIAMOND.
Sensational Exhibition of the Great
National Game Yesterday.
There was a ball game at the park
yesterday afternoon, but no one knows
what the score was. The scorer left
the grounds early in the game and the
last seen of him was somewhere in the
vicinity of the insane asylum.
Reese Ling of Prescott was the um
pire. He was placed in a cage and
armed with a six-shooter. He had no
difficulty in making his decisions good,
no matter how unjust they were. The
teams were composed of Elks, the one
from Prescott and the other from
Phoenix. The players were gorgeously
dressed in pretty suits made up of
carnival colors, and each man wore a
white plug hat. Some of them wore
patent leather shoes and silk stock
ings, but the umpire allowed them in
the game just the same.
The teams were made up as fol
lows: Prescott Morrison,- catcher;
Dalton, short-stop; Litt, third base;
Andrews, second base; Jaeger, first
(Continued on Third rage.)
HORSES AND BATTALIONS.
San Francisco, Dec. 6. The trans

the remaining battalions of the Forty
ninth infantry and 167 recruits. The
Centennial carries horses.

H. K CHEN0WETH RESIGNS
The Nogales Collectorship Fight at
an End.
Washington, Dec. 6. (Special.) H.
K. Chenoweth, collector of customs at
Nogales, Ariz., has handed his resig
nation to the secretary of the treasury.
It has been accepted and will take ef
fect on December 15. William M. Hoey
of Muncie, Ind., will succeed him.
This will dispose of a dispute which
has been going on at Nogales between
the friends and enemies of Collector
Chenoweth regarding the result of the
investigation which has been in pro
gress in the treasury department for
some time.
First a telegram was received, or at
least one was said to be received, at
Nogales stating that the charges
against the collector had failed. There
followed on the heels of it another,
giving assurance that the charges had
been sustained and that he had been
removed. This was in turn denied, but
two weeks ago L. B. Hayes of Tucson
had a dispatch from First Assistant
Postmaster-General Perry S. Heath
saying that he had been advised by the
treasury department that Mr. Hoey
would assume charge of the Nogales
custom house on December 1.
Thus ends a fight which has been in
progress ever since Collector Cheno
weth's appointment, and he was the
first officer in Arizona appointed un
der President McKinley's administra
tion.
The charges against the collector
were made early last spring and were
based upon alleged violations of the
civil service rules, in the manner of
conducting examinations and promo
tions. There were beside accusations
of misconduct in office in retaining
upon the pay roll persons who per
formed no service.
An investigation was conducted at
Nogales last summer by special treas
ury agents, and upon their report the
collector was ordered removed and his
successor, Mr. Hoey, was appointed.
Mr. Chenoweth hurried to Washlnfton,
secured a reopening of his case, and a
telegram was sent to Mr. Hoey coun
termanding instructions to immediately
take charge of the office. The investi
gation was resumed about two months
ago.
A DOUBLE KILLING.
Racine Clergyman and Wife Both Shot
By Burglars.
Racine, Wis., Dec. 6. Rev. D. B.
Cheney, pastor of the First Baptist
church, and his wife were shot and
fatally wounded by a burglar who en
tered their home at 10 o'clock this
morning.

THE YAQUI WAR.
Late Dispatches Received From Gen
eral Torres.
Ortiz, Mexico, Dec. 6. A courier Just
arrived from the scene of the YaquI
war with dispatches from General Tor
res, and reports that fighting ceased
November 28. The Indians retreated to
Tonichi. Signal fires indicate that a
concerted movement is being planned
by the Indians. The Yaquis have lost
200 in battle. The Mexicans lost fif
teen killed and thirty wounded.
o
A FRENCH OPINION
Temps on the Message of President
Mckinley.
Paris, Dec. 6. The Temps says it
finds "a want of decision" in Presi
dent McKinley's message to congress
which must be disconcerting for the
country, "which needs an unequivocal
firm statement." Referring to the
paragraph on foreign affairs the Temps
says: "After Mr. Chamberlain it was
President McKinley's turn and he has
shown himself tactful. He speaks
warmly of friendship but does not
breathe a word of alliances. Refer
ring to South Africa, President Mc
Kinley held the balance level between
the two belligerents and even inflicted
on Mr. Chamberlain and the preten
tious imperialists the cruel word med
iation. In short, the message will lit
tle please the noisy champions of an
alliance, wihch it ignores, while it will
give satisfaction to all wise friends of
a good understanding between the two
great Anglo-Saxon nations."
THE GERMANS PLEASED.
Berlin, Dec. 6. The German govern
ment and press almost unanimously
welcome President McKinley's mes
sage to congress. Even the agrarian
papers always opposed to things Amer
ican, grudgingly admit that the mes
sage is fair and honest.
MONEY MARKET
An Object of Great Con
cern Until January I.
SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT
There Is no Expectation of a Return of
the Acute Stringency Through.
Which the Country Hat Just
Passed, Yet Speculators Have
Grown Cautious By Recent Ex
perience. New York, Dec. 6. (Special.) The
stock market is still chiefly dominated
by monetary conditions, and until these
show a more favorable tendency the
upward movement in securities vis
likely to meet with considerable diffi
culty if carried out upon any consid
erable scale. Apart from this factor
the outlook is especially favorable, as
has been repeatedly explained in our
previous advices. The chief . concern,
therefore, is the course of the money
market until after January 1. The ad
vance in the Bank of England rate, of
course, means that no relief can be
expected in that quarter in the form
of gold Imports; especially while the
Transvaal war shows no sign of an ap
proaching end. Considerable hope has
been entertained that the return off
currency from the interior would
bring the supply of loanable funds In
New York nearer to normal conditions,
but it is not safe to place too much
reliance on these anticipations. Funds
are now returning, but less freely than
expected, the great activity of trade
and industry everywhere retarding the
movement. Meanwhile, the treasury
receipts continue to exceed expend
itures; and had it not been for Secre
tary Gage's offer to buy bonds some
sharp manipulation of money rates
would have been possible. The secre
tary has shown his wisdom in extend
ing the time for offers of bonds until
December 23; that being the only avail
able method of offsetting the effects ot
cumbersome treasury operations. Up
to date the offers have amounted to
nearly $17,000,000. The market shows a
decided disposition to run on special
ties; and some excitement was mani
fested on reports of a deal between
Pennsylvania and Baltimore & Ohio
which seems to have had no other
foundation than some sort of working
understanding which will prevent
losing competition.
Although the bank reserves are show
ing an assuring rate of recovery and
there is no expectation of any return
of acute stringency, there is yet an in
disposition to venture upon large spec
ulative operations in dependence upon
any real and inflating ease in money.
The stringency of the last three montiTS
has been so severe and persistent and
has caused such sweeping liquidations
in the stock market that those in
fluences have made large operators
unwilling to take anything for grant
ed as to future ease in Wall street
loans. Speculators are preponderantly
very bullish and in no quarter do they
find any reason for abating their atti
tude; and that feeling will cause them
to cling to their present holdings with
great tenacity; but it is not likely to
induce them yet to materially increase"
their holdings. Intelligent men are
wanting to comprehend more fully the
causes that lay at the bottom of the
late disturbances in the money market;
and the more they study the situation
the more they incline to the con
clusion that the chief adverse in
fluences are implanted in the laws reg
ulating the national banks. During the
present year, there has been an ex
traordinary increase in the currency
and credit wants of the people.
