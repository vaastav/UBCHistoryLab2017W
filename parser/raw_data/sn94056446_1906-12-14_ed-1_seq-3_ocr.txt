The Biff Stick And Tlie Old Spell
ing Book.
President Roosevelt's triumph
in printing his message in simpi-
fied spelling was brilliant but
meteoric.
When he saw the message in
the newspapers , spelled in the
old familiar style , he must have
felt as does one who wakes from
a sweet dream of glory to the
dreary dullness of commonplace.
There are some things the "big
stick' ' can accomplish , and some
it can't.
It can't force families into hav
ing more children than they
want , nor can it compel people to
spell well when they don't know
how , or to spell badly when they
do.
And there arc some things in
which it can't coerce congress ,
cither.
The house of representative ! ) ,
which in theory at least , is close
to public feeling and promptly
responsive to it. will stand by the
dear old spelling books. The
Congressional Record and other
printed matter emanating from
the house will be printed as here
tofore.
The supreme court has incident
ally handed down its weighty de
cision in the matter by rebuking
an attorney who , in a brief laid
before it , had presumed to
"simplify" the spelling of a judi
cial decision.
The executive , the legislative
and the judiciary departments of
the federal government may be
jealous of its own constitutional
rights and powers. Heretofore
they have split on grave problems
and withstood the shock. No
doubt they will survive this one.
With the sovereign people ,
who are superior to constitutions ,
the right to spell as well as they
know how , or as badly as they
must , is one of those inalienable
ones indicated by inference in the
Declaration of Independence.
The New York board of educa
tion has voted 32 to 4 against the
introduction of simplified spell
ing in the schools of that city.
Few other school boards have
deemed the matter worthy to be
brought ii ] ) .
Meanwhile , despite the "big
stick , " the old spelling book that
was the delight and despair of
our childhood remains sacred in
the memory and supreme in au
thority.

Word has been received by rela
tives of Fred Clift , who is well
know here to the effect that his
wife died at Phoenix , Arizona ,
Wednesday November , 24 , l'JOf > .
Mr. Clift made his home in and ,
around Humboldt for several
years , spending most of his time
at the barbar trade. In 1898 he
went to Salt Lake City and en
gaged in the barber business at
that place. He was married to
Miss Mabel Johnson two years
ago and moved to Helper , Utah ,
which has been their home until
a short time ago when they re
moved to Phoenix , for Mrs. Clift's
health. A change of climate was
not effectual and death came at
last to break up the home. A
host ol friends and relatives
share with Fred his grief and
sorrow. Humboldt Standard.

Suspicious of His Sex.
tip in the northern pirt of the
state there has been a young
gentleman school teacher who
has been having a strenuous
time of it the past few weeks.
Shortly after lie had been hired
to teach a country school the
rumor became current that he
was a woman , masquerading in
man's clothes , and the talk be
came so strong that the school
board determined to dismiss him
from school , and in consequence
there was great excitement in the
community. Before finally dis
missing him the } ' decided to call
on him , or her , as the case might
be , and talk the matter over , and
a committee of the patrons of the
school was appointed to make a
thorough and searching investi
gation of the charges , one woman
being olaced on the committee.
They set a day for the meeting
and invited the teacher to be
present and "show cause" why
lie or she should not be dismissed
from the school. No other charge
was made against the teacher
except that he was a woman.
The committee met , and after ,
as one report says , "about thirty
seconds they adjourned and the
young man is still teaching that
school. " It is claimed that every
member of that committee was
originally from Missouri.Ex. .
