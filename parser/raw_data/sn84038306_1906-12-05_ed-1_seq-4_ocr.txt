The Dividing Line in Present Day Pol
itics.
The battle for the restriction and
ntrol of organized wealth, which
commenced with Mr. Bryan nom
ination at Chicago in ISilO, is still
the paramount political issue in this
country.
Jt matters little what a man may
call himself, but it counts for a good
deal upon which side of this grer.t
dividing line he stands.
A man is not a democr.-t, no mat
ter wliat he may call himself, if he
is doing nil in his power to uphold
our present industrial oligarchy in
which, a few men practically control
the industries of this greatest, of na­
tions.

as far or
further than Bryan ever did iu de
manding "n far more complete con
trol than at present over these great
corporations." The President recog
nizes tlut these great corporations
have controlled the government and
robbed the people far too long, and
he not only favors their rigorous
control hut goes ahead and advocates
the enactment of legislation which
will tend to dis-ipate and scatter all
great fortunes. If congress will en
act and the courts enforce graduated
income and inheritance tax laws,
such as the President recommends,
many of the burdens of the national
government will be transferred

The President's recommends on

Reminiscent.
In the spring of 1885 the writer
recollects what happened to several
Iowa aspirants for political prefer
ment. They were fellows who im
agined that they could build them
selves up by maligning their po
litical rivals, and as a rule thev did
the Hainan act to the satisfaction of
I iwa's democratic, congressional
delegation. ]u other wordB they
usually furnished the gallows on
which to hang themselvea. In their
recklessness they.would accuse their
opponents of disloyalty to some con
gressman, or defeated candidate for
congress, and that gave the ballot
boxes a chance to testify. If the
congressional candidate in question

Judge Blair's Last Jury Casein Buchan

Journal. When he delivered his
charge to the jury Tuesday in the
case of Fleming vs. Loughren, Judge
A. S. Blair turned oil the last jury
case he will ever try in -Buchanan
county. With this term a service*of
twelve
years on the district bench
for Uuchanan county comes to a

tempered by the hope that in his
Manchester homo he may yet spend
many years of a green and liappy old
age, to which ho is entitled as the
I result of a long life of probity ami
honor.
Judge li'air was first elected in
1891,-and his regular trips to this
county has made him seem to many
of us a citi/.en of our town. We do

decision of his in that time that has
