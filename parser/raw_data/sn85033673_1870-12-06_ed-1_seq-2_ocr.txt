THI F?EIDElr MESSAGE.
In 'pursuance to the CoDstitution ol
the Cnitcd States, Conirresa met yester
.d j.t, it being the first Monday of Decem
ber, when the President's message was
delivered to the Senate and House of
Representatives. The .President con
gratulate! the nation upon the general
peace and profperity of the past year.
It is to be regretted, says he, that a free
exercise of the elective franchise has. by
Tiolence and intimidation, been denied
to citizenj in exceptional cases in
4 eral of the Suites lately in rebellion, and
the verdict of the people has thereby
been reversed. The President tails to
particularize in this matter, but the
public are well enough informed to
know that, when ties rases kare
arisen, the Administration U reposit"

The re-esUblishmeut ta rsc ?' !
temof government disconnected wtH 'Jk
dyoastic traditions of Enrope ap
peared to be a proper subject for the
felicitation of Americans, and ours is re
garded as a simple form of representa-i
tive government that would be well to
attach the hearts of the French people.
God save the mark, since Congress and
the President are the tyrants that sit
upon the liberties of the people, to dis
pose of them as seems best not for the
general good of the people, but for the
interest of the Republican party. We
think with the President that it would
not be well at present to impose our in
stitutions upcu the inhabitants of other
countries, at least until republi
canism has been once more re
stored to our own country. The
President still adheres to his Cuban
policy of refusing to recognize the bel
ligerency of the insurgents. He still
- harps upon the annexation of San Do
mingo to the United States by treaty,
and, although the Senate, at its last ses
sion, refused to confirm that treaty by
the requisite two-thirds vote, still he
was, and is yet, convinced that the best
interests of the country, commercially
and materially, demand it ratification.
Sumner and other Senators did not see
things through Grant's glasses, and was
firm io opposition to this pet measure of
the Administration. The message is
auite lengthy on this subject, and the
old argument is resorted to to induce
fnnffTPss to Durchase Grant an ad
. (
ditional number of presents in the way
: of town lots, to be given him if th San I
Domingo matter is a success. In speak
ing of the Alabama question he regrets
that no conclusion hss been reached for
. tue adjustment of the claims against
Great Britain growing out of the course
adopted V that Government during tb
reUUion. The Cabinet at London, ao
(ar ai its views have been expressed,
does not appear to be willing to concede
that her Majesty's Government was guil
ty of negligence, nor did or permitted
any act duriLg the war by which the
United States has just caose of com
plaint. Our firm and unalterable con
victions are directly the reverse, and
therefore recommends to Congress to ao
tiiorije the appointment of a com mis
rDer to take proof' be amouau and
tbe ownership of the claims or give notice
to tie rprrei.saiive of H.-r Mjety at

the reduction of interest, ' per

weans this, has my hearty support; it it
meaus a collection of all the revenues
for the support of the government, for
the payment of the principal and interest
of the public debt, pensions," et., bydi-
rectly taxing the people, then 1 am
against such revenue reform, and confi
dently believe that the people are wim
me. If it means a failure to provide
the necessary means to defray all ex
penses of the government, and thereby
repudiation of the public debt and pen
sions, then I am still more opposed to it.
Such kind of revenue reform has not
been defended by its advocates to my
kuowledge, and seems to be accepted as
something which is to supply; every
man's wants, without any cost or effort
oo his part. A true revenue reform can
not be made in a day, but must be the
work of national legislation and time.

As an officer of the law, holding prop
erty by virtue of his office, it is " in cus
iola legit," and is to be disposed of by
the lavj.B. L. Die. " In euttodia
Ugit." .
Of property "in custodia ltgis, the
law gives the possession to the-olhecr en
titled to receive it, and who is bonded tor
that purpose.
A general agent always yields to the
authority of a special aud particular
agent.
. A policeman is a general agent. A
coroner is a particular judicial officer or
agent, appointed for this especial pur
pose. Hut even without this, the policy of the
law and tbe intent of the statute would
govern in establishing a precedeut of
such importance.
i' OPINIO. j: ;
J. O. MuffaU vs. Thomas O'tlonnell.
This is an alternative writ of manda
mus issued at the instance of the relator
against the respondent; and tbe question
now is.whether upon the facts of the case
a peremptory writ Khali issue, command-1
ing respondent to deliver to relator .ir
tain property found upon one Frost,
who was killed by accident. The
facts necessary to be noticed are,
that Frost, being taken up trom the
street in an insensible condition, was
taken by a polireainn to tbe Adams
street station-noune; while in this condi
tion all of his valuables were taken ou of
his person by the subordinate of respond
ent, that when Frost awoke from his
state of coma, respondent told him that
his valuables had been taken from him,
and as Frost was about to leave the sta-tioa-house
to go to his friends, he was
asked by refpondeut if he wbthed to have
the eli'pf ta returned to him, when he re
plied: "No, keep them for me until I get
well." In less than twelve hours afur
this Frost was dead. Vnqnestionablr
upon tbe facts, the effects taken by re
spondent from Frost were taken from
him before his death. , , . .
Clearly, then, the rase does not fall
Wilkin the vurdiui tbe statute requiring
tbe Coroner to take possession of the
effects found ''on" (ir "with'1 tbe body of
the dead. ......
It is insisted that it is clearly within
the spirit of the statute, aSsJ that the
r.gbt construction ofthe statute would
give him the property.
It is fs-4 respondent had V right as
Chief of F.Uc to take front Frost the.
effects. While the court cannot agree
with counsel ia this, vet, for this argu
ment, grant that be haJ not. If he was
a wrong-dj-r, does the law devolve upon
the coroner the redress of the wrong?
The question is tt wait authority re

If ' It nj moi this ts toa-

the circumstances certainly the trust
reposed in him as a man should not be
interfered with by any one except 1' rost.
or those who legally represent him; and
this the Coroner does not do. Indeed,
the property should all be returned to
his custody. Let the petition dor Man

the Court M constrained to order this,
it is with commendation of the actum ot
both officers in tho premises: and the
Court hopes that if any harsh feelings
have been engendered Jiy llua proceed

For nothing so clogs the wheels of good

i The Supreme Court of Tennessee com
menced its winter term yesterday. The
six judges were all in attendance. The
Qhief Justice announced that upon an
examination of the docket he found 1247
civil causes uow for trial,- exclusive of
State causes 206 were filed in 18ti7.
TheCourt proposes to ' devote three
months' labor to the docket.and if it is not
lcoken up by quo varrautq proceedings
ia the IVited States Court at Knoxville,
t which three of them were required to
answer oa the second Monday in Janu
ary, the Court will be enabled to give
three full months to the work. The
Chief Justice said the Court had con
salted in full as to whether the dispatch
of bturitiess would be promoted by sitting
ia two sections, as authorized by the Con-.
ventioa. lie said whilst they Had grave
doubts whither any more could he ac
complished by sitting in two sections,
they had determined to make an experi
ment for one week. Next week Nichol
son. ueaaortcs ana aueea win an i
caart in the Supreme Courtroom, trying
the business of the 7th Circuit for 18C7
aad and XeUon, Turner and Free
man will . sil in the' ' Federal
Court room, trying the business of
the tth Circuit for 1x67 and le'68.
The coatt will aefln fall bench during
the present week, and will take up the
svepth circuit and hear causes filed in
li7 and IS6K, commencing with the law
docket, then the equity docket, and then
the State docket of each county.
The Comptroller's report is ready for
presentation to the Legislature. It says
the amount of currency to be received
nuder the tax law for 170 will fall short
of defraying the current expenses of the
State, while the increas-id tax levied for
1W1 will also fall short. The Comp
troller contines: When a Slate that
owes a : bonded deU of $3,539,02,
has a revenue law insufficient to meet her
current expenses, to say nothing of pro
viding a sum to pay tbe semi-annual in
terest, or providing a sinking fund, it
may be taken as pretty conclusive evi
dence that our revenue law need modify
ing. Every dollar received for taxes in
lhTO will be needed to defray expenses of
your honorable body or salaries of your
judges, would exhaust it, while the Pub
lic Printer will require oae-third of it.
There are reasons for it, and cull lor very
prompt measures. We cannot always
borrow; in faet, it is now impossible to
borrow at all upon our revenue law
as ' a basis; this has been tried.
Mem do not lend unless the hoipwer
gives a reasonable an-nrnnc-e of his abil
ity to pay quite parly. After the ad
journment of your honorable body last
July, a loan ly my predecessor in office
ia New York to pay Ward 4 Uriggs be
came due, and having no money, and
having been refuse the authority to!
borrow of lbs Stuto, I came neur
having her bonds hypothecated, at forty
cents on the dollar. They were saved by
great exertion for the time being, but
will yet be lost uuless the meaus are proi
vidtd to pay this claim before January,
1871. The Comptroller recommends
that necessary legislation be taken to
divorce the State from .nil connection
whatever with, railroads, turnpikes, etc.

solidiitoil with two other lines one' from
Yicksburg to Grenada, the other from
Okolona to Eastport or some po'ut on
the TenhesHce river. This latter line
has recently been surveyed by Mr. Win
S. Moon, of this city. The distunce
from Okolona to the Tennessee river, at
or near ' EutporL is iabout nixfy-five
miles. The survey extends through Ful
ton',' the county-seat ofltuwiiihbacftnuty,
up to the valley- of the lombigbee
thence tip Macky's creek, which has the
finest water power in the South, crossing
the dividing ratige of the Tennessee and
Alabama waters six miles south of Iuka,
through which town it passes to the Ton
ncssee. river. The profile of the route.
prepared by 'Mr. Moon,' exhibits a fuir
average grade along the entire line, ul
though it runs through high hills and lo
valleys. Tbe finest specimens of silica,
which is extensively used in the tnantia
facture of glass, nnd pure kaolin, were
found by the engineer iu ' large

used in tbe manufacture of porcelain
and these specimens of . silica and
kaolin, which can be seen in the en
gineer's office, are perfectly pure.VThe
line frotti Nashville to the Tennessee
river, , 'along the old Wayuesborough
route, was .graded before the war, but
during the war the iron was taken up
and placed on other lines, .The road as
consolidated and proposed, runs from.
Yicksburg up the Yazoo Valley toYaioo
Citv and on to Grenada. General
Tucker's road then carries the line from
Grenada, via Houston, to Okolona, aud
this new liue from Okolona to the Ten-
nesse river will connect it with the Nash
ville and Eastport link, thereby forming
almost -an air-lie from Nashville to
Yicksburg. Geueral Tucker's charter
covers the whole line from Vichsburg to
the Tennessee river, and under this char
ter this consolidation and extension will
go into Operation. It is understood that
work will be. commenced on these re
spective lines at an early day, and that
the company , is backed with sufficient
funds to carry on the enterprise to com
pletion. '. This line runs around Mem
