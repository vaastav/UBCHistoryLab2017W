bought. We have them in Rings,
Brooches, Charms, Studs and Cuff

Before the Holidays.
Washington, Dec. 5.-The regular, or
long, session of congress, as it is called.
because there is no constitutional limi
tation upon the period of its duration.
opens at noon to-morrow. The leaders
and a large majority of the members
of both houses are here to partleipate
in the opening ceremonies and President
McKinley has made the journey to
Washington from the bedside of his
dying mother that his absence might
not delay the national legislature at its
.assembling.
The extra session rubs the opening of
the regular session of the excitement
and interest which usually attaches to
it. On the eve of a regular session or
dinarily Washington thrills with ex
citement. The hotel lobbies surge with
place hunters in the wake of the vari
ous candidates for speaker, clerk, etc..
the members are struggling for com
mittee assignments and the air is full of
rumors and plots and counter plots. But
as the house was completely organized
at the extra session and all the com
mittee assignments made then, beyond
the natural stimulus as produced by the
returning statesmen, the regular hang
ers-on and the outlining of schemes by
means of the "third house." or lobby,
Washington to-night is tranquil.
The programme at the house to-mor
row is very simplye and beyond the
spectacular show which it offers to the
curious, has in itself little attraction.
The house will tb callel a ,lleI t i order by the
speaker who, after the c'haplain's in
vocation, will direct ilhe cleri to call the
roll. This having he,.n accomplished
and the presence of a quaurum demon
strated, the clerk will be directed to
notify the senate that the house is
ready for business. and a c'ommittee will
be appointed to wait on the lresider(t.
After that there will 1e a recess to
await the arrival of the presitdnt's an
nual mnessage, which will be read upon
its reception and he followed by an adl
journment until Tuesday. This Is the
regular routine and unless somlething
unforeseen occurs will not he depart"d
from.
It is the intention of the house. I-ad
erg to proceed with the nusiness of the
session as rapidly as ipolibl,. The com
mittee will begin their labors this week
and as all of them have more or lss
hills on hand which were introduced at
the extra session there will be no lack
of material for the house to work on
after the committ e hoppers have began
to grind. The appro Iriations eommit
tee has been at work for If0 days and
t'hairmlan Cannon expects to pass at
least two of the principal hills before
the holidays-the legislative, executive
and judicial and the pensions bills. One
or the other of these bills, it is expect
ed. will he reported by Wednesday and
the end of the week promises to see the
house down to business.
Among the early general measures to
receive consideration is the b nkruptey
Iill. Whether it will be the Nelson bill,
which pIassed the senate at the last ses
sion, or a nloditication of the Torrey
bill, depends upon the temper of the ju
diciary committee, which will submit
the measure to the house.
Beyond doubt there will be several
resolutions of inquiry during the first
week which may be more or less sensa
tional: some of the radical pro-Cuba
members will attempt to get considera.
tion for a Cuban resolution before the
foreign affairs committee can act. Con
gressman Livingston of (thorgia is one
of these. But owing to the nature of the
house rules, all these hasty eftorts will
prove abortive and the measures prob
ably will take their course.
There will be nothing except in dispo
sition on the part of the members to
pIFevent the senate entering promptly
upon its work upon convening to-mor
row, as there is a calendar already
made for it, with about "200 hills re
ported from committees dturit the s)pe
cial session. If any circumstances
should prevent the reception of the
president's message- on Monday. the
probabilities are that the senate will
adjourn over without taking upl any
other business until the message could
be received. With the message read it
will remain with the senate to decide as
to whether it shall seriously enter upon
the work of the session after Monday,
or begin a system of delay intended I,)
throw all important questions over be
yond the Christinas holidays. The in
dications are now for a litthe more ac
tivity than usual during the pre-hoh
day session.
This is largely due to the fact that
the supporters of the adtministration
and advocates of annexation arte \v ry
anxious to secure the earliest nDu:elI"li
conskleration of the treaty with litw il.
Senator Davis, chairman of the c-alin.it
tee on foreign relations, anluloiunc"es his
Iur'pose of pres'sing annexation at the
tarliest possible moment. but it is iroh
able that the matter till not i,, taken
up seriously until the committeec can
have 'a meeting and decide on the de
tails of the iprlNedure. The comniitt e
will be cailed togethe-r Wei-dnsday fir

me'aure providing for the adjustment
of the Pacific railroad debt, but the, sale
of the U'nion Pacific doubltess will have
the effect of causin' the temporary
withdrawal of this bill and the substi
tution of others. Of the 300 bills on the
calendar about 200 are private pension
bills and all of these probably will be
disposed of at one sitting when taken
up. There are also several hundred re
appointments to be considered in execu
tive session,
It is not probable that iuch will be
done in the way of legislation the pres
ent week. There will be an adjournment
for the day after receiving the message
on Monday., and there is no disposition
to, press the Hawaiian matters until
the foreign relations committee agrees
upon a line of action. The indications
are that it will not be taken up in the
senate until next week.
Dark for Cuba.

Senators against action, 42; senators
who favor but do not expect action. 24;
senators for immediate action, 9: sena

'SPARK IS BURNING DIMLY
Mother McKinley Passes the
Fourth Day of Her Illness.
STEADILY WASTING AWAY
No Material Development in Her (aso.
There Is a Possibility That She
May Survive the Night.
No Final Struggle.
Canton, Ohio. 1)ee. ..--Mother Nle
Kinley has ptassied the fourth day of
her illness awl enters upon the fourthi
night with the spark of life still burn
ing dimly. There has not been a ma
terial development in hi-r .ase to-day.
Her condition has continlucd I"ne of
steadily wasting away. The family
watched by the. hi lsitle all day, pre
pared for the endr at any monmentt, iad
sometimes feeling that it had conic,
as the patient was seized with sinking
spells, such as they yesterday mlisto,K
for a second stroke of paralysis. I)ur
ing these attacks she would percept -
ibly weaken, almost cease to breathe,
and show scarcely a sign of anlitia
tion.
For the most part these spells twere
limited to half an hour, and when th.ey
were over, she iwould resume the quiet
repose characteristic of the entire ill
ness. About th, middle of the after
non, however, a more serious sinkini
spell occurred ant lasted for two hours.
Sev ral times those keeping vigil
thought the last flutter of life's flames
had come. The attack passed away at
last, leaving the patient almost the
same as before it occurred. There Is
still a possibilty that she may survive
the night, or even longer, but those who
have been at the bedside most con
stantly have the least, hope of such ,t
result.
C'omrmunication ,was established with
the white house as soon as the presi
dent arrived there this morning and a
telegraph wire is constantly open to
Washington to advise the president. of
every s'-eurretnc in the slrk room. Bie
sides this, he had several times talked
with his brother, Abner, by Ieh.
phone.
I)r. Phillips, the attending physician,
has made a nonmlir r of visits during the
day and this evrening he said he could
impart nothing "entirely neat. Thlr,
had been no notable change during 'the
day. lie was satisfied that this conii
tion would prevail to the end. .Askedr
as to the prospects of her survivinig the
night, he said:
"Yes, there is a plossibility of her liv
ing till morning. Indeed. I ant inlil. ,d
to think she will, biut she has te t
taken so long that no one could make
a prediction for the future with any
assurance of certainty. The case is
one in which we omuHt he prepared t'r
the end at any moment. WVhen thte endt
comes, it will merely be the passing oult
of the eomatose condition in which iho
now rests to the sleep of death. Thir,
will he no rally; no more i1,tscious p'e
riods: no linal strtggle."
The patient has taken no nourishment
since Thursday. It cannot ble admin
istered by ordinary methods and the
case is ,nit in which heroic nmethods f i
administering food are not regarded
justiflaltl'.
The Presiderlnt et ulrns.
Washington, DL'. 't.--President .114,
Kiney. a.companied by Assistant SIee
rrtary flay. arrived in Washington ow\ r
the Pennsylvania at 7:45 o'cloc'k this
morning. He was met by Setcretary AI
ger. Secretary Bliass and Seretary Por
ter and driven to the white house. The
president has received two telegrams
en rout.- to Washington from ('anton.
representing the condition of ilts
mother, but he was anxious for later
news, so Secretary Porter stopped at
the telegraph office on the nay from the
station to inquire for any dispatches
that might be waiting. There was
none. h,io \'er. so the party proceeded
to the white house, where hrieakfast
was had.
In the middle of the forenlion a mnis
