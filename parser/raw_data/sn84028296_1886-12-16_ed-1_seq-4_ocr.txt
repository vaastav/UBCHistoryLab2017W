1ST Mr. Frank P. Cr.indon begins the dis
cussion of the "Misgovernment of Great
Cities," in the January number of The Popu
lar Scirnce Monthly, with nn article in which
f ho difficulties of the question are forcibly set
forth.
J3T A bill which has just passed the House
extends the free postofflce delivery system in
Uhio to Chillicothe, Delaware, Hamilton,
Lima, Middletowu, Newark, Painesville,
Piqua, Portsmouth, Salem, Steubenville,
Tiffin, Wooster and Xenin.
lT The New York Herald speaking of the
President's message says: "It is a good
message clear; plain, not too long, and the
facts it sets forth are such as may make every
American justly pioud of his country and
happy that he belongs to it."
J3T8om6 two hundred manufactories
employing 10,000 people, will be moved from
the East to Pittsburgh the coming year, in
order to take advantage of the supply of
natural gas at that place for fuel and light
ing purposes. It is estimated that one-t'ourth
or more will be saved in expenses by using
natural gas instead of coal.
k large beer brewer of Louisville, Ky.,
has a Strasburg clock of more than ordinary
excellence. The clock is like ordinary clocks,
until just before the hour, when a little man
jumps, up from behind, with a lager beer
glosBin bis hand. This he elevates to his
head and then says, in a wonderfully distinct
and human way, "Lager beer," as many
times as the clock should strike to designate
the hour.

-5?The following well-known men of
Toledo have signed Collector Johnson's
bond: E. D. Potter, Jr., Robt. Cummings,
William Cummings, Ed. Malone, Dr, W. W.
Jones. The bond is for $100,000.
l-ir Mr. John Reade has a very interesting
article in the January number of The Popu
lar Scienct Monthly on ''The Intermingling
of Races," in which he shows that crossing is
a general, an almost universal phenomenon
in human history, that has been going on for
thousands of years, and is still going on; and
that most of the existing races of men are, to
a greater or less extent, results of it.
3?" Since tax paying time has commenced
a large number of our subscribers have taken
tho occasion to call in and square up old
accounts and renew their subscriptions. In
addition to these many new subscribers have
enrolled their names upon our books, be
coming convinced that it don't pay to be
without their county paper. We thank these
friends for their remembrance of the print
er, aud we hope that others may emulate
their example.
J55? The Legislative Committeo selectsd
last winter to write a new set of rules for
governing the House, is reported as complet
ing their work. The committee has increased
the number of rules from seventy to ninety
seven. Many changes have been made in the
existing rules, although but few of a radical
nature. Many rules which had become such
by custom only, and which, at times, caused
much discussion, have been incorporated in
the proposed rules, thus making them clear
beyond a doubt.
ligP Our attention has been called again to
the vast amount of manufactured stuff that
is being put upon the market by the Peni
tentiary contractors. The disastrous charac
ter of the competition between convict and
free labor becomes more apparent every day.
And we therefore feel justified in again urg
ing our suggestion with reference . to the
lessening of this competition by the reduc
tion of the number of convicts employed in
any one line of industry. In the limitation
of the number of prisoners in any one line
of manufacture to such a number as will not
bring about any appreciable or serious com
petition with free labor in that same line we
see the only solution of this momentous
problem. Columbus Dispatch.
Had the law which a Democratic Legisla
ture enacted been kept in force by the Re
publicans when they came into power, the
people of the State would have been far bet
ter off, even if the Penitentiary would not
have been selfsustaining under its provisions.
The Democratic party is the true friend of
labor. The Republican party is continually
legislating in the interests of capital and
monopoly.
J3" The expenses of keeping up the canals
of Ohio was mpre than their income the past
year, and this fact will probably be URcd
a;nin as an argument for their abandonment.
It is undoubtedly true that a portion of the
canal system of Ohio is unfirofl table and cf
no further account to the State or people, but
the Legislature should carefully guard the
interests of the productive portions. The up
per end of the Ohio canal is valuable and the
Miami & Erie has been and is of great service
to the western tier of Ohio counties es
pecially is this true from St. Mary's reser
voir south to Cincinnati. The Miami St, Erie
canal never failed to be self-supporting. The
fact that the canal counties of the State,
though few in number, pays more than one
half the taxes of the State, is good argument
for their maintenance. The water ways of
Ohio are valuable and should not be aban
doned. Toledo Bee.
J3f The Cincinnati Enquirer, a few days
since, published a sensational article stating
that the sixteen Democratic members of the
Senate will absent themselves from the ap
proaching session in consequence of the
revolutionary performances of the Republi
cans lust winterfivhom they propose leavii g
alone, so the story goes, to shape matters to
suit themselves, as they will do in any evur,
and make them wholly responsible for tl e
legislation of the session. It is to bo hoped,
at least for the sake of the Democratic party,
that these sixteen gentlemen will refia-n
from doing anything so utterly pueril as this.
No good can possibly result from it, while
much harm would. They were elected to re
present the interests of as many constituen
cies which would necessarily be entirely un
represented, and consequently neglected,
should tho proposed oourse of action be pur
sued. But we place no confidence in the
rumor, but believe when the Legislature
meets on the 4th of January the Democratic
Senators will be in their seats. Senator
Groschner is already shaping his business
matters to be present at the opening of the
Legislature.
TZg" The Dabney case lias finally reached
the proportions of n national joke. A young
man of strict integrity, admirable habits and
unquestioned professional ability was given
an appointment as Pension Examiner, with
a trifling little salary. At once tho Republi
can organs discovered that he had been a
guard at Andersonville Prison; that he had
kept watch on the "dead line;" that he had,
with his own hand, shot Union soldiers; and in
short, that he was personally responsible for
all of the horrors attaching, and inevitably
attaching, to a war prison in a community
which can not even feed its soldiers in the field.
In this connection the aforesaid organs avail
ad themselves for this grand opportunity to
disinter the Bloody Shirt from the grave in
which it had so long rotted. They waved it
with "ghoulish" glee. They printed whole
pages of Andersonville history. They indig
nated and they resoluted, and they raised
Sheol generally, and now it appears that poor
Tinlmev was born in 1600; that he was only
fourteen years old when the war ended; that
he never was in any war ol any kind; that be
never was at Andersonville in this life, and
not in any other that he knows of; and that
he is, altogether, a pretty good sort of a fel
low. It is a very funny history. A'noii irer.

About Time.
The creditors of the late firm of Sheffield &
Norton dispairing of receiving any honest
treatment from those now interested with the
management ( ?) of affairs, have filed a mo
tion for the removal of Mrs. Sheffield as ad
ministratrix of the estate of her deceased
husband. The propriety of this application
is to ns, and will be to all intelligent people,
very apparent and the action of the Probate
Judgo will no doubt be looked forward to
with very great anxiety and interest Mrs.
Sheffield was appointed administratrix some
three years age and, though the assets were
sufficient to meet at least 75 per cent, of the
liabilities, the creditors have received but 2."
per cent, of their claims. For this negligence
and delay there can be no reasonable ercu.-e.
That there has been gross mismanagement,
not to say fraud and dishonesty, must from
this state of facts necessarily be presumed,
but we do not believe Judge Meekison
is in any . way to blame. His conduct has
always been that of an upright and able
judge, and we do not know of a person to
whom he ever denied justice. Mrs. Sheffield
made application for appointment and as
there were no objections raised by interested
parties. Judge Meekison issued an order to
that effect. That the administratrix, through
incompetency or otherwise, has abused the
trust reposed in her, there can be no possible
doubt, and the creditors convinced that Mrs.
Sheffield is not the proper person to be longer
continued in that position, has made appli
cation for her removal. Justice will do done
the creditors and we have no doubt bat that
their motion will be sustained.
Not a Harvest.
A well posted Indiana editor, after reciting
the losses a newspaper sustains through
activity in politics, says very accuiately:
Is it any wonder, under such circumstances,
that the impression that prevails that a poli
tical campaign is "a harvest" for the pub
lisher of a newspaper, becomes almost offen
sive when expressed in the presence of one
who knows the facts to be so entirely dif
ferent? This loss of patronage, brought
about, it must be remembered, in fighting
for the party to which the journal belongs, is
often almost invariably, indeed greater
than the amount of work performed and paid
for by the party during a campaign. Besides
this class of work must of necessity be done
as soon as ordered. No matter what im
portant job may be on the presses at the
time, nor how valuable it may be to the pub
lisher, it must be laid aside at once, and the
political work attended to. The day is fixed
for a political meeting, and the speaker's
name at hand; consequently the chairman of
the central committee must have it announc
ed. The day and date will not wait the print
er's convenience. It is imperative that the
work must be done, and at once. Many
times in years past have we lost good paying
cash jobs for the reason that the political
printing must be done, and that of private
parties deferred for a time, at least. We refer
to these things in order todisabuse the minds
of those who refer to a political campaign
as a "printer's harvest." The facts are
that when his labor for the party is taken
into consideration; the losses of patronage
he invariably sustains, brought about by
fearlessly and emphatically asserting his
views on public questions, and many othor
things that could be mentioned, the publisher
of a political country journal is the poorest
paid man for the amount of labor done, of
any other "on the foot-stool."
It is for these reasons, then, that the better
informed people of the country should sus
tain the publisher of the home paper more
unanimously than they have done. The
public should bear in mind that his work for
his party never ceases, but, like Tennyson's
river, it "goes on, and on forever." An elec
tion is scarcely held before he has donned
the harress for the next campaign, and it is
for this unceasing work work done when all
others voters, speakers and public men are
taking a rest, that he should be remembered;
his services acknowledged, his labor paid for
by a generous patronage from those in whose
interest he has toiled. Especially should the
successful candidate if a member of his
party bear his labors in mind. To con
clude, we may add that there is no "harvest"
for the publisher of a country political
journal, save in the consciousness of labor
well performed.
I3T The profits realized upon American
manufactured products tell the story of the
oppression both of productive and consump
tive labor. The Government protects manu
facturing capital in demanding a profit
averaging 40 per cent, upon the products of
the labor it employs, to start on; after this
thera are cumulative profits which bring up
the prices of said products to double or thrib
ble the sum paid to the labor that produces
them. Now, if these products are really
worth what consumptive labor must pay for
them, it follows that the labor which produc
ed them has been defauded of its just dues.
On the other hand, if these products are not
worth the prices which consumers must pay
for them, then it follows that consumptive
labor is imposed upon and oppressed. The
question which arises out of this condition of
things is, why should capital be aided by the
protective policy of the Government, in the
gross injustice of realizing from one hun
dred t three hundrad per cent, of profit upon
the creations of productive labor, at the ex
penso of consumptive labor? And while
universal labor is thus compelled to pay
$1.50 for what is in fact only worth from 50
cents to 75 cents, we hear the pitiful com
plaint of capital that the American silver
dollar is only worth 79 cents! This com
plaint, unlike that we file for labor in this
article, is not warranted by the facts in the
case. The said silver dollar, by the highest
authority on the faceof the earth (tho Consti
tution of the United States of America,) is
guaranteed to be of the value of one hundred
cents, and to be the equal of the gold dollar
in all transactions of business and trade, and
for all money obligations whatsoever. It is
therefore as honest a dollar as ever was coin
nil, while the protective tariff system, which
protects capital and oppresses labor, and
which is palmed upon the country in the
name of protection to industry, is the most
gigantio scheme of dishonesty ever devised
by the greea Ol man. acujonmine nxamm

The ahadra of night cam drooping down,
And wrapped in darkness nil the town;
No ray of Hi;hl tar here and then
The gllm'rinz of om distant star ;
Or streaming ont upon the night
Beam from some muac-wireacandla light.
Such was Iba night and aacu the Unia,
When donkey four marched In a line;
Four donkey wise beyond a doubt.
Moving apace with but one thought,
They toward the town hall bent their way.
To meet the foe in stcarn array,
Heeolved lo SL'hl 'gainst temp'rancc laws,
Aud win the day for whiskey 'a mire.
Aud when they reached this place uf meeting
And gave to all accustomed greeting,
They alt them down, each face t face,
Locked their long eara In fond embrace,
And poured Into each others ear
Their notea prolonged terrific clear;
While those without who beard the aound,
And felt tta thuudir ahake the ground,
Remembered Charleston's recent ahake,
And cried alas ! the earth dnth quake 1
At length the spokesman of the four
Stretched 111" Iocs limbs ald took the floor;
Oucc more the awful stillness broke,
Opened hi mouth andthua he apokc:
'Dear brother donkey, we are here
To put aside all shame or fear.
And act the part of donkeys still.
Who know full well their master's will.
The time una come wo cant dei yo
When we must atop this temperauce cry,
Or else whiskey hoscs will
Suffer defeat aud meet with ill.
And atearn misfortune's lowering frown
Will rest npon our little town ;
The grape wlthlu our atreeis will grow,
And trade to other towua will flow,
While we who like a glase of beer,
Or whiskey strong our hearts to cheer,
Must quench our thirst na we are told
With temperance people's water cold;
We know they voted two to one
Against the festive gay enloon.
But what care we for tho people's choice,
Or what care we for the people' voice ;
The people's voire ia the voice of Qod,
But we obey King Whiskey's nod.
Prince Tyro, too, who wellils the listi,
And for the Northwest mixes hash;
Who ia no crazy temperance crank ;
Ile'U sink his rowel in our flank.
And make us jump aud snort with pain,
If we refuse to mine the rein.
Iu view of all these facts, I say,
There is now one, and but one way,
To beat all localoption laws,
And thus advance our masters cause;
As donkeys four we're fnily able
To lay this ordinance ou the table,
Where it may lay 'til crack of doom,
Or longer still if there is room.
We'll never take It up again."
The other three all snld amen.
And this Is how a I am told.
In times long past four donkeys bold,
Like heroes brave of great renow n,
From prohibition saved the town.

What True-Merit Will Do.
The unprecedented sale of Boschee's Ger
man Syrup within a few years, has astonish
ed the world. It is without doubt the safest
and best remedy ever discovered for the
speedy and effectual cure of Coughs, Colds
and the severest Lung troubles. It acts on
an entirely different principle from the usual
prescriptions given by Physicians, as it does
not dry up a Cough and leave the disease still
in the system, but on the contrary removes
the cause of the trouble, heals the parts
affected and leaves them in a purely healthy
condition. A bottle kept in the honse for
use when the diseases make their appear
ance, will save doctor's bills and a long spell
of serious illness. A trial will convince you
of these facts. It is positively sold by all
druggists and general dealers in the land.
