Washington, Dec. 7.?(Senate.)?The
first day of the second scss on of the
Fifty-fourth Congress presented no
remarkable fealuios. There were sev?
enty-one Senators In their scats und eigh?
teen absentees. The Pius dent's annual
message was read.
At first pretty close attention was paid
to the message by Senators?most of
them following the reading with pamph?
let copies of the message n their hands
Many of the stiong points appeared to
give general sal.sfarl.on, such, for In?
stance, as that on the subject of Arme?
nian ouiragi s?that the present sombre
prospect In Turkey would not be long
''permitted to otTend the sight of Christ?
endom." The Judic al siunin.ng up of the
Cuban question by the statement that
when the Inability of Spain to deal suc?
cessfully with the Insurgents has become
manifest, a situation will be presented <?
which our obligations to the sovereignty
of Spain will he superseded by higher ob?
ligat ons which We can hardly hesitate
to recognize und discharge, also seemed
oatlsfa.tory to both sides of the Cham-;
ber. Very little attention was paid
?er.atois to other portions of the message,
which had to do solely with Internal uf
fa is. The reading occupied one hour and
fifty minutes. The message was laid on
the table and the Senate at 3:3b adjourned
until lo-inorro\v.

Washington, D. c, Dec. 7.?The
message of the President, delivered to
Congress at noon to-duy. Is as follows:
To the Congress of the United States:!
As representatives of the people In the]
legislative branch of their Government,
you have assembled ut u time when the
strength and excellence of our free In- .
slituilons und the Illness of our citi- I
zens to enjoy popular rule have been i
again made man.test. A political con?
test, Involving momentous conse- \
quences, fraught with feverish- appre?
hension and t reating aggressiveness so I
intense as to approach bitterness and
passion, has been waged throughout our
land, and determined by the decree of
free and Indl pendent suffrage, without
disturbance of our trunqulllly or tho
least sign of weakness In our national
structure. When we consider these In?
cidents and contemplate the peaceful
obedience and manly submission which
have succeeded a heated clash of politi?
cal opinions, we discover abundant evi?
dence of a determination on the part of
our countrymen to abide by every ver?
dict of the poptdar will, and to be con?
trolled at all times by an abiding faith
In the agencies established for the di?
rection of the affairs of their Govern?
ment. t
Thus our1 peopleVxhlbTt a patriotic dis?
position which entitles them to demand
of those who undertake to make nnd
execute their laws such faithful anil un?
selfish service In their behalf as can
only be prompted by a serious apprecia?
tion of the trust and confidence which
the acceptance of public duty Invites.
In obedience to constitutional re?
quirements 1 herein submit to the Con?
gress certain Information concerning
national affairs, with the suggestion of
such legislation as. In my Judgment, Is
necessary and expedient. To secure
brevity and avoid tiresome narration I
shall omit many details concerning mat?
ters within Federal control, which,
though by no means unimportant, are
more profitably discussed In depart?
mental reports. 1 shall also further cur
tall this communication by omitting al
minute recital of many minor incidents
connected with our foreign relations
which have heretofore found a place In
executive messages, but are now con?
tained in a report of the Secretary of
State, which is herewith submitted.
AFFAIRS IN ARMENIA.
At the outset of a reference to the
more important matters affecting our
relations with foreign powers, it would
afford me satisfaction if 1 could assure
the Congress that the disturbed condi?
tion in Asiatic Turkey had during the
past year assumed a less hideous and
bloody aspect, and that either us a con?
sequence of the awakening of the Tur?
kish Government to (he demands of
humane civilization, or as the result of
decisive action on the part of the Great
Nations having the right by treaty to
Interfi re for the protection of those ex?
posed to the rage of the mad bigotry und
cruel fanaticism, the shocking features
of the situation had been mitigated. In?
stead, however, of welcoming a softened
disposition or protective Intervention
we have been afflicted by continued nn'i
not unfrequent reports of the wanton
destruction of homcB nnd the bl.ly
butchery of men. women and children,
made martyrs to their profession of
Christian faith.
While none of our citizens In Turkey
have thus far been killed or wotinde I,
though often In the midst of dreadful
scenes of danger, their safely In ih ? fu?
ture Is by no means assured. Our Gov?
ernment nt home and our Minister at
Constantinople have left nothing un?
done to protect our missionaries in the
ottoman territory,who constitute nearly
all the individuals residing there who
have a right to claim our protection on
the score of American citizenship. Our
efforts In this direction will not be re?
laxed, but the deep feeling and sym?
pathy that have been aroused among
our people ought not to so far blind
their reason and Judgment as to 1 ad
them to demand Impossible things. The
outbreaks of blind fury, which lead to
murder and pillage in Turkey, occur
suddenly and without notice, and an at?
tempt on our pitt't to force such a hos?
tile presence there us might be effec?
tive for prevention or protection would
not only be resisted by the Ottoman
Government, but would be regarded as
nn interruption of their plans by the
Great Nations win! assert their exclu?
sive right to Intervene In their own
time nnd method for the security of life
and property in Turkey.
Several naval vessels arc stationed In
the Mediterranean as a measure of cau?
tion nnd to furnish all possible relief
and refuse in case of emergency.
I do not believe thai the present som?
ber prospect in Turkey will be long per?
mitted to offend the sight of Christen?
dom. It so mars the humane and en?
lightened civilization Hint belongs la the
I close of fhe nineteenth century that It
I seems hnrd'.y possible that the earnest
demand of good people throughout Luc
Christian world for its corrective treat?
ment will remain unanswered.
PERPl-dCXING CUBA.
The insurrection In Cuba still con
ilnucs with all Us perplexities. H Is
dinictllt to perceive thul any progress
lias thus far been made towards the
pacification of the Island or that the
situation of affairs, as depicted In my
last annual message, has In the least
improved. If Spain still holds Havana
and the seaports und all the considera?
ble towns the Insurgents still roam a;
I will over nt least tWO-iihlrda of the In-'
land country. If the determination of
Spain to put down the insurrection
seems but to strengthen with the lapse
of time, nnd Is evinced by her unhesi?
tating devotion of largely Increased mili?
tary and naval forces to the task, there
Is much reason to believe that the in?
surgents have gained In point of num?
bers and character and resources, nnd
I none the less indexible In their resolve
not to succumb, without practically se
i cumg the great objects for which they
took up arms. If Spain has not yet
re-established her authority, neither
have the Insurgents ^yot made good
-their title to be regarded as an Indepen?
dent state. )
A N.A RCH Y'lB i ? ;bt*NANT.
Indeed, as the contest has gone on,
the pretense that civil government ex?
ists on the Island, except so fur us
Spain is able to maintain it, has been
practically abandoned. Spain does
keep on foot such a Government, more
or less Imperfectly, In the large towns
and their immediate suburbs, but that
exception being made, the entire coun?
try Is either given over to anarehy or Is
subject to the military occupation of
one or the other party. It Is reported,
indeed, on reliable authority that at the
demand of the commander-ln-chlef of
the insurgent army, the putative Cuban
Government has now given up all at?
tempt to exercise its functions, leaving
that Government confessedly (what
there is the best reason for supposing
it always tu have been in fact) a Gov?
ernment merely on paper, were the
Spanish armies able to meet their an?
tagonists in the open, or In pitched bai?
lie, prompt "and decisive results might
be looked for, and the Immense super?
iority of the Spanish fore s in numbers,
?discipline and equipment could hardly
fall to tell greatly to their advantage.
Bul they are called upon to force a foe
that shuns general engagements, that
can choose and does choose its own
ground, that from Ihe nature of the
country Is visible or invisible at pleas?
ure, and that lights only from anibus
cade and when all tin- advantages of
position and numbers are on its side.
In a country where all thai is indis?
pensable, especially by those born and
bred on the soil, it is obvious that there
is hardly a limit to the time during
which hostilities of this sort may be
prolonged. Meanwhile, as in all eases
of protracted civil strife, the passions
Of the combatants grow more and more
inflamed on I excesses on both sides be?
come more frequent and more deplora?
ble.
They are also participated In by bands
of marauders, who. now in the nami of
one party and now In the name of the
other, as may 1 est suit the occasion,
harry the country at will and plunder
Its wretched Inhabitants for their own
advantage. Such a condition of things
would Inevitably entail Immense de?
struction of property, even If ii were
the policy of both parties t<> prevent it
as far ns practicable. Itnt while such
seemed to be the original policy of the
Spanish Government it has now appar?
ently abandoned It. and is acting up >n
the same theory as the insurgents,
namely, that the < xlgenclcs of the con?
test require the wholesale annihilation
of property, that !t may not prove of
use und advantage to tho enemy.
UTTER DESTRUCTION.
It Ls to the same end that in pursuance
of general orders Spanish garrisons arc
now being withdrawn from plantations
and the rural population required to!
concentrate Itself in the towns. The
.sure result would Bei in I i I." thit the in?
dustrial value of tin liland i.s fast dlmln
Ishing, and that unless there Is a speedy
and radle .1 change in exlstli g c nd tions
it will soon disappear altogether. That
value consists very largely, of course,
In Its ca pi city to produce sugar?a ca?
pacity already much reduced by the in?
terruptions to tillage, which have taken
place during tin- last two year?. It Is
reliably asserted that should these In?
terruptions conti;.uc dining the current I
year and practlcillj extend, as i- now
th cati ned, lo the et tire sugar produi !ng
territory of the island, so much lime
and so much m ney Will be required to
restore the land to its normal produc?
tiveness that It is extremely doubtful
If capital can be Induce.I to even make
the attempt.
Tin- spectacle of the utter ruin of an
adjoining country, by nature one of the
most fertile and cifuiuing on the globe, I
would engage the serious attention of the
government ami people of the United
stairs in any circumstance*. In point
of fact, they have a concern with It
which Is by no me ins of a wholly senti?
mental or philanthropio character. it
lie - go near to us u.s to be hardly H''|Sarn
Icd from our teriltory. Our actual pe?
cuniary Interests In It is second only to
that of the people and government of
Spain. It Is reasonably estimated that
at leist from 130,000,000 to $50,01)0,000 of
American caoiital are Invested In plan?
tations and In railroad, mining, and
other business enterprises on .the Island. I
The volume of 11 ado between the United
States and Cuba, which In 1889amounted
to about ?Gi.ono.O?O. lose In 189.1 to about
1103,000,000 and In IK'.H, the year before
the present Insurrenctlon broke out,
amounted .to nearly jim.ooo.uoo. Besides
this large pecuniary stake in the for?
tunes of Cuba, the United States finds
Itself Inextricably Involved In tho pres?
ent contest In other ways both vexatious
and costly.
FlumuSTEItlNO EXPEDITIONS.
Many Cubans reside in this country
and Indirectly support the Insurrection
through the preis, by public meetings,
by the purchase and shipment of arms,
by the raising of funds, and by oilier
means, which the spirit of our Institu?
tions and the tenor of our laws do not
permit to be made the subject of crimi?
nal prosecutions. Koine of them, though
Cubans at heart and In all their feelings
and Interests, have taken out papers as
naturalized citizens of the United States
?a proceeding resorted to with a view
to possible protection by this govern?
ment and not unnaturally regarded with
much Indignation by the country of their
origin. They are undoubtedly encour?
aged and supported by the widespread
sympathy the people of this country al?
ways and Instinctively feel for every
struggle for better and freer govern?
ment, and which, In the case of (he moie
adventurous and restless elements of
our population, leads In only too many
Instances to active and personal partici?
pation in the contest. The result Is
thai this government Is constantly called
upon to protect American citizens, to
claim damages for Injuries to persons
and property, now estimated at many
millions of dollars, and to ask explana?
tions and apologies for the acts of Span?
ish otlici.il-. whose zeal for the repression
of rebellion sometime? blinds them to
the Immunities belonging to the unof
fendlng citizens of a friendly power. It
f Hows from the .same causes that the
United States Is compelled to actively
police a long line of sea coast against
unlawful expdltlons, the escape I f w hich
tin- utmost vigilance will not always
suffice tf> prevent. These Inevitable en?
tanglements of the United States with
the rebellion In Cuba, the large Ameri?
can property Interests affected, and con?
siderations of philanthropy and unani?
mity in general have led to a vehement
demand in various quarters, for some
,f poMtlvc Intervention on the part
of the United States.
SEVERAL PROPOSITIONS.
It was at first proposed that bellige?
rent, rights should be accorded to the
Insurgents?a proposition no longer
urged because untimely and In practical
operation clearly perilous and injurious
t. our Interests. It has since been and
i- now sometime.* contended that the In?
dependence of the Insurgents should be
recDgnlzed. But Imperfect and resttlot
cd a- the Spanish government of the is?
land may be, no other exists there un?
less the will of the military officer In
!? mp ?rary command of n particular dis?
trict can be digndllcd as a species of
government.
It Is now also suggested that the
United States should buy the Island?a
suggestion possibly worthy of conslde
atlon if there were any evidence of a
ii. ulre or willingness on the part of Spain
to entertain such a proposal.
It la urged finally that, all ether meth?
ods failing, the existing internecine
strife In Cuba should be terminated by
our Intervention, even at the cost of a
war between the United States and
Spain?a war which it.* advocates oonfl
l mtly prophesy could he neither large
in Its proportions nor doubtful In Its
i.-- -:ue.
WE DO NOT WANT WAR.
The correctness of this forecast need
be neither affirmed nor denied. The
United States has. nevertheless, a char?
acter to maintain as a nation which
plainly dictate- that tight and not
might should be the rub- of it? conduct.
Further, though the United Siato.i Is not
a nation to which peace a necessity.
It I" In truth the most pacific of powers,
and desires nothing SO much as to live
In amity With all ihe world. Its own
ample and diversified domains satisfy all
p iss'.blo longings for territory, preclude
all dream' of conque?t, and prevent any
Casting of covAtOUS eyes upon neighbor?
ing regions, however attractive. That

lynched with the others. The probabili?
ties arc iliai vengeance will be meted
out to him later. The mob was com?
posed of 'J'iO men. nil unmasked.
THE JAILER OVERPOWERED.
They overpowered the Jailer anil bis
guards and demanded the keys to the
cell in which Nelson and Winner were
locked, but were refused. The doors
were then battered down and the pris?
oners tied and led out. The loader; of
the mob was asked where he was going
to hang them, und he said that they
were going to Rny county, so that La?
fayette would not have to bear the ex?
panse of-burying them; ..?>-? - -?
Winner came out trembling with
fear. Nelson said not a word, but clear?
ly showed that In* was not afraid.
Until men plead with the mob for their
lives and asserted their Innocence.
BWORE THEIR INNOCENCE.
'?.Standing before Almighty Clod I
swear I never murdered my wife," said
Winner. .
"I swear I'm Innocent," added Nelson,
but the mob paid no attention to the
pleadings.
Several attempts were made to lynch
Winner ami Lackey while they were In
Jail at Richmond, which led to their
removal here for safe keeping. Nelson
tins been in Jail hen: ever since Satur?
day, having been arrested on the
strength of a confession made by Miss
Maggie Katron, who made a sworn
statement that she, winner. Lackey and
Nelson committed the murder.
The mob crossed tin- river, coming
over ut 11 o'clock in skiffs. At 1 ::i0 they
recroused with the prisoners and hanged
them to a tree.
NO MASKS WERE WORN.
The mob made no effort to conceal the
ide.n1ity of its members, and many of
them could he easily recognised. The
overcoat worn by the leader Is In pos?
session of one of (he deputies. The ma?
jority of tin: mob were young men.
It Is said here that it was the Inten?
tion of lhe mob to burn Nelson nnd
Winni e. Winner admitted to a prisoner
in the Jail bust night that he was guilty.
The bodies were found this morning
half a mile from the river In Ray coun?
ty, hanging to an oak tree
Hundreds of people are Hocking to the
scene of the lynching to view the dead
bodies.
W1 I.I, PUNISH LYNCHERS.
Prosecuting Attorney William Aull
says: "I have evidence suillclent to
Identify some of 'the members of the
mob and have the names of many
others, also property belonging to some
of them. If It Is the lust act of my
life I expect to bring the perpetrator:!
to Justice."
VICTIM Ol' (' I <? A It KT T KS.
t'linrlen Arthur IttllHcilfl Mow tlrcnnso
?lotlie Wouldn't Marry Him.
Charles Arthur was arrested last night
by Oflleer Welt on the charge of raising
a disturbance in the house of Dottle
Sinclair. It will be recalled that several
days ago, last Sunday night a week.
In fact. Arthur procured from Deputy
clerk Colcman at midnight a license to
wed Dottle. It appears, however, that
the female end of the bargain was not a
go, as Dottle refused to be wed This
was what cured the disturbance.
Arthur, when IbrougiTt to the station
house, had several violent spasms and
was placed under the treatment of Dr.
Hehank. It seems that the man smokes
from flvi> to ?lx packs of cigarettes dal?
ly, and It U believed that this* habit Is
more or less responsible for his present
plight.

Mr. Fulford had just closed up his

mime $300 from hl? coih register, and
placed It In his pocket. This action waa
evidently seen by Home on the outside,
for when M?-ssrs. Fulford and Anderson
started out they were approached at Ute
Un,on ?treet corner by a tramp, who '"
asked If he could get a night's lodging
upon being refused he struck Mr. Ful- .
ford under the chin, knocking him '
down, while his confederate, who sud> '

knocked Mr. Anderson down. Mr. W.
