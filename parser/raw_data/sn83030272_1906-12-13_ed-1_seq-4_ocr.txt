WASHINGTON Dec 12 Senator RaynerMaryland
of Maryland addressed tho Senate today
in sUp ort of the resolution he recentlyntroducnl
Introduced expressing the opinion that thefederal
federal Government had no right to Interfere
fare in the Japanese school question inalifomia
California and that it was the duty of theresident
resident to no notify the Japanese Government
nentIlia
Ills arguments were directed principallyigainst
against the power of the President underho
the Constitution to interfere with the schoolystein
system of tho States to control which Mrlayner
layner asserted was one of the rigliti notlelegatetl Idelljnll1
lelegatetl to the general Government byhe
the States and to show that there was noprovision
provision in tho treaty with Japan Rivinglie

Tho lresldent Mr Rayner said haditntcd
stated in Ids message that tim Federaljovcrunient

in the resolution and that everythingitlJn
itlJn his power shall be done and all ofhe
the forms military and civil of the Uniteditatea
StAtes which ho may lawfully employ willw
00 employed for that purposoIt
It is very important therefore that wohould
should know and Limo country shouldnow
know and the 1ieslUeut should understand
stand whether he has any power in thorenii
prcmiell at all b > causo it Is quite a seiioiwnatter
mailer in view of tho great calamity thatiaa
has lately befallen the city of San Francisco
for tho President to contemplate the bomxirding
xirding of thJ city nt this time and toIcclaro
declare war against tho board of countychool
chool trustees of California if there Is noUHtillcatiun
UHtillcatiun or pretext upon which sucherociourt
erociourt proceeding can bo undti takenThe
The President is exercising a great manyunctions
unctions executive leRiulatlve and Judiial
clnl lawful and unlawful constitutionalind
ind unconstitutional If he is possessedif
of tho idea that he itt the supervisor of allit
it the public schools of the various StatiSHf
of the United States nnd he seems to bempressed
Impressed with this idoa because in thoery
very last paragraph of viis message her
Commends to Congress tho establishment
of hooting callorit in nil of tho largenitlio
public school of the country wo rnutrtlisnbuse
lisnbuse his mind of thin fancy or wo mutet
let him know that wo agree with him as tohe
the omnipotence of his jurisdiction
If ho can take possession of tho publiochools
chools of California and compel the Stateo
to admit to them Japanese students contraryo
to the laws of California he could with equalroprietv
propriety send us an amendment to thoianto
Santo Domingo treaty and demand theidniiaston
idniiaston of tho negro children of Santo3omingo
3omingo into the white tcbool of SouthCarolina
i Carolina o of any other State of the Union
Of course if the come to
conclusion that everything that the President Ident
I dent recommends is right then there isI I
I hardly any lee In contesting any of hisiropnsitlom
I propositions and Instead of conferring uponI
I him the power to give Congress InC rmation
of the state of the Union we mIght conferupon
I upon him the function of furnishing hutown
own peculiar views upon the entire stateof
of the universe and recommending anyImprovements
Improvements or changes In the generalplan
plan of creation that he may deem expedient
ent from the cradle to the graveIn
In fact the President upon pag > twentvnine
nine of hUTnessage anticipates the cradleand
and make a recommendation upon theMat

hands the establishment of the bith rate ofthe
the country Now if we can only supplement
ment this function by giving him coniplstoJurisidjlction
Jurisidjlction over the death rate we will thenhave
have a ruler whose ubiquity IsuncircumRented
Rented and whose unlimited possibilities arebeyond
beyond the reach of human contemplationI
I believe that there Is fufflcient residuumof
of common sense and Independent thoughtin
in the American people to keep the Executive
tive within the prerogatives of his officeand
and to tell him quietly and respectfully tounderstand
understand that the executive chair is notexactly
exactly the place from which to deliverexhortations
