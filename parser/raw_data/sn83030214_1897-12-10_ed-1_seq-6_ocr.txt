mm A PLATT EXCUSE.
W Mr. Platt Is hard put to It to excuse himself
to Republican voters up the State for turning
over the government of this olty to Tammany.
He lias been driven to profess Lis willingness to
have co op-ratcd with Independents, and his ua
f-i-rtiou is met with the record that hs enrly us
April 18 Mr. Lanterbach declared for a Tam?
many Mayor in preference to a non-partisan
Mayor, and Mr. Platt followed this up on May 8
with sneers at all reformers and notice that "the
'?Republican vote is not to be enlisted in any
"more non-partisan enterprises." He has been
driven to say that the vote up the State was
entirely satisfactory, nnd the falsity of this; as?
sertion is proved by the fact that the tip-State
plurality for .Indice Wnllace ?u 101,631 smaller
than that given to Governor Black, and 5&S68
|ggg than t?nt given to General Palmer In 1S?C.
He Is also driven to claim that his opposition
to Mr. Low was based on a desire to preserve
the Republican pnrty, and to spread the notion
that Mr. Ix>w, as Mayor of Brooklyn, worked ill
to the party. In his post-election Interview he
said: "There Is one calamity worse than the
"success of the Democratic party In the city of
"New-York, and that Is Its success In the State
"and Nation. Mr. Low, as Mayor of Brooklyn,
"had already defeated one candidate for Presl
"dent. He did It by destroying the Republican
"organization, no less than by his personal
"treachery to the candidate."
In view of that statement?all of it mislead?
ing and part of It false?It Is Interesting to see
what the election returns show of Mr. Low's In?
fluence on the fortunes of the party at large.
In 18S0 General Hancock carried Brooklyn for
the Democrats by S,2<!7 plurality. In 18S1 Mr.
Low carried It for the Republicans by 4,3r>4, and
drew enough independent Democrats to the sup?
port of the rest of the ticket to cut down the
Democratic plurality for Secretary of State to
If??. The next year Mr. Ix)w worked, voted and
contributed money for Folgcr. Cleveland car
r.ed Brooklyn by about ?T7.ih.i0, but that was due
to the tidal wave which swept the whole coun?
try, elected Ben Butler In Massachusetts and
defeated Folgcr by 19_,006. Mr. b\v had no
more to do with that than did Mr. liait, who
was Just then in deep retirement Tn 1SS.1 Mr.
Low was re-elected by 1,909 plurality, and in?
stead of his candidnoy breaking np tho pnrty it
left the party strong enough to carry Broostyn
for General Carr at the same election by I.SflK?.
The next year Mr. Blalne lost Brooklyn by
6'itue 14.IMNI. That was due to a great party
revolt, which v as not confined to Brooklyn or
to New-York State. Mr. l*iw voted for Blalne,
and when Mr. Clntt was driven to chanto him
with "personal treachery" in that campaign lie
told what Is simply and plainly a lie, which had
been time and again refuted before he uttered
!r. Mr. I>ow, when running the year before, had
pledged himself not to use the influence of the
Mayor's office to help any candidates, and he
simply kept his word like nn honest man. In
ItSSS the Democrats carried Brooklyn for Hill by
about 8.000. and elected Whitney Mayor. The
latter calamity was due entirely to the machine
Republicans, who might have secured a non
psrt'.san Mayor and gained many Democratic
votes for Davenport, Just as Platt this year
might have elected Low and gained thousands
of supporters for Wallace and his county tickets.
Instead of continuing non-partisan city govern?
ment, the machine men antagonized the Inde?
pendents, refused to name a candidate to nuit
?hem, put up Mr. Sohroedor. who refused to
run and said he fuvored combination on Gen?
eral Woodward, nnd then substituted General
Catlln?since a prominent McLaughlin Demo?
crat?rather than follow Mr. Xehroeder's advice.
The result was that they threw the election to
Whitney, who bad leas vote? than tho Hepub
IWn ?nd Independent candidates, and Injured
the rest of the ticket.
These figures show that another of Mr. Plan's
i oxr-uses for defeating; the Republican party was
ntterlv frivolous and founded on false statc
mente. Mr. Tlatt must hare been hard up for
? n defence when he was driven to misstate flf
i tron yeir old events. If the statements were
true they would not make his leadership appear
less tanging. As It I?, they only make it np
nr-ar more desperate.
I
RIVERS AND HARBORS.
The i'risidciit's timely recommendation p
economy In appropriations, in order Hint th
(ioYiTiiiiienfs expenditures may be kept wlthii
its roccipts, was well placed nt the end of hi
Message to Congress, where it has the force o
a final appeal to patriotic prudence. It is gratl
fying to learn that Influential members of tin
House are In sympathy with the spirit of th?
President's ndvicc, ami In considering how tin
probable resources of the t.overnment can h?
most wisely applied to meet its requirement)
have already uiven approval to the suggestlor
that an Important saving can he effected ii
river nnd harbor Improvements without risk o)
serious harm. The estimates for the ilscnl yeai
ending June ,"i0, IHHO, Include under the head ol
public works nn outlay of about $4.i,000,<mx
on rivers and harbors The magnitude of tbll
siim is perhaps sufficiently striking without
comparisons; but It Is at least interesting to re
call, as an example of the facility with which
public expenditures grow, Ihnt the River and
Harbor bill which Prf-sldcnf Arthur vetoed In
1-^2, thereby performing the most conspicuous
rnd perhaps In general estimation the most
creditable act of his Administration, called for
only $lft,743,S7r., or less than two-fifths of the
huge total which Is contemplated in the esti?
mates for the next fiscal year.
The proposnl which Is attracting favorable
attention among leading RepKOentatlYe* Is
that nothing shall be appropriated for rivers
and harbors at tMs session beyond the amount
required to meet existing contracts for improve?
ments already authorized nnd under way. It
appears to as* that this is a reasonable curtail?
ment which It should be the aim of Congress to
achieve. It is true that such a restriction mlcht
exchnie some deserving objecta, but. on tin?
other hand, to open the door to exceptions, ex?
cept in cases of absolute nnd obvious necessity,
would be pretty sure to aggravate the evil of
log-rolling, and In th" end spoil the plan of
ecouomy. A brief liait in the progress of river
and harbor development could not do much
harm, while It Is probable that the balance of
advantngo would be Inrge, without regard to
the condition of the National Treasury.
But that Is a consideration which cannot be
Ignored with safety or honor. Concress is
bound to act In accordance nor with It? under?
standing of what various localities would like
to have, but with Its best Judgment of what the
country Is able to pay for. I'rompt execution
of work already begun and exact fulfilment of
contracts are likely to be profitable in the out?
come as well as creditable; but new projects
of Improvement ought lo be examined with
Rcmpulous care nnd with n firm purpose to post?
pone them In every possible Instance to a more
convenient seas?in.
A TOUCHING TALE.
Our distressed conten?pornt y "The New-York
Sun" has seldom published a more pathetic
narrative thnn that which appeared In its
Thursday's Issue over the signature of Franklin
Rartlett. Mr. Rartlett Is not only a stockholder
In "The Sun." but one of Its most favored con?
tributors. For him It violates one of Us most
cherished tindltloiis. The blue pencil of con?
densation Is never applied to his literary or
oratorical effort* His apeachea when a mem?
ber of Congress were Invariably printed with
stenographic fuln??ss In "The Sun." Moreover.
It lias always been understood that fondness for
Mr. Rartlett and resentment of GrOYet Cleve?
land's refusal to appoint him on his military
start' when (?overiK-r were at the bottom of cur
contemporary's bitt?T and Implacable bostllltj
t?> that gentleman during the whole of his sub?
sequent career. It was doubtless partly because
of its fondness for the writer ?nd partly be
ciuisi? it was a recital of lta own woes thnt this
story, five columns long, was printed In full,
with gnat amplitude of detail nnd what would
seem to the eavraal reader many unnecessary
repetitions of legal verbiage. To jktshiik In?
terested In the story It Is an Interest lng story.
though it must be admitted that to the arerage
reader Its Interest chiefly lies In the fact that
It is the reverse of a story without words, being
words without a story.
Th?? story is In the form of two "complaints"
drawn by Mr. Rartlett, who Is also "solicitor for
the complalunnt." fJne of the?e complaints re?
cites that a considerable Dumber of persons
scattered all over the country from Mn?-sa<hu
setts to California, and organized ander the
name of the Associated Press, have "combined
"and conspired bit ween and nmong ihemselves
"and othc-s" "to deprive the plaintiff of Its
"right to sell its news to the public In the open
"market." The painful details of this con?
spiracy are set forth to the ?-xtent of three col?
umns. The names ?>f newspapers In various
parts of the country which were willing to help
"The Sun" along by buying what It calls "Its
news'* at fixed and remunerative prices are
given. Ruf th? narrative goes <m t?. say that
the conspirators, actuated by "spite ami malig?
nity," force?l ami compelled these newspapers
not to buy "news" ?if "The Sun." By this blgh
handed proceeding Mr. Rartlett says "The Sun"
has been damaged In Its business and Its prop?
erty "In the sum of many thousand dollars,"
and he accordingly asks the United Stales Clr
rult Court for this ?llstrict to Interpose in Its
behalf and enjoin these consplnitors from pre?
venting the sale of "its news'" to the newspa?
pers named. The scond complaint Is two col
umns loni/. und Is taken up with a harrowing
recital of the same offences in slightly different
form, but charging the conspirators with viola?
tion of the law of Congress against tlttsts, This
story tells how much Mr. Rartlett thinks "The
Sun" has Ix-en dumuged up to ?late by the wide,
spread nnd powerful conspiracy to prevent Its
I selling "its news." As compensation therefor
he asks the Circuit Court to grant Judgment
agalaot the conspirators for a litth? matter of
?1.2.VIKX).
It Is all very pathetic. It h;is been known
for soni?' time that "The Suns'- desertion of
! Tammany and enlistment In the servi??? of
Platt last year, followed as It was by the se?
cession from the Republican organization of
thousands of Republicans who could not stom
' ach the arrogance of the Ross or the alternate
i bullying and patronizing manners of his new
j organ, hail turned out to be a disastrous blun?
der. It was nlao known that the role of Ish
maelite which "The Sun" was playing against
every newspaper In this city and nearly nil
the respectable journals in the country had
i arrayed the press of the country almost solidly
against It. In addition to this "Its news" for
which It sought a sale ha?l become utterly un?
trustworthy and worthless. So the disclosure
of financial distress by Mr. Rartlett Is not a
surprise. That it should attempt to recoup It?
self from the treasuries of the newspapers
throughout ihe country which will not buy "its
news" Is a trifle ludicrous. So, also. Is Its re?
sort to the law against trusts, which it has
always derided, ns t m?-nns f?ir getting even
B-lth the conspirators. We should be glad to
think that the financial distress into which
our contemporary has fallen was undeserved.
But Its record forbids it. We. are compelled to
admit its Justice. And we see no reason why
the decent newspapers of the country should
relieve Its distress to tho tune of ?L_.",fk?n. unless
upon the plen of the restaurant-keeper, who.
upon belog asked why he charged 28 cents for
a sandwich, replied: "Between you and me,
?tr?ne?,, i Deed the money."
DOS QUIXOTE'S SUCCESSORS.
The Knight of the Rueful Countenance aeemi
to bare some success?? In the offices of Spanish
newspapers. On no other theory does It seem
possible to explain some ?if tin- extraordinary
comment* (,n President McKinleys Message.
Quixotic patriots sec foes in erery windmill, and
run a-till agalnal Ibem with their dripping pens.
In what Care of Montesinos they have been
dreaming, or have been deluded by "fake" sen?
sations, i' might not be dHBcull to say, were
that to Ibe point. Tin- practical effect of their
antics is, however, of more concern. So harm
can come to this country. That Is sure. But
the Spanish mind may be excited, the Spanish
Government embarrassed, and the already ar?
duous tssk of effecting a just and honorable
settlement in Cuba made still more difficult.
These things. If they come to pass, will be re?
gretted, no less by the American people than by
nil other sincere friends of Spain.
Attack is made cblefly upon the utterances of
the President concerning alleged filibustering,
which are denounced as cynical and of evil In?
tent. Why? Because tin- President boldly and
straightforwardly denies the changea that have j
been su recklessly made of Infrsctlona of the
neutrality laws. It was perfectly evident to
every Impartial observer, long ago, that no con- ,
gtderable amount of filibustering, if any. wa?
going on. The Spanish Minister at Washington,
one of the most watchful and diligent of public
servants Spain ever had. has repeatedly ad?
mitted that then- was no ground for current
reporta <?f filibustering. The detailed report of
the Se?Tetary of the Treasury, now published,
must be finally convincing to all who read If.
lie gbowa that since the present war began only
six American vessels, of Insignificant Bise, have
landed expeditions in Cuba; six. out <?f a total
of 18,685 that might have been used f??r the
purpose! sixty expedition* are alleged to bars
bean attempted of these the united states has
frustrated thirty three, and ten others have
failed through other causea Seventeen an? ?aid
to hare been successful, but In every case but ,
two, which two are still pending, this Govern- |
ment has fully vindicated its g.1 faith by pun- |
Ishing the principals ?,r otherwise. This Gov- I
trament has constantly employed eight resseli
In this police work, sending tbem mor?- than
75,700 miles. If any other country has n Ix-ttcr
record than that, under similar circumstances, it
would be Int.-resting to know which It |?.
<?n t'.ieother band, obserre the record of Spain
herself. While the mited states has stopped
thirty-three out of sixty expeditions, Spain has
prCTCntcd only four of the remaining twenty
seven from landing. The "ImparclaT -ays "the ;
Spanish Hag floats over Cuba." Why, then,
does it not make its presence there rffectlral
Spain Ig freo to s? izo every unlawful expedition
t tint enters Cuban waters, whether filibusters or
smugglers She has only 2,200 m?es ,,f coaat to
patrol, while the United Stntes baa 5,470 miles. \
If Americans nn- smugging in goods, Spain
ought to strengthen li.r revenue police. If
Americans are running the blockade, Spain
should make her blockade more effective," for it
is a well established principle of International
law that a mere paper blockade need nol be
respected.
Tin- fsct Is. the rnlted States(loreramcnl iin?
don?- au ?t was required to do, under Ibe i?-t:.-r
and In the spirit of the law. to prerenl Illegal
expeditions to Cuba, if any number ?-f su i
expeditions baa been successful and ibe span
ish canse has bren Injured thereby, Spain liai
only herself, or tie- wretched Incompetence ?>f
her braggart blunderer, Weyler, to blame for it
But there is little reason t,, !? ; ??v.- that such
exp?ditions have materially affected Ihe course
of the war. Ths logic which home Spanish ed
it.irs geem to bare adopted Is thi-: without
great help from the United States tin- Cubans
could not hav? held ??ut against Weyler; but
they did hold out against him; therefore they
must have got great help from the I'nlted
S'ates That would be conclnolre, were tin
major premise prov.-.i, .?r susceptible of proof;
but it Is not. Seflor Sagasta reco?gnl?es that
fact, nn.1 s.? ?loes Beflor I??- l/ime, snd it Is not
conceivable that they regard Ibe bombastic
Quixotry of those who should be their support?
ers with feelings other than ?>f dlsapproral snd
regret.
REFORMISO PRESCH PROCEDURE.
While the DreyfUS case Is easting gome nn
pb-asant doubts ni?on the Justice of French mili?
tary trials it i* gratifying to obserre that the
civil code of France 1ms at last been freed from
one of its most objectionable relics <?f medieval
oppression. Briefly Stated, the system of In?
definite Imprisonment and secret examination
of accused persons has been aboltabed, The
initiative in this reform was taken by M. Con?
struis win? will I?" remembered ns the "strong
Minister" of S few administrations back Hin
proposal was promptly accepted by both chain?
liers of Parliament, ami became law a few
weeks ago. It is not |oo much to say that a
new era in French Jurisprudence is thus begun.
Hitherto an officer has been n!?!?? to issue a '
warrant under which the accused person could
l?e arrested .?it any time, the police being free to
enter his lions-- for the purpose at anv hour, and
not only to seize him, but also to take any books,
papers or otinr objects which they might Bud
by ransacking Ibe premises The prisonercouM
then be plated in close confinement in ? common
jail for flays and weeks, while the Judge ex
amlned the things taken from his house at
leisure. After the prisoner bad thus been
treated us a convict, in- ?as brought before the
Judge for secre! examination, and Ihe Judge,
who had biassed his mind BgalttSt him by ex?
amination and study of all obtainable testimony
and was particular)' well prepaied lo lend htm
into self-Incriminating confessions, inflicted
upon htm a vi-iltaiil.- Inquisition, (resting him
as though his gu?t were already confirmed. < ?f
course, not all nor most Judges need their power
for Ihe oppression of prisoners. Mut It was pos?
sible for any to do ho, nnd multitudes of Inno
eeni men had to undergo such humiliation nnd
persecution.
The present reform rcijulrcs tlinl the prisoner
Is not to b- deprived of counsel while In prison.
that he is to be examined within twenty-four
hours after his arrest, that the examination Is
not to !>e secret, and that the prisoner Is to have [
the benefit and services of counsel at it. That
Frame has only Just reached this stage of legal
procedure, which Anglo-Saxon nations have so
long enjoyed, seems really startling. Now that
the reform has been achieved, further progress
will surely be made, unti the great principle Is
fully established that every man Is to be con?
sidered innocent until he Is proved guilty, or at
least that the onus of proof shall rest with the
prosecution and not with the defence. It is px
traordlnary that the country which has made
the most rapid progress and most sudden ?nd
radical changes In many directions shoul.l have
been so slow In effecting this most righteous
reform. Hut. perhaps, now that a beginning
has lieen made. France will take the lend In
legal as well as other forms of progress.
No higher testimony to the wisdom and cour?
age of the President'? treatment of the Cuban
question could be desired than la offered by Mr.
Hannis Taylor, lately United States Minister to
Spain, who says he thinks "Congress should
"firmly and scornfully reject such a policy of
"Irresolution and non-artlon."
"The Xew-York Sun" has taken to lawsuits
to make money. It says Its business has been
Injured, and It sue? the Associated Press for
nearly a quarter of a million dollars for the
Injun- The responsibility of the Associated
Press for this is more than doubtful; but we
have no doubt damages can lie proved to that
amount or more We haye no doubt, either, that
"Ihe Pun" desperately needs the money.

The proposed Introduction of electricity as

opponents of rapid transit, who have derived

Inasmuch as the Rnplil Transit act explicitly
forbids the creation of similar conditions here,
no sensible citizen has considered the argument
from London aa of the remotest consequence;
but It Is painful to think of what may happen
to the other sort of etttstni when they find theh
favorite prop knocked from under them.

the rapid transit plans. Tt was reported wld'-ly yes

credence, that Richard Croker had decided to op?
pose the plans of the Rapid Transit Commission In
every possible way, an<l that If the decision of the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court should be
favorable to the Commission's plans Mr. ("roker
Would resort to every legal device to delay active

after the Tamm.iny government went into power.
Whether this is true or not, and whatever may be
Mr. broker's Intentions with regard to the Rapid

Impossible that they Intend to lay Immediate plans

Lewi- i.. Delsileld, secretary Of the Rapid Transit
i'ommlsslon, had not ln-ard of the plans attributed
to Mr. Croker by runwr when a Tribune reporter
SOW him yesterday at his office, and he had nothing
Li ?ny upon the subject. As to the plans of the
Rapid Transit i'ommlsslon In case the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court should decide favor,
ably on the Commission's report, Mr. Delafleld had
this to say:
"Under the terms of the law the Rapid Transit
Commissioners will be at liberty, If the Appellate
Division of the? Supreme Court shall affirm the re?
port of Its Commissioners that the Rapid Transit
Railroad ought to be constructed, to proceed at

MUSIC.
THE SEIDL SOCIETY'S CONCERT.
At Its second concert, Riven last evening In the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Seldl Society
Offered s programme of mire th.-n ampie propor?
tions, signalized especially by the Inclusion of a
composition by a Rrooklyn musician. It wae the
outcome of nn ?mlnently laudable spirit on the
part of the Seldl Society thus to offer the encour?
agement of ?tu resource* to an American composer,
but such llb-rallty Implies also a re?ponslblltty
toward the public that must not be lost sight of.
It did nit appear la?t evening that such a respon?
sibility had had Its due Influence in the selection of
the work thus to be honored. This Is entitled "Hia?
watha's Wooing and Wedulng." and Is by Mr.
August Weither. The programme did not directly
state what form the componer regarded It ss repre?
senting, but a line in the analytical note suggested
that I; was a "symphonic poem." It Is not, per?
haps, necessary to quarrel over the question of
nomenclature, but a symphonic poem In fiv? dis?
connected movements seems to break with the fun?
damental Idea that has given shape to the compo?
sitions hitherto accepted as models of symphonie
poema. If this were his worst or only delinquency.
Mr. Walt her could easily be forgiven for hi* "Hia?
watha," but, unfortunately. It Is his least. A more
lm|?ortant cno Is th- utter feebleness of his Ideas
and hb? helplessness in elaborating them. Mr. Wei?
ther has not nerved himself with any of the native
Indian theme? or rhythms that might have ?jerved
to give plausibility or characteristic color to Ms
work; It Is said that his music was composed be?
fore Dr. Dvorak an?l his follower. Professor Mac
Dowell, had demonstrated the value of the native
American element of folksong for artistic eompo
Fltion. It may seriously be doubted, however,
whether the skill displayed In this suite?which
ceems to be confined to presenting the component
themes In a serle? of unending sequence?* such ae
the f?ermans style "Rosallen"?could have made
even i e interesting material worthy of the seri?
ous co. nlderatlon of Intelligent hearers. The audi?
ence showed a most friendly spirit toward the
comix>ser last evening, and sumnv.r.ed him to the
front of his box af'er each su< cei-slve movement to
U?w his acknowledgments. Mr. Seldl gave a sin?
cere and Intelligent performanci- of Mr. Walther*?
work, that certainly presented It in the best light.
Mine. Julie Rlve-Ktng was the solo performer.
She played Rubinstein's D minor pianoforte con?
esrto in a manner that sacrificed all Its beauty
even that In the slow movement-to a glassy
brilliancy. She was recalled and played an ar?
rangement or amplification of a Strauss waltz In a
singularly unintelligent manner, though with a re?
markable accuracy of technique. The orchestra
gave admirable performances of familiar pieces?
the "Tannhnuser" overture, th?; dream music from
"Hinsei und Oretel." the largo from Dvorak's
"New World" symphony?perhaps as a gentle hint
to ambitious workers in American subjects as to
how a genius does It?and the transcription of
Wagner's song, "Dreams."

the service of the coupons It prepares the way
toward mortgaging other kinds of taxation and Im?
ports This Is the policy which alms to take hold,
little by little, of the administration of n country
and to reduce an American republic to the condt

It la about the same tnlng. Hut It Is to be hoped
that the Venezuelan Republic will be enlightened
by th? lessons of the past and will know how to
guard Itself nualnst such a misfortune. Inasmuch
as It has plenty of resources. The Veneauelan
