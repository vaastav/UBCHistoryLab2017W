WASHINGTON, Dec 14.-While
considering bills dealing with the
affairs of the District of Columbia,
the House today passed a measure
providing for 8S-cent gas in Wash
ington. The bill now goes to the
Senate ai well is mother bill abolish

attempt by . Representative Henry of
Texas to obtain a change in reference
of the bill prohibiting the dealing in
the future in agricultural products
brought forth a promise from Chair
man Scott of the agricultural com
mittee that his committee could soon
grant the hearings to the Farmers'
Union and others on their subject
The house voted to adjourn from
December 19 to January 4.
In drafting a new tariff bill to be
introduced at a special session of
congress, the house on ways and
means committee is' to give special
attention to the steel schedule. Chas.
M. Schwab will appear before the
committee tomorrow. Andrew Car
negie, who has been subpoenaed will
not appear until the other steel men
including E. H. Gary and Henry C
Frick have testified. The Republi
can members of the committee who
will draft the new tariff bill, will sit
as a sub comittee for this purpose af
ter Monday and during Christmas
recess. When the majority of the
members complete their bill, they
will submit it to the democrats. The
latter will offer the house a minority
report unless the bill reported by the
Republicans provides for reductions
that the Democrats favor. The main
difference of opinion probably will be
be on lumber, metal, and pulp and
paper schedules.
Champ Clark, the minority leader,
has brought out much important tes
timony in his examination of wit
nesses on the lumber and steel
schedules and he favors a material
reduction of duties.

at each. At the afternoon session
Colonel Allison, the cotton seed oil
manufacturer of Texas asked for a
reduction of duty on pressed camel's
hair cloth, the present duty on which
he said is prohibitive and permits a
monopoly of the product.

they will have present tomorrow

members as at the first meeting,'

HARRIMAN WINS.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 14.
In deciding today the case of,E. H.
Harriman and Otto Kuhn against the
Interstate , Commerce Commission,
the supreme court of the United
States held that the commission is
not entitled under the Interstate Com
merce law to press the questions re
lating to private transactions, even
though they involve dealings in securi
ties of interstate railroads, when in
vestigations of such question are be
gun on commissions' initiative. Opin-
on was announced by Justice Holmes
and dealt with the refusal of Messrs.
Harriman and Kuhn to reply to the
questions put by the commission in
course of inquiry concerning dealings
of Harriman as president of the
Union Pacific in stock of other rail
roads, many of which are competing
lines. In dissenting opinion, Justices
Harlan, McKenna and Day declared
that effect of opinion of majority of
court be of a materially narrow scope
of Interstate Commerce law. They
declared the questions so far as sus
tained by the United States circuit
court were entirely proper and should
have been answered.
Justice Harlan went further, saying
that all of the commission's questions
should have been answered. Justice
Moody did not participate in the case.
It ii not 'felt by the Interstate
Commerce Commission that Harri-man-Kuhn
decision will effect ser
iously its powers of railroad regula
tions. The questions passed on by
the supreme court is considered by
the commission as largely academic
as questions propounded by Harri
man and Kuhn did not materially
effect the determinations of the so
called "Harriman cases."

ernment a large reserve army in case

WASHINGTON, Dec. 14. -Between
30,000 and 35,000 deaths and
2,000,000 injured is the accident rec
ord in the United States during the
past year among workingmen, ac
cording to a bulletin on accidents is
sued today by the Bureau of Labor.
Of those employed in factories and
workshops it is stated that probably
the most exposed class are the work
ers in iron and steel mills. Fatal ac
cidents among electrical worked and
iron and coal miners are said to be
excessive while railroad trainmen in
the proportion of 7.46 deaths per lOuO
employes. The bulletin declares that
much more could be done for the
protection of the workmen, but that
it is neglected. Many and far-reaching
improvements have been intro
duced in factories during the last de
cade. ' It is pointed out that the possi
bilities for successful accident pre
vention have been clearly demon
strated in the experience of foreign
countries, "In granting," the bulle
tin states, "that underlying conditions

in European countries are often quite
different and that many of our indus
trial accidents may be the result of
ignorance, reckless indifference or
carelessness, the fact remains that an
immense amount of human life is
wasted and a vast amount of injury
is done to health and strength, with
resulting physical impairment which
hai a very considerable economic
value to the nation ai a whole.
It is insisted that it should not be
impossible to save at least one-third
and perhaps one-half by intelligent
and rational methods of factory in
spection, legislation and control.

HAINS JURY IS
BEING
Counsel Announces That Hains Will Take Stand
in His Own Defense
FLUSHING, N. Y., Dec. 14.-
When the court adjourned tonight
after two long sessions being con
sumed in the examination of tales
men, six jurors sat in the jury box to
try Thornton J. Hains, author, on a
charge of being an accessory in the
killing of William E. Annis by Cap
tain Peter C. Hains, Jr., last summer.
There was difficulty of securing the
jury because of the opinions formed,
early became apparent. From the
questioning of talesmen it became
evident that Thornton's defense will
be that he feared his brother would
receive harm at the hands of the
crowd after tragedy and drew a re

MIKADO'S FREE WILL
Last Cause for Trouble Between
, the Two Countries is Now
Eliminated -
NO "YELLOW PERIL" NCV
Decision is Reached Through a Long
Series of Negotiations Between
Secretary Root and Baron Takahira
the Japanese Ambassador.
CHICAGO, Dec 14. A special to
the Record-Herald from Washington
sayi:
' A Japanese emigration to the
United States is to be stopped by the
Japanese government When the
Japanese Diet meeti a few weeks
hence, Baron Komura, minister of
foreign affairs, will make official an
nouncement that the government has
decided to prohibit all emigration to
the United States after a given date.
Thus will dissapear the last remaining
difference or possible cause of trouble
between the United States and Japan.
Though the announcement in Tokio
may be made upon the assumption
that the Japanese government has
voluntarily agreed upon this course,
as a matter of fact, the decision was
reached through a long series of ne
gotiations between Secretary Root
and Baron Takahira, the Japanese
Ambassador to the United. The or
der of the Japanese government will
prohibit all emigration but will, of
course .leave travel free, so that
merchants, students and tourists from
Japan may visit America at will un
der the passport agreement with the
United States government.
When the "understanding" between
the United States and Japan as to
the Pacific Ocean and Chinese Em
pire was made up a week or so ago
and the notes which had been ex
changed were given textually to the
world, comment was widely made
that if our government had settled
these questions and left the immigra
tion issue unsettled, no very great
progress toward a permanent peace
would have been actually made.'
It is a fact that the highest officials

volver as an act of defense and not
offense. The counsel for Hains an
nounced that Hains will take, the
stand in his own defense .and he is
likely to tell those events at Fort
Hamilton which led to the seperation
of Captain Hains and his wife, and
to the tragedy. Mrs. Hains alleged
confession will also be offered. Coun
sel for the defense were subpoenaed
by District Attorney Darrin to ap
pear as witnesses in the case. Shay,
of Hains counsel, said that Darrin
desired to secure letters written by
Thornton J. Hains to Captain Hains
last spring asking him to return from
the Philippines.
