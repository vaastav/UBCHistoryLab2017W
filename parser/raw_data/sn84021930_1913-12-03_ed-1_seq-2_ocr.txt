Col. Wilds P. Richardson, piesident!
of the Alaska road commisfior, i eBoh
ed Juneau from the Westward last
Saturday, and in the evening wad en
tertained at n banquet given in his
honor, by bueinestmen of Juneau,
Treadwell and Douglas. The purpose
of the affair, which was boldly announ
ad, was to eulist the good will of the
colonel iu behalf of the bridge across
the channel between Juueau and
Douglas Island. Whether it was the
persua*ive eloqnence, or the viands
served at the banquet that influenced
the colonel we caunot say. However,
he is much takeu with the project and
promises to give it hi* earnest support
when he gets down to Washington, D.
The new* comet) from the national
capital that U. S. Marshal Faulkner
and U. S. Attorney Rustgard, both of
Juneno, me to have their official heads
chi'j ped otf just now, almost eighteen
mouths before (be term has expired
for which ffcey were appointed. Ku
mor has it that it was all brought
about by a quarrel between the two
men. The democrats, having an eje
ou all fobs of this nature, are quite apt
in discovering defects in the character
or conduct of republican officers, and
in asking them to sidestep to make
room for the faithful. So it appears
that the betl the two gentlemen can
do is to fold their hands, close their
eyes and wait tor the big knite
If we may believe the JnneaP Dis
patch, Judge U' beit W. Jennings of
the fedeial bench, has announced that
be will giant no more saloon licenses
in Juneau until July 1, 1914. We pre
sume that this may be taken as an in
dication that the Judge is oonvinoed
that there are now enough taloons iu
the Capital city to atteud to all the
business. It might be suggested that
the same ruliug would bp advisable in
regaids to grocery, stores and meat
shops. We understand that the U. S.
Judge has full power iu ruch matters
and may refuse at any lime to give his
sanction to the issuance of a business
license. Altboag the people of Juneau
may complain because a couple more
saloons would mean two thousand
dollars more for the alieady depleted
oity treasury, yet it is better that the
business shall not be overdone. For
many yeais the people of Alaska have
eweat under the authority given to
United Stares judges, which at times
becomes moie extcutive than jndiciary
in its nature. The case in hand is one
to which the measure of home rule,
granted to the territory, does not
extend.

A Douglas man came down towu the
other morning and smiled as he re
marked: 'Tm afraid 1 took a little
more last night than a church member
should take."
14 Why so?" said one of his friends. .
"Well, you see, this morning when I.
came to breakfast my wife said to me:
'William, what was the matter with you
last night? You stood beside the bed
for sometime looking at me and fiinal
ly said: Well, 1 swear, you two girls
look enough alike to be sittters'."'

Wilson With Us
In bis message to oongress, President
Wilson takes up the Alaska question
in earnest, arid urges that this great
storehouse of wealth be opened up for
the benefit of the American people.
Of Alaska, the Presideufc said: "A
duty faces us with regard to Alaska,
whioh seems to be very pressing and
imperative. Perhaps I should say a
double duty, for It concerns both the
political and material development of
the Territory. The people in Alaska
should be given a full territorial, form
of government, and Alaska as a store
house should be uulooked.
"The key to uulock that storehouse
is a system of railroads. These the
government should control' ki the in
terest of all who wish to use them for
the service and development of the
country and its people. But the oon
struction of railways is ouly the first
step, it is the thrustiug iu of the key
to the storehouse and throwing back
the lock and opening the door. How
the tempting resources of the couutry
are to be exploited is another matter
to which I shall take the liberty from
time to time of calling your attention,
fo: it is a policy which mut-t be woiked
out by well oonsideied.stiiget^uGt upjQ
theory, but upon Ikies of jpactiol
expediency, it is a pait of our geneiul
pioblem of conservation.
"We most use the resources of the
country, not loek them ap. The re
sources in question must be osed, but
not destroyed or wasted;- used, bat not
monopolized upon canny narrow idea*
of individual rights as against the
abiding interests of the commnnities.
"That a polioy can be worked out by
conference and concession which will
release these resources and yet not
jeapord or dissipate them, I for one
have no doubt and it can be done on
lines of regulation which need be no
less acceptable to the people and gov
ernments of the States concerned than
to the people and government of the
nation at large, whose heritage these
resources are.. We must bend our
couusels to this^nd. A common pur
pobe ought to make agreement easy.'*'
