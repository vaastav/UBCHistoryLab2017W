With the British Army in France, Dec. 4. That "Field
Marshal Haig prevented the Germans from breaking through

(ftdenemy hosts achieved yesterday at a terrible cost in life. It
mains that yesterday's critical period has been successfully

Haig thwarted what is believed to have been a German attempt
to duplicate the German-Austro-Hungarian performance
Italy.
FIGHTING UNEQUALLED SINCE VERDUN.
(By Aiaoelated Prei.) '
Before Cambrai the violent fighting activity, unequalled
sinceHhe days of the Verdun attack, has broken out anew on a
front of less, than three miles between Marcoing and Genne
lieu. British troops in this sector repulsed-with heavy losses
German attacks delivered in great strength with large forces.
TiESPERATE CONFLICT.
j)
After the fighting of Friday and
Saturday, m which the enemy sut-
i-cd severely in fruitless efforts to
break through the British defenses
before Cambrai, the Germans brought
up fnew reserve forces. These were
thrown against the southern leg of
the salient and throughout Monday,
Field" Marshal llaig says, "fighting of
an exceptionally severe nature" took
place. Thtf infantry masses attacked
under a strong artillery fire . from
concentrated British guns, -v
The Germans advanced ; into La.
-Vaqucrie. but' were -immediately
thrown out of most, of their gains.
East of Marcoing. the attacks forced
the British lo retire slightly. South
of Marcoing the enemy broke through,
but a British counter attack restored
the position. Elsewhere on the Cam
brai battle front there has been little
activity, the Germans bending all
their offensive efforts on the front be
tween Marcoing and Bonnelieu.
Southeast of Ypres, in Flanders, the
British have advanced their line
j'4rhtly near. Polygon ; Wood. Very
Vvy artillery actions are taking
plaee north of the Aisne on the
French front. On the right bank of
the Meuse the Germans essayed an
ittack north of Flirey, in the Woe
re, only to be checked with heavy
loss by the French,
Jnfantry 'activity on the Italian
front has not been renewed, although
the Austro-Germans are busy with
troop movements behind the lines,
probably in preparation for a su
preme blow against the. Italian north
ern front. Large Teuton forces
have been in motion north of the
Asiago plateau and between the
Brenta and the Piave, but they have
kept beyond the reach of Italian guns.
Artillery activity continues heavy.
East Africa Conquered. ,
4 German, East Africa has been
eared of enemy forces and ' Ger
many's last colony has fallen com
pletely into allied hands. The cam
paign in this territory, with an area
of more than 384,000 square miles, be

REPARATION SA YS PRESIDENT
CONGRESS READY
TO DECLARE WAR
ON AUSTRIA NOW
Resolution Drafted by Interna
tional Experts of State De
partment May be Passed
by Friday Night.
President Wilsen yesterday asked
congress to declare war immediately
on Austria-Hungary, and congress, re
sponding with signs of approval, be
gan setting itself about the work.
The senate foreign relations com
mittee and the house foreign affairs
committee, which must deal with the
war resolution, were called to meet
tomorrow. '
The resolution,' drafted by the in
ternational 14w experts of the State
department, will be introduced, and,
leaders say, probably will be passed
by both houses of congress by Friday
night.
The president did not recommend
declarations, of war with Turkey and
Bulgaria, Germany's other allies, at
this time.
Some members of congress, believ
ing they should be included, have an
nounced their intention of attempting
to so amend the war resolution.
Most administration leaders, how
ever, realize that the president may
have a diplomatic reason for not in
cluding Turkey and Bulgaria,' and the
,WUr resolution probably will pass as
the president wants it. "" .
' 'War-on Centrarowers.
Before a crowded hall of congress,
which included the officials of the
American, government and represent
atives of many foreign nations, the
president spoke , the words which he
said he considered necessary to the
successful prosecution ot .the war
against the central powers,
Even though Austria is the tool of
Germany and not her own mistress,
he said, it stands in the path of Amer
ica s part in the world struggle , tor
democracy.
To the unselfish end that there shall
be no peace until Prussian military
autocracy is crushed and reparation
made for its wrongs, the president
pledged again all the resources and
power of the United States.
His attitud towards Italy's claims
for Italia Irridentia is believed to
have been expressed by a reference
to a previous address to c6ngress, in
which he declared all nations should
have free access to the sea. Today
he declared he was thinking of Aus
tria as well as all others.
To Fight to End.
Appealing to congress to devote
all its energies to the successful pros
ecution of the war, the president
closed his address by declaring anew
the determination of the United
States not to lay down the sword un
til a righteous peace is achieved.

Washington, Dec. 4. Applications
for increased rates on live stock, in
less than carloads east of the Missis

GREAT ADDRESS
INTERNATIONAL
IN CHARACTER
Never in Recent History ;Has
Occasion Arisen in Capital
Where Patriotism Reached
Such High Pitch.
Interests All Nations.
Washington, Dec. 4. The inter
national character of President
Wilson's address which was de
livered to congress at 12:30 o'clock
today is indicated by the fact that
the government already has placed1
it for simultaneous publication in
practically every capital in the
world. ' -
Although the address was not
entrusted in advance to 'American
newspapers or news distributing
associations, it already was placed
with the London office of Reuter's,
the principal European news dis
tributing agency, which in turn
was to supply others in Europe.
Indirectly, the address will get to
Berlin and the other central power
capitals. Its world-wide distribu
tion is also evidenced by the fact
that it will be available for publica
tion in China and Japan.
The fact that the government
also has taken steps to have the
document placed in the hands of
Ambassador Francis in Petrograd
is taken as an indication that the
president's address will deal also
with the situation in Russia.
"'The . secrecy which has been
thrown around the address pre
vailed up to the last moment, as
the text was not given to the news
papers until the president began
to speak.
The president, it is understood,
practically finished the document
on last .Saturday. On that day the
document was taken to fhe govern
ment's great printing plant to be .
turned out, with' every precaution
against "leaks."

casions, the declaration of war

equaled in transcendent interest the
message which President Wilson de

today.
It as ascene unrivalled in my
20 odd years of newspaper experience
and it will be written about for

"Justice and mercy," big as the
words arc, did not seem to he any
bigger than, the speech, which has
already been read invery capital of
the world and will be pondered over
by the ages to come.
The fighting phrases of the ad
dress were enthusiastically welcomed,
as, "but we intend to guarantee the
world's peace" and "a partnership of
people that will do it."
. The words fell like manna upon the
jammed galleries and when he came
to the. climax of his speech, "I shall
ask congress to declare the United
States in a state of war with Austria-Hungary,"
every man and woman
in the historic chamber rose, veiled

wondering if some of. the president's
sharp, rapier-like sentences were in
tended for'him. '
An Epochal Occasion.
It was a never-to-be-forgotten oc
casion and the lighting blood of
America, seemed literally to run
throughout the chamber at the brave

Germany Must' Make Full Reparation for Wrongs on Belgium and France, President
Tells Congress; .Peace Can Only Come When Prussian Military Autocracy

Washington, Dec. 4.-Immediate declaration of war against Austria-Hungary
was recommended to congress today by President Wilson. .
The president did .not, howevery recommend a declaration of war against Tur
key and Bulgaria at this time. ,
Immediate war against Austria, the president told congress, was necessary to
meet the anomalous situation the United States faces yin its war with Germany,
even though Austria was not her own mistress and merely a vassal of Germany.
The same logic;, he said, would lead to war against Turkey and Bulgaria, buf
they do not yet, he said, stand in the path of the United States in its war against

WAR - AGAINST AUSTRIA.
Immediate war against Au.itria,
even though she only be Germany's
vassal and not her own mistress, the
president declared, was necessary be
cause the central powers must be con
sidered as one and because the war
can be conducted successfully in no
other way. ' , v
Giving a plain warning, however,
that he would not hesitate to ask for
declaration of war on Turkey and
Bulgarian when he considered it
necessary, the president said:
"We shall go wherever the necessi
ties of this war carry us, but it seems
to be that' we should go only where
immediate and practical considera
tions lead us and not heed any
others."
CRUSH PRUSSIAN AUTOCRACY.
Peace, thc-presidei.t told congress,
can come only when the Prussian
military autocracy is beaten down;
when the German people make peace
with the world through rulers the
world can truirt; when they make
reparation for the wrongs their pres
ent rulers have done stnd when the
enslaved people of Belgium, northern
France nd the Balkans have been set
free.
Germany's declaration that it is
fighting a war of self-defense against
deliberate aggression, the president,
in ringing words, declared "wantonly
false," and he reiterated anew that
no one is threatening the existence of
the independence of the peaceful en
terprise of Germany.
Of those who speak of peace with
out the overthrow of German military
autocracy, the president declared:
I hear men debate peace who un
derstand neither its nature nor the
way in which we may attain it with
uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits.
But 1 know that none of these spe'aks
for the nation. They do not touch
the heart of anything. They may
safely be leVt to strut their uneasy
hour and be forgotten."
To Dominate World. '
Declaring anew that the United
States has no war on Germany's
skill. enterprise or commercial
achievements, the president declared
that the United States became Ger
many s enemy only when it started.
out to dominate the workl by force
of arms. Stating again the war. ob
jects of the UnitcStates and those
which he believed to be those of the
allies, the president declared:
"I believe that I speak for them
when I say two things: First, that
this intolerable thing df which the
masters of Germany have shown us
the ugly face, this menace of com
bined intrigue and force which we
now see so clearly as the German
power, a thing without conscience or
honor or capacity for covenanted
peace, must be crushed, and, if it be
not utterly brought to an end, at
least shut out from the friendly in
tercourse of the nations; and
"Second, that when this thing and
its power are indeed defeated and the
time conies that-we can discuss peace
when the German people have
spokesmen whose word we can believe
and when those spokesmen are ready
in the rtame, of their people to accept
the common judgment of the nations
as to what shall henceforth be the
bases of law and covenant for the life
of the world we shall be willin

glad to pay The full price for
peace and pay it ungrudgingly. We
know what that price will be. It will
be full, impartial justice justice done
at every point and to every nation
that the final settlement must effect,

The developments in Russia the
Kaiser MustBeBchten;
Peace Out of Question
'In ringing, definite terms, the
president declared that nothing
shall turn the United States aside
until the .war is won and Germany
is beaten. All talk of peace he pro-,
nounced out of the outstion.
Peacl, the president declared,'
could , come only when the Ger
man people make it through rulers
the world can trust; when they
make reparation for the destruc
tion their present rulers have
wrought and when Germany re.
"cedes from all the territory ac
quired by armed conquest.
president' dismissed in a few words.
"The Russian people have been
poisoned by the very same dark
falsehoods," he said, "that have kept
the German people in the dark, ami
the poisoiMias been administered by
the very same hands. The only pos
sible antidote is the truth. It cannot
be uttered tod plainly or too often."
A rcnninn ti vin r li J a raMn mmJ'i f irt
I for a declaration of war on Austria,
the president, in no uncertain terms,
told congress it must make adequate
provision to protect the. nation against
the alien enemies. It declared it
should create a "very definite and par
ticular control" over all persons enter
ing or leaving the United States.
Violations of the proclamations cov
ering enemy alien activity, he de
clared, should be punished by peniten
tiary sentences for women as well as
men.
Among recommendations for leg
islation connected with the war the
president included more laws to con
trol profiteering. The law of supply
and demand, the president declared,
had been replaced by the "law of un
restrained selfishness." To congress
itself the president made a plea for
economy in government expenditures.
" The president dosed with an ap
peal to congress to devote its entire
energies to legislation for winning the
War and reiterated the disinterested
war policy of the United States, seek
ing only for the preservation of lih
ertyand democracy.
"A supreme moment of history has
come," said the president in conclu
sion. "The eyes oh the people have
been opened and they see. The hand
of God is laid upon the nations. He
will show them favor, I devoutly be
lieve, only if they-rise to the clear
heights of His" own justice and
mercy."
Just before the president began de
livering his address a resolution pro
posing a declaration of war against all
Germany's allies had been introduced
for Senator King of Utah by his col
league, Senator Pittman of Nevada.
Congress Approves Message.
Approval of President Wilson's i
recommendation of waV on Austra
Hungary was voiced by practically
every member of congress who com
mented upon it.
"It was the greatest the president
has ever, delivered," declared Chair
man Chamberlain, democrat, of the
senate military atfairs committee.
Senator Stone Absent.
' Chairman Stone of the' senate for
eign relations committee did not hear
the address, being at. the War depart
men on business, but announced his
approval. ' ,
Senafor Smoot, republican, said he
thought the president's discussion of
relations with Germany was "too
idealistic," but added: "From the rec

"It was the ablest message ' Mr.

ator Underwood, democrat. "It
sounded the keynote upon which wc
must win the war."
Acting Republican Leader GilletK
of the house and .other republicans
said they regretted the president die
tot include Turkey and Bulgaria.
' "I don't share the president's dis
tinction between Austria and Turkey
and Bulgaria," said Representative
Longworth, republican of Ohio. "I
think we ought to declare war against
all three." ' ;
Speaker Clark and Democratic
Leader Kitchin said they would not
discuss the message until they had
had time to read it carefully. ,
In Sympathy With the People.
"The recommendation for a decla
ration of war against Austria," said
Democratic Leader Martin of the sen
ate, "is in sympathy with the wishes
of a great majority of the American
people." , .
Declaration, of war on Austria
merely transmutes into official action
and international legal record, a con

found itself since it went to. war with
Germany. s V
It changes the status of Austro
