saYQUESTONS UNSETTLED
Among the questions not yet settled
howevr are the coaling station and
religious freedom ot the Caolnes the
Spanish commIssIon not having replied
to the < eric offer
The Americans have agreed to trans
port the SpanIsh prisoners home In i
eluding the garrison and sailors at Ma
nila captured by Admiral Dewey and
General Merlt as wen a the soldiers
and civilians held by the Filipinos
whose return the Americans have guar
anteed Air compensation Spain prom
ises to liberate all Cuban Puerto Rican
and Philippine political prisoners
Spanish soldier electing to remaIn In
the colonies may do so but I Is more
a mater of economy for the Amen
cans to return the others a they must
be fed as long as they are kept and
Spain 15 unable to bear the expense of
the
repatriaton
Also the Americans have rejected
SpaIns request for free shipping for
ten yea in Cuban and Puerto Rican
waters they haYing given the Spanish
commissioners such poor conSolation as
the latter may derive from the per
m slon to reapply when the dllo
mtlc relations have been renewed for
shipping concessions under the reci
rocty scheme of the Dingley law for
which Senor Dupuy de Lome was ncr
gtatng in Washington when the war
broke out
There arc still under discussion eight
secondary subject whIch the Snanlsh
commissIoner broached lat week in
eluding the sttus of patents and copy
rights The American commIssioners
today handed to Senor Montero Rios a
written reply covering these questions
here will probably be no joInt session
tomorrow a the Spaniards desire time
to consider this document
TH SHIPPING PRIVILEGES
I Is learned that there were differ
enes of opinIon among the America I
on the shipping question and numerous
t6egams were exchanged with Wash
ingon Finally the American commIs I
sion was Instructed to refuse the prIn
cipal reasons being that Puerto RIco Is
about to be declared within the coast
line of the United tates while
UnIte whie as re i
gaJls Cuba the authorites at Wash
ington would make no promise a the
American occupation there is not fixed 1
and the future Cuba government will I
mae its own treaties i
Exactly what Spain
Exacty Span requested was
that her ships and products should be
accorded the same privileges In Cuba I
nd Puerto RIco for a period of ten
ear a had ben conceded to Spain
in the Ph1pp nes This request was I
supported by the precedents In the
cases of LouisIana and Florida when
the product and ship of France and
Spain were admitted to the port of
New Orleans Pensacla and St Augus
t ne for twelve years the same a those
of the Unite States
In the case of the purchase of Loulsl
no the same privileges were extended
to the products and ships of Spain be
use she had ceded Louisiana to
Fra three yeo s previously
When the coIlulssioner emerged
from thc toregn oWce this evening af
tar their longseio Judge Day pre
identof the American commission pre
nound that all questions had been
f tte and that tiis treaty would be
signed in three or four days

WashIngton Dee CThe advices
from Pars to the effect that it might
be reasonably presUned that the peace
cntrmissibner will be redy to sign a
treaty of peace within n d yor two
is fully confirmed here I Is learned
hat the presidents instructions to
3udge Day were to hasten the conclu
sion and to tat end the American
commissioners have been authorized to
limit the treaty closely to protocol
poInt leaving other maters such as
the acquisition of cable stations and
naval stations to be dwelt with hereafter
after
At such separation of points Is entire
ly in line with the expressed desIre of
the SpanIsh commissioners thee ap
penra to be no reason now that an
agreement has been reached as to all
of the protocol points why those should
not be Immediately reduced to the form

by congress or the legIslature and the
secretary of agriculture is charged
with the duties of examining the laws I
of Hawaii relating to aglculture for
estry public lads and public roads I I
and reportng thereon to the presIdent
The hilt also provides that the const
tuton and laws of the UnIte States
locally applicable sIU have the sae
force and effect In the territory of
Hawaii States a elsewhere in the United
SttesNO
NO CONTACT LABOR
This Is the usual provision found in
the acts of congress providing for the
establishment of territorial govern
ments in the United States but the
commlssibners regard the provisIon as
exceptionally Important in this bill for
many reasons among which they men
tion te continued impartation of ChI
nese labor into Hawaii
RemarkIng upon the point they say
I has been the policy of the govern
ment of Hawaii before and since the
establishment of the republic to im
port men under ibor l contracts for a
term of year at the expiration of
which they are to return to the coun
tries from which they came Those
brought In are manly from China and
Japan Since the act of congress nn
flexing Hawaii was passed prohibiting
ChInese Hawaiian
immigration HawaIan sugar
planters have seemed to be making an
unusual effort in securing the Importa
tion of Japanese laborers fearing trou
ble and embarrassment on account of
insufficient labor for the care and car
rying on of their sugar plantations Of
course it becomes necessary to extend
our labor laws over the islands so a
t prohibit nil kinds of foreign contract
labor froU coming to the territory
first because It Is the policy of this
country to keep out aU kinds of cheap
foreign labor includIng cooHe labor
and thereby prcient such labor from
interferIng with the wages of Ameri
can labor and secondly to protect our
manufactured products from competition
ton with manufactured goods made by
cheap alien labor The general laws of
the United States will place the people
of the territory on the same footing a
the people of the state and other ten
rlores of the United States in re
gard to foreign labor The question
whether whIte labor can profitably be
utilized in the sugar plantations Is
yet a problem but the planters are
preparing to give such labor a trial
and some of them believe it will prove
superior to the labor of either Chinese
or Japanese
NOT A PRECEDENT
The commissioners take pans tQ ex
press their united opinion that the plan
outlined for the government of Hawaii
cannot be regarded as a precedent for
Puerto Rico and the Philippines say
Ing on thIs point
Much ha been said to the effect
that the policy or scheme of govern
ment for the Hawaiian Islands would
be taken and accepted as an index or
precedent to be followed in the plan
of government for Puerto Rico and the
Philippines In view of this apparent
expectation or belief on the part of
many good peop1e in the United States
the commission deems i proper that
the people of Hawaii are capable of
I seUgovernment and have proven this
by the establishment of the republic of
Hawaii and the adoption of a constitu
tion and code laws which wi com
pare favorably with those of any other
government and under such constitu
tion and laws have maintained a sta
ble government for several ear wor
thy of a free people The people of
those island are more or less familiar
with the institutions and lays of the
UnitedStafes while the las of the
little republic are largely taken from
the laws of this country I cannot be
said that either the Puerto RIcans or
the Filipinos are at aU familiar
wIth our system of government or with
any other based on the princIples of
liberty The underlying theory of our
government Is the rIght of selgovern
ment and a people must be fitted for
selfgoernment before they can be
I
trusted with the responsibilities and
duties attached to free government
These remarks are mae to negative
the Idea that because the people of the
Hawaiian islands can in the judgment
of the commission be consistently giv
en selfgovernment to an extent almost
equal to that gen the people In the
states it can be safely inferred that
other insular possessions whIch the
United Stftes have or may acquIre by
treaty with Span can be granted
freedom In
equal government
DOLE WANTS A CABINET
Tbe retort is unanimous except upon
one points on which President Dole
makes a minority recommendation
ThIs recommendation Is for a board of
advlsos to the governor of the tern
tory and he recommends that the
treasurer attorney genera superin
tendent of public works and commis
sioner of public lands shall l be constituted
J lb gu frsS
tuted special counselors of the govern
ment to be consulted by him concern
ing fl matters of public poll
Mr Dole gives a hIs reason for this
recommendation the fear that without
some such provision the governor may
arrogate himself greater power than is
contemplated Outlining hIs reasons
for thIs position he says
While with some misgivings I hate
assented to the provisions of the ma
jority report whlch places the execu
tive power in the hands of one Indi
vIdual anddoes away with the execu
nyc council I a1 unable to accept
those whIch confer upon the governor
the appointment of all subordinate of
flers and whIch while giving him the
appointment of heads of departments
with the approval of the senate per
mit hIm to remove them without such
approval a power not enjoyed by the
president of the UnIted States Nor
can I agree to the absence of any pro
visions whatever checking the gover
nors execute power under the laws
excepting a to the approval of the
senate required in certain appoInt
ments
e weight or theObjections will be i
better understood in view p the rec
ommendation of the commissioners that I
the legIslature shall hold regular sos I
slons but once in two years as hereto
fore which circumstances would fur
nish the governor with the opportunIty
if ire should choose to seIze I of re
movIng any or all heads of depart
ments immediately after the termina
tion of the regular session of the leg
islature and filling theIr places with
persons whose positions would be valid
until the next session of the senate
which might not occur for nearly two
years By this means a governor act
ing within his authority could subtan
taly evade the provIsIon requiring
these appointments to be approved by
the senate The performance of like
character under the mOlarchY are too
fresh inthe minds of the Hawaiian I
community to permit them to contem
plate without dIsmay the possibility of
a repetition thereof
OTHER BILLS
Of the other two bills one relates to
HawaI n sliver and the treasury notes
and teother to postal savings banks
In Hawaii The frt provides that un
mutilated Hawaiian silver coIns shall
be recived at par value In payment
of nIl dues to the government of the
trrIor of Hawaii and of the United
States and ahal not again be Issued

The report contains an Inventory of

whIch Is of an estimated value of 10

41870
The report gives considerable data In
regard to duties collected showing t
under the DIngley bill the amount
would have been much greater than it
was The report recommends the con
structiomr of a cable to the islands to
structon
be under the control of the UnIted
States whIch I says is demanded by
the military condition existing or la
ble to exist at any time
Speaking of the character of the pop
t4ation of the islands and referring es
peclaly uaton to the recommendaton for
conferring citizenship upon the Portu
guese and falling to confer it upon the
Chinese and Japanese the report says
The Americans although In such a
small minority practically dominate
the governmental affairs of the country
and wIth the British and Germans and
part blood HawaIanAericans to
gether constitute the controlling ele
ment In the busIness The Chinese and
Japanese do not now possess political
power nor have they any important re
lation to the body politic except as la
borer Ihe Portuguese are largely im
migrants from the islands and colonies
of Portugal in the Atlantic aad have
never been very closely ted to their
mother country With the certain at

Washington Dec 6The annual re
port of the secretary of the treasury
contains the following
The foreign commerce of the fiscal
year iSIS In many respects has been
phenomenal The eportaton of the
products of both field and factor e
ceede in value those of any preceding
year and the grand total of exports
was the largest ever recorded For the
first time in the history of our foreign
commerce the years exportations av
eraged more than 1000000 per month
the total being 123148230 against 1
050993556 In 1897 and 10302818 in
1892 no other years having reached the
bilondolar line
Of our domestic exports the value of
agricultural products was 85383570
surpassing by 5435533 the hIghest rec
ord ever before made that of 1892 Our
manufacturers also made their highest
record of exports those for the year
beIng 29069735 against 277285391 In
the precedIng year For the first time
also in the history of our foreign com
merce the exports of domestic manu
factures were greater than the imports
of foreign manufatures while the to
tal exports of the year were twIce as
great as the total Importsa condition
heretofore unknown the trade balance
in our favor being more than twIce as
great a that of any former year
Nearly all branches of the great man
ufacturing industries shared in this in
crease of the export trade particularly
manufactures of iron and steel leather
boots and shoes and mineral oils the
prIncIpal exception being cotton goods
the demand for which was somewhat
reduced by the fact that certain coun
trIes formerly buying our manufac
tured goods are now buyIng our raw
cotton for Ue in theIr own factories
Nearly all classes of the great agIcul
tural products made their highest rec
ord of export in the past year The
value of the wheat and four exported
was greater than in any preceding
year except 1892 the quality of cotton
corn and oats surpassed in each case
that of anyi preceding year and the ex
ports of meat and daIry products
grouped under the general head of pro
visions exceeded in value those of any
former year
The prices realized on nearly an Im
portant articles of export were higher

STEAMSHIP SUBSIDIES
The secretary advocates measures for
the upbuilding of the American mer
chant marine by a system of subsIdies
and bounties HIs method Is set forth
in the following propositions
FirstA remodeling and extension of
the act of March 3 189 relating to the
caring of ocean mais In American
steamshiDs so that It shall meet re
QuIrements which have atisen since the
law went into operation
SecondTe establishment of a sys
tem of graded bounties upon the mile
age navigated by registered American
vessels while engaged in the foreign
carrying trade as compelsaton for the
training of seamen available for the
national defense the system to have
regard also to the construction of ves
sels which may be promptly and eco
nomicalb converted into cruisers
troopships comers and suppishlps for
the use of the government Special pro
vision should also be made for ves
sels and men engaged In the deepsea
fisheries
ThirdExtended application of the
principle of the act of May 10 1892 by
virtue of whIch the St LouIs and St
I Paul were constructed in thIs country
upon the registry of the forigbuit
steamships New York and Paris this
extension to continue for a short term
of years and to be so guarded as to
preserve the coasinl trade to Amen
canbuit vessels
FourthA moderate Increase In the
rates of our tonnage t3es equalizing
them with the correspondIng chares
at present Imposed at London Liver
pool and Hamburg
FifthThe restriction of the trade
between the United States Puerto
Rico and Hawaii and the coasting trade
of those islands to vessels of American
registry
The report closes with an extend
argument in support of the secretarys
well known plan of reforming the cur

Omaha Neb Dec 5General
Freight and Passenger Agents Choate
and Clay of Union Pacific In Salt Lake
are In the city attending meetings of
general agents from terminal points on
the Union Pacific Effort is being made
to brace up tariffs and get better ter
mInal and transfer facilities
The WorldHerald this evenIng
VordHerad tis says
this of Union Pacific and Oregon Short
Line affairs Now comes the assur
ance no longer a rumor that the gsa
rmor tat gn
er offices of the Oregon Short Line at
Salt Lake City will within a few
months be merged Into the Union Pa
cific headquarters in this city Plans
are already made to that end at Union
Pacific headquarters according to a
official so that the big piece of the
old Union Pacific system broken off
during the segregation of nearly all the
brandhes three years ago will again
be directed from this city
It was with bitterness and regret at
the headquarters that the Short Line
pulled off by itself picking out such
men as Auditor Hills ahd Purchaing
Agent Rhoades and over fifty subordi
nates from the headquarters for the
more desirable positions in the Salt
Lake offices Unfnieadiioess kept break
ing out from time to time between the
two roads as between members of a
quarrelsome family The truce finally
patched up is being made more penina
font every day The Oregon Short Line
at its last annual meeting gave the
Union Pacific control of its directory
Vice President Cornish of the Union
Pacific was made president of the Short
Line and his office moved from Boston
to New York alongside that of tire
president of the Union Pacific The
Union Pacific directors last week au
thoriied the trading off of sufficient
amount of Union Pacific stock for Short
Line stock in order that it may own
twothirds of the stock of that line
As once the Oregon Short Line was
but a division of the Union Pacific
with the more economical direction of
affairs from Union Pacific headquar
tens this now with its own general of
flees so officials at headquarters say
it ivlil soon be again
Purchasing Agent Rhoades of the
Oregon Short Line who was in the
city this morning scouted the sugges
tion that a consolidation of the general
offices wilt be effected However he
has been in the east for ten days
Tire above dispatch from Omaha rela
tive to the consolidatIon of the Short
Line and Union Pacific headquarters is
not taken seriously by officials of the
Short Line here It is considered as
natural that the Omaha papers should
want the Short Line offices removed to
that city which is a Union Pacific
town Furthermore the assurance given
by President Cornish that Short Line
affairs would continue to move along as
In the past is regarded with a good
deal of confidence and no changes in
this respect is looked for
The departure of Passenger Agent
Clay and Freight Agent Choate for
Omaha gave rise to some speculation
locally as to the nature of their mis
don In some quarters it was quietly
ventured that the ticket offices would
be consolidated but as to which office
would be maintained no set opinions
are given If a consolidation should
take place the chances are certainly in
favor of a retention of the Short Line
office at least as long as the road con
tinues to be managed seperately from
the parent system
TWO NEW TRAINS
Union Pacific to Improve Its Over
land Service
Special to The Herald
Cheyenne Wyo Dee 6For some
time past there has been much specu
lation here as to the changes srhich
would be inaugurated with the issuance
of the Union Pacifics new time card
the date of which has been set for Sun
day Dec 11 From official source to
day The Herald correspondent learned
that the new card will contain some
radical changes in the running of pas
senger trains between Omaha and Og
den Two new trains one each way
will be put on the schedulesof which
over the Wyoming division were ar
ranged by Superintendent Harris and
assistants today The new westbound
train will be composed of baggage mall
and tourist sleeping cars and will be
run as first section of No 1 the over
land flyer The second seictioa will br
made up of the composite car chair
card and Pullman sleepers The new
castbound train will be equipped the
same as the westbound and will be
run as the first section of No 2 the
eristbound flyer The tatns each way
will be carefully blocked ten minutes
apart and will arrive and depart from
Ogden at about the same time as the
present flyers The a1ditional trains
will of course necessitate more crews
at each division point and the promo
tion of freight crews to the runs tie
protirotion of freight brakemen to con
doctors and thO employmentof new
S
brakemen thus mahiing railroad busi
ness livelier all around The official
who gave your correspondent this in
formation stated that the issuance of
the new time card may possibly be do
ferred until one week front Sunday but
he thought not
This change on the Union Pacific has
been Under consideration for some tim
The object of this additional train son
vice is to lighten the equipment of th
two overland iiyers so that schedul
time can be made Lately the Union
Pacific trains have been much behi
schedule time on account of the enor
moos traffic on the road and it has be
come evident to the management that
the service must be bettered in some
way With this new arrangement it is
expected that the schedule can be
marntalntle and Salt Lake and other
iv stera cities will be greatly benedted
by thcrprompt arrival of mails
This change on the Union Pacific will
result in no immediate change on the
Short Line so far as can be learned at
the present time
