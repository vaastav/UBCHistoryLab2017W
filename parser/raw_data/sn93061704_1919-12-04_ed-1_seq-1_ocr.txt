carload ok cood no;s
Mr. H. L. Andrews has purchased a
car of Registered Big Bone Poland
China hogs for shipment to Mountain
air. This Is the first shipment of its
kind into our town but we hope it
is net the last.
In the more thickly and older set
tled counties in Texas and Oklahoma
blooded stock raising has become one
of the most profitable ventures in the
rural districts. We all know that the
surest way of not making a success
on the farm is to confine ourselves to
raising one kind of crop and that di
versification is the surest way to suc
cess. The raising of Registered stock
of any kind has been proved to be one
of the best ways to diversify. If the
one crop man makes a failure lie lias
to work an entire year before he has
i chance to regain what he has lost.
On the other hand, the man who
raises two or three kinds of crops or
has some hogs or cattle to sell in the
fall has a chance to at least break
even in the face of a complete crop
failure. It is our belief that the sur
est way of stablizing i community
and strengthening the individuals
bank account and line of credit is to
diversify.
MIST CLAIM EXEMPTION

empting from assessment work for

Having seen no items from this

Hope to be able soon to let you
know just what we have done in the
field and garden line.
Mr. Rodgers, a traveling speaker
and lecturer of the Christian de
nomination gave two interesting dis
courses at Liberty Sunday.
Nearly everybody has finished
threshing in this community, in fact
everyone except D. II. Bass and son,
Harry, and W. B. Yarbrough.
It is a problem with the farmer,
whether to get his beans to town be
fore the snow sets in, or to get h's
feed out of the way of the rabbits,
for they sure do come with the snow.
J. L. Johnson and son, Guss, and
W. H. Burns, attended the Nick Hol
liday sale the 23th, and reported a
large crowd and some cheap sales.
Everybody has been so busy for
the past two months that our Socie
ties have been on the wane, but think
hey will come to life now pretty
soon.
R. E. Lea was out Sunday, and ap
peared to be very hoarse; he cam
plained of a bad cold, but think it
was from saying "whoa" to h's new
Ford.
Every new building you noiics is
not a garage. You will find by visit
ing Mr. Yarbrough's and D. L. John
son's that we have a few new barns
under construction.
Carl and Ina May Burin were visi
tors at Center Point last Sunday
morning. Also Mr. Burns was attend
ing church services in the even'ng,
and I think prospecting to F0e how
the Singing fervor was progressing
down that way.
Our school had a vacation the past
week, in order that our teacher, Miss
Esther McCulloh, could attend the
Teachers Association in Albuquerque.
We expect school vul open again on
Monday morning with a larger at
tendance than we huve had.
We were visited with a light snow
the 28th, which reminded us some
what cf last winter. We iijed to call
't "hog-killing weather," but Rorry
o say we have forgotten a'l about
those times; but from the jork
sprouts in the country wt hope to
see those times revived in the t ear
future.

PRESIDENT'S
IS READ
Washington, Dec. 2. General recom
mendations on .legislation to combat
the cost of living, labor unrest, radi
calism and a readjustment of the na
tion to peace time basis, were fea
tures of Prisident Wilson's annual
message to congress delivered today.
The peace treaty, the president
told congress, would be discussed in
a separate message later, as will the
railroad question.
For the second time only since the j and excess profits,
president established the practice of j Readjustment of the tariff system,
addressing congress in person, his i if necessary, to meet changed world
message was read today by the clerks. J conditions and make the system con-
The president made his most ex- form with the fact that the United
tensive reference to the peace treaty States is "the greatest capitalist in
by saying the causes for the unrest the world."
"are superficial rather than deep Recognition and relief for veteran
seated," and that they "arise from j soldiers of the world war, particu
or are connected with the failure on , larly in the way of government farms
the part of our government to arrive
sneedily at a just and permanent
peace permitting return to normal
conditions, from tne transiusion oi
radical theories from seething Europ
ean centers pending such delay, from
heartless profiteering resulting from
the increase of the cost of living, and
lastly, from the machinations of pas
sionate and malevolent agitators.
With the return to normal conditions
this unrest will rapidly disappear."
Hits at the II. C. L-
The president renewed his recom
mendations for legislation to deal ef
fectively with "those persons who by
violent methods would abrogate our
time-tested institutions."
Several recommendations, some re
newals of previous ones, were made
. e
. . 'i K
by the president, to oring uown tac
cost of living. Among them were ex-!
tension of food control law to peace .
times for the emergency; regulations
for transporation of foods in inter
state commerce; a cold storage law,
modelled after the law in New Jer
sey; a law requiring marks to show
the length of time foods are kept in
storage and a law to secure "compet
itive selling and prevent unconscion
able profits" by federal licensing of
corporations selling food in interstate
commerce.
A long portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the condi
tion and rights of labor. "A definite
program to bring about an improve
ment in the condition of labor," and
"bring about a genuine democratiza
tion of industry," was recommen
ded. 'The only way to keep men from
! agitating against grievances is to re
jmovo the grievances," said the pres
'iden'.'s message. At another point it
declared "the seed of revolution is re
presión." "The establishment of the princi
ples regarding labor, laid down in the
covenant of the league of nations."
nid. the message, "offers us the way
to industrial peace and conciliation,
i No other road lies open to us.
j Labor no longer must be treated as a
j commodity.
' Touches on (mil Strike
i "The right of individuals to strike
it Inviolate." continues the message,
'and ought not. to be interfered with
I by any process of government, but
then' is a predominant right and that
is the right of the government to pro
tect all of its people and to assert its
pewer and majesty against the chal
lenge of any class."
I The president was referring to the
ifovernnienl's recent injunction
V-rainst the coal strike.
; The message closed with a point
ed r ference to radicalism and red
do -trines and referred to "Russia to-
,'ay with Its blood and terror, as aja Qf
p.iinful obiect lesson of the er;nij;ht of moisture
of minorities."
i There are those in this country,"
raid the message, "who threaten di
rect action to force their will upon a
! majority. It "Hes little
j difference what minority it Is; wheth
er upital or labor, or any other
IdaEi; no Hort of privilege will ever
'he vcnnlttcd to dominate this coun
try."
j. '
I Orderly processes, me ñusnáis-
Rehired, were the only ones by which
relief r,nd re form could be obtained,
"Those who would propose any
other methods of reform are enemies
of thU country," the message said.
Let those beware who take;
the shorter road of disorder and rev-
olutlon."

Too cold to write much this time.
Our Mail didn't come out last Fri
day. Guess it was too cold for the
carrier. But cars went to town Sat
urday, all right.
Compare this Fall with last Fall
and no one can complain. Suppose
we had of raised a bumper crop last
year and the winter coming so soon.
Fanners would have been in tight.
This year a bountiful feed, beans and
truck crop was ' raised and it would

to give the Farmers a chance to

SUNDAY SERVICES
At the Uaptlst Church
Next Sunday at the Baptist Church,
the pastor will preach at 11 o'clock
and again at night. Sunday School
at 10 a. m. A cordial invitation is
extended to attend all the services.
At I ho Methodist Chapel
The pastor will deliver the mes
sage at 11 o'clock and again at 7 in
the evening. Sunday school at the
regular hour, 10 o'clock. Following
the morning service, the official board
will meet, to which all members and
friends of the church have been in

PAY SHOULD HE INCREASED
The carrier on the Rural or Star
Route from Mountainair to Xray and
return, has had a strenuous time of
trying to make his 10.1 il-.. The bids
submitted at the time of the opening
of the route, a year ago last July,
are entirely inadequate to meet the
present expense of delivering the
mail, and Uncle Sam should take the
matter up and see that the remu
neration is .sufficient to maintain
good service and then see that good
service is rendered. With the pres
ent remuneration, it is impossible to
secure good service and this should
be remedied at once.

SOCORRO . COUNTY .
SHERIFF MAKES
MORE ARRESTS
Last Sunday Sheriff Elfego Baca
of Socorro County was here with a
couple of deputies, en route from
Manzano to Socorro, having In charge
two more men, accused of having
been among those present, when
Abraham Contreras was assaulted at
his home near La Joya, a week ago
Monday morning. On a former trip
the Socorro Sheriff took a couple of
men down, and all will be given a
preliminary hearing tomorrow. The
accused are: Pancracio Sais,1 Pedro
Sais, Luciano Padilla, Antonio Sais
and Emilio Pena.
Notices have been received in Moun
tainair, wherein the son of Mr. Con
treras, has offered a reward of $1,
000 for the arrest and conviction of
the parties guilty of the crime, and
no doubt the case will be hard fought
in the courts.
Reports from Mr. Contreras are
that he is holding his own, but not
making much gains physically. The
arm was so badly shattered by the
shot, that amputation was necessary,
and on account of his advanced age,
this is going hard with Mr. Contreras.
WINTER WEATHER HITS IS
After a couple of windy days last
week, the weather turned cold, fol
lowed by snow on Tueselay night,
continuing with flurries during the
day Wednesday and Wednesday night.
The total snowfall was almost six
inches. On Thursday night, there
was high wind which drifted the
snow from the fields where there
was nothing to retain it. Saturday
and Sunday the weather moderated
and this week has been pretty over
head, with the snow going fast before
the bright sunshiny.
Reports from the mountains and
the Mesa are that the snowfall wis
heavier in both directions than at
Mountainair.
LOCAL BAPTISTS ;0
"OVER THE
TOP"
In the $75.000,000 Campaign for
Missionary and other Church Work,
the local Baptist Church was alletted
$3,000 to be raised during the next
five years. At the morning service
last Sunday, $3,500 was pledged and
during the day the pastor saw others
who had not been present, increasing
the amount to $4,000. There are yet
others to be seen, who will probably
increase the amount to $5,000.
TO INSTALL SHOP EQUIPMENT
J. II. Grifliu of the Mountainair
Motor Company is just back from
Denver, where he purchased a line
of up-to-date shop equipment, which
will be installed as soon as the same
arrives. With this in place the local
concern will be in s'iape to handle
all grades of repair work, and can do
the work which has heretofore been
sent to the larger cities. Not only
will great time be saved in awaiting
the arrival of parts which now must
be ordered from the factory, but in
many cases there will be great sav
ing of cost as well. He also succeed
ed in starting two cars of Fords t-o
ward Mountainair, so as to bo able
to supply the demand at this place.
MO LINE TRACTOR IS A PULLER
,On account of the disagreeable
weather last Saturday, the tractor
demonstration was called off by Clem
Shaffer, for the time being. On Mon
day of this week, the machine was
taken .out to the Shaffer farm, north
of Mountainair, where it was given
a try-out. Those who saw it, claim
that the .tractor walked right off with
)oth plows buried in the soil, prov
ing the pulling quality at the Moline.
Later arrangements will be made for
a real demonstration.
DISTRICT COURT NEXT WEEK
The district court will be in ses
sion at Estancia next Monday. While
no juries will bo called, Judge Mee
chem will hear cases of various kink
in which Juries have been waived.
There will be no meeting of the grand
Jury until the spring term of court.
