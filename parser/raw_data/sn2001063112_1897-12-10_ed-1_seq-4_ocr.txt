President McKinley's first annual mes
sage was read before both houses of Con
gress at noon Monday. He congratulated
Congress upon assemblying under felicit
ous conditions. Peace and good will with
all the nations of the earth continue un
broken. he says, and we should feel gen
uine satisfaction at the growing spirit of
fraternal regard and unification in all
sections of our country and the lifting of
great public questions above party preju
dice.
Beginning with the subject of the
finances the President says that while the
full effect of the legislation of the extra
session has not yet been realized what it
has already accomplished assures us of
its timeliness and wisdom. To test its
permanent value further time will bo re
quired and the people, satisfied with its
operation and results thus far, are in no
mind to withhold from it a fair trial. The
next question pressing for consideration
is that of the currency. With the great
resources of the Government nnd with
the honorable example of the. past before
us, we ought not to hesitate to enter upon
a currency revision which will make out
demand obligation less onerous to the
Government and relieve our financial
laws from ambiguity and doubt. The evil
of the present system is found in the
great cost to the Government of main
taining at a parity with gold our different
forms of money and the experience of the
past four years has demonstrated
that this is not only an expensive charge
upon the Government, but a dangerous
menace to the national credit. It is mani
fest that we must devise some plan to pro
tect the Government against bond issues
for repeated redemptions. We have nine
hundred millions of currency which the
Government, by solemn enactment, has
undertaken to keep at par, and nobody is
obliged to redeem in gold but the Gov
ernment, which must borrow the gold.
Redemption of Treasury Notes.
The law which requires payment out
of the treasury of unredeemed United
States notes demands a constant replen
ishment of the gold reserve, especially in
times of panic and insufficient revenue and
during the preceeding administration
$202,315,400 4y2 per cent, bonds were is
sued and sold to sustain the gold reserve
and pay the expenses of the Government
in excess of revenue. While it is true
that a greater part of this is usedto sup
ply deficient revemies, a considerable por
tion was required to maintain the gold re
serve. If no further legislation is to be
had to correct this and the policy of sell
ing bonds is to be continued, then Con
gress should give the Secretary of the
Treasury authority to sell bonds at long
or short periods, bearing a less rate of
interest than is now authorized by law.
The President says: "I earnestly recom
mend as soon as the receipts of the Gov
ernment are quite sufficient to pay all the
expenses of the Government that when
my United States notes are presented for
redemption in gold and are redeemable in
gold, such notes shall be kept and set
apart and only paid out in exchange for
gold. This is an obvious duty if the hold
er of the United States note prefers the
gold and gets it from the Government he
should not receive back from the Govern
ment a United States note without paying
gold in exchange for it?" That amounts,
to the President's mind, to giving an in
terest-bearing debt, a Government bond,
for a non-interest-bearing debt, a United
States note. The Government should be
relieved from the burden of providing all
the gold required for exchange, and ex
ports. This ought to be stopped. With
an era of prosperity and sufficient receipts
we may feel no immediate embarrass
ment, but the danger will be ever present.
The President invites careful consider
ation for the detail plan of the Secretary
of the Treasury to protect the gold re
serve. He concurs with him in the rec
ommendation that national banks be al
lowed to issue notes to the face value of
their bonds deposited that the circulating
ax be reduced to one-half of 1 per cent.,
and that national banks may be establish
ed with a capital of $25,000. He also rec
ommends that the issue of national bank
notes be restricted to the denomination
of $10 and upwards, and that they be re
quired to redeem their notes in gold.
The Cuban Question.
Turning to foreign affairs the President
devotes much space in his message to a
consideration of the Cuban question,
which he says is the most important prob
lem with which our Government is now
called upon to deal in its foreign rela
tions. Summarizing the history of the
fturner outbreaks, the President comes
down to the present insurrection. Speak
ing of its remarkable increase, its tena
cious existence against enormous forces
massed by Spain, the widespread destruc
tion of property and the disregard of the
civilized code of war on bo-th sides, he
says these conditions give rise to gravest
apprehensions. There is no desire on
our part to profit by Spain's misfortunes,
and we have only the desire to see the
Cubans enjoying that measure of self
control which is the inalienable right of
man. Of the concentration policy of
Weyler he says: "It has utterly failed as
a war measure. It is not civilized war
fare—it is extermination."
Against this abuse of the rights of war
the President says he lias felt constrained
on repeated occasions to enter the firm
and honest protest of this Government,
lie outlines his instructions to Minister
Woodford, which were in substance to
impress upon the Spanish Government
the sincere wish of the United States to
lend its aid toward the ending of the war
b.v reaching a iieacel'ul and lasting result,
lust and honorable to Spain and to the
Cuban people. It was also asked whether
Spain of her own volition should not make
proposals for settlement, and it was said
that he could not contemplate an indefi
nite period for the accomplishment of
this result.
The Spanish reply to Mr. Woodford
was, in !h President's opinion, in the
direction of a better understanding. It
admitted our friendly purposes and deep
interest, and declared that the new gov
ernment was bound to a clwuige of pol
icy that should satisfy the United States
and pacify OuKi within a reasonable
time. To this end political reforms will
be put into effect and military opera
tions conducted on humane lines. It
was suggested that Spain be left free to
conduct military operations and grant po
litical reforms, while the United States,
for its part, should enforce neutral obli
gations and cut off the assistance which
the insurgents, it was asserted, received
from this country. Early and complete
pacification is hoped for.
Spain's Chnrge Is Baseless.
The President declares that the Span
ish disposition to charge us with failure
to meet international duties is baseless,
and points to the efforts this government
have made at the cost of millions, and
by the employment of the administrative
machinery of the nation to perform its
full duty. He also says that the fact
that no military expedition or armed ves
sel luis left our shores has been diplo
matically represented to Spain. Pre
mising that throughout all the horror and
danger to our own peace, tho. United
States 'has never abrogated its right to
determine its policy as to Cuba, the Pres
ident points out tha.t of untried measures
there remains only: Recognition of tho
insurgents as belligerents, recognition of
the independence of Cuba, neutral inter
vention to end the war by imposing a ra
tional compromise between the contest
ants, an intervention in favor of one or
the other party. He says: "I speak not
ot forcible annexation, for that cannot
bo thought of. That, by our code of
morality, would be criminal agression."
taking up the question of belligerency,
the 1 resident quotes at length from Pres-
Grant's message of December 7,
"'herein lie declared that the con
ditions in Ouha warranted neither the
recognition of independence nor the rec
ognition of belligerency. He adds that
moreover a recognition of belligerency
would confer upon neither partv to the
conflict a status not tlieretofore'actuallv
possessed, while it would weigh heavily
in Spam behalf, giving licr the right
of search 011 the high seas and extend
ing her maritime rights to the margin of
our territorial waters.
Recognition Unwise.
For these reasons tho President regards
recognition 01 the belligerency of the Cu
ban insurgents as now unwise and there
fore inadmissible. Should that step here
after be deemed wise, as a matter of right
and duty, the executive will take it."
He points to the hopeful change in the
Spanish policy to the pledge of reform
and to the abatement of the horrors of
war as reasons against intervention 011
humanitarian grounds. The first acts of
the new government lie in the honorable
paths it has outlined the policy of rapine
jmo extermination has been reversed*
broad clemencies proffered: measures
have been taken to relieve the horrors of
starvation. The power of the Spanish
armies, it is asserted, is to be used not to
spread rum and desolation, but to pro
tect the resumption of agricultural in
dustries. The President sketches the au
tonomy scheme of the Spanish govern
ment and says that it is honestly due to
Spam that she should le given a reason
able chance to realize her expectations
and to prove the asserted effieaev of the
new order of things to which she stands
irrevocably committed. He points to the
many concessions already made, to the
modification of the horrible order of con
centration. to die release of the Com
petitor prisoners, and the fact that' not
a single American citizen is now under
arrest in Cuba. He says the near fu
ture- will demonstrate whether a righ
teous peace is likely to be attained- if
not. the exigency of further and other
action by the United States will rema'n
to be taken. Sure of the right, the gov
ernment will continue its watchful cares
over every American citizen, and its ef
forts to bring about honorable prace
and. says the President. "If it shall here
after appear to be a duty imposed liv our
obligations to ourselves, to civilization
and to humanity to intervene with force
it shall lo without fault on our part and
only because the necessity far such ac
tion will be so clear as to' command the
supixirt and approval of the civilized
world."
Hawaiian Annexation Favored.
The President next takes up the sub
ject of the annexation of Haw aii, which
he says, should be accomplished, nap
idly reviewing his former arguments in
favor of annexation, he save that legisla
tion is required in the event of the ratifi
cation of the treaty and, while abrupt as
similations of immature elements of pop
ulation should be avoided, just provision
should be made for self-rule in local mat
ters with the largest political liberty to
the Hawaiians. He says that the "dis
pute .between Japan and Hawaii over the
immigration question is now in a satis

to secure an -agreement Gratification Is ex
pressed at the action of France In this
matter In joining In our efforts and It Is
said that the negotiations are still pending.
Meanwhile the envoys have not made their

estly hopes that their labors may bring about
an International agreement.

A liberal appropriation is bespoken in
der that the United States may mi k
creditable exhibit at the approaching isri~
exposition, in which the people have
8w*
an unprecedented Interest.
Under the head of tho navy, the President
points to the necessity for speedy lecislntiA^
to procure armor for the three battieih
now building, which would be otherwise nil
less. He speaks in terms of praise of th»
quality of our ships and thinks that the tint
has now arrived when the increase to whloh
tho country Is committed should for a tim£
take the form of Increased facilities com
mensurate with the increase of our niv'Ii
vessels. He refers to the lack of docks'-inti
urges that three or four of the largest iineki
be provided on the Atlantic, at least one on
the Pacific coast and a floating dock in thn,
Gulf. There should also be ample provision
for munitions of war and an Increase of.
officers and enlisted men. Additions are also
necessary to navy yards and, as there nre
now on the stocks five large battleships it
Is recommended that an appropriation he
made but for one more battleship on the
Pacific coast. Several torpedo boats are also
necessary.
Legislation for Alaska.
Attention Is called to the need for prompt
legislation as to Alaska and the extension of
civil authority within the territory. There
Is need for surveys nnd for the establishment
another land office at some point In the
Yukon valley, for which an appropriation is
asked. Military force Is also necessary and
the establishment of some flexible govern
ment. If the startling reports as to the prob
able shortage of food for the miners be fullv
verified, every efTort should be made at any
cost to carry them relief.
The message deals at some length with the
unsatisfactory condition of affairs In the In
dian Territory. The large white element Is
said to be without protection and without
schools or other rights of citizens leading
Indians have absorbed great tracts of lands
and created an arlstocrocy, and the friends
of the Indians believe that the best Interests
of the five civilized tribes would be found
in American citizenship. Reference Is made
to the failure so far of the Dawes commis
sion to secure the consent of the tribes to an
extinguishment of the tribal titles and a
division of the lands. It is said that should:
the tribes still fall to ratify the agreement*
then some legislation should be had by Con
gress.
The President approves the recommenda
tion of the Secretary of the Treasury for.an
extension of the quarantine laws and also
suggests the appointment of a special com
mission to ascertain the cause of yellow
fever.
Speaking of the pending sale of the Kan
sas Pacific Railroad. It Is said that If no bet-,
ter bid is received than the upset price
fixed by the court, the government would re
ceive only $2,500,000 on Its claim of nearly
$13,000,000, He believes that the govern
ment has the authority to bid on the road and
has directed the Secretary of the Treasury to
make the deposit of $900,000 required to
qualify as a bidder and to bid at the salo
r. sum at least equal to the principal of the
debt to the government. He suggests, how
ever, that In a matter so Important as tho
government becoming a possible owner of
the railroad. Congress should enact some leg
islation to define Its views. It is clear to
him, however, that the government should
not permit the property to be sold at a price
less than one-half the principal of Its debt
and less than one-fifth of Its entire debt.,
principal and interest.
Improvement of the Civil Service.
The President devotes the last chapter of
his message to the civil service, the prac
tical Improvement of which, he savs, has
long been a subject of earnest discussion,,
and which has of late years received In
creased legislative and executive approval.
During the past few months the^servtce has
been placed upon a still firmer basis of busi
ness methods and personal merit. White
the right of deserving veteran soldiers to re
instatement has been asserted, dismissals,
for merely political reasons have been care
fully guarded against the examinations Im
proved and made practical and a distinct ad
vance has been made by giving a hearing be
fore dismissal upon all eases where incom
petency Is charged or demand made for the
removal of officials. This last has been done
without Impairing the power of removal,
one of the vital safeguards of the system.
Much rema'ns to be done before the system
can be perfected, and the President says
that lie shall not hesitate to exempt cases1
which he thinks have been Improperly In
cluded In the clasified service or Include
those which in his judgment will best pro
mote the public sen-ice. The system has the
approval of the people and it will be his en
deavor to uphold aud extend it.
In conclusion, the President admonishes
C'ongress not to encourage the increase of
the estimates for the maintenance of the
government. They would admit of decrease
I:i many branches and It Is a commanding
duty to keep the appropriations within the
receipts of tho government and thus avoid
a deficit.
