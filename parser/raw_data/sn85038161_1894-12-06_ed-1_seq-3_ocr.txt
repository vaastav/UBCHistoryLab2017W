WASHINGTON, DCC. 3.
To tho Congress of the United States:
The assemblage within the nation's legisla
tive halls of those charged with the duty, of
making laws for tho benefit of a generous and
free peop'e impressively suggests the exact
ing obligation and Inexorablo responsibility
Involved in their task. At tho threshold of such
labor now to be undertaken by the congress of
the United States and In tho discharge of an
executive duty enjoined by the constitution
I submit this communication, containing a
brief statement of tho condition of our na
tional affairs, and recommending such legisla
tion as seems tome necessary and expedient.
The history of our recent dealings with other
nations, and our peaceful relations with them
at this time, additionally demonstrate the ad
vantage of consistently adhering to a firm but
just foreign policy, free from envious or am
bitious national schemes and characterized by
entire honesty and sincerity.
The tecont death of the czar of Russia called
forth appropriate expressions of sorrow and
sympathy on the part of our government with
his bereaved family and the Russian people.
As a further demonstration of respect and
friendship our minister at St. Petersburg was
directed to represent our government at the
funeral ceremonies,
The rules for the prevention of collisions at
sea which were framed by the Maritime con
ference held In this city in 1889, having been
concurrently Incorporated In the statutes of
tho United States and Great ISrltaln, have
been announced to take effect March 1, 1895,
and Invitations have been extended to all
maritime nations to adhere to them. Favor
able responses havo thus far been received
from Austria, France, Portugal, Spain and
Sweden.
The secretary of tho treasury reports that
the receipts of the government from all sources
of revenue during the fiscal year ending Juno
30, 1891, amounted to till 80:,493.9. and Its ex
penditures to f 112,003,758 ST, leaving a deficit of
$C9,S03,2C0.58.
There was a decrease of $13,952,674 66 in the
ordinary expenses of the govcrcment, as com
pared with tho fiscal year 189'.
There was collected from customs $131,813,
E30.CC, and from Internal revenue $147,168,449 70.
The balance of the income for the j car amount
ing to $93,815,51797, was derived from the sales
of lands and other sources.
The value of our total dutiable Imports
amounted to JJ75, 199,088, being (140,657,6:5 less
than during the preceding year, and the Im
portations free of duty amounted to $379 795,
36. being $C4,748,675 less than during the pre
ceding year. The receipts from customs were
173,536,486.11 less, and from Internal revenue
$13,836,539 97 less than in 1893.
The total tax collected from dlstl'led spirits
was (85,!S9,250.25; on manufactured tobacco
788.01.
Our exports of merchandise, domestic and
foreign, amounted during the year to $892,140,
B72, being an increase over the preceding year
of $44,495,378.
The total amount of gold exported during tho
fiscal J ear was $76,898,061 as against $108 003,441
during the fiscal year 1893. The amount Im
ported a $72,449,1 I9,as against $21,174,181 dur
ing the previous year.
The Imports of stiver were $13,286,552, and
the exports were $50,451,265.
The total bounty paid upon tho production of
sugar In the United States for tho fiscal year
was $12,100 208 89, being an Incrrase of $2.7. -078.01
ov er the payments made during tho pre
ceding year. The amount of bounty paid
from July 1, 1S93 to August 28 1894.
tho time when further pajments ceased by op
eration of law. was 000,15 81. The total ex
penses Incurred In the payment of tho bounty
upon sugar during tho fiscal j ear was $120,
140 S3.
It is estimated that upon the basis, of tho
present revenue laws the receipts of tho gov
ernment during the current fiscal j ear ending
June 30, 1893, will be $4:4,47,748 41. and Its ex
pendltuics (411,4.7,748.44. resulting in a deficit
of ICO 000,003.
Thq, first day of November, 1E94, the total
stock of money of all kinds in the count-y was
$.'.'.'40,773 883, as agatnst 2,201 631.00) on
tho first day of November, 1893.
and the money of all kinds In
circulation, or not included in the treasury
holdings, was $1,672,093,422, or $'4 27 nor capita,
upon an estimated population of 08,887,003. At
the same date there was held In the treasury
gold bullion amounting to $44,615,177.55, and sil
ver bullion which was purchased at a cost of
1127,779,983. The purchase of silver bullion un
der the act of July 14, 1890, ceased on the first
day of1 November, 1893, and up to that time
there had been purchased during toe fiscal
year 11,917,658.78 fine ounces at a cost
of $8715,521.32, an average cost of $0 7313
per fine ounce. The total amount of
sliver purchased from tbe time that
law took effect until the ropeal of its
purchasing clause, on the last date mentioned,
was 168 674 6853 fine ounces, which cost $155,
931,002.25. the average price per fine ounce be
ing $09241.
During the calendar year 1893 the production
of precious metals In tho United States was
estimated at 1,739,323 fine ornces of gold, of the
commercial and coinage value of $35,955,000 and
CO 000,000 fine ounces of silver of the bullion or
market value of $46,800,000 and of tho coinage
value of $77,576,000. It Is estimated that on tbe
first day of July, 1894, the stock of metallic
money In the United States, consisting of coin
and bullion amounted to $1,251 ,619,958, of which
$6W23,C0l was gold and $624,347,757 was silver.
Fifty national banks were organized during
the j ear ending October 31, 1891, with n capital
of tf85 0J0. end seventy-nine, with a capital
of $I0,4"5,C0J went Into voluntary liquidation.
Twenty-one bankH, with a capital of $.'.770,000
were placed In the hands of receivers. The to
tal number of national banks In existence on
tho 31st day of October last, was 3,756, being
forty less than on the 31st day of October, 189a
The capital stock paid In vius $07 ,',671,365, being
$9,678,491 less than at the same time in the
previous ear, and the surplus fund and
undivided profits, less expenses and taxes
paid, amounted to $334,121,062.10, which was
!6,089.783 less than on Octobor 31, 1893.
The circulation was decreased $1,741 56J. Tbe
obligations of the banks to each other were
Increased $117,268 334, and tbe individual de
posits were $277,291,489 less than an at the cor
responding date in the previous j ears. Loans
and discounts were $161,209,923 more than at
the same time the previous year, and checks
and other cash Items were 190,349,063 more.
The total resources of the banks at the date
mentioned amounted to $3,473,922,555, as against
$3,109,563,28136 in 1893.
From tbe report of the secretary 01 war it
appears that the strength of the army
on September SO, 1891, was 2,135 of
ficers and 5,765 enlisted men. Al
though this Is apparently a very slight de
crease compared with tbe previous year, the
actual effective force has been Increased to the
equivalent of nearly two regiments through
the reorganization of the system of recruiting,
and the consequent release to regimental duty
of the large force of men hitherto serving at
the recruiting departments. The abolition of
these departments, It Is predlcted.wlll further
more affect an onriinl reduction approxiwat-
Ing $250,000 In the direct expenditures, besides
promoting generally the health, moral anddis
clpllno of tho troops.
The execution of tho policy of concentrating
the army at Important centers of popu
lation and transportation, foreshadowed
In the last annual report of the sec
retary, has resulted In tho abandonment
of fifteen of the smaller posts, which was ef
fected Under a plan which assembles organi
zations of tho same regiments hitherto widely
separated. This renders our small forces
more readily effective for any service which
they may bo called upon to perform, Increases
tho extent of tho territory under protection
without diminishing tho security heretofore
afforded to any locality. Improves the disci
pline, training and csplrit do corps of tbe
army, besides considerably decreasing tho cost
of Its maintenance. Though the forces of tho
department of tho cast havo been somewhat
increased, more than three-fourths of
the army Is still stationed west of
the Mississippi. This carefully matured policy,
which Lccurcs the best and greatest service" In
the Interests of tho general welfare from the
small forco comprising our regular army,
should not be thoughtlessly embarrassed, by
the creation of new and unnecessary posts
through acts of congress to gratify the ambi
tions or interests of localities.
It Is I nrdly necessary to recall the fact
that In obedience to the commands of tho
constitution and tho laws, and for tho
purpose of protecting tho property of
tho United States, aiding the process of
federal courts and removing lawless obstruc
tions to the performance by thd government o'f
Its legitimate functions, it became necessary
In various localities during tho jcar to employ
a considerable portion of the regular troops.
Tho duty was discharged promptly, courage
ously and with marked discretion bytheoffl
ccih and men. and tho mos.t gratifying proof
was thus afforded that tho army deserves that
complete confidence in its efficiency and dis
cipline which the country has at all times
minlfested.
The skill nhd Industry of our ordnanco offi
cers and Inventors have. It Is believed, over
come the mechanical obstacles which have
heretofore delayed the armament ot our coasts,
and this great national undertaking upon
which we have entered may now proceed as
rapidly as congress shall determine
The total enrollment of tho militia of the
fevcral states Is 117.533 officers and enlisted
men, nn Increase of 6,343 over the number re
ported at tho clof.o of the previous car.
in recognition of the long and distinguished
military services nnd faithful discharge of del
icate and responsible civil duties by Ma -Gen.
John M. Scholleld, now the general command
ing the array. It Is suggested to congress that
the temporary revival of the grade of lieutenant-general
would be a just and gracious act,
nnd would permit his retirement now near nt
hand with rank befitting his merits.
The report of the attorney general notes tho
gratifying progress made by the supreme court
In overcoming tho arrears of Its business and
in reaching a condition in which it will be able
to dispose of cases as they arise without any
unreasonable delay. This result Is, of course,
ery largely due to the successful working of
the plan Inaugurating circuit courts of ap
peals. Other important topics are adverted to In the
report, accompanied by recommendations,
many ot which havo been treated at large In
previous messages, and at this time, therefore
need only be named. I refer to the abolition o!
the feo ss stem as a measure of compensat'on
to federal officers: the enlargement of the pow
ers ot U. S. commissioners, at least In tho ter
ritories, the allowance of writs of error In
criminal cases on behalf of the United States
and the establishment of degrees In the crime
of murder.
Tho report of the postmaster-general pre
sents a comprehensive statement of tbe opera
tions of the post office department for the last
fiscal vcar.
The receipts of tbe department during the
year amounted to $73 0!0,479.04 and the expendi
tures to 281,324,414 15.
The transactions of the postal service
Indicate with barometric certainty the
fluctuations In the business ot tte coun
try. Inasmuch, therefore, as business
complications continued to exist throughout
the last year to an unforseen extent it Is not
surprising that the deficiency of revenue to
meet the expenditures ot the post office de
partment, which was estimated In advance at
about eight million dollars, should be exceed
ed by nearly oac and a quarter million dollars
The postmastor general states that this de
ficiency is unnecessary and might be obv lated
at once if the law regulating rates upon mall
matter ot the second class was modified. '1 he
rate received for the transmission of this sec
ond class matter Is one cent per pound, while
the cost of such transmission to the govern
ment is eight times that amount In the gen
eral terms of tho law this rato cov
ers newspapers and periodicals The ex
tensions of tho meaning of these
terms from time to time have admitted to the
prlv lieges Intended for legitlmato newspapers
nnd periodicals a surprising ran'e of publica
tions and created nouses, the cost of which
amount In the aggregate to tho total deficiency
of tho post office department. Pretended news
papers are started by business houses for the
mere purpose ot advertising goods, complying
with tho law In form only, and dlscoatlnulnj
the publication ns soon as tho period of adver
tising Is over. 'fJamp'.o copies ' of pretended
r.ev.spupers are Issued In great numbers, foi o
like purpose only. The result Is a great loss ol
rev enue to the gov eminent besides Its humiliat
ing uso as an agency to aid in carrying out the
scheme of a business house to advertise Its
goods by means of a trick upon both Its rival
houses and the regular und legitimate news
papers. Paper covered literature, consisting
mainly of trashy novels, to tho extent of many
thousands of tons. Is sent through the malls at
one cent per pound, while the publishers ot
standard works are required to pay eight times
'that amount in sending their publications.
Tho report shows most gratifying results Id
the way of economics worked out without af
fecting the efficiency of the postal service
These consist in the abrogation of eteambhlr
hobstdy contracts.re letting of ma 1 transporta
tion contracts nnd In the cost and amount ol
supplies used in the serv loe, amounting in all
to (10 619 047.42.
Attention Is called to the report of the secre
tary of the navy, which shows very gratifying
progress In the construction of ship3 for our
new navy. All the vessels now building, in
cluding the three torpedo boats authorized at
the last session ot congress and excepting tbe
first-class battle-ship Iowa, will probably be
completed during tho ioming fiscal car.
The estimates for tho Increnso ot the navy
for the year ending June ?0, 1896, are large, but
they Include practically the entire sum neces
sary to complete und equip all the new ships
not now la commission, so that unless now
ships are authorized tho appropriations foi
the naval service for the fiscal year end.
Ing June 30, 1897, hould fall below the esti

At tbe close of the last fiscal year.on the 30th
day of June, 1894, there were 969,544 persons on
our pension rolls, being a net Increase ot 3.53;
over the number as reported at the end ot the

These pensioners may be classified as fol

Owing to tho n;cubar foalty of fie statl

the secretary of agriculture etp'psses tho
opinion that every person 0 rplov d In gather

fccrvlcc commission This has led htm to call
for such examination of candlJates for the
position ot assistant stntlcl ins nnd nlo ot
candidates for chiefs of section In tL u di
vision. The advantages to tho pubic service of an
adherence to tho principles of civil service re
form are constantly nioro opparonti and noth
ing is so encouraging to those In official llfo
who honestly desire good government as the
Increasing appreciation by out people of these
advantage?. A vast majority of the voters of
the land arc ready to insist that the time nnd
attention of those they so'ejt to perform for
these Important public duties, should not bo
distracted by doling out mlror offices, and thoy
are growing to bo unanimous In regarding
party organization ns something that should
bo used In establishing party principles Instead
ot dictating the distribution of public places
as rewards of partisan activity.
Tho president Is convinced that we ought
not to be longer without a' national board of
health the national health officer charged
with no other duties than such ns pertain to
the protection of ourcounlry from the Invasion
of pestilence and disease, and earnestly recom
mends legislation to that end.
Ily virtue of a statute of the United States,
passed In 1881, 1 appointed In July last Hon.
John D. Kermn. of the state or New York,
and Hon. Nicholas E. Worthlngtoi. of

So far as the sugar schedule Is concerned, I
would be glad, under existing aggravations to
see every particle of differential duty In favor
of refined sugar stricken out of our tariff law.
If with all the favor so accorded the sugar re
fining interest In our tariff laws It still lan
guishes to the extent of closed refineries and
thousands of discharged workmen, It would
seem to present a hopeless caso for reasonable
legislative aid.
Whatever else Is done or omitted, I earnestly
repeat here the recommendations I have mado
In another portion ot this communication that
the additional duty of one-tenth of a cent per
pound, laid upon sugar imported from coun
tries paying a bounty on its export, be abro
gated. The president then recounts the necessity of
Issuing bonds to replete the gold reserve, and
says; Nothing could be worso or further re
moved from sensible finance than the relations
existing between the currency the government
has Issued, the gold held for Its redemption,
and the means which must be resorted to
for the purpose of replenishing such redemp
tion fund when Impaired. Even if the claims
upon this fund were confined to tho obliga
tions originally Intended, and if the redemp
tion of these obligations meant their cancel
lation the fund would be very small. But
these obligations, when received and redeemed
In gold, are not canceled but are rc-lssued and
may do duty many times by way of drawing
gold from the treasury. Thus wo havo an end
less chain In operation constantly depicting
tho treasury's gold and never near a final rest.
As If this was not bad enongh, we
have by a statutory delelaratlon that
It is the policy of the government
to maintain the parity between gold and sllv er,
aided the force and momentum of this exhaust
ing process and added largoly to the currcucy
obllgat'ons clulmlng this peculiar gold redemp
tion. Our small gold reserve Is thus subject to
drain from every side. Tho demands that In
crease our danger also Increase the necessity of
protecting this reserve against depletion and
It Is most unsatisfactory to know that tbe pro
tection afforded Is only a temporary palliation.
It Is pefectly and papably plain that the only
way under present conditions by which
this reserve when dangerously dep'ctcd
can bo replenished is through the
Issue and sale of the bonds of the gov
ernment for gold: and yet congiess has not
only thus far declined to authorize the Issue of
bonds best suite J to such a purpose, but tv.cre
seems n disposition la some quarters to ccny
both the necessity and power for the Issue of
bonds at all.
I can not for a moment believe that nnv ot
our citizens are deliberately willing that their
government should default in Its pecuniary
obligations or that Its financial operations
should be reduced to a silver basis. At any
rate I should not feel that my duty was done
if I omitted any effort I could make
to avert -such a calamity. As long, there
fore, as no provision Is made for the
final redemption or the putting asldo of the
currency obligation now used to repeatedly
and constantly draw from tbe government Its
gold and as long as no better authority for
bond issues is allowed than at present exists
uch authority will be utilized whenever and
;;s often as It becomes necessary to maintain
a sufficient gold reserve and in abundant titno
to save the credit of our country and mako
good the financial declarations of our gov em
inent. Questions relating to ourb-mks and currency
-are closely connected with the subject
just referred to nnd thoy also pro
Hent some unsatisfactory features.
Prominent among them are the luck of el.is
tlcltylnour currency circulation audits fre
quent concentration In financial centers vrhen
It Is most needed In other parts of the country.
Tho absolute divorcement of the government
Iromtho bus'ness of banking Is the ideal tela
tionsoipor the government to the circu atlon
of tho currency of tho country. Thiscondlt'on
can not bo Immediately reached: but as a step
In that direction and as a means of securing a
More clastic currency and obviating other ob
jections to the present arrangement of bunk
circulation, the secretary of the treasury pre
sents in his report a scheme inodtf vine present
bunklpg laws and providing for tbe fssuoof
circulating notes by state banks free from tax
ation tinder certain limitations.
It is proposed to repeal all laws providing for
tho deposit of United States bonds as security
for circulation; to permit national banks to
Issue circulating notes not exceeding la
amounnt seventy-five per cent, of their paid
up nnd unimpaired capital, provided tLcy
deposit with the government, as a guarantee

cluding treasury notes of 1890, a sum equal in
amount to thirty per cent, of the notes they
desire to ,'ssue, this deposit to be maintained
at all times, but when ever any bank retires
any part ot Its circulation a proportional
part ot its guarantee fund shall be returned
to It: fo permit the secretary of tbe treasury to

AMERICANS IN CHINA.
1 he Entire Asiatic Squadron to Bo
Mobilized Near Tlen-Tsin,
And tho Murines Landed to Afford Ptotcc-
tlon to American I.Ives They Will Then
He Mnrched Overland, n Distance
of About Seventy Miles, to l'rkln,
Washington, Dec. 3. Tho state and
nnvy departments nro apprehensive
that the sltvmtion in China is very
grave, and have determined to mobilize
the entire Asiatic squadron at some
point near Teln-Tsin, in order that
marines may be landed to afford pro
tection to American lives and interests
near tho pointSjOf the threatened out
breaks. Orders vveie issued Sunday to
Admiral Carpenter, commanding the
station, to gather his licet at Taku, and
there land marines to guard the lega
tion at 1'ckin nnd consulates at Tein
Tsin and other cities, where a large
number of Americans reside.
Admiral Carpenter's delay in pro
ceeding to Chinese waters was due to
the failure of a cablegram to reach
him sent the middle of last week. This
message was sent under the belief that
the Baltimore, his flagship, was at
Shanghai, but Sunday it was returned
as undelivered. The Baltimore, it seems,
left the day before themessagc wassent
and Saturday reached Nagasaki, where
a second message was w aiting instruct
ing Admiral Carpenter to lose no timo
in getting as near Pekin as possible.
The admiral has replied that the Haiti
more will leave Sunday afternoon for
Taku, the nearest point to Pekin that
bhe can proceed, and that orders have
been Eent the Charleston, Concord and
Petrel to join the flagship there for co
operation in the landing of marines.
Pekin w ill receive a detachment of
probably 150 or 200 marines, which will
be marched a distance of seventy miles
to the American legation, and there
wait orders from Minister Denby.
Tein-Tsin will also be guarded by a de
tachment of sailors and what marines
are left from the fleet.
The distance from Nagasaki, where
the Baltimore received the last cable
gram from Secretary Herbert, to Taku
is about seven hundred miles, and un
der fast steaming should be reached
early Tuesday. The seventy miles
from there to Pekin can be covered,
it is believed, in about four days
more, so that the legation should re
ceive a strong detachment, adequate
for any oidinary protection, by the
ond of this week.
There is a good deal of alarm felt in
1 aval circles here for the safety of the
l.iarincs on the march to Tekin. The
c Diintry through which they will have
1 3 pass is said to be populated by bands
c f marauders and desperate Chinese,
v ho w ould not hesitate to attack the
Baltimore's men, if an uprising has
c ccurred, w hich many of the officials
tire apprehensive of, considering the
t.larming nature of the request by Mr.
Denby for immediate assistance. Two
hundred marines would be able to cope
with a thousand Chinese, naval officers
assert; but the chief danger lies in the
fact that when Pekin is once reached,
all source of supplies will be cut off,
and ammunition may become ex
hausted. ;
ANNUAL REPORT
Of the Civil Service Commissioner The
Law Well Observed,
Washington, Dec. 3. The annual re
port of the civil service commissioner
says that in the larger post offices the
law is better observed than it has ever
been, and the post office at Baltimore
is mentioned as one in which a marked
Improvement is shown, affording
an instanco o the good done by
the commission investigations. The
Indianapolis oilice is spoken of as
one which was very bad from a
civil service point of view, and which
has now become a good oilice under
the late and the present postmasters.
Boston and Chicago arc said to be
offices where the law is obscryed
well.
In the railway mail service the law
has been absolutely observed, and
neither appointments nor removals
hj.ve been made for political reasons.
Startling; Maritime Facts.
Vabhixoton, Dec. 3. The annual
report of Commissioner of Navigation
Chamberlain is mainly an argument
for free ships, based on maritime facts
of the United States and other nations.
Onlv six American steamships, in
cluding the New York and Paris,
crossed the Atlantic and only seven
on the Pacific last year, while from
New Yqrk and Philadelphia alone
thhty-cight steamships, mainly new
btecl vessels owned by Americans,
crossed regularly to Kurope under for
ci','11 lLiy-. America is a century in ad
vance of the law, for Amei icans own
tuoie steamships than foreign trade
own. The admission of such vocls to
American iegistry is desirable to cn
I'biwp our maritimo rank.
