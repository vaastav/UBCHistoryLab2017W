WASHINGTON LETTER.
(FROM OUR REGULAR CORRESPONDENT.)
Washington, D. C., Nov. SOtii.
There is another record hreakir.g
report of wireless achievement on the
Pacific. The western ocean seems
for some reason to lie better adapted
to long distance wireless work than
tlie Atlantic. There is no particular
. explanation of why this should he,
hut there are so many things about
wireless telegraphy still unexplained
that perhaps this is not remarkable.
The fact remains that one of the na
val vessels when about 1,400 miles
off San Francisco was in communica
tion not only with San Francisco but
picked up a wireless message from
Sitka. This was distant 2,200 miles
air lino, making a record for wireless
communication.
The War Department is going in
for dirigible balloons at once without
waiting for next spring. Army offic
ers have bt'cn detailed to watch the
tests of a new motor in whieh the
Department is interested. Without
saying jusi what the motor is, it may
he said that it has been brought down
in weight to 1 pounds to the horse
power for the larger sizes. It is the
most powerful motor of its weight
that the Department has been able to
find in this country and several of
them have been ordered for the sever
al airships that will soon be under
construction. A ship built by the
private firm that manufactures the
motor was tried out the other day in
the presence of some representatives
of the War-Department. It was
something of a departure in the line
of dirigible balloons. It used the gas
hag to lift the bulk of the weight of
the ship, hut was slightly lieavier than
air when fully loaded and depended
on the thrust of its propellers for part
of its bouyancy as well as for its
driving power. It made an ascent of
several hours duration; attained an
altitude of 1,800 feet and made, in
still air, a speed of 30 miles an hour.
The trial was very satisfactory and
a number of the features will bo in
corporateel in the balloons that the
Department is preparing to build.
There was an interesting visitor at
the White House this week in the
person of old Ezra Meeker, one of the'
pioneers of the northwest who has
been for almost two years engaged in
a journey from Tacoma, Wash., to |
the White House in a prairie schoon-1
ur drawn by oxen. He is interested
in a trans-continental road from the
Atlantic to the Pacific to be known
as the Pioneer Way in memory of
the men with the ox and wagon
trains who opened up the west to
settlement. Ezra drove up to the
White House in his ox drawn wagon
and was introduced to the President
by Representative Cushman of Wash
ington. The President walked out
bareheaded in the cold wind and look
ed over the team and was introduced
to the hired man and the oxen. He
expressed himself as much interested
in the plan for a great intcr-ocean
roadway, but there is a serious ques
tion whether the scheme will become
anything more than a scheme for
many years to come.
Mrs. Roosevelt’s Introduction Of A
Royal Court Custom Starts Gossip.
It appears that the strict formality
at the White House at last week’s re
ception to the diplomatic corps,which
has caused so much comment among
the attaches of the corps, was not the
first instance of that nature. Ladies
who took luncheon with Mrs. Roose
velt two weeks ago arc telling their
personal friends, in strict confidence,
that the lady of the White House tri
ed the experiment of usurping the
prerogative of royalty in leaving the
luncheon table in advance of her
guests.
As the story is told here, it is the
custom at European courts for royal
ty to rise from the table and retire to
the drawing room. When royalty
has got comfortably seated in the
most comfortable rocking chairs the
guests file out and take such scats as
are left. This, the ladies say, is
what happened at the White House.
They say that Mrs. Itoosevelt rose
and retired from the room, and that
after a while they followed. They
say also that they don’t lielieve the
experiment was a success, and that
they think it won’t become a custom.
No reason is given for this belief, ex
cept “because.” All this has been
tohl as a secret. —New York World.
THE SIXTIETH CONGRESS MEETS.
With many new faces in both of
its houses, the Sixtieth Congress met
’ in Washington promptly at noon on
Monday, organized itself for business,
appoint'd the customary committees
to wait upon the President and then
adjourned out of respect to the mem
ory of dead members until Tuesday
at noon, when the annual message of
1 President Roosevelt was received and
read.
( Hon. William J. Bryan was on the
floor of the House throught the ses
sion .
1 The Senate adjourned early, hut
the House plugged along for more
than 4 hours, entangling and untang
ling itself. For nearly four hours
the House was unbound and free
1 from Reed rules, and advantage of
, this fact was token to bring up the
; now almost immemorial question of
i the amendment of the soealled rules
t that confer almost unlimited power
I upon the Sp.aker.
i The Senate was in session only 37
r minutes. The House was in session
, from the stroke of noon until 4.12
t o’clock. Vice-President Fairbanks
1 presided over the opening of the Sen
. ate. Clerk McDowell, of the House,
• presided over the preliminary stages
i of the initial session of the House.
■ After the election of Joseph G. Can-
L non, as Speaker, the Clerk of the
i House relinquished the chair to Mr.
? Cannon, who conducted the affairs in
> the House until the choosing of seats
was concluded. At this juncture Mr.
i Cannon, who had experienced a much
; livelier day than he had anticipated,
■ retired to the Speaker’s chamber af
: tor having temporarily relinquished
! the gavel to Representative James S.
t Sherman, of New York.
- Maryland was represented in both
i the Senate and House by all of her
I members. Senators Raynor and
i j Whyte were on hand in tbc Sena*,.,
; and all six of the Maryland ropresen
i tatives wore present throughout the
1 session of the House.
In the Senate, there are 92 mem
■ hers —GO Republican, 31 Democrats
i and 1 Republican to be elected from
i Rhode Island.
The House has 391 members —221
Republicans, ICS Democrats and 2
; Republican vacancies.
TO PROTECT PROPERTY.
• The Blue Ridge and Monterey Pro
tective Association was incorporated
iat Hagerstown on Monday. The
purpose of the association is to form
, and maintain a At, property, police
i and land patrol, as provided in the
code of Maryland laws.
The term of the association’s exist
ence is fixed at 40 years. There is
no capital stock, the object being
purely benevolent and sanitary.
The association will maintain a fire
department on the mountain at Blue
Ridge Summit and Monterey.
Successful Contests.
The Athletic and Humorous Contests
which were held on the Public Square of
Thurmont on Thanksgiving afternoon
| were a pronounced success and were wit
| dessed by several hundred enthusiastic
' people, many of whom were ladies who
occupied Mr. Creeger's porch which had
been reserved for that purpose.
In the absence of Dr. Sefton and Les
ter Birely, of the committee on arrange
ments, Mr. Park Loy was ably assisted
with the management of the events by
Messrs. Jas. H. Firor, H. D. Beachley,
J. W. Cretger, Roy Fogle, Robert Rouz
er and others.
The rabbit, rooster and guinea chases
were gotten off in good form but the
guinea any kind of a match
for the boys. After being chased over
houses, from trees and into chicken yards,
it was finally caught several hundred
yards from the starting point.
Both running races for small boys were
won by Joe Black while in the race for
larger boys, none except Stoner of Grace
ham dared enter against Edgar Eyler of
Thurmont. Eyler won with ease.
Howard Damuth won the high jump
for smaller boys, his jump being 3 feet
8 inches. Chas. Wisotzkey won the high
jump for larger boys, his jump being 4
feet, 1 inch. Mr. Wisotzkey also won
the broad jump by a handsome leap of
exactly 14 feet.
Willis and Joe Black and Wm. Hovis
respectively won the potato races while
Elmer Creeger was the winner of the hoop
race and Joe Black of the sack race.
Account of some misunderstanding of
rules, the Tug-of-War between Thurmont
and Gracehara cannot be called an official
contest but proved very interesting as
did the general Tug-of-War which follow
ed. Everybody tugged but the question
is “which aide won’’?
On account of the time consumed by
the program arranged, the wheelbarrow
and blind-men’s races were called off and
will be held over until next year.
These contests have proven themselves
a novel and interesting way of celebraf- >
ing Thanksgiving Day in Thurmont and '
the general interest this year indicates
that the custom has come to stay. A
larger committee and some new ideas
will be required for the future but Con-*
tests we must have.

Now each is well and wiser,

| FOR R. R. EXTENSION.
Meeting Held at ‘Buckeystown Saturday
Last.
A meeting in the interest of the pro
ject to extend the W., F. & G. R. R.
from Frederick, through Frederick and
1 Montgomery counties, to connect with
the Great Fails and Old Dominion R. R.,
and thus reach Washington, D. C., was
• held this morning at Buckeystown, and
■ was attended by a large number of resi-
| 1 dents of that neighborhood, besides resi
dents of Montgomery county, officials of
the W., F, & G. R. R., and others.
Dr. Llewellyn Jordan, of Washington,
. presided at the meeting, and after ex
plaining the nature of the project intro
duced Mr. Theodore J. King, general
' manager of the Great Falla and Old Do
! minion R. R.
Mr. King spoke of the benefits to pro
) perty owners resulting from the build
, ing of electric railways through or near
. their property, citing several instances
in which values had been enormously in
! creased by this means. The project of
[ connecting the W., F. &G. and the Great
I Falls and Old Dominion R. R. was, he
, said, a fine proposition from every point
of view. It would open up one of the
finest sections of country in the world,
and would result soon in a new line from
i Harrisburg, Pa., to Washington, byway
J of Gettysburg, which would have more
points of general interest on its route
than any other section of railway of
equal length in the country,
i Mr. D. J. Willard, of Pcolesville, and
i Mr. W. T. Griffith, alco of Montgomery
county, spoke of the interest taken in
the project in that county, because the
people were convinced that it would be
' of immense benefit to them. They urg
■ ed that the people of Frederick county
i join with them in the effort to secure
j the railway.
Mr. Wm. G. Baker, of Buckeystown,
and Mr. William J. Grove, of Lime Kiln,
1 briefly expressed their belief that the
building of the road would be a benefit
• to Buckeystown and the surrounding
[ country.
Mr. Joseph D, Baker, of Frederick,
who arrived after the meeting had com
menced, when called upon by Dr. Jordan
1 to give his opinion of the project, said:
■ “Electric railways as a rule are great
1 propositions for any section through
which they pass. This has been proven
1 by experience in Frederick county. These
railways are wonderful things to bui!U
up the country and increase prcpe;ly
values. lam confident that, if this en
. terprise is properly financed, it will be
, a success.”
Later on, Mr. Baker again addressed
1 the meeting, and stated that while he
was not familiar with the details of the
project, and knew nothing of the plans
’ for financing it, he felt that it was one
which every person owning land along
the route of the proposed railway could
afford to aid by giving rights of way free
of charge, or at a nominal charge, and
by subscribing to the stock.
I Mr. Charles Wertheimer, vicc-presi
■ dent of the W., F. &G. R. R., explain
i ed what the company had already done
. in building towards Thurmont. He said
it was expected to have the road com
pleted to Lewistown by the end of the
year, and that the company had an ar
rangement with the W. M. R. R. for the
! exchange of both freight and passengers
, at Thurmont when that point is reached.
Ho said that the building of the road
through Montgomery county would un
doubtedly he of great benefit to the peo
! pie of that county who have been greatly
handicapped by the lack of railway facil
ities, and also the section of Frederick
county through which it would pass.
, Mr. Brainard H. Warner, of Montgom
> ery county, who was in Frederick today
, on business and went to Buckeystown in
. company with Mr. Joseph D. Baker, was
. called upon to make a speech and spoke
, at some length upon the great benefits
to property owners resulting from the
building of electric railways, citing a
. number of instances in the neighborhood
. of Washington which had come under his
I observation in which property values had
been enormously enhanced by the build
ing of such railways.
Mr. Warner referred to the fact that
he was a candidate for the Republican
, Congressional nomination for this district
and said he was gird of the opportunity
to meet so many of the residents of Fred
erick county.
Committees were appointed to secure
pledges of rights of way and contribu
tions towards the cost of the preliminary
survey.—Daily News of Saturday last.
Lights for Walkcrsvilie.
The committee on lights recently ap
pointed at a meeting of the citizens of
Walkersville made its report at a meet
ing on Saturday night. The citizens
have decided to light the town with gas
oline, and will erect 20 gasoline lights
throughout the town. The committee
was retained to secure and erect the
lights.

A TRIP TO MOUNT LENT.
[communicated.]
On a bright aunr.y mcn.ing of October,
starting out from the little town of Thur
mont lying at the base of the Catoctln
spur of the Blue Ridge mountains inquest
of photographic views of some of the
beautiful scenic landscapes for which this
section of country is so famous, we pass
ed through the Owens’ Creek gorge at
High Bridge and along the W. M. Rail
road.
When nearing Deerfield, there rose up
before us a sharp, majestic bluff of the
northern spur of the Catoctin spur, in
beauty and majesty so sublime as to in
duce us to turn aside from our original
intention to investigate and enjoy the
prospective scenery of which so advanta
geous an elevation gave promise.
Turning away from the county road in
to a narrow private roadway that brou’t
us directly to tlu base of this mountain
bluff, we then began an ascent over a
roadway made by the owner of a most
beautiful property we discovered at the
end of our journey. This roadway wound
back and forth in double S form around
prominent projecting points overhanging
perpendicular heights, and arovnl im
mense boulders that would do justice to
and compare favorably, for romantic
scenery, with the Rocky mountain region,
under cover of arching boughs that en-
I tirely shut out from view the lowland
; landscape below us. On either hand
grew in luxuriance and beauty fern and
I I wild flowers in profusion, which, with
the rugged natural formation, produced
1 a sense of exquisite romance and nature’s
1 freedom, intensified by the exhilerating
1 effect of the rarified air of such an ajti
■ tuie, as must appeal to most indifferent
to nature’s beauty.
1 On reaching the summit, there was dic
covereJ (as one discovers abruptly the
summit of Pikas Peak on a trip on the
! cogg road that carries you up its tides)
! 1 a most beautiful stone cottage with wide
; i verandas, t;sty terracing and general ev
idence of quiet and rest.
| Here we were moct ccidially received
by the owner and builder of the cott. gc
J and roadway and whose name has been
given to this mountain resort and her
: | companion in her life work of relievirg
! tee sufferings of those more unfortunate
and helplcts. Being shown through the
‘ I cottage, we discovered it elegantly fur
! i nished and containing all convc; i.nccs
.1 that go to minister to comfort and ease.
Being shown to a smJl clearing in 1L ,
I woods ort a point that projects northward
■ from the mountain, and sloping off ab-
I ruptly to the valley below, there broke
I j upon our view the valley embracing Deer
-1 field, Sabillasville, the new Tubercular
! Hospital grounds and part of Blue Ri.lge
1 Summit; a view for beauty and expanse,
> and producing a sense of awe and appre
’ ciation of the Creator’s handiwork, felt
I only before when some years ego scaling
the heights of Cheyenne mountain, Colo
-1 rado, and looking out from an altitude of
9000 feet through the gorge over the
prairies for a distance of 150 miles to
where the earth and sky seemed joined
■. in one. We drank in this beauty with
1 reverence and longed for more.
We returned to our humble home am
'■ ply repaid for diversion from an original
plan, and the expenditure of energy and
! time necessary to reach the top of Mount
1 Lent.
