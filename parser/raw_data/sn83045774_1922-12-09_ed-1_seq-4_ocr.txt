STATE NOW HELPLESS

HAS ACCIDENT PROPOSAL
Wants Five to Ten Million
Bond Issue to Eliminate
Dangerous Crossings.
H'
Gov.-elect Smith at the annual
meeting of the'New York State Association
at the Whitehall Cluh yesterday
blamed the railroads for delaying
the plans of the Port Authority for
improving the port of New York.
"The difficulty with the Port Authority
is the absolute lack of cooperation
on the part of the railroads,'' he said.
"We might just as well call a spade a
spade. There is nothing the Port
Authority can do until the railroad
presidents sit down at a table and play
ball with the State and nation, and
this they will not do. They were committed
to the Port Authority plan before
we went to Albany and had it
passed. The only way in which the
nro^iivniA tnnnol r>a? >... Kl t i 11 t hii
Jamaica Bay improvement made and
the other features carried out is to
unify the whole system along the
waterfront, and the railroad presidents
won't do it. /
"Washington is the place for the Port
Authority to transfer its activities for
the time being. The Interstate Commerce
Commission has control in cases
where the Port Authority has not.
WnntM Big Club of Towns.
"In any suggestion I make about the
Port Authority I know whereof I
speak because I am a member of it.
There is a provision by which the property
of any municipality in the district
cannot be taken by the Port Authority
without the consent of the municipality.
This was done by the demand of all the
municipalities in the district. Mount
Vernon, New Kochelle, Rye and other
towns. All will be benefited by improvement
of the port, but the plan
does not touch any part of the State
except Greater New York.
"Shall we continue the State authority
by itself with the manifest opposition
of the local authorities, or make
tipm a part of it? The local authorities
can hold a bigger club over the
ra i I r/Mi rl u than t Vi a Pftrt A nthnrlt v f nr
the latter has no docks to rent or other
advantages which the railroads might
heed.
"You may rest assured that what I
may do will be done because X believe
It will get us to the point quicker than
the route by which we are going."
Mr. Smith said he favored the State
issuing bonds for $5,000,000 or $10,000,000
to cover the initial cost of elimination
of all dangerous railroad grade crosslogs.
"It is too much to put on the taxpayers
in any one year," he said. "The
State should pay a part, the locality a
part and the railroads a part."
The Program for 1023.
The association adopted a program
for 1923 with recommendations for governmental
reforms and public improvements.
Some of the measure* favored
are consolidation of State departments,
reduction in elective officers, budget
amendments, four year term for Governor,
reclassification ot) State employees,

and regulation of "blue sky" securities.

W. Wickersham, chairman of the program
committee.

Governor-elect Smith gave out a letter
yesterday which he said he had asked
Brig.-Gen. Charles W. Berry of Brooklyn

people who try to contest it and make
some arguments, saying that America
has always done her duty. That is true. '
I never said otherwise. 1 never at any j
time said that America did not deserve j
all of the praises that have been given
to her from the fullness cf our hearts.
"That fact is written in history, but
j it cannot be denied that she left us. i
The reasons you may discuss among [
yourselves, and I have no right to inj
terfere."
To the listeners it seemed like a debate
between President Harding at the
Capitol and Clemenceau in Continental
Hail.
Another indication that Clemenceau
had carefully considered the President's
message wus an approving quotation
from it. He said 'he had been greatly
comforted when he read In the message
these "very suggestive lines":
"The four Power pact, which abolishes
every probability of war in the Pacific
has brought new confidence In a maintained
peace. . . . We have had expressed
the hostility of the American
people to a supcrgovernment or to any
commitment where either a council or
an assembly of leagues may chart our
course."
That pleased Olemenceau. "So yoc
see." he sakl, "that even those who are
supposed to disagree really agree at the
j v? ry bottom of their feeling and reason'
Ing power. That is what I ask and J
hope this is something like an overture
that some light will be coming. And 1
will be very glad if it comes from America.
and I hope that diplomacy will have
something to say about it and
may be engaged in which, I um sure
con bring nothing but good for us all."
Ills Message la Peace.
He added, lifting the famous eyebrows.
"so you see I am not suoh a
! wicked man as 1 am represented to be.
My message is pcjice?peace by any
means."
It was one of the frankest and most
entertaining of his American contributions.
A sample of his frankness was
a reference to former President Wilson.
He was speaking of the failure of Germany
to pay to France the money
"promised to us under the signature of
France, of Kngland and of the President
of the United States, and so on."
"A great many friends have told me,"
he went on, " 'you know very well that
Congress did not agree with the views
of President Wilson and you ought not :
to have depended upon us.'
"I did not depend on you. You are
I perfectly free. 1 never said a word to
any American that Congress should
j vote one way orvthe other. That was
no business of mine. But what would
you have thought of us if we had said
to the chief of the American Republic
at a certain moment, 'but you do not
represent American opinion?"
"I ask what would you have thought
of us? You had a legal representative
j there, a man of high mental powers, a
man of strong means. So, do not tell
me that I should know American politics
better. My American politics were
to go with America to the front and
] fight the Germans. Thai is the only
American politics I knew at the time."
The crowd chuckled over this and
then applauded.
Hid Meeting: With Lodge.
Clenjenceau came to America, as ha
i says, to speak to the people, but when
he met Senator Lodge ro-oay he had an
opportunity to present the cause of
France to the man whose influence has
been second only to that of President
Harding and Secretary Hughes in maintaining
the foreign policy of the United
States. Senator Lodge passed tip the
President's message In order to have
! luncheon with Clemenceau at the home
I of the latter's Washington host, Henry
1 White, Nothing of their conversation
was reported, but It was surmised that
the Senator was as frank as Clemeneeau
himself and that Clemeneeau might have
had Senator Lodge as well as Mr. Harding
in mind when in his Continental
Hall speech he undertook to answer
criticism he had heard.
The House Committee on Foreign
Affairs, headed by Representative
Porter of Pennsylvania, went into the
hall in a body to hear Clemeneeau and
sat on the stage. The only member ot

"Prance helps maintain this Impossible i

"Clemeneeau's tour has knocked the
bottom out of the barrel," it continued.
"Instead of trying to convince Americans
that Franco would take a new
road If they would Jend a hand, he has

MANY HEARTS
the corresponding Senate committee
noticed was James \V. Wadsworlh, Jr.,
of New York. Among the other Senators
present were Spencer (Mo.) and
Reed (Pa.). The House delegation included
Speaker Qillett, sitting in a box
with his wife and Frank W. Mondell.
Ambassador Jusserand and his stafl
were on the stage. The State Department
was represented by Under Secretary
William Phillips; the War Department
by Assistant Secretary J.
May hew Wainwright. The chairman
of the meeting, which was a conference
on public opinion and world peace
of the International Lyceum and
Chautauqua Association, was Lorado
Taft. Chicago sculptor. If Senator
Hitchcock or Borah, who have had
occasion to differ with Clemenceau,
was there they were not identifiable
from the press seats. But It was, as
Clemenceau said, "a select audience."
Possibly Ills Final Act.
Clemenceau was introduced by his
old friend. Malor Gen Taskcr H. Bliss.
who saw both "splendor and pathos"
In the events of the French pilgrim':) I
long life. Clemenceau Insisted that his
only message was "peaje for all men."
He talked spiritedly for one hour and
was often applauded. He spoke f j
his American trip as "very likely to '
be the last act of my public life."
"Do you think I would undertake
such a thing at my age Just for the
sport?" he asked. "I ask for nothing
but friendship and good heart and
good will. These are more valuable
to me than all vour gold, although I
know you have a groat deal of It."
As usual he mentioned the fourteen
points and President Wilson In the same i
breath, and there was the usual Instantaneous
applause. He told againthe
story of German reparations failure
and France's plight, pictured the peace ;
treaty as "nothing if it is not executed." ,
He said it was a treaty containing some
articles that should not have been there
and would not have been If America had
not been in the council.
"Shall I say the full truth?" he exclaimed
; "well, maybe we were a little
overexcited about those new people."
But America had moderated and reconciled
opposing views In the finest way.
Clemenceau repeated his argument that j
France is not militaristic or Imperialistic (
and, although of good Intention, cannot
pay money which Germany has not paid
her.
"If Germany is not allowed to pay
us." he said, "what can we do? I have
my watch and gold spectacles, and that 1
Is all I can offer.
Why H ? Came Here.
"I am asked for what precise object ,
I came to America," he went on. "I j
came to ask you why you went to war. .
Did you go to help France reject the ,
enemy? It Is not done. Did you go to ]
make democracy safe? Look afar and .
you see the barbarity of the Turks, the \
anarchy of Russia and the need of ,
revenge of Germany met together under
the treaty of Pappallo. Krupp Is
working In Russia. I do not say war
is coming. I hope It Is not. I do say
it looks as though It might be coming.
That is enough to take precaution. 1
simply say that If the moral assurance
Is given that America does not disinterest
herself from the execution of the (
treaty that is enough. (
"Then the Germans will keep quiet
and the Turks will keep quiet, and .
Russia will understand that if she wants
to come back to the civilized world she
has only to perform civilized acts. Thai j
is all I say."
Of the League of Nations Clemenceau
said it had the advantage of existing
and "that you can go there, maybe with
some reservations to keep yourself free
of its dangers; I do not know, but I
| suggest now that the League has done
much for Austria and Silesia and has
done tt in a rather good way . . .
Will you go back to the League of Nations
with such reservations as you
think necessary? You may.''
After this, Albert, the valet, who had
a seat on the stage, handed his master
his coat and Fiat, and waving at the
applauding crowd the old man said
good-by to Washington. This evening
he drove to the French Embassy for a
farewell. He boarded his private car In
the Union Station at 8 P. M., and will
leave at 1:20 A. M. for Philadelphia,
where he will speak to-morrow.
SAYS WIFE PLOTTED
A $20,000 MURDER
Detroit Police Accuse Her of
Arranging for Killing of
Husband.
i
Spinal Dispatch to Tub New York Mbrai.o. i
Detroit, Dec. 8.?Mrs. Ney J. Ford11
of Dearboarn, arrested last night, on a 1
charge of conspiracy to kill her husband. 1
Ney J. Ford, second cousin to Henry
For/i, pleaded not guilty to-day and was
held In $25,000 ball. A detective charged
he had been introduced to her as a "Kan- 1
sas City gunman" and that he visited
her and received Instructions for the
killing which he said was to have been ,
done at her direction on her husband's
farm.,
When Lieut. E. W. Kunath. the detective,
arrived to keep the appointment
he was dressed In an old suit unci a
blue flannel shirt and had a three days'
growth of beard. In his belt was an old
army pistol.
"It wss the most cold blooded story
I ever heard," Sergt. Straith. another
detective, said, In commenting on the 1
conversation of Mrs. Ford he savs he
overheard.
"We had previously cut a hole in the
wall and placed a newspaper over this
with small slits in it so we could see
plainly who was in the adjoining room
as well as hear the converesatlon.
"For an hour we listened to. Mrs.
Ford review her whole life with her
husband from the time she first met
him and how she 'played' him to propose
to her."
Mrs. Ford, the police say, told Kunath
the best way to get to the Ford farm
and where he could park his automobile.
Kunath. according to the details
of the alleged plot, was to hide In a
barn to which Ford always came early
in the morning to work In ttla hay
mow. I
When Ford entered the hnrn Kunath
was to strike him on the head nn^l then
carry the body by automobile fo another
hay barn on the farmA the
charges say. Here the body was to be
placed under ft pile of hay and the
heap lighted. \
Kunath said Mrs. Ford told him tHo
barn would burn several days and destroy
nil evidence of the crime. Rho
suggested, he says, that he pull Ford's
teeth, which had been filled, further to
conceal his Identity, and offered to supply
ft pair of pliers for the purpose.
Proposals by him to throw the body
Into the river dr bury It were vetoed by
Mrs. Ford as dangerous, Kunnth says.
Aa a further preparation, he saya, she
gave him a pencil sketch of the farm.
Police , have the alleged sketch In their
possession. It was arranged, Kunath
says, that he was to get ILD.OOO for the
'job."
Mrs. Ford also gave him a picture of
herself an.l Ford taken Just after they
were married so that he could Identify
hia "victim,'" Kunath says.
The final meeting with Mrs. Ford was
arranged for Thursday night at 9:15.
Mrs. Fofd then was arrested by Sergt.

YOUTH IN HALL CASE
GUILTY OF PERJURY
Schneider, Who Accused Pal of
Murder, Lies Even When
Before Jury.
THIRD DEGREE DEFENSE
Feeble Minded, His Lawyer
Contends?Will Go to Trial
on Girl's Charge Also.
Special Dispatch to Tub Nbw Yoik Hrsai.d. '
N?w Brunswick, N. J., Dec. 8.?Ray- |
mond Schneider was found guilty to-day 1
of having committed perjury in charging j
his friend, Clifford Hayes, with the :
murder of the Rev. Edward W. Hall and
Mrs. Eleanor Mills. Thus was ended [
what the attorney for Schneider termed j
one of the "side shows" of the murder i
tence later, and while lie could receive '
up to seven years in State prison, Judge j
Peter F. Daley will more probably send
him to the reformatory.
Almost 600 persons were in the court j
room during the day. Schneider was j
virtually the only witness In his own j
defense, for though Walter C. Steadman, i
Schneider's counsel, called Hayes he was
tjuestloned only briefly. On the stand
Schneider made a lamentable showing, j
contradicting himself, shifting about and .
occasionally lying obviously.
Schneider swore that he had made j
the false statement because the detectives
pestered him to tell the truth. He
asserted they kept at him, but admitted
they all told him to tell the truth. He
said he had bee.n losing sleep for some
nights and was in much pain because of
an infected finger.
Hla Defense Proves 'Weak.
He tried to make It appear that he had
not accused Hayes until Hayes had said
he, Schneider, was on the Phillips farm
on the night of the murder, but even on
his own admission he made his accusation
first after he had been in the prosecutor's
office less than two hours and
several hours before Hayes was brought
In to confront him. Mumbling his words
and shifting his eyes, Schneider, in answer
to questions, admitted that he had
lied when he accused Hayes and also
In an earlier statement, when he said he
had gone home before 11 o'clock on the
night of the murder.
With considerable ability Schneider's
lawyer. In his summing up, took advantage
of Schneider's behavior. Ho
said flatly that his client was feeble
minded and It was easy to see that detectives
anxious to get a clew in the
murder case might easily have led him
to make false admissions and accusations.
Schneider, said Steadman, was the
only person brought to account in connection
with the murder. "He Is the
goat," said the lawyer.
John E. Toolan, summing up for the
State, said tl\a.t In effect ihe Prosecutor's
office was on trial. "If Schneider Is
uot guilty, the Prosecutor's office
and the system is guilty," said Toolan '
with asperity. He declared that the I
newspapers had put the Prosecutor's
office on the defensive and that the
men therein, with their lips sealed, had
at one time wondered whether the
state of public opinion due to the murder
case would not result in a lynching.
Judge Daly addressed the Jury brieflyv
The Jury was out only twenty minutes. >
When the verdict was announced
Schneider .took it stolidly. His father
broke down and (hen his mother Ravel
way. Pearl Bahmer, who had been the !
younR man's sweetheart, after belnR In i
the court all day, was taken back to jail 1
before the verdict was announced.
Schneider will be tried on the carnal
abuse charge next week. He will probably
not be sentenced for perjury until
afte?^the second trial.
Mrs. Jane Gibson, star witness in the
Hall-Mills case, asserted to-day that her
story had not been discredited and that
furthermore she had been instructed to
hold herself In readiness to appear again
as a witness. She asserts that what she
had to say about the woman in gray
present at the murder scene was accepted.
but that her Inability positively
to Identify the man who did the killing
ii.tul was the companion of the woman
led the Grand Jury of Somerset county
to refrain from finding an Indictment.
Her statement confirmed the belief that
