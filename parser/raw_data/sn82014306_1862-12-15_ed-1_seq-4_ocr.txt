WEEKLY SENTINEL
MONDAY. DKCKMBKK l.".
Tli lay la I aider.
The people if Indiana and Illinois have en
grafted in theii Slate Constitutions a clmiee which
prohibit the e jlrance of free negroe from other
State, aud penalties are aUacbed for a violation
of this exclusion. This the people have decreed
by a separate oto at the ballot box, and the ma
jorittea iu favcr of it were large and overwhelm
ing. Id this Hute it was upward of ninety thou
and in Illioois nearly as large.
The people meant that .1 free negro population
was not desirable iu their States, and have snid so
with an emphtsis. Their exclusion is absolute,
od not to be changed by any legislative enact
meat. It stinds till the Constitution itself it
changed.
Now, if this right is conceded to the people of
the free State, is it not hard to force upon the
Southern Su te a population from which we our
elves) revoli? Mr. Li.xcolk' proclamation not
only forces free neroim upon the South, but it
liberates a snrvile population in the midst of the
whiten, and .ompels the whites there to submit to
that which LixcoL'sown State ( Illinoi) rejects.
In deciding n lavor of the policy of the proclama
tion.do not Republicans condemn theircwn State
laws? Are they in favor of changing our State
Coosiilulioii, aud permitting free or emancipated
negroes to ome here, without let or hindrance?
If not, why should they decide for the people ol
Kentucky or Tennessee a policy which belongs
to tboee Suites alone V
Christian voters should consider how far they
are acting on the "golden rule," in thus forcing
upon other communities that which they have re
jecied for themselves Every man will judge of
the humanity of a proclamation which gives to
Sixteen St tes the right of exclusion, and denies
the same -ight to filieen others, equally entitled
to a choice.
The De nocratic policy of the Union as it was
in theon'y one which will bring peace, prosperity
and stability to the Government. All else will
end in national disgrace, continued civil war, and
the bankruptcy of all c I as.-es ol our people.

One of Secretary Maulon Vit Ullis
Suicide of ( apt. Klwood.
Xestert-ity morning at about 3 o'clock, one of
the attendants of tne prison in Duff (ireen's Row
(near the Old Capitol Prison.) where prisoners
arrested by order of the Secretary of War are
confined, went to the room where Captain John
Et wood, -f the regular army, was kept, carrying
the latter s food, when he found him lying on the
floor. deid, having two severe tuis on etch side
of bis thro it, which were inflicted by an or
dinary pocket knife held tightly in one of his
hands; the corp.-e was cold and -Ml' wren found,
the act having probably taken place some hours
before.
The fi.ct was at once reported to the War De
partmetr., and yesterday afternoon Col. Dostor,
Provost Marshal, requested that the usual in
quest be held. The Coroner accordingly sum
moned jury, and last evening, after bearing
the evidence of persons about the prison know
ing anything of the circuinatunces ot" the af
fair, a verdict was returned saying that he
came to his death from wounds uiflii ted by his
own band.
Capt. Elwood entered the regular army from
civil lit';, being appointed from Ohio. Up to six
weeks u, since the beginning of the war. he had
beeu dtiiig duty in connection with receiving,
sweurit g in, and disposing of the recruits 1 cach
ing here from time to time, including swearing in
entire legimeuts uot sworn in previous to reach
ing tti: - city.
In t te dischaige of these duties, about six
weeks yefbre his death, he was arrested by an
officer of the Provosi Mar-hal of the War De
partment, charge), it is said, (though no charge
again-, him lias, so far, been made public, that
we bat e heard of, with peculation iu collusiou
with the claim agency firm of Jlell k Glosser
one an old Paymaster's clerk, and the other an
old Quartermaster's clerk to defraud the Gov
ern meat in making pa v men's to them 011 Gor
ernraeot account.
From the moment of his arrest, according to
what s said to-day around us, he was, by order,
placet in solitary confinement, and was not per
mitted to -ee any one up to the time of his sui
cide, except the servant or attendant carrying
him 'tis metis We do not, however, know
whet! er this is true or no'.
The late Captain Eiwood was .1 man of great
indus.ry, of apparently modest and retiring man
ners ati.l habits, though by no means a person of
sharp and quick intellect. Those who knew him
well ill be loth indeed to entertain the belief
that te has been unfaithful to any trust imposed
ou him, though they will not wonder if it shall
turn out that he has been defrauded in m iking
payments ou Government account
H'! was certainly a person of teeming delicacy
of sentiment, Mich as might induce him, without
conr-e!. nri' e opportunity to m ike any effort to
resc le his reputation from the disgrace of the
situ: tioo iu which he found him.-ell, to resort, as
he did, to suicide.
Only three week ago we learned of his arrest,
and then, lor the first time, the fact was made
pob ic, if we remember correctly, through the
Stai.
P. S We see it statel by the correspondent
of a Philadelphia paper that the de eased con
fessed his guilt during his confinement. Iiis
frie ids, however, who yet believe firmly in his
innocence, utter I v discredit the story.
General Rank' Kxpedilion Hrrakitlg
the Backbone ol Ihr Rebellion.
We gave an account in our vostortlay' paper
of the parting ovation made to General Banks on
bis departure from our shores at the head of a
gnat -tnd formi'iabie armament
if r-tenia j this great ex petition, on wiihh are
founded so many hopes and expectation, look
its departure lor, it pie-cnt. part- unknown Ii
m stugular, and we deem it lortunate, that hith
Orto the destination of this expelitiou has been
kept a profound secret. It has now set sail,
either for Kichmoud, or Charleston, or Mobile,
or Texas; but 10 which ol ihse pUces no one

The remarks of Governor Curtin, of Pennsyl
vania, at the leave taking referred to. if not in
dicative of the destination of this expedition, are
ate at least significant and suggestive. He ob
served that "to crush this rebellion it was neces
airy to strike a, the heart of their rebellious
country, to purge the viper's nest; or, in short,
U' Uke Richmond, the Capital of the so called
CoafeJerate States. An expeiiiion to 1 exas

Richmond was taken we could m t ho; to put an
ad to the rebellion or expect the restoration of
t te Union. This is no trifling affiir, and hereto
fire we have failed because we have uot as stead
i y and earnestly engaged in the work as w

I el iet id that its destination is Richmond. At all
events, if it is not, we think that ii ought tobe
When Commodore Vanderbiit rose to speak,
General Banks is said to have remarket: "He is
the only man who knows where the expelitiou is
We ri. retrain gre..t hopes for the results of this
ixpei'.tioii, from the known and approved char
trier of the (et. er. I in command. It has beeu

judge, thai he is the gieatest general officer that
baa beeu uken from the ranks of civil life He
poa.e., also, what the Romans, iu their super
stition, deemed the highest and most necer
quality of a General "good luck " He has been
hitherto eminently felix, or lucky, in all his under
takings. At Cedar Mountain, during the short
and unfortunate campaign of General Pope, he
neceasfuSly withstood with his division the furi
osi onslaught of the whole of Stonewall Jack
son's rebel army; and his prudent and successful
retreat on a previous occasion along the valley of
the Shenandoah, in which he brought ofl his
aray safe! v. even to its baggage, ia worth of
being compared with the famous retreat of Mo
reau, and is equal to that of Xenopheo and his
famous ten thou sand in ancient history.
We heartily join in the general feeling of the
pablic in winning unalloyed succeas to this, the
greatest ext edition which ever left our Northern
shore. We look for solid result fiom its action
aa lern than the taking of Rk mood, while Lee
and hi army are quietly detained at Fredericks
berg no leva than outflanking the enemv, taking
them in 1 heir tear while Bums.de is In their front,
leaving them no chance of retreat or escape, and
obliging them to surrender, aud thus effectually
breaking the very backbone of the rebellion.
Who can tell whether General Banks may not
tarn out, after all, to be ibe Napoleon of the age,
whom the nation ha so long been looking fesr?

W ashimotox. December 8.
Hoist -The Speaker announced the appoint
ment of Mr. Mi'i'her-on to fill the vacancy on
the Military Committee in place ot Blair, of
Missouri; aud Lea man, of the same committee, in
plat col Jiick.-on, deceased
Messrs. Passenden and Walker were apixiitited
to till vacancies on the Committee ou Private
Land Claims
Other standing committees remain as hereto
fore.
The Speaker appointed the following gentle
men as a special committee to investigate the
charges derogatory to the standing of Mr Ashley,
as published in the Toledo Blade and other pa
pers named: Blakeof Ind., Noell of Mo., Casev
of Ky .Haixhtol N. Y.
Mr. W ickliffe introduced a bill for the protec
tion and relief of loyal citixeus whose property
and slaves have been seixel by officers ol the
United Slates Referred to the Judiciary Com
mittee. Other business of minor importance was trans
acted.
Mr Stevens offered a series of resolutions re
ferringthe various parts of the President's ines
sage to appropriate committees
Mr Richardson severely criticised the message,
urging thai most of it was about the negro and
nothing about the bravery of our soldiers.
On motion of Mr Edmonds, it was resolved
thai the Committee on Indian Affairs be in
structed to inquire whether any further legisla
tion is necessary iu relation to Indian lunds held
bv Government, and report by bill or otherwise.
On motion of Roscoe Coukling, the President
was requested, if in his opinion it was not incom
patible with the public interest, to transmit to the
House the last official report of Gen. Buell.
Mr. Van Wyck introduce! a bill to provide for
the immediate payment of clothing lost in service
by soldiers of the United States army. Also a
bill increasing the pa? ol privates, non-commis
sionel officers and musicians.
Both bills were referred to the Committee on
Military Affairs.
Mr. Stevens introduced a bill to indemnify
President Lincoln and other persons for suspend
ing the privileges ol the writ ol habeas corpus,
and lor all acts done iu pursuance thereof.
The hill is the same as that offered last week.
Mr. Tallaudighatn objected to the reading of
the bill.
Under the rules the question occurrel, shall
the bill tic rejectei?
The House refused to reject 34 against 90.
The b-,1 1- then re id a second time.
Mr. Stevens moved to postpone ibe further con
siderationof the bill till next Thursday, and make
it the special order for that day.
Mr Vallandigham oljectcd.
Mr Cox desired to refer it to the Judiciary
Committee.
Mr. Stevens then asked that the bill lie put on
its passage.
The main question was ordered 81 to 47.
Mr Olin expressed surpri-e that any objection
should be made to postponement when an oppor
tunity lor its discu-sion could be itffordel. If
postponed until Thursday, it could be examined
with the care and wisdom which the House
should bring to bear upon the subject. What he
objected especially to was that a measure of such
great importance, and upon which thtre was such
diversity of opinion, should be hurt ieily thrust
through the House. The Pres dent had authori
ty by law to exercise all the power he had ex
ercisel with regard to the writ of habeas corpus
He concurred with the gentlemen from Pennsyl
vania (Stevens) th l a bill of this character was
proper; but while he thus concurred, he should
regret to -ee the bill hurried through without
members knowing its legal prov.sions. It was
discreditable to the House and country. He
should be ashamed to return to his constituents
and say that Congress h id pas.-ed an act w ithout
permitting a word, yea or nay, to be said on the
subject He hoped, for the crelit of the House
and thecountrv, that the matter would be post
poned. Mr. Vallandigham stid he had objected only
to the bill being made the spe-ial order.
Mr Colfax differed from the gentleman from
Ohio; he did not think the immediate passage of
the bill would be discreditable to the House. In
stead of this, it would be creditable. This ques
I tion has been discussed all over the land, whether
1 the President has power to suspend the writ of
! habeas corous during the rebellion. He stood
ready to vote for the bill to indemnify him He
hopel the bili would pass at once.
Mr. Stevens was about addressing the House
on the subject, when
Mr. Yitllandigham raised a question that Mr.
Stevens had no right, under the rules, to do so.
Mr. S. evens asket for three minute- to ex
plain. Mr Vallandigham objected unless others hare
a similar privilege.
Mr. Holman moved' to lay the bill on the table.
L'.-t 4ö to tG.
Mr Stevens explained. It was not his inten
tion to put the bill on its passage, but a postpone
men was prevented. Massachusetts desire! an
amendment that those who had been illegally im
prisonel might have their remedy.
Mr Stevens, in fuither explanation, said he
double! the authority of the President to sus
ft$$i the writ of habeas corpus except Iroin ab
solute necessity during the recess of Congress.
He held that Congress was the sovereign power,
and not the President.
The bill passed 90 against 45.
Senate Messrs Foster. Sumner, Dixon, La
th int. Fessenden. Grimes and King, severally
presented petitions in favor of a general bankrupt
act.

; and rank of those appointed, drawing pay and

Mr Wiiso... t M i-s ichu-etts. offered a reso
I lutiou instructing the Secretary of War to report
I to the Senate the number of M ijor Generals and
. Brigadier itenerals now iu the service of the
United Slates, and where and how they are em
ployed.
Mr 5umner offered a resolution that the call
upon the Secretary -if Wir for c nes,! mdem e
and matter relating to the Armv of the Poto
. mtc, be exten h-d so a- to embody all operations
I since the hrsi movement ot that army, which
was adopted.
Mr. Latham introduced a bill to provide for
developing the mineial resources of the United
States. Relerrel.
Mr. Siu'sbury - ilied up the resolution re
laling to the arrest of certain citizens
Mr Wilson, of Massachusetts, objected.
Mr. Bayard urgef the adoption of the resolu
tion. Mr. Doolittle said that iu all the cases of rr
i rest offers of liberty had been made it the
: prisoners arrested would take the oath of al
' legiance. He would like to have the resolution
lie over.
Mr. Saul-bury said that he had referred to
these two persons bec.iue iie had r.ever heard
I any charges against them; they had been arrest
' rested iu a loyal Slate, and for 110 offense what
j ever. He thought they had at least the right to
ex imme into the m itter. I nere was no uisposi
lion to opuose the Government at all.
After further discussion, the Chair announced
(he apeeMl order to be the bankrupt act, which
was informally laid aside.
Mr. Fessenden, from the Committee on Fi
nance, reported a bill concerning judgments in
certain suiia brought by the Uuilee States, which
was amended and passel.

exceelini; one bom each State, wnose noui"
nation shall have been iiutheniica'ed to
Conuress, hall be before said convention as can
didates for the Presidency; and thereupon said
convention shall proceed, under the supervision
of the presiding officers of the two House, to
vote, bv open ballot, from among said candidates
for President; and, when any one shall have re
ceived a number of votes equal to all the mem
Iters elected and appointed by both Houses of
Congress, he shall be declare! by the President of
the Senate to be elected President of the United

The resolution was ordere! to be printed.
After executive session, adjourned.
Washisoto.m, December 9.
Senate The Chair laid before the house a
communication from the secretary of War in
answer to a resolution calling for information in
relation to the sale of colored freemen captured
by the tehels, kc.
The reply of Secretary Stanton states that no
information on the subject is in possession of
the War Department.
Mr Sherman presentel a petition in favor ol
a general bankrupt act
Mr. Davis presented two petition protesting
against the action of the Advisory Board of the
Navy.
Mr. Sumner, from the Committee on Foreign
Relations, lej .'i ted a bill for the relief of the
owners of the French vessels Inles aud Kt
Marie.
Mr. Anthony, from the Committee on Print
ing, reported a bill to increase the bonds of the
Superintendent of Printing.
Mr. Hale introduce! a bill to abolish the grade
of meiical officers in the service of the United
State.
The resolution offered by Mr. Spaulditip rela
tive to the arbitrary arre.-t of citizens of Dela
ware was taken up.
Mr Hale said the Senator from Delaware (Mr.
B.tard) ye-tenlav referred to a proper division of
power as being the hope of a free Government;
and he (II ne) was not willing to see the Senate
interfere with other Derailment. If any citi
xens of Delaware had been aggrieved, ihe courts
were still open Hcbelicted the writ ot habeas
corpus tta- not de id vet He acknowledged this
was an embarrassing question
Mr Hit anl said tlicrs was no such division of
Government power. The judiciary was always
the weakest. The President has asserted the
right to suspend the writ ol habeas corpus, and
he th'tught it proper for the Senate to inquire
into the matter.
Mr Wilson, of Mass , -aid doubtless every
body regretted the necessity of making these ar
rests iu this country. The President regretted it
as much as anybody. He did not think any loyal
man could charge the President with wantonly
violating the right of citizens for a long time.
The leading traitors sat here, but no arrests were
made. When they were commissioned they
were necessary, and the first artest was lor seli-
I ing gun caps to the enemy.
He, for one, thankel the President for making
these irrest. It was a powerful means of pre
serving the Government, and he hopel the Presi
dent and his advisers would not shrink from ar
re-ting ant man who shows probable cause ot be
ing in league with the rebels. There was never
a rebellion w here so much consideration had been
shown, and so much humanity for traitors.
Mr. Siulsbury did nol doubt that there were
arre-ts made wh ch w ere justifiable; but these men
were citizens of Delaware, who.-e loyalty was
never questioned.
The motion to lay on the table was disagree!
to by a vote of 3 yeas to 40 nays.
Mr. Field said he should vote against the reso
lution. He was of opinion that the President had
the right to suspend the writ of habeas corpus.
The trainers of the Constitution evidently in
tended that the habeas corpus might be suspendel
in time of insurrection or invasion, and he thought
ii was clearly an Executive act. He was of the
opinion that if any complaiut was to be made it
was that the Government had been too lenient
to traitors.
Mr. Bayard continued at length, saying that
the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus
was nol an executive act. If this was admitted,
aud legislative power had no right to inquire,
then the President might imprison men, or tor
ture them, or do as he pleased w itli them.
Mr. Sherman lavored the adoption of all these
resolutions of inquiry, which were offered in good
faith. He believed ihe right to suspend the writ
of habeas corpus was purely a legislative power,
aud it could only be done by Congress; but since
the legislation oflr.st Congte-s the President has
had power git en to him. He thought many of
these arrests were great mistakes; and every ar
rest ought to be reportel to Congress, and the
reasons for it. If the power was unlimited, the
Government would bee 111 e oppressive. The
people have been exasperate i at the manner ol
tht.-e arre-is and di-cliarges. and it was due to the
country and ju-lice that no man should be ar
rester for light cause. The cause ami charge
should be projerlv explainel Congress had a
perfect right to call for information that they
may go betöre the people, aud be able to explain
and defend these arrest.-.
Mr Trumbull -aid that as he could not see
any practical benelit to be obtained in passing
these resolutions, he was inclined to vote against
them He '.bought the arrests had been unfortu
nate and impolitic. Judges, and courts, and
commeutitors have held that the power of -u--peodiug
the writ of habeas corpus was a iegis
lative power It is not from any sympathy with
U a i tors that there iä great feeling upon this sub
ject, but be-aiife it is fen-el it is an exercise of
an unnecessary and arbitrary power. He would
say to his friend. (Wilson) who gloried in these
arrests, that there was vet v great danger in them;
1 there was a bill now before the house 1 dative to
this very subject, and he was in favor of acting
upon that as a practical measure.
Mr Powell said the President had no right to
nuke these arrest or to suspend the writ, and
doing so was usurpation. The people have de
filled that these arrests should cease. There
cent elections showed this.
Mr Wilson okaiaied that no such question waa
settled by the ele-tioiis. The nlt thing settled
was thai the Republican p rtt could not raise
men enough to send to the field lo whip South
eru traitors and still have men enough at home
to vote down Northern Democrats. Tint's all
that was -euled.
The discussion continue! at length. Pending
the questian the Sen ite adjourned.
Hoise Mr. Conway siid he did not regard
the proposition, as now pre-ented, as having re
ceive! ilie assent require! by the Constitution.
Western Virginia was not a lawful Slate He
believed it was the intention of the President to
encourage State organizations in all Ihesecelei
Slates, but placing the assumption of the State
in the hand of a few individuals appointed
by the President was flagrant and unconstitu
tional The scheme wa- 1 evolutionary and ought
to beexposel to the reprobai'on of every loyal
citizen It would be an utter perversion of our
stem. It would iu effect concentrate all the
power of the Government in the hands of the
Kxecutive.
Mr Brown, of Virgini 1, repliel, arguing that
the ere tion o.'' the Sute of We-tem Virginia
was perfe-ily lawful aud constitutional. The
provision of the Constitution iu regard to the ad-un-sion
or erection of new Stales had been com
pliel with, und in ibis connection he qn.ited as
similar the preamble and act admitting Ken
tuckv, whit h was funned from p-.rt ol Virginia.
Precedents, he iu-i-ted, supported the new Slate
organization
Mr. Mil lory said: I understand that more thin
half the counties of Virginia were not te, te
. sentei in the Wheeling Legi-lature.
Mr Blair, of Virginia, asked if all the coun
i ties were not int iteiT
Mr Biown All were expressly invited.
Mr. Mallory Although they we-e invited, were
! not so me of them so completely withiu the con
trol of foreign Governments they could not send
1 representatives to the Legislature?
Mr. Brown I can t say whether the pe ple
were under intimidation or not. It is sufficient
to say they were invited to come. If they staid
away it was their fault, not ours. Ifiheywere
disloyal they could have no voice in the Legisla
tuie of Virginia.
Helbre Mr. Brown conclude! the morning hour
had expire!, when the !! ;- took up the special
! older authorizing Assessors and Collet tor- and
their assistants, under the lax law, to administer
oaths, kc.
Mr. Brown resumed his remarks in advocacy
of the bill for the admission of the Slate of West
ern Virginia. He stale! various considerations
why th Slate should lie admitted; the petple of
that section hail been struggling lor forty years
for a separate existence; they now had sixteen
regiments in ihe field obtained by volunteering,
not by draft.
Mr Colfax remarked that at the last session he
had great doubts as to the propriety of pasting
this bill, but on examination his mind was mad.
up that it ought to pass.
Mr. Crittenden appreciated the patriotism and
ardor of the people of Western Virginia, and the
desire ihey expressed to become a free people; but
in this matter he was not governed by feeling, but
by the principles of constitutional law. Congress
could not admit a new State out of the ancient
territory. without the consent of the old Common
wealth, and this had not been given. If Stales
should be made in the method proposed, new
ones could be made at ideasure, inesectit e of
the Constitution of Ihe United State
Mr. Edwards said be would sustain he loyal
people If there was no other way be would
seize the rebellious portions, hold them and their
territory, ant! repopulale them
Mr. Wvckliffe You seak about repopula
ting Virginia. What would you do with the
people? Would you exterminate, kill or make
slates of themT
Mr Edwards If necessary I would extermi
nate the whole people in order to preserve the
integrity of the U.ion.
Mr. Wickliffe Women and children?
Mr. Edwards No; they are uot found in
arms.
This unintentional pun gave rise to general
laughter.
They are entitle! to the protection of every
civilize! peipie of the world.
Mr. Mat nard sooke of his finding patriotic and
loyal people in Western Virginia begging to be
disenthral le! and relieve! from the dead carcass
of Eastern Virginia. It would be unjust to keep
them waiting until our armv should comel the
other pari of the State to ohelience.
Mr. Stevens said it waa mockery to hold that
the Legislature of Virginia had ever assented lo
the new State. With his consent the Union could
never be restored as it was under the Constitution
with slavery.
Without concluding the House adjourned.
W asiiimoTO, December 10.

a resolution, which was adopted, that the Secre
tary of War be directed to inform the House. 1st,
