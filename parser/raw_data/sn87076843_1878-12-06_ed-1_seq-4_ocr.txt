enjoyment of health by our people -ly
ha, however been Interrupted, utirtus; tho pa-t
peaton, by the prevalence of a fatal peatllence. the
Vellnwr lir Iti atn,A wit4i,tna nf 11, flnnthrn
Statea, creatine an emergency which called for
Srompt and extraordinary meaanrea of relief. The
icane appeared a ao epidemic at New Urban
and at other placea on tho Lower MlaalnalppLaoon
after midsummer. It was rapidly apread by fuel
tives from the Infected cities and towns, arid md
not disappear until early In November. Tho Statea
of Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee have suf
fered eeverely. About 100, (HK) caes are believed
to have occurred, af which about 20.000, accord
ing to Intelligent estimates, proved fatal. It la lm
possible to estlmato with any approach to ac
curacy the loss to the country occasioned by thla
epidemic. It Is to be reckoned by the hnndred
millions of dollar. The suffering and desti
tution that resnlted excited the deepest evmpathy
In all part of the Union. PhrsMlana and nurses
hastened from every quarter to the assistance of
the atnicted communities. Voluntary contribu
tions of money and supplies, In cve'rr needed
form, were speedily and genurouslv furnished.
The Government was able to respond In onii
mean. a to the call for help, by providing tents,
medicine and food for the sick and destitute, the
requisite directions for the purpose being given, in
the confident expectation that this action of the
Executive would receive the sanction of Congress.
About 1.K00 tents, and rations of tho value of
about I'ifi.OOO, were sent tocitlesand towns which
applied for them, full details of which will be fur
nished to
NATIONAL SANITARY ADMINISTRATION.
The fearful spread of this pestilence has
awakened a very general public sentiment in favor
of National saniuiry administration, which shall
not only control quarantine, but have the sanitary
supervision of internal commerce in times of epi
demics, and hold an advisory relation to the State
and municipal health authorities, with power to
deal with whatever endangers the public health,
and which the municipal and State authorities are
nnable to regulate. The National Quarantine act,
approved April 20, 1878. which was passed too
late In the last aesslon of Confess to provide tho
means for carrying It into practical operation dur
ing the past season, Is a step in the direction hero
Indicated. In view nf the necessity for the most
effective measures, by quarantine and otherwise,
for the prutnetion of our seaports, and tho country
generally, from this and other epidemic, it Is rec
ommended that Congress give to the whole sub
ject early and careful consideration.
CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS AT THE SOUTH.
The permanent pacification of the country by
the complete protection of all citlr.en In every
civil and political right continue to be of para
m nnt Interest with the great body of onr people.
Every step In this direction Is welcomed with
pnbllc approval, and every Interruption of ateady
and uniform progress to the desired consummation
awakens general uneasiness and wide-spread con
demnation. The recent Congressional elections
have furnished a direct and trustworthy test of the
advance thus far mado in the practical establish
ment ofthe right of suffrage, secured by the Con
stitution to the liberated raco In the Southern
Slates. All disturbing influences, real or Imag
inary, had been removed from all of these States.
Tiiu three Constitutional amendments, which
conferred freedom and equality of civil ana politi
cal rights upon the colored people of the South,
were adopted by the concurrent action of
the great body of good citizens who main
tained the authority of the National Govern
ment and the integrity and perpetuity of the
Union at such a cost of treaure ana life, as a wise
and necessary embodiment in the organic law of
the lust result of the war. The people of the form
er slave-holding States accepted these results, and
envo, in every practical form, assurancos that the
Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments,
and laws passed In pursuance thereof, should. In
f;ood faith, be enforced, rigidly and Impartially, In
etter and spirit, to the end that the humblest citi
zen, without distinction of race or color, should,
nnder them, recelvo full and equal protection In
person and property and In political rigbta and
privileges. By these Constitutional amend
ments, the Southern section of the Union
obtained a large Increase of political power in
Congress and In the Electoral College, and the
country justly expected that election would pro
ceed, as to the enfranchised race, upon the same
circumstances of legal and Constitutional freedom
and protection which obtained ia all the other
States of the Union. Tho friends of law and order
looked forward to the conduct of these elcctious,
as offering to the general judgment of the country
an important opportunity to measure the degree in
which the right of suffrage could be exercised by
the colored people and would be respected by their
fellow-citizens; but a more general enjoyment cat
freedom of suffrage by the colored people, and a
more just and generous protection of that freedom
by the communities of which they form a part,
were generally anttclpnted than the record of the
elections aiscioses. in some of those State In
which the colored Deoule have been unable to
moke their opinions felt In the elections, the
rvsun is niaiuiy uue io innuences not easily
measured or remedied by legal protection; but in
the States of Louisiana and South Carolina at largo,
and lu some particular Congressional Districts out
aide of those Slates, the records of the elections
seem to compel the conclusion that the rights of
the colored voters have been overridden, and their
participation In the elections not permitted to be
either general or free.
It will be lor tbc Congress for which these elec
tions were held to make such examinations Into
their conduct as mav he appropriate to delermiuu
the validity ot the claims ui members to their seats.
In the meanwhile it become the duty of the
Executive and Judicial Departments of the Gov
ernment, each In ita province, to Inquire into and
punish violations of the lawa of the United Stale
which have occurred. I , can but repeat what
I said in this connection In my last
message, that whatever authority rest
w.th me to tht end I shall not heaitato
to put forth, and I ara unwilling to forego a re
newed appeal to the Legislatures, the court, the
Executive authorities, and the people of the Statea
where these wrong nave been perpetrated, to
give their assistance toward bringing to Justice th
offender and preventing a repetition of the Crimea.
No means within my power will he spared to ob
tain a full and fair Investigation of the alleged
Crimea, and to secure the conviction and Juat pun
ishment rf thegulltr.
It is to be observed that th principal appropria
tion made for the Department of Justice at the last
session contained the following cluttse: " And for
defraying the expenses which may be Incurred In
tho enforcement of the act approved Feb. 2K,
1X71, entitled 'An act to amend an act approved
May HO. 1870. entitled An act to en.
force the right of citizen of the United States to
vote in the several Hiatea of the Union, and for
other purposes,' or auy acta amendatory thereof or
supplementary thereto.1'
It is ihe opinion of the Attorney-General that the
expenaea oi tuese proceedings will largely exceed
the amount which was thus provided, and I rely
confidently upon Congress to make adequate ap
propriations to enable, tho Executive Department
io enforce the lawa.
I respectfully nrge npon yonr attention that the
Congressional elections, lu every district. In a very
imnortaut sense, are Justly a matter of political
Interest and concern throughout the whole coun
try. Each Slate, every political party, la entitled
to the share of power which la conferred by the
legul and Constitutional suffrage, it Is the right
of every citizen, possessing the qualifications pro
scribed by law, to cant one unlntlinldaled ballot,
and to have bis ballot honestly counted.
Ho long aa the exercise of this power and the en
joyment of this right are common and equal,
practically as well as formally, submission to the
results ol the suffrage will be accorded loyally aud
cheerfully, and all the departments of Government
will feel the true vigor or lha popular will thua ex
pressed. No temporary or administrative interests
of Government, however urgent or weighty, will
ever displace th zeal of onr people In defense of
the primary right of citizenship. They under
stand that the protection of liberty requires tho
maintenance, in full vigor, of tho manly methods
of free speech, freo proas, and free suffrage, and
will sustain the full authority of Government to
enforce the lawa which are framed to preserve
these inestimable right. The material progresa
and welfare of the Statea depend on the protection
afforded to their citizeua. There can be no peace
without such protection, no prosperity without
fieace, and Ihe whole country ia deeply Interested
u the growth and prosperity of all its parte.
While the country haa not yet reached complete
unity of feeling and reciprocal confluence between
the commnnitlue ao lately and ao seriously es
tranged, I feel an absolute assurance that the ten
dencies are in that direction, and with increasing
Jorco The power of public opinion will override
all political prejudices, and all sectional or State
attachments, In demanding that all over our wide
territory the name aud character of citizen of the
United Statea shall mean one and the aame thing,
aud carry with them unchallenged security and re-

allowed for the preparation and arrangement ot
the contributions of our citizen to this great Ex-
Soaition was well employed in energetic and Ju
icioua effort to overcome this disadvantage.
These effort, led and directed by Ibe Comlssioner
General, war remarkably successful, and the ex

creditable and gratifying in scope and character.

Government ha officially an
nounced the termination of the iusnrrectlon In Cu

Island. Confident expectations are expressed of a
revival of trade and prosperity, which It Is earn
estly hoped may prove wall-founded. Nnmerou

Incident of the long-continued hostilities. Home

TREATY WITH ITALY.
The treaty made with Italy. In regard to recipro
cal Consular privilege, haa been duly ratified aud
proclaimed.
OTHER EUROPEAN POWERS.
No questions or grave importance harts arlaan
with any other of the European Power.
JAPAN AND CHINA.
The Japanese Guerument has nenn deslrons of t
revision of su h pnna of ita treattea with foreign
powera aa relate to commerce, and. It la nnder-
aiooti, nas addressed to earn or tne treaty rower
a rcaocsl to open negotlatlona with that view. The
United States Government ha been Incltued to
regard the matter favorably, whatever restric
tions npon trsde with Japnn are found injurious to
that people cannot but affect injuriously Nation
holding commercial Intercourse w 1th them. Japan,
after along period of seclusion, tins within Ihe
punt few years made rapid strides In thn path of
enlightenment and progress, and, not unreasona
bly, !a looking forward to the time when h.T rela
tions with the Nation of F.iiroiio and America
shall be assimilated to thoso which they hold with
each other. A treaty looking to tb.a end hits been
made which will be submitted for the considera
tion of Ibe Henatn.
After an Interval of several years, Ihe Chinese
Government h'is agnin sent envoys to the United
Slates. They have been received, and a perma
nent Legal Ion la now established here by that Gov
eminent. It in not doubted ihst this step will be
of ndvnnlagc to both Nations In promoting friendly
relations aud removing causes of dlnVreuce. The
treaty with the Ssnionn Islands, having been duly
ratified and accepted on the part of both Govern,
nients. Is now lu operation, aud a survey and
soundings of tho hnrhor of Pago-Pago have been
made by a naval vessel of the United States, with
a view of Its occupation aa a navid station, if fouud
desirable lo the service.
RELATIONS WITH MEXICO.
Since the resumption of diplomatic relations
with Mexico, correspondence hus beeu opened and
still contluties between the two Governments upon
thn various questions which at one time seemed lo
endanger their relatluns. Whllu no lonnal agree
ment hits been reached as to tho troubles on tho
border, much has lieen done to repress and dimin
ish them. Tile effective force of United SiMlea
troops on the Itlo Grande, bv a strict and faithful
compliance with Instructions, has done
much to remove the sources of dispute,
and It is now understood that a like
force of Mexican troops on the other side of the
river, Is also making an energetic movement
agnlust the marauding Indian tribes. This Gov
ernment looks with the greatest satisfaction upon
every evidence ol strength in the National au
thority of .Mexico, and upon every effort out forth
to prevent or lo punish incursions njMin our terri
tory. Keluctant to assume any action or attitude
In the control of these Incursions, by military
movements across the border, not imperatively de
manded for Ihe protection of the lives and prop
erly of our own citizens, I shall take the earliest
opportunity. Consistent with thn nninor ittuehiip.m
of this plain duty, to recognize the ability of the
jHcxituii uuvcrumcui to restrain etiecttveiy viola
tions of our territory. It Is nronnsed tn hold lievr
year an International Exhibition in Mexico, and
It Is believed that Iho display of the agricultural
and manufacturing products of the two Nations
will tend to better understanding and increased
commercial Intercourse between iheir people.
SOUTH ANU CKNTHAL AMERICAN KZPL'RLICS.
With Brazil, and the Rcnnhllra of Central and

course. Diplomatic relations have been resumed

and I have, after careful examination, given a de
cision upon It.
NAVAL EXPEDITIONS.
A naval expedition mi the Amazon and Madeira
River has brought back information valuable
both for scientific and commercial purposes. A
like expedition Is about visiting the const of Af
rica and the Indian Ocean. The reports of diplo
matic and consular officers In relation to the de
velopment of our foreign commerce, have fur
nished many facts that have proved of public in
terest, and have stimulated to practical exertion
tho enterprise of our people.
NATIONAL FINANCES.
The report of ihe Secretary of the Treasury fur
nishes a detailed statement of the openttiohs of
that Department of the Government, and of the
condition oi tne punitc nnancea.
1 he ordinary revenues from all sources for the
fiscal year ended June i)0. 1878. were $2.r7.70H.

revenue, for the year ending Juue ilO, 187H. of
t.-iini.uuu.
Tlie total receipts during the next fiscal vear,
ending June HO. 1880. estimated according to ex
isting laws, will be 2H4.r()0.000; and the estl
m ilea ordinary expenditures for tho same period
will be $-j:it(.H'J0.412.H8; leaving a surplus of
JJ8,17(l..')87.iiJ fi r that year.
In the foregoing etuttmcnta of expenditures,
actual ami estimated, no timoitut Is allowed for the
sinking fund provided for by the act approved Fell.
'25, 18H2, w hich requires "that 1 Per cent of the
entire debt of the Untied States shall be purchased
or paid within each fiscal year, to be set apart as a
sinking fund. There has been, however, a substau
lial compliance with the conditions of Ihe luw.
By Its terms, the public debt should have been re
duced between 18112 nnd the close ofthe last fiscal
year, $o 1 8.1101 .800.28; tho actual reduction of
the ascertained debt In that period tins been

a reduction, sluce the same date last year, ui 'j:j,
loO.tll7.HH. The progress made during the last year. In re
funding the public debt at lower rates of interest.
Is very gratifying. The amount of 4 per cent,
bonds sold during the present year prior to Nov.
23, 1878, is f 100.270,000, and it-percent, bonds,
commonly known as 5 'JOs, to an equal amount,
have been, or will be redeemed as calls mature.
It has been the policy ofthe Department tn
place the 4 per cent, bond within easy reui h of
every citizeu who desires to invest his suvius,
whether small or great, in tneae securities. The
Secretary of the Treasury recommends that the
law be so modified, that small aumn may be In
vested, and that through the Poetottices, or other
ageuia of the Government, thef reest opportunity
may be given In all parts of the country for surb
Investment.
The best mode suggested Is, that the Depart
ment be authorized to Issue certificates of depos
it ofthe denomination of $10, baring Interest at tho
rate of S. tlli per cent, per aunuin and convertible
at any time within one year after their Issue Into
the 4 per-cenL bonds authorized by Ibe Hefiiud
lug act, and to b issued only In exchange fur
United State notes sent to the Treasury by mall
or otherwise. Such a provision of law, supported
by suitable regulations, would enable any person
readily, without cost or risk, to convert bis money
Intoau liitereHt-hcariug security of the Uuiteu
Slates, and the money so received could bo applied
to ihe redemption of 0-per-ceut. bouds.
Tie coinage of gold during the last fiscal year
was $!V2,7ilrt.KO. Tho coinage of silver dollara,
uialer the act passed Feb. 28, 1878, amounted on
the 2!id of November, 1878, to 10.814.550. of
w hich amount $4 084.047 are In circulation, and
the balance. (14.820,003, ia tlll lu the possession
of ihe Government.
With views unchanged with regard to the act
under which the coinage of silver proceeds, it haa
been the purpose of ibe Secretary faithfully to exe
cute law. and to afl'ord a fair trial to the measure.
In the present tliianrlal condition of the country,
I am persuaded that the welfare of legitimate busi
ness and Industry of every description will be
bcAt promoted by abstaining from all attempts to
make radical changea In the existing financial
legislation. Let it be understood that duriug the
comlug year the business of the country will lis
undisturbed by governmental Interference with the
laws a:lecting it, and wo may confidently expect
that the resumption of specie pavmeuta, which
wiil take place at the appointed time, will he suc
cessfully and easily maintained, aud that it will bo
followed by a healthful aud enduring revival oi
business prosperity
Let the healing "Influence of time, the inherent
energies of our people, and the boundless resources
of our country, have a fair opportunity, aud rellel
from present dllliculliea will surely follow.
WAR REPORT.
Tho report of the Secretary of War showa that
the army has been w ell and economically supplied,
that our small force baa boen actively employed,
and liai laithfully performed all the service re
quired of it. The moral of the army haa im
proved, and the number of desertion ha materi
ally decreased duriug tho year.
The Secretary recommends:
1. That a pension be granted to the widow ol

In providing for thcPostal Service, the following
questions are presented: Should Congress annual

THE INDIANS.
The annnal reports of tlie Secretary of the Inte
rior and of tbc Commissioner of Indian All'nlrs,
preseut an elaborate account of tho present condi
tion of the Indian tribes, and of that branch ofthe
public service which ministers to their interests,
Whilo the conduct of the Indians, generally, has
been orderly, aud their relations with their neigh
bors friendly and peaceful, two local disturbances
have occurred, which were deplorable In their
character, but remained, happily, confined to a com
paratively small number of lndlnns. The discon
tent among tho Bannocks, w hich led first to some
acts of violence on the part of some members of
the tribe and finally to the outbreak, appears to
have been caused b'v an Insufficiency ol food on
Ihe reservation, ana this Insufficiency to have been
owlug to Ihe inadequacy of the appropria
tion, made by Congress, to tht; wants
of the Indian's, at a time when the
Indians were prevented from sunolvine iho defi
ciency by hunting. After an arduous puisuit by
the troops of the United Siutes. and several en
gagements, the hostile Indians were reduced to
subjection, and Ihe larger part of them surrendered
themselves an prisoners. Iu this connection, 1 de
sire to call attention to the recommendation made
by the Secretary of the Interior, that a sufficient
fund be placed at thu disposal of thu Executive,
to be used, with proper accountability, at discre
tion, in sudden emergencies of the Indian Service.
The other case of disturbance was that of a hand
of Northern Chevennes who suddenly left their
reservation in the Indian Territory and marched
rapidly through the Statea of Knusna and Nebraska
in Ihe direction of their old hiillllug-gruuiida,
committing murders aud other crime on their
way. Prom documents accompanying the report
ot the Secretary of thu Interior, It appears that
this disorderly baud was as fully supplied with the
necessaries of life an the 4-700 other Indians who
remaiueu quietly on tnu reservation, and that tho
disturbance was caused by men of a restless and
mischievous disposition among the Indians them
selves. Almost tbe whole of this baud have sur
rendered to tbe military authorities, aud it in a
gratifying fact that, when some of them had taken
refuge in the camp ol the Hed Cloud Sioux, with
whom they had been in friendly relations, the
Sioux held them as prisoners and readily gave
them up to (he officers of the United States, thus
giving new proof of tho loyal spirit which, alarm
ing rumors to the contrary notwithstanding, they
have uniformly shown ever since the wishes Ihev
expressed at the council of September, 1877, hail
been complied with.
Both tbe Secretary ofthe Interior and the Sccro
lary of War unite In the recommendation that pro
vision be made by Congress for the organization
of a corps of mounted ''ludian auxiliaries," to be
under the control of the army, nnd to be used for
the purpose of keeping the Indians on their resor
vations and preventing or repressing disturbance
on their part. I earnestly concur lu thin recom
mendation. It Is belluved that the organization
of such a body of Indian cavalry, receiving a mod
erate pay from tho Government, would consider
ably weaken tho restless element among tho In
dians by withdrawing from if a number of voting
meu and giving them congenial employment un
der tbe Government. It being a matter 'of expert
ence that Indians in our pcrvice almost without
exception are faithful in the performance of the
duties assigned to them. Such an organization
would materially aid tbe army in the accomplish
ment of a task for which Its numerical strength ll
sometimes found Insutllpieut.
But, while tho employment of forco for tbe pre
vention or repression of Indian troubles Is of oc
casional necessity, and wise preparation should be
made to that eud, greater reliance must be placed
on humane and civilizing agencies for the ultimate
solution of what Is culled the Indian problem. It
may be very difficult, and require much patient ef
fort, to curb the unruly spirit of the savago Indian
to tho rustrniuts of civilized life, hut experience
shows that it is not iuiHsslble. Many of the
tribes which are now quiet and orderly and self
supporting w ere once as savage as any that at pres
eut roam over the plains or in tho mountains of
Ihe far West, and were then considered Inaccessi
ble to civilizing Influences. It mav he impossible
to raise them Inllv up to the level of the white
population of the United States: but wo sbuuld
not forget that they are the ahorigiues of the
country, aud called the soil their own on
which our people have grown rich, powerful and
happy. W e owe It lo them as a moral duty to
help them in attaining at least that degree of civ
ilization w hich they may ho ablo to reach. It la
nut only our duty It is also our Interest to do so.
Indians w ho have become agriculturists or herds
men, and feel an Interest in property, will thence
forth ceasu to he a w arlike aud disturbing element.
It Is also a well-authenticated fact that Indians are
apt to be peaceable aud quiet w hen their children
ate at school, and 1 am gratified to know, from tho
expressions of Indians themselves and from many
concurring reports, that there is a steadily Increas
ing desire, even among Indians belonging to com
paratively wild tribes, to have their children edu
cated. 1 Invite attention to the reports uf the Sec
retary of the Interior and tho Commission
er of Indian Affairs, touching tbo experiment,
recently Inaugurated, lu titklug fifty In
dian children, boys and glrla, from differ
ent tribes, to tbe Hampton Normal Agricultural
Institute, lu Vlrgiula, where they are to receive
au elementary English education and training in
agriculture and other useful work, to ho returned
lo their Iribea, alter Ihe completed course, as In
terpreters, instructors aud examples. It Is re
ported that tha officer charged with the selection
of those children might have had thousands ol
young Indians sent with him had it been possible
lo make provision for them. I agree with the Sec
retary of Ibe Interior lu saving that "the result of
Ibis Interesting experiment, If favorable, may be
destined to become an impoitaut factor in the ad
vancement of civilization amoiigtho Indians."
The question, w hether a change In Ihe control
of the ludian Service should be made, was, at the
last session of Congress, referred to a committee
fur Inquiry and report. Without desiring to antic
ipate tf ,it report, 1 venture tuexpress the hope that
lu the ueclslon of so Important a questiou, the views
expressed above may not he lost sight of,
aud that the decision, whatever It may be, will ar
rest further agitation of this subject, auch agita
tion being apt to produce a disturbing effect npon
Ibe service a well aa on th Iudlaoa themselves.

TIMBER ON THE PUBLIC LANDS.
to racom
meudatloua mad by tb Secretary of th Interior
with regard lo tb oreaervatlou of lb timber on
the public lauds of lb United Siatea. The pro
tection of the public property is pue of Ihe first du
ties uf the Government, tlie Department of the
Interior should, therefore, b euabled, by sufficient
appropriations, to enforce th law in that respect.
But this matter appear atiU more Important aa a
question of public economy. Th rapid dnatruo
tlon of onr fnrestn Is an evil franght with the grav
est consequences, especlslly In the momitninotis
districts, where the rocky slopes, once denuded of
Iheir trees, will remain so forever. There the In
jury, once done, cannot be repaired. I tally con
cur with Ihe Secretary of the Interior In the opin
ion that, for thin reason, legislation touching the
public, limber In the mounlalnoua Siatea and Ter
Miotics of tho West, should bo especially well con
sidered, and Uiat existing laws, In which the do
strnctlon of the forests Is not sufficiently guarded
against, should be speedily modified. A general
law concerning Ibis Important subject, appears to
be ft matter of urgent pnbllc necessity.
AGRICULTURAL MATTERS.
From th organisation of the Government, the
Importance of encouraging, by all possible means,
the Increase of onr agricultural production haa
been acknowledged and urged upon the attention
of Congress and the people as the surest and readi
est means of Increasing our substantial ant endur
ing prosperity.
Thu words 'of Washington rn as applicable to
day as when, In his eighth annnal messace, he
said: " It Is not to bo doubted that with refereuce
either lo Individual or National welfare, agriculture
Is of primary Importance. Iu proportion as Nations
advance in population and other circumstance
of mtttrlty, till truth become more apparent,
and render's Ihe cultivation of the soil mora and
more an object of public patronage. Institutions
for promoting It grow up, supported JSy the public
purse aud to what object can it be dedicated with
greater propriety t Among the means which have
been employed to this end, none have been attend
ed with greater success than the establishment of
boarda composed of proper characters, charged
with collecting and diffusing Information, and en
abled, by premiums and small pecuniary aids, to
encouraue and assist the spirit of discovery and
lintirovement, thin pneciea of establishment con
trlb'itlng doubly to tlie lnrreao of Improvement
by stimulating to enterprise and experiment, and
by drawing to a common center the results every,
wncrn of individual aklll and observation, and
spreading them theuco over the whole Nation.
Experience accordingly hath shown that they are
very cheap luak'unieuts of Immense National
benefits." w
The great preponderanceof the agricultural oyer
any other interest in the United Siatea entitle U
to all the consideration claimed for It by Washing
ton. About one-half of the population of tbe
United Status la engaged In agriculture. The value
of the agricultural products of the United Statea
for the year 1878 in estimated Rt H,OOO.OI0,000.
The export of agricultural products for the year
1877. as appears from the report of the Bureau of
Statistics, were $524,000,000. The great extent
of onr country, with Its diversity of soil and cli
mate, enahlos us toprodnce within our own borders,
and by our own labor, not only the neenssarl-s, but
most ofthe luxuries that are consumed in cilllr.cd
countries. Yet, notwithstanding our advaotagca
of soil, climate and Intercommunication, it ap
pears from the ntntistical statements tn tho report
of the Commissioner of Agriculture, that we im
port annually from foreign landa many millions
of dollars' worth of agricultural products which
could be raised In our own country.
Numerous questions arlso in the practlcoof ad
vanced agriculture which can only be answered by
experiments, often costly and sometimes fruitless,
which are bevoud thenieansof private Individuals.
and are a just and proper charge on the whole
Nation for the benefit, of the Nation. It In good
policy, especially In time of depression and un
certainty In other business pursuits, with a vast
area of uncultivated, and hence unproductive terri
tory, wisely opened to homestead settlement, lo
encourage, by everv proper and legitimate means,
the occupation and tillage of thesoil. The efforts of
tbe Department of Agriculture to stimulate oldand
Introduce new agricultural industries, lo improve
the quality and Increase theqnantlty of our p rodt .eta.
to determine the value of old or establish the im
portance of new methods of culture, are worthy ol
your currful and lavorable consideration, anil' as

Selling One's Head.
Tho celebrated linguist, Cardinal
Mezzofanti, was bo generous in alms
giving that he did not leave mone;
enough to bury him. His generosity
even persuaded him to sell his head to
adorp. a phrenologist's cabinet.
Mezzofanti' g fame as a linguist had
long been known to a certain professor
of phrenology, who thought that the
Cardinal's head would.vividly illustrate
the organs of language. Accordingly,
he called on the man who knew some
thing of all the languages of the earth,
and after a little delicate circumlocu
tion, asked him what sum he would
take for his skull, after his death.
The Cardinal, having no faith in
phrenology, dismissed the man rather
roughly. Just then a woman came to
beg for money. He had not a cent, but
his heart was touched. Calling back
the phrenologist, be said:
" On second thoughts I am inclined
to treat with you for my skull, but it
will bo dear. I am not sure that there
is such another in the world."
The bargain was made and Mezzo
fanti gave the money to the woman.
But after several months, the Cardinal,
etting tired of carrying on bis shoul
ers a head belonging to another per
son, bought it back.
"My business is talk," said a
stump speaker. "I deal in words."
"Yes," said a voice in the crowd,
" and as long as I have known you
your place of business has never been
ftlosetl."

It appear from the report of the General of

The reports of the Quartermaster-General

concur In allowing that the army haa been
well and economically subsisted and clothed,
while the character of the rank and file ha
been materially Improved. Orent care haa
been exercised Intheaelectlnnof recruits, and,
as one of the gratifying; results, the number of
desertions has been considerably reduced, the
total decrease below the number last year
being The aggregato number of deser
tions during each of the past six years has
been as follows :

Notwithstanding the Imtvrovemont. annnrent

The Increase of onr force In the vicinity of

for sometime has been pursued In dealing
with marauders Invading our soil from Mex
ico, have produced the result predicted In mv
report of one year ago. Although the people
of Texas have not been exempt from these
Incursions during the year, and several of
tnem have been attended by heartrending
atrocities, yet they have been' fewer In num
ber than during any year for a long period, and
within the paat four months almost perfect
quiet has prevailed. A considerable Mori pnn
force has been sent to the vicinity of the bor

Infesting t hat region, and the avowed purpose
of the Mexican Government ia to put a stop

Annual Report Secretary of the
Navy.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.
The Secretary of the Navy, In his annual re
port, says since his former report the condi
tion of the Navy has licen considerably lra
oroved. There are now In commlslon twenty
eight cruising ships, one steamboat and five
sailing vessels, all in condition for active serv
ice except the Gettysburg. There are six ves
sels, Including one monitor, which can he
made ready for sea In a few months. Besides
these there are thirteen needing more exten
sive repairs, but. all can be put in thorough
condition with the present appropriations and
those asked for the next fiscal year. In case
of jiece8ity ninety-one war vessels of all
classes, Including monitors, can be put in
service. The Secretary submits the following
estimates with the remark that the Depart
ment has not felt itself justified In going be
yond the estimates of the last fiscal vear:
Pay of Navy, 7,a50,0O0; pay of civil estab
lishment in navv yards, fISO.o.W; Ordnance
and Torpedo Corps, 1273,000; coal, hemp and
equipment, S00.000; navigation and naviga
tion supplies, 1 104,500; hydrographic work,
40,000; naval observatory nautical almanac,
$43,800; repairs and observation of vessels,
1,500,000; steam machinery tools, etc., S00,
000; provisions for navy, $1,200,000; repairs of
hospitals and laboratories, 30,000; surgeons'
necessaries and naval hospital fund, W5,000;
contingent expenses of the department and
bureaus, $105,000; naval academy, $ise,l!4:
support of marine corps, $$02,378; naval
asylum at Philadelphia, $IS0,S09; maintenance
of yards and docks, $440,000. repairs, etc., of
the navy yards, $375,000; total, $14,502,385.
From the tables contained in the reiort, it
will, the Secretary savs, be seen that the total
estimates of the last tiscal year, Including tlie
amount appropriated for deficiencies of the
previous year were $I7.40S,392. Afterdcdtict
ing deficiencies of 1S77 and 1S78, which were
$4,101,478, the amount chargeable to the ex
penditures of the year was $13,306,914, which
was $767,1!I9 less than tbe actual expenBC of
the previous year and $4,928,677 less than the
expenditures, including deficiencies, of that
year, and $4,630,430 less than the expendi
tures of the vear ending June 30, 1876.
Secretary Thompson discusses the relation
of the navy to commerce, and savs our rapidlv
increasing exports have demonstrated that
this country must become the greatest oro
ducing country in the world. The areaof our
improved lands is annually enlarging, keeping
pace with our rapidly increasing population,
and giving assurance that the surplus over
agricultural and manufacturing products will
become correspondingly greater every year.
The consequent skill of our manufacturers,
artisans and laborers will, in the future of our
history, be called into still further requisi
tion, and as experlenoe has shown that no na
tion can afford to leave its commerce un
guarded upon the seas, the duty of protecting
ours is now greater and more urgent than it
has ever been before.
The Secretary shows our dependence upon
foreign nations for the transportation of onr
surplus productions to the markets of the
world, and says : If this condition of affairs
is to continue our industrial interests must
be left to suffer still further injury. Our Iron,
coal and timber will decrease in value; the
enormous freights we now pay, will continue
to press upon producers our surplus exports;
our merchant vessels will, In the end, be en
tirely driven from the sea. If, on the other
hand, the Government shall adopt such
measures as shall put the country In a posi
tion to reap the full benefits of its commer
cial enterprise and secure the profits of our
own carrying trade, which properly belongs to
us by means of such fostering care as the Na
tional Government alone has the power to
give, then our navy should have such strengt h
and character given to it that it will be able
to furnish protection to our commerce when
ever it may be needed.
The remainder of the report is devoted
largely to an account of the condition of the
various navy yards of the country, and the
Naval Academy and torpedo service, sugges
tions regarding training schools for boys, etc.

We Believe
That If everyone would use Hop Bitters free

ery In the world; and people are fast finding
this out, whole family Keeping well at a
trifling cost by lu use. We advise all to try
It U. A., SochetUr, T.
A Woman's Logic.
"It Is useless to take medicine. I shall feel
bet'er to-morrow. Besides, I need the money
to get that lovely new hat. My old one Is such
a fright, snd people will look more at my bon
net than they will at my face. I will Walt till
1 feel worse before I spend any money for
medicine." The new bonnet la purchased and
fifty other feminine necawn-rini fn the form of
ribbons, laces, brooches, etc. Meanwhile the
lady's face becomes every day paler and thin
ner, and her body weaker, until disease has
gulned so firm a foothold In her system, that
the most thoroutch, and ofttlmes a long and
tedious, course of treatment ia necessary to
restore her to health. Ladies, attend to your
health before you even think of apparel. A
fresh, blooming face In plain bonnet Is much
handsomer ami far more attractive to yonr
jentletnen friends, than a pain-worn, diseased
face in tbo most elaborate and elegant hat
your milliner could dovi-e. Dr. Pierce's Fa
vorite Prescription is everywhere acknowl
edged to be the standard remedy for female
complaints and weaknesses. It is sold by
dui,'glsts.
