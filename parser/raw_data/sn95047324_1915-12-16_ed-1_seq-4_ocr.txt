In the opinion of the Eagle, the
word "preceding," as used in the
above section, renders the whole
taw foolish and inoperative.
The Herald hack noticed that
word in the newspaper publica
tions of IW law, out thought it
was a printer's error and, there
fore, gave it no attention, Bui
the Eagle, believes that the law
contains that identical word and
that it is placed right where it ap
pears in the section above quoted.
If the official copy of the law,
signed by the presiding officers
f the house and the senate and
y the governor, now on file in
Tallahassee, should show that the
word "preceding" is used as ap
pears above, then, of course, the
'aw is a piece of utter foolishness

W. E. Griffis, a capable newspa

Lee and DeSoto counties, has
bought and taken charge of the

accusing Gilchrist of trying to
"swipe" the vote of Perry Wall's
kindred in Hamilton county.
Now what obscures our com
prehension is just this considera

lot bonds, or, what is the same
ihing, not salable as such; they
ire only handsome pieces of lith-
igraphed paper, worth DerhaDs
15 cents per hundred, and not e-
nough profit from the sale of such
uticles could be realized to drain

lone, consequently, and the State
vill be failing to carry out its es-
ablished policy of draining the
'Glades, to which it has long been
lommitted, and which MUST- be
sompleted some day. A scheme

'ailure seems good to us.
In the second place, The Her-
ild doubtless knows that farmers

Surely Editor Hanna knows
that the legislature authorized the
State Drainage Board, to issue
