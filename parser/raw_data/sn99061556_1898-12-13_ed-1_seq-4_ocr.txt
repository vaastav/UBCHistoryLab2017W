The "Christian Scientists" are coming
in for a good deal of attention from th
public in this country and England
through the death of parties subjected to
their quackery. The indictment of the
parties responsible for the death of Hal
oid Frederick, the novelist, has been dis
missed from an English court, on the
ground that they did what they thought
heist under the circumstances, which
in that particular case consisted of read
in jr a book, while Mr. Frederick was dy
in.ir. If the same course is pursued by the
American courts the "Christian Scien
tist" method of exit may become quite
popular in this humbug-loving country.
What has become of the festive Jap,
the Fmperor-William-IIot-Spur of the
Orient? We used to hear much of him
as "a factor" in the Far East and as a
fellow with chips on his shoulders who
would have to be gingerly handled and
consulted on all occasions. Yet the
United States has gobbled up the Philip
pines under his nose, and the powers
have divided China without a word to
him. lie seems to be left to the old and
discredited method of buying what he
wants or going without.
Editor Manly is to settle in New York
and re-establish the Daily Record. It is
to be regretted that he did not make
it Boston or Philadelphia, but New York
will do. If the maudlin "philanthropists"
of the metropolis, do not allow him
to starve, and the chances are all that
they will tire of him speedily, sooner
or later he will do unto New York as
he did to Wilmington. And there is
much rope in New York and many shot
Sims.
The Hebrew Union at its meeting in
Richmond did not take any stock in the
so-called Zionist movement. This is icr
what was to be expect e .1. The American
Jew may have a strain ot mysticism
him, but he is altogether to i practical
a person not to see 'lie illusory nature
of any hope of re-colomzki g the ,Tevs i?i
Palestine. It is a pretty Jre.im, nothing
more.
Mrs. Browning evidently did not
have the United States, which started
the war for humanity and gobbled up
everything in sight, in mind when sne
wrote that:
A nation may act
Unselfishly shiver a lance
(As the least of her sons may, in fact).
And not for a cause of finance.
As our correspondent points out, th:
meeting of the Baptist State Convention
in Greenville this year brings out a
contrast in which ev--y. member of
that church can feel a just pride th.
contrast between a small beginning1 and
a truly great accomplishment. The
years between lS3f, the year in which
the first State Convention met at Green
ville, and lStS, when the convention is
in session there again, have been years
of marvelous growth in the power and
membership of the Baptist denomiation.
At this the members of all denomina
tions will rejoice with the Baptists.
Within the period mentioned there has
been' not only a jrreat numerical in
crease in the Baptist church, but its
literary, educational and charitable in
stitutions have been founded and built
up to their present high state of useful
ness and efficiency. Wake Forest Col
lege, that is doing such excellent work j
for the higher education of Baptist
young men, a number of preparatory
schools throughout the State, the or
phanage at Thomasville, the Biblical
Recorder and other papers of the denom
ination within the State, have all been
the work of the church since the State
convention was organized. The Bap
tist Female University hero, now well
on toward completion, should not be
omitted from a summary of the outward
evidences the denomination has given of
the faith that is in it.
If a sense of elation pervades the
convention at Greenville when it survey?,
the work of its hands since it first bo-
i came an organization, none, certainly.
will feel that it is not permissable. anl
that body may well find in its past in
spiration to even greater achievement
hereafter.
One of the most encouraging signs of
the times is that, not only the Baptists,
but all churches are alert to meet the
increasing opportunities that each y?ai
brings thorn.

Japan is reported to have offered two
hundred million dollars for the Philip
pines. If this be true the Y'ankee's
reputation for taking in all the good
bargains that come his way should

Chicago's threat to lynch all aldermen

We pointed out at the time the dec
laration of the President's message re
garding the future American policy in
the Far East as being one of the most
important parts of ihe document, indi
cating as it did an intention to take an
active part in Chinese affairs.
That the British Government regards
it as tantamount to a declaration in fa
vor of England's Chinese policy is
shown by this utterance of the Hon.
Joseph Chamberlain, in a speech at
Wakefield:
"I -dare say yoti have observed the
pregnant passage in the recent message
of President McKinley to the United
Siates Congress, the passage referring to
the important interests of America in
the Far East, in which he declares that
these interests shall not be prejudiced
by exclusive treatment. That is a note
worthy passage, and without being a
prophet I think I shall not be too san
guine if I say that in the future we shall
not stand alone as guardians of the
'open door. "
All of this is the more interesting in
view of the dispatch, printed elsewhere,
from the American Minister to Siam.
stating that Russia is about to openly
defy England's demand for an ''open
door" in China, by shutting other na
tions out of the Manchuria province.
"Whether Russia will persist in this
policy if the United States supports
England, and what England will do in
that event, is a matter for interesting
conjecture and more or less purturba
tion to Americans.

will meet in Raleigh. December 27th and

cational meetings in Raleigh during the
same week, viz: County Supervisor's
Annual Meeting, Asoc;ation of Ac r de

education is one of the questions or' the

We hope that all of these noc' ngs

Mr. Westcott has given an entirely new
creation in fiction. '"David Ilarum" is
an original American whoso eccentrici
ties and dry humor bring out his nobility.
The Critic's review will be approved by
all who have read the book: "Mr.
Westcott has done for central New York
what Mr. Cable, Mr. Pago, and Mr.
Harris have done for different parts of
the South, and what Miss Jewett and
Miss Wiikins are doing for New Eng
land and Mr. Hamlin Garland for the
West. 'David Ilarum' is a master de
lineation of an American typo. There
is life, with all its joys and sorrows.
David Ilarum' lives in these pages as
he will live in the mind of the reader.
He deserves to be known by all god
Americans; he is one of them in bound
less energy, in large heart edness, in
shrewdness, and in humor."
