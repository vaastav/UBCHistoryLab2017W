It may be well to remember that
there is considerable territory in the
United States outside of Ohio.
Parhans Tatt thought the next pres­
ident might like to have a pueif justice
of bin own party administer the oath
ot office to the president.
Taft's message recommends econ­
omy. A good suggestion, but incom­
patible with a high protective tariff,
whose very nature breeds extrava^
gance. __________
Before any of Taft's appointees for
the supreme bench get through, their
records will be well ventilated. So the
insurgent and democratic senators
claim. Which is well.
lieoort is that Taft will play Santa
Clans for Tawney by making the soon
to be
ex-congressman
secretary of the
interior to succeed Ballinger. But why
should Ballinger quit. He has been
"exonerated.''
Dr. Boehm of St. Cloud has been
indicted for arsun, it being claimed
he burned hi$ automobile for the in­
surance. Those who know the
doctor will not believe any such charge
till it is proven.
Postmaster General Hitchcock wants
the magazines to pay high postage.
He does not appear to have much to
say about the extortionate rates paid
the railroads for carrying the mails.
And of course, the magazines have
been guilty of muckraking.
Senator Nelson is getting to be an
old man, but he is still a great politi­
cian, and a smooth one, and to get the
seat Knute has long warmed away
from him, will not be an easy task if
he objects. He made a mistake in
getting into the Ballinger muss, but
Jhe hasn't lost his cunning yet.
In the death of Peter Virnig of Bub,
who passed away last Friday, the
county loses one of its best citizens.
Mr. Virnig had been confided with
public trust in his own community
and commissioner district, and was
-k-aO wii as an honest, conscientious
official, always looking to the welfare
of bis constituents.
The new president of the state un­
iversity will be the highest paid
public official in Minnesota, and yet
the reccompense will be small if the
does the work that ought to be done
and that it is expected be will do. He
is still young, comparatively speaking,
able, vigorous and broad minded. It
"ooks as if the regents had chosen
wisely and^well.
The New Jersey bosses are angry at
Woodrow Wilson tor insisting that
legislature stand by party pledges and
the party nominee for U. S. senator.
The angrier the bosses get, the more
pleased the people will be. If Wilson
shows that he believes in progressive
democracy, and bis work as governor
will show1 it, lie will deserve well of
the democratic party, in spite of cer­
tain support be has, a support that is
not likely to stay with him it he be­
comes nnd acts really progressive.
1
be progressive republicans are going
to meet in state convention and adopt
a platform of principles. The case
here is somewhat behind other states,
but with good leadership there is no
doubt the real progressives oan make
things interesting politically.
Vigilance will be needed. In Otter
Tail county, Elmer Aiams, certainly
a progressive republican leader, did not
attend the meeting called to send
delegates to Minneapolis, Judging
from the list of delegates chosen, spine
of whom certainly have never shqwn
any inclination to be anything but the
most reactionary in deeds and words,
Adams knew the meeting would be
packed and hs stayed away. He was
not chosen as delegate. I he danger to
the insurgent cause in this state is in
incidents like these.
Perhaps under the new apportion
ment Morrison county may have a
chance to
"go
it alone," but it would
not be wise to believe that any such
act of justice will be done. For many
years this county has been made a
jotball ot partisan politics in legis­
lative matters, and it would be
strange if there were any change now.
At least the county should have the
privilege which so many counties
have, of choosing its representative oy
itself, even if linked with another
county in choosing a senator. We
would think this would be agreeable
to Crow Wing county also, This
might not please folks whose hope ot
election rests on a large majority of
their party when the two counties are
taken together, but it would be fair
and square. Messers. Brown and Bouck
will certainly lose nothing in advocat­
ing decent tieatment for this county,
and Senator Johnson would be found
ready and willing to co-operate.
CALL FOR PROGRESSIVE RE­
PUBLICAN CONVENTION.
The following, which is Signed by
republicans from all parts of tl&state,
is the call for the Progressive Re­
publican convention to. be held in
Minneapolis Jan 4,
To the Pxogressive Repuhli{^ans of
Minnesota
ICT-.M.
vrU'o
The, progressive republicans at
^miKftpta are
wagiflg ft
overnment atadjwpular rulel This if
_n uprising ot the peojrtethst Is
spontaneous And not the result of any
pre-arranged leadership or plan. It
springs from causes that are deep
seated and commOn to the whole state.
The voters, ot Minnesota ^are' driv­
ing special interests from the control
Of the state government. They are
driving business out ot politics and
politics out of business. They are
restoring to themselves the power
guaranteed in the state constitution.
The essentials of success in this
struggle comprise a complete organiza­
tion of all the people, together with
such progressive legislation as will
give the people equal opportunity
witft predatory interests.'
It is deemed wise and necessary
that progressive republicans from all
parts of the state shall convene for
careful consideration of thp best means
ot securing these desirable results.
With this purpose in view the pro­
gressive republican leagues of St.
Paul, Minneapolis and Stillwater
have, through a joint committee,
arranged for a convention to be held
in Minneapolis on the fourth day of
January, 1911,' and the banquet to be
held in St. Panl on the evening of the
same date. The committee signing
this call therefore extends an invita­
tion to the progressive republicans of
the state to be well represented at this
convention and banquet.
This is the first political convention
ever held in the northwest solely for
the purpose of considering political
principles. It is the hope of the
committee that every progressive re
publican in the state will co-operate
to make this movement a success.

MACVEAGH'S ANNUAL REPORT
Many Recommendations for Action by
Congress.
Washington, Dec. 9.—Currency re­
form extension of the scope of the
national banking laws, in the' event of
no immediate general changes in the
monetary system civil service retire­
ments a customs service free from
"practical"' politics businesslike meth­
ods in the daily transactions of the
government and a general abolition of
red tape wherever it clogs the wheels
of the government's business are
among the recommendations contained
in the annual report of Franklin Mac
Veagh, secretary of the treasury.
HIS ACCUSERS SCORED
Majority Report Exonerates Sec­|housewhen
retary of Interior.
Washington, Dec. 8.—Vindicating
Secretary of the interior Ballinger up­
on all the charges brought against him
and condemning his accusers as hav­
ing been inspired by a deep feeling of
animosity built upon a supposed dif­
ference in policy respecting conserva­
tion, a majority of the congressional
committee which investigated the so
called Ballinger-Pinchot case submit­
ted its report to congress.
After stating that the evidence pre­
sented related in the main to charges
of various kinds against Mr. Balliqeer
and that these came chiefly from two
sources—L. R. Giavis and Gilford Pln
chot—the majority announced the fol­
lowing conclusion:
"The evidence has wholly failed to
make out a case. Neither any fact
proved nor all the facts put together
exhibit Mr. Ballinger as being any­
thing but a competent and honorable
gentleman, honestly and faithfully
performing the duties of his high of­
fice with an eye to the public interest."
The report was signed by Senators
Knute Nelson, chairman Frank P.
Fliht, George Sutherland and Elihu
Root, and Representatives Samuel W.
McCall of Massachusetts, vice chair?
man Martin E. Olmstead of Pennsyl­
vania and Edwin Denby ef Michigan,
all Republicans.

HE little boy and the littl? girl I
sat at the breakfast table eat
in^ 'oatmeal and milk.
Their papa said to their mam-
ma: "A Christmas goose Is the best
thing there is. This year we mjust
have a Christmas goose."
The little girl looked up at the little
boy And smiled, and the little boy
smiled back.
After breakfast the little girl and
the little boy put on their caps and
held one of the *.^2
ribbons. The
Christmas goose
waddled along
proudly.
The guinea
hens piped, the
ducks quacked
and the hens
clucked when
they saw this
fine sight.
The little boy
and the little girl
led and drove
the proud Christ­
mas goose out of
the barnyard to
the green grove
where all the lit
tle Christmas
trees grow.
"We must have a Christmas tree for
onr Christmas goose," said the little
girl.
."WAIT A MINUTE.
CHRISTMAS GOOSE."
Yes, yes, Christmas goose," said the
little boy, "you wait right here for us.
Don't you muss your holly wreath,
and don't you muss your ribbons."
The proud Christmas goose waddled
gently to show how careful she would
be. The little boy and the little girl
ran away fast to get the things for the
Christmas tree.
The little girl brought back some
•ars of red and yellow corn and a
bunch of wheat and barley heads and
a pocketful of oats.
The little boy brought back two cab­
bages and a yellow pumpkin and some
grain. The Christmas goose became
so excited when she saw these things
that she waddled too fast.
"Walt a minute, Christmas goose!"
cried the little boy, and he placed his
thing* on the ground near the tree.
"It isn't quite time, Christmas
goose," cried the little girl, and she
fastened her things on the tree.
"Now, Christinas, goose." said the lit
tie girl, "we will go. and invite all your

The big. old, fat guinea hen shook
her head.
They meta big, old, fat white goose,
"Are you the Christmas goose?" ask
ed the little girl.
And the big, old, fat white goose
nodded her head and fluffed her feath­
ers and stepped proudly with her flat,
yellow, webbed feet.
"Oh, goody!" shouted the little boy.
"We've found our Christmas godse al­

"Oh, oh. oh! 1 know something."
said the little girl, and she ran to the
just as fast aa she could go.

Christmas Chimes In Many Climes.
Christmas is always a season of
good wishes and loving kindness.
In America almost all little children
hang up their stockings on Christmas
eve, to be filled by kind old Santa
Claus. In Germany they make more
of Christmas than we do in America.
Everywhere the Christmas tree is
nsed.
If a family is too poor to have a
whole tree, a single branch only will
stand in a conspicuous place, hung
with the few simple gifts.
A week before Christmas St. Nicho­
las visits the children to find out who
have been good enough to receive the
gifts the Christ Child will bring them
on Christmas eve.
It is a very usual thing.'to see on a
German Christmas tree, way up in the
very topmost branch, an image or doll
representing the Christ Child, while
below are sometimes placed other
Images representing angels with out*
spread wings.
After the tree is lighted the family
gather round it and sing a Christmas
hymn.
In England almost every one who
can do so has a family party on
Christmas eve. Young and old join in
the games, many of which belong
especially to Christmas time.
From the ceiling of one of the rooms
a large bunch of mistletoe is ,hung. If
any little maid is canght standing
nnder it the one who catches her has
a right to take a kiss from her rosy
lips.
In Holland the little Dutch girl puts
her wooden shoe in the chimney place
ready for gifts, just as the little Amer­
ican girl hangs up her stocking.
And so in some way sill over the
Christian world oh' the eve of the
twenty-fifth day pf December the
birth of onr Lord J£sns Christ is cele­
brated. Everywhere the Christmas
chimes are ringing out the message
the angels brought to' Bethleheih-r
"Peace on earth, good will to men."
