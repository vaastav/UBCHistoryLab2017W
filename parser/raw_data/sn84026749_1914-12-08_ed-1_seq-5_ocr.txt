Nations In Need.
It is of equal consequence that the
mtions whom Kurope has usually sup
i l;ed with innumerable articles of manu
facture and commerce of which they
are in constant need and without which
heir economic development halts and
slajirir still can now get only a small
.rt ot what they formerly imported
nd eagerly look to us to supply their
a' I- it empty markets Tnis Is particu-
ilv true of our own neighbors, the
Males great and small, of Central and
Hoath America. Their lines of trade
have hitherto run chiefly athwart the
j-eas not to our ports but to the ports
of Great Dr.ta n and of the older con
tinent of Europe I do not stop to in
iu're whj, or to make any comment,
on probable causes. What interests us
..ust now is not the explanation but .
the fact, and our duty and opportunitj
m the presence of It. Here are markets
which we must supplv, and we must
fnd the means of action. The United
States, this Kreat people for whom we
stk and act. should be ready, as
ever before, to serve 'tself and to serve
"anknd. ready with its resources, its
uorgies. Its forces of production, and
its means of distribution. ,
It is a verv practical matter, a mat
ter of ways and means. AYe have the i
resou-ces. but are we fully ready to use
them. And. if we can make ready what
we have, have we the means at hand
to distribute it? We are not fully read ,
neithir have we the means of distribu
tion. We are willing, but we are not
full able We have the wish to serve
and to serve greatly, generously: but
w-e are not prepared as we should be.
We are not readv to mobilize our re
sources at once We are not prepared
to ust them immediately and at their
best, without delay and without waste.
Io speak plainly

We have grOESly I

stunten and hindered the development
of our merchant marine. And now,

WILSON'S STAND
ON BIG BUSINESS
The President interpolated the
following paragraph in his
message as originally drawn:
"Our program of legislation
with regard to the regula
tion of business is now vir- !
tually complete. It has been
put forth, as we intended, as
a whole, and leaves no con
jecture as to what is to fol
low. The road at last lies
clear and firm before busi
ness. It is a road which ,it
can travel without fear or
embarrassment. It is the
road to ungfudged, unclosed
success. In it every honest
man, every man who be
lieves that the public inter
est is part of his own inter
est, may walk with perfect
confidence."
