OKLAHOMA BOOKS
BOOKS BORN AND BUILT in Oklahoma!
Yes, wo have Ihem. This is a new stato,
scarcely a dozen years old. but nevertheless
we have already a book-publishinjr house.
We, meaning Oklahoma, are beconiintr lit
erary. We are coming in out of the tall tim
ber and the short grass and wooing the Muses
Nine, as witnessed by Josh Leo's "Soldier
Rhvmes." and we are makino- literature of tlu
Indian folk-lore tales, as witnessed by
Toll's "Tales uf tho Lark Lotlges."
The author of the latter book is a Wyan
dotte Indian. He or is it she? employs the
quaint diction, a sort of dialect and yet hardly
a dialect, of the Wyandotte; and Hi" result is
more or less of a delight. The book is valuable
from a historical standpoint also.
Josh Lee is a young ex-soldier who went
abroad and now is leaching expression or
something in the University of Oklahoma.
While in the service he wrote his soldier
rhymes, and some of them evince a consider
able force in lyric swing and balladic move
ment. (
These two books are published by the liar
low Publishing Company at Oklahoma City,
also publishers of that sprightly periodical,
Harlow's Weekly. We welcome the new book
publishing house ami trust that it may find and
feature a further output of Oklahoma writing
talent from vear to year.
SOLDIERS LIKE FERRIS BILL j
PUBLICATIONS devoted to the interests ofj
men who fought in the army and navy dur-j
ing the late war are notifying the republican!
congress recently convened in regular session
that there can no longer be any doubt as toi
what these former soldiers and sailors expect
in the way of compensatory legislation. The.
recent convention of the American Legion,
which represents a large percentage of these j
men, made their wishes quite plain. ;
The legion, it may be said, approved a pro-
i gram that had been anticipated by Secretary of j
the Interior Lane and Representative Scott Fer-j
ris of Oklahoma, chairman of the tlemocraitc j
j congressional committee. Each of these one ;
'an important member uf the president's cabi-i
; net and the other an able legislator who is
; headed for the somite had studied the men's i
i needs and offered the fruits of their investiga-
dons in the form of bills. Tho measures they
proposed would have financed the pure-base of)
homes for soldiers and sailors either in the ooun-j
try or in the city as the men preferred. j
These bills lay for months in pigeonholes.
miring me special session ol congress, i lie re
publican pretext for their inertia was that they
wished to hear from the American Leirion.
The word has come and it js an approval of
I democratic proposals which, out of pure pai l i-!
sanship, were denied an opportunity to pass.!
Even if the bills are enacted in the regular i
session, six or eight months' time will have,
been lost. That is the penalty the fighters will j
have to bear because of political chicanerv.
. o
The National Press Association urges every
newspaper to publish in every issue for next
year a brief edilorial upholding constitutional
government and denouncing the bolshevistic
movement throughout the land. The Ardmore
ite is running such an editorial every day, right
now and for some weeks past. It was written
by tho late Abraham Lincoln, formerly of
Springfield. 111., later of Washington, D. 0.
UeiiJlt is the biggest little editorial we ever f ad,
too.

The Ardmoreite proposes a new drive.
. . . . Ah. what? Yes, a new drive. Put not
for funds. Not for cold cash, but for cold steel.
We propose that a drive against the gun-toter
be instituted in this city and county, and that
one or more guns be collected from each tot or,
the same to be stacked in a nice large high
heap in the middle of Central Park and burned,
('unit" right forward, now who'll volunteer as
chief gun-collector in this worthv drive? . . .
Yes?
