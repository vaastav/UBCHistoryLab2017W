and Monopolies Discussed.
-Washixgtos, Dec. 7. The Fifty
Fourth congress assembled for the short
session at noon to-day and soon after
committees from the house and
seriate waited on the president and in
formed him that they were ready to
receive an v communication he mi.ht
have to make and the president then
sent the following communication:
To tbe Coneress of the United States:
As representatives of the people in the legis
lative branch of their government you have as
sembled at a time when the strength and ex
cellence of our free institutions and the Btness
of our citizens to enjoy popular role have been
again made manifest. A political contest in
volving momentous consequences, fraught
with feverish apprehension and creating ag
gressiveness so Intense as to approach bitter
ness and passion, has been w.ieed throughout
our land ana aeiermineu uy me
and lndenendent suffrage, without disturbance
"of our tranquility or the least sign of weakness
In our national structure. When we consider
these incidents and contemplate the peaceful
obedience and manly submission which have
succeeded a heated clash of political opinions
we discover abundant evidence of a determi
nation on the part of our countrymen to abide
by every-verdlct of the popular will and to be
controlled at all times by an abiding faith in
the agencies established for the direction of
the affairs of theirenverntnent. Thus our peo
ple exhibit a patriotic disposition which en
titles them to demand of those who undertake
to make and execute their laws such faithful
and unselfish service in their behalf as can
only be promptei by a serious appreciation of
the trust and confidence which the acceptance
of public duty invites. In obedience to a con
stitutional requirement. I herein submit to the
congress certain Information concerning na
tional affairs, with the suggestion of such leg-
Islation as in my judgment Is necessary and
expedient. To secure brevity and avoid tire
some narration. I shttll omit many details con
cerning matters within federal control which,
though by no means unimportant, are more
profitably discussed in departmental reports.
I shall also curtail this communication by
omitting minute recital of many minor inci
dent connected with our foreign relations
which have hitherto found a place in executive
messages, but are now contained in a report of
. the secretary of state, which is herewith sub
. mined.
The Armenian Question.
At the outset of a reference to more impor
tant matters affecting our relations with foreign
powers It would afford me satisfaction if I
could assure the congress that the disturbed
condition of Asiatic Turkey bad during the
past year assumed a less hideous and bloody
aspect und that either as a consequence of the
awakening of the Turkish government to the
demands of human civilization, or as the re
sult of derisive action on the part of the great
nations having the right by treaty to Interfere
for too protection of those exposed to the rage
of mere blgolry and cruel fanaticism, the
shocking lea. tires or tne situation naa oeen
mitigated. Instead, however, of welcoming a
softening disposition or protective interven
tion, we have been afflicted by continued and
not unfrequent reports of the wanton destruc
tion of homex and the bloody butchery of men.

profession of Christian faith. While none of
our citizens in Turkey have thus far been
. killed or wounded, though often in the midst
of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety In
. the future is by no means assured. Our gov
ernment at home and our minister at Constan
tinople have left nothing undone to protect our
. missionaries in Ottoman territory, who consti
tute nearly all the individuals residing there
who have a right to claim our protection on
. the score of American citizenship
' Several naval vessels are stationed in the Med
iterranean as a measure of caution and to fur
nish all possible relief and refuge in case of
. emergency. We have made claims against the
Turkish government for the pillage and de
struction of missionary property at Harpool
and Marash during uprisings at those places.
The Insurrection in Cuba.
The insurrection in Cuba still continues with
all its perplexities. It is difficult to perceive
that anv progress has thus far been made to
wards the pacification of the island or that the
Situation of affairs as decided in my last an
nual message has in the least improved. If
Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and
all considerable towns, the insurgents still
roam at will over at least two-thirds of the in-
land country. If the determination of Spain
w pui udwh me uisurrcowua seems out xo
strengthen with the lapse of time and is
evidenced by her unhesitating devotion
of largely increased military and naval
' forces to the task, there is much rea
son to believe that the insurgents have gained
in point of numbers, and character, and
resources, and are none the less Inflexible In
their resolve not to succumb, without prncti-
took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-cstab-
llshed her authority, neither have the insur
gents yet made good their title to be regarded
as an independent state. Indeed, as the con-
test has poni on, the pretense that civil gov
ernment exists on the island, except so far as
Spain is able to maintain It. has been practi
cally abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such
u government, more or less Imperfectly, in the
large towns and their immediate suburbs.
But. that exception being made, the entire
country is -either, given over to an
archy or ' is subject to ' the mili
tary occupation of one or the other
party. It is reported, indeed, on re. table au
thority that, at the demand of the commander-in-chief
of the Insurgent army, the putative
Cuban government has now given up nil at
tempt tn exercise its functions, leaving that
government confessedly (what there is the
best reason for supposing it always to have
been In fact) a government merely on paper.
Were' the Spanish armies able to meet their
. prompt and decisive results might be
. looked tor and the immense superiority
of the ' Spanish forces in numbers,
discipline and . equipment, could hardly
fall to tell greatly to their udvantage.
But they are called upon to face a foe that
shuns general engagements, that can choose
nd does choose Its own ground, that from the
nature of the country is visible or Invisible at
. pleasure and that fights only from ambuscade
and when all the advantages of position and"
numbers are oa Its side. In a country where
all that is indispensable to life in the way of
food, clothing and shelter is so easily obtaln-
aoie especially oy lao&n oorn ana area on tne
oil it Is obvious that there is hardly a limit to
the time during which hostilities of this sort
may be prolonged. Meanwhile, as in all
eases of protracted civil strife, the pas
sions of the combatants grow more and
more Inflamed and excesses on both sides
become more frequent and more deplorable.
They also are participated in by. bands of
marauders, who now in the name of one party
and now in the name of the other as may best
suit the occasion, harry the country at will
sad plunder its wretched inhabitants for their
own advantage. Such a condition of things
would Inevitably entail immense destruction
of property even if it were the policy of both
parties to prevent It as far as practicable. But
while such seemed to be the original policy of
the Spanish g.-vernment, it has now apparent
ly abandoned it. and is acting upon the same
theory as the lasurgents. namely, that the ex
igencies 01 tne contest require tne wholesale
annihilation of property. - that it may not
prove of use and advantage to", the -enemy.
.It Is to the sa:ne end that in pursuance of gen
eral orders. Spanish garrisons are now being
' withdrawn from plantations and the rural pop
ulation required to concentrate itself in the
towns. The, sure result would seem to be that
the industrial value of the island IS fast di
minishing .and unless there is m speedy and
radical change in existing conditions, it will
soon disappear altogether'.. That value con
sists very largely, of. course, in its capacity to
produce sugars, a capacity already much re
duced by the interruption to tillage, which
have taken place during the last two years. '
" It is reliably asserted that should these In
terruptions continue during the currant year,
and practically extend,' as It" is now threat
ened, to the-entlre sugar producing territory
of the island, so- muck time and so muoh
money wllfbe requlred to restore the land to
its normal productiveness that it is extremly.
doubtful If capltaLcan be induced to even
make the atPBmpt.The spectacle .of . the titter
' ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one of
the most fertile and 'charming 'oa the globe
would engage the serious attention of the gov
ernment and people of the United" States under
any circumstances,. la point of fact, they
have a concern- with It which is by
no means of a wholly sentimental
sv philanthropic character, it lies so near to
us as to be hardly separated from our territory.
Our actual pecuniary Interest ia it is second
only to that of the people and government of
Spain. It is reasonably estimated that at least
from 13(1.000,000 to t 0.0 O.0OJ of American cap
ital are invested in plantations and in railroad,
mining and other business enterprises on the
island. The volume of trade between the
United States and Cuba, which in 1889 amount
ed to about tSI.000.Q0O. rose in 1893 to about
fl03.tr 0.000. and in 1891. the year before the in
surrection broke out. amounted to nearly '93,.
00 i.O 0. Besides this large pecuniary stake in
the fortunes of Cuba, the United States ends
itself inextricably Involved in the present con
test in other wars, both vexatious and costly.
Many Cubans reside In this country and directly
promote the Insurrection through the press by
public meetings, by the purchase and shipment
of arms, by the raising of funds and by other
means which the spirit of our institutions and
the tenor of our laws do not permit to be made
the subject of criminal prosecution. Some of
them, though Cubans at heart and in all their
feelings in Interests, have taken ont papers as
naturalized citizens of the United States, a
proceeding resorted to with a view to possible
protection bv this government and not unnatu
rally regarded with much indignation by the
country of their origin.
These inevitable entanglements of the
United States with the rebellion in Cuba, the
large American property interests affiled
and considerations of philanthropy ana hu
manity in general have led to a vehement de
mand in various quarters for some sort of pos
itive Intervention on the part of the United
Slates. It was at first proposed that belliger
ent rights should be accorded to the insur
gentsa proposition no longer urged because
untimely and in practical operation clearly
perilous and lnjurlons to our own
interests. It has since been and
is now sometimes contended that the
independence of the insurgents should be
recognized. But Imperfect and restricted as
the Spanish government of the island may be.
no other exists there, unless the will of the
military officer in temDorary command of a
particular district can be dignified as a
species of government. It is now suggested
that the United States should buy the island, a
MUfgestlon possibly worthy of consideration if
there were any evidence of a desire or
willingness on the part of Spain to en
tertain such a proposal. It is urged, finally,
that all other methods falling, the existing In
ternecine strife in Cuba should be terminated
by our intervention, even at the cost of war
between the United States and Spain, a war
which its advocates confidently prophecy could
be neither large in its proportions nor doubtful
In its issue. The correctness of this forecast
need be either affirmed nor denied. The United
States has nevertheless the character to main
tain as a nation, which plainly dictates that
right and might should be the rule of its con
duct. It would seem that if Spain should offer to
Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home
rule which. while preserving the sovereignty or
Spain would satisfy all rational requirements
of her Spanish subjects, there should be no
just reason why the pacification of the island
might not be effected on that basis. It was in
timated by this government to the government
of Spain some months ago tb.it if a satisfac
tory measure of home rule were tendered
the Cuban insurgents and would be ac
cepted by them upon a guaranty of its
execution the United States would en
deavor to find a way not objection
able to Spain of furnishing such guaranty.
It should be added that it cannot be reasonably
assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude
of the United States will be indefinitely main
tained. While we are anxious to accord all
due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we
cannot view the pending conflict in all its
features, and properly apprehend our inevitn
ble relations to it and its possible results with
out considering that by the course of events
we may be drawn into such an unusual and
unprecedented condition as will fix a limit to
our patient waiting for Spain to end
the contest. either alone and in
her own way. or with our friendly co-operation
When the Inability of Spain to deal success
fully with the insurrection has become mani
fest, and it is demonstrated that her sover
eignty is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of Its
rightful existence, and when a hopeless strug
gle for Its re-establishment has degenerated
into a strife which means nothing more than
the useless sacrifice of human life and then
utter destruction of the very subject matter of
the conflict, a situation will be presented in
which our obligations to the sovereignty of
Spain will be superseded by higher obligations
which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and
discharge.
The Venezuelan Boundary Question.
The Venezuelan boundary question has
ceased to be a matter of difference between
Great Britain and the United States, their re
spective governments having agreed upon the
substantial provisions of a treaty between
Great Britain and Venezuela submitting the
whole controversy to arbitration. The provi
slons of the treaty are so eminently just and
fair that the assent of Venezuela thereto may
confidently be anticipated.
Government Revenues and Expenses.
The secretary of the treasury reports that
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, the
receipts or the government from all sources
amounte 1 to 9,I7.4 87a During the same
period its expenditures were $43). 687.6 4. 48
The excess of expenditures over receipts thus
amounted to 8 S-.2U-I.S3 .70. The ordinary ex
penditures during the year were t4.01.853.2l

the receiDts mentioned there were derived
from customs the sum of $160,021,751.67. and
from internal revenue, 145 830,615.66. The re
ceipts from customs show an increase of 17.

of dutiable goods and :9l,231.0:i4 in the value of
free goods over the preceding year. Our ex

The average ad valorem duty paid on dutiable
goods Imported during the year was 39.94 per

The-War Department.
The report of the secretary of war exhibits
satisfactory conditions in the several branches
of the publio service intrusted- to his charge.
The limit of our artillery force as fixed by law
is constantly and readily maintained. The
present discipline and morals tf the army are
excellent and marked progress and efficiency
are apparent throughout its entire organiza
tion. . with the exception of delicate duties in
the suppression of slight Indian disturbances
along our southwestern boundary in which the
Mexican troops co-operated and the eomnul-
sory, but peaceful return with the consent of
Great Britain of a band of Cree Indians from
Montana to the British possessions,' no active
operation have been required of the army dur
ing the past year.
The organized militia numbers 112,879 men. '
The appropriations for Its support by the sev
eral states approximate S2.80u.oj0 annually and
$400,000 is contributed by the general govern
ment. Investigation shows these troops to bt
unusually well drilled and inspired with muc) j
military Interest, and in many instances the)
are so deficient In proper arms and equipment
that a sudlencallto active duty woull fini
them inadequately prepared for field service
I therefore recommend thit prompt measures
be taken to remedy this condition and that
every encouragement be given to this deserv
ing body of unpaid and voluntary citizen sol
diers upon whose assistance we must largely
relv In time of trouble
During the past year rapid progre-a has been
made toward the completion of the scheme
adopted for the erection and armament of for
tifications along our set coast, while equal
progress has been made in providing the mate
rial for submarine defense In connection with
these works. This improved situation is largely
due to the recent generous response of congress
to the recommendations of the war department.
The Attorney-i. enerr Department.
The attorney-general presents a detailed and
interesting statement of the important work
done under his supervision during the last
fiscal year. The ownership and management
by the government of penitentiaries for the
confinement of the convicted in the United
Slates courts of violations of federal laws,
which for many years has been a subject of
executive recommendation, has at last to
a slight extent been realized by the utiliza
tion of the abandoned military prison at Fort
Leavenworth as a united States penitentiary.
This is certainly a movement in the right di
rection: but it ought to be at once supple
mented by the rebuilding or extensive enlarge
ment of this improvised prison and the con
struction of at least one more, to be located In
the southern states. The capacity of the
Leavenworth penitentiary is so limited that
the expense of Its maintenance, calculated at
a per capita rate upon the number of prisoners
it can accommodate does not make as econom
ical an exhibit as It would if it were
larger and better adapted to prison
purposes: but I am thoroughly con
vinced that economy, humanity and a proper
sense of responsibility and duty toward those
whom we punish for violation of federal law
dictate that the federal government have the
entire control and management of the peniten
tiaries where convicted violators are confined.
It appears that since the transfer of the Fort
Leavenworth military prison to its new uses
the work previously done by the prisoners con
fined there, and for which expensive machin
ery has been provided, has been discontinued.
This work consisted of the manufacture of
articles for army use, now done elsewhere On
all grounds it Is exceedingly desirable that the
convicts confined in this penitentiary be al
lowed to resume work of this description.
The Post Office Department.
Our post office department is in good condi
tion and the exhibit made of its operations
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896. if
allowance is made for imperfections in the
laws applicable to It, is very satisfactory. The
total rece i pts durlngtheyearwere 88 2.499.808. 40.
The total expenditures were 190.6:6.29684, ex
clusive of tl,r59.89S. 27, which was-earned by the
Pacific railroad for transportation and credit
on their debt to the government. There was
an increase of receipts over the previous year
of $5,fl6,8.21, or 7.1 per cent, and an increase
of expenditures of $1,836,124.0:, or 4.43 per cent
The deficit was fl.e73.9i6. 19 less than that of
the preceding year. The chief expenditures
of the postal service are regulated by law and
are not In control of the postmaster-general.
All that be can accomplish by the most watch
ful administration and economy is to enforce
prompt and thorough collection and account
ing for publio moneys and such minor savings
in small expenditures ani in letting those con
tracts for post office supplies and star service
which are not regulated by statute
The average revenue from each pound ot
first-class matter was 93 cents. From each
pound of second-class. 8 mills (of the second
class 52,348, .97 was county free matter). From
each pound of third-class, 13.1 cents. From
each pound of fourth-class. Ii.6 cents. The
growth in weight of second-class matter has
been from 299,0 JO.O.W pounds in 1894 to 312,000,
000 in 1895. and to almost 349,000,00 in
1896, and it Is quite evident this in
creasing drawback is far outstripping
any possible growth of postal revenues
Our mail service should, of course, be such
as to meet the wants and even the conven
iences of the people, at a direct charge upon
them so light as perhaps to exclude the Idea ot
our post office department being a money
making concern, but In the face of constantly
recurring deficiencies in Its revenue, and In view
of the fact that we supply the best mail serv
ice in the world, it seems to me it is quite
time to correct the abuses that swell enor
mously our annual deficit If we concede the
public policy of carrying weekly newspapers
free in the county of publication and
even the policy of carrying at
less than one-tetnh of their cost
other bona fide newspapers and periodicals,
there can be no excuse for subjecting the serv
ice to the further immense and increasing loss
involved in carrying at the nominal rat of one
cent a pound the serial libraries, sometimes
including trashy and even harmful literature
and other matter, which under the loose inter
pretation of a loose statute has been gradually
given second-class rates, thus absorbing all
profitable returns derived from first-class
matter, which pays three or four times more
than its cost, and producing a large annual
loss to be paid by general taxation.
Experience and observation have demon
strated that certain Improvements in the or-
I be served before we can gain the full benefit ol
tion. This involves the following reforms,
which I earnestly recommend: There s-hould
be a small addition to the existing inspector
service, to be employed in the supervision ol
the carrier force which now numbers 13.006
men and performs Its service practically
without the surveillance exercised over all
other branches of the postal or public service.
There should also be appointed a few inspect
ors who would assist the central office in nec
essary investigation concerning matters ot
post office leases, post office sites, allowance
tor rent, fuel and lights, and in organizing and
securing the best results from the work of the
14, 00 clerks now employed in first and second
class offices. . 0
The Navy Department.
The work of the navy department and Its
present conditions are fully exhibited in the
report of the secretary. The construction ot
vessels for our navy has been energetically
prosecuted by the present administration upon
the general lines previously adopted, the de
partment having seen no necessity for radical
changes In prior methods under which the
work was found to be progressing In a manner
highly satisfactory. It has been decided,
however, to provide In every shipbuilding con
tract that the builder should pay all trial ex
penses, and it has also been determined tc
pay no speed premiums in future contracts.
On March 4. 1893. there were in commission but
two armored vessels, the double-turreted
monitors Miantonomoh and Monterey. Since
that date of vessels theretofore authorized,
there have been placed in their first commis
sion three first-class snd two second-class bat
tleships, two armored cruisers, one harbor de
fense ram and five double-turreted monitors,
including Maine and Puritan, just completed.
Eight new unarmored cruisers and two new
gunboats have also been commissioned The
Iowa, another battleship, will be completed
about March I. and at least four more gunboats
will be ready for sea in the early spring.
The war college has developed into an insti
tution which it is believed will be of great
value to the navy in teaching the science ol
war, ss well as in stimulating professional
zeal in the navy, and it will be especially use
ful in the devising ot plans for the utilisation
in case of necessity, ot all the naval resources
of the United States.
The naval militia, which was authorized a
few years ago, as an experiment, has now de
veloped into a body of enterprising young men
active and energetic in the discharge ol
their duties and promising great usefulness
This establishment has nearly the same relat lot
to our navy as the national guard in th differ
ent states bears to our army, and constitutes a
source of supply to our naval forces, the im
portance ot which is immediately apparent
The Interior Department
The report of the secretary ot the intex ot
presents a comprehensive and interesting ex
hibit of the numerous and important affairs
committed to his supervision It is impossible
in this communication to do more than briefly
refer to a tew of the subjects concerning which
the secretary gives full and instructive infor
mation. Our public lands, originally amount
ing to U40,930,OJO acres have been so reduced
that only about flOO.ooo.OOJ acres still remain In
government control, excluding Alaska The
balance, being by far the most valuable por
tion, has been given awsy to suttlers. to new
states and to railroads, or sold at a compara
tively nominal sum. -
- The total Indian population ot the United
States is 177.233. according to a census made in
1895. exclusive of those within the state of New
York and those comprising the five civilized
tribes. Of this number there are approxi- J
mately 38,000 children of school age During
the year 23,398 of these were enrolled in I
schools. The progress which has attended re-1
cent efforts to extend Indian school facilities
and the anticipatian of continued liberal ap-1
p ropriatlons to that end. cannot fall to afford
the utmost satisfa.tion to those who
believe that the education of In
dian children Is a prime factor in the
a-complishment ' of Indian civilization.
The condition ot affairs among the five civilized
tribes, who occupy large tracts of land in the
Indian territory and who have governments ot
their own, has assumed sm h an aspect as tt
render it almost indispensable that there
should be an entire change ia the relations of
these Indian to the general government This
seems to be necessary in furtherance of their
own interests as well as for the protection ot
non-Indian residents in their territory. A
commission organized and empowered under
several recent laws is now negotiating with
these Indians for the relinquishment of their
courts aad the division of their common lands
In severalty.
Tho Pension Roll.
The diminution of our enormous rension
roll and the decrease of pension expenditures
which have been so often foretold still fail in
material realization. The number of pension
ers on the rolls at the close of the fiscal year
ended June 3). Ir91. was 97.1.678. This is the
largest number ever reported. The amonnt
paid exclusively for pensions during the year
was $138,214,761.91. a slight decrease from that
of the preceding year, while the total expend
itures on account ot pensions, including the
cost ot malntainence of the department
and expenses attending pension distribution
amounted tci $142,206. -50 59. or within a very
small fraction of one-third of the entire ex

with the amount already matured, more than

bond issued by the United States in aid of the
construction of the Union Pacific railway, in
cluding its Kansas line, and more than (6,000,
WJU of like bonds, issued in aid of the Central
Pacific railroad. Including those issued to the
Western Pacific Roilwoy Co., will hove fallen
due and been paid or must on that
day be paid by the government With
out any reference to the application of
the sinking funds now in the treasury
this will create such a default on the part of
the companies to the government as will give
It the right to at once institute proceedings to
foreclose its mortgage lien. In addition td
this indebtedness which will be due January
1, 1897. there will mature between that date
and January 1. 1899, the remaining principal ot
such subsidy bonds which must also be met by
the government. Theso amount to more than
I! ',000.00 J on account of the Union Pacific
lines and exceeds J21. 0X1,003 on account of the
Central Pacific lines.
The Agricultural Department.
The department of agriculture Is so inti
mately related to the welfare of onr people and
the prosperity of our nation that it should con
stantly receive the care and encouragement of
the government The secretary reports that
the value of our exports of farm products dur
ing the last fiscal . year amounted to
$ 70.0i)0.000, an increase of fl7,000.000 over
those ot the year immediately preceding
This statement Is not the less welcome be
cause of the fact that notwithstanding such in
crease, the proportion of exported agricultural
products to our total exports of all description
fell off during the year. The benefits of an in
crease lu agricultural products being assured,
the decrease In its proportion to our total ex
ports is more gratifying when we consider that
it is coming to the fact that such total exports
for the year increased more than i7.i,ooO.LOO.
The large and increasing exportation of our
agricultural products suggests the great use
fulness ot the organization lately established
in the department for the purpose of getting
to those engaged In the farming pursuits re
liable information concerning the condition,
needs and advantages of different foreign
markets. Inasmuch as the success of the
farmer depends upon the advantageous sale
of bis products, and inasmuch ss foreign mar
kets must largely be the destination of such
products, it is quite apparent that a knowledce
of the conditions a-d wants that affect
these markets ought to result . in
sowing more intelligently and rean-
lng with a better promise of profit.
Such information points out the way to a pru
dent foresight In the selection and cultiva
tion of crops and to a release from the bond
age ot unreasoning monotomy of protection, a
glutted and depressed market and constantly
recurring unprofitable toil. In mv opinion the
gratuitous distribution ot seeds by the depart
ment as at present conducted ought to be
discontinued.
Civil Service Reform.
The progress made in civil service reform
furnishes a cause for the utmost congratula
tion. It has survived the doubts of its friends
as well as the rancor ot its enemies, and has
gained a permanent place among the agencies
destined to cleanse our politics and improve,
economize and elevate the public service
There are now in the competitive classified
service upwards of Si.COi places. More than
half of these have been Included from time to
time since March 4, 1893. A most radical and
sweeping extension was made by executive
order dated the 6th day of May. 19J.
and if fourth-class postm.isterships are not In
cluded in the statement it may be said that
practically all positions contemplated by the
civil service law are now classified Abundant
reasons exist for including these postmaster-
ships, based upon economy, improved service
and the peace snd quiet of neighborhoods. If.
however, obstacles prevent uch action at
present, I earnestly hope that congress will,
without increasing post office appropriations,
so adjust them as to permit In proper rases of
a consolidation of these post ofi'.ces to the end
that through this process the result desired
may to a limited extent be accomplished. '
The Tariff.
I desire to recur to the statements else
where made concerning the government re
ceipts and expenditures for the purpose of
venturing upon some suggestions touching our
present tariff law and its operations. This
statute took effect on the 8th day of August,
1S9L Whatever may be its shortcomings as a
comptete measure of tariff reform, it must be
conceded that it has opened up the
way to a freer and greater ex
change of commodities between us and other
couctries and thus furnished a wider market
for our products and manufactures. The
only entire fiscal year during which this law
has been in force ended on the 30th day of
June, 1896. Ia that year our imports Increased
over those of the previous year more than
$1,500,0 JO while the value ot tho domestic prod
ucts exported and which found mar
kets abroad was nearly ..70,0 O.ioj
more than during the preceding year.
Those who insist that the cose to our people
of articles coming to them from abroad for
their needful use should only be increased
through tariff changes to an extent necessary
to meet the expenses of the government, as
well as those who claim that tariff changes
may be laid upon such articles beyond the
necessities of government revenue, and wita
the additional purpose ot so increasing lb ca
price in our markets as to give American
manufacturers aad producers better
and more profitable opportunities
must agree that our tariff laws
are only primarily justified as sources of
revenue to enable the government to meat the
necessary exp- ne of its maintenance Con
sidered as to Its sufficiency in this aspect the
present law can by no means fall under just
condemnation During the only comolete fis
cal year of its operation it has yielded nearly
$8,000,000 more revenue than was received from
tariff duties in ths preceding year. Th ere was
nevertheless a deficit between onr receipts and
expenditures of a little more than tr.uoo,-"0-
This, however, was not unexpected.
The situation was such in December last,
seven months before the close or the fiscal
year, that the secretary of the treasury fore
told a deficiency of fl7.ooo.ooa The great and
increasing apprehension and timidity in busi
ness circles snd the depression in all activities
intervening since that time, resulting from
causes perfectly well understood and entirely
disconnected with our tariff law or operation,
seriously checked the imports we would have
otherwise received and readily account for the
difference between this estimate of the secre
tary and the actual deficiency as well as for a
continued deficit.
I believe our present tariff law, if allowed a
fair opportunity, will in the near future yield
a revenue which, with reasonably economical
expenditures, will overcome all difficulties.
In the meantime no defirit that has occurred
or may oc?ur need excite or disturb us.
To meet such deficit we have in the treasury,
in addition to a gold reserve ot $:00.00-000, a
surplus of more than $128,000,OJO applicable to
payment of expenses ot the government, and
which must, unless expended for that purpose
remain a useless hoard, or. if not extravagant!'
was ted, must in any event be perverted from the
purpose of its exaction from our people, the
payment therefore, of sny deficiency in the
revenue from this fund is nothing more than
its proper and legitimate use It is Immeasur- ,
ably better to appropriate our surplus to the
payment of justifiable expenses than to allow
lt to become an invitation to reckless appro- ;
priations and extravagant expenditures. I
I suppose it will not be denied that under the
present law our people obtain the necessaries I
ota comfortable existence at a cheaper rate
than formerly. This is a matter ot supreme i
importtnee since it is the palpable duty of
every just government to make the burdens of
taxation as light as possible The people
should not be required to relinquish this
privilege of cheaper living except under the J
stress of their government's necessity made
plainly manifest.
Oar Financial Methods.
This reference to the condition and pros
pects of our revenues naturally suggests an
allusion to the weakness and vices of our finan
cial methods. They have been frequently
pressed upon the attention of congress in pre
vious executive communications and the in
ev. table danger of their continued toleration
pointed out. Without now repeating these de
tails I cannot refrain from again earnestly
presenting the necessity of the prompt reform
of a system opposed to every rule of sound
finance and shown by experience to be fraught
with the gravest peril and perplexity. The
terrible civil war which shook the foundations
ot our government more than 3) years ago
brought In its trala the destruction of property,
the wasting of country's substances, and the
estrangement cf brethern. Ttese are now , Yomo Medical Student (to charity pa

keeps alive a tender regard for those who
nobly died, and yet there remains with us to
day, in full strength and activity as an inci
dent of that tremendous struggle, a feature of
its financial necessity not only unsuited to our
present circumstances, but manifestly a dis
turbing menace to business security and an
ever present agent ot monetary distress.
Because we may be enjoying a temporary re
lief from its depressing influence this should
not lull us Into a false security nor lead us to
forget the suddenness of past visitation. I am
more convinced than ever that we cannot have
assured financial peace and safety until
the government obligations upon which gold
may be demanded from the treasury are with
drawn from circulation and collected. This
might be done, as has been heretofore recom
mended, by their exchange for long term bonds
bearing a low rate of interest, or by their re
demption with the proceeds of such bonds.
Even if only the United States notes known as
greenbacks were thus retired, it is probable
thitthe treasury notes Issued in payment of
silver purchases under the act ot July 14, 1890,
now paid in gold waen demanded, would not
create much disturbance, as they might from
time to time, when received in the troa sury by
redemption in gold or otherwise be gradually
and prudently replaced by silver coin.
This plan of issuing bonds for the purpose of
redemption certainly apsears to be the most
effective and direct path to the needed reform.
In default ot this, however, it would be a step
in tho right dliec.ion if currency obligations
are redeemab.e in gold whenever so redeemed
should be cancelled instead of being reissued.
This operation would be a slow remedy, but it
Wuuld improve present conditions.
National banks should redeem their own
notes. They should be allowed to issue circu
lation to the par value of bonds deposited as
security for its redemption and the tax on
their circulation should be reduced to one-,
fourth of one per cent
In considering projects for the retirement of
Unite 1 States notes and treasury notes issued
under the new law of 1890 I am of the opinion
we have placed too much stress upon the dan
ger of contracting the currency and have cal
culated too little upon the gold that would be
added to our circulation if invited to us by bet
ter and safer financial methods. It Is not so
much contraction of our currency that should
be avoided as its unequal distribution. This
might be obviated and fear of harmful con
traction at the same time removed by allowing
the organization of small banks and in less
populous communities than are now permitted
and authorizing existing banks to establish
branches in small communities under proper
restrictions.
The entire case may be presented by the
statement that the day of sensible and sound
financial metbohs will not dawn upon us until
our government abandons the banking busi
ness ana the accumulation of funds, and con
fines its monetary operations to the receipts
of money contributed by the people for its
support, and to the expenditure of such money
fur the people's benefit. Our business Inter
ests and all good citizens long for rest from
feverish agitation and the inauguration by tho
government of a reformed financial policy
whicn will encourage-enterprise and make
certain the rewards of labor and industry.
TrnstH and Monopolies.
Another topic in which oar people rightfully
take a deep interest may be here briefly con
sidered. I refer to the expense of trusts and
other huge aggregations of capital, the object
ot which is to secure the monopoly of some
particular branch of trade, industry, or com
merce and to stifle wholesome competition.
When these are defended It is usually oi the
ground that though they increase profits they
also reduce prices und thus may beacllt the
public. It must be remembered, however, that
a reduction of price to t he people is not one of
the real objects of these organizations, nor is
their tendency necessarily la that direction.
If it occurs in a particular case it
is only because it accords with the purposes
or interests of those managing them.
Such occasional results fall short of compen
sating the palpcb e evils charged to the ac
count ot trusts and monopolies ' Their ten
dency is to crush out individual Independence
and to hln ler and to prevent the free use of
human faculties and the full development of
human character. T.irough them the farmer,
theartism andthi small trader is in danger
of dUlodgement from tho proud position of be
in his own m-tr, watchful of all that
touches his country's prosperity, in which he
has an individual interest in all that affects the
advantage of business of which he is a factor,
to be relegated to the level of a mere appurte
nance to a great machine, with little free will,
with no duty but that of passive obedience and
with little hope or opportunity of rising In the
scale of responsible and helpful citizenship
To the instinctive bjlief that such is the inevi
table trend or trusts and monopolies is due the
wide-spread and deep-seated popular aversion
in which they are held and the not unreasona
ble Insistance that whatever may be their in
cidental economic advantages, their general
effect upon personal character, prospects and
usefulness can not bs otherwise than Injurious.
Though congress has attempted lo deal with
this matter by legislation, the laws nassed for
that purpose thus far have proved ineffective, '
not because of any lack of disposition or it- !
tempt to euforce them but simply because the
laws themselves as interpreted by the courts
do not reach the difficulty. If toe insufficien
cies of existing laws can be remedied by
further legislation it should be done The
fact must be recognized, however, that all
federal leg'slation on this subject may fall
shrt of its purpose because ot inher
ent obstacles, and also because of th? complex
character of our governmental system, which,
while making tbe federal authority supreme
within its sphere, has carefully limited that
sphere by metes and bounds which cannot be
transgressed. Tho decision of our highest court
on this precise question renders It quite doubt
ful whether the evils of trusts and monopolies
can be adequately treated tbrou-h federal ac
tion unless they seek directly ani purposely to
Include in their objects transportation or In
tercourse between states or between the
United States and foreign countries.
It ocs not follow, however, that this is the
limit of the remedy that may be applied.
Even though it may be found that federal au
thority is not bread enough to fully reach the
case, there can be no doubt ot the power of the
several states to act effectively in the prem
ises, and there should be no reason to doubt
their willingness to judiciously exercise such
power.
In concluling this communication its last
wards shall be an appeal to the congress for
the most rigid economy in the expenditure ot
the money it holds in trust for the people
The way to perplexing extravagance IS easy,
but a return to frugality is difficult
When, however, it is considered that those
who bear the burdens of taxation have no
guaranty of honest care, save in the fidelity oi
their public servants, the duty of all possible
retrenchment is plainly manifest When our
differences are forgotten and our con
tests of political opinion are no longer re
membered nothing in the retrospect of our
public service will be as fortunate and com
forting as the recollection of official duty well
performed snd the memory of a constant de
votion to the interests or our confiding fellow
countrymen. Gbotbb Clbvblasd.
