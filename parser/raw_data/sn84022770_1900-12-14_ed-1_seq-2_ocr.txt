The Capitol Contention Begui3.
With-< ii-nt. mil headline-tin To
• ••mi V announ" - the fact that
l'«-nton 11. Gnu, of that <ity, has
Lr.eight action against his aecidency,
15. Rogers, Rolit. llridges, as Land
Commissioner, Frank J. Browne, State
-uperintendent. W. D. Jenkins, Secre
tin and Neal Cheetiiam, Auditor,
tin- latter officer L ing an <•,
member of the l'mrd of Capitol Cotu
nii--ioner-.
Mr. Gnss, who in 1 was awarded
a i ontraet for building the capitol, ap
plies in tin- action for a writ of
mandate to compel those officers
to fill the Hoard of Capitol Com
missioners, to cause warrants to be
issued and sold for cash, and that the
land-grant be offered for sale and sold
if a sufficient sum offered aggregating
♦lO per ucre, can be obtained for it,
and that whenever a sufficient sum
has been received to equal tbe uncx
jicutlod balance of the appropriation,
that they be required to complete the
contract with the plaintiff, and enable
him to jiroceeil with the work of con
struction of the capitol.
The Ncus gives a brief history of
the way in which this important
matter has been side-tracked by inter
ested parties and states that Mr. Goss
feels that he has been damaged to the
extent of $200,000 by the failure of
the State to fill its part of the con
tract with him.
F. S. Carroll and A. B. Titlow are
counsel for Goss, and the matter is set
for hearing before Judge Linn in this
city on the 4th day of next month.
It is not thought that the plaintiff
has any hope of compelling the execu
tive to proceed with a work he has
deliberately ignored, despite the re
quirements of law, but it is regarded
simply as a device to give Goss the
necessary foothold to ask for an
award of damages bj* the incoming
Legislature. It is to establish judi
cially the legality of award of con
tract and to show that Goss had made
an attempt to discharge in good faith
the duties involved, as well as having
made recourse to the courts to protect
his rights. It looks as if he would
he well fortified to press his demand
from every point of justice and fair
dealing, and that one of the first du
ties of our law-givers will be to patch
up the execrable work of an auto
cratic, law defying executive.
A Sensible Oirl.
We should not forget to eypress a few
words of praise for Miss Alt a Rocke
fslle, who has a dowry of $50,000,000 and
is to become the wife of a respectable
and respected Chicago attorney with a
j jfprtjufie .of only SIO,OOO. Miss Rocke
feller has the reputation of being a sens
ible, well-bred and attractive American
girl, and her wedding announcement
confirms the impression. She will not
marry a title, but she will retain the re
spect and receive the good wishes of
American manhood and womanhood.—
Ex.
Yes, indeed, Alta is to he com
mended by everybody with an ounce
of patriotic blood in his, or lier, veins.
A sensible girl with a dot of fifty
millions, if inclined to take her pick
of American manhood, can Rock-a
fellcr to utter oblivion of any scruples
of any sort. The actions of the Gould
dude aud the Zimmerman jack should
convince any girl of sense that old
world heredity rests upon a very in
secure foundation, and that the life of
a wife of the effete nobility may be a
realization of those " hot times " so
vividly pictured by Dante as the ulti
mate and final reward for worldly
pride.
IT IS claimed that three of the
newly electee! city and county officials
are, in reason if not law, disqualified
for holding their respective positions
owning no property in their respective
districts subject to taxation. One of
those has been elected to a salaried
office in our city government, another
will fill the place of Councilman, and
the other one of the most important and
lucrative positions in the county ser
vice. There are very few who will
dispute the position that all officers of
profit and trust should go to men who
possess a thorough interest in public
nffairs and ability to acquire enough
of earthly possessions to pay some
thing, though it lie but a tithe, toward
the support of the rules adopted for
safety of property and preservation of
life.
ANY Democrat who can cast back
his political memories for a few years,
must laugh to recall the fulrainations
of the Republicans of that time against
any seeking to enter the foreign mar
kets and their declaration that the
home markets were good enough for
them. Now that things have changed,
they contend, of course, that they
were in favor of developing our foreign
trade all the time instead of being bit*
terly hostile to it—as they were.
CONGRESS is well under way and the
Republican measures arc booming all
along the line. Some of them may be
prevented from passing at this session,
but, if so, they will get through next
time and therefore the chances are
that the Democrats will content them
selves with going on record in opposi
tion and then letting the g. o. p. do
its worst.
BY the way, some one may pick up
a few small sums by wagering that
McKinley has not yet been re-elected.
The electoral college has not met yet,
you know, and there is nothing in the
laws to prevent its choosing somebody
else when it does.
PRESIDENT McKinlcy's message is
only remarkable in its length. It is
turgid in expression; about as dull as
a market report and possesses the
scectillating brilliancy of a "blue
book."
Ghosts and "Gobblings."
' asionallj* a >ar- .i-tie mood ani
ni:tt> - our good neighbor, the Tacoma
.V- *, and when it doc.-, the caustic
tiling l - that ale -aid by him run like
| molten lava from t'licle Sam's lately
at quired Manna
In a late i--ue the degree of cordial
ity which cxi-t- between the " City of
Destiny" ami the "Chiton City" is ad
mirably depicted, in which the capital
is made the striking-ball for exercise
of muscle, in suggestion if not antici
pation, of a lively scrap when the Leg
islature convenes.
The presumption is that lving
county wants to sink a few millions of
dollars in Lake Washington bad
enough to unite with its enemy in a
deliberate trade in setting the capitol
■ afloat for the object of landing it
I where the Andalena is so " permanent
! ly located" as to know no hope of res
urrection' In fact the intimation is
■ that King has already made the prop
osition, which surely finds some plaus
ibility in the fact that she lately
turned down her own nominee for
• Governor to reinstate a man whose
vision extends no further than Com
; inducement Raj - , in any matter of
; public importance. If Seattle can
swallow such an unsavory morsal
without retelling, it inaj' be that she
can keep down a still more nauseous
dose in advancing the visionary ob
jects of licr relentless foe.
Anyway, it is well for the News to
appear cheerful, and reach out for the
Supreme Court and State Library, as
a pastime, while " jollying" the cat
as to the advisability of attempting
the "chestnut" game.
Here is what the News says is the
" Song of the Seattle Siren":
Disturbed by the rumbling of the ap
proach of the Ides of Legislature, the
Capital Ghost, whose mournful obse
quies have been performed with barba
rous regularity once within the period of
each recent session of the State Assem
bly, threatens to arise, lay aside its
worn-out burial clothes, anil walk.
The ceremony of the perambulation of
the Ghost may as well be accepted now
by the people as one of the few certain
ties of the near future. There be men
who, though they be Senators, make
true talk. It is by mouth of these there
comes forwarning of this sad, sepulchral
resurrection joke. With furtive brows
and guarded lips they tell that ere a sea
son's rains have ceased to fall, while
winter storms yet brew above Olympic
peaks and all the western Stale is
wrapped in inist, this ghostly ghoul shall
walk ; while scheming Senators and be
ings of less degree shall chant Olympia's
dirge—solemnly shall intone a turgid
Tlianatopsis to "the glory that was
Greece and the grandeur that was
Koine." Then shall Olympia, fair god
mother to the cocktail, have fallen from
her high estate, while tired Taeoma,
dreaming on her thirty-seven hills,
shall rise, and on the ruins of her brick
hotel shall rear the haughty capitol of
State! Ye Gods!
Seattle the avaricious, it is further
said, has a hand to bear in this resur
rection joke. Seattle long has burned
for a canal of commerce that shall con
nect the waters of Lake Washington
with Puget Sound. This burning can
be soothed away by the expenditure of
a paltry few miilions of public money —
merely nothing, as it were; a bagatelle.
List, then, to the siren's scaly song. In
choicer words, get next:
WE need your help, fair County Pierce,
To Meal ux a canal;
YOC yearn with fervor firm ami fierce
To own the capi-tal.
The People's mfliioiiH we woold lhcit,
A harbor Krnnit to aaln ;
Come! help the treasury to milch!
"l'ls nehthliot'e duty, plain.

And In return we'll make Home tune
About that cap-l-tal.
ONE of the worst bills of its kind
ever proposed is now pending in Con
gress. By its provisians, all veterans,
whether disabled or not, are to have
preference for appointment or promo

the bill passes, it will mean that the
entire government service will be put
into the hands of the veterans to the
exclusion of all civilians.
GARFIELD is a model Prohibition
town. The Mayor-elect, F. L. Gwinn,
was one of the Prohibition candidates
for elector in November. No City At
torney was elected as none was need
ed, and there is not a lawyer in the
place. There is not a card-room or
cigar stand in the little city, and the
people all go to bed at sundown and
get up with the dawn.
THE Sultan is to pay up through
the purchase of a cruiser and the
United States has professed itself satis
fied. It may bo pointed out, by the
way, that payment could have been
had months ago by this means, but
was refused and the very idea of its
acceptance was ridiculed. But that
was before the election.
AFTER all the talk of the decadence
of the merchant mnrine of the United
States, there may be some surprise at
the statement that the United States
stands second among the nations in
the tonnage it has afloat. It is ex
ceeded only by Great Britain, and no
subsidy bill is likely to enable it to
pass that country.
IT is reported that 1,200 bolomen
have surrendered in the Philippines.
If so, so good. But be not hopeful
brethren, that the war is over. There
have been similar surrenders before,
only to have the surrendered go back
to the fighting line after they have
had a few full meals and had seen
their families.
" THE Czar is out of danger," says
a bulletin from Livadia. Not if the

tempora do mutantur.
TEDDY docs not propose to allow
himself to be buried in the Vice Presi

Matrimonial "Cbromos."
A Providence, 15. 1., furniture dealer
lias hit upon splendid plan for obtain
ing considerable gratuitous advertis
ing, and at the same time make it
doubtless a very prfitable means of
gain. Relying upon the human weak
ness for obtaining something for noth
ing, lie advertises that he will hegin
the new year by providing the marri
age feast, pay the ministerial fee and
defray the expenses of a three days'
wedding trip, for all bridal couples
who shall purchase their housekeep
ing outfit of him. The service is
graded, however, in proportion to the
extent of the purchase made. With
seven room purchasings, all the above
go; six rooms, call for feast and the
parson ; live rooms, to the feast only,
and those who cannot afford to furnish
more than four rooms, will get only
the parson. All will, however, receive
a silver mug or a high-chair for every
child born within five years of date of
the marriage. The promotor says
that he will do this "to stimulate
trade, promote human happiness and
benefit the community," but it is evi
dent that the main incentive is itn
braccd in the first clause of the an
nouncement, "to stimulate trade,"'
and it is very probable that matrimo
nial parties united under this unique
method will discover, if their vision is
keen, that all the expenses provided
for by the shrewd dealer in furniture
is included in the bill as graded.
For those couples who are caught
by the ordinary Fair weddings, where
a parlor suit, a cooking range, or
some other serviceable adjunct to
housekeeping, is awarded for the extra
gatc-moncy the event brings, the idea
of "something for nothing," (unless it
be a sacrifico of self-respect) seems to
be realized, but in the proposition of
this Yankee matrimonial promoter it
is ten to one that the newly-married
pay every dollar of the expense in
volved, from license to coverlid
and pillow-sham, disguised under one
form or another.
Demoralization of College Athletics.
Chauucey liathbuu, an Olympia
boy, a student at the State University
and leader of the Rooters' Club, has
got himself into trouble for '• inject
ing" profanity into the college yell
and refusing to remove it. The
young man has been indefinitely sus
pended, which, Prof. Graves declares
to be "a softer term for expulsion."
Rathbun claims that he had the use
of the name of Deity changed to
" Hully Gee," but the club refused to
accept the substitution and continued
to give the yell as originally written.
It was as follows:
" Ilippity Hackle,
Uippity Hackle
God Almighty,
See that tackle!'
It lias long seemed to those outside
of college walls that there was too
much in those institutions of a drift
towards physical development to the
neglectof mental education. Through
boating, baseball and later foot-ball
achievements, the loading cullcgco
seem to have kept quite prominently
in the public eye, while the higher
realms of literary or scientific research
seem to be terra incognita when meas
ured by notablo achievements or use
ful discoveries mads along these path
ways to knowledge. It would be far
better to educate the head instead
of the heels, as now seems to be the
primary object of the higher Univer
sity courses.
Chauncey Rathbun must have
changed very much from his youthful
nature, if he has developed into an
" undesirable student," as is alleged by
Prof. Doubt. How much of it is due
to the college course, is a query that
will obtrude, especially as the young
man earned merited marks of recogni
tion for bravery as a soldier in the
Philippines, and is entitled to some
consideration for patriotism as well as
an exemplary youthful life.

of the Army The Ship Subsidy Bill Samp

Make Him One- More of Willie's Wobbling
Pettigrew Still "Wants to Know."
(From our regular correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7, l'.iOO.
The Republican leaders in Congress
are on their knees to the brewers, beg
ging to be let oil' with a small reduc
tion in the tax on beer, instead of the
entire war tax, as demanded by the
brewers. All this has been brought
about in a week. A wte>. ago the
Republican members of the Ways and
Means committee refused to even con
sider a reduction in the beer tax.
Since then Representative Rabeock,
who was chairman of the Republican
Congressional Committee and knew
all about campaign contributions and
promises, has succeeded Doiliver, of
lowa, who lias gone to the Senate, as
a member of the Ways and Means
committee, and has told the Republi
can members thereof a few things, as
Mr. Hanna has also done. Now it is
no longer a question of whether there
will be a reduction of the beer tax,
but of how small a reduction the
brewers can be cajoled into accepting.
The bill as reported from the Ways
and Means committee, makes a reduc
tion of 40 cents a barrel in the beer
tax, but it is not yet certain that the
brewers will accept that.
While the Democratic caucus on
the Army bill, which was railroaded
through the House this week, did not
agree upon any party policy in oppos
ing the bill, the Democrats who spoke
against the bill in the limited time al
lowed them were practically unani
mous in objecting to the imperial
powers given the President, of increas
ing the regular army from 58,000, the
minimum number provided by the
bill, to 100,000 men whenever so dis
posed and of retaining it at the high
est figures as long as he wanted to.
The Democrats agreed that it was
more power than Congress ever placed
in oue man's hands and more than
should he given to any man. Other
objectionable features were pointed
out by Democrats, but tbat is all that
they could do. Mr. McKinley's orders
had been issued to Speaker Hender
son, and of course tbe bill was passed.
Senator Clay, of Georgia, made a
strong point against the Ship Subsidy
bill, now tbe regular order of business
in tbe Senate, when be compelled
Senator Frye, who is in charge of the
bill, to admit that if it became a law
tbe annual subsidy of a twenty-one
knot ship would lie $304,000. Sena
tor Clay also called attention to tbe
fact that tbe ten and twelve knot
ships which carry tbe agricultural
products of tlie country will not re
ceive more than one-third of the sub
sidy provided for the fast passenger
vessels which carry no agricultural
products. Senator Vest offered an
amendment to the bill repealing all
laws prohibiting the purchase of for
eign built ships for use in the foreign
carrying trade of tbe United States or
imposing taxes or restrictions upon
such, and giving American citizens
the right to purchase vessels anywhere
and for any purpose and to have them
registered as ships of the United
States.
Representative Crumpacker, of In
diana, has introduced an Apportion
ment bill which cuts down the Con
gressional representation of four
Southern States North Carolina,
South Carolina, Louisiana and Missis
sippi—but nobody has any idea that
the bill will ever receive any serious
consideration. Crumpacker himself
says the bill represents only his per
sonal views and was introduced with
out any assurances that it would be
supported.
Senator Tillman got a bill through
the Senate without opposition, appro
priating $75,000 for a government
building at tbe Interstate and West
Indian Exposition, to be held at
Charleston, South Carolina, Dec. 1,
1901 to June 1, 1902, and $250,000 to
aid the furtherance of tbe exposition.
It is understood that the revival of
the grade of Vice Admiral, recom
mended by Secretary Long and pro
vided for in the bill introduced by
Senator Hale, is to make a place to
which Hear Admiral Sampson can be
promoted by Mr. McKinley. Rear
Admiral Schley has many warm
friends in Congress and they may
have a word or two to say about this
scheme before it gets through.
Studeuta of human nature as ex
hibited in the political world are try
ing to reconcile Mr. McKinley's words
with his acts. In the closing para
graph of his message were words
which read like a patriotic warning to
Congress not to be led into making
extravagant appropriations just be
cause there was a lot of money in the
Treasury, and now Mr. McKinley is
using all his power to drive objecting
Republican Senators into the support
of one of the most extravagant appro
priations ever before Congress—that
for ship subsidies, which will put mil
lions into the pockets of the already
rich owners of the fast mail arid pas
senger steamships and next to noth
ing in the pockets of those who own
the slow freighters, which carry our
manufactures and products.
With the taking of the vote in the
House on the Oleomargarine bill one
of the longest and most bitter fights
that ever took place in the House, in
which there was no partisan politics,
was brought to a close, although it
will doubtless be renewed in the Sen
ate.
Senator Pettigrew reminded the ad
ministration that he was still in the
ring, and that he had heard about the
suppressed report of the expert ac
countant on the stealings in Cuba, by
offering a resolution calling for any
additional information that bad been
received by the government about
Cuban finances. The resolution was
sent to the Committee on Relations
with Cuba, to die. DEM.

severing work that the town was
saved. The loss is heavy and no in
surance. The people will rebuild im
mediately. There is no fire protec
tion in the town and the fire was sub
dued by a hastily organized bucket
brigade.
Isaac Lancaster, a trapper, residing
in Selah Valley, lately had a narrow
escape from accidental death by shoot
ing. He was in the woods near the
banks of the Yakima River, setting
beaver traps. The place is known as
a heaver resort and men passing by are
always on the lookout for the animals.
A cattle herder passed the traps as
Lancaster was engaged in placing
them. He saw what he thought was a
beaver and fired a shot from his rifle.
The bullet missed Lancaster only a
few inches. He sprang to his feet
and the excited herder ran away.
Mrs. F. T. Clark, of Machias, was
struck by a locomotive on the Everett
& Monte Cristo railway tracks Mon
day night about 7 o'clock, and in
stantly killed. She was walking on
the track to her home and when
about one mile south of Machias, was
overtaken by the train. She attempt
ed to step to one side, but the engine
struck her, causing her instant death.
The body was taken to Suohomish and
an inquest held, it being- found that
death was purely accidental. De
ceased was 70 years of age and was an
old residdent of Snohomish county.
She leaves a number of children in
that vicinity.
Burglars have a cool way of operat
ing in Seattle. Tuesday morning, at an
early hour, \V. 1). Bangs, who resides
in the suburbs had an exciting time
with a nocturnal prowler, who while
riffling drawers and learning that his
presence was detected, rushed to the
bed in which Bangs was sitting up
right, and pushing him down, drew a
revolver and commanded him to keep
quiet. With a threat to blow liis
head off if further protest was offered,
the burglar calmly resumed his inter
rupted examination of the contents of
the bureau drawers, obtaining $33
from Bangs' room and $5 from an ad
joining apartment occupied by his
daughter.
A diver named Brenderman, said to
be from Seattle, recovered S7OO in
gold from the bottom of Bellingham
Bay, Monday afternoon. The money
was in a small satchel, and was lost
off the Sehome wharf by a Mrs.
Mathews, of Samisli, about two weeks
ago. Mrs. Mathews is an elderly wo
man, and slipped on a wet plank and
fell, dropping the money, which rolled
off the dock into twenty feet of water.
Fruitless efforts were made to recover
the money by dragging, and the diver
was finally employed. He went down
Monday afternoon and found the
money, after five minutes' search,
about 50 feet from the dock. The
diver was paid $125 for liis services.
Tbe mystery surrounding the
strange disappearance of John Harder,
at Seattle, who was last seen on the
night of Nov. 19, was solved Tues
day by tbe finding of the body in
Ihe bay near that place. Every
appearance points to llarder having
been murdered. On bis bead were
several wounds, which were prob
ably made by a blunt instrument from
behind. The trousers pockets were
turned inside out, showing tbat he
bad been robbed. What lends fur
ther color to tho murder theory in the
fact that Harder was seen early in the
morning, after leaving his work, at a
beer ball on Second avenue, in com
pany with a strange man who said he
came from Montana.
Colville is awakening to the fact
that the disease which lias been for a
year past designated by the local
physicians as Manila itch is in fact
smallpox. In the past two months
two deaths have resulted from this
malady, and oue victim has lost his
sight. It is said that the State quar
antine law is inoperative except in sea
board and border towns, where in
fectious diseases from foreign coun
tries is possible. The coming Legis
lature will be asked to enact a law
covering the case and provide severe
penalties for violation. There have
been over 50 cases of smallpox in
Colville within the past six months.
The attacks have been light, but this
is due to the general practice of vac
cination and the warmth of the sea
son. As the ccld weather approaches
the disease becomes more severe.
Dwight Franks, a carpenter, who
refused to give up his money, about
SBOO, to footpads was twice shot at
Spokane, Wednesday evening. His
assailants ran away without the money,
however. Franks was going home
from work about 9 o'clock on that
night, when two men stepped out and
demanded that he throw up his hands,
at the same time shoving pistols un
der Franks' nose. Franks swung at
him with his open umbrella, and an
instant later was shot in the groin by
one ruffian, and in the instep by the
other, both taking to their hods.
Previous to Franks' hold-up, Jimmie
Morrison, a messenger boy, was
stopped by apparently the same men
and his loose change taken from him.
Franks says his assailants were
masked and disguised their voices, but
he believes they are old hands at the
business. He is not dangerously
wounded.
Issdore Schopps, who has been in
the Medical Lake asylum for the past
two years, was Wednesday adjudged
free by Assistant Attorney General
Vance. Schopps murdered a man
named Gustave Hager, in Seattle, Dec.
25,1898, but the jury found him not
guilty by reason of insanity. He has
now regained his reason. The crime
was most brutal and cold-blooded.
Schopps and the man he killed were
roommates together. They had a
drunken quarrel, and the next day
Schopps procured a revolver and blew
the top of his companion's head off.
The Superior Court Judge who com
mitted him ordered him to be kept
pending further orders from the court,
but the opinion of tho Attorney-Gen
eral seems to put this at naught. It is
likely that some appeal against the
decision will be made. This is the
man who Geo. Israel defended in the
now famous trial.
