CUBA.
The Cuban matter Again as
Fiinics l ho appearance of a i eace
Hb'.e eetlleniint, lut negotiations,
h lwever, are still in a di-licute
situation. That is the last at the
time of going to presa.
Matt H. Carpenter.
President 'Grant comes to tlie
rescue of Matt II. Carpenter, and
vouches lbr his being sober at
j-)Dg Drancli, on t!io day the
slanderous report ai raided a-
bout him. All that ia wanted
now to make the in.itter a good
joke, is for Carpenter to come
out aud vouch lor the soberness
of President Grant ! That would
certainly settle the question ot
Matt being a decent man..
President's Message.
On our first page will bs
the President's Message in full.
The New York Sun, in speaking
ot this document eays: "The
message of Gen. Grant vfill dis
appoint the c untry generally,
and even the caiidi l members of
his own party. While dealing
seemingly somewhat in detail
with certain large questions up
on which the country desires to
know the opiuious and purposes
of the Administration, they are
really handled in a vague and
unsatisfactory mauner, leaving
one about as much in doubt, after
reading the message through,
concerning what Gen. Giant and
his Cabinet believe and inteud,
as on first taking up the document."
The Democratic party in New
York may congratulate itself that
the profeecution, conviction, and
twelve years' -sentence of Tweed
was principally due to the ac
tive influence of the prominent
men iu its own ranks. The dif-
ference between .Democrats and
Republicans is, that while the
former publish and punish scoun
drels in their own ranks, the lat
ter whitewash and screen theirs.
Let the editor of the Eaton Reg
ister make a note of this while
he is making merry and exulting
over the fact of the conviction of
a leading Democrat, for his steal
ing. Noyes is no better than
Tweed, and while the Democrats
sent their thief to the Penitenti
ary, the Republicans made an
effort to elect theirs Governor of
the State of Ohio. That is the
difference between the Demo
crats and Republicans of to-day.
v j
In alluding to the conviction
of Tweed as "contrary to the
usual mode of treating Demo,
cratic scoundrels," the Register
endeavors to cast a Btigma on
the Democratic party. Now, will
it please tell us what is the "usu
al mode" of Republicans how
many oi its scoundrels have been
tried and convicted, in the past
twelve years? And while the
Register has its hand in this bus
iness, it might just as well fur
nish its readers with a list of
the prominent Radicals in this
State as well as in the Nation at
large, equally as great scoundrels
as Tweed and fully as promiuent
in the Radical part' as ever
Tweed was in the Democratic
party, whose rascality the Regis
ter, along with other Radical
journals, are excusing and cov
ering over, instead of imitating
the example of the leading Dem
ocrats iu New York, exposing
them and using every effort to
.bring them to justice. "'Take
the beam out of thine own eye
and then shalt thou see clearly to
cast the mote out of thy brother's
eye.
Now
Tweed
that the conviction of
proves that scoundrels
who have stolen millions of the
people's money can be tried and
convicted, would it not be well
for other cities, afflicted with dis
honest oflicerR, to make an at
tempt to bring them to punish
ment. The Republican city of
Philadelphia would afford a
splendid field lor operations. We
know of no place where more
game of that kind might bo
brought down.
President's Message. A Bad Example.
Ve are not one uf those who
undertake to make the Adminis
tration . liable for every evil
which exists in i he country, from
irregularities of weather to finan
cial panics. But we do hold
tli at the course of the Radical
party during the past twelve
years has been one of su-di reck
less extravagance and political
demoralization, that it is respon
sible for inaiiv of the pocial and
po'.iticul evils frcm which the
people of the land suffer so giiev
onsly. The ase of public mon
eys increasing vv.th every session
of Congress, the utter ("isregard
of every restriction of decency
and honesty by the national leg
islature, and the examples of the
President himself, have nil tend
ed to generate habits of extrava
gance and pampered luxury,
which have taken root with fear
ful rapidity and spread over the
land, bearing the bitter fruits of
frequent financial ruin and ev
ery kind of social disorder.
There is a growing tendency to
hubits of living, which not only
are injur'ous in themselves, but,
which pressage that condition of
eociety which has marked the
decline o' every republic which
ever rose and fell. It is particu
larly impottant, that the rulers
of this nation and its representa
tives before the world, should
maintain that simplicity of re
finement and stern integrity of
economy, which iu the early
days of the Republic, won for it
the sympathy and confidence of
the whole world. Instead of this,
the present Administration has
by its example, pandered to and
encourased the tendencies of the
age, and its influence has been
potent in favor of the establish
ment of social customs totally at
variauce with the spirit or stabil
ity of our institutions. The man
sion ol the President has been
made the centre of luxuTy, to
support which most lavish ap
propriations have been ' made,
and the recent salary eteal of
$100,000 was rendered necessary.
As an example of the "style,'
which marks the domestic econ
omy ot the White Uouee, We
copy the following from the El-
rnira Herald:
"At the Corning Glass Works
a set- of glassware, destined for
the Presidential Mansion, has
just been completed. It consists
of two dozen goblets, which are
cut about halfway up the bowl,
the remainder ot the bowl being
richly engraved, and prominent.
among it is the United States
coat of arms: four'dozen cham-
Lpagne glasses and saucer bowls,
cut and engraved as the goblets;
cwo dozen regular champagne
glasses, engraved as the others;
six dozen canary colored hock
glasses; Eeven dozen rubj'-bowl,
flint stem sauterene glasses
The colored glasses are very
superior. There are also four
dozen claret, six dozen sherry
and four dozen cordial glasses;
two dozen finger bow ls, which
are cut and engraved with the
coat of arms; three dozen punch
glasses, with handles; four d zen
ice cream plates, cut and engrav
ed as the glasses. The value of
this glass is about 2,000. . It is
not a full set, but ordered to make
good the full set sent to the White
House some time since. It is gt
ten up with the beat of taste, and
of most exquisite pattern,
engraving ia perfect."
The
In the modest days of Martin
Van Bureo's administration, an
inventory of the furniture of the
White House was taken, and its
publication excited a storm of
indignation against public ex
travagance, which swept over
the whole land.
In times like these, when bun
drtds and thousands of working-
men see nothing before them
but sore distress and pinching
want, what would be the result
on the party in power, if the
people could be furnished with
an inventory of the '-household
and kitchen furniture" of our ex
ecutive mansion, wherein 2,000
worth of glassware is needed to
"complete a full set." What an
example to the world of the sim
plicity of Republican , inslilu
n t
tions : dnu it is scarcely a cen
tury since Benjamin Franklin, in
home spun garb, represented the
nation in the courts of E-uope.
O ! the times. O ! the manners.

What the People Expect
of Congress.
In the Forty-third Congress,
which assembled last Monday
week, tlie Republican? have ov
erwhelming majorities in both
houses. That party will be held
to a rigid accountability lor what
Concrete does or fails to do to
get rid of the thieves and plun
dere-H, great and small, who have
so lunar ruled aud robbed the
people.
The minds of tnc poor le are
steadily iixed upon this particu
lar subject, and these particular
men. Long spun speeches and
harangues sibout Cuba and the
money panic, accompanied by
high sounding threats of war
and shallow schemes of finance,
will not be allowed to divert pub
ic attention from the brazen
rogues'in Congress, and the mal
tcasencss whcieof they have been
proved guiby. Evesybody knows
who the culptits are and where
in they have offended; and all
erood citizens regard it as among
the first duties of Congress to
sweep its own nails clean ot us
own. rascals.
Until the two Houses do this,
few people will lie disposed to
listen putiently to their talk either
about the sacred nosa of the A
mericau Hag or Uhj expediency
of specie payment'. The peo
ple don't want to bu preached to
Vby Credit Mobilier bribe-takers,
back-pay and forwardpay grab
bers, and Pacific Railway swin
dlers ; by Senators who have
bought their seats and Represen
tatives who have sold their votes;
by politicians who fawn upon
power that they may enjoy its
patrouage, nnd covet places of
trust that they may plunder the
public.
The first session of the pres
ent Congress will have much to
do with determining the future
of the Republican party.
We agree with the Cinciuna
ti .' nquircr, that the seventy -sev
en Democratic members of the
House who voted for Ferxaxijo
Wood, for Speaker, -"blundered
out of a charity which su.Tcreth
long aiid is kind." It would be
more correct to say that the
Democratic caucus and the gen
tlemen who followed "its bidding
outrageously and disgracefully
violated the pledges of the party,
ignored the wishes of the great
body of men.tb.ey profess to rep
resent, and offended the better
instincts of the honest friends of
Democracy.
It is true, Fernando did not
vote for the salary grab he was
absent and lhe New York
World states upon authority, that
had he been present he would
not have done so, but aside from
this, he was so closely connected
with Boss Tweed in his robbery
of the city of New York, that he
has not the record of a very hon
esS man, ana we tninK a more
creditable selection for the Dem
ocratic complimentary vote could
have been made, and thus proved
that the party is sincere in its de
mands for honest aud spotless
men in public positions. AVe will
see, however, how -they will act
when the repeal of that infa
mous robbing scheme comes to
a vote.
The general opinion is that we
have touched the bottom of the
financial crisis, and that from the
present a better state of financial
affairs may be confidently ex
pected. We are heartily glad
of this and think the facts war
ra:it this conclusion. Business
appears to be everywhere im
proving and more confidence is
manifested in financial and busi
ness circles. Many of the rail
road companies are ie employing
their discharged bands and the
iron and other manufacturing
establishments are resuming bus
iness, and suspended bankers
have again opened their doors
This is cheerful and makes us all
feel as if the wolf had been driv
en from our doors.
Our yearly supply of gold at
the date of the discovery of the
precious metals in California was
about 3,000.000. It sprang up
at once to 25.000,000, running
up to its uiaqium figure in 1853
of o'8,000,00O. For the last sev
en or eight years it has averaged
not far from 70.000,000.
[From the N. Y. Sun, Dec. 2.]
We yesterday bad the fortune
to receive the following commu
nication :
"Sir: The course you are tak
ing towards Spain is ruining
your paper here and throughout
the West. At a meeting here
last night you aud your paper
were condemned as trying to
raise a Avar with noble old Spain,
that b.ae done more for the hu
man family than all the other
nations of Europe together. The
resolutions passed declare that
you have been trying for years
past to get up a war between the
United States and .;pain, and
therefore that we as Democrats
cannot support yon nor your
paper so long as you pursue your
preseut course. W are sorry to
abandon The Sun. Meetings are
to be held in other places.
Many Subscribers.
"Lkwisburg, Preble County, Ohio
Nov. 25, 1873."
All the Democrats of Preble
county who arc dissatisfied with
The Sun's advocacy ot Cuban in
dependence and willing that the
Hag ot the United btate-i snould
be insulted on tlie high seas are
respectfully invited never to read
it again, and to find some other
paper that will bo more agreea
ble to their sentiments.
If there have been any anti
Cuba war meetings held in Lew
isbnrg, b' Democrats: or any
other partisans, our reporter at
that point, deserves to be quar
tered for neglect of duty. We
are of the opinion, however, that
the above communication was
got nil by some cowardly Radi
cal that was a vigorous war man
during the late "unpleasantness,''
but remained at home to abuse
his neighbors for not going into
the fight.

Nine hundred and forty thou
sand operatives are employed in
the production . of iron in the
United States; 42,000 of these
are employed in preparing ore
and fuel; 25,000 in preparing
fuel for rolling mills; 42,000 in
the rolling mill; 22,500 in blast
furnaces aud 3,000 in bioomer
ies; 80,000 are engaged in man-
ufacuring articles of iron. Thus
we have a total of 940,000 men
emplo3-ed in the iron interest.
The value of pig i ; on manufac
tured last year was $75,000,000.
Ti e production of tho rolling
mills and forges was $03,000,000
and the value of other manufac
tured iron for the year was D00,
000,000. The Buifalo Courier says that
the rejoicing of vario us organs
ef the administration over the
conviction of Twuerl, and their
snarling pretentions that none ot
their sort of elect shrll be grati
fied by the dawn of a new and
better era in iolitic3, ia purlieu
larly amusing and .euggeetive
view of the fact that these same
prints applauded a President
who recently let a half million
thief, Paymaster Hodge, loose
from the Albany penitentiary,
and procured the pardon of the
Philadelphia municipal thieves,
Marcher and Yerkes from the
Pennsylvania State prison.
The Constitutional Convention
has reassembled at Cincinnati.
The members were on hand
force at the hour of opening.
Their ; onstituents sincerely hope
they will go to work in earnest
and finish up the job, which
might juntas well have been
completed in Columbus before
the meeting of the Legislature.
Samuel J. Ttlden, a Democrat,
insured the detection of William
JVT. Tweed. Mr. Tilden now
6tands higher than ever in the
Democratic party. What lead
ing Republican has brought any
of the Republican . robberies
the light and yet retained his po
sition in the Republican party?
lhe public debt statement for
the last month furnishes the
cheerful bit of information that
the increase of the debt for the
thirty days immediately prece
ding the first of December, was
only $9,038,576. That's all.
Besido the surprising develop
ment of strength among the
farmers, there was another sig
nificant feature in the Illinois
elections. There were special
elections to fill live vacancies in
the Legislature, that number of
Republican members having re
s!gned, and not a single Republi
can was elected.

Some salient facts about Cuba
are in order at tins time, ine
island lies only 130 miles south
of Florida. It has nearly 50,G0O
square miles of area and a coast
line of 1,600 miles. The island
is intersected by a range of lofty
mountains, running east and
west. Eastern and Western Cu
ba arc the political divisions, the
former being the home of the re
bellion. The population ot East
ern Cuba is. whites, 100,000; col
ored, 143,000. Western Cuba,
whites, 376,000; colored, 399,000.
Of these latter 305,000 are slaves.
Total population, 1,021,000.
Defalcations and embezzle
ments are becoming so numer
ous among the Radical officials
in Iowa that they are no longer
telegraphed, A Deamoinea (Iowa)
paper has the following list of
defaulters in one issue :
"James D. Ends, State Super
intendent of Schools, 150,000.
"James A. Byran, Treasurer of
Jackson county, 50,000.
"The Treasurer of Dubuque
county, 3d,00'J.
'Tlie Treasurer of Decatur
county, 12,000."
The reform movement iu the
West was not begun ine day too
soon.
Professor Chandler, of New
York, in a paper read before the
Health 'Association, said that
during the war there Was a ru
mor that Southern emissaries in
tended to poison the drinking
water of the city. He made a
little calculation of the matter,
aud found to poison I he water
supply of the city for a single
day would require one hundred
and fourteen tons f arsenic or
three and a half tons of sirj-ch-
nine, of which there was proba
bly not a ton in the whole world
