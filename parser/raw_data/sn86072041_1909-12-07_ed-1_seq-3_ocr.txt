PRESIDENT TAFT'S
MESSAGE
(Continued from Page Two.)
trust and interstate commerce laws «
which will be discussed in a separate j
message.
The president says the actual loss \
growing out of the transmission of ,
second class mail matter amounts to |,
about $63,000,000 a year. Congress, ,
he says, may well consider whether j,
radical steps should not be taken ton
reduce the deficit by imposing a high-• j
er rate on magazines and periodicals, j j
President Taft says he is convinced \i
the people desire for postal savings • <
bank and that they would be produc- ; -
live of the utmost good. He says of|«
them: ''They will furnish a satis-[«
factory substitute for the system of i'
a government guaranty of deposits J'
which, with deference to those who;'
advocate it, seems to me to have in it,'
the seeds of demoralization to Con-P
servative banking and certain finan
cial disaster."
The president earnestly recom- \
mends the passage of a ship subsidy
bill.
In recommending separate state-N
bood for New Mexico and Arizona,; \
the president advises that after the.J
adoption of a constitution if be sub- J a
mitted to the people for approval.j«
State officers should not be elected ' j
until the constitution has been voted 1
upon. j
"With respect to Alaska." said the j
president, "I recomend legislation;!
which shall provide for the appoint- \
ment by the president of a governor j 4
and also of an executive council, the j
members of which shall, during their: j
term of office, reside in the territory, j j
and which shall have legislative now- j
era sufficient to enable it to give the! j
territory local laws adapted to ;, s||
present growth. I strongly deprecate jl
legislation looking to the election of i j
a territorial legislature in that vast!j
district." 1 \
The president mentions the neces-li
sity for legislation looking to thell
further conservation of natural re-|<
sources and announces that a special!J
message on the subject, including that •
of waterways, reclamation, irrigation,l l
reforesting, etc.. will be sent to con-M
gress early. Transfer of control over j i
the lighthouse to a suitable civilian \ j
bureau is recommended because ofij
frequent friction due to the absence' \
of any central independent authority, j j
"White slavery" is discussed, the 1 1
view being that there is urgent neces- j 1
sity for additional legislation andj]
greater executive power to suppress II
j.
1 believe It to be constitutional. M

the president says, * to forbid, under M
penalty, the transportation of per- f \
sons for purposes of
across national and state lines; and] \
by appropriating a fund of $30,000 to !
be used by the secretary of commerce j .
;ind labor for the employment of
<
special inspectors, it will be possible
to bring those responsible for this
trade to indictment and conviction,; j
under a federal law." j
The president says that while the J
medical departments of the armyfi
and navy must be kept separate, there ] i
seems to be no reason why all th" [J
other bureaus and officers in the gen-j<
eral government which have to doli
with the public health should not be «
united in a bureau to be called the j'
"Bureau of Public Health."
In conclusion, the president says: '
"Speaking generally, the country '
is in a high state of prosperity. There
is every reason to believe that we are
on the eve of a substantia] business
expansion and we have just garner
ed a harvest unexampled in the mar-1
ket value of our agricultural pro- j
ducts.
"The high prices which products
bring, mean great prosperity for the
farming community, but on the other
hand, they mean a very considerably
increased burden upon those classes
in the community whose yearly com-|
pensation does not expand with thei
improvement in business and the gen-j
eral prosperity. Various reasons ate!
given for the high prices. The pro
portionate increase in the output of
gold which today is the chief medium
of exchange and is in some respects
a measure of values, furnishes a sub
stantial explanation of at least part of
the increase in prices. The increase
in population and more expensive j
mode of living of the people, which
have not been accompanied by a pro
portionate increase in acreage pro
duction, may furnish a further rea
son. It is well to note that the in
crease in the cost of living is not con
fined to this country, but prevails thei
world over and that those who would!
charge increase in prices to the exist-1
ing protective tariff must meet the'
fact that the rise in prices has taken
place almost wholly in those pro
ducts of the factory and farm in re
spect to which there has been neither
no increase in the tariff or in many
instances a very considerable reduc
tion."
