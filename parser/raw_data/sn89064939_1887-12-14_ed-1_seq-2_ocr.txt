of the Surplus Urgent.y Urged.
.To the Congress of the United States: You
are confronted ,ac the threshold of your leg
islative duties with a conditiea of the na
tional finances whioh imperatively demands
immediate and careful consideration. The
amount of money annually exacted, tbrousrh
the .operation of present laws, frdm the in
dustries and necessities of the peopie largely
exceeds the sum necessary to meet the ex
penses the government When we con
sider tbat the theory our institutions
guarantee to every dt&en the full enjoy
ment of ail the fraits of his industry acd en
terprise, with only such deduction as may
be his share towards the easeful and econom
ical maintenance of the government which
protects him. it is plain that the exaction .of
more than this js indefensible extortion and
a culpable betrayal of American fairness and
justice. This wrong inflicted upon those
who bear the burden of national taxation,'
like .other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil
consequences. The public treasury, which
should only exist AS a conduit con
veying the people's tribute to its le
gitimate objects of expenditure, be
comes a hoarding place for money need
lessly withdrawn from trade and the peo
ples' use, thus crippling our national ener
gies, suspending our country's develop
ment, preventing investment in productive
enterprise, threatening financial disturb
ance and inviting- schemes of public plunder.
This condition of our treasury is not alto
gether new and it has more than once of
late been submitted ro the people's repre
sentatives in the congress, who alone can
apply a remedy. And vet the situation still
continues, with aggravated incidents, more
than ever presaging financial convulsion
and wide-spread disaster. It will not do to
neglect this situation because its dangers are
not now palpably imminent and apparent.
They exist none the lesB certainly, and await
the unforeseen and unexpected occasion,
when suddenly they will be precipitated
noon us. n June 30, 1885, the excess of
revenues over public expenditures after
complying'with the annual requirement of
the sinking fund act, was $17,859,735.84
during the year ended June 30. 1886, such
excess amounted to $49,405,545.20 and
during the year ended June 30, 1887. it
reached $55,567,849.50. The annual con
tributions to
S.V THE SINKING FOND ifi&.^i.
during the three years above specified,
amounting in the aggregate to $138,-
05S.S20.94, and deducted from the
surplus as. stated, were made by
calling in for that purpose out
standing 3 per cent bonds of the govern
ment During the six months prior to June
30. 1887, the surplus revenue had grown so
large by repeated accumulations, and it was
feared the withdrawal of this great sum of
money meeded by the people would so affect
MIA business of the country, that $79,864,-
106 of sucE BUn^H?
applied to the pay

ment of the principal ana, interest of the 3
percent bonds still outstanding, and which
were then payable at the option of toe goy.
ernmentk The precarious condition of
financial affairs among the people still need
ing relief, immediately after Jane 30, 1887,
the remainder of the 3 per cent bonds then
outstanding, amounting with principal and
interest te $18,877,500. was called in and
applied to the sinking-fund contribution for
the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding
these operations of the treasury department,
representations of distress in business cir
cles not only continued but increased, and
absolute peril seemed at hand. In these cir
cumstances the contribution to the sinking
fund for the current fiscal year was at once
completed by the expenditure of $27,684,-
283.55 in the purchase of government bonds
not yet due bearing 4 and 4*2 per cent inter
est, the premium paid thereon averaging
about 2 4 per cent for the former and 8
per cent for the latter. In addition
to this the interest accruing during
the current year upon the outstanding bond
ed indebtedness of the government was to
some extent anticipated, and banks selected
as depositories of public money were per
mitted to somewhat increase tneir deposits.
While the expedients thus employed to re
lease to the people the money lying idle in
the treasury seryed to avert immediate dan
ger, our surplus revenues have continued to
accumulate, the.excess for the present vear
amoumin? on Dec. 1 to $55,258,701.19,
and estimated to reach $113,000,000 on
June 3 0 next, at which date it is expected
that this sum, added to prior accumulations,
will swell the surplus in the treasury to
$140,000,000. There seems to be no assur
ance that, with buch a withdrawal from use
of the people's circulating medium, our
business community may not in the near fu
ture be subjected to the same distress which
was quite, lately produced irom tne same
cause. And while the functions of OUT na
tional treasury should be few and simple
and while its best condition would, be
reached, I believe, by its entire disconnec
tion with 'private business interests, yet,
when by a perversion of its purposes, it idly

from the channels of trade, there seems to
he reason for the claim that some legitimate
means should be devised by the
government to restore in an eraer
genov, without waste or extravagance,
such money to its place among the people.
If such an emergency arises there now ex
ists no clear and undoubted executive power
of relief. Heretofore-the redemption of 8
per cent" bonds, which were payable at the
Option of the government, nas afforded a
means for the disbursement of the excess of
our revenues but these bonds have all been
retired, aud there are no bonds outstanding
the payment of which we have the right to
insist upon. The contribution to the sinking
fund which furnishes the occasion for ex
penditure in the purchase of bonds has
already tteen made for the current year, so
that there is no outlet in that direction. In
the present state of legislation the only pre
tense of any existing legislative power to
restore, at this time, any part of our surplus
revenues to the people by its expenditure
consi8SS in the supposition that the secretary
of tLe treasury may enter the market ana
purchase the bonds of the government not
yet due at a rate of premium to be agreed
upon. The only provision of law from w^lch
6ucb a power could be derived iB found in an
appropriation bill passed a number of years
ago and it is subject to the* suspicion
that,-.it was intended tompetatj and
limited in, its application,)instead of con
ferrimr a continued disuration and author
ity. No condition, ought to exist -which
would justify the graat-of .power to a single
official, upon his judgment.of-its necessity,
to withhold from or"release to the business
of the people, in an unvsoal .manner, money
held in the treasury, and thus .affect, at his
will the financial situation of the coontrv
and. if it is deemed wise to lodge in the sec
retary of the treasury the authority in the
present juncture to pturohase bonds it
should be plainly vested an i provided as far
as possible with ouch checfee and limitations
as will define this omciaTs right and discre
tion, and at the same tune xelieveiluan from
undue responsibility. In considerinr the
question of purchasing beads as. a means of
restoring to circulation the surplus moody
accumulating in*the treasury, it should be
borne in mind that premiaaaeanustdf .coarse
be paid upon such purchase, that these may
be a large part of these bonds held as^in vest
ments which cannot be purchased.at any
price, and that combinations amongtholders
who are willing to sell, may unreasonably
enhance the cost of such bonds to .the gov
ernment. It has been suggested that
THE 2BE8EMT BOKDSS) tMBBff j,^^/'
*might be refunded at a less rate ef interest
and the difference between the .old and .new
.security paid in cash, thus finding use for
the surplus in the treasury. The success of
itttffl plan, it is apparent, must depend oupou
the volition of the holders of the present
bonds and it is not entirely certain thatithe
inducement which must be offered tiiem
would result in more financial benefit toithe'
ggov-esmaent than the purchase ef bonds,
whue the latter proposition would reduce1
tbeprjracipal of the debt by actual payment
instead of extending it The proposition so
deposit the money held by the government
inibai&s throughout the country for use by
the people is, it seems to me, exceedingly
objectionable in principle, as establishing
too.close a relationship between the opera
tions, of .the government treasury and ihe
business of the country, and too extensive a
commingling of their money, thus fostering
an nnnatur&l leliance in private business
uponpublic^funda If this scheme should
be adopted it should only be done as a tem
porary expedient to meet an urgent neces
sity. Legislative and executive effort should
generally be 4c the opposite direction and
should haye a tendency to divorce, as much
and as fast as.can safely be done, the treas
ury department from private enterprise.
Of course It is,not expected that unnecessary
and extravagant appropriations will be made
for the purpose oi.avoiding- the accumulation
of an excess of revenue. Such expendi ture,
beside the demoralization of all just con
ceptions of pu&ie .duty which it entails,
solum.ates a habit of reckless improvidence
not in the least consistent with the mission of
our people or the high and beneficent pur
poses of our government. I have deemed it
my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of
xcy countrymen, as well as co the attention
of their representatives charged with the re
sponsibilicies of legislative relief, the gravity
of oar financial situation. The failure of con
gress heretofore to provide against the' dan
gers which it was quite evident the very na
ture of the difficulty must necessarily pro
duce, caused a condition of financial distress
and apprehension since your last aojoum
menfc which taxed to the utmost all the au
thority and expedients within executive con-,
Urol and these uppear now to be exhausted.'
It disaster results from the continued inac
tion of congress, tne responsibility must rest
where it belongs, 'i hough the situation thus
far considered is fraught with danger which
Bhouid be uily realized, and though it pre
sents features of wrong to the people as well

it is but a result growing but of a per
fectly palpable and apparent cause, con
stantly reproducing the samo alarming cir
cumstancesa congested national treasury
and a depleted monetary condition in the
business of the country. It need hardly be
stated that while the present situation de
mands a remedy, we can only be saved from
a like predicament In the future by the re
moval of its cause. Our scheme of taxation,
by means of which this needless surplus is
taken from the people and put into the pub
lio treasury, consists of a tariff or duty levied
upon importations from abroad and internal
revenue taxes levied upon the consumption
of tobacco and spirituous and malt liquors.
It must be conceded that none of the things
subjected 10 internal revenue taxatiou are,
Strictly speaking, necessary. There appears
to be no just con%lain of this taxation by
the consumers of these articles, and there
seems to be nothing so well able to bear the
burden without hardship to any portion of
the people But our present tariff laws, the
vicious, inequitable, and illogical source of
unnecessary taxation, ousbt to be at once
revised and amended. These laws, as their
primary aud plain effect, raise the price to

ures, because they render it possible for
those of- our people who are manufacturers
to make these taxed articles and sell them
for a price equal to that demanded for the
imported goods that have paid customs duty.
So it happens that while comparatively a few
use the imported articles, millions of our
people, who never use and never saw any of
the imported products, purchase and use
things of the same kind made in this country
and pay therefor nearly or quite the same
charged price which the duty adds to the
imported articles. Those who buy imports
pay the duty charged thereon into the pub
lic treasury, but the great majority of our
citizens who buy domestic articles of the
same class pay a sum at leapt approximately
equal to this duty to the home manufact
urer. This reference to the operarton of our
tariff laws is not made by way of instruc
tion, but order that we may be constantly
reminded of the manner in which they
IMPOSE A BUBPEK
upon those who consume domestic products
as well as those who consume imported
articles, and thus create a tax upon allour
people. It is not proposed to entirely re
lieve the country of this taxation. It "must
be extensively continued as the source of
the government's income and in a readjust
ment of our tariff the interests of American
labor engaged in manufacture should be
carefully considered, as well as the preserva
tion of our manufacturers. It may be called

from the hardships and dangers of our pres

this existence shou.'a not mean a condition
which, without regard to-the public welfare
or a national exigency, must always insure
the realization of Immense profits instead of
moderately profitable returns. As the vol
ume and diversity 'of our national activities
increase* new recruits are added to those
who desire a continuation of tbeadvantages
which they conceive" the present system of
tariff' taxation directly' affords them. So
stubbornly have all efforts to reform the
present condition been resisted by those of
our fellow cieisens~ihus engaged, that they

allegation that they are in a minority among

pricesfe the majority their compensation,
as maybe ab'ected by the operation of tariff
laws, should at all times be kept sorupul
ausly in \view and yet, wito slight reflec
tion th^y will not overlook the fact that they

have their own wants and those of their
families to supply from their earnings, and
that the price of the necessaries of life, as
well as the amount of their wages,will regu

manded should be so measured as not to
necessitate or justify either the loss of em
ployment by the workingman nor the lessen
ing of his wages. and the profits still re
maining to the manufacturer, after a neces
sary readjustment, should furnish no excuse
for the sacrifice of the interests of his em
ployes, either iu their opportunity to work
or in the diminution of their compensation.
Nor can the worker in manufactures fail to
understand that while a high tariff is claimed
to be necessary to allow the payment
of remunerative wages, it certainly results
in a very large increase in the price of nearly
all sores of manufactures, which, in almost
countless forms, he needs for the use of him
self and his family. He receives at the desk
of his employer his wages, and perhaps be
fore he reaches his 'home is obliged, in a
purchase for family use of an article which
embraces his own labor, to return in the
payment of the increase in price which the
tariff permits the hard-earned compensation
of many days of toil
WOOL.
The Kemoral or Reduction of Duties There
on Suggested, Supported by Exhaustive
Argument.
The farmer or agriculturist who manu
factures nothing but who pays the increased
price which the tariff imposes upon every
agricultural implement, upon all he weais
and upon all he uses and owns, except the
increase of his flocks and herds and such
things as his husbandry produces from the
soil, is invited to aid in maintaining the
present situation and he is told that a high
duty, on imported wool is necessary for those
who have sheep po shear, in order that the
price of their wool may by increased Threy,
of course, are not reminded that the farmer
who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged,
in his purchases of 'clothing and woolen
goods, to pay a tribute to his fellow farmer
as well as to the manufacturer and- mer-
chant nor is any mention made of the fact
that the sheep owners themselves and their
households must wear clothing and
use other articles manufactured from the
wool they sell at tariff prices, and thus
as consumers must return their shares
of this increased price of the tradesman. I
thinkitmaybe fairly assumed that a large
proportion of the sheep owned by the farm
ers throughout the country are found in
small nooks numbering from twenty-five to
fifty. The duty on the grade of imported
wool whioh these' ehep yield is ten cents
each pound if of the value of thirty cents or
less, and twelve cents if of the valqe of more
than thirty cents. If the liberal es-imate of
sjx pounds be allowed for each fleece,- the
duty thereon would be sixty or seventy-two
cents, and this may be taken as the utmost
ennanoement of its price to the farmer by
reason of thjs duty. Eighteen dollars would
thus represent the increased price of the
wool from twent?rfiv sheep and $ 36 that
from te woolof fifty sheep, andal. present
values this addition would amount to about
one-third of its price. If upon its sale the
farmer receives tbis or a less tariff profit, the
wool leaves his hands charged with precisely
that sum, which in all its changes will ad
here to it until it reaches the consumer.
When manufactured into cloth and other
goods and material for use, its cost is not
only increased to the extent of the
farmer's tariff profit, but a further
sum has been added for the profit
of the manufacturer under the operation of
thero tariff mws. In the meantime the day
arrives when the farmer fiuds it necessary
to purchase woolen goods and material to
othe himself and family for the winter.
When he faces the tradesman for that pur
pose be discovers that he Is obliged not only
to return, in the way of increased prices, bis
tariff profit on the wool he sold, and wh.oh
then perhaps lies before him in manufact
ured form, but that be must add a consider
able sum thereto to meet a further increase
in cost paused by a tariff duty on the manu
facture. Thus in the end he is aroused to
the fact that he has paid upon a moderate
purchase as a. result of the tariff scheme,
which, when he sold his wool, seemed so
profitable,

Ko demand is.made that they shall forego all
tie benefits .of the governmental regard:
.bat they cannot fail to be admonished of
their duty, as well as their enlightened self
interest and safety, when they are reminded
.of tfce fact that financial panic and .collapse,
to -which the present condition tends, afford
no gneater shelterr protection to our manu
facturers than our other important enter
prises. Opportunity far safe, careful, and
deliberate reform i now offered and none
of us should be unmindful of a time when
an abused and irritated people, heedless of
those who have resisted timely and reason
able relief, may insist upon a radical and
sweeping rectification of their wretos-s.
The difficulty attending a wise and
fair revision of our tariff laws is
not under estimated. It will re
quire on the part of the congress great labor
and care, ana especially a broad and national
contemplation of the subject, and a patriotic
disregard of snch local &nd selfish claims as
are unreasonable and regardless of the wel
fare of the entire country. Under our pres
ent laws more tnan four thousand articles
are subject to duty. Many of these do not
in any way compare with our own manu
factures, and many are hardly worth atten
tion as subjects of revenue. A considerable
reduction can be made in the atrarregote by
more, than sufficient to sweep away all the
tariff profit he received upon the wool he
produced and sold. When the number of
farmers engaged in wool raising is compared
with aM the farmers in the country, and the
Small proportion ihey bear to our popula
tion is considered when it is made Apparent
tnat, in the case of a large part of those who
own Sheep, the benefit of the present tariff
on wool is iliusory, and. above, ail, when it
must be conceded that the Increase of
the cost of* living caused by such
tariff becomes a burden upon those
with moderate means and the poor, the
employed ana unemployed, the sick and
Well, and the young and old, and that it eonr
stltutes a tax which, with relentless grasp
is fastened upon the clothing of every man,
woman and child in the land, reasons are
suggested why the removal or reduction of
this dutv'should be included in a revision of
a tariff lawa In speaking of the increased
cost to the consumer of our home manufact
ures, resulting from a duty -laid upon im
ported articles of the same description, the
look la not overlooked that competition
among our domestie producers sometimes
has the effect of keeping U&price of their
products below the highest limit allowed by
such duty. But it is notiortoun that this com
petition is too often strangled by combina
tions quite prevalent at this time, and fre
quentivjoaued trusts, which have for their
oi ject'ihe regulation of the supply and price
of commodities made aud sold tty members
of the combination. The people can barely
hope for any consideration in the operation
of these selfish schemes. If, however, in
the absence of such combinations, a healthy
and free competition reduces the price of
any particular dutiable ariicie of home proT
auction below the limit which it might oth

'with such reduced price, its manufacture

that one thing has been discovered which
should be carefully scrutinized in an effort
to reduce taxation. The necessity of com-

modity -to the ^tariff point furnishes proof
thaf some onetis willing to accept lower
prices for such eommodity, and that such
prices are remunerative and lower prices
produced by coanpetition prove the same
thing. Thus where either of these conai
tions exist a case would seem to be pre
sented for an easv redaction of taxation. The
considerations which have been presented
touching our tariff laws are intended only to
enforce an earnesi^recommendation that the
surplus revenue of i,the government be. pre

aud, at the same time, to emphasize ^sug
gestion that in accomplishing this purpose
weonay discharge a double duty to our peo
ple by granting to them a measure at relief
from tariff taxation in. quarters where it is
most needed and from .sources where it can
be,most fairly and.justly accorded. Nor can
the presentation made of such .consider
ations be, wi
any degree of, fairness, re
garded as evidence of unfriendliness toward
ear. manufacturing interests, or of any lack
of appreciation of their value and .im-
portance. These interests:constitute alead
'ingand most substantial element of our na
tional greatness and furodsh the proud*prOof
of our country's progress. But if in the

ADDING THEM TO THE FREE'LIST.
The taxation of luxuries presents no feat
ures of hardship but the necessaries of life
used and consumed by all people, the duty
upon which adds to the cost of living in
every home, should be greatly cheapened.
The radical reduction of the duties imposed
noon raw material U6ed in manufactures, or
its free importation, is, of course, an im
portant factor in any effort te reduce the
price of these necessaries it would not only
relieve them from the increased cost caused
by the tariff on such material, but the man
ufactured product being rhus cheapened tbat
part of the" turiff now laid upou such product
as compensation to our manufacturers for
the present price of raw material could
be accordingly modified. Such reduc
tion, or free importation, would serve
beside to largely reduce the revenue. It is
not apparent how such a change can have
any injurious effect upon our manufacturers.
On the contrary it would appear to give them
a better chance in foreign markets with the
manufacturers of other countries, who
cheapen their ware with tree material. Thus
our people might have the opportunity of
extending their sales beyond home con
sumption, saving them from the depression,
interruption in business, and loss caused by
glutted domestic market, and affording their
employes more certain and steady labor,
with its resulting quiet and contentment
The question thus imperatively presented
for solution should be approached in a
spirit higher than partisanship, and consid
ered in the light of tbat regard for patriotic
duty which should characterize the^aotion
of those intrusted with the weai of a confid
ing people. But the obligation to declared
party policy and principle is not wanting to
urge prompt and effective action. Bothef
the great politcal parties now represented
in tUe government have, by repeated and
authoritative declarations, condemned
the condition of laws which permit
the collection from the people of un
necessary revenue, and have, in the most
sol mo manner promised its correction and
neither as citizens nor partisans are our
countrymen in a mood to condone the de
liberate violation of these pledges. Oar
Erogress toward a wise conclusion will not
improved by dwelling upon the theories
of prorection and free trade. This savors
too much of bandying epithets It is a con
dition which confronts us, not a theory.
Belief from this condition may involve a
slight reduction of the advantages which we
award our hme productions, but the entire
withdrawal of such advantages should not
be contemplated.
is absolutely irrelevant, and the persistent
claim made in certain quarters that all
efforts to Have the people from unjuxt and
inecessary taxation are schemes of so
called free traders, is mischievous and far
removed from any consideration for the
public good. The simple and plain duty
which we owe the people is to reduce taxa
tion to the necessary expense-of an econom
ical operation of the government, and to re
store to the business of the country the
money which we hold in the treasury
through the pet version of governmental
powers. These things can and should be
done witn safety to ail our industries, with
dus danger to the opportunity for remun
erative labor which our workingmen need
and with benefit to them and all oar people,
by cheapening their means of subsistence
and increasing the measure of their com
forts. The constitution provides tbat th
president "shall, from time to time, give to
the congress information of the state of the
Union." It has been the custom of the ex
ejsutive. in compliance with this provision
to annually exhibit to the congress, at the
opening of its session, the general condition
of the country, and to detaiif with some par
ticularity, the operations of the different
executive departments. It would be espec
ially agreeable to follow this course at the
present time, and to call attention to thr
valuable tccomplishments of these depart
ments during the last fiscal year. But! au.
so much impresses with the paramount im
portance of the subject to which tbis com
