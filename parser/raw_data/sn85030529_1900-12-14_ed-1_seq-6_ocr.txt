If
It is a Question of Which Woman
' Told the Truth. '
MORGAN'S DEPOSITION REC'D.
El Dorado, Pec. 10. When Jessie
Morrison took tho witness stnnd, she
was weak but hho met tho crisis with
firmness. As usual the spectators were
mostly women. Witnesses for the de
fense, first testified contradicting a
number of statements made by wit
nesses for the state.
The deposition of J. A. Morgan was
then introduced. Is a canvassing agent;
was canvassing El Dorado on June 23;
on that morning visited the house of
! the deceased, Mrs. Castle; after leaving
heard a knocking on tho inside or tlie
door screen; thought he was being
called back and looked that way; saw
Mrs. Castle was not looking at him but
at a small lndy who did not stop unl 1
Mrs. Castle said to her "Jess, come in
I want to talk to you." Before ho was
out of hearing he heard a scream, and
started back, and saw the small lady
brought out of the house. He then
left and the next morning left the
town.
Jessie Morrison then testified. Knew
Olin Castle; he called on me from once
to three times a week; often took me
buggy riding, and took me to parties.
He always furnished the conveyance,
the went to Excelsior Springs to visit
her sister. Never said to Castle "I'll
fix you." Did not make any threat
when she asked Castle for her letters.
Never wrote Castle an anonymous let
ter; never wrote him that she was in
trouble and for him to remember his
promise. Never wrote him about any
scheme." Castle gave me a mirror
and lie said Clara would make a scene
if he told her about it. She denied
every statement made by Castle in his
testimony. She hud never pot a razor
at the Backet store and never tried to
do so. Had no razor or knife in her
possession the fatal morning. When she
left Mrs. Davis' with the collar pattern
she started home, had no thought of
stopping at Castle's. Mrs. Castle called
her in. There was a man on the side
walk. Said nothing to Clara about
any letter. Was shown the razor; said
she had never seen it at that time; had
no sharp instrument in her pocket; had
no thought of trouble with Clara when
she went in.
Miss Morrison then related the story
of the fight.
Dnrinir a ouarrcl had dropped her
handkerchief and while picking it up
Clara had cut her throat. llien tlie
fight commenced, during which the
witness had takon the razor away from
Mrs. Cnstle and while Mrs. Castle was
on top of her, both on tho lounge and
on the floor, Mrs. Castle received the
slashes from the razor in the hands of
the witness. She saw only one razor.
Mrs. Moberly was the first one to enter,
she asked "What is the matter;' I re
plied, "she tried to kill me." Mrs.
. . . , i . i
Spnngler came in ana nsicea tnc same
an Mrs. Moberlv and I replied, "Clara
culled me in and tried to kill me and I
am afraid I have killed her." "I
formed down to take ray skirt from
under Clara and to put on one of my
slippers." "Did not try to conceal any
thing in my skirts." I had two hat
pins in my hand when I was going
home from Castle's, which had dropped;
had nothing else in my hands." .
i). At the time you used the razor
on Mrs. Castle did you believe 3'our life
was in danger? A. I did. There was
nothing said about a letter by either
of ub when I went into the house. Did
not ask Mrs. Castle if there was any
one about the house." I did not cut
myself."
In answer to cross examination she
said: Was-never engaged to Oil n Cas
tle. There waB no promise on either
side. Had no intention of going to
t'ie Castle hou-e when I left, home.
When I dropped my handkerchief and
before she cut me I heard her jump
toward the stand but I did not see her.
Mrs. Castle's first conversation com
menced with "You know that I hate
yon."
Judge Sltinn's charge to the jury
was considered to be, in effect at least,
very lenient and favorable toward
Jessie Morrison.
