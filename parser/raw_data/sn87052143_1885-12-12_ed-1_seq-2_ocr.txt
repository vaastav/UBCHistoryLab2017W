THE BRIDGE AND THE NEW RAIL
ROAD. -
ia tho two interviews recently held
with Mr. T. J. Potter, first vice-presi-
dentof the C, B.& Q rallroad.that gen-
tluiuau asserted that the building of a
bridge across the Missouri river was
the greatest impediment in the way of
the extension of that road southwest.
In an iuterview with the attorney of
the St. Joseph St St, Louis railway it
was ascertained that the owners of that
road were much dissatisfied with the
way their road was being treated by
the Wabash; that they seriously con
templated taking it Into their own con
trol; and that in that event they would
greatly desire to operate it from St.
Joseph directly into Lexington. A
letter was then received here from the
president of that road, Mr. Wm. F.
Nisbet, of New York, in which that
gentleman, among other things, said,
"In regard to a bridge at yonr city,
we feel deeply interested in such a
matter. It would be a very desirable
thing for as to have a bridge there,
and of incalculable benefit to your city.
Our board will meet one
week from to day." Mr. Nisbet asked
particularly for all information in our
possession for use at that directors'
meeting.
At a mass meeting of citizens of
Lexington the writer was requested
to attend the meeting of the board of
directors of the St. Joseph & St. Louis
railroad, in New York City, Tuesday,
December 1, which he did. There
was a full attendance ot the members
of the board, and he was received and
given an attentive bearing. Numer
ous questions were asked by the gen
tlemen present, regarding what had
already passed between our people and
the C, B. So Q. railway company; the
cost ot a bridge ; the probable business,
etc. The result of this meeting was,
that the gentlemen promised that their
board should be represented at the
conference to be held here in January
with Mr. Potter and other officers of
the C, B. A Q.
The writer spent almost the entire
day, Thursday, with Mr. Nisbet, in
discussing the bridge question as it
would effect the St. Joseph SB St. Louis
railroad. It ia not necessary here to
enter into details as to the condition of
the St. Joseph road. It is enough for
our purpose to know that it is out of
debt and abundantly able to do its part
toward building a bridge. Several ot
its directors are individually able to do
so. They are anxious to make their
road a paying one. It has been so in
the past. It can be made even more so
in the future by an active policy, with
able and honest management. The
best manager of a property, as a rule,
is its owner. These views Mr. Nisbet
entertains. But the present owners!
are so as investors; and to get them to ;
management will require conviction I
of probable profits. The hopeful
feature, for ns, is, that the road cannot
do worse than it has been doing, and
that some change must be made.
There are several propositions under
consideration, but
none of them are
thought, by those in interest with
whom we have conversed, so favorable
as direct management of the road
The president aud other gentlemen in
quired as to the feasibility of extend'
ing the road south to the C. & A. This,
thoy believe, will be desirable if they
cro3s the Missouri river.
Of course the opponents of this
movement will say at once, "O, it will
not pay." Have they investigated it?
The fact is, that there is every reason to
believe that it will pay, and pay
well. There is no reason why
the road, even from St. Joseph to the
Junction, should not pay. It traverses
beautiful, fertile and thickly settled
country, and with the connections at
the Junction, at Lathrop and at Platts-
burg, should do a good passenger as
well as freight business. Extend the
road to LexiDgton,thenco to the C.& A.,
the C, B. St Q. joining it here and
going on to Odessa and south ; then
look at the situation. First, we be
lieve, firmly, that a coal business of
twenty-five to thirty-five car loads per
dav could easily be developed here,
without injury to but rather with ben
efit to the Richmond mines, which are
now comparatively idle, not because
of lack of demand but because of ex
cessive freights. The net profit on the
minimum amount of the ooal busiuess
would more than pay the road's auuual
imerest upon its share of the cost ot
the bridge. The road then would
have as feeders, for passengers to St.
Joseph, all the country lying down the
Missouri Pacific, the M. K, U T- as far
as Clinton, aud a large portion of the
3c A. in this vicinity. It would
also have the C, B. St Q. at this point;
the Hannibal St. Joseph at Lathrop,
and the liock Island at Plattsburg.
With a quick and certain connection,
over a bridge, with the Missouri
Pacific, this is the natural route for
passengers from St. Louis and Jeffer
son City to St. Joseph. It is thirty
five miles shorter, and by reason of the
breaks and stops at Kansas City nearly
two hours quicker than going by way
of Kansas City. Properly conducted
it would do an immense passenger bus-
ness. It does some now and it is not
a railroad at all, but the mere pretense
of one. The Missouri Pacific couldu't
change its time table fast enough to
prevent it from making close connec
tions with its trains here; and if it did
so it would get the passengers. Anyone
who will take the trouble to look at a
map will see that what we say is true.
The only danger to us, who
want it to be an independent
line, lies in the temptation that would
benei Mr. Gould to buy it. He ought
to have done it in 1874 when he was
thinking aud figuring on the matter.
Lexington atoue, with its schools and
mines, would furnish a very considera
ble passenger traffic; and every road
I 11. IVUIliU blUDS TTUUIU IJO KlaU llJUHO
freight arrangements with It.
Tho argument makes itself. It is
only a question of time when these
thiugs must be done; and it seems to
us that this is the golden opportunity
for the St. Joseph road. Now it can
secure the co-operation of the C., B.
k Q., the people of St. Joseph aud
Lexington in building the bridge. If
it ucglecib this opportunity it will eith-
i the Wabash, or rent its St. Joseph end
! .u- ,.-.
to tho Rock Island. Tha lint will ho i
j easily; the second suicidal, aud the!
third humiliating and destructive to
a part of the property which is fully as
valuable as the other if properly man
aged.
But, may say some ot the siockuoiu-
j ore, "We bought those securities simply
. a, an investmeut ; we do not wish to
. be burdened with management." Well,
of what good are securities which
Krincr nn rplnrna? And 19 it not a
craven policy to see a valuable proper
ty wrecked and destroyed by adverse
management? Suppose the Wabash is
re-organized, what guarantee is there
that the whole system will not again
be wrecked? There are certainly
enough young and active men in the
St. Joseph ownership to seize the
treat opportunities which are now
presented to them, and to pluck out of
the jaws of apparent defeat a glorious
victory for their road.
St. Joseph Gazette: "The St
Joseph and St. Louis railroad, now
comparatively worthless, might yet be
made a most valuable road to this city
if a bridge for it could be built across
the Missouri river at Lexington. The
people of the Chicago, Burlington &
Quincy road are the proper people to
take bold of the resurrection of the St
Joseph SB St. Louis, but they ought to
have help. As it stands now, this pro
perty is dead to its owners aud dead to
St. Joseph. It might be made very
valuable. The road itself runs through
a splendid agricultural country, thickly
populated. It is tributary to St. Joseph,
and could be made to pour its entire
trade and traffic into this citv. With
a bridge at Lexington our manufactur
ers could be supplied with unlimited
quantities of cheap coal, and have an
other trunk line terminating here in
the shape ot the Chicago & Alton,
which has long been wishing to get
into the northwest. There is a good
deal for our shippers, merchants and
manufacturers to think about in con
nection with this proposition, and the
Board ot Trade should move in the
matter immediately."
General Schofield says that troops

the state of the Union and recommend
to their consideration such measures as
ho shall deem necessary aud expedient,
At the threshold of a compliance with
these constitutional directions, it
well for us to bear iu mind that our
usefulness to the people's interests will
be promoted by a constant appreciation
of the scope and character ot our re
speotive duties as they relate to federal
legislation.
DUTIES OF THE DEPARTMENTS
While the executive mav reoommeud
such measures as he shall deem expe
dient, the responsibility for legislative
contemplation of the grave and re
sponsible functions assigned to the ex
ecutivc brandies of the government
under the constitution will disclose the
partitions of power between onr re
spective departments and their necessa
ry independence and also the need for
the exercise of all the power entrusted
to each in that spirit of comity and co
operation, which is essential to the
proper fulfillment of the patriotic obli
gations which rest upon us as faithful
servants of tho people. The zealous
watchfulness of our constituencies,
great and small, supplements their suf
frages and before the tribunal they es
tablish every public servant should be
fudged.
FOREIGN RELATIONS GOOD,
It is gratifying to announce that the
relations ot the United States with all
foreign powers continue to be friendly,
Our position after nearly a century of
successful constitutional government,
maintenance of good faith in all our
engagements, the avoidance of compli
cations with other nations, and cousis
tent attitude toward the strong and
weak alike furnish proof of a politic
disposition which renders professions
of good will unnecessary. There are
no questions of difficulty pending with
any foreign government.
The Argentine government has re
vived the long dormant question of the
raiKiand islands b claiming from the
United States indemnity for their loss
attributed to the action of the commau
der of the sloop Lexiugton in breaking
up a piratical colony on those islands
in 1831, and their subsequent occupa
tion by Great Britain. In view of am
ple justification for the act ot the Lex
ington, and the derelict condition of
the islands before aud after their
alleged occupatiou by Argentine colo
msts, this government considers the
claim as wholly groundless.
MR. keilet's case revikwkd.
A question has arisen with the coy-
eminent of Austria-Hungary touching
tne representation oi the United States
at Vienna. Having under my const
tutional prerogative appointed an esti

aud competency as minister at that
court, the government of Austria-Hun
gary invited this government to cogniz

allegations against the personal accep

envoy, asking that, in view thereof,
tne appointment snouid be withdrawn
l he reasons advanced were such as
could not be acquiesced in without vio
lation ot my oath of office and the pre
cepts of the constitution, since they
neoessarily involve a limitation in favor
of a foreign government upon the right
ot selection by the executive and re
quired such an application of a relig
ious test as a qualification for office
under the United Slates as would have
resulted in the practical disfranchise
ment of a large class of our citizens
and the abandonment of a vital
principle iu our government. The
Austro-Hungarian government finally
decided not to receive Mr. Keily as the
envoy of the United States, and that
gentleman has since resigned his com
mission, leaving the post vacant.
I have made no new nomination, and
the interests of this government at
Vienna are now in the care of the
secretary of legation acting as charge
d'affaires ad. interim.
GENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA.
Early in March last war broke out
in Central America caused by the at
tempt ot Guatemala to consolidate the
several states into a single government.
In these contests between our neigh
boring states the United States forbore
to interfere actively, bnt the aid of
friendly offices iu deprecation of war,
to promote peace and concord among
the belligerents, and by such counsel
contributed importantly to the preser
vation ot tranquillity in that locality
Emergencies growing out of civil
war Jn the United States of Colombia
demanded of the government at the
beginning ot this administration the
employment of an armed force to ful
fill its guarantees under the thirtv-fifth
article ol the treaty of 184-j, iu "order
to keep the transit open across the
Jsthmus of Panama. Desirous ol ex
ercising only tha powers expressly re
served to us by the treaty, and mind
ful of the rights of Colombia, the forces
sent to the Isthmus were instructed to
confine their action so "positively and
efficaciously" as to prevent the transit
and its accessories from being inter
rupted or embarrassed."
THE COLOMBIAN INSURRECTION.
Pending these occurrences a question
of much importance was presented by
decrees of the Colombian government
proclaiming the closure of certain
ports then in the hands of insurgents
and declaring vcsiuls held by the re
volutionists tobe piratical and liable
to capture by any power. To neither
ot these propositions could the I'niied
States assent. An effective closure of
ports not iu the possession of the gov
ernment but held by hostile partisans
could not be recognized. Neither
could the vessels of insurgents against
the legitimate- sovereignty be deemed
hostes tiuiH'tui generis within the pre
cepts of international law, whatever
might be the definition and penally of
their acts under the municipal law of
the stale against whose authority tliey
were iu revolt. The denial bv thin
government of the Colombian propo
sition did not, however, Imply the ad
missiou of a belligerent status on the
part of the insurgents.

THE NICARAGUA TREATY.
The interest of the United Slates in a
practicable transit for ships across the
strip of laud separating the Atlantic
from the Pacific has been repeatedly
' manifested during the last half
century. My immediate predecessor

coupled with absolute and unlimited
engagements to defend the territorial
integrity of the state where such
interests lie.
MORE PRACTICABLE PROJECTS
While the seneral project of connect
ing the two oceans by means ot a canal
is to be encouraged, 1 am ot tne opin
ion that any scheme to that end to be
considered with favor should be free
from the feature alluded to. The
Tehuautepec route is declared, by en
gineers ot the highest repute and by
competent scientists, to attord an en
tirely practical transit for vessels and
cargoes, by means of a ship-railway
trom the Atlantic to the Pacific. The
obvious advantages of such a route, if
feasible, over others more remote trom
the axial lines of traffic between
Europe and the Pacific, aud particu
larly between the valley ot the Missis
sippi and the western coast of North
.and South America, are deserving of
consideration.
Whatever highways may be con
structed across the barrier dividing the
two greatest maritime areas of the
world must be for the world's benefit
a trust for maukind to be removed
from the chance of domiuation by auy
single power, nor become a point of
Invitation lor hostilities or a prize for
war-like ambition. An engagement
combining the construction, ownership
and operation of such a work by this
government with an offensive aud de
tensive alliance for its protection with
the foreign state whose responsibilities
and rights we would share, is, in my
judgment, inconsistent with such dedi
cation to universal and neutral use
and would moreover entail measures
for its realization beyond the scope of
our national pontics or present means,
THE WISDOM OF THB PAST.
The lapse of years has abundantlv
oon firmed the wisdom aud foresight of
traiiici aiiuu lustrations wuicn
long before the conditions of maritime
intercourse were changed and enlarg
ed by the progress of the age, proclaim
ed the vital need of intcroceanic transit
across the Amerioau isthmus, and con
secrated it in advance to the common
use of mankind by positive declaration
and through the formal obligation of
treaties 10 ward sucn realization the
efforts of my administration will be
applied, ever bearing in mind the prin
ciples ou which it must rest, and which
were declared in no uncertain wav bv
Mr Cass, who, while secretary of state
in 1808, announced that ''What the
United States want in Ceutral America
next to the happiness ot its people is
the security and neutrality of the
inter-oceanic routes which lead
through It."
The construction of the trans-coutin
ental lines of railway all in successful
operation wholly within our territory
and uniting the Atlantic and the Paeifie
oceans has been accompanied by results
ot a most interesting aud impressive
nature, and has created a new condi
tion not in the routes of commerce on
ly, but in political geography, which
powerfully aflect onr relations toward
and necessarily increase, our interests
in any trans-isthmian route which may
on opened and emptoved ior the ends
of peace and traffic or in other con
tingencies for nses inimical to both.
Transportation is a factor in the cost
ot commodities scarely second to that
of their production and weighs as
heavily upon the consumer. Our ex
perience already has proven the great
importance of having the competition,
between laud carnage and water car
riage tuny developed, especially as a
protection to the public against the ten
dencies of monopoly which is Inherent
iu the consolidation of wealth and
power m the hands of vast corpora
tions. The suggestions may serve to em
phasize what I have already said ou the
score of a neutralization of any inter.
oceanic transit, aud this can only be
accomplished by making the uses of the
route open to ail nations and subject to
the ambitious and warlike necessities of
none.
The drawings and report of a recent
survey ot the Nicaragua canal route
made by Chief Engineer Menoeal will

RELATIONS WITH CHILI AND CHINA.
The claims of citizens ot the United
States for losses by reason of the late
military disturbances of Chill in Peru
and Bolivia are the subject of negotia
tion for a claims convention with Chili
providing tor their submission to arbi
tration.
The harmony of our relations with
China is fully sustained in the applica
tion of t'-e acts lately passed to execute
the treaty of 1880,restrlctive of the im
migration of Chinese laborers into the
United States Individual oases of
hardship have occurred beyond the
power ol the executive to remedy and
calling for judicial determination.

The admitted right of a government

THK CONUO STATE MATTE K
Tha iudependeut ataia of the Congo
has been organized as a government
nnder the soveriguty of his majesty,
the king of the Belgians, who assumes
its chief magistracy in his personal
character only without making the new
state a dependency on Belgium. It is
fortunate that a benighted region
owing all it has of quickening civiliza
tion to the beneficence and philanthrop
ic spirit of this monarch, should have
the advantage and security of bis
benevolent supervision.
This reserve was due to the indispo
sition of their government to share in
any disposal by an international con
gress of jurisdictional questions in re
mote foreign territories. The results
of the conference we embodied in a
form il act of the.nature of an interna
tional convention, which laid down
certain obligations purporting to be
binding on the signatories, subject to
rauncation within one year. Not
withstanding the reservation under
which tha delegates of the United
States attended, their signatures were
attached to the general act in the same
manner as those ot the plenipotentia
ries of other governments, thus mak
ing the United States appear, without
reserve or qualification, as signatories
to a Joint international engagement,
Imposing on the signers the conserva
tion of the territorial integrity of dis
tant regions where we have no estab
lished interests or control.
AN ALLIANCE NOT FAVORED.
This government does not, however,
regard iu reservation of liberty of
action in me premises as at all impair
ed, and holding that an engagement to
share in the obligation of enforcing
neutrality in the remote valley of the
Congo would be an alliance whose
responsibilities we are not in a position
to assume, I abstain from asking the
sanction of the senate to that general
act.
The correspondence will be laid be
fore you and the instructive and inter
esting report of the agent sent by this
government to the Congo country aud

ment of commercial ageucies on the
African coast are also submitted for
your consideration.
Ihe commission appointed bv mv
predecessor to visit the Central and
South American countries and report on
the methods of enlarging the commer
cial relations of the United States has
submitted reports which will be laid
before yon.
ao opportunity has been omitted to
testify the friendliness of this govern
ment toward Corea, whose entrance
into the family of treaty powers the
Unitbd States were the first to recog
nize. I regard, with favor, tha nnnlirnf inn
made by the Corean government to be
allowed to employ American officers as
military instructors to which the assent
of congress becomes necessary, and 1
am happy to say this request has the
concurrent sanction of China arid
Japan.
THB CONOO ASSOCIATION.
The action by the government, last
year, in being the first to recognize the
flag of the International association of
the Congo, has been followed by a
formal recognition of the new national
ity which succeeds to its sovereign
powers.
A conference ot delegates of the prin
cipal commercial nations was held at
Berlin last winter to discuss methods
whereby the Congo basin might be
kept open to the world s trads. Dele
gates attended on behalf of the United
States on the understanding that their
part should be merely deliberative,
without imparting to the result anv
binding character so far as the United
States were concerned.
THE SANTOS CASE ADVERTED TO,
The arrest and imprisonment of
Jules R. Santos, a citizen of the United
states, by the authorities ot Ecuador,
gave rise to a contention with that
government in which his right to be
released, or to have a speedy and im
partial trial, on announced chanres
and with all guarantees ot defense bv
treaty, was insisted upon bv the
United States. After an elaborate
correspondence and repeated and
earnest representations on our part,
nr. santos was, after an alleged trial
and conviction, eventually included in
a general decree of amnestv and par
doned by the Ecuadorian executive aud
eleased, leaving the Question of his
American citizenship denied bv the
Ecuadorian government but insisted
upon by our own.

I regret to say that the restrictions

France, notwithstanding the abundant
demonstration of the ahsence of sanita

this vexatious prohibition will be re

BAILB0AD MEETING.
A meeting was held at the courthouse Tues
day evening, at which Mayor Hamlett wae
chosen chairman, and Sam Kelier, secretarv.
The object of the meeting was to bear from
Capt. Lesueur, who had returned from New
Tork, where be was sent to co before the
board of directors of the St. Joseph and St
Louis road.
He made a report of his trip, first review
ing the rexult of hi visit to Chicago, and that
a a re.-ult of the conference with the gentle
man be met there it was learned that the C,
. Q. folks regarded the building of a
bridge one of the greatest obstacles to the
road being extended southwest. It had been
alleged that the C, B. Q. laughed at the
Idea ot wanting help. They are a big corpor
ation, able to build a bridge if they choos.

if a few prominent citizens of St. Joseph

that as a guarantee.
