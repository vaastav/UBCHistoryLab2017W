The Legislature,
tn the Senate on Ei iilay the Sen
ate till to repeal the conventional
Interest law wa rejected. A similar
bill waa defeated in tUa House.
Tho Senate on Saturday disposed
of a lot of routine business oflittlc
Interest.
Ia the Iloust, the Comrottee on
Federal IUlationf, to whom waa. re
ferred the special message of the
Governor in relatiou to the cotton
tar, submitted a report unanimous
ly concurring in the views of the
Governor, accornponied by a reso
lution instructing bur Congression
al delegation to introduce and sup
port auch measures daring the next
cession as will cause to be refunded,
without delaj-, the tax on cotton
collected in the year 1855-6-7;
and memorializing Congress to paas
the law desired. The resolution
was adopted under a suspension of
the rules. Mr Spears, from the
Committee on Finance, Ways and
Means, submitted a report on the
bill to repeal the merchants tax,
without any recommendation one
w.13- or the other. A resolution was
adopted authox-iiingthe comptroller
to take the necessary steps to meet
a loan of $150,000 falling due the
present month, either by borrowing
money or hypothecating bonds.
House bill to regulate the business
it life insurance was rejected.
In tho House on Tuesday, the
Banner says: . 31r. Freeman, with a
smile that was child-like and bland,
asked the House to adopt a resolu
tion ot his, indorsing President
Grant's recent message, and aetu
alii' favoring his re-election! The
resolution, about - aa cool as the
weather, was squelched by a vote
of 54 to 14. So the ctjort to con
rert the Tennessee Legislature into
a Republican body, by joint reso
lution, having failed, what next?
resident's Message.
We intended to give our readers
the President's Message to-day in
supplemental form, but it is really
too thin. It is not worth tho space
it weald occupy. Tho only feature
in it worthy of mention ia the fact
that he opposes polygamy, recom
mends the modification of taxes
and the removal of political disa
bilities. He is sound on these
points, but weak on everything else.
Nashville has two of the best
daily papers in the. South, or in the
North either, if we except a few
metropolitan dailies, and we hope
the people of Tennessee and of the
South will sustain them liberally,
rnd not fly off at the handle becau k
they have advanced their rates to
$10 per anuuni. They are worth
every cent of it, and could not sur
vive on lt!ss at their present rate of
expenditures"
The Mac and Coburn Fight-
The fight which took place near
New Orleans last Fiidaj' between
Joe Coburn and Jem Mace, the one
a New York bully and the other an
imported .bruiser, affords a fair
sample of the degeneracy of the
prize ring if, indeed, a business
that was always as low and vile and
disgraceful as it well could be, can
properly be said to have degenera
ted. After beating and bruising
each other ia eleven rounds before
a heartless throng, the fight wa3 de
clared a draw, doubtless to be re
peated at sonic future da'.

Editor Citizen; No doubt every
one was surprised this morning on
arising to find the ground covered
with snow, for the clouds did not
look like snowon retiring last night.
The snow has already fallen to the
depth of tea inches and continues
to snow.
I saw three or four wagons pass
through town this morning loaded
with plunder bound for the far
West ; rather late in the season to be
moving and no doubt they wil
suffer with cold before tnev arrive
at the end of their journey.

' Aa'oJd French proverb -iys, . A
good book is a good friend." ThU
13 i.3 true not only of books but of
periodicals. There is no class of
individuals in tho country raore or
feomfceh in need of friends of this
kind as our "school teachers. "Only
here and there is there found a
teacher who at all attempts to keep
Dace with the science and ert of
teaching, for both it is. There are
books' and papers' of "aa excellent
nature being published which con
tain a vast deal of useful informa
tion and hints to every teacher.
For example, every one " should
read Hart's "In the School Room,"
and should be a regular reader cf
some one of the educational publi
cations now to be had at reasonable
rates. There is too little progress
and too much old fogyism in teach
ing .nowaday. Ia this, an every-
thing else, the word progress is do
ing its work,, and our teachers
should keep up.. In medicine the
practitioner on "the good old p!an"
is now left all alone ia - the dark,
and so in teaching; the old way is
of necessity losing ground. The
writer does not advocate tLe entiic
dismission of the medicine for boys
that grows upon beech trees, for
mman nature is the same in all
ages, and more especially so with
boj-s, but there are innny other
changes for the better. Take for
instance the question of object
teaching.' How many teachers
have really a correct idea of what
is meant by the expression? In
arithmetic, grammar and geogra-
PI13- objects drawn upon the board
will serve "to illustrate what is
aimed to be taught in a way utterly
impossible of being attained by any
other means. Any one knows that
to undertake to give a boy a verbal
description of a ship, the idea im
pressed will be a vague one. but the
picture will enlighten tha little fel
low's ndnd completely. So with
most subjects taught in our schools:
The assertion', in spite of the use
and common sense of such teach
ing, is made that not one in ten of
our ' teachers use these means.
This is the natural result of the
idea that prevails that teaching is
a stand-still science. In this de
partment then is just as rapid and
pravtical'advance as in any other.
There is as much difference in the
books used by the children of the
present generation and those used
by their proud fathers as there is
between the stage and the locomo
tive, 3-et few teachers seem to ap
preciate this fact." The Teacher's
Association of our county aims to
remedy this evil; hence the ground
for asserting th&t evety teacher
should become a member of it.
X.AWREX'JEnURG, Dec. nd 1871,
Editok Citizen,
I am dliected by the Third of
these resolutions to present to 3ou
for publication the proceedings of
the Lawrenceburg Bar, in reference
to your worthy citizen, the lion.
Hilary Ward. '
Upon the assembling of the law
yers of the Lawrenceburg Bar In
the court room, foreign law3ers in
atendance having left for their
homes, Chancellor Nixon moved
that Judge R II Rose take the
chair, and that T D Davenport be
appointed Secreta-, Chancellor
Nixon then offered tho folk wing
preamble and resolutions.
Whereas, the Hon. Hilary Ward
has j ust closed a long and laborious
court at this place, as special Chan
cellor, and tho members of the Law
renceburg bar aro unwilling that
the exercise of his legal talent and
learning in an affable ami courte
ous 3'ct dignified manner," shall
pass unrequited aud acknowledged
Therefore be it
Rksolveo, That this bar. rec
ognizes in the Hon. IIilar3' Ward,
an able jurist, just, patient, impar
tial and discriminating critic of the
various questions of law pre
sented for his consideration, polite
and courteous to the bar while on
the bench, pleasant in his social re
lations. Resolved, That this bar tender to

T. D. Davenport, Sec.
R, II. Rose, Chairman.
Jin. JIcCord; I scc in j our last
issue a wrong statement of me rela
tive to my getting in Josh Caruth
er's gi occr3'. I went in there to get
a ten dollar bill changed and his
clerk told me a man wished to see
me in the back ioin. I went to
the ttoor and it was dark and I did
not want to go in, but he pushed
in in and locked the door on me.
I began to hollow and Carutheis
came to me and knocked roe down
with a bottle, and I broke down
the door aad got out.

stood with two friends in the dis
mal gray-etone building over whose
portals ia written in large white let
ters .the , significant and startling
words The Morgue." ' Witha cold
'fchuddtr I entered this gloomy plate,
this '-Coffin of European and Amer
ican dead," w ho ia the ficrco strug
gle for existence ere slain and for
gotten by the 'rushing: crowd!' '
J'Wby thU secret 3reJ, tt' SttWard or-
rorf Wh tarink tha etil
Back oft fcereJf, nd ttarUea at dettmctiati"!
Outwardly1 it 1 a square stone
building, fet back one hundred or
tnore feet from the river, on twenty
fourth street, and without anj- pre
tentions '.- to . architectural taste,
while its interior is equally plain
and simple, consisting of two large
oblong. rooms separated by a glass
partition. Passing through the
arched door-waj' we entered one of
these apartments, the so-called re
ception room. ,
This room is finished off in dark
tcssalated marble, and is some thir
ty five or forty feet long. On the
wall hangs a set of "Rules and Reg
ulations of the morgue." Behind
the glass screen is anothej room of
about the same siae and appear - ,
ance, with the addition
tion of four mar-,
ble slabs, each abont eight feet long
and about t'wentjr-five inches in
width, which 'rest on iron stanch
ions, and slightly inc'ined towards
the glass partition, which, they face,
in order that the bodies mii' rest
with an elevation of the head and
shoulders. - Above these slabes is
a .long iron rod, upon which the
clothes of the dead arc seen. An
iron water-pi pe.runs along the ceil
ing, and branches off above each
slab into an india rubber tube ter
minating into a sprinkler, ' that
reaches down near the slab, and from
which a steady stream of water i3
made to flow over the corps to save
it from putrefaction while on ex
hibition. " .. " ";
At the hour of our visit onlv two
of the slabs were occupied. One a
woman, m ine prime oi me, iouuu
dead bA- the wayside. Her features
had anguish and despair impressed,
as with an Iron hand, and we were
filled with horror at the suffering
the rigid features bore. To -her,
death must have brought relief.
The other, a voting 'girl with s'nch
an appealing look for pitty, for
sj'iripaLby,' for love in her cold white
face, that a moan escaped u and
tears sprang to our eye.?.
Her long dark hair, wet with the
dripping water, hung in ringlets
over the marble slab and one del
icate hand rested outside the black
oil-cloth which covered the bod'.
The few words found upon her per
son when lifted from the dark river
in which she had pln.ngedtired f
the pitiless pain that had wrecked
her hopes was the only due to the
fatal act; ' . '
"Myra, forgive me. I am firmly
convinced a nearer or dearer tie can
never unite us forgtt me. .
Farewell! : . Damon."
What a them.e for romance these
sad realities suggest for a gifted
pen J
"Love, by har.h evidence,
Thrown from ita eminence;
Even GihI's providence
Seerainjjf ctranged
The dead brought to the New
York Morgue are divided into two
classes identified and unknown.
Those whose name, residence, can
le ascertained from papers .Upon
their person, are never exposed on
the slab3, but at once placed in cof
fins and their relatives or friends
informed of the fact- Should the3
not appb' for the bod v, after a suf
ficient notice, the remains are hur
ried in the "Potters field." The
unknown corps is . at once placed
upon the marble slab for recogni
tion, and there remains several da3 s.
While those who have "missing"
dear ones, come, stricken with sor
row, to recognize perhaps in the
riprid form on the marble slab their
loved and lost.
If the dead body ia not recogni
zed it is removed to a plaoe behind
the building, and dressed in the ap
parrel in which it was found, and
placed in' a coffin which is held in
an upright position before a camera,
and an accurate picture taken.
Then the coffin is nailed up, put
upon a small steamer, and convej"
etl to a paupers grave The horri
ble and ghostly potographs are kept
on exhibition for some months to
facilitate search and identification
possibly in the future.
And these pictures! horrible to
look at, yet more horrible to dream
of, with their dt ing agony so visi
ble in their distorted faces! Here
is one with a dark mark around the
neck, with e3'es protruding from
their sockets. Another with half
the throat cut another with a hole
in the ternple Ah! more than we
write about, and all with deeply
lined marks of grief, anguish, dis
appointment, and despair, upon
their coffined faces
