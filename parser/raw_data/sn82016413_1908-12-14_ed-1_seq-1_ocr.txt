These are all reappointments of present incumbents. a
The news that all three Circuit Judges on the other Islands hanrft
been reappointed, by lrtuo of the Otucinor's nomliinllons, will bo con-
sldorable of a surprise to many who had followed thn ludgeshlps closn--
ly. It was generally thought that Judge Hardy would drop out nt thn
expiration of this term, and there were n largo number of candidates for
the position. Thcro Is n general belief that llaidj while accepting thn
honor of reappointment may soon retire nnd .ludgo Kingsbury named for
