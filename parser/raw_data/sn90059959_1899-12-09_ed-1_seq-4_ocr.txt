Vice President Ilobart's will makes
two bequests of $5,000 each to two
Catholic charities—St. Joseph's Or
phan Asylum and St. Joseph's Hospital,
in Paterson, N. J.
Archbishop Chapellc, papal delegate,
and Father McKinnon, chaplain of the
First California volunteers, left San
Francisco last Tuesday for the Philip
pines. Tlicy have gone to attend to the
Filipinos in a spiritual and political
capacity.
An Irish magistrate, Kendal O'Brien,
has been removed from his position for
congratulating the Boers upon their vic
tory at Glencoe. Another Irish magis
trate, Lord Emly, has been dismissed
on the charge of inciting laborers to
create a disturbance and for threatening
another Ladvsmith in Ireland.
Lord Mayor Tallon, of Dublin, and
John E. Redmond, of Watcrford, left
for Ireland on the Campania on Satur
day, Nov. 25. They did not come west
on their mission of collecting funds for
the Parnell monument, but remained
during their stay in the East. They re
turned home well satisfied with the
amount subscribed for the redemption
of the Avondale esatc and the erection
of the memorial to the late Irish leader.
William T. Stead, in a special cable
to the New York World, reiterates the
charge that Chamberlain perjured him
self before a committee of the House of
Commons in reference to the Jameson
raid. He says that after endeavoring to
convert an honest alliance with the
Americans in Johannesburg into a dis
honest conspiracy to steal the Trans
vaal for England, any American who
now ventures to sup with Chamberlain,
for the promotion of an Anglo-Ameri
can alliance, will need a long spoon.
The London Times is jubilant over
the appointment of Adelbert S. Hay,
son of Secretary Hay, the Anglomaniac,
as the American consul at Pretoria, in
place of Charles E. Macrum, resigned.
It says that his appointment is "a sig
nificant proof of the genuine interest 111
the welfare of the British prisoners felt
by President McKinley's government."
The British "Thunderer" may be right,
but John Hay's son must not act too
officiously or he may get snubbed by
Paul Kruger, and then what can "Mc
Kinley's government" do about it?
Cardinal Gibbons writes to the Lon
don Tablet in reply to Historian Lecky's
attack upon his eminence for his eulo
gistic preface to the life of John Boyle
O'Reilly by James Jeffrey Roche, the
editor of the Boston Pilot. The cardi
nal says he did not know until he read
Lecky's criticism that Boyle O'Reilly
had ever been a Fenian or a British sol
dier, or had tried to seduce other sol-
diers from their allegiance. He has
never read the biography of O'Reilly
for which he wrote the introduction, and
he hopes that the author of it will not
regard him as discourteous for making
the avowal.
THE PHILIPPINE PROBLEM.
In his message to congress President
McKinley dwells at length on the qucs
tion of the Philippine Islands, but says
nothing new or interesting unless it is
the following: ''I have every reason to
believe, and I still believe, that this
transfer of soverignty from Spain to
the United States was in accordance
with the wishes and the aspirations oi
the great mass of the Filipino people."
The fact is that the Filipino people and
their representatives were not consulted
on the matter at all by the McKinley
pcace commissioners, and the fact that
they have disputed the authority of the
United States on the battlefields of the
islands is proof positive that the trans
fer of sovereignty was not in accord
ance with their wishes or aspirations.
If that were the case there would have
been no need of sending 70,000 troops
to suppress the war for independence.
When Mr. McKinley makes such a
statement to the congress of the United
States he must think the representatives
oi the people therein assembled arc a
pack of fools or knaves. He has failed
to give any satisfactory reasons for hold
ing the Philippine Islands and govern
ing them against the consent of the in
habitants who dispute his claim that
"they are ours by every title of law and
equity." He does not recommend any
form of government for the islands, but
says that when peace is restored "it will
be the duty of congress to construct a
plan of government which shall establish
and maintain freedom and order and
peace in the Philippines." Of course,
lie expects congress to frame a colonial
government tor them on the British
plan. But the people will have some
thing to say, and that very emphatically,
in due time. One of the people, Hon.
S. M. Owen, of this city, does not favor
the retention of the Philippines, and has
the following to say on the imperialistic
scheme of the administration:
I object to the acquisition of remote
and populous territory upon what I
deem the broadest and most patriotic
grounds. This nation is expanding in a
proper and perfectly legitimate manner,
with a rapidity vastly beyond that of
any other nation on earth. It is now
estimated that our population is above
76,500,000, an increase of 14,000,000 in
nine years. Compared with this all
other nations are at a standstill. This
condition should admonish us that we
should have a public policy unlike that
of other nations, and not be trailers
after them. This country is the most
sparsely settled of all civilized lands, yet
110 other one even immediately ap
proaches it in ability to support popu
lation, if its resources are properly uti
lized and its affairs wisely ordered. If
all the people in the world were settled
in the United States of North America,
exclusive of Alaska, they would contain
less population to the square mile than
Belgium contains yet Belgium without
colonies, without a navy, is a prosperous
country, and its affairs are so ordered
in the interest of the common people
lhat, in spite of the amazing density of
its population its immigration is larger
than its emigration, more people mov
ing into it for permanent settlement
than arc moving out. This at least sug
gests what a magnificent opportunity we
have for an expansion along natural
lines that will prove profitable to our
selves and helpful to the world. If the
United States contained half the present
population of the world they would be
much less densely settled than the chief
countries of Europe or many other
lands. Yet none of them are so capable
of supporting a dense population as this
one. If we really do need more territory
then it must be confessed that our do
mestic affairs arc most vilely adminis
tered, and we would better correct them
before we begin to administer the affairs
of other lands and peoples in remote
portions of the globe.
And this brings me to the patriotism,
if you please, of my position. The
United States of America is now in the
midst of an experiment—for it is yet in
the experimental stage—in human gov
ernment heretofore unknown or unat
tempted. We now number 76,500,000,
are rapidly approaching the 100,000,000
mark, and no likelihood of stopping
short unless we are criminally inefficient
in conducting the government and all
of this vast horde of people living un
der a popular or free government,
where the man is theoretically the ruler.
To maintain such a government under
such circumstances an undertaking in
statecraft that finds no parallel in history,
and to make the undertaking successful
ought to satisfy the most vaulting am
bition of any political party or adminis
tration, and will, in my humble opinion,
come nearer executing the will of God
than soldiers, battleships and conquest
ever will.
A mighty nation of free and intelli
gent people, among whom there are
equal rights for all where special priv
ileges arc unknown where justice is in
deed blind to wealth of poverty where
taxation is as near just as human judg
ment can make it where free speech is
not a glittering generality, but a living,
blessed realization where huge com
binations of wealth arc not allowed to
hasten wealth centralization in a few
hands, a condition that has always been
a fatal national disease and always will
be where monopoly shall not exercise
despotic powers that no potentate dare
attempt where all citizens shall be par
ticipants in the country's God-given re
sources where opportunities for em
ployment and an ultimate competency
are commensurable with the resources
of the country such a nation will be an
example to the world that will send its
instructions and its blessings into lands
near and remote, will send them on the
wings of peace without the expenditure
of a. dollar. We are not realizing the
theory of our government, and while
that is true it is the reverse of patriotism
to conccrn ourselves about other lands
or the government of other people.
THE BATTLE OF MODDER RIVER.
The greatest battle in South Africa
thus far in the campaign was that of
Modder River on Thursday, Dec. 2, be
tween Lieutenant-General Lord Mcth
tien of the British army and General
Cronje oi the Boer forces. It was first
proclaimed as a glorious victory for the
British, but subsequent news shows that
it was a victory only in the sense that
the Boer army retreated six miles fur
ther north toward Kimbcrley and left
the British behind in a demoralized con
dition to follow up as best they could
aiter attending to their dead and wound
ed, which numbered 445 in all, accord
ing to Methucn's report to the war
was an artillery duel. There was no
bayonet charge by the British as in pre
vious battles. Julian Ralph says in his
description of it for the London Daily
Mail that the British never saw the
enemy, yet they were not able to raise
hand or foot without being riddled."
Lord Methuen himself was wounded in
the thigh, and he says in his laconic
report of the conflict that it was the
bloodiest of the century. Of course he
is greatly mistaken. The battle was a
desperate one, but the contending forces
were not more than 20,000. The loss to
the British at Majuba Hill was relatively
larger than at Modder River, unless the
loss was greater than is reported by
Methuen. He did not lose 5 per cent of
his men, taking his forces at 10,000. At
the battle of Waterloo neither side lost
less than 20 per cent of the men en
gaged. In the battles of the Civil War
in this country the loss on either side
often averaged 20 per cent, and at the
battle of Chickamauga 22,000 were killed
and wounded, a total more than the com
bined forces engaged at Modder River.
So that when Lord Methuen called the
little fight on the river in Cape Colony
the bloodiest battle of the century he
was guilty of using hyperbole, and must
have been thinking of "rivers of blood
and hills of slain" when sending his tele
gram.
From all we have read of Modder
River, General Methuen displayed poor
military skill, and the London Times
says almost as much. The Boer army
was in the form of a semicircle on both
sides of the river and when the British
attacked the center they were riddled
on three sides and obliged to lie down
during the artillery contest, which was
terrific. We will let the correspondents
of the Associated Press with Lord
Methuen tell the story as follows:
"For five hours the British batteries
poured tons of shrapnel and shells into
the Boer positions. Lord Methuen had
22 guns, and each fired an average of
200 rounds. The Boers had an almost
equal number of guns, which, it is re
ported, were mostly served by German
and French artillerists.
"It is believed that the Boers had oc
cupied the position several weeks before
and had spent the interval in fortifying
and rendering it, as they considered, im
pregnable. They did not seem to fear to
pend their ammunition, and their guns
were well and smartly handled. Owing
the bend in the river on the right,
the Boers had an opportunity of cross
firing on the British attack. A Boer
Ilotchkiss was directed with marvellous
accuracy against a British Maxim, kill
ing the sergeant in charge, wounding
an officer and disabling the gun. This
occurred quite at the beginning of the
engagement. Whenever the Boer fire
was silcnced in one direction it was im
mdiately reopened in another.
"Owing to the terrific fire, nobody on
the plain was out of range. Stretcher
bearers found it impossible to go for
ward in the few eases they were called
upon to attend, and the wounded were
compelled, if possible, to crawl out of
the lines.
"No quarter seems to have been given
011 either side. The British assert that,
amid the bullets, the ambulance wagons
displayed their flags promiscuously to
110 advantage. These were repeatedly
driven back and compelled to take
refuge out of sight.
"It is alleged that the Boers used
dum-dums and made special targets of
the horses on the plain in the hope of
hitting the riders. While the Argyll
Highlanders were pushing across the
river they were fired upon from a house,
and several men fell. Thereupon the
Highlanders stormed the house, and,
although the Boers hoisted a white flag,
no attention was paid to it, and all the
Boers were shot."
A week has elapsed since the battle
and Methuen has not cared to meet the
Boers again up to the time of writing.
He has been evidently waiting for re
inforcements. The Boers in the next
conflict will render a good account of
themselves, and it is safe to assert that
the British will find it quite difficult to
proceed to the relief of Kimberley.
Victoria's Hypocrisy.
Queen Victoria was at Bristol, Eng
land, on Wednesday, to open the Con
valescent Home of Clifton, and the
cable dispatches say the visit was made
the occasion for a great display of
patriotism. Princess Christian of
Schleswig-Holstcin, Princess Henry of
Battcnburg and the Duchess of Con
naught were along, and there was a
royal salute, a procession, an address by
the mayor and a speech by the queen
herself. It was in these words: "The
sense of union and brotherhood which,
under the divine blessing, has welded to
gether my empire in time of peace is
now proving itself in the hour of our
trial also, and I share the pride you
must feel that the men drawn from -this
district have recently been conspicuous
among my gallant soldiers and sailors
ir^ab^H TW»_
THE IRISH STANDARD, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1899.
in South Africa for their gallant valor
and devotion to duty."
What a rank piece of hypocrisy this,
is! Let us hope that for the sake of the
high opinion the world has been taught
to entertain of the queen as a womanly
woman that she is not the real author of
this spccch, and perhaps knows little, if
anything, about it that it was written by
some clerk of the royal establishment
and perfunctorily put in her mouth.
Victoria is nominally queen of England
and empress of India. "My empire,"
as she calls it—including not only India
but many other remote countries—is
constructed on a foundation of blood,
suffering and oppression. It is builded
011 slavery and the impairment of that
right of self-government implied by the
institutions of the United States. It has
cost the lives of thousands upon thou
sands of brave British soldiers, and has
kept the common people of England
ground down to pay for the luxury of
"my empire." And now more of "my
soldiers" are going to South Africa to
demolish the structure of freedom which
the Boers have so patiently and so pa
triotically built up. To those who die,
and to their friends, what satisfaction or
recompense is there in occasional spurts
of cast-iron phraseology about how
sorry the queen or Lord Salisbury, or
somebody else, who is taking no
chances, is for their loss? What recom
pense is there in the assurance of this
gracious old lady that they covered
themselves with glory by dying in the
cause of their country? If it is such a
glorious thing, why doesn't the queen
send out a lot of her numerous progeny
of sons and grandsons to do some of the
fighting? She could spare a few royal
idlers who have been taken into camp
as sons-in-law. And what about the
Boers? Is it not a pitiful thing to shoot
them down? Do their losses in battle
ever appeal to the royal soul of Eng
land?
It must be admitted, though, that the
flood of crocodile tears which flows
from the royal establishment of England
is not more reprehensible than the
mourning of our own dear, sweet presi
dent, who has also ambitions in empire,
when he reads Otis's diurnal death list
in a war without a cause or a patriotic
motive behind it. Uufortunately there
is an awful similarity in the British at
tack on the Boers and the American at
tack on the Filipinos.
There is a difference, too. The Brit
ish policy is perpetual. The administra
tion's policy can only run till the time
when congress docs its duty or the peo
ple themselves exercise the original
power to which our system owes its
being.—Cincinnati Enquirer.
THE ORANGE FREE STATE.
People and Resources of the Trans
vaal's Ally.
The Orange Free State forms one of
the two independent republics in South
Africa. The Transvaal is the other. The
former is bounded on the south by the
Orange river, which divides it from
Cape Colony, a British South African
colony. On the north it is sepa
rated from its sister republic, the Trans
vaal, by the Vaal river. Basutoland and
the range of the Drakensberg (Dragon
Mountains) divide it from Natal on the
cast. On the west it is bounded by
Griqualand West, which is better known
as the Diamond Fields, a recently pur
chased possession. This little republic
has an area of about 50,000 square miles.
It is an elevated table land 4,000 feet
above the sea level, and is 400 miles long
by 200* miles wide, running north and
south. The present population of.the
country is estimated by its government
at about 93.000 whites and 140,000 na
tives of the Basuto and Barolong tribes.
Bloemfontcin, which is 750 miles north
of Table Bay, 40 miles north of Port
Elizabeth, and 400 north of East Lon
don, is the capital. The only mountain
ranges in the Orange Free State are the
Stall Mountains, in the eastern portion
of the republic. From the Drakensberg
the country slopes gradually to the Vaal
river on the northern and western boun
daries. The southern part of the Free
State is dotted with detached kopjes or
individual hills. Otherwise the interior
is an undulating prairie or prairies, for
merly covered with coarse grass. This
is changed in the south to a scrubby
brush or copse, which is excellent graz
ing for sheep, a sweeter grass supplant
ing the sour or coarser grasses in places.
The Orange Free State is not a forest
country. It is virtually treeless. The
species of forest now found on-the hill
sides and in the moist valleys of the
rivers is a scant scrub of mimosa thorn,
the wild olive, the willow, and the camel
thorn, which is a species of wild acacia.
The principal lands are best adapted
to pastoral purposes, though there is a
30 to 100 mile strip of soil on the Basuto
land border considered to be second to
none in the world for grain producing
purposes. The pursuits of the people
being principally stock-raising and grain
growing, the burghers have leisure for
war. The strip noted above produces,
without irrigation or fertilizing, and
after planting for nearly 40 consecutive
years, from 30 to 80 bushels per acre.
This fertile strip of land is known as the
Conquered Territory. It was taken front
the Basutos about 1864. This little
belt of land is the granary of the Orange
Free State and of the Transvaal. In this
belt of country, 30 miles wide by 100
miles long, arc grown wheat, oats, bar
ley, maize and Kaffir corn. It also car
ries large herds of cattle, horses, sheep,
angora goats, and ostriches. Pears, ap
ples, peaches and grapes are likewise
grown to a large extent. This is the
Boer base of supplies, and the moun
tains which face British South Africa
are depended upon with Boer endurance
and Boer strategy to hold these fields
inviolate to the homes of the twin re
publics of tjje same blood.
The inhabitants of the Orange Free
State are, like the Boers of the Trans­
vaal, a peaceful, educated and well-gov
erned people. The country is divided
into nineteen districts, each one of which
is presided over by a landdrost, or ma
gistrate. Each of these magisterial dis
tricts is again subdivided into one, two
or more wards, according to its size or
importance. Each of these wards sends"
a member to the volksraad or legislature.
In addition to this each town also sends
a member to the volksraad. To this
legislature the people delegate the gov
ernment of the country. The president,
who is the responsible head of the exec
utive department, is advised by an exec
utive council and by the high court,
which is composed of a chief justice and
two puisne judges.
The government obtains about i400,
000 annually from the revenues of the
state to meet its expenditure. This rev
enue is mainly derived from the fol
lowing sources: Quit-rent on farms, at
the rate of 48 cents for each 100 morgen,
or 200 acres transfer dues on unmova
ble or fixed property, at the rate of 4
per cent a 2 per cent rate on movables,
that is, all goods sold by auction a hut
or capitation tax of $2.50 a head on
natives. From the custom house there
is received about £120,000 a year. This
is obtained from a 12 per cent ad valo
rem levy on all over-sea goods crossing
the border. These dues are, by virtue
of a treaty with the Cape Colony gov
ernment levied at the ports of Cape
Colony. They are also levied on the
Natal border by Orange Free State offi
cers in accordance with the provisions
of the customs union existing between
the Cape government and the Free
State. The former retains 3 per cent of
the 12 per cent levied to recoup itself for
the expense of collecting these customs
dues for the republic.
The Orange Free State expends about
$150,000 annually on roads, $300,000 on
bridges, and large sums, for so small a
country, on public buildings. In fact,
nearly one-third of the entire revenue of
the state is absorbed by educational
grants and public works. This would
be a very fine showing for countries
outside of Africa.
The government of this Boer state is
very careful about the education of the
children of the land. For this purpose a
permanent fund of £200,000 is set aside.
The educational department is a very
thorough one. This department is un-'
der a superintendent who has under him
a corps of inspectors and sub-inspectors.
There are now about 80 fine government
schools with a staff of 150 teachers.
These schools are exclusive of private
and non-aided schools, such as those
which are maintained by the Catholics,
the Anglicans, and other religious de
nominations. The government schools
are of three kinds, viz—town, ward, and
peripatetic schools. To teach them the
instructors are divided into first, second
and third class, according to the grade
of their certificates from the board of
state examiners. This board is com
posed of nine members who are appoint
ed by the president of the republic.
Though only 25,000 square miles in
area, the size of an American state, this
republic Jias had a stirring history since
the first white men peopled it in 1835,
sixty-five years ago. These settlers
were refugees from Cape Colony, hunt
ing for a quiet, peaceful home north of
the Orange river. Some of these emi
grants founded the South African Re
public, or Tranvaal. These pioneer
farmers found only bands of savage
Bushmen and Korannas in the new
country. They organized a sort of
community band or maatschappi. In
1847, the British governor of Cape Col
ony proclaimed all territory between the
Vaal and the Orange rivers as British
country. A resident agent was then
placed at Bloemfontein. This state of
sovereignty continued until 1854. In
that year the continued troubles with
the Basutos and Griquas caused the
English government to relinquish the
country north of the Orange river. By
the convention of Bloemfontein, signed
Feb. 23, 1854, the country north of the
Orange river, known as the Orange
River Territory, was recognized as an
independent state. This convention freed
the farmers from allegiance to the Brit
ish crown the English government was
to have no alliances with any of the
tribal chiefs north of the Orange river,
with the exception of Adam Kok, the
chief of the Griqua tribe. The new
government guaranteed the rights of the
persons and property of British subjects
resident in that territory at that time.
Extradition was also provided for
courts of law were to be established,
and slavery was not to be allowed. The
Orange River Territory was to have the
right to purchase arms and munitions
in British South Africa.
The volksraad adopted the Orange
Free State constitution on April 10.
1854. It was based upon the constitu
tion of the United States. This consti
tution gave anyone living in the terri
tory six months before April 10 the
right to vote for president and for mem
bers of the legislature. The president is
elected every five years by all the en
franchised burghers. The president's
advisory council consists of the land
drost (magistrate) of the Bloemfontein
district, the government secretary or
premier, and three unofficial members
who are elected to that service by the
volksraad. The Roman Dutch law was
made the common law of the land. The
courts follow this in the absence of spe
cific statutory provisions. Liberty ot
the press and freedom of speech are
guaranteed by the fundamental law.
The constitution cannot be amended or
repealed except by a three-fourths vote
at each of the two annual sessions of
the legislature. The constitution of the
country was revised and re-enacted on
March 9, 1866, and again on May 8,
1879. The changes were minor. From
1854 until now the Orange Free State
has been a republic. It has had eight
presidents in that time..
The people of the Free State, like
those of the Transvaal, are very simple
S5K5TE
5?j3f ,•
:jm$
and sincere in their dealings. In the
country districts this simplicity is of
so innocent a character that a stranger,
even, who is trusted and accepted as
worthy to be a guest, may even be al
lowed to sleep in the same room with
the single daughters of the family. For
any violation of the sanctity or hospi
tality of the Boer home the culprit will
barely escape with his life. While under
welcome the visitor is treated like a son
or daughter. The Boers are not an im
moral people. They arc a plain, simple,
severe, but kind and hardy race. An
infusion of Huguenot blood in the
burghers of the Free State makes them
an active and enterprising community
of sturdy yeomen.
THE CLOVEN FOOT
No Longer Concealed Under Republican
Financiering.
Reform Press Bureau,
No further coinage of any silver ex
cept the fractional coins, and recoining
of worn and mutilated coins.
The above are the provisions of the
bill bearing on political issues, and if
they do not make the money question
at once a live one again, then it will be
surprising. In fact from the money
question being somewhat relegated to
the rear of other issues, this open decla
ration for all that, nay more, than the
money power has ever dared to ask,
will bring the financial issues into the
campaign with more vehemence than
ever. All who stood pat on it before
will be re-inforced by that large num
ber of Republicans who have refused to
believe that their party would ever be
come the single gold standard party.
They were buncoed by international
agreement in 1896, and will refuse to be
gold-bricked in 1900.
It chanced opportunely that the Sil
ver Republican executive committee was
in session at Chicago when the currency
bill was promulgated. They accepted
the new gauge of battle, and will organ
ize for a fight of co-operation with the
Democratic and Peoples parties, and
this time not alone .on the financial
question, but will be as open and cour
ageous on other issues as they were vig
orous and effective on free coinage in
'96. All preliminary arrangements were
made for a great convention, and a spe
cially important act was the appointment
of Hon. E. S. Corser to head a special
committee charged with the co-opera
tive work of the organization. Mr.
Corser is thus called to what will prac
tically be the working head of the na
tional free coinage forces. Minnesota
well knows that this means results.
There are increasing indications that
early conventions of the reform forces
and allies may be held, possibly in April,
at least ahead of the Republicans.
The Chicago meeting showed abso
lute harmony and absolutely unbroken
ranks in all parts of the country. Not
a name is spoken of for president but
Bryan, and there was found so pro
nounced a sentiment for Mr. Towne for
Bryan's running mate as to render it
impossible for Mr. Towne's closest
friends to longer ignore it. These have
opposed the suggestion because of their
expectations of a greater future and
knowledge that as a rule vice presidents
and vice presidential candidates have
not often been prominent thereafter.
There is no retired list for C. A. Towne.
Dairy Commissioner Bowler's depu
ties swooped down on Duluth oleo dis
pensers last week and numerous offen
ders were plucked and, being convicted,
contributed fines to the state fund. The
state inspectors found Duluth a good
field, the laws as to oleomargarine be
ing flagrantly violated. Numerous gro
cerymen, hotel-keepers and restaurant
ers are found selling renovated butter,
butterine and oleo, without the proper
labels. Each violation is assessed at
$27.50. A total of several hundred dol
lars in fines was collected, and the Du
luth reports credit the department,
which is no rcspecter of persons, with
some very clever work.
Specimen outrageous Republican
falsehoods on the grain department have
been the Republican statements of the
action of Inspector Reishus in attempt
ing to retrench by dropping three offi
cials in the St. Paul department. The
Red Wing Republican put this lie more
wickedly than most of its contempora
ries, actually declaring that "the Demo
cratic majority" of the commissioners
refused to confirm the inspector's rec
ommendation for removal, "in order to
stop discharges made for partisan pur
poses, declaring the men were able and
trained, and that the commission "could

St. Paul, Dec. 4, 1899.
The financial cloven foot of the Mc
Kinley administration is out from under
the folds of false pretense which have
concealed the wretched member since
the St. Louis convention. From this on,
just exactly what the administration,
and that portion of his party which will
support the money power to the last,
intend, will be clear to the American
people. Of course this has been dis
counted very largely by the guessing at
what the proposed currency bill con
tains, but the bill as now ready to go to
congress with the full sanction of Mc
Kinley and the Republican majority, is
a clean cut and unequivocal surrender
to the money power. The salient fea
tures are:
The gold standard, the present gold
dollar as the unit of value, and all forms
of money redeemable in gold.
The power to issue interest bearing
bonds at will to obtain gold, and all ex
isting bonds payable in gold.
Retirement of the non-interest bear
ing greenbacks from circulation by re
demption of gold whenever presented.
Extension of the powers and special
privileges of national banks, authorizing
increase of circulation to par value of
bonds and providing for branch banks
with as low as $25,000 circulation.
Reducing the tax on national bank
circulation to one-tenth of 1 per cent—
one-tenth of the present tax.
not afford to let them go."
Now, this is the truth: The three
were Colonel Becker, brother of Com
missioner Becker, drawing $150 per
month, who has not done a rap of work
since Inspector Reishus has been iii
Clausen's place, and who, it is officially
stated, had not done any work for at
least two years, not even to the extent
of signing his name, unless in drawing
his pay. Another is Deputy Frank Cur
tis, drawing $115 per month, and the
third O. H. Kirkc, a helper, drawing
$62.50. Inspector Reishus found that the
work of the last two could be done by
the remaining deputy, Mr. Squires. He
therefore recommended the dismissal of
all three officials, at a total saving of
$327.50 per month. Reform Commis
sioner Ringdahl voted for the inspec
tor's recommendation. His colleagues
agree in letting out Colonel Becker, but
made his dismissal Dec. 15, so that he is
only cut off 15 days, since he would have
gone Jan. 1 anyhow, on which date we
shall have an actual Reform and Demo
cratic majority on the board by a suc
cessor to Judge Mills. It was clearly
understood that the recommendation for
removal of the three was because they
were of no earthly use.
Inspector Clausen had carried these
useless men for years.
CATHOLICS IN B0ERLAND.
What a Priest Says In a Letter to
John Dillon, H. P.
The following letter from a Catholic
priest to Mr. John Dillon, M. P., ex
plains itself:
"36 Rue de Pare, Charenti, France, 10th
November, 1899.
"Dear Mr. Dillon:—I spent twelve
years in South Africa, Cape of Good
Hope, Western District, four of which
brought me into daily contact with the
Boers in what is called the 'Great Kar
roo.' The territory of which I had
charge was twice as large as Ireland,
with one church, and I the only priest.
The Catholics, thinly scattered, did not
exceed 250 all told, and many of these
were laborers and tenants on Boer
farms. I spent half my time traveling
about, ministering to my scattered flock,
and had to depend upon the hospitality
of the Boers—who were all Protestants.
That hospitality was never denied me.
I found the Boers simple, honest, moral,
religious and kind people. I bore this
testimony to the Boers in my book en
titled 'Twelve Years in South Africa,'
aind I gladly repeat it now. In 1875 I
returned to Europe in broken-down
health, and after many years of mission
ary work in England I went again to
Africa three years ago, this last time as
an invalid. I traveled all over Natal,
Transvaal and Kaffraria—a guest of the
Catholic bishop of Nata? and the Ob
lates of Mary Immaculate. I entered the
Transvaal soon after the 'Jameson raid,'
and was surprised to find that all those
of whom I asked the question—what are
the grievances of the Outlanders that I
see paraded in vague terms in the Eng
lish newspapers? answered—"That is all
a get-up of capitalists and a dodge of
England to take the Transvaal from the
Boers.' I was in Natal while the 'com
mission' was sitting in London to ex
onerate Chamberlain and Co. from all
complicity in the raid, and I well re
member how people laughed at the thin
ness of the whitewash that was used for
this end.
"I view the present war as simply
Raid the Second, but this time by Cham
berlain and thousands of soldiers.
"The determination is to wipe out the
Boers, who stand in the way of the gold
grabbers. If the Transvaal had been a
vegetable garden there would have been
no war but it is a rich gold field—the
richest on earth—and therefore the own
ers, the Boers, who are unwilling to be
robbed, must be mowed down to feed
ambition and greed. Yours,
"JAMES O'HAIRE."
The Little Dreamer.
A beautiful ship is at anchor now
On the strand of a moonlit sea,
And the shining sails are furled close
That will soon be flowing free.
So sleep, my baby, my little one,
You will sail on that ship tonight
And angels bright will guide your bark
O'er a sea of silvery light.
You will visit a land oft seen in dreams,
Hear music ne'er heard before
By mortal ear,—while the angels steer
Your bark to some mystic shore.
A land with castles of shining gold
And birds of every hue
That singing sweet in the summer night
Shall bathe in the sparkling dew.
So rest, little dreamer, the moon is
bright,
And smile in your sunny sleep,
While angels guard with their snowy
wings,
And your bark speeds o'er the deep.
It will fade away with the dawning light,
That beautiful ship at sea,
And naught be left of those visions
bright,
My dreaming babe, to thee.
And so it will be when to man's estate
Our dreamer fair has grown
The dreams he dreamed in childhood's
years
Shall have vanished, all have flown.
So dream, dream on, my little one,
For you sail on that ship to-night
Ang angels bright will guide your bark
O er a sea of silvery light.
—Mary M. Maher.
