Wheat Sown Late Is In Had Condition.
The December crop report says: The
average condition of wheat in the state
is 88 per cent of condition in average
years. The figures for the southern
counties are 84, central 91, northern
101. From the statements of corre
spondents in the southern counties it
is clear that the fields in that section
are unusually spotted, the plant has
made small growth and does not cover
the ground as in average years.
"Wheat sowed early on thoroughly cul
tivated ground is in nearly average
condition. Put a large percentage of
Michigan wheat was sowed late, on
ground that it was impossible to prop
erly fit owing to its extremely dry con
dition. The warm, wet weather that
prevailed in the early part of Novem
ler was exceptionably favorable and
of marked benefit, but it was then too
late for wheat to make its usual fall
growth. Fifty-one correspondents re
port hog cholera, 43 being from south
ern counties.

AFFAIRS IN GENERAL.
BRIEF MENTION OF EVENTS OF
INTEREST.
Ilrltlsh Official Find Math to Worry
Thein In Their Foreign Affairs
The President's Mother Is Dead
Cuba's Prospects are lirlght.
British Have Troubles of Their Own.
Comment is made in London over the
fact that four cabinet meetings were
held the past week. With France try
ing to filch slices of African territory
which Great Pritain is in the habit of
calling her own, and Germany loosen
ing tho "cinch" which England has al
waj's claimed to have in China, while
Great Pritain herself is trying to grab
a little more country at various other
points, and with the preparation of
the legislative program, the ministry
has no lack of worries. France is de
liberately pursuing the task of seizing
the -upper waters of the Nile above
Khartoum, thus cutting the Pritish
line of communication between Cape
Town and Suez.
All the Pritish forces under Gen. Sir
Wm. Lockhart, on the Indian frontier,
have been withdrawn to the Para val
ley for the winter. Thus tho largest
and best equipped force ever assembled
in India has failed and the whole work
will have to be repeated in the spring.
About 1,400 otllcers and men killed or
wounded, 35,000,000 of rupees spent in
loss and Pritish prestige weakened on
the frontier are the debits against
which a few mud huts and Sangars
blown up and probably several thou
sand natives killed are the only appar
ent credits.
Mm McKlnley Dead.
Mrs. Mclvinley, mother of the Presi
dent, died at Canton. She passed away
quietly, surrounded by her family.
President McKinley continued his
vigil all day and up to the last moment,
much as he had the preceding days.
He sat almost constantly in the sick
room and there secured about all the
rest he had. His attention has been
almost wholly given to the patient,
watching intently for the slightest
change. He had the newspapers at
his side, and when the mother rested
peacefully he glanced over the columns
for the news of the day. He and his
wife took a few turns on the porch for
exercise and a little fresh air, and u
little later he and his brother Abner
took a walk through the back streets.
Aside from this he was scarcely out of
the room.
China Yields All Germany Asks.
Dispatches from Shanghai saj: It is
reported that China is willing to pay
an indemnity of 1,000.000 taels, about
$781,250, and to grant all tho German
demands, including the temporary ces
sation of Kiao-Chau bay and adjoining
territory.
Dr. Stcubel, the German consul at
Shanghai, has been ordered to Kiao
Chau to establish a regular German
administration. Investigation shows
that the coal deposits in the province
of Shan Tung, which will become
available to Germany, with railway
and mining concessions are most valu
able. "Cuba 'Is Lost," Says a High Spaniard.
Havana: Senor Enrique Caprilles,
governor of the province of Santiago
de Cuba, in a conversation with the
foreign consuls, told them that the
Island of Cuba is lost. Many residents of
towns in the provinces of Pinar del Rio
and Havana have joined the ranks of
the insurgents. Col. Rafael de Car
denas, of tho insurgent forces, has
been promoted to the rank of brigadier
general. The Great Six-Day Hike Rare.
The greatest six-day bicycle race,
ever held was the one just finished in
the Madison Square Garden, New York
City. C. W. Miller, of Chicago, won first
money by making 2,093 miles and the
finish was witnessed by thousands of
people and over 100,000 people were
present during the progress of the con
test. , The entire ministry of I lay ti has re
signed owing to the outcome of the re
cent trouble with Germany.
Paron von Puelow, the German for
eign minister, is showing an iron hand
in the management of affairs, and the
emperor, it is said, is not informed of
any important foreign move until after
it has been made, when lie officially
approves of It instead of directing it as
heretofore. It is understood that it
was on this condition ISaron von Pue
low accepted the portfolio of foreign
affairs, and his policy seems to please
the populace.
Francis Kossuth, leader ot the party
advocating the cessation of tho agree
ment between Hungary and Austria,
and the independence of Hungary, has
declared that this party wishes eco
nomic separation from Austria as a
lever to obtain political independence.
"We want," he said, "a separate army
and separate finances. The king of
Hungary would be emperor of Austria
as a sort cf supplementary occupation.
Vienna is already a suburb of Puda
pest, and in time Austria wiU becoino
a conglomeration of provinces attached
to Hungary."
Ex-Senator Dubois, of Idaho, who
has just reached home after an ex
tended visit to Japan, China and Ha
waii, says the United States will not
annex these islands except, against the
bitter opposition of the natives. Ho
says thero arc no less than 1,200 male
Americans on the island and nearly
half of them are opposed to annexa
tion, while nearly all the balance of
the population are against it Nothing
but the support of the U. S. govern
ment keeps the present oligarchy, mis
named a republic, in power. They
could not sustain themselves a day if
the U. S. should withdraw its support
FIFTY-FIFTH CONGRESS.
The Senate received 108 new bills in
its second day's session. Mr. II. De S.
Money, of Mississippi, was introduced
and the oath of oflice was administered
to him. A motion to take up the
Lodge immigration bill was contested
by friends of proposed legislation to
confer authority upon the President to
act for the protection of the govern
ment's interest at the sale of the Kan
sas Pacific railway and was pending at
the close of the session. The House be
came embroiled in a lively skirmish
over the distribution of the various
parts of President's message to the
committees. The conflict of authority
came between the ways and means
committee and tho banking and cur
rency committee. During the debate
Gen. Grosvenor, of Ohio, lired the first
gun against the civil service law, and
Mr. Johnson, of Indiana, in a ring
ing warning, declared that if a bill to
emasculate the civil service law wenj
passed it would meet the presidential
veto. Eventually Mr. Dingley, of the
ways and means, in deference to the
opposition of the members of the bank
ing and currency committee, agreed to
a modification of the order of distribu
tion so as to send to the ways and
means committee all matters relating
"revenues, bonded debt of the country
and the treaties affecting the reve
nues." The resolution was then
adopted.
Sk.wvte. Third day. A short ses
sion, chiefly consumed by the members
in the presentation of memorials, reso
lutions and bills. A resolution pre
sented by Mr. Allen, Populist, of Ne
braska, declaring it to be the sense of
the Senate that the United States
should recognize the political inde
pendence of Cuba, was made the sub
ject of some remarks by the Nebraska
senator, in course of which hecriticised
the President for not carrying into ef
fect the pledge of the Republican
party made in its last national plat
form to recognize the independence of
the Cuban republic. Mr. Allen said he
would not bo content with the recogni
tion of belligerency, but would insist
upon the acknowledgment of their
political liberty. If necessary, this
recognition should be backed by a fleet
of American vessels in Cuban waters.
A bill was favorably reported by the
committee on foreign relations prohib
iting pelagic sealing by people of the
United States. It is believed that this
measure will settle the differences with
Great Pritain and Canada. A like bill
was introduced in the House also. The
only other business of importance be
fore the House was the pension appro
priation bill which was reported from
committee. The House session lasted
but 15 minutes.
Sknate. Fourth day. A large
amount of minor business occupied the
day. Senator Gallinger, chairman of
the committee on peusions, called at
tention to the increasing demand for
private pension legislation and re
quested senators to be careful in the
future to see that their bills for private
pensions were meritorious before they
were introduced. An attempt to se
cure au appropriation for the relief of
the Klondike miners resulted iu a reso
lution calling on the secretary of war
for information on tho subject. An
hour was spent on private pension bills
and 45 were passed. Houbk The pen
sion appropriation bill stirred up a de
bate which promises to be extended to
considerable length.
Fifth day. No session of the Senate.
HorsK. The pension appropriation bill
passed without amendment carrying
8U1,203.SSi). The amendments offered
by the Democrats to correct alleged ex
isting abuses were all ruled out on the
point of order that they were new leg
islation. The debate touched not only
the question of our pension policy, but
that of civil service reform and the re
ceipts and expenditures of the treasury
under the Dingley law. On the latter
question Mr. Dingley made an import
ant statement in which he expressed
the opinion that the receipts would
equal expenditures before the close of
the present fiscal j'ear, and predicted a
surplus of $10,000,000 for the following
year. The civil service law was sav
agely attacked by Messrs. Grosvenor
and Prown, of Ohio, and Mr. Linney,
of North Carolina, and was warmly de
fended by Mr. Johnson, of Indiana,
who won warm applause for the senti
ments he expressed.
Secretary of tho Treasury Gage in
his annual report gives the total re
ceipts of the government from all
sources as 8430,387,107 and expenditures
$448,439,022, showing a deficiency of
$18,052,451, as compared with the fiscal
year of 18'.)i; the receipts for 1897 in
creased $20,911,759, the increase of the
expenditures during the same period
being $13,594,713. The present tariff
act, the secretary says, has not been in
force long enough to determine fully
its merits, but it is believed that when
in full operation it will afford ample
revenue.
Poston is shipping over 2,000,000 bu
of grain abroad each month.
It is reported that Russia has deter
mined that. Germany's occupation of
Kiao-Chau shall not be permanent, nnd
is now making preparations to that
effect
The Spanish press is apparently
pleased with the President's message
as it is believed to strengthen the cmse
of Spain in Cuba and shows the there
is no cause for intervention by the
United States.
The movement of printers to secure
a nine-hour work day has succeeded in
New York City, after a threat had
been mado to call out tho 5,000 book
and job printers of the city. The
matter will be settled throughout the
country the first of next year.
Gen. Puis Rivera, of the Cuban" in
surgent army, and Col. Pacallao, his
second in command, who are in a
Spanish prison at Havana, were both
pardoned by royal decree of. the queen
regent of Spain. Poth absolutely re
fused to give their word not to fight
against Spain and now Gen, Blanco rc-
fuses to release them.
SPLENDID CUBAN VICTORIES
Destroy a Spanish Town Kill HO Hpan
lards Capture a Seaport.
Reports have been received of the
capture of tho Spanish stronghold at
Guisa. by the Cuban insurgents under
Lien. Garcia, and they state that the
entire garrison of the towot composed
of 800 men, was killed. Only 45 Span
ish soldiers survived and they were
made prisoners by Gen. Garcia. Tho
Spanish official report describes the
terrific effects of the pneumatic dyna
mite gun used by Gen. Garcia. The in
surgents fired 73 dynamite shots on
the forts and each shot wrought terri

REVIEW OF TRADE.
The opening of congress, with the annual
message and reports, has not dtscouraged
business as some predicted, but all specula
tive markets were stronger the past week
than the week before. The productive In
dustries, even in the season usually atuxit
the dullest of the year as to new orders,
meet a dellnlte Improvement in demand for
imjiortant products, presumably the trult of
a prevailing conviction lhat liew busAnes
will begin to crowd the work after the new
year starts. The outward movement of
wheat and other product continues so
heavy that foreign exchange has fallen
three-quarters of a cent, and instead of ex-
fiorts of gold, which have marked December
n recent years, imports would come If
gold were wanted or needed. .Securities
areKteadily advancing with, tie the largely
increased earnings o( most tf the railroad.
A striking comparison tor Ave years nhowa
that In each of the last three mouths earn
ings of the railroads have been greater than
in any previous year, with a larger Increase
in November than In October r September.
The sudden rise In December wheat at Chi
cago would do harm were It not based
m avowed contracts. t xhlp Home mil-'
Hons of bushels to. Kixroje. That tact and
the continued foreign demand. In Kptte of
Mich contracts, has helped a rise elsewhere.
Western receipts for the past week were
.7!m.7n bu. against 8.l.371 bu last year, and
no great Is the frelgn shortage that the
outgo f corn last year, far greater than
ever before, is again exceeded. The report
that western supplies are running 'ow Is dis
credited by receipts from farms. Cotton in
stronger In aptte of high estimates of yield
by well-known authorities. The demand
for woolen goods has clearly Improved.
While some grades have been sold largely
at rrlces lower than a month ago, quuta
tlona are generally maintained.
