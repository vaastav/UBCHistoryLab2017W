THE SECRETARY OF tlAll's REPORT.
Secretary Stanton rapidlv reviews the n.<>re
important military operations of the year,
referring especially to the victories of Stone
River, Gettysburg, Vicksburg anil Port Hud
ron, the operations in t’ennes-eo, the recent
splendid successes of Gen. Grant before Chat
tanooga, the opening of the Mississippi and
territorial division of the Rebel Confederacy,
the campaign of Gen. Burnside in Hast Ten
nessee and his gallant defense >f Knoxville,
the occupation of the western frontier of
Texas, and the probable re-toration of the
State. The armies in Viigiaia are relatively
in about the same position as last year, and
their campaigns have r< -ulted in nearly equal
losses.. Hut the general success of the year
is so great that the Depaitment is able to
reduce its estimate- for the ensuing year more
than s2* K),( h'i >(H
The present suspension of the exchange oi
prisoner- is due to the bad faith of the rebels
in putting the paroled Vicksburg and Port
Hudson prisoners into the field before they
were exchanged, and to the refusal to recog
nize colored troops as prisoners of war. The
rebels are attempting by barbarous treatment
of our prisoners to compel the Government
to exchange 40,0 **• for and to leave
our colored troops to rebel mercy. It' neces
sary for the protection of our soldiers, strict
retaliation in the treatment of prisoners w ill
be resorted to.
Tite enrollment act has been enforced in
twelve States, producing 60,0* i( soldiers, and
SIO,OOO,(XX>. The act is imperfect, but can
iiv made an efficient means for recruiting the
National forces. No decisive opinion is ex
pressed on the *3t>o commutation clause. A
large proportion of veterans w ill re-enlist,
and the required forces w ill iu a great meas
ure be raised by volunteering. An immediate
appropriation for bounties should be made.
The invalid corps, oigauized to give honor
able employment to partially disabled officers
and soldiers, numbers over 2(*,(mhi, and is in
all respects a success.
Colored troops have been diligently enlist
ed ; re mm hi are now 5a service, and their
numbers rapidly increase. Their courage
and capacity have been amply proved at Mil-
Hken’s Bond, Port Hudson and Fort Wagner;
and more recently negro cavalry, in the Ya
zoo \ alley, routed a superior force of rebels.
These troops have been allowed no bountv,
and are paid but ten dollars a month—a dis
tinction which is unequal and unjust, and to
remove which an amendment of the law Is
recommended. The colored women and chil
dren, and the aged and infirm, should be pro
vided for by Government.
Some matters in the Adjutant General’s
office arc briefly touched. A system of exact
accountability, in leave of absence cases, has
been established. The ordnance expenses for
. , . •
the t'iiiii' period 1,577 cannon, 1,052,Ml mu.v
kets and i fli i, 282,889 ca ines and jiistola,
I,2‘.'s,‘>Oii cannon shot and shell, 48,719,862
pound- of lead and bullets, 1,435,046 artillery
cai‘ridges, 259,022,216 cartridges for small
arms, and other munitions in proportion have
boon purchased. A tabular abstract is given.
The domestic manufacture of arms and mu
nitions has greatly increased and improved.
So of the materials used ; wrought iron, for
instance, being now made in America supe
rior to that imported. Two millions of dol
lars should h* appropri wed for supplying the
State militia- with arm-. Seaboard and bor
der fortifications h oc been put during the
year iu amm U strong* d*-tensive condition.
Vacancies from the rebel States in tin* Mili
tary Academy at We-t Point have been sup
plied from the loyal States. .V report con
cerning the Academy is annexed. Tue sur
veys >l the Northern md Northwestern Lakes
have been actively conoam and, and a report is
expected on tin* deb .sive works required to
guard the lake shores.
For details of operations iu the Quarter
master-Gene nd’s Department, reference is
made to his report. A cavalry Bureau for
the supply of horses ha- been established.—
The Commissary-General's office ha- kept the
army at all point - supplied w ith abundance
<>l wholesome food, and inis also furnished
subsistence to prison* ; , contrabands in great
numbers, and to stiff* rii <_ Unionists in rebel
States. The armii .- *... \■ • been paid, with
few exceptions, to Oct. 31. of the -present

the general hospit is v. - ‘.‘.l per cent., and in
the lead 4.4 per cent., of the whom strength
of the army, ot whom 11 percent, are wound
ed and 2.5 per cent. sick. By the system of
inspectors the medical and hospital service
has been greatly improved. Tne health of
the troops has been good, and their mortality
less than last y* ar. The Signal Corps is dif
ferently valued by different Generals, but its
continuance is recommended with proper re
strictions. I’he Military Tciegraph has been
ot inestimable value. Gn the 12th of duly, i
1862, there were 3,571 miles of laud and sub
marine lines, and during the year 1,755 miles
were constructed, making a total of 5,526
miles in operation. It is estimated that
1,200,000 telegrams have been sent within
the year, varying in length from ten to a
thousand words.
Commissioners under act of Congress have
reported that sß')<>,6l2 are due to officers and
men actually employed in the Western De
partment, or Department of Missouri, for ptv,
bounty, and pensions. An appropriation u,>
that amount i- recommended. Other large
classes of claims require Congressional legis
lation for their adjustment and payment. The
Judge-Advocate-General and his assistants
have been diligent and successful in the de
tection and prevention of military crimes ami
frauds. The office demands an enlargement
of its facilities. During fourteen months
17,557 military trials were reviewed, and
2,45*0 reports issue*!. Credit is given b\ the
Secretary to the Chief- of Bureau in the War
Department for their efficiency, and the re
port. concludes with the hope that another
year will see the rebellion completely over
thrown.
THK XAW PEP.VRTMKXT.
The Secretary ef the Nav* opens his re
port with a review of the blockade during the
past year—a block.ole unparalleled in point
of extent, for it covers, according to an ac
curate table of measurement prepared at the
Coast Survey Office, a distance **t 5,51*,*
statute miles, with 183 harbor or river open
ings, or indentations. The blockade i- * -
coming more effective and complete. Pro
gress has been made in repelling the Rein is
from the coast and circumscribing their
limits.
The North Atlantic Squadron has -o effi
ciently penetrated, w atched and guarded the
river-of Virginia, the sounds of Not in C
lina and the entire coast, as to cut off all in
tercourse with the rebels, with the single ex
ception of the port ot Wilmington, to close
which has been difficult from its two inlets,
thirty mile- apart, flunked by * xtensive bat
u nes. Some fast it* ui era ;.; *, •. m dei the
cover of darkness, succeeded in eluding cap
ture, but most even of that description of
vessel- have fallen into our hands or been

of Florida to Cuba and Nassau, presents -o

c+ptured <>r b--trovfd.
Tlie Western Gult and He- Mi-si-sippi
Squadrons asslste*! in some ot the greatest
victories obtained for our cause during the
year —the farmer aiding in reducing Port
Hudson, and the latter in reducing Vicksburg.
Together they thus opened the navigation of
the Mississippi—one of tho heaviest blows in
flicted upon the rebels -ineo the beginning
of the war. Only one point of importance
for successfully eluding the blockade w as still
iu the po--session of the rebels—the mouth ot
the Rio Grande ; and this has now also been
closed by the successful expedition of Gen.
Banks.
The increase of the naval force during the
past year hvs again been very considerable.
At the commencement of the Administration
it consisted of 76 vessels, and of these only
42 were in commission. In December, 186-g,
the number of our vessels was 127 ; during
the current year it has increased to 588.
The Secretary calls attention to the highly
important improvements in naval w arfare to
winch our war has led, and which have as
tounded tlie entire civilized world—the in
troduction into naval service of iron shield
ing and of ordnance of a caliber, reach and
power heretofore regarded as impossible. Me
urges upon the consideration of Congress the
adoption of farther measures for creating a
powerful navy. The establishment of anew
Navy Yard on a large scale, he regards as an
indispensable necessity, as our present facili
ties for manufacturing and repairing steam
machinery are entirely insufficient. Sugges
tions arc made as to the establi. hmenl of a
N val Depot on the Mississippi, the educa
tion of engineers, the Naval Academy, the
enlistment of seamen and other important
subjects.
The number of vessels captured by the
squadrons and reported to the Department on
the Ist of November is 1,045 classified as
follows: Schooners, 547 ; steamers, 179;
-loops, 131; brigs. 30; barks. 26: ships.
15 : y achts and small boats, 117. This is
exclusive of a large number destroyed ou the
Mis-is-ippi and other rivers, and on the coast.
In the discharge of his arduous duties, Mr.
Welles has “ has been constantly cheered and
sustained by the assured conviction that the
Navy ot the I nited States has achieved a
great and new historical renown ; that it has
expanded and is expanding in a measure com
mensurate with the exigencies of the country
and of the times ; that it has done and is
doing heroic service in a great and sacred
cause, and that its force is wielded by a bodv
of officers and men who have established the
highest claim to tlie gratitude of the country.”
GREAT OCXS IN' THE MANY.
The Report ot the Ordnance Bureau gives
au interesting view of the enforced progress
of work in that important branch of service.
■The naval ordnance at the beginning of 1861,
eonsisted of 1,872 thirty-twos, 575 eight-inch,
305 nini -inch Dahlgrens, 46 ten-inch, old and
new, 32 eleven-inch Daiilgrens; making2,Bßo
heavy guns; with 29 twenty-fours, I(*7
twelves, and 136 boat howitzei-j We have
now 1.2U2 howitzers of all kinds, 1,872 thir
ty-t*vus, 575 eight-inch, Bi>B nine- nch Dahl
giens, 56 ten-inch, old and new, 323 eleven
inch Dahlgrens, 2*hi thirteen-inch mortars,
21 f twenty-pound Parrotts, 237 thirty-pound
Parrotts, 180 one-hundred-pouud Parrotts, 60
one huudrcd-aud-filty-pound Parrotts, 13 twen
ty-pound rifled Parrotts, and 36 fifteen-inch
ires; in all 5,777 piti —i, : f
2,966 in 1861. Over 7*>o more guns of tlie
new sort will be done before the vear closes.
.*• veral new foundries have been started, and
the means an- now equal to the demand.
The enormous amount o! projectiles used may
be seen in the following figures: Shells, made
md bought, 678,617; ‘hot 80,392; shrapnall,
grup •, and cannister, 9,443,948 pounds. Of
gunpowder, 2,980 tuns have been ordered
since March 1, 1861—of which 2,676 ::;i ; -
wre from for* ign niter. The report details
operations in small-arms, gun-carriages, fuses,
.Vo. AH this appertains to the Navy alone.—
The report says ; ‘ The general efficiency of
the ordnance of our Navy far excels that of
any other, its superiority being due mainly, or
wholly, to the improvements of the last'two
years. Further extensive improvements are
in contemplation, and estimates in accordance
are presented to Congress.”
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Secretary of the Interior
is .1 clear and comprehensive document. Sec
retary Usher reviews the operations of hi* Bu
reau in the fullest detail, and, in general shows
very satisfactory results, accompanied by sensi
ble suggestions. One of those suggestions is
that a moderate t;u be levied on the product
of the gold mines, which arc now unburden
ed in that respect. Indian alfiirs are re
viewed at length, and the setting apart of
new and larger reservations is urged; the
Pension Bureau is rapidly increasing in Us
number of pensioners, which now reach 18,-
b.V.' from the army and 1,1.*2 from the navv,
requiring an outlay of fully §1,300,000
per annum; the Patent Office has issued near
ly four thousand patents during the past year;
the Government Asylum for the Insane lias
greatly enlarged its sphere of usefulness by
affording a refuge for many of the unfortu
nates of the war, and the Institution for tire
Deaf, Dumb and Blind has been managed
with great success ; good progress has been
made on the Capitol extension, and nearly all
the works of art designed to embelish the
Capitol building have been completed and
put in their place-, in reference to the Afri
can Slave trade, the Secretary says not a sin
gle vessel is known to have been fitted out
for that purpose in our own waters during the
past year. An indisposition on the part of
the negroes to eoloni/.e is noted, and in view
of thi' new policy of the Government toward
them it is now questionable whether the ef
fort should be kept up. It is suggested that
thousands of tree colored laborers mav be
profitably employed in the construction of the
Pacific Railroad. The establishment of a
Bureau of National Statistics is earnestly
recommended, because it will contribute to
the advancement of all the public interests
—commerce, agriculture, finance, Ac.—and
enable the Government to permanently pro
s’. rvo the experience and statistical kuowl
edge it has gained. The rest of the report
treats mainly of affairs in the District of Co
lumbia, all ol which are represented as in
commendable shape.
Accompanying the report of the Secretary
••f the Interior is that of the Commissioner of
the General Land Office. The great struggle
in which the country is engaged still tends to
retard the purchase and settlement of the
v.uniic domain, and as a source of revenue
the public land sales cannot be depended on
at present. But the operations of the Home
stead Law are encourasring, a million and a
half acres having been taken up under that
law during the past rear. The other opera
tions ol the Land Office have boon of a minor
character; some tew surveys have been com
pleted. others contracted for, and several
riea I But I most
important part of the report is that relating
to the minerals. A full description of the
mini s, their locality and extent, is given, which
. .
i;._c on the Kocky Mountains, or extending to
t Pacific, is rich in all the precious metals,
nd that the vast wealth of these mines is
only just beginning to bo developed. Idaho'
C i.e-ado, W a.-hington, V. vada and Arizona,
t - y nothing of California and Oregon, are
\ ,-r placers of gold and silver, as well as
h.. , tin, coal, Ac. The gigantic wealth of
thos countries can scarcely be conceived.

POSTMASTER GENERAL.
The report of the Postmaster General state.-
the receipts of the year at *11,165,789.59,
f he expenditures at %lis 1. 2 6.84, |
lag a deieiency of *150,417.25. Within an
other yetr it is expected to be self-sustaining.
In 1860 the excess of expenditures was $3,-
560,566.15. The cost of postal service is
8 ‘v >Oo,o(jq less than before the rebellion,
while the receipts have increased more than
2,00u,000. The increase of R. venue over
1862, is $1,863,968.69.
The number of Rost Offices, including the
rebel Status, is 29,047, being’an increase du
ring the ytar, of 172. The” President ap
points 550 Postmasters, and the Postmaster
General 28,197. Fight hundred and thirty
Post Offices have been established during the
year, and 6-i> discontinued.
In July the system of delivering mail mat
ter by cal rfers, was put into operation at
forty-nine oi' the larger offices. Experience
demonstrates that correspondence increases
with every fU-llity for its conduct. In New
York there wire delivered by carriers, 2,069,-
4IS letters, aid 1,810,717 were collected by
them during flic first quarter, being an in
crease ot 1*68,P29 fitters, or 25 per cent, over
the last quarter of tlie preceding year under
the old system Tin- postage on foreign let
ters was -81.22.',675.21, an increase of SBO,-
579.39 over fi*4 year. Of this amount, $757,-
030 was collected in the United States, and
*467,636.22 in turope. The postage on Can
ada letters was $225,7-13.30, or $17,989.79
over last year. Ot this, $124,480.45 was col
lected in the Edited States, and $101,262.85
ill the British provinces.
No progress Ins been made in negotiations
foi anew postal convention with Prussia. A
grand lutcruatiaial Postal Convention was
held in Paris, in lay last, and ihirtv-oue arti
cles agreed upon. Among other things, it is
agreed that, whenever it is possible, prepay
ment on ordinary letters shall be at the op
tion of the sender, Registered letters must
be prepaid in all kases. The m trical deci
mal sy-tem shall b adopted for international
postal ivlarions, to the exclusion of ever*
other system. Our object is t > establish uni
form rates for all countries, as far as possi
ble. A reduction <jf postal rates, combined
with a large increase of postal correspond
ence, will result froli the new system. This
Convention was hell at the suggestion of the
Hon. John A. Ka.-fcon, who was the able
American representative iu it. The mail was
carried by rail 22,871,558 miles, at a cost of
11 cents per mile; by steamboat, 2,004,771
miles, at II 1-5 cents, and by other modes,
31,349,686 miles atfl.j cents per mile. The
total cost of transportation, including the .- il
aries of agents, wits $6,236,622. T e in
crease of transportafon over 1802 is $*.793,-
490 miles, at a decrense in cost of sll 3,253.
The number of post iffices in operation dur
ing the year was, 21,645. The number of
dead letters received and examined was
2,550,416, or 268,396 more than last year.—
The number eontainiig money was 18,527,
amounting to *77,861, showing an inurea-c
of 8,052 letters, and in monev of $31,322. Of
these, 15,048 were delivered to their owners,
but many of them were sent out a second
time, and some three or four times before
reaching them. The number of dead letters
covering valuable papers w as B,332,represen
ting $15,444,277 81. Tlie dead letters con
taining photographs numbered 10,918; those
containing jewelry, 764, and 897 with other
articles. Of the whole number sent to the
dead letter office, 8,273 were restored to the
writers. Tho loss of valuable letters from
the army is largely traceable to dishonest let
ter carriers in the military service,and further
loss is attributed to Indifference and careless
ness on the part of some who distribute mail
matter in our armies.
Many matters of less interest arc treated of
in the report.

Senator Foote introduced a bill granting

Telegraph line 1 , by the northern route, and
asked that the bill 1,-c relerred to a special

The motions of reference of the respective
subjects embraced in the President’s iicssaa.
were then entertained, and the same were
referred to the appointed committees.
Senator Lane, of Indiana, introduced a bill
to amend the act entitled “an act to define
and punish conspiracies,” passed July 31st,
1801 ; also the 24th section of the act for
enrolling and calling out the national forces,
passed March 3d, 1803,
Senator Hendricks introduced a bill to ex
tend the time in which Stales may avail
themselves of the grant of land for Agricul
tural and Industrial Colleges.
Senator Davis, of Kentucky, called up the
resolutions in relation to the exchange of
prisoners, arguing vehemently against the
policy of refusing an exchange to our sutler
ing w hite soldiers —the languishing, starving,
and diseased white men—because the rebels
refuse to exchange the negro captives, lie
denounced at length the policy ot the Admin
istration upon the several points in which the
negro is affected, characterizing its position
as monstrous, and referring to the present
era as the reign of Abraham First, lie aver
ed that his own loyalty was unspotted, that
he hated with undying vigor the crime of
secession, it was evident, he said, that this
policy was only a part of that design to per
petuate the party power ol the Administra
tion. He closed with an indignant and ear
nest protest against the refusal of the Admin
istration to liberate thousands of starving and
dying white men for the sake of a few ne
groes.
Senator Johnson deemed it perfectly clear
that humanity, which is the highest policy,
demanded the continuance of the exchange of
prisoners, lie proceeded to combat the opin
ions of the Senator from Kentucky, (Davis)
that these men should not be protected, and
corrected his views of the power of the Pres
ident, by quoting from the Constitution rela
tive to the executive and the legislative pow
ers.
Senator Davis replied, saying the preamble
of the Constitution confers no power on the
Government. The Supreme Court had so in
terpreted it. He also claimed that the Presi
dent had no right to suspend the w i it of Itaieas
corjdts , which was a legislative and not an ex
ecutive function. The powers to be exercis
ed are conferred by the Constitution aione,
and there are no powers vested in the Gov
ernment which ate not conferred by the Con
stitution ; hence, he President cannot raise
troops or armies, nor has the power to organ
ize any measure to put down insurrections
without the assent of Congress. It was the
determination of the party in power that the
war shall continue till the n°xt Presidential
election. The war would have been brought
to a close long ago, if the Administration had
singly and in good faith devoted itself to the
principles announced in the Crittenden reso
lution, and if the commanders of the armies
had not been selected, not because of their
hostility to the rebels, but because of their
opposition to slavery.
Senator Hale, of X. IL, rose to indignantly
deny that it was the desire of the gentlemen
on this floor to continue the war in order to
influence the next Presidential election. A
more atrocious allegation against honorable
men was never listened to from the begin
ning of time to the present moment. If the
allegations of the Senator were true, he
would rather take into his own hand the hand
of a man from the charnel-house recking
with pestilence, than the hands of those
around him. If the allegation was true, then
every Senator was stamped with the foulest
treason and perjury. The destinies of (he
country have been submitted to the gentle
men around him, who are bound by their
oath to sustain the country and the constitu
tion, and defend the fire-sides and homes
threatened by invasion, while the Senator from
Kentucky says they arc hypocrites, and do not
mean to sustain these objects.
Senator Davis explained that he had refer
ence to those in power.
Senator Hale replied that the Senator had
made an allegation which embraced every
Senator. It was an allegation which, if true,
would disgrace the vilest inmate of a peni
tentiary. The character of the President
wa- also included in this allegation. He be
lieved there was one thing to which every
body assented, that President Lincoln is emi
nently an honest and patriotic man. To-day,
for the first time, lie had heard the honesty
and patriotism of the Executive questioned,
li the Government has called for black sol
diers to take up arms, and calls them out to
fight u.e battles of the country, it is bound
to protect them at all hazards and by every
means it can put fort.;. The Government
having used them, and they having bee. m
prisoners, if they are abandoned to their fate
it is guilty of baseness unparalleled in histo
ry. The party in power has one aim, and
that aim is the country; but one purpose,
and that is the salvation of the country.—
Too idea tiiat the Administration and us sup
p irters desire the continuation of the war, in
order to conn ol the next Presidential elec
tion —desire this cruel war, with its cries of
anguish, with our sons ,iven to slaughter, our
widows in mourning and our kindred to de-
S'-vu, etofe —i.> m -amadou -so b-.-o that he

resolutions referring the various brunches of
the President - message to the appropriate
committees, and that part with reference t
the treatment and condition of rebellious
.-tat. s to a select committee of nine, to be
appointed by liie Speaker.
Mr. Davis Ol Maryland, offered as a substi
tute, that so much of the President’s Message
as related to the duty of the United States to
guarantee to any State a republican form of
government and restore it to those states in
which the government has l>een abrogated or
overthrow n bo referred to a select committee
of nine, who shall report the bills necessary
to carrv into effect this duty.
Mr. Brooks of New York sai l if the pro
position of Davis should be persisted in, he
should be disposed to add that this special
committee also enquire whether a Republican
government lias not been abrogated and over
thrown in the North* as well as in the South
since tiic revolution began.
Mr. liOvejoy said that in spite of certain
individuals there .-till exists a Republican
government in all the States of the North
without abridgement or abatement. He was
for the Constitution as it is and the Inion
as it yvits, and not as it has been falsely in
terpreted. He would dispossess the slave
holders of the Union as ho would those who
seized the Clusujh ike. lie would put a loyal
crew on board and sr.il the good ship Union as
our fathers framed it.

SENATE.
Washington, Dec. 17.
Senator Hale rose to a privileged question.
He desired to send to the Clerk to read, a
newspaper paragraph, charging with bribery a
Senator from Now England, in securing the
release for the Sum of 83,000, of two prison
ers from the old Capitol Prison. From infor
mation received from a Senator, he yvas led
to believe that he (Hale,) yvas the person al
luded to. He wished to make a statement of
the facts on which the charge was founded.
Senator Hale then, at some lengtii, ex
plained that lie had acted as counsel for those
persons, and that he had asked the advice of
lion. Reverdy Johnson and oth rs if he could,
consistenly ith his piosition as a United
States Senator, act a> the legal adviser of the
above mentioned parties. He was assured
he could ; that there existed no reason why
he should not. Hon. Reverdy Johnson stated
to him that he yvuc= himself engaged in eucii
cases daily. Under these circum
stances he had acted for tbe prisoners. He
(Hale) then stated the facts ul the cusc, a lid
concluded by saying that what he had done
in the premises was not done inadvertently
but advisedly, and with cautious deliberation.
Senator Johnson remarked that he recol
lected distinctly that Senator Hale called on
him as stated, . nd reported the conversation
materially a- stated. In answer to his (Hale’s)
inquiry whether a Senator was prevented
from acting as eoun.-el for prisoners charged
before a court martial with fraud, he
(Johnson) said he saw no legal impediment
in the way or ev- n indelicacy. What the
Senator had done was no doubt done in con
sequence ol this opinion. Senators do not
cease to be lawyers if called upon lor pro
fessional services. He saw no diiliclty in
complying unless the services involved the
neglect ol public duties, lie (Johnson) had
repeatedly acted hims-.il ujsiii this assump
tion. The only qu* stion that can arise is the
pos-ibiiit;. of enacting any law to prevent it.
There was a law preventing isenators
from prosecuting suits against the govern
ment '.■‘■fore the Court of Claims. He be
ii veil one has a right to go before any other
court in the United States, it was not the
intention of the law to prevent a lawyerprac
t.sing iu his protession.
Senator Hale submitted tin- following reso
lution, which \yus adopted;
Ji suit •/, That the Commit!i.i- on the .luliciary
