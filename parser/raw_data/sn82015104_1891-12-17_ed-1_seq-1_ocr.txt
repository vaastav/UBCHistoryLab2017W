CRISP'S APPOINTMENTS.
The House Committees to be An
nounced Next "Wednesday.
Washington, Dec. 16.—The appoint
ment of the House Committee on Rules
i - regarded by members of the House as
return to the former policy of appointing
Members of this committee without
reference to their other committee assign
ments. McMillin, one of the new mem
bers of the Roles Committee, is promi
nent as a tariff reformer, and was one of
the most active members of the Ways
aud Means Committee. He says, how
ever, that he is in favor of the apppint
, men! of Mills as Chairman of the last
i ained committee. McMillin's selection
*s a member of the Rules Committee is
ascribed to his parliamentary ability, his
eilectivoness as a debater and the fact that
he personally is very well liked by the
members on the Democratic side, and
j 1, therefore, be of great assistance in
h idling a harmonious adjustment of any
conferences which may arise as to party
jolicy. Catchings of Mississippi is a
l-rm personal friend of the new Speaker,
and one of the active men of his canvass.
He is also popular with the members of
the House, is an experienced member of
tue House, an active worker and a clear
and forcible speaker.

THE AMERICAN REPUBLICS.
Awauened Interest In the Commerce
and Conditions of lister Countries.
Washington, Dec. 10.—President Har
rison to-day sent to the Senate a letter
from the Secretary of State, inclosing a
copy of the first annual report of Director
Curtis of the Bureau of American Re
publics. It says the immense number of
applications received lor information
about the North American countries give
ample evidence of awakened interest in
the commerce and conditions of the
American countries that is encouraging
to tho3e endeavoring to promote social
and commercial relations between the
American republics.
The report refers to the rapidly increas
ing export trade to the Central and South
American republics, and says many
I nited States manufacturers who never
attempted to sell merchandise in the
southern continent are now sending
agents into those markets to introduce
their goods. Merchants in Europe ex
clusively are now coming to the United
states, and invariably discover they can
find here nearly every article they "need,
ot better quality and at no greater cost.
The recently negotiated reciprocity ar
rangements, it is said, also afford them
opportunities that are beginning to be
understood and appreciated.
The report refers to work undertaken
by the bureau of interesting the Govern
ments and people of the Latin-American
Republics in the World's Fair. The in
vitation extended to them to participate
lias been cordially accepted by every re
public and colony, and appropriations
made to pay expenses of representation
that exceed in the aggregate 32,000,000,
more than has been provided for the
same purpose by the States of the United
States, with the State of Illinois excepted.
Ihe companies operating lines of steam
ships between the United States and the
Latin-American Republics joined heart
ily in the enterprise, and made generous
concessions. The bureau has been
enabled to prepare for exhibition at Chi
cago a historical collection, illustrating
the discovery, conquest and settlement of
Latin-America, and subsequent periods.
The report contains much information
of interest. Among other things it is pro
posed to prepare for the exposition a
commercial exhibit illustrating the vari
ous classes of merchandise best adapted
to the wants and most acceptable to the
tastes of the consumers in Mexico, Cen
tral and South America and the West
Indies. This exhibit, it is proposed, at
the close of the exhibition, to be perma
nently established, either at Washington
or Xew York.

*N 100,000; to British Guiana, &!, 100,000
--total, $10,200,000.

sugar and coffee into the United States, it

LOUISIANA DEMOCRATS.
The Party Divided Over the Lottery
Question.
Baton Rouge, Dec. 16.—The Demo
cratic Convention was announced to meet
here to-day, but when the time came two
distinct bodies assembled, this being the
result of the fight over the lottery ques
i tion. Last night the McEnerey men held
a caucus, as did also the Adams people,
and appointed a Conference Committee.
On behalf of the Adams men the com
mittee demanded that all frivolous con
tests be dismissed; all discussions as to
the submission of a lottery amendment
to white primaries be abandoned; that
the convention place in the platform an
anti-lottery plank, and that proper as
surances be given lor the faithful carry
ing out of its provisions.
The McEnerey committee replied that
its caucus, was composed of both pro and
anti-lottery men, who had come alike in
structed to submit the question to the
white primaries. They would not aban
don their position. If they did, it would
mean to the world that they were simply
office-seekers.
To-day, when the State Committee met,
Chairman Lanier was not present, and
the committee deposed him, electing
Governor WickeliiVe Chairman. The
committee then proceeded to perfect ar
rangements for a combination conven
tion, and the anti-lottery men, with
Lanier at their head, held a similar meet
ing. Efforts to heal the breach failed, and
at noon two conventions, each claiming
to represent the Democracy of the state,
assembled. Nothing beyond routine or
ganization was accomplished by either
body, except the appoiutment of a com
mittee by tho McKnerevJpeople to confer
with the opposition.
The anti-McEnereys had an internal
trouble of their own, a number of its
members desiring to abrogate the I .a
fayette agreement and bring a!tout the
nomination of a new ticket, in which the
farmers.were to have part, but not the
leadership. The fanners refused to budge
an inch, insisting upon the terms of the
agreement, and T. S. Adams for Gov
ernor. It is thought the oonvention will
carry out the agreement, as a refusal
would result in another division, and a
straight-out farmers' ticket.

Santa Fe (N. M.i, Dec. 16.—A1l the
through trains on the Santa Fo route
have been tied up at various points be
tween Las Vegas and Raton Tunnel for
the past four days, owing to the worst
snow blockade known in years. The
snow is two to four feet deep on a level
and has drifted badly. Hundreds of
Pacific Coast and east-bound passengers
are in tho blockade. Trains began mov
ing to-night. It is believed they will
now get through without any further
mishap.

EASTERN BASEBALL.
It Is Believed the Single-League Plan
Will Go Through.
Indianapolis, Dec. in. —The League
representatives met again this morning.
It was given out that the dillerenees be
tween Reach and Rogers and Wagner
Brothers, over the Philadelphia absorp
tion, was compromised privately, and
that the source of contention had been re
moved.
The baseball men spent all day in con
ference. The single-league plan, it is be
lieved, will go through. A general .scheme
for consolidating the two organizations is
now practically manifest. The joint con
ference of the two peace committees was
finished to-night,, and the committee
recommended the adoption of the twelve
dab league plan. After the adoption of
this recommendation the association ad
journed. A conference committee was
then arranged to meet separately the
clv i is that have been dropped—Milwaukee
and Columbus —and those absorbed—Bos
ton, Chicago and Philadelphia—and ex
piain the plan of their disposition.
On the surface there is no apparent kick
from anyone except tho newly projected
association club of Chicago. It is under
stood that the Columbus' price for the
franchise is $IS,OCO. The two organiza
tions will have a joint conference to-mor
row. Contingent upon the result of the
peace meeting, a new central league is
talked of, to be, of course, subordinate to
the big association. The nucleus is al
ready formed, including Indianapolis,
Columbus, Milwaukee, Detroit and*Buf
falo.

Volcanic Remains in Connecticut.
Several years ago, while walking down
the lower Connecticut Valley with a part v
of students, we chanced upon a curious
led^e of rock surmounting a low ridge by
the road that runs from Berlin to Meri
den, about half way between Hartford
and New Haven. A scramble up the
slope through a bushy growth of youn?
tree! led to the foot of the ledge—a" thick
bed of gray-greenish rock, not in layers
like limestone or sandstone, v.ot crystal
line like granite or gneiss, but of a loose,
structureless texture, here and there car
rying roughly-rounded blocks of a dense,
dark rock which we knew to be old lava,
from its resemblance to the rocks ejected
from modern volcanoes. Although a
ledge of this kind is not of ordinary oc
currence, its features were so well marked
that there could be little doubt of it- na
ture and origin. It was a bed of volcanic
ashes, interspersed with blocks or bombs
of lava that must have been thrown from
some neighboring vent long ago in the
ancient time when the rocks of the valley
were ma.de. The ash bed lay upon a se
ries of muddy sandstones that hud evi
dently been formed under water, for they
were deposited in layers, just as sand and
mud are now when they are washed into
a pond; and to all appearances the erup
tion of the ashes and bombs had taken
place during the accumulation of the
sandstones. — Professor W. M. Davis in
the Popular Scicuce.
A woman once consulted a seer regard
ing a way to retain the atfections of her
husband, and this was the advice re
ceived: "Get a raw piece of the best sir
loin steak, about half an inch thick. Rub
with a central slice from a wild onion,
salt and pepper. Toast over a bright coal
fire on a gridiron which is handled only
by yourself, never by your servants, then
put a little sweet butter over the beef.
«Tive him half a pound of this each morn
ing and do not speak as he eats it." —New
York Press.

Special to the Record-Unioit.
Merced, Dec. 16.—1t has just leaked
out that the Grand Jury, which adjourned
last week until January loth, has been
investigating tho Ivett murder case.
While it is not positively known what
evidence has been introduced before the
jury, it is rumored on the streets that it
j is of a sensational character. Detectives
attached to Lawson's agency are working
on th 9 case, and it is alleged that the evi
dence they have unearthed is too conclu
sive, as there aro corroborating circum
stantial evidence introduced at the famous
Olsen trial, which took plaeo here last
April, and that many are concerned. It
is alleged that on the night of the murder
Olsen went to the room of an inmate of a
house of ill-fame at La Grange at 2 a. m.,
aud, after washing blood off his hands
and face, changed his shirt, then re
mained in the room until about day
break ana crossed the river to liis
mother's homo. Through stategy the
woman was induced to tell all she knew
of the matter to two of her confidential
friends.
With a slight clew as to what became of
< ilsen's shirt, Lawson's agents removed
an outhouse in tho rear of the house in
Lagrange last week and on cleaning out
the excavation a shirt was found at the
bottom of the hole. The shirt has blood
on it.
Further disclosures are expected, as it
is rumored that Lawsou has further evi
dence and that warrants are out for the
conspirators, who, it is alleged, with
Olson, conspired to kill Ivett.
FOSTER BAR TRAGEDY.
Marjraret Sigjuorette Discharged After
a Preliminary Examination.
Marvsville, Dec. 16.—Margaret Sig
norette, the woman who shot her hus
band in the head at his request at their
j home near Foster's Bar in this county,
had her preliminary examination to-day,
and was discharged. The evidence showed
that tiie man was insane through drink
| ing cheap wines of his own make, that he
took strychnine, and it not having an im
mediate effect, he insisted upon his wife
shooting him. The aged woman, it was
conclusively established, was in mortal
fear of the man, and had never been
known to disobey his slightest request.
Even with this abject servitude he was
not satisfied, and her body shows cvi

LABOR INTERESTS.
Yesterday's Proceedings at the Ameri
can .Federation.
Birmingham (Ala.), Dec. 16.—At to
day's session of the Federation of Labor
majority and minority reports were sub
mitted on tbe motion to appropriate
§3,000 to help the Pittsburg Typographical
Union fight the injunction or conspiracy
cases in the courts. The majority report,
which was adopted after a long debate,
sets forth the belief of the Convention
that the Pennsylvania court exceeded its
authority, violated the principles of jus
tice, and illegally interfered with the lib
erties guaranteed in the bill of rights in
indicting union printers engaged in a
contest to maintain and defend their in
terests, who had committed no act in
volving a breach of the peace or violation
of the law.
The resolution directs the Executive
Council of the American Federation of
Labor to challenge the order of the court
by carrying the case to tho highest tri
bunal in the land, and appropriating
jv5,000 for the prosecution thereof, or in
the event that this case is not carried up
the Executive Council may use any part
of the sum named to test the constitu
tionality of the conspiracy laws or any
proceedings in equity against affiliated
unions or union men in any State of the
Union.
The resolutions also call upon affiliated
unions to co-operate in the work.
The request for aid from the striking
Indiana miners was referred to a com
mittee.
The Pacific Coast contested delegate
ease was disposed of amid great enthsi
asm by the adoption of the agreement
summarized in yesterday's dispatches.
The question of udmitting William C.
Pomeroy as a delegate from the Illinois
Federation was ruled out of order.
Resolutions were adopted as follows:
Urging the passage of Jaws prohibiting
barber shops opening on Sundays, and
asking the friends of labor not to patron
ize shops that open on Sunday or keep
open later than 8 P. m.; authorizing tho
National Harnessmakers Union to use a
label, especiall}- in Tennessee, Missouri
and Illinois, where harness is being made
by convict labor; condemning the sweat
ing system of making clothing, and pro
viding a union label for union-made
clothing; ordering a boycott against
Ehret's New York beer.
The local boycott against the Illinois
Zeitang was made general.
CHILEAN AFFAIRS.
The Inquiry Inro the Baltlmoi-o Inci
dent Nearly Concluded.
Nkw York, Dec. 16.—A Herald Val
paraiso special says: I have semi-official
information that Judge of Crimes Foster
■will conclude the inquiry into the Balti
more affair this week, and his report will
term the subject or consideration by the
Government immediately after President
Montt assumes oriice on December 26tli.
Judge Foster to-day handed in his re
port in the case of Patrick the
fireman of the American vossel K*wee
naw, who it is aliped was brutally
treated by Valparaiso police. The report
goes to the Procurator Fiscal for opinion
before the Judge pronounces judgment in
the case.
Balmaceda's Minister of War, Velas
quez, was released on bail to-day for ap
pearance belore the court when required.
This disposition of his case would seem
to remove the existence of any pood
reason why the refugees at the American
Legation should not be surrendered on
the same terms.
AN OMIJTOTJS SIGN*.
Sax Francisco, Dec. 16.—The Chron
icle will say to-morrow: The cruiser San
Francisco is lying at Maro Island, ready
to sail at a moment's notice, as soon
as orders are received from Washington,
and these are expected to arrive at any
moment. The vessel has been pro
visioned and equipped with arms and
ammunition to the fullest capacity.
These extreme preparations about
settle where the cruiser is going. The
provisions are sufficient to last for many
months, even if unable to obtain supplies
from shore. There is no country in the
world at present from which any dit'i
culties in obtaining fresh provisions
might be expected, except in Chile.
The additional fact that the cruiser is
carrying all the powder and ball possible
shows conclusively that it is to leave Un
its destination with every preparation for
war.

was as follows: The notorious slave
hunter Makatubo brought back 2,(X>O na
tives as a a result of his last expedition to
Karoma. The wretched people wero
chained in batches of a score. They were
?iving skeletons. Whilo the caravan was
traversing the Kirando country, where
there was a famine, the marching slaves
wero obliged, through hunger, to dig up
ami eat roots which animals refused to
eat.
Hundreds died of hunger, fever or
dysentery. A large number of women
{ and children, v\iu>se weakness impeded-
I the march, were drowned. Laggards
j through illness were killed with cudgels
at the rate of fifty daily. At night they
were Hhoitereri in rooriess huts, while the
goats uikea along wen; kept in covered
Kvery morning the bodies <»t*
thoso who died during the night were
dragged out and thrown to hyenas, which
followed the camp. Many poor creatnres
were covered with burns and sores as a
result of the punishment intlicted.
Similar accounts are given of cruelty
by other slave hunters. The missionaries
ransom slaves, placing the sick in tho
hospital -whenever possible.
FRANCE AND THE VATICAN.
The Popo's Opinion on the Prosecution
of the Archbishop of Ah.
Rome, Dee. 16.^-The Temps prints an
account of an interview with the Pope on
the French ecclesiastical question. Ac
cording to the account the Pope said his
aim was to encourage a policy of concilia
tion, and he; would have been better
pleased if the letter of the Archbishop of
Aix had been an isolated manifestation of
opinion. Ho was much affected by the
attacks mado upon the French pilgrims
in Kome, and, was pained to learn that
the pilgrimages of French Catholics was
stopped by ministerial orders. The*
French (Jovernment, he thought, erred in
prosecuting the Archbishop 01 Aix. Min
ister Fallieres ought simply to have writ
ten a trenchant reply. The prosecution
of the Archbishop, instead of promoting
peace between the Stale and church,
tended to cause enmity.
