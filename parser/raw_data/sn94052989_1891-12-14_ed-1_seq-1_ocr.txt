Michael Davltt Seriously Wounded — The
Parcel lite Crowd Bitterly De
nounced by O'Brien.
trrrlkl to The MoxN-ixa C*c.t
Dublin, Dec. 13.—Michael Davitf, tne
famous Irish leader, was seriously wounded
during a riot at Waterford City tc-day.
Davltt and William O'Brien had gone to
Waterford in support of the candidature of
Mr. Keine, the nominee of the McCarthy-
Ites for the seat in Parliament made vacant
by the death of Richard Power. Keane'a
opponent is Mr. Kedmoud, a member of the
Parnell wing of the Irish party. D.iviit
was strongly urged by the McCarthyites to
stand for Waterford, but he declined to do
so, and in consequence of his refusal Keane
was made the nominee. No particulars of
the affray in which D.ivitt was wounded
have as yet been received.
Later reports from Waterford show that
the riot this afternoon was one of the most
sanguinary and vicious of any of the politi
cal rows that have recently attended the
discussions in Irish towns of rival leaders.
Ominous rumors of an impending row had
been exciting the populace for some time,'
•nd a force of COO police had been drafted
liit > the town in hopes that their presence
would secure order.
The Parnellite leaders, Redmond. Leamy
and Dalton, had been in Waterfnrd some
days. This afternoon special trains brought
hundreds of the supporters of the rival can
didate?, and a series of contingents armed
with blackthorn shlllelahs marched through
the streets to the music of brass bands.
Davitt and others were also attended by a
band of music ami proceeded to the quarters
of the National Commercial Club.
En route a mob of Parnellite followers
began on* of the fiercest conflicts that has
characterized the prevailing hostilities.
Th« opposing crowds foucbt at very close
quarters and surged to and fro through the
street!!, utterly regardless of the preset. of
the police. \ olleys of stone* were hurled
through the air and blackthorns moved
with vicious celerity. A ereat many of the
rioters were taken to hospitals or to the
police station to receive surgical attention.
In the midst of the fray Davitt received a
nasty cut on the forehead, from which blood
flnwed freely. Tanner ami others were in
jured by stones. At last the police formed
a cordon and divided the opposing mobs
and the Davitt crowd reached the club
rooms.
The police were entirely unable to quell
the contest The respective bands had
horns twisted and drums torn into shreds.
Constant skirmishes continued until the
Davitt crowds reached their rendezvous.
After Davilt's wound were dressed he ap
peared at the window of the club-house and
spoke briefly. Mr. Redmond upon hearing
of the affair drove to Davitt's hotel and left
» note expressing regret for what haJ oc
curred.
O'Brien mr.d« the speech of the day,
bitterly denouncing "the assault" upon n'9 '
friend* and saying that the crowds who In
jured Davltt had struck a glorious blow for
the Irish cause. Davitt's answer to that
blow was that now he was a candidate for
Waterford. O'Brien in conclusion accused
the police of using their batons more in
favor of the attacking mob than otherwise.
The police, he asserted, protected the
Parnellites while the force of their blows
was devoted to the McCartbyltes.

BALMACEDA'S BtTUAVAL.
He Owed His Downfall to the Treachery of
the Argentine Sinister.
Seattle, Dec. is.— A special to the P.ist-
Intellieencer from Port Townsend, Wash.,
•ays that J.'Perkins Shanks, an American
engineer, who for the past twenty-two years
has resided in Chile, and who arrived
here a few dtty-s ago, tells this story of
how Ba'maceda was betrayed. He said:
"Baluiarela was bstraved by the Argen
tln» Minister. Senor Uribirru, in San
tiago, in this manner: When Bai
rn iced a sent his Minister to request
the hospitality of Senor Uribirru to
shelter him against tho attack of the in
surgents, it was agreed that Balnia<eda
ahoulJarriveat the Argentine Legation a.
4 o'clock in the morning. When he arrived
he was met by the Senor, and, on enter
ing, he met face to fare the wife
of his most bitter enemy, Mr«. Carlos
Wa!k>r-M;irt:ne7, who had taken refuge in
the same Legation, fraring an attempt on
tier life ou the part of the Bahnacedans.
Grrat confusion followed the rneetiugand the
lady »a> compelled to take a solemn oath
not to divulge the whereabouts of Balrrm
ceda. But she entered into an intrigue with
the Argentine Minister to betray BalinnCfda
to George Montt. Word was sent notify
ing Montt of Balniaceda's bidiug-placa.
Montt immediately took stt-pa to indu-e
the ex-Dictator to surrender himself peace
fully to the newly constituted authorities,
promising every guarantee of fair and just
trial, bulmaceda agreed to surrender after
the holidays. Fmm the day that Balmaceda
received the first word from Montt he
commenced preparing for death and began
writing in-tructions dispo^inz of all of his
personal affairs, and when the time arrived
for him to surrender he killed himself,
knowing he could not receive justice."

Views of Prominent English and American
Lawyeri—Miss MitcheU'a Wedding.
Pakis, Dec. 13.—Several prominent En
glish and American lawyers nave recently
been interviewed on the subject of Interna
tional marriages. Henry diehard paid:
"The general opinion that sue!) marriages are
mere exchanges of money for social positiou
Is a mistake. The unions sometimes originate
in »elfish motives, but are mostly due to af
fection."
A legal adviser of the United States Con
sul said: '"In a majority of cas»a the for
tunes of American ladies are in trust and so
tied up that the incomes alone can be
touched. Marriage with them therefore is
■circely a bait to men whose sole object is
money. The ladies are, to a certain degree,
attracted by the glitter of a coronet."

CHILEAN DISAPPOINTMENT.
Official Circle Displeased at tbo Tone of
the President's Message.
/
London*, Dec. 13.—A Santiago dispatch
to the Times says: President narrison's
message has had the effect of a bombshell.
It is regarded in offidal circles as a breach
of diplomatic usage. The Foreign Office has
sent to all Chilean Legations for public lion
a circular reflecting official and public opin
ion on the subject. The Oifieial Gazette
publishes notes exchanged between the
Chilean Government and Minister Egan.
These corroborate the declarations con
tained in the circular sent the Chilean
leg.dions. It appears tl.nt the Foreign
Office asked Er.an on November 9th to sup
ply the proffered testimony to substantiate
the gravo charges again>t Chilean officials.
Months of delay in complying with fun re
quest prevented President Harrison from a
knowledge of the result of the inquiry into
th« Baltimore affair, a knowledge ol which,
it Is believed, would have altered tbe mes-
SRge entirely.

Lltile Congressional Legislation Expected

Preparing the House Committees.
Epccln: to Tin HnKN'i.is Calc.
Washington, Dec. 13.—1t is ui'derstood
that reciprocity negotiations with the sugar
producmg colonies o[ Great Britain in the
West Indies, authorized by Section 3 of the
McKinley Hill, have reached a satisfactory
conclusion in every case except that of
Jamaica.
The conditions agreed upon involve the
Interests of Trinidad and Barbadoes, to
gether with those of Denivrara and British
Guiana.
Id the case of Jamacin, it is believed that
the only difficulty in the way of reacting ait
agreement is presented by the amount of
revenue which that colony is asked to re
linquish and which its representatives here
are understood to declare is iniji ■ssifolo
to sacrifice without impairing the credit of
the colony, which is pledged to secure rail
way boud.s guaranteed by the Government
and held to a large extent in this countiy.
The United States seven years ago made
the same offer us now in regard to the re
moval of sugar duties. England would then
have none of it on the ground that such an
arrangement would contravene blitish free
tride ideas. The colouisls cannot fail to be
delighted, and their dissatisfaction with
their English ruler*, increased by what oc
curred seven years ago. will be replaced by

CONGKKSSIONALj AVOKK.
Very Little Legislation CcntemDlated Pre
vious to the Holiday Recess.
Washington', Dec. 13.—50 far as actual
legislation busings fa concerned, prob
ably the present week in Congress
will be devoid of interest. It has
come to bo generally understood that,
while the time before the holiday recess in
the long session may be employed in per
fecting the organization of the two branches
of Congress, little can be attempted with
profit in the line of legislation. Many Sena
tors and preservatives, assuming that the
recess will begin before the end of the
week, have already made arrangements to
leave Washington in a few days.
Unless unforsem difficulties are en
countered, the reorganize lon of committees
will be completed on Monday or Tuesday;
but there is no expectation that they will
undertake any Important work daring the
week. The introduction of bills and reso
lutions were presented in a rush last «eek.
A speech l>y Senator Turpte on the subject
of ihe election of Senator by a direct vote of
the people and one by Senator Stewart on
free silver coinage, together nith such re
sponses as they may elicit, will probably
compose the record of the week in the Sen
ate.
. i lie Douse does not meet until Wednes
day, and after a brief session will probably
adjourn with nn understanding that on the
day ol reas>emblas« it will adjourn fur the
customary Christmas recess. A proposition
has been broached that Congress adjourn
on Friday, the 18lh injt., to Monday. Jan
uary .4th. It is believed that In the absence
of the Committee, on Organization nothing
can be accomplished by continuing the
nominal sessions of the liuuse into the fol
lowing week before taking the usual recess.
Tin- Speaker lias been Industriously en
gaged in work preliminary to the appoint
ment of committees, but the experience of
the past variants the belie! that it will be
found impracticable, in consult them in liuio
for htinounci'n before the New Year.
TheCommitieson Kules may be imnoiinred

fifty-second House, and submit them lor con

President Williams of the Chicago Club,
however, arrived here last night, and in an

openrd their eyes to the game being worked
The scheme provided for the retirement of

of Louisville and St. Louis to the league
circuit. St. Louis wai to have the privi
lege of charging 25 rents admission and

with a Press reporter Air. Williams said:
"The Chicago club did not join the associa
tion to be d lopped in two months. We huvo
ample fund* and, if necessary, can stand an
extra assessment. We do not propose to
get out, and 1 do not ice bow we can be
forced out. All talk about amalgamation be
ta ei-n organizations is bosh. If they did
amalgamate another association would
sprint; up. 1 think when the members of
the association get together you will rind
other clubs against the proposed amalga

professional and scientific . standpoint the
contest was a success. The battle was re
markable for fairness. Not a call of "foul*

an angry word exchanged by the contes

closed and one cheek laid open, llowsoii,
while quick as a cat, was handicapped by
his inability to hit hard, and too much
train inn. Ryan displayed good ge< eralshli.

TO DBBTKOX LIFE.
A Hcvel Gnn That Shoots One Thousand
Times a Hinnte.
New Haven (C. nn.). Dec. 13.—ForabiUt
a year experiments have been made by tlm
Winchester Kepealinc-arms Company In
this city with a machine gun, which In
many respects is a marvel. Its prin
cipal feature is its rapidity to fire. Dur
ing a recent t.-st, 900 shots were fired
in one minute through one barrel. The oily
guns approaching this rapidity of lire is the
Maxim machine gun, with a record of ISO
shots a minute. The new gun has a water
jacket surrounding the birrel, which holds
one gallon of water. That amount of water
is orated in one minute when the gun
is In operation. In the experiments made
without water the Jacket of the frugal
would become too hoi for safety in less til»n
half a minute. The breech mechanism is
O| emted by a crank.
Connected with the system are multiply
in? tre.irs, by means of which the rapidity of
motion is obtained. The ammunition is fed
Into the breech from a continuous n>b belt
holding the cartridge* in pockets. Tim ex
ploded shells, as tiiey are thrown from
the breech, rise about two feet • over
the gun, and fall in what appears
to be a beautifully curved bar of burnished
brass. The gun is thn invention of the
Brownlne Bros., gun-makers, in Ogden
Utah. The model experimented with is of
45 caliber. The comp is not ready to
put the «:un on the market, and everything
concerning it is guarded with jealous cure.

THE PAPAL QUESTION.
Exchange of Explicit Declarations Between
France and the Vatican. *
London, Dec. 13.—The Standard's Rome
Correspondence says: Explicit declarations
have passed between France and the Vati
can with a view of promoting cordial rela
tions between that Government and the
Papal See. On the part of France it was
stated that the movement did not desire to
attack the Pope, but the question of inter
nal order constrained the Government to
maintain its own authority. To this Hie
Vatican replied that it did not desire to
foment rebellion mid had advised the
Bishops to be prudent, but did not impose a
certain line of conduct, in regard to such a
delicate question.
The Clironicle's Rome correspondence
says: The Poue Ims sent copies of an allo
cXfon which he will read at to-morrow's
consistory to all the chancellories of Eu
ro ie. li will declare that the law of guar
antees is not S'ltlicient to guarantee the lib

Government to defend the countiy ag.iiust
both radicalism aud reaction, and radical
journals reproach the Government for divid

dcs Deoats and Figaro recommend a policy
of conciliation. Tiie Temps says every sin

Government will not hesitate to resort to
force should the action of the Bishops again
imperil tho tranquillity of the country.

THEY WILL DISBAND.
I The Grand Jnry to Make Its
Final Report on Tuesday.
A Difference at to Whether Certain Evidence
Should Be Made Public-The Grand
Jurors Disappointed.
The decision of the Supreme Court de
claring the Grand Jury impaneled by Judge
Wallace an illegal body and invalidating all
Indictments made by that body against
Buckley, Keily, Bruner and others, and
nullifying the proceedinzs bi-euu for the
removal of City and County Attorney
Durst, formed the chief topic of conversa
tion in all circles yesterday.
The* decision makes the situation a very
strange one. The Grand Jury impaneled
by Judge Wallace has been declared to have
been invalidly selected. Still, Judge Wal
lace remains Presiding Judge of tne Su
perior Court, and will so remain until Janu
ary Ist. What Judge Wallace will do is not
known as he tins declined to express him
self on tlie situation on account of the deli
cate position he occupies, the Supreme
Court being his superior cfiioer as it were,
and tho lower court being compelled to
follow its decisions. On January l<t the
twelve Judges of the Superior Court will
meet and elect a new Presiding Judge.
WALLACE'S SUCCESSOR.
It is now generally known that Judge
Wallace will not be selected t<> succeed him
self, but that tne u<ual rule of rotation will
be followed ti 11 <j the honor given to another
Judge, Judge Slack being believed to have
the greatest claim for the place. After the
selection of a new Presiding Judge, it is
6aid each Judge will again place twelve
names in the jury-box and the usual modo
of selection without the aid of an elisor will
be followed, and thus all taint of illegality
will be removed.
The members of the Grand Jury from the
foreman, Barclay Henley, to tje guardian
of th« inner door and main Inquisitor, Dr.
Cleveland, are much disappointed at tho in
terruption in ihc-ir work.
From a number of Interviews held yester
day with members of tlio Invalidated Grand
Jury, it was discovered that, although dis
appointment is the general feeling, yet a
majority of them think that they have not
worked in vain.
A HEALTHY SENTIMENT.
They expressed tiie belief that the jury
had worked un a strong, healtliy sentiment
against boodle and political criminals, and
that this sentiment wnuld not die with the
luvalidating of the Grand Juiy. T.ie jurors
stated that after being impaneled they had
been much bannered oy legal ditlicultitis,
first by the Chute case and Juugu Murphy's
decision, and secondly by the Bruner
application lor » writ of prohibition.
They had but six weeks' work to
themselves, and during this time they
had to do without Congiderabla prom
ised evidence, which would have been given
had ti.e jury been sustained. It Is said
that over twenty prominent witnesses had
agreed to testify providing the Grand Jury
was sustained, and that the members ol the
Grand Jury had to accede to that condi
tion.
The Grand Jury will meet on Tuesday as
usual at 3 o'clock. The course to be pur
sued will not be known until the body gets
together. From a canvass made of the
jury it was learned that all are in favor of
at once disbanding and bowing to the de
cree of tiie Supreme Court, They see no
other course open.
ACCUMULATED EVIDENCE.
The only difference will be in the nature
of the report to Judge Wallace when the
jury disbands. It is known that some sort
of report will be filed, but it is not known
whether it will include some of the work of
the juiy not yet made public.
The jury during its existence accumu
lated quite a mass of testimony which I
would not be used without further corrobo
ratiou and investigation. There is a propo
sition to Incorporate this evidence in the
final report of the defunct jury. This
proposition is liable to meet with some op-
Dositiou on the gr< und that the evidence
should ha turned over to the succeeding
Grand Jury.
The ueueral belief was expressed that the
Grand Jury had found a number of indict
ments which were locked up in the pandora
box and hermetically sealed, but it was pos
itively stated by one in a position to know
yesterday that every indictment that had
been found had been filed, the box only con
taining eollerted evidence which had not
been formulated into distinct charges.
BAM ItAINKY.
A rumor was in circulation yesterday that
Sain liainey, Buckley's chief assistant, was
in town, and some politicians mated that
they had seen him. An investi
gation showed that there was no
foundation lor the report, although it was
learned tluxt tlie statements made about
liainey being in Chicago, Ireland and in the
South have all been false. The fact is,
Kainey has Dccii in the State for over three
weeks, and this was known by several of
his friends.
A prominent member of the Fire Depart
ment staled last night that Mrs. Kaiuey
came to him tlireo weeks ago and informed
him that her husband was on his ranch at
Livermore looking out for a fine new build
ing which he is having erected. The samo
official stated that Kainey has been there
ever since.
HOMEWARD BOUND.
Chris Buckley Reported on His Way to
San Frincisco.
Montreal, Dec. 13. — Christopher A.
Buckley of San Francisco, who has been a
resident lit-ro since the Ist of October, left
for home last night. His departure was
due t'i tile action of the Supreme Court in
declaring the Gr.tnd Jury which indicted
him illegally constituted.
A BAKBEK'S REVENGE.
The « ;i> in 'Which a Beat Wm Forced
to Settle His Score.
A well-dressed yuung man entered the
baiber-shop ol the I'alace on Saturday and
ordered his hair tiinn ,cil, a shampoo,
shave, sline and i\ bath. All of his re
quests were complied with, and when he
had thoroughly completed the pntronage of
the place, he took up his hat and started
for the door.
lie was cordially Invited to settle his
scon 1, but his only reply was to quicken
his gait from a rapid walk to a run. He
was purMied by the barber and by one or
two attaches ol the hotel, but the beat was
bo tlt-et of fool and had evidently prepared
himself for such experiences to such good
purpose, that he wns not overtaken until he
bad reached Bush street.
Here he was overhauled by the barber
whom he brd attempted to swindle and
with the lutter's grip on the back of hl9
coat-cnllar, was inarched back icnouiini
ously to the hotel. Every few steps, the
barber etiipha>ized his feelings by a vigorous
kick, and when he had returned to the
barber-shop, cave him au old-fashioned
thumping.
The fellow offered no resistance to the
violent attack, nor did he attempt to re
taliftle. Wheii his captor was tired ol his
vengeance, the beat was turned out and de
parted apparently well satisfied that his
obligation to the shop bad been discharged
iv this novel m.inner.

DESPERATE AS RATS.
A ('him so Highbinder Tries to
Shoot a Policeman.
So Btrict is tho watch kept by the Cblna
tnwn police force, particularly by Sergeant
Burke and posse, ou the highbinder element
in that unsavory section o( the city, that the
hatchet ana pistol men of the different
" tongs "fiud it most difficult to earn their
nefarious livliluod by their usual methods
(if blackmail, nud are becoming as desperate
as cornered rats. As a general rule the
biggest fighter of the highbinder fraternity
so far lias weakened lite a wet sponge
when a pi.lie« officer laid his hundson him
i\n<l put him under arrest. Now, however,
the highbinders are much more desperately
boh!, nnd even in their extremity do Dot
hesitato to attempt to kill a police officer
when there is no other chuncn of eteape.
Last night about 7 o'clock Officers Gibaoa
and Murphy of the Chinatown squad at*
three well-kunwn highbtudera enter* Chi
nese house of bad repute on Church alley,
and suspecting that trouble might ensue,
followed the trio in.
There they found that the de»per*doe.i
had attempted to blnckuiail the proprietor
under threats of taking his life. Uffloer
Gibson nt once grabbed Ah F.y, a thorough
example of the worst specimen of high
binder yilbiny, ami placed him under ar
rest. Foy quickly drew a large new Colt'»
4.Vcnllber pistol, with all the chamber*
loaded, and throwing it around over bis
right shoulder, tried to bring it to be»r oa
trie officer. Nut waiting to draw either his
pistol or his club, Gibson, retiring to get
momentum, landed Fny a blow with. hi»
right list between the eyes that simply par
alyzed the Mongol and sent him to the floor
in a comatose condition.
Officer Murphy quickly came to Glbson't
assistance and in a trico tho three high
binders were handcuffed and taken to the
Central Station.
Foy was charged with carrying a con
cealed weapon and assault with a deadly
weapon. New Colt's revolvers similar to
the one Foy tried to shoot Officer Gibson
with were found on the two others whogave
the names of Ah Sii;g and Hing Hang.
They were charged with carrying concealed
weapons and vagrancy.
The uext highbinder that even makes a
motion to pull a deadly weapon on any of
the Cliinatoun squad officers, will have an
excellent opportunity afforded him U
occupy blab Bat the .Morgue.
NEARLY A MURDER.
Terrible Fight Between Sailors
on the Front.
The handy manner in which a sailor can
use a knife was clearly shown about 6:30
o'clock last night, when Peter Marando and
Manuel Desivey got iuto a row In the
saloon at 12 Commercial street, near East.
The men quarreled over a card game, and
Manuel called Peter a liar. Peter denied
the allegation, and to prove he was light
sailed into Manuel In a lively manner. It
was a ime in which Peter found bis oppo
nent a regular John L. Sullivan, and ha
was getting the worst of the brittle, when la
order to ev.-n things up he changed his
tactics and drew a murderous-looking carv
iug-knife with a blade at least ten locoes
long and proceeded to carve Dssivoy.
Be slashed him over the head and face la
a terrible manner. Dusivey fought for his
life, and succeeded in wresting the knits
