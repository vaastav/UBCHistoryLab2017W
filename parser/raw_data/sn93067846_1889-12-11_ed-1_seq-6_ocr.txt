WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER ll.
Tne President's Messag?
The annual message of President
Harrison, which was seat to the two
houses of the U. S. Congress last week
is summarized by the National Demo?
crat of Washington, D. C;, as follows :
When the Republicans nominated
Benjam?n Harrison for President iu
1888 they selected bim largely for the
reason that iu the whole record of what
he had said and done in public life there
was almost nothing which was offensive
to any member of the party-coothing
that was likely to drive away Republi?
can votes. The message which he sent
to Congress on Tuesday is character?
istic of the man who had such a safe
record in 1888. It is the message of a
timid, cautious, cunning politician, who
follows his party r.od does not load it,
and who hopes to stay in the White
House for eight years by pursuing the
same non assertive, non-committal
coarse which bas served him so well in
the past.
Mr. Harrison's message is a message
of skips and dodges, of party echoes and
half-way recommendations. He says he
has not had time to examine Mr. Win?
dora'4 silver bullion certificate scheme,
although during the past three weeks
he has been able to devote three days to
duck shooting in Mary laud. His
strongest argument is iu favor of steam?
ship subsidies, but even here he might
have been far more d finite than he is
He advocates federal appropriations for
common schools in the States, but in a
form which the advocates of the Blair
bill must find wholly unsatisfactory.
He evideotly does not dare to indulge
in bole! advocacy of the scheme for
taking the control of Congressional j
elections out of the hands of the State
authorities and merely talks about ex?
tending the present system of 'Super?
vision " To the solution of the tariff
problem he contributed absolutely ootb- j
ing of value He will sign any meas-j
ure that his party friends in Congress j
may send to bim and to them he leaves !
the whole busiuess for settlement So, j
foo, in the matter of pension legislation
his remarks are quite general. He
wants more done for the needy veterans,
but he makes no suggestions as to de?
tails. His* remarks concerning the
civil service law are noteworthy chiefly
for his effort to relieve himself of res?
ponsibility for the utter ignoring of all
civil ser trice principles which character?
ized the grand rout of the railway mail ] i
service \>y the Republican politicians io j i
March and April last.
Everything of real importance which
he has to say could have been compress- i
ed into & quarter of a column of this c
paper, but he occupies nearly two of t
our pages in saying it. We publish jj
the document as a part of the political j 1
annals of the time, but we shall not J ?
often give up so much space to such un- j i
inter es ti cg matter. 1
What Mr. Harrison might bare ven
tured to say if bis party had not been ? i
defeated in many of its strongholds | 1
only a month ago it is useless to speen- i
late about. What is clear is that con- j <
cerniog the groot interests of the people j i
he has very little of value to say, and
he says it voluminously.
The N. Y. Times says: "No other
motive than fear could have restrained
the President from making clear and j <
specific recommendations of tariff re- j i
visio?. He knows that men who voted j (
for him and sp^nt their money for his j t
electron"are now demanding relief from 1 ?
the exactions of the tariff laws, and he j t
knows that the industries of the coun- j 1
* try fleed :he relief.'* . i f
The Wilmington. N. C. Messenger j t
says: Mr. Harrison has placed himself j i
in a position that he hopes no doubt i s
will enable him to change with the 1
course of his party io the Congress
ti their anion should lead to the re- ! (
duct ion of the war tariff of 47 10 per j i
cent, he will say that he foreshadowed > 1
that in his message when he ?poke of J <
revising "the schedules " Ile will ! s
make revision and reduction synooy- ! 1
moos in his present vocabulary. But i 1
if the radical protectionists bold their j 1
grip and succeed in retaining the old ! ;
war tax he wtii be ready :o poiut to his j 1
message and say, I did not favor re
form beyond smoothing inequalities, j
and did not ?>ay a word of reducing the j i
47 10 average, nor did I lower the 1
claims of the protectionists, but really
proposed extending the priucitile. Did .
I not say : "The inequalities of the j ,
law should be adjusted but the protec- j
tive principle should be maintained and J
fairly appiied to the products of OUT j ;
farms as well as of our shops n * * * ;
He talks of the tariff iu one place and ?
two columns removed he lug? in a brief
paragraph concerning the dangerous j
and ruinous and vile trusts. But for
the tariff these trusts would uot and j
could not exi*t and prosper. j

A Potttftowu. Pa , dispatch says that j
last Fuday morning John Chana, a!
hopeless paralytic, age! S5, wag found !
dead on the fl cr of his hotel wi:|? a i
leather strap loosely fastened around j
his neck. Some maintain that it was
fuicide. while others thar it was f,;iii |
play, though suicide is the generally]
accepted theory. (Tnn! recently Chana j
was a fine specimen of physical mau-'
hood. It is related that (?ne day he ?
cursed his Creator in a most horrible
manner, when he fell over, stricken j
dumb and paralyzed ir??ni h-ad ti? foot \
He remaiucd in this condition until hi? \
death.
Mr. F M Rogers. Jr., nf Florence, j
writes the Department of Agriculture !
that he has sold 18.000 pounds of h.* j
this year's crop, and ail at good prices ; I
that all cn that vicinity who raised to- j
bacoo have been able to sell it at good ;
pricer, and last, but not {east, that in
the vii?njw of Florence a"o/.e 1,2001
acres of tobacco will he planted the com i
ing year. As the tobacco acreage of.
the eutire isate f?r this year was but
635 acres, the importance of the fact j
that it is to be doubled ne xt y ear iu
one County alone will easily be seen.

There was great excitement in ,'
Washington City last, week over the ;
discovery of the ?ighl of the cashier of
the Sergeant a* Arms of the House of
Representative*, with a large auroa nt
nf toon ey which he had drawn from
the Treasury, about ?7*J 00"@ ; it i>
supposed be is iu Canada, and tnat pos :
ebly the character of the steal is puch
that be cannot be extradited. Further j
examination shows that Silcott, the !
Washington thief, carried off about j
$12 OOO bel?ngin? to several members
of the House of Representatives, anti
that attogetber Ute ?teal will fvol up
$100,09*.
Sensitive People.
The News has made reference to the
blubbering boy who afflicts all boy's
schools ; we suppose the case is the
same to girl's schools. Wherever there
is a type of man there is a type of
woman to match him-though, fortu?
nately for the world, the representa?
tives of the types rarely marry each
other-and no doubt there is a kind of
girl to match e^ery kind of a boy, good,
bad and indifferent, endurable, unen?
durable and average.
Whether the blubbering boy and the
sniffling girl grow up to be sensitive
men and women, we really do not
know; but it is a fact that there are
such men and women and that on occa?
sions, and oftentimes without occasions,
they succeed in being most particularly
unpleasant. Their feelings are ever?
lastingly getting in somebody's way
They are perambulating man traps per?
petually set and ready to catch some
unhappy and innocent individual in es?
pecially tight and uncomfortable places
Their tears start at the slightest acci?
dental touch and quench wich freezing
moisture the most brilliant pleasures:
their dismal looks slide simultaneously
along the moral spines of each member
of the happiest assemblages and chill
the genial currrent of their fun like so
much ice ; they hang out signals of dis?
tress and displays of woe when seas and
skies are sunniest and in an instant
throw over everything an impalpable
cloud, not seen but felt, and changing
the atmosphere from warmth and bright?
ness to discomf ?rt and twilight. All of
us have known and suffered from them
and have debated whether to be the
more sympathetic for themselves or our?
selves.
It is about a toss up whether the un?
duly sensitive or the unnaturally cal?
lous is the more unfortunate. We can
pity the first, but for the other there
can be only contempt. No human be?
ing is born into this world with the
toughness of moral 6bre we sometimes
encounter It is acquired depravity,
attained only by stifling all the feelings
that entitle manhood and womanhood to
respect. But even the pushing, br:.zen,
unabashed subject whom no rebuke or
rebuff can reach is less likely to cause
trouble to others than the unduly sen?
sitive. On an adamantine cheek we j
ian at least exercise the luxury of an- J
ger and spend our wrath with our
?frength in vain efforts to bruise if.
But with the over-sensitive there is no j
relief. The more our anger rises the j
more brutal we become in <>ur own ?
?yes We may be-swollen to the burst?
ing point with resentment that offence
las been taken where aeoe was meant, j
hat the word sent out to evoke a smile
>r fill a conversational gap has brought |
jpon us a flood of unwelcome salt water I
>r a cool gust of sighs, but there is no i
.emedy. Indeed we, who are the iu
ured. are forced into the position of
brutal aggressor and compelled, much
igainst our wills and grains, to trickle
orth amiability and consolation wheo
ire long to thunder maledictions.
It is a hard thing to say, bat we fear j
t ts the truth that excessive sensitive- I
less, like excessive awkwardness and j
>at>hfu'ine88, is the product of excessive j
?gotism. The sore points always held j
n the way of all passers by are usually j
jroduced by too much rubbing of the j
uind against its owner's personality. I
The people who find a slight or an in- j
?ult or a wound in every word and act
>f their fellows are really affected by
?n ex tggerated sense of the importance
)f thetnselves and their affairs. They
each themselves to crave more cou- ]
^deration than they are fairly eutitled j
:o aod to exaggerate the place they j
lold in the thoughts of others. Con?
sequently they s?ize and stick into j
heti.selves ali the arrows they car. S:id
n the air, meant to be harmless er
limed at somtbDQy else, or manufacture j
"rom the most iooocent of pellets
There is a natur tl and proper degree !
)f sensitiveness which recognizes aud
o ?
.esents an insult, rebuff or iusolence.
[t ts an instinct and is best governed by
;Ommon sense The only cure for over
<ensitiveness is the cultivation of
modesty and generosity-thinking less
>f ourselves and more of other people, I
reducing our estimates of our own merits ;
ind deserts and increasing our disDost j
tiou to think charitably of th^ purposes j
and dispositions of others. The people j
who are really unselfish, whose purpose j
io life is to promote the pleasure and ?
welfare of others, and who are ready to j
give to others all they are entitled to |
and always a little over to be sure of
good mesure, nre the happiest af*er all |
that ts done and sa>d. They are never '.
found among the over-sensitive; they j
are rarely afflicted ty the slings and a - j
rows of their friends because they do not i
hold up their vanities to be shot at i
TiK-y do not invite a?au!t and, cooee ?
quentiy, hardly ever receive it ; they do !
not assume that all their acquaintances {
are malicious or envious and, th refore,
do not twist everything they see or hear !
into cause of offence. j

vo ;AL TRAINING.
Something About tho Teaching of Little
Children to Si HR.
Two questions in connection with the
training of the voice are to be discussed,
viz.: VVhen it should be commenced and
whether it should be interrupted during
the so called "cracking" period. With
regard to tho first of these questions I
am strongly of opinion that training can
hardly bo begun too early. Of course,
the kind and amount of practice that are
necessary in the adult would be mon?
strous in a young child, but there is no
reason why, even at the age of 6 or 7,
the right method of voice production
should not be taught.
Singing, like any other art, is chiefly
learned by imitation, and it seems a pity
to lose the advantage of those precious
early years when that faculty is most
highly developed. There is no fear of
injuring the larynx or straining the
voice by elementary instruction of this
kind. On the contrary, it is habitual
faulty vocalization which is pernicious.
The sooner the right way of Using the
*oice is taught the more easy will it be
to guard against the contraction of bad
habits, which can only be corrected at a
later period with infinite trouble.
Many of the finest voices have beejj
trained almost from the cradle, so to
speak. I need only to mention Adelina
Patti, Christine Nilsson, Jenny Lind and
Mme. Albani. but there are numbers of
other queens of song who owe a great
part of their success to the same cause.
As for the other point, 1 am still an ob?
stinate dissenter from the "orthodox"
teaching of singing masters on the sub?
ject.
I have already more than once ex?
pressed my l>elief that there is no reason
why training, within certain limits and
under strict supervision by a competent
person, should not be carried on when
the voice is in the transition stage of its
development from childhood to adoles?
cence.
The steck argument, invariably ad?
vanced to prove the necessity of suspend?
ing the education of the voice till it has
passed through the "breaking" period, is
that, as the parts are undergoing active
changes, they therefore require complete
rest. This would equally apply to the
limbs, and, in some degree, also to the
brain. Yet I am not aware that it has
ever been proposed to forbid growing
lads from exercising their bodies, even
in games involving considerable muscu?
lar violence, orto interrupt the education
of the mental powers till the brain has
become fully formed. Over pressure
there may be, no doubt, in voice training
as in other kinds of instruction.
All voices are not capable of bearing
the same amount of training. . Each case
must be dealt with according to what the
doctors call the particular "indications"
that may arise. My thesis holds good
only as a rule, to which t?tere may he
many individual exceptions. A judicious
teacher will, however, have no difficulty
in deciding as to the best course to adopt
in any given instance.-Sir Morell Mac?
kenzie in Contemporary Review.
