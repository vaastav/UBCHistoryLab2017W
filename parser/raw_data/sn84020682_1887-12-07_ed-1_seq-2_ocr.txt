WED'DAY MORNING. DEC. 7, 1SS7.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
We lay before our readers to-daj
the able message of the President of
the United States communicated to
Congress yesterday, li is devoted
especially to the revenues of the
government, and urges in unmis
takable and clearest language not
only the necessity but the urgent
demand of reduction, and readjust
ment. In this Mr. Cleveland is fully
abreast with the sentiments and in
terests of the people. His reminder
that both the leading parties are
committed to a reduction is felici
tous. We regret that he does ,not in
elude in his recommendation either
a repeal or modification of the in
ternal rerenue laws. The articles
of taxation involved in these laws
seem to overshadow the onerous,
oppressive, inquisitorial and offen
sive features of the methods of the
system of taxation. If this cannot
be repealed as we think it ought to
be, it certainly should be greatly
modified in'.its operation, and the
rate of taxation so reduced as to
fre it from its monopolistic tenden
cies. How Congress can avoid heeding
the counsel of the President upon
the matter of tariff reduction we
cannot see; and should it do so, wo
believe the people, will hold the
delinquent members thereof to n
fearful responsibility.
It is a sound, irresistible paper,
and must produce a strong effrct
upon Congress and the country.
Speaking of editorial duty to speak
f lankly and honestly to the public
when called on to speak un
pleasant truth?, the Charleston Sun
says:
"Honesty, frankness and fair play
are essentialsot journalism as the hot
policy in the end. Fearless tuith
telling and faithful warning must
prevail against demagogy and slavish
tickling of the public ear People
may be made unjust by the irritation
resulting from unwelcome truths,
and passion and prejudice may lead
them to efforts to injure and punish
a faithful friend; but the natural
appreciation of truth will triumph
alter a time and the newspaper that
by its enterprise and honesty de
serves public support will receive it.
A newspaper should not be re
garded as fhe thing of a day. It is
intended to live and stay, to be per
manent enduring, an institution I
its community, a powerful factor in
the conduct of affairs and in expres
sing and moulding the character ot
the people among whom and for
whom it is published. It cannot
afford to stain its life or to weaken
its character by yielding its opinions
or principles or shrinking from it
duty inobeJience to temporary out
bnrsts ot public feeling or lor fear of
resentments or assaults."
ANOTHER RACKET OPEN
ING. Talk about Openings, we have them,
not annually, semi-aniiuall v or

Astonishing Success.
It is the duty of every person who has
used Boschec's German Syrup to let its
wonderful qualities be known to their
friends in curing Consumption, severe
Coughs, Croup, Asthma, Pneumonia, and
in fact all throat and lung diseases. No
person can use it without immediate
relief. Three doses will relieve sny case,
and we consider it the duty of alt Drug
gists to recommend it to the poor, dying
consumptive, at ler.st to try one bottle,
aa SO,OUi dozen bottles were sold last
vear, and no ouo case where it failed wivs
reported. Such a medicine as the German
Syrup eannnt be too widely known. Ask
y'ourdrmrijistabout it. Sample bottles to
ti v, R shf at 10 cents. Regular size 75
cunts. Sold by all Druggists and Dealers,
ir. the United Status and Canada.

A strange atmospheric phenome
noii occurred at Maysville, Ky., and
at Manchester, Ohio, on Saturday
afternoon. The sun all the morning
looked like a ball ot lire. At 3.-?o
p.m. a dense cloud suddenly lowered
upon the two towns, and five min
utes later it was as dai k as night.
People became frightened and busi
ness was entirely suspended. Many
of the superstitious thought the end
had come, and began praying A
number of merchants hastened home
from their stores. Chickens went
to roost and cows went home to be
milked. In the midst of the con
fii'ion a heavy snow-storm set in,
and when daylight returned, fifteen
minutes later, the ground was white.
The same phenomenon occurred at
Vv ashington Courthouse, (Jh:o.
