mensur.itu with the importance of the
nation and the extent of our coast line
'I admirable report of Secretary Whit
ney on the needs of the navy murks an
epoch in the dreary line of incnmpi'tcnl
olllcials at the head of that department
It is the work of n man of ability , character -
actor and courage , and will at once ill' '
.spiro conlidcnce that whatever money *
may be appropriate ! for naval reorganl'
zation will bo applied for the purpose.-
for which they are intended. Mr. Whit
ney him worked laboriously in probing tu
the bottom tiio defects of the naval de
partment and he presents his result-
fairly und emphatically with the clear
ness of a practical hiisineKs man nnd the
conciseness of a lawyer's brief to court.
The secretary's tlicoiy of the proper or
ganization u ( the department is bimple
and orderly. He tinds the cause of
of the past wastefulness In the service to
1)0 1 in proper and eonllictinir organiza
tions. Ho proposes to have his olliee di
vided into three principal departments.
He wishes one sot of experts to buy tlio
materials to bo utilised by the navy.
They must bo judge * of the prices as well
as of the qualities of the supplies.
Another .set of experts are desired to car
ry on the constructive work of the ser
vice. They must bo exports in the busi
ness of making and repairing ships and
guns , and all that belongs to them. The
third department will direct the move
ments of bhips , Heels , and the thousands
of ollicor ? . and men employed on tlit-in.
Those three bureaus are to take the place
of the many which at present c.xiitand
the accounts of each are to bo kept just
as a pralical and common sense business
man would keep the books of a great es
tablishment and its diU'erent depart
ments. Mr. Whitney asks that congress
shall reorganize the naval department
before rcorgani/.ing the navul establish
ment. Ho then promises the best results
from the expenditure of whatever ap-
pronriations may bo made for rebuilding
tlio navy.
I'arnoll'fj Triumph.
The Knglish elections nro over and the
result is n practictil triumph for P.irnoll.
Ncillar ot tuo great English parlies has
u working majority over the other and
the 1'arnellites combined. The national
ist campaign lias resulted ifs iU l.-uder
decreed , and the uncrowned king o. ' Ire
land will como to Westminster backed
by a following whoso united strength can
be thrown at any time as ho may elect to
elevate or defeat either a conservative era
a liberal ministry. Unless an unl.k.ily
combination is made between the liber
als and conservatives to res'ust all .Irish
demands , Air. Parnell and his party will
bo dictators of all legislation in tlio coin
ing parliament. To the English people
generally the situation will bo a mo.s
humiliating one and demands are al
ready made for a prompt dissolution of
the parliament and a new appual to the
country. It is safe lo bay that the ex
pense and excitement of n new electoral
campaign w II not be forced upon the
country until tliu experiment of conduct
ing parliament under tint new condi
lions has been attempted by the present
party loaders. Mr. Gladstone seems
inclined to make heavy bids for the Pur
nulliioHiipportand Mr. I'arncll , in turn ,
if tlio cable dispatches are to bo credited ,
is not diriinolini'd to a renewal of the
treaty of Kilmainhum. It renuind to bo
been xvh.it compromise can bo decided
upon which will secure iinitml liberal
support and prove .satisfactory to the
nationalist party. So far the leader of
thi ) nationalist.- , has declined l > formu
late Ins programme for Si > lf-governni"iit
in Ireland Wnat it is to include and
what to exclude is a matter of profound
importance to Knglibhmcn , Any step
looking toward the dissolution of the im
perial union will be certainly opposed by
both branches of the liberal party. If
the tory lenders are to be bolhived , any
movement which trenches on imperial
inthority in purely Imperial matters , such
is taxation , and tlie military and nuva
jsjubliihinonts , will not receive the sup
iiort of Lord .Salisbury's ministry. It is
casonablo then to believe that what-
ivcr coalition is rondo must
; e between the liberals and the
. 'nriiollitos as against the conservatives ,
inch an alliance would mean a majority
) f 170 voU'S over the conservatives and n
eturn of the liberals to power. If Mr ,
'arnoll is prepared to dollno what his
tarty demands are , and if those demands
lo not exceed the extent of local
uitonomy which the liberal party Is pro-
tared to allow , there is no reason why u
trong working majority should not
nice moni return thu liberal leaders to
lower at Westminster , Under any cir-
iiuistuncrs , Pnnioil'd power in thu next
larliamiMit will bo decisive. Ilu will
iicttitu to the existence or decease of the
iody. His wish will determine the fnto
if mcitbures nnd ministries ,

for n long period which dcnls fearlessly
with the abuses which have sprung tin in
the land office , and norts the rights o (
the people as against the great corpora
tions nnd syndicates who hnvo seized
upon llio public domain. In Mr.

mon Sense , pr.tctic.il rcmodics for the
evils of a bungling nnd cumin rous

It looks as if Mr. Cleveland's administra
tion was to bo n practical and business
one. This is a cause for congratulation
Irrespective of party. With all its
dishonest buncombe about the civil
service reform which ho preaches but
declines to practice , Mr. Cleveland is
beginning his administration In n man *
tier which will commend him to the best
elements in both parties ,
Tlio HUH Question.
When the first complaints began la
pour in about the inferior quality of the
water gas , the l Kti was inclined to give
tin1 company the bonolitof their apology
that as soon as the works wore com-
pleteil all grounds for dissatisfaction
would be promptly removed. The works
are done , or ought to bo if they are not ,
and the gas furnished to the city for
street light and to our cili/.ons and mer
chants for their homes and business
houses continues to be of R decidedly in
ferior quality. In addition to the poor
quality of the light , there is a general
complaint of Increased bills and
rapidly revolving motors. Notwith
standing the reduced price per
thousand the cost for the same
scrvicn proves to be much greater than
under the old system. Consumers , who
a year ago paid ? : ) and $10 for their ordi
nary consumption of gas in November ,
Hud their bills this year more than
doubled in aomo instances. The report
of Gas Inspector Gilbert , who under
stands his business thoroughly , shows
conclusively that the light furnished is
not up to the standard remiired of the
company in their contract with the city.
UuringXovembcr the standard was only
It MO candle power for the month
much below the contract requirements.
The increase in the gas bills is duo to the
rapid passage of tlio water gas through
the meters under heavy pressure.
Recent investigations of tlio New
York state senate committee show
that the name "gas-meter" is n misno
mer. The motor conscientiously regis
ters anything passing through it , from
hot air to sewer gas. The amount of
lightgiven in proportion to the thousand
I'oi-t , as registered by a correct meter , is
the only true test of relative economy be
tween nnv two Illuminating gases. Using
the comparison in the case of the water
gas as now furnished , and the coal gas
manufactured by the old company , the
city is paying very dearly for its illumi
nation. A bettor quality of gas in other
cities is being furnished at ? 1Y.5 a thotist
and , while Omaha , is charged double ilia
amount for an article that can bo manu
factured hero for 51 cents.
Thu eity council should make n promp"
and thorough investigation of the Mib-
jcet. They are empowered to compel thu
gas company to comply with tlmir con
tract. So far as our citi/ens are con
cerned , Omaha is growing largo enough
for n computing company , and if no other
remedy can bo found , steps ought lo betaken
taken to form one.
After the Tax Slurkora.
Snnntor Van Wyck comes promptly to
the front at the opening of tlio senate
with his bill to make thu land grant roads
pav taxes on their untaxt'd lands. Recent
settlers in Nebraska who are not familiar
with llio mollioils of the railroad tax
shirkers will learn with astonishment
that of the millions of unpatcntcd lands
belonging to the railroads in tills state ,
not an acre has overpaid a dollar of state
or county taxes. The process by which
tlte companies have evad id taxation on
their land grant is a disgraceful one. '
Under the ruling of the supreme court at
Washington , it was decided that the
Union L'.ioilio railroad had su.Hcicnt title
in their lands to planter them with
mortgage * . Under anotimr jug handled
ruling in n cooked up case , it was
decided that so long as no patents
were taken out by the companies , the
title to the btr.ds rumainod in the gov
ernment nnd that taxation was illegal.
The rules of the general land olllco re
quire that all nnsiirveyed lands mint bu
Hiirvoyed before application for patents
will be considered. This is especially
ncccbsary in the case of the land grants
In order that the boundaries of the alter
nate sections granted may bo defined and
that titles may not issue to the railroads
for hinds open to homostjad and preemption -
omption under the general land laws.
N'ow the. railroads , in order to prevent
ihemselvos from being subject totivv-
tion b.vhocuring full title to their lands
through the issuance of patents , have re
fused to have their lands mirvnvod. From
limit to time , as they have sold parcels
ilong their llnu.s , mirvoys have boon
nude and patents lakun out , but of tlio
nillloiu , of acres which still re-
naln on thu hooka of thu railroad
and olltco not an acre la subjjct to
axation.
Senator Van Wyek'd bill requires the
iompanies to pay the cost of surveying
mil locating thiisit lauds within sixty days
iftor tliu piuH.iga of this net and provides
hat in dofautt of such survey unit ( oca-
ion the lands shall bj .suhjeat lo entry

very honest hunutor und congressman ,
t is founded on principles of equity , anJ
u.stlce , which require that all shall bear
heir duo proportion of the burdens of
iiMitlim in return for their proportion of
ho protection guaranteed by the law.
; 'hu railroad tax shirkum who for nearly
wonty years have shifted thu expense of
tate government upon the people by de
clining to pay their taxes must bi
brought to time. Senator Van Wyck deserves
serves the tlutaks of the people of No

behalf in spite of the rtbu.soof the corpor
ution attorneys and the ridicule of tin
