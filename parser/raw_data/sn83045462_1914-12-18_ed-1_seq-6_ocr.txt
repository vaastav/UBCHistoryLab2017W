The District's Interest Debt.
Controller Downey's decision that

to reimburse the United States dire
from local funds in his care for the 1
i riot's share of the interest on the >
bonds for the years IS77 and 1S7S. w
out legislation, supplements his ruling
last January, in which he held that
United States lias, since 1S78, b

covered in the course of a long ;
expensive inquiry that, owing to
faulty bookkeeping of the United Sta

A White House Caller.
Itcpresentative Smith of the Buf
district performed :i valuable ser
yesterday when be went to the W
House and bad a heart-to-heart 1
with the President 011 the subject
New York patronage. There are
details, but the conversation must li
been interesting. Mr. Smith bad vi
and information it was worth the P
idexst's while to consider, while
President had views and explanati
of equal importance to Mr. Smith,
probability is that the New York
yation will be affected?and maybe
the better?by the visit. If at all,
the better. The situation, from
democratic point of view, could no
worse.
The White House has been callct
fool's paradise." The occupant, w
in one way very powerful, is in ano
way very helpless. He is forced
lean upon others for much informa
about men and their political strei
and relation. He has a great many
pointments to make; and the presi
upon him in some cases is heavy.
This makes his calling list long,
nearly everybody wants something,
himself or a friend. Jollying the Pi
dent is not only a rule, but rega
as a necessity. Ho beaxs only pn
lR, I and lacks the time, and maybe the dis-Ito t
' position, to discount it properly. Any tr*ci
man so placed would be a marvel if he of 1
?? did not now and then obey the wrong In i
"steer" as to patronage. Even with to u
the best intentions, he is bound at beei
914 times to make mistakes.
The New York controversy is of the istir
.^0p spoils variety, and therefore the fuller is a
of danger. The President is expected in f
to place the patronage at his disposal in
bay. where it will do his party the most beer
good. Tf it were a matter only of find- own
ing a competent lawyer of good repute
to represent the government in that ,v\*
federal judicial district there would be able
* no difficulty. But the nominee, in nddi- tere
tion to ability and character, should be jtini
acceptable to the regular party organ- of a
i per izatlon, and possess more or less of a
H4? i "Pul1" himself. In office he should be ,pj.
each I able to strengthen his party within the ject
| zone of his service. nat{
There is where the shoo pinches. The
'd: New York reeulars contend that the
^ President lias obeyed tlie wrong
re?r. steer"; that he has been persuaded to ' ?
make war on the men who made him, ;l 01
P0*1 and that If he persists in his course he )eel
_ will injure the New York democracy,
t and through it the national democracy. !
:0:1 id From their point of view, the President ;
>r*t? himself suffer in the end if he does
ding not turn from the irregulars to them. }
It is not too late for the President to
turn, although it will not be easy for
him to execute the maneuver. He has
: led so aggressively and successfully in
the such matters since taking charge, it
wer may irk him to accept even a mild re- 110 1

in At that time the great nations were ?

east was as quiet as the west.
