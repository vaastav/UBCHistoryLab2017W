FULL TEXT OS" THE MESSAGE.
"Washbjgton, Dec. ft—The following Is
the lull text of President Cleveland's mes­
sage, as read to both houses of Congress to­
day:
TO TOE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES—
You are confronted at the threshold of your
legislative dunes with a condition of the Na­
tional finances which imperatively demands im­
mediate and careful consideration.
The amount of money annually exacted
through the operation of present laws, from the
Industries ana necessities of tlie people, largely
exceeds the sum necessary to meet the expenses
of the Government.
When we consider that the theory of our in­
stitutions guarantees to every oitizen the full
enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and
enterprise, with only such deduction as may
be his share toward the oareful and economical
maintenance of the Government wh,oh pro­
tects him, it is plain that the exaction of more
than this is indefensible extortion, and a culpa­
ble betrayal of American fairness and justice.
This wrong, indicted upon those who
hear the burden of National taxation, like
other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil conse­
quences. The public treasury, whioh should
only exist us a conduit conveying the people's
tribute to its legitimate objects of expenditure,
becomes a hoardiug-place tor,money ueediessly
withdrawn from trade and the people's use,
thus crippling our National energies, suspend­
ing our country's development, preventing in­
vestment in productive enterprises, threaten­
ing financial disturbance and inviting schemes
of public plunder. This condition of our
Treasury is not altogether new and it has
mure than once of late.' been submitted to tho
people's representatives in Conaress, who
alone can apply a remedy. And yet the situa­
tion still continues, with aggravated incidents,
more than ever presaging financial convulsions
and wide-spread disaster.
will not do to neglect this situation be
ca its dangers are not now palpably imml
bo.it and apparent. They exist none the less
certainly, and await the unforeseen, unex­
pected occasion when suddenly they will be
precipitated upon us.
On the 30th day of June, 1885, the excess of
revenues over public expenditures, after com­
plying with the annual requirement of the
binking-fund act, was $17,859,735.34: during the
ye..r ended June 30,ln&i, such excess amounted
to $49,405,54.1.20, and during the year ended
June ao, 1867, it reached the sum of &&567,849,
54
The annual contributions to the sinking fund
during the three years above specified, amount­
ing in the aggregate to &138,0o8.32&94, and de­
ducted from the surplus as stated, were made
by calling in for that purpose outstanding 3 per
cent, bonds of the Government. During the six
months prior to June 30, 1887, the surplus rev­
enue had grown so largo by repeated accumu­
lations, and it was feared the withdrawal of this
great sum of money needed by the people,
would
so aftect the business of the country,that t£e sum
of of |suoh surplus was applied to the
payment of the principal and interest of the
3 per cent, bonds still outstanding, and wh ch
were then payable at the option of the Govern­
ment. The precarious condition of finaucial
aflairs among the people still needing relief,
immediately after the 30th day of June, 1887,
the remainder of the 3 per cent, bonds then
outstanding, amounting, with principal and in­
terest, to the sum of $18,(577,500, were called in
and applied to the sinlcin^-fund contribution
for the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding
these operations of the Treasury Depart­
ment, representations of distress in
business circles not only continued
but increase-J, and absoluto peril seemed at
band. In these circum^t nces the contribution
to the sinking fuud for the current fiscal year
was at once completed by the expenditure of
87,034,283.55 in tie purchase of Government
bonds not yet due bein 4 and 4:4 per cont^inter
est, the premium paid therou averagingabout
percent, for the former aud'JB per oent. tor the
latter. In addition to this the interest accruing
during the current year upoa the outstanding
bonded indebtedness of the Government was to
some extent anticipated, and banks seleoted as
depositor es of public money were permitted to
somewhat increase their deposits.
While the expedients thus employed to re­
lease to the people the money lying idle in the
treasury served to avert immediate danger, our
surplus revenues have continued to accumulate,
the excess for the present year amount ng on
the first day of December to $55,2 8,701.19, and
est muted to reach the sum of $113,030, U00 on
the c9th of June next, at which date it is ex­
pected that th sum, added to prior accumula­
tions will, swell the surplus in the Treasury to
tJ-U),000,000.
Tii ve seems to be no assurance that with
•uch a withdrawal from use of the people's
en culating medium our business may not in
the near future be subjected to the same
distress which was quite lately produced
from the same, cause. And while the func­
tions of our National Treasury should be
few and simple, and while its best con­
dition would be reached, I believe,
by its entire disconnection with pri­
vate business interests, yet when, by a perver­
sion of its purposes, it idly holds money use­
lessly subtracted from the channels of trade,
there seems to be reason .for the claim that
some legitimate means should be devised by
the Government: t& restore in an emergency,
without waste or extravagance, such money to
Its place among the people.
If sueh an emergency arises there now exists
no clear and undoubted executive power of re­
lief. Heretofore the redemption of 3 per cent,
bonds, which were payable at the option of the
Government, has afforded a means for the dis­
bursement of the excess of our revenues but
these bonds have all been retired, and there are
no bonds outstanding the payment of which we
have the right to insist upon. The contribu­
tion to the Binking fund which furnishes the oc­
casion for expenditure in the purchase of bonds
has been already made for the current year, so
there is no outlet in that direction.
the present state of legislation the only
pretense of any existing executive power to re­
store at this time any part of our surplus rev­
enues to the people by its expenditure, consists
in the supposition that the Secretary of the
Treasury may enter the market and purchase
the bonds of the Government not yet due, at a
rate of premium to be agreed upon.
The only provision of law from which such a
power could be derived is found in an appropri­
ation bill passed a number of yeirs ago and it
Is subject to the suspicion that it was Intended
sb temporary and limited in its application, in­
stead of conferring a continuing discretion and
authority. No condition ought to exist which
would justify the grant of poweyXo a single
official, upon his Judgment of its necessity, to
withhold from or release to the business
of the people, in an unusual manner, money
held in the Treasury, and tnus afreet, at his
will, the financial situation of the country and
if is deemed wise to lodge in the Secretary of
the Treasury the authority in the present junct­
ure to purchase bonds, it should be plainly
vested, and provided, as far as possible, with
such checks and limitations as will define this
official's right and discretion and at the same
time relev^ him from undue responsibility.
In considering the question of purchasing
bonds as a means of restoring to circulation
the surplus money accumulating In the Treas­
ury. it should be borne in mind that premiums
must of course be paid upon such purchase,
that there may be a large part of these bonds
held as investments which can not be pur­
chased at any price, and that complications
among holders who are willing to sell may un­
reasonably enhance the cost of such bonds to
the Government.
It has been suggested that the present bond­
ed debt might be refunded at a less rate of in­
terest, and the difference between the old and
hew securities paid in cash, thus finding use
for the surplus in the Treasury. The success
of this plan, it is apparent, mast depend upon
the volition of the holders of the present bonds
and it is not entirely certain that tbe induce'
merit which must be offered them would re­
sult in more financial benefit to the Govern­
ment thian the purchase of bonis, while tbe lat­
ter proposlt'on would reduce the principal of the
debt try actual payment, instead of extending it.
The proposition to deposit the mouey held by
the Government in bans throughout the coun­
try for use by the people is, it seems to me,
exceedingly objectionable in rinoiple, as es­
tablishing too close relationship between the
operations of the Government treasury and
the business of the country, and too extensive
aoo-mingling of their money, thus fostering an
nnnatural reliance in private business upon
public funds. If this scheme should be adopt­
ed it should only be done as a tempor ry
expedient to meet an urgent necessity. Legis­
lative and executive effort should generally be
is the opposite direction, and should have a ten­
dency to divorce, as much and .as fast as can
safely be done, the Treasury Department from
pr yate enterprise.
Of course it is not expeoted that unnecessary
Md extravagant appropriations will be made
for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation
of an excess of revenue. Such expenditure,
beside tbe demoralization of all just concep­
tions of public duty which it entails, stimulates
habit fft reckless improvdence not in the
least consistent with Remission of our people
or the high and beneficent mirposea of our

v.'
I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the
knowledge of my countrymen, as well as to the
attention of their representatives charged with
the responsibility of legislative relief, the
gravity of our financial situation. The failure
of the Congress heretofore to provide against
the dangers which it was quite evident the
very nature of the difficulty must necessarily*
produce, caused a condition of financial dis­
tress and apprehension since your last ad­
journment whioh taxed to the utmost all the
authority and expedieuts within executive con­
trol: and these appear now to be exhausted.
If disaster results from the continued inaotlon
of Congress, the responsibility must rest where
it belongs.
Though the situation thus far considered is
fraught with danger whioh should be fully
realized, and though it presents features of
wrong to the people as well as peril to the
country, it is but a result growing out of a per­
fectly palpable and apparent cause, constantly
reproducing the same alarming- ciroumstances
—a congested National treasury and a depleted
monetary condition in the business of the coun­
try. It need hardly be stated that,, while the
present situation demands a remedy, we can
only be saved from a like predicament in the
future by the removal of its cause.
Our scheme of taxation, by means of which
this needlessfsurplus is taken from tbe people
and put into the puolio treasury consists of a
tariff or duty ewed upon importations from
abroad, and internal-revenue taxes levied upon
the consumption of tobacco and spirituous and
malt liquors. It must be oonoeded that none of
the things subjected to internal-revenue taxa­
tion are, strictly speaking, necessaries there
appears to be no just complaint of this taxation
by the consumers of these artioles, and there
seems to be nothing so well able to bear the
burden without hardship to any portion of tbe
people.
But our prosent tariff laws—the vicious, in­
equitable and illogical source of unnecessary
taxation—ought to be at once revised and amend­
ed. These laws, as their primary and plain
effect, raise the price to consumers of all arti­
cles imported and subject to duty, by pre­
cisely the sum paid tor such duties. Thus
the amount of the duty measures the tax paid
by those who purchase for use these imported
articles. Many of these things, how­
ever,. are raised or manufactured in
our oVn country, and tho duties now levied up­
on foreign goods and products are called pro­
tection to these home manufactures, because
they render it possible for those of our people
who are manufacturers to make these taxed
articles and sell them for a price equal to
that demanded for the imported goods that
have paid customs duty. So it happens
that while comparatively a few use
the imported artioles, millions of our
people, who never use and never saw any of the
foreign products, purchase and use things of the
same kind made In this oountry,~hnd pay there­
for nearly or qu.te the same onhancod price
which the duty adds to the imported articles.
Those wno buy imports pay the duty charged
thereon into the public treasury, but the great
majority of our -citizens, who buy domestic
articleis of the same class, pay a sum at
least approximately equal to this duty to the
home manufacturer. This reference to the op­
eration of our tariff laws is not made by way
of instruction, but in order that we may be con­
stantly reminded of the manner in which they
impose a burden upon those who consume do­
mestic products as well as those who consume
imported articles, and thus create a tax upon
all our people.
It :s not proposed to entirely relieve the
country of this taxation. It must be exten­
sively continued as the source of the Govern­
ment's income and in a readjustment of
our tariff the interests of American labor
engaged in manufucture should be onre
fully considered, as well as the preserva­
tion of our manufacturers. It may be called
protection, or by any other name, but
relief from the hardships and dangers of our
present tariff laws should be. devised with
espec al precaution against imperiling the ex­
istence of our manufacturing interests. But
this existence should not mean a condi­
tion which, without regard to the pub
lib welfare or a national exigency, must al­
ways insure tne real.zation of immense profits
instead of moderately profitable returns. As he
volume and divers.ty of our National activities
increase, new recruits are added to those who
desire a continuation of the advantages which
they conceive the p,esent system of tariff
taxation directly affords them. So stub­
bornly have all efforts to reform the present
condition been resisted by those of our fellow
citizens thus engaged, .that they can hardly
complain of the susp on, entertained to a cer­
tain extent, that tpfere exists unorganized com­
bination all along'the line to maintain their ad­
vantage.
We are in the midst of centennial celebra­
tions and with becoming pride we rejoice in
American skill and ingenuity, in American en­
ergy and enterprise, and in the wonderful nat­
ural advantages and resources devel­
oped by a century's National growtn.
Yet when an attempt is made to
justify a scheme which permits a tax to be
laid upon every consumer in the land for the
benefit of our manufacturers, quite beyond a
reasonable demand for governmental regard,
it suits the purposes of advocacy to call our
manufactures infant ndustries, still needing
the highest and greatest degree of favor ana
fostering care that can be wrung from Federal
legislation.
It is also said that the Increase in the price
of domestic manufactures resulting from
the present tariff is necessary in order that
higher wages may be paid to our working
men employed in manufactories than are
paid for what Is called the pauper labor
of Europe. Ad will acknowledge tbe force
of an argument which involves the
welfare and liberal compensation of
our laboring people. Our labor is honorable in
the eyes of every American citizen, and as it
lies at tho foundation of our development and
progress^ it. is entitled, without affectation or
hypocrisy, to the utmost regard. The standard
of our laborers' life should ridt be measured by
that of any other country less favored, and they
are entitled to their full share of all our ad­
vantages..
By the last census it is made to appear that
of the 17,592,099 of our population engaged in
all kinds of iadustries, 7,87u,498 are employed
in agriculture, 4,074,2 8 in professional and per­
sonal serv.ee (2,934,876 of whom are domestic
servants and laborers), while 1,810,256 are em­
ployed in trajie and transportation and3,887,112
are classed as employed in manufacturing and
mining.
For present purposes, however, the last num­
ber given should be considerably reduced.
Without attempting to enumerate all, it will
be conceded that there should be deducted
from those which it includes 875,14* carpenters
and Joiners, 28^,401 milliners, dressmakers and
seamstresses, 1TC, 7^6 blacksmiths, 183,750tailors
and tailoresses, 102,473 masons, 76,241 butchers,
41,309 bakers, #!,08i plasterers, and 4,891 engag­
ed in manufacturing agricultural implements,
amounting in tbe aggregate to 1,214,023, leaving
2,623,Uh9 persons employed in suoh manu­
facturing industries as are claimed to
be benefited by a high tariff. To these
the appeal is made to save their em­
ployment and maintain their wages by
resisting a change. There should be' no dis
posit.on to answer such suggestions by the alle­
gation that they are in a minority among those
who labor, and therefore should forego an ad­
vantage,' in the interest of low prices for the
majority their compensation, as it may be at­
tested by the operation of tariff laws, should at
all times be scrupulously kept in view
and yet with slight reflection they will not over­
look the fact that they are consumers with tne
rest that ttiey, too, have their own wants and
those of their families to supply from their
earnings, and that the price of the necessaries
of life, as well as the amount of their wages,
will regulate the measure of their welfare and
comfort.
But the reduction of taxation demanded
should be so measured as not to necessitates*
justify either the loss of employment by the
workingman nor the lessening of his wages and
the profits still remaining to the manufacturer
after a necessary readjustment, should fur­
nish no excuse for the sacrifice of the
iiiterests of his employes either in their oppor­
tunity to work or in tbe diminution of their
compensation. Nor can the worker in manu­
factures fail to understand that while a high
tariff is claimed to be necessary to allow the
payment of remunerative wagbs, it certainly
results in a very large increase in the price
of nearly all sorts of manufactures,
which, in almost countless forms, he needs for
the use of himself and* bis. family. He receives
at the desk of his employer his wages, and per­
haps before he reaches his home is obliged, in a
purchase for family use of an article which em
braces' h'S'own labor, to return, in the payment
of the increase in price which the tariff per­
mits, the hard-earned compensation of many
daysof toil.
The farmer and the agriculturist who manu­
facture nothing, but who pay the increased
pr ce which the tariff imposes, upon every agri­
cultural implement, upon all he wears ana upon
all he uses and owns, except the increase of his
flocks and herds ana such things as his hus­
bandry produces from the soil, is invited to
aid in maintaining the present situation and
his is told that a bigh duty on imported wool is
necessary for the benefit of those who have.
sheep to shear, in order that the price of their
wool may be increased.s They, of 'bourse, are
not remluded that tbe tarmerwho has no sheep
is by this scheme obliged in his purchases of
clothing and woolen goods, to pay a tribute
to his fellow farmer as well as to the
manufacturer and merchant nor is any men­
tion made of the fact that the Bhaet -owners
themselves and their households must wear
otbing and use other' articles manufactured
from the wool they sell at tariff pr ces, and
thus, as consumers, must return thair share of
this infcreaseii price to the tradesmnn.
I thipk it may be fairly assumed that a large
proportion of the sheep owned by the farmers
throughout th*' pountry are found lis small
1
Tv:-wM
flocks numbering from twenty-five t* fifty.
The duty ot» the grade of Imported wool
which tnevv sheep yield is 10 cents eaoh
pound if of the value of 80 cents or less, and
12 cents if of tbe value of more than80oents. If
the libera* estimate of six pounds be allowed
for each fle»oe, the duty thereon would be sixty
or seventy-ttvo cents, and this may be taken as
the utmost enhancement of its price to the
farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen dol­
lars would thus represent tbe increased pried
of the wool frbm' twenty-five sheep, aha tail
that from tb wool of fifty sheep, and at
present valued this addition would amount to
about one-thir, of its price. If, upon its sale
the farmer re» tves this or a less tariff profit,
the wool leaves iis hands charged with precisely
that sum, whioh in all its changes will adhere to
it, until' it reaches the consumer. When manu­
factured into cloth and other goods and materi­
al for use, its cost is not only increased to
the extent of the farmer's tariff profit, but a
further sum has been added for the benefit of
the manufacturer under the operation of other
tariff lawsi In the meantime, the day arrives
when the farmer finds it neoessary to purchase
woolen goods and material to clothe himself
and family for the winter. When ho faces
the tradesman for that purpose he discovers
that he is obliged not only to return, in the
wayof inoreased prioes, his tariff profit on the'
wool he sold, and whioh then perhaps lies be­
fore him in manufactured form, but that he
must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a
further increase in cost caused by a tariff duty
on the manufacture. Thus in the end he is
aroused to the fact that he has paid upon a
moderate purchase, as a. result of the tariff
scheme—which, when he sold bis wool, seemed
so profitable an increase in price—more than
sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he
received upon the wool ne produced and sold.
When the number of farmers engaged in
wool-raising is compared with all the farmers
in the country, and the small proportion they
bear to our population is considered when it
is ,made apparent that, in the case of
a large part of those who own sheep, the
benefit of the present tariff on wool is il­
lusory and, above all, when it must be con­
ceded that the increase of the cost of liv­
ing oaused by such tariff becomes a burden
upon those with moderate means and tbe poor,
the employed and unemployed, the siok and
well, and the young and old, and that it con­
stitutes a tax which, with relentless grasp, is
fastened upon the clothing of every man, wom­
an and child in the land, reasons are suggested
why tbe removal or reduction of this duty
should be included in a revision of our tariff
laws.
In speaking of the increased
coBt
to the con­
sumer of our home manufactures, resulting
from a duty laid upon imported artioles of tbe
same description, the fast is not overlooked that
competition among our domestic producers
somet mes has tbe effect of keeping tne price of
their products below the highest limit allowed
by suoh duty. But it is notorious that this com­
petition is too olten strangled by combinations
quite prevalent at this time and frequently
oalled trusts, which have for their object the
regulation of the supply and price of commodi­
ties made and sold by members of the combina­
tion. The people can hardly hope for any con­
sideration in the operation of these selfish
schemea
If, however, in the absence of such combina­
tion, a healthy and free competition reduces
the price or any particular dutiable article of
home production below the limit which it might
otherwise reach under our tariff laws, and if,
with suoh reduced price, its manufacture con­
tinues to thrive, it is entirely evident that one
thing has been.discovered which should be
carefully scrutinized in an effort to reduce taxa­
tion.
The necessity of combination to maintain the
price of »ny commodity to the tariff point fur­
nishes proof that some one is willing to accept
lower prices for such commodity, and that sueh
prices are remunerative and lower prices pro­
duced by competition orove the same thing.
Thus, where either of these conditions exist a
case would seem to be presented for an easy
reduction of taxation.
The considerations which have been present­
ed touching our tariff laws are intended only to
enforce an earnest recommendation that the
surplus revenues of the Government be pre­
vented by the reduction of our customs duties,
and,at the same time, to emphasize a suggestion
that, in accomplishing this, purpose, we may
discharge a double duty to our people by grant­
ing to them a measure of relief from tariff tax­
ation in quarters where it is most needed and
from sources where it can be most fairly and
justly accorded. Nor can the presentation
made of such considerations be, with any de­
gree of fairness, regarded as' evidence of un­
friendliness toward our manufacturing inter­
ests, or of any lack of appreciation of their
value and imDortance.
These interests constitute a leading and most
substantial element of our National greatnesd
and furnish the proud proor of our country's
progress. But if, in the emeigency that presses
upon us, our manufacturers are asked to sur­
render something for the publio good and
to avert disaster their patriotism, as well as
a grateful recognition of advantages already
afforded, should lead them to willing co-opera­
tion. No demand is made that they shall fore­
go all the benefits of governmental regard but
they can not fail to be admonished of their duty,
as well as their enlightened self-interest and
safety, when they are reminded of the fact that
financial panic and collapse, to which the pres­
ent condition tends, afford no greater shelter or
protection to our manufactures than to our
other important enterprises. Opportunity for
safe, careful and deliberate reform is now of­
fered, and none of us should be unmindful of a
time when an abused and irritated people,heed
less of those who have resisted timely and rea­
sonable relief, may insist upon a radical and
sweeping rectification of their wrongs.
The difficulty attending a wise and fair re­
vision of our tariff laws is not underestimated.
It will require on the part of the Congress great
aa ana
labor and care, and es
ipeclally
the sut
broa Na­
tional contemplation of the subject, and apatri
otic disregard of such local and selfish claims as
are unreasonable and reckless of the welfare
of .the entire country.
Under the present laws more than four thou­
sand articles are subject to duty. Many of
these do not in any way compete with our own
manufactures, and many are hardly worth at­
tention as subjects of revenue. A considerable
reduction can be made in the aggregate by ad­
ding them to the free -list. The taxation
of luxuries presents no features of hardship
but the necessaries of life used and consumed
by all the people, tbe duty upon which adds to
tbe cost of living in every home, should be
greatly cheapened.
The radical reduotion of the duties imposed
upon raw^naterial used in manufactures, or Its
free importation, is of oourse an important
factor in any effort to reduoe the price of these
necessaries it would not only relieve them
from the increased cost caused, by the tariff
on such material, but the "manufactured
product, being thus cheapened, that part
of the tariff now laid upon such prod­
uct as a compensation to our manu
faptures for the present price of raw material
could be accordingly modified. Suoh reduotion,
or free importation, would serve beside to large­
ly reduce the revenue. It is not apparent how
such a change can have any injurious effect
upon our manufactures. On the contrary, it
would appear to give them a better chance in
foreign markets with the manufacturers of oth­
er countries who cheapen their wares by free
material. Thus our people might have the op­
portunity of extending their sales beyond the
limits of home consumpt on, saving them from
the depression, interruption in business and
loss oaused by a glutted domestic market, and
affording jtheir employes more certain and
steady labor, with its resulting quiet and con­
tentment.
The question thus Imperatively presented for
solution should be approached in a spirit higher
than partisanship, and considered in tbe light
of that regard for patriotic duty whioh should
characterize the aotion of those intrusted
with the weal of a fconflding people. But
the obligation to declared party policy and
principal is not wanting to urge prompt and ef­
fective aotion. Both of the great politioal par­
ties now represented in the Government have,
by repeated and authoritative declarations,
condemned tbe condition of our laws which per­
mit the collection from the people of unneces­
sary revenue, and have, in the most solemn
manner, promised its correction and neither
as citizens or partisans are our countrymen in
a mood to condone the deliberate violation of
tnese pledges.
Our progress toward a wise conclusion will
not be improved by dwelling upon the theories
of protection and free trade. This savors too
much of bandying epithets. It is a con­
dition whioh confronts us, not a theory.
Belief frdm this condition may involve
a slight reduotion of the advantages
which we award our home productions
but the entire withdrawal of such advantages
should not be 'Contemplated. The question of
free trade Is absolutely irrelevant and the per­
sistent olaim made in certain quarters, that all
efforts to relieve the people from unjust and un­
necessary taxation are schemes of so-oalled
fre^trMers, is mischievous and far removed
from any consideration the for publio good.
The simple and plain duty whioh we owe the
people is to reduce taxation to tho necessary ex­
penses of an economical operation of the Gov­
ernment, and to restore tb the business of the
country the money whioh we hold 1m the treas­
ury, through the perversion of governmental
powers. These things can and should be, done
with safety to all our industries, without dagger
to the opportunity for remunerative labor
Which, our working-men need, and with benefit
to them and ali our people,^by cheapening their
monns of subsistence and increasing the meas­
ure of their comforts.
The constitution provides that the President
"shall from time to time give to the Congress
information of the state cf tbe Union." It has
been the cu*tom^of tb? Executive, in compliance
with thte provision, to an u.vlty exhibit to the
Congress, at the opening,of its session, tbege».
eral condition of ,tue country, and to detail, with
»ome particularity, the operations of the
different executive departments. It would
be especially agreeable to follow this
oourse at the present time, and to

interests as they deem advisable, ask fo
these reports and recommendations the delib

branch of the Government.
The next'ground of contention, the Jus­
tice said, was, that the breweries had been
erected pr^pr to the passage of the prohibi­
tion law, and us they were of little use ex­
cept for breweries, their property was
taken without dne process of law in
violation of the constitution But all
property under our form of govern­
ment, he held, was subject to the obliga­
tion that 'it should not be psed so
as to Injuriously affect the rights of the
.community, and thereby become a nuisance.
The State of Kansas had aright to prohibit
the liquor traffic. It did not thereby take
away the property of brewers. It simpiy
abated a nuisance. The property was not.
taken away from its owners they were
only prohibited from using it for a speoific
purpose, which the Legislature declared to
be injurious to the community.

There are other subjects not embraoed in the
departmental reports demanding legislative
consideration, and which I should be glad to
submit. Some of them, however, have been
earnestly presented in previous messages, and
as to them I beg leave to repeat prior recom­
mendations.
As the law makes no provision for any report
from the Department of State, a brief history
of the transactions of that important depart­
ment,'together wth other matters which it may
hereafter be deemed esssential to commend to
the attention of the Congress, may furnish tbe
occasion for a future communication.

the
case came up midsr
the laws of Kansas declaring the mainte­
nance of a building for the manufacture
and sale of intoxicants a misdemeanor. It
was contended that this law was unconsti­
tutional because it abridged* the rights of
citizens to property without due
process
of
law, the building used as a brewery being
of little value tor any other purpose.
Justice Harlan said it had been held re­
peatedly that the right of a State to regu­
late the sale of liquor did not invade the
constitutional rignts of the citizen. It wue
contended, however, he said, that no State
Legislature had aright to prohibit any per­
son from manufacturing liquor for his own
nse or for export, for the reason that) it was
an invasion on the personal liberty in­
herent in citizens. It must be ob­
served, however, he said, that tho right to
manufacture drink for one's own use was
subject to tbe restriction that it should not
injuriously affect the pubiia The right to
determine what was injurious hod to exist
somewhere, and the right of determining
what measures were necessary for the pres­
ervation of the publtoi morals, health and
safety had heretofore been vested in the
States by the nstitutional right given
them under the police power to regulate
their own internal concerns While this
police power oould not be abused and muse
only be exercised for objects of real merit,
this oour& would certainly not say that the
liquor traffic was not one whioh the State
could lawfully prohibit, because it was well
known that the abuse of intoxicants was
produotive of pauperism and crime.
Justice Field concurred in tbe opinion so far
as it related to the two oases in which the State
of Kansas was defendant, but dissented as t«
the oase of the State of Kansas vs. Zie­
boid. He' agreed, he said, to so
much of the opinion as sustains the validity
of the act of Kansas prohibiting tbe
sale of intoxicants which are manufactured
In the State after the passage of the aot. He
was not prepared, however, to say that the pro­
hibition of the manufacture of sueh liquors, if
intended for exportation, can be sustained, nor
that tbe State can forbid the sale under proper
regulations for the protection of the health
and morals of the people of any article
whioh Congress may authorize to be imported
He was not ready to admit that New York or
any other coast State can thus defeat an a£t
of Congress. Neither could he concur in the
validity of the thirteenth section of the Pro­
hibition aot of Kansas, because he believed
it authorized the destruction of property
without due process of law. He could not
see upon what principle the Legisla­
ture, after closing the brewery, can order
the destruction of liquor, which it admitb may
be valuable for medical or mechanical pur­
poses nor oould be see why the protection of
the morals of the State required the destruc­
tion of bottles and other utensils after the
liquor had been emptied from them.
TOPKKA, Kan., Dea 7.—The decision of the
United States Supreme Court sustaining
the prohibitory laws of this State is con­
ceded on all sides to be a great victory for
prohibition, and Is received with quite gen­
eral satisfaction in this oity, which is tue
stronghold of the Prohibitionists.
The anti-Prohibitionists say they had
little hope of a decision in their favor,
and that they do not desire to defeat
prohibition in this way. They believe the
law will become so obnoxious that the peo­
ple themselves will nullify it, Whether the
decision of the Supreme Court had been for
or against it would have had but little ef­
fect on prohibition in Kansas for the reason
that there are but four breweries in Kan­
sas now being operated, and the State
of Kansas could and would have compen­
sated tbei owners for whatever loss they
would have sustained had the decision been
against prohibition. The question was oi
more importance to other States in the

Wahb9?qton, Dec. 8.—The Secretary of: tbe
Treasury in his annual report submitted to Con­
gress says that the total ordinary recelptsr of
tbe Government for the year ended June 9(V
1887, were £871,403,877, and that the total ordi­
nary expenditures were 1315,885,428, leav­
ing a surplus of 955,507,840, which, with an
amountdrawn from the cash balance the
Treasury of &4,455,720, makes a total surplus
of #8Q,(W.«,ft7Q. whlqh was offered to the redemp­
tion of bonds. The receipts for the year show
an increase of 931,983,560 over- the
year before, and the expenditures
show an increase of 135,449,041. ,For
the present year the revenues are
estimated at $883,090,000, and tbe expenditures
(816,817,785, leaving an estimated surplus of'
!06,18.',?14 June 80, 1888. The Secretary esti­
mates the surplus for the year 1880 at 56,460,
£00. In regard to the surplus revenue, the Sec­
retary says:
"Taxation and, currency reform were the
Questions which my distinguished predecessor
deemed to be of the most pressing importance
and to them he devoted a large part of the
two annual reports which he made to the Con­
gress. I find the same subjects to be still the
most importa .t of all those to which
it is my duty to call your attention, and
it is not necessary to do otherwise than follow
the general lines laid down by him in treating
them. Circumstances have heightened the
immediate urgency of taxation reform as affect­
ing the surplus revenues of the Government.
The urgency is so great that the question of
surplus revenues demands the earnest attention
ol both tbe legislative and executive branches
of the Government."
The Secretary then gives the foHowing ways
in which the receipts and. expenditures of the
Government may be made about equal:
"1. The purchase of the interest-bearing debt
of the Government.
"2. Large expenditures by Government for
other purposes than the purchase of bo^.V so
that they shall each year equal the taxation of
that year.
"3. Reduction of tbe revenue from taxation
to the amouut actually required to meet neoes­
sary expenses.
"All of these expedients have in common
tbe one merit of preventing the derangement
to business whioh must follow hoarding or lock­
ing up in the Treasury the circulating medium
of the people."
In regard to the first plan the Secretary
agrees with what th6 President in his message
said on the same subject. He then says:
"I can not believe that it will adopt tbe sec­
ond expedient, viz.: the enlargement of Gov­
ernment expenses simply to expend money
raised by taxation when the publio weal does
nqt otherwise call for tbe expenditure.
"Reduction of the revenue from tax
at on is the only fit remedy for the
evils that threaten the country. This
may be accomplished in various ways. One
is to reduce or abolish internal revenue
taxation. In favor of this is the fact that in a
small part of the Southern States the internal
tax on liquors aud tobacco iff thought to be op­
pressive and is odious to the people ol those re­
gions and the further fact that by its reduc­
tion the expenses of its collection might be
somewhat reduced."
The th-fd expedient is discussed at great
length, the decrease of revenue from customs
by increasing duties to an almost prohibitive
extent being disposed or summarily. The Sec­
retary says that the objection to internal taxa­
tion on the ground that It began during
the war, and, therefore, is a war measure,
is not in reality an objection. He
disposes of the abolition of the internal
tax by saying: "To do away with
the whole revenue from internal taxes at pres­
ent would so diminish the revenues thart it
would be necessary either to lay duties on arti­
cles of importation now free, such as tea and
coffee, or to suspend the sinking-fund require­
ment, and also materially other ex­
penses of government."
The Secretary recommends again the amal­
gamation of the collection of customs dues and
internal taxes, and the passage by Congress of
the bill introduced two years ago and known as
the "Administration bill," revising the rules
and regulations imposing and collecting im­
port taxes.
"The surplus in the Treasury on December 1
amounted to is5,258,701, and the Secretary esti­
mates that it w.ll aggregate 3140,OJO,000 on
June 30 next On this point the Seoretary
says: "One use which can be made of th.s
money is to diminish taxation to suoh ail ex­
tent that tbe annual revenue will be less,
for some years to come, than the appro­
priations thus the accumulated surplus
would be used for ordinary expenses, and the
people would gain the greatest possible gqod
for it. Doubtless, by the time this money was
spent in the pursuance of this plan, the reve­
nues would have so increased as to be equal to
the proper annual expenses. Experience
teaches that this would probably be the case.
In the meantime a portion of this
money could lie in banks, where it
would be available for the business of the
country, and, as upon withdrawal from them
it would at once be returned to the nhannniH of
business through Government payments, no
shock would be oaused by such withdrawal."
The recommendatjons for revenue reform are
simply a rehash ol the President's message, or
rather were exhausted in that document.
After deducting the gold und silver coin held
for tho gold and silver cert ttoate* in circula­
tion, it is .found that the Government owned
(30,837,893 less gold coin and 39,875,763 less
standard silver dollars on Nov. 1, l&tf, than it
did on July 1, 1886 durin? the intervening
period 43,886.871 standard silver dollars were
coined. As there is still so mu«b coined gold
owned by the Government i82,6j7,c Nov. 1
1837,) it has been thought best to allow the
gold to accumulate in the form of bullion until
there is need of gold coin.
The statements of the Treasurer show that
after deducting he demand and trust liabili­
ties of tho Government and the amount of
money on deposit in National bank deposito­
ries, the net money in th Treasury vaults was
$fc3,49tJ,TO4.5d on June 30, 1886 Ootober 81,1887,
it was 140,459,361.77.
One of the most interesting facts shown by
the forogoing statement is the increase in^he
number of standard silver dollars owned bythe
Government and the inoreased use of the same
money by tho people in the form of silver cer­
tificates. The tb, IS and 11 oertifloates furniBh
a convenient currency, and it is evident that
thefuturouse of the silver dollar will heal
most exclusively in that form.
It is a waste to coin and store any more silver
dollars at present. There is no funotion whioh
those that are coined after this time will proba­
bly ever perform, except to lie in Govern­
ment vaults and be a basis opon whioh
silver certificates can be Issued. It is
seldom that any one wishes to have'his sil­
ver oortifloate exchanged for the silver dol­
lar itself consequently a limited number of
coined dollars will perform the work of redeem­
ing certificates. The {214,000,000 whioh are now
in the treasury will more tuau suffice to.. re­
deem,.as they may be presented from time to
time, the sliver certificates that have already
been issued or that oan be issued against all
the dollars which will be coined for years to
oome under the present law.
••The law should be so amended," the report
says, "as to authorize the Secretary of the
Tveasury to issue oertifloates against the com­
ing value of the bullion bought and to coin
only such, number of dollars as he might deem,
expedient hereafter This would not restriot
in the loast degree the use of the silver dollar
as curretioy. The oertifloates would be equally
sooure. whether representing oolned dollars
lying in vaults, or, representing bullion also

certificates would take the place of United

would make our currency more uniform and as
secure as now. Our people will never consent
that tbe money which is in every one's pocket
shall become of less value than it was
when the
Government paid it to them, if it be in tba
power of the Government to make it good."
The trade dollars nave been practically re­
deemed in gold under aot of Congress, although
they were held by bnt few persons, were intrin­
sically worth more tbanthe standard dollar, and
had far less equitable claim for redemption
than would the standard dollar. If ever the time
comes when the standard dollar goes to a dis­
count tbe people in the pockets of almost every
one of whom will be foundjuore or less of those
dollars, will emphatically demand that they,
too, shall be redeemed in gold or made as good
as when issued, and that the purchase of silver
bullion stop. the plan above suggested were
now adopted they wonld probably never go to a
discount—surely hot exoept under altogether
extraordinary circumstances and yet the pub
lie would have a supply of them 1 mited only by
the need and demand
of the peep for them. I
recommend that a law to the aoove ellect be
enacted.
With regard to immigration, the Secretary
recommends that the existing laws be so
amended that, in addition to the pro­
vision prohibiting the landing of aliens
liable to become a public charge^ idiots,
lunatics and convicts, a fine reasonable in
amount should be imposed opon the master of
the vessel for every such person brought by
him to this country, and that such fine
be made a lien upon tbe vesseL Pro­
vision should also be made that, where
aflfhs, after having been landed, are found,
within a time to be fixed, to be of
either of the classes whose landing is prohib­
ited, they should be deported by or at the ex­
pense of the master or owner of the vessel
bringing them, and, on failure to do so, such
master or owner to be subject to fine.
"The report of the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue points out the great disparity between
the special taxes and the tax on the article itselt
in the Oleomargarine law, which leaves it in
doubt as to whether the
law should be construed
as a protective measure or as a prohibitory
measure. He suggests a simplification of the
statute, if it is to be simply an internal revenue
measure, and submits oertain informa­
tion, including bills introduced and laws
passed by other countries, as valuable
aids to Congress, whether the law is to be
perfected either as a protective measure or as
a prohibitory measure. "I would recommend
that tbe law relative td oleomargarine be care­
fully reconsidered by Congress, and so amended
as to render it more efficient as a means of pro­
tecting the people from being imposed upon
through the sale of this article as butter."
I THE WAB DKPiSIHENK
WASHINGTON, Dea 8.—The report of the Sec­
retary of War for the last fiscal year shows
that the expenditures during the year were
$41,386,165 against (81,055,303 appropriated tor
the ourrent fiscal year. The Secretary estimates
that (53,338,710 will be needed during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 188ft. This includes an
item of 8^2,339,151 for public works and riv^r
and harbor improvements. He indorses the
recommendation of Lieutenant-General Sheri­
dan that the army be increased 5,000 men, and
renews past recommendations for appropria­
tions to strengthen our seacoast and lake front
defenses. Secretary Gndicott says that in
view of the success attained by our steel­
makers it is apparent that the assurance that
the outlay for the neoessary plant will prove
remunerative is all that is required to pro­
duce in this country the largest gun forglngs
of suitable quality. It is believed to be of
vital importance that appropriations be an­
nually made by Congress until our present need
of modern guns is supplied and the aid that our
steeljndustry demands Is assured. As a step
in this direction an appropriation of £1,501/,000
for the forcings
of eight-inch and ten-inch B.
steel guns is recommended.
The Secretary strongly approves of the
recommendation contained in General Sheri­
dan's report touching the extension of all pos
sible aid by the general Government to the
National guard of the different States, and sug­
gesting a system of National encampment for
State militia at the entire expense of the Na­
tional Government.
The report says that the buildings, fortifica­
tions, publio works and grounds in the division
of the Atlantic are everywhere in need of re­
pair and reconstruction. On the entire Atlantic
and gnlf coast line of 2,870 miles and the North­
ern frontier of sj,53d miles the sole armament is
142 r.fled guns, of whioh 116 are obsolete and ol
very low power. Even the few serviceable
rifled guns that are mounted are of but little
value. Some of them are mounted on old. car­
riages and all are without adequate protection.
Touching Geronimo and his fellow-captives,
now confined at Fort Pickens and Mount Ver­
non barracks, the report says that they are
contented, perform their work with Alacrity,
an thus fa( their conduct has been excellent.
At this time it is difficult to find for them a per­
manent home. Pending final decision they eap
remain where they are, in comfort and safety.
A brief history is given of the Colorow diffi­
culty in Colorado last August, and it is said
that some effort should certainly be made for
the restitution of their property to the Indians.
A brief reference is \pade to the recom­
mendations of the engineer bureau relative to
the reoonstruQtion of sea-coast and lake de­
fenses," and it is said that there appeals to be
no reason for further delay in beginning the
important work of fortifying the great harbors.
