Memorial —A memorial to Congress, ask
ing the p»«Mige of the Bedrock Flume bill, is
now being circulated throughout this, and Ada
oounties The bill accompanies, and is a part
of.the memorial. Read it carefully, and then
if its provisions meet your approval, sign it.
A bedrock flume in the various creeks in Boise
Basin, and a few thousand inches of water
turned into it from one or more of the large
streams named in the bill, would open up an
amount of mining ground, and give an impetus
to business in this county little thought of by
many people, and a charter from Congress will
go far toward bringing about this desired im
provement. Idaho Territory contains within
herself all the elements, and has all the natural
advantages requisite for the building up of a
great commonwealth; and if her citizens will
but gather up and mould the abundance of raw
material, which lies plastic at their feet, to the
uses of man and of commerce, her deserted pla
ces will soou "blossom as the rose." But all
of her many advantages—all of her stores of
gold and silver—her forest and pasture lands,
nor yet the fertility of her soil—will avail to
make her the great and prosperous community
•be should be, until man's intellect and energy
shall have redeemed tïiern from their present
primeval condition of idleness and uselessness,
and given them over to the uses of trade and
civilization. Any enterprise, therefore, having
view the development of any of the rusour
in
C es of our Territory, if it be of a proper na
ture, and not tainted with the evil spirit of
monopoly should be heartily supported.
Resigned —On November 23th, ult., Hon
Eugene Casserly, Senator from California, nnd
aspirant for re-election, tendered his resigna
tion of the high office he held. This is most
refreshing news. Senator Casserly. if he did
not bribe his way into office, at least, made use
of means of so equivocal a nature, that Gen.
Volney E. Howard published a card accusing
him of bribery. This card, coming from so
respectable a source, attracted serious atten
tion among honest Democrats, and last Full,
we believe it was, the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee of California, after investigat
ing the accusations, put them in the form of a
charge to be preferred against Mr. Casserly at
the opening of the present scssiun of the Sen
ate, and it was, perhaps, the fear of unpleas
ant exposures, in case of an investigation into
the manner of his election, which caused him
selves to positions they are unworthy
decency enough left to confess his guilt and re-
sign. Casserly deserves a vote of thanks from the
people of California. Let the resigning btisi-
ness go steadily on until all bribe givers and
bribe takers who are not in the penitentiary,
are in private life and profound obscurity.
-----
Unfit Appointment. -Attorney-General
Williams, of Oregon, ha* been tendered the
Chief Justiceship of the United States. We
have certaioly fallen upon evil days when the
mantle worn by Marshall, Taney and Chase
is permitted to descend upon such shoulders as
Williams'. Mr. Williams rs a politician who,
to draw it mildly, has more than once been
suspicioned of employing highly discreditable
mesa, for hi. advancement Be.ide., he i.
neither a scholar nor a first-rate lawyer; and
the man who occupies the proud and respons
ible position of Chief Justice of the United
States, should stand, by common consent, at,
the head of the legal profession, and be aschnl
ar of tbe highest attainments. It is not a po-1
sition to be filled by a boor, and such an
tempt can only result in bringing that tribunal
into discredit and contempt before the people,
by whom it should be confided in and respected,
' Fight between Lawyers —A disagree
ment between the Editor of tbe Statesman and
Hon. Frank E Ensign, came near resulting in
a fight tbe other day; but being in possession of
but one version of the affair, we forbear com
meats further than to remark that, if the
Stateman's is the correct version, Mr. Ensign
was in the wrong. It i» both the province nnd
tbe duty of tbe press to comment in any proper
manner, upon tbe public and official acts of
those who serve the public in any official ca-!
peeity, and the newspaper which is derelict in
this important matter, is unworthy the support
lf the community; while-the officer whose
induct will not biar the closest scrutiny should
reaigo. Besides, if the comments of the States
were personal or unwarrantably severe,
fte courts would probably have afforded the
aggrieved parties redress._

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
This document is quite lengthy, notwith
standing the President's exaggerated reputa
tation for conciseness and brevity It assumes
that political partisanship has about ceased to
exist in the agricultural regions; that the Span
ish imbroglio growing out of the capture
of the Virgiuius, and the murder of her
crew is in a fair way to honorable ad
justment. Informs the nation that our rela
tions with France. Germany, Italy, Russia, th**
South American Republics and Japan are cor
dial and friendly; refers to the reception of
American and European diplomats by the
Emperor of China in person as a hopeful sign:
thinks advances have been made towards the
suppression of the "infamous coolie trade,
recommends the early appropriation, by Con
gress. of money for the Geneva award, which
is stated at $1.929.819 in gold.
The President speaks of the Virgiuius af
fair in language becoiui >g the high office he
holds; reviewing with precision, and at some
length, the leading facts in the history of the
ill fated vessel; informs us that the Spanish
government has recognized the Justice of the
demand made upon it, "and arranged for the
immediate delivery of the vessel, and for the
surrender of the survivors of the passengers
and crew, and for a salute to the flag, and for
proceedings looking to the punishment of those
who may bo proved to have been guilty of ille
gal acts of violence towards citizens of the
United States; and. also, towards indemnify
ing those who may be shown to be entitled to
indemnity." He seems to favor a Constitu
tional amendment providing some new method
of electing a President; recommends author
izing the President to veto so much of any
law passing the two houses as his judgment
shall disapprove of, and to approve of the rest,
and thinks that no legislation should be per
mitted during the last twenty-four hours of a
session. The receipts of the government for
the last fiscal year are put down at $'{33.733.204.
und the expenditures for the same time at
$290.310.240, showing a balance in favor of
the Treasury of $43.392.959. But. imtwith
standing this favorable showing, it is predicted
that without the exercise of the closest econ
omy on the part of Congress and the Adminis
tration. the revenue for the present fiscal ye.tr
will fall short of meeting the current expenses

the Cuban thugs be made to answer for tbeir

set down at 910,000, and the total value ot the

statement of the actual amount of revenue paid
into the Treasury, by this enormous interest,
under the present high tariff system, would he

to operatives. These statements would enable
the country to decide just bow much the man-
ufucturers. how much the Government, and how
much the poor employees are benefited by the
tariff monopoly, and whether it is good policy
to longer continue it Will someone volunteer
the useful information ?

always to keep itself and Its readers Informed con
cerning the Mining. Agricultural. Str.ck-growlng and
Manufacturing interests and advantages of the Ter
ritory : believing these to be of paramount Importance
to Its growth, permanency snd prosperity. It will
give the latest and most reliable news obtainable,
and In tbe most condensed form ; preferring variety
to verbosity. It will sp*nk out for the right whether
friend or foe shall suffer; and will shrink from the
performance of no public duty, be the conaeqnencea
of Its performance what they may. It wilt have no
