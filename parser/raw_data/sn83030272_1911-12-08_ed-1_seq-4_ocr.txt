cation of the arbitration treaties with
Prance and Great Britain pondinc; in the
Sena'e The reaa ns for the mobilisation j
of the American military and naval f iroea
near ihe letas border are given fully'
and frankly
Here are soma of the m-re Important
parts of the message
MEXICO,
The recent political even's in Mexico
received attention from this Oovernmi nl
because of the exceedingly dalioate and
difficult situation eras tad along our
souttiern border and the necessity for
taking measures properly to safeguard I
American interests. The Government of ,
the United States, in its desire to - ire
a proper observance and enforcetnei l f
the eo-called neutrality statutes ol the'
Federal Government, laaued directions to
the appropriate officers to exercise si dili-1
gent and vigilant regaid for the req tire
mentg of such rules, and laws Altho igh
a condition of actual armed conflict
esleted, there was no offli lal recognition
of belligerency involving the technical
neutrality obligations Of international
law.
On the nth of March laal In the i! sence
of the Bscratary of State, I had a personal
Interview with Mr Wilson the Amhasaad r
of the United States to Mexico, in wl, oh
he reported to me tliat the conditions in 1
Mexico were much more critical th:in t
the press despatches disclosed; that Presi- '
dent Diaz was on a volcano of popular,
uprising, that the small outbreaks which
had occurred were only symptomatic of
the whole condition: that n very large per
rent of the people were in sympathy with ,
the insurrection, that a general explosion
waa probable at any time, in which case
he feared that the 4n.oon or more Amerioan
residents in Mexico might be assailed, and I
that the very large American Investments
might be injured or destroyed.
TTIE TEXAS MOBILIZATION.
After a conference wiMi the Secretari
at War and the Secretary of the N'avv. I
thought it wise to assemble an army divi
sion of full strength at San Antonio, Tex.,
a brigade of three t eg i men is a t ( lalveston, 1
a brigade of infantry in the ,oa Angeles
district of southern California, together1
with a squadron of battleships and or lis
era and transports at Galveston, and a
small squadron of ships a' San Diego
At the same time through our represents !
tlve t the city of Mexico, I expressed to
President Diaz the hope that no appro-
hensions might result from unfounded i
conjectures as to these military nianoeu -Tree,
and assured him that they had no j
significance which should cause concern
10 nts Government
The mobilization was effected wtth great
firomptnees, and on the 1Mb of March,
hrough the Secretary of War and the
secretary of the Navy, in a letter ad- j
dressed to the Chief of 'Btaff. I issued the
following Instructions:
"It seems my duty aa Commander in j
Chief to place troops in sufficient number
Where, if Congress shall direct that tnev '
enter Mexico to save American lives and '
property, an effective movement mav '
he promptly made Meantime, the move
ment of the troops to Texas and elsewhere
near the boundary, accompanied with
sincere assurances of the utmost good
will towarci tne present .Mexican Gov
ernment and with larger and more fre- '
qiient patrols along the border to prevent
Inaurreetionary expeditions from Amor- I
loan soil, will hold up the hands of the
existing Government and will havo a
healthy moral effect to prevent attacks I
upon Americans and their property in
sny subsequent general Internecine strife
Again, the sudden mobilization of n di
vision of troops has lioen a great test of
our army and full of useful instruction,
while the manoeuvres that are thus made
possible can occupy the troops and their
officers to great ndvantage.
'The assumption by the press that I
contemplate intervention on Mexican
soil to protect American lives or property
is of course gratuitous, because I seriously
doubt whether I have such authority
under any circumstances, and if I had I
would not agaroiae it without azpreaa
Congressional approval. Nv determined
purtio.se, however, is to lie in a position
so that when danger to American lives
and property in Mexico threatens and the
existing Government is rendered help
lessly by the insurrection I can promptly
execute Congressional orders to protect
iMm, with effect.
"T sincerely hope that this expnrlonoe
will always he remembered by the army
and navy as a useful means of educa
tion, and I should be greatly disappointed
if it resulted In any injury or disaster
to our forces from any cause. I have
taken a apod deal of responsibility in
ordering this mobilization, but I am ready
to answer for it if only you and those under

to this occurrence was not due to a lack

I have taken occasion in the past to em-
phasiae moat strongly the Importance
'I i1 should tie attributed to the consum

In considerir. i th ratification of the con -vent

there rests with the I'nited Stntee the
heavy responsibility of the fact that their
rejection here might destroy the progrer-s
made and consign the republics concerned
to atill deeper submergence in bank

The aist year has been marked in our

of two Important International loans,

of the currency reform to which China
was pledged by treaties with the I'nited
States, dri-at Britain and Japan, of which
mention was made in my last annual

While of immense importance in
I'self, the reform nontemplated In

FORP.IOtt TRAI'E RELATION OF THB ruYITF.n
BTATK8.
In my last annual message I referred
to the tariff negotiations of the Depart
ment of State with foreign countries
In connection with the application, by a
series of proclamations, of the minimum
tariff of the I'nited States to Importations
from the several countries, and 1 state I
that, in its general operation, section '.'
of the new tariff law had proved a
guaranty of continued commercial peace,
although there were, unfortunately, in
stances where foreign Governments dealt
arbitrarily with American Interests within
their Jurisdiction in a manner injurious
and inequitable I hiring the past year
some instances of discriminatory treat
ment havo been removed, but I regret
to say that there remain a few oases of
different lal treatment adverse to the I
commerce of the United Htates.
While the double tcrifl feature of the I
! tariff law of ltpifl has been amply Justified
bv the results achieved in removing for
nier and preventing new undue dis
criminations against American commerce, j
it. ia believed that the time has come for
tha amendment of this feature of the.
, law in such way as to provide a graduated
means of meeting varying degrees of
! discriminatory treatment of American
commerce in foreign countries, as well
as to protect the financial interests abroad
I of American citizens against arbitrary
and injurious treatment on the part of
foreign Oovernnieiits through either leg-
! islative or administrative measures.
It would also seem desirable that the
minimum tariff of the I'nited States
I should embrace within its purview the
I free list, which is not thecaseot the ores
lent time, in order thut it might nave
I reasonable significance to the (iovern
i iiienls of those countries from which the
importations into the I'nited States are
confined virtually to articles on the free
list.

There is widespread appreciation ex
pressed by the business interests of the
country ns regards the practical value
of the facilities now offered by the Pe
partmenl of state and the Department
'f Commerce and Labor for the further
ance of American Commerce Confer
ences with their officers at Wnahiugtnn
who have an expert knowledge of trade
conditions in foreign countries and with
consular officers and commercial agents
of th" Department of Commerce and
Labor who. while on leave of absence,
visit the principal industrial centres of
the I'nited Stales, have been found of
great value
As I have Indicated, it is Increasingly
clear that to obtain and p aintain that
e-piiiy and substantial equality of treat
ment essential to the flourishing foreign
trade, whioh becomes year by vear more
important to Ihe industrial and com
mercial welfare of the I'nited States,
we should have a flexibility of tariff
sufficient for the give and take of nego
tiation by the Department of State on
behalf of our commerce and industry,
l RTINO NFtP FOR AMERICAN MERCHANT j
MARINE
1 need hardly reiterate the conviction
that there ah mid speedily be built up an
American merchant marine. This Is 1
ns essarv to assure favorable transporta
tion facilities to our grest ocean-borne
commerce aa well aa to supplement the
navy with an adequate reserve of ships
and men. It would have the economic
advantago of keeping at home part of
the vast sums now paid foreign shipping
for carrying American goods All the'
great commercial nations pay heavy '
sulisidies tp their merchsnt marine, so
that it is obvious that without some wise
aid from the Congress the I'nited States
must lag behind in the matter of merchant
marina In its present anomalous position.

legislation to facilitate the ejtenaion '

is another matter In which our foreign
trade needs assistance
i Ramhers of foreion commerce sro-
CESTEn
The interests of our foreign commerce
are non partisan, and as a factor in pros
!erity are as broad as the land In the
dissemination of useful information and
m the coordination of effort certain un
official associations have done good work
toward the promotion of foreign com
merce It is cause for regret, however, I
that the great number of sach assicis
tions and the comparative lack of co
operation between them fails to secure
an efficiency commensurate with the
public interest Through the agency of
the Iiepartment of Commerce and l abor,
and in some cases directly, the Depart
ment of State transmits to reputable
business in'erests information of com
mercial opportunities, supplementing ths
regular published consular reporta Some
central organization in touch with as
sociations and chambers of commerce
throughout the country and able to keep
purely American interests in closer touch
with different phases of 00 m me It ill
affairs would. I believe, be of great v alue.
Such organization might be managed by a
committee composed of a small number
of those now actively carrying on the
work of soma of the Isrger associations,
and there might be added tothecommittee
as members ex officio one or two officials
of the Department of State and one or two
officials from the Department of Coin,
mere a and Itbor and represents! ivea of
'he appropriate committees of Congress
I he authority and success of such an or
ganization would evidently lie enhanced
if the Congress should see fit to prescribe
its scope and organization through legis
lation which would give to it some such
official standing as that, for example, of
thS National Ked (Toss.
With these factors and the continuance
of the foreign service establishment (de
part mental, diplomatic and consular i
upon the high plane where it has been,
placed by the recent reorganization, this '
(k)vernment would be abreast of the times
in fostering the interests of its foreign
trade, and the rest must be left to the
energy snd enterprise of our business
men.
IMPROVEMENT OF THB FOREION SERVICE, j
The entire foreign service organization
is being improved and developed with
cspeciairegard to the requirements of ihe
commercial interests of the country Ths
rapid growth of our foreign trade makes
it of the utmost Importance that govern- '
mental agonciea through which that j
trade is to be aided and protected should
possess a high degree of efficiency.
I therefore again commend to the favor-,
able action of tne Congress the enactment 1
of a law applying to the diplomatic and j
consular service tne principles embodied
in section 17&S ot the Revised Statutes of
'he United States, in the civil service act !
of Jan. lfl, 1888, and the Executive orders
of June 27, 1800, and of Nov. 28, 190B. In
ita consideration of this important suhjeot
I desire to recall to the attention of ths '
Congress the very favorable report made
on the Iiowden bill for the improvement
of the foreign service by the Foreign
Affairs Committee of the House of Kepre- j
sentatives. Available statistics show the j
strictness with which the merit ay stem
hi- been applied to the foreign service
during recent years aud ths absolute non-1
partisan selection of consuls and diplo
matic service secretaries who Indeed far
from being selected with any view to
political consideration have actually been
chosen to a disproportionate extent from
States whioh would have been unrepre
sented in the foreign service under the
system which it ia to be hoped is now
permanently obsolete. Home legislation
for the perpetuation of the praaant system
of examinations and promotions upon
merit and efficiency would be of greatest
value to our commercial and International
interests. Wtl, H. Taft.

license plan, including a Government
commission to regulate corporations,
even to the extent of fixing prices. Judge
Gary s testimony contained interesting
predictions as to the effect on the Steel
Corporation and on the public if the Gov
ernment's dissolution suit against the
trust is sucoesaful.
Senator Pomerene of Ohio took the
witness in hand The Senator was evi
dently linking for "watered stock "
He asked Judge Gary ss to ths value
of the original investment by the United
States Steel Corporation in the plants
of ths constituent companies.
"1 can't tell," replied Judge Gsry. "I
haven't ths figures at hand. But I think
I can answer you in a way that will sat
isfy you On the basis of the original
cost of the companies takon by the I'nited
states stA'-ei Corporation our company
is overcapitalized.
"Based on its original cost, the I'nited
States Steel Corporation itself was over
capitalized But on the basis of actual
value at the time of the formation, and
taking into consideration the amount
tliat would have leen reqiUred to repro
duce the constituent properties I do
not believe they were overcapitalized.
I may I mistaken. The Bureau of Cor
porattons has found that we were over
capitalized about five or six hundred
million dollars. But In their report they
admit that they make no allowance for
va!uo of ore property oi other ruw prod
ucts over their original cost, and every
body knows this is not a correct estimate.
The Bureau of Corporations reports ad
mit that, taking the value of the ore and
coal properties as they exist at present
or at the time the I nited StatesSteel Cor
poration was formed, the properties are
not overcapitalized "
"How much new capital was put Into
'he I'nited States Steel Corporation when
II was formed '" inquired Senator Pom-1
ereae.
"About 125,000.000 new money, as I
remember." replied Judge Gary.
If the I25.0ii0.0iin has been distributed!
among the constituent companies and I
applied to improvements, could they
nut have made the same trade extensions
and worked the same economies in pro
duction ihat the I'nited States Steel
Corporation has accomplished:'" asked,
Mr Pomerene
"That question is easier to ssk than to
answer." replied Judge Gsry "Tiia I
demonstration of the matter is, however,
that In it1! the production of the com-j
panies was son.oou tons, while it is now
OVST 2.000,000 tons a year
The witness told how the Steel Corpora
tion maintained a reserve fund of $75 -(MKi.floO
w hich was drawn on as the occasion
required to meet the needs of the sub
sidiary plants as exigencies might re
quire. So much ready capital could not
be commanded by the constituent com
panies acting Independently, the witness
said, and that was one of the advantages
of the combination. Besides operating
separately the companies would probably
need twice aa much capital.
"Looking over the history of the steel I
and iron trade," asked Senator Pomerene. I
"was there not a gradual Increase of busi- i
neas by the independent companies before
the consolidation that oomparea favorably
with the growth since?"
"I think uot," replied Judge Gary, who
in reply to a further question declared
that the independente could not havo
taken care of the dnmsattc demand for
iron and ateei. to aay nothing of the for
eign trade.
Then tha Ohio Senator called for a
little history of the organization of the I
Steel Corporation.
"Was the origin of the United States I
Steel Corporation due to the then neoes- I
aities of the trade or was it the result of j
a financial combination rather than for
manufacturing purposee?"
"No doubt there were individuate con.
neeted with some of the subsidiaries
and also in the United states steel Cor
poration who were influenced by financial
considerations," said Judge Gary. "I
was president of the Federal Steel Com
pany, composed of companies not then
competing. It was the largest of its
kind at that time. We were practising
a policy that the United States SteiM
has since carried ron. It waa evident
to my mind that our company waa too
limited in its financial resources to take
care of the growing business offered.
The United States Steel Corporation waa
started for these reasons.
"After Mr. Carnegie offered to sell
to J. P. Morgan Mr. Morgan sent his
partner to me and I had a meeting with
Sir. Morgan, at which I told him I be
lieved that if he could furniah the capital
a general organisation could be made a
success. Mr. Morgan approved and the
result was the organization of the Steel
Corporation. The leading and controll
ing motive was to form a corporation
large enough to command the necessary
capital to meet the growing business
and to benefit the public, and it waa
never intended loin. Inimoal to anv one.
"I do not deny that some members i
of the syndicate made large profits, hut I
they incurred some risk and performed i

to say that the organization of the Steel
Corporation was a Wall Street exploita
tion. I do nut thiuk il immodest for me
to say that we havo lived up to the motive
which impelled this organization. I am
therefore in a position to come before
this tribunal and to say that if we have
done any wrong I um sorry for it and 1
am here to advocate the passage of a law
to get us right and protect the public "
Judge Garv pointed out the uncertain
ties of the fmSrTOan law Re said it had
been a disputed point as to just what con
slituted a monopoly or u restraint ol
trade within the law. The decision
of the Supreme Court In the Knight
sugar cases made it doubtful if manu
facturing companies came within the
law at all as lieing engaged In inter
state commeriss. He saia the public
sentiment, alarmed by the increase of
wealth, had forced a construction of tha
law that ought not otherwise ever have
lieen reached.
Senator Brandegee asked a number
of important questions. Answering the
Senator. Judge Gary said his company
controlled ti per cent, of the export trade
snd 45 per cent, of the domestic trade
"Can the independent steel companies
that compete with vou manufacture as
cheaply as you can?
"1 think not." was the reply.
"You could undersell them and still
mske a profit?" j
Judgo Gary replied in the affirmative
"Suppose the court decrees tliat the
United States Steel Corporation is in re
straint of trade snd that Ihe corporation
shall dissolve into three component iarts
one to include transportation, another
ore properties and other raw material
and another manufacturing. What effect
would that have upon Ihe price of steel
products compared with present prices?"
"The effect would be to increase the
cost of production and of course increase
prices." X-
"Then you think the public gets better
results under the present conditions'"
"I have no doubt of it."
"And the further the court goes in de
ereeing disintegration the worse it is
for the consumer?"
"Thst is so." replied the witness.
Senator Brandegee asked Judge Gary
what course he would pursue if the com
mission should demand as a condition
precedent to the issuance ol a license
that the Steel Corporation gei rid of the
water In its stock.
"How would you go about ge'ting the
water out''"
"That is a question that I would ask
the commission.' replied Judge Gary
with a smile.
On further questioning he admitted
it would ise.m Impossibility for the i nited
Ststes Steel Corporation, if required to
do so by Federal authorty. to call in and
retire its common stock He suggested
that if the Federal license were authorised
and a commission created n would be
necessary to make a different rule for
corporations already organised from
that applicable to corporal ions forming
Replying to questions put by Senator
Gore, judge Gary expressed doubt that ,
the decrees of the court in the Tobacco ;
and Standard Oil oases would result in the
restoration of competition among thai
conatituents of that corporation He
added that he did not believe the decisions
of the court would result in the reduction
of prices on commodities handled by the
Tobacco and Standard Oil companies.
"Do you lielleve any law can lie uissed
that would make corporations compete
tliat do not want to compete'-" asked
Senator Oore.
"I do not," replied Judge Gary
Judge Gary reiterated his tielief that
overcapitalization was an evil that should
lie oorrooted by the Government. Judge
Gary said he approved the Iowa law,
which prohibited the sale of commodities
In one section lower than in another sec
tion. He thought such a rule should be .
