Senator I'roctor was surprised to read In
it Washington paper that he was to erect a
palatial marble residence on K street, to
cost $200,000, exclusive of the land. He
says that while he Is contemplating the
erection of a house in Washington, the
plans are by no means completed, and
when they are, they will not be for a house
that can be called either palatial or extrav
agant. Senator Morgan, chairman of the Sen
ate committee on foreign relations, In his
addresses before the Nicaragua!! canal con
vention at New Orleans, I .a., said the pres
ent Senate bill, providing for the Indorse
ment of 10O,0O0,O00 bonds, should be
pressed to the passage, and that the canal
company was willing to give to the govern
ment of the United States $70,000,000 of
the bonds in order to lodge the control of
the canal In Washington.
In view of the prevalence of hog chol
era at Taftsvllle, and Springfield Gov. Ful
ler has appointed from the members of the
board of agriculture Chas. M. Wlnslow of
ltraudon, Homer W. Vail of Pomfrct,
Joseph I.. Hills of Burlington to act as
cattle commissioners until the lirst of Feb
ruary, 180:1, when the law abolishing the
oilier, of cattle commissioner and transfer
ring their duties to the board of agriculture
goes into effect.
Congress lit NeaMloli.
Congress assembled on Monday, and
President Harrison's annual message was
delivered on Tuesday," The document en
tire Is of great length, discussing in the
most thorough manner all the general af
fairs and Interests of the country. Our
abstract contains a careful summary of Its
points of leading concern. No mote strik
ing and effective plere ot writing was ever
done in a state paper than that In which the
President shows the wonderful growth In
national wealth, the Increase In wages, In
the product of manufactured articles, and
In the savings of our people during the
past ,10 years. This unexampled prosper
ity Mr. Harrison believes to be due to the
Republican policy of protection, and In a
firm, strong way, undismayed by political
reverse in the November election, Mr.
Harrison declares his belief in the wisdom
of that policy. Mr, Harrison takes for
granted that the political overturn means
a change in that policy, and he recom
mends that the whole subject of tariff re
vision be left to the Incoming Congress.
The discussion of our shipping Interests,
of the Bering sea difficulty, aud of our
foreign relations generally, Is careful and
complete. The President urges that such
support be given to the company engaged
In the construction of tho Nicaragua canal
as will insure the early completion of that
Important waterway. Once more he asks
in a sober, dignified and uupartlsan spirit,
why men of all parties should not agree to
"eonie together upon the high plane of
patriotism to devise methods that shall se
cure the right of every man qualified by
law to cast a free ballot and give to every
such ballot an equal value in choosing our
public officers and in directing the policy
of the government."
In tho Senate Mr. II 111 of New Yoik,
and in the House Mr, Williams of Massa
chusetts, have introduced bills looking
toward the repeal of tho present Sherman
law for tho government purchase of silver.
Mr. Harter of Ohio has Introduced In the
House a bill for the repeal of tbe present
sugar bounty law anil to provide In Its
place a uniform duty of one-half cent per
pound upon all imported sugar.

A eomparii-on of the exMIng con ditions with
those of the moat favoied period In the history
of the country will, I believe, show that so high a
degree of prosperity and so general a (IIITuiion of
the cmnfoits of life Here never before enjoyed
by our people.

Oilier Inillcntlnus of the (.rlirrnl
Pronjierlly
or the country are found In the fact that the num

There neer has been a time In our history when
work wan so abundant or when wages Here as
high, nhether measured bvthe currency In which
they are paid or by their power to supply the neces
saries and comrorts or life. The value of our total
farm products has Increased from $l,303,tH6,80il in
18C0 to $4,500,000,000 in 1891. as estimated by sta
tisticians, an increase of 210 per cent.
ir any are discontented with their state here:
ir any lieheve that uages or prices, the returns of
honest tod, are Inadequate, they should not fall
to remember that there is no other country in the
world where the conditions that seem to them
hard would not be accepted as highly prosperous.
The English agriculturist would be glad to ex
change the returns of his labor for those of the
American fanner, and the Manchester workmen
their wages for those ot their renown at Kail
Klver.
I lielievethat the protective system, which has
now ror something more than SOyears continuous
ly prevailed in our legtH'alion, has lieen a mighty
Instrument for the development of our nntinnal
Health, and a mostpoHerful agency In protecting
the homes of our Horkinginen from the Invasion
of want. 1 have felt a most solicitous interest to
preserve to our working people rates of wages
that would not only give dally bread but supply a
comfortable margin for those home attractions
and family comfoits and enjoyments without
which lite is neither hopeful nor sweet.
They are American citizens. a part of the great
ieople for whom our constitution and govenv
ment were framed and Instituted and it cannot
lie a !erversion of that constitution to so legislate
as to preserve In their homes the comfort. Inde
pendence, loyalty, and sense of interest in the
government which are essentiAl to good citizen
ship in ieace. and which will bring this stalwart
throng, as in 18il, to tiie defence of the tlag when
It is assnllel.
The CliniiRr of l'ollry.
1 recommend that the whole nibject of tariff
revls'on bo left to the Incoming Congress. It Is a
matter of regret that this work must lie delayed
for at least three months: for the threat of great
tariff changes Introduces so much uncertainty
that an amount, not easily estimated, of business
inaction and of diminished pioductlon will nec
essarily result.
It Is (Kisslble also that this uncertainty may re
sult in decreawsl revenues from customs duties,
for our merchants will make cautious orders for
foreign goods In view of the prosiect or tarilf re
ductions and the uncertainty as to when they will
take effect. Those who have advcattd a pro
tective tariff cun well afford to have their disss
Irons forecasts of a change or iwlicy disappointed.
U a system or customs duties can ho framed that
will set the idle wheels and looms of Europe In
motion und crowd our warehouses with, foreign
made goods, and at the same time keep our mills
busy; that will give us an Increased participation
hi the "markets or the world," or greater value
tha the home market we surrender; that will
give increased work to foreign workmen upon
products to be consumed by our people without
diminishing the amount ot work to be done here;
that will enable the American manufacturer to
pay to his workmen from .V) to 100 ier cent more
In wages thtin is paid in the foreign mill and yet
to compete in our market and in foreign markets
with the foreign producer; that will further re
duce the cost of articles of wear and food without
reducing the wages of those who produoe them;
that can lm celebrated after Its effects have been
realized, as its expectation has been In European
as well as in American cities, the authors and
promoters of it will be entitled to the highest
praise.
We have had In our history several experiences
of the contrasted effects of a revenue, and of n
protective tariff, but this generation has not felt
them and the experience of oue generation Is not
highly Instructive to the next. The friends of
the urotective system, with undiminished confi
dence in the principles they have advocated, will
await me results oi ine new experiment.
The President holds that the wage earners may
nave ueen mmienceu uy me strnineu relations ex
isting between them and their employers. dlsre
gardiug the fact that their wages are the highest
paiu in ine worm, iney may now be able to re
view tile operation ot the tariff for revenue In the
light of experience, and If it proves that their
nagesaie as good as or better than heretofore,
I everyone will rejoice.
The society of the unemployed, now holding its
frequent and threatening luirudcs in thestreetsuf
foreign cities, should not In' allowed touci)uhe an
American domicile.
The Work of the Administration.
The reports of the heads of the several execu
tive departments, which are heiewith submitted,
B&kmgg
Powder
have very naturally Included n resume of the
whole work of the administration w ilh the trans
actions of the last fiscal year
The attention, not onl or Congress hut of the
eoiintn , is again invited to the methods or ndn. lo
tion which have been puisiieit and to the results
which have li-eu ettalned Public: revenues
amounting to $1,41 (.079 S92 W lia'e been collected
and dislmiH-'d without los from misappropria
tion, without a single defalcation f such Impor
tance as to attract the public ait-'ntion and at
a diminished jier cent of cost ror coMtctlon
The public husintss has been transacted, not
only ulth tldellty, but progressively and with a
view to giving to the s-oplein the fullest possible
degree tiie benefits of a service established and
ni'ilnlained for their protection aud comfort.
Our relations with other nations are now mulls
turhed by any seiimis controversy. The compli
cated and threatening differences with (lerinany
and England relating to Sainnan affairs, with
Ennland lu relation to the seal fisheries in the
llerli.g sea, and with Chill growing opt of the
Baltimore affair have been adjusted.
Heferenc Is made to the different commercial
agreements for reciprocal trade, and ot the fact
that the full lieneflts of these arrangements enn
not lie realized Instantly, although already there
have been remarkable gains. The president
doubts not that within a abort period we shall
secure one-third of the total trade of the coun
tries or Central and South America, which now
amounts to about $000,000,000 annually. In 18M
we had only eight (er cent of the trade.
Itrrllig Hra Treaty and Cnlimlliui lttlu-
tlnns.
The matters relating to the Bering sea treaty
are carefully considered, and the President lie-lievt-s
the final result will substantially establish
our claims, and preserve this great Industry for
the benefit of all nations.
The Canadian conference and the matter of
tolls In the Canadian and American canals is
given considerable attention, anri the president
regrets that in many of the controversies, notahly
tliose as to the fisheries on the Atlantic, the seal
ing Interests on the I'acillc, and the canal tolls,
our negotiations with (Ireat Britain have contin
uously been thwarted or retarded by unreason
able and unfriendly objections and protests fioin
Canada lu the matter of the canal tolls, our
treaty rights were tlagrutitly disregarded
It Is time for us. however, to consider whether,
if the present state of things Is to continue, our
Interchanges UKn lines of land transsrtstion
should not lie put upon a different basis, and our
entire indejieudtnce of Canadian canals and of
the St. Iaw rence as an outlet to the seaiecured
by the construction of an American canal around
the falls of Niagara and the opening of ship com
munication Is-lween the great lakes aud one of
our own seaports.
We should nothesllate toavall ourselves of our
great natural trade advantages We should with

peat w ith great earnestness the recommendation
whhh I have made in several previous messages
that prompt and adequate support be given to
the American company engaged In the construe
tion of the Nicaragua ship canal. It is Impossible to
overstate the value from every standpoint of this
great enterprise, and I hope that there may lie
tune, even in this Congress, to give to it an Im
petus that will insure the early completion of the
canal anil secure to the United States its proper
relation to it when completed.

The l'ostnl Service.
The report or the postmaster general shows a
most gratifying increase and a most efficient and
progressive management or the great business of
that department. The remarkable Increase In
revenues. In the number of post offices, and In the
miles of tnall carriage furnishes run her evidence
or the high state of prosierlty which our iieople
are enjoying.
The postal revenues have increased during tbe
last year $3,000,000. The deficit for the year end
lug June 30, IKfi, Is $818,311 less than the deficiency
of the preceding year.
The deficiency of the pn-sent fiscal year It Is es
timated will will be reduced to $152,421 which will
not only be extinguished during the next fiscal
year but a Burplus of uearly $1,000,000 Bbould
then be shown. There have been added 1590 new
mall routes during the year with a mileage of
8.VI3 mih'S. The number of post-offices has been
increased by i!7U0 during the year.
For the three years ending June 30. 1892. the
postal revenue amounted to $197,741,339, which
was an Increase of $32..1sl,150 over the revenue
for the three ears ending June 30, 1888, the In
crease during the last three years b ing more
than three and a hair times as great as tje In
crease during the three years ending June 30,
18A8. No such increase as that shown for these
three years has ever previously appeared In the
revenues of the departmeut.
The Shipping 1'rublrm.
Ever since our merchant marine was driven
from the sea by the rebel cruisers during the war
of the llebelllon the United States, has been pay
ing an enormous annual tribute to foreign coun
tries in the shaie of freight aud passage moneys.
Our grain and meats have been taken at our own
docks and our large Imports there laid down by
foreign shipmasters. An lucreaslng torrent ot
American travel to Europe has contributed a vast
sum annually to the dividends of roreign ship
ow ners.
The lialanee or trade shown by the books of our
custom houses has been very laigely reduced, and
In many years altogether extinguished by this
constant drain. In the year 1892 only 12 3 per
celt or our imports were brought m American
vessels. These great foreign steamships main
tained by our trade are many of them under con
tracts with their respective governments, by
which In time or ar they will become a part of
their armed naval establishments.
fronting by our commerce in p-aee they will
become the most formidable destroyers or our
commerce in time of war. I have felt and have
before expressed the feeling that this condition
of tbinirs was both Intolerable and disgraceful. A
wholesome jchatige or policy and one having in It
much promise, as it seems to me. was begun by
tbe law of March 3, 1891 Under this law contracts
have heeu made by the postmaster general for
eleven mail routes, i ne cxpenuuure invoivea ov
these contracts for the next fiscal year approxi
mates $915,12:1.
Asoue of tho results already reached 10 Ameri
can steamships of an aggregated tonnage of 5",
400 tons, costing $7,400,000, have been built or con
tracted to lie built in American shipyards.
No subject, I think, more nearly touches the
nrlde. the power, and the Dro9Per ty of our couu
try than this of th- development of our merchant
marine upon the sea. It we could enter Into con
ference with other competitors and all would
atrreu to withhold government aid. we could, per
haps, take our chances with the rest, but our great
competitors have established and maintained
their lines by government subsidies until now
thev have practically excluded us from partici
pation, In my opinion, no choice is left to us but
to pursue, moderately at least, the same lines.

The passage of what is know n as the disability

the annual disbursements to the disabled veter

I adhere to the views expressed In previous
messages that tbe care of the disabled soldiers
of the war ot thu Rebellion Is a matter of national
concern and duly. Perhaps no emotion cools
sooner than that of gratitude, but I cannot believe
that Ibis process has jet reached a point with our

liiale agencies provided by local laws.

Conclusion.
This exhibit of the work of the executive de
partments is submitted to Congress and to tho
public in tiie hope that there will be found In it a
due sense of responsibility, and an earnest pur
pose to maintain the national honor, and to pro
mote the happiness and prosperity of all our peo
pl. And this brier exhibit of the growth and
prosperity of the country will give us a level
from which to note the increase or decadence that
new legislative policies may bring to us.
There Is no reason why the national influence,
pow er and prosperity should not observe the same
rates of increase that have characterized tbe past
30 jears. We carry the great Impulse and In
crease of these years Into the future.- There is no
reason wny In many lines or production we should
not surpass all other nations as we have alreiuiv-
done In some.
There are no near frontiers to our possible de
velopment. Itetrogresslon would be a crime.
BENJAMIN UAKIilSON.
Executive Mansion, December o, 1892.
A Wise Change.
In view of the severe, and often con
temptuous criticism, which many people
affect to visit on the voters of New Eng
land, with all their supposed Intelligence,
for the blunders which they rnake'in the
use of the secret ballot law, the Boston
Journal makes a suggestion which is worth
noting. It Is the fashion to say that In
far-away Australia, where the system orig
inated, and In England, there Is no trouble
In its use, while in America, tbe land of
free schools and universal education, the
otcrs blunder in the most Ignorant and
persistent way. The fact is, however, that
the English voter knows nothing of the
complicated ballot which the American
otcr must handle in case of a national,
state anil local election all In one. Tho
English elector has a ballot given him
containing usually not more than two
names, and which scarcely permits any
mistake to be made, while the American
voter must wrestle with a ballot as big,
often, as a good-sired newspaper, with a
bewildering confusion of candidates.
The .Journal's point Is well taken, as wo
have said. When one considers what a
task It is for the man of average intelli
gence, who has little or no experience in
clerical work of any kind, to perform the
ordinary task of properly executing a legal
document, or of even writing a letter and
signing his name, it Is no wonder that he
becomes muddled and confused when lie
feels himself on exhibition in a public way,
with a ballot lu his hands containing 20,
r0 or 100 names, from which he is asked
to sort out aud mark the names of those
he wishes to vote for. Under tills state of
things, which casts no discredit on the or
dinarily intelligent voter, we believe our
present Vermont legislature has acted
wisely in providing that hereafter the
names of party candidates shall be ar
ranged in separate columns, and tho mark
ing of a single cross be sufficient for the
voter who wishes to cast a straight ticket.
The secrecy of the ballot and its general
principle have been fully maintained, and
this change will not weaken them in any
way.
