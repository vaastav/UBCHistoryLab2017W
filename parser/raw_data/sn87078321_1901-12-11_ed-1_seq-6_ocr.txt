SECRETARY INVESTIGATING.
Brlbory and Collusion Between
porters and Clique of Federal
Employes In New York.
Im-
Knowledge of another plgnntte sys
tem of fraud In the New York custom
house lias reached tho President nnd
tho Secretary of the Treasury almost
Hlmiiltaneounly and Is the Biibjoot of
Investigation by special agents. Tho
evidence so far Is conclusive of wide
spread collusion nnd conspiracy. In
the rune under Investigation tho gov
ernment hns been cheated through
bribery of custom otllclnls by import
ers when a largo Invoice of goods
comes Into tho port of New York. It
Is tho custom if there nrd, for In
stance, 10 cases of goods, to have one
of them selected nnd sent to tho ap
praisers' stoics for examination anil
appraised. Upon the value and
weight of this saniplo rase depend:!
the amount of duty to be paid on tho
whole Invoice. Fraud Is only possi
ble In having some particular case
selected as a sample which contains
articles of less weight or of an In
ferior quality. TIiIb Is Whnt Is al
leged to havo been dono In numerous
Instances In the New York custom
house. Such a thing could not be
accomplished without collusion be
tween several persona In the custom
liottso. perhaps half a dozen. One
firm who managed to evado duties In
another way. profited at least $iioo,ooo
a year. Tho extent of fraud Is only
limited by tho number of Importers
whom those carrying on tho Bchemo
would feel safe In approaching. How
long It has been going on, treasury au
thorities do not know. It la learned
that In tho matter of the selection of
tho sample case of goods for apprals
metit, the amount of the bribe In each
Instance was trlvnl, not often exceed
ing f'.W for each selection. Thus, for
a small amount, Importers In some
cases saved many thousands of dollars
on a small Invoice. Secretary (lage
Is determined to rout out the ring that
hns been nt work. Tho matter ban
also reached President Roosevelt and
he Is giving It blu personal attention.

DELAY HOLIDAY GOODS.
Congestion of Traffic and Labor Con
troversies Impede Busi
ness Advances.
It. O. Dun & Co.'s Weekly Review
of Trade says: Current trade is of
ample dimensions, but traffic conges
tion grows worso, and labor contro
versies add to the embarrassment of
shippers. If consignments of fancy
goods for the holidays trade are de
layed much longer there will be seri
ous loss. Prices of commodities
tend upward. Although nominal quo
tations of Iron and steel are un
changed, figures refer only to future
deliveries, and In most cases prices
for recurrent shipments command a
considerable premium. Since this
margin Is Influenced by local condi
tions at the various mills and furna
ces, besides being further complicated
by scarcity of freight cars and strikes.
It Is almost Impossible to arrive at a
fairly representative price level. In
general, however, the tone Is distinct
ly firmer, with especial scarcity of
billets in further importations. Steel
rail mills are still accepting orders
with their capacity engaged about np
to the end of next year, and there is
much concern regarding the filling
of contracts since the lack of fuel
grows more alarming. Instead of
pig Iron production showing another
new high record on December 1,' as
was Indicated by the urgency of de
mand. It now appears probable that
a loss will he officially announced,
because coke was not available. In
stead of furnace stocks being entirely
eliminated an Increase may be re
corded since cars could not be se
cured to remove supplies. A sea
sonable Increase has occurred In the
movement of pipe, while Independent
mills have furnished sufficient com
petition In sheets and wire nails V
bring slightly lower price. Activity
and Btrength are conspicuous in the
markets for domestic wool. Coates
Pros.' circular makes the average of
lot) grades 17.51 cents, which Is the
best price recorded since May. Mak
ers of heavyweight woolens receiva
good duplicate orders, while contracts
for spring lines come forward freely. .
Footwear factories are busy on spring
goods, many having contracts for
some mouths' further occupation.
Chicago hides show a further decline,
but imported dry bides are mell sus
tained. Staple products continue ad
vancing, corn making a most sensa
tional gain. Shipments from Atlan
tic ports for the week reached the
lowest point since 1894. amounting
to only 278,215 bushels against 6,336.
715 last year. Wheat was also
advanced to tho best price of the sea
son, largely through sympathy with
corn, for which It was freely subs-tltuted.
