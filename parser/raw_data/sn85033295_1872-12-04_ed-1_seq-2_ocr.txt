WEDNESDAY, DEC. 4, 1872.
HORACE GREELEY IS DEAD.
Such is the sad intelligence that has
flashed from wire to wire all over the
land within the past few days. It
is only a few weeks since we were cal
led upon to mourn the decease of one
of the greatest statesmen of the coun
try, lion. William H. Seward, and in
quick succession follows the death of
America’s greatest editor and journal
ist, Horace Greely. As no American
citizen was mare widely known, so is
there none who will he more sincerely
and deeply regretted. He had u strong
hold on the love and affection of the
people, and not only for his intellec
tual greatness, but for the purity and
chastity of his Ijfe will he long be affec
tionately remembered by the entire
civilized world.
His disease was organic affection of
the brain, brought on by the trials,
perplexities and disappointments of
the recent political campaign, togeth
er with the loss of his wife ; a combi
nation of circumstances that but few
men, possessed of Mr. Greeley a sensi
tive natnre, could withstand.
Mr. Greeley was born in Amherst,
New Hampshire, February 3d, 1811.
His father was a farmer and Horace
having but few opportunities for
schooling presented to him he ear
ly determined to enter “the poor
boy’s college,” a printing office
When 10 years of age his parents
removed to Vermont, and here he re
mained working on the homestead un
til fifteen years of age, when he en
entered the office of the Northern Spec
tator, East Poultney. Vt., as'an ap
prentice He became the best work
man in the office and occasionally as
sisted in editing the paper. At the
age of 20 he went to Brie, Pennsylva
nia, where his parents had removed,
and worked there and at Lodi and
Jamestown, New York, as a journey
man. In 1831 he made his well known
entry into New York city, a poor
printer, and with but just ten dollars in
hie pocket. Here he worked at the
ossa till January. 1833, when he
formed a partnership with Francis
Story and established the Morning Post,
the first penny journal ever published.
It had a short life of three weeks. In
March, 1833, the New Yorker was
established by young Greeley, but this
was not a success. In 1838-39 he
edited a Whig weekly at Albany, called
Ae Jeffersonian.
During the stirring campaign of
1840 he edited the Log Cabin, a paper
which strongly advocated the election
of Harrison & Tyler. On the 10th oi
April 1841 he commenced his mem
orable career as publisher of the New
York Tribune.
In building up the New York Tri
hime he devoted the best years of his
life and the vast energies of his active
brain. Long considered one of the
G r eat papers of the world, it stood a
monument of Horace Greeley's ability
and industry. He said of it; “My
aim was to make the Tribune a jour
nal that should express its editors’ con
victions fearlessly and forcibly, yet
not be the organ of any clique. That
It should h liberal without indifference
•nd open to the reception and recogni
tion of truth, even from an unfriendly
source.”
Although actively engaged his whole
life in the political field, with the ex
ception of a short term he served in
Congress from December, Ist, .1848, un
til March 4th, 1849, he never held office.
While in Congress he devoted him
self principally to attacking the abuses
of the mileage system.
He often lectured on subjects affect
ing the welfare of the laboring classes,
and published his lectures and essays
in 1860, in a volume entitled “Hints
Toward Reforms.” In 1851, he visited
Europe, and was one of the jourymen
it the Crystal Palace Exhibition. He
published a volume entitled “Glances
•t Europe," on his return. In IBSG.
he published a “History of the Strug
gle for Slavery Extension, or Restric
tion from 1787 to 1856.”
In 1859 he visited California trave
ling overland and delivering addresses
fit the principal towns through which
he passed. In 1564 he published a
history called “The American conflict,”
•nd has since written “What I know
About Farming,” and his autobiogra
phy entitled, “Recollections of a Busy
Life.”
lie was ever the friend of the work
ingman and tor his labors in behalf of
the industrial interests of the country
yill long bo remembered.
We believe sincerely that during the
fast few months Mr. Greeley has re
proached himself for having assumed
the position of a presidential candidate
in opposition to that party of which he
had been recogized as one of the foun
tiers. He never expected the hostility
he received from his former old politi
al friends, thinking that the many
long years of his life he devoted to the
Interests and welfare of the Republican
party would shield him. Rut with all
his wisdom he never seemed to realize
that with the mass of the Republicans
their love for the old party surmounts
all considerations of a personal charac
ter they feel towards any man.
Hut tha grave must cover all his
fstaiCs an i shortcomings, Wc believe
after ad, no man has left a richer heri
tage behind Lvu than Horace Greeley,
and his name will forever remain green
in the memory of the American Re
public. In his “Busy Life” one para
graph is felicitously appropriate at this
moment:
“Fame,” said he, “is a vapor; pop
ularity an accident; riches take wings ;
the only earthly certainty is oblivion.
And yet I cherish the hope that the
journal I projected and established will
live and flourish long after I shall have
mouldered into forgotten dust, being
guided by a larger wisdom, a more
unerring sagacity to discern the right,
though not by a more unfaltering read
iness to embrace and defend it at what
ever personal cost; and that the stone
which covers my ashes may bear to
future eyes, the still intelligible in
scription, ‘Founder op the New
York Tribune.’ ”
Mr. Greeley’s funeral takes place
Wednesday, the-4th mat., from Dr,
Chapin’s Church, New York. It is
probable that Gen. Grant and members
of his cabinet, and a committee of Con
gress, will attend the funeral.
The President’s Message. —At
the re-assembling of Congress, Monday,
the 2d inst.. the annual message of
President Grant was delivered to both
houses. The document is quite lengthy,
and gives a valuable and interesting re
sume of our national affairs during the
past year, with many wise suggestions
as to the future action of Congress on
several important questions. We shill
endeavor to place the message in full
before the readers of the Republican
in our next issue.
Major Generals.—General Irvin
McDowell, Senior Brigadier General
has been appointed to tho Major-Gen
eralship, made vacant by the death of
Gen. Meade. General Hancock suc
ceeeds to Gen. McDowell’s place, and
is transferred from St. Paul to New
York. General Terry takes command
of the Department of Dacotah h Id by
General Hancock. The appointment
of Gen. McDowell indicates hat the
President does not bear the malice and
hatred to that office that has been im
puted to him.
Congress In Session.
Washington, Dec. 2. —The opening
of the third session of the Forty-third
Congress attracted a very large audi
ence, the majority of those present in
either House being ladies. There was
the usual scene in the Senate chamber
and on the fLor of the House, of mem
bers congratulating each other and dis
cussing the political condition of affairs.
The Liberal Republicans stood the
brunt of many joses by their political
friends in a composed manner
than was expected.
Both houses were called to order
promptly at meridian, and after prayer,
the rool call followed, showing a very
large attendance, many more than a
quorum.
A committee was thereupon appoint
ed to wait upon the President and noti
fy him that Congress was ready to re
ceive any message he might desire to
communicate.
The probable action of the Demo
cratic Presidential electors on Wednes
day is much talked about by the leaders
of both parties. The most prominent
Democrats say that the death of Gree
ley places them in a very embarrassing
predictment, and if iheir electors cast
their votes for any persons than the
nominees of the Baltimore Convention
there is sure to be much dissatisfaction
among the wheel-horses of the party.
The suggestion of the Tribune that the
entire vote be given to Grant is bitterly
opposed by lead'ng Democrats, and
even Senator Fenton said to-day that
he regarded the proposition as in very
bad taste.
Washington, Dec. 2.— After the
appointment of the committee to wai*
upon the President by the House, Mr.
Dawes said it was proper that Congress
should take notice of a very recent
national calamity, viz., the death of
Horace Greeley, and he therefore sub
mitted a resolution that there be placed
upon the records of the House an ap
propriate notice of the life and public
services of Mr. Greeley.
Mr Cox followed in a touching eulo
gy, and the resolution was thereupon
unanimously passed.
Gen Banks said it was proper that
the House should have at the head of
the Committee of Foreign Affairs one
;n entire sympathy with its policy, and
with the administration, which he is
not, and therefore he would ask to be
excused from serving on the committee.
Several members hoped that the
gentleman from Massachusetts would
not be excused from the committee,
bu r only from the chairmanship.
The House, by a vote of fifty-nine to
seventy-six, refused to excuse Mr.
Banks from serving on the committee
Speaker Blaine, calling Mr Cox to
the chair, took the floor, and said he
arose to a question of the highest privil
ege During the recent political can
vass, charges of corruption were made
igainst several members of the House,
Senators, and the Vice President, in
connection with the Credit Mobillier.
These changes were of such a nature
us to demand investigation, and he
would move the appointment of aspeci
al committee, which should be com
posed of a majority of those who are in
the majority in the House.
Alter some discussion the resolution
was passed, and Mr. Cox appointed
Messrs. Poland, Banks, Beck, Niblack,
and McCteery as the comittee.

France Tranquil. —Dispatches of
the 80th announce that France is tran
quil again.
On the 28th, after a long and excit
ed debate, the French Assembly by a
vote of 870 years to 844 days, approved
the resolution proposed by Minister
Dufaure, to refer to a committee of 30
the drafting of a law establishing Min
isterial responsibility, whieh was pro
posed to the Committee on Address,
but premptorily rejected in a manner
which excited gloomy anticipations,
and caused much excitement. Thus
President Thiers and bis friends hare
won a victory which has averted present
danger ot a rupture, and had a quieting
effect.

Yale’s Half Century. —The Col
lege Courant presents some interesting
statistics which show, the gratifying
growth of Yale College during the past
fifty years. The catalogue of 1822-3
shows that the College had at that time
a total of 19 officers and 283 students,
in all the departments. Ten years later
the officers numbered 25 and 507-
For the next decade the increase of offi
cers and students, though not large, was
decided ; but from 1842 to the present
the increase has been very rapid. The
f-atalogue for the present year shows 76
instructors and 904 students. During
the half century covered by these fig
ures, the standard of study has been
constantly elevated, and the material
resources of the College have greatly
increased.

HORACE GREELEY.
His Htceut Illness and EeatU.
New York, November 29. —The
Tribune furnishes the following account
of the illness and last hours of Mr.
Greeley, so far as known to any of his
associate? ;
“Mr. Greeley was in almost as good
health as usual when, on the dry after
election, he wrote a card announcing
his resumption of the editorial charge
of the Tribune. His sleeplessness was
known to have become greatly worse,
but for years he had suffered more or
less from the same difficulty, and, as is
now clear, a sufficient allowance had
not been made for the intense strain
upon him throughout the summer, es
pecially during the last month of his
wife’s illness ; but it soon became evi
dent that bis strength was unequal to
the hard task to which be set himself.
He wrote only three or four careful
articles, no one of them half a column
in length. Ti e most notable, perhaps,
was that entitled ‘Conclusions,’ wherein
he summed up Ids views of the canvass.
Tn all he wrote less than three and a
half columns after his return, contribut
ing to only four issues of the paper
Two or three times be banded his assis
tant short articles, saying, ‘There is an
idea worth using, but I haven’t felt
able to work it out properly. You had
better put it in shape.’ At last, on
Tuesday, the 12th instant, he abandon
ed the effort to visit the office, and sent
for the family physican of Mr. A. J.
Johnson, the friend with whom be was
a guest, in whose bouse his wife had
died. Every effort was made to induce
sleep, but he . rew steadily worse until
it became evident that bis cate was criti
cal. Dr. George C. Choate and, others
were called in consultation, and finally
it was decided to take him to Dr.
Choate’s residence, two or three miles
distant from Mr. Greeley’s own country
house at Chappaqua Here he receiv
ed unremitting attention from Dr.
Choate, and here Drs. Brown and Se
nuard and others were called in consul
tation. The insomnia had developed in
to inflammation of the brain, and under
this the venerated patient rapidly sank.
At times he was delirious ; at othei
times as clear-headed as ever. He lost
flesh and strength with startling rapidi
ty. and in a few days the possibility of
his speedy death forced itself into no
willing recognition. It was not, how
ever. until Thursday that his associates
and family brought themselves to admit
it, and even tl\ey i-till clung to his faith
in the vigor of his constitution. On
Wednesday night, he failed very rapid
ly. Thursday afternoon and evening
beseemed somewhat easier. During
the night he slept very uneasy, mut
tering occasionally, and frequently rais
ing his right, hand Toward morning
he was more unquien and between 8
and 9 fell into nearly unconscious con
dition, which continued, with some in
tervals, throughout the day. He made
occasional exclammations, but many of
them, in consequence of bis extreme
weakness and apparent inability to fin
ish what he began, were unintelligible.
“About noon, however, he said quite
distinctly, and w ; th some force, ‘I know
that my Redeemer li vet lx U During the
day he recognized various people. Ids
daughter many times, the members of
ids household at Chappaqua, Mr. John
Stuart, and Mr. Reid On the whole,
lie suffered little ; seemed to have no
more than the ordinary restlessness
vi hich accompanies the last stage of the
disease. During the day his extremit
ies were cold, and there was no
pulse at the wrist. The action of the
heart was very intermittent and con
stantly diminishing in force. He had
not asked for water or been willing to
drink since his stay at Dr. Choate’*s but
during Friday he asked for it frequent
ly, and up to within half an hour of the
end he manifested in various ways his
consciousness of what was going on
around him and e\ en answered in mono
syllables, and intelligently, questions
addressed to him.
“About hall-past 3 he said, very dis
tinctly, ‘lt is done/ and, beyond the
briefest answers to questions, this was
his last utterance. His youngest
daughter, Miss Gabrielle, was with him
through Thursday evening Through
out Friday the elder daughter, Miss
Ida, was in constant attendence, as she
had been during the whole of his illness
and of Mrs. Greeley’s before him. The
other members of his Chappaqua house
hold were present, with Mr, and Mrs.
John R. Stuart and a few other friends.
Nothing that science or affection could
suggest was wanting to ease the last
hours. The wintry night had fairly
set in when the inevitable hour came.
Without, the sleighs were running to
and fro, bearing to Chappaqua, the
nearest telegraph station, the latest
bulletins which the thousands of anxi
ous hearts in the great city near by
kept demanding. Within, the daught
er and a few others stood near the dy
ing man, who remained conscious, and
seemingly rational and free from pain ,
though now too weak to speak, In an
adjoining room sat one or two more
friends and the physican. At ten min
utes before 7 o’clock they drew back
in reverent stillness from the bedside
The great editor was gone in peace after
so many struggles and after so much
obloquy,”
Tennyson, Thomas Buchanan
Read, the poet-painter, was asked one
dav if he ever met Tennyson. “£
have,'’ he replied “and just after the
battle of Bull Run, Tennyson came
hastily into the club room in which I
sat, and said, ; “Great news ! the
Southrons have beaten the Yankees,
who have fled precipitately from the
field,’ I could not relish this kind of
talk from an Englishman, and replied:
—‘Well. Mr Tennyson, if the South
rons have run the Yankees from the
field, it was an American victory, any
way. It is more than your countrymen
ever did.’ Tennyson did not answer,
nor did any Briton present: The ar
row wont to its mark .”
“Tennyson I why,” said Read, “he
looks no more like a poet than does
a lobster if compared with a goldfish.
Angular, awkward w : th great hands and
feet, and coarse hair streaming away,
he is not the man that any romantic
lady would die for.”
Morton’s Response. —When Hon.
Oliver P. Morton’s election was an
nounced in joint convention of the In
diana Legislature on Wednesday, the
28th, ult. the Senator elect was present,
and in a brief speech returned his ac
knowledgements, and said : “I shall
have no motive but to do my duty to
the nation and to the State, and I hope
so to perform that dut} T that no gentle
man who voted for me yesterday will
ever have cause to blush or regret it.”
Not a New Thing.— ln a recent
lecture by Prolessor James Law. of Cor
nell University, on the “'Horse Disease,”
be said ;
The disease is by no means anew one.
Between 415 and 412 B. C. a similar
disease raged in Greece, Italy,and Sici
ly. It has occurred in A. D. 320,870,
1173, 1250, 1290 (then especially se
vere), 6 times in the fourteenth centary,
39 times in the fifteenth, twice in th# ■
sixteenth, 15 times in the eighteenth,
and 17 times in the nineteenth thus
f ar —probably not more frequently in
later times, but apparently so from the
lack of full records earlier. Sometimes
it has especially attacked horses, dogs,
cats, and oxen, and sometimes man.
It is essentially an influenza. After in
fection, from one to three days inter
vene before its appearance. Its symp
oms are sudden. They differ accord
ing to the parts attacked aud the severi
ty of the attacks. Sometimes the dis
ease confines itself to the throat, some
times to the parts of the neck further
back, sometimes to the lungs, sometimes
to the digestive organs, aud sometimes
to the tendons and muscles, when it is
rheumatic in its form. A common
symptom of all these forms is great
weakness and prostration, indisposition
to move, half closed eyes, relaxed limbs,
staggering, dec. The present manifesta
tion is largely that of the throat, anti is
attended by coughing.
The New York. Tribune. —The
old rumor that Vice President Colfax
will become editor in-chief of the New
York Tribune upon the expiration of
his term is again revived. It is no
secret that his name hag been consider
ed in that connection by the Trifmne
stockholders.
Insured' —Horace Greeley's lif is
reported insured for $100,000; tat the
benefit of the Tribune Association.

A Reliable Republican Newspaper
rpHE CHICAGO EVENING JOURNAL,
1 with its Daily, Weekly and Tri-Weekly
editions, for 1873 will lie found, as hereto
fore, independent in thought and action,
and as free to criticise all public men and

Asa representative of the free public pr*s9
of a republican country, it will continueto
be, as for nearly thirty years it bus been, a
trustworthy exponent of popular feeling and
popular rights, and a prompt and reliable
medium of all the news of the duy trom
every part of the country and the world, by
telegraph and the mails.
THE JOURNAL’S political status is to a
well understood to need a word ot explana
tion. It is Republican, firmly, consistently
and uncompromisingly, believing, a? it does,
that the Republican party has redeemed tho
Nation from the dangers of treason and re
bellion and Irom the dishonor of slavery,
and that the country’s best hopes and in
terests depend upon its continued ascenden
cy in the Government.
THE JOU RNAL has a special representa
tive at the National Capital, as well as at all
news centers East and West, who will, iu
special dispatches and letters, keep out
readers fully informed upon all matters or
interest throughput the country.
We expect soon to occupy our new build
ing, when, with superior printing facilities,
and an enlarged paper, we shall endeavor
to merit the support and retain the confi
dence a generous public has hitherto so lib
erally extended.

published at 3 and 5 o'clock every afternoon
Sundays excepted.

ing all the news ot two days, is published
every other day—Tuesdays, Thursdays and
Saturdays.

mercial paper is published every Wednes
day morning, and is one of the best and
most popular Weekly papers in the North
west.
