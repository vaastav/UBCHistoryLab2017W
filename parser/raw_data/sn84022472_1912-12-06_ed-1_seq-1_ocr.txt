ing River in Roadway ,
Mayor C. B. Wilson took; an auto
ride down Fairfield avenue from the
source of the Connecticut company
river at Park avenue to its mouth at
Main street. His honor- wanted to
find out if conditions were as bad as
folks painted them. He found out.
The mayor was the object ball In
b, series of flve-eushion shots as the
car hit the ridges and gullies in the
center of the thoroughfare. He was
- axoomed from the back seat of the
car to a position jnst north of the
steering wheel as ths car hit the first
bump. Immediately afterwards he
-was thrown for a three-yard loss to
the rear seat cushion as the car
climbed the terrace that separates the
paved portions of the street from the
the valley in which the car tracks
are located.
His honor was a busy man during
the trip. When Main street was
reached, it was discovered that he had
been jostled into a sitting position on
every part of the car except the crank
erase and the tail lamp. He may
make another trip soon and take in
the two places that were overlooked
in order that his record may be clean.
As toon as he recovered from the
excitement of the death-defying trip,
the mayor got into communication
with Supt- C.H. Chapman, of the Con
necticut company. The superintend
ent declined an invitation to make an
Inspection trip, as he has been over
the road on his own cars and knows
what an auto ride on the street must
be like.
Mr. Chapman heard the mayor's
tale of existing condition and he
promised that they would be remedied
as soon as he can get men to do the
work- The railway company is going
to raise its rails (grooved rails, too)
to the grade set by the city engineer
and will macadamize the roadway be
tween the tracks. This will be done
as soon as possible, Mr. Chapman says,
ind the street made as nearly open
for traffic as possible. There will be
so skating on the river this winter, as
i result.

Bull Moose Leader Will Not Get
a Reappointment, Rumor
Has it
Activity in Last Election Puts
Business Man "In Wrong"
- With Republican Leaders
S. EL "Vincent, Bull Moose nominee
for Congress in the recent election,
undoubtedly will be eliminated from
the Board of Apportionment and Taxa
tion when Mayor C. B. Wilson, makes
his appointments this week. Mr. Vin
cent's term as a member of the board
expires on Dec. 31, and his successor
is named during the month of Decem
ber. Recognized as the real head of the
frogressive party movement in this
city, and one of ithe men who had a
great deal to do with retirement of
Congressman E. J. Hill from active
political lite, it is not probable that
Mr. Vincent will receive other" than
scant consideration from the Republi
can leaders here. There is no charter
provision - against his re-appointment,
even as a member of the Progressive
party." There la, however, a strong
feeling among the Republican bosses
against his succeeding himself, these
bosses holding that Mr. Vincent and
his friends did much to overthrow the
control of the Republican machine, lo
cally, statewiee and nationally.
Mayor Wilson was asked today if
he had considered anyone to succeed
Mir. Vincent. The mayor said he has
not given much thought to the appoint
ments of any board members, and
wouldn't comment on the probability
of Mr. Vincent's being shelved.

VILLE, FLA.
State's Attorney Stiles Judson, who
has been spending a vacation in
Florida, wired to his law offices this
morning that the Clyde line steamer
on which he ond "Bill" Tuttle, of
Stratford are passengers, had gone
aground early this morning- just after
leaving Jacksonville, Fla. Mr. Judson
did riot think the steamer would suffer
any great delay. He expects to ar
rive in New York tomorrow.
Advance reports from the scenes of
their activities in Florida, show that
Messrs. Judson and Tuttle have been
having something of a regular vaca
tion. Friends here have received pic
ture post cards showing the Stratford
ites in camp, each armed like an ar
senal to prove they're hunters.
One report tells of the huntsmen
losing their way in a wild section of
the woods and being forced to camp
out all night in a hay-mow. "Hitting
the hay" in a literal sense proved
such a treat for "Bill" Tuttle that he
bought the haymow and camped in
it many nights while on the hunt.
Stratford is preparing a big recep
tion for the home-coming tourists. As
soon as they get settled,- Messrs. Jud
son and Tuttle will begin the manu-
racture ol alligator suit cases and
chatelaine bags made for their friends
from specimens taken on the hunt.

Washington, Dec, 6 Batteries of the
House " "money ' trust" Investigation
committee were turned, today, direct
ly upon the New York Stock Ex
change. Several of the directors of
the big concerns of the market have
been summoned . to appear next week
when the committee resumes its in
quiry. Inside information regarding the or
ganization and management of the
New York exchange is sought from
the governors, it was stated, authori
tatively, today. They will be ques
tioned to expose the alleged "close co
operation." -
The '"money trust" committee pro
poses to show to the nation, it was
learned, today, just how much the ex
change governors dominate the fi
nances of exchange members as "well
as control the "listing" of securities.
. Chairman Pujo said, today, he ex
pected to offer evidence to support
the following contentions: ;
That "seats" or memberships, in the
New York Exchange, are limited to a
select few, held at exorbitant prices,
thus barring hundreds of brokers from
free and unrestricted commerce.
That the govrenors have almost un
limited arbitrary power to cancel aiy
membership.
That it is impossible to secure a
"seat" without the tacit or actual
consent of great financial powers.
That .- arbitrary authority exists to
admit or bar stocks and bonds from
"listing" the privilege of being trad
ed i In upon the floor.
That the "curb" exchange is a me
dium or commerce forced upon brok
ers and bankers, often unwillingly by
the dominant "interests- or tne siock
exchange. ' '
These and other facts, trajo saia,
will show the potential if not actual
existence of the operations of a real
"money trust."
Todav. the full bankings committee
of the House met. Chairman Pujo re
nortinar the progress of the inquiry and

next week. Samuel XJntermyer, attor

fected every person in the courtroom.
This scene followed another quite as
toiinhine- when Judge John Lalry and

of the case against Mrs. Lang, indi

TAFT PLEADS
FOR A REFORM
OF CURRENCY
President's Message to Congress
Asks Legislation on Fifcal,
Judicial, Military and Insular
Affairs
"Washington, Dec. 6 In . a message
teeming with optimism. President Taft
today urged upon Congress an ad
vanced program .of legislation on the
fiscal, judicial, military and insular af
fairs of the nation.
Pleading for the immediate passage
of a currency reform measure along
the lines of the Aldrich plan, the Pres
ident declared for a bigger navy, a
further reorganization of the army to
provide for a greater reserve during
times of peace, continued supervision
over Porto Rico and the Philippines,
federal regulation of water powers in
navigable streams and the promulga
tion of a .workingmen s compensation
act.
The President highly ' praised Col.
Goethals, chief engineer of the Pan
ama Canal, and recommended that, in
recognition- of his wonderful work,
Goethals be made a major general of
the army with the title of chief of en
gineers when the present incumbent
is retired. -
' The tariff the President .discussed
with as few paragraphs.
"It was my 'belief that these cus
toms duties ought to be revised down
ward," he said, ? "but now that a new
Congress has . been elected on a ; plat
form .of the tariff for revenue only
rather than : a protective tariff, It is
needless- for me to occupy the time of
Congress with arguments or recom
mendations for tariff." . '
The President's plea for a revised
banking and currency system was es
pecially emphatic. Declaring it to be
the "most -crying- need' of the r ountry
todays'' he recommended the immed
iate' adoption of an elastic currency
system- along the lines of the central
bank idea proposed by the Aldrich
currency bill.
Discussing the prejudice which greet
ed the central bank idea, the Presi
dent argued that it arose from an
erroneous idea of its powers and a
distrust of bankers by the peopSe. .
The President warmly commended
the recent adoptign in the army of the
three-year reserve clause for enlisted
men which makes them subject to
draft in case of war after their enlist
ment has expired and the adoption, of
the 'Yesident soldiery" idea for our
insular possessions. "
-, The President warned Congress
against the proposal of the Democrats
to era ti f f rf1om to h - PhilliwyineH
srrfd-irto Rico. - . . f .
Praising the new disciplinary rules
ror tne- navy wnich largely obviate
severe poinlshments for desertions and
purely military offenses, the President
declared for a bigger navy.
we .have no desire for war, he said,
"we .would 'go -. as far as any nation
in the world : to avoid war. but we are
a world-power- and our manifold inter
ests require-us to recognize our posi
tion as one of the foremost of the fam
ilies of the nation."
Reviewing the work of the Supreme
court, the President warned against
radical anti-trust legislation and
sounded the praises of the Sherman
law. .
ARNOLD 50 YEARS
IN POLICE FORCE
'Strong Arm of the Law" Physi
cal as Vyell as Mental
Marvel '
Veteran Head ". of Detective
j Bureau Recipient of Many
:v-;dongratnIatiQns on '
'Anniversary
Though passing the fiftieth anniver
sary yesterday of appointment to
service as a police officer in the city
of Bridgeport, Captain of Detectives
George H. Arnold presents today as
vigorous, intelligent and forceful .char
acter as any" younger men who may
aspire to fill his place as admonitor
of the human family. He Is, literally.
as well as metaphorically, the "strong
arm of the law" as has been proven
in many an encounter with the unre-
generate. His is the arm that reaches
to convict.
George Arnold was a comparatively
young man when in 1862 he was first
made a constable here, but by leaps
and bounds he gained fame. It was
43 years ago yesterday that he was
first admitted -as a regular patrolman
to the present force, being assigned to
"night watch" under the direction of
Capt. Bryan. His rise was spectacu
lar and few detectives, including the
famous New York inspector, Byrnes,
can boast of more clever criminal de
tection than can the present head of
the department here.
Yet in his treatment of erring hu
manity his methods are tempered with
kindness, and intuition guides him to
capture rather than physical suasion.
It is the boast of the man whose de
duction has brought to justice such
offenders against the law as Jim
Humphries, Jimmy D. Dobbs and the
Boinay and Weeks gang, that given
one fact as a clue he -would appre
hend the criminal quicker than by a
dozen contributory clues.
Captain Arnold is today the recip
ient of many congratulatory letters
and expressions of good will for his
continuance in the capacity he has so
long filled with skill and efficiency.
