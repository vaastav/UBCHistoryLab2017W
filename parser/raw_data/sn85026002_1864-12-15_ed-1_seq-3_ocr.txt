"will you give this subject your immediate at

Mr President, I hav no expectation of
making Ihe Senate comprehend tbe state of

aught I know, quietly submit to bare ber

the Northwest will not I off.tr this resolu

Whereat, Recent raid hav been organ

purporting lo hold commission from Ihe

Mr Chandler 1 had hoped there would be
no objection lo it. 1 will now offer another
resolution, which I ask to be referred to tbe

Mr. Doolittle wished to hav tb resolution
ia relation to taxation, offered by bim on
Monday, taken from Ihe table and referred to
Ibe Commute on r inaaoe.
Mr. UooliUle said 1 desire to Mil attention
of tbe members of tbe Committee on Finan
ces, to the special point aaentioned, without
at all entering into a discussion
1 ha resolution instructed a committee to
enquire into Ibe propriety of a tax on all sales.
of bolh real and personal property, according
to tbe best estimate that oan be made The
smallest amount thai would be produced br
this tax would be $75,060,000 a year. It not
only proposes a tax on sale actually made,
but opon all wboswll stock, gold and produce.
will have mor of a restraining effect on
speculation in gold that any gold bills can be
passed, wbich shall make it a penal offense to
sell gold ia tbe market, or make any distinc
tion between gold aud paper currency. It
also propose thai tbe Committee shall inquir
uto in praprieir ol adding a tax ot IS per

including street railroad, steamboat and for.
ea, making such com peine tax natbervr
or tb benelit of tb Government. This is
source of incom aud revenue whicb is lb
most immediaiely accessaibl of any upon
which lha Government can lay it hauda.
which wo Id be received ia large quantiliee
Irom powerful companies, wkos revenue
would become immense.
This is lb time when w should sell bold

Be thought that this resolution
would create a controversv with the House.
whieh ha rleairail In avoid The Senate mnat
await iheir actions He believed there waa
uecessily for increased taxation. There were
everal reasons for it The aoldiera were
now serving in th field and enduring the
hardships of military service, whil citi
zens were reapiug a rich profit
Irom Ihe war by engaging in business, and
were doing betier than they bad don during
any previous year. He thought it wo but
right that they who ar reapiug th profit of
the war, should pay liberally in taxes. If we
increased our national debt and put thoae
taxes upon luture generations, we compelled
these soldiers who had (ought our battles to
bear tbe expenses of the war. This would bo
unjust.
Mr, Urown 1 hav no objection to tb ref
erence of this resolution to ihe Committee on
Finance, it it Was introduced merely lor set
ting lorlb th views euterteined by th sena
tor from Wisconsin, (Mr. Doolittle) of indica
ting tb direction in which be thought enquiry
sbould be made ; but il it is going to lhat com
mille by general consent, and ia to be taken
aa any indication that the Senate concur iu
the auggestiont made, I ahall for one, lay
that I differ very widely iu regard 10 the poli
cies be has indicated, and Ibe effect to follow
from that which ha seems to antietpate. I
think gentlemen are perhaps mistaken in re
gard to the extent to whicb taxation can b
carried, and that we ar ptrhaps nearer the
point al which it cau be safely born than
many persons imagine Mr. Brown continued
bis remarks advocating a reduction of expen
diture! in th conduot ol Ihe Government,
Mr. Doolittle 1 agree with the Senator
from Missouri, entirely, in what he taytaboot
reducing expenses in evtry possible way. I
will go wilh him in any effort to reduce them,
and to compel the Administration in every
department of th Government to exercise
theatric' est economy possible. Al tbe same
lime our neceasary expenses are so great, and
must be so great, lhat we are compelled to
seize hold of every source that will certainly
bring us revenue. 1 do not expect, of course,
ttiit tbese resolutious shall go forth as ex
pressing the vieaa ol the Senate, upon tb
points 1 have presented, still the point are of
