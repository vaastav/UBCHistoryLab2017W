THC OLD CATHEDRAL
St Johns cathedral being erected
jy the Episcopalians at New York has
beer considered the most magnificent
attempt at church architecture In
America but within tho next six years
the Catholic cathedral now building
at St Louis bids fair to rival In
grandeur and beauty oven that tom
pie The construction of this new
Catholic cathedral Is being watched
with evfrincrcaBlng Interest The
laying of the cornerstone a short
time ago was the occasion of tho most
splendid ceremonies In which distin
guished visitors from afar a special
representative of tho pope and 10000
Catholics took part
According to Archbishop Glennon
the Cathedral will bo completed with
in six years The cost of tho exterior
will be 1500000 and of the interior
when completed another million The
cost of the site at Lindell boulevard
and Newstcad avenue was 300000
Tho structure will be larger than
several of the famous old world ca
thedrals Modeled after St Sophias
at Constantinople It will overtop the
latter 50 feet In height amid will bo
111 feet longer It will bo two feet
higher than Notre Dame at Paris and
46 feet wider It will surpass In both
height and width Westminster abbey
In London
The St Louis cathedral will be 350
feet In length 216 feet In width and
225 feet In altitude at the dome Its
seating capacity will bo 4500 of whom
2300 can sit in unobstructed view of
the altar and 3000 in full view of tl > I
officiating priest Tho floors of ih <
auditorium aisles and perambitlatr i
will be paved with marble mosaic In
harmony with the general color
scheme of the Interior
There will be four separate chapels
each as large as the ordinary church
in St Louis and costing 100000 each
A perambulatory supported by great
columns will surround the entire audi
torium
The Byzantine style of architecture
was adopted because of Its superior
economy over the ornate and elabo
rate Gothic It is declared that Gothic
buildings cost three times as much as
those In the Byzantine style
This Byzantine warmth and variety
of color will mark the interior of the
St Louis cathedral with Its countless
columns in rare and beautifully col
ored marble Its spandrels band
courses architraves and balustrades
of rich mosaic and Its splendid mural
decorations on canvas Indeed it Is
the purpose of the designers to make
the Interior a veritable palace of re
ligious art The historian in his com
ments on St Sophia goes on to say
that the memory of past calamities In
spired Justinian with wise resolution
that no wood except for doors be ad
mitted to the edifice Tho structure
was of brick faced with marble and
the finishings of the interior were of
marble tile and mosaic The St Louis
cathedral will be even more nearly
fireproof bronze taking tho place of
wood for the doors and solid stone for
the walls with masahe foundations
of concrete The splendid dome will
be covered with green mission tile
and the heating ventilation and arti
ficial cooling of the sanctuary and
chapels during the summer will bo In
accordance with the most modern
methods Everything for beauty com
fort and safety has been provided
making the building perfect In all Its
details The marbles for the interior I
and to be of old convent Sienna Alps I
green rose Numhf Ian and Pavannazzo
and the mosaics and mural decora
tions will bo wrought by the best
craftsmen and artists in the country
As far IlS possible the work will 00
of American preferably St Louis ori
gin
One of the loveliest features of the
great central body of Uio church will
be the altar of exquisite white mar
ble overhung by a baldachin not of
silk or tapestry of which this canopy
Is usually made but of solid sliver
filagree supported on four pillars of
delicate tinted onyx Another beauti
ful feature will bo the entrance to tho
crypt approached by a broad stairway
of white marble
For financing the great building an
Initial fund of 250000 was left by tho
late Archbishop Kaln 71000 baa been
subscribed by the clergy and 130000
more by Individual contilhutoru Tho
archdiocese Is engaged In raising an
other half million for the completion
of the superstructure
With tho finishing of the building
the archdiocese will havo an oflictal
capital The old cathedral at Second
mid Walnut streets has been little
more than a prrlsh church sluco
Archbishop Kaln ten years ago
planned a now cathedral at Jefferson
avenue and Locust street a site which
ho afterwards abandoned Tho old
cathedral was dedicated 74 years ago
and was regarded for decades as a no
table structure
Time ceremony Incident to the laying
of the cornerstone for tho old cathe
dral for whlah Bishop Rosatl tolled
so long and against so many discour
agements was the greatest thing of
Its nature that tho young St Louis
had experienced > it took place on tho
1st of August 1831 and In less than
three years the church was completed i
and almost paid for Even In Its pres I
ent grimy condition lost among the
timeeaten buildings of the river sec
tion of the city It is still a wonderful
structure with Its stately doric col
umns and its air of quiet grandeur
Long ago It was abondoned by tho
archbishop for whom tho small
chapel at NewBtcod and Maryland ave
nues was erected on the corner of tho
spacious lot purchased for the grand
new cathedral but tho part It played
In the early religious life of the city
will never be forgotten cannot be un
derestimated
Long before even this early church
was called into being there was a
great Catholic church In St Louis
great because of Its Importance in the
community It was the little struc
ture built of upright posts which occu
pied the middle of the block between
Main and Second streets and sur
rounded by the best of tho early
French families that settled St Louis
Here Father Bernard de Llmpoch fol I
lowing the work of Father Valentin
lipcan the struggle for tho erection of
a church compatible with the wealth
and population of St Louis The re
sult was the little wooden building
that was dedicated In 177C and re
mained standing until 1820 That
same struggle was taken up by Bishop
Rosati when the city had outgrown all
Its churches and again by his grace
Archbishop Glennon when ha realized
that St Louis ought to bo the seat
of a really magnificent cathedral
That the city will ever outgrow this
superb building that Is about to come
Into being It Is difficult to believe For
centuries to come It will more than
likely remain a unique and wonderful
example of eccelslastlcal architecture
of which any city might well be proud
WATER SUPPLY AND POWER
Great HydroElectric Roject Near
Torreon in Mexico
Following the report of government
engineers who have been making sur
veys and estimates of a projected dam
across the Nazas river near Torreon
the federal government of Mexico has
agreed to give financial support to the
proposition and the I contract for Its
construction has been awarded Ac
cording to the estimates of the engi
neers the dam will cost about 6000
000 and will form one of the largest
water storage reservoirs on the conti
nent affording u water supply to the
whole Nazas river cotton growing dis
trict for a period of tlnee years with
out replenishing
In connection with this dam It Is
also pmnneil to Install a hydroelectric
plant to supply all of the towns within
a radius of 150 miles There are man
large industrial plants In the Nazas
valley which will bo provided with
cheap power from the proposed plant
and It Is expected that the establish
ment of manufacturing enterprises
will be greatly stimulated
The principal cottongrowing region
of Mexico lies In this valley but ow
ing to the uncertainty of rains in the
mountains the river cannot be depend
ed upon to give an adequate water
supply for Irrigation purposes when
most needed By storing the water
this difficulty will be overcome The
site of the proposed dam Is In the San
Fernandez canyon
