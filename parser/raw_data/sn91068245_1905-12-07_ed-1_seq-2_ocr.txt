THE FKK-.1DK.N l' MESSAGE.
Prefiid-ct UjOjevfrlt's met-sage was
read in both houses of Cuogrev
Tuesday at noon. We are sorry we
haven't room to publish It in full,
but the document id quite lengthy
and would require more apace than i
we have at our command, so we are
giviDg our readers ihe most import-;
ant feature of the message.
One of the roosst important fea
tures of the President's message was
his advocacy of government control
of railroad rates. This does not
mean to take the authority of fixing
raveo uui ui iuo usuub u tua
roads altogether but to have a com
mUsion to see that no one is over
charged or discriminated against.
The President al-o calls attention to
the necessity for legislation requir
ing the use of block signals upon
railroads engaged in interstate com
merce and states that Congress
should provide, by appropriate leg
islation, for the Introduction of block
signals upon all such railroads at the
earliest practical date, as rf measure
of increased safety to the travelling
public. Further important recom
mendations of the President were,
the urgent need of action to make
our criminal law more efl'ective, the
need of a greater merchant marine,
the necessity of a law to regulate
interstate commerce in misbranded
and adulterated foods, drinks and
drugs. Such a law would protect
the legitimate manufacturer and the
consuming public. The President
also recommends that Indian Terri
tory and Oklahoma be admitted as
one State, and that New Mexico and
Arizona be admitted as one State.
Mr. Roosevelt states that nothing
has taken up more time in Congress
during the past few years than the
Question as to the siatthood to be

LAWS SUOULU . i.i: i !
The Winston Daiiy 1S niiiA-l (dem
ocratic) is of the opinion Jiat lh
next legislature hhuukl nd a part
of ita time in repta!iL the i.eedlesf
laws now on the statute Looks. The
Sentinel says :
'One of the be&t things the next
legislature cculd do would be to take
from the statute bi oks some of the
laws now contained therein. We
have many very excellent laws and
some very needle-83 ones and the lai
ter should be repealed. It is taty to
see that disrespect tor one law breeds
contempt for all law. There can be
little doubt of too fact that we have
too many laws and every legislature
naturallv increases the number. Ot
course new conditions are constantly
arising and these necessitate new
'laws, but we hope the next legisla
ture will confine new laws to the
minimum. Ve also hope that the
next legislature will take action to
have provision made tor the care ot
ail the insane of the State, no matter
how much it costs. This trouble
about inadequate space at the State
' hospitals is constantly arisiug, and
we believe the condition complained
of should beremedied once for all."
The Sentinel is right. Many ot
the laws now on the statute books
should be repealed because other
laws have been passed in their stead
while there are many 'more that have
been passed by recent legislatures
that are obsolete for the reason tha
they have, never been enforced
They should either be repealed or
the officers of the law should be
fined for not enforcing them. If a
man can violate one law and go un
punished he naturally concludes he
can break other laws and escape pun
ishment. As the Sentinel says
Disrespect for one law breeds con
tempt for all law."
An exchange says that the 1aw
less may expect to be punished."
Well, If they do, many of the law
less don't get what they expect.
Water-Rate Decision.
The Sapreme Court of Florida
decided that an ordinance passed by
the city of Tampa, regulating water
rates in that city, is valid. The
plant in Tampa is owned by a cor
poration and the city passed an ordi
nance fixing certain rate charges for
water. The water company appealed
jand the court upholds the city
-LEADI5G A. XTKAK. LOT."
The JUleigh EfenlngTimea(dem
ocratlc) thinks the democratic con
tingent In Coogrew U a weak lot.
The Times, In looking over the
"lot," take this view of the situa
tion: The nomination cf John Sharp
Williams, of Mississippi, f r Speaker
by the Democratic m.i.tere of the
ilouto of Repreutativfs, mean
tht he will again officiate as the
minority leader, and ind ed no other
arrangement would have been t
I -factory to the party. Mr. Cannon,
of course, will be the real speaker.
In Conre the demerit cut a very
Horry figure in quantity and quality,
tor It seemi to be a rule in some
parts of the South and West to pi k
up a man without ability and elect
him simply because h has the pnll'
with the politicians. There are con
stant changes from almost every dis
trict and before a member has had
time to familiarise himself with con
ditions, he is left at home and an
other stranger Is sent to Washing
ton to set the woods on fire; soon
he returns."
The Greenville Reflector says:
We notice that a veteran In Vir
ginia has refused a pension and
hack pay amounting to upward of
15,000. If be was in North Caro-
Ina he would be sent up about
taleigh."
The Reflector doesn't make it
plain whether tne man would have
been sent to the penitentiary or to
he Insane asylum. But that wouldn't
have maae mucn ainerence, as
here are many in the prisons who
should be in the asylums, and it is
safe to say there are some in the
asylum who should be in the peni
tentiary.
Where the Trouble Lie mm to Tafclxir
Care of the Insane.
in discussing the agitation con
cerning the indigent insane of the
titate, which shows an alarming and
shameful condition of things relative
to these poor unfortunates, the Char
lotte Observer, getting off on the
ine that we have spoken on before,
says:
But what we started out to say
is that the present agitation is in
reality out cf season at present ; it
should have occurred just before or
during a session of the legislature.
The State Hospital authorities have
never in recent years failed to ac
quaint the members of the legisla
ture with the true condition of af
fairs and urge them to do whatever
was necessary for the care of all the
nsane in the x State, always laying
emphasis upon the condition ot
those who could not be admitted for
lack of room. Tnere is no evidence
that conditions are worse now than
they have been for some years and
certainly they are a great deal worse
than they should be. The legisla
latuie alone can remedy present con
ditions, and it does not meet for over
a year yet.
"We have repeatedly called atten
tion to tne very tacts .that are now
beii g made u;-e of; Indeed to such
extent that we were feariul of weary
ing our readers. The legislature,
however, tailed to act, and until it
does no relief that is worthy of the
namo is to be expected.
As to the hospital authorities,
there is no doubt that they have
done their duty, despite assertions to
the contrary. The responsibility for
present conditions lies with the
members of the legislature."
The appeals to the Governor in
behalf of the indigent insane dur
ing off years by some of the politi
cat organs do not win much applause
from the people as to their good in
tentions or statesmanship. Neither
has the recent management of the
State Hospitals merited much es
teem from our recent legislatures.
J hey have gone off after strange
gods," as it were, and neglected
these unfortunates at the time that
they could have provided for them.
They have thought of the reassess
ment of property, of providing for
special and higher taxes, of raiding
salaries and of creating new offices,
of giving place to political favorites
and cf iriietuatine the oower of
the Democratic party, and in the
wind up they have consumed all the
taxes that have been raised and there
is no money leu for the manv
needed purposes. This has been the
program each time the legislature
has met, and there is no use to
mince words about it, the blame
should fc go where it belongs. The
next campaign will be waged on the
idea of re-electing Simmons to the

We publish this to show that
Democratic officials sometimes do
wrong as well as Republicans. Our
Democratic friends have spasms
whenever a Republican officer goes
wrong, but they tread lightly on
the toes of the brutes of their own
party. We believe in condemning
wrong wherever it exists, regard
less of party. Democratic officials
in the East are being criticized for

Progressive Farmer.
The following dispatch was printed
in last week's Progressive Farmer :
Fayetteville, Nov. 21st : Messrs.
John C. Haigh and George Myrover,
tormerly cashier and teller of the
Bank of Fayetteville, plead guilty
to the charge of embezzlement in
the Superior Court today and judg
ment was suspended on payment of
costs, restitution having been made
to the bank."
Fairbrother's Everything calls at
tention to the fact that the same day
Haigh and Myrover were turned
loose on the people they had robbed
of $28,000, a negro in Salisbury wa
sentenced to five years for stealing
$35, and another negro was senteneed
to one year for stealing a plug of to
bacco. Everything" also reflects
the general sentiment of the press
and our opinion so clearly that wh
reprint herewith what it says in lieu
of any comments cf our own :
"Webster's Dictionary, defining
the word embezzlement, says: 'Lar
ctny aenoies a taxing oy iraud or
stealth, from another's possession
embezzlement denotes an appropria
tion, by fraud or stealth, of pro
erty already in the wrong-doex's
possession.' Thu9 it will be seen
mat the man who embezzles not
only steals but violates a sacred trust
It certainly was a sublime spectacle
to see men standing up in a court of
justice and stating that they be
lieved the ends of justice would be
met if the brace of thieves would
pay the costs in the case after they
had pleaded guilty to taking nearly
thirty thousand dollars that did not
belong to them, and by so doing
caused the bank to temnorarily sus
pend. Suspension of judg
ment, upon payment of costs, and

The Democratic party has been in
power in this State for years and all
at once the people stand aghast at
iuo umuuacemeni mat tnere are
hundreds of insane persons who can
not gain admission to the State in
stitutions. Unfortunately Demo
cratic Legislatures have been too
busy raising salaries, multiplying
omces, passing Watt liquor laws
which their own officials won't en
force, finding negroes in every wood
pile, reckless appropriation of funds
until nothing is left but a Dankrupt
State Treasury, enacting fool private
laws and many of a public nature,
which the Supreme Court sets aides
in a majority of appeals, while the
poor and helpless insane are kept in
pens like cattle, or in jails like crim
inals, for lack of accommodation at
Baleigh and Morganton. Now there
is a terrible blow and bluster about
the unfortunates and it is well. But
why, at this late date ? Simply be
cause patience has ceased to be a vir
tue, and there is a demand all over
North Carolina which the Demo
cratic party cannot any longer cast
aside at will to patch the holes in
their extremely rotten political
fences in order to carry the State

W. F. Brown Estimates Crop at lO,
1X5,000 Balea.
New Orleans, Dec. 8 W. P.
Brown, former bull leader, tonight
i-sued bis estimate of thia year's
cotton crop, whicn he places at 10,-
175,000 bales (commercial.) The
estimate includes this year's growth,
linters, city crop and what old cot
ton may have been carried over from
last year. He declares cotton will
go to 15 cents, and adds:
"I contend that prices are only
relative and that the world today is
better able to buy goods made of 7
and 8 cent cotton. The planters of
the South can market the balance of
this crop on an average of 15 cents
if they btand together.
My investigation shows that we
have practically a crop disaster in
Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas,
three-fourths of Texas and Indian
Territory. Oklahoma, Tennessee and
Alabama have fared somewhat bet
ter, though the yield in those States
is very light. Georgia, the Caro-
linas and Florida have good crops."

A group of drummers were trading

when one, a little Virginian with a

then the old woman put the two

those out. laid them over in the
corner, put the next two to bed, and
so on. Alter all the children were
asleep on the floor, the old folk
went in the other room and told us
we could go to bed if we wanted to,
and, bein' powerful' tired out, we
did.

Mr. Robert Stephens, the genial
agent of the Norfolk and Western
Railroad here had quite an unusual
experience last Friday night. It
seems that two bodies were shipped
from the same express office In West
Virginia on the same train. One
was that of a grown person and the
other a child. The child was to
come to Koxboro and the other to
go to North Wilkeaboro, both were
marked correctly. Mr. Stephens'
fonsteravtlon cannot be imagined or
expressed when the father of the
little child came forward to claim
the corpse and found that a mistake
had been made. Bob said he fairly
made the wires burn till he got the
matter straightened out. It was a
terrible blander of some one. The
mistake was made In Roaaoke, hence
the officials on this division were
not responsible.

What a Trained Narae Say.
"If nervous people wonld only
drink more water they would not
be so nervous," remarked a train
nurse the other day. "Nearly every
physician will recommend to a wo
man who is suffering from nervous
prostration or nervous exhaustion to
drink lots of water between meals ;
but many women who do not come
under a doctor's care would feel bet
ter and look better if they would
drick, say, a quart of water in the
course of the day. Water seems to
be a nerve food, and it has a dis
