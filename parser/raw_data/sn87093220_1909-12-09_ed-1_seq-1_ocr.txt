VOLUME XXIV
BLANKET FRAN HISE PASSES
County Commissioners Bestow the Koads of
the County to a
Despite Protest of Their Legal Advisor, County
Attorney Campbell, the County Commis
sioners Grant Wheeler Franchise.
Organized Action by Betrayed
People May Save Roads.
Grand Jury Needed.
The blanket franchise, granting
Eldrjdge Wheeler (his heirs and as
sign#, although they are not men
tioned,) right of way over every
road in Chehalis county, was passed
•at the meting of the inisrepresanta
tives of the county—called county
commissioners—last Monday, it was
a foregone conclusion. The Abel pro
moter of this scheme never broached
it until everything, and everybody
necessary was "fixed."
The scheme was exposed in the
Herald of November '-'J, by the sim
ple publication of the franchise, com
ment being deemed unnecessary. This
called attention to the matter in ail
parts of the county, and in the brief
time intervening it was discussed at
large. Almost all were ol' opinion
that no such scheme would be passed
by any board of county commission
ers, and were inclined to treat the
matter lightly, but not all. The El
ma Commercial club at its regular
meeting after the exposure in the
Herald, saw trouble ahead, and pass
ed the following resolutions;
"Whereas; The Elma Commercial
club, while appreciating the benefits
which follow development by trolley
lines and heartily welcoming to this
section any new line which will give
better, cheaper and more convenient
means of communication and trans
portation, objects to giving up a large
portion of the county highways to
any corporation for the use of trolley
or railway right of way. The roads
belong to the people, and should be
preserved fr their use, without sub
jecting them to the inconvenience
and dangers that would follow the
running of trolley or railway lines
along such highways and over the
bridges thereon. Therefore, be it
Resolved, That this Commercial
club earnestly protests against the
granting of any such franchise as is
asked for, or giving up tho public
highways to the use of any corpora
tion."
No doubt similar action would
have been taken in the Grays Har
bor cities, but for the craftiness of
the promoter. It is now known that
prominent men in all cities in tlie
country—from Westport to Summit
—were "taken in." The legal publi
cation —paid for by the promoter —
was not made in the Montesano Vi
dette, the county official paper, but
in the Grays Harbor News, a worthy
journal, but with no pretentions to
any extensive circulation outside of
Hoquiam. That all this was a deliber
ate and Abel attempt to stiffle pub
licity, was evident on its face.
Consider the franchise for a mom
ent, and then think of the consessions
made for its passage. As originally
framed, the franchise was perpetual,
and set no time for anything. When
the commissioners met, Monday, Eld
ridge Wheeler, the grantee, appeared
by his attorney, W. 11. Abel, the Abe
Reuf of the Chetaalis county bar and
its politics, Mr. Wheeler naivly re
marking that "while Mr. Abel was
not his usual attorney, he bad em
ployed him on this occasion from poli
cy." The only persons appearing in
opposition was J. D. Crary, manager
of the Grays Harbor Railway & Light
Co. —a building, not a promoting con
cern- —and his attorney, J. B. Bridges,
and County Attorney W. E. Camp
bell.
The attention of the commissioners
was call to the glaring wrong ibe
granting of the franchise would per
petrate upon the people of Chehalis
county; to the fact that the county
was just beginning to have roads
at all, and to make a free gift of
them to anybody was not only un
just but unlawful, and requested that
the grantee be required to at. least
show what was his backing for an
undertaking requiring millions of
dollars. This request was met by
by Mr. Abel with the reply that they
would not do so, as such information
would be taken advantage of by op
psition builders.* He finally agreed
to admit the commissioners into his
confidence in executive session. This
farce was gone through with, agalnsi
the protest of W. E. Campbell, coun
ty attorney, and the legal adviser of
the board of commissioners, and re
sulted in the passage of the franchise
—with certain concessions that were
really required to make it legal—by
the votes of Commissioners Arland
and Davis, Commissioner Hopkins
voting against it. And there the mat
stands.
What it Means
The franchise, as originally draft
ed and published was perpetual
ABERDEEN HERALD
granting rights to maintain and oper
ate electric and motor railways;
build all necessary switches; run all
kinds of poles and wires and lay au'd
maintain all kinds of pipes, mains
and conduits, in fact giving all rights
the county owns in its highways, ex
cept the right to travel them and
pay for keeping them up.
The concessions made by ISoss Abel
consists of limiting the life of the
franchise to .jO years. (It will be
observed here that a perpetual fran
chise would have been unconstitu
tional, hence invalid) to begin the
building of a road between Aberdeen
and Montesano within one year and
complete within two years, (but no
forfeiture is provided in case of fail
ure, so this provision is simply a
waste of the paper il is written upon)
and to haul gravel for the county at a
"reasonable" price.
Thus was the county's birthright
swaped for a mess of pottage—cold
pottage, too. The franchise covers
every road in the county beginning
at the eastern end (
at the eastern line above Oakville.
and running west to Elma, embrac
ing tlie roads on both sides of the
Chehalis river, and on to Montesano,
backing up to Summit. From thence
if there is a piece of road east of the
Pacific ocean at Moclips it does not
touch, it is not decernilde, with the
solitary exception of that between
South Aberdeen and Westport, which
is only now being laid out, or it
would doubtless have been included.
Dees all this mean the building of
electrict railways? Hy no means. It
it (liil, there would be some consola
tion, but on (lie contrary, it means
the delay of such transportation, as
it gives the grantees of this fran
chise a "hold-up" against every le
gitimate concern that might wish
to build a road. Nothing else. Does
the most credulous readers —if not
in the scheme —imagine for a mom
ent. that the promoter of this ini
quity has any idea of building a road
up Hear Gulch? Uoes he think be
would like to have stock in a concern
that, promised to build a railroad to
Quiniault Lake, or parallel the Nor
thern Pacific to Moclips? Of course
not. Then, why deliver, without
a cent of compensation, to this syn
dicate rights to those roads? The
answer is but one, it can't be print
ed in type—it's too crooked.
Note what the franchise gives
those promotors—many of whom
ought to be in better business. It
gives then the right to use any por
tion of the county roads between Gate
City and Moclips.
Right to build any portion at any
tim c.
Right to sell or assign the fran
chise, or part of it.
Right to build either a third rail
or a trolley system. z
Right to begin and finish it at
any time within 50 years.
The action of the board, Monday,
in bearing this matter indicated an
Abel frame-up. The executive ses
sion to hear the names of the backers
of a project that would require at
least $20,000,000 was a most ridi
culous farce. That County Attorney
Campbell pointed out the apparent
fact that its passage would retard
instead of encouraging what we all
desire in the way of trolley lines,
the farce is gone through with just
as though Commissioner Arland and
Davis were for the first time being
made acquainted with particulars of
the deal.
Never in the history of Chehalis
county, or any other community was
a more "horrible example" of the
necessity of a recall law shown. Hut,
in the absence of such a law, the peo
ple should not sit supinely and per
mit this act of aggression. The Her
ald suggests an immediate organiza
tion in, not only the towns and cities,
but in every road district for the pur
pose of defeating this scheme. The
proper custodian of those roads—the
county commissioners—having prov
ed recreant, the people must take
hold. Suppose that in each voting
precinct in the county an organiza
tion was made; likewise in the cities
and towns, and a fund created to
fight this scheme —conceived in ini
quity and brought forth in "execu
tive session" —fight it legally, the
Herald has small doubt that it could
be defeated.
To begin with, suppose we were
fighting it, a great percentage of the
county roads covered by this fran
chise have been donated to the coun-

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
President Taft Sends Annual Message
to Congress—Synopsis of the
Document.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. !>.—
The president's anual mesage to con
gress was submitted Monday. It
contains 18,000 words, which is rath
er shorter than tho average.
The part of the message which at
tracted the most attention was found
In collection with the treatment of
I lie Zelaya incident, of which the
president spoke a a "sad tale of un
speakable barbarity." The president
promises to send a special message
to congress dealing entirely with the
Nieaiaguan affair.
Kconomy in expenditure and suffi
ciency of revenue are urged to meet
the treasury deficit.
The president declares it unwise
to attempt further revision of the
tariff until the facts are at hand upon
which such revision can be properly
undertaken.
ty for "county road" purposes, the
donators an dtheir heirs might have
a kick. Again, the fact that the fran
chise as published is not the one
granted, by reason of the preconceiv
ed amendments, might delay it, and
be the means of showing the affair
up in court. The Herald is not a
lawyer, but simply throws out sug
gestions.
But, there is a remedy that does
not require a lawyer's opinion to tell
its province. Call a grand jury. Pro
moter Abel refused to tell in public
the names of his flackers in this
scheme, but the actions of Commis
sioner Davis and Arland are such as
to justify the suspicion that, they had
personal interests in sacrificing the
roads of the public in this wild cat
scheme. Both of those gentlemen
are, or have been engaged in logging,
and none who know them would ever
suspect them of granting such rights
of way over their logging roads with
out. their having been "touched."
Yet, those gentlemen, elected to safe
guard the interests of the people vol
untarily give away rights that on
the market today are worth at least
$. r )0,000, and may be worth ten times
that sum in ten years.
Mr. Abel refused to tisll who was in
the deal, but a proper grand Jury—
sticking the probe into the county
commissioners—would be empower
ed to compel him to tell all about a
deal that is so croked on its face
as to justify but one conclusion as
to those ttfo commissioners—complic
ity or idiocy, either of which would
vacate their offices.
HOQUIAM BONDS ILLEGAL
Bonds Amounting to $85,000 Issued
bv Hoquiam Are Found Illegal
IIOQUIAM, Dec. 9. —Pecause the
strict letter of the law was not com
plied with in issuing $55,000 worth
of bonds voted by the city to take
up the outstanding indebtedness of
the city, the bonds have been declar
ed niegal by a New York expert.
Another special election to vote
this amount must be called and car
ried before the bonds can be floated.
Mayor Frary said: "The bonds are
not legal owing to a mistake in issu
ing them. This will necessitate an
other election. Just when it will be
called I cannot say at this time."
The bonds can easily be placed, if
(W.ived legal, as a number of com
panies submitted bids for them.
Delivers Message
C onsiderable space is devoted to
the sugar frauds, which, the president
says, are humiliating.
The "white slave" traffic is dis
cussed.
Speaking general, President Taft
says the country is in a high state
of prosperity. He notes the increase
in the cost of living, but says the
taiiff is not the cause. In those
products of the factory and farm
there has been no increase in the
tariff and in many Instances a very
considerable reduction. He asks for
a tariff board.
President Taft says he is convinc
ed! the people desire postal savings
banks and that they will be product
ive of utmost good.
The president mentions the neces
sity for legislation looking to the
further conservation of natural re
sources and announces that a special
message in this subject, including
that of waterways reclamation, irri
gation, reforesting, etc., will be sent
to congress early.
ASK DISMISSAL
OF BOYCOTT CASE
Puts It Up to Highest Tribunal to
Decide Whether Publication
Complained of Was Lawful
WASHINGTON', D. C., Dec. S.—
Before the supreme court of the Unit
ed States tomorrow attorneys for the
American Federation of Labor will
ask to have dismissed the original
nti-boycott judgment issued by
Judge Gould in the now famous Buck
Rlove & Range Co. case. Samuel
Gompers, John Mitchell and Frank
Morrison, officers of the federation
under a contempt sentence for viola
tion of the injunction, are parties
to the appeal.
This move, in'short, puts it up to
the supreme court to decide if the
federation boycott of the Bucks
Stove and Range company in its
organ, the federationist, was a law
ful procedure. The court of appeals
of the District of Columbia ws held
that it was not and with some mod
ifications has sustained Judge
Gould's injunction.
The Buck Stove & Range company
has also filed an appeal to the su
preme court of the United States
against the modifications, claiming
the original injunction has been so
altered as to be practically of no
value for the purpose for which it
was sought. The American Federa
tion of Labor will argue that no in
junctions have been issued in the
first court and ask for a complete dis
missal.

mature.
CHICAGO, Dec. S. —'.Viiliam G.
Lee, president of the Brotherhood of
Railroad Trainmen, tonighi sent a
message to President Taft assuring
him that sensational reports regard
ing a general railroad st.'iko were
without foundation.
Following is President Lte's mes
sage to President Taft:
"in order that yourself and the
public may know the truth, I deem
it necessary to state that the press
reports indicating that a strike of
the Hrotherhood of Railroad Train
men and other affiliated organiza
tions is threatened at this time as
a result of the demands made for
increased pay in tho territory east
of Chicago are absolutely without
foundation.
"Whatever action is taken by the
organization I represent will depend
entirely upon the individual expres
sion of members through the general
commission for the railways in the
territory and will be handled in the
usual manner. The demands of the
train employes in train and yard ser
vice east of Chicago cannot take
proper form even for deliberate con-j
sideration between the railway offi
cials and their employes before the
early part of 1910.
"All this talk about a strike of
the Brotherhood of Railroad Train
men and affiliated organizations is]
absurd and the membership of the
organization fully realize it."
