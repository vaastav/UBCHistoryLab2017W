in writing. The secretary presented
the message and it was read.
The Message.
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
It gives me pleasure to extend greet
ing to the Fifty-fifth congress assem
bled at the seat of government with
many of whom, senators and represen
tatives, I have been associated in the
legislative service. Their meeting oc
curs under felicitous circumstances,
justifying sincere congratulation and
calling for our grateful acknowledg
ment to a beneficent providence which
has so signally blessed and prospered
us as a nation. Peace and good will
with all the nations of the earth con
tinue unbroken.
A Matter of Satisfaction.
A matter of genuine satisfaction is
the growing feeling of fraternal regard
and unification of all sections of our
country, the incompleteness of which
has too long been delayed in the real
ization of the highest blessings of the
union. The spirit of patriotism is uni
versal and is ever increasing in fervor.
The public questions whieh now .most
engross us are lifted far above either
partisanship, prejudice or former see
tinal differences. They aifect every
part of our common country alike and
permit of no division on ancient lines.
Questions of foreign policy, of revenue,
the soundness of the currency, the in
violability of national obligatins, the
improvement of the public service, ap
peal to the individual conscience of ev
ery earnest citizen to whatever party
he belongs or in whatever section of
the country he may reside.
The extra session of this congress
which closed during July last enacted
important legislation, and while its
full effect has not yet been realized,
what it has already accomplished as
sures us of its timeliness and wisdom.
To test its permanent value further
time will be required, and the people,
satisfied with its operation and results
thus far, are in no miiul to withhold
from it a fair trial.
The tariff legislation having been
settled by the extra session of con
gress, the questions pressing for con
sideration is that of the currency.
Ought Not to Hesitate.
With the great resources of the gov
ernment and with the honorable exam
ple of the past before us, we ought not
to hesitate to enter upon a currency
revision which will make our demand
obligations less onerous to the govern
ment and relieve our financial laws
from ambiguity and doubt.
The brief review of what was ac
complished from the close of the war
to 1S93 makes unreasonable and
groundless any distrust either of our
financial ability or soundness while
the situation from 1803 to 1897 must
admonish congress of the immediate
necessity of so legislating as to make
the return of the conditions then pre
vailing impossible.
Currency Question Pressing.
The work of putting our finances up
on a sound basis, difficult as it may
seem, will appear easier when we re
call the financial operations of the gov
ernment since I860. On the 30tli day
of June of that year we had outstand
ing demand liabilities in the sum of
$728,868,447.41. On the 1st of January,
1879, these liabilities had been reduced
to $43,889,495.88. Of our interest bear
ing obligations the figures are even
more striking. On July 1, 1800, the
principal of the interest bearing debt
was $2,332,331,208. On the 1st day of
July, 1893, this snm had been reduced
ot $585,037,100, or an aggregate reduc
tion of $1,747,294,108. The interest
bearing debt of the United States on
the 1st day of December, 1897, was
$847,365,620. The government money
now outstanding (December 1) con
sists of $346,681,016 of United States
notes, $107,793,280 of treasury notes is
sued by authority of the law of 1890,
$384,963,503 of silver certificates and
$61,280,761 of standard silver dollars.
Many Plans Proposed.
There are many plans proposed as a
remedy for the evil. It is not that our
currency of every kind is not good
good because the government, is
pledgcd to keep it so, and that pledge
will not be broken. However, the
guaranty of our purpose to keep the
pledge will be best shown by advanc
ing toward its fulfillment. The evil of
the present system is found in the
great cost, to t/he government of main
taining (he parity of our different
forms of money that is, keeping all
of them at par with gold. We surely
cannot be longer heedless of the bur
den this imposes upon the people even
under fairly prosperous conditions,
while the past four years have demon
strated that it is not only an expen
sive charge upon the government-, but
a dangerous menace to the national
credit.
Against Bond Issues.
It is manifest that we must devise
some plan to protect the government
opportunity for speculation, made
easy by the multiplied redemptions of
our demand obligations, or increase
the gold reserve for-their redemption.
Wo have $900,000,000 of currency which
the government, by solemn enactment
has undertaken to keep at par with
gold. Nobody is Obliged to redeem in
gold but the government. The banks
are not required to redeem in gold.
The gvernment is obliged to keep
equal with gold all its outstanding cur
rency and coin obligations, while its
receipts are not required to be paid in
gold. They are paid in every kind of
money but gold, and the only means
by which the government can with
certainty get gold is by borrowing. It
can get it in no other way when it
most needs it. The government, with
out any fixed gold revenue, is pledged
to maintain gold redemption, which it
has steadily and faithfully done, and
which, under the authority now given
it, will continue to do.

for this is made all the more apparent

it should not pny them out again ex

Secretary Gaue's Plan.
The secretary of the treasury has
outlined a plan in great detail for the
purpose of removing the threatened
recurrence of a depleted gold reserve
and save us from future embarrass
ment on that account. To this plan I
invite your careful consideration.
I concur with the secretary of the
treasury in his recommendation that
national banks be allowed to -issue
notes to the face value of the bonds
which they have deposited for circula
tion and that the tax on circulation of
1 per cent per annum. I join him in
recommending that authority be given
for the establishment of national
banks with a minimum capital of $25,
000. This will enable the smaller vil
lages and agricultural regions of the
country to be supplied with currency
to meet their needs.
National Bank Notes.
I recommend that the isssuc of na
tional bank notes be restricted to the
denomination of $10 and upwards. If
the suggestions I have herein made
shall have the approval of congress,
Present Insurrection.
The present insurrection broke out
in February, 1895. It is not my pur
pose at this time to recall its remark
able increase or to characterize its ten
acious resistance against- the enormous
forces massed against it by Spain.
The revolt and the efforts to subdue
it carried destruction to every quarter
of the island developing wide propor
tion's and defying the efforts of Spain
for its suppression. The civilized
code of war has been disregarded 110
less so by Spaniards than by the Cu
bans. The existing conditions cannot
but fill this government and the Amer
ican people with the gravest apprehen
sion. There is no desire on the part
of our people to profit by the misfor
tunes of Spain. We have only the de
sire to see the Cubans prosperous and
contented, enjoying that measure of
Eelf control which is the inalienable
right of man, protected in their right
to reap the benefit of the exhaustless
treasures of their country.
The offer made by my predecessor
in April, 1898, tenderingthefriendly of
fices of this government failed. Any
mediation on our part was not accept
ed. In brief the answer read: "There
is no effectual way to pacify Cuba un
less it begins with the actual submis
sion of the rebels to the mother coun
try." Then only could Spain act in the
promised direction of her own action
and after her own plans.
A Cruel Policy.
The cruel policy of concentration
was initiated February 16, 1896. The
productive districts controlled by the
Spanish armies were depopulated. The
agricultural inhabitants were herded
in ant1, about the garrison to die, their
lands laid waste and their dwellings
destroyed. This policy the late cabi
net of Spain justified as a necessary
measure of war and as a means of cut
ting off supplies from the insurgents.
It has utterly failed as a war measure.
It was not civilized warfare. It was
extermination.
War Will Not Bo Prolonged.
In the absence of a declaration of
the measures that this government
proposes to take in carrying out its
priffer of good offices it suggests that
Spain being free to conduct military
operations and grant the reforms,
while the United States for its part
shall enforce its neutral obligations
and cut off the assistance which it is
asserted the insurgents receive from
this country. The supposition of an
indefinite prolongation of the war is
denied. It is asserted that the west
ern provinces nre already well nigh
reclaimed that the planting of cane
and tobacco therein has been resumed,
and that by force of arms and new and
ample reforms very early and com
plete pacification is promised.
The immediate alteration of exist
ing conditions under the new admin
istration of Cuban affairs is predict

Untried Menaures.
Of the untried measures there re
main only: Kecoguition of the insur
gents as belligerents recognition of
the independence of Cuba neutral
intervention to end the war by impos
ing a rational compromise between the
contestants and intervention in favor
of one or the other party. I speak not
of forcible annexation for that cannot
be thought of. That by our code of
morality would bfc criminal aggres
sion.
Becognition of the belligerency of
the Cuban insurgents has often been
canvassed as a possible if not inevita
ble step both in regard to the previous
ten years struggle and during the
present war. I am not unmindful that
the two houses of congress in the
repeated re- spring of 1896 expressed the opinion their intimate commercial dependence
tiempuone. Wc must either curtail th^ by concurrent reeolution that a condi- upon thls.country. At the sum# time 11
tion of public war existed requiring or
justifying the state of belligerency in
Cuba and during the extra session the
senate voted a joint resolution of like
import which, however, was not
brought to a vote in the house of rep
resentatives. In the presence of these
significant expressions of the senti
ment of the legislative branch it be
hooves the executive to. soberly con
sider the conditions under which so
important a measure must needs rest
for justification. It is to be serious
ly considered whether the Cuban in
surrection possesses beyond dispute
the attributes of statehood which alone
can demand the recognition of bellig
erency in its favor. Possession, in
short, of the essential qualifications of
sovereignty by the insurgents and the
conduct of the war by tliem adding to
the acccpted code of war are no less
important factors toward the determ
ination of the problem of belligerency
than are the influences and conse
quences of the struggle upon the inter
national policy of the recognizing
state.
Utterances of Grant.
The utterance of General Grant in
his memorable message of December
7, 1875, are signally relevant to the
present situation in Cuba and it may
be wholesome now to rccall them. At
that time a ruinous conflict had for
seven years wasted the neighboring
island. During all those years an ut
ter disregard of the laws of civilized
warfare and of the just demands of
humanity, which called forth expres
sions of condemnation from the na
tions of Christendom, continued un
abated. Desolution and ruin pervaded
that productive region, enormously af
fecting the commerce of all commer
cial nations, but that of the United
States} more than any other by reason
of proximity and larger trade and in
tercourse. At that juncture Grant ut
tered these words which now as then
sum up the elements of the problem.
"A recognition of the independence of
Cuba being, in my opinion, impructi
"The contest, moreover, is solely on
land the insurrection lias not pos
sessed itself of a single seaport whence
it may send forth its flag, nor lias it
any means of communication with for
eign powers except through the mil
itary lines of the adversaries. No ap
prehension of any of these sudden and
difficult complications which occur on
the ocean is apt to precipitate upon the
vessels, both commercial and national
and upon the consular officers of other
powers calls for the definition of their
relations to the parties to the contest.
Avoid False Lights.
It is possible that the acts of for
eign powers, and even acts of Spain
herself of this very nature, might be
pointed to in defense of. such recogni
tion. But now, as in its past history,
the. United States should curefuliy
avoid the false lights which might
lead it into the mazes of doubtful law
and of questionable propriety, and ad
here rigidly and sternly to the rule
which has been its guide of doing only
that which is right and honest and of
then I would recommend that national good report. The question of accord
banks be required to redeem their
notes in gold.
Foreign Relations.
The most important problem with
whieh this government is now called
upon to consider pertaining to ita for
eign relations concerns its duty toward
Spain and the Cuban insurrection.
Problems and conditions more or less
in common with those now existing
have confronted this government at
various times in the past. The story
of Cuba for many years has been one
of unrest and growing discontent an
effort toward a larger enjoyment of
liberty and self control of organized
resistance to the mother country of
depression after distress and warfare
and of ineffectual settlement to be fol
lowed by renewed revolt. For no en
during period since the enfranchise
ment of the continental possessions of
Spain in the western continent has the
condition of Cuba or the policy of
Spain toward Cuba not caused concern
to the United States.
ing or of withholding rights of bellig
erency must be judged in every case,
in view of the particular attending
facts. Unless justified by necessity,
it is always, and justly regarded as an
unfriendly act and a gratuitous de
monstration of moral support to the
rebellion. It is necessary and it is re
quired, when the interests and rights
of an other government or of its people
are so far affected by a pending livil
conflict as to require a definition of
its relations to the parties thereto.
But this conflict must be one which
is recognized in the sense of interna
tional law as war.
Practical Aspects of Kcco^iiition
Turning to the practical aspects of a,
recognition of belligerency, reviewing
its inconveniences and positive dangers,
still further pertinent considerations ap
pear. In the code of nations there is no
such thing as a naked recognition of
belligerency unaccompanied by the as
sumption of international neutrality.
Such recognition without more will not
confer upon cither party to a domestic
conflict a status not theretofore actual
ly possessed or affect the relation ot
either party to other states. The act of
recognition usually takes the form of a
solemn pry:lamation of neutrality
which recites the de facto condition of
belligerency as its motive. It announces
a domestic law of neutrality in declaring
a state. It assumes the International
obligations of a neutrality In the pres
ence o£ a public state of war. It warns
all citizens and others within the Juris
diction of the proclaimant that they vio
late those rigorous obligations at their
own peril and cannot expect to be shield
ed from the consequences. The light of
visit and search on the seas and seizure
of vessels and cargoes and contrabands
of war and good prizes under admiralty
law must under international law De ad
mitted as a legitimate consequence of a
proclamation ot belligerency. While ac
cording the equal belligerent rights de
fined by public law to each party in lr
ports disfavors would be imposed on
both, which while nominally equal
would weigh heavily in behalf of Spuln
herself. Possessing a navy and con
trolling the ports of Cuba her maritime
rights could be asserted not only for the
military investment of the island, but
up to the margin of our own terti torlal
waters, and a condition of things would
exist for which the Cubans within their
own domain could not hope to create a
parallel, while its creation through aid
or sympathy from within our domain
would be even more impossible than
now, with the additional obligations of
international neutrality we would per
force assume.
Gives Sagasta a Clinnce.
That the government of Sogasta has
entered upon a course from which re
cession with honor is impossible can
hardly be questioned that the few
weeks it has existed it has made rankest
ot the sincerity of iti professions is un
deniable. I shall not Impugn its sincer
ity nor should Impatience be suffered to
embarrass it in the tasit. it has under
taken. It is honestly due to Spain and
to our friendly relations with Spain that
she should be given a reasonable chance
to realize her expectations and to prove
the asserted efficiency of the new order
of things to which she stands irrevoc
ably committed. She has recalled the
commander whose brutal orders in
flamed the American mind and shocked
the civilized world. She has modified
the horrible order of concentration and
has undertaken to care for the helpless
and permit those who desire to resume
the cultivation of their fields to- do so,
and assures them of the piotectlon of
the Spanish government in their lawful
occupations. She has Juft released the
Competitor prisoners who were sen
tenced to death and who have been the
subject of repeated diplomatic corre
spondence during both this and the pre
ceding administration.
T!:e Hawaiian Question.
By a special message, dated the IGth
day of June last, I laid before the senate
a treaty signed that day by the plenipo
tentiaries ot the United States and of
the republic of Hawaii, having for its
purpose the Incorporation of the Hawai
ian islands aa an Integral part of the
United States and under its sovereignty.
The senate having removed the injunc
tion of secrecy, although the treaty Is
still pending before that body, the sub
ject may be properly referred to In this
message, because the necessary Notion
of the congress is required to determine
by legislation the numy details of the
eventual union should the fact of annex
ation be accomplished, -ie 1 believe it
shou'.d be. While consistently disavow
ing from a very early period any
aggressive policy of absorption In re-.

has been repeatedly asserted that in no
event could the entity of Hawaiian
statehood cease by the passage of the
Islands under the domination or influ
ence of another power than the United
States. Under these circumstances the
logic of event required annexation here
tofore offered but declined should in the
ripeness of time come about as the nat
ural result of the strengthening ties that
bind us to those islands, aiid ba realized
by the free will of the Hawaiian state,
That the treaty wfcs unanimously rati
fied without amendment by the senate
and by the republic of Hawaii on the
10th of September lost and oniy awaits
the favorable action of the American
senate to effect the complete absorption
of the Islands into the domain of the
United States. What the conditions of
such a union shall be, the political rela
tion thereof to the United States, the
character of the local administration,
the quality and degree of elective fran
chise of the inhabitants, the extension
of the federal laws to the territory or
the enactment of special law to fit the
peculiar condition thereof, the regula
tion of need be labor system therein, are
all matters which the treaty has wisely
relegated to the congress.

Costa Rica, I have concluded that Mr.
William Merry, confirmed as minister
of the United States to the states of
NioaTagua, Salvador and Costa ltlcia,
shall proceed to San Jose, Costa Hlca,
and there temporarily establish the
headquarters of the United States to
those three stales. I took this action
for what regarded as the paramount
interests of this country. It was devel
oped upon an Investigation by the sec
retary of state that the government of
Nicaragua, while not unwilling to re
ceive Mr. Merry in his diplomatic qual
ity, was unable to do so because of the
compact concluded June 20, 1S65. where
by the republic and those of Salvador
and Honduras, forming what is known
as the Greater republic of Central Amer
ica, had surrendered to the representa
tive diet thereof their right to receive
and send diplomatic agents The diet
was not willing to accept him because
he was not accredited to thttt body I
could not accredit him to that body be
cause the appropriation law of congress
did not permit it. Mr. Baker, the pres
ent minister at Managua, has been di
rected to present his letters of recall.
Mr. Godfrey Hunter has likewise been
accredited to the governments of Gua
temala and Honduras, the same as his
predecessor. Guatemala Is not a mem
ber of the Greater Republic of Central
America, but Honduras Is. Should this
latter government decline to receive him
he has been instructed to report this fact
to his government and await its further
Instructions.
The Xicaraguii Canal.
A subject of large importance to our
country and increasing appreciation on
th6 part ot the people is the completion
of the great highway of trade between
the Atlantic and Pacific, known r.s the
Niearaguan canal. Its utility and value
to American commerce Is universally
admitted. The commission appointed
under date of July 24 last to continue the
by the act approved March 2, 1895, "in
regard to the proper route, feasibility
and tost of construction of the Nicar
aguan canaJl, with a view of making
complete plans for the entire work of
construction of such canal," js now em
ployed in the undertaking. In the fu
ture 1 shall take occasion to transmit to
congress the report of this commission,
making at the same time further sug
gestions as may then seem advisable.
Bimetallism.
Under the provisions of the act of con
gress approved March 3, 1897, for the
promotion of an international agree
ment respecting bimetallism, I appoint
ed on the 14tli day of April, 1S97, Hon.
Edward O. Woleott of Colorado, Hon.
Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois and Hon.
James A. Payne of Massachusetts as a
special convoy to represent the United
States. They have been diligent in their
efforts to secure the co-operation of Eu
ropean countries in the internatinoal
settlement of the question, but up to this
time nave not been ab*:e Io secure an
agreement contemplated by their mis

KroiprociO.
In o-iier ».c execute as nearly ?.« possible
.ho provisions in the third ~-'d fourth sec
tions of the revenue act, approved July 24,
IS97. I appointed the Hon. John A. Kusson
cf Iowa, a special commissioner plenipo
tentiary undertake the re'ju,»lte nego
tiation." wt foreign ccantrles desiring to
ivall the.-. vc-s ot these provisions. The
negotiations «ro now proceeding with sev
eral governments, both European and
American r.nd It is believed that bv a
rareful exercise of the powers confei-ed
by that act some grievances of our own
and of ot'icr countries in our mutual
trade relations may be either removed,
or largely alleviated, and that the vol
ume of our commercial exchanges may
bo enlarged, with advantage to both con
tracting parties.
Merchant Marine.
Most desirable from every standpoint
national interest and patriotism, is the
effort to extend our foreign commerce.
To this end our merchant marine should
be Improved and enlarged. We should do
our full share of the carrying trade of
the world. Wo do not do it now. AVe
should be the lagger no longer. The in
feriority of our merchant marine Is justly
humiliating to the national pride. The
government by every proper constitution
al means should aid in making our ships
familiar visitors at every commercial port
of the world, thus opening up new and
valuable markets to the surplus product
of the farm and the factory.
£eal Question.
The efforts which had been made during
llie two p:-»v!fc years by my predecessor
lo secure better protection to the fur
/eals In the north Paelllc ocean and
Bering sea weio renewed at an early date
*y this administration and have been pur
rued with earnestness. Upon my invita
tion the governments of Japan and llus
sia sent delegates to Washington and an
international conference was held during
Ihe months of October und November last,
wherein it was unanimously agreed that
jnder the existing regulations this species
of useful animals was threatened with ex
tinction and tha: an International agree
ment of all the interested parties was ne
cessary for llielr adequate proieciion.
The government of Great Hritnlu did
not see proper to be represented at this
conference, bat subsequently sent to
Washington as dclegntes, the expert com
missioners of Great Britain and Canada,
vvho had during the past two years vis
ited the Prebyloff islands, and who met
In conference similar commissioners on
Ihe part of the United Slates. The result
ijf this conference was an agreement on
Important facts connected with the con
dition of the seal herd heretofore In dis
pute which should place beyond contro
versy the duty of the government's con
rcned to adopt measures without delay
for the preservation and restoration of
the herd. Negotiations to this end arc
now in progress, tlia result of which 1
nope to be able to report to congress at
an early day.
liitei-nulional Arbitral Ion.
International arbitration cannot bo
omitted from the list of subjects claiming
aur conspiration. Events have only
lerved to strengthen the general vlewc on
this question expressed In my inaugural
iddress. The best sentiment of the civil
ized world is moving towaro the settle
ment of differences between nations with
out resorting to the horrors of war. Treat
ies embodying these humane principles on
broad lines without any way imperiling
ur interests or our honor shall have my
constant encouragement.
Paris Exposition
The acceptance by this government of
the invitation of tho Republic ef France
r_
1 ,n
*„•. ,h® ,'f 1JW at Paris was immediately followed
inree. ,y the appointment of a fpnt-lal commls-
the universal exposition
iloner to represent the United Slates in
ihe proposed exhibition with special refer
snce to tho securing of space for an ade
quate exhibit on behalf of the United
States.
The special commissioner delayed his de
parture for Paris long enough to asrertain
&
if
the probable demand for space by Amer
ican exhibitors. His inquiries developed
an almost unprecedented interest in the
proposed exposition, and the Information
thus acquired enabled him to justify An
application for a much larger allotment Of
space for the American section than had
been reserved by the exposition authuri*
ties. The result was particularly gratify
ing in view of the fact that the United
States was one of the last countries to ac
cept the invitation of France.
The reception accorded our special com
missioner was most cordial and he was
given very reasonable assurance that the
United Staten would receinve a consider
ation commensurate with the proportion
of our exhibit. The report of the special
commission as to the magnitude and Im
port of the coming exposition and the
great demand for space by American ex*
hibltors supplies new arguments for a lib
eral and judicious appropriation by con
gress to the end that an exhibit fairly
representative of tho industries and re
sources of our country may be made in an
exposition which will illustrate the world's
progress during the nineteenth century*
That exposition Is Intended to be the most
Important and comprehensive of the long
series of International exhibitions. o£
which our own at Chicago was a brilliant
example and It desires that tho United
States should make a worthy exhibit of
Ameilcan genius and skill in their rivalled
achievements in every branch of Industry.
Our Navy.
The present Immediately effective navy
consists of four battleships of the first
class, two of the second and forty-eight
other vessels, ranging from armored
cruisers to torpedo boats. There are un
der construction live battleships of the
first class, sixteen torpedo boats and one
submarine boat. No provision has yet
been made for the armor of three of the
live battleships as It has been impossible
to obtain It at the price fixed by congress.
It Is of great importance that congress
provide this armor, as until then the shtp3
are of no fighting value.
The present naval force, especially In
view of its increase by the ships now un
der construction, while not as large as
that of a few other powers, is a formid
able force its vessels are the very best of
each type and with the increase that
should be made to It from time to time In
the future nnd careful attention lo keep
ing it In a high state of efficiency and re
pair. it. Is well adapted to the necessities
of the country.
Ii\v Ioi.*ks Needed.
Tho great increase of the navy which
has taken phuc In recent years was justi
fied by the requirements for national de
fense nnd has received public approba
tion. The time has now nrrlved, however,
when this Increase to which the country
is commuted, should, for a time, take tho
form of Increased facilities commensurate
with the Increase of our naval vesels. It
Is an unfortunate fact that there Is only
one dock on the Pacific coast capable of
docking 'Ujr largest ships, and only one
on the Atlantic const, and that tJie latter
has for six 01 seven months been under
repair and therefore incapable of use.
Immediate Meps should be taken to pro
vide three or four docks of this capacity
on the Atlantic coast, at least one on the
Pacific coast, and a floating dock on the
gulf. This is the recommendation of a
very competent board, appointed to in
vestisnte the subject. There should also
be amp'te provision made for powder and
projectiles, and other munitions of war,
and for an increased number of officers
and enlisted men. Some additions are
also necessary to our navy yards for tho
repair and care ot our larger number of
vessels. As ti.e^o are now on the stocks
five battleships of the largest class, which
cannot be completed for a year or two, I
concur with the recommendation of the
secretary of the navy for an appropria
tion authorizing the construction of one
battleship for the X'aclfic coast, where at
present there Is only one In commission
and one under construction, while on the
Atlantic coast there are three In com
mission and four under (onstruction and
also that several torpedo boats be author
ized In connection with our general sys
tem of coast defenso.
Alaska Needs Attention.
The territory of Alaakn. requires the
prompt nnd early attention of congress.
Tho conditions now existing demand ma
terial changes In the laws relating to the
territory. The great influx of population
during the past summer and fall and the
prospect of a still larger immigration in
the spring will not permit us lo longer
neglect the extension of civil authority
within the territory or postpone the estab
lishment of a ..lore thorough government.
A general \v« of public surveys has
not been exttvued to Alaska, and all the
entries thus far made In that district are
upoji special surveys. The act of con
gress extending lo Alaska the mining
laws of the United States contained the
reservation that it should not b? con
strued to put in force the gcnral land laws
of the country. By an art approved March
3, 1891, authority was given for the entry
of lands for town site purposes and also
for the purchase of not exceeding 1G0
acres, then or thereafter occupied for the
purpose of trade and manufacture. The
purpose of congress as thus far expressed
has been that only such rights should ap
ply to that territory as should be specific
ally named.
It will be scc-n how much remains to be
done for the vast, remote and yet most
promising portion of our country. Spe
cial authority was given to the president
by the act of congress, approved July 21,
1S97, to divide that territory into two land
districts and lo designate the boundaries
thereof, and to appoint registers and sur
veyors of said iand offli es, and the presi
dent was also authorized to appoint a sur
veyor general for the entire district. Pur
suant to this authority a surveyor gen
eral and receiver have been appointed,
with offices at Sitka. If, In the ensuing
year the conditions justify it. the addi
tional land district authorized by law will
be established, with an ofllce at some
point In the Yukon valley. No appropria
tion, however, was made for this purpose,
and that is now necessary to be done for
tho two land districts into which the ter
ritory is to be divided.
Military Force Needed*
I concur with the secretary of war In
his suggestions as to the necessity for a
military force In the territory of Alaska
for the protection of persons and prop
erty. A'.'e&dy a small force, consisting of
twenty-five men. with two officers, under
command of Lieutenant Colonel Randall
of the Eighth infantry, has been sent to
St. Michael to establish a military pest.
As it Is to ine Interests of the government
to enrournge the settlement of the coun
try and its duty to folow up Us citizens
with the benent of legal niachlnerv, I
earnestly urge upon congress the estab
lishment of a system of government with
such flexibility as will enable it to ad
just itself to the future areas of greatest
population.
Famine oil the Yukon.
The startling, though possibly e: agcer
ated, reports from the Yukon river coun
try of the probable shortage of food for
the large number of people who are enter
ing there \yithout the means of leaving
tho country are confirmed in such a meas
ure as to justify bringing the matter to
the attention of congress. Access to that
country in winter can be had only oy the
passes from Dyea and vicinity, which is a
most difficult and perhaps impossible ta^k.
However, should these reports of the suf
fering of our. fellow citizens be further
verified every effort at anv cost should be
made to carry them relief.
The Indians.
For a number of years past it has been
apparent thai the conditions under which
the five civilized tribes were cstablised In
the Indian territory under the treaty pro
visions with ihe United States, whh the
right of self-government and the exclu
sion of all while persons from within their
borders, have undergone so complete a
change as to render the continuance of
Ihe system thus inaugurated practically
impossible. The total number of the five
civilized tribes, as shown by tha last cen
sus, is 45.494. and this number has not ma
terially increased, while the white popu
lation is estimated at fror.j JiCO.tOO to 239,000,
which by permission of the Indian govern
ment has settled in the territory. The
present area of tho Indian territory con
tains 25.G04,5f4 acres, much of which Is
very fertile land. The United States cit
izens residing In the territory most of
whom have gone there by Invitation or
with the consent of the tribal authorit es,
have made permanent homes for them
selves. Numerous towns have been built
in which from 500 to 5,000 white people no
reside. Valuable residences and business
houses have been erected In many of
them. Large business enterprises are car
ried on In which vast sums of money are
employed, and yet these people who have
invested their capital in the development
of the productive resources of the coun
try, aro without title to the land they oc
cupy and have no voice whatever in the
government cither of the nations or tribes
Thousands of their children who were
born in the territory aro of school age,
but the doors of the schools of the na
tions are shut againfi them, and what
education they get is by private contribu
tion. No provisions for the protection of
the life and property of these while citi
zens was made by the tribal covernments
and courts.
I concur with the secretary of the ln{er
ior that there can be no cure for the evils
engendered by the perversion of these
great trusts excepting by their resump
tion by the government which created
them.
The provision in the Indian appropri
ation act, approved June 10, 1896, made
it the duty of the commission to Investi
gate and determine the rights of appli
cants for citizenship In the five civilized
tribes.
The commission is at present engaged in
this work among the tribes, and has made
appointments for taking the census of
these people up lo and including the 30th
of this month.
Should the agreement between the Choc
taws and Chlckasaws be ratified by con
gress, and should the other tribes fall
to make an agreement with the commis
sion, then it will be necessary that some
legislation shall be had by coneres*
which, while just ojid honorable to th*
Indians, shall be equitable to the white
people who have settled upon these lands
by Invitation of the tribal nations.
Hon, Henry L#. Dawes, chairman of the
commission, in a letter to the secretary of
the interior under date of October 11. 1897,
aays:
"Individual ownership is in their (the
commission's) opinion absolutely essential
aw
4(
to any permanent improvenient in pres
ent conditions, and the lack of it is th*
rule of nearly all of the evils which
ously afflict these people. All agree that
it Is the oniy possible method unless tn
United States courts are clothed with tru
authority to apportion the lands among
the citlsen Indians for whose u&e it wai
originally granted."
Tlio Yellow Fever
The recent prevalence of yellow fe.e.
in a number of cities and towns through*
out the south, has resulted in much aisj
turbance of commerce and demonstrated
the necessity of such amendments to oui
quarantine laws as will make the regula
tions of the national quarantine authori
ties paramount.
In further effort to prevent the in
vasion of the United States by yellow
fever the ^importance of the discovery ol
the exact, cause of the disease, which up
to the present time has been undeter
mined, Is obvious, and to this end a sys*
tematlc bacteriological investigation
should be made. I therefore recommenc
that congress authorize the appolntmen*
of commission by the president, to con
sist of four expert Dacterlologists, one tc
be selected from the officers of the med
ical marine hospital service, ope to bo ap
pointed fifom civil life, one to be detailed
from the medical officers of the army,
and one from the medical officers of the
navy.
Tho Union Pnc'fle.
The Union Pacific railway main line has
been sold under the de ree of the United
Slates supreme court for the district of
Nebraska on the 1st and 2d of Novembet
of this year. The amount due the govern
ment consisted of the principal of the sub
sidy bonds. $27.236.512: and the accredited
interest thereon, $21,211,711.75 making the
total indebtedness $58,448,223.75. The b!d
ut the sale covered the first mortgage lien
and the entire mortgage claim of the gov
ernment. principal and Interest.
The sale of the subsidized portion of th^
Kansas Pacific line, upon which the gov
ernment holds a second mortgage lien,
has postponed at the Instance of the
gebtbeenthis
overnment to December lfl. 1&97. Tlu
of division of the Union Paclfi-,
railway on November 1. 1W7. was the prin
cipal of the subs'dy bonds. $6,303,000, and
the unpaid accrued Interest thereon, JO,
628,690.33. making total of $12,92U.G1«0.33,
The sale of this road was originally ad
vertised for December 4, but for the pur
pose of securing the utmost publ'c notice
of the event It was postponed before De
cember 16, ana a second advertisement ol
the sale was made. By the decree of tlu
court the price on the sa?e of the Kan
sas Pacific will yield to the government
the sum of $2,500,000 over all prior liens,
costs and charges. If no othor or bettei
bid is made this sum Is all that the gov
ernment will receive on claim of ncai
$13,000,000. The government has no infor
mation as to whether there will be othei
bidders or a better bid than the minimum
amount herein stated. The question pre
sented therefore Is: Whether the govern
ment shall under the authority given by
the act of March 3, 1597, purchase or re
deem the road In the ewnt a bid is not
made by the private parties covering the
government's claim. To qualify the gov
ernment to bid at the sales will require a
deposit of ^00,000,-hs follows.:
In the government $500,000 and in each
of the first mortgage causes $200,000, and
in the latter the deposit must be in cash.
Payments at the sale are as follows,
Upon the acceptance of the hid, a sum
which, with the anriount already depos
ited, shall equal 15 ppr cent of the bid
the balance in installments of 25 pei
cent thirty and fifty days after the con
firmation of the sale. The lien on the
Kansas Pacific prior to that of the gov
ernment on the 30th of July, 1897, prin
cipal and Interest, amounted to $7,281,
048.11. The government therefore, should
it become the highest bidder, will have
to pay the amount the first mortgage
lien.
1 believe that under the act of 1887 11
has the authority to do this and in ab
sence of any action by congress I shal)
direct the secretary of the treasury tc
make the necessary deposit as required
by the court's decree to qualify as a bid
der and to bid at the sale a sum which
will at least equal the principal of the
dfrbt due to the government but suggts»
in order to remove all controversy, thai
an amendment of the law be immediate,
ly passed, explicitly giving such powers
and appropriating in general terms
whatever sum is sufficient therefor.
In so important a matter as the gov.
ernment becoming the possible owner
of railroad property, which it perforce
must conduct and operate, I feel con
strained to lay before congress these
facts for its consideration and action be
fore the consummation of the sale. If
is clear to my mind that the government
should not permit the property to be sole
at a price which will yield less than one.
hulf of the principal of its debt and less
than one-»lfth of its entire debt, princi
pal! and interest. But whether the gov
ernment, rather than accept less than
Its claim, should become a bidder and
thereby the owner of the property,
submit to the congress for action.
The Utnary BuihHni
The library building piovidcd f«»r by
the act of congress approved April 15,
1SSG, has been completed and opened tc
the public. It should be a matter of
congratulation that through the fore
sight and munificence of congress the
nation jossesses this noble treasure
house of knowledge. It is earnestly to
be hoped that, having done so much to
ward the cause of education, congress
will continue to develop the library in
every phase of research to the end that
it may bo not only one of the most mag
nificent, but among the richest and mosf
useful libraries in the world.
Civil Scivice.
The important- branch of our gov
ernment known ns the civil service, th..»
practical improvement of which ha
long* been a subject of earnest discus
sion: has of late years received in
creased legislation nnd executive ap
proval. During the past few months
the service has been placed upon a
still firmer basis of business methods
and personal merit. While the right
of our veteran soldiers to reinstate"
ment in deserving eases has heen as
serted, dismissal:- for merely political
reasons have been carefully guarded
against, the examinations for admit
tance to the service enlarged and at
the same time rendered less technical
and more practical nnd a distinct ad
vance has been made by giving a hear
ing before dismissal upon nil cases
where incompetency is charged or de
mand made for the removal of officials
in any of the departments. This ord.»r
has been made to give to the accused
his right to be heard, but without in
any way impairing the power cf i\
lnovnl, whieh should always be exer
cised in eases of inefficiency and in
competency, and which is one of the
vital safeguards of the civil service re
form system, preventing stagnation
and dead \vood and keeping every em
ploye keenly alive to the fact that the
security of his future depends rot
upon his own tiMed and carefully
watched record of service.
Much, of course, still remains to be
accomplished before the system can
be made reasonably perfect for our
needs. There are places now in the
classified service which ought to be ex
empted and not. classified may prop
erly be included. shall not hesitate
to exempt cases which I think have
been improperly included in the clas
sified service, or include those which
in my judgment will best promote the
public service. The system has the ap
proval of the people and it will be my
endeavor to uphold and extend it.
Dcpartmrr.tal Reports.
I am forced by the length of this
message to omit many important ref
erences to affairs of the government
with which congress will have to deal
at the present session. They are fully
discussed in the departmental reprts,
to nil of whieh I invite your earnest
attention.
The estimates of the expenses of the
government, by the several depart
ments will, I am sure, have your care
ful scrutiny. While the congress may
not find it an easy task to reduce the
Expenses of the government, it should
not. encourage their increase. These
expenses will, in my judgment, admit
of a decrease in-«jnr.y branches of the
government without injury to the pub
lic service. It is a commanding duty
to heep the appropriations within the
receipts of the government and thus
••.void a deficit.. William McKinley.

Fast Over Past
Records.
D&idwcod, Dcc. 7.—The general trav
eling agent ol the Burlington railway,.
A. B. Noble, has just finished piloting
si party of eastern capitalists through
the Black Hills. Of this rich country
Mr. Noble says:
"The Klondike boom has been tfce
best, thing tfeat ever happened to thtf
Black Hills. It has created a wide
spread interest in mining, and there is«
a continually increasing demand from
every part of the United States fw in
formation about the llills. The io€fts»
of the majority of the inquirers abort*
the country are vague. They have
heard that it is a gold producing coun
try, but when you give them the fig
ures of a year's output of gold they
are astonished and say, 'That's good
enough Klondike for me/ Most of
them imagine the Black llills to be a
bleak, dreary region with only one
town in it, and they have all heard of
that place, and think of it in connec
tion with murders, robbers and re
volvers and ropes dangling from tho
limbs of trees with loops at the end—
Deadwood. They think that all of the
gold is mined at Deadwood and that
civilization was never heard of there
and'the people are often incredulous'
when presented with the facts. It's
queer what notions some people have
of the country. I suppose it is be*
cause those who have paying mines
listen to the sound of their falling
stamps and let the world move on in
its ignorance. When I get a party cor
ailed so I can tell them what there
really is out there in the way of re
sources it generally ends in their coin
ing out to see fr themselves. Of tho
sixty-four minerals, sixty-two have
been found in the Hills and experts
think they have found another one re
cently. Sometimes when am travel
ing and see a chance to do business, I
pull a piece of ore out of my pockefc
with the gold sticking out of it and
pass it around for inspection. The.v
cluster around me like bees asking all
sorts of questions. A few good sam
ples of ores should be distributed in
the eastern cities as an advertisement.
The next five years will bring an enor
mous amount of capital into this sec
tion for investment and in ten years
it will be the most densely populated
part of the United States."
LAND OFFICE BUSINESS GOOD
At Aberdeen It Hits Been Better
Than Usual.
Aberdeen, Dec. 7.—Th« business trans
acted at the United States land ortlce in
this city for the month of November ex
ceeded in proportions that of any previ
ous period of thirty days for a year or
more past. There were forty-five timber
culture proofs, embracing 7,200 acres
twenty-four homastead proofs, embrac
ing 3,420 acres thirty-four homeseadi
entries, embracing over 4,000 acres.
There were four commuted homestead
proofs, and the cash receipts for the
month were 51,034. It will be conceded
that this is disposing of Uncle Sam's do
main at a very satisfactory rate.
Register Hopkins states that in the
neighborhood of 75,000 acres of land in
this district will shortly be held for can
cellation under those provisions of the
land laws which declare that the life of
a timber culture entry, when no effort is
made to live up to its obligations by the
entry man, is thirteen years and that of
a homestead entry eight years. Entries
of this character were generally made in
early days and quite frequently by those
who had never inspected the land upon
which they filed. An occasional quarter
in fairly well settled districts is some
times cancelled. All tracts so cancelled
are open to other entries, and, as the
November business would indicate,
many such, as well as many quarters of
land never before filed upon, are being
taken.
ANALYZING THE DISIOASK.
What llie Department Says About
It.
Chamberlain, Dec. 7.—During the.
past few weeks a number of fanners
in this vicinity have lost from three to
ten or a dozen head of cattle each
from causes which bailie those who
are expert in such matters, in near
ly every instance the death of the cat
tle resulted immediately after turning
the animals into fields containing
cornstalks The matter was reported
to Dr. D. K. Salmon, chief of the bu
reau of animal industry at Washing
ton, who has now replied that the
cause of the death of the cattle is
known to his bureau as "Toxamia Mai
dis." The authorities have lately been
investigating the disease, but have not
yet found the cause. Although the
cattle are first affected in cornstalk
fields, it is given as the opinion of
Chief Salmon that the disease is not
directly due to smut—as many farm
ers believed—or the cornstalks. It is
thought to be caused by germs, or
from chemical poison in certain stalks.
Pending a careful investigation Dr.
Salmon advises farmers to keep their
eatttle away from standing cornstalks.
A curious feature of the matter is that
when the stalks are cut and properly
cured the disease, which is not eon*
tagious. does not appear.
