PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Tbe message ot the. President wai
read to both Houses of Congress yester
day. There ia little in it to interest our
readers. It discusses principally the
dry details of our diplomatic relations
with other nations, branches off to the
national debt, to slavery, to tax and
tariff, etc., etc., and finally comes to the
main points of the message Ku-Klux
and amnesty. It will surprise the
reader to be informed that he goes so
far as to suggest that it is now time to
remove Southern disabilities. We quote
that part of the message which refers to
this subject:
More than six Tears havinir elarjsed
since the last hostile gun was fired be
tween the armies then arrayed against
each other, one for the perpetuation and
the other for thejdestruction of the Union,
it may well be considered whether it is
not now time that the disabilities im
posed by the Fourteenth Amendment
should be removed; that amendment
does not exclude the ballot, but only re
quires the disability to hold office of
certain classes; when tne purity 01 tne
ballot and secure majorities are sure to
elect an officer reflecting tbe views of
the majority, 1 do not see the advantage
or propriety of excluding men from of
fice merely because they were before
the rebellion of a standing and charac
" ter sufficient to be elected to positions
requiring them to take an oath to sup
port the Constitution, and admitting to
eligibility those entertaining precisely
the same views, but of less standing in
their communities. It may be said that the
former violated an oath, while the latter
did not. The latter did not have it in their
power to do so. It they had taken the
oath, it cannot be doubted they would
have broken it as did the former class.
If there are any great criminals distin
guished above all others for the part they
took in opposition to the Government,
they might, in the judgment of Congress,
be excluded from such an amnesty. This
subject is submitted for your careful con
sideration. The condition of the South
ern States are, unhappily, not such as
all true, patriotic citizens would like to
see social ostracism for opinion's sake,
personal violence or threat toward per
sons entertaining political views opposed
to those entertained by the majority of
the old citizens, prevents immigration
and the flow ol much-needed capital
into the States lately in rebellion. It
will be a happy condition of the country
when the old citizens of these States will
take an interest in public affairs, pro
mulgate ideas bouestly entertained, vote
for men representing their views, and
permit the same freedom of expression
of opinion and ballot in tnose entertain
inir different Dolitical convictions.
This arraignment of the Southern
oeonle will go all over the civilized
world, and remain forever unrelated
Ho attributes the lack of Southern emi
gration to the intolerance of Southern
sentiment, and professes to desire the
time to come when, the old citizens will
take an interest in public affairs. Is he so
stupid as not to know that that is just
what they have been for six years strug
gling for, but have been confronted and
headed off at every point by bis hostile
agents, an army of carpet-baggers, and
the devil? The reader will probably
wish to know what the President has to
say concerning the Ku-Klux outrage:
In a portion of tbe State of South
Carolina the necessity of tbe course
pursued will be demonstrated by the re
port 01 tne committee to investigate
Southern outrages. Under the provis
ions of the above act, I issued a procla
mation calling tbe attention ot tbe peo-
Dle of the United Mates to tbe same,
and declaring my reluctance to exercise
hit of the extraordinary powers there
by conferred upon me, except in case of
imperative necessity, Dut malting mown
my Durnose to exert such powers when
ever it should become necessary to do
so. for the Durnose of securing to all
citizens of the United States the peace
ful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed
to them by the Constitution and the
laws. After the passage of this law.
information was received from time to
time that combinations of tbe char
acter referred to in this law ex
itted and were powerful in many
parts of the southern states, par
ticularly in certain counties in the
State of Sooth Carolina. A careful
vestigation was made, and it was found
that in nine counties of that State such
combinations were active and powerful
embracing a sufficient portion of tbe cit
izens to control tbe local autbority, and
havinsr. among other things, the object
of depriving the emancipated class of
the substantial benefits of freedom, and
of Drosecuting tbe free political action
of those citizens who did not sympathize
with their own views. Among their ope
rations were tbe frequent scounngs ot
the country and occasionally assassina
tions, generally perpetratea in me mgpi
J.y disguised persons, the victims, in
almost all cases, being citizens of differ-
nt noh Leal sentiments from their own,
or free persons who had shown a dispo
sition to claim equal rights with other
citizens, thousands ol inonensive and
well disposed citizens were the
enfferers by this lawless violence.
Thereupon, on the 13th of October,
1871, a proclamation, was issued
the terms of the law, calling upon
the members of the combinations to
disperse within five days and to deliver
to the marshal or military officers of the
United States all arss. ammunition,
uniforms, -disguises and other means and
implements uv-A by them for carrying
out their unlawful purposes. ibis
warning, not having b-n heeded, cn
the 17th of November another proclama
tion was uuued, suspending the habeas
corpus in nine counties in that Slate.
Direction was gireo that within the
counties so deitignatd persons supposed
upon creditable information to be mem
bers of suck unlawful combinations
should be eire.UHj by the military torees
of tbe United States, and delivered to
the marshal, to b dealt with according
jo law. In two of said counties l'ork
o i Spartanslmrg many arrests have
h0 made. At ibe last accounts the
coa.!- of persons tons am-swa .
,,!, -d and si:y-ight Several

tained to be of aa inferior degree were
rrUwd for the preset1- the having
I generally made confessions of their
guilt. Great caution has been exercised
in making test arrests, and, notwithstand
ing the large number, it is believed that
no innocent person is now in custody.
The prisoners will be held for regular
trial in the judicial tribunals of the
United States. As soon as it appeared
that the authorities of the United States
were about to take vigorous measures to
enforce the law, these parties absconded,
and there is good ground for supposing
that all of such persons have violated
the law. A full statement has been done
under this law, and will be submitted to
Congress by the Attorney General. In
the South there still remains a remnant
of barbarism repugnant to civilization,
decency and to the laws of the United
States.
GOHK BACK.
Senator Trumbull says he would not
run for the Presidency against Grant.
He pretends to thiuk that the defeat of
Grant would be a signal for tbe explo
sion of all the hoarded passions of the
South.. Some time since this man, in a
publio speech, said that the issue before
the country was whether we shall have a
constitutional government, or a consoli
dated despotism. Who was to be the
despot? Grant, of course. And yet
this man turns round and announces
that the country is not in a condition to
dismiss the man who is to become a des
pot. There is something about Badi-
calism that is difficult to comprehend
What oaths may bind the party together
we know know not, but it is certain that
every man who, from a sense of honor
or justice, licks in its traces, is merci-
lessly scourged back into obedience,
The people who distrust tyranny and all
sorts of official rascalities had begun to
respect Trumbull, but his recent course
spoils it all.

NEW TOBK.
HIS SLATES.
Horace Greeley, in a recent
letter,
says:
I have not yet formed a decided opin
ion as to the man who ought to be our
next Republican candidate for Presi
dent; but it seems to me advisable that
h ahnuM ha steadfast, consistent be
liever in the good old Whig doctrine of
one Presidential term.
Greeley does not like the President;
that is clear. Yet this same Greeley
will run back to him when the fire opens
and the horizon is blazing all round.
Radical eppositiss to Grant seems to be
what the doctors call sporadic. His
whip of many thongs plays effectually
over the shoulders of his slaves. It is
mere mocking for tbe Tribune to talk of
the good old Whig doctrines. They may
be effete now, and though that paper be
lieves that they are right, it will bow at
last in submission to different doctrines.
How hollow are the professions - of poli
ticians! Greeley will comedown from
his Presidential horse and swear that
Grant is the best man on earth. Poor
slave.
SHEHMAB OH THE SOUTH.
A correspondent of the Boston Tran
script says that General Sherman, in
conversation at the Astor House, New
York, the night before his departure for
Europe, said he believed the govern
ment had made a serious mistake in tbe
treatment of the South, that he was of
the opinion that a wise policy toward
that portion of the country would, ere
this, have resulted in a pacification and
general good. He is reported by this
correspondent to have said:
They are sot all rascals in the South.
A majority of the people are the best
citizens ol tne Kepuonc. ine young
men that followed tbe retreating Con
federates in Texas, the men of the Army
of Virginia and the lads of the West
went with the 8outh, were capital fel
lows though mistaken. These, in my
opinion, should have been appointed to
positions under the Government, as
marshals, postmasters, internal revenue
collectors and toUher Federal and State
offices, instead of being driven into op
nnsition. I really believe that these
young men represented the South, and
that they were ready to cry peecavi, and
unnnrt the Government. I am sorry
they were not treated properly, but it
win oe ngnt in me mu.
THE GEE AT EETITALI8T.
Of the Bev. Mr. Earle, the great revi
valist who has been recently preaching
in Middle Tennessee, the Union and
American says:
Many who heard him are enthusiastic
in his praise, while others express them
selves as disappointed, and yet all go
to har bim and seem wholly absorbed
by what is said. The Holy Spirit has
sealed Mr. Earle's ministry as that of no
other living man has been sealed. One
single sermon of his. repeated on differ
ent occasions, has been the means of
converting more than seven thousand
sinners. We think him, as an orator,
equal to any man we ever heard, although
we freely admit that certain fluencies of
diction and graces of delivery are want
ing. But for vividness of thought and
clearness of expression and ability to
arrest and hold the attention of all ages
and classes, we know not his superior.
New York, December 6. The de
tails of the Havana massacre are inter
esting. On Thursday, the twenty-third
ultimo, there being no lecture to the
first class of the medical students, young
men under eighteen years of age, some
of them went to the cemetery and in a
frolic foolish, of course, and highly it
prehensible broke the glass of the niche
of Gonzalo Castron's grave. The fact got
to the ears of the volunteers, their ene
mies, and a number at once went to ver
ify the fact. On ascertaining the truth
of the report the rage of the volunteers
was fearful. They ran to their armories,
got their guns and roamed aoout tne
city like wild beasts. Mostof the houses
were closed and the city seemed deserted
by all except the volunteers. On Satur
day acting Captain-General Caespo,
after s visit to the Medical College, hav
ing failed to discover the perpetrators of
the glass breaking, immediately arrested
the whole class, composed of forty-six
young men.
On Sunday the home guards and the
volunteers fiGOO troops were reviewed
on the ground, and soon as they were
dismissed they broke into shouts and
yells, demanding the heads of the dese
crators of Castanon's grave. As the tu
mult increased in the evening General
Craspo, who probably intended to have
the offender! tried by a civil court, be
coming alarmed bowed to the will of the
volunteers, and consented to have the
whole class tried by a drum-head court
martial. The concessions were in real
ity a delivery of the whole class, which
numbered among its members some of
the best families in the place, to death,
for, although eight only so far have been
executed, the thirty-two others are con
demned to the chain-gang for periods
varying from two to ten years, and in
their positions it will be impossible for
the young men to survive the fatigue
and torture to which they will be sub
jected. The eight victims are by far the most
mercifully treated. They wire horn on
the Island, and the fathers of some of
them are Spaniars and bitter enemies of
the Cubans. The mothers are all Cu
bans. The newspapers of the city are abso
lutely afraid of the ill-will of the brutal
volunteers, and have united in a mani
festo demanding the blood of the young
men as a sample of what the treatment
of the thirty-six students may expect
who were not condemned to death, and
whose only offense seems to be that they
belonged to the same class, for very
maay of them did not even go the cem
etery. They were yesterday escorted,
together with the eight condemned to
death, to the place of execution in the
gard of convicts, with their hair cropped
and balls and chains on their feet, to
witness the massacre of their class.
No representative of the United States,
unless backed by a man-of-war in port,
dares to lift his voice against the volunteers.

United States Judge Busteed charged
the jury at Montgomery that sympathy
for tbe Ku-Klux is participation with
them. How does the old United Staus
fool propose to dive into peoples' minds
and ascertain their sympathies?
Tbe North has many advantages not
accorded to the South. One of them is
the right to break open jails and Ku-
Klux prisoners without being considered
Ku-Klux. Of thi sort of thing, a Nor
thern paper sayi: If tbe recent lynch
ing and attempted lynching in Indiana
had occurred in any Southern State,
does any one suppose that Grant would
not immediately have suspended the
habeas corpus and declared martial law?

Chicago, December 5. The new com

and Alderman McAvoy was elected
President. The retiring Mayor, Mason,
delivered a brief address, and the new
Mayor, Medill, followed with a lengthy
inaugural, in which he shows the city
debt to be $14,2.12,767; estimated ex
penses for the present year, $1,041,000;
municipal losses of property by fire,
$2,509,240. The Mayor advises caution
in ordering further special assessments
for the city, the Superior Court decisions
having made them hazardous. He
recommends that the fire limits, within
which there shall be no wooden struc
tures, be made co-extensive with tbe
city limits, and that a supply of water,
independent of the water-works, be fur
nished as a precaution against fire.

warmly greeted by the audience. She
sang the Shadow Song ( Pardon de

In the songs " She Wanders Down the

an,d the Duo, " Crispeno e la Comare,"
she fairly took the house by storm and
was compelled to accept several encores,
Of her voice it is almost needless to
state that it is cultivated in the highest
degree. It has been remarked that Mrs.
Moulton' s is an American voice, enrich
ed with certain gifts that are entirely
exceptional. It reminds one a little of
Miss Kellogg's, though it is fuller than
her's in the lower register being not a
soprano but a mezzo-soprano and a
trifle less clear in the upper; but it has
a more remarkable vibratory character
than any other organ of its class which
we can now call to mind. This valu
able quality gives it great power of ex
pression and makes it brilliant at the
same time that it is rich and sweet
The performance of Mr. Wehli on the
piano was astonishing, and created the
greatest enthusiasm among the lovers of
instrumental music in. attendance last
evening. Mr. Bowler, the tenor, was in
excellent voice. He rendered the " Bay

Dreamy Gaze," and the encore, " Let
me Like a Soldier Fall," in a manner
most pleasing to the audience. As a
