The national assembly of the repub

with having S30. The president of the
SYpnch republic is elected for a full

The American Grocer thinks the
business sentiment of the country is
with the president. It says: "This
opinion is now emphasized by the
annual message of Presideut Cleveland
to congress, in which he ignores all
other topics aud mentions this aloue.
The sturdy common sense of President
Cleveland was naver better illustrated.
The writer of this article opposed his
election to the presidency, but we are
free to confess that he has made, thus
far, a good and patriotic president of
the whole people ; that he has been ex-
eptionally level headed on most sub
jects, aud, while we do not agree with
hi in ou all points, if be were again a
candidate for president to-day, we
should feel that the business interests
of the country would be safer iu his
bands than in those of any member of
the opposite party who has thus far
been prominently mentioned."
Congressman Mills, of Texas, says
that if this congress would properly
reduce the tariff it would greatly lm
prove the condition of the country by
next November, and we think he is
right.

Mr. Vanderbilt and bis family have
beeu at Constantinople since Thursday
ot last week on board of bis yacht, the
Alva, and was much disgusted at being
detained some three days in the Dar
danelles owing to bis ignorance of the
Ottoman regulations. The yacht was
flying; the colors of the New York
Yacht Club, which ere taken by the
authorities for the flag of an American
mau-ot-war. A blank cartridge, fol
lowed by ball, which fortunately fell
harmless, caused her to come to. .Nr.
Vauderbiit's telegrams to the American
minister praying for his release were
both numerous and strongly worded.
Ths fault lay iu Mr. Vauderbiit's not
flying the flags used to designate sl.ips
in the American merchant service.
A mistake made by a hunter in
Ozark county .Missouri, resulted in the
death of himselt aud another man
lie took the man lor a deer, fired on
and killed him, and the wounded man
thinking he was intentionally shot fired
on and killed the first man.
Says the New York Herald: "When
lr. Cleveland quietly uggests that
stockings for the poor man's family
and a winter overcoat for the poor
man huuselt are very mucn more im
portant necessaries of lite and should
iie cheapened, Blainegives a convulsive
scream and declares that a fiee "chaw'
is all be :au graut, and bis big heart
almost bui-als at the thought of giving
$tut much"
In another column will be found the
advertisement ot the New York Her
ald. We call to ii the attention of
every man who wants to get the big
gest dollars' worth he ever bought in
his life. The Herald ia now the great
est newspaper ou earth. Its corrcs- !
pondents and agents are found in every I
quarter of the globe, uncivilized as
well as civilized. It stops at no ex- j
pense to procure the earliest and most j
reliable information, and it is so fnr:
removed above ordinary business vic.is-!
itudes that it is absolutely iudepeu- '
dent and fearless upon all topic.

At her home in this citv, December 3,
Mrs. ALICE JAMES, wile of Geo. James,
and daughter of Mr. John Scott.
Mr. and Mrs. James moved to Lexington
in 1882. where she won many dear friendu.
She united with the Baptist church shortly
after she moved, and proved to be a faithful
Christian t the last. Alice had been in poor
health since March, and has been conlined to
her bed most of the time. She bore ber suf
ferings with all patience, she gave her case
up to the blessed Savior's care and trusted to
Him to be her protector. When on Saturday
He saw 1)1 to call ber home to the beautiful
laud of rest, she was couclous to the last;
she called friends to ber bedside aud buds
them all good bye aud isked them 'to inset
her iu heaven. We believe she is uow at rest
ia the Savior's arms, "Asleep in Jesus,
biessed sleep, from which none ever wakes
to weep." She leaves a husband and two
bright little daughters; a mother, father,
brother and three sisters to mouru her lost,
who have the sympathy of the entire com
munity. We will say to them, trust in the
Savior, who led your dear one to the better
land. Be yery tender to those lambs, raise
them up in full faith to meet their mother in j
heaven, and guide her husband to tiie better
land to meet loved ones where parting Is no j
more. They wno stoou ov me ueusme
through ?ll his sufferings and provfd faithful
to the last.
Coine, who in Christ believe,
Our common Savior, praise.
To him, with joylul voice.
Give the glory ol His grace.
