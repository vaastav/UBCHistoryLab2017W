Attornoy-anueiul fiurliuid .Submits
HU
Allium! Iteport.
Ill his annual report, which was made
nubile to-day, Attorney-General Gnrland
makes an earnest appeal to Congress to
provide for the construction of tiovern
ment penitentiaries and reformatories.
Recent laws that have been enacted by
States with respect to the labor of pris
oners provo more conclusively than
ever, ho says, tho absoluto need of such
institutions. '
Ho says provision should at1 onco bo
mado looking to tha erection of at least
ono United States penitentiary nnd, If
possible, ono reformatory. In his repoit
tho Attorney-General sayH 'that' a larco
number of prisoners convicted In tho
United States courts aro th6sp who havo
committed but a slnglu offense, nnd who
havo but commoiiccd a career of crime.
Ho thinks If such prisoucrg wero sent to
a li'formatory instead of a -penitentiary,
whore thov would necessarily lmvu to as
sociate with hm'doncd criminals, thoy
mlglit bu refoimcd If proper inlluouccs
wero thrown around them.
Ho mentions tho fact that Bovoral
States huvosuch icformatoifes. Ho thinks
provisions could by made' for tho em
ployment of the inmates on n system
that would not conilict with, tho recent
act of Congress nor-wlth tho laws passed
by sovurid Slates. '
The Attorney-General recommends a
special appropriation of $1173,000 to pay
fees nnd expenses of doputv marshals
and a readjustment of tho Marshals Fco
bill, which has not bcon tovlsed for
thirty years. Ho also suggests tho re
organization of the official torco of tho
Department nud an lucreaso of tho forco
to correspond with tho iucicased amount
of work iloiiu during tha last four years.
Tho laws, ho says, hnva boon strictly and
impartially executed during tho last
year, the uamo us tho pioccdinjj thrco
years of tbo Administration,
