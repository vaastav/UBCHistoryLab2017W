of resolutions offered and adopted. The

law came up, but before action was taken the
Senate adjourned.
In the House, on the 5th, there was a con
siderable amount of business done. Farns-

date the statute relating to the Post Office
Department. A general dircussion arose

President's message to appropriate commit
tees. Wood objected to the revival of the

Didn't Get Much the Best of Him.
A distinguished ex-Governor of Ohio,
famous for story-telling, relates that on
one occasion, while addressing a tem
perance meeting at Georgetown, D. C,
and depicting the misery caused by in
dulging too frequently in the flowing
bowl, his attention was attracted to the
sobs "of a disconsolate and seedy-looking
individual in the rear part of the room.
On going to the person and interrogat
ing him, he was told the usual tale of
woe; among other sad incidents that
during his career of vice he had buried
three wives. The Governor having
buried a few wives of his own sym
pathized deeply with the inebriate, and
consoled him as much as was in bis
power. Said he: "The Lord has in
deed afflicted you." The mourner sob
bingly replied: "Yes, yes, He has,"
and. pausing a moment and wiping his
nose, continued: "But I don't think
the Lord got much ahead of me, for as
fast as He took one way, I took another."
' lux report of the Boyal Agricultural
Society on Scotch farmine eives the fol
lowing particulars respecting wages of
Kgnvuitunu jauorers in loan country.
Harvesting is done mainly by hand, as
the cost of machine work ezeeeds that
of manual labor. A good hand will un
dertake harvesting, including all the
various operations, at Irom $1.75 to
$2.25 per acre. Hands are generally
hired for the whole harvest, to what
ever length that season may be extend
ed by unseasonable Weather. This tkv.
riod generally occupies five to eight
weeks, although eleven weeks have
sometimes been occupied by it. The
amount of wages paid is generally a
supuiatea sum, ana varies irom $ia to
$20, with food and beer ; lodging being
of no account, the straw mow in the
barn furnishing ample and satisfactory
accommodations. The binding and
other light operations are performed by
women, who receive $14 to $15 for the
whole harvest, with food. Considering
the difference in the cost of the neces
sary articles of living, and. the very eco
nomical and abstemious habits of the
Scotch laborers, the wages here men
tioned are equally as remunerative to
them as the more advanced rates
paid to American laborers in the United
States. .. .- -
A London letter says that at least

Shocks to the System.
The first hock of winter tells tremendously upon
enfeebled systems. Erery one knows that in passing
from a warm region to a cold one, or eico versa, the
body requires, as a protection ag .inst epidemics, an
acclimating medicine. All travelers and voyagers
admit this. It is equally necessary to acclimate the
system in passing the confines of one season and en
tering upon another. Autnmn is gone and winter is
here. Prepare the frame and the constitution to
meet the change by a course of Hostetter's Stomach
Bitters. This inestimable vegetable tonio increases
the stamina! strength of those who take it, and ren
ders them proof to a great extent against the devital
izing power of cold and damp. These two agents are as
prolific of disease, as tropical heat, and animal vigor
such vigor as this healthful and pure tonic diffuses
through the whole organization Is a repellant which
they cannot master. A large proportion of the colds.
catarrhs, and pulmonary complaints which prevai'
in winter, might be avoided, by strengthening and
regulating the system in advance with this invigor
ant and alterative. Not that it is recommended as a
specific for those complaints, but as a preventive of
their causes. On the other hand. It is not only a pre
ventive of, bat a specific for the indigestion, intes
tinal irregularities, malarious fevers, bilious attacks
and nervous aflection, superinduced by a chilly and
damp atmosphere.

anthelmintics will free the system from worms like
these Bitters.

MISS SAWYER'S SALVE
TTEHB yon have a salve combining soothing and
Jl healing properties, -with no dangerous Ingred
ient. A remedy at hand for the many pains and.
aches, -wounds and bruises to which flesh is heir.
Is more easily applied than many other remedies,
never producing a bad effect, but always relieving
Jain, however aevere.
It is prepared by Mite Sawyer, who ha used it
m her own extensive treatment of the sick, tor
nearly twenty years, with great success.
The principal diseases for which this salve is rec
ommended are. Chilblain, lihewmatitm. Pile;
Scrofula, Old Ulcere, Salt Rheum, Sprain; Burn;
Peter Sore; Pelone. Pimple, Erytlpela; Sort
Eyes, Barber1 Itch, Deafnee; BoUe, Ring-worm;
Corn, Bite of Intecte, Cancer; Toothache, Bar
ache, Sere Nipple, Baldne; BxcolUn Breatt;
Itch, Scald Head, Teething, Chapped Band;
Scald, Cut; Bruivtt, Croup, Cracked Up; and
Sore on Children
It never fails to cure Rheumatism if properly
applied. Bub it on well with the hand three times
a day. In several eases H has cured palsied limbs.
For Pile it haa been discovered to be a sure rem
edy. Persons that have been afflicted for years
have been relieved by a few applications. For Ery
sipela it works wonders, allaying the inflammation
and quieting the patient. For Chapped Hand It
producea a cure immediately. Let those with Salt
Rheum obtain this 8al ve, and apply it freely, and
they will find it invaluable. - It Is good in cases of
Scrofula and Tumor; Cancer have been cured
with it. The best Salve ever Invented for Swollen
Breatt and Sore Nipple. No way Injurious, but
sure to afford relief. Sort or Weak Eye Hub it
on the lids gently, ones or twice m day. Cures deaf,
ncss by putting in the ears on a piece of cotton.
For Felon this is superior to anything known.
For Pimple this acts like a charm. For Burn
and Scald, apply the Salve at once and it gives
Immediate relief. For Oid Sore, apply once a
day.
Not among the least of the invaluable properties
of Miss Sawyer's Salve are its beneficial effects
on the hair. Kubbed on the scalp, in five or six
different parts, it promotes the growth of the hair,
prevents it turning gray, and on bald spots it pro
duces a new growth of hair. No lady should be
without this invaluable article as an indispensable
cosmetic for the toilet. It eradicates dandruff and
disease from the head, and blotches and pimples
from the face.
Vfe, the undersigned, have been acquainted with
Miss Sawyer for many years, and believe her to be
a Christian lady and a skilful nurse, and having
used her salve in our families. It gives us great
pleasure In saying it is the best general medicine
we have ever used:

Cherry Pectoral,
For Diseases of the Throat and Liangs,
aaoh aa Oonjghs. Colds, Whoopinc

and Oonmimptlona
Amonjr the great
discoveries of modern
science, few are of
more real -value ' to
mankind than this ef
fectual remedy for all
diseases of the Throat
and Longs. , A vast
trial of its virtueet,
throughout this and
a-atha,. .AnrtMa. T.aa
shown that it -does
Burelv and effectnalTvr
control- them. The testimony of oar best citi
zens, of all classes, establishes the fact, that
Chebrt Pectoral, will and does relieve and
enre the afflicting disorders of the Throat and
Lungs beyond any other medicine. The most
dangerous affections of the Pulmobary Organs
yield to its power; and cases of Consumpa.
tion, cured by this preparation, are public
ly known, so remarkable as hardly to oe be
lieved, were they not proven beyond dispute.
As a remedy It is adequate, on which the publio
may rely for full protection. By curing Coughs,
the forerunners of mora serious disease, it saves
unnumbered lives, and an amount of suffering
not to be computed. It challenges trial, and con
vinces the most sceptical. Every family should
keep it on hand as a protection against the early
and unperceived attack of Pulmonary ATI actions,
which are easily met at first, bnt which become
incurable, and too often fatal, if neglected. Ten
der lungs need this defence; and it is nnwise to
be without it. As a safeguard to children, amid
the distressing diseases which beset the Throat
and Chest of childhood, Cherrt Pectobaz.
is invaluable; for, by its timely use, multi
tudes are rescued from premature graves, and
saved to the lore and affection centred on them.
It acts speedily and surelv against ordinary colds,
securinr sound and health-restoring sleep. No
one will suffer troublesome Influenza and pain
ful Bronchitis, when they know how easily
they can be cured.
Originally the product of long, laborious, and
successful chemical investigation, no cost or toil
is spared in making every Dottle in the utmost
possible perfection. It may . be confidently re
lied upon as possessing all the virtues it has ever
exhibited, and capable of producing cures as
memorable as the greatest it has ever eiTocted. .
