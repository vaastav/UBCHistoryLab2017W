OFFIOIAL PAPIR Op CITY AND OOUNTY
The Chicago Record thinks that if
Chamberlain's idea was to relieve the
queen from ridicule and make himseli
thn butt he has succeeded admirably.
Stromburg, where the British were
so badly defeated last Sunday is more
tl.an 500 miles from Pretoria, the capi
tal of the Boer republic.
It is only two months since the com
mencement of the war in South Africa,
yet in that short space of time the
British have lost in killed, wounded and
prisoner?,^according to their own ad
misBlonSj no lesB than 4,560 men. Presi
dent Kruger is keeping his promise
good and is making Great Britain pay
dearly for the liberties of his people.
... It is now quite apparent that the
battle of Uodder River was anything
but an English victory. The British
soldiers fought bravely and suffered
fearful loss without being able to in
flict but little injury upon their enemy.
The Boers retired a few miles the nigbt
after the battle, but the English did not
follow them. Both armies have prac
tically stood still since the fierce fight,

At the last election Boss Croker went

could anyone have-in asking for green
backs instead of gold certificates if
they desire paper instead of metal
money. The proposed law will require
the government to pay gold for green
backs and then be prevented from
using the greenbacks to pay govern
ment obi igations. And to support
this scheme and make it successful, the
.'V secretary of the treasury is to be spec

more than probable that the American
people will,require an object lesson to

TBRRIBLK EFFECT OP LYUDITE,

Brown Cloudf.
Modder River, Cape Colony, Dec. 11.
•—The naval 4.7-iuch gun agaln^ook
up a position norh of the camp, while
the Howitzer battery was posted
southeast on the left of the Boers.
Both opened a hot fire with Lyddite
shells and shrapnel, to which the
Boers sharply replied with a dozen
guns, thus unmasking their position,
which was the object of the British
maneuver. After an hour's firing the
Boer guns were silenced, the How
itzers searched the trenches, and then
threw shell after shell upon the hills,
the explosion of the lyddite causing
the whole ground over an exenslve
area to rise in the air ip dense, brown
clouds. A Boer long-gun was disman
tled.
It now appears that the Boer? intend
that the jiext fight Is to *afce'*lace
at Magersfontein. Apparently Spyt
fonteiu Is not defended or the Boers
are unwilling to unihask their position
there as the replies to th£ artillery
were all from guns at Magersfontein.

Nearly 000 Men
The nutnber of killed and wounded
cannot be considered excessive in the
circumstances, but the enormous-num
bers. Reported missing suggest tliat the
engagement must not have bepn un
like that of Nicholson's Nek, when Gen
eral White lost so heavily. So far as
known at present nine British offi
cers are wounded and.'nine missing,
two men killed, seventeen wounded
and 596 missing. Presumably all the
missing nieu are prisoners. General
Gatacre does not state whether he has
lost any guns or ammunition, aud fur
ther intelligence on this point will now
anxiously be awaited.
Retreat Covered by Artillery.
Later details regarding the disaster
to General Gatacre's column show
that but for the magnificent wgrk of
the British artillery the disaster
wouldHiave been far more extensive,
as the incessant Boer shell fire In the
midst of the repulsed infantryt ulti
mately led to disorder, which only es
caped developing into a rout through
the batteries of artillery, occupying
successive positions, covering the re
treat, thus drawing a portion of the
Boers' galling fire. Apparently, the
British were set an impossible task
and were treacherously guided. After
a trying march and^being under arms
sixteen hours, they attacked the wrong
part of the Boer position, where the
hill was impregnable, and- the burgh
ers were estimated to number 6,000
men, instead of 2,500, as the spies had
reported.

Schroeler, One of the Oentile^- Delega
tion from Utah*
Washington, Dec. 11.—The consider
ation of the case of Roberts of Utah
was resumed at 10 o'clock in the morn
ing by the house investigating commit
tee, Koherts being present to plead to
certain specific interrogatorieff"-which
Ifad bejpn framed. Thfe proceedings
continued to be behind, closed doors.:
Roberts was first asked if he conceded
:he court record wherein he pleaded
guilty in 1880 under the Edmunds
Tucker law. This he conceded. He
wub next asked whether about 1887 or
since 1890 he had married pluraTfrives
and had lived with them since that
time as wives.
Pleadn Not GnlHy*
To the whole of this charge Roberts
pleaded not guilty, and then demurred
to the jurisdiction of the committee
for the following reasons:
First—On the ground of violation of
constitutional rights, in that It at
tempted to try him for a crime with
out presentment of indictment by gand
jury, and without trial before a jury
and due process of law.
Second—That it was an attempt to
deprive him of vested property that he
held In tbe emoluments of an office for
$e Yull term.-
Third—That the only evidence that
could be rightfully considered* in the
committee-' was a court record estate
lishlng-the 'guilt, confessed or -proven-,
of the representatlve-elect'&ncf that the
committee has no right to consider any
other evidence.'
Fourth—That the crime alleged,
oamely, that of unlawful cohabitation
—even if proved—would* not constitute
a sufficient crime to bar a member or
deprive him of his seat, because inno
cence of polygamy or unlawful co
habitation is nowhere enumerated in
the constitution as a qualification for
the office of member of congress, nor
is it named in any United States law
applicable to* Utah or any other state.
Lefral Controversy Throughout.
Roberts argued these points for
nearly two hours, referring to law
books and answering queries. It was
a legal controversy throughout, the
facts not being gone into at length,
Roberts concluded by asking that his
prima facie.right to a seat be at once
considered, as the present status de
uied to a sovereign state representa
tion In the house at a time when Injur
ious legislation affecting that, state
thight take place.
At the'concluslon of Roberts' state
ment the committee held an executive
session and then adjourned until 2 p.
m. The chairman announced that-sub
sequent meetings would be otyu^and
publicity also be given to the "qjjPcJal
stenographer's reports of the nio£n}fcg
