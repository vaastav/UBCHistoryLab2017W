THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Washington, Dee. i.—Tbe President
in his message to Congress, to-day, says
resistance to the general Government
having exhausted itself, the first .pies
lion was, whether the territory within
the limits of (lie Slates svhich attempted
.secession, should be held as 000*1 tiered
territory under military authority,
•'minuting from the President, but lie
considered that inililary government,
established for an indefinite period,
would have offered no security for the
suppression of discontent, ami would
have divided llie people into vanquish
ers and vanquished, and environed
haired rather than restored affection.
Tlie theory is thai all Ihe pretended acts
of secession were, from beginning, null
und void. Slates cannot commit treason,
nor secure! ho iiidividvalciltzeusvhi) may
have committed treason. Tlie States that
allempled to secede, placed themselves
in a condition where tlieir function*
were suspended, but not destroyed; but
if any state neglects or refuses to perform
ils offices, there is the more need that
general government should maintain its
authority, and us soon as practicable
resume the exercise of all its fuiictioiis
On this principle lie acted, and gradually
an.l .piietly, hy almost imprcciplal.li
steps, sought to restore rightful eiierg*
to (he general government and of slates
To that end, provisional governors lm.

being adopted it would remain for state.*

lie does not advise any present Htt.-iiip

future, friendship between Ihe tw.
countries must rest on the basis of mv
