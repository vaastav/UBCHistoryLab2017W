Vihinftton, Dec 6. (Special
Telegram.) Congressman Mc
Laughlin of the York fXcb.) dis
trict, in reviewing the high lights of
president Harding meisage to con
"There are fniir ouutanilinc nninfa
of the preiident'i meMAge that are of
cjprciai economic vaine at tins time.
"First, the expressed idea that the
best interesti of this republic lie in
me airecuon ot party government
and that the party in power is re
sponsible for the inauguration of a
definite aggressive policy is borne out
by many years of political history in
this country.
"Second, the advocacy of a trait
commission with power to inaugu
rate change of tariff rates at any
time necessity may require is sound
and practical, and such authority
should be given to the tariff com
mission immediately.
"Third, the emphasis of the neces
sity of stabilizing foreign exchange
values Ss timely and the importance
of such action should be apparent io
all. The international conference
for the accomplishment of this pur
pose is of importance to the entire
world. We cannot expect a favor
able price for American products
until exchange rates are satisfactorily
adjusted.
"Fourth, the president's emphasis of
the Importance of co-operative mar
keting is in keeping with the need
and development of our time. All
necessary agencies between producer
and consumer must be dispensed
with, so that the producer may re
ceive more for his products and the
consumer pay less for the finished
article."
Points Out Urgent Needs.
Representative Andrews said:
"The president's message was a
clear, practical presentation of the
public questions requiring immediate
consideration. It withheld rainbow
predictions and promises, while it
pointed out the urgent needs of the
hour. The demand for the reduction
of railroad rates was timely and
forceful and should be heeded by
the Interstate Commerce commis
sion without delay. He voiced the
superior rights of organized society
over any and all individual interests,
or the rights of organized labor or
organized capital. All agencies must
serve the public welfare. This was
one of the strong points of the mes
sage. ,
"The prompt passage of the fund
ing bill relative to the foreign debt
and the permanent tariff received due
emphasis. It served notice on the
senate to proceed with"business with
out delay. The value of the budget
legislation in the last . session is
proved by a reduction of former esti
mates of nearly $500,000,000.
"In concluding,.! the ' president
voiced the earnest prayer of America
for universal peace and international
good will. This-", eoncluding state
ment was eminently fitting:, because
of the presence of the members of
the international conference on the
limitation of armajnepts." "
Message Showed Courage. . ...
Representative Evans said:
' ."The mcssaee was . eomnrelion.
sive. It was decided in its declara
tions and wise in its recommenda
tions.. As to the president's dec
laration as tP labor difficulties it
certainly showed courage to take
hold of a very difficult problem and
present it in a fair way to the legis
lative branch of the government.

admirable and a splendid chart by
which to steer."
Approves Valuation System.
Representative Green of 'Iowa;
ranking member of the ways and
means committee, which formulated
much of the legislation to , which
the resident referred mM.'
. . , '
, i am in entire accord, with what
tne president said with reference to
the American svsfem r( i--,i.,-.t:
as a basis for assessing our tariff
uuues ana tne danger that the gen
eral adoption of this system would
make ous tariffs prohibitive. I have
from the first been opposed to the
system of American valuation, be
Keying it to be impracticable in ad
ministration and that it .inevitably
would make our duties 'so high as to
cause a rise in the price of nearly
every article upon which a tariff
was laid. I think a plan could be
worked out in line with what I
understand to be the thought of the
president, using the foreign costs
as a basjs in the same manner as
now, but authorizing the president,
by proclamation, to apply the Amer
ican valuation plan in certain cases.
"The adoption by the house f
Husband and Wife
Every time, my wife goes out she

G.
the yteni of American valuation in
the tariff bill has been the chief
cau.e of the delay in it final enact
ment. If it U now, in accordance
with what would seem to be the de
lire of the president, to be laid
aside, while it will require extensive
changes in the bill at prepared by
the house, I am satisfied it will
much sooner become a law,
"I was very much pleased that the
'premdent o tringly endorsed a
constitutional amendment prevent'
In ir the further issuance of- tax
exempt securities. J shall press
tinon the immediate consideration
of my committee a bill for that pur
pose and hope to have it reported
out at an early date. With the tup
port ot the president already an
nounced, it ought to be passed at
this session 'and will be unless there
is senate delay, as there has been
in so many other cases. Our tax
system can not be a complete suc
cess until this amendment is
adopted. . Suci an amendment
should in my opinion provide that
the government should not tax state
and municipal securities at a higher
tax than st taxes its own bonds.
Some provision of this nature will
be necessary to protect thc state
issues from unfair discrimination
and thus obtain the consent of the
requisite number of states.'

need for agricultural relief. He

tion and marketing of farm products,
advocating legislative assistance to
co-operative, marketing, Railroad
freight rtes, he added, were aubjects
of just complaint by farmers.

tion over the tax revision law and its
$1,000,000,000 reduction in the tax
draft on the. people,", and urging
economy and ethcicncy, declared tne
budget system the greatest reforma
tion in governmental practices since
the beginning- of the republic."

was stressed by the president in what
some of his hearers regarded as thin
ly veiled dislike over the "bloc de

21 Dead; 25 Hurt
In Collision of
Reading Trains
Fire Breaks Out in Wooden
Cars Immediately After
Crash Several Bodies
Unidentified.
Philadelphia. Dec. 6. Additional
bodies recovered Irom the smoulder
ing debris, and death of two of the
injured last night, increased to 21 the
fatalities as a result of the head-on
collision between Philadelphia and
Reading railway suburban passenger
trains yesterday. Four of the 25 or
more injured are in a critical condi
tion. , It is feared other bodies, are
concealed by the hot ashes and
twisted framework of. the two
wooden coaches which caught fire.
With few exceptions, the recover
ed bodies were burned beyond recog
nition. Most of the victims lived at
Southampton and Newtown.
Most of the victims perished in
fire, which broke out in the wooden
cars almost immediately after the
crash.
Rescuers were obliged to stand
helpless at the top of the cut while
the victims, enmeshed in the wreck
age, shrieked as the flames tortured
them.
An outbound tram from Philadel
phia ran into another from Newtown
in the cut which is 35 feet deep, nar
row and curved. Its sides were cov
ered with snow and ice and it .was
with the greatest difficulty that' '.he
injured were dragged out.
Several of the charred bodies had
not been identified, and it was
thought possible that more might lie
in the wreckage.
A statement from the railway of
fice said the accident "seems to be
due to train .151 (train from Phila
delphia) overrunning its orders." In
vestigations are under way.
The inbound train makes no stops
between Southampton and Hryn
Athyn. The outbound train usua ly
waits on tiding for it to pass. The
engineer is said to have waited 10
minutes and wen a local.-that was
late, pasted, to have asuumed it to
be the other tram, ana proceeded.
The curve with it steep, rocky walls
hid each train, In the middle of the
cut the two locomotives crashed
One rose in the air, and then toppled
backwards, falling, upside down, over
the track. The other locomotive
veered to the east and wedged itself
ir ' -n the rock wall and the
wreckage. ,

a storm gathering in China. .
"The only thjng left for us to do,"

are weak! that, we must reorganize
our army, bring it up to western
standards and prepare to cot our

would get a hearing and that rob
bery and spoliation would be
stopped. I d'ul not expect that the
things we bad signed away by treaty
would be fciven back to us at once,
but I did expect that in the matter
of foreign troops, foreign rolice,
foreign postoflues, foreign bases
obtained under the 21 demands,
which we never recognized, that we
would receive the active help of the
other nations, particularly America,
