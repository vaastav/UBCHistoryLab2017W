GOVERNOR LETCHER'S MESSAGE.
In the recent messsage of Governor Letcher
to the Legislature, in speaking of reunion and
reconstruction, he says: j
j lie union arul reconstruction are but synonyms |
for submission. The man who can a^ent to j
reunion and recostruetion is unworthy to en- j
; joy the blessings of liberty and free principles,
? uud ileserves to suffer the horrors of su^jliga
tion at the hands of our vandal memies.?
They have already proclaimed the purpose to
st.djj as of ali our slave property ; and as far
as this purpose could he accomplished by them
they have removed it. in common with every
other species of property. They have des
troyed our dwellings, devastated our lands and
avowed their purpose to starve us into sub
nation. They have omitted no opportunity
to wreak their vengeance upon unoffending
women and innocent children. Even the im- \
jleaientsof husbandry have been destroyed, '
as one of the means of" accomplishing the star I
vation of our people an 1 their devilish work of!
extinction. When a cha{ lain in the Federal |
army can avow the atrocious sentiment that
it the extinction of slavery requires the ex
tinction of the slaveholder, he was for his ex
tiuc'ion, what can we expect from a people
represented by such a clergy? Any fate would
he preferable to union with them. They are
deaf to all appeals lor j.?s'iee, insensible to all j
die claims wt humanity, indifferent alike to all j
sx-iaK mora! and Christian prlncij I s, and j
recklessly hent upon the extinction of a peo
ple whose blood in munv instance fl >w< in their
own veins. Can we again reunite with them?
Cm we aid in the rec instruction of a Govern
ment which is to be common to us and to
them ? Every consideration of duty to our
God. to ourselves an 1 to our posterity tori ids
Our peace, our happiness, the prosperity
of our country forbid it. As friends and ad
vocates of liberty, independence ari l the priu- j
eiples of free Government, our judgments, !
our feelings?all the nobler impulses of our j
nature?rebel against the idea of reunion and ;
trjjonstructioii. Every flow struck by our!
enemy *ince this cruel war began has only in- j
tendlied the more deeply our hatred towards ?
ihetu and their hatred toward:* us. and has !
widened arid deepene i the gulf between us ami j
diem. We are now separateo, arid the public j
sentiment of Virginia and the States of ihe I
Confederacy is that we shall remain as we are.
If we are to form a union with any people, let ;
t be with s ?me nation of lii^h toned honor and |
elevate I principles.
The in licaiwns admonish us that this war
ujay continue for some lime to coine, and that
wc .-hall be called upon to endure much. It
behooves us, therefore, to be patient, firm and
energetic, seif-saetifi/mg and determined, an J
to omit nothing calculated to aid in securing
succe-*\ The occasion theeau.se, and the hopes
and expectations which success inspires, appejf
to all tr? redouble their exertioi s, their energies
anil effort^. It we determine with fixed and
re>o ute purpo>e to .succeed, and it we move
as one man in everything that is required to
sustain the cause, we cannot fail. A people
Solved to be tree can never die slaves.^ All
*he glorious recollections that adorn the history
ijf nur ancestry, and gave to them, in the eyes
a?d estimation of mankind, dignity and char
actor?all the sufferings which have been in
hered upon our people?al! the bright antici
Pilous which crowd the future, und which
promise peace, prosperity and happiness to li
ana to our posterity, appeal t<> us to be true
and faithful to ourselves and our country.?
The people will be true, a*?d the day of deliv
erance will come. It is useless to attempt to
Conceal the fact that the Northern people are
as thoroughly united and determined as we
are, and it is proper to look the matter sternly
in tlie lace, and make our preparations to meet
it with equal firmness and decision. ISo peo
ple ever lost anything by properly estimating
the power and strength of an adversary. >vc
are thus better prepared to maintain our
rights, and we can do it with greater success
and effect. Many a battle has been lost be
cause the power and number and preparations j
of the enemy were under estimated, it is ai- i
ways wise to look danger fully in the face, and j
meet it calmly, with spirit and decison, energy
anj courage. Prudenci, industry, judgment
and patriotism, will save us and the cau e,
and otabiish independence upon a firm basis. j
Encourage a proper spiiit; inculcate liar- j
tnony, unity and conciliation, and all will oe j
well. V icL*?ry will crown our efforts, and tia j
end will be liberty, independence, and the es- j
tabiishmem of free governn ent, that will in- |
sure happiness to our people and prosperity to
our country.
