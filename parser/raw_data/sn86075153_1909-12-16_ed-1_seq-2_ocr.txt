The Charlotte (N. C.) Observer
has some emphatic and truthful
words to say about the newspaper
reporter and his standards of honor
and veracity. There is probably no
worse maligned man in any profes
sion. The yellow jouirnals, it is true,
have cultivated a disregard for
truth in the work of their reporters
that has won them high favor
among the yellow class of readers,
and that is a pretty large one. But
the average newspaper editor desir
es truth and accuracy above sensa
tional fiction in his newspaper, and
the average reporter furnishes what
his newspaper wants. Mistakes and
errors are inevitable in gathering
news hurriedly and often of neces
sity at second or third hand, but
deliberate misrepresentations and
deceptions are rare with decent
newspapers. The North. Carolina
paper says: "It was discovered long
ago that the best way to keep any
political development secret from
reporters lay along the lines of con
fidential statement: indeed this
method has often been practiced
with unfairness toward some report
er who would otherwise have al
most certainly found out the facts
for himself. Without regard to
political or other alignments report
ers handle public men with great
consideration, suppressing no little
which might be legitimately used.
When an issue of v'eracity arises be
tween any newspaper man and any
public man it is not often that the
judicious are in doubt whom to be
lieve. Yellow journalism constantly
colors and occasionally fakes. but
even yellow journalism has its code.
The newspaper man who does not
keep his word inviolate is almost
like the priest who reveals the se
crets of the confessional-and we
understan- d - that- tno authentic ree-
ord of any such priest exists."

5. A Huge Success
That the series of suppers, enter
tainments and concert given by the
,r Ladies' Altar Society were a success
L1 goes without saying, but hardly the
r most sanguine of the ladies expect
r ed the remarkable results which ac
o crued. It is estimated that after all
. expenses are paid, there will be a
, balance of over $500 left to the cre
r dit of the ladies-certainly almost
s a high water mark in results for af
r fairs of the kind. The ladies wish to
heartily thank the public for its
t generous patronage all during the
_ week.
The large doll which was given
away fell to Dr. Donohue, while
t Chas. Donohue drew one of the
I sewing baskets and Mrs. Healy the
r other.
On Saturday evening, closing the
splendid week, the much anticipat
I ed concert was given at the Court
House. The room was crowded with
i friends it being found necessary to
get additional chairs, etc. Without
exception, the concert was a treat
to all present, every participant
having to respond to encore. Those
who furnished the program, as pre
viously outlined in the Monitor,
were Misses Laue, Hollecker, Pow
derly, Gondolf, Hemmick, Healy
and Mesdames Coats, Gilmore,
Cushing, Wilson and Slattery.

'Muck May Hinge On Conference
The meeting called for next Satur
day at 10 a. m., by H. S. Perham,
chairman of the railroad employees'
department of the American Federa
tion of Labor, announced exclusively
in The Journal of yesterday, will
e bring together in St. Paul delegates
s from nearly every line of railroad
e work, and is considered the most im
portant event of the immediate fu
- ture relative to the switchmen's
I strike. D. A. Harshbarger, third
vice-president of the federation, said
today that while he can not forecast
the action of the meeting, it is called
exclusively to discuss the matter of a
sympathetic strike.
J. M. Gruber, general manager of
the Great Northern road, stated today
that the compromise proposition of the
switchmen, for arbitration under the
Erdman act, with an agreement not
to appeal to the courts, was made by
the railroads when Martin A. Knapp
and Charles P. Neill were here. At
that time, Mr. Gruber said, Mr. Haw
ley stated that he would not entertain
a proposal for arbitration.
The statements that the switchmen
are willing to settle for an advance of
3 cents an hour are unauthoritative,
according to Mr. Harshbarger, who
said that no such understanding had
been reached at headquarters.
Aldermen J. D. Williams and A.
M. Goodrich, of the committee ap
pointed by the council to investigate
the possibilities of the settlement of
the strike, called today on J. M. Gru
ber, general manager of the Great
Northern, and discussed the matter
generally. Alderman Karl De Laittre,
the third member of the committee,
was unable to accompany them. An
appointment was made for a later hour
with George T. Slade, general mana
ger of the Northern Pacific.-Minne
apolis Journal.
WASHINGTON LETTER
When complaint was made about ;
dozen years ago against "the billior
dollar Congress, " Speaker Thomas B
I Reed replied pithily that the Unite(
) States ought to spend this much mone3
because it had become "a billior
dollar country." The United States i.
still a billion dollar country. Since Mr.
Reed's day it has had to meet the
many other duties and responsibilities
requiring enormous expenditures. The
revenues increased with the expendi
tures but it required cool heads in
Congress to prevent extravagance and
waste of public funds.
It is most gratifying to note that
an effort is now being made to organ
ize the fiscal responsibilities of the ex
ecutive and legislative branches of
the government. Members of both
parties in Congress are cooperating to
this end and they have the hearty sup
port of President Taft and Secretary
MacVeagh of the Treasury Depart
ment. The Senate has appointed a Com
mittee on Expenditures, including the
chairman of the separate committees
having charge of appropriation bills,
with a view of binding together the
work of these committees, and of
having it all passed upon together and
in common, thus tending toward mak
ing the appropriation of Congress one
appropriation instead of many. Instead
of each member of the Cabinet sending
to Congress the estimates of his own
department without any common con
sideration of the estimates of the
whole Cabinet, the future practice
will be to have the estimates of all
departments reported to the President
and his Cabinet for consideration
with a view to a relationship to the
expected revenue.
It goes without saying that there is
abundance of room for economy in
national expenditures. Two or three
years may be required to work out a
complete plan. One of the most skill
ed expert accountants in the United
States has begun a comprehensive in
vestigation to enable the executive
and legislative branches to unite in a
plan for the permanent reduction of
the cost of governmental administra
tion. This is a prudent business policy
which is entitled to the endorsement
of men of all political parties. We
are a billion dollar country but even a
rich nation has no business spending
more than its income,.
Persons who are disposed to comn
plain about the high cost of living in
the United States may take some com

can suggest itself to the mind of the Christmas sho

fort in the fact that they could not
improve their condition by transferr
ing their citizenship to some other
nation. A report has just been receiv
ed from the American consul at Nank
ing that the increasing cost of living
in China is a matter of grave concern
to missionaries. He says that every
item of household expense.is included
in the rapid advance in prices. The
increased cost of living in China com
pels foreigners to pay twice as much
rent for their houses and 150 per cent
more for rice than they paid ten years
ago. If this increase continues it is
possible the American Chinese may
be content to remain in the United
States instead of returning to the
land of their forefathers when the
laundry has yielded a competence for
old age.
The Postoffice Department has
joined those who are advocating the
policy of early Christmas shopping.
Persons contemplating the mailing of
Christmas packages, for delivery in
rural communities, have been advised
from Washington to post their pres
ents as early as possible. It has been
suggested that they mark them "Not
to be opened until Christmas day,"
and send them several days in ad
vance.
There is no part of President Taft's
message more gratifying than that in
which he says that no one is seeking
a tariff war or a condition in which
the spirit of retaliation shall be
aroused. It is apparent that the Presi
dent intends to avail himself of the
wide discretion grated to him in

the tariff act and that in construing
the wordt "unduly discriminatory" he
will not be guided by party considera
tions. He expresses the hope and be
lief that no tariff war will be neces
sary. Friendly negotiations will be
entered into for the purpose of secur
ing for the products of the United
States equal treatment in the markets
of the world. A trade war with Cana
da or with any of the great nations of
Europe would be most disastrous to
American commerce, and business
men without regard to party, will
stand back of the President in his de
termination to avoid the necessity of
such display of commercial strength.
