Over the Outcome—Would Not Sell
One of Lite Caroline*.
Paris, Dec,. 10. —The United States
and Spanish peace commissioners con
cluded their work today and finally
settled the teriusof the treaty of peace.
They will meet once more in formal
session, when the Spanish commission
ers sorrowfully and tho Americans,
with feelings of relief, will write their
signatures upon the document which
embodies the result of the war and the
preparation of which has consumed 11
weeks, a longer time than the war
itself. In the meantime tho treaty will
be engrossed under the supervision ol
Mr. Moore and Senor Ojeda. the secre
taries of the respective commissions.
The Spaniards are exceedingly bitter
over the result, though observing the
forms of friendliness and courtesy to
the end. Senor Montero Rios, whoso
strong and persistent struggle to save
for his country every possible asset from
the wreck of her colonial empire, has
commanded the respect and admiration
ot his opponents, went from the council
chamber today to his bed in a state of
complete collapse, as a result of tho
long strain and his chagrin over tho
small fruits of his efforts.
Senor Ojeda has been prostrated since
vesteiday, and was unable to attend
the joint session today.
The Spaniards charge equal blame
noon the European powers and tho
United States for their downfall. Ono
of the Spanish commissioners said:
"The European nations have made a
great mistake in deserting Spain and
leaving her to spoliation bv the brute
foice of a Concienceless giant. They
all know that in the Philippines Amer
ica iias taken more than she can digest.
She will ultimately sell the islands to
England or Germany, and when the
transfer is attempted it will precipitate
general European strife.
"We have refused to sell any island
in the Carolines. We never thouglitof
considering an offer. Nor have we coti
sented to negotiate upon any questions
those directly involved in tho
at Washington."
COfll inentered
the joint conference today in a nervous
frame of mind. They evidently had
reasons to believe that the possibility
existed that even at this late hour there
might lie a rupture. This feeling of
apprehension was based on the temper
the Spaniards have displayed lately.
This week the commissioners of Spain
have not concealed the fart that, hav
ing failed to gain all important points,
they were indifferent as to whether or
not the conference resulted in the set
tlement of peace by the signing of the
treaty by which Spain loses all her col
onies. Miscarriage of the negotiations
would leave political prestige at home
no worse, if not in better condition
than if thev signed the treaty.
The Americans were anxious not .o
give the Spaniards any pretext to break
off the negotiations, or take offense, so
far as tho exercise of patience and
diplomacy could steer clear of protests.
Madrid papers are disposed to revive
the question of the Maine and to excite
public opinion against the United
States on account of the reference made
to this in President MeKinley's mes
sage. They report that Rios made an
impassioned denunciation of McKinley
at the last joint meeting of the commis
sions. Rios did refer to the Maine,
but only in calmly worded sentences,
expressing regret that tho president
had so spoken.
Diplomatic circles in Paris predict as
one of the results of the treaty a diplo
matic contest between France and tho
United States, which will make an im
portant chapter in history. The French
government is reported to have resolved
to take up the case of the French hold
ers of Cuban bonds, and it is believed
France will declaio for repudiation of
the bonds as tile result of tho treaty
which tho victorious nation imposed on
Spain. They argue that the treaty re
sponsibility lias been shifted upon
America, and that therefore the French
government will endeavor to exact
some pledge for payment ot guarantee
of the bonds.
Members of tho commission say tho
treaty contains little outside of the
scope of the Washington protocol, and
matters directly based thereon, like
provisions for evacuation of ceded terri
tory, transfer of public property therein
and guarantees of safety of property
and lights of Spanish citizens remain
ing there. Details of the last cla u s of
questions covered by the statement
which the Americans banded to Rios
at the last meeting were considered to
day, but all the commissioners refuse
to divulge the details of the conference.
Several points upon which they were
unable to agree were left open for
diplomatic negotiations.
Tho Spaniards refused to admit that
they had failed to respect former trea
ties guaranteeing religious freedom in
the Caroline islands, or that there was
necessity for such guarantees.

Washington, Dec. 10. —The urgency
deficiency hill to provide for the sup
port of the military and naval estab
lishments was passed by tho house to
lay. practically without opposition. A
fear had been expressed that the meas
ure might open op a prolonged debate
upon the conduct of the war, but tho
Democratic leaders decided that such a
debate would properly come later upon
the regular appropriation lolls, or upon
the bill for the reorganization of the
army. There was not a word of criti
cism of the war during tho debate.
The only point upon which an issue
was raised today was as to whether the
bill, providing, as it did, for tho pay
ment of the volunteers until .July 1.
lH'J'.t, might not bo construed as a moll
ification of tho law under which tho
volunteers were mustered into set vice.
McKae offered an amendment provid
ing that it should not bo so construed
and upon it theto was a general discus
sion as to the advisatblity of mustering
the volunteers out before the regular
army was increased. Cannon finally
accepted tho Moltae amendment, and
that removed the only shadow of oppo
sition to the bill. A number of amend
ments were adopted upon the recom
mendation of the appropriations com
mittee, which received some supple
mental estimates after the bill was pre
pared. The latgest of these whs an
item of *:1,000,000 for an emergency
fund for the war department, increas
ing the amount carried by the bill to
169,805,81)2.
The conference report upon the bill
to render the securities of consuls, vice
consuls and consular agents liable for

Washington, Dec. 9.—Tho house to
day passed tho anti-ticket scalping bill
by a vote of 111) to 101. This action
is tho culmination of a 10 years'.strug
glo on the part of tho railroads to put
an end to tho business of ticket-scalp
ing. The interstate commerce commis
sion first called attention to the subject
in its report of 18SN, and it has been
before congress ever since in one form
or another. During tho last session
extensive hearings were given both to
representatives of the railroads and the
scalpers, and Sherman, of New York,
secured 174 pledges for tho measure.
It was, however, deemed inadvisable to
bring tho measure forward until the
present session. Tho debate today
lasted four hours, and was spirited upon
both sides. None of the amendments
offered were adopted, and tho bill
passed as reported by tho committee.
No business was transacted by tho
senate today in open session. A few
minutes after the senate convened it
went into executive session and dis
cussed the appointment of senators on
commissions. At 2:15, business in
open session was resumod, tho deaths

YEAR'S WORK IN ALASKA'
Progress Made in Mining Development —Value of the Salmon Indus
try —Agriculture in the Far North —Necessary Legislation —In*
teresting Report of Governor Brady, of Alaska.
One of tho most interesting docu- !
merits recently received at tho inteiior
department in tlie annual report of John
O. Brady, governor of Alaska. The
report is veiy elaborate, in its treatment
of subjects relative to the great North
west territory, covering everything from
mission stations to tho mining indus
tries. Probably more space is devoted
to gold mining than any other subject,
that being the predominating industry
at the present time. Of this, Mr.
Brady says:
"The past year has been one of won
derful progress. During the winter
and spring all sorts of vessels were put
into the Alaska trade, and were tilled
with passengers and cargo to the very
limit. Jiofore long, thousands of tons
of freight could be seen piled upon and
under the snow upon tho summits of
the Alaskan mountains. Tho United
States contributed by far tho largest
Dumber of prospectors, who canto from
all quarters, a large number from every
state in the Union, California, Oregon
and Washington sending tho largest
contingents. These prospectors, as a
class, were line specimens of manhood.
"It is calculated that !J,200 outfitted
for Copper river, several hundred went
;>ver the divide at Yakutat. and sorno
patties went over tho Dalton trail and
worked their way up tho White river,
ane of tho largest branches of the Yu
kon. Conk Inlet, Resurrection bay,
Holovin bay, Kotzobue sound, Koyukuk
river and many other places have all
been Visited by prospectors this season.
Tho declaration of war against Spain
checked tho tide. Host of tho Amer
icans who proceeded to Dawson com
plained of the milling titles and regula
tions, and the manner in which they
were carried out. This had tin* effect
to drive many upon the Alaska side,
and the claims which were abandoned
for tho first onrush to the Klondike
were relocated, and much other valua
ble ground discovered, which will keep
large numbers of men there this winter.
"Theto is no way of ascertaining tho
amount of dust washed out upon tho
Alaska side. Tho amounts given for
the Klondike and its tributaries vary
very much. Several reasons aro given
why tho output is smaller than was
anticipated — the scarcity of supplies,
especially lights, tho high price of
labor, and tho 10 per cent royalty ex
acted. Many claims are being held
with tho expectation that supplies will
be more abundant and not so dear, and
consequently cheaper labor, and that
the loud complaint against tho royalty
will cause tho Ottawa government to
abolish it. There will be no lack of
supplies this winter, but there appears
to bo a determination among the
miners to k-jep up wages, and tho royal
ty is still demanded. Ho we can expect
the product for the coming year to be
much curtailed."
Speaking of quart* mining, ho says:
"Verv rich ore was discovered ip tho
vieinitv of Ketchikan, and many loca
tions have been made and developed,
tjuartz locations have also been made
at various places around tho coast and
upon the islands, as far as Uualaska.
The greater number of these are held
by poor men who aro not ablo to make
developments of any considerable ex
tent. Alaska is a splendid field for a
class of men who can command capital
and who can examine these discoveries
and come to terms with tho owners for
tho purpose of development and sale.
While important discoveries of gold
have been made on Pine creek, flowing
into Lake Atlin, the fields in the vicin
ity of Bald Eagle and Sum Ditnt Chief,
as well as Sheep creek, near Juneau,
have made even better showings in the
past year than previously."
Favorable reports aro made of tho
operations of tho largo American min
ing companies at work in Alaska, their
efforts seeming to bo moro abundantly
rewarded than aro those of foreign cor
porations.
Land I.aw*.
So muoJi of the land laws as rolates
to mineral lands and mining claims,
inasmuch as they are the same as aro
now in force in the United States
proper, have given perfect satisfaction
throughout Alaska, but in the matter
of homestead laws, quite a different
state of affairs exists. The idea that a
man may dig out ore upon lands and
obtain patent for tho same but cannot
build a house and improve land for a
home, nor obtain title to it. is regarded
us highly unjust and imprudent by the
residents of that country. As a matter
of fact, the land office has issued but
one patent under the law ot March 3,
IHUB, for trade and manufacture, and
the amount of land an applicant re
ceives depends not on any law, but
entirely on the will of the land officer.
Even the law which passed last May,
extending tho homestead rights to
Alaska, is found to bo practically val
ueless.
"There are no purveyed lands in
Alaska, nor lias any system of survey
been provided. It is impossible, there
fore, for a poor settlor to acquire a
homestead. If ho were able and will
ing to stand the expense of a survey,
Heaviest Oriental Cnrgn.
The Nippon Yusen Kaisha steamship
Kinsliiu Alaru, which sailed from Yoko
hama for Seattle November 29, is bring
ing the heaviest cargo ever shipped from
the Orient for Seattle. It consists of
3,500 tons of tea, silk and curios. The
heaviest previous cargo was brought on
the Agapanthus, which arrived in De
cember, 189(1, with 2,700 tons. The
Kinshiu is also bringing the marines to
man tho Japanese cruiser Chi:ose, un
der construction in San Francisco.
he would have no assurance that it
would be accepted by the government.
If ho settles as a squatter and makes
improvements, he cannot tell how
future surveys mav affect him. In con
sequence of this condition of affairs,
not a single homesteader has attempted
to make entry under the new law in tho
land office at Sitka."
In tho matter of wagon roads, rail
roads, etc., a different condition exists.
As soon as the right of way bill bad
passed, numbers of filings were made,
and several roads of various character
are now in progress of construction.
At Uima, Berner's bay and Douglass
island there ate railways in operation,
although solely for use in connection
with the mines. The Pacific & Arctic
Bail way & Navigation Company lias
probably made more progress than any
of the other largo companies, having
completed 14 miles of road over almost
impassable country. Moreover, so
much of the road as is completed is
constructed of the best material, by tho
best of workmen, and is in every way
first-class. Money has not been spared,
and as a result the road stands without
a peer. It might be mentioned, in this
connection, that, owing to tho limita
tions of the timber laws, it was found
best to import a great deal of timber,
and nearly all the timber and lumber
used in building Dvea and Skagway,
their railroads and mills, was shipped
from Pugost sound.
Tho governor expresses the hope that
congress, during the short session, w ill
pass upon a code of civil procedure for
the district of Alaska.
Salmon Industry.
Of the salmon industry, a groat ileal
is saiil. There can he no doubt that
tliin industry is one of great importance,
for from figures given it is seen that
the Alaskan output in the last year
marketed at 12.U77.01U. The red
salmon seems to far outnumber all oth
ers, although the pink and silvei
salmon are found in large numbers.
Comparatively few king salmon were
taken last year. To pack these salmon
for shipment, ovor 5,000 laborers are
employed, and, strange to say, the most
of them are Chinese. It has been
found almost impossible to educate the
native Alaskan Indian to American
canning methods, and this, together
with the Tact that Chinose labor is ex
ceedingly cheap, may account, in a
measuro, for the largo number of Chi
nese in the canneries. This salmon
trade during thb past year was of suffi
cient proportions to koep in constant
tiso, during the season, 53 steamers, in
addition to the 712 lighters and small
boats.
In the opinion of the governor,
Alaska should be well supplied with
inspectors, the present force of two be
ing decidedly inadequate.
A gricnlturul l'oMHibilltloß.
Ah an agricultural country, Alaska is
still in its infancy, little being known
of its possibilities. Enough can ho
learned, however, from experiments
inaile in the past year, to satisfy those
interested that such crops as potatoes,
cabbage, beets, peaa and other market
vegetables can, with proper attention
and care, bo raised in parts of the coun
try without difficulty. But grass, be
yond everything else, promises to be
tho agricultural wealth of Alaska.
This is but little appreciated at present.
The native grasses are nutritious, and
grow luxmiantly. Timothy, clover and
other cultivated varieties do well, one
acre of giouud in grass there, for pas
turgage, being worth several acres in a
drier climate. There are many varie
ties of native berries, such aH currants,
huckleberries, etc., but berries from
the States, as a rule, do well under cul
tivation.
"Of stockraising," says tho report,
"but little can bo said. Keindeer will
soon be reaiod in vast herds. In the
near future wo expect to have tho mail
transported by reindeer all over North
ern Alaska during the winter, and at
uiuch less cost than at present."
Tho (iovernor's Kocoimiivixlutlotm.
Before closing tho report, a numbei
of recommendations are made. Among
them is the suggestion that Japonsky
island be built up as a naval station.
Attention is also called to the fact that
at Kadiak, Unga, St. Michaels, Circlo
