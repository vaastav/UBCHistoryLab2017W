ISosurd. of Works Statement.
la yesterday's Palladium appeared the statement of the Board of
Works calling attention to the fact that the competitor of the Muni
cipal Plant was Becking to gain business by declaring that the city plant
would be unable to 'properly take care of its commercial lighting during
the holiday season. The Hoard of Works declares that this statement
of the Municipal Light plant's competitor is false and that the plant will
be able to give its patrons first class service both in regard to quality
and quantity of electric light. Thi3 is a first class example of, he way
in which a trust works. Not fairly and above-board, but in the dark
and by casting untruthful insinuations. It is the way in which a man
like Mr. Witherby lives up to the religion he claims. You remember
ho said last spring, "It is a part of my religion whereever I meet a
municipal light plant to try and destroy it." And that is what' he, or
rather his company, the Light, Heat & Power Co., branch of the elec
tric trust, Is trying to do to our municipal light plant. But in Rich
mond the people have not forgotten the tyranny they had to submit to
when the Light, Heat & Power Co. was in the saddle and there was no
Municipal Light plant to break the high rates. The local branch of the
electric trust goes about now 'cuttfng" rates and loudly proclaiming
the fact as evidence of its good intentions with regard to low rates if
Jt ever succeeds in putting the city plant out of business. But let the
people cease to support the Municipal Light plant and let the Light,
Heat and Power Co., get on top again, and they will find that the
trust's good intentions are just like the good Intentions with which
tho streets of Hell are said to be paved. Stick to your Municipal Light
plant and if you are a consumer of electricity in any form purchase it
from the city's plant. Only a short time ago the trust approached a
local man to get him to change from the city plant to the L. H. & P.
Co. and offered him a special low rate. He agreed to do so if they
would give him a five year contract, but they wouldn't do so. Their
low rates are simply made from year to year with the vain hope that
the Municipal Light plant will be done away with and the good old high
rates oncemore in vogue. In this case a five year contract would be
embarrasins. ....

The Local ISffor-t.
Tho Muncle Star, commenting editorially yesterday morning on the
local effort to raise $100,000 for a Y. M. C. A. says:
"The efforts of the people of Richmond to build a suitable house for
the local branch of the Y. M. C. A. continues, and although at present
many thousand dollars are lacking of the amount required, there is no sign
of a falling down. The spirit animating the citizens of that beautiful city
Is manifested in the case of a young man, 18 years of age, who works for a
living, and who subscribed $30 to the fund, and in order to make good his
pledge has decided to do without a new suit of clothes and an overcoat
this winter. He avers that the old suit and overcoat shall answer his
purpose. ' When such spirit among the young men is shown it is not un
likely that the sum required (IIOO.OCO) will be forthcoming. In this con
nection a few brief words may be appended from Robert Quayle, superin
tendent of motive power and machinery of the C. & N. W. railroad shops of
Chicago: 'My personal observation and personal touch with Young Men's
Christian association work has caused me to know that the Young Men's
Christian Association Is to men what the lighthouse is to the mariner. It
. helps him to guide his small bark more safely. It helps him keep away
from the shoals and rocks of life. It is not only that 'Thou shalt not, but
it constantly appeals to them by lessons, and lessons in practical good liv
ing. In short, it Is a means of displacing evil by development of the
good. The environment of each association Is such as to increase man's
respect for himself and thereby increase his usefulness. And work that
will increase man's self-respect, his usefulness and make him a better man
he at once becomes a better citizen, a better employe, a better busi
ness man and his better influence Is at once useful in helping to increase
the usefulness of others'."

The Wayne County Council, elect

ELECTED BOARD MEMBERS
BEEN SWORN INTO OFFICE AS
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
With the exception of la Perry
township, it appears that none of the
istlng law the members of the advisory
boards elected in November, qualified
as the law prescribes, in fact they
have not yet qualified. This fact
was developed at yesterday's meeting
of the trustees, it being maintained by
most of tho officers that under the ex
isting law th members of the advisory
loard must qualify within ten days
from the date of the election. It was
argued that under this condition of af
fairs, none of the advisory boards
elected in November can be eligible to
the office, and, therefore, the old
boards will continue in service. Un
der tho law all officers in whatever
position, hold until their successors
have been regularly elected and have
qualified and If it is now too late for
the advisory board members to qualify,
then, it is contended, the old boards
will hold sway until the next general
election. It was suggested that to
save trouble and confusion the old
boards might resign, but another stum
bling block was met with here, for
there is no provision for the appoint
ment of their successors and therefore

is appointed, the two remaining mem

filling such vacancies. Attorney-General
Miller will be communicated
with and his decision is awaited with
interest. One of the trustees yester

Peter Merkle the owner of the de
pot restaurants at Richmond, Indian
apolis and Columbus, ran up against
the law yesterday afternoon as he
stepped off the Indianapolis train in the
local station. Mr. Merkle had his

he likely will remember it a long
time, even though it was a joke that
is partly a joke. Yesterday noon Mr.
Merkle was preparing to leave the
Claypool hotel at Indianapolis. He
was talking to a group of friends
when the 'bus driver called him for
his train. Mr. Merkle grabbed what
be presumed was his overcoat and
dashed out of the hotel. Some of
Merkle's friends discovered his error
and they telegraphed to the railroad
boys here to have an officer Intercept
him and claim the overcoat. Patrol
man Mort Little was "let" in" on the
affair, and when Mr. Merkle entered

Washington, Dec. 13. The house
committee on merchant marine failed
to reach an agreement on a ship sub
sidy bill. Four of the Republican mem
bers of the committee expressed them
selves as opposed to reporting any
measure and a caucus of the Republi
can members of the committee will
b held Friday to consider the n atter.
Chairman Gresvenor presented the
Gallinger bill to the committee with
amendments confining government
aid to mercantile and South American
shipping. Opposition of the Republi
cans to the measure developed at
once. Finally the committee, on mo
tion of Representative Watson of In
diana, adjourned without action to
meet again Saturday.
Four of the Republican members,
Fordney (Mich.), Wilson (111.), Bird-
sail (la.) and Hinshaw (Neb.), an
nounced that they would not be bound
by the action of the caucus. Wilson
told the chairman he had no thought
of accepting the caucus -action as bind
ing. Grosvenor replied: "Well, it
doesn't make any difference whether
you attend or not."
"But I'm going to attend. That's
what my constituents -send me here
for," replied Wilson. "I am opposed
to ship subsidy and my constituents
are opposed to it."
At present nine members of the
committee are said to be for oriental
and South American ship subsidy,
while nine are opposed. Only one
Democrat on the committee, McDer-
xnott (N. J.), favors government aid
to shipping.
The house agreed to vote on the
resolution increasing the salaries of
senators and representatives to $7,500,
and making other increases in official
salaries, when the legislative bill is
reported to the house from the com
mittee of the whole. The resolution
also fixes the salaries of the vice pres
ident and speaker at $15,000, and of
cabinet officers at $12,000.
The house authorized an Investiga
tion into the so-called "lumber trust.
A petition for the establishment of
postal savings banks bearing the
names of nearly 20,000 persons in 18
states was presented to congress by
Representative Bouteii oi luinois.
Representative Smith of Texas in
troduced a bill requiring railways to
furnish cars promptly to shippers of
live stock.
The senate confirmed the nomina
tions of William H. Moody of Massa
chusetts, to be associate justice of the
supreme court of the United States;
Charles J. Bonaparte of Maryland, to
be attorney general; Victor H. Met
CLlf of California, to be secretary of
the navy, and Oscar S. Straus of New
York, to be secretary of commerce
and labor.
The senate in executive session rati
fied the general act to the delegates
of the powers represented at the con
ference which met at Algeciras, Spain,
in April last, to draft a treaty concern
ing Moroccan affairs. Opposition by
the Democrats compelled the adoption
of a resolution disclaiming responsi
bility for the participation of the
United States in the program arrang
ed by the conference as to the future
of Mort ceo.
President Roosevelt was directly
charged in the senate with using his
influence for the election of Republi
can Mormon candidates In the receat
election in Idaho and Utah. The
charge was made by Senator Dubois
in the course of a speech in which he
discussed the right of Reed Smoot to
a seat in the senate. Mr. Dubois as
serted the control of the Mormon
church to be complete hierarchy, con
sisting of the presidency and the 12
apostles, of which Mr. Smoot is one.
This control, he maintained,' is eccle
siastical, political and commercial,
and exercised completely over follow
ers, who come principally from for
eign countries. Polygamous relations
are being sustained, Mr. Dubois said,
by the Mormon president, Joseph
Smith, and a majority of the 12 apos
tles. Continually there Is contracting
of new polygamous marriages surrep
titiously arranged by the church in
Canada, Mexico or on the high seas.
Polygamists, he said, occupy the high
est positions, politically and in the
church, and constitute the wealthiest
and most powerful members of the
church organizations. .This is a
change, he asserted, from the old days
when polygamy was entered into in
discriminately. Now the polygamists
are selected by officers of the church.
and in this way is being built up a
cult and aristocracy of polygamists.
But no record of polygamous mar
riages is kept which is available for
the people of the United States. Be
cause of this, he pointed out the futil
ity of passing a national law prohibit
ing the practice. Politically, hesaid.
the Mormon church holds absolute
way in Utah and is extending its con
trol In Wyoming, Idaho and Oregon.
As to Senator Smoot, he said, it
makes no difference whether he is or
is not a poljgamist. The senator is a

ests or tne state or nation. By Demg
an apostle of the church Smoot is a
member of this high conspiracy. He
is one of the chief conspirators, and
by his acquiescence supports the
plans and aims of the conspiracy."
Turning his" attention to the cam
paign preceding the recent election,
Mr. Dubois read the press dispatches
of Oct. 22, which stated that the presi
dent sent Secretary Taft into Idaho
to speak into advocacy of law and or
der. At that time Dubois telegraphed
the president that the only issue in
Idaho was the desire of the Mormon
heirarchy to continue to dominate the
policies of the state, and that the
president was mislead if he thought
there was any other issue. The Re
publican state platform, he said, "was
absolutely siletft regarding law and
order, and notwithstanding the Demo
cratic platform denounced the murder
of Governor Steunenberg and demand
ed the conviction of the guilty party,
none of the Democratic speakers dis
cussed any subject save that of Mor
monism, hence there was no other is
sue in the Idaho campaign. A major
ity of a committee of the senate, after
patient and exhaustive research, re
ported Reed Srcqot is not entitled to
his seat as a senator. It was not a
partisan report. It should not be a
partisan subject. No president, here
tofore, has made it a matter of parti
san politics; President Roosevelt has.
When Governor Gooding of Idaho and
the chairman of the Republican state
committee were engaged in inciting
law breaking and law defying Mor
mons to additional lawlessness, the
president of the United States sent
his secretary of war o Idaho to plead
with the people to stand by Governor
Gooding in order tc maintain law and
order in Idaho."
Mr. Dubois referred to messages of
Presidents Buchanan, Johnson, Grant,
Hayes, Garfield and Arthur, and citing
what he termed the menace of Mor
monism, proceeded: T call attention
to these messages, of presidents for
two purposes, to indicate the views of
our former executives, and to mark
the contrast between them and the
present occupant of the White House.
Mormonism is more insidious, more
dangerous and a greater menace to
government and civilization today
than it was at any particular period
when these messages were addressed
to congress. Yet President Roosevelt
does not deem the subject worthy of
mention in a message filled with sug
gestions. The ljon-Mormon citizenship
of Utah and IdaJio think they are en
titled to the support of law abiding
citizens everywhere in their efforts to
maintain citizenship in these Mormon
states, and if they can not receive that
they have the right to demand that
the president of the United States
shall not use the great power vested
in him In the interest of those law
defying and un-American organiza
tions In their determination to rule
the politics of this section of our
country. In Utah there is a Republl-
Mormon party and a Democratic Mor
mon party, both equally controlled by
the Mormon heirarchy. The American
partyin Utah is composed of Gentiles,
both Republicans and Democrats, who
are battling there under the very
shadow of this tremendous ecclesiast
ical power for American citizenship,
for the separation of church and state,
and against the degradation of wo
manhood and home. It is a noble,
magnificent contest they are making.
They have abandoned all hope of po
litical orerment. and suffer financial
ly in their unequal' struggle for prin
ciple. President Roosevelt throws the
weight of his mighty Influence against
the Americans and for the Republican
Mormons in Utah, led by President
Smith and Senator Smoot, and de
mands in Utah an endorsement of
Smith and Snoot.".

New York, Dtc. 13. A sensational
attempt at suicide was made in a
Sixth street saloon by a man who de
scribed himself as Rankin Duvall, 40,
an actor. Duvall entered the saloon,
and walking up to the lunch counter
picked up a long bladed cheese knife
and turning to the bartender with a
smile asked: "May I use this?" "Cer
tainly," replied the bartender, think
ing he was about to carve some
Cheese for himself. Instead he unbut
toned his coat and vest and pressing
the point of the knife to his abdomen,
threw himself heavily to the floor, so
that the big blade ripped his body.
Before any of the men close by
could wrest the knife from him he had
thrust the weapon twice more into the
frightful wound.
Duvall did not lose consciousness
and when asked why he did such a
thing replied: "Oh, I'm a criminal;
that's all."
Duvall Is said to be the son of a
Baltimore merchant. He recently
played in the "Darling of the Gods,"
in the last act of which he nightly en
acted suicide in ''Japanese fashio.
