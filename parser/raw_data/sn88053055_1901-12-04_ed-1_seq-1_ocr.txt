bers were present: Messrs. Shaw, To
man, FerrUi, Challenger, McGrory,
Morrison, Mahoney, Dalby.
Mr. McGrory reported that bids
had beeq received for the old engine.
Mr. Toman favored keeping the
engine as Chief Engineer Taylor re
ported that she was alright for a
plug service but needed some repairs
Mr. Shaw—Why not put it in re
pair and then after a test sell her.
Mr. Mahoney—She was all right
in her balmy days and would work
again satisfactorily. The committee
was contioucd for a mouth.
Treasurer McGrory reported hav
ing received considerable money from
the tenants during the past month.
He had made arrangements with the
tenants who were to be destrained
for rent. One of the tenants is will
ing to leave the farm at ouce lie
will owe $430 uext March.
A general conversation took place
between the members about the farm
and the disappearance of stock. The
Treasurer was instructed to adver
tise the Model farm for sale and to
sell the farm utensils, etc, which the
tenant sold to (Jm Trustees.
Rills amount!® to $90.47 were or

The contract of-the Water Com
pany was received for 1902. The

The New Castle City Council had
a royal meeting last evening during
which the members waxed warm in
debate. Tile cause was a bill for
$Io for costs of the suit in the recent
case of Lea vs Newcomb ct al.
Mr. Martin—What have wo to do
with that bill?
Mr. Gallagher—Did not the Coun
cil state that tho agent for Lea's had
right to collect wharfage and did
tiny not authorize me to tell the
men not to pay ?
Mr. Martin—Not to the best of my
knowledge. It was a matter be
tween the Leas and the New Jerscy
men. I said nothing about It and
was not consulted. The matter was
simply talked over.
Mr. Reynolds—l was never con
sulted in the matter and aut horized
nothing in connection with the pay
nt or the wharfage.
Mr. Ga'lagher—Had the solicitor
told me that 1 had no right to up
hold the Jerseymcn in the non pay
ment we need not have gone into the
affair. He should have told us that
we had no claim on the wharf,
Mr. Mai tin—What lathe use of
having a solicitor if he cannot advise
us.
Mr. Gallagher—The bill was con
tracted by me acting for the Council
The Jersey men were not to blame.
They failed to pay because they did
not know to whom they should pay
the money due.
• 'resident Schuhardt—It is worth
$10 to us to find out where we stand.
We will know how to do next time.
Mr. Martin—if Council was invol
ved all the members should have
been summoned.
Mr. Gallagher—The bill was paid
by Mr. Thomas Frazer and it should
be paid.
Mr. Reynolds—While 1 no not
like to see any person lose money I
cannot see where Uie.c44r.ints any
thing to do with the case. Was Mr.
Cooper asked to appear in the case?
Mr. Gallagher—Yes sir but lie
did not appear.
Mr. Martin—It was net City Coun
cil business.
On motion of Mr. Gallagher, sec
onded by Mr. Martin, an order for
$10 was passed in favor of Mr. Fra
zer in payment of the bill of coat3.
The wharfage had been paid by the
men.
A communication was received
