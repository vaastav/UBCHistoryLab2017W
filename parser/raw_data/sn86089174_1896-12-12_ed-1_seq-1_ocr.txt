IANNA AT WASHINGTON
He Has Opened Headquarters
There Frorn Reed the
Next Speaker
From Onr Regular Correspondent
Washington Dec 7th 1890
The reign of Mark Hanna b as
openpd in Washington He is
attracting more attention from
Republican Senators aud Rep
resentatives than the opening
of CongresB and the Presidents
message combined and he
seeiuB to be greatly enjoying it
Congress has uo lavois to dis
tribute at this session while
Hanna has been by the bar
rel The republicans who have
been reelected to congress want
< o work Hanna for their friends
and those who will ceaBe to
draw Congressional salaries on
the 3rd of March are anxious
to make connection with other
public salaries at the earliest
possible moment lhereafterand
they racognize the necessity of
getting on good terms with
Hanna in order to do so Han
na has no particular respect or
reverence for anything except
money Ho went through the
pretense of listening to protents
by the local republicans against
the selection of a gold democrat
for chairman of the Inaugura
tion Committee but he never
has any idna of going bark on
the promise he had made to
the clique of millionaire real
estate speculators to Beiect the
man they had nanind for the
Dlace both as a reward for hia
campaign contribution and as a
means of putting a man under
their control in a way to get
into the good graces of McKin
ley and into a local office where
he ran influence the expendi
tun1 of the district of Columbia
funds in a way to benefit their
investments Iff wanted any
thing from Hanna I should
hunt up the millionaire who
had contributed to his commit
tee for a backer instead of
bothering with political in
fienco MarK regards politics
as simply a question of money
and not of principles and 1
make the prediction right now
now that the millionaires of the
country will be fur more in
fluential with the McKinley ad
ministration than the politic
ians
How to do nothing while
pretending to be trying to do
something will be the motto of
tho republican leader during
the present session of Congress
It has been fully decided at
Canton that an extra session
of congress shall b called to
pass a tarilf bill and that noth
ing must be done atthis ses
sion to give thp republican op
ponents of an exlra session of
whom thero are many an ex
cuse for saying there is no
necessity for one Uader the
circntnstances this will not be
a difficult task The regular
appropriation bills can easily
be manipulated bo as to take
up all the time of the short
session
President Clevelands seven
teen thousand word message to
congress is from a literary
point of view n well written
document J is recommenda

of the Cabinet and doubt
less of many of Air Cleve
lands admirers in private life
But it has had about the same
effect upon Congress as a whole
ao the distribution of a batch
of temperance or religions tracts
would have had It has been
received with indifference It is
neither praised nor denounced
to any marked extent although
some features of it may a little
later on the be made the text
for some interesting speeches
Tom Repd is today the most
independent man in the repub
lican parly McKinley heeds
tils support far more than he
needs anything that McKinley
will have to give and nobody
knows it any better than the
big man from Maine who will
be elected Speaker of the next
House without raising a linger
although tho McKinleyites
would give much for some
scheme that would enable them
to down him but they dare not
make an open move in that di
rection
Those enemies of the demo
cratic party who had somehow
mo3t probably because they
wished if cotten the idea that
Senator Hill intended to at
tempt to knock the botton out
of things by making a speech
in the S ° nale in which he would
pay all his poiilical and some
of Ins personal debts by telling
things that ought not to be told
and saying things which were
best left unsaid have been
barking up fhe wrong tree
Senator Hill may think he lias
political wrongs co avenge but
it can be slated upon the very
highest authority that of him
self that he hasnt the slight
est idea of assuming the role of
a public avpnger cn the floor
of the Senate and thafrinstead
of trying to widen the breach
beiween democrats he will en
deavor to the extent of his in
fluence to bring about a better
state of party feeliog
Representative Berry of Ky
who was reelected has this to
say of the election in that state
On a fair and square vote
Kentnckjwould have gone for
Bryan by at least 25000 major
ity But money was used with
out stint and it is one of the
inost potenl factors iiv nioderh
politics There is ahvnjs a pur
chasable element and when
money is as plentiful as it was
in Kentucky this year there is
no trouble in getting mercena
ry recruits But the democrats
elected seven otit of the eleven
Congressmen in spite of tho
corrupt methods of the opposi
tiorij and two years hence the
democratic ticket will sweep
the state

Maneuvers His 1 roops to
Good Advantage
Havana Dec 8 The exact
whereabouts of General Wey
gx are not known but he is
believed to be hunting for1
Maceo in the mountains in the
extreme eastern part of Pinar
delRio while the insurgent
chief has seemingly doubled
on his tracks turned the flank
of the Spanish general and
passed in his rear in the direc
tion of this city crossing the
military line at will and pos
sibly being by this time in the
vicinity of the capital of Cuba
If Maximo Gomez has car
ried out the plan attributed of
passing westward to the sup
port of Maceo a junction of
the two main bodies of the in
surgent forces may be expect
ed shortly
Nothing appeafs to be
knowfi of the strength of the
insurgent force with Antonio
Maceo in this province In
fact it was not until the news
was being passed from person
to person in the streets that
the authorities Voud give a
half admission as to the truth
of the report that Maceo had
crossed the military line This
it is believed will change the
whole campaign and import
ant events may occur within a
soorV time There is no doubt
that the insurgents have re
cently increased in number
about the capital The stray
bands of twenty or thirty ban
dits have now swollen to pro
portions of insurgent forces of
from 20000 to 40000 men
It seems to beadmitted and
believed that Maceo will strike
before Weyler can hurry back
from Pinar del Rio Indeed
it is currently reported that
the captain general has been
wounded in an engagement
with the insurgents beforeL the
