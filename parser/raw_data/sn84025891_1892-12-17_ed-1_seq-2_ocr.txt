PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
A SUMMARY OF ITS MOST IMPORTANT
FEATURES.
Remarkable Growth of the Country la
' Commerce and Manufacture -The Tarlfl
Question Reviewed -Capital and I.nijor -The
Work of the Kxecutive Depart menu.
President Harrison sent his lust annual
message to Congress on Tuesday, in
which he says:
In submitting my annual message to
Congress, I have great satisfacliou in
being able to say that the general condi
tions affecting the commercial and
industrial interests of the United States
are iu the highest degree favorable. A
comparison pf the existing conditions
with those of the most favored period in
the history of the couutry will, 1 believe,
show that so high a degree of prosperity
and so general a diffusion of the com
forts of life were never before enjoyed
by our people. The total wealth of the
country iu 1860 was $16,159,616,068. Iu
1890 it amounted to $62,610,000,000. an
increase of 287 per cent.
The message, after setting forth the
increase in manufactures and growth
of foreign and coastwise trade, take- up
the tariff subject. On this the Presi
dent says:
I believe that the protective system,
which has now for something more than
thirty years continuously prevailed in
our legislation, has been a mighty instru
ment for the development of our national
wealth aud a most powerful agency 'in
protecting the homes of our workingmen
from the invasion of want. I have felt
a most solicitous interest to preserve tc
our working people rates of wages that
would not only give daily bread but
supply a comfortable margin for those
home attractions and family comfort
and enjoyments without which life i
neither hopeful nor sweet. They are
American citizens a part of the great
people for whom our Constitution and
government were framed and instituted
and it can not be a perversion of that
Constitution to so legislate as to preserve
in their homes the comfort, independence,
loyalty and sense of interest in the gov
ernment which are essential to good
citizenship in peace, and which will
bring this stalwart throng, as in 1861, to
the defense of the flag when it is as
sailed. It Is not my purpose to renew here the
argument in favor of a protective tariff.
The result of the recent election must be
accepted as having intro'duced a new
policy. The contention has not
been between schedules, but between
principles, aud it would be offensive to
suggest that the prevailing party will not
carry into legislation the principles advo
cated by it aud the pledges given to the
people. The tariff bills passed by the
House of Representatives at the last ses
sion were, as I suppose even in the
opinion of their promoters inadequate,
and justified only by the fact that the
Senate aud House of Representatives
were not in accord, and that a general
revision could not, therefore be under
taken. I recommend that the whole
subject of tariff revision be left to the in
coming Congress.
On the subject of capital and labor
the message says: The strained and
too often disturbed relations existing be
tween the employees and the employers
in our great manufacturing establish
ments have not been favorable to a calm
tem. The fact that his wages were the
highest paid in like call in cm ;n Mia m.A
and that a maintenance of this rate of
wages, in the absence of protective du
ties upon the product of his labor, was
impossible were obscured by the passion
evoked by these contests. He may now
be able to review the question in the light
of Ins personal experience under the op
eration of a tariff for revenue only. If
that experience shall demonstrate that
present rates of wages are thereby main
tained or increased, either absolutely or
in their purchasing power, and that the
actrrecatfi vnlnmo f uri-ir . u j ;
L tins country is increased, or even main-
wunea, so tnat there are more or as
many day's work in a year at as good or
better wages for the American workman
as has been the case under the protective
system, every one will rejoice.
Our relations with Canada are referred
to, aud the commercial attitude of that
government to the United States is such
that the President recommends a radical
revision of our trade relations with that
couutry, but on an intimate and friendly
basis. The regret is made that iu many
of the controversies, notably those as to
the fisheries on the Atlantic, the sealing
mteiestson the Pacific, aud the canal
tolls, our negotiations with Great Britain
nave continuously been thwarted or re
tarded by unreasonable and unfriendly
objections and protests from Canada.
an report or the Secretary ot the
Treasury on the financial condition of the
government is dwelt upon at length ; the
(3......UC.U.UU ut bIIU aruiy service is
recommended, the work of the various
Departments is complimented, and the
new navy is pointed to with pride.
Concerning the Pension Bureau, the
President says: I believe that the organ,
izatiou is efficient, and that the work
lias been done with fidelity. The pas
sage of what is known as the disability
bill lias, as w as foreseen, very largely in
creased the annual disbursements to the
disabled veterans of the civil war Tln
estimate tor tins fiscal year was $144
956.000, and that amount was approprl
? A deficiency amounting to $10.
o08,621 must be provided for at this ses
sion. The estimate for pensions for the
2?S nearm?lldiS June 30 1894, is $165,
000,000. The Commissioner of Pension.,
believes that, if the present legislation
and methods are maintained and further
additions to the pension laws are not
made, the maximum expenditure foi
pensions will be reached June 30, 1894
and will be at the highest point $188,000,
000 per annum. '

partment is presented, and the subjects

The Answer Not Satisfactory.
The committee representing the loco
motive engineers of the New York Cen
tral Railroad have recieved an unsatis
factory answer from President Depew
to their request that hereafter the road
officials treat with a single committee
representing the engineers instead of
committees representing the lodges. He
answers in polite terms, but avoids the
point at issue. The engineers say thev

EVENTS OF INTEREST IN CON
GRESS AND THE DEPARTMENTS.
Work of Congress.
Congress got finally settled lown tc
work on Monday of this week. The
nnti option bill was brought up in the
Senate, and seems likely to be the
oration of a more determined struggle
than last session. Many petitions, both
for and agaiust the bill, were presented.
.Mr. Hoar, from the Judiciary Commit
tee presented a bill providing penalties
agaiust persons, not a ship's crew, whe
iid or encourage riot on American
hips, which was passed.
Many memorials and bills were pre
sented in the House, which took their
places on the calendar. Mr. Cummings,
of N. Y. , secured the passage of a reso
lution to investigate charges that the
postal authorities exclude newspapers
from the privileges of the mails without
previous notice to publishers, and of
other irregular practices. Several bills
have been introduced upon the currency
question, and that subject will come up
for early action, and will probably be
the most exciting subject of discussion
during the session. A comprehensive
hill to enable national banks to, .increase
t.eir circulation and to suspend further
purchases of silver was introduced by
Representative Andrews of Massachu
setts. Notes.
Silver men have no hope of any fa
vorable legislation at this session of Con
gress. G. M. Lamberton, of Lincoln, Neb.,
lias been selected as Assistant Secretary
of the Treasury, to succeed Sir. Nettle
ton. It is now thought no effort will be
made by the Democrats in Congress to
get New Mexico and Arizona in as States
t lis session.
Colonel John B. Weber, Commissionei
of Immigration at New York, has placed
his resignation at the disposal of the Sec
retary of the Treasury.
The Secretary of War states that a
balance of $3,732 is still due the State of
Pennsylvania for moneys expended by
that State for the use of the United States
n 1864.
A rumor has gained currency in Wash
ington that Mr. Blaine, whose ill health
continues, is making arrangements
to enter the Roman Catholic church,
His friends give no credence to it.
The President has appointed Genio M.
Lambertson. of Nebraska. First Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury. Among other
appointments sent to the Senate are the
following: James W. McDill, Iowa, In
terstate Commerce Commissioner; Per--,ou
C. Cheney, New Hampshire, Minister
to Switzerland; Peter S. Grosscup, Judge
of the northern district of Illinois;
Charles C. Cole, U. S. District Attorney
for the District of Columbia.
The " PubllcJedger" Building Burned.
The massive six-story Public Ledger
building at the southwest corner of

George W. Childs, was nearly ruined by
fire aud water about 6 o'clock Tuesday
evening. The damage bv fire was con-
'hied almost entirely to the composing
room, situated on the top floor, but a
vonencot water poured down througl
nie ouuuing, nooning everv floor in the
structure. The loss will" probablv be
about $250,000. Insurance on building
$160,000; on contents $80,000. There
was no interruption iu the Dublicatiou
of the Public Ledger, as Mr. Childs had
provided for such an emergency by hav
iug a duplicate plant in another build
ing. Iu recognition of the heroism of the
firemen, Mr. Childs sent Mayor Stuart a
check for $5,000 for the Police and Fire
men's Pension Fund, and when the fire
was under control he arranged to have
the police aud firemen provided with
coffee and supper at a neighboring res
taurant. A Rich Salvation Recruit.

Volumes, with a year's subscription to thia
paper, for a trifle more than our regular sub
scription price. Our great offer to subscribers
eclipBes any ever heretofore made. Charles
Dickens was the greatest novelist who erer
lived. No author before or since his timehaa
won the fame that he achieved, andhia works
are even more popular to-day than dnrinz
his lifetime. They abound in wit, humor,
pathos, masterly delineation of character,
vjvHl descriptions of places and incidents,
ttiallin and skillfully wrought plots. Each
book ia intensely interesting. No homesbould
be without a Bet of these great and remark
able 1 workB. Not to have read them is to bo
far behind the age in which we live. Tha
