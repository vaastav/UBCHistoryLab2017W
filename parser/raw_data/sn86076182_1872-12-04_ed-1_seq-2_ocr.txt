THE MIXES OP EASTERN NEVADA.
It has come to this: .That when the
commercial newspapers of the Pacific
Coast speak of the gnat mining interests
of thevneignrrhoodtheyspeak'of What
is doing in Nevada; and it is for 'this rea
son" that we find such interesting
mings up of matters and things pertain

medium of rni""g, agriculture and com

fiodhe foHowingr "The prospects
of the Eureka Mining District which last
year ui i duved about $2,061H'J88',
fly improving. It is feported that the
mass of payors wflently opened ia the
Richmond mine measures not less than
40,000 tons, the gross yield of . which will

reduced to one ton of argentiferous lead.
It is said that the loss in smelting does
not exceed two psr- ceatiM the metal,
whereas in amalgamating, the loss f re-
quenny uses io minj-uu ecu..
The cost of smelting a ton of ore
ranges from $12 to $24, averaging about
$18. An important item in the expense
is the charcoaL of which 30 bushels.
. worth troin 26 Jo 32 centsper buehel, are
required for every ton. The transporta
tion from the mine to the refining works.
and the separation, cost f 70 (gold) per
ton; and the lead sells for $110 or $130
per ton at the refinery; so the total net
yield pert ton of base bullion is About
$280, or $45 per ton of ore. " The district
has 17 furnaces, of which 7 are not run
ning. The idle furnaces are those of the
Rnbv Consolidated, capacity about 20
tons ner dav: Boaaliad, 30 tons; Boil'
whacker, 12 tons; Jackson, two furnaces,
each of 12 tons; and Old Buttercup, two,
each of 12 tons. The active furnaces are
five of the Eureka Consolidated, of 32
tons each; two of Richmond, each 40
tons; one of Buby Consolidated, 45 tons;
one of Phomix. 40 tons, and one of Sil
ver West Consolidated, 50 tons making
370 tons of ore per day, equivalent to
61 tons of basebullion. The Silver West
furnace is idle just at present, but is soon
to commence on 4,000 tons of ore from
the K. K. mine, and will probably soon
have a laree supply of ore lrom its own
mine. The furnaces moke continuous
runs, lasting from 40 to 80 days; and at
the end of each run must be relined, with
a delay of three days, and a cost of $600.
The small furnaces' are unprofitable
and are idle; the large furnaces are ac
tive, and if they had the capacity they
could get 130 tons of ore per day beyond
tne present supply, so tnac me iotsi ore
yield of the district would be 500 tons,
and the bullion-yield $23,600 per day.
The Eureka Consolidated, K. h., Rich
mond, Tip Top, Silver West and. Look
out have large quantities of ore, though
some of them are not yet provided with
the facilities for cheap and rapid extrac
tion. All of them hoist through shafts,
and most of them have not yet gone
down far. The Phornix and Orange are
down 400 feet; the Eureka and Richmond
300, the SUver West 100. The latter mine
is preparing to extract its ore through a
tunnel, which is now in 150 feet and will
be extended 200 feet further, striking the
main vein about the end of February, at
a depth of 210 feet below the present
workings, where about 4,000 tons of ore
are in sight, according to the Superin
tendent's estimates. At 100 feet from
the surface the ore in the main lode is 22
fett wide, and three other parallel veins
on each side have beea found on the sur
face, and so far as examined by shallow
workings, seem to converge toward the
middle or Excelsior lode.
The only considerable lode of milling
ore intbe district' is that of the Lemon
mine, but probably little of it will be re
duced until a tunnel 400 feet long, now
under way, ahatt be completed. A tun
nel 1,400 feet long would strike the lode
1.300 feet below the surface, and as the
ore assays $130 to the ton, and the vein
large and is supposed, to oe uniiorm m
dips and richness, the tatam promrses
much. At present the Lemon mill of
fifteen stamps is encased in working
about twenty tons of ore daily from the
Gaddis and Bertrand mine in Secret Can
yon. This ore avenges aoonr $ao- to tne
ton, and tii ftirn smnlgsmnti i ia roasted
at a cost of $3. per ton in a revolving in
clined iron cylinder lined with fire brick."
