KEEPING FAITH WITH ALASKA
PRESIDENT WILSON and his cabinet are demonstrating that
Alaska is not to be overlooked, even though there are
many serious problems confronting the nation brought!
about by conditions obtaining in foreign lands. The Na
tional platform pledges regarding Alaska are to be redeemed.
A few days ago Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane an
nounced that he would ask for $5,000,000 for next year's pre
liminary construction work on the Alaska government rail
road. This is of course a part of the $35,000,000 pledged by the
government for such railroad construction. Now comes Secre
tary of Commerce W. S. Redfield, asking Congress to vote, hah'
a million dollars for-the protection of ocean going commerce inj
Alaskan waters, nearly half of which amount to be devoted
to a dragwire survey of the channels and a proper charting of the
same, the balance in providing new vessels for the geodetic sur
vey service.
President Wilson, in his message to Congress only two days
ago, reiterated the need of more aids to navigation in Alaska
waters, stating that "the surveys were woefully incomplete and;
that shins and lives had been lost at nearly every point in thread-1
ing th?i courses that were supposed to be well-known channels."
Both President Wilson and Secretary Redfield severely crit
icised the condition of the vessels now in use by the geodetic
survey service, characterizing them as "wholly inadequate and
unfit for service, and so nearly unseaworthy that our own in
spectors would not have allowed private owners to send them to
sea."
FORCING ALASKA DRY.
CONGRESSMAN J. A. FALCONER, of the State of Washing
ton, threatens to introduce a bill in Congress at the pres
ent session providing for prohibition of the liquor business j
:n Alaska. Moreover he also threatens to devote a great deal
' his energy toward securing the passage of the bill..
No doubt Mr. Falconer feels strongly on the subject and is ac
uated by very high motives, but would it not seem more polite
:'cr him to wait until the people of Alaska have had an oppor
anity to express themselves on the subject. Alaska is in no
e responsible for the arid conditions obtaining in the State
ashington and is not particularly interested in it. But sup
osing our Delegate to Congress had the right of initiating a
measure laying restrictions on the people of the State of Wash
ington, and should proceed to do so, would not the people of the
State, including Congressman Falconer find just ground for the
criticism of the act?
While the people of Alaska are barred from passing any
laws affecting the liquor traffic, they have a means of bring
ing the desire for such legislation before Congress through their
legislative bodies. Moreover, many of the population now in
Alaska, have a distinct recollection of the conditions that ob
tained in Alaska during the reign of National prohibition in the
Territory. And the conditions as existing at that time were not
ideal in any respect.
THE PETERSBURG WEEKLY REPORT
VOLUME one, number one, of the Petersburg Weekly Report,
made its debut on December 5. It is one of the brightest
and newsiest papers published in Alaska and deserves to
succeed. The editor and publisher, Lynn W. Miller, is a news- ,
paper man of abundant experience, besides having an intimate .
knowledge of Alaska, her resources and her people. The people i
of Petersburg are to be congratulated in that Mr. Miller decided to:
cast hie lot with them. In his foreword which is appended, the ;
publisher gives his reason for choosing Petersburg as his field. 1
Mr. Miller says:
"It is a time-honored custom in establishing a news
paper for the publisher in his initial issue to give rea
sons?oft'times more or less apologetic?for his selec
tion of the particular community in which he launches
his journalistic enterprise. This is usually followed by i
a declaration of the paper's policy in matters political
and of general interest. The Report is able to meet the j (
first clause of this custom requirement with brevity? i
and without apology.
The publisher believes Petersburg offers the best
field for a weekly newspaper of any place in Alaska,
or, in fact in the entire Northwest country. We found
it to be the only town in the Northwest of equal popu- t
lation, or of half of its commercial importance, unpro- J
vided with a news medium. Upon closer inquiry, we as
certained the sense of the business men and citizens v
generally to be that Petersburg wants a newspaper. c
These favorable conditions, together with the fact ! '
that the town has the resources and natural advantages 5i
which insure its steady and substantial growth, are the a
"reasons" for the Petersburg Weekly Report.
"The first purpose of this paper will be to chroni- c
cle the news of Petersburg and vicinity, and its policy ! ti
to advocate every matter and enterprise advanced tend- ?
ing toward the development of Petersburg and this im
mediate section of Alaska.
"Politically: While the editor is a Republican, in
view of the total lack of evidence showing the existence $
of that party as an organization in Alaska during the ?
recent campangn, it would approach the Quixotic to
announce the paper's intention to support anything so a
intangible. The Report will, therefore, be non-parti- bl
san, and will endeavor to give fair and full credit to as- Z
pirants for and incumbents of local and territoral offic- b
ial position, regardless of their political leanings.
"In conclusion, we wish to earnestly solicit the co
operation of the citizens of Petersburg in our efforts to r<
make of the Report a newspaper creditable to a town, ?
which in the near future should be classed among the
largest and most important cities in Alaska."
REPORTSjRICH STRIKE
IN THE KUSKOKWIM
SEWARD, Nov. 30.?Dr. Green of
Tacotnn, in a letter to Frank Cotter,
report# tho discovery of a groat pay
streak on Candle Crook, a tributary
of the Talaiona which flows Into tho
Tacotna. He says that Aitkcn and
Tom. VcKlnnon, tho owners of the
property had a Keystono drill work
ing on tho ground all last winter and
last summer. Thoy also had a crew
of 22 men working in an opon cut
at the timber line where tho ground is
i only 5 to 7 feet deep.
Writing of tho ground, tho doctor
! says: "The paystreak here is 150
j foot wldo and gets Wider aa it good
down stream, being 430 foot whore
| they quit drilling. Tho drill holes
! show an average of 37 to tho square
| foot of bedrock along the left bank
: of the paystreak. , Thirty feet from
this vein it averages 36 and from that
place to the extremo right limit of
| the paystreak It gradually tapers off
to fifty cents to the square foot of
bedrock."
ANOTHER MURDER
IN BRISTOL BAY
VALDEZ, Nov. 27.?On October 13,
Sakar Judas shot and killed a native
named Wassella about 15 miles above
Naknek. and shot and wounded Ban
ley Kovlv, also a native, at the same
time Tho natives had been drinking
natlvo beer and wero all. more or less
intoxicated.
It seems Wassella had been abus
ing the mother of Judas, a boy 12
years of age, and ho secured a gun
and shot Wassolla through tho fore
head, Just botwoon tho oyes, killing
hlin instantly. Kovlk heard the shot
and was coming to the fish houso,
whero tho shooting occurred, to find
out what was tho matter, when Judas
fired a shot at him, wounding him In
the chin. The last shot was made
because the boy was frightened and
not because Kovlk or Judas bad had
any trouble. Judas has been bound
over to tho district oourt charged
with murder.
MASTODON SKULL TO
QO TO EXPOSITION
SEATTLE, Doc. 5.?A gigantic mas
todon skull, dug from the frozen
ground 110 foot bolow the surface, has
been brought to Seattle by CapL S.
C. Barrlngton, president of the Side
stream Navigation Co. of Dawson.
The skull and two enormous tusks
were dug out of a mine shaft within
30 miles of Dawson by George Nunan,
a miner. ,
Tho ground was frozon from the
surface down, and tho miners thawod
it out with a wood fire as they dug.
They broko off a ploco of the skull
before they realized what they were
finding. When tho hard point of ono
of the tusks appeared thoy dug with
extreme care and finally unearthed I
two tusks about seven feet loug, a
sths:!!. r. numLer of teeth and a huge
.oj. Lone.
The tusks weigh each more than 150
pounds, and a single tooth weighs 20
pounds. The remains are brown from
being burled thousands of years in
tho frozen ground, but are well pro
served. The teeth are ridgod, and the
crowns are as wide as a 3tove lid.
H. Crowhurat, 2109 2nd avenue N.,
has the interesting curios at his home.
He will send thom to Son Francisco
for exhibition In the Panama-Pacific
Exposition.
"The country where these relics i
were obtained is rich in mastodon re- I
mains," said Prof. Trevor Kincald,
head of tho University of Washington !
department of biology, today.
"In Siberia there have boon found '
skeletons with large parts of frozen
flesh still adhering to them. The fro- .
zen condition of the ground preserves
them iii good condition." I
