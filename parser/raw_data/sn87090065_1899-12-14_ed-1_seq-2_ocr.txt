Official Paper of Lincoln County
To-day is the cc.ntenial anniver
snrv of Washington's death, and
lias been declared a legal holiday
in this territory.
The Goebt 1 people in Kentucky
liavo quit and Taylor will don the
gubernatorial toga without further
opposition.
Roberts of Utah, who was re
ceutly nfcked by an inqusitive how
many wives ho had: Replied,
"Enough that 1 do not have to run
after other men's wives.''
Texas is to have an extra session
of the legislature to consider a tax
ation scheme, which if adopted, it
is said, will revolutionize the tax
system of the whole state.
There is no half way business in
McKinley's money policy, gol
standard, and no compromise this
time, without the consent of any
thing on earth too, except it b
Ilnnna.
It bocine to look like the 120
lawyers of El Paso will have nn in
crease in practice if they do not
pay an occupation tax, There wil
bo no lack of counsel for the de
fendants.
The test of White Oaks coal, in
the El Paso market, has met the
requirements against everything
ltecent investigation has proven
that there is plenty of it hero too
The great quantity and t he superi
or quality insures a rail road in
the near future. The Old Abe coa
property has already passed the
prospective stage and is now
ii . i
mine ot excellent coal with a vein
of 4 J feet of clean coal without a
pound of waste of any character
With a rail road the coal industry
alone, without the gold, iron, mar
bio, building stone &c , would
make White Oaks a city.

WONDERFUL LEADV1LLE.
After twenty years of incessant
and immense production Leadville
is at this moment yielding more,
both in quantity and value, than
rr. . I 1 1 i
ever. Twenty-seven nunureu ions
day is the average output. It
consists of silver, gold, lead, man
ganese, iron, copper and zinc.
This great tonnage is a large
part of the traffic of three moun
tain railroad systems. It strength
ens and invigorates business, in a
thousand ways, from the center to
the borders of the state. Leadville
is actively producing much more
j i , ,
wealth now than in the days of its
famous boom, which were called
bonanza days.
It takes an effort of the imagina
tion to throw the mind back tweu-
rv vears and occUDV the point of
j j
view as to Leadville's future then
held by the wisest of men. All the
theories of the experts have been
upset. Indeed the more a man
knew about mining previous to the
carbonate discoveries the less he
made out of the wonderful find. It
was something new under the 6un.
During a score of years since it has
been a geological law unto itself
and is as much of a mystery and as
much of a surprise as ever. As fast
as new theories are formulated
from the actual workings further
developments knock them out and
disclose the unexpected. Even
after twenty years the man who
knows the most about the forma
tion under the wondrous camp may
sometimes mislead himself and
others. The only thing that seems
to be certainly established is that
however rich a given locality may
ho there is somethinif better not
far beyond.
Twenty years ago shrewd men in
Denver who had bought real estate
in the pnrincr on the miniriif ex-
x O
citement were selling it in the fall
in the belief that the cream of the
Leadville blanket veins of carbon
ates had been worked out during
the summer. All the old miners
said that the blanket or horizontal
deposits could not last. Nothing
but true fissure veins could keep a
mining camp going more than one
season.
In view of the amazing product
of Cripple Creek, where true fis
sures are also absent, and the un
preceden ted output at Leadville,
nnd of the fact that Centrals old
mines ot twenty years ago are
young now at the age of forty,
are we not justiüed in dwelling
with emphasis upon the permanent
nature of precious metal rainiug in
Colorado? Denver Republican.

HELLO ROSWELLI
What do you think of a proposi
tion for a telephone from Hoswell
to White Oaks via Picacho, Lin

It would be a great convenience
to stockmen and everybody elfe,
along the line, as a means of quick
coinn.uniealiun. Itisoften that

The important events of the
week in Congress have been the
reading of the annual message of
the President, and the action of
the House upon the credentials of
Koberts, the polygamic from Utah
The general comments heard up
on the executive communication
are anything but flattering to its
author. It is enormously long, con
taining more words than any pre
vious annual message to Congress.
But its language is dubius, lacking
in force; and upon the important
issues of the day, it falls far short
ot expectations. It leaves the Phil
ippine question in the air; and it
is apparent now that the President
will not venture to put himself
squarely on record, officially, in re
gard to this matter, prior to the
national elections. His utterances
to Congress are remarkably ehort
of his speeches in the west, on his
famous around-the-circle trip be
fore the Ulno election, lie now
ventures nothing upon the impe
rialistic issue, beyond a statement,
which no ono disputes or has de
nied, that the insurrection must be
ended, and that obligations incur
red in the war witu. bnain tor es
tablishing order in the territory
acquired by this country, must be
fulfilled. But upon the important
question as to how this government
shall govern the Asiatic posses
sions, what measure of liberty shall
bo given to the Filipinos, the Pres
ident is silent. His evasion of the
issue is taken generally to mean
that he is doubtful now himself
about the American people's en
dorsement of the policy to hold
permanently all the Philippines
and to govern them by a colonial
system similar to that of Great
Britain.
The financial suggestions of Mr.
McKinleyhave chilled the wes'ern
Republicans, who cherished the
hope that he woulJ, nominally
at least, adhere to the Republican
platform of 18 upon which he
was elected, favoring larger use of
silver, to bo brought about by in
ternational agreement, Intelligent
men have understood fully that
this declaration was put in merely
to propitiate certain sections like
Indiana and Illinois where silver
coinage is strong, even with Re
publicans. Now, however, the
President comes out squarely for
the establishing more firmly of the
single goltl standard, the increase
of national bankers privileges, and
authority for the Secretary of the
Treasury to sell United States
bonds on long or short timo. As
the present Secretary exercises his
discretion to buy bonds and turn
cash into Wall street whenever the
speculators are short of nroney, this
new proposition implies more flex
ible arrnngement by which the
Treasury will lend itself to the ad
justment of ratos to stock specu
lators ot tboir behest, or as the whim
may strike him, and both soil and
buy bonds for the purpose.
The trust que-tion is treated
with little short of misstatement of
law nnd facts. The day prior to the
reading of this message the United
States Supreme Court, in
portant case of tho Addyston Pipo
Co., decided that this trust was in
violation of Federal statutes. There
is no longer doubt that existing
law is sufficient to reach the trusts.
It is for the Attorney General of
the Unitod States, an official of Mc
Kinley's administration, to prose
cute the otTontlers, lint Attorney
Cenerul Griggs comes from New
state of all the trusts opiratn g
in the country, and his thoughts
and convictions are imbued natur-l
ally with prejudices in favor of the
great capitalistic concerns. Griggs
can not see means for prosecuting
these combinations under the so
called Sherman act, although the
Supremo Court can convict when
cases are brought before it. The
easiest escape from such a situa
tion is to ask for more legislation,
and this is the course of the Presi
dent. With laws enough to cover
the principal offenders, the trust-
fed administration asks Congress
to furnish more; pud then it im
plies these matters will receive con
sideration. When the next Repub
lican convention meets, it will no
loubt denounce vigorously, in gen
eral terms, trusts and combina
tions for the purpose of stifling
. . mi t ..v 1 :
comr-eution. J. no nepuoiieana
have lost none of their characteris
tic effrontery, as is shown very well
in the latest message, of their chief
representative.
No suggestion is made for less
ening tho burdens of the standing
army, but on the contrary, between
the lines can be rea! the purpose
to establish it permanently. If the
President actually believes the in
surrection in the Philippines is
practically ended, why is no hope
extended that soon the army can be
reduced, and a portion at least of
the present burden of 120,000,001)
for this army canfbe taken otf the
shoulders of. the tax payers?
In the House the message was
listened to impatiently. The thou
sands, who filled the galleries were
there to witness the proceedings in
the Roberts case. They were bored
by the lng, tedious message.
Without party division, the
IIouso voted not to admit Roberts
on his unquestionably perfect cer
tificate of election as a representa
tive. Tho omments heard from ihe
leaders on both sides indicate very
clearly that they wero not at al
satislied with their votes upon tin
question. They recognize, unaniin
ously, that n most dangerous pre
cedent has been established in re
(using to admit any man present
ing regular credentials, a precedent
that may be invokol hereafter to
great injury of a state, hy unscru
