A Ride for Life.
Yesterdav there occurred on ihe Oro.
gon & California Railroad, between this
cit v and Salem, one of the most thrilling
ranman incidents wo ever Heart! or. vt lien
the down train came near one of the sta
tions on the road it was going at full
speed, in order to make up time, as it was
a few minutes behind. The road at this
point runs through a cut something more
than a mile in length, nnd in entering it
tneroau maKes a curve so that the engi
neer cannot see entirely through it. So.
as he thundered along yesterday, he little
thought what stirring" times were upon
niiii. iiu null nanny gotten into the cut
before ho saw a wo'man riding leisurely
through it, and with perfect nonchalance
using the center of the track. She was
not more than half way through tho cut,
and barely a quarter of a mile ahead of
him. He immediately whistled "down
breaks," and sounded the warning.
The woman, hearing the peculiar death
whistle of the locomotive, looked over her
shoulder and saw the train rushing at her.
She did not shriek, nor faint, nor give up
all hope, but, like a true Webfoot, her
courage rose cquafto the emergency, and
without a moment's hesitat ion, she com
menced swinging her riding whip from
one shoulder of her steed to the other,
thereby urging him to exert Ids utmost
speed. The whip, and, perhaps, the
shrieking of the steam-whistle, caused the
animal ridden by tUe lady to put in its
best licks, and he made about as rapid
time as any animal ever seen in Oregon ;
but each instant the iron horse gained upon
the one composed of rlesh and muscle.
The shrieking of the locomotive's
whistle caused the passengers to lookout
of Ihe windows, and upon their discover
ing what was tho matter the wildest ex
citement ensued. Several jumped for
ward and seized the bell rope, and com
menced pulling on it as if they could stop
the train by that means. The brake men
were tfxerting all their strength on the
brakes, and the engineer had cut oil' the
connection, and was doing all that he
knew to stop tho train, while tho woman
was doing her level best to make that bit
of horsc-tlcsh rise to the speed of a
" Helmbold ;" but, all in vain ; tho loco
motive kept gaining on the horse and its
rider, and there was hardly a person on
the train who did not expect that both the
woman and horse would be killed.
There was perhaps thirty feet interven
ing between the cowcatcher and the
horse's heels, when, fortunately for the
woman, she observed a place which was
a little wider than usual, nud, with a
steady rein, she guided the lleeing horse
from the track and endeavored to press
him against the wall of tho cut in order
that the train might pass by without
injury. In doing this the woman was en
couraged by Mr. Sam Winans, the con
ductor, who had run forward and got out
on the locomotive. A few seconds only
oasseu oy wuen me nery monster poked
liis nose past the rump of the horse. At
this moment Mr. Winans threw his whole
forco against the animal, and held him
until Ihe train stopped, and then a rous
ing cheer of gratification and joy at tho
escape of the woman from a terrible death

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
WASHINGTON, December 4, 1871.
The following la the President's' Message,
this day delivered to t'ongrcna:
To Iht tonatt ami Ilnumnf KmrtttnlaHrft :
In nddrraslng my third animal nicMarrrtd
the lawmnklnir branch of tho Government,
It is (frntlfylng to bo nliln to atnto that tlttr-
ing inc past year ailerons has generally at
tended tho effort to exeente nil the laws
found Upon tho stntnto-hnolta. Tho nnll,-
hna tieen not to Inquire Into the wisdom of
laws already enacted, Imt to learn their spo
clal Intent, and to enforce them atcordimrly.
The past year has, nnder a wise Provl
doncc, hern one of general prosperity to the
nation. It h, however, been attended
with more than tho usual chastisements In
losa of Hfo and property by atorm and Are.
These disasters linvc served to call forth the
host elements of human nature. In our coun
try, and to develop a friendship for ns on
the part of foreign nations, which goea far
toward alleviating the distress occasioned
hy the calamities. Tho benevolent,, who
have ao (rcnurounly shared their means with
the victims of these misfortunes, will reap
their reward In the consciousness of having
performed a nolilc net, receiving the grate
ful thanks of tho men, women and children
whose sutrcrimrs they have relieved.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
The relations of tho L'nltcd States with
foreign powers continue to bo friendly. The
year has hnen an eventful one in witnessing
two Rreat nations, spcaklni; one language,
and having one lineaife, lettlinif, by peace
ful arbitration, disputes of long standing,
and liable at any time to brinif those nations
Into bloody and hostile conflict. An example
has thus been set, which, if successful In Its
linal isane, may he followed by other civil
ized nations, and be the final means
of returning to productive Indus
try millions of men maintained to
settlo the dispntes of nations by
the bayonet and broadsword. I transmit
herewith copy of the treaty alluded to,
which has been concluded since the adjourn
ment of Contrreas with Her Britannic Majes
ty, nnd a copy of the protocols on the con
ferences of the Commissioners hy whom it
was negotiated. This treaty provides
iiieiiniu. lor nuju.iung uic nticsiions pending
between the two nations. Various questions
are to be adjusted by arbitration. I recom
mend Congress nt nn early day to make the
necessary provision for the tribunal at
Geneva, and for the several Commissions on
thepartof the United States, called for hy
the treaty. Ills Majesty, the King of Italy,
the President of the Swiss Confederation,
and His Majesty, the Emperor ofllrar.il, have
each consented, on the Joint request of the
two Powers, to name an arbitrator
for the tribunal at Geneva. I have
caused my thanks to be. suitably ex
pressed for the readiness with which
the joint request has been complied with by
the appointment of gentlemen of eminence
and learning to these Importnnt positions.
His Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, has
been pleased to comply with the joint request
ot the two Governments, nnd has consented
to act as the arbitrator of thedispntcd water
boundary between tho United States and I
Urcat Britain. The contracting parties in
the treaty have nndurtaken to resrurd as be
tween themselves certain principles of pub
lic low for which the United States have eon
tended from tho commencement of their his
tory. They have also agreed to bring these
principles to the knowledge of the other
maritime powers, and to Invite them to ac
cede to them. Negotiations are goins on as
to the form of the note by which the invita
tion is to he extended to the Powers. I rec
ommend the legislation necessary on the part
of the Unitod States to brim: into operation
the articles of the treaty relating to the fish
eries, and to the other matters touching the
relations of the United States toward the
British North American possessions, to be
come operative as soon as the proper legisla
tion shall be had on the part of Great Britain
and its possessions. It Is much to be desired
that this legislation ma v become operative
before the tlshermcn of "the United States bc
Cin to make their arrangements for the com
ing season.
I have addressed a communication, of
whioh a copy is transmitted herewith, to the
Governors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin,
urging upon the governments of those States,
respectively, the necessary action on their
part, to carry into effect the object of the ar
ticle of the treaty which contemplates the
use of the canals on cither side, connected
with the navigation of the lakes and rivers
forming tho boundary, in terms of equity, by
the inhabitants of both countries. It is hoped
that the importance of the object, and the
benefits to flow therefrom, will secure the
speedy approval nnd legislative sanction of
the States concerned.
I renew the recommendation for an appro
priation for determining ttietnjo position nt
the 4!)th parallel of latitude, where it forms
the boundary between the United States and
the British North American possessions be
tween the Lake of the Woods and the sum
mit of the lioeky Mountains. The early ac
tion of Congress in the recommendation
named would put it in the power of the Wur
Department to place a force in the Held dur
ing the next sinnmer.
The resumption of diplomatic relations be
tween France and Germany has enabled me
to give directious for the withdrawal of tho
protection extended to the Germans in France
by the diplomatic nnd consular representa
tives of the United States in that eountrv. It
Is just to add that the delicate duty of 'this
protection has been performed by the Minis
ter and the Consul at Paris and the various
Consuls in France, under tho supervision of
the latter, with great kindness us well as
with prudence and tact. Their course has
received the commendation of the German
Government, and has wounded no suscepti
bility of the French.
Tho Government of tho Emperor of Ger
many continues to manifest a friendly feeling
toward the United States, and a desire to har
monize with the moderate and Just policy
which this Government maintains in Us rela
tions with Asiatic Powers, as well us with
the South American Republics. I have triven
assurance that the friendly feclines of that
Government arc fully shared by the United
States. The ratifications of the consular ami
naturalization connections with thcAustro
!iunj:arian Empire have been exchanged.
I have been officially informed of tho annex
ation of the States of the Church to the King
dom of Italy, and the removal of theCanital
of that Kingdom to Rome. In conformity '
with the CHtalillMheii nolirv nt tin, Kiilti.H '
States, I have recognized this change. The
ratification of the new treaty of commerce
between the United States and Italy has been
exchanged, and the two Powers have agreed
in their treaty that property at sea shall be
exempt from capture in case of war between
the two Powers.
Tho United States have spared no oppor
tunity of iiicorwrating this rule into the ob
ligations of nations. The Forty-Urst Con
gress, at its third session, made un appro
priation fur the organization of a mixed
commission of adjudication upon the claims
of the citizens of the United States against
Spain, growing out of the insurrection in
Cuba. That Commission has since been or
ganized. I transmit herewith the corres
pondence relating to Us formation and its
jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that this
Commission will afford tho claimants a com
plete remedy for their Injuries.
It has been made the agreeable duty of the
United States to preside over a conference
at Washington, between tho pleninotcntia
ries of Spain and tho allied South American
Republics, which has resulted in an armistice,
with the reasonable assurance of a perma
nent peace.
The intimate and friendly relations which
have so long existed between the United
States and Russia continue undisturbed.
Tho visit of Ihe third son of the Russian
Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on
the Part of his Government to diminish tho
cordiality of those relations. The hospi
table reception which has been given to tho
Grand Duke is proof that on our side we
share the wishes of that Government.
The inexcusable course of the Russian
Minister ut Washington rendered it neces
sary to ask for his recall, and to decline to
longer receive that functionary as a diplo
matic representative. It was incompatible
with self respect, or with a just regard to
the dignity of the country, to permit M. Cut
acazy to hold Interviews with this Govern
ment after his abuse of Government otllciuU
and during his persistent Interference,
through various means, with the relations be
tween tho United States and other Powers.
In accordance with my wishes, our Govern
ment has been relieved of lurther intercourse
w ith Mr. Catacuzy, and the management of
the ullaiis of the Imperial nation has pumtd
into the hands of a getilleuiau entirely ui ju
jcctionable. With Japan we continue to maintain Inti
mate relutions. The Cabinet of the Mikado
bus, since the clone of the lust session of
Congress, selected citizens of tho United
States to serve In ofiiecn of Importance ia
several departments of the Government. I
have reason to think that this selection Is duo
to an appreciation nf the disinterestedness of
tne policy which tne United Stiitcs havo pur
sued toward .latino. It Is our desire to con
tinne to maintain this disinterestedness and
Just policy with China as well as Japan. Tho
correspondence transmitted herewith shows
that there la nn disposition on the part nf this
Government to swerve from it established
course.
Prompted hy a desire to put an end to the
barbarous treatment of our shipwrecked sail
ors on tho Corean coast, I Instructed our
Minister at Pckln to endeavor to conclude a
convention with Core for securing the
safety and humane treatment of such mari
ners. Admiral Rogers waa Instructed
to accompany him with a sufficient force
to protect him in case of need. A small
surveying party sent out, on reaching the
coast, was treacherously attacked at a disad
vantage. Ample opportunity was given for
explanation and apology for the insult.
Neither came. A force was then landed.
After i ,- arduous march over rugged and
difficult country, tho forts from which
the outrages had been committed were gal
lantly assaulted, and n ere destroyed. Having
thus punished the criminals, and' having vln.
(Heated the honor of the flag, tho expedition
returned, finding It impracticable, under the
circumstances, to conclude the desired con
vention. I respectfully refer to the corre
spondence relating thereto, herewith sub
mitted, and leave the snbjeet for Such action
as Congress may see fit to take.
The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed
the very objectionable laws establishing
what is known as the free zone on the fron
tier of tho United States. It Is hoped that
tliis may yet he done, and also more stringent
measures may be taken by that republic re
straining lawless persons'on its frontier. I
hope that Mexico, by Its own action, will
soon relieve this government of the difficul
ties experienced from these causes.
Our relations with the various republics of
Central and South America continue, with
ono exception, to be cordial and friendly. I
recommend some action by Congress regard
ing the overdue instnllmants under the award
of the Venezuela Claims Commission of lHOd.
The Internal dissensions of that government
present no justification for the absence of an
ctl'ort to meet their solemn treaty obliga
tions. 1
The ratifications of an extradition treatv
iiu .Mcuragua nave nccn cxenangeu.
It is u subject for congratulation that the
great Empire of Brazil has taken the initiatory
steps toward the abolition of slavery. Our
relations with that empire, alwavs cordial,
will naturally bo made more so by this ai t.
It is not too much to hope that the Govern
ment of Brazil may hereafter find it for its in
terest, ns well as Intrinsically right, to ad
vance toward entire emancipation more rapid
ly than the present net contemplates. The
true prosperity and greatness of a nation is to
be found in the elevation and education of Its
laborers.
It is a subject for regret that the reforms
in this direction, which were voluntarily
promised by the statesmen of Spain, have not
been carried out In its West Indian colonies.
The laws and regulations for the apparent
aliolit ion of slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico
leave most of flic laborers in bondage, with
no hope of release until their lives become a
burden to their employers.
I desire to direct your attention to the fact
that citizens of the" United States nrc large
holders, in foreign lauds, of this species of
property, forbidden by the fundamental law
of their own country. I recommend to Con
gress to provide, by stringent legislation, a
suitable remedy against the holding, owning,
or dealing in slaves, or being interested in
slave property in foreign lands, either ns
owners, hirers, or mortgagers, by citizens of
the United States.
It Is to be regretted that the disturbed
condition of the Island of Cuba continues
to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety.
The existence of a protracted struggle in
such close proximity to our own territory,
without apparent prospect ot an early ter
mination, cannot be other than an object of
concern to a people w ho, while abstaining
from interference in the affairs of other pow
ers, naturally desires to sec every country in
the undisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty
and the blessings of 'free institutions. Our
naval commanders in Cuban waters have
been instructed, in case it should become
necessary, to spare no effort to protect the
lives and property of Ixma fiile American
citizens, and maintain the dignity of tint
flag. It is hoped that all pending questions
with Spain growing out of the affairs in
Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit of peace
and conciliation w hich has hitherto guided
the two powers in their treatment of such
(pi est ions.
To give importance to, nnd to add to the
efficiency of, our diplomat ie relutions with
Japan and China, and to further In retaining
the good opinion of those people, and to se
cure to the United States its share of the
commerce destined to flow between those na
tions mid the balance of the commercial
world, I earnestly recommend that an appro
priation lie made to support at least four
American youths in each of those countries,
to serve as a part of the official families of
our Miuisters there. Our representatives
would not even then be placed upon an
equality with the representatives of Great
Britain and some other powers. As now sit
uated, our representatives in Japan and
China have to depend for interpreters nnd
translators upon natives of those countries,
who know our language Imperfectly, or pro
cure for the occasion the sen ices ofcmploves
in foreign business houses, or the interpreters
to other foreign ministers.
I would also recommend liberal measures
for tho purpose of supporting the American
lines of steamers now plying between San
Francisco and Japan and China, and the Aus
tralian line, almost our only remaining line
of ocean steamers, unci of increasing their
service.
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The enlarged receipts of the Post Office,
Department, as shown by the accompanying
Report of the Postmaster General, exhibits
a gratifying increase in that branch of the
public service. It is the index of the growth
of education and of the prosperity of tho
people two element highly conducive to
tho vigor mid stability of republics. With a
voet territory like ours, much of It sparsely
populated, but all requiring the services of
the mail, it Is not at present to be expected
that this Department can be made self-sustaining
; but a gradual approach to this end,
from year to year, is confidently relied upon,
nnd the day is not far distant when the
Post Office Department of the Government
will prove a much greater blessing to the
whole people than it is now.
The suggestions of the Postmaster-General
for improvements In the department
presided over hy him, ure earnestly recom
mended to your special attention; especial
ly to the documents favorable to the con
sideration of tlie plan for uniting the telu
grupli system of the United States with the
postal system. It is believed that by such a
course the cost of telegraphing could be
much reduced and tho service as well, if not
better, rendered. It would secure the fur
ther advantage of extending the telegraph
through portions of the country where pri
vate enterprise win not construetit. Com
merce, trade, and. above all, the efforts to
bring a people widely separated into a com
munity of interests, are alwavs benefited by
a rapid Intercommunication. Education, tint
groundwork of republican institutions, is
encouraged by increasing tho facilities for
gathering sjicedy news from all parts of the
country. The desiru to reap tho benefit of
such improvements will stimulate education.
I refer you to the report of the Postmaster
General for full delails of the operations of
last year, and for comparative statements of
the results with former years.
THE KU-KLUX LAW.
There has been imposed upon the
Executive branch of tho Government
the execution of the act of Con
gress, approved April 'JO, 1ST I, and com
monly know n as tho "Ku Klux law," in a
portion of the State of South Carolina. T)ie
necessity of tho course pursued will ba
demonstrated by tho report of the
oininittce uppolnted to investigate the
Southern outrages. Under the provisions of
the above act, 1 Issued a proclamation, cull
lug the attention of the people of the United
Stales to the same, uiul declaring my re
luctance to exercise uny of tho extraordina
ry powers thereby conferred upon me, ex
cept lu the case of un iuiperutivu necessity,
but making known my purpose to exercise
such powers wheuuvcr It should become
necessary to do so for the purpose of secur
ing to all citizens of tho L'nltcd States the
f cuccful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed
o them hy the Constitution and the laws.
After the pussagu of this law Information
was received, from time to time, that com
binations of the character refn red to in this
law existed, and were powerful In many
parts of the Southern Slates, particularly lu
certain counties In the Stute of South Curo
linu, Careful Investigation was uiudo, and
It was ascertained that In nine counties of
that Stato such combinations wero active
and powerful, embracing n sufficient portion
of tho citizen to control the local authority,
and having, among other tlilnir. the nbieet
of depriving the emancipated class of the
suosiannai uenetits or freedom and of privi
lege, and tho free political action of those
citizens w ho did not sympathize, with their
own views. Among their operations were
frequent scourglngs and occasional assassina
tions, generally perpetrated at night by dis
guised persons, the victims, in almost all
cases, being citizens of different political
sentiments from their own, or freed persons
who had shown a disposition to claim equal
rights with other citizens. Thousands of
Inoffensive nnd well- disposed citizens were
itie suuercr ny tnis lawless violence.
Thereupon, on the 13th of October,
1H7I, a proclamation was issued, lu
terms of the law, calling upon tho mem
bers of tho combination to disperse within
five days, and to deliver to the Marshal or
military officers or tho United State all
arms, ammunitions, uniforms, disguises, and
other means and Implements used by them
for carrvinr out their unlawful fillrnoMPH
This warning not having been heeded, on the
17th of October another proclamation was
Issued, suspending the privilege of the writ
of habm cori In nine counties In that
State. Direction was given that within the
counties ao designated persons supposed,
upon credible information, to ho members
of such unlawful combinations, should be
arrested oy tno military forces or the United
States, and delivered' to the Marshal, to he
dealt with according to law. In two of the
SBld counties (York and Spnrtansburg) many
arrests have been made. At last account the
number of persons thus arrested was PW.
Several hundred, whose criminality was as
certained to be of an Inferior degree, were
released for the present. These have gen
erally made confessions of their guilt. Great
caution has been exercised in making these
arrests. Notwithstanding the large number,
it is believed that no Innocent person Is now
In custody. The prisoners will be held for
regular trial In the judicial tribunals of the
United State;. As soon ns it appeared that
the authorities of the United States were
about to take vigorous measures to enforce
the law, many persons absconded, and there
is good ground for supposing that all of such
persons have been violating the law. A full
report of what has been done under this
law will be submitted to Congress by the Attorney-General.
THE MORMONS.
In Utah there still remains a remnant, nt
barbarism repugnant to civilization to decen
cy unu to tne luws of the United States. Ter
ritorial officers, however, have been found
who arc willing to perform their
duty in a spirit of equity, and wjth a
due sense of sustaining tho majesty of the
iaw. tenner polygamy, nor any other vio
lation of existing statutes, will he permitted
within the territory of the United States.
It is not with the religion of the self-styled
"saints' that we are now dealing, but their
practices. They will be protected in the
worship of God according to the dictates of
their consciences, but they will not be per
mitted to violate the laws under the cloak
of religion. It may be advisable for Con
gress to consider what, in the execution of
the laws against polygamy, is to be the sta
tns of the plural wives and their offspring.
The propriety of Congress passing an en
abling act, authorizing he Territorial Leg
islature of Utah to legitimatize all children
horn prior to a time fixed in the act, might
be Justified by its humanity to these inno
cent children. This is a suggestion only,
and not a recommendation.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
has resulted favorably, so far as can be
Judged from the limited time during which
it has been in operation. Through the ex
ertions of the various societies OT Christians
to whom has been entrusted the execution
of the policy, nnd the Board of Commis
sioners authorized by the law of April 10,
1SJ, many tribes of Indians havo been in
duced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate
the soil and perform productive labor of va
rious kinds, and to partially accept civ-1
ilization. They are being cared for in such!
a way, it is hoped, as to induce those still
pursuing their old habits of life to embrace
the only opportunity which is left them to
avoid extermination. I recommend liberal
appropriations to carry out the Indian peace
policy ,not only because it is humane, Christian-like
and economical, but because it is
right. I recommend to your favorable con
sideration, also, the policy of granting a ter
ritorial government to the Indians in the
Indian Territory west of Arkansas and
Missouri and south of Kansas. In doing so,
every right guaranteed to the Indians by
treaty should be secured. Such a course
might in time be the means (if collecting
most of the Indians between tho Missouri
and Pacific and south of the British Posses
sions, into one Territory or one State-, and the
Secretary of the Interior has treated upon
this subject nt length ; and I recuiuuienu to
you his suggestions.
THE PUBLIC LANDS.
I renew my recommendations that the pub
lie lands be regarded as a heritage to our
children, to he disposed of only a required
for occupation, and to actual settlers. Those
already granted have been in great part (lis
posed of in suc h a way us to secure access to
the balance by the hardy settler who may
wi.-h to avail himself of them, but caution
should be exercised, even in attaining so de
sirable an object. Educational interests may
well be served by the grant of the proceeds
of the sale of public hinds to settlers. I do
not wish to be understood as recommending,
In the least degree, a curtailment of what is
being done by the General Government for
the encouragement of education.
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
submitted with this, will give you Informa
tion, collected and prepared for publicatiou,
in regard to tho census taken during the
year 170; the operations of the Bureau of
Education for the year; the Patent Office;
the Pension Office; the Land Office; and the
Indian Bureau.
AGRICULTURE.
The report of the Commissioner of Agrl
culture gives the operations of his depart
ment for the year. As agriculture is the
ground-work of our prosperity, too much
Importance cannot be attaehed to the labors
of this department. It is In the hands of an
able head, with able assistants, all zealously
devoted to introducing into the agricultural
productions of tho nation all useful pro
ducts adapted to any of the various climates
and soils of our vast Territories, and to giv
ing ail useful informaliou.aj to tho method
of cultivating the plants, cereals, and other
product adapted to particular localities.
(Juietlv, but surely, tho Agricultural Bureau
is working a great national good, and if lib
erally supported, the more widely its In
fluence w ill be extended, and the less de
pendent we shall be upou products of for
eign countries.
COMPENSATION OF CERTAIN OFFICIALS.
of bureaus, and officials holding positions of
responsibility, and requiring ability and char
acter to fill properly, is one to which your at
tention Is invited. But few of the officials
receive a compensation equal to the respecta
ble support of a family, while their duties
are such us to involve millions of interest.
In private life, services demand compensa
tion equal to the services rendered. A wise
economy would dictate tho same rule in the
government service.
ESTIMATES.
sup
port of tho government for the ensuing year,
nor a comparative statement for the year
just passed, and the one just passing, be
cause nil these figures are contained in the
accompanying report, or In those presented
directly to' Congress. These estimate have
my approval.
REMOVAL OF DISABILITIES.
years elapsed
the lust hostile gun was fired between the
armies then arrayed against each other, the
one for tho perpetuation ; the other for the
destruction, of the I'uion, It muv well be
considered whether It la not now time that
the disabilities imposed by tho Fourteenth
Annulment should be removed. That
amendment does not exclude the ballot, but
only require the disability to hold office of
certain classes. When the purity of the bal
lot lsj secure, majorities are sure to elec t
officers reflecting the view of the majority.
I do not eo the advantage or propriety of
excluding men from office merely because
they were, before the rebellion, of standing
and character sufficient to be elected to posi
tions requiring them to take an oath to sup
port the Constitution ; aud admitting the
eligibility of those entertaining precisely the
same views, but of let standing in their
communities. It muv be said that the former
violated un oath, while the latter did not.
The latter did not have it in their power to
do so. If they had taken this oath, it can
not lie doubted that would have broken it,
u (lid the former class. If there are uny
great criminal distinguished above uU other
for the part they took In opposition to thn
government, they might, In the Judgment of
Congress, be excluded from such an amnesty.
This snbjeet Is submitted for your careful
consideration.
The condition of the Southern States is, un
happily, not such as all truo patrotic ritizens
would like to sec. Social ostracism for opin
ion's sake, personal violence, or threats to
ward persons entertaining political views op
posed to thoso entertained hy the majority of
the citizens, prevent immigration and' the flow
of mueh-nccded capital Into the States lately
In rebellion. It will lie a happy condition of
the country when the old citizen of these
Stale will take an interest in public affairs,
promulgate their ideas honestly entertained,
vote for men representing thefr views, and
penult the same freedom of expression and
ballot in those entertaining different political
convictions.
IMMIGRANTS.
of immigrants, Ignorant of
our laws and habits, coining into our coun
try annually, has become so great, and tho
Impositions practiced upon them so numer
ous ifnd flagrant, that I suggest Congression
al action for their protection. It seems to
me a fair subject of legislation by Congress.
I cannot now state a fully as I desire the
nature of the complaints mado by emigrants
of the treatment they receive, but w ill en
deavor to do so during the session of Con
gress, particularly If the subject should
receive your attention.
NATIONAL FINANCES AND TAXATION.
The national debt has been reduced to the
extent ot K,(7,13B.H0 during tho year, and
by the negotiation of national bonds at a
lower rate of Interest, the interest on tho
public debt ha been o far diminished that
now the sum to he raited for interest account
Is nearly 17,0m,000 less than on the. 1st of
March, ltMi9. It was highly desirable that
this rapid dimunition should take place, both
to strengthen the credit of the country and
to convince it citizens of their entire ability
to meet every dollar of liability without
bankrupting them; but in view of the accom
plishment of these desirable end and the
rapid development of the resource ot tho
rountry, its Increasing ability to meet the
large demands, and the amount already paid,
it is not desirable that the present resources
of the country should continue to be taxed
in order to continue this rapid payment. I
therefore recommend a modification of both
the tariff and internal tax luws. I recom
mend that all taxes from Internal sources
be abolisheS, except thoso on spirituous,
vinou and mnlt liquors, tobacco in its vari
ous forms, nnd from stamps. In readjusting
tho tariff I suggest that a careful estimate be
made of the amount of surplus revenue col
lected under the present law after providing
for the current expenses of the Government. !
the interest account, and a sinking fund, and
that this surplus be reduced in such man
ner as to afford the greatest relief
to the greatest number. There are manv
articles not produced at home, such as medi
cines and compounded essence, from which
very little revenue is derived, hut which en
ter into general use. All such articles I rec
ommend to be placed on the free list.
Should n further reduction prove advisable,
I would then recommend that it he made up
on those articles which can bear it without
disturbing home production or reducing the
wages of American labor. I have not enter
ed into figures, because to do so would be to
repeat all that is laid before vou in the re
port of the Secretary of the Treasury.
COLLECTORS OF CUSTOMS.
The present laws for collecting tho rev
enues pay the Collectors of Customs small
salaries, but provide for shares In all seizures,
which, at the principal ports of entry par
ticularly, raise the compensation of these
officials to a large sum. It has always seem
cd to me a If this system must at times
work perniciously. It holds out induce
ment to dishonest men, should such get
possession of those offices, to be lax in their
scrutiny of goods entered, to enable them
finally to make large seizures. Your atten
tion is respectfully invited to this subject.
GOLD AND CURRENCY.
fluctuation In the value of
gold, compared with the national currency,
had a most damaging effect npon the in
crease aud development of the country in
keeping up prices of all articles necessary in
every-day life. It fosters a spirit of gam
bling prejudicial alike to national morals
and the national finances. If the question
can be met us to how to get a fixed value to
our currency, that value constantly and uni
formly approaching par with specie, a very
desirable object will be gained.
THE ARMY.
For the operations of the army In the
past year, the expense of maintaining It, the
estimates for the ensuing year, and for con
tinuing sea coast and other improvements
conducted under the supervision of the Wur
Department, I refer you to the accompany
ing report of the Secretary of War. I call
your attention to the provisions of the act of
Congress approved March 3, lsiM, which dis
continues promotions in the stuff corps of the
army until provided for by law. I recom
mend that the number of officers In oicli
grade of the stall corps be fixed, and that
whenever the number lu any one grade falls
below the number so fixed, that the vueancy
may ho filled by promotion from the grade
below. I also recommend that when the
office of chief of a corps becomes vacant, the
place may bo tilled by selection from the
corps in which the vacancy exists.
THE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
shows an improvement in the number anil
efficiency of the naval force, without materi
al increase In the expense of supporting it.
This is duo to -the policy which bus been
adopted, aud is being extended as fast a our
material will admit, of using r. aller vessels
as cruisers on the several stations. By
these means we have been enabled to oc
cupy at once a larger extent of cruising
ground, to visit more frequently the posts
where the presence of our flag f desirable,
and generally to discharge more efficiently
the appropriate duties of the navy in time of
peace.
Without exceeding the number of men or
of expenditure authorized hy law, during
the past year, the navy has, in'addition toils
regular service, supplied the men and officers
for tho vessels of the Coast Survey, aud has
completed the surveys authorized by Con
gress of the Isthmus of Darien undl'chuun
tepec, and, under liko authority, has sent
out an expedition, completely furnished and
equipped, to explore the unknown ocean of
the North. The suggestion of tho report
as to the necessity for increasing and im
proving the material of the navy, and the
plan recommended for reducing the personne
of the service to a peace standard, by the
gradual uholitlon ot certain grades of
officers, the reduction of others, and
tho employment of soma In the service of
the commercial murine, are well considered
nnd deserve tho thoughtful attention of
Congress. I also recommend that ull pro
motions in the navy above the ruuk of Cnp
tain bo by selection Instead of by seniority.
Till course will so curs, in the higher grade;,
greater efficiency, and hold out uu incentive
to young officers to improve themselves lu
the knowledge of their profession. The
present cost of maintaining tho navy, its
cost compared with that of the preceding
year, and the estimate for the ensuing year,
are contained in the accompanying report of
the Secretary of the Navy.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
It ha been tiie uiiu of the Administration
to enforce, honesty and efficiency in ull public
offices. Every public servant who has violated
the trust placed in him lias been proceeded
against with all the rigor of the law. If bud
men huve secured places, it has been the
fault of the system established by law and
custom for making appointments, or the
fault of those who recommend for Government
positions persons not sufficiently well known
to them personally, or who give leitcrs in
dorsing the charactei of office seekers, with
out a proper sense of the grave responsibil
ities which such a course devolve upon
tlieiii. A Civil Service Reform which can cor
rect tills abuse 1 much desired. In mercan
tile pursuits the business man who gives u
letter of recommendation to a friend to en
able him to obtuin credit from u strauger, is
regarded us morally responsible for the integ-ritv-of
Ills friend, und his ubility to meet Ins
obligations. A reformation which would en
force this principle ugaiust till Indorscr of
pci-snns for public place, would insure great
caution in making recommendations. A sal
utary lesson has been taught the cureless and
the dl.lioncst servants in tho great number of
prosecutions and convictions of the last two
years. It Is gratifying to notice tho
favorable chungu which is taking place
throughout the country lu bring
ing to punishment those who
have proved recreant to the trusts confided to
them, und lu elevating to public office uoiiu
but thoso w ho possess the confidence of the
holiest uiul virtuous, who, it will always be
found, comprise the majority of the commun
ity In which they live, lu my uiessagu to
Congress, ono year ago, I urgently recom
mended a reform lu the civil service of tho
couulry. lu conformity with that recommen
dation, Congress, in thn ninth sec tion of nn
net making appropriation for sundry civil
expenses of tho Government nnd for other
purposes, approved March II, lHil, gave the
necessary iiutnoriiy to the Incentive to inau
gurate a civil service reform, and P need nn
on him tho responsibility of doing so. Under
ine authority of said act, I convened a board
of gentlemen eminently qualified for the
work, to devise rules and regulations to eff ect
the needed reform. Their labors are not vet
completed, but It is believed that thev will
succeed in devising a plan whic h ciin be
adopted to the great relief of the Executive,
the heads of Depart incuts and member of
i ongress, nnd which will redound to tho true
Interest or the public service. At all events,
tho experiment shall have a fair trial.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Under the provisions of the act of Con
gress, approved February 31, 171, a Terri
torial Government w as organized in the Dis
trict of Columbia. lis results have thus far
Hilly realized the expectations of its advo
cates. Under the direction of the territorisl
officers, a system of improvements has been
Inaugurated, by means of which Washington
is rapidly becoming a city worthy of the na
tional capital. Tho citizens of tho district
having voluntarily taxed themselves to
a large amount for the purpose of
cnimniuiing to tne advancement or the sent
of Government. I recommend liberal niinrn.
priatlons on the part of Congress in order
that the Government may bear its Just sharo
of the expense of carrying out tho various
systems ot improvement.
GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN CHICAGO.
By the great lire in Chicago, the most Im
portant of the Government buildings in that
city wero consumed. Those burned had al
ready become inadequate to the wants of the
Government in that growing city, and, look
ing to the near future-, were totally inade
quate. I recommend, therefore, that an ap
propriation be made immediately to purchase
the remainder of the square on which tho
burned buildings stood, provided It con lie
purchnsed at a fair valuation, and provided
the Legislature nf Illinois will pass a law au
thorizing Its condemnation for Government
purposes, nnd also un appropriation of ns
much money as can properly be expended
towards the erection of new buildings during
this fiscal year.
CONCLUSION.
I have thus hastily summed np the opera
tions of the Government during the Inst year,
and made such suggestions asocenrs to me to
be proper for your consideration. I submit
them, with a confidence that your combined
action will be wise, statesmanlike and In the
best Interest of the whole eountrv.
U. S. GRANT, President.
EXECUTIVE MANSION, December 4 1871.
REPORT THE SECRETARY OF
THE TREASURY.
The following is a synopsis of the annual
report of Geo. S. Bout well, Secretary of the
Treasury:
THE PUBLIC DEBT.
year ending 30,
1H71, the reduction of the public debt was
!4,:7,7li.x4. The total decrease in the
public debt from March 1, 18tHl, to December
1, 171, was i7,211,HIK!.l, and during the
same period, the annual Interest has been
reduced lt),741,4:!i;.04.
A REDUCTION OF TAXES.
The revenues for the year llil, and the re
ceipts since 1st of June last, show that the
time has arrived when a considerable further
reduction in taxesc.un be made, and yet leave
the government in a position to pay'50,0(0,
000 annually of the principal of the debt, in
cluding the amount pledged through the
sinking fund.
THE REVENUE POLICY.
to formerly
expressed opinion that the settled policy of
the country should contemplate a revenue
sufficient to meet the ordinary expense of
the government, pay the interest upon the
public debt, and from twenty-five to fifty
millions of dollars of the principal annually.
He thinks the annual payment on the prin
cipal of the public debt "should not bo less
than fifty millions, arguing that, large as
the revenues of the country have been" dur
ing the last three years, our system of taxa
tion has not been oppressive to individuals;
nor has it In nny sensible degree embarrassed
the business of the country," and, while re
lief from taxation 1 desirable, it is yet more
desirable to maintain the public credit in It
present elevated position, not only as an ex
ample to other nations, but for its historical
value in enabling the government to make
loans for large amounts upon favorable
terms, If unhappily in the future an exigen
cy should require such loan to be made.
REVENUE RECEIPTS.
The revenue from customs for the year 1S71
waa greatly in excess of the estimates,
amounting to f3uii,27l), 408.05 against 1!I4,
&!S,:i74.44 for the preceding year. The cost
of collecting this revenue was $o,50l,(i7'.J.t)l
for 171, being three and clevon-hnndredths
percent while the cost for the year 1S70 was
t,ii7,l:ji 2A, or three and twanty-hundredtha
percent. The probabilities are "that the cus
toms revenue for the current year will exceed
that for the years 170 and 171. The receipts
from internal revenue were l43,()!l,15;i.tiJ, be
ing 4,04,!l4.a) less than tho estimates pre
sented to Congress In December last for the
fiscal year to June :Sli, 1S71. The estimates
for the current fiscal voir were l:2i,41S,0O0,
nnd it is probable that the receipts w ill be
equal to the estimates. The net receipts for
the fiscal year ending June UO, 171, were :
From customs, $Ki,?7U,4i8.u5 ; internal rev
enue, JlW.nw.l.W.ti:! ; sales of public lands,
t'i.WMII.liS; miscellaneous sources, fcil,

The estimated receipts for tho remaining
three-quarters of the current fiscal vear arii
25S,(KH),(K)0; expenditures, J2()I),5(K),()00
show ing a balance applicable to the pay
ment of the principal of the public debt for
the fiscal year ending Juno at), 1VJ, of I 1,
7',l4,'.nl.t8. The estimated receipts for the fiscal year
ending June at, 17:1, are JWSO.OOO.Oi'O; ex
penditures, iOlOo.tcm.'.ht. At the saine
time the Secretary makes calculation for a
reduction In the revenue from customs of
J0,iKi,()(), and from internal sources of
lil,tM0,(m He recommends to the consid
eration of Congress the reduction ot the du
ties on salt to the extent of 50 per cent. ; the
duty on bituminous coal to 50 cents per ton;
the reduction of the duty ou raw hides unci
skins, und the removal of ull duties from a
class of articles lu other countries which en
ter into the ui'ts anil manufacture of this
country, and which are not produced in the
United States, und the revenue from which
is Inconsiderable, Such u list, with the rev
enue derived from eueh article, is in course
of preparation, and will be submitted to
Congress,
THE CURRENCY.
The average premium on gold for the year
10, was :il.54 per cent.; for the year 1011 it
was 32.50 per cent, premium; for the year
170 it was 14.:i per cent, premium ; and for
the first eleven months of the year 171, It
was 12.1 per cent, premium. Tlhe value of
the paper currency of the country during the
years INK) and 1SV(), was apparently appreci
ated by the ieereascd use of paper 'money In
the South, tint chiefly by the establishment
of the credit of the United States upon a uni
form basis. On the 1st of January, 171, the
last-named fact was fully accomplished, and
since that lime tho appreciation of the paper
currency has been due wholly to the increas
ed demand for it in t lie business affairs of the
country.
One hundred and forty five banks have
been organized under the act approved July
12, 171, providing for the i.-sue of fifty-four
millions of dollars of additional hunk circu
lation, und the sum of !xx ha been
issued. By virtue of the uet the Treasury
has redeemed 22,2jI),U(!0 of the !l per cent,
certificates then in circulation, leaving the
sum of f'i!,4'.H,0o0 now outstanding. The
Secretary suggests that it appears to him to
be wise to leave the distribution of the cir
culation authorized by said act as it now
stands. Altliou'ub some efforts have been
made at counterfeiting, the peculiar paper
has rendered their elloi ls unsuccessful, ami
specimens captured are so crude as not to
excite serious upirehenslons us to ultimate
success. Since the first of July, 100, seventy
millions of paper havo been manufactured,
ull of w hich havo been accounted for ou the
hooks of tho Department. Thu Secretary
recommends that uu appropriation be made
for a new Inane of Natlonel Bunk notes.
Those now In Use aro much worn, and very
successful counterfeits of several denomina
tion have appeared.
REVENUE SEIZURES.
Secretary tho gress
to the importance of abolishing the
dVsIciu of shares lu moieties, as lur U it ef
fects revenue officer Bnd other persons offi
cially connected with the government.
INTERNAL COMMERCE.
It Is estimated that tho Internal commercs
of the country Is fifteen time as great as
our external 'commerce, but tho statistics
aro not trustworthy or complete, and l re
spectfully recommend that a provision bo
made for obtaining uch returns a will show
fully thn trade of the country upon its rivers,
canals, lake and railway.
THE SEAL FISHERIES.

agent, who ha charge of the fur aea.1 fish
eries at the islands of St. Paul and St.
George, show that tho business has heen
conducted by tho Alaska Commercial Com
pany, In substantial conformity to tho terms
of the controet.
SALARIES.
The Secretary again call the attention of
Congress to the Importance of Increasing
the salaries of the bureau officers and heads
of division In the Treasury Department,
great inequality and Injustice at present existing.
COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS.
persons designated
for clerical service, and for promotion in tho
Treasury Department, have been continued
with beneficial results, and the examination
is even more exacting in requirement than
nt the date of the last annual report. Means
will be. taken to extend the system, with
such modification as tho difference of tho
duties may suggest, but with equal efficien
cy, if possible, to tho principal Custom
House, and to other branches of the publio
service under control of this Department.
THE FIVE PER CENT LOAN.
The Secretary give a detailed history of
tho negotiation of tho new five-per cent,
loan in Europe and at home, claiming that tho
law had been complied with in such nego
tiations, and that the advantage! derived hy
the banks, or those represented by them, in the
tiso of the amount of their subscriptions for
three mouths, was without other loss to thu
government than was Incident to the negoti
ations of the loan under thc law.
The Secretary is informed by Judge Rich
ardson, nnd such Is his own opinion, that the
most serious obstacle in the way of negotiat
ing the 4 and 4Ji per cent, bonds in Europe
Is the inadequacy of the commissions allowed.
Thu credits! the country la fully established
in every financ ial center of Europe, nnd tho
bonds of the United States can be negotiated
at their market value in a larger number of
cities than the bonds of any other country in
the world. Under theso circumstances the
Secretary advises such an allowance for Com
missions upon the 4 and 4j percent, bonds
as will secure the negotiation of them with
the least possible delay. He also recommends
that authority be given for the payment of
interest in London, which, he says, enn bo
done without cost or risk to the government.
NATIONAL COMMERCE.
Retnrns for tho fiscal year 170 71 show
that the ocean commerce of the United
States is passing rapidly into the hands of
foreign merchants and shipbuilder. In IsfiO
nearly 71 percent, of theforeign commerce of
this country wa in American ship. In lfi4
it had fallen to 4(1 per cent., in 108 to 44 per
cent., and in 1871 it Is reported at less than
88 per cent. The loss of the shipping of
the United States is due chiefly to two
causes: First, the destruction of American
vessels by rebel cruisers during the war; and
secondly, the substitution of Iron steam
ships for transportation of freight and pa
sengcrs upon the ocean in place of sailing
vessels built of wood. The history of tho
los of our commerce renders it cer
tain that, without aoine efficient action
on the part of the government, tho cntiro
foreign trade ot the eountrv would soon puss
into the hands of our rivals. The Secretary
recommends the passage of a law granting
to persons who may employ in the foreign
trade Ameriean-bniit first-class steamships
of not less than 2,000 tons burden each, an
annual payment for the period of five years
of the sum of $13 per ton, The subsidy
should be proportionately to vessels of lowor
classification. In making this recommenda
tion, he does not assume that thero is no
other practicable method of restoring our
commerce, hut presents it a tho method
which appears to hiin to be the most
efficient and economical connected with
this plan. If it shall appear a claim
ed, that American iron Is about 10 per
cent, better than the Iron used in England,
an advantage will be secured not only in thu
diminished cost of the vessels, but also in tho
increased tonnage capacity of American ships
of equal dimensions over those constructed
with inferior materials. Accepting as a truth
established by experience, that the ocean
commerce of the world is to be carried in
Iron steamships, we must consider and de
cide whether the United States shall disap
pear from the list of maritime nations, or
whether, by u determined and practicable ef
fort, we shall regain the position we occupied
previous to the late rebellion.
Morals Market.
The New York Journal of Commerre
gives the following as the slate of the
morals market :
There baa been a good demand for
sharpness and acutencss. AVe notice also
some call for roguery and rascality. Sel
fishness is steady. Prudence the stock
small, but the demand inconsiderable.
Peculation and embezzlement looking up.
Gross flattery active, with a rising ten
dency. Adroit lying at a premium. Not
nijclt demand for truth, except in small
quantities; holders linn. Candor un
changed. Uprightness has a downward
tendency. Zeal for the right dull and
quiet. "Modesty lias declined. Light de
mand for justice ; not much offered. Cun

business done in pocket-picking; would
be better but for the police. Something
done in suicide. Housebreaking rather
active just now. Popularity many nnd
lively bids at first and second call. " Lovo
of goodness nnd of good men rather

especially if they promise quick returns.
Sincerity rather scarce and demand mod
erate, riypocrisy some stir ; we may
say active. Drunkenness much offered
and a good deal taken. Recklessness in
demand. Foolishness much in the
market, and considerable quantities taken
at high prices. Promises not intended to
be kept, plenty. Honest v firm, but at -low
prices. L'sury rather flat. Extortion

cholera. ' . . . '
Small-Pox.
S.MALL-rox is supposed to be most con
tageous during convalesence, therefore
strictly observe that the patient does not
mingle with the family until the scabs
are entirely off and only after a thorough
purification by washing und entire change
of clothing. After the patient is well or
leaves the room, let it be purified by. Hie
use of disinfectants, by whitewashing nnd
scrubbing the paint with soon and water,
and let such rooms or apartments be well
aired before being again occupied.
Have the patient placed in one of tho
upper rooms of tho farthest removed
from the rest of the family, where is to
be had the best ventilation and (solution.
Keep the room constantly well aired. He
move all carpets and woolen goods, and
nil unnecessary furniture.
Change the clothing of the patient as
often as needful, but do not carry it while
dry through the house, but first place it
at "the bedside in a bucket of scalding wa
ter before the removal from the room.
A correspondent of the Stockton (Cal.)
IL iuiUl gives the following as a sure cure
for snmll-pox:
I herewith append a recipe which has
been used to my knowledge in hundreds
of cases. It will prevent or cure tho
small -pox, even though the pittings are
filled. When Jenner discovered the cow
liox, in England, the world of science
hurled nn avalanche of fame on his head;
but when tho most scientific school of
medicine in the world- that of Paris
published this recipe as a panacea for
snmll-pox, it passed unheeded; it is as un
failing us fate, and conquers in every in
stance. It is harmless when taken by a
well person. It w ill also cure scarlet
fever. Here is the recipe as I have used
it and cured many children of the scarlet
fever; here it is as I huve used it and
cured the small pox, w hen learned phy
sicians said Ihe patient must die:
"Sulphide of zinc, one grain; foxglove
(digitalis) one grain; lnilf a teuspoonful of
sugar; mix with two tablespoons of
water."
When the above has been thoroughly
mixed, add four ounces of water. Take
a sooonl'ul every hour. Either disease
will disappeur in twelve hours. For a
child, small doses, according to age. If
cities would compel physicians to use
this there would bo no need of pest
houses. If you value advice and experi
ence, use this for that terrible and dread
ful scourge.
