Washington Dec Congress gave
respectful attention to President
Tafts message today but there wen
comparatively few members who were i
willing to concede the probability of
favorable action at tho present ses I
sion on many of the recommendations
contained therein This was In view
of the fact that the session will close I
March 4
The message was delivered to both
houses by Secretary Latta soon alter I
they convened al noon Mr l itta
made his appearance first in the sen I
ate arriving Immediately after the an
nouncement of the Presidents inten
tion to communicate his views in
writing This announcement was
made by Senator Cullom on behalf of
himself and Senator Money who con
stituted the senatorial committee to
inform the President that the senate
was prepared to receive recommenda
tions from him Almost immediately
afterward Mr Latta delivered the
messago to the house
The reading of the document which
was of unusual length was begun at
12 t 19 p in In the senate At first
most of the senators listened atten
tively but gradually this attention
ceased on the part of most of them
and those who remained in the cham j
her devoted themselves to printed cop
les before them This also was the
case in the house
The message follows
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives
During the past year the foreign
relations of the United States havo I
1 continued upon a basis of friendship
and good understanding
I I Arbitration
The year has been notable as wit
nessing the Pacific settlement of two
Important international controversies
before the permanent court of the
Hague
The arbitration of the fisheries dis I
pute between the United States and
i7 Great Britain which has been the
source of nearly continuous diplomat I
ic correspondence since the fisheries
I
convention of ISIS has given au I
I award which Is satisfactory to both
parties This arbitration is particu I
larly noteworthy not only because III I
the eminently just results secured
I but also because it is the first arbi
tration held under the general arbi
tration treaty of April 4 1908 be
tween the United States and Great
Britain and disposes of a controversy
the settlement of which has resisted
every other resource of diplomacy and 1
which for nearly 90 years has been
the cause of friction between two I
countries whose common Interest lies
in maintaining the most friendly and
cordial relations with each other
The United States was ably repre
sented before the tribunal and I
should be wanting In proper recogni
tion of a great patriotic service If
I did not refer to the lucid historical
analysis of tho facts and the sUual
ability and force of argument six
lays In length presented to the court
I in support of our case by Mr Elihu
Root
The tribunal constituted at The
Hague by the governments of the
United Stales and Venezuela has com
pleted Its deliberations and has rend
trod an award In tho case of the Ori
f I noco Steamship eonvpaiij against Ven
t 9 I ezuela The award may be regarded
as satisfactory since it has pursuant
I to the contentions of the United
States recognized a number of Irn
ortaut principles malting for a Ju
dicial attitude In the determining ol
International disputes
In view of grave doubls which hud
been raised as to the constitutionality
of The Hague convention for the es
tablishment of an international prize
court now before the Senate for rati
fication because of that provision of
the convention which provides that
there may bo an appeal to the pro
posed court from the decisions of na
tional courts this government propos
ed in an Identic circular noto address
ed to those powers who had taken
part In the London maritime confer
ence that the powers signatory to
tho convention If confronted with
some difficulty might Insert a reser
vation to the effect that appeals to
the International prize court in re
spect to decisions of its national trib
unals should take the form of a di
rect claim for compensation that the
Proceedings to be taken thereupon
should be In the form of a trial de
novo and that judgment of the court
should consist of compensation for the
Illegal capture irrespective of the de
cision of the national court whose
judgment had thus been Internation
ally Involved As the result of an in
formal discussion It was decided to
provide such procedure by means of a
separate protocol which should be rat
ified at the same time as the prize
court convention Itself
Accordingly the government of tho
Netherlands at the request of this
government proposed under date of
May 24 1910 to the powers signatory
to The Hague convention the nego
tiation of a supplemental protocol em
bodying stipulations providing for this
alternative procedure It Is gratify
ing to observo that this additional
protocol Is being signed without ob
jection by the powers signatory to
tho original convention and that there
is every reason to believe that the In I
I ternational prlzo court will soon be
established I I
I The Identical circular note also pro
posed that the international prize
court when established should be en
dowed with the functions of an ar
bitral court of justice under and pur
suant to the recommendation adopt
I cd bv the last Hague conference The
replies received from the various pow
ers to this proposal Inspire the hope
that this also may be accomplished
within the reasonably near future
It Is believed that the establish
mentment of these two tribunals will
Ion toward securing the
ro a long way
arbitration of many questions which
have heretofore threatened and at
j times destroyed the peace of nations
Peace Commission
I Appreciating these enlightened ten
dencies of modern times tho congress
at Its last session passed a law pro
viding for the appointment of a com
I mission of five members to be ap
pointed by the President of thu United
I Slates to consider the expediency of
utilizing existing International ageu
cics for the purpose of limiting the
I armaments of the nations of the world
by International agreement and of
constituting the combined navies of
he world on International force for
the preservation of universal peace
and to consider and rcnorl upon an
other means to diminish the expendi
tures of government for military purr
poses and to lessen the probabilities
of war
I have no appointments to this com
mission but I have Invited and await
the expressions of foreign govern
ments as to their willingness to co
operate with us In the appointment
of similar commissions or representa
tives who would meet with our com
mIssioner and by joint action seek to
make their work effective
Europe Canada etc
Several important treaties havo
been negotiated with Groat Britain In
the past 12 months A preliminary
diplomatic agreement has been reach
ed regarding the arbitration of pe
cuniary claims which ench govern
ment has against the other This
agreement with tho schedules of
claims annexed will as soon as tho
schedules are arranged be submitted
to the senate for approval
Portugal
In October lnat the monarch of Por
tugal was overthrown a provisional
republic was proclaimed and there
was set up a do facto government
which was recognized by the govern
ment of the United Slates for the pur
pose of ordinary Intercourse
Liberia
The negotiations which have been
undertaken for the amelioration of
conditions by the American commis
sion whose report transmitted to
congress July 5 are being brought to
a conclusion
The Near East
Turkey Reference Is made by the
President to the accession of his maj
esty Mahomet V emperor of tho Ot
tomans and the desire of the Unit
ed Stales to contribute to the larger
economic and commercial develop
ment due to the now regime in Tur
key
Montenegro The President ex
presses pleasure In having accorded
recognition of the United States to
tho new kingdom of Montenegro
I The Far East
The center of Interest in far east
ern affairs during the past year has
been again China
It Is gratifying to note that the ne
gotiations for a loan to the Chinese
government for the construction of a
railroad from Hankow south to Can
ton and westward through the Yang
Tsc valley known as the Ilukuang
loan were concluded by the represen
tatives of the various financial groups
In May last and the results approved
by their respective governments The
agreement already initiated by the
Chinese government Is now waiting
formal ratification Tho bsls of the
settlement of the terms of this loan
was one of exact equality between
America Great Britain France and
Germany with respect to the financ
ing of the loan supplying materials
for the proposed railroads and their
future branches
The application of the principle un
derlying the policy of the United
States In regard to limo Hunkang loan
namely that of tho Internationaliza
tion of foreign Interests in such rail
I ways of China as may be financed by
foreign countries was suggested on a
broader scale by the secretary of state
I in a proposal for Internationalism and
commercial neutralization of all the
railways of Manchuria While the
principle which led to the proposal
of this government was generally ad
milled In the powers to whom It was
addressed the governments of Russia
and France were apparently engaged
In the execution of the larger plan
which prevented their ready adher
ence
The policy of this government in
this mutter has been directed by a
desire to make use of American cap
ital In the development and promo
I
lion of Chinas wolfare and material
prosperity without prejudice to her le I
gitimate rights as an Independent po
litical power
rime treaty annexing Korea to the
empire of Japan promulgated Aug
29 1910 marks the final step In a
process of control of tho ancient em
pire by her powerful neighbor that
has boon In progress for several years
past
In communicating tho fact of an I
nexation tho Japanese government
gave to the government of the United
States assurance of the full protec I
tion of the rights of American citi I
zens in Korea under the changed con
ditions
Latin America
During the past year several of our
southern sister republics celebrated
the one hundredth anniversary of their
Independence In honor of these
events special embassies wero sent
from this country to Argentina Chile
and Mexico where the gracious recep
tion and splendid hospitality accorded
them manifested the cordial relations
and friendship existing between those
countries and the United States rela
tions I am happy to say have never
been on so high a plane and so solid i
a basis as at present
President Taft refers to the work
of the fourth PauAmcrlcan confer
ence which met In Buenos Ayres dur
ing July and August last and says
The special cordiality between rep
lescntative men from all parts of Am
erica which was shown at this con
lercncc cannot fall to react upon and
draw still closer the relation between
the countries which took part in IL
The International Uurcau of Am
erican Republics Is doing a broad and
useful work for PunAmerlcun com
merce and comity
1 am glad to say that the action of
the United States in Its + leslro to re
move imminent danger of war be
tween Peru h Ecuador growlnEg ut
of a boundary dispute with tho CO
oueratlon of Brazil and tho Argentine
Republic as joint mediators with this
government has already resulted suc
cessfully in preventing war The In
estimable value of cordial coopera
tion between the sister republics of
America for the maintenance and
hence In this hemisphere has never
been moro clearly shown than in this
mediation by which three American
I governments have given to this hemi
sphere tho honor of first Invoking the
most fnrreaching provisions of The
llnguo convention for the pacific set
tlement of international disputes
Thore has been signed by the rep
resentatives of tho United States and
Mexico a protocol submitted to the
United StatesMexican boundary corn
mission whose membership for the
purpose of this case la to be In
creased by the addition of a citizen of
Canada on the question of sovereign
ty ovor the Chamltsal tract which lies
within tho present physical boundaries
In tho City of El Paso Texas The
determination of this question will re
move a source of no little annoyance
to tho two governments
During the past year tho republic
of Nicaragua has been the center of
Internecine struggle General Zel
aya for seventeen years the absolute
I ruler of Nicaragua was throughout
hlc career the disturber of Central
America and opposed to every plan
for the promotion of peace arid friend
ly relations between the five rojiul
lies The president then reviews the
rebellion and the unwarranted execu
tion of two American citizens who
lad regularly enlisted in the ranks
of the revolutionists whch Involved
the breaking off of all diplomatic re
lations with the Zelnya government
The moderation and conciliatory
spirit shown by the various factions
gives ground for the confident hope
that Nicaragua will soon take its
rightful place among the lawabiding
and progressive countries of the
world
It gratifies me exceedingly to an
nounce that the Argentine republic
some months ago placed with Ameri
can manufacturers a contract for the
construction of two battleships
I Tariff Negotiations
The new tariff law In section 2 re
specting the maximum and minimum
tariffs of the United States which
piovlsious came Into effect April 1
1910 Imposed upon the President
responsibility of dotcr mining prior to
that date whether guy undue discrim I
ination existed against the United
States an tilts products lu any country
of the world with which we sustained
commercial relations
In the caso of several countries in
stances of apparent undue discrimina
tion against American commerce wore
frond to exist Those discriminations
vrc removed by negotiation Prior
to April 1 1910 when the maximum
tariff was to come Into operation with
respect to Importations from nil these
countries In Whose favor no proclama
tion applying the minimum tariff
should be issued oy the president
13 J such proclamations were issued
This series of proclamation embraced
the entire commercial world and
lance the minimum tariff of the Uult
ed States has been given universal ap
r
1
plication thus testifying lo the sat
isfactory character of our trade rela
tions with foreign countries
Marked advantages to the commerce
of the United Stales woro obtained
throughout these tariff settlements
The policy of broader and closer
trtde relations with the Dominion of I
Canada which was initiated in an ad
juaimcnt of the maximum and mini I
mum provisions of the tariff act of I
August 190J has proved mutually
Lineflclal It justifies further of I
forts for the readjustment of thu com
I
merclal relations of the two countries
tie that their commerce may follow I
the channels natural to contiguous
countries and be commensurate with I
th3 steady expansion of trade and In I
dustry on both sides of the boundary
line
The Department of State
All these tariff negotiations so vi
tal to our commerce and Industry
and the duty of jealously guarding
the equitable and Just treatment of
our product capital and Industry
abroad devolve upon the department
of state
The Argentine battleship contracts

Argentine railway equipment and
those for Cuban government vessels

Importance of this factor The great

for rapid and direct mall passenger

urgent as between tho United States
and Latin America Ve can secure
In no other quarter of the world such

commerce as would flow from the dl

aspect unless we create a merchant
marine where can we find the sea

we find lu case of war the transports

a naval fleet is arms without a body
For many reasons I cannot too strong

other subvention adequate to guar

velopment of an American merchant
marine and the restoration of the
American flag to Its ancient place up

With our Increasing International
Intercourse It becomes incumbent up
on me to repeat more emphatically
than ever the recommendation which i
I made in my Inaugural address that
congress shall at once give to the
courts of the United States juriddlc
tlon to punish as a crime tho violation I
of the rights of aliens secured by I
treaty with the United States in or
I der that the general government of J
tho United States shall l > o able whoa +
called upon by a friendly nation to
redeem Its solemn promise by treaty I
to secure to tho citizens or subjects
of that nation resident Iir the United
States freedom from violence and due
process of law in respect to their
life liberty and prosperity
Treasury Department
Estimates for Next Years Expenses
Every effort has been made by each
department chief to reduce the esti

congress may understand that these

smallest sum which will maintain the
departments bureaus and offices of

that a cut of theso estimates would
result In embarrassing the executive
