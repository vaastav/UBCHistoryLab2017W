A telegbam from Col. J. R. Dillon
to Hon. L. C. Houk and published in
the National Republican, announces
that Gov. Marks dec-idea the election
for a representative in the legislature
from Polk and Bradley counties a lie
between Joute, republican, and Stew
ait, democrat,"and that a vacancy ex
ists. We presume another election
will be ordered at once.
Congressman Cox, chairman of the
census committee will, at an early
day, introduce a bill for the reappor
tionment of representatives in con
greea on the basis of 170,000 population
to each congressional district. This
would leave the number of representa
tives about as tt present 293. But it
is probable that the number will be
increased some tbink to 325.
There ia a growing disposition in
this country to banish everything
like sectarianism from the schools of
thn countrv. As they Iccreass in
favor the people become more watch
ful in guarding against everything
that might possibly impair their use
fulness. Even in sectarian colleges
careistiken by those most popular
nd useful, to guard against the
teaching of sectarianism in any
form that might prove cflkn
sive. We are glad this ia
true, and above all things, the people
are determined that nothing of this
kind ehall enter into the manage
ment of the free echools of the couns
try. Such a thing will not be tolerated
and ought not to be. The free school
Interest U too sacred to be managed by
any such a narrow-minded epirit.
We yielded a liberal thare of our
space to a synopsis of and extracts
from the president's mespage. Line
all of President Hayes' tt-.t) papers, it
is a plain, comprehensive, common
sense document. Public questions
are discussed in a dignified manner,
and it may be stt down ea certain that
hia last annual message will detract
nothing from the high rtsptct
in which the administration is
held by all classes of
people. He makes a number of
impoitiat recommendations and sug
gestions. What he says about polyga
my will command the approval of a
large number of the very,fcett peopla
in the land. His recommendation in
regard to the silver dollar will doubt
le33 provoke discussion. His views on
the refunding of that portion of our
securities falling due next year are
sound and are doubtless in accord with
a mejority of both houses of corgrc-rs.
He suggests the creation of a nsw
grade in the army for General Grant,
which we believe will be endorsed by
the country. He makes a number of
recommendations it will be teen, all of
which touch upon questions of vital
importance to the country.

XLYI. CONGRESS.
SENATE.
Washington, Dec. 7.
Senator Jonas presented the creden
tials of Hon. Thos. C. Manning, ap
pointed by the governor of Louisiana
. . " - m tt no -l
to fill the place oi ii. ju. oponora,
deceased, until the next meeting oi
the Louisiana legislature. They were
read and filed.

to authorize the local taxation of legal
tender treasury notes. Referred to

Yarious communications from
the departments were submitted, and
at 12:35 the senate went into execu
tive session. The doors reopened at
12:50 and the senate adjourned,
HOUSE.
Washington, D. G, Dec. 7.
Mr. Ward, of Pennsylvania, intro
duced a bill for the appointment of
an assistant secretary of war. Re
ferred.
Mr. Belford, ef Colorado, offered
a resolution directing the secretary
of the interior to inform the house
under what law or warrant oi au
thority Douglass, a sub-chief of the
Ute tribe of Indians, is connned in
the military prison at Fort Leaven
worth, and what steps, if any, have
been taken by the United States
authorities to bring, him to trial for
alleged complicity in the murder of
Indian Agent Meeker. Adopted.
The speaker proceeded to call the
committees for reports.
Tho call having been concluded
without the presentation of any re
ports Mr. Bicknell called up, as a
question of privilege, the senate
resolution relative to the counting of
the electoral vote.
Mr. Keifer raised to a point of
order that the resolution did
not present a question of privilege.
A debate ensued, m which
Messrs. Bicknell and Springer
maintained that whatever related to
the constitutional right of the two
houses to declare the electoral vote
was a question of privilege. The
house had certain powers relative to
the election of President. It, and it
alone, must determine when the con
tingency arises what was contemplat
ed in the constitution and when it
must act in the matter and choose a
president.
Messrs. lieuer and Robeson con
tended that a concurrent resolution
proposing a joint rule to the pres
ent mode of counting the electora.
vote was not a question of privilege
The president of the senate alone
had the right to count the electora
vote. The house could not make
contingency and then declare that it
had arisen and proceed to elect
president. The house, they main
tained, had nothing to do with the
making of the contingency.
The speaker replied that the house
was tho sole judge of the question
of the fact whether or not a contin
gency has arisen. It must determine
when, under the constitution, it must
choose a president, and a president
so chosen will be the president of
the United States.
Mr. Reagan (Texas) argued that
the matter presented was a question
of privilege and that the president of
the senate was merelv a vehir.lA or
medium between the electors and the
two houses of congress.
After some further debate, in
which Messrs. Conger, of Michigan,
Hooker, of Mississippi, Updegraff,
of Iowa, and Whitthorne, of Tennes
see, participated.
The speakers said the uniform
practice, certainly a recent practice,
goes to the extent of showing that
the two houses do count, and have
counted the electoral vote. If
the chair were to refuse on tech
nicalities to allow an adjournment
between the two houses as to the
government of the houses when in
joint session, it might lead to con
fusion, chaos, and perhaps commo
tion. In the opinion of the chair it
makes no difference by whom the
votes are counted. If done by the
two houses it is the highest duty
they have to perform. If done by
any other person it must be done in
the presence of the two houses; so
that any rule relating to the joint
meeting is a question of the very
highest privilege, and he must so
rule.
Mr. Bicknell then demanded the
previous question, and the democrats
refusing to allow the renublififina un
limited time for debate, the latter
filibustered to prevent action. For
a time it seemed as if the house
would come to a dead lock,
but Mr. Keifer finally withdrew his
demand for the previous queition,
and Mr. Keifer delivered a written
argument against the pending meas
ure, which he characterized aa a
measure of usurpation and fraud and
one which might lead to blood shed
and war. At the conclusion of his
speech the subject went over for the
present and the house adjourned.
WASHINGTON.
Washington, Dec. 6. Attorney
General Devens in his annual report
recommends the establishment of an
intermediate court of errors and ap
peals to relieve the supreme court
and facilitate justice; the exempting
of postmasters from personal liabil
ity when sued for official ; acts; the
repeal of the statute allowing claim
ants in the court of claims to verify
their petition by agents; payment of
United States attorneys by salary in
stead of fees; extension of federal
election laws to all polls where con
gressmen are voted for instead of
their application only, po cities of
20,000 inhabitants and upwards; also
placing the control of such polls in
the hands of federal instead of state
officers; the establishment of a
United States penitentiary in Arizo
na or New Mexico.
The president has sent a large
number of nominations to the sen
ate. They are mostly for appoint
ments, made during congressional
recess, among which are the follow
ing: Albion L. Morgan, collector of
internal revenue, first district, Ala
bama. Jos. W. Burke, collector of
customs, Mobile, Ala. Andrew J.
Dumont, naval officer, New Orleans.
Frank Connelly, postmaster at Alex
andria, La.; Richmond Kennedy, Mc
Minnvillle, Tenn.; Alex. G. Pearce,
Greeneville, Miss.; Joseph G. Boone,
Round Rock, Texas.
Washington, Dec. 7. At a meet
ing of the ways and means committee
of the house, this morning, the re
funding bill was taken up and, after
some discussion of the subject, a
motion was made by xiepresentative
Tucker (Virginia), and unanimously
carried, that the chairman be author
ized to amend the refunding
bill now pending before congress
by inserting three per cent, wherev
er the words three and a half occur.
It is believed by the committee that
the time has arrived when the three
per cent, bonds can be floated at par.
The committee adjourned till Thurs
day at 10:30 a. m.
The republican senators held a
caucus this morning to determine
what changes, if any, should be made
in the minority representation on the
senate committees for this session.
It was agreed that with the excep
tion of one or two unimportant
changes the republican membership
shall remain as at present.
No business was transacted by the
senate in executive session to-day ex
cept to refer to appropriate commit
tees nominations that were received
from the President yesterday.
The house committee on commerce
held a meeting this morning and be
gan work on the river and harbor
bill. They will meet in full com
mittee on Tuesdays and Thursdays
until the bill is perfected. In the
absence of Chairman Atkins Repre
sentative Blount, of Georgia, presi
ded at the meeting of the house
committee on appropriations to-day.
Reports were received from the
sub-committees in charge of pen
sions", military academy, fortifica
tions and the censular and. diplomat
ic appropriation bills, all of which
are fairly advanced. It is thought
that three, if rot all, of these bills
will beieady to be reported to the
house Thursday.
The sub-committee on the con
sular and diplomatic bill will hold a
conference with Secretary Evarts to
day and expect to perfect the bill in
a few days. The committee ad
journed to Thursday.
Tho house committee on public
lands will meet to-morrow for the
consideration of Delegate Brent's, of
Washington territory, bill to extend
the land laws of the United States
over the territory of Alaska.
A bill was introduced to-day by
senator McDonold to authorize a
local taxation of legal tender treas
ury notes of the United States. It
is, in its full text as follows :
Be it enacted, etc., that from and
after the passage of this act any
state or territory of the United
States may provide for, including in
the valuation of the personal proper,
ty of the owner or holder, any legal
tender notes of the United States
and denominated as lawful money,
owned and held by any per
son or corporation in assessing
taxes imposed by the authority of
such state or territory, and may im
pose a tax thereon, but the tax im
posed on .any such legal tender
treasury notes shall not be at a
greater rate than is assessed or im
posed upon gold or silver coin of the
United States in the hands of indi-
vidual citizens or residents of such
state or territory.
Section 2. - All laws or parts of
laws in conflict with this act are
hereby repealed.
DECLINE IN GRAIN.
Chicago, Dec. 6. The Daily News
says : The decline in grain and pro
visions which lately set in aggregates
a value . approximating $1,100,000.
There was a decline of nearly a cent
in wheat this morning, and all other
grains were weak. Provisions were
decidedly lower, but recovered some

towards noon.

Debts and Sinking Funds.
Mb. Editor : It ia & sound princi
ple ofro'.itical economy as a ei as of
morals, that where detti ae;tob3
paid by taxation no'debt ought to be
created, unless the act of its creation
be accomplished by th? imit.t on of a
special fund to run witL it in point of
time pari passu, witH a view to its
ultimate payment." Rut our state,
county: and municipal governments
pay no h?adt thi? pound principle.
They create uebls lunuing up to . hun
dred thousands and miiliocs, and make
no provisions 1 1 mast them. It is not i
just ta posterity to burden it with the
debts of our own contracting. Surely
our legislator? act hastily : and reck
legsly in making debt?. If the laws
under which our state bonds were
Issued had betu .carefully drawn
providing for sinking funds we would
never have b.eu brought to the present
situation, or at leatt, there would not
have been so good reason for complaint
on the part of tax payers. We would
have had no question of repudiation
to agitite ns.
Our county and our city are going on
in the game unguarded a:td eareiees
manner, making huge debts and sufi
fering them to run to maturity with
out a thought a? to how they are
to be paid. Ia it not time we
were beginning t look ahead,
guarding against any further reckless
debt-creating iegislatioa, and seeking
t) remedy as far as may be the evil
steps of the past?
Why should not the general assem
bly at the approaching session, when
it shall have eettled the state debt,
provide not only for the iutjre&t, by
meking the coupons receivable for
taxes, but for the ultimate redemp
tion of the principal ?
And why should it not enact such a
law as will enable counties and cities
to create sinking funda to meet present
ani future indebtedness?
I beg to prteent for the considera
tion of tlioae of your readers who may
tike interest ia puch rnster3, apian
for .operating a sinking fund which,
it strikes ma, might be used with great
success in either state, county or mu
nicipal all'air.-). It ia net original. It
was used some years einee in Memphis,
and doubtless if it had been begun in
timo thbt city might have bten saved
its present humiliation. The plan is
legal, for it has been tested in the high-
est.c urts. I cm not se in it any in
jctt.ee to creditor?. That fealure which
provide that the lauebiel corporation,
iarough its commissioners, iny purs
chae in its obligations at the
market price may have the aps
pearance of dealing in n manner
which high spirited business men
would not commend or use ia their
own affairs, Oct is it works no injus
tice I think it not seriously objection
able. When tie creditor ia under the
necessity of disposing of his security
for what it will bring in the market
and before its maturity, why" should
not the debtor, as well 8s? any other,
ee'zs tho opportunity t make tbe
profi1, and feo relieve the ax-payers?
H;at?, county and municipal bonds are
often at a large discount, mere because
of the long time they have to run than
because of any discredit of the maker.
Only capitdUti can hold them, and
when any are to be bought they really
have the fixing of the piice. They can
depress or enhance, aa it suits their
purpo?e. 1 see no reason why the
debtor should put himself or iteelf in
an attitude to take advantage of every
deline in price of his or iti obligations,
inasmuch it is brought about in tie
manner indicated. Of course, it would
not be honorable or fair for a corpora
tion. by any act of its own, to depre
cieta its bonds in crder t make for
itself a profit, it ehould pay promptly
the ktireHt accruiog, and should pro
vide for the pnncipal, but If any
creditor wishes, for any reason, to part
with his band at lees than it) face
value let iha corporation ba in a con
dition to buy it.
THE PLAN.
1. A tax id to be levied for the sole
purpose of creating a sinking fund, to
be used only in retiring me nonce.
2. This tax is to be collected in
money and a separt3 acount thereof
kept by the eoilestor and paid over in
accordance with the provisions of the
ordinance or law.
3. Stuking fund commissioners shall
be appointed, who Bhall give bond and
tike an oath for the raitirui adminis
tr&tioo of the sinking fund.
4. The tax collector to pay over
monthly to the commissioners the
sinking fund tax.
a. The comptroller of the city treas
ury ehall keep an account with the
commissioners, charging them with
the amounts paid them by the tax col
lector, and crediting them with the
aaaoua's paid out in the purchase of
tae bonds of tUe city. He Bhall also
charge them with tb&interest accruing
on such bonds as they ma; purcha9a
f om time to time,
6. As soon as tie commissioners shall
receive from the tax collector a suffi
cient sum, and from time to time there
after, as they may receive other sums
either from the collector or in pay
ment of ii.tireet on bonds purchased,
they shall invast the same in the pur
chase of a bond or binds of the city
not ytt matured, 1 1 the lowest price at
which the same may be had, for the
account of the siukiug fund.
7. The comiiistiouers shall make
monthly or quarterly settlements with
the treasurer. At such eettlementa
fie commissioners, shall produce all
the tonds they have purchased up to
that time, with the coupons belonging
thereto, and tha treasurer ehall cause
them to be stamped (both coupons and
bond) with the word?, "Belonging to
the sicking fund," and shall cancel
said bonds and coupons so as to pre
vent future negotiation, and ehall
also record their numbers, amounts,
dates and time of maturity, and then
rttirn to the commissionerp."
8. The oommissioners shall retain
every bond bo purchased and canceled
until mitarit, from time to time col
lecting the coupons, and using same
in purchasing bonds in the manner
provided in reference to the monies
received from the tax collector.- When
bonds mature they are to be filed in
the office of comptroller or treaaurtr.
The above 13 the outline. An ordi
nance embodying the plan would, of
course, be more elaborate, and .with
provisions and .restrictions guard
ing any Improper use of the bonds,
coupons and monies of the- sink
ing fund If our city was now oper
ating under such a plan, we could
not fail to derive much benefit. If!
no opportunity was offered to buy
In any of our bond the sinking fund
would be all the wbiia increasing, so
that by the time of t ie maturity of our
indebtedness . we would have some
thing with which to meet it. By this
means the payment of principal ai
well as interest is distributed over a
number of years," and hence tie bur
den to the tax payer is higher. Prompt
payment of interest, with certain
provision for the principal of a debt
would soon e-tabnph a high cre-ii t. and
when we had occasion - to -brtow
money we could gtt it at low rre cf
interest. -- .

A BEAUTIFUL INVENTION.
Fabrics of Beauty, Strength, and
Warmth,. Chiefly Made From
Spun Glass.
, ' Special to the Cincinnati Gazette.
Kew Yoke. Dec. 2. The injrenuitv !
that led to the manufacture of articles of !
clothing from paper has been eclipsed, as
simiiiar articles are now made from glass.
An up town dry goods house has on ex
hibition a glass tablecloth several feet
square, of varigated colors, with ornament
al border and fringed edges. The fabric
is flexible and only a little heavier than
those woven of hax. while it is claimed
that it can be washed and ironed like an
ordinary tablecloth.
Oriass has been spun and woven in
Austria for soma years, but it is a new
undertaking in this country. A prominent
glass manufacturing firm of Pittsburg,
Pa., recently engaged in the manufacture
of this brittle substance into fabrics,
which they claim are as perfect, delicate.
and durable as the finest silk. A repre
sentative of this firm said yesterday that
they can spin 250 fine threads, each ten
miles long, in one minute. The weaving
is done with an ordinary loom, but the
process is more difficult and much more
interesting than the spinning of cotton or
other threads.
"We can duplicate in glass any cos
tume," said thi3 gentleman, "and can
mafcc i it just as brilliant in color, elaborate
in finish, perfect in lit, and equal in its
smallest details, even to the buttons on the
original. The fabric is very strong, can
not be ripped or torn, and can be sold at
a less price than linen, cotton, or silk, or
other fabric imitated. It is a'so very
warm, easy fitting, and comfortable,
whether worn as dress, shawl or other
garment in ordinary clothing.''
Among the articles already manufac
tured of glass are.beautiful feathers, which
resemble thoso 6f the ostrich; towels,
napkins, and table cloths.
A Foul-31outlictl Woman
is even worse than a foul-mouthed
man. But no one need be foul-mouthed
if they will only use EOZODONT and
rub it in well. Don't spare the brush
and spoil the mouth, as some parent)
do with their children when they
withhold the rod.
. Feeble Lalies,
Those languid, tiresome tentationa,
causing you to feel scarcely able to be
on your feet; thai constant drain that
is taking from your system all its
elasticity; driving the Lkom from
your cheeks; that continual strain
upon your vital force?, rendering jou
irritible and fretful, can easily be re
moved by the use of that marvelous
remedy, Hop Bitter?. Irregularities
and obstructions of your ey&tem are
relieved at once, while the epeefal
cause of periodical pain is permanent-,
ly removed. Will you heed this?
