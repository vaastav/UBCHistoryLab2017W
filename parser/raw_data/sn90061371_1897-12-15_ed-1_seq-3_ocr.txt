States Sketch of Her Ufe.
Cahtox, 0., Dec 13. Mrs. McKinley
passed from life at a few minutes past
two o'clock yesterday morning, with
11 her children and other immediate
rela tires at her bedside. She did not
offer any in her last hours but grad
ually passed from the deep, palsied
sleep in which she has rested almost
constantly for the past ten days into
the sleep of death.
No word could be secured from the
house for some hours before the disso
lution. Knocks of reporters as well as
those of telegraph messengers were
unanswered.
At 2:H5 an undertaker was sum
moned and the first publicity given to
the death.
The end was most beautiful in its
quiet and peacefulness. She seemed
to sleep so soundly that it was difficult
to tell whether she had yet breathed
her last. This condition lasted foi

half an hour. There was no struggle.
She seemed to sleep her life away.
The president and all of her family
were by her side. There were no rec
ognitions, however. Her last con
sciousness was hours before her final
taking away.
At 3:30 a. m. the family, worn out,
with long watching, retired for the
first rest in the McKinley house for
ten long days and nights. The presi
dent's wife stood the strain better than
it was feared she might. The family
in their long vigils have all seemed to
have the great strength of the mother,
whose vitality at nearly 90 surpassed
the expectations of the doctors and de
layed the end for ten days that was
expected in a few hours.
Sketch of the Life of Slot her McKinley.
Mrs. McKinley was distinctively a home-loving
woman, anil the two-story frame cottage
on WestTuscar iwas stroet in this city, where
she died and where she had lived for many
years, was dearer to her than any other spot
on earth. There she spent her declining d.iys
with her daughter Helen and her grandchil
dren Orace and James McKinley, receiving oc
casional visits from her other children, seldom
going out except to church, where sho could
be found every Sunday morning unless pre
vented by illness.
While showing deep affection for her other
children she had followed the career of Wil
liam with pride and solicitude. With fond,
motherly admiration she watched him rise
from the position of prosecuting attorney of
his own county, by successive stages to con
gressman, governor and finally to tho preii
dency. During the memorable campaign of last
year for the nomination and nftcrwar.is for tho
election, Mrs. McKinley was one of the
most interested observers. Sho was
always given the place of honor at the
home of her illustrious son, and on the day of
his nomination by the St. Louis convention she
heard the news as soon as'he did. It was then
that William McKinley showed the deep love
he bore for his mother by kissing her as guon
as he had received the announcment of the re
sult at St. Louis. All through the trying cam
paign that followed, she watched after her son
with deep interest. She was a frequent caller at
his house and was greeted by many visiting
delegations of republicans.
Mother McKinley accompanied tho president
to the Inauguration, riding in a special train,
and remained in Washington until Mr. aud
Mrs. McKinley had become settled in their new
home. Then she returned to the Canton cot
tage with expressions of gratitude at getting
borne once more.
Nancy Allison McKinley came of a family
which as transplanted from England to the
hills of Virginia. The Allison family subse
quently removed to Ureen county, Pa., where
Abner Allison, Nancy's father, was born and
where he married Ann Campbell, of Scotch
German descent. Early in the present century,
Mr. and Mrs. Allison came from Pennsylvania
to Columbia county, this state, traveling by
pack horses.
In 1S09. near the present city of Lisbon,
Nancy Allison was born. Her girlhood was
passed on the farm, and In 18:7 she married
William McKinley. a young iron manufacturer.
The couple lived first at Fairtteld and after
ward at Niles and Uolnnd before moving to
Canton. Nine children were born to them. They
were David Allison, deceased; Anna, deceased;
James, diceased; Mary, deceased; Helen
Minerva, now living at Canton; Sarah Eliza
beth, now the wife of Mr. A. J. Duncan, of
Cleveland; William, the president; Abigail
Cella. deceased, and Abner, whose home Is la
New York.
William McKinley, Sr., died in Novcmbei

M'KINLEY ON THE CURRENCY.
The President Remains Firm o the
Gold Standard.
That part of the president's mes
sage which deals with the currency
problem is a clear presentation of our
present financial condition, a plain
statement of the dangers and embar
rassments under which the nation's
treasury now labors, and a strong ar
gument in favor of reform in our
monetary laws.
Perhaps the feature of this part of
the message which will be received
with greatest approval by the commer
cial and financial world is the presi
dent's unequivocal, positive and reiter
ated declaration that this is a gold
standard nation, that all our money
must be maintained at a par with gold,
and that it will be so maintained under
all circumstances. After reviewing the
history of our monetary legislation
since the war he takes up the existing
situation, and says:
"The evil of the present system is
found in the great cost to the govern
ment of maintaining the parity of our
different forms of money; that is,
keeping all of them at par with gold."
And again he says: "We have $900,000,
000 of currency which the government
by solemn enactment has undertaken
to keep at par with gold." And still
again he declares: "The government,
without any fixed gold revenue, is
pledged to maintain gold redemption,
which it- has 6teadily and faithfully
done, and which under the authority
now given it will continue to do."
After showing the lack of wisdom,
the folly, of selling bonds, and thereby
adding to our interest-bearing debt for
the purpose of redeeming over and
over again a noninterest-bearing debt
in the shape of United States notes,
the president makes the proposal here
tofore predicted in these columns. He
urges that when United States notes
are redeemed by the government in
gold they should be set apart, and only
paid out, if at all, in exchange for gold,
and he says that this is an obvious
duty. The president also concurs with
the secretary of the treasury in rec
ommending that national banks be al
lowed to issue notes to the face value
of the bonds which they have deposit
ed for circulation and recommends
that national banks be allowed to or
ganize on a capital of $25,000, in order
to benefit localities not now sufficiently
supplied with currency.
The president makes a very strong
point when he says that it is in times
of business tranquillity and freedom
from distrust that we should reform
our monetary laws, and that we should
not wait until danger again threatens
before we take up in congress this
very grave and important question. To
this there will be no dissenting voice,
and it is in accordance with the posi
tion which this newspaper has assumed
for many weeks.
Taken all in all, the president has
made good his pledge that he would
rot neglect the question of currency
reform, and after what he has said in
his message the country will look to
congress for a speedy relief from pres
ent evils in our monetary system.
Cincinnati Commercial Tribune.
THE AMERICAN POLICY.
Attitude
of the President on the
Cohan Question.
No American, whatever his party or
his prejudice with respect to Cuba may
be, can read the president's message
on the Cuban question without a thrill
of pride. Of all the slate papers that
have passed upon a problem that for
many years has embarrassed the gov
ernment of this country, we have not
seen one that is a better expression of
reason, cournge and patriotism.
The message is a warning and a re
buke to Spain, as well as an argument
addressed to congress. The president
does not harbor the sentimental theory
that we have no rights in the struggle
or that we would not be justified in
intervening should the professions of
the Spanish government prove false.
On the contrary, his whole argument
is based upon the theory that we have
both the moral and the legal right to
compel, peacefully, if possible, by force,
if force becomes necessary, the equita
ble and permanent adjustment of the
claims of the Cubans. But he insists
that this is a right that must be exer
cised with caution, with decency, with a
true respect for the rights of others
and for our own obligations under in
ternational law. And he sums up
the position of the governmen-t in a
passage of moving eloquence and dig
nity: "The nfar future will demonstrate
whether the Indispensable condition of a
righteous peace. Just alike to the Cubans
and to Spain, as well as equitable to all
our interests, so Intimately involved in the
welfare of Cuba, Is likely to be attained. If
not the exigency of further and other ac
tion by the United States will remain to be
taken. When that time comes that action
will be determined In the line of indisput
able right and duty. It will be faced, with
out misgiving or hesitancy In the light of
the obligation this government owes to
Itself, to the people who have confided to It
the protection of their interests and honor
and to humanity.
"Sure of the right, keeping free from all
offense ourselves, actuated only by UP'
right and patriotic considerations, moved
neither by passion nor selfishness, the
government will continue Its watchful care
over the rights and property or American
citizens and will abate none of Its efforts
to bring about by peaceful agencies a peace
which shall be honorable and enduring. If
it shall hereafter appear to be a duty Im
posed by our obligations to ourselves, to
civilization and humanity to Intervene with
force, it shall be without fault on our
Dart and only because the necessity of
such action will be so clear as to com
mand the support and approval of the
civilized world." .
Here is the true American policy-
without fear and without reproach. It
is health and sanity confronting the
fever of jingoism and the anaemia of
"peace at any price." It reassures the
people that whatever steps may be
taken for the relief of Cuba will be
taken honestly, openly and fearlessly,
"Sure of the right, keeping free from
offense ourselves, actuated only by up
right and patriotic considerations,
moved neither by passion or selfish
ness," the government can take no ac
tion that will not be cordially indorsed
by every American. Chicago Times-
Herald.

A SILVER I IE FALLACY.
What the Mexicanlxatlon of vs
Currency Would Dc.
One of our European consuls has re
ported that in Paris a syndicate has
been formed with a capital of two mil
lion Mexican dollars to establish a
large factory of shoes, boots, etc., In
Mexico. The work of construction will
be commenced at once, and the object
of the syndicate is to send an immense
quantity of shoes of cheap quality to
the American and European markets.
Commenting on this item, a free silver
organ says:
"There Is no occasion for them to stop at
'cheap shoes;' they can make the best with
equal profit to themselves.
"It Is a singular thing that our financiers
willfully shut their eyes to the prospective
ruin of all our manufacturing industries by
Mexico.
"So many of our newspapers and finan
ciers pretend to see no more In this silver
question than one of making our obliga
tions payable In a depreciated currency.
"That is not the issue at all.
"This difference In exchange, making a
Mexican price of $2.32 for our gold dollar,
will in time ruin every producer in the
United States.
"The question Is one of competition only.
And the only reason why Mexico and other
silver countries have not supplanted our
manufactories before this to an extent of
their extinction Is solely due to the lack of
education to that end In silver countries.
"In all else they are our masters, and can
at will drive out of the open market every
thing manufactured by gold nations."
All of which is bosh. The difference
in exchange has nothing to do with the
subject at all. The root of the matter
is, that in Mexico the wage rate is much,
lower than in the United States or in
Europe. There are thousands of people
in the United States who do not under
stand why a "dollar" in Mexico is not
as valuable as a "dollar" in the United
States, and until they recognize the dif
ference between value and price they
will fall into confusion.
The fall in the world's price of silver
since the early '70s has carried down
with it the purchasing power of the
Mexican dollar. Merchants there have
put up their prices to correspond with
its depreciation, while the rate of
wages has not risen in the same degree.
This is because of the ignorance of the
masses of the Mexican people. The re
sult is that Mexican laborers are work
ing for much lower wages, in reality,
than they were a dozen years ago. The
laborer gets a Mexican dollar for his
day's work, and who received a Mexi
can dollar for the same amount of work
ten years ago, receives about 30 cents
less actual wages than he did then.
This ignorance on the part of the peo
ple of that country is the secret of the
probable profits of the syndicate men
tioned. It can hire labor much cheaper
than in Europe or the United States.
There Is nothing in the "rate of ex
change" to make money for them. It
Is simply a question of the cost of
labor.
Were the United States so foolish ns
to adopt free coinnge, the drop in the
purchasing power of our dollar would
come at a bound, instead of being
spread over 24 years. Our money sys
tem would go to the silver standard. A
dollar then would buy only about 44
per cent, as much ns it will now. Every
laboring man would thus suffer an
actual reduction of about 46 per cent,
in his wages, and it would take a dozen
years to bring wages up to their pres
ent level. That is what the Mexicaniza
tion of our currency really means to
the laboring man. Toledo Blade.

ET'The Dingley tariff law Is getting

mated, were $90,348,000, which is about
$7,000,000 more than was brought in
by the Wilson-Gorman act during the
first four months of its operation. This
is a particularly good showing for the
present law, for the reason that im
porters held back to await the new and
lower Wilson-Gorman duties, while the
exact reverse was the case when the
Dingley act went into effect. The new
law will prove a good revenue raiser
when it has a fair chance. Troy Times.
C7Jo hear rne siiverttes talk one
would suppose that there had been a
general conspiracy of nations against
coining silver into money, and that the
United States was one of the Castilines
of It. The United States coined last
year over 21,000,000 silver dollars, and
enough subsidiary silver to bring the
total up to nearly $25,000,000. The,
world's coinage, as shown by Secretary
Gage, in bis annual report, was still
more remarkable, $153,395,740. The to
tal gold coinage of all the world during
the year was $195,899,517. Evidently all
ver is still a great money metal. Chi

C7The president is correct in the
opinion atttributed to him that if th
greenbacks were retired there would
be a howl of "contraction" from the
Bryanites, even though the extln
guished notes were replaced by bank
currency. In holding the redeemed
notes in the treasury, however, until
exchanged for gold nobody would have
a chance to say any currency was de
stroyed or locked np. Of course, unless
the revenues equaled the expenditures
the holding of redeemed greenbacks un
til gold was offered for them would
force the treasury, in meeting the gov
ernment's current expenditures, to pay
out gold instead of currency, but there
is some reason to expect that within
two or three months the revenues win
be ample. fit Louis Globe-Democrat.
THE FARMING WORLD.
CORN ON THE COB.
Some Reasons Why It Should Neves
lie Fed to Horses.
Corn on the cob should never be fed
to horses, as there is always a risk
of making them sick by doing so.
When corn on the cob is fed, unless a
horse's appetite is carefully noted and
just enough is given to him, he will
eat the cob also, and as the cob is more
or less indigestible there isabigchance
r,f making him sick and losing him.
In feeding a horse care should be taken
to give him just enough and no more,
too much being almost as bad as too
little.
I have just heard of an experienca
with a good horse which proves the
truth of what I have said. One of my
friends who has a negro hostler has
had trouble about keeping his horses
well and in good condition, owing to
the fact that if the hostler, for any
reason, lost his temper with one ol
the horses he gave that horse's break
fast, dinner or supper to another horse,
and when the stinted horse got his next
meal (for the negro was afraid to cut
him more than one meal at a time) he
would eat cobs as well as the corn.
One evening some time ago, when the
stock came in from work, one of the
horses was sick and it was found that
he had indigestion. A remedy was
given, and when after long work on
him the sick animal evacuated a great
number of pieces of cob as large as a
chestnut were found, which showed
conclusively the cause of the trouble.
Xo blame was attached to the hostler
at the time, but soon after another ne
gro who had a grudge against the ill
tempered hostler told how the horsei
were treated; investigation proved the
truth of the story and the hostler was
discharged. Since that time the horses
have been fed on shelled corn and there
has been no trouble, all of them keep
ing in perfect health and looking well.
It is some trouble and a slight ad
ditional expense to shell the corn foi
the horses, but it is better to do thii
than to have to sit up for hours with
a sick horse and perhaps lose him al
last. It is not, however, a creat deal
of trouble to me to shell my corn, as
i use ior this purpose a little corn
sheller with which one man can easily
shell a bushel of corn in ten minutes
or less. I paid three dollars for it. and
the work is so light and pleasant thai
the children on the place enjoy shelling
a large part of the corn used for the
horses. Cows can eat cobs without
danger, but horses cannot. A horse ia
a clean and choice animal and must be
more carefully treated than any othei
class of stock or he will not thrive.

Celery Is a Biennial.
Celery is ordinarily a biennial; thai
is to say, it requires two seasons to
come to maturity. In this habit it is
like the turnip, cabbage, carrot and
many other familiar plants, which form
a cluster of leaves and a strong root
during the first season's growth, live
over winter, and the following season
send up a seed stalk. After ripening its
seed the plant dies. The biennial habit
of growth is not absolutely fixed in the
case of celery, for the plants occasional
ly complete their growth in a single
season, from seed, and die.
Evergreens on the Farm.
The first consideration in planting
trees about farm buildings is to shelter
them from sun, wind and storm. The
need of shade in summer is generally
recognized, but too many planters over
lock the equal necessity for evergreens
ta protect from winter winds, and to
give a little color to the monotony of
winter landscapes. Evergreens pro

MISUNDERSTOOD.
Mr. Casey Was Not Up to Polite
Parlance.
Madge Casey threw herself with wild
abandon on luxurious Turkish divan in the
magnificent drawing-room of the palatial
brown stone mansion owned by her father,
the wealthy but honest politician. Madge's
amiable mother had just given her a good
scolding for being out so late the previous
night with that "spalpane av a MoikeCassi
dy, who niver intinded gettin' married," so
the rebellious daughter entered the above
mentioned room for the purpose of having a
good cry.
Ten minutes afterward her father en
tered, and seeing the pride of his heart in
tears, said soothingly: "Arrah, Madgy, me
darlint; phwat's th cause av all this grafe?"
"Oh, papa," replied the beautiful girl, be
tween gulps, "I'm bemoaning my fate.'
"Bemoanin' yer fate, eh? Thin it sorves

CAUSE FOR ALARM.
How baldness begins.
How to prevent it.
Every person, male or female, shrinks
from baldness. It adds to the appearance
Cf age aod is a serious discomfort. The
cases are rare when the falling out of the
hair may not be stopped, and a new and
healthy growth of the hair promoted. The
hair grows in the scalp like a plant in the
soil. If a plant flourishes, it must have
constant attention: it must be watered
regularly and find its food in the soil
where it is rooted. It's so with the hair.
Neglect is usually the beginning of bald
ness. Dandruff is allowed to thicken on
the scalp. The hair begins to loosen. The
scalp loses its vitality. The hair, insuf
ficiently nourished, begins to fade and to
tall. The instant need in such a case is
some practical preparation which, sup-
plying the needed nourishment to the
scalp, will feed the hair, give it strength,
and so produce a strong and healthv
growth. All this is done by Dr. Ayer's
Hair Vigor, the most practical and valua
ble preparation for the hair that can be
obtained. It tones np the scalp, does away
with dandruff, stops the hair from falling,
testores the original color to gray or faded

they will try to save the tooth, though many leave
even this too late. They comfort themselves with

they cannot replace their internal organs !
