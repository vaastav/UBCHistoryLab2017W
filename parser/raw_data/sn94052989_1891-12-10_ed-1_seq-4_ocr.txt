MlttAD OF UECIrr.UITIY.
Mr. Blame appears to have set a fashion
which the nations of Europe are following
one after another. Austria has concluded
reciprocity treaties with several of her
neighbors, and Spain is preparing an al
terrative tariff, with one set of dutie3 for
nations which admit Spanish products free
of duty or at low duties, and another for
nations which tax Spanish products with a
view to their exclusion. This is the logical
outcome of the tariff war wnicb first broke
oat in Europe thirteen years aco. and into
which all the nations of that continent were
drawn one after the other. It would have I
nome sooner or later under any circum
stances, but the recent treaty negotiated by
the Government at Washington with the
Government at Madrid, following on the
heels of the recent treaty with Brazil, un
doubtedly precipitated matters.
It is now announced in the message that
the outlines of a new treaty with Germany
have been agreed upon establishing recipro
cal tariffs in regard to a numbar of articles
which the United Slates exchange with
Germany, aud notably continuing to admit
German sugar to the benefit of the McKin
fey Tariff Act on condition th it the Impe
rial Eaichstadt reduces by about one-half
the duties on American cereals. The ad
va:i!s;T- of the treaty will seem to be rather
on the side oi Germany. The United State 3
is to an extent interested in extending their
markets for cereals, but it Is vital to Ger
ninny to get a market into which she can
dump her surplus of sugar. For several
years Germany has been making more re
fined sugar than she could market at a price
which left a profit over and above the cost
of production, She has been more than
once compelled to sell refined sugar in Lon
don as low as three* cent 3. If the Industry
had been let alono the evil would have cor
rected Itself by a reduction in the number
and capacity of the German refineries. Un
der the operation of the new treaty produc
tion will probably be kept up, and the bur
plus will come to this country. But the ef
fect of that will be to reduce the price of
sugar to the American consumer, and for
' this boon vte should be thankful.
A new treaty with France, on the line of
the treaties with .Spain and Germany, will
next be in order. France has for some time
been sacrificing the interests of her working
class for the benefit of her land-owners.
Power now resides in the rural constitu
encies, which are jealous of the cities. They
insist on laws which, while seeming to seek
to advantage the peasantry, really only
benefit the great land-owners. Unfor
tunately for them this year's short crou has
given point to the complaint ot the work- I
ingmen in cities, and the Government's hand
is forced. It bosun to take the back track
OH the pork question; the question of for
eign cereals cannot long be delayed. On
both the Government at Washington will
be prepared to meet them, and the end will
■ probably be a revision of our reciprocal
tariff. There will be some obstacles in the
way, the chief of which will be in the selec
tion of French products that may be ad
mitted at lower duties without injury to our
industries. The bulk of our importations
from France consist of cloths, silks and
dress goods; and these the 'Government at
Washington would not include in a reci
procity arrangement.
The people of Canada appear to be very
anxious to fall into line, and to negotiate a
reciprocity treaty on the lines of the treaty
which was in forte lorty years ago. Their
wishes do not seem to meet with much re
sponse at Washington, representatives of
the northern tier of States do not appear
to be solicitouTlo divide their home market
with the Canadians, and a certain school of
politicians, which views annexation as
Canada's manifest destiny, are of the opinion
that reciprocity would retard that consum
mation. The President's message will shed
on this subject a light which it needs.
II W IUE SILVEI: LAW WOIiKS.
While the price of silver hat not advanced
' as wag expected under tbe present law, the
I'resiuent thinks it should be given further
trial. He accounts for the depression id
silver bullion partly by. the falling off in
the exports from London to India and partly
to increased production. Tin: export.-) of
silver bullion last year were but 813,707,391.
against an average for ten years of 517.000,
--000. The amount purchased by the Govorn
•iient m more than 10,000,000 in excess of
ti.e domestic product after allowing for the
btilliou and iv the arts. The President does j
n. t regard free coinage with favor at least
until the present law has been thoroughly
tested. __^______^__
THE NOUTHKUN CITBCS KELT.
A no: thorn daily having commented
favorably upon the coming citrus fair at
Auburn, the Los Angeles. Citizen takes ex
ception to the comment, and. after some as
persion of the quality of northern citrus
fruits, says:
A3 la quantity, the (northern) editor knows
veiy well that there are more oranges grown ou
a u n-acre lot In Southern California than In the
entire northern citrus belt.
It is a well-known fact that by far the
greater part of California's citrus croD
conies from the southern part of the State,
only about one-sixth as much fruit being
raised in the north as there. Notwithstand
ing fiis, however, the extravagant claim of
the Citizen is hardly borne out by the facts.
There are to-day in the northern citrus
belt some 30.000 orange and lemon trees in
full hearing. Even allowing all that Is
claimed for Southern California's remark
able soil and wonderful climate, it can
hardly be seriously maintained that ten
acres there will bear as much fruit as 3000
acres' here.
There are many portions of Northern
California where oranges will not grow, at
least to be worth cultivating, ami doubtless
there are similar places in the south. As to
quality, it is with us here as it ii also in the
south — some sections produce excellent
fruit, others produce such as is not worth
the picking. We have eaten oranges grown
in Alaueda, Stanislaus and Yuba counties
that seemed in all respects equal to tha fine
products of Riverside. Such are not yet
to be found here in car-load lots. Car-load
lots of oranges of any quality are. but just
beginning to be shipped from Northern Cal
ifornia, but there is a growing demand for
what we have, and the quantity is Increas
ing of our citrus fruits, while at the sania
time the quality is improving. While we
have as yet but 30,000 bearing trees, there
are fully 200,000 trees not yet come to bear
ing in the northern belt.
The last northern citrus fair, at Oroville,
fully demonstrated that this new industry
has made rapid progress in the north, and
there can be no doubt but that the coining
exhibit at Auburn will show still greater
advance, and that our northern growers will
be able to show some fruit comparing very
favorably with southern products.
THE MKSSAtiK ON FIIKEIUN POLICY.
There is little Id the President's message
on our relations with foreign powers that
has tlie merit of novelty. Thanks to the
newspapers and to the enterprise of inter
viewers diplomacy lias now no secret-.
Everything that is done or said between
nations is public property from the s;art.
Thus the nrgotiatious on tlie Bearing
question, on the Canadian boundary, on the
exclusion of American pork from the conti
nental countries <>[ Europe, on the lynching
affair at New Orleans, on the Chilean out
rages, on the case of the ltata, on the Mexi
can treaty, on tlie Pan-American Confer
ence, aro all twice-told tales to the average
newspaper reader; for points that are new
ho will have to refer to those passages in
the message which refer to Russia, Guiana,
Chin >, and the -late of tlie law touching the
status of foreigners in this country.
The paragraph which deals with the effect
of 1; ssian anti-Semitic legislation on immi
gration into this country presents views
which are striking anil new. The President
says that the new Russian orders of exile
issued against tlie Jews will have the effect
of ll odiug this country with a million Rus
sian Jews within a few years. These people
will come here, for the most part, without
money, without knowledge of dut language,
and with at a mechanical trade. They can
not but find it difficult to earn a living here,
and they must crowd the lab>r nmrket, .so
as to impair the living of the working cla«s
that is now in the country. The President
puts it to the Kir.peror whether this is fair
to the United States, and whether it is wise
to provoke retaliatory legislation by Con
gress looking to the exclusion of l: :-- an
refugees. '1 his Is a point of view iv which
the subject has not hitherto been considered
at st. Petersburg. It may lead to serious
reflection.
The paragraph which refers to the dis
pute between (ireat Britain and Venezuela
over tlie boundary of Uritish Guiana does
not contain any new statements of fact, but
its references to tlie application of the Mon
roe doctrine to the pending controversy ar«i
rrwre pointed than former Presidential
messages have been. The simple fact is
that Great Britain, relying upon hor su
perior strength, has encroached upan the
territory of Venezuela and occupies a lari,'o
tract thereof, including some valuable cold
mines, in spite of the protest of the weaker
nation; and the question which arises is
whether the Monroe doctrine does not re
quire the Unit 4 States to insist upon the
appointaieut of a commission to delimit
tue disputed frontier. The controversy is
not new; it was in existence twelve years
ago; but President Harrison now 9>iys it is
time it were closed. In that opinion the
American people will a,;ree with him, the
more readily because everybody realizes
that England would tiot light for a slice of
Venezuela.
In regard to China, the President finds
fault with the Government at Pi-king for
refusing to receive Mr. Blair. Nothing is
better settled by law aud usage than that a
nation has a right to refuse to receive a
diplomatic agent who. iv the language of
the old writers, i 3 persona non grata. It
was in reliance on that doctrine that Gen
eral Grant declined to recognize M. Cata
cazy as Minister from Russia, after he had
made himself offensive at Washington, and
that Austria refused to receive the person
whom Air. Cleveland had appointed ilin
ister to Vienna.
The President's suggestion that offenses
against the persons of foreigners, citizens ol
countries with which the United .states
h vi! treaties, should be triable in United
States courts will command general ap
proval. As the law now stands, if a citizen
owes money to a foreigner the latter may
sue iv the United .States courts. But if a
citizen kills a foreigner the .Stite courts
have exclusive jurisdiction over the case.
This appears to involve an incongruity. A
treaty concluded by the Government of the
United .States is the law of the land, and the
Government is bound to execute it lik« any
other law ; but if its execution must be con
fided to State courts, it will he evaded when
ever popular passion or prejudice is roused
against a particular nationality. This places
the Government in the position of being un
able to fuilill its treaty obligations and of
having to confess the fact to the foreiya
world.
We may see differently in the law if
turned against ourselves in the pending con
troversy with Chile. In that affair a Val
paiaso mob killed nnd wounded a uumher
of American sailors. Mr. Harrison de
manded satisfaction. To that the Chileans
replied that the criminal courts of Valpa
raiso had exclusive jurisdiction over the
alleged crime nnd that they were investigat
ing the nintter. The Washlngt* n authorities
retorted, In substance, thut they had noth
ing to do with the courts at Valparaiso;
American citizens had been killed and they
insisted on their demand for reparation. To
that contention Chile has u*de 110 reply and
the case rests there. In the present state of
public feeling at Valparaiso it is possible
that the courts may find that the Americans
were the aggressors in the matter and thnt
Uie police killed thrtm in self-defenae.
HIIM-i. IMMIGRATION.
The President calls allflntton to tlin difH
culties attending tha enforcement of the
Chinese restriction laws under the existing
conditions. Canada, lie says, admits Chi
nese on payment of a per capita tax of SSO,
which is often paid with tlie intention of
evading tlie American law asaitist Chinese
iuiniigraiinn. The Chinese cross tho border,
and, if arrested and sent b:ick, may recros* at
l'lcu-ure. The I'residi-nt advises legislation
which will put a siod to these practices.
Wliile the l-'resident makes no suggestion
as to the nature of the desired legislation,
it will occur to a gool many peo
ple that the remedy lieu with the
Executive Department of the Govern
ment. The Canadian law which admits
Chinese on payment of a par capita tax
may falrlv bn considered, unfriendly legi3
-latinn. WIiIIh we cannot demand of Can
ada a repeal of the law, we Ban make It
Canada's interest to repeal it. Canadian
railroads are now enjoying privileges indis

[ Government. While the Canadian railroads
might not like to relinquish so profitable
a truffle as importing Chinese for American
consumption, they would, perhaps, rather
submit to this loss than to the lu-s of tlio
right tocarry goods through Canadain bond. I
THE NICARAGUA CAJiAI..
' There will probably be some diversity of
opinion as to the President's recommenda
tion that the Government indorse the bonds
of the Nicaragua Canal Company to tin 1 ex
tent that may be necessary to insure the
early completion of the canal. Objections
will arise principally from the fact that the
Government's experience as an indorser has
not been of a nature to wnrrant a continu
ance in that policy. .The fact remains, how
ever, that the opening of a waterway be
tween the two oceans is a necessity so im
perative that the withholding of aid by the
Government would only cause a little delay
and a considerable increase in the cost of
the work. The Nicaragua company will
eventually get the required capital, but may
have to pay a largo bonus for it. A guar
anty of the bonds by the Government would
secure all the money needed and at the low
est current rate of interest. It is not diffi
cult to imagine emergencies in which the
canaj would be worth to the Government
twice what it will co3t. While the rule not
to lend the Government credit to private
corporations is a.gooJ one to hold fast to, an
exception was made in the aid given to the
first continental railroad, and may be made
Bg*ln a quarter of a century later in con
necting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It
may be laid alto in behalf of this enterprise
that them are no other oceans on the conti
nent to connect. The completion of the
Nicaragua Canal on a basis of cost with tolls
as low as the Cost of the service will warrant
will give along rest to other projects for
connecting the two oceans. Private capital
I would be re I ant to go into competing en-
I terprises whether by water or by land.
STANDS BY TIIK TAIIIFF.
The President stands by the present
tariff. He declares that there is no reason
why he should not. It has disappointed
the evil prophecies of its opponents and in a
large measure realized the hopeful predic
tions of its friends. A day's labor will buy
more now than at almost any other period
in the history of the country. The volume
of foreign trade has Increased more than
8100,000,000 over the preceding year. Kx
ports for the year ending September ."''th
were $923,091,136, against $960,177,115 for
the preceding year. One of the objections
urged against the McKlniey bill was that it
would reduce tbe volume of foreign com
merce. One of our imaginative conteinpo
riries drew a picture of the port of San
l-'rauciscii a> it would appear after the Mc-
Kinli-y tariff got fairly at w rk. In respect
to the revenue the tariff seems to have
worked equally well. Tiie total revenues

wen- (458,514,233 03, expenditures 8421,304,
--■ITo 4ii, leaving a surplus of 137,239,763 (17.
It appears, therefore, that the surplus ttiat
gave Mr. Cleveland so much uneasiness has
not entirely disappeared.

fatnom deep, the Miicide theory may not bj
tenable.
A bullet was also found, and this gave rise to
the belief that the nun must have been mur
dered. There was no hole In Hie skull, and If
killed by Hie bullet, It must liavo le.iclud some
other vital part. .
About two yean ago, or perhaps a little longer,

■nuie than prubabie that ihe true blaloiy of the
case Mill never be revealed.
SUICIDE IS THE PARK.
A call was also made at (..olden (Jate Park to
bung in ■ man who bad Deeu found dead In that
pleasure-ground. As Ihe first rays of the rising
sun, it v attended to business yesterday, were
glinting alone the green sward, making each
l)!.(ii* Dash with prismatic gleam's, caused by the
lam-drops dinging to It. an old man, who goes
under the sobriquet of "Mushroom Pete," due
to his occupation as a mushroom-gatherer, while
seeking the delectable fungi, made a ghastly
discovery.
II- noticed something lying near I.one Tree,
which Is just south of the newly bnlhllOK lake.
He approached, and to his lioriltied gaze was
presented the figure of a man lyiiig at lull length
upon the grass, bis sightless eyes staring stonily
up to the Dine ski ■•<. Ins hair lyinu to a tangled*
disordered, malted mass, damp from the rain of
Ihe night before, while some of lux life's blood
still discoloied his light temple, and a closer in
spection revealed a small, round and blackened
bole.
A REVOLVER is hand.
At his side and si ill touched by ills hand was a
revolver with which Hie life bad been taken, and
a f w feet distant was the dead mill's derby hat,
which lie had probably removed ere firing Ibe
fatal Shot. Ills clothe* weie thoroughly snaked
with Ibe rain, and In ail probability the body had
been llieit- all night long.
Who lie was and when lie bad entered the park
no one was able to say. Tlieie was nothing
about him to rive a clew to the cause of (be act
it It was a suicide. A dun.' was lound under
neath him, while in his rain-soaked purse was
discovered So 75 and a beer chock. No letter,
no paper, nor anything to tell who he was. The
revolver was an ordinary American bulldog of
32-callber, such as can be seen iv all second-hand
and i awn shops.
IDENTIFIED AS A CONSUMPTIVE.
When placed upon the slab In the .Morgue the
usual crowd of inorbioly curious people thronged
the iilacn and late in Hut evening some German
waiters recognized and Ueuillled the body as
that of diaries ltaumterser, a waiter leading
on Mission street, near Third, a native of Uer
tnauy and. 11) years of ace. He was a consump
tive and only weighed about 100 pounds al
though of medium height. It Is thought lie be
cam- despondent about Ins decline from tin- dis
