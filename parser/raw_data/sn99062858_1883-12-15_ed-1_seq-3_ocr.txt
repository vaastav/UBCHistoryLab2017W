with the governments of those countries. lur
Ing the year then' have been jierfeeted
and pr*ictaim*d a eon.sular auil commer

treaty with Koumnnia thus extending
our "intercourse with the Panubian ooiiiitriws,
while our eastern relations have lieen placed up
on a wider basis ly treaties with Corea anil Mada
gascar. The new (xnni'liirv survey treaties with
Mexico, the trades mark convention and a
supplementary treaty of extradition with Spain,
and a convention extending the titration of the
Franco American claims of commission have
also l«H*n proclaimed.

congress create a commission to consider the
question of our rights in the fisheries, and the
means of op«ningto our citizens, iimli" just and
enduring conditions, the richly stocked fish

North America. The question has arisen
touching the de|Mirtation of the 1'nited Slates
from the British Islands by the government or

a living and equally a burden on the community

The rapid influx of our capital and enterprise lute
that country, shows by what Itus already Itecn ac

of ]H|.H has lieen terminated by the Mexican
government. The alisence of

now depend tipoii the domestic Matus of tha I
republic. There have be*-!! instances of harsh
enforcement of the laws against our vessels and
Citizens in Mexico, and of tlie denial of diplomatic
resort for their protection. The initial step to
ward a I letter understanding, has lieen taken in

In a communication to congress at its last ses

lieen enacted by which the annual tax and tariff
receipts of the government have been cut down to
tiie extent of at least fifty or sixty millions of dol
lars. hile I have no doubt thai still farther re
ductions may lie wisely made. I do not advise the
adoption at this session of any measures for large
diminution of national revenues. Tlie results of
the legislation of the late session of congress have

A jK.rtjon at least of this surplus revenue may
