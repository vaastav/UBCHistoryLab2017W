Washinotox, Dec. 7. The following
fa the president's message to congress:
To the Conges of the United States: As
representative of the ieople In the legisla
tive branch of their government you have
assembled at a time when the strength and
excellence of our free Institutions and the
fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule
have been ap;aln made manifest. Apolitical
contest involving momentous consequences,
fraught with feverish apprehension and
creating aggressiveness so intense as to ap
proach bitterness and passion, has been
w aged throughout our land and determined
by the decree of free and independent suf
frage, without disturbance of our tran
quility or the least sign of weakness In our
national structure.
When we consider these incidents and
contemplate the peaeeful obedience and
manly submission which have succeeded a
heated clash of political opinions we dis
cover abundant evidence of a determination
on the part of countrymen to abide by every
verdict of the popular will and to be con
trolled at all times by an abiding faith in the
agencies established for the direction of the
affairs of their government Thus our peo
ple exhibit a patriotic disposition which en
titles them to demand of those who under
take to make and execute their laws such
faithful and unselfish service in their behalf
as can only be prompted by a serious appre
ciation of the trust and confidence which the
acceptance of public duty invites.
In obedience to a constitutional require
ment, I herein submit to the Congress cer
tain Information concerning national af
fairs, with the suggestion of such legislation
as In my Judgment is necessary and expe
dient To secure brevity and avoid tiresome
narration, I shall omit many details con
cerning matters within federal control,
which, though by no means unimportant,
arc more profitably discussed in depart
mental reports. I shall also further curtail
this communication by omitting a minute
recital of many minor incidents connected
with our foreign relations which have here
tofore found a place in executive messages,
but are now contained in a report of the
Secretary of state, which U herewith
submitted.
At the outset of a referenc to the n i
Important matters affecting our relations
sMth foreign jiowers. it would afford me sat
isfaction If I could assure the Congress that
the disturbed condition in Asiatic Turkey
had during the past year assumed a less
hideous and bloody aspect, and that either
as a consequence of the awakening of
the Turkish government to the demands
of humane civilization or as the
result of decisive action on the
part of the great nations having the right
by treaty to interfere for the protection of
those exposed to the rage of mere bigotry
nd cruel fanaticism, the shocking features
of the situation had been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcoming a softened
position or protective intervention, we
lave U-cn afflicted by continued and not un
frequent reports of the wanton destruction
of home and the bloody butchery of men.
women and children, made martvrs to their
profession of Christian faith. While none
of our citizens In Turkey have thus far been
killed or wounded, though often in the midst
of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety in
the future is by no means assured. Our
government at home and our minister at
Constantinople have left nothing undone to
protect our missionaries in Ottoman terri
tory, who constitute nearly all the Individ
uals residing there who have a right to
claim our protection on the score of Amer
ican citizenship.
Our efforts in this direction will not be re
laxed, but the deep feeling and sympathy
that have leen aroused among our people
ought not to so far blind their reason and
judgment as to lead them to demand impos
sible things. The outbreaks of blind fury
which led to murder end pillage In Turkey
occur suddenly and without notice, and an
attempt on our part to force such a hostile
presence there as might be effective for pre
vention or protection would not only be re
sisted by the Ottoman government, but
would be regarded as an Interruption of
their plans tc. the great nations who assert
their exclusive right to Intervene In their
own time and method for the security of
life and property In Turkey.
Several naval vessels are stationed In the'
Mediterranean as a measure of caution and
to furnish all possible relief and refuge in
case of emergency. We have claims against
the Turkish government for the pillage and
destruction of missionary property at Har
pool and Marash during uprisings at those
places. Thus far the validity of these de
mands has not been admitted through our
minister. lrior to such outrages and in an
ticipation of danger we demanded pro.ection
for the persons and property of our mission
ary citizens in the localities mentioned,
and notwithstanding that evidence exists of
actual complicity of Turkish soldiers In the
work of destruction and robbery. The facts
as they now appear do not permit us to doubt
the Justice of these claims, and nothing will
be omitted to bring about their pro.-r.pt set
tlement A number of Armenian refugees
having arrived at our ports, an -order has
lately been obtained from the Turkish gov
ernment permitting tlx wives and children
of such refugees to Juiu them here. It is
hoped that hereafter ; , obstacle will be in
terposed to prevent ihe escape ot all those
who seek to avoid the perils which threaten
thera in Turkish dominions.

.y.nnlnatlon of Spain to put down the lnsur-
icmuii ffrius uui io strengtnen with the
lapse i4Ume, and isjevldenced by her un
hesitating devotion of largely increased
military and naval forces to the task, there.,
is much reason to believe that the insur
gents have gained in point of numbers and
character and resources, and are none the
less inflexible in their resolve not to succumb
without practically securing the great pro
jects for which they took up arms. If Spain
has not yet re-established her authority,
neither have the insurgents yet made good
their title to be regarded as an independent
state. Indeed, as the contest has gone on,
the pretense that civil government exists on
the island, except so far as Spain Is able tc
maintain it. has been practically abandoned.
Spain does keep on foot such a govern
ment, more or less imperfectly. In the large
towns and their Immediate suburbs. But
that exception being made, the entire coun
try is either given over to anarchy or La
subject to the military occupation of one or
the other party. It is reported, indeed, on
reliable authority that at the demand of
the commander-in-chief of the insurgent
army, the pfitative Cuban government has
now given up all attempt to exercise its
functions, leaving that government confes
sedly (what there is the best reason for sup
posing it always to have been in fact) a gov
ernment merely on paper.
Were the Spanish armies able to meet
their antagonists in the open, or in pitched
battle, prompt and decisive results might be
looked for, and the Immense superiority of
the Spanish forces In numbers, discipline
and equipment, could hardly fail to tell
greatly to their advantage. But they arc
called upon to face a foe that shuns general
engagements, that can choose and does
choose its own ground, that from the nature
of the country is visible or Invisible at
pleasure, and that fights only from am
buscade and when all the advantages of po
sition and numbers are on its side. In a
country where all that is indispensible to
life In the way of food, clothing and shelter
is so easily obtainable especially by those
born and bred on the soil, it Is obvious that
there is hardly a limit to the time during
which hostilities of this sort may be pro
longed. Meanwhile as in all cases of pro
tracted civil strife, the passions of the com
batants grow more and more inflamed and
excesses on both sides are more frequent
and more deplorable.
They also are participated in Ty bands o '
marauders, who, now in the name of oi-.f
party and now in the name of the other, a3
may best suit the occasion, harass the coun
try at will and plunder its wretched inhrtb
Hants for their own advantage. Such a
condition of things would inevitably entail
immense destruction of property even if it
were the policy of both parties to prevent it
as far as practicable. But while such
seemed to be the original policy of the Span
ish government It has now apparently
abandoned it, and is acting upon the same
theory as the insurgents, namely that the
exigencies of the contest require the whole
sale annihilation of property, that it may
not prove of use and advantage to the ene
my. It is to the same end that In pursuance
of general orders, Spanish garrisons are
now being withdrawn from plantations and
the rural population required to concentrate
itself in the towns.
The sure result would seem to be that the
Industrial value of the island is fast dimin
ishing and that unless there Is a speedy and
radicai change In existing conditions, it will
soon disapi)ear altogether. That value con
sists very largely, of course, in its capacity
to produce sugars a capacity already much
reduced by interruptions to tillage which
have taken place during the last two years.
It Is reliably asserted that should these in
terruptions continue during the current
year, and prtictically extend, as is now
threatened, to the entire sugar producing
territory of the island, so much time and so
much money will be required to restore the
land to its normal productiveness that it is
extremely doubtful if capital can be induced
to even make the attempt
The spectacle of the utter ruin of an ad
Joining country by nature, one of the most
fertile and charming on the globe, would
engage the serious attention of the govern
ment and people of the United States under
any circumstances. In ioint of fact, they
have a concern with it w hich is by no means
of a wholly sentimental or philanthropic
character. It lies so near to us as to be
hardly separated from our country. Our
actual pecuniary interest in it is second
only to that of the people and government
of Spain. It is reasonably estimated that
at least from f30.UO0,00( to J50,0iJ0,0.) of
capital is invested in plantations, in rail
road, mining and other business enter
prises on the island. The volume of trade
between the United States and Cuba, which
in 188'J amounted to about J64.00O.0OO. rose
in 1893 to about $103,000,000. and in 1894,
the year before present insurrection broke
out, amounted to nearly $96,000,000. Be
sides this larg.; pecuniary interest staked In
the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds
itself inextricably involved In the present
contest in other ways both vexatious and
costly.
Many Cubans reside in this countrv, and
indirectly promote the insurrection through"
the press by public meetings, by the pur
chase and shipment of arms, by the raising
of funds, and by other means which the
spirit of our institutions and the tenor of
our laws do not permit to be made the sub
ject of criminal prosecution. Some of them,
though Cubans at heart and in all their feel
ings and interests, have taken out papers as
naturalized citizens of the United States, z
proceeding resorted to with a view to pos
sible protection by this government, and
not unnaturally regarded with much indig
nation by the country of their origin. The
insurgents are undoubtedly encouraged an.3
supported by the widespread sympathy of
the people of this country always instinct
ively felt for every struggle for better and
freer government and which loathe case of
the more adventurous and restless elements
of our population, leads in only too many
instances to active and personal participa
tion In the contest
The result is that this government is con
stantly called upon to protect American cit
izens, to claim damages for injuries to per
sons and property, now estimated at manv
millions f dollars, and to ask explanations
and apologies for the acts or Spanish offi
cials whose zeal for the -repression of rebellion-sentiments
blinds them to the immun
ities belonging to the unoffending citizens
of a friendly iower.
It follows from the same causes that the
United States is compelled to actively police
a long line of sea coast against unlawful ex
peditions, the escape of which the utmost
vigilance will not alwavs suffice to prevent
These inevitable entanglements ol the
United States with the rebellion in Cuba,
the large American property interests af
fected and considerations of philanthropy
and humanity in general, have led to a ve
hement demand in various quarters for
some sort of positive intervention on the
part of the United States It was at first
proposed that belligerent rights should be
accorded to the insurgents, a proposition no
longer urged because untimely and in prac
tical ope ration c learly perilous and in j urious
to our own Interests. It has c(T-.r- i. -,,..
rs now sometimes contended that the Inde
pendence or me insurgents should be recog
nized, but imperfect or restricted as the
Spanish gsvernment of the island may be,
no other exists there, unless the will of the
military officer in temporary command cf a
particular district can be dignified as a
species of government It is now also sug
gested that the United States should buy the'
island, a suggestion possibly worthv of con
sideration if there were any evidence of a
desire or willingness on the part of Spain to
entertain such a proposal, it is urges,
finally, that all other methods failing, the
existing Internecine strife In Cuba should be
terminated by our intervention, even at the
cost of a war between the United States and
Spain a war which its advocatesconfldentl
prophecy could be neither large In its pro
portions nor doubtful in its issue. The cor
rectness of this forecast need be neither
affirmed nor denied. The United States has

Ive. That our conduct towards Spain and
her dominions has constituted no exception
to this national disposition is made manifest
by the course of our government not only
thus far during the present insurrection, but
during the ten years that followed the rising
at Yara in 1868. No other great power, il
may safely be said, under circumstances ol
similar perplexity, would have manifested
the same restraint and the same patient en
durance. It may also be said that thiJ fvrsistent at- I
tltude of the United States towards Spain in
connection with Cuba will unquestionably
evince no slight respect and "regard foi
Spain on the part of the American people.
They in truth do not forget her connection
with the discovery of the Western hemis
phere, nor do they underestimate the great
qualities of the Spanish people, nor fail to
fully recognize their splendid patriotism
and their chivalrous devotion to the national
honor. They view with wonder and admira- I
tion the cheerful resolution with which vast i
bodies of men are sent across thousands ol
miles of ocean and an enormous debt accum
ulated, that the costly position of the gem ol
the Antilles may still hold its place in th
opanisn crown. Ana yet neither the govern
ment nor the people of the United States
have shut their eyes to the course of events
in Cuba or have failed to realize the exist
ence of conceded irripvanrcs whirh Tiutta
to the present revolt from the authority of
Spain, grievances recognized by the Queen
Regent and by the Cortes, voiced by the
most patriotic and enlightened of Spanish .
statesmen, without regard to party, reinon- j
strated by reforms proposed by the execu- ;
tive and approved by the legislative branch j
of the Spanish- government
It is in the assumed temper and disposl- I
tion of the Spanish government to remedy
these grievances, fortified by indie: nis oi
influential public opinion in Spain, that this
government has hoped to discover the most
promising and effective means of composing
the present strife, with honor and advan
tage to Spain and with the achievement of
all the reasonable objects of the insurrec- I
tion. 1
It would seem that if Spain would offer to
Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home
rule which, while preserving the sover
Mrnity of Spain, would satisfy all rational
requirements of her Spanish subjects, there
should be no Just reason why the pacifica
tion of the island might not be effected on
that basis. Such a result would appear to
be in the true Interest of all concerned. It
would at once stop the conflict which is now
Consuming the resources of the klanil an.1
making it worthless for whichever party
may ultimately prevail. It would keep in
tact the possessions of Spain without touch
ing her honor, which will be consulted
rather than impugned by the adequate re
dress of admitted grievances. It would put
the prosperity of the Island and the fortunes
of its inhabitants within their own control,
without severing the natural and ancien
ties which bind them to the mother country,
and would yet enable them to test their ca
pacity for self government under the most
favorable conditions.
It has been objected on the one side that
Spain should not promise autonomy until
her insurgent subjects lay down their arms.
On the other side, that promised autonomy,
however liberal, is insufficient, because
without assurance of the promise being ful
filled. But the reasonableness of a requirement
by Spain, of unconditional surrender on the
part of the Insurgent Cubans before their
autonomy is-eonceded is not altogether ap
parent. It ignores Important features of
the situation the stability two years' dura
tion has given to the insurrection; the feas
ibility of its prolongation in the nature of
things, and as shown by past experience the
utter and imminent ruin of the island.unless
the present strife is speedily composed;
above all, the rank abuses which all parties
in Spain, all branches of her government
and all her leading public men concede to
exist and profess a desire to remove. Facing
sucn circumstances, to wlthold the proffer
of needed reforms until the parties demand
ing them put themselves at mercy by throw
ing down their arms, has the appearance of
neglecting the gravest of perils and inviting
suspicion as to the sincerity of any pro
fessed willingness to grant reforms. The
objection on behalf of the insurgents that
promised reform canot be relied upon must
of course be considered, though we have no
right to assume, and no reason for assum
ing, that anything Spain undertakes to do
for the relief of Cuba will not be done ac
cording to both the spirit and the letter of
the undertaking.
Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions
and precautions on the part of the weaker
of two combatants are always natural and
not always unjustifiable, being sincerely de
sirous in the interest of both as well as on
Its own account, that the Cuban problem
should be solved with the least possible de
lay, it was intimated by this government to
the government of Spain some monttis ago
that if a satisfactory measure of home rule
were tendered the Cuban insurgents, and
would be accepted by them upon a guaranty
of Its execution, the United States would en
deavor to find a way not objectionable to
Spain of furnishing such guaranty. v'hile
no definite response to this intimation has
yet been received from the Spanish .wovrn
ment. it is believed to be not altogetae- un
welcome, while, as already suggested, no
reason Is perceived why it should not btr ap
proved by the insurgents, neither partv can
fail to see. the importance of earlv action
and both must realize that to prolong the
present state of things for even a short
period will add enormously to the time and
labor and expenditure necessary to bring
about the industrial recuperation of the
island. It is. therefore, fervently hoped
on all grounds that earnest efforts for head
ing the breach between Spain and the in
surgent Cubans, upon the lines above indi
cated, may be. at once inaugurated and
pushed to an immediate successful issue.
The friendly offices of the United States,
either in the manner above outlined or in
any other way consistent with our constitu
tion and laws will always be at the disposal
of either party.
Whatever circumstances may arise, our
policy and our Interests would constrain u
to obtect to the acquisition of the island or
an interference with its control by any other.
It should be added that it cannot be reason,
ably assumed that the hitherto expectant
Ittitude of the United States will be indefi
nitely maintained.
While we are anxious to accord all due re
pect to the sovereignty of Spain, we cannot
new the pending conflict in all its features
nd properly apprehend our inevitable rela
tions to it and its possible results without
considering that by the course of events we
may be drawn into such an unusual anc un
precedented condition as will fix a m-t to
our patient waiting for Spain to end the
conflict, either alone and in her own way,
or with our friendly co-operation.
When the inability cf Spain to deal suc
cessfully with the insurrection has become
manifest and it is demonstrated that her
wvereignty is extinct in Cuba for all pur
poses of its rightful existence, and when a
hopeless struggle for its re-establishment
has degenerated into a strife which means
nothing more than the nseless sacrifice ol
Human life and then utter destruction of the
very subject matter of the conflict, actua
tion will ix presented in which our obliga
tions to the sovereignty of Spain will be
.uperseded by higher obligations which we
:an hardly hesitate to recognize and dis
:harge. Deferring the choice of ways and
methods until the time for action arrives,
-e should make them depend upon the pre
:ise conditions then existing, and they should
Kt be determined upon without giving care
ail heed to every consideration involving
mr honor and interest or the international
luty we owe to Spain. Until we face the
ntingencies suggested or the situation li
- y other incidents imperatively changed we

More pursued, thas In all circumstances ex
hibiting out obedience to th rrnnlrm.n.
6f public law and oar record for the duty
enjoined upon us by th position we occupy
in the family of nations.
, A contemplation of emergencies that may
arise should plainly lead us to avoid their
creation, either through a careless disregard
of present duty or evn an undue stimula
tion and ill-tlmell expression of feeling.
Bet I have deemed not amiss to remind the
congress that a time , may arrive when a
correct policy and a cre for our interests
as well as a regard for the interests of other
nations and their citizens. Joined by consid
erations of humanity nd a desire to see a
rich and fertile country intimately related
to us, spared from complete devastation,
will constrain our government to such action
as will subserve the Interests thus Involved
and at the same time promise to Cuba and
Its inhabitants an opportunity to enjo the
blessings of peace.
VENEZCKL.A.
The Venezuelan boundary question has
ceased to be a matter ef difference between
Great Britain and the United States, their
respective governments having agreed upon
the substantial provisions of a treaty be
tween Great Britain and Venezuela submit
ting the whole controversy to arbitration
The provisions of thu . treaty are so emi
nently just and fair that the consent of Ven
ezuela thereto may C onfidently be antici
pated. Negotiations for a t. iaty of general arbi
tration for all differences between Great
Britain and the United States are far ad
vanced and promise to reach a successful
consummation at an early date.
TREASURY DEPARTMENT.
The secretary ot the treasury reports that
during the fiscal year ended June SO, 1896,
the receipts of the government from all
sources amounted to M09.475.40&78. Dur
ing the same period its expenditures were
434,678,654.48. The excess of expenditures
over receipts thus amounted to $25,203,
235.70. The ordinary expenditures during
the year were $4,015,852.21 less than dur
ing the preceding fiscal year. Of the re
ceipts mentioned there was derived from
customs the sum of $160,021,751.67, and
from internal revenue $146,830,615.66. The
receipts from customs show an increase of
$7,863,134.22 over those from the same
source for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1895, and the receipts from internal revenue
an increase of $3,584,537.91.
The value of our imported dutiable mer
chandise during the last fiscal year was
$369,757,470, and the value of free goods
imported $409,967,470. being an increase of
$6,523,675 In the value of dutiable goods,
and $91,231,034 in the value of free goods
over the preceding year.
Our exports of merchandise, foreign and
domestic, amounted in value to $882,606,938,
being an increase over the preceding year
of $75,068,773. The average ad valorem
duty paid on dutiable goods imported dur
ing the year was 39.94 per cent, and on free
and dutiable goods taken together, 20.55
per cent.
The cost of collecting our Internal revenue
was 2.78 per cent as against 2.81 percent
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895.
The total production of distilled spirits, ex
clusive of fruit brandies, was 85,588,703
taxable gallons, being an increase of 6.639,
108 gallons over the preceding year. There
was also an increase of 1,443,676 gallons of
spirits, produced from fruit a mmnarwA
with the preceding year. The number of
barrels of beer produced was 35,859.250 as
against 33,589,784 produced in the preced
ing fiscal year, being an Increase of 2,269,
466 barrels.
OTHER DEPARTMENTS.
The report of the secretary of war exhibits
satisfactory conditions in the several
branches of the public service intrusted to
his charge. The various recommendations
of the secretary are indorsed.
The attorney general presents a detailed
and interesting statement of the important
work done under his supervision during the
last fiscal year. The ownership and man
agement by the government of peniten
tiaries for the confinement of the convicted
in United States courts of violations of
federal laws, which for many years has been
a subject of executive recommendation, has
at last to a light extent been realized by the
utilization of the abandoned military prison
at Fort Leavenworth as a United States
penitentiary.
Federal Penitentiary.
This certainly a movement in the right
direction, but it ought to be at once supple
mented by the rebuilding or extensive en
largement of this improvised prison and the
construction of at least one more, to be
located in the southern states. The capacity
of the Leavenworth penitentiary is so lim
ited that the expense of its maintenance,
calculated it a per capita rate upon the
number f prisoners it can accommodate,
does not make as economical an exhibit as It
would f it were larger and better adapted
to prison purposes; but I am thoroughly
convinced that economy, humanity and a
proper sense of responsibility and duty to
wards those whom we punish for violations
of federal law dictate that the federal gov
ernment should have the entire control and
management of the penitentiaries where
convicted violators are confined. It appears
that since the transfer of the Fort Leaven
worth military prison to its new uses the
work previously done by prisoners conmned
there, and for which expensive machinery
has been provided, has been discontinued.
This work consisted of the manufacture of
articles for army use, now done elsewhere.
On all grounds it is exceedingly desirable
that the convicts confined in this peniten
tiary be allowed to resume work of this de
scription. Our postofflce department is in good condi
tion and the exhibit made of its operations
during the fiscal year ended June 30. 1898,
If allowance is made for imperfections in
the laws applicable to it is very satisfac
tory. The total receipts during the year
were $82,499,208.40. The total expenditures
were $90,626,296.84, exclusive of $1,559.
89rt.27 which was earned by the Pacific rail
roads for transportation and credited on
their debt to the government There was
an increase of receipts over the previous
year of $5,516,080.21, or 7.1 per cent, and an
increase of expenditures of $3,836,124.02 or
4.43 per cent The deficit was $1,679,956.19
less than that of the preceding year. The
chief expenditures of the postal service are
regulated by law and are not in the control
of the postmaster general.
The deficit for the last year, although
much less tnan that of the last and preced
ing years, emphasizes the necessity for leg
islation to correct the growing abuse of
second-class rates, fc which the deficit is
mainly attributable. The transmission at
the rate ot one cent a pound of serial libra
ries, advertising sheets, "house - organs"
(periodicals advertising some particular
"house" or Institution), sample copies and
the like, ought certainly be discontinued.
This subject is discussed at considerable
length and refc rms urgently recommended.
Navy.
The work of the navy department and its
present conditions are fully exhibited in
the report of the secretary. The construc
tion of vessels for onr new navy has been
energetically prosecuted by the present ad
ministration upon ,the general lines pre
viously adopted, the department having
seen no necessity for radical changes in
prior methods under which the work was
found to be progressing in a manner highly
satisfactory. It has been decided, however
to provide in every ship building contract

FIVE CIVILIZED TRIBES.
The condition of affairs among the five
civilized tribes who occupy large tracts of
land in the Indian Territory, and who have
governments of their own, has assumed such
an asspect as to render It almost Indispens
ible that there should be an entire change
In the relations of these Indians to the gen
eral government This seems to be neces
lary in furtherance of their own Interests
u well as for the protection of non-Indian
residents in their territory. A commission

A change is also needed to protect life and

conducted according tu strict Justice and
strong enough to enforce their mandates.
Vs a sincere friend of the Indian I am ex
ceedingly anxious thai these reforms should
be accomplished with.thc consent and aid of
the tribes and that no necessity niay be pre
sented for radical or drastic legislation. I
hope, therefore, that the commission now
conducting negotiations will soon be able to
report that progress has been made toward
a friendly adjustment of existing difficul
ties. PACIFIC RAILROADS.

I desire to recur to the statements else
where made concerning the government's
receipts and expenditures for the purpose
Dt venturing upon some suggestions touch
ing our present tariff law and its operation.
This statute took effect on the 28th day of
August. iBa4. wnatever may be it short
comings as a complete measure of tariff
reform, it must be conceded that it has
opened the way to a freer and greater ex-
change of commodities between us and other
countries, and thus furnished a wider mar-
ket for our products and manufactures.
The only entire year during which this
law has been in force ended on the 30th dav
of June, 1896. In that vear our imports In-

penses of the government, and which must
unless expended for that purpose, remain a
useless hoard, or, if not extravagantly
wasted, must in any event be perverted from
the purpose of its exaction from our peo
ple, the payment therefore, of any defi
ciency In the revenue from this fund is
nothing more than its proper and legitimate
use. It is immeasurably better to appropri
ate our surplus to the payment of Justifiable
expenses than to allow it to become an invi
tation to reckless appropriations and ex
travagant expenditures.
I suppose it will not be denied tkat under
the present law our people obtainvthe neces
saries of a comfortable existence at a
cheaper rate than formerly. This is a mat
ter of supreme Importance, since it is the
palpable duty of every Just government to
make the burdens of taxation as light as
possible. The people should not be required
to relinquish this privilege of cheaper living
except under the stress of their govern
ment's necessity made plainly manifest
FINANCIAL.
This reference to the condition and pros
pects of our revenues naturally suggests an
allusion to the weakness and vices of our
financial methods. They have been fre
quently pressed upon the attention of the
Congress in previous executive communica
tions and the inevitable danger of their con
tinued toleration pointed out Without now
repeating these details, I cannot refrain
from again earnestly presenting the neces
sity of the prompt reform of a system op
posed to every rule of sound finance and
shown by experience to be fraught with the
gravest peril and perplexity. The terrible
civil war which shook the foundations of
our government more than thirty vears
ago, brought id its train the destruction of
property, the wasting of our countrv's sub
stance, and the estrangement of brethren.
These are now past and forgotten. Even
the distressing loss of life the conflict en
tailed is but a sacred memorv. which fos
ters patriotic sentiment and keeps alive a
tender regard for those who noblv died.
And yet there remains with us to-day. in
full strength and activity as an incident of
that tremendous struggle, a feature of its
financial necessity not only unsuited to our
present circumstances, but manifestly a
disturbing menace to business security and
an ever present agent of monetary distress.
Because we may be enjoying a temporary
relief from its depressing influence this
should not lull us into a false securitv or
lead us to forget the suddenness of past visi
tation. I am more convinced than ever that
we can have not assured financial peace and
safety until the government currency obli
gations upon which gold may be demanded
from the treasury are withdrawn from cir
culation and cancelled. This might be done
as has been recommended, by their exchange
for long term bonds bearing a low rate of
Interest, or by their redemption with the
proceeds of such bonds.
Even if only United States notes known as
greenbacks were thus retired It is probable
that the treasury notes issued in payment
of silA r purchases under the act ot July
14, 1890, now paid in gold when demanded,
would not create much disturbances, as they
might from time to time, when received in
the treasury by redemption of gold or other
wise, be gradually and prudently replaced
by silver coin. This plan of issuing bonds
for the purpose of redemption certainly ai
.pears to be the most effective and direct
path to the needed reform.
In default of this, however, it would be a
step in the right direction if currencv obli
gations redeemable in gold whenever so
redeemed should be cancelled instead of be
ing reissued. This operation would be a
slow remedy, but it would improve present
conditions.
National banks should redeem their own
notes. They should be allowed to Issue cir
culation to the par value of bonds deposited
as security for its redemption and the tax
on their circulation should be reduced to
one-fourth of 1 per cent The entire case
may be presented by the statement that the
day of sensible and sound financial methods
will not dawn upon us until our government
abandons the banking business and the ac
cumulation of funds, and confines its mone
tary operations to the receipts of money
contributed by the people for its support
and to the expenditure of such money for
the people's benefit Our business interests
and all good citizens long for rest from fev
erish agitation, and the inauguration by the
government of a reformed financial policy
which will encourage enterprise and make
certain the rewards of labor and industry.
TRUSTS.
Another topic in which our people right
fully take a deep interest may be here
briefly considered. I refer to the expanse of
trusts and other huge aggregations of capi
tal, the object of which is to secure the mr.
nopoly of some particular branch of trade,
industry or commerce, and lo stifle whole
some competition. When these are defended
it is usual -y on the ground that though they
Increase profits, they also reduce prices and
thus may benefit the public. It must be re
membered, however, that a reduction of
prices to tl.e people is not one of the
real objects of these organizations,
nor Is their tendency necessarily in that
direction. If it occurs in a particular case
it is only be.:a-ise it accords with the pur
poses oi Interests of those managing their
scheme. Such occasional results fall short
of composing the palpable evils charged to
the account of trusts and monopolies. Their
tendency is to crush out individual inde
pendence and to hinder and to prevent the
free use " numan faculties and the full de-
