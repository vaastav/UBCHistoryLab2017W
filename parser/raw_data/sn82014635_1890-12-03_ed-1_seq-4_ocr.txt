Congress has another duty pressing
upon them about winch the people say
little, t ut which was one among the
other things impelling the farmers of
tho country into a class-politico organi
tion. There is nothing more important
to tho vri 11 being of a peoplo. than pure
food, and the fact that powerful but un
scrupulous corporations are annually pil
ing up millions by tho adulterations of
food is notorious. It is a thing that
would not be permitted in any other civ
ilized country. The American people
have jrood naturedly laughed over the
way manufacturers have swindled them
with "shoddy,"' but when it comes
to tho question of food for
themselves and children, of food which
is to sustain brain and body, it becomes
a very different matter. Many prefer
the cheap and shoddy in vehicles, in
furnishings, in clothing and in many
tilings, but when it comes to food they
will .stand neither adulteration or decep
tion. One of the most notorious "and
defiant mixing, compounding and cheat
ing swindles, flourishing in America, is
the belling of cotton seed oil for pure
hog's lard. It cheats the farmer and
cheats the consumer. It is also an
unmitigated fraud and swindle
against honest packers. And yet
congress refuses and neglects to
do its duty by sixty-five millions
of people, in a matter in which they are
practically unanimous in their demand.
It pas-es all under-tanding that the law
makers of the country have stopped to
listen to the appeal of scoundrelly
syndicates like the cotton oil trusts which
acknowledge that their nefarious business
couldn't stand for a day if the law com
pelled them to stamp their articles just
what the' are.

NATIONAL BANKS.
The stock of gold and silver in the
United States on November 1, 1890, ac
cording to the annual report of the sec
) etary of the treasury ia estimated to have
been 1,180,230,177, of which 09J,S05.

880,988,40G standard silver dollars, 77.
345,091 of subsidary silver coin, and 27,

An Alliance paper called Fair Play,
(which paper is a travesty upon tho
name), published in Cowloy county,
quotes tho statement that morgages aro
being paid off in Kansas at the rate of
thrco a day in nearly every county in
tho state, aud adds this comment:
"Cowlev county can beat that clear out
of sight; .Sheriff Gibson paid off twenty
ihrcofnnn mortgages in one day, last
week, and twent y-threo farmers are now
ready to tramp."
Tho Arkansas City Traveler called on
tho clerk of the district court to inquire
about this, aud the clerk informed him
that it was a viliisnous lie. It is strange
that people will persist in perverting tho
truth, oven when to do so inures to their
disadvantage, if not to their actual ma
terial injury, and that, too, when there
is no provocation or excuse therefor.
"Whatever of criticism may bo put upon
tho piesidenfs message, as a whole, none
will deny that it contains a number of

ber of laboring people whoso daily voca
tion brings them in constant jeopardy of

recommendation that congress inaugu
rate, by suitnble legislation, a movement
looking to the uniformity and increased
hafoty in the use of couplers and brakes
upon freight trains. The sacrifice of
2,000 lives and the maiming of 2,000
joung men evory year, should have
prompted some such movoment long

railroad managers will not do it of their
own accord they should bo prompted to
act without further delay, and congress
is the only authority competent to move
in the matter.

Tho report of tuo comptroller of tho
currency, embodied in tho report of the
secretary of the treasury, contains full
information in reference to the affairs of
national banks, aud covers tho opera
tions of the bureau for the twelve montlis
ended October 31, 1S90. During this pe
riod 807 new associations liavo been or
ganized, fifty have gone into voluntary
liquidation, and nine have been placed in
tho hands of receivers. The net increase
is 248, constituting a larger growth than
during any similar period since 1805.
The number of active banks on October
31, 1890, was 3,507, which is an increase
over any previous date.
These banks havo in capital stock
059,782,805; bonds deposited to securo
circulation, $140,190,900; and bank notes
outstanding, 179,755,613, including 54,
790,907, represented by lawful money
deposited to redeem circulation still out
standing. Tho gross decrease in circula
tion during the year, including notes of
gold banks, and thoso of failed and liqui
dating associations, was 22,207,772, and
the decrease in circulation secured by
United States bonds was 5,24S,540.
On October 2, 1890, the date of the last
report of condition, 3,540 banks were
opened for business. Theso associations
report an aggregate capital of 050,447,
235; surplus, 213,503,895; aud undivided
profits, 97,000,030. Gross deposits, in
cluding amounts duo banks, aro 6tated

theso items over any previous dato

601,731 in legal tender notes; 18,492,392
in national bank notes, and 0,155,000
in United States certificates of dejosit.
Accessions to tho system havo been
most numerous in the states west of tho
Mississippi river, Texas being most
promin-n., with 6ixty-threo new asso
ciations. The controller concludes his report
with tho statement that "aside from tho
right to issue circulating notes the na
tional banking system seems to be more
favorably regarded than heretofore, and
is rapidly extending its sphero of ojera
tions. Tho transactions of the year have
been attended by a moro than average
degree of success." The exception men
tioned, that is the right to issue circulat
ing notes, is one of the most serious ob-
jections that is urged to tho system,
many pertous insisting that such prerog
ative belongs exclusively to tho govern
ment and cannot of right bo delegated to
the individual or a Corporation. There
are other features of the system, how
ever, that to many are no Isss objectiona
ble than this.
OUR FOREIGN COMMERCE.
Tho value of our foreign commerco
during the last fiscal year, according to
tho report of the secretary of tho treas
ury, was greater than any previous year.
It amounted to 1,647,139,093, as against
1,487,583,027 during the fiscal year
1SM, an increase of 159,600,00G.
The value of imports of merchandise
also during tho last fiscal year was the
largest in the history of our commerce,
amounting to 789,810,409, as against
745,181,052 during the fiscal year 1SS9,
and increase of 45.178,757. The value
of exports of merchandise during the
same period was S57,S2S,6S4, as against
742,401.375 for the previous year. 1SS9,
an increase of 115,427,809. The exports
exceeded the imports of merchandise bv
0S.51S,275.
The exports of domestic merchandise
There vill not come another oppor
tunity soon in which corn can bo bought
at from eleven to thirteen cents a bushel
in this valley, which fact reminds us
that the Eagle, last fall, declared that
money invested in tho then prices would
net one hundred per cent, or more inside
of a year. Wo didn't estimato half
strong enough. A certain farmer in the
south part of this county thought the
same thing. He raised nearly five thous
and bnshels of corn on his own farm
which he mortgaged for all tho money
he could procuro on it and invested it in
twelve and fifteen cent corn which ho
added to what he had raised and which
bo cribbed up and which he still holda.
He can sell out any day and lift all of
his indebtedness and havo a big sum left
to bank, as he bought upwards of twenty
thousand bushels. But he expo ts to get
seventy-five cents for every bushel and
the chances are that he will before next
May. At any rato at tho present prices
ho has made several thousands of dollars.
The tens of thousands of bushels of corn
burned up in this valley last year would
come in good about now. If but half of
the eight million bushels of corn rassed
in Sedgwick county last year had been
held over by the farmers, it would have
gone a long way now in wiping out in
debtedness and making good times. But
the samo chances and experiences have
occurred before since the settlement of
thi3 valley.
MORE MONEY WANTED.
Tho report of the secretary of the
treasury contains a tabulated statement
of the amount of currency outstanding
at different datef. Accompanying this
is a declaration by the secretary that
"not only is the currency not contract
ing, eitiier actually or in propoition to
population, but that it is rapidly expand
ing in each particular; that the actual
inci ease has been equal to 3,000,000 a
month" for several years. The secre
tary's statement may bo, doubtless is,
correct as to tho amount of currency
brought into existence, but that it has
not come into actual circulation is equal
ly as true. And despite tho secretary's
statements, tho country wants moro
money. It's no use to coin money to
pile up in treasury vaults, or to issue cer
tificates in such largo denominations as
to render them practically valueless for
circulation, aud issue them in payment
of bullion or other obligations of the
government. Such a lino of policy as
that is as far from satisfying tho demands
of tho people in that line as to raise tho
schedule of import ditties and call it re
forming the tariff.

Sons of Veterans, and the samo having

Special attention is hereby called to

A HEAVY DRAIN ON OUR CURRENCY.
The report of the superintendent of the
money-order system of the postal de
partment, states that there seems to be
no diminution of tho steady flow to
ward foreign countries of tho savings of
new citizens who find in our own land
remunerative fields of labor. As shown
in the report in question, it was neces
sary to liquidate balances abroad, by
reason of the excess of orders drawn in
this country over those drawn upon us
to the amount of 8,353,501.50. "We have
seen no statement of the amount of
money brought to this country by immi
grants annually, but daro say that it is
not much, if any more than the amount
sent out of this country, as shown above,
which is so much permanently with
drawn for tho volume of our circulating
medium.

"There is no such thing as extemporane

Ingalls lately. "Every good speech is

great extemporaneous poem." What
about the senator's Xew York World interview?
dues should be induced to become rein
stated. The department commander
would especially urge upon post officers
the necessity of making the next quar

reports will be mailed to the commander
of each post in due time.

that while Minnesota may prohibit the

it has no authority to prohibit
the sale of Chicago oleomargarine
