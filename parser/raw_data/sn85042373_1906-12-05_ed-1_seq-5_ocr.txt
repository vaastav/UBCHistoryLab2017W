INJURED
Was Pinched at Devils Lake
Strange Affair Reported
From Montana.
A sad and rather odd incident is
told in connection with the death ot
fireman Peter Morrlssette, who was
Ulled in the Great Northern wreck at
Doyon a few days ago. Morlssette's re
mains were taken to the old home at
Chippewa Falls, Wis. by engineer
James Murray of Minot. The deceased,
it 'seems, had failed to keep his rela
tives posted as to his whereabouts,
and for four weeks past, endeavors had
been made to notify him of the death
of his mother, which fact Morrlssette
died without learning. His was the
fifth death in the family within the
past year. ..
Pecollar Affair.
Many pathetic instances are related
in connection with railway accidents,
but perhaps the most pitiful and at
the same time peculiar may be told In
connection with a wreck which oc
curred two or three days since at
Concord, Mont, when Felix Kanooth,
a Great Northern brakeman, was in
stantly killed In a rear end collision
between two freights.
Kenooth was standing on the rear
of his caboose when another train,
running at a high rate, crashed into
the train, demollsing several cars and
instantly killing the brakeman. A
cousin ot the dead man was the en
gineer on the rear train, and when
first word of the accident was con
veyed to Havre, it was a brother of
the dead man who had to take charge
of the wreckers, and who afterward
Tescued the mangled remains of the
young man from the heap of broken
cars.

The congress of municipalities of
North Dakota will be convened in
Grand Forks on Thursday morning
In the Commercial club rooms. This
congress, it is expected, will have
much to do with the action of the leg
islature this winter In regard to city
charters.
Alderman Joy, chairman of the al
dermanlc committee haB received
numerous letters from over the Btate
from city officers saying that repres
entatives would be sent here to take

an evening or two since at Devils
Lake, and did receive injuries serious
enough that he was removed to his
home here and has since been con
fined therein.
Mr. Sullivan is a brakeman, employ
ed on the yard engine In Devils Lake
nights. Saturday evening he attempt
ed to make a coupling while standing
on the rear of the switch engine, to a
"bad order" car, whose bumper was
broken. The coupling failed and the
bumper on the disabled car slipped
by that on the engine. This allowed
the end ot the freight car to close
in on Sullivan, and he was pinched
between his engine and the car. Had
the car been allowed to come back two
inches further, he would have been
badly crushed.
Engineer Hart
Engineer Bert Huycke, a well
known and popular engineer on the
Great Northern, who has tyeen run
ning between Barntaville and Larl
mote, received quite painful Injuries
Monday evening In a crash of two
engines In the yards at Larlmore.
Engineer Huycke was running on No.
1 and at Larlmore engines were
changed. He started for the round
house at a fair clip when about half
way up the yardB, the headlight of
No. 6, which was being pulled by two
engines, suddenly loomed up. Huycke
stuck with his engine until her speed
was considerably lessened, and then
seeing that a crash was inevitable,
jumped into the darknesB. Thd head
engine on No. 6 struck the light en
gine with a bang that was sufficient
to smash both pilots, but not enough
to seriously disable either machine.
Engineer Huycke, when he took his
leap In the dark, landed In such a
manner as to injure his back and one
limb. He has been laid up since the
accident.

Distinguished Oitisen Died at
His Home Yesterday Even

A SKETCH OF HIS LIFE
Was a Prominent Business
Man and Widely Known
•instate.
Hie pale horse and his rider passed
this way last evening and laid the
hand of death'heavily upon one of the
most honored and respected citizens
of this city, when Warren Bennett
Wood answered the call of the Master
of the universe to pass the tide water
of eternity. After a brief illness of
two weeks, he passed peacefully to
the great unknown at 6 o'clock last
evening. While he had been confined
to his rooms for several days he was
not thought to be la any danger and was
even planning to get down stairs,
when a stroke of apoplexy yesterday
morning rendered him unconscious for
some time, and while he rallied later
in the day, it was evident from the
time the stroke came that his death
was only a matter of a few hours at
least
He was born in Portage county,
Wisconsin, November 26, 1858, and was
therefore past 48 years of age. At an
early age he was left an orphan, his
father having been killed while fight
ing at the front in the union army in
1862, and his mother's death follow
ing the next year at her old home in
New York. At the age of six years he
was sent to Wisconsin and placed in
the care of a guardian with whom he
grew to manhood. He was educated in
the common schools of that state, and
while he rapidly absorbed all the ad
vantages which they afforded they
did not satisfy his ambition and he
grew to manhood a broad-minded,
though self educated man. He came to
Grand Forks In 1880, and has made
his home in this community ever since.
For. several years he was engaged In
the business of farm real estate and
loans tor the Corbln Banking company
of New York, one of the greatest
banking houses of the east which was
identified with the early development
of the northwest He was elected to
the lower branch of the state legis
lature in 1894 and re-elected lit 1896,
serving in both sessions with marked
distinction. He was the author or
the Wood law, and while he was con
servative in his advocacy of measures,
he is remembered by the men who
served with him as wise and safe
counselor and a man thoroughly de
voted to the interests of his consti
tuents and the state. In 1898 he
formed a business partnership with J.
D. Bacon and they erected the Da
cotah hotel of the city. Mr. Wood has
been giving much of his personal at
tention during the last few years to
the business of the hotel, but has a
number of other investments and busi
nesses.
He. was married in 1884 to Miss Dora
Tabor of Wisconsin, who' with a
daughter, Miss Viola M., born Decem
ber 18, 1891, survives him. His home
in the Daootah has been the gathering
place of many of the leading men of
the state and the kindly and generous
hospitality which has greeted every
one who passed the portals has made
it one of the most popular homes in
the state.
Mr. Wood was a lodge man of con
siderable importance. He was a mem
ber of the Elks, the K. P., the Masons
and the Woodmen. In his death the
community loses one of its truly, re
spected and well beloved citizen.
When the caeket -wjiich contains all
that Is mortal of Warren Bennett
Woods is consigned to the eternal em
brace of mother earth, the heads of
hundreds of friends will bow reverent
ly and sadly, and the tears of sorrow
will abundantly flow for the memory of
one of the truest and bravest friends
that, it Is possible to have in this
life, and if there is an enemy he too
will bow reverently- at the bier of a
man who never struck in the dark
and was as manly and generous to foe
as he was true and loyal to friend.
He will be missed In the community in
which his life-work has been made,
and in the immediate circle of his
home a vacancy will be found which
truly can never be filled. If the sym
pathy of the friends could lift the bur
den of sorrow from the loved ones he
has left behind It would be done. But
no sympathy however profound, can
fill the place of the tender and loving
husband and the devoted father who
has passed the portals which separate
eternity from time.
The funeral wilbbe held tomorrow
at 3 o'clock in the parlors of the Da
ootah. The funeral sermon will be
preached by Rev. Dr. Frank Harper
Hayes of Chicago, and the obsequies
will be in charge of B. P. O. E. No. 255.
The pall bearers will be Steve Collins,
Wm. Budge, State Auditor H. L.
Holmes of Bathgate, Secretary of State
E .F. Porter of Bismarck, State Sena
tor A. D. Stevens of Crookaton, Min
nesota and W. H. Kelsey. The re
mains can be viewed by friends from
10 o'clock a. m. to 2 o'clock p. m. at
the Dacotah parlors.
COMPETITIONS SHIPPER
If He Gels In Territory Where There
Is Opposition to tie
Great Northern.
If a shipper wants plenty of rail
road cars to ship his goods he should
locate In a territory where there is
competition between the Great North
ern and the Soo, according to L. H.
Lake, traveling representative for the
THE EVENING TIMES, GRAND PORKS, N. D.
Gelper manufacturing Co. Mr. Lake
covers the northern half of the state
for his company, and he says that
there is practical stagnation at present
in business circBes because of the
grain blockade.
"All the elevators are full," he said
in discussing the matter, "and the
grain is being dumped on the ground
in huge piles. At New Rockford,
where I make my home, there 1b one
huge pile, containing 60,000 bushels of
wheat Much the same conditions exist
all over my territory. But where the
Great Northern and Soo reach the
same district the people are not suffer
ing so much from car shortage. They
claim It is because there is competition
and it looks very much like it for
on other branches of the two roads
the car shortage Is very marked."
In spite of the grain blockade Mr.
White considers business conditions
very good.
"Considering all the circumstances
business has been very good," he said
"and collections have been coming in
pretty well. During the past three
years the western port of the state
has experienced a tide of prosperity
which has placed most of the people
In good circumstances, enabling the
farmers to pay off their mortgaces and
get afresh start and where the farm
ers are prosperous the towns are sure
to be in the same way."
A prominent local banker, in dis
cussing the grain situation today said
that It seems to be improving a little,
as from what he could learn there had
been a considerable Increase in the
number of cars received of late at the
terminal points in Minneapolis and at
the head of the lakes.
"Even after shipments begin to be
made in large quantities it will take
some time before the effect is notice
able in business and banking lines," he
said, for the wheat has to be shipped
to Duluth, placed in elevators, weighed
and sold and the' money received come
back here and be placed in circulation
before the improved condition will be
felt."

EDW. HUZENIHS
STJWD
Claims Did Not Know That He
Was Doing Anything
Unlawful.
WILL FINISH TONIGHT
Subornation of Perjury is the
Charge on Which He is
Being Tried.
In the opinion of the prosecution
Edward E. Hazen, charged with
subornation of perjury, made many
admissions this morning while under
a severe cross-examination by Assist
ant United States Attorney B. D.
Townsend.
Hazen is charged with having se
cured a young man named Robert
Everett to file and prove up on a
certain piece of land near Glenburn,
Bottineau county, for the benefit of
the defendant in the action. Such a
procedure is contrary to the laws of
the deprtment of the interior.
Among the exhibits at the trial was
a contract drawn up between Everett
and Hazen to the effect that Everett
should turn the land over to Hazen
upon the payment of a certain sum.
This contract was sworn to and sub
scribed before Attorney LeSueur of
Minot.
Some time before this contract was
drawn up, Hazen secured a relin
quishment from a man who had form
erly filed on the land. Mr. Hazen then
went to the, office of Attorney Le
Sueur, told-him of the relinquishment
he had, and also that he had intended
to bring his father to the state from
Ohio to prove up on the land. This
his father was unable to do, and it is
claimed, that in order to make it Im
possible for any one else to file on
the land, that Hazen started a friend
ly contest.
Hazen is then alleged to have se
cured Everett to file on the land. On
the stand Hazen admitted that he
wanted the land, and also that the
contract was drawn up.
The case may go to the jury this
25 Cents On
Dollar
evening, though it Is not certain at
this time.
On the stand yesterday afternoon
Attorney LeSueur testified that he
had told Everett and Hazen that the
contract drawn up was an Illegal one.
Hazen claims that LeSueur did not
tell him this.
The defense is that Hazen was not
aware that when he drew up the con
tract and made the agreement that he
was doing anything unlawful, that he
had seen others do the same thing,
and did not think it wrong.
