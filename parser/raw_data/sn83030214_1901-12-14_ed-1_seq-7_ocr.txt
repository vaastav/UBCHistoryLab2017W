STORM HAVOC IX ENGLAND
ELEVEN rEARS SINCE SUCH DAMAGE
WAS WROUGHT.
TREATY COMMENTS IN THE WEEKLIES—
YKKKKS lU'YS A FAMOUS PICTURE.
(r- r vri»-ht: WtHi By The New-York Tribune.)
[HT CABT-E TO THE TRIBUNE.]
Lender.. Dec. 14. 1 a. m. — It is not yet possible
v Is estimate the extent of the damage
caused by Thursday's storm. For one thing, the
-> tales of the sea have ypt to he told. It is
certain, however, that eleven years have elapsed
f i nrf . such havoc was wrought with telegraph
wires, though, of course, there have been many
breakdowns in the mean time of a less serious
nature. The combination of wind, snow and rain
ra to have be?n irresistible in nearly every
part of thf- kingdom, with the exception of Lon
- - Th^ snow settled on the wires and weight
■•■ down: then frost contracted them to the
breaking point, and the wind did the rest.
Birmingham, although visited more severely
tfcan any other big town, suffered little incon
venience, owing to the fact that it possesses an
-ound cable to London. The commercial
lo=.~ to the country- resulting from the wholesale
tfgliili How must be very considerable.
ftm two leading weekly reviews, although they
both support the government, adopt curiously
different tones in discussing th° Hay-Pauncefote
treaf . "The Spectator" thinks all the states
men ■»»* diplomatists concerned in the matter
deserve the greatest possible credit for wise and
Eympatheiic handling of the problem, while "The
Saturday Review," after a reference to Senator
Lodge's speech as clear proof of the complete na
ture of Lord Lansdowne's surrender to the
Drifted States, goes on to say:
t die history of diplomacy has shown any
thire it has proved the absolute helplessness of
broad principles and wide implications in dealing
vritb ur. c crupulous politicians.
The -Aimiralty authorities are beinp urped to
make rr. effort to secure the services of Cana-
Australlans as officers of the King's
navy, so that the consciousness that the navy is
one Imperial service should be fostered. It Is
arpued that the position of the navy as the
foundation bulwark of the British Empire would
b<- better understood in both Great Britain and
tr.e colonies if the admiral commanding in the
Mediterranean happened to be an Australian and
the admiral commanding the future North Sea
squadron a Canadian.
Mr. Chamberlain's organ in the press is respon
sible for the statement that an important agree-
BMSt will shortly be arrived at in connection
with the proposed fast mail service to Canada.
Correspondence is now proceeding- between the
Dominion authorities and the Colonial Office on
the subject, and it is understood that the long
standing difficulty as to the proportion of the
subsidy to be borne by the imperial government
will be* disposed of by the Dominion government
making a greater contribution upon condition
that the contractors give special facilities for
carrying Canadian dairy and other produce for
the home markets.
In art circles the news that Mr. Yerkes has
bought Turner's "Rockets and Blue Lights" from
J. Orrock for £15.000 has c.iused a flutter of ex
citement. This picture was originally purchased
from the Academy in 1840. when it was first ex
hibited by J. Naylor. of Hcoton Hall. Cheshire.
Then it became the property of H. McConnell. of
Cressbrook. Derbyshire, at a sale of whose pict
ures In ISS6 ;t was bought by Sir Julian Gold
sroid for £745. Ten years later, when the Gold
emid collection was dispersed, it realized £3.855.

DEVELOPMENT OF ITALY.
PREMIER ZANARDELLI TELLS OF GREAT
SCHEMES PROJECTED.
Rome. Dec 13.— Signor Zanardelll. the Italian
Premier, in the Chamber of Deputies to-day
showed how the efforts of the Italian Govern
ment had improved the health and material
prosperity of Naples and the Southern Italian
provinces, and announced that he hoped to con
clude commercial treaties with Germany and
Austria benefiting Italian agriculture. With
that end in view, the Premier said he was study-
Ing a tariff which it 'was proposed eventually to
provide as a means of defence against^ foreign
tariffs. The government also hoped to conclude
satisfactory agreements with Russia and Brazil.
Signor Zanardelli said the country ought to
endeavor to make Naples a great manufact
uring centre by pouring capital into It, and that
the government would appoint a committee to
consider this problem. He intended, during the
next session of the Chamber of Deputies, to in
troduce a bill to establish two direct lines of
railroads between Rome and Naples and to re
duce the journey between the two cities to two
and on-half hours. Continuing, the Premier
said he also hoped it might be possible to con-
Brnct a central railroad between Bologna. Flor
ence and Rome, thus reducing the journey be
twten Milan and Naples to nine hours. Then
said Signer Zanardelli. the St. Gothard and
action tunnels will. Indeed, become the great
highways of mankind. .. „_„«._
Another bill to be introduced would propose
the construction of aqueducts in Apulia, a prov
ince of Southern Italy. These measures would
not disturb the national finances, said the Pre
initr. because the work would be taken in hand
Signor Zanardelli testified to the
unanimity of the Deputies in meeting the sacri
fices to assure the prosperity and the greatness
. cf the country, and said it was such |«criflceß
that rendered the unity of Italy possible, and
would render her great among the nations.
These remarks were greeted with Prolonged
applause from all sides, the Deputies crowding
around the Premier to shake his hand and con
cratulate him.

ADVOCATED AT FRIENDS' PEACE CONFERENCE.
PhuaaeWhia Dec. 13.-The second day's session

Shay May Be Strengthened." He lamented the
'act that England had not intrusted her case
against the Boers to ar. international court. "It
Is more than apparent that her claim is far from
b*-ir.g a just one " he said. He was also of the
opinion that the Philippine question should have
been submitted to an international tribunal, and
contended that the natives would have accepted
the verdict of a disinterested people.

FINAL OFFER FROM CHILI
BASES OF A NEW PROPOSITION TO THE
ARGENTINE.
IF REFUSED. WAR EXPECTED— GOOD OF
FICES OF THIS COUNTRY AND
BRAZIL. OFFERED.
Buenos Ayres. Dec. 13.— Dispatches received
here from Santiago de Chili say that Sefior
Tanez. Chilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, has
handed to the Minister of the Argentine Re
public to Chili, Sefior Portela, the bases of a
new proposition to effect the Impartial and
friendly settlement of the dispute between the
two countries. If these bases are refused by the
Argentine, Chili will make no further proposi
tions. The refusal of the Argentine will
taken as Indicating that that country desires
war.
The newspapers here publish bulletins to-day
assuring the public that all matters between
the two countries will be honorably arranged.
Santiago de Chili. Dec. 13.— A contingent of
the Chilian reserves has been called to arms. It
numbers about fifty thousand men. But no
movement of the military forces under arms
has occurred. Everything is quiet here, in ex
pectation of the announcement of Chili's an
swer to Argentina, which, according to public
opinion, will be firm and serene.
The Brazilian Government has proffered Us
amicable mediation in the AJgrentlna-Chili dis
pute It would seem here that this action will
not be necessary, as both the Argentine and
Chilian governments hope to come to terms.
London. Dec. 13.-The Associated Press learns
from an authoritative source that the Chilian
reply to the representations of the minister of
the Argentine Republic to Chili was presented
to-day. Confidence is expressed by the officials
here that the basis for a settlement proposed will
lead to a satisfactory arrangement between the
two governments.
-The Times," in its second edition to-day, pub
lishes a dispatch from Valparaiso, under to
day's date, announcing that decrees have been
published calling out a sufficient number of con
scripts and territorial guards to place 30,000
men at the disposal of Chili, to protect the
mountain passes.
Paris, Dec. 13.— A news agency this after
noon received a dispatch from its head office
at Buenos Ayres. dated 11 o'clock this morning,
confirming the press dispatch from Buenos
Ayres last night announcing the calling out of
the Argentine army reserves, and adding that
at the request of the government the Chamber
of Deputies had sanctioned a bill setting aside
the Conversion Fund to be used for the national
defence. Continuing, the dispatch from Buenos
Ayres says:
Th" report that the L'nited States will offer its
gcod offic3s is confirmed. At Chili's request the
American Minister has sounded the intentions
of the Argentine Government. Brazil has also
offered mediation.  ,
It was announced here that Chili has called
out 15,000 men. but the news is questioned be
cause, according to tha officials here, Chill oops
not possess the means to equip and move such
a body of men.
Much anxiety prevails here, in view of the
fact that a decisive conference on the boundary
dispute and other matters takes place at Santi
ago to-day. Public feeiing is very strong.
Sefior Anchorena has off?r^d to bear the ex
pense of a regiment during the entire cam
paign, and patriotic offers of various descrip
tions are arriving from all parts of the country.
Nevertheless, in certain centres, the opinion is
persistenly held that war between Argentina
and Chili "l 3 improbable.
A dispatch received here from Santiago de
Chili, under to-day's date, says:
The alarm manifested in Argentina Is de
clared, in Chilian official circles, to be unwar
ranted. In the opinion of the government, the
boundary dispute will never Justify a rupture.

two houses of Congress appointed to make arrange
ments for a memorial service in honor of Presi

motion hy Senator Fairbanks, who briefly ad
dressed the committee, speaking feelingly of Presi
dent McKlnley. referring to Secretary Hay's tit
nets for the task, and outlining precedents. He
said that no President had ever fo well understood
Congress as did President McKlnley. and that a
strong boni of mutual confidence and respect
umud him to that body. He then told how joint
committees had been chosen after the deaths of
Lincoln and Garheld, and how in the former case
George Bancroft and In the latter Secretary Blalne
had delivered memorial addresses before Joint
meetings of th*> Senate and House, to which the
foreign diplomats, as well as the high officials ol
the United States, were invited. He then Bald:
The selection for this great work, it se^ms to
me and to some that I have conversed with on
t>,e subject, should fall upon a man who is fitted
because of his personal relations to the. President,
an.i because of his gr^at achievements and re
nown. The name which comes almost unbidden
to the lips of us all in this case ia that of Secre
tary John Hay. and it would, indeed, add to .the
symmetry of the occasion and be an emph.is a
of our tribute if he could be selected this morn
ing.
Senator Fairbanks then moved that a committee
be appointed to call on Secretary Hay next Mon
day at 10 o-clock. and Invite him to make th«
address. The motion prevailed, and Senators

THE PASSING THRONG.
"It would seem as though a corporation of a j
blind pool nature should not be permitted to exist
In this country." said Howard
FIGURE- Chandler, of Philadelphia, at tho
HEADS OF Hotel Albemarie yesterday, "for
REAL STOCK- grief and ruin is all too likely to
HOLDERS. follow in its train. This fact is
brought home by the recent erratic
and extraordinary course of the stock of the
Amalgamated Copper Company, which has entailed
a full measure of misery upon those who have
been unlucky enough to be holders of its stock.
"The figureheads that have in large part made
up the directorates of British corporations have
lone been the subject of derisive comment on the
part of English writers. In Albion a lord is dearly
loved and this weakness of the national character
the wolves and vultures of the City have taken
full advantage of. The English boards of directors
contain rank in proportion to the importance of
the undertaking. Thus a duke figures on a board
of the first classs. a marquis on that of the sec
ond and so on down to the catch shilling corpora
tions, wh'ch have to get along as best they can
with a uaionet.
•With English blood in our veins we come
naturally by Euglish characteristics, and while not
so easily gulled gulled we are, and that too often.
In Engfand a lord's name catches the crowd, here
it is that of a great financier that attracts the
throng of investors. So our directorate boards are
more or less analogous to those in England, save
that financiers of lessening calibre correspond to
the lukes and titles dowrward. At a glance it
would seem that America's was the better plan, and
that a name that stood high in the world of money
should be a guarantee that none who invested
under that guarantee should suffer thereby.
"When the directorate of the Amalgamated Cop
per Company is scanned the names of some of
the greatest and most successful
TO PROTECT financiers of the age are found
STOCK- therein. Under the influence of
HOLDERS. the great banks that were its
agents, and the greater interests
that were understood to be behind it. the original
rush to subscribe for the securities of this company
was simply overwhelming. The names of those
identified with it were felt by the public to be a
certain guarantee of success, and fair dealing, ana
because of this feeling the stock was easily dis
posed of and so widely that no less than sixteen
thousand shareholders are now said to be on the
Amalgamated's transfer books.
"In spite of the great names in the directorate;
in spite of the great banks that are its transfer
agents, and in ?pite of that trlgantic and most suc
cessful corporation that is supposed in Street par
lance to be behind the Amalgamated company,
what has been the course pursued? In a period
measurable by months Its securities have dimin
ished a full 50 per cent in value and a loss of over
$90,000,000 entailed on its unfortunate shareholders^
This. too. while copper has been held at a nxea
price to the consumer, and without one word or
information, pro or con. being vouchsafed by the
management of the company. Great ruin to inno
cent holders has bpen entailed. Panic stricken,
they have parted with their shares at great loss,
and" whatever may be the outcome or the final re
sults of the mystery shrouded operations, for the
great body of those who first purchased the stock
there will be permanent loss.
"Such bold manipulation reminds .->ne of tne
palmy days when Erie convulsed the Street by its
evolutions superinduced by the deft fingers of Jay
Gould and James Fisk. It should not be and could
not be if the operations of the company were as
open as are those of the railroads. Why should'
not the industrials publish th^ir earnings from
week to week and month to month, as the railroads
do? And why should not they give out truthful
balance sheets showing their liabilities and assets.
It is too late to undo the wrong that has been
done to the innocent in copper, but it Is n<->t too
early to prevent a repetition of that wrong in this
