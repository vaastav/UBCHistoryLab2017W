The "Reorganization"
The mails are being flooded with literature relat
ing' to tlie "reorganization" of the republican party.
That is. regarded by tlie jtromu lga tors of the litera
ture as of far rmre importance, and as having a
j-'t er bearing on the future prosperity of the coun
try, than any legislation, whatever its character, that
may be enacted by the present congress. The
safety of the country, it is declared, can be assured
oiily under the guardianship of the party which dom
inated it durir.tr the period of its greatest growth and
;niv: no -mem.
It is admitted ).y the literature that the party
made a fatal t ti'or when, in a moment of tempta
tion anil under the domination of machine bosses
!::.-t year, it disregarded the will of the majority.
The extraordinary plea is offered that the repub
lican party was not alone in its offending; that the
I m'-cratie party at Baltimore also nominated a
minority candidate. That is true, but he was nom
inated according to an established rule, however
unwise it might have been. The proprieties were
nt disregarded and decency was not outraged.
ne letter issued by tile republican national
committee assures us that what happened at Chi
cago a ytar ago last Juno will not happen agair.;
that at an early meeting of the committee an at
tempt will be made to readjast the representation
s that the committee would be powerless to re
peat its trime. It does not Know, it is asserted,
whether the committee really has authority lo safe
guard the majority against a further crime by the
committee, but that matter will be threshed out at
the meeting.
Tiie indications are everywhere that the reor
ganization will have to proceed without the aid or
the presence of progressives.! Ieie and there may be
one who is longing for tiie flesh pots, but for every
one v. ho becomes "reorganized" there will he many
republicans and democrats to take his place in the
progressive ranks. They would already be. there if
they had had more time than was allowed between
August i and November of last year to gain a full
understanding' of the progressive movement which
is even now not understood by those who arc calling
the progressives to come back and participate in the.
crusade for offices and booty.
One of the letters sent out by the committee
states that there will never again need be a "party
of protest." Here is a clear misunderstanding of the
purpose of the progressive party. Its protest against
tiie proceedings of the national republican convention
was, after all, only an incident. The principles of
the progressive party were, the principles of the men
and women who afterward constituted the progres
sive party and were entertained by them before the
June convention assembled. They were the princi
ples which a majority of the delegates, rightfully
entitled to seats in the convention, desired should be
enacted into laws. But when the majority was over
ruled, the men and women who afterward formed
the progressive party were left a choice between the
abandonment of those principles and the organiza
turn, not of a party of protest, but of a constructive
part;.. It is this misapprehension of the' origin and
purpose of the progressive party that permits the re
ublir an leaders to hope that there may be a reor
ganization. What have they to offer to the progressives that
the progressives' want? Certainly not this: "The
reorganization of the republican party for it will
amount to that means that progressive policies will
become republican principles jut as rapidly as a
majority of republicans can be convinced of their
wisdom." This is too elusive and shadowy. It is
so transparent that it does not conceal the fact that
the progressive party can work more effectively
alone for its principles than it could work handi
capped by allies waiting to be convinced of the wis
dom of those principles, and already no doubtful of
their wisdom that it will require proof to remove
the doubt. That is, the republican leaders are in
that state of mind which unfits men to serve as
jurors when justice is to be done.
The Republican and progressives almost unan
imously will not trust the principles of the party
to such a "reorganization" Those principles arc
fundamentally right and in the end they must pre
vail. An arna'gamntion of their supporters with an
element which is yet to be convinced ,,f their right
eousness, if not already unfriendly to them, would
only delay the triumph of those principles.
Commissioner and Councilman
The duties of a commissioner under the new
form of city government will be widely different
from those of a member of the city council, .and
the proper discharge of them will require a differ
ent degree of ability. The most important and the
first luty',vV ill' be the selection of a city manager.
and for this the commissioners must be men of good
judgment who must know a man of ability when
they see him and who must have some talent as
readers of human nature.
In this matter, also, the commissioners must
possess firmness. They will be beset by all kinds of
candidates for the position of city manager, and
some of them will be backed by personal and polit
ical friends. E very possible string will be pulled.
The aid of societies, lodges anil churches of which
they may happen to be members will be solicited,
and possibly obtained. There will be petitions filled
with the names of hundreds who have no special in
terest in the candidates whose petitions they have
signed. They will have only yielded to the Amer
ican weakness for signing petitions.
All these influences the commission must dis
regard. They will carry no proof and not even a
hint of the qualifications of the applicants. The
commission must rely entirely upon its own judg
ment, after a careful investigation of the qualifi
cations of all the candidates, and must not be mis
led into the belief that such influences represent
the will of the people. The will of the people will
be expresstd in the election of the commissioners,
who will thereby be dt legated to choose the best
city manager it can find without any further in
structions. The whole responsibility will be placed
upon the commission, and it cannot share it with
societies, lodges. churches and petition-signers.
And. here we would urge upon citizens to refrain
from embarrassing i lie commission by signing peti
tions in favor of any candidate.
Tiie owners of great private conoi 1 ns, depart
ment stores, railroads, banks and factories do not
hire their managers on petitions. The applicant for
one of these responsible positions must stand upon
his own merits.
Reside the U.ty of electing a manager, the
commission will have broader legislative duties than
the thy council. It will have lngcr powers. A
man who might be a fairly good councilman might
be a very poor commissioner. If Phoenix is going
to get the most out of the new form of go vt i n m n t ,
ii must choose its best timber for the commission.
Voters cannot afford now to tale into considera
tion the personality or popularity of a candidate
JOT
tic ci mai.ssien. inly two tilings are to nc cou-
sidered, the ability and th
dales, for into the hands .
int.grity of the can. li
the commission are to
be committed the m
I vital affairs of Phoenix.
Within, at most, the next two months, the can
didates will be named. That is not a long time for
the people to choose whom they want. The best
men v. i'.t net pat themselves forward. They must
be hunted out ami induced to bei ome candid itcs.
The campaign should be begun without delay.
Be Patient
l'.-caitse President Wilson in his message rn-g-iccted
to recommend national equal suffrage, suf
fragists sh..;:!d lose in ittn r heart nor patience and
should not indulge in thieats of militancy or eeii
agilely hint at it. Militancy in this country would
be a harmful fad. as it is a form of insanity hi
England. It would not, of course, reecho here the
sup port of the v,oi:,.r. whose courage, patience and
,;),:; have won the triumphs already recorded, out
111. y would b- held responsible for it.
Slate by state has been gained, and if the same
sane methods arc pi. i sued the roil will be ientghi-nod
until enough states will be Included to warrant the
hope Dt.tx ; national constitutional amendment would
be ratifb d. .ngre;;:; and the pr sident w ould not
then due to withhold the amendment.
We very much doubt whether, if an amend
ment were now submitted, it Would be endorsed by
the require 1 number of states. In fact, we feel
certain Unit it would not be ratified. It could hardly
be expected that a state which has denied its own
women the privilege of the ballot would support an
amendment to bestow it upon the women of the
whole country.
The campaign must be carried on as it has
been, state by state. Tiie defenses of selfishness
must be aiaaulted and carried one by one until the
chief stronghold of the enemy has been reached.
Militancy would almost certainly bring the move
ment, now pn g"i ssing rapidly, to a standstill. It
would put into the hands of opponents of suffrage a
new and mere effective weapon than they have ever
wielded.
FLOWERS OF THE DARK
After the last high cloud is ashen cold.
The last bright landmark dwindled strange ami
far.
They bloom across the dusk in broken gold
Beneath the fir-t faint star.
Some by the river, some upon the height.
One in a little cleft 'twixt hill and hill
Luminous, lovely, while the brooding night
Shelters them warm and still.
Homes, blessed homes! here clustered, here apart.
On the gray gloom unfurling, rose by rose;
Each with a crimson hearth-fire at its heart
Tiny tenderly unclose.
Till all the land's a garden fair and still.
And far, .a toiiing pilgrim I can marl:
One in a little' clert 'twixt hill and hill
My Mower of tlie Dark!
Nancy Byr.l Turner, in December Ainsle.'n.
NOW A HIGH COST OF WAR
Colonel E. Picard finds that the firing of one
shell of the French 12-inch naval gun costs
francs, or about $S7'. This amount is divided as
follows: The cost of the projectile, which weighs
about ;"0 pounds, is $300. The charge weighs about
1MI7 pounds and costs about $220. The gun costs
about 570.000. Taking the life of the gun at two
hundred shots, each shot would cost about 5"."0.
FOR LEFT-HANDED PERSONS
Enterprising manufacturers make various arti
cles for the special benefit of left-handed people,
besides scissors adjusted for their use, you can buy
left-handed screws, gimlets and other tools. And,
most thoughtful of all contrivances, to minister to
their physical peculiarity, corkscrews twisted the
wrong way, as a right-handed person would think,
for left-handed butlers and waiters.

TELEPHONE GIRLS' EYES

There are in the t'nited States about 12.", ooo
telephone girls, w-hose average term of service is

eight pi r diem: the average number of calls is
about 14i per hour, running "at the peak" to 22."
or more. The ..peiator sits facing a switchboard
wh eh is covered with numbers, each number hav
ing a small signal light that flashes on and off as
the call is completed. When the person calling
raise-- his receiver, a light Hashes on the switch
board at "central." and this light continues to burn
until the operator "pirgs" the number and receives
the call. She then plugs the number called for and
this light burns until the called person raises his
receiver form the hook. When the receivers are
finally replaced on their hooks, both lights flash
and burn until the operator removes the connecting
plugs. To comp'e'e one call means four flashes of
light. A s the- average number of calls is 140 per
hour, with -'-' or moio dur'ng the rush hours, the
ooorators eyes at" i posed to from 500 to lOaO
fluseu of light every hour, resulting in fatigue to the
eves, to say nothing of the mental and physical
strain urdef which the operator constantly works.
The Fell system, in 11.11. spent $70,tr.:5 for rest
rooms and lunchrooms for the operators, and it has
