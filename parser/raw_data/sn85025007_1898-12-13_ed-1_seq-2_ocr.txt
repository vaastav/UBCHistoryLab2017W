TUESDAY EVENING. DEC. 3 3.1898.
CONGRESSMAN HfiPBUBN, as stated
in the Gazette yesterday, od that day in.
troduced a resolution prohibiting the
admission into the Union of States
formed out of any of the newly con?
quered provinces?that is without the
approval of an impossible three fourths
majority oi Congress. Should this res?
olution pass, the gros3 perversion of
the declared object of the war?the lib?
eration of the negroes and scalawags of
Cuba?would be prevented, for if the
conquered territory cannot be formed
into States, under the Constitution they
cannot be held and governed as colonies.
the merchants of Alexandria have
gone to no little trouble and great ex?
pense in procuring large and attrac?
tive stocks of goods suitable for the
holidays, and it goes without say in ?
that they think it right hard that so
many people of their own city pass
right by their stores on the way to
Washington to buy what they want in
that city. In the earlier and better
days of Alexandria the people there oi
stood by each other and had more
community of interest than they now
have._
Nearly all the anti-imperialists in
the country who still persist in calling
themselves democrats followed Mr.
Cleveland out of the democratic party.
If their fore, had been as good as their
hind, sight has proved to be, they would
have known that the mission of the re?
publican leaders they helped to restore
to power two years ago, has always
b36D, and still is, to interfere with other
people's business, and to engeuder and
promote trouble. But fools always
suffer for their folly.
The Virginia congressmen who have
supported or who may support the
Nicaraguan canal scheme should know
that tbe people of their State are al
ready taxed to the full extent of the>v
bearing capacity, and are not likely to
hold them in kindly remembrance fcr
increasing their burdens by appropri
-auuiws or min.u^ ^n]i0,.,
for digging an interocean canal through
foreign territory, for the heaeSt of o
Northern stock company and a few
Northern ship owners.
Congress will make a large appro?
priation for celebrating the centennial
of the establishment of the seat of gov?
ernment at Washington. As the fed
oral government is very rich, but the
State of Virginia very poor, the largo
appropriation referred to would be
made with better grace if accompanied
with a small one to return to Virginio
the money she advanced the federal
government with which to erect the
public buildings in Washington.
.Mr. Hoar says, and truly, that the
Bolditrs in the volunteer army enlisted
in the Spanish war with the distinct
understanding that they would be dis
charged at the conclusion of hostilities,
and that as peac? has now been olScia!
ly declared, they should be disbanded
and allowed to return to their homes.
Mr. Hoar's party has always professed
to be in favor of the binding obligations
of contracts, but none is so prone as
they to repudiate theirown profes3ionr.
The repudiation of one part of Ihr
Dred Scott decision by the Northern
States brought death and suffering and
unutterable aud ttill existing woe upon
millions of the people of this country.
It is sincerely to be hoped that tae re?
pudiation of another part may not pro?
duce such dire results. But it is as true
of nations as it is of men, that those
whom the gods would destroy they firet
make mad.
A citizen of New York has been ar
rested in Germany and is now in jail
there for speaking disrespectfully of
the emperor of that country. He should
be kept there until he has had time to
learn good manners. The Germans
*did not ask him to come to their coun?
try, aad a3 he did po there solely to
please himself, he should certainly
have had sense enough to have pre?
served a decent tongue.
Senator Davis of Minnesota is in

f Corr*-s pondence of the Alexandria Gsxette.l
Washington, Dec. 13.
A well-known North Carolina poli?
tician here to-day says nothing is more
certain than that the legislature of
his Star.e will provide that the free ne?
gro schools of that State shall be sup?
ported by money collected from negro
taxpayers, aDd that all the railroads of
that S'tate shall be provided with Jim
Crow cars. This, he says, may posbi
bly induce the negroes there to realize
at least some ot the troubles their
preachers and white scalawag leaders
nave brought upon them.
Congressmen Walker, Thorp and
Wise, republicans, of Virginia, called
upon the President yesterday and
poured :nto bis ear their respective
tale of woe, concerning the avaricious
manner in which the executive com?
mittee of the republican party of their
State had seized upon the federal pa?
tronage there, though they had done
nothing to help the party at the last
election, and the little consideration
that had been paid to the men who had
then striven tobring out the republioan
vote and who always had borne will?
ingly the toil of the day in the republi?
can cause without recompense. Mr.
McKinley listened patiently to all they
had to say. but did nothing to prolong
the interview, and though be seemed
to agree that they had had slim rations,
he did not intimate that he would give
them any more.
Congressman Bailey, who was to
have accompanied the President on his
Southern trip and to have responded to
a toast at the banquet to be given that
party at Atlanta, coulri not go in con?

Mr. Settle, of Kentucky, went in his
place. The toast to which be was to
have responded was: "Patriotism
knows no minority."
Congressmen Jones and Lamb, of
Virginia, called upon the Comptroller
of the Treasury to-day to see if he would
not fulfill the" President's promise to
pay Virginia tho amount she ex?
pended in equipping Virginia troops for
the Spanish war.
House elections committee No^3 met
this morning, but only two of the re?
publican members were present, one of
whom was Mr. Walker of Virginia. It
was practically agreed that none of the
contested elected cases should be con?
sidered until after the holidays, at least
Mr. Walker said he, individually.would
nor insist upon calling any of them up
until then, and as he is the most ven
om?s of all the republican members, it
is supposed that uot until January, il
then, will any of those cases be finally
disposed of.

with troops pulled out of the depol.

THE BATTLE OF FREDERICKS
BURG.
December 13, 1S62, thirty-six years
ago, "The Battle of Fredericksburg''
was ushered in with heavy cannonad?
ing all along the line. Tbe 17th regi?
ment, Virginia Infantry, being about
tbe centre of the Confederate liue, was
not actively engaged, but only enjoyed
a harmless shelling. It was a cold day,
and we stood in line all day expecting
an assault. On our right we haw sev?
eral lines of federals melt away under
a galling fire from Jackson's men. On
our left we could hear the heavy fire oi
tbe artillery from Marye's Hill, where
the federals charged up against
that wing of our army, leaviug many
dead aud wounded, who laid there all
day and Dight, presenting next day a
ghastly sight. Breastworks had been
made of the dead, when charge after
charge was made by the federals. The
battle was one of the hardest and most
hotly contested in the war. It wis
a Confederate victory. Get). A. E
Burnside, commanding th9 federals,
had a splendidly equipped army of over
140,000 men. The Confederates under
Lee and Jackson, had about 52,000
men. The forces actually engaged on
the federal side I do not, know. Gen.
Lee reports that only 20,000 of the Con?
federates were actively engaged. The
federal loss as reported was 12-i officers
