SAhfS BARONESS HUARD
French Woman, Born Here,
Tells How Germans Wrecked
Her Home
PUT JAM IN HER PIANO
Staff Officers Thought It Funny to
Wear Her Lingerie and Carted
j Away Valuables
I
By M'LISS
They lut Jam into lier lieloteil piano
and they conccleil It to tie excruciat
ingly funny Iv wear a lady's Intimate
lingerie, did Uenerul Alexander on
Kluck and his Ktuff, (iut then? arc not
the most helnoUH utroclt!e tlint the
Baroness Cliarles Huard holds UKulnst
the Hun leaders who tnnde her historic
chateau their headnuartcrH In tlie mi
uccestiful drhe ugalnst Paris.
Tho charming llaronets Is an Ameri
can girl by hlrlli, but a Krchcliw oman
by virtue of having married a Baron,
who Is with her In rhlladclnhla. She
!h tho daughter of a nut he. I'hlladel
plilan Francis Wilson, the aclcr but
lier chief claim to fame, pcrhapi. Is that
she Is tho author of two of tho most
graphic ur books that hue been writ
ten by u woman "My Home on the
Field of Honor" and "My Homo on the
jl'icld of Mercy."
It was a Teutonlcally funny word
picture that tho Ilaruness painted for
mo In her apartments at the Uelleue
Btratford, with her husband supplement
ing a stroke now and then from the
vantage point of the dlan on which he
reclined. I)ono In blaik nnd whitest
might hae served us an Illustration for
those Teutonlcally funny comics that
our kultured enemy so delight In "Sim
pllclsslmus," for Instance.
VOX KLUCK A VANDAL
It might hao been entitled "Von
Kiuclc and His Aides at I'lay." To those
of us who hao seen tho newspaper
pictures of the generul whoso hordes
were beaten back at the Manic, he seems
a regular Prussian, with beetling brows
and uncompromising mustaUie, u gen
eral smothered In gold laic and military
decorations.
To tho Uarones-., In- is a andal and
a bcatt of decadent humor, who befouled
her beautiful homo at Vlllkis.
"Wo heard that tho IJcnn.ins were
really coming," she mounted her night.
ana ner dark ejes iiiazed lire at tlm
recollection, "but we didn't believe It
until tho refugees began pouting In
Uven then I was reluctant to go, hut
when I heard their stories, I prepared
for flight my husband was then In the
army.
"Tho Germans wero but two hours
awn) licrde.s of them. I (led South,
walking 15(r miles. I left everything
behind.
"Nino dais later, the Cicrmansvere
driven back and 1 returned. My
chateau had been mado the staff head
quarters for Von Kluck. The destruc
tion that they had wreaked on m beau
tiful homo Is Indescribable. They poured
Jam Into the piano, shot Into costly
mirrors. They wore my intlmat lin
gerie and what they couldn't get Into
they used to wlpo the pots and pans
with.
"When they were repulsed they saiked
the stables and ended by requisitioning
the town hearse on which they carted
away my art treasures nnd evir thing
of monetary value On the top of the
hearse they put the tow n's most notorious
woman, and that was how they de
parted. That Is German humor In war
time." '
The Baroness Is a beautiful woman,
with a Spanish cast of countenance. Her
dark hair, which matches her eyes In
color, Is straight and lustrous and Is
combed back from her face with a
severe simplicity that manages to en
hance her loveliness. ,
INTKRPnUTER KOK BUITISH
At the end of her flight when, weiry
and footsore, she expected to rest, she
was commandeered by a British regi
ment, the officers of which could speak
no French or German and was taken
along with tho regiment as otllclal In
terpreter. Later she converted her
desecrated home Into a Ked Cross hos
pital, but was forced to remove the sym
bol of humanity from it, because that
happened to bo one of the particular tar
gets the German airmen wero Interested
In aiming at.
The Baron, who was Incapacitated In
the war, has been sent to America to
iakVcrmrte of the official waf relic of
Prance. Ha la an artist of distinction.
"It la going to be a very long war,"
he said, when the Baroness referred my
question to htm, "and I am afraid you
Americana do not qujte rcatlte that even
yet, but you will.
"Wo aro very fond of ou Americans
and our President Wilson Is simply
adored In Paris. Your President's last
message to your Congress that will be
cheered In France. It was a great mes
sage, a great piece of Idealism, and It
was Just what wo needed at this llmo
a statement of war alms."
t "But jou ought to ask my maid," the
Baroness Interjected, "what she thinks
about "peace without victory.' She has
lost a husband, two brothers and tlvo
nephews In the war. When I explained
to her about 'peace without victory' she
said very quietly, 'But, madame, then
why did they die?'"
The Baroness sKko at the Academy
of Music last night under the auspices
of the National League for Woman's
Service.

CONCOHD, N. C. Dec. 7
Gaston 11. Means Is still telling tho
story of his llfo In an effort to (onvlnee
.the Jury trlng him for tho murder of
Mrs. Maude A. King of his Innocence.
For more than live hours jeslerday the
defendant was on the stand and told of
hs marvelous accomplishments as a
financial wizard and a "conlldentlal In
vestigator." Ills unctuous maimer did not win
favor with the courtroom audience and
It Is doubtful whether It went across
with the Jury. By tho middle of tho t
arternoou the courtroom, whU.h up to
this time has been packed and Jammed,
was almost empty, only a few rows
being occupied
Counsel for Means attempted to cut
him off several times, but still ho ram
bled on In fact, counsel for the de
fense and the defendant did not get
along at all well. Onco K T. Canslcr,
the examining attorney, referred lo. his
client at "Gaston Means" and the de
fendant leaned over and said, "Mr. Gas
ton Means, please."
Means worked upon tho jury all da.v
long. He directed most of his stoi to
number twelve and It seemed to be effec
tive. Number one was hl'i nemesis,
however, and at one stage of the game,
ta'klng directly to this Juror, the wit
ness offered four explanations to a ques
tion In quick succession and then seemed
to fall to Impress tho Juror.
It is expected that Means will bo ill
tho hands of the cross-examiners by
nfternoou Tho Stato his made no ob
jections' and has given tha defendant
every opportunity lo "hang himself"
Assistant District Attorney John T '
Doollng is preparing to make the inin
examluatlon and Is In a lighting mood
Means has taken every opporluull to
explain to tho Jury that Doollng has his
papers and records and has lnf rred
that Doollng has the papers Illegally.
Through clever legal fencing the defenso
has secured possession cf somo of tho
pipers nnd Doollng is In no mood to be
trllltd with and it strenuous grilling Is In
prospect for the defendant.
The wife of the defendant will follow
him on the stand. It Is expected Counsel
for the defense Is also seriously consid
ering placing Mrs. May C Mtlvln, sister
of Mrs. King, on the stand also The
State holies for this, because they con
sider Mrs. Melvln the most vulnerable
point In tho defense.
