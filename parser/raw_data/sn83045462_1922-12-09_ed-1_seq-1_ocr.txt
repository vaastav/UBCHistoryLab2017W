LONDON, December 0.?Premier
Foincare, toward the close of the !
first session of the conference of
allied premiers here today, is underKtnrwi
tn have said that France would
c onsent to a moratorium of two years
for Germany if certain economic
guarantees accompanied it.
The premiers held a two-hour
session this afternoon, adjourning
for luncheon shortly before 2 p.m.
The heads of all four delegations?
British, French, Italian and Belgian
?addressed the gathering. Premier
Poincare of France holding the t
floor the longest.
While Premier Poincare was reported
not to have reached the point j
of definite proposals, he declared the j
reparations question had arrived at j
a stage where something radical
must be done. He came prepared, he J
said, to discuss with the others what '
action should be taken. France's j
great interests, he insisted, must be j
lecognized.
Those present besides the premiers .
were the finance ministers of Great i
Britain. France and Belgium, Count j
do Saint Aulaire, the French am- j
bassador: Foreign Minister Jasj>ar
of Belgium and the Italian mem- |
bers of the reparations commission. {
Poincare in Good Spirits.
I M. Poincare appeared perturbed i
I whon he left his hotel for the con- |
Iference, having just made a denial of j
a charge that France intends to annex j
the Rhine region. He was in good ;
spirits, however, when he returned, j
front which the French attaches drew
the inference that the conference was
going well.
In connection with the conference it
was noted this morning that Karl
Bergmann, the German financial expert.
had arrived in London.
Premier Poincare. as? the spokesman
for the nation most directly concerned j
with the troublesome reparations;
problem, was expected to take occa- j
sion at the first meeting with Mr. <
Honar Law to state definitely that
France has absolutely no desire to j
take over the Rhineland. Members of
the French delegation believed that:
the premier would point out that
France, understanding the futility of
annexation of the Rhineland?a step
which has been suggested?knows
fully well that such action would only
create another Alsace-Lorraine and
eventually another war.
In the oplniion of the French, their
nation would only control the Rhine- I
land along economic lines? during the j
term of a moratorium, collecting taxes J
and running the railroad lines as a i
guarantee of Germany's promise to |
carry out the reforms that would insure
payment of her bill. j
May Have to Act Alone.
If It seems impossible to reach an j
agreement this time on the repara- '
tions question, it is believed M. Poin- !
care would say to Mr. Bonar Law, in j
effect:
?? tr are prepareu 10 agree 10 a
moratorium, but only on the condition
that we take over administration
of the Khineland and occupy with one
division certain parts of the Ruhr.
AVe want England to co-operate with
us, but if you don't we must act j
alone." 1
The French premier, it is apparent, |
is prepared to examine all proposals
for settlement of the German account.
but he is determined to exact !
guarantees. He will not look upon
failure to reach an agreement as a
collapse of the entente, believing that
the link between Great Britain and
France would remain unbroken, with
France temporarily acting alone.
Britain and Italy Silent.
A statement of the positions to be
taken by Britain and Italy in the
week end of conversations was eagerly
awaited. ITetnier Mussolini, arriving
here last night, gave no intimation
of his views on the reparations
question.
Mr. Bonar Law, it is believed, may
present no program, preferring that
the British government should maintain
a receptive attitude.
The arrival of the new German proposals.
which were reported yesterday
to be on the way from Berlin,
-was also awaited with interest. Unofficial
advices said that Chancellor
Cuno's suggestions included provision
for extension of the moratorium
granted conditionally upon the recent
payment of treasury notes to Belgium.
The extension, the German government
is held to believe, should go
beyond the Brussels conference, on
the ground that the future of the
reparations question hinged on the
outcome of that gathering.

Strong Views Recently Expressed |
by American Envoys Looked on j
as Infering Participation. '
]
Bj the Asuo^inted Press.
It can he stated on the highest au- ,
thority that the Washington government
has no suggestion to make to
the allied premiers In connection with J
this London meeting. ,
American Ambassadors Houghton
and Fletcher and Senator McCormick,
whose presence in London is referred '
to in the British press as having :
some connection with the conference, |
all went to the British capital on |
their own volition. I
Ambassador Houghton arranged \
his London trip from Berlin some,
time ago. His business was personal,'
although it is hardly likely that he
would visit the British capital with-]
out seeing his colleague. Ambassador
Harvey. Ambassador Fletcher's reason
for going from Brussels to London
just at this time is unknown in
Washington. The trip was not made
by direction of the State Department.
Not President** Recommendation.
So far as Senator McCormlck's London
visit is concerned, it was said at
the White House today that President j
Harding has no personal representa- j
tive there or elsewhere. j
The presence in London of the two I
ambassadors and Senator McCormick i
just on the eve of the meeting of the
premiers was viewed in official quar- j
ters to be a pure coincidence. As i
the "Washington government has no ]
proposal to make and is not informed j
in advance of the premiers* probable j
decisipn as to the Brussels economic i
and financial project, it is said there |
is no reason to attach importance to ;
that coincidence.
Doubt Over Brouela Parley.
It is generally doubted in Washing- !
ton that the British, French, Belgian
and Italian premiers would themselves
be able to say whether the
Brussels conference would be called
in advance of the conversations for
which they have assembled in London.
Unless there is a strong conviction
among them that such a conference
would be virtually certain to produce
results it is not believed likely here 1
that it will be called. j
In Unnil. n.Wi I
? ... ucui vvmnuaioi, j
Pending the formal calling of the
conference, and the extending of an
invitation to the United States to
participate, there Is nothing before
the Washington government with relation
to the project. In that connection
It is recognized generally by allied
statesmen that the Washington
administration cannot enter into a
conference for discussion of European
debts to the United States, as Con- j
gress has already placed that matter
in the hands of the debt commission.
It follows that the American answer i
to any Invitation to a financial and S
eannomic conference could be de- |
termined only when the purpose and j
scope of the discussion has been formollu

JAPAN ASKS ADMISSION.
Speculation on U. S. Participation
Again Revived.
By the Associated Press.
LONDON, December 9.?The possibility
that Japan and the United
States may be admitted to the conference
of the British, French, Belgian
and Italian premiers here this
week end is discussed today by the
diplomatic correspondent of the Dally
Telegraph. The writer says that
Japan has already formally requested
admission, and that although America
has not made the same request,
"this fact need not preclude consideration
of the point, especially having
in regard the strong views entertained
by Washnlgton and vigorously
expressed by the American ambassadors
upon certain aspects of the issues
at stake."
The correspondent suggests that the
four participating delegations may
devote their first exchange of views
to settling this question, the inference
from his statement apparently
being that if admission Is decided
upon, the United States will be invited
to attend.
CHRISTY PORTRA

Who hid Will Hays?
This was the burning question at
the Post Office Department today, as
visitors failed to locate the new
portrait of the former Postmaster
General, painted by the noted artist,
Howard Chandler Christy.

LAUSANNE. December 9.?Optimism
reigned supreme in Lausanne

had weathered what was probably
its most difficult session to date.
Ismet Pasha's statement yesterday
of the Turkish views on the Dardanelles
question and the reply it
brought from Lord Curzon, on behalf
of the invited powers, resulted
in a general clearing of the conference
atmosphere. Turkey has
apparently broken away from Russian

PASHA ACCEPTS FLAN.
Complete Solution of Strait's Control
in Sight.
BY A. R. DECKER.
By Cable to The Star and Chicago Daily Newa.
Copyright. 1922.
| LAUSANNE, December 9.?A solution
of the straits control question
appeared to be in sight. Ismet Pasha
has accepted Lord Curson's proposition
as prepared by Admiral Lacase
with minor modifications, and even
CommissaT Tchltcherin accepted it in
principle, although the Soviet's delegates
promised further attempts at
complicating or delaying the situa
tion.
Lausanne is almost gray because of
the belief that the most important
problem before the conference has
been solved. Ismet' Pasha declares
that he is happy, and Lord Curzon
looks pleased. The Turks say that
other and lesser questions will be
' solved quickly with the straits ques!
tion settled to their satisfaction.
One After Another Accepts.
One after the other, Rumania, Bulgaria,
Jugoslavia and Greece accepted
the allies' proposition. Lord Curzon,
replying to suggestions made by the
Turks, said:
"Guaranties against surprise attacks
and for the security of Constantinople.
the Sea of Marmora, the
Bosporus and the Dardanelles have
been studied by the allies' jurista
We suggest that the Turks get together
with the Jurists."
It is assumed that this refers to a
series of agreements between Turkey
and the powers. To the suggestion
of the limitation of naval forces in
the Black sea and th? nnoBQ^
small warships. Lord Curzon was
willing to interpret the agreement
liberally. At the suggestion of the
Turks the objection to the maintenance
of warships in the Black sea was
withdrawn. Lord Curzon agreed to
the suggestion that the merchant
ships be given free passage, but subject
to visit and search In time of
war.
Disposes of Observations.
The Turks made seven observations,
which Lord Curzon disposed of,
as follows:
1. The method of the defense of
the Sea of Marmora was referred to
military and naval experts.
2. The demilitarization of the Bosporus
zone should be maintained
with provision for the defense of
Constantinople.
3. Lord Curzon saw no objection
to the passage of troops through the
zones^
4. The questions or arsenals was
referred to the discussions upon the
military and naval clauses of the
treaty.
5. The width of the zones was to
be referred to the experts.
6. The status of the Islands was
to be maintained; as to demilitarization
and sovereignity only Tenedos
and Imbros were to be discussed.
7. The defense of Galllpoll against

PHILADELPHIA. December 9 ?
Georges Cleinenceau. speaking today
in the city where America's Decla- j
ration of Independence was signed,
urged that America come back to Europe
and help spread independence
throughout the world.
He was given a long ovation as he
appeared on the platform of the
Academy of Music. The academy, pro- I
fusely decorated with the Stars and,
Stripes and the French tricolor, was
packed.
Senator Pepper, introduced by
George W. Norris, president of the |
Philadelphia Forum, and governor of
the Federal Reserve Bank, presented
the Tiger of France as one possessed
. of "more than his fair share of the j
spirit of his fatherland?one of the
immortals, with patriotic spirit unquenchable."
Senator Pepper evoked a burst of
applause, when he asserted that, although
America had made no pledges,
France could feel assured that millions
of this nation would spring to
her defense It she were endangered.
Denies Militarism.
The Tiger professed himself as
"overwhelmed" by his reception.
"I have no mission," he began. "I
only came to tell you what I think."
He said lie had round, snorny aner
he landed In New York, that the
charges of militarism and imperialism
had not been believed.
"Here 1 am in the glorious city of
the immortal William Penn," he continued.
"A city of peace, and yet,
since Washington, also a city of war."
Peace sometimes can only be
gained by war, he said, asserting that
was the case in 1914, when the German
advance began. "If Germany
had ever suspected that England and
then America would have entered the
war," he declared, "there would have
been no war. That's a strong argument
for your letting the world know
now how you stand."
When the American troops came
home, he continued, they rejoiced
that "we're through."
"Alas, that is not true," he declared.
' What ! th? us<? of abuttine- th a pvon
and saying 'All goes well?' " I
"I've been accused of pessimism, It's
true?I think pessimism Is good, for
It helps you foresee the future. I
never was a pessimist for action.
Praise President's Message."
"Do you think it's asking too much
to let all of these Insane folks (Germany,
Turkey and Russia) know that
you will not tolerate their machinations
against peace?" he demanded.
Turning to the league of nations, he
declared he "did not personally believe
In It as a means to prevent war,
but he favored anything that would
minimize the danger of war. A wave
of applause swept the house.
The league, he said, had done some
itood, and he would be glad If America
came Into It, though he would be
equally glad to have her come Into
Europe on any other terms.
Referring to President Harding's
message to Congress yesterday, he
described as "great, Important and
noble words" the paragraph in which
the President suggested that the Idea
of the four-power pact in the Pacific
might well be extended to other parts
of the world.
He said he had told the President
when he called at the White House:
"I believe that when you ponder what
I have told you your feeling will
find its way toward us."
"And I Believe it nan ne aaaea,
"but I don't know what the diplomatists
will make of it."
Daty of America.
Liberation of the central European
states was largely the work of America,
he declared, arguing that the
United States ought to help maintain
the freedoms she had created.
Referring to America's policy since
the war, he declared the nation had
a duty to perform.
"Right without duty means domination,"
he declared.
Clemenceau said he had been told

Radio Marriages '

By the Associated Treas.
ALBANY, N. Y.. December 9 ? A
marriage ceremony performed by
radio is illegal, according to a !
construction today placed upon the

Attorney General Newton. The
words "in the presence" as contained
in the law means an actual

the attorney general holds. t
"It is an essential that the wit- i

to Abolish Hand

The House galleries were filled with j

and friends today when the fight started
on the floor of the House over the item '
in the Treasury Department apprcpriation
bill which proposes to substitute t
power presses for hand plate printing ,
presses /n the bureau of engraving and t
j printing, and which directs the discharge j
of 218 skilled employes. ]
Representative Fred N. Zihlman of
Maryland, chairman of the House com- <
mittee on labor, promptly made a point i
of order "in that this paragraph is not 1
germane to the subject matter of the
bill and that it is legislation on an ap- ]
propriatlon bill.'*
He based his point of order as to ]
germaneness on a decision by former i
Representative John J. Fitzgerald of
New York, then chairman of the House
annrnnriationa Committee in the Sivtv.
third Congress, in that an amendment
must be "akin to or related to the subject
matter of the bill."
Representative Sanders of Indiana,
presiding in the committee of the whole,
said that as this was in regard to an
amendment he did not think the point
of germaneness would hold. Representative
Zihlman finished reading the
Fitzgerald decision to the effect that
"If the purpose is to prevent hasty or
ill-considered legislation, or legislation
for which the whole body might not be
(properly prepared."
Representative Zihlman argued
that the paragraph concerning the
bureau of engraving and printing
seeks to repeal existing law. He ,
pointed out that the subject matter
is now before the committee on printing,
which has considered a bill in- <
troduced by the chairman of the committee
on appropriations. As there ,
was no action on that measure, Representatlve
Zlhlman said the chair- ,
man of the committee on appropriations
has now brought it in as a rider ,
on an appropriation bill. j
Representative Zlhlman said it at- ,
tempts to repeal existing law. It
proposes to remove the hand presses I
from the bureau of engraving and
1 printing and to substitute power '
presses therefor.
As regards his second point that It |
is legislation on an appropriation bill.
Representative Zihlman quoted a decision
by Representative Garrett of
Tennessee when presiding in the
committee of the whole House. That

that any member could offer such
legislation as an amendment to an

to such a measure "is and must be
resistance and defeat."
"The proposed measure means simply
the establishment of a general
subsidy system which will be fastened
on the country for an indefinite
period," the report contends. "The
whole tendency of the administration
is against encouraging international
trade. We cannot have cargoes in the
absence of foreign trade. Losses will
not be eliminated, because only a
small portion of the tonnage will pass
into private hands, as proponents of
the bill admit, even if it should become
a law, for years to come, and a
costly overhead will continue.
"It is perfectly plain that the ships
which would be chiefly benefited are
not the cargo ships at all. but passenger
and ships of other types."
The minority also said the legislation
would give the Shipping: Board
power "to build up or destroy ports, to
enrich or impoverish ships* lines, thus
dominating: localities, controlling: ship
owners, ship operators and financial
institutions, and the insurance companies
and all other connecting interests."
"This." it added, "would make
that bureau a political autocracy and
a dominating influence equipped to
work its own will."
"The effect of a subsidy." the report
contended, "will be, not to create, but
to retard the proper and permanent
development of an American merchant
marine."
Deadlock la Ended
Elimination of the Madden amendment
attached by the House and substitution
of the Willis-Lenroot compromise,
and approval of half a dozen
other important changes practically
completed yesterday the work of the
Senate commerce committee on the
bill. The consideration of the measure
is expected to start in the Senate
Monday.
The rejection of the Madden
amendment and the approval of the
compromise substitute ended a deadlock
which had existed in the committee
since it began consideration
of the measure Wednesday. The committee
acted after Chairman Lasker
of the Shipping Board had appeared
before it and had accepted the compromise
on being told that unless
either the Madden amendment or the
compromise were retained the bill
could.not be reported. Mr. Lasker
previous to his appearance before the
committee had declared the proposed
substitute unsatisfactory.
The compromise, which was suggested
by Senator Willis, republican.
Ohio, and drafted by Senator Lenroot,
republican, Wisconsin, provides
that the approval of Congress shall
be required for an increase in the
amount of government aid to shipoperating
companies over the amount
fixed in the initial contract. The

Harding a few days ago informed the
Senate committee would jeopardize

Result From Clemenceau's
Visit Here.
PRESIDENT GIVES HOPE
IN CONGRESS MESSAGE
Reference Hade to "Model Treaty*'
Expected to Carry Inflnence
in Futnre.
BY DAVID LIWKCMi:.
Germany. France, the I'niterf States
CJreat Britain and Italy united to insure
the peace of Europe just as the
four powers banded themselves a year
ago in a ten-year treaty to maintain
the peace of the Pacific?this may ye;
be the outcome of former Premier
Clemenceau's visit to America.
The aged French statesman did not
venture to make a concrete suggestion
to conform with the purpose of
his mission until he read President
Harding's address to Congress, in
which Mr. Harding recommended the
four-power pact in the Pacific as "a
model for like assurances wherever
in the world any common interests
are concerned."
Ratification Imperative.
When the Washington conference
on limitation of armament was in session
a year ago. the same thought
was put forward informally, but. so
far as American aid was concerned, it
was made clear that no such project
could be considered until the fourpower
pact in the Pacific had been.
ratified. Twelve months have passed
without ratification by France. Eut
the pact is now being1 debated in the
Frenclf f^rliament. and will be ratified
very soon, thus paving the way
for a revival of the idea of a European
treaty.
The French have not looked kindly
on the idea of including Germany iu
such a tranquilizing pact, but if they
are to follow Mr. Harding's model.
Germany must be included. The principal
difference between the fourpower
pact and other offensive and
defensive alliances is that the latter
were usually aimed at a single power
or group of powers. Instead of excluding
Japan, with which nation it
had been thought friction would ultimately
come, that country was included
and made a guarantor of the
peace of the Pacific along with
France, Great Britain and the United
States.
TVordiag tf Treaty.
In order to provide an exact parallel,
the wording of a treaty to tranquilize
Europe and yet conform to
the spirit and letter of the document
which had already been ratified by
the United States Senate, with respect
to one region of the world,
would be as follows:
"The high contracting parties agree
as between themselves to respect
their rights in relation to their interests
in Europe.
"If there should develop between
any of the high contracting parties a
controversy arising out of any European
niiesfion ami invnlviiif
said rights which is not satisfactorily
settled by diplomacy, and is likely to
affect the harmonious accord now
happily subsisting between them,
they shall invite the other high contracting
parties to a joint conference
to which the whole subject will be referred
for consideration and adjustment.
Conference Provided For.
"If the said rights are threatened by
the aggressive action of any other
power the high contracting parties
shall communicate with one another
fully and frankly in order to arrive
at an understanding as to the most
efficient measures to be taken. Jointly
or separately, to meet the exigencies
of the particular situation.
"This agreement shall remain in
force for ten years from the time, and *
after the expiration of said period it
shall continue to be in force subject
~ sxf OT... rx* V.;~W
tracting parties to terminate it upon
twelve months* notice.
"This agreement shall be ratified a?
soon as possible, in accordance with
the constitutional methods of the
high contracting parties."
The foregoing agreement is. word
for word, exactly what Mr. Harding
proposed and what Senator Lodge
and a two-thirds vote of the Senate
ratified several months ago. The
democrats joined with the republicans
to accomplish ratification.
M. Clemenceau doesn't see why
American interests in the Tacific
should be guarded by a treaty of this
kind and yet the much greater Interest
of the United States in Europe
ignored. He would insist, as did
Mr. Harding about the Pacific, that
such a treaty applied to Europe
u-mil/l not involve America in anv
obligation to use force or in any
commitment to a supergovernment.
t. S. Active Abroad.
America today is conferring and
communicating with other powers
about the near eastern troubles of
Europe and is playing a prominent
part in the sessions at I^ausanne. The
advantage of a five-power pact along
