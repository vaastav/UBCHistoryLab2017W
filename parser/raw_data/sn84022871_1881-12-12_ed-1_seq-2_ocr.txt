adventurous cavalry officers who by
their energy and dash rendered that
arm of the service formidable. During
the first year of the rebellion our caval

a match for that of the rebels. Among
these commanders none won brighter
laurels then Judson Kilpatrick. Histo

of the brave officer whose squadrons won
brilliant victories along the Rappahan

the feea.
COMMENTS ON THE
MESSAGE.
The Los Angelo, Daily Times con
tains an interview with James W. Sco
ville of Chicago, cousin of Guiteau's
counsel, at present visiting in this city.
Mr. Scoville gave an interesting account
of a personal experience of many years
with the assassin, and described him as
cold-blooded, selfish and thoroughly dis
reputable, with no other aim in life than
to become notorious. He expresses him
self very strongly on the subject of Gui
teau's insanity, saying he was perfectly
sane and has always been so. Mr. Sco
ville condemns his cousin, George Sco
ville, and says he desires the vindica
tion of the law in the speedy hanging
of the assassin.
The president's announcement of his
purpose that the star-routo rascals shall
be pursued with the utmost rigor of the
law will give general satisfaction that
is, of course, to honest men. But the
New York limes can't help wishing he
had made his message a little longer by
putting in an explicit condemnation of
the extravagant and corrupt system
which enabled the rascals to do their
theiving, and frank admission that the
good name of the country and of the ad
ministration, and the prospects of the
republican party, are intimately con
cerned in the success of the efforts now
making to bring the public plunderers
to justice. "It would be a pity," re
marks this leading republican news
paper, "if the star-route cases should
have no better result than to furnish the
democrats with a great deal of effective
campaign literature." The observation
is one of point and pertinency.
The Guiteau trial was continued dar
ing last week. Mr. Scoville introduced
considerable testimony tending to show
that Guiteau and his family were "in
sane," but he was obliged to handle his
witnesses with great care, as few of them
were willing to testify they considered
the prisoner insane when he shot the
president. The prosecution afterwards
used several witnesses who had known
the Guiteau family and Guiteau himself
for years who testified that they never
knew one of them to be insane. Guit
eau in the meantime was saucy, ugly
and boisterous, while he frequently al
luded to hi3 own insanity and remarked
that he should be in an asylum within a
few weeks. If he was abhorred before
the trial, his exhibition and acts during
the tria have tended to make him the
most detestable creature on earth. It is
thought hia case is nearly ended, and, if
the evidence is correctly reported, the
jury, except it contain some "crank,"
cannot fail to find a verdict of guilty.
The New Orleans Times has the
idea: The old opposing sections should
be cut so that there would be no north
ern and no southern parties. This has
been done in Virginia : it may be done
in Tennessee, North Carolina and possi
bly hereafter in Mississippi, South Car
olina and Louisiana. Let these states
be divided like New York, Indiana and
Ohio, so they shall not belong "body and
soul to any party, but will vote upon
vital issues for the best men, and then
sectionalism will be truly broken up.
Georgia and Texas on the one side, and
Iowa, Minnesota and Michigan on the
other, might continue to roll up their
vast party majorities, but party tyranny
would then be broken down and men
would vote on their judgment and Con
sciences rather than at the dictation of
a lot of party bosses. This would be a
true realization of best results of the
American political system, and it is to
be attained only by breaking down geo
graphical limits in all matters of public
policy.
News of the sudden death at Santiago
on Sunday of General Judson Kilpatrick,
our Minister to Chili, was received by
the State Department last week. Gen.
Kilpatrick was a man of mercurial tem
perament and unusual activity, who as
soldier, lecturer, politician and diploma
tist held a position of considerable prom
inence before the American public for
twenty years. The portion of his varied
and somewhat dramtic career which will
be longest remembered is that which
The message of President Arthur is
admirably written, calm and dignified
in style and tone, and advises Congress,
as it is his constitutional duty to do, on
many important subjects with a wisdom
and sound judgment which will win for
him the public confidence and for his
recommendations the attentive consider
ation of both houses. N. T. Herald.
Everybody will admit the president's
message to be a business-like paper.
That, however, is the faint praise which
people are accustomed to bestow upon
messages which are entirely pointless,
and as President Arthur's message is
by no means pointless, the stock phrase
fails to do justice to it. N. T. World.
The message is strongest on foreign
relations and finance : but it is not
weak anywhere, and it will be general
ly accepted by the country as a judi
cious, moderate and , in most respects,
satisfactory document- -N. T. Tribune.
The first message of President Arthur
is a very careful and well-matured doc
ument . Its tone is more frank and di
rect than is customary , in such papers,
and its recommendations, extensive and
varied as they are, show that the presi
dent has patiently reviewed the field of
labor so recently and so unexpectedly
opened before him, and that he is not
inclined to shirk the constitutional duty
of aiding Congress by his suggestions
and advice. N. TV Times.
The n;es3age is a well-written, business-like
document, marked by the char
acterestics that belong to Gen. Arthur
himself. It is free from novelties and
surprises, but is full of facts and sug
gestions. President Arthur must have
been devoting his days and nights, with
indefatigable industry, to the study of
the foreign and domestic business of the
government during the 1 1 weeks that
have passed since he became president.
New York Sun.
President Arthur's first annual mes
sage will stand with the best of the 91

not, and he has thrown about the entire
instrument a dignified consciousness of
his position as the head of a great na
tion, which is as commendable as it is
rare in these annual state papers.

CONGRESS.
Monday. The first regular session
of the forty-seventh congress convened
at noon. In the senate a large number
of bills were introduced, among them
one by Mr. Snerman, providing for the
issuing of a three per cent, bond to be
sold for legal tenders, the legal tenders
to be used in retiring the three and a
half per cents. The house was organiz
ed by the election of J. Warren Keifer
of Ohio as speaker, Edward McPherson
of Pennsylvania as clerk, George W.
Hooker of Vermont as sergeant-at-arms,
W. P. Brownlow of Tennessee as door
keeper, Henry Sherwood of Michigan as
postmaster and Fred D. Power of Vir
ginia as chaplain. Beyond the appoint
ment of a committee to inform the pres
ident of the organization, no business
was transacted.
Tuesday. Six senators were ap
pointed upon the joint committee for
the preparation of a memorial upon the
death of President Garfield. Many bills
of a private nature were introduced.
The house was not in session.
Wednesday. In the senate a large
number of bills was introduced ; Mr.
Morrill, 'of Vermont, made a speech
upon the tariff; a bill was passed con
ferring the franking privilege upon Mrs.
Garfield. The house was not in session.
Congress has adjourned until Tues
day. It is clear that little business
will be done before the holiday recess.
Every year a few industrious members
urge the lazy and procrastinating ma
jority to go to work as soon the session
begins, but the old custom of lounging
away the time until after New-Year's
Day it too strong to de broken. The
three weeks before Christmas are of
little account save to enable the mem
bers to unload upon the committees the
bills they bring to Washington.
Gen. Keifer is speaker of the House.
His speech as he took the chair was a
surprise. Although no fine specimen of
rhetoric or good writing was expected,
still such a jumble of badly-expressed
ideas and ungramraatical sentences was
not anticipated from him. Keifer calls
himself a self-made man, and he must
have made his grammar. No notice
was ever taken of the faults of his ex
tempore speeches, but his friends did
expect that he at least would put a
plural verb to a plural subject when ' he
put his sentence in writing. ' Keifer has
many good traits. He is a hard work
er, and a painstaking plodder. But he
has a hard head. He has no quickness
of perception. ; A bill or a motion whose
purport Sunset Cox, or Randall, or
Frye, or Robinson would see through
almost instantly Keifer can only com
prehend after long and patient study.
He will dig at a subject until he has in
a measure got an understanding of it.
Such a gift of plodding is a blessing no
doubt, but it doesn't avail much for the
speaker of the House of Representatives.
In that seat, if anywhere, the power in
stantly to grasp a subject, the gift of
quickness of thought, of instantaneous
reasoning, the intuitive recognition of a
a A? 1 ! 1
situation ana oi wnai ic requires trom a
speaker gifts which Blaine possesses
in such remarkable degree, these are
absolutely necessary. Besides a speak
er should at least have a fair knowledge
of parliamentary law and have the rules
and precedents of the House at the tip
of his tongue. These rules and prece
dents cannot be mastered as the rules of
grammar can be. They must be learn
cd by long experience. Many mistakes
make the best teacher. Keifer last win
ter attempted two or three times to take
part in a parliamentary wrestle and in
every instance he was sadly worsted
The man who should have been selected,
it merit deserved to be so honored, is
Kasson, and there is not a member of
the House on either side who knows
anything about it, who does not admit
it. Ihe stalwarts might have gone to
Kasson instead of Keifer, had it not
been rumored that Kasson was Blaine's
choice. By and by the time wiil come
when Randall and Cox and Carlisle
will make trouble for Keifer.
There are two or three men who
aspire to be the leader of the House.
Two of these members have some quali
fications for the place ; one of them has
none. Mr. Kasson will be respected.
When he speaks he will be sure of hav

wield a very large influence. He is un
derstood to have come back filled with

large ammtions to mate tor himseit a
record, perhaps more as a statesman
than as a leader. Kasson believes that
this is to be largely a business Congress
.aside irom tne contested election cases
ne aoes not see now any measure or a
very partisan nature can be brought to
issue, at least at this session. He be
lieves that the tariff question is going
to assert itself, but that it will cause
more dissension on the other side of the
House than it will on the republican
side. Kasson, therefore, expects to
take an active part in legislation,
Mr. Robeson also desires to be recog
nized as a leader. He is not without
some just claims for such recognition
for a man so beefy in appearance and
of so many physical indications of be
ing a high liver indications which are
said to belie him. He is a man of con
siderable quickness of thought, a good
speaker, rather convincing in his logic,
although at times a little too much of
the special pleader; has some knowledge
of parliamentary law, considerable tact,
and, moreover, has won a good deal of
popularity. He will nnquestionably be
very prominent on the floor. It is
doubtful whether he makes any mark as
a legislator. The excitement of the
floor, the inspiration which men of his
mold get from 6uch surroundings as he
finds there, the necessity for quick
repartee, and for the mental activity
which a give-and-take debate requires,
make Mr. Robeson more at home on the
floor and more influential there than he
could possibly be in the committee-room

cidedly bright, very quick to see a point
and to know how to make the best use
of it, equally rapid in discerning the
motives of the other side, and equally
fertile in resources for meeting these
motives. He is a fairly good speaker,
but he lacks just the one quality nec

Randall has enemies in his own party

Carlisle is respected by every man in
the House, and Cox is popular. All
three are watchful, not only of the gen
eral interests committed to them, but of
the interests of their party. Carlisle is
one of the strongest men who have rep
resented the democratic party in the
House for years. He has the makings
of a great statesman, and perhaps "by
and large" is regarded as the most able
man on the democratic side. Every one
knows Randall's qualifications, and no
one knows better than Sunset Cox that
his reputation as a humorist and wit has
shadowed much more sterling and bril
liant qualities. With three such lead
ers as these, and with the republican
vote one less than a quornm, it will be
impossible for very much legislation of
a partisan nature to get on the statute
books.

STATE NEWS ITEMS.
The first message of President Arthur
to Congress is a weighty document It
is not long but it is strong. In details,
showing great comprehensiveness ; in
lucid and vigorous statement, and in
plainness and soundness of recommenda
tion, it is difficult to see how it could
be improved. It is a masterly State
paper, and coming from a man new to
his office and still within the shadow of
a great calamity, it is plain that none
other than a man of large ability and
superior judgment could have prepared
it It is another and a striking proof
that President Arthur is meeting the
high expectations of those who know
him best.
The first important recommendation
of the message relates to the silver dol
lar, of which seventy millions are piled
up in the treasury vaults and uncalled
for. The President recommends that
the arbitrary coinage of two millions a
month be stopped. Of kindred charac
ter is the recommendation that the sil
ver certificate be eliminated from the
currency, and in this recommendation
the President shows the radical sound
ness of his financial views. The Presi
dent sensibly advises no meddling with
tho 3 1-2 per cent bonds, unless they
can be refunded at a much lower rate of
interest This indicates that Mr. Ran
dall's three per cent bond is not wanted,
in the opinion of the President.
The message, in view of the large
surplus revenues of the Government un
hesitatingly commends a reduction in
the internal revenue, restricting that
branch of the government income to to'
bacco and spirits, and the manufactur
ers' and dealers license. The President
weuld wipe out at once the tax on
matches, proprietary articles, checks
and drafts. The message also favors a
revision of the tariff laws, but wisely
suggests that changes should be made
with caution. If this Congress has not
time to attend to the subject, the Presi.
dent recommends recourse to a commis'
sion, such as is already proposed by
measures before Congress.
The recommendation of the Postmas
ter-General that the fees tor money or
ders not exceeding $5 be reduced from
ten to five cents is tacitly approved.
and also the suggestion that the maxi
mum of the order be increased from $50
to $100. If doubt existed anywhere
that the President means to follow up
the stat-route frauds, it is removed by
the pointed declarations of the message
that the President has "enjoined upon
the officials who are charged with the
conduct of the cases on the part of the
government and upon the eminent coun
sel who. before mv accession to the
presidency, were called to their assist
ance, the duty of prosecuting with the
utmost rigor of the law all persons who
may be found chargeable wh frauds
upon the postal service."
Many other topics are forcibly and
luminously discussed by the message.
Altogether it is an admirable, business
like and statesman-like paper, sure
rank among the best Exchange.
