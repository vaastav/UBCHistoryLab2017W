Father Hyacinthe's address at the Academy
Of Music is to ho the sensation of this evening.
Every seat, every ticket, was sohl nearly forty
eigiit hours ago, and the Father may expect
soch an sndienee as even the Academy has
rarely EkMembled within its walls.
Senator Williams proposes a bill forbidding
the withdrawal of any regularly passed appro
\al by any state of an amendment to tbc
National Constitution. It has not generally
been believed by Bepnblicans that such a Law
was necessary, but the Senatoi's purpose evi
dently is to make assttraiiee doubly sure.
The French treaty of commerce with En?
gland, which was ratified in 1801? can by its
terms be brought to an end next Petenary.
The refusal of England to accept certain nioiii
flcationaof It proposed by the Preneh,and the
growing objection to the treaty in ceilain
quarters of run??' point to that end.
There will he general and hearty pratilica
tion at the result of the interview, yesterday,
between Gen. Butler) on behalf of the lb-con?
struction Committee, and the ri-presentativcs

ginia is substantially settled; and the Ancient
Dominion resumes bei place In the national
councils. We bid her a cordial welcome.
Senators Ferry and Stewart wisely call, the
one for the abolition of Test Oaths, the other
fot a ?reneral ?Amnesty. They understand the
situation and the necessities of the times.
Whether tin* policy of vengeajtee and punish?

the purpose of _>ggravs?U?Mii Let us bring it

The Decline of American Shipping Trade has
been the theme of much investigation and dis?
cussion during the Aiitiiinn nionths. Yester
day the subject was before tin* New*Yorh ?- ? i i _> -
owners1 Association, to whom a Bpeeia] Com?
mittee made a report reviewing the testimony
taken by the Cetmsjiess Committee, ami
iting points for Improving the trade.
They oppose what they call prohibition mnl
over-taxation, which make it Impossible to

mentioned, ouch as recent improve-nents ia
machinery and reduction of th?- eoal <>f veseeli
in Great Britain, and the p? ?ponderante o?

It cannot certainly be said that the People
"of Color" aie anywhere contented with tin it
own ignorance ?ir indifferent to inU-llec.ua]
advancement. If they w? ic, WO should not iiml
them, as in Missouri, calling foran E?dneational
Convention, which will be held at Jcclfersoa
City on the 19th <?f next BDonth, for the pur?
Bjose of promoting " organization, comcntia
"tion, and unity of effort.* '' The Stale laws,"
they say, " have been made with tin- bt st m
M tentions, but they ?tie involved, coiupheatiil,
'? teiliou-, and need revision." There is leavm
fur doubt whether SUCh laws could Lave hct.n
made "with the beat intentions," bot if *?",
then " the beet intentions" demand their iin
niediatc amendment.
Our local reports set forth a eharge of ter
libio ciuelty to sailors by an Aimrican sea
captain. Only one side of the Kfory in told,
but if that be true it adds out* moro insiamc
t?> the long Catalogne of brutalities that dis?
grace whatever then; may bt: of humanity in
the otliit-r? of Sailing Veesela. The wonder is,
if these stones am true, that the hall-killed
victims do not often? i take sumitiaiy TOBfjanfC
upon their persecutors. No doubt tho stoiit-s
Brat told are in many instance?! highly i*x.ir>'
geratedj but they occur ho often, and wii h mi h
apparent pi oof of circumstances, that it i?<
hoovts tin- eontrollors and saembera of our
commercial iii.'iline, if pos.-iinle, to deal Uieiu
selves of such dUunstjrlng charcr?.
The DOW Census bill promises to provoke
warm ?lisciission ?in many points. Already we
find warnings of an impendi?;?* contest a? to
whether the next HetJJC ihal] consist of
tine?! iniiidrcd inemlee.s, or only two

Committee that the movement Ui take

and the swaming of fresh liordes of hvogry

The BjBWS from Paraguay and Montevide?
which we publish this morning confirais on
often repeated ??luuiou of the pniposs ef Brnsi
in the pnsent contest with l'araguay, am
shows thut the two lu 'publics which WSII
driven or cajoled into an alliance with her an
WBkiog ui> to a lively Muse of their owi
danger. They are clamming for a cessation Ol
the war anil a iiiptui?- of the alliance, ami tin
indignation which recently was poured sol
upon the ?U - ??ot "u- Lopes is now turned wit?
almost equal force upon the bloodthirsty ??Hi
, cere of Doiu PsdrOi The 4.ijii?iiieitd dis'.ricla yl
Paraguay seem to be virtually ruled by a Bra?
zilian pro-consul, of whom a curious and ap?
parently authentic story is told in our dis?
patches; and tho people of Uruguay aud tbe
Argentine Republic seem to have a well
grounded apprehension, that their own turn
will not be long in coming. The recent action
of the Colombian Chamber of Representatives
in testifying to the p<!oplo of Paraguay their
appreciation of "the indoinitablo valor with
"which they have defended their sovereignty,
"their iudepcndenco, and their liberty," shows
that tho voracity of Brazil is understood and
dreaded in other parts of tho South American
continent also.
Mr. Nathaniel Sands receives a testimonial
of which any man might be proud, in the let?
ter address? ?1 to him by many of our foremost
citizens, which appears iu our c?dumna to-day.
This letter is in acknowledgment of his ser?
vices to the cause of Municipal Reform, where?
with Mr. Sands has for years been conspicu?
ously identified.
We should, if asked, have advised that this
testimonial bo somewhat delayed. Our Muni?
cipal affairs are in such a stak' that we revolt
at the idea of congratulating oi honoring any
one connected with them till *o?i<; reform shall
have been clearly achieved. Surely, tho City
was never more shamefully misgoverned and
plundered by those who should be sinning ex?
amples of frugality and every civic virtue than
she is to-day. But, as Mr. Sands has recently
assumed an important ofiicial attittnle in con?
nection with the Common Schools and the
Taxes of our City, it may bo well to remind
him of the high hopes cherished by his friends,
and their esnflsVsnee tliat his future will justify
their most sanguine expectations. In tliit? view,
wo commend this correspoudcuco to general
attention. _
The maimed veterans who are on our Pension
List ar?: nearly all poor. They receive their
pensions once ?very six months. It is illegal
for them to pledge their pension papers in ad?
vance as sectility for borrowed money, and it
is illegal for any person to lend money on the
pledge of such securities. Yet the necessities
of theso poor pensioners, especially through
the pim-hing BCSBOM that is now upon us, con?
stantly compel them to resort to the usurer?
for loans. When? ver a money lender
takes the ri.-ks involved in this illegal
action ho charges from 80 to 4C
per cent, or Fnmetiincs even higher, for it
Tho only practical method of protecting th?
pensioners from tlieso vultures seems to be to
pay them oftener. Gen. Butler's resolution,
the other day, calls upon tho Postmaster-Gen?
eral to present a plan for effecting this pay?
ment, through the money-order system. This
seems to us a beneficent effort, and, if practi?
cable, should by all means be crowded through
at the earliest moment.
The Supreme Court of Massachusetts has just
?leaded a case which is of iuterest to Acculent
Insurance Companies. This was an action of
Perry, Executrix, agt. Tlie Provident Life In?
surance and Investment Co. The plalutilPs tes?
tator was disabled from his usual employment,
and com pen sat ion was claimed for thirteen
wci-ks at the rate of $10 per week. The testa?
tor's right arm was crushed between two rail?
way cars on the 11th of December, 1800, at nine
o'clock in tho forenoon, and ho died iu hospital
at tlie same hour on the nioming of tho 12th
of March, 1867. Payment was refused, on the
ground that Perry's injuries were "fatal." The
Court now gives judgment for the plaintiff on
the ground that "the terms of tho insurance
"?ire to be construed together; and by iujuries
"not fatal all injuries are intended that do noi
"prove fatal within ninety days."
The Postmaster-General, confronted by s
?Illicit at the end of tho fiscal year of over
live millions, comes to the sensible conclu?
sion that tho Department cannot make both
ends meet by carting enormous maassoa oi
mail matter all over the couutry for uotliing,
or BOZt to nothing. The sagacity of th?
1'ost master-General in finding this out it
entitled to the most respectful admiration.
Those who have been fortunate enough to gx-t
a peep at tho sanctums of many business ?ni?
ces, may have imticed there enormous heaps
of bundles, all marked " Pub. Doc.,r and ail

iu turn, send them io tho paper-mill. Whan

We now know exactly what it costs for an

crime, he is suspended from rank and com?

is to be contiiietl to the post of Foil Kulaiid
