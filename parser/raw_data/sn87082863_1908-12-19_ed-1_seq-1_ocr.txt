Wreck Caused By Broken Flange Flvo
Gars Thrown Entirely Clear of tho
Trade One Woman Killed and An-
- Tthor Injured Names Not Known.
In a wreck at tho eighty-four mile
post of tin? O'la Valley road yesterday
afternoon, ono Indian womau was kill
ed nnd another injured. The train
wrecked was a freight, No. 12, and ten
cars were derailed, five being thrown
clear of .the track and tho others lyiug
partly on tho rails. Tho wreck was
caused by a broken flange. Tho track
was badly torn up for a distance of
about four hundred icet and a great
deal of work will bo necessary to clear
the right-of-way. Last evening's pas
senger train was hold iu Safford and at
a late hour this morning it wob thought
the track would bo clear beforo noon
today and the train allowed to proceed.
The name of the woman killed has
not been learned, as most of tho In
dians on the reservation are known by
numbers. Sho and her companion were
riding on a car of lumber which was
thrown from tho track, and the woman
was crushed to death by the falling
lumber. The extent of tbo injuries of
the other' woman arc not known? but iV
is said that she will recover. Coroner
Rabinovitz of San Carlos was taken
to tho scene last evening to view the
remains of the dead woman and it is
probable that he will hold an inquest
today.
Superintendent Mallard last evening
stated that a train would be mado up
to leave at tho regular time this morn
ing if tho track was in condition to
allow it to pass when it reached the
sceno of the wreck. A train to train
to transfer the passengers of the
wreck-bound passenger train was not
sent down last evening for tho reason
that no crew was available in Globe,
all of tho men being out on tho road.
Another obstacle in the way of send
ing down an extra is tho fact that
there are no facilities for turning an
engino, nnd to back a train for that
distance is a dangerous matter, and so
it was decided to nllow tho train to lay
in Safford until the track is clear.
Nono of tho crew of tho wrecked
freight was injured, as the cars derail
ed were in thp middle of the train, the
crew naturally being in the caboose
nnd on the engine.

YACHT CLUB MAN TELLS HOW
HAINS FIRED SHOTS At
MURDERED MAN.
FLUSHING, L. 1., December 18.
The most dramatic story yet told of tho
flaying of William K. Annls was re
counted today in the trial of Thornton
J. Hnins, charged with being a princi
pal with his brother, Captain Peter C.
llains, Jr., in the killing of Annis, when
Herbert Funko, a momber of tho Bay
sldo Yacht club, told how Captain
Hnins, lifting tho swinging boom of the
Annis boat, and calling to Annis, fired
several shots nt him as ho sat nt tho
tillor.
"Thorc was a pauso after tho first
shot, then camo four shots in succes
sion, after which camo a single shot,"
declared Funke.
"It was after tho first shot and be
foro the other shots wcro fired, that
Thornton Hains drew his revolver and
pointed it at me."
Tho prosecution claims that Funke 's
ovidenco is another proof of the state's
contention that tho defendant was a
principal and was aiding his brother in
carryiny out a preconcerted plan to kill
Annis.
Funke 's examination lasted all day.
The defense will claim that as an auto
matic revolver was used, thcro could
not have been pauses between shots.

Inst evening by tho local lodge of Klks.
They were Harry Solomon, the Copper
Hill merchant; Walter Hcge, Jacobs'
gold filer, and Charley Clarke, the min
ing promoter. Your scribe was not
present at tho proceedings, but judging
from the appearance of the newly made
Elks at nn early hour this morning,
they got all that was coming to them.
Hcgo, attired in his bewitching Merry
Widow bonnet and trailed by a big
bunch of the strenuous clement, was
seen wending his way homeward about
23 G. M., proudly wearing on his man
ly bosom a fine nntlcr pin presented
by an admiring friend who desires to
remain nameless. It is quietly rumor
ed that' a certain young gentleman
prominent in railroad circles was book

single star performer at a future en
gagement. No excuses will bo accept
ed, and he will get his'n all right
about two weeks from last night.
WAR REPORT DISCREDNTED
-IN EUROPEAN CIRCLES
BERLIN, December IS. Ilotb the
German foreign ofilec and President
Castro discredit the roportthat Vuno
zucla has declared war against the
Netherlands.
The foregn office tnkes the ground
that even if htystlitics had been declar

fective, bccnfinc Vonczuela is in no po
sition to cai'ry a campaign beyond its
own borders! and Holland will not ex
coed tho limits of its retaliatory course
as already fxed and known to tho
United States.
Tho fecliJig is also growing here that
President 'Jaslro left South America,
not because of illness, but to escape
the political turmoil, and has no intcn
tion of evsr returning.

The state made material progre- in
the first day's testimony in the n g'it
riders' trial. Testimony covering the
details of the murder of Captain Rank
in and supporting tho identification of
the two prisoners as members of a
masked band was presented.
The prisoners, unkempt, scowling
nnd silent, paid little attentiou to tbo
proceedings. Only once did they be
tray any emotion.
Ono witness, who had been sworn
into the band against his will, testified
that the only part of the oath he re
membered was that providing they
would kill him if ho revealed anything.
At this some of the prisoners grinned.
Ed. Powell was an important witness
for the state. Powell was dragged from
his bed the night Rankin was murdered
and forced to accompany the band to
the Walnut Log hotel, from which
Rankin nnd Taylor wore taken. Powell

AND JME UP
LEMANS, December 18. Wright
closed a triumphant day by achieving
another record, flying to a height of
300 feet ip a strong wind and winning
the Sarthe Aero clulra prize for height.
At first it was thought the violenco of
the breeze would compel Wright to
postpono his effort, but be launched his
machine and circled around and around
tho field. When soaring at ninety feet,
a sudden gust of wind caught the aero-plane-,
causing it to plunge violently
backward. Spectators were terrified,
but Wright soon righted his craft. Af
ter ten minutes the wind moderated
and the aeroplane soared upward and
passed high over the line of rnptivc
balloons marking the distance of three
hundred feet. Then it decended and
after again circling the field was
brought to earth, 'landing in front of
tho door of the slicd in which it is
housed.
The Aero club tonight gave a ban
quet in Wright's honor.
This morning Wright broke another
record by staying up one hour and 49
minutes.

Important Figure, in Copper World in,
Statement Says Coppor Smelting Bub
inesa Is Annoying One and But Fcwr
Excluaivo Copper Smelters Working.
NEW YORK, December 18. Damcl
Gncgcnhoim, president of tho American
M'It;nsv& Refining company, today
i.t i'e pjblic a statement in which he
baid:
"Some years ago tho speculating'
public was kept in a ferment by the
cry of 'wolf in connection with sugar
refining stocks, due to competition be
tween tho Havcmeycrs and Arbucklcs.
It seems the people must be fed upon
something of this kind. As American
Sugar Refining stocks are now so large
ly absorbed and put away in boxes,
American Smelting & Refining com
pany's common stock is being specu
lated with in its stead. This will con
tinue until it is absorbed and put away
in boxes, unless some other securities
shall in the meantime becomp more pop
ular with speculators. There is nothing
now that I can see, or nothing of policy
in the so-called Ryan development of
the copper smelting business. A group
of gentlemen, known as the Ryan-Cole
crowd, and their following, have been
for many years in tho copper mining
and smelting business. They arc great
believers in copper as a metal, and so
am I. Whether or not they hac now
formed a largo company for the pur
pose of taking in other interests or
for the purpose of building new smelt?
ers and liuying new mines is nothing
new, nor is it anything that tho Aroer:
ican Smelting & Refining company's
shareholders need look upon with any
enncern whatever, because the Amcr- ,
ican 1SmcItinr & Refining company lias
not n single exclusive copper smelter in
the United States.
"The American Smelter Securities
company hns only one exclusive copper
smelter in the United States and neith
er of these companies is likely to have
in the near future any more exclusive
copper commission smelters, because
they look upon copper smelters as an
extremely annoying business."
Speculation as to theh controlling in
fluence in the company reported as
about to build smelting plants in com
petition with the American Smelting &
Refining company continued today and
in certain supposedly well informed cir- -cles
it was said with assurance that ,
this backing was none other than the
copper interests of tho Standard Oil-
company.
