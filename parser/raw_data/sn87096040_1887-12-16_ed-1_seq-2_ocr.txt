TUB latest griirt joke is in the number
of bogus dymamite bombs now being
discovered over the country. The or
dinary mind fails to discover any
thing funny in such praotical jokes,
but "there is no accounting for
tastes."
Our consular agent at Piraeus, the
port of Athens, reports that Greeks
are emigrating to this country in
great numbers,and that most of them
are practically penniless and many of
them utterly worthless. Our emigra

sharp watch fdr them.
The Bonapartes delicately hinted
that one of their number could be pre
vailed upon to accept the Presidency
of the French Republic buttheresults
which follow upon making Bona

The unusually large number of
young men who have been committed
to the State Insane Asylum ol Michi
gan in the last year and a half has led
to the discovery that almost all of
them smoked cigarettes to excess. In
many cases it is said to be absolutely
certain that cigarette smoking was
the cause of insanity.
Sir William McArthur, an ex-Lord

General Master Workman Powder

reconsider his determination to retire
from the leadership of the Knights ol
Labor. As reasons for his resignation
he gives ill health and general discour

the order.
Capt. Bunce of the Unit ad States
ship Atlanta is very indignant at the

that the changes he recommended
Were not such as to warrant the state

H. J. Taylor, who was appointed
United States minister and consul
?etieral to Monrovia, Liberia, has just
returned from his post. He is not
very enthusiastic about Liberia, and
said in Baltimore that he thought the
United States was large enough for all
the colored people who are now living
in the country. The population
Liberia lias decreased from 22,000 to
12,000 and development in every pur
suit is exceedingly alow.
In Den in ark during tho first five years
of tho system 116,483 cases were

Bamom. the great showman, seems
to be one of that class of people who
thrive by misfortune. He has met a
greater number of reverses than any
other man of the age, and yet he lias
attained a marvelous degree of suc

vicissitudes and suffered from extreme
poverty. He has been burned out in
two museums also his splendid sum

a playhouse and now a caravan. He
lost Jumbo by a railway accident. He
was ruined thirty years ago by the
failure of the Jerome clock factory, in
which he lost all that he had made by
Tom Thumb,and also by Jenny Lind.
He was at that time reduced to keep

on the wrong side of fifty he renewed
his efforts to become richer than ever,
being now the richest showman in ex

FliESENIED BY GliOVER.
rim President's Messnse Devoted Exclu
sively to the TailiT Question —A Reduction
of the Surplus Urgently Urged.
To the Congress of the United States: Yon
are confronted at the threshold of your leg
islative duties with a condition of the na
tional finances which imperatively demands
immediate and careful consideration. The
amount of money annually exacted, through
the operation of present laws, from the in
dustries and necessities of the people largely
exceeds the sum necessary to meet the ex
penses of the government When we con
sider that the theory of our institutions
guarantee to every citizen the full enjoy
ment of all the fruits of his industry and en
terprise, with only such deduction as may
be his sbare towards the careful and econom
ical maintenance of the government which
protects him. it is plain that the exaction of
more than tbis is indefensible extortion and
a culpable betrayal of American fairness and
justice. This wrong: inflicted upon those
who bear the burden of national taxation,
like other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil
consequences. The public treasury, which
ehotUd^Anly exist as a conduit con
veying Jthe people's tribute to its le
gitimate/ objects of expenditure, be
comes 9 hoarding place for money need
leBsly,withdrawn from trade and the peo
ples' use, thus crippling our national ener
gies, suspending our country's develop
ment, preventing investment in productive
enterprise, threatening financial disturb
ance and inviting schemes of public plunder,
l'liis condition of our treasury is not ul to
gether new and it has more than once of
lata been submitted to the people's repre
sentatives in the congress, who alone can
apply a remedy. And vec the situation still
contiuues, with aggrayuted incidents, more
than ever nre^aging financial convulsion
and wide-spread disaster. It will not do to
neglect this situation beoause its dangers are
not now palpably imminent and apparent.
They i-xist none Ihe'l'elsB certainly, and await
the unforeseen and unexpected occasion,
wnen suddenly they will be precipitated
upon us. On June 30, 1885, the excess of
revenues ovec public expenditures after
complying with the annual requirement of
the sinking fund (ict, was $17,859,735.84
during the year ended June 30. 1886, such
excess amounted to $40,405,545.20 and
during the year ended June 30, 1887, it
renched $55,567,849.50. The annual con
tributions to
THE SINKING FUND
during the three years aboye specified,
amounting in the aggregate to $138.
058,320.94, and deducted from the
surplus as stated, were made by
calling in for that purpose out
standing 3 per cent bonds of the govern
ment. During the six months prior to June
30. 1887, tho surplus revenue had grown so
large by repeated accumulations, and it was
feared the withdrawal of this great sum of
money tneeded by the people would so affect
the business of the country, that $79.8l4,
100 of such surplus was applied to the pay
ment of the principal and interest of the" 3
per cent bonds still outstanding, and which
were then payable at the option of tue gov
ernment. The precarious condition of
financial affairs among the people still need
ing relief, immediately after June 30, 1887,
the remainder of the 3 per cent bonds then
outstanding, amounting with principal and
interest to $18.-877,500, was called in and
applied to the sinking-fund contribution for
the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding
these operations of the treasury department,
representations ,of distress in business cir
cles not only continued but" increased, and
absolute peril seemed at hand. In these cir
cumstances the contribution to the sinking
fund for tb£ current fiscal year was at once
completed by the expenditure of $27,684,
283. 53 in the purchase
of government bonds
not yet due beariug 4 and^'a per cent inter
est, the premium paid thereon presaging
about 24 per cent for the former and
per cent for the latter. In addition
to tbis the interest accruing during
the current year upon the outstanding bond
ed indebtedness of the government was to
some extent anticipated, and banks selected
as depositories of publio money were per
mitted to somewhat increase tneir deposita
While the expedients thus employed to re
lease to the people the money lying Idle in
the treasury served to avert immediate dan
ger, our surplus revenues have continued to
accumulate, the excess for the present year
amounting pn Dec. 1 to $55,258,701.19,
and estimated to rpach $113,000,000 on
June 30 next, at which (date if is expected
that tbis sum, added to prior accumulations,
will swell the surplus in tho treasury tp
$140,000,000. There seems to be no assur
ance that, with such a withdrawal from use
of the people's circulating medium, our
business community may not in the near fu
ture be subjected to the same distress which
was quite lately produced Irom the same
capsu. And while the functions of our na
tional treasury should be few and simple
and while ito best condition would be
reached, believe, to its entire disconnec
tion witji private business interests, yet,
when by a perversion of its purposes, it idly
holds
MONEY USELESSLY SUBTRACTER
from the channels of trade, tljere seems to
be reason for the claim that some legitimate
means should be devised by the
government to rostore in an emer
gency, without waste or extravagance,
such money to its place among tho people.
If such an emergency arises there now ex
ists no clear and undoubted executive power
of reliet Heretofore the redemption of 8
per cent bonds, which were payaDle at the
pptyon of the government, has afforded a
means for tb .disbursement of the excess of
our revenues but tfiege bonds have all been
retired, and there are po boijda outstanding
the payment of which we hdye the rigjit to
insist upon. The contribution to tne sinking
fund which furnishes the occasion for ex
penditure in the purchase ot bonds has
already been made for the current year, BO
that there is no outlet in that direutioa In
the present state of legislation the only pre
tense of anv existing legislative power to
restore, gt this time, any part of our surplus
revenues to the people by its expenditure
consists In the supposition that the secretary
of' the treasury may enter tlie fparket ana
purchase the bonds of the government not
yet due at a rate of premium to be agreed
upop. Tfce only provision of law from which
such a power could bp derived is found iu an
appropriation bill passed a number of years
ago and it is subject to tho suspjsiyn
that it was intended as temporary and
limited in its application, Instead of con
ferring a continued discretion and author
ity. No condition ought to- exist which
would justify the grant of power to a single
official, upon his judgment of its necessity,
to withhold from or release to the business
of the people, In an unusual manner, money
held In the treasury, and thus affect, at his
will the financial situation of the country
and if it 1B deemed wise to lodge In the sec
retary of tbe treasury the authority in the
present juncture to purchase bonds, it
should be plainly vested ani provided as far
as possible with such check* and limitations
as will deiine this offloial'a right and discre
tion, and at the same time relieve juts from
undue responsibility. In considering the
iqne$t£oB of purchasing bonds as a means of
resttorii
ftpoumi
peculation the snip]
Iff tbp treasury, ft
»v
lus money
should be
borne in mind that premiums must of oonrse
be paid upon such purchase, that there may
be a large partof these bonds held as invest
ments which cannot be purchased at any
price, and that combinations among holders
who are willing to sell, may unreasonably
enhance the cost of such bonds to tho gov
ernment, It hafe been suggested that
THE FBB8BKT BONDED DEBT
might be refunded at a less rate of interest
ana the difference between the old and new
security pmd in cash, thus finding use for
the surplus in the treasury. The succemi of
this plan, it is appareut, must depend upon
the volition of the holders of tbe present
bonds and it is not entirely certain that the
inducement which must "be offered them
would result in more financial benefit to the
government than the purchase of bonds,
while the latter proposition would reduce
the principal of the debt by actual payment
instead of extending it. The proposition to
denosit the money held by tbe government
in banks throughout tho couutry for use by
the people is, it seems to me, exceedingly
objectionable in principle, as establishing
too close a relationship between the opera
tions ot the government treasury and the
business of the country, and too extendive a
commingling of their money, thus fostering
an unuatural lellance in private business
upon publio funda If this scheme should
be adopted it should only be done as a tem
porary expedient to meet an urgent neces
sity. Legislative and executive effort should
generally be iu the opposite direction and
should haye a tendency to divorce, as much
and as fast ns can safely be done, the treas
ury department from privato enterprise.
Of course it is not expected that unnecessary
and extravagant appropriations will be made
for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation
of an excess of revenue. Such expenditure,
beside the demoralization of all just con
ceptions of pub.ic duty wh.ch it entailB,
stimulates a habit of reckless improvidence
not in the least consistent w.ththe mission of
our people or tho high aud benciicent pur
poses of our government. I have deemed it
my duty to thus bring to tho knowledge of
my countrymen, as well as to the attention
of their representatives charged with tlie re
sponsibilities of legislative relief, tho gravity
o( our financial situation. 'Wie failure of con
gress heretofore to provide against the dan
gers which it was quite evident the very na
ture of the difficulty must necessarily pro
duce, caused a condition of financial distress
and apprehension since your lust sojourn
ment. which taxed to the utmost all tne au
thority and expedients within executive con
trol and these appear now to be exhausted.
If disaster results irom the contiuued inac
tion of congress, the responsibility must rest
where It belongs. 'Ihough the situation thus
far considered is fraught with danger which
Bbouid be fully realized, and though it pre
sents features of wroug to the people as well
as
PERIL TO THE COUNTRY,
it is but a result growing out of a per
fectly palpable and apparent cause, con
stantly reproducing the samo alarming cir
cumstances—a congested national treasury
and a depleted monetary condition in the
business of the country. ID need hardly be
stated that while the present situation de
mands a remedy, we can only bo saved from
a like predicament in the luture by the re
moval of its cause. Our scheme of taxation,
by means of which this needless surplus is
taken from the people aud put into the pub
lic treasury, consists of a tariff or dutv levied
upon importations from abroad and internal
revenue taxes levied upon the consumption
ol' tobacco and spirituous and malt liquors.
It must be conceded that none of the tilings
Bubjected 10 internal revenue' taxation are,
strictly speaking, necessary. There appears
to be no just complaint of this taxation bv
the consumers of these articles, and there
seems to be nothing so well able to bear the
burden without hardship to any portion of
the pepple. But our presents tariff laws, the
vicious," inequitable, and illogigal spurca of
unnecessary taxation, ought to bo at once
revised and amended. Those laws, as their
primary and piain effect, raise tho price to
consumers of all articles imported and sub
ject to duty, by precisely the sum paid lor
such dutiea Thus the amount of the duty
measures the tax paid by those who purchase
for use these imported articles. Many of
these thingB, however, areraised or manu
factured in jour country, and the duties now
levied upon foreign goods and products are
called production to these home manufact
ures. because they render it possible for
those of our people who are manufacturers
to make these taxed articles and seil them
for a price equal to that demanded for the
imported goods that have paid customs duty.
So it Uapppns that while comparatively a few
uso tho imported articles, millions of our
people, who never use aud never 6(iw ni)Y of
the imported products, purchaso apd use
thing*) of tbe same kind made iu this country
and pay therefor nearly or quite the same
charged price which the duty adds to tho
imported articles. Those who buy imports
pay the duty charged thereon into the pub
lic treasury, but the great majority of our
citizens who buy domestic articles of the
same class pay a sum at least approximately
equal to this duty to the home manufact
urer. This reference to the operation of our
tariff laws is not made by way of instruc
tion, but in order that we may be constantly
reminded of tbe manner in which they
IMPOSE A. BURDEN
upon those who consume domestic products
as well as those who consume imported
articles, and thus create a tax upon all our
people. It is not proposed to entirely re
lieve the country of this taxation. It must
be extensively continued as the source of
the government's income and In a readjust
ment of our tariff the interests of American
labor engaged in manufacture should be
carefully considered, as well as the preserva
tion of our manufacturers.' It may be called
protection, pr by atiy other ijame, but relief
frpiji the hardships'and dangers of our pres
ent tariff linys should be devised with espe
cial precaution against imperiling the exist
ence of our manut'aoturing interests, But
this existence should not mean a condition
which, without regard to tho publio welfare
or a national exigency, must always insure
the realization of immense profits instead of
moderately profitable returns. As the vol
ume and diversity of our national activities
increase, new recruits are added to those
who desire a continuation of the advantages
which they conceive the present system of
tariff taxation directly affords them. So
stubbornly have all efforts to reform the
present condition been resisted by those of
our fellow citizens thus engaged, that they
can hardly complain of the suspicion, enter
tained to a certain extent, that there exists
an organised combination all along the
line to maintain their advantage. We are in
the midst of centennial celebrations, and
wiuh becoming pride we rejoice In American
skill and iugenuity, in American energy
and enterprise, and in tho wonderful
natural advantages and resources developed
by a century's national growth. Yet when
an attempt is made to justify a scheme
which permits a tax to be laid* upon every
consumer in the land for the benefit of our
manufacturers, quite beyond a reasonable
demand for governmental regard, it suits
the purposes of advocacy to cull our manu
factures infant industries, still needing the
highest aad greatest cje'aree of favpr and
fostering pare tjiat can be Wfugg from
fpderal legislation. |t is alsp said that the
increase in the price of domestic manufact
ure resulting from the present tariff is nec
essary in order that higher wages may be
paid to our workingmen employed In manu
factories, than are paid for what is called
the pauper labor of Europe. AU will ac
knowledge the force of an argument which
involves the welfare and liberal compensa
tion of our laboring people. Our labor is
honorable In the eyes of every American
citizen. As it lays tbe foundation of our
dey'elopnjeut and progress, it is entitled,
without" alfectatipn or hvpocrisv, to the
Utmost regard. The standard of our labor
er'g life should pot fee measured by tliat pf
any other country loss favored, and
they are entitled to their full share
of all our advantages. By the laBt
census it is made to appear that of the
17,372.099 of our population engaged in all
kinda of indu«tries, 7.670.493 are employed
in agriculture, 4,074,238 in professional
»nd personal service (2,944,876 of whom
are domestic servants and laborers), while
1,810,256 are employed in trade and trans
portation, and 3,837,112 are classed aa em
ployed iu manufacturing and mining.
THE NUMBER TOO HIGH.
For present purppses, however, the last
number given shqnld "be considerably re
duced. Without attempting to enumerate
all, it. will be conceded that there Rhould be
deducted frpm these which it includes 375,
143 carpanters and joiners, gfjo,401 milli
ners. dressmakers and seamstresses, 172,726
blacksmiths. 133,756 tailors and tailoresses.
102.473 masons, 76, 241 butchers, 41.309
bakers, 22,083 plasterers and 4,891 engaged
in manufacturing agricultural implements,
amounting in tbe aggregate to 1.214.023,
lnavigg 2,623,089 persons employed in
such i^au^tacturing industries as are
claimed to be benefited by a high tariff.
To tfeese the appeal fa madp tp save their
employment and maintain their wogeB by
resisting a change. There should be no dis
position to answer such suggestions by the
allegation that they are in a minority among
gS^PSy5-*!
these who labor, and therefore should fore
go an advantage, in the
tuHre»frJ
WOOL.
Hie Itemoval or Reduction of Duties There
on Suggested, Supported by Kxliaustive
Argument.
The farmer or agriculturist who manu
factures nothing but who pays the increased
price which tho tariff imposes upon eveiy
agricultural implement, upon all ho weais
and upon nil be uses and owns, except the
Increase of his flocks and herds and such
things as bis husbandry produces from the
soil, is invited to aid in maintaining the
present situation and he is told that a high
duty on imported wool is neoeBsary for those
who have sheep to shear, in order that the
price of their wool may by increased They,
of course, are not reminded that the farmer
who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged,
in his purchases of clothing and woolen
goods, to pay a tribute to his fellow farmer
as well as to the manufacturer aud mer
chant nor is any mention made of the fact
that the sheop owners themselves and their
households must wear clothing and
uso other articles manufactured from the
wool they sell at tariff prices, and thus
aB consumers must return their shares
of this inoreased price of the tradesman. I
think it may be fairly assumed that a large
proportion of the sheep owned bv the farm
ers throughout the country are found in
small flocks numbering from twenty-five to
fifty. The duty on the grade of imported
wool whioh these sheep vield is ten cents
each pound if of tho value of thirty cents or
less, and twelve cents if ot the value of more
than thirty cents. If the liberal es'imate of
six pounds be allowed for each fleece, the
duty thereon would be sixty or seventy-two
cents, and this may be taken as the utmost
enhancement of its price to the farmer by
reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars would
thus represent the increased price of the
wool from twenty-five sheep and $36 that
from the wool of fifty sheep, andar. present
values this addition would amount to about
one-third of its price. If upon its sale the
farmer receives this or a less tariff profit, the
wool leaves his hands charged with precisely
that sum, which in all its changes will ad
here to it until it re-iches the consumer.
When manufactured into cloth and other
good3 and material for use, its cost is not
only Increased to the extent of the
farmer's tariff profit, hut a further
Bum
has been added for the profit
of the manufacturer under the operation of
thero tariff laws. In the meantime the day
arrives when the farmer finds it necessary
to wurchase woolen goods and material to
c:othe himself and family for the winter.
When he faces the tradesman for that pur
pose he discovers that he is obliged not only
to return, in the way of increased prices, his
tariff profit on the wool he sold, and which
then perhaps lies before him in manufact
ured form, but that he mu3t add a consider
able sum thereto to meet a further increase
in cost caused by a tariff duty on the manu
facture. Thus in the end he is aroused to
the fact that he has paid upon a moderate
purphasc as result of the' tariff scheme,
which, when he sold hiB wool, seemed so
profitable,
4.N INCREASE IN PRICE
more than sufficient to sweep away all tho
tariff profit he received upon the wool he
produced and Bold. When the number of
farmers engaged in wool raising is compared
with all the farmers in the country, and the
small proportion ihey bear to our popula
tion is considered when it is made apparent
tnat, the case of a large part of those who
own sheep, the benefit of the present tariff
on wool is illusory, and, above all, when it
must be conceded that the Increase of.
the cost of living caused by such
tariff becomes a burden upon those
with moderate- means and the poor, the
employed and unemployed, the sick and
well, and the young and old, and that it con
stitutes a tax which, with relentless grasp,
is fastened upon the clothing of everv man,
woman and child, in the. land, reasons are
suggested why the removal or reduction of
this duty should be included iu a revision of
our tariff lawg In speaking of the increased
cost to the consumer of our home manufact
ures, resulting from* a duty laid upon im
ported articles of the same description, the
fact ia not overlooked that competition
among our domestic producers sometimes
has the effect of beeping the price of their
products below the 'highest limit allowed by
such duty. But it is notorious that this com
petition js too often strangled by combina
tions quite prevalent at this time, and fre
quently oalled trusts, which have for their
object the regulation of the supply and price
of commodities made and sold by members
of the combination. The people can barely
hope for any consideration in the operation
of these selfish schemes. If, however, in
the absence of such combinations, a healthy
and free comnetition reduces tho price or
any particular dutiable article of home pro
duction, below the'limit which it might oth
erwise reach under our tariff laws, and if,
with such reduced price, its manufacture
continue to thrive, it is entirely evident
that one thing: has been discovered Which
6hoi)ld be carefully scrutinized In an effort
to reduce taxation. Tho necessity of com
bination to maintain the price of any com
modity to the tariff point furnishes nroof
that some one Is willing to accept lower
prices for such commoditv, and that such
prices are remunerative and lower prices
produced by competition prove the same
thing. Thus where either of these condi
tions exist a case would seem to be pre
sented for an easy reduction of taxation. The
considerations which have been presented
touching our tariff laws are intended only to
enforce an earnest recommendation that'the
surplus revenue of the government be pre
vented IJy tlje

gestion that in accomplishing this purpose
we may discharge a double duty to our peo

most needed and from sources where it can

are consumers with tho rest that thoy, toe,

that the price of the necessaries of life, as

maining to the manufacturer, after a neces
sary readjustment, should furnish no excuse
for the sacrifice of the interests of his em
ployes, either in their opportunity to work
or in the diminution of their compensation.
Nor can. the worker in manufactures fail to
understand that while a high tariff is claimed
to bo necessary, to allow the payment
of remunerative wages, it certainly results
in a very large increase in the pricc of nearly
all sorts of manufactures, which, in almost
countless forms, ho needs for the use of him

are subject to duty. Many of these. Jo npt
-in' anyAvay cbmjtar'6 with our 'own manu
factures, and. many are hardly worth atten
tion as subjects of revenue. A considerable
reduction can be made iu the aggregate by
ADDING THEM TO THE FREE I18T.
The taxation of luxuries presents no feat
ures of hardship but the necessaries of life
used and consumed by all people, the duty
upon whioh adds to the cost of living in
every home, should be greatly cheaj.ened.
The radical reduction of the duties imposed
unon raw material used in manufactures, or
its free importation, is, of course, an im
portant factor in any effort to reduce the
price of these necessaries it would not only
relieve them from the increased cost caused
by the tariff on such material, but the man
ufactured product being thus cheapened that
part of the tariff now laid upon such producL
as compensation to our manufacturers for
the present price of raw material could
bo accordingly modified. Such reduc
tion, or free importation, would serwc
beside to largely reduce the levenuo. It I*
not apparent how such a change can have
any injurious effect upon our manufacturer*.
On the contrary it would appear to give them
a better chance in foreign markets with the
manufacturers of other countries, who
cheapen their ware with free material. Thus
our people might have the opportunity of
extending their sales beyond hoinb con
sumption, saving them from the depression,
interruption in business, and loss caused by
glutted domestic market, and affording their
employes more certain and steady labor,
with its resulting quiet and contentment.
The question thus imperatively presented
for solution should be approached in
spirit higher than partisanship, and consid
ered in the light of that regard for patriotic
duty which should characterize the action
of those intrusted with tlia weal of a confid
ing people. But the oblfgation to declared
party policy and principle is not wanting to
urge prompt and effective action. Both of
the great political parties now represented
in the government have, by repeated an
authoritative declarations, condemned
the condition of laws which permit
the collection from the people o~f un
necessary revenue, and have, in the most
soli'mn manner promised its correction and
neither as citizens nor partisans are our
countrymen in a mood to condone the de
liberate violation of these pledges. Our
Se
rogress toward a wise conclusion will not
improved by dwelling upon the theories
of protection and free trade. This savors
too much of bandying epithets. It is a con
dition which confronts us, not a theory.
Belief from this condition may involve a
slight reduction of the advantages which we
award our home productions, but the entire
withdrawal of suoh advantages should nos
be contemplated.
THE QUESTION OP FREE TRADE
is absolutely Irrelevant, and the persistent
claim made in cirtain quarter that all
efforts to save the people from unjust and
inecessary taxation are schemes of so
called free traders, is mischievous and far
removed from any consideration for the
public good. The simple and plain duty
which we owe the people is to reduce taxa
tion to the necessary expense of un econom
ical operation of the government, and to re
store to the business of the country the
money which we hold in tbe treasury
through the perversion of governmental
powera These things can and should be
done with safety to all our industries, with
our, danger to the opportunity for remun
erative labor which our workingmen need
aud with benefit to them and all our people,
by cheapening their means of subsistence
and increasing the measure o'f their com
forts. The constitution provides that the
president "shall, from time to time, give to
the congress information of the state of the
Union." It has been the custom of the ex
ecutive, in compliance with this provision,
to annually exhibit to the congress, at the
opening of its session, the general condition
of the country, and to detail, with some par
ticularity, the operations of the different
executive deoartments. It would be espec
ially agreeable to follow this course at the
present time, and to call attention to tho
valuable accomplishments of these depart
ments during the last fiscal year. But I ain
so much impressed with the paramount im
portance of the subject to which this com
munication has thus far been de
voted, that I shall forego the
addition of any other topic, and
only urge upon your immediate considera
tion the "state of the yuion,'' as shown in
the present condition of our treasury and
our general fiscal condition, upon which
every element of our safety and prosperity
depends. The reports of the heads of depart
ments, which will be submitted, contain full
and explicit information touching tho trans
actions of tho business iutrusted to them,
and.suoh recommendations relating to legis
lation in the public interest as they deem
advisable. I ask for these reports and rec
ommendations the deliberate examination
and action of the legislative branch of the
government There are other subjec.s not
embraced in the departmental reports de
manding legislative consideration and which
I should be glad to submit. Some of them,
however, have been earnestly piesented iu
previous messages, and as to them, I beg
leave to reDeat prior recommendations. As
the law makes no provision for any report
from the department of state, a brief history
of the transactions of that important depart
ment, together with other matters which it
may hereafter be deemed essential to com
mend to the attention of the congress, may
furnish the occasion for a future communi
cation. GROVER CLEVELAND.

WASHINGTON, Special Telegram, Dec. 0
The president's message fell a little flat in
the house to-day, although making the tariff
its main point of discusBiou and leaving out
all other matters. It furnished no new
points and made no suggestions to congress
that would be followed. Straddling and
vacillating between protection and free
trade, if ploased no one completely. After
having a half-dozen experts at work during
the past three months collecting figures from
the latest sources, he supplies congress with
stale extritytg |ron} thtj' ceniins' of 1880.
Throughput it is a reply to a protection
stump speooh. It does not in any paragraph
rise above party. Members on the Demo
ratio side of the house, while openly prais
ing the message, were inclined to find fault
becausono plan of action was suggested.
The Bepublicans criticised the message
freely. Said a Virginia Bepublican:
That man has ignored our interests entirely.
With that document in the land in the last cam

D^NKIS-'HASNAFIN.
In the early and troublesome times on the
frontier Denny Haunafin was a prominent
figure. His hair-breath escapes would fill a
volume and included set-tos with Indians,
highway robbers, gamblers, blacklegs of
various kinds, and even included disputes
with bluecoats who happened to get a little
too fresh or presume too much on their
authority. If Hannafin ever came out
second best in any of his troubles the fact is
not remembered by the oldest inhabitant.
Gov. Hannafin is a consistent Democrat,
and what is stranger, is a Prohibitionist.
When Hancock was nominated Hannafin
went to New York to see him. He told the
adjutant general now far he had traveled,
und the latter seoured him a private inter
view. Mr. Hannafin's advice to Gen. Han
cock has been the theme of a good many
writers, but in nearly every cns"e what he
said was distorted or exaggerated. He did
not tell the general to "stand pat" as has
been so often reported, or any nonsense of
that kind. What he said was this: "Gen
eral. you have been nominated on your
name and record. The men who live in the
territories are natural politicians if they
weren't thoy couldn't live there. Now what
I say to vou is, don't write one letter on
the tariff or finance, and keep away from
New York."
If Hancock had observed this advice he
Would have come much nearer success than
he did- As it was. he thanked Mr. Hannafin,
and said he hoped to have the pleasure of
meeting him again when he could stand
more courtisies than he could at that time.
"Well," replied Hannafin, "you can rest
pretty sure you'll see me' again—if vou are
elected." Hannafin's faith in the outcome
was great, and the defeat of Hancock cost
bim in various ways about $20,000.
As remarked at the outset, Mr. Hannafin
is a great antagonizer. When Church ar
rived iu Bismarck utter his aDpointment as
governor hu was introduced to Dennis.
Being called upon by some one as an old
resident and a fellow Damocrat to make
few suggestions to the governor, Dennis
embodied his ideas in a very few words, as
fp.llows: ''Dakota is divided into four sec
tions—North Dakota, South Dakota, the Bed
River valley and the Black Hilla Wnat
you want to do is to antagonize every a
one of 'em and ail at once."
Speaking of this plan, Mr. Hannafin says
that after careful observation for many
years he has found that "civility is a failure
—always a failure with the leaders. No,
sir! step on their toes. If they don't like it
let 'eui take 'em out of the way."
It is scarcely necessary to
say that Mr. Han
nafin is a well known figure around Bis
marck and is about the first individual
pointed out to the visitor looking up the
Bights.

DAKOTA REWS NOTES.
A board of trade has been organisuru
at Huron with W. T. Love as presi
dent.
A writer in Bradstreet's calls atten
tion to the stupendous fact tha'.
when one-third of the area of Dakota
is used for wheat-growing, the crop,
with a smaller average yield per acre
than the territory has ever known,
will be 360,000,000 or 370,000,000
bushels a year.
The secretary of the interior has re
versed the decision of the commission^
er of the general land office in the case
of Alvina Yeutsch vs. Alzina Ryan,
involving land in the Watertown
(Dak.) district. This gives Miss
Yertsch, who entered the land and
made improvements, authority to
take the land.
The event of the season at Bis
marck, was the "Rooster" banquet
at the Sheridan house. About one
hundred citizens, men only, were pres
ent. Numerous toasts were respond
ed to and the menu was elaborate.
Judge Tripp has rendered a judg
ment at $3,400 for the plaintiff in the
long-drawn-out partnership litigation
between O. R. Betts and George E.
Letcher of Mitchell, formerly in hard
ware business.
A party of surveyors of the Manito

Halsted, Minn., the present terminus
of the Moorhead & Northern branch,
to Caledonia and thence westward.
Several branches of Lutherans in
the neighborhood of Brcokings are
trying to effect a union of sentiment
as well as of church service.
It is generally understood that tho

Cars Run by Electricity*
New York Letter.
One of the remarkable sights in this
city is in the Julien electiroal car rush
ing along in a way that excites a de
gree of surprise approaching alarm.
The car is the ordinary style familiar
on the streets, painted green with a
bell that rings sharply, and a big lamp
in front. The propelling power is in
visible. It consists of electricity
stored in tanks fitted under seats.
The car spins along at a very lively
if permitted, and i. under per-
rate,
feet control. It is stopped in lesstime
than horses can be checked, and starts
with a gentle iacility, and trains speed
as if motion was itw natural condi
tion and the rests were enforced. The
one that I saw on Fourth avenue was
gliding ahead, pursued and in part
surrounded by a great swarm of boys,
who seemed to be of the impres*
sion that they were witnessing a
show of magic. The street car
horses did not like the monster, and
pranced as if they proposed going on a
Btrike. The electrical car had a load
of passengers, and moved over ordi
nary tracks in a masterful manner. oi 'M.
course, if this sort of-thing can be car
ried on at a cheap rate, there will not
long be use for horses or
cables. There
is a difficulty, Iain told, in the cost
of the plant, and the question that
raises the uncertainly is-as to the en
durance of tho costly plant. It should
be noted that the cars I describe are
not run upon specially prepared tracks,
and are pot connected with wires that
are streaks of lightning from dyamos.
The running. machinery is of. course
peculiar, and tbe electricity is stored.
Electricians say that great advances
have been made within a few months
in the storage of electricity, and if it
I progresses a little further the applica*
I tion of it will be Bomething infinite.'
