I anama, Doc. 12. A report received
here today that the President had or
dered the policing of 1'anania by
American marines under United
Mates ollicers when the American
sailors land her during the visit of the
Pacific fleet next week caused much
surprise.
J.ast Wednesday prominent citizens
of Panama and the canal zone had a
meeting, at which arrangements were
made adequately to celebrate the
lleet s visit and at which plans for
protecting the sailors were made by a
.special committee. Un tins commit

It is said that exaggerated reports
have been published in American
newspapers regarding the death of an
American sailor, who during the last
days of President Amador's adminis
tration was wounded in a free light in
a resort and died of -his wounds.
President Obaldia ordered' a complete
investigation of the affair, and four
men are now in prison awaiting trial.

Colonel Goethals Gives Reasons for
Refusing to Widen Culebra.
Panama.. Dec. 12. It was rumored
in this city yesterday that Colonel
Goethals, chairman of the Panama
Canal commission, had given orders
that the Culebra cut be widened, but
the Colonel today denied this report.
The reason assigned was that at the
present angle the canal could never be
1rought down to the 4'-foot level
above the sea necessary for a width
of 85 feet. To widen the cut would
mean the excavation of 14.000.(100
more cubic yards. It was also de
clared that deep crevasses had made
their appearance on Gold Hill.
Colonel Goethals. when questioned
on the subiect. said the statement was
entirely without foundation.
"If the Culebra cut is widened." the
Colonel said, "it will be to facilitate
passage of vessels through the narrow
part of the cut. and for no other rea
son." As soon as the dry season sets in it
is proposed to push the work of re
locating the present Trans-Isthmian
railroad. Over 2.000 men will be em
ployed in this undertaking.
