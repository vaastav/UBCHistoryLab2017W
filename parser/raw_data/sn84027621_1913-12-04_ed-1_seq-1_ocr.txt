Making Another 3Iexico Ont
of the Islands
i
Boston, Dec. 4. "Shall we make
another Mexico of the Philippine Is
lands?" With the question W.
Cameron Forbes, former governor
general of the Philippine Islands
closed an address last night before
the City Club in which he defended
the policy of the United States to
wards its dependency in the east,
and warned against a premature
withdrawal" of control.
"President Wilson has started up
on a new policy in the islands," said
Mr. Forbes. "He ha's given the Fil
ipinos a 'majority on the commission
and appointed them to a few other
places which previously were held
by Americans. I believe the motive
underlying these changes is a praise
worthy desire to let the Filipinos
prove their merit and show what
they could do, and I do not feel that!. A. , , . A.
A . , i in the crowded bunks on the top
the experiment should be unduly
criticised, but that we should wait
with suspended judgment to let the
poficy have a chance to work itself
out and show what the result will
be.
Mut Maintain Stable Government
"Looking at the situation broadly,
there i3 one fundamental thing to
which the United States has pledged
itself, viz: To establish and main
tain a stable government in the Phil
ippine Islands.
"The real significance -of the Am
erican work in the Philippines has
been giving freedom to millions of
people really held in, serfdom. The
premature withdrawal from the is-
1 J J a 1 a 1 1
lanas ana me premature reunquisn-j struggling humanity. Despite shouts
ment of control will set back theof assurance from below three men
hands ol the clock, and undo the ,
woriv we nave aone ana return mese ;
. . i i '
people to the bondage from which i
we have partly delivered them.
"My recommendation is that we
proceed along what I consider the
only safe line of procedure, namely,
that of evolution, that we fill the
lower branches of the service with
Filipinos, let them grow up with it,
give them careful, wise and thoro
ugh supervision, and promote them
as a 'result cf efficiency, giving, them
only vhat is good for them, not al
. ways what they want.
Scoffs at Neutralization
"But let us not let go the firm an
chor of assured sovereignty of the
United States and try to tie up to
any silly rope of snd, such as 'neu
tralization.' Neutralization rests on
nothing more than an agreement,
and agreements among nations , are
kept only so long as it is in the in
terest of those nations to keep them.
"How, if we give up control, are
we to protect the lives and property
of the citizens of the signatory pow
ers to the agreement? To show you
most graphically the position we
should then be in, I have only one
question to ask: Is not one Mexico
enough? Shall we make a second
Mexico of the Philippine Islands?"

Dreadful Ending Brought Upon the
Outlaw, Lopez, by Kis Evil
Deed-;
Bingham, Utah, Dec. 4. No
sound since last night has come
from Utah-Apex mine, in which
Ralph Lopez, the Mexican desperado,
is confined. All the exits except that
in the lower level, were sealed with
doable bulkheads, and it is believed
that the gas-filled mine has become
the fugitives tomb.
The watchfulness of seven sheriffs
and more than 200 deputies, who
expected a break for liberty on the
part of Lopez, is relaxed, although
the number of guards has not been
lessened. It wa3 considered impos
sible for the Mexican to approach
any of the exits without being over
come. The crowd of miners who has
stood awaiting vengeance since two
of their number were killed in the
underground battle of Saturday, has
dispersed.
Before erecting the outer bulk
head in the outer tunnel, six men
went to the inner bulk-head, 300
feet from the mouth, to examine it.
Shortly after one of their number
staggered out overcome by the gas
that had leaked out thru the parti
tion! Deputies rushed inside and
carried out the other five, all of
whom had dropped within the tun
nel. They were revived, but it was
striking testimony of the deadliness
of the gases that filled the mine.
Thousands of pounds of wet gun
powder were consumed to generate
what is known and feared by miners
as "black damp." Sulphur, coal tar,
formaldehyde and black oil were the
chief ingredients used in addition.
Two hundred men are out of work
in the lower level as a result of the
smudging operations. The operators
are said to be suffering a net loss of
more than SI, 000 a day. They an
nounced however, they would gladly
remain idle a month in order to
bring about the death of Lopez. The
smudging will continue for twelve
hours more, perhaps for twenty-four
hours. It is thought the deputies
will not be able to enter the mine
before Friday night.

EliGUSH OPIIIIIS
Iresident's Menage Discussed by
the London Papers
London, Dec. 4. The Times,
which is devoting great atention to
the Mexican situation, is publishing
a free series of dispatches from Mex
ico City, calling serious attention
"to the desperate situation develop
ing in consequence of the attitude
of the United States," and declaring
that if the American tactics of
"watchful waiting" continues to be
pursued "there are no words too
strong to paint the disastrous results
which will ensue."
In an editorial on these dispatches
and President Wilson's message, the
Times says:
"We are convinced that these
dangers are realized as. fully at
Washington as at Mexico City. Pres
idents, like other, rulers, are not giv
en to betraying the secrets of their
policy in public utterances. We shall
be surprised if, when Gen. Huerta is
got rid of, President Wilson is not
found to have thought out' and be
ready to apply a plan for restoring
order and decent government in
Mexico."
The other London morning papers
note and comment the brevity of
the President's message. The Stand
ard and Daily Graphic see no reason
to doubt that the President's policy
will achieve the initial success of re
moving Huerta.
The Morning Post editorially ex
presses . the opinion that President
Wilson is too sanguine in assuming
that the downfall of Huerta would
solve the problem "and asks what
will he do should. Mexico continue to
be the prey of adventurous generals
and politicians.
The Daily Mail says the message
gains in clarity by conciseness.
"President Wilson's watchful at
titude," declares the paper, "has dis
armed critics who sought to at
tribute predatory aims to the Wash
ington cabinet.
G. W. McKELVEY DROWNED
Kissimmee, Dec. 4. G. W. Mc
Kelvey was drowned when he fell

fertilizer from the city, and Oliver
was later found drifting alone in the
boat and could give no connecting
story of McKelvey's absence. Both
are thought to hae been drinking.
Both are prominent truck gardeners,
Oliver living in this city.

HAPHAZARD METHODS
Used by the State in Trying to Drain
the Everglades
Washington, Dec. 4. A report is
in circulation here that the engineers
who surveyed the Everglades have
completed their findings and have
decided that the drainage of the Ev
erglades is feasible, but that the
state Is going about it without any
well defined plan, and in a haphaz
ard way that does not give promise
of success.
If such a report has been made It
no doubt has been submitted to the
governor at Tallahassee, and is not
a matter in which the federal gov
ernment is concerned. Both Senator.
Fletcher and Representative Spark
man said they never had heard of
such a report.
It is known that Governor Tram
mell came to Washington recently on
another matter. It related to the
Everglades, but had nothing to do
with any report that may or may not
have been made by the engineer.
