DUEL WITH A HIGHWAYMAN.
Chicago Doctor Manages to Escape
With $9,000 in Cash.
Chicago, Dec. 4.—A lone highway
man and Dr. L. C. Zeigler. professor
of osteopathy, with offices in McVlck
er's theater building, fought a pistol
duel on the prairies west of Garfield
park for the possession of $9,000. One
bullet ftattejjced itself again?4the doc
tor's wati h. just over his heirt, and a
seeor.d pas-sed through his silk hat
and tore its way through the nine $1.*
000 bills that were .hidden therein in
an envelope. The professor believes
oue of his bullets struck his assailant
in the hand and the police are search
ing" for a wounded bandit.
Some weeks ago Professer Zeigler
advertised for 400 cadavers to be used
for the purposes of demonstration at
the schools of osteopathy in Illinois
and other states. He announced in his
public request for bodies that he was
willing to spend $21,000 for the number
of cadavers he required and the police
believe it was the publication of these
figures that led up to the assault. The
police also iVelieve the holdup to have
been the outcome of a conspiracy, one
of the phases of which was a confi
dence game whereby Dr. Zeigler was
entrapped into carrying $9,000 in cash
on his person.

Charge and 'Begin a Thorough Ex­

and Have Continued Undiscovered
Until the Present Time.
Ballstcn Spa, N. Yi, Dec^-.^.—The
first National bank of this city has
•been closed' pending an examination
by a national bank examiner. It is
state" u the closing of the bank's
ioors followed the discovery of irregu
larities In tiie accounts of the teller,
Charl $ E., Fitcham. The bank began
busings lSo5. Judge J. S. Lamor
eaux succeeded George West as presi
dent early in October of this year and
H. J. Donaldson succeeded to the vice
presidency. The new executive offi
cers began at once a thorough investi
gation of the bank's affairs and discov
ered indications of a defalcation on the
part of Teller Fitcham. The investi
gation was pursued until it was seen
t&at the defalcation had begun-many
years ago anil attained lar^e figures.
Bank Examiners Graham and Va i
Vranken were sent for and Monday be
gan a thorough examination. At the
closing of banking hours they reported
a shortage of $100,000. The directors
theu decided to close the bank pending
an investigation and a warrant for
Fitcham's arrest was issued. Fitcham
was bonded to the amount of $1,000,
He has a wife and one daughter. Pres
ident Lamoreaux said that, it was not
possible to determine the amount of
Fitcham's defalcation without an in
spection of the outstanding certificates
of deposits and depositors' pass books.
The examination, he said, shows the
teller alone is responsible. Mr. Lam
oreaux added that it is not thought pos
sible that any loss can come to'depos
itors or certificate holders as the bank
has
a
surplus of $100,000r which it is
hoped will nearly meet the deficit and
leave the bank's capital of $100,000 un
impaired.
An examination of the bank by Ex
aminer Van Vranken last August fail*
ed to disclose any irregularity In the
accounts.
Fitcham is ill at his residence where
he is undef arrest and guarded by two
officers.
Stockholders Held Liable.
Milwaukee, Dec. 4.—Judge Elliott,

holders in the defunct Commercial

field responsible for the payment to
