!Much Space Devoted to the Financial
Question—Necessity for Cur
rency Reform.
Washington, Dec. 7.—The following Is the
?text of President Cleveland's message -to
congress:
To the Congress of the United States:
Ai representatives of the people In the
legislative branch of their government, you
liave assembled at a time when the
strength and excellence of our free Instl
xutlons and the fitness of our citizens to
•enjoy popular rule have been again made
manifest. A political contest involving
momentous consequences, fraught with
feverish apprehension and creating ag­
gressiveness so intense as to approach bit
rness and passion has been waged
roughout our land and determined by
cue decree of free and independent suf­
frage, without disturbance of our tran
qulQlty or the least sign of weakness In our
'Dational structure. When we consider
-these incidents and contemplate the peace­
ful obedience and manly submission which
have succeeded a heated clash of political
'-opinions, we discover abundant evidence
or a determination on the part of our coun­
trymen to abide by every verdict of the
-popular will and to be controlled at all
times by an abiding faith in the agencies
established for the direction of the af
'-'falrs of their government.
The Turkinh Question.
At the outset of a reference to the more
^important matters affecting our relations
-^rltli foreign powers, it would afford me sat­
isfaction if I could assure the congress
-that the disturbed condition In Asiatic Tur­
key had during the past year assumed a
less hideous and bloody aspect, and that
-either as a consequence of the awakening
Of the Turkish government to the demand
of humane civilization, or as the result
Of decisive action on the part of the great
-cations having the right by treaty to ln
•terfere for the protection of those exposed
-to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel
fanaticism, the shocking features of the
•Situation had been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcoming a sort
•ened disposition or protective intervention,
we have been afflicted by continued a*id
not unfrequent reports of the wanton
struct
ion of homes and the bloody butch­
ery of men, women and children, made
•martyrs to their profession of Christian
Xalth
Protection of Americans.
"While none of our citizens in Turkey
tiave thus far been killed or wounded,
though often in the midst of dreadful
scenes of danger, their safety in the fu­
ture is by no means assured. Our govern­
ment at home and our' minister at Con­
stantinople have left nothing undone to
fory,
irotect our missionaries in Ottoman terri
who constitute nearly all the individ­
uals residing there who have a right to
•claim our protection on the score of Amer
rlcan citizenship.
Cuban Insurrection.
The insurrection In Cuba still continues
•"With all its perplexities. It is difficult to
perceive that any progress has thus far
ceen made towards the pacification of the
Island, or that the situation of affairs as
depicted in my last annual message has
to the least improved. If Spain stlli hold's
Havana and the seaports and all the con­
siderable towns, the -insurgents still roam
at will over at least two-thirds of the in­
land country. If the determination of
Spain to put down the insurrecion seems
but to strengthen with the lapse of time
and is evinced by her unhesitating devotion
-of largely increased military and naval
forces to the task, there is much reason to
believe that the insurgents have gained
"in point of numbers and character and re­
sources, and are none the less Inflexible in
-their resolve not to succumb without prac­
tically securing the great objects for which
•^they took up arms.
Not Yet Entitled to Recognition.
If Spain has not yet reestablished her
-authority, neither have the insurgents yet
made good their title to be regarded as an
Independent- state. Indeed, as the con
•test has gone on, the pretense that civil
-government exists on the island, except so
far as Spain Is able to maintain it, has
been practically abandoned. Spain doe*
keep on foot such a government, more or
less imperfectly, in the large towns and
-their immediate suburbs. But, that excep­
tion being made, the entire country is either
given over to anarchy or is subject to the
military occupation of one or the other
®arty.
Why Spain Does Not Win.
Were the Spanish armies able to meet
their antagonists in the open, or in pitched
'••battle, prompt and decisive results might
be looked for, and the Immense superiority
-of the Spanish forces In numbers, dis­
cipline, and equipment, could hardly fail
to tell greatly to their advantage.
Situation Deplorable.
Meanwhile, as in all cases of protracted
-civil strife, the passions of the combatants
®row more and more inflamed anu excesses
•on both sides become more frequent and
more deplorable. They are also partici­
pated In by bands of marauders, who, now
In the name of one party and now In the
name of the other, as may best suit the
-occasion, harry the country at will and
plunder its wretched inhabitants for their
own advantage. Such a condition of things
would inevitably entail immense destruction
•«f property, even if It were the policy.
of both parties to prevent it as iar as prac­
ticable. But while such seemed to be the
^original policy of the Spanish government,
tt has now apparently abandoned It and .s
vacting upon the same theory as the in­
surgents, namely, that the exigencies of
the contest require the wholesale annihila­
tion of property that it may not prove of
use and advantage to the enemy. It is to
the same end that in pursuance of general
orders, Spanish garrisons are now beiric
withdrawn from plantations and the rural
population required to concentrate itself
Jn the towns.
Would Eogage Oar Serious Attention.
The spectacle of utter ruin of an adjoin­
ing country, by nature one of the most
fertile and charming on the globe, would
^engage the serirus attention of the gov
ornment and the people of the United
.States in any circumstance. In point of
.fact, they have a concern with it which Is
•by no means of a wholly sentimental
•or philanthropic character. It lies so near
to us as to be hardly separated from our
territory. Our actual pecuniary interest in
It is second only to that of the people 'and
government of Spain. It is reasonably es­
timated that at least from $30,000,000 to
450,000,000 of American capital are invested
In plantations, and in railroad, mining
and other business enterprises on the
jsland. The volume of trade between the
United States and Cuba, which in 1S89
^amounted to about $64,000,000, rose in j.893
to about $103,000,000, and in 1894, he
year before the present insurrection
stroke out, amounted to nearly $96,000,000.
Vexatious Entanglements.
Besides this large pecuniary, stake In
«the fortunes of Cuba, the United States
yfiiwin itself inextricably involved in the
.present contest In other ways both vex­
atious and costly. Many Cubans reside in
tthis- country and Indirectly promote the
•insurrection through the press, by public
meetings, by the purchase and shipment of
arms, by the raising of funds and by other
•means, which the spirit of our institutions
tand the tenor of our laws do not permit
ito be made the subject of criminal proseeu
»ns. Some of them, though Cubans at
sart and in all their feelings and interests,
jive taken out papers.as naturalized citi­
zens of the United States, a proceeding re­
ported to with a view to possible protec­
tion by this government, and not unnat­
urally regarded with much indignation by
Abe country of their origin.
Tlie Question of Intervention.
These inevitable entanglements of the
United States with the rebellion In Cuba,
the large American property Interests af­
fected and considerations of philanthropy
and humanity In general have led to a ve­
hement demand Id various quarters for
tome sort of positive intervention on
the part of the United States. It was at
first proposed that belligerent rights should
be accorded to the insurgents—a propo­
sition no longer urged because untimely
and In practical operation clearly perilous
and Injurious to our own Interests. It has
since been and is now sometimes contended
that the Independence of the Insurgents
should be recognized. But Imperfect and
restricted as the Spanish government of
the island may be, no other exlsts_there—
unless the will or the military officer In
temporary command of a particular dis­
trict can be dignified as a species of gov­
ernment. It is now also suggested that the
United States should buy the island—a sug­
gestion possibly worthy of consideration
if there were any evidence of a desire or
willingness on the part of Spain to enter­
tain such a proposal. It is urged, finally,
that, all other methods falling, the existing
internecine strife In Cuba Bnouldbe ter­
minated by our intervention, even at the
cost of a war between the United States
and Spain—a war which its advocates con­
fidently prophesy could be neither large
in Its proportions nor doubtful in Its Issue.
Right, Mot Might, Mast Rule.
The correctness of tills forecast need be
neither affirmed nor denied. The United
States has nevertheless a character to
maintain as a nation, which plainly dic­
tates that right and not might should be
the rule of Rs conduct. Further, though
the United States is not a nation to which
peace Is a necessity. It is in truth the most
pacific of powers, and desires nothing so
much as to live in amity with all the world.
Its own ample and diversified domains sat­
isfy all possible longings for territory, pre­
clude all dreams of conquest, and prevent
any casting of covetous eyes upon neigh­
boring regions, however attractive.
Spain Should Grant Autonomy.
It Is in the assumed temper and dispo­
sition of the Spanish government to rem­
edy these grievances, fortified bfr Indica­
tions of Influential public opinion in Spain,
that this government has hoped to discover
the most promising and effective means of
composing the present strife, with honor
and advantage to Spain and with tho
achievement of all the reasonable objects
of the insurrection. It would seem that
if Spain should offer to Cuba genuine
autonomy—a measure of home rule which,
while preserving the sovereignty of Spain,
would satisfy all rational requirements of
her Spanish subjects—there should be no
just reason why the pacification of the
Island might not be effected on that basis.
Objections Answered.
It has been objected on the one side that
Spain should not promise autonomy untl!
her insurgent subjects lay down their
arms on the other side, that promised au­
tonomy, however liberal, is insufficient, be­
cause without assurance of the promise be­
ing fulfilled, but the reasonableness of a re­
quirement by Spain, of unconditional sur­
render on the part of the Insurgent Cubans
before their autonomy Is conceeded, Is not
altogether apparent. It Ignores important
features of the situation—the stability *of
two years' duration has given to the in­
surrection the feasibility of its indefinite
prolongation In the nature of things,
and as shown by past experience, the
utter and imminent ruin of the island, un­
less the present strife Is speedily composed
above all, the rank abuses which all par­
ties in Spain, all branches of her govern­
ment and all her leading public men con­
cede to exist and profess a desire to re­
move. Facing such circumstances to with­
hold the proffer of needed reforms until
the parties demanding them put them­
selves at mercy by throwing down thefr
arms has the appearance of neglecting the
gravest of perils and inviting suspicion as
to the sincerity of any professed willingness
to grant reforms.
The objection on behalf of the insurgents
—that proposed reforms cannot be relied
upon—must of course be considered, though
we have no right to assume and no reason
for assuming that anything Spain under­
takes to do for the relief of Cuba will not
be done according to both the spirit and
the letter of the undertaking.
Offered Our Services.
Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions
and precautions on the part of the weak­
er ot two combatants are always natural
and not always unjustifiable—being sin­
cerely desirous in the interest of both, as
well as on its own account that the Cuban
problem should be solved with the least
possible delay, it was intimated by this
government to the government of Spain
some months ago that. If a satisfactory
measure of home rule were tendered the
Cuban insurgents, and would be accepted
by them upon a guaranty of its execution,
tho United States would endeavor to tina
a way not objectionable to Spain of fur­
nishing such guaranty. While no definite
response to this intimation has yet been
received from the Spanish government,
is believed to be not altogether unwelcome.
A Limit so Oar Patience.
Whatever circumstances may ari&e, our
policy and our interests would constrain us
to object to the acquisition of the island or
an interference with Its control by any
other power. It should be added that it
cannot be reasonably assumed that the
hitherto expectant attitude of the United
States will be indefinitely maintained.
While we are anxious to accord all due re­
spect to the so*, ereignty of Spain, we can­
not view the pending conflict In all Its
features and properly apprehend our In­
evitably close relations to it and Its pos­
sible results without considering that by
the course of events we may be drawn into
such an unusual and unprecedented con­
dition as will fix a limit to our patient
waiting for Spain to end the contest, either
alone and in her own way, or with our
friendly cooperation.
Deferring the choice of ways and meth­
ods until the time for action arrives, we
should make them depend upon the pre­
cise conditions then existing and they
should not be determined upon without
giving careful heed to every consideration
involving our honor and interest, or the
international duty we owe to Spain. Until
we "face the contingencies suggested, or
tho situation Is by other incidents impera­
tively changed, we should continue in the
line of conduct heretofore pursued, thus
in all circumstances exhibiting ojur obedi­
ence to the requirements of public law and
our regard for the duty enjoined upon us
by the position we occupy in the family of
nations.
Venezuelan Question.
The Venezuelan boundary question hfw
ceased to be a matter of difference between
Great Britain and the United States, their
respective governments having agreed
upon the substantial provisions of a treaty,
between Great Britain and Venezuela, sub­
mitting the whole controversy to arbitra­
tion. The provisions of the treaty are so
eminently just and fair, that the asspnt of
Venezuela thereto may confidently be an­
ticipated.
General Arbitration with Great Britain.
Negotiations for a treaty of general ar­
bitration for all differences between Great
Britain and the United States are far ad­
vanced, and promise to reach a successful
consummation at an early date.
Oar Finances.
The secretary of the treasury reports
that during the fiscal year ended June 30,
1896, the receipts of the government from
all sources amounted to $409,475,408.78. Dur­
ing the same period its expenditures were
$434,078,654.48, the excess of expenditures
over receipts amounting to $25,203,245.70.
The ordinary expenditures during the year
were $4,015,852.21 less than during the pre­
ceding fiscal year: Of the receipts men­
tioned, there were derived from customs
the sum of $lSQ,021,7.rl.G7 and from internal
revenue $146,8'I0,O15.Gti. The receipts from
customs show an increase of $7,863,134.22
over those from the same source for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1895, and the re­
ceipts from internal revenue an increase of
$3,584,537.91.
Imports and Exports.
The'value of our imported dutiable mer­
chandise during the last fiscal year wad
$369,757,170, and the value of free goods im­
ported $409^967,470, being an Increase of $t,
U23.675 in the value of dutiable goods and
$41,231,034 in the value of free goods over
the preceding year. Our exports of mer­
chandise, foreign and domestic, "amounted
in value to $832,606,938, being an Increase
over the preceding year of $75,068,773. The
average.ad valorem duty paid on dutiable
goods Imported during the year was 39.94
per cent, and on free and dutiable goods
taken together 20.55 per cent.
Movement of Metallic Money.
The total amount of goid exported during
the last fiscal year was $112,409,947 and of
silver $60,541,670, being an increase of $45,
941,466 of gold, and $13,246,384 of silver over
the exportations of the preceding fiscal
year. The Imports of gold were $33,520,065,
and of silver $28,777,186, being $2,859,695 less
of gold, and $8,566,007 more of silver than
during the preceding year. The total stock
of metallic money in the United States at
the close of the last fiscal year ended on
the 30th day of June, 1896, was $1,228,326,
035, of which $595*,597,964 was in gold, and
$628,728,071 in silver.
Per Capita Circulation of 823.03.
On the first day of November, 1896, the
total stock of money of all kinds in the
country wao $2,285,410,590, and the amount
in circulation, not Including that In the
treasury holdings, was $1,627,055,641, being
$22.63 per capita, upon an estimated popula­
tion of 71,901000.
national Banks.
The number of national banks organized
from the time the law uuthorlilncthetr
creation was passed, up to October 81, 1896,
was (,051, and of this number 3,379 were at
the date last mentioned in active Opera­
tion, having authorised capital stock of
$650,014,895, held by 288,902 shareholders, and
circulating notes amounting to $211,412,620.
The total outstanding circulating notes of
all national banks on the 31st day of Oc­
tober, 1896, amounted to $234,553,807 Includ­
ing unredeemed, but fully secured notes
of banks Insolvent and In process of liqui­
dation. The increase in national banlt cir
year ending on that
»n October 6,1896kwhen
culatlon during the
day was $21,099,429. On
the condition of national banks was last
reported, the total resources of the 3,679
active Institutions was $3,263,685,813.83.
which Included
$1,893,268,839.03
in loans and
discounts and $362,165,733.85 in money of all
kinds on hand. Of their liabilities $1,597,
£91,058.03 was due to individual depositors
and $209,944,019 consisted of outstanding cir­
culating notes. There were organized dur­
ing the year preceding the date last men­
tioned 28 national banks, located In 15
states, of which 12 were organized In the
eastern states with a capital of $1,180,000,
six In the western states with a capital of
$875,000, and ten in the southern states with
a capital of $1,190,000. During the year,
however, 37 banks voluntarily abandoned
their franchises under the national law,
and In the case of 27 others it was found
necessary to appoint receivers. Therefore,
as compared with the year preceding, there
was a decrease of 36 in the number of
active banks. The number of existing
banks organized under Btate laws Is
5,708.
Immigration.
The number of Immigrants arriving in
le United States during the fl
343,267, of whom 340,468 were
the United States during the fiscal year was
were permitted to
land,1 'and 2,799 were debarred on various
grounds prescribed by law, and returned
to the countries whence they came, at the
expense of the steamship company by
which they were brought In. The Increase
in immigration over the preceding- year
amounted to 84,131. It is reported that with
some exceptions the immigrants of the past
year were of a hardy laboring class, accus­
tomed and able to earn a support for them­
selves, and it is estimated that the money
brought with them amounted to at least
$5,000,000. Though it was probably much in
excess of that sum, since only those having
less than $30 are required to disclose the
exact amount, and It is known that many
brought considerable sunta of money to
buy land and build homes. Including all
the immigrants arriving who were over
14 years of age, 28.63 per cent, were illit­
erate as against 20.37 per cent, of those of
that age arriving during the preceding fis­
cal year.
Work of the Life Savers.
From the life-saving service it Is Re­
ported that the number of disasters to
documented vessels within the limits of its
operations during the year was 437. These
vessels had on beard 4,608 persons, of
whom 4,695 were saved and 13 lost. The
value of such vessels is estimated at $8,SW,
140, and of their cargoes, 33,846,380, making
the total value of property Imperiled
Si:-
726,520. Of this amount $11,292,707 was
saved and $1,432,750 was lost.
The Army.
The report of the secretary of war ex­
hibits satisfactory conditions in the sev­
eral branches of the public service in­
trusted to his charge. The limit of our mil­
itary force, as fixed by law, Is constantly
and readily maintained. The present dis­
cipline and morale of our army are excel­
lent, and marked progress and efficiency
are apparent throughout its entire organi­
zation.
With the exception of delicate duties in
the suppression of slight Indian dis­
turbances along our southwestern boun­
dary, in which the Mexican troops cooper­
ated, and the compulsory but peaceful re­
turn, with the consent of Great Britain, of
a band of Cree Indians from Montana to
the British possessions, no active opera­
tions have been required of the army dur­
ing the year past.
Changes in methods of administration,
the abandonment of unnecessary posts and
consequent concentration of troops and
the exercise of care and vigilance by the
various officers charged with the responsi­
bility in the expenditure of appropriations
have resulted in reducing to a minimum
the cost of maintenance of our military es­
tablishment. During the past year the
work of constructing permanent infantry
and cavalry posts has been continued at
the places heretofore designated. The sec­
retary of war repeats his recommendation
that appropriations for barracks and quar­
ters should more strictly conform to the
needs of the service, as judged by the de­
partment. rather than respond to the
wishes and importunities of localities. It
is Imperative that much of the money pro­
vided for such construction should now be
allotted to the erection of necessary quar­
ters for the garrisons assigned to the coast
defenses, where many men will be needed
to properly care for and operate modern
guns. It Is essential, too, that early pro­
vision be made to supply the necessary
force of artillery to meet the demands of
this service.
The Militia.
The organized militia numbers 112,879 men.
The appropriations for Its support by the
gOV
these troops to be usually drilled and in­
spired with much military interest, but in
many Instances they are so deficient in
proper arms and equipment that a sudden
call to active duty would find them in­
adequately prepared for field service. 1
therefore recommend that prompt meas­
ures be taken to remedy this condition ani
that every encouragement be given to
this deserving body of unpaid and volun­
tary citizen soldiers, upon whose assist­
ance we must largely rely in time of
trouble.
Sea Coast Defenses.
During the past year rapid progress has
been made toward the completion of tho
scheme adopted for the erection and arma­
ment of fortifications along our seacoast,
while equal progress has been made in pro­
viding the material for submarine defense
In connection with these works. It is pecul­
iarly gratifying at this time to note tne
great advance that has been made in this
l'mportant undertaking since the date of
my annual message to the Fifty-third con­
gress at the opening of its second ses­
sion, In December, 1S93. At that time I in­
formed the congress of the ap
completion of 9 12-inch-, 20 10-inch and
8-incn high power steel guns and 7512-inch
rifled mortars.
This total then seemed Insignificant when
compared with the great work remaining
to be done. Yet It was none the less a
source of satisfaction to every citizen
when he reflected that it represented, the
first Installment of the new ordnance of
American design and American manufac­
ture, and demonstrated our ability to sup­
ply from our own resources guns of unex­
celled power and accuracy. At that date,
however, there were practically no car­
riages upon which to mount those guns,
and only 31 emplacements for guns and 64
for mortars. Nor were all these emplace­
ments in condition to receive their arma­
ment. Qnly one high-power gun was at
that time in position for the defense of the
entire coast. Sinoe that time the number
of guns actually completed has been isi
creased to 21 12-inch 56 ten-inch 61 eight
inch high-power breech-loading steel ten
rapid-fire guns and 80 12-ipch ritled mor­
tars. In addition there are in process of
construction of one 16-inch type gun, W 12
inch, 56 ten-inch, 27 eight-inch high-power
guns and 66 12-inch rifled mortars in all
428 guns and mortars.
The Postal Service.
The post office department is in good
condition, and the exhibit made of its op­
erations during the fiscal year ended Ju.io
SO, 18)6, If allowance is made for imper­
fections in the laws applicable to it. is very
satisfactory. The total receipts during tne
year were $S2,499,208.40. The total ex­
penditures were $90,626,296.ii4, exclusive of
si,559,898.27, which was earned by the Pa­
cific railroad for transportation and creo
ited on their debt to the government. There
was an increase of receipts over the pre­
vious year of $5,516,080.21, or 7.1 per cent.,
and an increase of expenditures of $3,836.
124.02, or 4.42 per cent. The deljclt was
$1,679,956.19, less than that of the preceding
year.
Abase of Second-Class Bates.
-The deficit for the last year, although
much less than that of the last and pre­
ceding years, emphasizes the necessity for
legislation to correct the growing abuse
of
second-class
rates, to which the de­
ficiency is mainly attributable. The trans­
mission at the rate of one cent a pound
of serial libraries, advertising sheets,
"house organs" (periodicals advertising
some particular "house" or Institution),
sample copies and the like ought certainly
to be discontinued.
Kxpendl tares.
The remainder of our postal revenue,
amounting to something more than $5,000,
000, was derived from'box rents, registry
fees, money-order business and other simi­
lar items. The entire expenditures of the
department, including pay for transporta­
tion credited to the Pacific railroads, was
$92,186,195.11, which may be considered as
the cost of receiving, carrying and deliv­
ering the above mall matter. It thus ap-
?er
ears'that though tl»e second-class mat­
constituted more than two-thirds of
the total that was carried, the revenue
derived from It was less than one-thirtieth
of the total expense. The average revenue
from each pound of first-class matter was
98 cents. From each pound of second
class, SVfc mills. (Of the second class 52,348,
297 was c'ounty-free matter). From each
pound of third class. 13.1 cents. From each
pound of fourth class, 15.6 cents. The
growth ot weight of aecond-class matter
has been from 299,000,000 pounds in 1894 to
312,000,000 pounds In 1895, and to almost
349,000,000 in 1896, and It is quite evident this
Increasing drawback Is far outstripping any
possible growth of postal revenues.
Abuses Must lis Corrected.
Our mall service should of course be
such as to meet the wants and even the
conveniences of our people, at a direct
charge upon them so light as perhaps to
exclude the Idea of our post office depart­
ment being a money-making concern but
in the face of a constantly recurring de­
ficiency In Its revenues, and In view of the
fact that we supply the best mail service
In the world, it seems to me It Is quite time
to correct the abuses that swell enor­
mously our annual deficit. If we concede
the public policy of carrying weekly news­
papers free in the county of publication,
and even the policy of carrying at less
than one-tenth of their cost other bona
fide newspapers and periodicals, there can
be no excuse for subjecting the service to
the further Immense and increasing loss
involved In carrying at the nominal rate,
of one cent a pound the serial libraries,
sometimes including trashy and even
harmful literature, and other matter
profitable returns derived from first-class
matter, which pays three or four times
more than Its cost, and producing a large
annual loss to be paid by general taxation.
If such second-class matter paid merely
tho cost of Its handling our deficit would
disappear and a surplus result which
might be used to give the people still better
mail facilities or cheaper rates of letter
postage. I recommend that legislation be
at Once enacted to correct these abuses and
introduce better business Ideas In the reg­
ulation of our postal rates.
The Navy.
The work of the navy department and its
present condition are fully exhibited in the
report of the secretary. The construction
of vessels for our new navy has been ener­
getically prosecuted by the present admin
necessity
ods, under which the wor.li was found to be
progressing in a manner highly satisfac­
tory. It has been decided, however, to pro­
vide in every shipbuilding contract that cue
builder should pay all trial expenses, and
it has also been determined to pay no speed
premiums in future contracts. The pre­
miums recently earned and some yet to be
decided are features of the contracts made
before this conclusion was reached.
On March 4, 1893, there were in commis­
sion but two armored vessels, the double
tvrreted monitors Miantjpnomah and Mon­
terey. Since that date, of vessels thereto­
fore authorized, there have been placed in
their first commission three first-class and
two second-class battle ships, two armored
cruisers, one harbor defense ram and five
double-turreted monitors, including the
Maine and the Puritan, Just completed.
Eight new armored cruisers and two new
gunboats have also been commissioned.
The Iowa, another battle ship, will be com­
pleted about March 1, and at least four
more gunboats will be ready for sea in the
early spring.
There have been authorized by congress
since March, 1593, five battle ships, six
light-draft gunboats, 16 torpedo boats and
one submarine torpedo boat. Contracts
for the building of all of them have been
lot. The secretary expresses the opinion
that we have for the present a sufficient
supply of cruisers and gunboats, and that
hereafter the construction of battle ships
and torpedo boats will supply our needs.
Department of tho Interior.
The report of the secretary of the interior
presents a comprehensive and interesting
exhibit of the numerous and important af­
fairs committed to hl3 supervision. It is
Impossible in this communication to do
more than briefly refer to a few of the sub­
jects concerning which the secretary gives
full and Instructive Information.
The money appropriated on account
OL
this department anu for its disbursement
for the flscal year ended June 30, 1S9S,
amounted to more than $157,000,000, or a
greater sum than was appropriated for the
entire maintenance of the government for
the two fiscal years ended June 30, 1861.
The Public Domain.
Our public lands, originally amounting
to 1,840,1*10,000 acres, have been so reduceu
that only about 000,000,000
acres
still remain
in government control, excluding Alaska.
The balance, being by far the most valuable
portion, has been given away to settlers,
to new states, and to railroads, or sold at
a comparatively nominal sum. 1
he patent­
ing of lands in execution of railroad grants
lias progressed
rapidly
during the year,
and since the 4th day of March, 1894, about
L'5,c00,uu0 acres have thus been conveyed to
these corporations.
1 agree with the secretary that the re­
mainder of our public lands should be
more carefully dealt with and their aliena­
tion guarded by better economy and greater
prudence.
The Indians.
The total Indian population of the United
States is 177,235, according to a census
mo.de in exclusive of ttiose within tne
state of New York and those comprising
the five civilized tribes.
thl.3
numfc)er
mere are approximately 38,000 children of
school age. During the year 23,39a of these
were enrolled in schools. Tne progress
which has attended recent efforts to ex­
tend Indian school facilities and the an­
ticipation of continued liberal appropria­
tions to that end, cannot fall to atxoni the
utmost satisfaction to those who believe
that the education of Indian children is a
prime factor in the accomplishment ot
Indian civilization.
Conditions Improved.
It may be said in general terms, that in
every particular the improvement of the
Indians under government has been
most marked and encouraging. 1
he sec­
retary, the commissioner of Indian affairs
and the agents haying charge of In­
dians to whom allotments have been made
strongly urge tho passage of a law pro­
hibiting the sale of liquor to allottees who
have taken their lands in severalty. I
earnestly Join in this recommendation.
Allotment of JLands.
A commission organized and empowered
under several recent laws is now negotiat­
ing with these Indians for the relinquish­
ment of their courts and the division of
their common lands in severalty and are
aiding lti the settlement of the trouble­
some question of tribal membership. Ihe
reception of their first proffers of nt%rotia
tion were not encouraging, but through pa­
tience and such conduct on their part as
demonstrated that their Intentions were
friendly and in the interest of the tribes
the prospect of success has become more
promising. The effort should be to save
these Indians from the consequences of
their own mistakes and improvidence and
to secure to the real Indian his rights as
against intruders and professed lriends
who profit by his retrogression.
1 indorse the recommendation made by
the present secretary of the interior as
well as his predecessor that a permanent
commission consisting of three members,
one of whom shall be an army officer, be
created to perform the duties now devolv­
ing upon the commissioner and assistant
commissioner of Indian affairs. Tho man­
agement of the bureau involves such nu­
merous and diverse details and the ad­
vantages of an uninterrupted policy arc so
apparent that I hope the change suggested
will meet the approval of the congress.
Pensions.
The diminution of our enormous pen­
sion roil and the decrease of pension ex-
Sently
onditure which have been so often conti
foretold, still fall in material reali­
zation. The number of pensioners on the
rolls at the close of the flscal year ended
June 30, 1896, was 970,678. This is the largest
number ever reported. The amount paid
exclusively for the pensions during the
year was $138,214,761.94, a slight decrease
from that of the preceding year, while the
total expenditures on account of pensions,
including the cost of maintaining the de­
partment and expenses attending pension
distribution amounted to $142,206,5b0.59, or
within a very small fraction of one-third
of the entire expense of supporting the gov­
ernment during the same year. The num­
ber of new pension certificates Issued was
90,640. Of these, 40,374 represent original al­
lowances of claims and 15.87S increase of
existing pensions. The number of per­
sons receiving pensions from the United
States, but residing In foreign countries,
at the close of the last flscal year was 3,781,
and the amount paid to them during the
year was $582,735.38.
Abases Are Demoralizing.
in my opinion, based upon such state­
ments as these and much other Informa­
tion and observation, the abuses which
have been allowed to creep Into our pen­
sion system have done Incalculable harm
in demoralising our people and undermin­
ing good citizenship. I have endeavored
The Pucitto Railroads.
The secretary calls attention to the pub­
lic interests Involved In an adjustment of
the obligations of the Pacific railroads to
the government. I deem It to be an Impor­
tant duty to especially present this subject
to tho consideration or the congress. On
January 1, 1897, with
ppointea pursuant io an act oi con*
The considerations requiring an ad
ent of the government's,relations to
the companies have been clearly presented
and the conclusion reached with practical
uniformity, that if these relations are not
terminated they should be revised upon a
basis securing their safe continuance.
Mast Take Action.
In the case of the Union Pacific company,
however, the situation has become es­
pecially and immediately urgent. Proceed­
ings have been Instituted to foreclose a
first mortgage upon those aided parts of
the main lines upon which the govern­
ment holds a second and subordinate mort­
gage lien. In consequence of those pro­
ceedings and Increasing complications,
added to the default occurring on the 1st
day of January, 1897, a condition will be
presented at that date, so far as this com­
pany Is concerned, that must emphasize
the mandate of the act of 1887 and give to
executive duty under its provisions a more
Imperative aspect. Therefore, unless con^
gress shall otherwise direct or shall have
futlonto
ireviously determined upon a different uo
of the problem, there will hardly ap­
pear exist any reason for delaying be­
yond the date of the default above men­
tioned such executive action as will prom­
ise to subserve the public Interests and
save the government from the loss threat­
ened by further Inacticn.
Department of Agriculture.
The department of agriculture is so In­
timately related to the welfare of our peo­
ple and tho prosperity of our nation that
ft should constantly receive the care_and
encouragement of the government. From
small beginnings it has grown to be the
center of agricultural Intelligence and the
source of aid and encouragement to agri­
cultural efforts. Large sums of money are
annually appropriated for the maintenance
of this department, and It must be con­
fessed that the legislation relating to it
has not always been directly in the inter­
est of practical farming or properly
guarded against waste and extravagance.
So far, however, the public money has been
appropriated fairly and sensibly to help
those who actually till the soil, no ex­
penditure has been more profitably made
or more generally approved by the peo­
ple.
Shows a Great Saving.
From the report of the secretary it ap­
pears that through careful and prudent
financial management he has annually
saved a large sum from his appropriations,
aggregating during his Incumbency and up
to the close of the present flscal year near­
ly one-fifth of the entire amount appro­
priated.
Value of Farm Products.
The secretary reports that the value of
our exports of farm products during the
last fiscal year amounted to $570,000,000,
an Increase of $17,000,000 over those of the
year Immediately preceding. This state­
ment Is not the less welcome because of
the fact that, notwithstanding such In
creas'e, the proportion of exported agricul­
tural products to our total exports of all
descriptions fell off during the year. The
benefits of an increase In agricultural ex­
ports being assured, the decrease in its
proportion to our total exports is tne more
gratifying when we consider that it is ow­
ing to the fact that such total exportsfor
the year Increased more than $7o,000,000.
Opposed to Free Seeds.
In my opinion the gratuitous distribu­
tion of seeds by the department as at pres­
ent conducted ought to be discontinued.
No one can read tne statement of the sec­
retary on this subject and doubt the ex­
travagance and questionable results of
this practice.
The Civil Service.
The progress made in civil service re­
form furnishes a cause for the utmost con­
gratulations. It has survived the doiibts
of Its friends as well as the rancor of its
enemies, and has gained a permanent
Dlace among the agencies destined to
cleanse our politics and to improve, econ­
omize and elevate the public service. "1 here
are now in the competitive classified serv­
ice upward of 84,000 places. More than half
of those have been included from time to
time since March 4, 1893. A most radical
and sweeping extension was made by ex­
ecutive order dated the 6th day of May,
1896. And if fourth-class postmasterships
are not included in the statement, it may
be said that practically all positions con­
templated by the civil-service law are not
classified. Abundant reasons exist for
including these postmasterships, based up­
on economy, improved service and the
peace and quiet of neighborhoods. If,
however, obstacles prevent such action at
present, I earnestly hope that congress
will, without increasing post office appro­
priations, so adjust them as to permit in
nroDer cases a consolidation of tnese post
offices, to the end that through this proc­
ess the result desired may to a limited ex­
tent l)« accomplished.
Mast Sot Be Offensive Partisans.
The civil service rules, as amended ouring
the last year, provide for a sensible and
uniform method of promotion, basing eli­
gibility to better positions upon demon­
strated efficiency and faithfulness. The
absence of fixed rules on tnis subject has
been an Infirmity in the system more and
more' apparent as its other benefits have
been better appreciated. The advantages
of civil service methods in their business
aspects are too well understood to require
argument. Their application lias become
a necessity to the executive work of tne
government. But those wno gain positions
through the operation of these methods
should be made to understand that tne non­
partisan scheme through whicn they tl
ceive their appointments demands rrom
them, by way of reciprocity, nonpartisan
and faithful performance of outy unaer
every administration and cheerful fidelity
to every chief. While they snouid be en­
couraged to decently exercise their rignts
of citizenship and to support through uieir
suffrages the political beliefs they honest­
ly protess, the noisy, pestuent anu partisan
employe who loves political turmoil and
contention, or who renders lax and grudg­
ing service to the administration not rep­
resenting his political views, should be
promptly and fearlessly dealt with in such
a way as to furnish a warning to others
who may be likewise disposed.
Interstate Commerce.
The interstate commerce commission has
during the last year supplied abundant evi­
dence of Its usefulness and the importance
of the work committed to its charge. Pub­
lic transportation is a universal necessity,
and the question of just and reasonable
charges tnerefor has become of vital im­
portance, not only to shippers and carriers,
but also to the vast multitude
.of producers
and consumers. The Justice and equity of
the principles embodied in the existing law
passed for the purpose of regulating these
charges are everywhere conceded, and there
appears to be no question that the policy
thus entered upon has a permanent place
in our legislation.
Operations of the Tariff Law.
1 desire to recur to the statements else­
where made concerning the government's
receipts and expenditures for the purpose
of venturing upon some suggestions touch­
ing our present tariff law and its opera­
tion. This statute took effect on the 28th
day of August, 1894. Whatever may be its
shortcomings as a complete measure of
tariff reform, it must be conceded that it
has opened the way to a freer and greater
exchange of commodities between us and
other countries and thus furnished a
wider market for our products and manu
facturirig.
The only entire flscal year during which
this law has been In force ended on the 30th
day of June, 1896. In that year our Imports

amount already
matured, more than $13,000,000 of the prin­
cipal of the subsidy bonds Issued by the
United States In aid of the construction of
the Union Pacific
railway,
Including Us
Kansas line, and more than $&000,000of like
bonds issued In aid of the Central Pacifio
railroad, including those issued to the
Western Pacific Railroad company, will
have fallen due and been paid or must on
that day be paid by the government. With­
out any reference to the application of the
sinking fund now in the treasury, this will
create such a default op the part of these
conApanieB to the government as will give
it the right to at once Institute proceed­
ings to foreclose its mortgage lien.
in addition to this Indebtedness, which
will be due January 1, 1897, there will ma­
ture between that date and January 1,1899,
the remaining principal of such subsidy
bonds, which must also be met by the gov­
ernment. These amount to more than $20,
000.000 on account of the Union Pacific
lines, and exceed $21,000,000 on account of
the Central Pacific lines. The situation of
these roads and the condition of their in­
debtedness to the government have been
fully set forth In the reports of various
committees to the present and prior con­
gresses and as early as 1887 they were
thoroughly examined by a special commis­
sion appointed pursuant to an actofcon
gress. TI

Cannot Justly Be Condemned.
Those who insist that the cost to our
people of articles coming to them from
abroad for their needful use sho'uld only
be Increased through tariff charges to an
extent necessary to meet the expanses of
the government, as well as those who
claim that tariff charges may be laid upon
•uch articles beyond the necessities of gov­
ernment revenue, and with the additional
purpose of so Increasing their price |n our
markets as to give American manufactw
era and producers bettor ana more profit
able opportunities, must agree that our
tariff laws are only primarily Justified as
sources of revenue to enable tne govern­
ment to meet the necessary expenses of Its
maintenance. Considered as to its suffi­
ciency In this aspect, the present law can
.. 'ust condemnation.
of
000
from
tariff duties In the preceding year. There
was, nevertheless, a deficit between our
receipts and expenditures of a little more
than 125.000,000. This, however, was not
unexpected.
Depression Not Due to the Law.
The situation was sseh ia December,
seven months before the close of the flscal
year, that the secretary of the treasury
foretold a deflciAicy of $17,000,000. The great
and Increasing apprehension and timidity
in business circles, and the depression in
all activities Intervening since that time,
resulting from causes perfectly well under­
stood and entirely disconnected with our
tariff law or its operation, seriously
chraked the Imports we would have other­
wise received and readily account' for the
difference between this estimate of the
secretary and the actual deficlenpy, as
welt as for a continued deficiency. Indeed,
It must be confessed that we could hardly
have had a more unfavorable period than
the last two years for the collection of
tariff revenue.
Believes It Will Prove a Success.
We cannot reasonably hope that our re­
cuperation from this business depression
will be sudden, but It has already set In
with a promise of acceleration and continu­
ance. I believe our present tariff law, If
allowed a fair opportunity, will Jn the near
future yield a revenue Which, with reasona-
or disturb us.
Use of the Reserve lawful.
To meet any such deficit we have In tlie
treasury. In addition to a gold teserve of
$100,000,000, a surplus of more than *1J8,000,
000 applicable to the payment of the ex­
penses of the government, aud which must,
unless expended for that purpose, remain
a useless hoard, or. If not extravagantly
wasted, must ih any event be perverted
from tho purpose of Its exaction from our
people. Tne payment, therefore, of any de­
ficiency In the revenue from this fund is
nothing more than its proper and legiti­
mate use.
Vices of Oar Financial System.
The reference to the condition an'u pros­
pects of our revenues naturally suggests
an allusion to the weakness and vices of
our financial methods. They have been fre­
quently pressed upon the attention of con­
gress In previous executive communica
tlonss and the inevitable danger of their
continued toleration pointed out. ithout
now repeating any of these details, 1 can­
not refrain from again earnestly presenting
the necessity of the prompt reform of a
system opposed to every rule of sound
finance atad shown by experience to be
fraught with the gravest peril and per­
plexity.
The Greenback Should Go.
I am more convinced than ever that we
can have no assured financial peace and
safety until the government currency ob­
ligations upon which gold may be de­
manded from the treasury are withdrawn
from circulation and canceled. This mi^nt
be done, as has been hertofore recom­
mended, by their exchange for long-term
bonds bearing a low rate of interest or by
their redemption with the proceeds of such
bonds.
Even if only United States notes known
as greenbacks were thus retired, it is
probable that the treasury notes Issued in
payment of silver purchases under the act
of July. 14, 1890, now paid in gold when de­
manded, would not create much dis­
turbance, as they might from time to time
when received In the treasury by redemp­
tion In gold or otherwise be gradually
and prudently replaced by silver coin.
Most Effective Path to Keform.
The plan of issuing bonds for the purpose
of redemption certainly appears to bathe
most effective and direct path to the
re or
In default of this, however, It would be
a step In the right direction if currency
obligations redeemable in gold, whenever
so redeemed, should be canceled instead
of being reissued. This operation would
be a slow remedy, but It would improve
present conditions.
National banks should redeem their own
notes.' They should be allowed to Issue
circulation to the par value of bonds de­
posited as securfty for Its redemption, ana
the tax on their circulation should be re­
duced to one-fourth of one per cent.
Real Source of Danger.
In considering projects for tne retirement
ot United States notes and treasury notes
issued under the law of 1890, 1 am of the
opinion that we have placed too much
stress upon the danger of contracting the
currency and have calculated too little
upon the gold that would be added to ou
circulation if invited to us by -better and
safer financial methods
MuHt Abandon Banking Business.
The entire case may be presented by the
statement that the day of sensible and
sound financial method will not dawn upon
us until our government abandons the
banking business and the accumulation of
funds and confines its monetary operations
to the receipt of the money contributed by
the people for its support and to the ex­
penditure of such money for the people a
benefit.
Bot Shot for Trusts.
Another topic in which our people right­
fully take a deep interest may be here
briefly considered. 1 refer to the existence
of trusts and other huge aggregations of
capital, the object of which is to secure the
monopoly of some particular branch of
trade, Industry or commerce, and so stifle
wholesome eompetltion. When these are
defended, it is usually on the ground that
though they Increase profits, they also re
duce
prices, and thusVnay benefit the public.
It must be remembered, however, that a
reduction of prices to the people Is not on«
of the real objects of these organizations.,
nor is their tendency necessarily in that
direction. If It occurs In a particular case,
it Is only because it accords with the pur­
pose or Interests of those managing the
scheme. Such occasional results fall far
short of compensating the palpable evils
charged to the account of trusts and mo­
nopolies.
Laws Inefficient for Their Control.
To the instinctive belief that such is the
Inevitable
trend of trusts and monopolies
Is due the widespread and deep-seated pop­
ular aversion in which they are held and
the not unreasonable insistence that,
whatever may be their incidental econ­
omic advantages, their general effect
uoon personal character, prospects and
usefulness cannot be otherwise than
injurious. Though congress has at­
tempted to deal with this matter by leg­
islation the laws passed for that purpose
thus far have proved ineffective, nOt be­
cause of any lack of disposition or attempt
to enforce them, but simply because the
laws themselves as interpreted by the
courts do not reach the difficulty. If tho
Insufficiencies ot existing laws can be
remedied by further legislation it should
be done.
States Should Take Effective Action.
It should be recognized, however, ttuit
all federal legislation on this subject may
tall short of Its purpose because of inherent
obstacles and also because of the complex
character of our governmental system,
which, while making the federal authori­
ty supreme within Its sphere, has carefulljr
limited that sphere by bounds which can­
not be transgressed. The decision of our
highest court on this precise question ren­
ders It quite doubtful whether the evils
of trusts and monopolies can be ade­
quately treated through federal action, un­
less they seek directly and purposely to
include in their objects transportation
or Intercourse between states or between
the United States and foreign countries.
It does not follow, however, that this is the
limit of the remedy that may be applied.
Even though It may be found that federal
authority Is not broad enouj
that
:h to fully
reach the case, there can be no doubt of the
power of the several states to act effec­
tively In the premises.
A Plea for Higld Economy.
In concluding this communication. Its
last words shall be an appeal to the con­
gress for the most rigid economy in the ex­
penditure of the money It holds In trust
for the people. Th« ay to perplexing ex­
travagance Is easy,
DUt
a return to fru­
gality Is difficult. When, however, it Is
considered that those -who bear the bur­
dens of taxation have no guarantee of
honest care save In the fidelity of their
public servants, the duty of all possible re­
trenchment Is plainly manifest.
