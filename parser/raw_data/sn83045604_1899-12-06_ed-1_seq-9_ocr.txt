UNUSUAL PBOSPEBITY.
Exports sad Imports larger Tkss
la Any Previous Year la the
Coaatry'e History.
The Fifty-sixth congress convenes In Its
first regular session with the country In a
condition of unusual prosperity, of uni
versal good will among the people at home
and relations of peace and friendship
with every government of the world. Our
foreign commerce has shown great in
crease in volume and value. The com
bined Imports and exports for the year
Are the largest ever shown by a single
year in all our history. Our exports for
ISD9 alone exceeded by more than a billion
dcllars our Imports and exports combined
In 1870. The Imports per capita are 3D per
cent, less than In 1870, while the exports
£er capita are 58 per cent, more than In
sio, showing the enlsrged capacity of the
United Statis to satisfy the wants of Its
own Iccrearing population, as well as to
contribute to those of the people of other
natiena.
Exports ct agricultural products were
j754.778.HJ. ot manufactured prtwlucts we
exported In valuo SX».SM.I«, being larger
thnn any previous ytat. It is a notewor
thy fact that the or.ly years in all our his
tory when the products of our manufac
tures soil abroad exceeded those bought
abroad were IMS and ISV9.
Receipts and Expenditures.
Government receipts from all sources for
the fiscal year ended June 80, 1899. Includ
ing 111,798.814.14, part payment of the Cen
tral Pacific Indebtedness, aggregated $610,-
982,004.35. Customs receipts were $206,128,-
481.75, snd those from internal revenue
9273,437,181.51.
„F' o r,.the fiscal year the expenditures were
*700,093,664.02, leaving a deficit of $89,111,-
559.67. The secretary of the treasury esti
mates that the receipts for the current fis
cal year will aggregate $640,958,112, and
upon the basis of present appropriations
the expenditures will aggregate $e00.#68,112,
leaving $40,000,000. For tile fiscal year end
ed June 30, 1899, the Internal revenue re
ceipts were increased about $100,900,000.
Itresgtk of the Treasury.
The present gratifying strength of the
treasury is shown by the fact that on De
cember 1, 1899, the available cash bal
ance was $275.004,837.72, of which $239,744,-
W.>.36 T.SS in gold coin and bullion. The
ond'tions ct confidence which prevail
tli'oughou*. the country have brought gold

receipts sre now almost entirely paid In
that coin.
Sarplna Faed to Reduce the Debt.
lhe strong condition of the treasury
with rtspect to cash on hand and the fa
vorable showing made by the revenues
have made It possllvle for the secretary of
the trtafury to take action under the pro
visions of section 3694, Revised Statutes,
relating to the sinking fund. Receipts ex
ceeded expenditures for the first five
months of the current fiscal year by $13.-
413,8*9.91, and, as -mentioned above, the
sot retar;- of the treasury estimates that
there will be a surplus of approximately
HO OWi.OOO at the end of the year. I'nder
such conditions It was deemed advisable
and proper to resume compliance with the
F revisions ol the sinking fund law, which
or eight years has not been done, because
ef deficiencies |n the revenues. The treas
ury depaitment therefore offered to pur
chase during November 825,000,000 of 5 per
cent, loan of 1904, or the 4 per cent, funded
'oan of iy>7, at the current market price.
The amount offered and purchased during
November was $18,408,600. The premium
paid by the government on mich purchases
was t-.763.521. and casing In net interest
was about 82,885,000. The success of this
operation was sufficient, to Induce the gov
ernment to continue the offer to purchase
bonds to and including the 23d day of De
cember, i nless the remainder of the 825,-
000,000 called for should be presented In the
meantime for redemption.
CHANGES NEEDED
IN BANKING LAWS
national Banks, Owing to Various
Reasons, Do Not Take Oat
Eaoagh Circulation.
Increased activity in Industry, with Its
welcome attendant—a larger employment
for labor at higher wages—gives to the
body of the people a larger power to ab
sorb the circulating medium. It Is further
true that year by year, with larger areas
of land under cultivation, the increasing
volume of agricultural products, cotton,
corn and wheat, calls for a larger volume
of money supply. This !s especially no
ticeable at the crop harvesting and crop
moving period.
In its earlier history the national hank
ing act seemed to prove a reasonable ave
nue through which needful additions to
the circulation could from time to time
be made. Changing conditions have ap
parently rendered it now imperative to
that end. The high margin In bond secur
ities required, resulting from the large
premiums which government bonds com
mand in the market, or the tax on note
issues, or both operating together, appear
to be the Influence which Impair its public
utility.
The attention of congress Is respectfully
Invited to this important matter, with the
view of ascertaining whether or not such
reasonable modifications can be made in
the national hanking act as will render its
service in the particulars here referred to
more responsive to the people's needs I
agftin urge that national banks he author
ized to organize with a capital of (25.0J0.
GOLD STANDARD
TO BE MAINTAINED.
Fall Power Slionld Be Given the
Secretary to Sell Bonds tor the
Purpose if Needed.
X urgently recommend that to support
the existing gold standard and to maintain
the parity in value of the coin of the two
metals (gold and silver) and the equal
power of every dollar at all times In tho
market and In tho payment of debts, the
secretary of the treasury l.c given addi
tional power and charged with the duty to
sell United States bonds and to employ
such other effective means as may bo
necessary to these ends. The authority
should Include the power to sell bonds on
lone and short time, s:s conditions may
require, and should provide for a rate of
Interest lower than thai fixed by the act
of January 14, 18io. While there Is now no
commercial fright which withdraws gold
from the government, but on the contrary,
such widespread confidence that gold seeks
the treasury, demanding paper money in
exchange, yet the very situation points
to the present as the most fitting time to
make adequate provision to insure the con
tinuance of the gold standard and of pub
lic confidence In the ability and purpose of
the government to meet all its obligations
In the money which the civilized world
rBE president'* menage is a document of t5,000 words. covering a targe number of topics, touching upon the
~ relations of the United States with all other countriei lightly and elaborating principally upon the Philip
pines. Cuba, Hawaii, trusts, the army and navy and Alaska.
Commencing Kith a brief reference to the unusual prosperity which the country is enjoying, the message
shows that government receipts are in excess of expenditure*, and that once again a surplus is being used to pay off
outstanding bonds.
Recommends change* <n the banking law* to permit of more circulation being taken out; a permanent retention
of the present gold standard, and the conferring of power on the secretary of the treasury to issue bonds to maintain
it in case of emergency.
Points out that the growth of merchant marine Aa* not kept pace with other development* in the country, and
recommends the following of the practice of other countries in extending encouragement for its upbuilding.
Recommends the extension of the present anti-trust law to more certainly control or check all combinationi in
restraint of trade, or tending to monopolixe production. '
Passing on to relations with foreign countries, the message goes over the various small matters of friction which
have occurred from time to time, and in connection with Nicaragua urges strongly the taking of prompt action looking
to the building of an oceanic canal.
The negotiation* with Canada through the foint commission and the modus vivendl in regard to the Alaska
boundary are gone over.
The partition of Samoa and the cause* which made it the only possible solution of the difficulties presented there
are treated fully.
In regard to Cuba, the message points out the responsibility which this country has incurred to the wortd in tee
ing that an orderly, settled government is established in the island, "a mission not to be accomplished by turning
adrift any loosely framed commonwealth to face the vicissitudes which too often attend weaker states whose natural
wealth and abundant resources are offset by the incongruities of their political organizations and the recurring occa
sions for internal rivalries to sap their strength and dissipate their energies."
The steps taken toward framing reciprocity treaties under the Dingley act are reverted to briefly.
The proceedings of the peace conference at The Hague, the part taken therein by the United States and the
convention finally adopted are recited and the convention itself submitted, with the hope that the senate will speedily
ratify it.
A warm tribute is paid to the volunteer* who remained in the Philippine* after their term of enlistment had ex
pired and until relieved by the new army, and a recommendation is made that a special medal of honor be presented
to each soldier and marine, regular and'volunteer, who so served. The detailed work of forming the new army to re
place the discharged volunteer force is also gone over. Chaplains for volunteer regiments are recommended.
The extraordinary growth of the domestic postal service it referred to, as well as the fact that receipt* are gain
ing in a fatter ratio than expenditures.
The navy is complimented highly for itt spirit and high efficiency. Recommendation is made generally for an
increase in the number of vessels, the message pointing out that we are behind all the great nations of the world,
save Italy, in tonnage under construction, being even exceeded by Japan. Congress is urged to make provision for
armor plate for new battleships, without imposing such limitations on the cost as to compel the use of inferior material
or leave the vessels incompleted.
As to pensions, it is recommended that a change be made, permitting soldiers' widowt with an income of not to
exceed t250 a year being pentioned.
The most important and lengthiett part of the mettage refers to the Philippines. Here the direct and positive
ground is taken that the islands belong to the United States by the highest class of title, and that this government
cannot, if if would, and will not, if it could, withdraw therefrom. The story of the Filipino outbreak, as told by the
commission, is gone over, and the military operations which have resulted in the dispersion of the insurgents touched
on. Considerable space is devoted to the experiment in government now in force in the island of Negros, working to
the satisfaction of the natives, and giving ample protection and security to life and property.
As to Hawaii, it is urged that a proper system of government be promptly provided, the incongruities and embar
rassments of the present situation there being pointed out.
Alaska also comes in for attention. The growth in population there and the necessity for an adequate form of
territorial government are strongly impressed upon congress.
The message thinks the time ripe also for the adoption of a temporary form of government for Porto Rico; and
if is particularly recommended that some modification be made in the tariff laws affecting products of the island,
so that they can find a market in the United Btatet.
Lynchings are referred to and condemned. In the earliett part of the message a recommendation based upon the
lynching of Italians in Louisiana is made that a special statute be passed giving jurisdiction to Federal courts in all
cases of invasion of treaty rights of foreigner* domiciled in the country.
The message closes with reference to some minor matters, such as the coming celebration of the ettablithment of
the teat of government at Wathington;
ence to the executive order taking mt
recognizes as the best. The financial
tranmctions cf the government are con
ducted upon a gold basis. We receive gold
where we sell United States bonds, and
use gold for their payment. We are main
taining the parity of all the money Issued
or coined by authority of the government.
We are doing these things with the means
at hand. Happ'lv at the present time we
are not compelled to resort to loans to sup
ply gold, ft has been done In the past,
however, and may have to be done In the
future.
It behooves us, therefore, to provide at
once the best means to meet the
emergency when It arises, and the best
means are those which are the most cer
tain and economical. Those now author
ised have the virtue neither of directness
nor economy. We have already eliminated
one of the causes of our financial plight
and embarrassment during the years 1893.
1894, 1895 and 1896. Our receipts now equal
our expenditures; deficient revenues no
longer create alarm. Let us remove the
only remaining cause, by conferring the
full and necessary power on the secretary
of the treasury and impose upon him the
duty to uphold the present gold standard
and preserve the coins of the two metals
on a parity with each other, which Is the
repeatedly declared policy of the United
States.
In this connection I repeat my former
recommendations that a portion of the gold
holdings shall be placed In a trust fund,
from which greenbacks shall me redeemed
upon presentation, but when once re
deemed shall not thereafter be paid out
except for gold.
SUBSIDIES TO AMERICAN
SHIPPING ARE NEEDED.
Smaller Share of American Prodneta
Carried In American Ships Dur
ing the I'aat Year.
The value of an American merchant ma
rine to the extension of our commercial
trade and the strengthening of our powor
upon the sea invites the immediate action
of congress. Our national development will
bo one-sided and unsatisfactory so long as
the remarkable growth of our Inland In
dustries remains unaccompanied by prog
ress on the sea. There is no lack of consti
tutional authority for leglsiation which
shall give to the country maritime strength
commensurate with Its Industrial achieve
ments and with Its rank among nations on
the earth.
The past year has recorded exceptional
activity in our shipyards, and the promises
of continued prosperity in shipbuilding are
abundant. Advanced legislation for tha
protection of our seamen has been enacted.
Our coast trade, under regulations wisely
framed, at the beginning of the govern
ment and since, shows result* for tho past
fiscal year unequaied in our records or
those of any ether power. We shall fail to
realize our opportunities, however, if we
complacently regard only matters at home
and blind ourselves to the necessity of se
curing our share in the valuable carrying
trade of the world.
iinuc v* «"•»«•
L/ast year American vessels transported
a smaller share of our exports and im
ports than during any former year in all
our history, and the measure of our de
pendence upon foreign shipping was pain
fully manifested to our people. Without any
choice of our own, but from necessity, the
departments of the government charged
with miiltury and naval operations in the
East and West Indies had to obtain from
foreign fines merchant vessels essential for
these operations.
The other great nations have not hesi
tated to adopt the required means to de
velop their shipping as a factor in national
defense, and as one of the surest and
speediest means of obtaining for the pro
ducers a share in foreign markets. I.ike
vigilance and effort on our part cannot fail
to Improve our situation, which is regard
ed with humiliation at. home and with sur
prise abroad. Even the seeming sacrifices
which at the beginning may be involved
will be offset later by more than equiva
lent gains.
The expense Is as nothing compared to
the advantage to be achieved. The rc-es
tablishment of our merchant marine In

iny placet from the protection of the civil service rules.
industrial progress and the extension of our
commercial triumphs. I am satisfied the
Judgment of the country favors the policy
of aid to our merchant marine, which will
broaden our commerce and markets and
upbuild our sea-carrying capacity for the
products of agriculture and manufacture,
and which, with the increase of our navy,
means more work and wages to our coun
trymen. as well as a safeguard to Ameri
can Interests In every part of the world.
COMBINATIONS IN
RESTRAINT OF TRADE.
Letlilaiire Attempts to Curb Trasts
Reviewed and Further Ac
tion Recommended.
Combinations of capital organized Into
trusts to control the condition of trade
among our cltliens, to stltle competition,
limit production and determine the prices of
products consumed by the people, are pro
voking public discussion and should early
claim the attention of congress.
The industrial commission, created by the
act of the oongress of June 18, 1898, has
been engaged in extended hearings upon
the disputed questions Involved in the sub
ject of combinations In restraint of trade
and competition. They have not yet com
pleted their Investigations of this subject,
and conclusions and recommendations at
which they may axrlve are undetermined.
The subject l» one giving rise to many
divergent views as to the nature and va
riety or cause and extent of the Injuries
to the public which may arise from
combinations, concentrating more or lops
numerous enterprises and establishments
which previous to the formation of the
combination were carried on separately.
It Is universally conceded that combina
tions which engross or control the market
of any particular kind of merchandise or
commodity necessary to the general com
munity, by suppressing natural and ordi
nary competition, whereby prices aie jn
duly enhanced to the general consumer,
are obnoxious, not only to the common
law, but also to the public welfare. There
must be a remedy for the evils involved in
such organizations. If the present law can
be extended more certainly to control or
check theae monopolies or trusts, it should
be done without delay. Whatever power the
congress possesses over this most import
ant subject should be promptly ascertained
and asserted.
President Harrison, In his annual mes
sage of December 3, 1889, says:
"Karnest attention should be given by
congress to a consideration of the question
how far the restraint of those combina
tions of caplta.l commonly called 'trusts'
is matter of Federal Jurisdiction. When
organized, as they often are, to crush out
all healthy competition and to monopolize
the production or sale of an article of com
merce and general necessity, they are dan
gerous conspiracies against the public
good, and should be made the subject of
prohibitory and even penal legislation.''
An act to protect trade and commerce
against unlawful restraint and monopolies
was passed J>y congress cn July 2, 1890.
The provisions of this statute are ccm
prehenive and stringent. It declares every
contract or combination In the form of a
trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in the
restraint of trade or commerce between
the several states or foreign nations to be
unlawful. It denominates as a criminal
every person who makes any such con
tract or engages In any such combination
or conspiracy, and provides a punishment
by fine or Imprisonment. It Invests the
several circuit courts of the United States
with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain
violations of the act, and makes It the
duty of the several United States district
attorneys, under the direction of the at
torney general, to Institute proceedings in
equity to prevent and restrain such vio
lations. It further confers upon any per
son or corporation, by reason of anything
forbidden or declared to be unlawful by
the act, the power to sue therefor in any
circuit court of the United States without
respect to the amount in conroversy, and
to recover threefold the damages by him
sustained and the costs of the suit, includ
ing reasonable attorney fees. It will be
perceived that the act Is aimed at every
kind of combination la the natur* at a
trust or monopoly in restraint of interstate
or International commerce.
The prosecution by the United States of
offenses under the act o£ 1890 has been fre
quently resorted to in the Federal courts,
and notable efforts In the restraint of Inter
state commerce, such as the "Transmls
sourl Freight Association' and the "Joint
Traffic Association," have been success
fully opposed and suppressed.
President Cleveland, In his annual mes
sage of December ?, 189«—more than six
years subsequent to the enactment of this
law—after stating the evils of these trust
combinations, says:
"Though congress has attempted to deal
with this matter by legislation, the laws
passed for that purpose thus far have
proved ineffective, not because of any lack
or disposition or attempt to enforce them,
but simply because the laws themselves
as Interpreted by the courts do hot reach
the difficulty. If the insufficiency of the
existing laws can be remedied by further
legislation It should be done. The fact
must be recognized, however, that all
Federal legislation on this subject may fall
short of its purpose, because of Inherent
obstacles and also bet-iure of the complex
character of our governmental system,
which, while making the Federal author
ity supreme within Its sphere, has care
fully limited that sphere by motes and
bounds which cannot be transgressed. The
decision of our highest court on this pre
cise question renders It quite doubtful
whether the evils of trusts and monopolies
can be adequately treated through Fed
eral action, unless they seek directly and
purposely to Include in their objects trans
portation or Intercourse between states or
between the United States and foreign
countries.
"It does not follow, however, that this Is
the limit of the remedy that may be ap
plied. Even though it may be found that
Federal authority Is not broad enough to
fully reach the case, there can be no doubt
of the power of the several states to act
effectively in the premises, and there
should bo no reason to doubt their w'lllng
ness to Judiciously exercise such power."
The state legislation to which President
Cleveland looked for relief from the evils
of trusts has failed to accomplish fully
that object. This Is probably due to a
great extent to the fact that different
states take different views as to the proper
way to discriminate between evil nnd In
jurious combinations, and those associa
tions which are beneficial and necessary to
the business prosperity of the country. The
great diversity of treatment In different
states arising from this cause, and the in
timate relations of all parts of the country
to each other without regarding state lines
In the conduct of business have made the
enforcement of state laws difficult.
It is apparent that uniformity of legs
latlon upon this subject in the several
states is much to t:c desired. It is to be
hoped, that such uniformity, founded in *
wise and Just discrimination between what
Is Injurious and what is useful and neces
sary in business operations, may be ob
tained and that means may be found for
the congress, within the limitations of Its
constitutional power, so to supplement an
effective code of state legislation as to
make a complete system of law through
out tho United States to compel a general
observance of the salutary rules to which
I have referred.
The whole question Is so Important and
far-reaching that I am sure no part of It
will be lightly considered, but every phase
of :t will have the studied deliberation of
the congress. resulting In wise and- Judi
cious action.

During the past summer two national
