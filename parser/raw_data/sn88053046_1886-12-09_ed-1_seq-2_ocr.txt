Civil perturbations in the Samoan Islands
have during the past few years been a
source of considerable embarrassment to
the three governments, Germany, Great
Britain, and the United States, whose rela
tions and extraterritorial rights in that Im
portant group «ire guaranteed by treaties.
Th«« weakness of the native administration
. „ Interests In
the Islands have led King Maliotoa to seek
alliant or protection In some one quarter,
regardless of the distinct engagements
whereby no one of the three treaty powers
may acquire any paramount or exclusive
Interest. In May last Malletou offered to

authority, assumed to grant it. The pro

Th« present system ot Indian agencies
has become Inadequate for the aceomplloh
ment of the object that has grown prossing
In Importance—tho more rapid transition
from tribal organizations to citizenship of
civilized
such Indians as are capable of
life. There is uow no such thin
Indian frontier. As a race the Indians
no longer hostile; few only are troublesome.
Except tho fragments of several bauds ull
gathered on reservations. It Is
longer possible for them to subsist by tho
chose and the spontaneous productions of
the earth. Thetr life of dependence on
government rations Is no longer defensible.
Yet. they are a portion of our people,
with a peculiar claim on the fosteriug
and protection of the nation. The
government cannot relieve Itself of this
snonslbillty until they are so far trained and
civilized as to be able wholly to manugo
for themselves. Agents have tluro
to look aftor the Improvement of but tow
Indians;the many are neglected and re
main Idle and dependent. Besides, the
compensation and conditions of the service
not calculated to secure for this work
who are fitted by ability and skill to
plan and direct tho methods adopte«! to
produce the most speedy results and perma
nent benefits. Hence the necessity fora
supplemental agency or system, directed to
the end of promoting the g«raerul and
raptd transition of the Indian from bar
barism to civilization.
The appointment of an auxiliary commis
sion for this purpose was recomnronded in
last y««ir'B message. It was designed that
this commission should be compostai of six
Intelligent and capable persons - three to be
detailed from the army—having practical
ideas upon the subj«rot of the treatment of
Indians, and interested in their welfare;
and that It should be charged, under tho
direction of the Secretary ot the Interior,
with tiro management of such matters ot
detail as cannot with the present
tlon be properly and sucoessfull
and which presont different p
Indians themselves differ, In their progress
needs, disposition, and capacity for im
provement or Immediate self-support.
The time is ripe for tbe work of such
agency. As the rising generation
taught the language of civilization and
tralnod in habits of industry, they should
assume the duties, privileges and responsi
bilities of citizen* hip.

The continued operation of the law relat

convincing proofs of its necessity and

of this reform. Its staunchest friends
found among those who understand it best

who insist that tho solectlon for such places
should rest upon a proper credential show

public officers, if not their lives, the only
opportunity afforded them to attend to

1 )ecember.
Holiday month. Christmas!
I he vision broadens until
the great day comes, then
narrows to the quiet New
Year-day, living at length in
the worry and work of the

cares. Parent, child, brother,
sister, friend, dependent are
cares, each and all, until the
Christmas tokens are pro
vided. T ake these cares easily.
