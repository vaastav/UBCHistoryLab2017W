Synopsis of Reports of the Heads of
Various Departments
To the Congress of the United State.
Aa you assemble for tbe discharge of
tbe duties you have assumed as tbe
representatives of a free and generous
people your meeting is marked by an
interesting and impressive incident.
With tbe expiration of tbe present ses
sion of Congress Vhe first century of our
constitutional existence as a nation
- v. ill be completed.
Our survival for one hundred years
is not " sufficient to assure us
tbat we no longer have dangers to fear
In the maintenance with all its prom
ised blessings of a government
founded upon the freedom of the peo
pie. Tbe time rather admonishes to
soberly inquire whether in the past we
have always closely kept in tbe course
of safety and whether we have before
us a way plain and clear, which lfads
to happiness and perpetuity.
The citizen-, of our republic, in its
early days, rigidly Insisted upon full
compliance with tbe letter of this bond
and saw stretching before him a clear
field for individual endeavor. Ilia
tribute to tbe support of bis govern
ment was measured by the cost of its
cbart,economically maintained, and he
was secure in ine enjoyment ol tbe re
maining recompense of bis steady con
tentment.
In those days the frugality of the
people was stamped upon their govern'
ment and was enforced by the free.
thoughtful and intelligent suffrage of
the citizen. Combination, monopolies
and azcrregations of capital were either
avoided or sternly regulated and re
strained. The pomp aud glitter of gov
ernments less free offered no tempta
tion and presented no delusion to the
plain people who, side by side, in
friendly competition wrought for the
enoblement and dignity of man, for the
solution of the problem of free govern
ment and for the achievement of the
grand destiny awaiting the land which
God had aiven tnem.
A century bas passed. Our cities
are the abiding places of wealth and
luxury; our manufactories yield for
tunes never dreamed of by the fathers
of tbe republic; our business men are
madly striving in the race for riches,
and immense aggregations of capital
outrun the imagination in the magni
tude of their undertakings. When the
experiment of our government was un
dertaken the chart adopted for our
guidance was the constitution. De
parture from the lines there laid down
is failure. It Is only by a strict ad
herence to the direction they indicate,
and by restraint within the limitations
they tlx. that we can furnish proof to
the world of the ability of the Ann M
can people for self-government. The
equal and exact justice of which we
boast as the underlying principle of
our institutions, should not be coniined
to the relations of our citizens with
each other. The government itself is
under bond to the American people
that in the exercise of its functions
and powers it will deal .with the body
of our citizens in a manner scrupulous
ly honest and fair, and absolutely just.
It bas agreed that American citizen
ship shall be the only credential neces
sary to justiry the claim of equality
before the law, and that no condition
- in life ttliall give rise to discrimination
in the treatment of the people by their
government,.
A DA UK riCTUltK.
V v it-w with pride and satisfaction
this bi iglit picture of our country's
growtli ami prosperity, while only a
closer scrutiny develops a somber
shading. Upon more careful inspec
tion we Uud the wealth and luxury of
our cities mingled with poverty aud
wretchedness. A crowded and con
stantly increasing population suggest
the impoverishment of rural sections
and discontent with agricultural pur
suits. The farmer's sun, not satisfied
with his father's simple and laborious
life, joins the eager chase for easily
acquired wealth, jie then denounces
the aggregation of money by trusts
and fears that the existence of the na
tion is threatened by corporations
which are calculated to bring commun
ism to the land. lie thinks the surplus
in tbe treasury a constant menace as
the people will rue to throw off the
yoke that places the unnecessary bur
den upon them. lie accuses the gov
ernment of entering into a partnership
with the rich by which all the poor are
made to succunio to the combination.
and ine love oi me country is stltled.
He claims that the farmers are daily
rowing poorer tnrougn ine deteriora
tion of their lands and the lowering of
the prices of their products. He says
that the working men are crying for
relief and demand Bteadier employ
ment as under the present system they
are fast approaching perpetual servi
tude. He thinks this condition will
surely bring an uprising against the
the government if some relief is not
given.
THE TARIFF.

FOREIGN KKLATIOKS. v
In pursuance of a constitutional pro
vision requiring the president from
time to time to give to the congress in
formation of the state of the Union, I
have the satisfaction to announce that
the close of the year finds tbe United
States in the enjoyment of domestic
tranquility and at peace with all the
nations. Since my last annual mes
sage our foreign relations have been
strengthened and improved, by per
formance of international good offices
and by new and renewed treaties of
amity, commerce and reciprocal extra
dition of criminals. Those interna
tional questions' which still await set
settlement are all reasonably within
the domain of amicable negotiation,
and there is no existing subject of dis
pute between the United States and
any foreign power tbat is not suscepti
ble of satisfactory arrangement' by
frank diplomatic treatment.
The questions between Great Brit
ian and tbe United States relating to
the rights of American fisherman un
der treaty and international comity in
tbe territorial waters of Canada and
Newfoundland, I regret to say, are not
yet satisfactorially adjusted. These
matters were fully treated in my mes
sage to the senate of Feb. 20. 1888, to-
eether with which a convention conclud
ed under my authority with her majes
ty's government on the 10th of February
last, for the removal of all causes of
misunderstanding, was submitted by
me for the approval of the senate.
(Tbe president then reviews the his
tory of the rejection of the treaty and
bis action and states that nothing has
occurred tbat can be added to those
facts.)
Having essayed, in the discharge of
nv duty, to nrocure bv negotiation the
settlement of a long-standing cause of
dispute and to remove a constant
menace to the good relations of the
two countries, and continuing of the
opinion tbat the treaty of February
last which failed to receive the appro
val ot the senate, did supply "a satis
factory, practical and final adjustment
on a basis honorable and just to ootn
parties to the difficult and vexed ques
tion to which it related," and having
subsequently and unavailingly recom
mended other legislation to congress,
wbich I hoped would suffice to meet the
exigency created by the rejection of
the treaty, 1 now again invoke the
earnest and immediate attention of the
congress to the condition of this im
portant question as it now stands be
fore them and the country, and for the
settlement of which I am deeply soiic
itous.
THE SACKVILLK EPISODIC.
Near the close of the month of Octo
ber last, occurrences of a deeply regret-
able nature were brought to my knowl
edge, which made it my painful but
imperative duty to obtain, witn as lit
tle delay' as possible, a new personal
channel of diplomatic intercourse in
this country with the government of
Great Britain. Tbe correspondence in
relation to this incident will in due
course be laid before you, and will dis
close tbe unpardonable conduct of tbe
official rererred to in his intenerence,
by advice and counsel, with the suf-
irnsres or American citizens, in tne
very crisis of the presidential election
then near at hand, and also in his sub-
equen. publie declaration o iustuv
his action, superadding tne impugn
ment of the executive and senate of
the United States in connection "with
important questions now pending in
controversy between the two govern
ments. The offense thus committed
was most grave, inviting disastrous
?03sibilities to tbe good relation of the
fnitosl Mt-atna anrl lirAitt. Itritnin enn-
stituting a gross breach of diplomatic
privilege and an invasion oi tne pureiy
domestic affairs and essential sover
eignty of the government to which the
envoy was accredited. Having first
fulfilled the just demands of interna
tional comity by affording full oppor
tunity tor her majjpty a government to
act in relief of the situation. I consid
ered the prolongation of the discussion
to be unwarranted, and therupon Re
clined to further recognize the diplo
matic character of the person whose
continuance in such function would
destrov that mutual confidence which
H essential to the irood understanding
of tbe two governments, and was in
consistent with the welfare and self-
respect of the government of . the
United States. The usual interchange
of communication has siuce been con
tinued through her majesty's legation
in this city.
Mv endeavors to establish by inter
national co-onoration measures for the
prevention of the extermination of fur
seals in Inhering Sea have not been
relaxed and I have hopes of being
enabled shortly to submit an effective
and satisfactory conventional project
with the maritime powers for the ap
proval of the senate.
The coastal boundary between our
Alaskan possessions and British Col
umbia, ! regret to say, has not receiv
ed the attention demanded by its im
portance and wbich on several occa
sions heretofore I have had the honor
to recommend to the congress.
On the 12th of April last I laid be
fore tbe house of representatives full
information respecting our interests in
Samoa and in the subsequent corres
pondence on the same subject which
will be laid before you in due course, the
history of events in those islands will
be round.
In a message accompaning my ap
proval on the first day of October last
of a bill for tbe exclusion of Chinese
laborers, I laid before congress full in
formation of all correspondence touch
ing the negotiation of the treaty, with
China, concluded at this capitol on the
th day or March, 1883, and whien
having been confirmed by the senate
with certain amendments, was rejected
by the Chinese government. This
message contained a recommendation
that a sum of money be appropriated
compensation to Chinese subjects
who have suffered injures at the
hands ot the lawless men within our
jurisdiction, such appropriation having
been duly made, the fund awaits re
ception by the Chinese government.

recomended that indemnity be paid to

president of tbe United States at the
city of New York, have been made by
a voluntary organization of the citi
zens .of tbat locality, and believing
that an opportunity should be afforded
for tbe expression of the interest felt
throughout the country in this event,
I respectfully reccommend fitting and
co-oporative action by congress on be
half of the people of the United
States. , .

ordinary revenues of the government
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1888,
amounted to 8379,256,074.76. of which
$218,091,173.63 was received from-cus-.
toms duties, and 9124,296,871.98 from
internal taxes. .
The total receipts from all sources
exceeded those for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1887, by $78,627,871. Tbe or
dinary expenditures of the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1889, were $2-57.653,-958.67,
leaving a surplus of $119,612,-
116.09. j. he decrease in tues expend
itures as compared with the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1887, was $8,278,221.31,
notwithstanding the payment of more
than five million dollars for pensions
in excess of what was paid for that
purpose in the latter mentioned year.
The revenues of tbe government for tbe
year ending June 30, 1889. ascertained
for the quarter ended September 30,
1888, and estimated lor the remainder
of the time amount to $377,000,000,
and the actual and estimated ordinary
expenditures for the same year are
$273,000,000. leaving an estimated sur
plus of $101,000,000.
.Daily purcnases oi bonus were com
menced on tbe 23rd day of April, 1888
and have continued until tbe present
time and by this plan, bonds of the
government, not yet due, have been
purchased up to and including tne sutn
day of November, 1888; amounting to
$94,700,400; the premium paid thereon
amounting to $17,508,613.08.

is reviewed and the views are urged
upon con cress and adds: Another
class of postal employes whose condi
tion seems to demand legislation is
that of clerks in postofiices, and 1 call
especial attention to the repeated rec
ommendations of the postmaster gen
eral for their classification. Pro;ei
legislation of this character for tbe re
lief or curriers in the iree delivery ser
vice has been frequent. Provision is
made for their promotion; for substi
tutes for them on vacation; for sulsti-
tutes ior nouuays, auu mmunir uieir
hours of labor. Seven million dollars
has been appropriated for the current
year to provide for them, although the
total number of offices where they are
employed is but 358 for the past fiscal
vear. with an estimated increase for
the current year of but forty, while the
total appropriations for all clerks in
offices throughout the United States is
$5,950,000.
The legislation affecting the statutes
of the government with railroads is in
need ot revision. While for the most
part the railroad companies through
out the country have cordially co-operated
with the post office depaitment in
rendering excellent service, yet, under
the law, as it stands, while the com
pensation to them for carrying the
mail is limited and reeulated, and al
though railroads are made post roads
by law, there is no authority reported
auy where to compel the owuer of a
railroad to take and carry the United
States mail. The only alternative pro
vided by act of congress in case of re
fusal is for t he Postmaster General to
send mail forward by pony express.
This is but an illustration ol ill fitting
legislation, reasonable and proper at
the time of its enactment but long
since outgrown and requiring read
justment. It is gratifying to note
from the carefully prepared statistics
accompanying the rostmaster uen
Tral's report that notwithstanding the
ci eat expansion of the service the rate
of expenditure has been lessened and
efficiency bas been improved in every
branch; tbat Traud and crime nave de
creased; that losses from the mails
have been reduced, and that the num
ber of complaints of the service made
to postmasters and to the
department are far less than
ever before. The transactions of
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
For the liscal year ended June 30
18S8, are contained in the report of the
attorney general as well as a uumber
of valuable recommendations, the
most of which are repititions of those
previously made and ought to receive
consideration. It is stated in this
report that though judgements in civil
suits amounting to $552,021.08 were
recovered in favor of the government
durinsr the year only The sum oi ttii'Z.
934 was collected thereon, and that
thoutr'i lines, penalties and forfeitures
were imposed amounting to $541,808.43,
only $109,648.42 of that sum was paid
on uccouut thereof. These facts may
furnish an illustration of the senti
ment which extensively prevails that a
debt due the government should
cause no inconvenience to the citizens.
In
THE ItEPOUT OF THE SECRETAUY OF
THE INTERIOR.
which will be laid before you, the con
dition of the various branches of our
domestic affairs connected with that
department and its operations during
the past year are fully exhibited. I
cannot too strenuously insist on the
importance of proper measures to in
sure a right disposition of our public
lauds, not only as a matter of present
justice, but in forecast of the conse
quences to future generations. The
broad. rch acres of our agricultural
plains have been long preserved by na
ture to become her uutramelled gift to
a people civilized and free, upon which
should rest in well distributed owner
ship, the numerous homes of enlight
ened, equal and fraternal citizens, u e

which permits rapacious seizure by
favored few of expanded areas, that
many should enjoy, are accessory
to offences against our national we
fare and humanity not to be too severe
ly condemned or punished. It is grati-
iying to snow mat sometning- nas been
done at last to redress the injuries to
our people and check the perilous tend
encv of the reckless waste of national
domain. That over eighty million acres
have been arrested for lllesral usurva
tion, inproyident grant ami fraudulent
entries and claims to be taken for the
homesteads of honest industry, al
though less than the greater. 'areas
thus unjustly must offerd a
profound ... gratification to right
feelingcitizens as it is a re
compense for the labors and atruezles
of the recovery our dear experience and
ougtr; sufficiently to urge the speedy
enactment of measures of legislation
which will confine the future disposi
tion of our remaining agricultural
lands to the uses of actual husbandry
and genuine homes. ' Xor should our
vast tracts of so called desert land be
yielded up to the monopoly ol corpor
ations or grasping individuals, as ap
pears to be much the tendency under
the existing statute. -- f The lands re
quires but the supply of water to be
come fertile and productive. It is a
problem or great moment how more
wisely for tbe public good that fac
tor shall be furnished. I cannot
but think it perilous to suffer either
those lands or the sources of their irri
gation to fall into the hands of mo
nopolies which, by suchmeahs, may
exercise lordship over areas dependent
on tueir ireaunenb tor piouuctivcucaa.
Already steps have been taken to se
cure accurate and scientific informa
tions wbich are the prime basis of in
telligent aution. Until this shall be
gained tbe course of wisdom appears
clearly to be in a suspension of further
disposal, which only promises to create
rights antagonistic to the common in
terest. No harm can follow this cau
tionary ' conduct. The land will re
main and the public good presents no
demand for the hasty dispossession of
national ownership and control. I
commend also the recommendations
that appropriate measures be taken to
complete tbe adjustment of tbe vari
ous grants made to tbe states for in
ternal improvements, and of swamp
and overflowed lands, as well as to ad
judicate and finailv determine the val
idity and extent of the numerous pn
vate land claims. All these are ele
ments of -great injustice and peril to
the settlers upon the localities affected.
and now that their existence cannot be
avoided no duty is mora pressing than
to fix as soon aa possible their bounds

which arise from uncertainty.

These conditions testily to the value
of the higher tone of consideration
and humanity which has governed
the later methods of dealing with
them and commands its continued
observance. Allotments in severalty
have been made on some reserva
tions until all those entitled to land
Lave had their shares assigned them
and the work is still continued in
directing the execution of this duty.
I have not aimed so much at rapid
dispatch as to secure just and fair
arrangements which shall best conduce
to the objects of the law producing
satisfaction with the results of the
allotments made. It proffers oppor
tunity and inducement to that inde
pendence of spirit and life which the
Indian peculiarly needs, while at tbe
same time the inalienability of title
affords security against the risks bis
inexperience of affairs or weakness ot
character may expose hira to in deal
ing with others. 'Whenever begun

made complete so tbat all are brought

The number of pensioners added to
the rolls during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1888, is 60,252, and increase of
pensions were gran bed in 4o, lb cases.
The names of 15,730 pensioners were
dropped from the rolls during the year
lor various causes, and at tue ciose or
the year the number of persons of all
classes receiving pensions was 452,557
Of these there were 806 survivors of
the war of 1S12; 1,078 widows of those
who served in that war; 16.060 soldiers
of the Mexican war. and 5,104 widows
of Baid sjldicrs. I am thoroughly con
vinced that our general pension laws
should be revised and adjusted to meet.
as far as possible in tbe light ot our
experience, all meritorious cases. 1 he
tact that one hundred and two differ
ent rates of pensions are paid cannot.
in my opinion, be made consistent
with justice to the pensioners or the
croverumeut. and the numerous pri
vate ptiiision bills tbat are passed, pred
icated upon tue luiperieciiou ni gener
al laws, while they increase in many
cases the existing ine uality and in
justice, lend additional foice. to the
recomraeaation i or a revision ot ine
general laws on this subject. The lax
ity of ideas prevailing among a large
number oi our people regarding pen
sions is becoming every oay more
marked. The principles upon which
they should be granted are in danger
of being altogether ignored. . ami al
ready pensions are otten claimed be
cause the applicants are as much en
titled as other successful applicants
rather than upon any disability reas
onably attributable to military service.
If the establishment of various prece
dents be continued; if the granting of
pensions be not divorced from partisan
and other unworthy and irrelevant
consiuerations, and if the honorable
name of veterans unfairly becomes by
these means bnt another -term for one
who constantly clamors for the aid of
the government, there is danger that
injurv will be done to the fame and
patriotism of many whom our citizens
all delight to honor, ana thatapreju
dice will be aroused unjust to meri
torious applicants for pensions.
The depaitment of agriculture has
continued with a good measure of suc
cess, its efforts to develop tbe process
es, enlarge the resu lt and augment the
profits of . American husbandry. It
has collected and distributed practical
information, introduced and tested
new plants, checked the spread of con
tagious diseases of farm animals, re
sisted the advaneo or noxions insects
and destructive Iuptus growths and
sought to scnre the agricultural labor
tbe mgnest reward or effort and the
fullest immunity from loss. ls record
of the year show that the season of
1888 has been one of medium produc
tion. A generous supply of tbe de
mands ot consumption has been as
surred and a surplus for the exports

ful there were in soner of tbe states
any laws authorizing this department
to eradicate the malady or giving the
state officials power to eo-operate with
it for this purpose. Tfca department
even lacked both the requisite appro
priation and authority.- By securing
state co-operation in connection with
authority from congress, the work of
eradication has been passed successful-
ana this areadea disease nas been
extirpated from the western states,
and also from tbe eastern states with
the execution of a few restricted
cases which are still under supervision.
The danger has been removed and

JJurinrtne past four years the pro
cess of diffusion as appHfatte tfce tnan-
ufacture of sugar irom sorghum and
sugarcane has been-introduced into
this country and fully peifected by the
experiments carried on by the depart
ment of agriculture. J. his process is
now universally considered to be the
most economical one and it is thought
that the sorghum industry has been esr
tablished upon a firm basis and the
road to its future success opened. The
adoption or this diffusion process is
also extending in Louisiana aud other
sugar producing parts of the country
and will doubtless be the only methdd
employed for the extraction of sugar
from the cane.
An exhaustive study has also within
the same period been undertaken of
the subject of food adulteration an i
the best analytical method for detect
ing it. Apart of the results on this
worlt has already been published Lv
the department, which, with the mat
ter in course of preparation, will make
the most complete treatise on that
subject that bas ever been published in
any country, a supervision of tne en
dowed experimental station system re
cently provided for is a proper I unc
tion of the department and now in op
eration. This supervision is very im
portant and should be wisely and vig
ilantly directed to the end that tne pe
cuniary aid of the government in favor
of intelligent agriculture should lie so
applied as to result in the general good
and the benefit of all our people, thus
justifying the appropriations made
from the public treasury.
The adjustment of the relations be
tween the government and the rail
road companies which have received
land grants and the guaranty of the
public credit in aid of the construction
of their roads, should receive early at
tention.
I again call attention to the present
inconvenience and the danger to life

of steam railroads through and across

these railroads, and lietter secure the
convenience and safety of citizens, is
manifest.
The consciousness that I have pre

Chicago, Dec. 5. The Times this
morning says: It is reported that east
ern capitalists have been for some days
considering a scheme that is of mnch
greater magnitude than that of the col
lapsed "clearing- house" arrangement.
it provides for tbe creation of a syndi
cate, which is to secure a controlling
interest in all western roads aud man
age them as one system.-. A gentleman
well informed in railroad affairs, but
who prefers to be nameless, said: This
clearing house scheme, or whatever
may be substituted for it, is intended
to be only a makeshift a temporary
affair, put forth as a "feeler" you
might say something to prepare the
public mind for tbe introduction of a
broader and more effective plan for
putting an end to rate wars and revo
lutionizing railwav management. I
happen to know that the ultimate aim
and purpose of the capitalists who
have been in consultation in New
ork. is to form a great railroad syn
dicate and mass all the roads west of
ChicRgo and .St. Louis under!
. in rwy T
one controlling power, xue organ
ization is to be a gigantic stock
company and xtock holders will be
guaranteed say hv per cent on their
stock so tbat" whi e it will amount
practically to a consolidation of all the
roads it will in reality be nothing
more than a leasing of the various
lines. There is no law against leasing
railroads and until there is such a law
it cannot be urged that there is any
thing illegal in tbe scheme.- I do
not know how soon it will be put into
operation and presume the proprietors
have not decided that point but that it
has not been abandoned 1 am sure.
Bates could be made lowerthan they
are at present because they would be
unitorm. mere would be no compe
tition and fast trains could be estab
lished just where there was a demand
for them and there would be no rivals
to rush in and kill the profits of the
business by dividing it up into infinite
similar proportions."
President B. it. Cable of the Bock
Island was asked what he thought of
the proposed plan. -"I
have not considered it," he replied,
"In fact, I don't know anything about
such a plan, except that something of
the kind has been hinted at in the gossip
from the east. I don't believe there is
any truth in it."
President C. E. Perkins of the Chi
cago, Burlington & Quincy passed
through the city yesterday on his way
to Boston. He declared that he knew
nothing about the proposed combina
tion-and felt no interest in the matter.
Haytiea Seixarea Settled
New York, Dec. 5 At last the un
certainty regarding the fate of the
American steamer Haytien ltepublic,
seizt-d by the Haytien gunboat Bessa
lines off the harbor of St. Marizenes, is
about to be cleared up. Captain Comp-
ton s piucK in sticking by bis vessel
and refusing to haul down the Ameri
can colors, in defiance of the demands
of the colored guards in possession of
the steamer, will be rewarded and the
vessel released. This was the news
received at Lord & Austin's, agents of
the seized vessel inthiscitv, y ester

were received the btatements of the

More Cabinet 8peca!ation.
Indianapolis, Dec, 4. About the
only out of town-callers of note upon
the president elect to-day. was General
J. A. Williamson, of Iowa, ex-commis
sioner of the general land office, who is
enroute to Boston. Speaking of Sena
tor Allison's probable membership of
President Harrison's cabinet,' the ex
commissioner stated he was inclined to
believe after a long acquaintance with
the Iowa senator that he did not care
to leave the senate at present, and
while he thought it more than likely
that Mr. "Allison would be invited to a
very high seat in the cabinet he
thought it wonld be declined and
that the senator would recommend
Vice-Chairman Clarkson for a port
folio. After Allison he felt confident
that Clarkson was the choice of Iowa
republicans. -
General liairison passed the greater
part of the day in his library. About

convenience. To-morrow if tbe
weather ir pleasant the president-elect
proposes to take a holiday and enjoy
a little grouse shooting.
. The Emperor Takes a Xrie
Be ii lis. Dec 4. The emperor drove
out at noon to-dar. being his first out
ing in ten days. If the tattle in Paris
and Vienna bave any basis his condi
tion would be serious enough to alarm
Germany. French papers insist tbat
bis ear malady has reached a critical
phase, causing purulent discharge
and tbat Doctors Bergman, Bardlehen
and others hold daily consultation,
and tneir names are en voted tor. the
purpose of raising alarm. His illness
is associated with a disease requiring
treatment by specialists. These false
reports have elicited a statement from
the court oricular that th health of
the emperor is thoroughly satisfactory.
His drive out at tbe time when business
activity was the greatest set all rumors
at rest.
Among the latest Orders issued bv
the emperor is one prohibiting officers
in Berlin and other : great - garrison
towns under penalty of firm days arrest
trom using civilian dress when off
duty. The custom has been growing
among officers t throw aside their
military garb upon every possible oc
1 eastern This does !et meet Emper
or William's aim, his object being to
glorify military function.

train. After breakfasting at the
depot the funeral party returned to the
private car and remained until the
time for the funeral cortege to move.
The pall bearers took charge of
the casket at 10:20 a. m. They were:
Major General John Pope. U. S. A.
Brigadier General lolin B. Henderson,
U.S.A.; lingadier General John w

fied Mr, James E. Yeaton by telegraph
of the choice. .
There were two jvagon loads of floral
offerings at the hearse, and when the
casket was placed therein the funeral
party entered carriages at Poplar street
entrance of depot, and the cortege pro
ceeded to at. Aaviers church , Grand and
Luedell avenue. At the church the

The church was crowded. When the
friends and relatives were seated Kev.
Father Brousgeest, the pastor, came
out from the vestry and began the
celebration of mass. In accoi dance
with request of deceased the celebra
tion of mass was followed by a simple
Bervice tor the dead, no sermon being
preached. The music was the
ordinary accompaniment for such
service. The church was heavily
draped, and at the conclusion of the
brief service the casket was returned
to the hearse and tbe cortege proceeded
to Calvary cemetery, where the ser
vices were brief and simple.
General Sherman has two lots in
Calvary cemetery. One is a rectangu
lar lot in wbich his two sons and three
grandchildren are buried, tbe other is a
lot almost circular in shape, which un
til to-day was untenanted. It adjoins
the other lot, and it was the wish of
tbe General that his wife should be in
terred there. A space ten feet square
has been reserved in the center of the
lot for a monument, and Mrs. Sher
man's body was placed in the prettiest
spot between tbe proposed monument
and the roadway in front of the lot

husband, who-intends to be buried
there. A combination monument for
both is to be erected at some future
date.
The family will leave on the Van
dalia train at 8 o'clock this evening on
their return trip.
CONGRESSIONAL CULLINGS-
8objeots Discasted by Legislators for tbe Good of
- the Country.
Washington, Dec. 4. In the senate
to-day various annual reports including
that of the secretary of the treasury
were presented and appropriately re
ferred, including one for tbe construc
tion of two steel cruisers to be
armed with dynamite guns.
Frye at 12:30 moved to proceed to the
consideration of the Union Pacific set
tlement bill.
Mitchell opposed the motion on the
ground that he had had no time to ex
amine the report; it was a malter that
should be looked into and the senate
might go on to-day with something
that senators knew more about.
- Teller also favored postponement of
the matter as he had no opportunity to
investigate the subject.
Frye said the matter was a very
familiar one to the senate. A select
committee, had been appointed early
last session to consider it, and had de
voted much time to the investigation.
The committee had found that the two
Pacific railroad companies, the Union
and the Central, could not be connect
ed on account of tbe difference in con
ditions and capacities of tbe corpora
tions. Therefore the committee had
unanimously reported a bill touching
the Union Pacific only. The report had
been made in writing and had been
printed as long ago as July last, (he
thought) and could be disposed of in
four or five morning hours.
Plumb said there was no particular
reason for haste as the debt would not
mature for nine years. In - the pre
sent temper of the public mind and in
view of some promises rather recently
made there was some obligation rest
ing on the -senate to discharge public
business before it took up any matter
of private concern. In his judgment
the bill would require a good deal of
debate. Without saying what might
eventually become of the bill, he
thought it would be round to be one of
rather more importance than tbe
senator from Maine seemed to think.
He therefore moved that if there was
any spare time between now and two
o'clock tbe senate should utilize it by
taking np the tariff bill at once. -
On motion or Allison the tariff bill
was then, at 12:30, taken up for con
sideration.

entries to make another entry. Be
ferred. During the closing of the last session
Dingley, of Maine, succeeded in having
made a special order for to-day a bill
for the erection of a monument to Ma
jor General Henry Knox at Thomas
ton. Maine, but subsequently Kilgore,
of Texas, entered a motion to recon
sider the vote by which the order was
made. Dingley to-dav called np this
motion and moved to lay it on the
table.
Kilgore opposed tbe latter motion
declaring that there was no warrant in
the constitution for the appropriation
of $50,000 as proposed by tbe bill. O n
a standing vote jJingiev s motion was
carried 86 to 42. But Kilgore raised
the point of no quorum, thus eliciting
the remark, tbat sounds natural from
the republican side. The yeas and
nays were ordered and- Dingley's mo
tion prevailed, yeas, l2o; nays 53.
The house then proceeded to the
consideration of the bill and Dingley
briefly sketched the public service of
General Knox. Kilgore agreed with
anything that could be said in praise
of General Knox but he did not think
that General Knox s reputation was
superior to . the constitution of the
United states.
COMMENTS ON THE MESSAGE.
Hew York Dailies Hake Short Work of tbe Pres
ident's last Message.
New York, Dec. 4. The Sun, in its
editorial comments on the president's
message, says: Tbe main fact is that
nowhere does Mr. Cleveland specify, or
even suggest any line of policy to be
pursued in dealing with the question
of the surplus and the taxes.
TITE IIEBALD
says it is a plain, business-like report
of the condition or the various depart
ments, prefaced by a few paragraphs
in wbich Mr. Cleveland speaks for
more impartial laws and a strict ad
herence to 'constitutional methods, so
tbat monopolies and trusts shall not
increase, but tbat all Americans shall
have a fair chance in the race of life
What be savs on this head is sensible
and well put, but as the people have
lust elected to power a party which
favors monopolies, trusts and capital
istic combinations, Mr. Cleveland is as
one crying in the wilderness. When
ever tlte people get tired of the present
system of taxation they have it in their
power to cnange it. t or tne present.
the recent elections show that they do
not care enough about its evil effects
to order a change.
TILE TRIBUNE
says the message is not as care
fully witten as the president's
other othcial papers, but its crude
or awkward phrases count for
nothing in comparison with its mis
chievous tone. It will not be out of
place for the senate to sharply rebuke a
chief magistrate who sets himself tc
flame blind prejudice and lawless pas
sion against employers generally,
whatever their personal worth or merit
and against tbe institutions and laws
which the people have recently sus
tained by their verdict. Mr. Cleveland
gained a reputation for courage and
candor when be cut through disguises
and avowed free trade theories, but he
does not gain in any respect when he
gives vent to personal soreness and
passion in his last annual message,
THE TIMES
says, the wholesome and important
truths lying at the base of Mr. Cleve
land's remarks, are, in our judgement
somewhat obscured by overstatement
It is perfectly true that some of tbe
higher protective duties of the tariff
foster monopoly, levy taxes not for the
common needs, but for the benefit of
a privileged class, and impose gross
inequalities upon the people, but the
class benefitted is small. It does not
include all, or even -the greater num
ber of "our manufacturers." On the
contrary, the great body of our manu
facturers suffer by the taxes that en
rich the few, being compelled to pay
them in the cost of tbe materials made
by tbe few. That fact, if presented to
Mr. Cleveland s mind, did not get ade
quate expression, nor is the reference
to the "communism of combined
wealth and capital'.' an accurate or
happy one. If tltere be any idea at the
bottom of communism it is tbat all pos
sessions shall be in common, and that
is the opposite of what the wealthy
men who thrive bv favor of the tariff
believe or practice.
Eight Hoars a Day's Work.
Beading, Pa., Dec. 4. The Phila
delphia & Beading railroad company
posted notices in all of its shops this
afternoon notifying its employes that
on and after to-morrow eight hours will
be a day's work instead of ten as here
tofore, mere win ne oi course a
proportionate reduction in the
wages. The cause of the re
duction in the working hours is due
to the suspension of the coal mines and
all persons connected with the coal
traffic will also be reduced to eight
hours. This will enable the company
to keep all men employed but at shorter
hours; three or four thousand men are
thus affected along the entire system.
The eight hour system may be con
tinued several months.
Operation Performed oa Charley Mitchell.
Philadelphia, - Dec. " 4. Charley
Mitchell had an operation performed
on his left hand at Atlantic City to
day and will hardly be in shape to fight
for some weeks. Mitchell's third and
fourth knuckles were "knocked out of
place in the fight in France and it was
found that the hand would never be
strong until the bones were returned to
their place, so it was found necessary
to loosen up tissues and free certain
nerves which were bound down by os- j
serous substance, the direct result of
two or more fractures, ne thinks
that in a month his hand will be as
good as ever. j

Important to Homesteaders-
Washington, D. C, Dec. 4. Three
senators, Messrs Plumb, Berry and
Dolph and representative McBae to
day introduced bills similar in their
provisions to allow persons who have
abandoned or relinquished tneir nome
stead entries to make another entry.
A similar bill was passed by both
houses of congress last year just before
the close of the session and failed to
become a law only for the reason tbat
it did not reach the president in time
for his signature before -congress ad
journed. The bills introduced to-day
provide that anv person who nas set
tled on tbe public domain and who has
not yet perfected his title thereto and
who mav be unable to subsist on the
lands, by reason of drouth, whole or
partial destruction or. ciops, sicaness
etc. may take out another homestead
entry in place of the abandoned claim.
Bold Attempt at Robbery.
v Sioux City, Iowa, Dec. 4. A bold
attempt was made to rob the safe in
the office of the Booge Packing house
last night about 1 o'clock. Four
masked men rushed upon Thomas
Coleman, the watchman, and overpow
ered him. A gunny-sack was tied over
his head and his hands and legs were
secured and he was laid down in a
corner of the office. As the watchman
did not report, the engineer, the assist
ant engineer and the tank man, went
successively to see what was wrong,
and were seized and bound like Cole
man. The burglars worked hard to
open ;the safe, but at 4 o'clock they
broke a drill and gave up the job, after
going through the pockets of tbe cap
tured men and securing $65.
The Sugar Trust Case-
New York, Dec. 4. General Boger
A. Pryor for the people of the state of
New York, this morning opened the
sugar trust prosecution before Judge
Barrett in the special term of the su
preme court. The particular trust
under consideration to-day is the
North Kiver Sugar Befining company.
In his opening address General
Pryor said tbat as a violation of a law
by a person called for tbe forfeiture of
his liberty or perhaps his life and the
violation of the law by a corporation
required the forfeiture of its charter.
A trust was defined as of a combina
tion of merchants for tbe purpose of .
enhancing any value of any goods to
detriment of the general public and a
right to exclude competition is injuri
ous te the public, he continued, and
that as well exemplified by the old
saying that competition was the life of
trade.
The Sesalt in West Virginia.
Washington, Dec. 4. The receipt
of the news of the result of the vc
count in Charleston, West Virginia,
by which Alderson, democrat, candi
date for Congress from the third dis
trict is given a majority of 17 and tbe
election of Fleming, democrat,
for governor, is said to be
assured,- did not disturb the , re
publican leaders so they say. They as
sert that their majority in the house in
the fifty-first congress with the West
Virginia delegation solidly dem
ocratic will be live. The
only apparent effect of the West
Virginia news was to slightly
strengthen the sentiment among the
republican members in favor of holding
an extra session soon after the begin
ning of the new administration. It is
conceded that General Harrison will
make his action in this matter to con
form largely to tbe members elect.
