C. C. Brown of —ake Shore & Michigan
Southern Discusses Irrigation of
Arid Territory—Tells of Bene
fits to Fe Ootained.
(By Associated Press.)
' Chicago, Dec. 4.—W. C. Brown, presi
dent and general manager of the Lake
Shore & Michigan Southern railway, with
headquarters at Cleveland, when asked
for an expression of opinion on the pres
ident's message in regard to the develop
ment of the West, said:
"I cannot express too strongly my ap
preciation of the recommendation of the
president, looking to the reclamation of
the now arid regions in our Western
States and territories by the construction
of great reservoirs for the storage of
Water.
•'The fact that the president favors the
Undertaking of this work by the general
government is logically the result of his
familiarity with conditions in the West
and his practical knowledge of the sub
ject under consideration. The work of
the reclamation of arid lands, under
taken in the comprehensive and thorough
manner which its importance not only
Justifies, but demands, will require a
larger expenditure of money than the
sparsely settled states of the West can
command.
Government Money Needed.
Money for this purpose expended by
the state must be raised by taxation.
This is an obvious impossibility, and
therefore the only alternative left to the
state or territory, unaided by the gen
eral government, would be to farm out
to great syndicates composed of Eastern
capitalists the right to construct the
reservoirs, to own their own water and
control the land reclaimed.
Under this plan the settler seeking a
home upon government land must pay
tribute to the syndicate thus formed in
such amount as the syndicate might
elect.
•'Each year a new generation of young
men is being graduated from farms and
villages and cities of the East and Middle
West. Men who must find some location
for a home and some vocation by which
they may become self-supporting.
Available Land at Premium.
"For years the fertile prairies of Iowa,
Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota
and the Dakotas have attracted thou
sands of these homeseekers and home
makers. These states are rapidly filling
up. Soon they will overflow from the
annual exodus of young men who look
for attractive, opportunities for securing
farms and homes in this territory. When
this time comes some territory must be
found for this rising westward tide of
Civilization.
"The one overshadowing cloud, more
portentlous than any other today, is the
rapidly growing political representation
and influence of the great centers of pop
ulation as against the country. The hope
of the country Is in the 40. 80 and 160
acre farms—thousands of them—owned
and tilled by happy, prosperous Amer
ican citizens, and in no way can this con
dition be brought about so speedily as
by the government undertaking at once
the work of reclaiming and making fruit
ful and fertile the millions of acres of
Jand now its property, but absolutely
•worthless without water.
Advantages of Irrigation.
"It is well within the omits of extreme
conservatism to say that 40 acres of ir
rigated land will produce on an average
more than the best 80 acres in the fertile
Valleys of the Mississippi and Missouri.
Personally I believe that acre for acre,
the irrigated land may be depended upon
to produce three times as much.
"Taking the former estimate, however.
Bs a basis and attempt to compute the
addition to the material wealth of this
country which would result from the ex
penditure in this great work of one-half
the money which is appropriated annu
ally in the river and harbor bill, much
of which, to put it mildly, is spent with
put hope or expectation of return, and
the result will beggar comprehension.
Benefits to Be Derived.
"But above and beyond the material'
ifeatures, consider the moral effect upon
the character of the nation of filling the
foothills and the valleys of the trans
Missouri states with the multitude of
Jiardy pioneers and homebuilders that
{w ill he attracted by the field thus opened
to them.
'.'No recommendation or suggestion has
ipver been made by a president more im
portant than this or more worthy of care

ful consideration, and I hope to see an
appropriation for the Reclamation of the
arid lands of the nation made as regu
larly as that for rivers ami harbors or
for any other great and necessary work
of the national government, and that the
appropriation will lie commensurate In
amount with the great importance of the
work."
Fainting for Prince of Wales.
(By Associated Press.)
London. Dee. 4.—Sir David Tennant,
adjutant general of the Tape, has just
waited upon the Prince and Princess of,
Wales to ask thei raeceptance of an oil
painting, "Lengthening Shadows on the
Shores of False Bay." The picture,
which has been exhibited at the Royal
academy, is a gift from the inhabitants
of Somerset, West ('ape Colony.
London's Dog Show a Success.
(By Associated Press.)
New York. Dec. 4.—A dispatch from
London says: Except for the fact that
the entries are below last year's aggre
gate. the national dog show at Birming
ham this year is an all-round success.
There are 1500 exhibits, of which the
sporting dogs are the feature, while non
sporting classes are fully represented.
Outrages Cause Indignation.
(By Associated Press.)
Vienna, Dec. 4.—An article in the Rus
sian paper. Svet, on the recent Polish
agitation, says the Austrian Poles, who
play rather a prominent part in the
realm of the Hapsburg, are indignant at
the outrages committed iby the Germans
in Posen. The harshness of these Ger
man proceedings, says the Svet, excuse
the Poles to remember that they are a
Slav people and that the laws of nature
call them to join the other branches of
the race in the struggle against a com
mon enemy.
ENGLAND TO AID HENELIK.
Adroit Scheme to Work Detriment to
the Abyssinlans.
(By Associated Press.)
Paris, Dec. 4.—A letter from Jibuti,
East Africa, in the Journal Des Débats
credits Great Britain with adroitness in
her dealings with Emperor Menelik.
It says that Great Britain has induced
the Negris to leave dormant Che frontier
question while the Sout'h African war
lasts, and that Great Britain intends to
settle this question finally in a manner
detrimental to the Abyssinlans.
The writer of the letter asserts that
the various British missions to Abys
sinia were designed to pave the way for
the seizure of the territory separating
the Egyptian sound from Uganda.
Meanwhile, he says, the Abyssinian Ex
ploration company has purchased from
Negus, for £85,000. the mines of the
equatorial provinces.
It is said Colonel Harrington skillfully
obtained a footing with Emperor Men
elik.

ODD CORONATION SCHEMES.
Duke of Norfolk Would Present King
Edward With Fair of Gloves.
(By Associated Press.)
London, Dec. 4.—Close upon 60 claims
of services, to be performed in the cor
onation of King Edward, have been sub
mitted for consideration to the court
of claims, which meets inthe priv;i
council chamber at Whitehall today.
Among other curious schemes is that
of Duke of Norfolk, as lord of the work
shop. to present a pair of gloves to the
sovereign and to hold the sceptre with
the cross while the peers do homage.
Besides this special claim the duke, it
the right of the earldom of Arundel,
claims the office of Butler at the ban
quet.
Nobody who was present at the pro
ceedings of the last court, which sat n
1888 is now alive, but precedent as re
vealed by the records will be strictly
followed.
In virtue of lord chancellor, Lord
Halsbury is expected to preside over the
court today.
A NoteworthjPCombination.
The consolidation of the Chicago Rec
ord and the Chicago Times-Herald was
one of the most important events in the
history of modern metropolitan journal
ism. People familiar with the newspa
pers published in the great capitals of
the world say that the best daily papers
are made in Chicago, and it is well
known that the Chicago Record and the
Chicago Times-Heralii ranked at the
very front among Chicago's best dailies.
Each covered the world's news thorough
ly every day, and each possessed also
distinctive special features giving It that
individuality so attractive to its readers.
Now that the two have been combined,
all the resources and world-wide facil
ities of both papers are united in the
Cnicago Record-Herald. It is in truth
"a great combination"—a combination
without a parallel in American journal
ism. The fortunate readers of the Chi
cago Record and the Chicago Times-Her
ald now receive every day a newspaper
whose news facilities are unequaled by
any other American newspaper.
Boston Outshines London Here.
(By Associated Press.)
London, Dec. 4.—Londoners are much
interested in the report which has been
drawn up by the experts who visited
New York and Boston to obtain infor
mation relating to underground systems
of transit in those cities. On the Cen
tral London railway, which is the most
up-to-date underground line here, not
more than 700 trains are run daily, and
that state of affairs is contrasted with
Boston's record of 250 cars hourly in
each direction.

ship With So Many of Promit^
ence Outside the Combination.
(By Associated Press.)
New York. Dec. 4.—It is authoritatively
stated that negotiations looking to the
formation of a big steel plate combina
tion have been declared off. It is also
stated that there is little llkelihoo.i| at
present of the project being revived. (t
The proposed combine was to have a
capital of 825.000,000 to $50,u00,000. and
it was generally supposed at the time the
negotiations were in progress that the
combination was being organized in the
interest of the United States Steel cor
poration. This view of the case was
strengthened by the fact that an an
nouncement was made that President
Schwall of that concern was giving his
counsel and assistance to the formation
of tlie trust.
Plants Booked to Enter.
The plants that were booked to enter
the trust were the Tidewater Steel com
pany. the Lukens Iron & Steel company,
the Worth Brothers and the Central Iron
& Steel company.
When the combination was proposed it
was said the project was primarily taken
up. so as to prevent a disruption of the
pool through price-cutting, which it was
argued would result in a trade war which
would soon affect the whole steel indus
try.
In any event, the fact should not be
lost sight of that even if the plans of
those interested in the steel plate com
bine had been carried to a successful
issue it follows that the consolidated
company could not 'have been a close
corporation.
Many Important Outsiders.
There are several important concerns
outside of those mapped for membership
and also outside of the United States
Steel corporation. These include ,-tlje
Phoenix Iron company. Otis Steel com
pany limited, Glasgow Iron company,
Carbon Steel company and one or two
plants of the Crucible Steel company,
besides the Jones & Laughlins, limited.
Among the other important concerns
which are members of the pool, ,.bu>
which are conducted on independent
lines, are the Birmingham Rolling Mill
company, the Colorado Fuel & Iron com
pany. Passaic Rolling Mills company, Re
public Iron & Steel company, Cambria
Steel company and the Tennessee Coal
& Iron company.

(By Associated Press.)
Buenos Ayres, Dec. 4.—An official an
nouncement has been made that Chile
has purchased from the Lairds, in Eng
land, two torpedo boat destroyers, for
which was paid £70.000, not including
artillery. The purchase of these vessels
is considered here as being a violation
of the agreement of both republics not
to increase their navies.
To Buy a Man of War.
Argentina, as a result of Chile's action,
has decided to purchase a battleship of
11.000 tons, and has instructed one of the
ministers to Europe to enter into nego
tiations for the purchase of the vessel.
It is believed the ship will be ready for
service next May.
It is announced that the Chilean minis
ter to Argentina has postponed his in
tended trip to the Chilean capital, to
consult his government in reference to
the pending trouble.
The Argentine government has received
no reply from chile.
Both Avoiding Initiative.
It is believed the reply will propose the
evacuation of the disputed territory of
both countries until a decision is an
nounced by the British government, to
which it has been referred for arbitra
tion.
It is understood the Chilean govern
ment wishes to let matters drift along
and try to avoid an actual conflict with
Argentina, and yet refrain from making
a frank explanation.
Argentina has decided to insist upon
obtaining a response from Chile that
v ill clear away the unsatisfactory feat
ures of the case.
EUROPEAN TRADE BALANCE.
Londoner Says It Exists Notwith
standing Contrary Claims.
(By Associated Press.)
London, Dec. 4.—The financial editor
of the London Times in discussing tht
foreign credit of the United States
dwells upon the fact that, in spite of the
large apparent balance of trade in fa
vor of the United States, against
Europe, the balance has really been the
other way, because of the borrowing op
erations necessitated by the enormout
consolidations and other schemes in pro
cess of execution by American capital
ists.
The United States, says the article
owes less abroad than it did, but it h
still a debtor country and must remain
so for many years to come, temporary
appearances to the contrary notwith
standing. Therefore, New York ex
change, except for a brief period, has
been in favor of London. The writer
reviews the conditions preceding and
following the Wall street panic of last
summer.
The article ends:
"Endeavor will be made to keep up the
delusion, that the rise has only been
temporarily checked and that it would
soon be resumed. The great prosperity
of the United States was on the belief
that prices would be high and the be
lief that the wealthy, in the sense that
the United Kingdom and France ate
wealthy, namely in the possession of
large quantities of cash or securities
readily convertible in cash, was steadily
upheld.
"It doe3 not seem to have occurred to
those who hold these views that no na
tion, however prosperous, can pass
over, in two or three years, from a state
of being largely dependent on money
borrowed from abroad, to one of being
a large lender to the foreign countries.'
