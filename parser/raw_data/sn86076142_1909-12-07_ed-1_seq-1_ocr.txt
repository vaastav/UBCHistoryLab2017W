MEMPHIS, Dec. 6. Abe At-
tell, the featherweight cham-
plon, was forced to exert him-
self to the limit to get the de-
cision over Charlie White of
Chicago, in an eight round con-
test tonight. The decision was
unpopular. At long range
White haij the better of the
fighting but his blows seemed
to lack steam and only once
did he stagger Attell. Attell
forced the fighting throughout
and punished White severely
with short arm jabs to wind
and head. Referee Barry de-
cided in Attell's favor on ac-
count of Attell's superior in-
fighting, which was not re-
ceived favorably by many.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. The two
houses of congress convened today
for the first regular session of the
61st congress." The proceedings
were mostly of a social nature, ' and
practically no business was - trans
acted. The senate's thirteen minute
session was enlivened by an unsuc
cessful effort of Senator Bailey to
defeat the passage of the usual res
olution that the daily sessions be
gin at noon, suggesting that the
senate should convene at 2 o'clock.
Bailey said he would like to see
night sessions held, so that the day
could be devoted to individual bus
iness. Although only 341 members re
sponded to their names, almost the
entire membership appeared on the
floor of the house, and there were
few who did not have one or more
bills to offer. These included one
of Representative Garner of Penn
sylvania for a congresional Investi
gation of the entire customs service';
one by Representative Hitchcock of
Nebraska for the establishment of
postal savings banks; one by Repre
sentative Mann, for the free admis
sion of wood pulp; one by Repre
sentative Hamilton of Michigan, to
grant statehood to New Mexico and
Arizona.
Joint committees were named by
both houses to wait upon the presi
dent and Inform him that congress
Is in session and ready for business.
The president's response will con
stitute his annual message, the read
ing of which will consume nearly
all of tomorrow's session. Today
the house held a 40 minute session,
during which W. W. McCredie was
sworn in as a new representative
from Washington, succeeding the
late Francis Cushman.
Resolutions of respect in memory
of Senator Johnson, and North Da
kota Representatives DeArmond and
Lassiter, were adopted. As a fur
ther mark of respect, both houses
adjourned until tomorrow.

IN CALIFORNIA
By Associated Press
NEW YORK, Dec. 6. The Phoe
nix Insurance company of Brooklyn
is under investigation for irregular
ities which are believed to have im
paired the surplus by at least $1,
000,000. Superintendent Hotchkiss
of the state insurance department
today laid the matter before the dis
trict attorney. It is charged that
the president has overdrawn his sal
ary, unloaded doubtful securities on
the company, and used the com
pany's assets as collateral to secure
his own private speculative accounts.
In a formal statement tonight,
Hotchkiss says he doesn't believe
the capital of the company is im
paired, and that thus far there is no
evlaence that the securities are not
intact, but admits that the present
investigation is not yet completed
He censures the directors.
George P. Sheldon, a member of
many clubs, now chairman of the
laws and legal committee of the nat
ional board of fire underwriters, has
been president of the Phoenix com
pany since 1887. It is charged that
under his administration the annual
report of his company made to the
insurance department for ten years,
and probably longer, was false in
more than one particular. Accord
ing to Hotchkiss, the Phoenix com
pany has not been examined for
nearly 22 years.
The Phoenix Fire Insurance com
pany of ' Brooklyn is Incorporated
for $1,500,000, and is credited with
a surplus of $1,010,453. It is an
nounced tonight that the directors

NICE, France, Dec. 6. Antonio
Fernandez, an aviator, met. death
today, while flying for the first time
in an aeroplane of his- own inven

The accident appears to have been
due mainly to the inexperience and
recklessness of the aviator, who was
impatient on account of recent dif
ficulties with the machine and, not
heeding his mechanician, he patched
up a defective part of the machine
by binding it with common twine,
causing the machine to capsize. He
fell while trying to make a sharp
